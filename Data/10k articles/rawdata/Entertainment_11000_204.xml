'''''Anowa''''' is a [[play (theatre)|play]] by [[Ghana]]ian playwright [[Ama Ata Aidoo]] published in 1970. It is based on a traditional [[Ghana|Ghanaian]] tale of a daughter who rejects [[Courtship|suitors]] proposed by her parents, Osam and Badua, and marries a stranger who ultimately is revealed as [[Devil|the Devil]] in disguise. The play is set in the 1870s on [[Gold Coast (region)|the Gold Coast]], and tells the story of the heroine Anowa's failed marriage to the slave trader Kofi Ako.

The play has a unique trait where a couple, an old man and an old woman, play the role of the [[Chorus effect|Chorus]]. They present themselves at crucial points in the play and give their own views on the events in the play.

Anowa's attitude of being a modern independent woman angers Kofi Ako. He requests her to be like other normal women. Anowa lives in a [[Hallucination|hallucinated world]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/hallucination|title=the definition of hallucination|website=Dictionary.com|access-date=2018-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the sorrow of not bearing a child [[depression (mood)|depresses]] her. Her rich husband, now [[frustrated]] with his wife asks her to leave him. Anowa argues with him and finds out that he had lost his ability to bear children and the fault was in him and not in her. This disclosure of the truth drives Kofi Ako to shoot himself and Anowa drowns herself.

Anowa represents the modern woman who likes to make her own decisions and live life as per her choice. An additional conflict is that although a [[Tribe|tribal]] woman, she has the traits of a city-bred. Her attitude leads to her destruction.

'''Antakshri''' also known as '''Anthyakshari''' is a [[spoken game|spoken]] [[parlour game|parlor game]] played in [[India]].&lt;ref name="ref01zefil"&gt;{{Citation | title=Sikh women in England: their religious and cultural beliefs and social practices | author=S. K. Rait | publisher=Trentham Books, 2005 | isbn=978-1-85856-353-4 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hRfkTq1ykSIC | quote=''... playing antakshri (a group singing game) ...''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each contestant sings the first verse of a song (often [[Hindustani classical music|Classical Hindustani]] or [[Bollywood songs|Bollywood song]]s) that begins with the [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] [[consonant]] on which the previous contestant's song selection ended.

==Etymology==
The word is derived from two [[Sanskrit]] words: 
# Sanskrit ''Antya'' (अन्त्य) meaning End (adjective)
# Sanskrit ''Akshar'' (अक्षर) meaning letter of the [[alphabet]]
When these words are combined and an '-i' suffixed, the term means "''The game of the ending letter''". 

It is known as ''Anthyakshari'' the same as Sanskrit only in [[Telugu language|Telugu]] and no other Indian language.
Due to [[Schwa deletion in Indo-Aryan languages|schwa syncope in Hindi]] and other Indo-Aryan languages,
Anthakshari is pronounced
*''antaksh.ri''in Hindi,
*"antak.di" in Gujarati,
*"antakkhori" in Bangla (and not ''Antakshari'', though that spelling is common in transliteration).&lt;ref name="ref35roqix"&gt;{{Citation | title=Allied Chambers transliterated Hindi-Hindi-English dictionary |author1=Henk W. Wagenaar |author2=S. S. Parikh |author3=D. F. Plukker |author4=R. Veldhuijzen van Zanten | publisher=Allied Publishers, 1993 | isbn=978-81-86062-10-4 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H1LzD8-iipgC | quote=''... अन्ताक्षरी : antākshri ...''}}&lt;/ref&gt; A dialectical variation of the word is इन्ताक्षरी or ''Intakshri''.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}
==Origin==
Anthakshari was originally present in the Ramayana, where rishis (sages) sang the first verses of bhajanas continuously by singing another Bhajana beginning with the last letter of the ending word.

==Rules==
The game can be played by two or more people and is popular as a group activity during commutes, bus rides etc. The first singer has to sing two complete lines and then s/he may stop at the end of those or following lines. The last Hindi letter of the last word sung is then used by the next singer to sing another song, starting with that letter. The winner or winning team is decided by a process of elimination. The person or team that cannot come up with a song with the right consonant is eliminated if their opponents can produce such a song.

The game is often kicked off with the consonant /m/ (म or م) with the recitation of the following couplet which varies, but usually has wording similar to -
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Baithe, baithe, kya karein? Karna hai kuch kaam, &lt;br&gt;
Shuru karo antakshri, leke prabhu/rabb ka naa'''m'''! &lt;br&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

* This means that the first song must start with (m).
* Songs have to be started from the last sound of the previous song.
* Only songs from [[Hindustani classical music]] or [[Bollywood]] movies are allowed by default. Songs from other languages can be allowed with prior agreement.
* At least the first verse of the song must be sung. If the singer does not remember it in entirety, they cannot use the song.
* No song can be repeated in the game.

==Popularity==
It started as a [[family]] [[pastime]]. Now there are several TV shows and competitions all over India based on it. The classic style is where two or more teams sing songs which start with last consonant letter of the song sung by previous team. When a team sings a song they earn points.

A popular Indian television program by the same name has run successfully on [[Zee TV]] for over 10 years. [[Annu Kapoor]] was the permanent male host while female hosts included Durga Jasraj, Renuka Shahane, Pallavi Joshi, Shefali, Rajeshwari Sachdev &amp; Richa Sharma . Contestants have ranged from school and college-goers to housewives, professionals and celebrities. Mr.Gajendra Singh is known as the Creator of Musical Reality shows in India, Talent Scout extraordinaire’ and a true Visionary who revolutionized the Indian Cable TV scene. He is the man behind conceptualizing 'Antakshari' as a TV show and creating history. The team names of the Zee TV show are Deewane, Parwane, and Mastane.

==Example==

आ चल के तुझे, मैं ले के चलूं, इक ऐसे गगन के तले &lt;br&gt;
जहां ग़म भी न हो, आँसू भी न हो, बस प्यार ही प्यार प'''ले''' &lt;br&gt;
''(Movie: [[Door Gagan Ki]])''

This song ends with ले (le), i.e. the consonant /l/ ल. The next contestant could sing -

'''ल'''ग जा गले कि फिर ये हसीन रात हो न हो &lt;br&gt;
शायद फिर इस जनम में मुलाक़ात हो न हो &lt;br&gt;
''(Movie: [[Woh Kaun Thi]])''

===Example===
Kehne ko jashn-e-bahaaraa hai,&lt;br&gt;
Ishq yeh dekh ke hairaan hai,&lt;br&gt;
Phool se khushboo khafa khafa hain gulshan mein,&lt;br&gt;
Chupa hai koi ranj fiza ki chilman mein.&lt;br&gt;
''(Movie: [[Jodhaa Akbar]])''

The next song should begin with /m/ (the 'n' in ''mein'' is only a nasalization rather than a complete consonant, similar to ''bon''/''good'' in French):

Mai zindagi ka saath nibhata chala gaya, Har fiqr ko dhuen mein uraata chala gaya,&lt;br&gt;
Barbadiyon ka sog manana fizool tha, Barbadiyon ka jashn manata chala gaya.&lt;br&gt;
''(Movie: [[Hum Dono (1961 film)]])''

The next song should begin with (y) and so on.

==Related games==
[[Bait Bazi]] is a related game played with Urdu poetry instead of movie songs. Several [[word chain]] games also resemble ''antakshri'' in their basic methodology.

'''Apologetics''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἀπολογία}}, "speaking in defense") is the religious discipline of defending [[religious doctrine]]s through systematic [[argument]]ation and discourse.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=G627 |title=ἀπολογία |work=Blue Letter Bible-Lexicon |accessdate=19 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01618a.htm |title=Apologetics |date= |website=The Advent |publisher= |accessdate=24 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/apologetics |title=apologetics |date= |website=[[Merriam-Webster Dictionary]] |publisher= |accessdate=5 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[List of early Christian writers|Early Christian writers]] (c. 120–220) who defended their beliefs against [[criticism of Christianity|critics]] and recommended their [[faith]] to outsiders were called [[Christian apologists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Apologists |editor1-last=Cross |editor1-first=F.&amp;nbsp;L. |editor1-link=Frank Leslie Cross |work=The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church |location=New York |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 21st-century usage, ''apologetics'' is often identified with debates over [[religion]] and [[theology]].

==Etymology==
The term ''apologetics'' derives from the [[Ancient Greek]] word ''apologia''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In the Classical Greek legal system, two key technical terms were employed: the prosecution delivered the ''kategoria'' (κατηγορία), and the defendant replied with an ''apologia''. To deliver an ''apologia'' meant making a formal speech or giving an explanation to reply and rebut the charges, as in the case of [[Socrates]]' [[Apology (Plato)|Apologia]] defense, as chronicled in [[Apology (Plato)|Plato's ''Apology'']] (the defense speech of [[Socrates]] at his trial).  This term appears in the [[Koine Greek]] of the [[New Testament]]. The [[Apostle Paul]] employs the term ''apologia'' in his trial speech to [[Porcius Festus|Festus]] and [[Agrippa I|Agrippa]] when he says "I make my defense" in [[Acts 26]]:2.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/act/26/2/s_1044002|title=Acts 26:2|last=|first=|date=19 September 2016|website=Blue Letter Bible|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[cognate]] form appears in Paul's [[Letter to the Philippians]] as he is "defending the gospel" in Philippians 1:7,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/phl/1/7/s_1104007|title=Phl 1:7|last=|first=|date=19 September 2016|website=Blue Letter Bible|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in "giving an answer" in 1 Peter 3:15.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/1pe/3/15/s_1154015|title=1Pe 3:15|last=|first=|date=19 September 2016|website=Blue Letter Bible|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the term ''apologetics'' has Western, primarily Christian origins and is most frequently associated with the defense of Christianity, the term is sometimes used referring to the defense of any religion in formal debate involving religion.

== Apologetic positions ==

===Bahá'í===
{{main article|Bahá'í apologetics}}
Many [[Bahá'í literature#Apologia|apologetic books]] have been written in defence of the history or teachings of the [[Bahá'í Faith]]. The religion's founders wrote several books presenting proofs of their religion, among them are the [[Báb]]'s ''[[Selections from the Writings of the Báb#Dalá'il-i-Sab'ih (The Seven Proofs)|Seven Proofs]]'' and [[Bahá'u'lláh]]'s ''[[Kitáb-i-Íqán]]''.&lt;ref name="PSmith"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter |encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title= apologetics |year= 2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |pages= 39–40 |isbn= 1-85168-184-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later Bahá'í authors wrote prominent apologetic texts, such as [[Mírzá Abu'l-Fadl]]'s ''The Brilliant Proof'' and [[Udo Schaefer]] et al.'s ''Making the Crooked Straight'';.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bahai-library.com/cannuyer_schaefer_desinformation|title=Making the Crooked Straight, by Udo Schaefer, Nicola Towfigh, and Ulrich Gollmer|work=bahai-library.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhism===
One of the earliest Buddhist apologetic texts is ''[[Milinda Panha|The Questions of King Milinda]]'', which deals with the Buddhist metaphysics such as the "no-self" nature of the individual and characteristics such as of wisdom, perception, volition, feeling, consciousness and the soul. In the mid-19th century, encounters between Buddhists and Christians in [[Religion in Japan|Japan]] prompted the formation of a Buddhist Propagation Society {{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}. In recent times, A.&amp;nbsp;L. De Silva, an Australian convert to [[Buddhism]], has written a book, ''Beyond Belief'', providing Buddhist apologetic responses and a critique of Christian Fundamentalist doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.buddhanet.net/pdf_file/beyond-belief02.pdf|title=Beyond Belief, a Buddhist Critique of Fundamentalist Christianity|last=De Silva|first=A.&amp;nbsp;L.|publisher=Three Gems Publications, ebook link at Buddha Dharma Education Association Incorporated, also|year=1994|isbn=978-0-6462-1211-1|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gunapala Dharmasiri wrote an apologetic critique of the [[God in Christianity|Christian concept of God]] from a [[Theravada|Theravadan Buddhist]] perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Buddhist critique of the Christian concept of God : a critique of the concept of God in contemporary Christian theology and philosophy of religion from the point of view of early Buddhism|last=Dharmasiri|first=Gunapala|publisher=Colombo : Lake House Investments|year=1974|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=WorldCat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christianity===

Christian apologetics combines [[Christian theology]], [[natural theology]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/theo-nat/ | title=Natural Theology | publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy | accessdate=10 March 2015 | author=Brent, James}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[philosophy]] to present a rational basis for the Christian faith, to defend the faith against objections and misrepresentation.

Christian apologetics has taken many forms over the centuries. In the [[Roman Empire]], Christians were severely persecuted, and many charges were brought against them. J. David Cassel&lt;ref&gt;J. David Cassel. "Defending the Cannibals: How Christians responded to the sometimes strange accusations of their critics." {{cite web|url=http://www.ctlibrary.com/ch/1998/issue57/57h012.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-09-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110821133320/http://www.ctlibrary.com/ch/1998/issue57/57h012.html |archivedate=2011-08-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; gives several examples: [[Tacitus]] wrote that [[Nero]] fabricated charges that Christians started the [[Great Fire of Rome|burning of Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, Annals XV.44&lt;/ref&gt; Other charges included [[cannibalism]] (due to a literal interpretation of the [[Eucharist]]) and [[incest]] (due to early Christians' practice of addressing each other as "brother" and "sister"). [[Saul of Tarsus]], [[Justin Martyr]], [[Irenaeus]] and others often defended Christianity against charges that were brought to justify persecution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.christianity.com/church/church-history/timeline/1-300/why-early-christians-were-despised-11629610.html|title=Why Early Christians Were Despised|last=|first=|date=|website=Christianity Today (Church history timeline).|publisher=|access-date=21 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later apologists have focused on providing reasons to accept various aspects of Christian belief. Christian apologists of many traditions, in common with Jews, Muslims, and some others, argue for the existence of a unique and personal God. [[Theodicy]] is one important aspect of such arguments, and [[Alvin Plantinga]]'s arguments have been highly influential in this area. Many prominent Christian apologists are scholarly philosophers or theologians, frequently with additional doctoral work in [[physics]], [[cosmology]], [[comparative religions]], or other fields. Others take a more popular or pastoral approach. Some prominent modern apologists are [[Douglas Groothuis]], [[Frederick Copleston]], [[John Lennox]], [[Walter Ralston Martin|Walter R. Martin]], [[Dinesh D'Souza]], [[Douglas Wilson (theologian)|Douglas Wilson]], [[Cornelius Van Til]], [[Gordon Clark]], [[Francis Schaeffer]], [[Greg Bahnsen]], [[Edward John Carnell]], [[James White (theologian)|James White]], [[R.C. Sproul]], [[Hank Hanegraaff]], [[Ravi Zacharias]], [[Alister McGrath]], [[Lee Strobel]], [[Josh McDowell]], [[Peter Kreeft]], [[G. K. Chesterton]], [[C. S. Lewis]], [[William Lane Craig]], [[J. P. Moreland]], [[Hugh Ross (creationist)|Hugh Ross]], [[David Bentley Hart]], [[Gary Habermas]], [[Norman Geisler]] and [[Scott Hahn]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholiceducation.org/articles/apologetics/ap0088.html/ Catholic Education Resource Center: ''The Scott Hahn Conversion Story''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120718093548/http://www.catholiceducation.org/articles/apologetics/ap0088.html/ |date=July 18, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable apologists within the [[Catholic Church]] include [[Robert Barron (bishop)|Bishop Robert Barron]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wordonfire.org/about/fr-robert-barron/|title=Page Not Found - Word On Fire|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[G.

[[John Henry Newman]] (February 21, 1801 – August 11, 1890) was an English convert to [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]], later made a [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]], and [[beatified]] in 2010. In early life he was a major figure in the [[Oxford Movement]] to bring the [[Church of England]] back to its Catholic roots.  Eventually his studies in history persuaded him to become a Roman Catholic. When John Henry Newman entitled his spiritual autobiography ''[[Apologia Pro Vita Sua]]'' in 1864, he was playing upon both this connotation, and the more commonly understood meaning of an expression of contrition or regret.

Christian apologists employ a variety of philosophical and formal approaches, including [[Ontological argument|ontological]], [[Cosmological argument|cosmological]], and [[teleological argument]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bethinking.org/apologetics/an-introduction-to-christian-apologetics?Strongs=G627|title=An Introduction to Christian Apologetics|last=Coulter|first=Paul|date=|website=Bethinking|publisher=|access-date=21 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Christian presuppositionalist approach to apologetics utilizes the [[transcendental argument for the existence of God]].&lt;ref&gt;Apologetics: A Justification of Christian Belief
John Frame-Joseph Torres - P&amp;R Publishing - 2015 p. 67f&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tertullian]] was a notable early [[Christian]] apologist. He was born, lived and died in [[Carthage]]. He is sometimes known as the "Father of the [[Latin Church]]". He introduced the term ''[[Trinity]]'' ([[Latin]] ''trinitas'') to the Christian vocabulary&lt;ref&gt;''A History of Christian Thought'', [[Paul Tillich]], Touchstone Books, 1972. {{ISBN|0-671-21426-8}} (p. 43)&lt;/ref&gt; and also probably{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} the formula "three Persons, one Substance" as the Latin "tres [[Persona]]e, [[Consubstantial|una Substantia]]" (itself from the [[Koine Greek]] "treis [[Hypostasis (religion)|Hypostaseis]], [[Ousios|Homoousios]]"), and also the terms ''Vetus Testamentum'' ([[Old Testament]]) and ''Novum Testamentum'' ([[New Testament]]).

====Mormonism====
{{further information|Mormon studies#Apologetics}}
There are notable Latter-day Saint apologists who focus on the defense of [[Mormonism]], including early church leaders such as [[Parley P. Pratt]], [[John Taylor (1808-1887)|John Taylor]], [[B.&amp;nbsp;H. Roberts]], [[James E. Talmage]] and more modern figures such as [[Hugh Nibley]], [[Orson Scott Card]], and [[Jeff Lindsay (engineer)|Jeff Lindsay]].

Several well-known Mormon apologetic organizations, such as the [[Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies]] (a group of scholars at [[Brigham Young University]]) and [[FairMormon]] (an independent, Mormon-run, not-for-profit group), have been formed to defend the doctrines and history of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]] in general and [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] in particular.

=== Deism ===
[[Deism]] is a form of [[theism]] in which God created the universe and established rationally comprehensible moral and natural laws but no longer intervenes in human affairs. Deism is a [[natural religion]] where belief in God is based on application of reason and evidence observed in the designs and laws found in nature.&lt;sup&gt;[[Criticism of atheism#cite note-12|[12]]]&lt;/sup&gt;  The World Order of Deists maintains a web site presenting deist apologetics that demonstrate the existence of God based on evidence and reason, absent divine revelation.

===Hinduism===
Hindu apologetics began developing during the British colonial period.  A number of Indian intellectuals had become critical of the British tendency to devalue the Hindu religious tradition. As a result, these Indian intellectuals, as well as a handful of British [[Indology|Indologists]], were galvanized to examine the roots of the religion as well as to study its vast arcana and corpus in an analytical fashion. This endeavor drove the deciphering and preservation of [[Sanskrit]]. Many translations of Hindu texts were produced which made them accessible to a broader reading audience.

A range of Indian philosophers, including [[Swami Vivekananda]] and [[Aurobindo Ghose]], have written rational explanations regarding the values of the Hindu religious tradition. More modern proponents such as the [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]] have also tried to correlate recent developments from [[quantum physics]] and [[consciousness]] research with Hindu concepts. The late Reverend [[Pandurang Shastri Athavale]] has given a plethora of discourses regarding the symbolism and rational basis for many principles in the [[Veda|Vedic tradition]]. In his book ''The Cradle of Civilization'', David Frawley, an American who has embraced the Vedic tradition, has characterized the ancient texts of the Hindu heritage as being like "pyramids of the spirit". [[A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada]] translated over sixty volumes of classic Vedic scriptures including the biography and conclusions of the famous 16th century bhakti scholar [[Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]]; many of these translations and commentaries have been further translated into as many as eighty languages, producing over half a billion books distributed throughout the world. Such individuals have tried to construct an intellectual defense of [[Hinduism]] during a phase when the [[Fundamentalism|fundamentalistic]] elements of other faiths have sought to denigrate the ancient religion in an effort to gain converts.

===Islam===
''Ilm al-Kalām'', literally "science of discourse",&lt;ref name="Wolfson"&gt;Winter, Tim J. "Introduction." Introduction. The Cambridge Companion to Classical Islamic Theology. Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 2008. 4–5.

===Judaism===
{{See also|Jewish polemics and apologetics in the Middle Ages}}
Jewish apologetic literature can be traced back as far as [[Aristobulus of Paneas]], though some discern it in the works of [[Demetrius the chronographer]] (3rd century BCE) traces of the style of "questions" and "solutions" typical of the genre. Aristobulus was a Jewish philosopher of [[Alexandria]] and the author of an apologetic work addressed to [[Ptolemy VI Philometor]]. [[Josephus]]'s [[Contra Apion]] is a wide-ranging defense of [[Judaism]] against many charges laid against Judaism at that time, as too are some of the works of [[Philo of Alexandria]].&lt;ref&gt;John Granger Cook (2000) ''The Interpretation of the New Testament in Greco-Roman paganism'' p.4., Mohr Siebeck Verlag, Tuebingen, Germany&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/1651-apologists|title=APOLOGISTS|work=Jewish Encyclopedia|year=1906}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pantheism===
Some pantheists have formed organizations such as the [[World Pantheist Movement]] and the [[Universal Pantheist Society]] to promote and defend the belief in [[pantheism]].&lt;ref name=Credo&gt;{{cite web|title=The Pantheist Credo|url=http://www.pantheism.net/manifest.htm|publisher=World Pantheist Movement}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In literature ==
Plato's ''Apology'' may be read as both a religious and literary apology; however, more specifically literary examples may be found in the [[preface]]s and [[dedication]]s, which proceed many [[Early modern period|Early Modern]] plays, novels, and poems. Eighteenth century authors such as [[Colley Cibber]], [[Frances Burney]], and [[William Congreve]], to name but a few, prefaced the majority of their poetic work with such apologies. In addition to the desire to defend their work, the apologetic preface often suggests the author's attempt to humble his- or herself before the audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/30105/apology|title=Apology|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|work=Britannica Academic Edition|accessdate=14 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Beyond: Two Souls''''' is an [[Interactive movie|interactive drama]] and [[action-adventure game]] for the [[PlayStation 3]] and [[PlayStation 4]] home video game consoles, developed by [[Quantic Dream]] and published by [[Sony Interactive Entertainment|Sony Computer Entertainment]]. It was released in October 2013. The [[single-player video game|game]] features Jodie Holmes, one of two [[player character]]s. The other is an [[incorporeality|incorporeal]] entity named Aiden: a separate soul linked to Jodie since birth. Jodie, who is portrayed by actress [[Ellen Page]], possesses supernatural powers through her psychic link to Aiden, growing from adolescence to adulthood while learning to control Aiden and the powers they share. [[Willem Dafoe]] co-stars as Nathan Dawkins, a researcher in the Department of Paranormal Activity and Jodie's surrogate-father-figure. The actors in the game worked during the year-long project in Quantic Dream's Paris studio to perform on-set [[voice acting]] and [[motion-capture acting]].

Despite being a video game, ''Beyond: Two Souls'' premiered at the 2013 [[Tribeca Film Festival]], marking only the second time the film festival recognised a video game. [[David Cage]], writer and director of the game, explained that game development studios should provide "[[interactive storytelling]]" that can be played by everyone, including non-gamers. The game received polarised critical reception upon its release. Sales reached over one million copies two months after its worldwide release by the end of 2013. Two years later, a PlayStation 4 version was released, both as a standalone title and then in the ''Quantic Dream Collection'' with the 2010 title ''[[Heavy Rain]]''.

== Gameplay ==
''Beyond: Two Souls'' is an [[Interactive movie|interactive drama]] and [[action-adventure game]], requiring the player to move and guide the character into interactions with objects and other [[non-player character]]s in the scene to progress the story. The player primarily controls Jodie through the in-game environments. At almost any time, however, the player (or second player during a [[two-player video game|two-player game]]) can switch to control Aiden instead. Aiden, as an [[incorporeality|incorporeal]] entity, exists permanently in [[noclip mode]] and can move through walls, ceilings, and other obstacles; however, he is limited to moving only within a certain radius around Jodie due to their spiritual tethering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title='Beyond: Two Souls' a solid tale bogged down by gameplay |last=Bowers |first=Brian |date=10 October 2013 |work=[[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]] |url=http://www.stripes.com/military-life/beyond-two-souls-a-solid-tale-bogged-down-by-gameplay-1.246432 |accessdate=25 January 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014040434/http://www.stripes.com/military-life/beyond-two-souls-a-solid-tale-bogged-down-by-gameplay-1.246432 |archivedate=14 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While playing as Jodie, the [[game mechanics|game]] includes interactive objects marked with a white dot, which can be interacted with by tilting the [[game controller|controller]] stick in its direction. If Jodie must perform a specific action, [[Icon (computing)|icon]]s pop up on the screen to prompt the player to press and/or hold certain controller buttons. Conversation prompts float in the air, defaulting to a certain choice if too much time passes before selection. During action sequences, like chases or hand-to-hand [[fighting game|combat]], the cinematography moves into [[slow motion]] whilst Jodie performs the physical manoeuvre; during this time, the player must determine the direction Jodie is moving and push the controller stick in that direction to complete the action. Other sequences require real-time [[stealth game|stealth]], which has the player sneak Jodie through environments while coordinating certain actions with Aiden. Failing certain action sequences will alter the course of a chapter (and sometimes later chapters) and in some cases lead to the death of a non-playable character.&lt;ref name="David Cage Gameplay"&gt;{{cite web |title=Beyond: Two Souls – Gameplay from E3 2013 |last=Cage |first=David |date=11 June 2013 |work=[[PlayStation Blog]] |publisher=[[Sony Interactive Entertainment]] |url=http://blog.us.playstation.com/2013/06/11/beyond-two-souls-gameplay-from-e3-2013/ |accessdate=25 January 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304085421/http://blog.us.playstation.com/2013/06/11/beyond-two-souls-gameplay-from-e3-2013/ |archivedate=4 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TrustedReviews Gameplay"&gt;{{cite web |title=Beyond: Two Souls review – Gameplay |last=Andrews |first=Stuart |date=October 2014 |work=Trusted Reviews |url=https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/beyond-two-souls |accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While playing as Aiden, the game becomes [[monochrome|monochromatic]]. Amongst the shades of greys, interactive objects are highlighted by an [[aura (paranormal)|aura]] shining in one of several colours, with the colour of the aura indicating his potential interaction: orange characters can be possessed, red characters strangled, blue objects (or characters with environmental effects) knocked around, and green characters healed. Jodie frequently calls upon Aiden to provide different abilities, such as form a protective shield around her, allow the dead to speak to the living through her, grant her an ability to see events of the recent past, and enable her to heal a character's wounds.&lt;ref name="David Cage Gameplay"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TrustedReviews Gameplay"/&gt;

As the player makes choices throughout the game, the gameplay's plot is revealed. Besides affecting dialogue and story developments, the outcome of entire scenes (and in some cases, the outcome of scenes several chapters later) can be manipulated to a certain extent based on player choices. These choices are typically moral decisions made through Jodie's dialogue options, interventions with various characters, success or failure in her combat scenes, or psychic actions that the player chooses to have Aiden perform.&lt;ref name="GSpot"/&gt; Examples of choice-based outcomes are the chapter titled The Party, where the player is given the choice of unleashing brutal revenge toward a group of bullies or simply running away, and the chapter titled The Embassy, where the player can either engage in psychic information retrieval or can jeopardise the mission by forcing one of the guards to commit suicide. Choices also determine the finale of ''Beyond: Two Souls'', as any number of possible plot endings can be experienced by the player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Player Choice and Branching Narrative in Beyond: Two Souls |last=Boudreaux |first=Brian |date=29 October 2013 |work=Press X To Story |url=http://www.pressxtostory.com/2015/01/player-choice-and-branching-narrative.html |accessdate=25 January 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150115025929/http://www.pressxtostory.com/2015/01/player-choice-and-branching-narrative.html |archivedate=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
:''While the story is told through [[nonlinear narrative]], this summary is given in chronological order.''

Young Jodie Holmes (Caroline Wolfson) lives with her foster parents in a suburban home. Since birth, Jodie has had a psychic connection with a mysterious entity named Aiden, with whom she can communicate and perform telepathic acts, such as possessing people's minds and manipulating certain objects. After an incident with some neighbourhood kids results in Aiden almost killing one of them, Jodie's foster parents seek help to care for her condition, permanently leaving her under the custody of doctors Nathan Dawkins ([[Willem Dafoe]]) and Cole Freeman ([[Kadeem Hardison]]) of the United States Department of Paranormal Activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game |title=Beyond: Two Souls |developer=Quantic Dream |publisher=[[Sony Computer Entertainment]] |date=8 October 2013 |platform=PlayStation 3 |level=My Imaginary Friend, First Interview, First Night, Alone}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the two doctors' care, Jodie slowly learns to control Aiden and the powers they share. During this time, Nathan and Cole are building the condenser, a portal that connects the world of the living with the world of the dead—the Infraworld. One night, Nathan learns that his wife and daughter were killed in a car accident. While trying to comfort him, Jodie discovers that she can channel spirits of the dead from the Infraworld; she helps the spirits speak to the living through a psychic link created by her physical contact. As the years pass, a teenage Jodie ([[Ellen Page]]) seeks her independence, both from the doctors and from Aiden, and tries several times to live a normal life. At each attempt, Aiden intervenes, ending in disaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game |title=Beyond: Two Souls |developer=Quantic Dream |publisher=[[Sony Computer Entertainment]] |date=8 October 2013 |platform=PlayStation 3 |level=The Experiment, Night Session, Hauntings, The Party, Like Other Girls}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At one point, Nathan asks for Jodie's help with the condenser, which has broken open. After braving hostile entities from the Infraworld, Jodie manages to shut down the condenser and warns Nathan not to build another. This gets the attention of the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]], who send agent Ryan Clayton ([[Eric Winter]]) to forcibly recruit Jodie. After training, the now-adult Jodie goes on multiple missions as a field agent, often with Ryan, to whom she slowly becomes attracted. On one such mission in Somalia, Jodie learns that the target she killed was not a warlord, but the country's benign president. An enraged Jodie flees in disgust, despite Ryan's pleas. Branded a traitor, Jodie becomes a fugitive, evading pursuing CIA forces. Along the way, she befriends a small group of homeless people, one of whom she helps give birth to a girl named Zoey, and she lives with a family of Native Americans, during which she encounters another love interest named Jay and saves them from a malevolent entity. The CIA eventually recaptures Jodie after she attempts to reconnect with her catatonic biological mother, who has been held and forcibly drugged for decades in a military hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game |title=Beyond: Two Souls |developer=Quantic Dream |publisher=[[Sony Computer Entertainment]] |date=8 October 2013 |platform=PlayStation 3 |level=The Condenser, Separation, Welcome to the CIA, The Embassy, The Dinner, The Mission, Hunted, Homeless, Broken, Navajo, Old Friends, Nora}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CIA hands Jodie over to Nathan, now executive director of the DPA, overseeing the DPA's newest condenser, code-named the Black Sun. He reveals that the CIA is willing to let Jodie go if she agrees to a final mission. Jodie and a CIA team led by Ryan destroy an underwater facility housing a Chinese-developed condenser before it is used to attack the United States. Jodie then learns that Nathan built a miniature condenser to speak exclusively to his family, but without success. After showing Nathan that his refusal to let them go is only making them suffer, Jodie tries to leave, only to be held in captivity by the CIA—the organisation has deemed her too dangerous to be freed. Jodie is subjected to the same fate as her mother. Nathan appears and informs Jodie that he's decided to shut down the containment field to the Black Sun, merging the two worlds together and making death meaningless. Too weak to free Jodie, Aiden contacts Ryan and Cole, leading them to her. After Nathan shuts down the containment field, the three chase after him into the heart of the Black Sun, with the intent of destroying it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game |title=Beyond: Two Souls |developer=Quantic Dream |publisher=[[Sony Computer Entertainment]] |date=8 October 2013 |platform=PlayStation 3 |level=Briefing, Dragon's Hideout, Black Sun}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the trek towards the Black Sun, Cole is injured by entities and Ryan sacrifices his own safety to keep Jodie alive. Eventually, Jodie confronts Nathan near the Black Sun. He commits suicide to reunite with his family. As Jodie shuts down the condenser, she has a vision—Aiden is her stillborn twin brother. Jodie must make a choice: go back to the world of the living, or go on to the Infraworld and be reunited with everyone she has lost. If Jodie chooses Life, her connection to Aiden is severed and she is no longer useful to the CIA. Jodie must choose how to live her life, either alone or with Ryan, Jay, or Zoey and her family. If Jodie chooses Beyond, she joins Aiden and other lost ones in the Infraworld, dying in the process. She continues to watch over those who remain in the living world, warning the now-teenage Zoey of the coming danger. By the story's end, the Infraworld has become a widespread threat in the not-so-distant future. Jodie prepares to confront the threat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game |title=Beyond: Two Souls |developer=Quantic Dream |publisher=[[Sony Computer Entertainment]] |date=8 October 2013 |platform=PlayStation 3 |level=Black Sun, Epilogue}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Cage]], founder and CEO of [[Quantic Dream]], announced ''Beyond: Two Souls'' at [[Sony Interactive Entertainment|Sony]]'s press conference during the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2012]].

On 5 September 2013, the [[PlayStation Blog]] announced that a [[game demo|demo]] for ''Beyond: Two Souls'' would be released 1 October 2013 in the United States, 2 October for Europe, and 3 October for Japan, about a week prior to the full game's worldwide release. Despite the demo's official release date, a few users of the paid subscription service [[PlayStation Plus]] were allowed to receive the demo a week earlier, on 24 September 2013. [[GameStop]] also gave out a limited number of [[Software release life cycle#Beta|beta]] keys on that day.&lt;ref name="blog.us.playstation.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Makuch |first=Eddie |url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/gamestop-now-offering-beyond-two-souls-beta-keys/1100-6414918/ |title=GameStop now offering Beyond: Two Souls beta keys |work=[[GameSpot]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |date=24 September 2013 |accessdate=25 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The full game was released on 8 October 2013 in North America, 9 October 2013 in Europe, Australia and New Zealand, and 11 October 2013 in the UK.&lt;ref name=blog&gt;{{cite web |title=Willem Dafoe, Ellen Page Star in Beyond: Two Souls October 8 |work=[[PlayStation Blog]] |publisher=[[Sony Interactive Entertainment]] |last=Osgood |first=Derek |date=1 March 2013 |url=http://blog.us.playstation.com/2013/03/01/willem-dafoe-ellen-page-star-in-beyond-two-souls-october-8th/ |accessdate=25 June 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523070057/http://blog.us.playstation.com/2013/03/01/willem-dafoe-ellen-page-star-in-beyond-two-souls-october-8th/ |archivedate=23 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AUSreleasedate&gt;{{cite web |url=https://progressbar.com.au/news/beyond-two-souls-release-date-announced/ |title=Beyond: Two Souls Release Date Announced |publisher=Progress Bar |last=Roberts |first=Brendan |date=4 June 2013 |accessdate=27 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=VG247releasedate&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.vg247.com/2013/10/08/beyond-two-souls-reviews-for-quantic-dreams-latest-arrive-get-all-the-scores-here/ |title=Beyond: Two Souls - reviews for Quantic Dream's latest arrive, get all the scores here |publisher=[[VG247]] |last=Nunneley |first=Stephany |date=8 October 2013 |accessdate=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IGNreleasedate&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/09/25/gamestop-is-shouting-fans-a-beyond-two-souls-demo-code |title=GameStop is Shouting Fans a Beyond: Two Souls Demo Code |work=[[IGN]] |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |last=O'Brien |first=Lucy |date=24 September 2013 |accessdate=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The European version of the game is censored to keep the [[PEGI]] rating at 16 instead of 18. Two changes were made amounting to 5–10 seconds of gameplay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-10-01-sony-confirms-beyond-censored-in-europe |title=Sony confirms Beyond censored in Europe |last=Yin-Poole |first=Wesley |date=1 October 2013 |work=[[Eurogamer]] |publisher=Gamer Network |accessdate=1 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Immediately after the game was released, nude images of Jodie, actress Ellen Page, surfaced on the [[Reddit]] online community. The game did include one nude scene of Jodie—showering, shown at an angle that preserves the character's modesty—however the leaked images were full-frontal. Industry analysts deduced that a person in possession of a developer PlayStation 3 that allowed [[quality assurance]] features such as "free camera" mode had used the special PlayStation to create and upload the images. Sony immediately took steps to remove them, asking for the community's assistance and explaining that the images were of a digital model and not of Page, who has a "no nudity" policy in titles she appears in. The images were removed from the website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.inquisitr.com/1003507/ellen-page-nude-beyond-two-souls-leaked-shower-scene-photos/ |title=Ellen Page Nude in Beyond: Two Souls, Sony Objects To Leaked Shower Scene Photos |date=23 October 2013 |work=[[Inquisitr]] |accessdate=28 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2015, Quantic Dream announced a PlayStation 4 version of ''Beyond: Two Souls'' for North America, Europe, and the PAL region alongside ''Heavy Rain''. The PlayStation 4 version of ''Beyond: Two Souls'' was released on 24 November, with the remaster of ''Heavy Rain'' following on 1 March 2016.

While ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' praised the visuals, the performances, and the "bold, genre-defying design work", it expressed disappointment in Quantic Dream; respecting its years of "audacity" pushing the boundaries of the game medium, yet ultimately failing to listen to feedback and instead delivering yet "another flawed experiment—better in some ways, worse in others".&lt;ref name="EGM"/&gt; ''[[IGN]]'' gaming website criticised the game for offering a gaming experience too passive and unrewarding: "It is unwise to build up our expectations of being able to choose our actions and then take that away from us where it feels most important" and a muddy and unfocused interactive drama "to make gamers conditioned to meaningless violence feel something".&lt;ref name="IGN2"/&gt; ''[[Joystiq]]'' criticised the game's lack of solid character interaction and its unbelievable, unintentionally silly plot.&lt;ref name="Joystiq"/&gt; ''[[Destructoid]]'' criticised the game's thin character presentation and frequent narrative dead ends, as well as its lack of meaningful interactivity.&lt;ref name="Destructoid"/&gt; The editor of ''[[Eurogamer]]'' took issue with the "gruelling, sentimental" game being "all story", comparing it to other games that "give the player complete control", observing the triviality of the player choices may modify the tone of each self-contained chapter, but the overall story is "going wherever it's going".&lt;ref name="EuroG"/&gt; ''[[GamesRadar+]]'' liked the game, but warned "you'll never be truly challenged by the gameplay".&lt;ref name="GRadar"/&gt; Entertainer [[Ben "Yahtzee" Croshaw]] of ''[[Zero Punctuation]]'' was heavily critical of the game, focusing on the overuse of quick time events, the underuse of the game's central stealth mechanics, and the inconsistent tone and atmosphere, comparing playing the game to "watching any normal film and pressing the pause button every two seconds".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/8298-Beyond-Two-Souls |title=Beyond: Two Souls |last=Croshaw |first=Ben |date=23 October 2013 |work=[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]] |accessdate=8 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legacy ===
In November 2014, David Cage discussed the future of video games and referred to the generally negative reviews ''Beyond'' received from [[Gamer#Hardcore gamer|hardcore gamer]]s. "There will always be games for the hardcore gamers who see games as a skill-based sport, or as a way to compete with their friends", he said. He also referred to [[casual game]]rs who play games "as a mere hobby, like many titles for smartphones". He then stated, "We try to develop a middle way, with games that try to tell a story, to carry meaning, and where violence isn't the core activity. Most of all, we try to create an emotion, to make players live something strong and unique, which remains an ambitious challenge in a video game."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Riaz |first=Adnan |url=http://www.gamerheadlines.com/2014/11/david-cage-working-something-exciting/ |title=David Cage: "We're Working on Something Very Exciting" |publisher=Gamer Headlines |date=28 November 2014 |accessdate=28 January 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170628150039/http://www.gamerheadlines.com/2014/11/david-cage-working-something-exciting/ |archivedate=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3416">The "Biennale Internationale des Arts du Cirque" is the largest contemporary circus festival in the world and is held in the south of France every two years. The Biennale is organised by the [[Archaos]] circus company and the first edition in 2015 attracted 60 circus companies from around the world and had more than 85,000 visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lci.fr/france/marseille-capitale-internationale-du-cirque-1518985.html|title=Marseille, capitale internationale du cirque|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The Archaos circus company is one of the legendary contemporary circus companies in Europe. Their work in Britain changed the way the circus was seen and the founder of Archaos, [[Pierrot Bidon]], was seen as a circus revolutionary. In Bidon's obituary in [[The Guardian]], Archaos was described as "one of the ensembles that galvanised the new circus movement, in which traditional arts have been re-imagined and combined with contemporary artistic sensibilities and theatrical techniques."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2010/mar/21/pierrot-bidon-obituary|title=Pierrot Bidon obituary|first=Mark|last=Borkowski|date=21 March 2010|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Biennale itself was born out of the Circus in Capitals project that Archaos managed as part of [[Marseille-Provence 2013]], the European Capital of Culture festivities. The success of the circus arts during the Marseille Provence 2013 inspired the Archaos company to create the first Biennale Internationale des Arts du Cirque in 2015. The first biennale featured circus companies such as [[Nofit State Circus]], [[Cirque Éloize]], and the [[Chinese State Circus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lamarseillaise.fr/culture/danse/35292-la-grande-parade-du-cirque|title=La grande parade de la Biennale des arts du cirque - Journal La Marseillaise|first=Catherine|last=Walgenwitz|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Biennale was such a success that in 2016 the company created the L'Entre–Deux Biennales to meet public demand and continue to foster the circus arts in years when the Biennale was not being held. Archaos was nominated for the Best Producer award for the L'Entre-Deux Biennales project at the 2016 Annual International Professional Circus Awards in Sochi, Russia that were organised by the Russian Ministry of Culture. Archaos was also chosen to present performances at the Club France that was held during the Rio Olympics in August 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telerama.fr/monde/a-rio-les-pays-soignent-leurs-facades-dans-leurs-maisons-olympiques,146115.php|title=A Rio, les pays soignent leurs façades dans leurs maisons olympiques|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2017 Biennale==

The second edition of the Biennale ran from January 21 to February 19, 2017. It featured more than 260 performances in close to 30 cities in the south of France including [[Marseille]], [[Aix-en-Provence]], [[Grasse]], and [[Gap, Hautes-Alpes|Gap]]. The 2017 Biennale included new work from leading British companies NoFit State Circus and [[Motionhouse]], the Swedish company [[Cirkus Cirkör]], and the Brazilian company Borogodo. More than 120,000 people attended events.

'''Charles B. K. Beachcroft''' (born '''Charles Beachcroft Kay''', 1870 &amp;ndash; 1 July 1928) was the captain of the gold-medal-winning Great Britain [[cricket]] team at the [[1900 Summer Olympics]], the only time cricket has been an Olympic sport.&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;{{cite web|title=Charles Beachcroft|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/be/charles-beachcroft-1.html|website=Olympics at Sports-Reference.com|accessdate=11 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Beachcroft was the son of a vicar, John Lowder Kay. He was born in [[Rickmansworth]], [[Hertfordshire]]. His father died in 1877 and Charles and his mother moved to Devon. He grew up to become a county level player in rugby, hockey and cricket, introduced the game of ping-pong to the county, and also competed in shooting. He played as opening bat for Exeter and various other local cricket teams, including Starcross. He married a local girl in 1889 and had four children before being arrested for abduction of a 17-year-old girl and living in London under the name of Charles Beachy Kay Beachcroft. The following year he married this girl, returned to Devon and took on the license of the Royal Hotel, Dawlish, under the name of C. B. Kay Beachcroft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GB Olympic Champions 1896-2014 - Cricket|url=http://gbolympics.co.uk/cricket.html#beachcroft|website=gbolympics.co.uk|accessdate=11 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1901 census his occupation is listed as a licensed victualler. His biography (''One of Life's Great Charmers: A Biography of Charles Kay'') shows that he was later declared bankrupt. In 1905, under the name of Charles Kay, he joined the stage and became a variety artist, humorist, comedian, actor, pantomime villain and touring theatre company manager, touring [[Stoll Moss]] theatres throughout England and Scotland over 16 years with different stage assistants/partners (Sybil Franklin, Lola Trent and Sadie Logan) and fathering a total of 13 children. He emigrated to Australia in 1921 and toured theatres in Australia and New Zealand until his death in Melbourne in 1928.&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt;

==Athletic career==

==Plot==

''CTU: Marine Sharpshooter''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s story details the adventures of [[Lieutenant]] Smith and [[Sergeant]] Cooper, a [[United States Marine Corps|US Marine Corps]] [[Scout Sniper|scout sniper]], team as they chase down some warlords in Afghanistan and follow the trail of lost nuclear materials. The player assumes the role of the [[sniper]], as you take on an army of terrorists and mercenaries in order to prevent [[nuclear holocaust]].

==Gameplay==

''CTU: Marine Sharpshooter''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s gameplay involves both sniping and [[close combat]]. The main shooting mechanic is sniping, with the ability to use the sniper rifle's scope to zoom in on far away targets. Close combat is done with a pistol with an optional [[Suppressor|silencer]], or a knife. Several points in the game require the player to stay in one spot engaging hostiles that emerge from various doorways and windows. At other times, the player can explore the map freely. The game features simulations of the [[sniper rifles]] used by the US Marine Corps [[snipers]], as well as other real weapons, such as [[assault rifles]], [[pistols]], and [[sniper rifles]]. There is even the occasional [[Rocket-propelled grenade|RPG]] used by the enemy.

The game's environment varies from the caves and small villages of [[Afghanistan]], to the snowy cliffs and rooftops of [[Chechnya]], to sandy beaches and jungles of Pacific island. Interaction between player and environment is minimal.

The game features a semi-intelligent spotter, who can be set to follow you or hold position, and "hold fire" or "fire at will". The spotter call out the compass heading of the direction that enemies are in as they come within a certain range. The spotter can also assist the player in engaging enemies. You fail a mission if the spotter dies or if you die.

The game features a few first-aid kits as standard inventory, which will patch you up a little after taking hits. Your spotter has his own kits, and he will use them during lulls in fighting. You cannot patch him up, nor vice versa. There are also no further kits or ammunition available within the mission. However, small quantities of ammunition can be obtained from the sniper rifles you pick up from dead enemies.

'''''Chuck Norris: Bring on the Pain''''' is a [[2008 in video gaming|2008]] [[mobile game]] produced by [[Gameloft]], based on the popularity of film actor [[Chuck Norris]] developed on the internet with the [[Chuck Norris facts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2008/07/17/gameloft-releases-chuck-norris-bring-on-the-pain|title=Gameloft Releases Chuck Norris: Bring on the Pain|last=Staff|first=I. G. N.|date=2008-07-17|website=IGN|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The player takes control of [[Chuck Norris]] himself. The game is a [[side-scrolling]] [[beat 'em up]].

==Plot==
''Chuck Norris: Bring on the Pain!'' is a tongue in cheek tribute to the actor. The game takes place in a day's work for Chuck as he rescues POWs from Cambodia and fights off Communist invaders in the USA. The game is littered with [[Chuck Norris facts]] and incorporates a number of these into the gameplay; such as shooting down a helicopter by pointing his finger and yelling BANG! &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.appspy.com/review/3651/chuck-norris-bring-on-the-pain-review|title=Chuck Norris: Bring on the Pain!

==Gameplay==
Players use the on-screen joystick to move Chuck and the punch button to attack. Like other side scrolling beat 'em ups, you can utilize the environment around you, picking up different objects, such as cars, to use against the enemy. Later in the game, you'll begin to unlock combos and special moves which you can link together for some devastating attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.appspy.com/review/3651/chuck-norris-bring-on-the-pain-review|title=Chuck Norris: Bring on the Pain!

==Platforms==
''Chuck Norris: Bring On the Pain'' is a [[video game]] released for [[mobile devices]] such as BlackBerry, HTC, LG, Motorola, Nokia, Pantech, Samsung, and Sony Ericsson.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

==Reception==
Damian Chiappara of APPSPY gave it a score of 4/5 stating: "The game has a wicked sense of humour and a ton of references that Chuck Norris fans will love. The visuals themselves are very smooth and look great, but the game also features a fun camera function to post your face onto the enemy trooper's body... ''Chuck Norris: Bring on the Pain'', is a tongue in cheek tribute to the legend himself while maintaining some solid side-scrolling beat 'em up gameplay."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.appspy.com/review/3651/chuck-norris-bring-on-the-pain-review|title=Chuck Norris: Bring on the Pain! Review|work=appspy.com|access-date=2018-03-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Andrew Williams of Know Your Mobile wrote: "The game is great fun purely from a gameplay perspective, with its frequent seamless mini game interludes offering a break from the action. However, the humour of ''Chuck Norris: Bring on the Pain'' is a huge part of the game's appeal."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.knowyourmobile.com/games/5746/chuck-norris-bring-pain-review|title=Chuck Norris: Bring on the Pain review|work=Know Your Mobile|access-date=2018-03-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meghann Myers of PCWORLD wrote: "''Chuck Norris: Bring on the Pain'' is not only uncomplicated to play but perfectly ridiculous in its campiness. At $1, the game is cheap, fun, and an extraordinary time-waster. Money well spent for the Chuck Norris enthusiast, or anyone looking for a good laugh."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/183784/article.html|title=Chuck Norris: Bring on the Pain for IPhone|website=PCWorld|language=en|access-date=2018-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2489">A '''conditional joke''' is a [[joke]] meant for a qualified audience only, possessing prior knowledge and understanding of the topic, which in turn enables them to understand the joke. Such ability is also called the prerequisite condition for laughter. The conditional joke is one of two main categories of jokes, according to Ted Cohen; the main one being a universal joke, which does not require familiarity with the hermetic language of a conditional joke.&lt;ref name="Cohen"&gt;{{cite book |author=Ted Cohen|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=eIPSME0a35QC&amp;q=Conditional |title=Jokes: Philosophical Thoughts on Joking Matters |page=12, 21 |year=1999 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |ISBN=0-226-11230-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conditional, or ''hermetic'' jokes, often depend on the internalized negative stereotypes held by the audience toward a targeted group of people. Such affective disposition can also explain the persistence of [[ethnic jokes]] in multicultural societies. Although they can be understood by many, the conditional jokes usually don't make ridiculed individuals [[laugh]] at the [[punch line]].&lt;ref name="Cohen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Capps"&gt;{{cite book |author=Donald Capps |title=A Time to Laugh: The Religion of Humor |pages=67–69 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=eqDnRRdF53QC&amp;q=conditional |publisher=A&amp;C Black |year=2006 |ISBN=0826418570}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common type of conditional jokes, which target the jargon and all topics specific to professions and occupations, include the doctor jokes (surgeons, internists, psychiatrists, etc.), the lawyers and politicians, musicians, and the rabbi jokes among many. Other ''hermetic'' jokes which target ethnicity include [[Polish joke]]s made in the US, [[Irish jokes]] made in England, Ukrainian jokes made in Russia, [[Newfie]] jokes made in Canada, [[Sardarji joke]]s made in India, [[Russian jokes]] about ethnicities, Texas jokes, Jewish jokes made by non-Jews, the Black people jokes, and numerous others.&lt;ref name="Cohen78"&gt;{{cite book |author=Ted Cohen |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=ogEPRnVpx4wC&amp;q=negative+beliefs |title=Jokes: Philosophical Thoughts on Joking Matters |page=78 |year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1819">'''Dallas Barr''' is a [[comic book]] series (or "[[graphic novel]]") by [[Belgium|Belgian]] artist [[Marvano]] (Mark van Oppen) adapted from [[United States of America|American]] [[science fiction]] author [[Joe Haldeman]]'s 1989 novel ''Buying Time''. The protagonist, Dallas Barr, is 132 years old. The series takes place around 2075, in a world where a prolonged life is available to the ultrarich through the Stileman Procedure, where the moon is a colony and AIDS-X is rampant. The series ran from 1996 to 2005.

Although the first comic in the series clearly draws on Joe Haldeman's ''Buying Time'' ( UK title: ''The Long Habit of Living''), the plots of the following volumes continue beyond the end of the original novel. The plots of the continuation were written by Haldeman in English, translated into French by Marvano. The later volumes are written by Marvano alone, as Haldeman found him to do a good job. In the series the author challenges the reader to reflect on the issues at hand. Politics, philosophy and humanity's stupidity are often given a chance in this series. Over the years, the plot got more complicated and the characters came to their full potential, while at the same time its philosophical considerations deepened.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2466">The '''Film Quota Act''', full title the '''New South Wales Cinematograph Films (Australian Quota) Act''' was an act of legislation passed in September 1935 that came into force on 1 January 1936. Under the Act it was compulsory that in the first year of operation 5 per cent, of the films distributed in New South Wales must be Australian productions, the percentage to increase yearly for five years when it becomes 15 per cent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article17321184 |title=Advertising. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=27 May 1936 |accessdate=12 August 2012 |page=15 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act was introduced at the behest of New South Wales' Premier [[Bertram Stevens (politician)|Bertram Stevens]]. Its ultimate impact turned out to be limited due to a loophole in the legislation. The use of the word "acquire" meant it was considered that the act was drafted to reflect exhibition of films, not ensure production; distributors argued they had no obligation to produce movies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article17292728 |title=FILM QUOTA. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=30 December 1936 |accessdate=12 August 2012 |page=7 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some American distributors made veiled threats to remove Hollywood films from exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article27986942 |title=THE FILM QUOTA. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=1 April 1937 |accessdate=12 August 2012 |page=8 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://lantern.mediahist.org/catalog/variety117-1935-03_0140]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1937 the New South Wales government decided not to force distributors to participate in production. Similar legislation was passed in Victoria but was never proclaimed. By the end of the decade the quota law had ceased to operate in practice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://afcarchive.screenaustralia.gov.au/downloads/policies/early%20history_final1.pdf Early history of Australian Film, ''Screen Australia''] accessed 24 August 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Frank Dumont''' (January 25, 1848 – March 17, 1919) was an [[United States|American]] [[minstrel show]] performer and manager.&lt;ref name="monarch1"&gt;Rice, Edward Le Roy. [https://books.google.com/books?id=nvY5AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA198&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Monarchs of minstrelsy, from "Daddy" Rice to date], p. 198 (1911)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="findingaid"&gt;[http://www.hsp.org/sites/www.hsp.org/files/migrated/findingaid3054dumont.pdf Finding Aid: Collection 3054 - Frank Dumont (1848-1919) - Minstrelsy Scrapbook], by the [[Historical Society of Pennsylvania]] (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="obit1"&gt;(17 March 1919).

==Life==
Dumont was born in [[Utica, New York]] on January 25, 1848.  He started performing in minstrel shows as early as 1862, and worked with a number of groups, including [[Duprez &amp; Benedict's Minstrels]] from about 1869 to 1881.  He eventually founded "Dumont's Minstrels", around 1895/96, after purchasing the Eleventh Street Opera House in Philadelphia.  He authored many sketches and songs for the genre.  One [[afterpiece]] he wrote was later expanded into a successful 1884 play, ''[[A Parlor Match]]''.

After the Opera House closed circa 1909, Dumont acquired Dime Museum at Ninth and Arch Streets and renamed it "Dumont's Theatre".&lt;ref name="another"&gt;[http://www.ulib.niu.edu/badndp/dumont_frank.html Frank Dumont], Northern Illinois University Libraries -- House of Beadle &amp; Adams Online -- The Authors and Their Novels, Retrieved November 3, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  He died in the box office of the theatre on March 17, 1919 during the opening number of that afternoon's matinee show.&lt;ref name="obit1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="widowobit"&gt;(26 May 1939) [https://www.nytimes.com/1939/05/26/archives/obituary-1-no-title.html Mrs. Frank Dumont (obituary)], ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dimeburns"&gt;(26 February 1929). [https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=OChaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=5ksNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1300,5133242&amp;dq= Noted Shrine of Minstrelsy Ends Career], ''Providence News'' (noting fire that burned down Dumont's Theatre, 1929)&lt;/ref&gt;

Dumont's 1899 work "The Witmark amateur minstrel guide and burnt cork encyclopedia" is a valuable resource on the history of American minstrelsy. [[Image:Frank Dumont 1899.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Dumont, from ''The Witmark amateur minstrel guide and burnt cork encyclopedia'' (1899)]]

Dumont wrote in 1915 that he had been the first to perform two classic 19th century standards, "[[Silver Threads Among the Gold]]", and "[[When You and I Were Young, Maggie]]".&lt;ref name="cir1"&gt;Dumont, Frank (27 March 1915). [http://www.circushistory.org/Cork/BurntCork6.htm The Younger Generation in Minstrelsy and Reminiscences of the Past], ''[[New York Clipper]]'' ("Dumont was the first to sing "Silver Threads Among the Gold," for whom it was written by H. P. Danks. He also first introduced "When You and I Were Young, Maggie" as the Duprez &amp; Benedict’s Minstrels programs, dated, will show and the still living members of that celebrated troupe remember well.")&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pat Chappelle]] commissioned Dumont in 1900 to write ''A Rabbit's Foot'', a comedy-based show that became a hit and led to the creation of Chappelle's "[[Rabbit's Foot Company|Rabbit's Foot (Comedy) Company]]."&lt;ref&gt;"Rabbit's Foot Comedy Company; T. G. Williams; William Mosely; Ross Jackson; Sam Catlett; Mr. Chappelle" News/Opinion, ''The Freeman'' page 6.  October 7, 1905.  Indianapolis, Indiana&lt;/ref&gt; Chappelle was the first black owner of a vaudeville company with an all-black cast, and utilized upscale performers that helped him dominate the southwest and southeastern areas of the U.S. and also traveled to [[New Jersey]], New York, [[Washington, D.C.]], and [[Baltimore]].&lt;ref&gt;"The Stage."

'''Geraldão''' is a character created by Brazilian cartoonist [[Glauco Villas Boas]] &lt;ref&gt;https://www.lambiek.net/artists/g/glauco.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and is the main character of a series of eponymous newspaper [[comic strip]] published since 1981. The character is an unmarried and unemployed middle-aged man who still lives in his mother's house. He is an alcoholic, smoker, sometimes walks naked and fights with his overbearing mother. The humor style of his strips is usually [[black comedy]], and sometimes nonsensical. Being one of the few intended for mature audiences at the time, his comics have become classics.

The character has been published in comic books by various publishers with their characters. The character also received a children's version and without the obscenity, but still nonsensical titled ''Geraldinho''. This spin-off was adapted by [[Tectoy]] for a game for the [[Master System]], being an adaptation of the Japanese game [[Teddy Boy Blues]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/teddy-boy| title=Teddy Boy|work=[[MobyGames]]|language=|accessdate=23 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kitogames.net78.net/artigos/tectoy3.html| title=Tectoy - Os Jogos modificados para o público brasileiro|author=B-Mark|work=site Kito Games|language=Portuguese|accessdate=23 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''I.Sat''' (contraction of the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] phrase ''Imagen Satelital'', which means "[[Satellite]] image") is an [[Argentina|Argentine]] [[cable television]] channel owned by [[Turner Broadcasting System Latin America]] and [[AT&amp;T]]'s [[WarnerMedia]]. It airs movies, series, music and shows focused on people aged 18 to 39. It is headquartered in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]].

It is broadcast on the [[satellite]] [[Intelsat 21]] and is broadcast by most [[cable television]] companies in [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]], [[Bolivia]], [[Chile]], [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], [[Mexico]], [[Panama]], [[Paraguay]], [[Peru]], [[Uruguay]] and [[Venezuela]].

The channel has a dedicated feed for Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay, and until November 2012, a dedicated feed for Brazil, which is now covered by the channel's pan-regional feed.

==History==
Until 2007, the channel was owned by "Claxson Interactive Group Latin America &amp; Iberia" (which was a subsidiary of the Venezuelan-based [[Grupo Cisneros]]) but that year the channel, along with [[Retro (TV channel)|Retro]] and Space, is bought by [[Turner Broadcasting System]]. It aired different programming on different blocks, such as "Primer Plano I.Sat" (foreign movies), "Cine Argentino Independiente" (independent [[Argentina|Argentine]] films), "Asian Connection" ([[Asia]]n films), and "Cortos I-Sat" (short films).

In 2007 it changed its programming from being a 24-hour movies channel to have movies, series, shows, documentary series, music and some others. Some current programming includes ''[[Little Britain]]'', ''[[Raising Hope]]'', ''[[Misfits (TV series)|Misfits]]'', and others.

[[Adult Swim]], which previously aired on [[Cartoon Network (Latin America)|Cartoon Network]], aired every night with adult animation series since 2008 after its cancellation from Cartoon Network; however, the Adult Swim block was cancelled from I.Sat on 2011 due to low ratings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anmtvla.com/2009/11/isat-extinge-adult-swim-para-siempre.html I.Sat extingue Adult Swim para siempre]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.anmtvla.com/2010/11/diciembre-en-isat-ultimo-mes-de-adult.html Diciembre en I.Sat: Último mes de [Adult Swim]&lt;/ref&gt; Adult Swim however returned to I.Sat on April 3, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.anmtvla.com/2015/02/adult-swim-regresa-en-abril-por-isat.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Scarne''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|k|ɑr|n|i}}; March 4, 1903 – July 7, 1985) was an American [[Magic (illusion)|magician]] and book author who was particularly adept at [[playing card]] manipulation. He became known as an expert on cards and other games, and authored a number of popular books on cards, [[gambling]], and related topics.

==Early life==
He was born '''Orlando Carmelo Scarnecchia''' in [[Steubenville, Ohio]] in the United States of America, and at some point [[anglicize]]d his name to '''John Scarne'''.  He grew up in the [[New Jersey]] communities of [[Fairview, Bergen County, New Jersey|Fairview]] and [[Guttenberg, New Jersey|Guttenberg]].&lt;ref name=NYTObit&gt;Cook, John. [https://select.nytimes.com/search/restricted/article?res=F20717F63D5C0C7A8CDDAE0894DD484D81 "JOHN SCARNE, GAMBLING EXPERT"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', July 9, 1985. Accessed January 16, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; When he left school after the eighth grade, he learned from a local [[card sharp]] how to perform such [[confidence trick|swindles]] as [[Three-card Monte|The Three Card Monte]], and how to cheat in [[gamble|gambling]] [[card game]]s by manipulating the cards.&lt;ref name="OddsAgainstMe-3CardMonte"&gt;{{cite book
  | last = Scarne
  | first = John
  | title = The Odds Against Me
  | publisher = Simon &amp; Schuster
  | year = 1966
  | location = New York
  | pages = 20–34 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Scarne began practicing [[sleight of hand]] with the goal of becoming a card sharp, but his [[Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] mother dissuaded her son from gambling in general, and cheating others in particular. She persuaded him to practice magic instead. Scarne soon extended his skill at handling cards to learning—and devising—[[Card magic|magical effects with cards]]. He spent a few months learning about crooked gambling devices (including [[card marking|marked cards]] and [[loaded dice]]) at a nearby novelty store.&lt;ref name="OddsAgainstMe-GamblingDevices"&gt;{{cite book
  | last = Scarne
  | first = John
  | title = The Odds Against Me
  | publisher = Simon &amp; Schuster
  | year = 1966
  | location = New York
  | pages = 40–71 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Thanks to his endless practice, Scarne began making money as a magician.

==Career==
Gradually, Scarne became quite an expert at not only [[Magic (illusion)|magical effects]], but games of all kinds as well.  Articles were written about him in various magazines, and he was hired as a consultant or adviser by various companies, as well as by the US Army, which sent him to bases around the world in order to educate soldiers about the dangers of card and dice cheats. He wrote fifteen books and co-wrote a few more for a total of twenty-eight books on games, such as ''Scarne on Dice'', ''Scarne's Guide to Modern Poker'' and ''Scarne's New Complete Guide to Gambling''.  He also wrote two autobiographies: ''The Amazing World of John Scarne: A Personal History'' (1956), and ''[[The Odds Against Me]]'' (1966). He served as a [[technical advisor]] in the 1973 motion picture, ''[[The Sting]]'', and doubled for actor [[Paul Newman]]'s hands during scenes that involved [[card manipulation]]s and deck switching.

Scarne was often proclaimed by experts, magicians and editors of the time as the greatest card manipulator of all time. But he was happiest when inventing (and marketing, through his company John Scarne Games, Inc.) new games, which he did quite a bit.  And he was especially proud of one called [[Teeko]], which he invented in 1945 (version withdrawn), re-invented in 1952 and modified in the 1960s.  He was so proud of the game that he named his son [[John Teeko Scarne]].  Teeko quickly spread around the world. Even Orson Welles was reported to have been playing Teeko. But he never made a profit on the game mainly due to water damage in the warehouse which eliminated the entire stock in one day. Today Teeko is virtually unknown.&lt;ref name="Eskin"&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A43740-2001Jul10 Eskin, Blake. "A world of games: Cards and gambling authority John Scarne claimed to have invented one of the greatest board games of all time. Was he bluffing?" ''Washington Post'', July 15, 2001, p. W18.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Scarne's most famous card trick was appropriately titled "Scarne's Aces".  The trick involved taking a spectator's shuffled deck of cards, performing a series of riffle shuffles himself and then cutting to all four aces. Another one of Scarne's most notable card effects was the triple coincidence, in which a spectator and a magician each pick three different playing cards out of two regular decks of opposite colors and it is shown that all of the selections match. Scarne also created a quadruple coincidence, wherein a spectator selects a card and four impossible predictions of their card are made.

Scarne also attempted to discredit [[Edward O. Thorp]]'s blackjack [[card counting]] system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In his 1966 autobiography ''The Odds Against Me'', he claimed to analyze Thorp's system and concluded that the whole system was loaded with mathematical errors and it was pure fiction dreamed by Thorp. Scarne also went on to attempt to discredit Wilson's famous blackjack point count system. Scarne offered a challenge to blackjack card counters, but Scarne and the prospective participants were never able to agree upon the terms for the challenge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blackjackhero.com/blackjack/strategy/card-counting/history/thorp-scarne/ The History of Card Counting, John Scarne versus Ed Thorp]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GuideCasinoGambling-challenge"&gt;{{cite book

  | publisher = Simon &amp; Schuster

  | pages = 122–129 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Odds Against Me'', Scarne described his own technique for counting down up to four-deck blackjack with the rules generally used in Las Vegas in 1947: Scarne made use of his stacks of chips as a device to help track the contents of the undealt cards.&lt;ref name="OddsAgainstMe-count"&gt;{{cite book

  | title = The Odds Against Me
  | publisher = Simon &amp; Schuster
  | year = 1966
  | location = New York
  | pages = 366–368 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
A more complete description of his technique is present in his later book, ''Scarne's Guide to Casino Gambling'', where he also described preventative measures taken by casinos to combat card counting.&lt;ref name="GuideCasinoGambling-count"&gt;{{cite book

==Personal life==
Scarne married [[Steffi Scarne|Steffi Storm]] (née [[Steffi Scarne|Norma Kearney]]) in 1955 (and they had [[John Teeko Scarne|John Teeko]] the same year). Scarne died on July 7, 1985 at 82, while living in [[North Bergen, New Jersey]].&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt;

The '''Karachi International Film Festival''', simply known as the '''Kara Film Festival''' (Urdu: '''''کارا فلم فیسٹیول''''' or '''''کارا فلم''''')  &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.karafilmfest.com/about.htm About us] Official website.&lt;/ref&gt; was founded in 2001 by the KaraFilm Society, reportedly in response to the declining state of the [[Cinema of Pakistan|Pakistani film industry]]. The film festival was held annually until 2009. The 8th Kara Film Festival was supposed to be held in 2010 but has since been delayed every year due to the socio-economic problems that Karachi was facing.

The goal of the festival was to "promote an appreciation of the art and craft of filmmaking among a wide population as well as to encourage creativity and high standards among filmmakers". The Kara Film Festival was founded to celebrate the past galore of [[Cinema of Pakistan|Pakistani cinema]] and help aid in its revival.

The festival featured a variety of independent films including [[Documentary film|documentaries]], narrative features and [[Short film|shorts]]. From the 6th festival onwards there was also a family-friendly section of children's [[Animation|animated movies]] There would be a jury who would celebrate emerging and renowned filmmakers by awarding their works. One distinctive feature of the festival was that it would showcase works of art by Pakistani artists. Another feature of the festival was that the opening and closing ceremonies would feature some of the new as well as some of the famed Pakistani musical talent.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.karafilmfest.com/KaraFilm2006/currentkara_2006.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''king''' is a [[playing card]] with a picture of a king on it. The king is usually the highest-ranking [[face card]]. In [[French playing cards]] and [[tarot]] decks, the king immediately outranks the [[Queen (playing card)|queen]]. In [[Italian playing cards|Italian]] and [[Spanish playing cards]], the king immediately outranks the [[Knight (playing card)|knight]]. In [[German playing cards|German]] and [[Swiss playing cards]], the king immediately outranks the ''[[Ober (playing card)|Ober]]''. In some games, the king is the highest-ranked card; in others, the [[ace]] is higher. Aces began outranking kings around 1500 with [[Trappola]] being the earliest known game in which the aces were highest in all four suits.&lt;ref name="Parlett"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Parlett|first1=David|title=The Oxford Guide to Card Games|date=1990|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|page=252}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Ace-Ten games|Ace-Ten family]] of games such as [[pinochle]] and [[schnapsen]], both the ace and the 10 rank higher than the king.&lt;ref&gt;McLeod, John. [https://www.pagat.com/aceten/ Ace-Ten Games] at [[pagat.com]]. Retrieved 25 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Kings-comparison.jpg|thumb|150px|French Rouen pattern on the left, Spanish Toledo pattern on the right]]

The king card is the oldest and most universal court card. It most likely originated in Persian [[Ganjifa|Ganjifeh]] where kings are depicted as seated on thrones and outranking the viceroy cards which are mounted on horses. Playing cards were transmitted to Italy and Spain via the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluks]] and [[Moors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tor, Gjerde|url=http://cards.old.no/1500-mamluk/|title=Mamluk cards, ca. 1500|work=old.no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wintle, Simon. [http://www.wopc.co.uk/spain/moorish/index Moorish playing cards] at World of Playing Cards. Retrieved 25 February 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The best preserved and most complete deck of Mamluk cards, the [[Topkapı Palace|Topkapı]] pack, did not display human figures but just listed their rank most likely due to religious prohibition. It is not entirely secure if the Topkapı pack was representative of all Mamluk decks as it was a custom-made luxury item used for display. A fragment of what may be a seated king card was recovered in Egypt which may explain why the poses of court cards in Europe resemble those in Persia and India.&lt;ref name="Dummett"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dummett|first1=Michael|title=The Game of Tarot|date=1980|publisher=Duckworth|location=London|pages=10–64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:King of Hearts Ruen pattern comparison.jpg|thumb|left|Evolution of the King of Hearts from the Rouennais pattern to the English pattern]]

Seated kings were generally common throughout Europe. During the 15th century, the Spanish started producing standing kings. The French originally used Spanish cards before developing their regional deck patterns. Many Spanish court designs were simply reused when the French invented their own suit-system around 1480.&lt;ref name="Dummett" /&gt; The English imported their cards from [[Rouen]] until the early 17th century when foreign card imports were banned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://i-p-c-s.org/pattern/ps-48.html English pattern] at the [[International Playing-Card Society]]. Retrieved 25 February 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The king of hearts is sometimes called the "suicide king" because he appears to be sticking his sword into his head. This is a result of centuries of bad copying by English card makers where the king's axe head has disappeared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whiteknucklecards.com/nsp/rouenpattern.html|title=The Rouen Pattern|work=whiteknucklecards.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wintle, Simon. [http://www.wopc.co.uk/cards/suicide-king Suicide King] at the World of Playing Cards. Retrieved 25 February 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in the 15th century, French manufacturers assigned to each of the court cards names taken from history or mythology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snopes.com/history/world/cardking.asp "The Four King Truth"] at the [[Urban Legends Reference Pages]]. Retrieved 25 February 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; This practice survives only in the Paris pattern which ousted all its rivals, including the Rouen pattern around 1780.&lt;ref name="Mann"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mann|first1=Sylvia|title=All Cards on the Table|date=1990|publisher=Jonas Verlag|location=Leinfelden|pages=115–124}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pollett, Andy.

'''Kirigi''' is a fictional [[ninja]] [[assassination|assassin]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. After being resurrected by [[The Hand (comics)|The Hand]], he works as an operative for the group. He is extremely strong, and is both a weapons master and an accomplished martial artist with an ability to use a form of [[meditation]] that allows him to recover from otherwise-mortal wounds.

==Publication history==
Kirigi first appeared in ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'' #174-176 (September-November 1981), and was created by [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]].&lt;ref name="Marvunapp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/kirigi.htm|title=Kirigi (Hand, Elektra foe)|date=1 May 2005|publisher=Appendix to the Handbook of the Marvel Universe|author=Jeff Christiansen|accessdate=22 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The character subsequently appears in ''Daredevil'' #187-188 (October-November 1982).&lt;ref name="Marvunapp"/&gt;

==Fictional character biography==
While it is known that the ninjas of ancient [[Japan]] feared Kirigi, little else is known of his history.

Kirigi is an opponent of both [[Chaste (Marvel Comics)|The Chaste]], a group commanded by [[Stick (comics)|Stick]], and two of Stick's former pupils, [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] and [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra Natchios]]. This hatred eventually prompts the Hand to resurrect him in order to destroy Elektra. This plot eventually reaches its climax as Elektra, walking into a trap laid by the Hand, attempts to kill the Hand's Jonin (ninja master) with the assistance of Daredevil. Instead of meeting the Jonin, she meets Kirigi. In response, she stabs him with two sai; however, he merely pulls them out effortlessly. He then dupes her into going for her sai, only to choke her with his rope knife. However, she manages to impale him with her blade, forcing him to break off the fight. A day later, however, he returns to attack Elektra again after recovering from his wounds using meditation and mystic ointments. Once again, a fierce battle ensues. Elektra flees into a semi-rig and smashes into him at a high speed. She then leaps out of the semi-rig before it explodes. In spite of this, Kirigi merely stands back up, though his skin is still engulfed in flames. Finally, Elektra simply decapitates him as he tries to regain his bearings, saying: "God or demon, Kirigi had a neck and that was human enough."&lt;ref&gt;''Daredevil'' Vol1 #175-176 (October November 1981)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theothermurdockpapers.com/2010/03/the-hand-the-life-and-first-death-of-kirigi/|date=14 March 2010|work=The Other Murdock Papers|accessdate=22 November 2011|title=The Hand – The life and (first) death of Kirigi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several Hand ninjas soon clash with the Chaste and Daredevil and sacrifice their lives in order to resurrect Kirigi once again, to aid them in their battle against the Chaste and Daredevil. At the moment, Daredevil has temporarily lost control of his enhanced senses and is in an isolation tank with Stick, who is trying to help him regain control of them. The newly revived Kirigi attempts to ambush Stick, but he is no match for the Chaste warriors, who collectively are able to defeat him. Stick then orders Kirigi's body destroyed to prevent him from being resurrected once again.&lt;ref&gt;''Daredevil'' Vol1 #187-188 (October November 1982)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
Kirigi has a seemingly superhuman resistance to pain and injury. He is capable of lifting at least 1,000 pounds. Both a weapons master and an accomplished martial artist, his various areas of expertise include the use of the Katana, Shuriken, Kyoketsu Shogi (rope knife), and sai. In addition, the use of a form of meditation allows him to recover from otherwise-mortal wounds. As a result, he is virtually impervious to all but devastating wounds.

Elektra challenged Kirigi in a final battle on who should get the Treasure, which was a girl named Abby. They fought but Kirigi got the upper hand, beating Elektra around until she realized he killed her mother when she was a child. Kirigi then ran up to her, but Elektra stabbed him in the chest with her sai and threw him into a well, where he disintegrated while falling.

'''Lesburlesque''' is a British troupe of over thirty [[burlesque]] performers that perform on the [[cabaret]] circuit.  They are notable for being the first and only burlesque troupe in the UK that performs [[lesbian]] burlesque.  Following on from the success of Los Angeles-based girl band and dance troupe, [[the Pin Up Girls]], Lesburlesque appeared on the burlesque scene in September 2010.  They came to wider public attention in 2012 for having performed at a former church and continue to incorporate traditionally lesbian specific [[cabaret]] entertainment, such as [[drag king]]ing to broadening its appeal to the wider cabaret circuit.

==History==
Lesburlesque is a British [[burlesque]] and [[dance troupe]], founded by [[lesbian]] cabaret performer Pixie Truffle in 2010.  The troupe began as a duet burlesque routine idea, but following favourable responses from established burlesque performers Kitty Liquor, Mona Von Chrome, Isobella Lash and [[March Violets]] vocalist Rosie Garland, aka Rosie Lugosi, Pixie dedicated herself to making Lesburlesque into a fully fledged cabaret group.

Performing at a former place of worship, Platt Chapel (now Unique Manchester), Lesburlesque garnered scathing attention from the British Tabloid press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2097775/Britains-lesbian-burlesque-troupe-stage--CHURCH.html |title=Britain's first ever lesbian burlesque troupe take to the stage... in a CHURCH | first=Deborah | last=Arthurs |work=The Daily Mail |date=2012-02-07 |accessdate=2012-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the press in Manchester seemed supportive of their efforts to expand the concept of burlesque to the LGBTQ community and to render sapphic art forms such as drag kinging available to a larger audience.&lt;ref name="Mancunian Matters"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://mancunianmatters.co.uk/content/10022332-lesbian-burlesque-act-grace-fallowfields-platt-chapel |title=Lesbian burlesque act to grace Fallowfield's Platt Chapel |work=Mancunian Matters |first=Francine | last=Ponticelli |date=2012-02-10 |accessdate=2012-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MEN"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/news/s/1478641_lesbian-burlesque-troupe-to-perform-at-former-church-in-fallowfield |title=Lesbian burlesque troupe to perform at former church in Fallowfield |work=Manchester Evening News |publisher=MEN Media |first=Amy | last=Glendinning |date=2012-02-07 |accessdate=2012-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The troupe continue to use established drag king performers The Dyke Kings and Juan Kerr.  Lesburlesque and Pixie continue to spearhead the rise to equality of drag king performance art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/shortcuts/2012/aug/26/drag-kings-standup-women-comedy |title=How 'drag kings' are taking the standup world by storm |work=The Guardian |first=Nadeem | last=Akhtar |date=2012-08-26 |accessdate=2012-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In an exchange between Pixie and actress and feminist writer Rhona Foulis, Pixie claims it is "...her personal mission to bring lesbian performances to a mainstream audience, in exactly the same way as drag queens have been accepted."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.progressivewomen.org.uk/neo-burlesque-neo-blog/ |title=Neo-burlesque, neo-blog |publisher=Progressive Women |first=Rhona |last=Foulis|date=2011-12-22 |accessdate=2012-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Associations==
The troupe continues to be associated with the Lesbian Community Project,&lt;ref name="Mancunian Matters" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MEN" /&gt; a charitable organisation that helps to put lesbians in touch with each other across Manchester and to provide counselling and fun activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lesbiancommunityproject.co.uk/ |title=Lesbian Community Project |publisher=Lesbian Community Project |date= |accessdate=2012-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On their first anniversary Pixie Truffle formed a one off partnership with Bella Besame, the founder and promoter of The Slippery Belle Presents...BURLESQUE! revue in Manchester.

On their second anniversary Pixie announced a partnership with The Singapore Burlesque Club,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sukkisingapora.com/images/Sukki-Singapora-makes-it-into-My-Paper-Newspaper-Singapore_xlarge.jpg |title=Bring on the Burlesque! |work=MyPaper |publisher=[http://www.mypaper.sg/ MyPaper] |first=Sue-Anne |last=Lim |date=2011-11-29 |accessdate=2012-09-10 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; a well-known Burlesque revue in [[Singapore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chwennyland.com/2011/11/10/i-found-a-burlesque-star-in-my-own-backyard/ |title=I Found A Burlesque Star In My Own Backyard |publisher=Chwenny Wordpress Blog |first=Sue-Anne| last=Lim|date=2011-11-10 |accessdate=2012-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Singapore is a country with stringent controls on public nudity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://statutes.agc.gov.sg/aol/search/display/view.w3p;ident=cca997e7-498a-4778-bc6a-70f965161b83;page=0;query=DocId%3Aca5b9bd4-5b2e-4b42-9349-a5aaf258d9a4%20%20Status%3Ainforce%20Depth%3A0;rec=0#pr27A-he-. |title=MISCELLANEOUS OFFENCES (PUBLIC ORDER AND NUISANCE) ACT (CHAPTER 184) |work=The Singapore Attorney General's Chamber|accessdate=2012-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Burlesque Club's stance, and association with a Lesbian Burlesque troupe, would at the very least be at odds with the state of women's rights and gay rights in its native Singapore.

== Plot ==
At the beginning of the film, two lonesome [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Rangers]], Roland Sharp ([[Tommy Lee Jones]]) and Maggie Swanson ([[Liz Vassey]]), are going to a church in order to question Percy Stevens ([[Cedric the Entertainer]]) about the whereabouts of his former prison roommate, Morgan Ball, who they want to testify against organized crime boss John Cortland. Percy is indignant, telling Sharp and Swanson that he is a "man of God" and has not spoken with Ball in years. However, Percy's cellphone rings, displaying Ball's name.

Sharp and Swanson track down Ball to the warehouse, where Ball gives Sharp a key in an attempt to buy him off. Instead, Sharp takes the key and forces Ball outside, where FBI agent Eddie Zane ([[Brian Van Holt]]) is waiting. As they talk, a sniper begins shooting, wounding Swanson and giving Ball a chance to escape. It is revealed the sniper is after Ball, and a group of cheerleaders from the [[University of Texas at Austin]] witness his murder. Agent Zane is found shot in the arm next to Ball's body and claims he didn't see the sniper.

Anne ([[Christina Milian]]), Teresa ([[Paula Garcés]]), Evie ([[Monica Keena]]), Heather ([[Vanessa Ferlito]]) and Barb ([[Kelli Garner]]) are taken to the police station, where they all have conflicting descriptions of the shooter. Sharp is given the task of protecting the girls at all times, because their fathers are worried about them. The information is relayed to him by the [[Governor of Texas]] ([[Rick Perry]]).

It is revealed that Sharp is divorced and has a daughter, Emma ([[Shannon Marie Woodward]]) who is in high school and doesn't feel as though her father had ever been around. John Cortland is been exonerated from all charges pressed against him due to a lack of evidence. FBI Agent Zane is revealed to be working with Cortland, having killed Ball and shot himself in the arm. 

Cortland scolds Zane for letting some "loose ends" escape, and Zane begins searching for Sharp and the cheerleaders; he also kills the sniper he hired. With Swanson in the hospital recovering from her near-fatal wound, Sharp and two additional rangers must now pick the girls up from school and secure their sorority house. Sharp moves in with the girls and the two young men with him move into the fraternity house across the street, where they end up busting a drug deal.

Sharp sets some ground rules, including no cell phones. He also tells them to "cover up in his presence" (referring to the girls' revealing clothes). When they fail to comply, he orders a massive industrial air conditioner, forcing them to dress warmly. Sharp is posing as a cheerleading coach specializing in conditioning, and at a [[Texas Longhorns football|Longhorns]] football game he tackles an opposing team's mascot when the mascot approaches the girls with a gun, later revealed to be a water gun. Other humorous mishaps occur, but Sharp's relationship with the girls begins to strengthen; Barb even begins to develop a crush on him.

However, Sharp finds himself attracted to Barb's English teacher Molly ([[Anne Archer]]) who calls him into her office to complain about Barb's [[plagiarism]]. Later he invites her over for dinner, which the girls coach him through using an earpiece and tiny video screen. After they fall asleep, he turns it off and woos Molly himself. He admits to the girls about his last failed marriage and the way he feels about his estranged daughter. This interests Evie, who has a 4.0 [[GPA]] and wants to write a paper on Emma. She uses the house's "emergency phone" to call her, revealing Sharp's location to Zane, who had contacted Emma.

Sharp takes the girls to a "spirit rally", where he is forced to give a speech about cheerleading. He becomes more and more impassioned, proving to the girls he finally "gets it". The night is ruined, however, when Sharp realizes in the nick of time that somebody put a bomb under their van, and Teresa (who was convinced that nobody was after them) is almost killed when her seatbelt gets stuck. Sharp saves her, and she admits that maybe someone is trying to kill them.

Evie tells Sharp she contacted Emma, and when Sharp calls his daughter he learns that Zane has her. He tells Sharp to take the key Ball gave him to open a lockbox, both of them unaware the cheerleaders are listening in. The next day Sharp gets the money out of the lockbox and drives to where Zane instructs him. Zane gives Sharp instructions over a cell phone, telling him he will shoot Emma if Sharp disobeys. After Sharp handcuffs himself to the steering wheel, Zane thanks him and tells him he's a "good parent." Zane takes off with the money, Sharp's keys and phone, and Emma.

Zane and Emma get on a bus, but as it pulls away Sharp sees Barb in the back. As he wonders what is going on, Heather gets in the car with him and picks his handcuffs. They take off after the bus in a stolen [[Volkswagen Beetle]]. On the bus, Teresa pretends to go into labor and Evie demands the bus be stopped. She attempts to steal the bag with the money, but Zane pulls a gun and Evie runs away from the bus. Zane forces all of the other passengers and the driver out, taking over driving the bus himself.

Emma is rescued by the cheerleaders, but Zane attempts to drive to Mexico with the bag to hide. Sharp shoots a wheel, causing the bus to flip over 90 degrees. Zane gets out the bus, his face injured after he hits the bus's ceiling. The [[Mexico-United States border]] closes and the border officers draw guns on him, forcing him to surrender. Sharp shoots the gun out of Zane's hand, and handcuffs him with the very same cuffs Heather freed him from earlier. He and Emma are reunited. At the end of the film, Cortland is arrested and taken back to court, Sharp and Molly are married, and Emma and the cheerleaders are part of the wedding.

== Reception ==

=== Critical reaction ===
On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 9% based on 64 reviews, with an average rating of 3.4/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "A high-concept movie that plays out like a mediocre TV sitcom."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Man of the House (2005) |url = https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/man_of_the_house/ |work = [[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film has a score of 35 out of 100 based on 20 critics, indicating "generally unfavorable reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/man-of-the-house|title=Man of the House Reviews|work=[[Metacritic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of "B–" on an A+ to F scale.&lt;ref name="CinemaScore"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://m.cinemascore.com |title=CinemaScore |work=cinemascore.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

[[James Berardinelli]] of ''[[ReelViews]]'' panned the film, rating it one star out of four and writing: "The movie is an "action comedy" in name only - there's nothing in ''Man of the House'' that could be considered funny or exciting." He also said the movie "manages to neuter Cedric the Entertainer's capacity for humor" since "not even he is able to deliver a legitimate laugh" and that Tommy Lee Jones "comes across as taciturn and unlikable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=James|last=Berardinelli|url=http://preview.reelviews.net/movies/m/man_house.html |title=
Man of the House |publisher=[[ReelViews]] |date= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Stephen Hunter]] of the ''[[Washington Post]]'' called the film "a one-screen multiplex" with "a lot of small movies bouncing around inside it, but there's no big movie on the outside." Hunter felt that by the end the "many personalities" of the film have "grown tiresome". Nonetheless, he complimented Tommy Lee Jones' "deadpan" portrayal, saying "Whenever Herek doesn't know what to do -- and that's frequently -- he cuts to Jones, radiating world-weariness with the aplomb of Fred Astaire, and it's always funny."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Stephen|last=Hunter|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/02/26/AR2005062900968.html |title=

Dana Stevens of the ''[[New York Times]]'' wrote: "Nearly every one of the film's emotional scenes is too predictable to hit its mark, but Mr. Jones's dry delivery has its moments." However, Stevens found Cedric the Entertainer to be disappointing, stating that he "fails for once to live up to his name".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Dana|last=Stevens|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/26/movies/texas-ranger-assigned-to-sorority-house.html |title=

=== Box office ===
In its opening weekend, the film grossed $8,917,251 in 2,422 theaters in the United States and Canada, ranking #5 at the box office and averaging $3,681 per theater. The film closed on April 7, 2005, with a North American domestic gross of $19,699,706 and an international gross of $1,877,918 for a worldwide gross of $21,577,624.

'''''Mort the Chicken''''' is a [[platformer]] [[video game]] developed by [[AndNow]] and published by [[Crave Entertainment]]. It was released in the United States on November 30, 2000 for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] and later released in Europe on January 19, 2001.

==Story==
The chickens live peacefully in an alternate universe, where chickens are the dominant species. Mort the Chicken is the star of his own television show. In another universe, cube-like creatures called The Boolyon are spying on the chickens. The leader of the cubes, General Cubicles, notices that the chickens have stacks of hay, and Cubicles mistakes them for kidnapped citizens of their universe. While Mort is filming his own TV show, the cubes reach their universe via a well and kidnap all the baby chicks, scattering them across the chicken universe. Mort, being the only one brave enough to stop the cubes, jumps down the well and starts his adventure to save the baby chicks.&lt;ref name="Mort the Chicken"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.andnow.net/mort-the-chicken/ |title=Mort the Chicken |publisher=[[AndNow]] |accessdate=October 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
''Mort the Chicken'' is a relatively straightforward [[platformer]]. The player controls Mort as he explores his universe, rescuing baby chicks and killing cubes. Mort can destroy the cubes using the comb on his head, which can be used as a whip. Some cubes cannot be killed, and every time Mort takes a hit, the cubes steal a chick from Mort and imprison it. Mort's health bar is shown by two stalks of [[maize|corn]], and when Mort loses health, part of the corn disappears. Each level has up to 10 chicks to rescue. Mort can also gain power-ups. These power-ups include making him jump higher, become giant, attract chicks, extend his neck-whip attack, or have chicks attack enemies. Eggs and chicken food are scattered across the levels, and Mort can peck at these with his beak. Eggs give Mort power-ups and chicken food restores health.

== Classical music==
{{Main article|Indian classical music}}
The two main traditions of Indian classical music are Carnatic music, which is found predominantly in the peninsular regions, and Hindustani music, which is found in the northern, eastern and central regions. The basic concepts of this music includes ''[[Shruti (music)|shruti]]'' (microtones), ''[[swaras]]'' (notes), ''[[alankar]]'' (ornamentations), ''[[raga]]'' (melodies improvised from basic grammars), and ''[[Tala (music)|tala]]'' (rhythmic patterns used in percussion). Its tonal system divides the octave into 22 segments called Shrutis, not all equal but each roughly equal to a quarter of a whole tone of the Western music.

===Hindustani music===
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}
{{Main article|Hindustani classical music}}
The tradition of Hindustani music dates back to Vedic times where the hymns in the Sama Veda, an ancient religious text, were sung as Samagana and not chanted. It diverged from Carnatic music around the 13th-14th centuries CE, primarily due to Islamic influences.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} Developing a strong and diverse tradition over several centuries, it has contemporary traditions established primarily in India but also in Pakistan and Bangladesh. In contrast to Carnatic music, the other main Indian classical music tradition originating from the South, Hindustani music was not only influenced by ancient Hindu musical traditions, historical [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic philosophy]] and native Indian sounds but also enriched by the [[Persian traditional music|Persian]] performance practices of the [[Mughal era|Mughals]]. Classical genres are [[dhrupad]], [[dhamar (music)|dhamar]], [[khyal]], [[tarana]] and [[sadra (music)|sadra]], and there are also several semi-classical forms.

===Carnatic music===
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}
{{Main article|Carnatic music}}

Carnatic music can be traced to the 14th - 15th centuries AD and thereafter. It originated in South India during the rule of [[Vijayanagar Empire]]. Like Hindustani music, it is [[Melodic music|melodic]], with improvised variations, but tends to have more fixed compositions. It consists of a composition with improvised embellishments added to the piece in the forms of ''[[Alapana|Raga Alapana]]'', ''[[Kalpanaswaram]]'', ''[[Niraval|Neraval]]'' and, in the case of more advanced students, Raga, Tala, Pallavi. The main emphasis is on the vocals as most compositions are written to be sung, and even when played on instruments, they are meant to be performed in a singing style (known as ''gāyaki''). Around 300 [[raga]]ms are in use today.
[[Annamayya]] is the first known composer in Carnatic music. He is widely regarded as the Andhra Pada kavitā Pitāmaha (Godfather of Telugu song-writing).
[[Purandara Dasa]] is considered the father of Carnatic music, while the later musicians [[Tyagaraja]], [[Shyama Shastry]] and [[Muthuswami Dikshitar]] are considered the trinity of Carnatic music.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Noted artists of Carnatic music include [[Ariyakudi Ramanuja Iyengar]] (the father of the current concert format), [[Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer]], [[Alathur Brothers]], [[MS Subbulakshmi]], [[Lalgudi Jayaraman]] and more recently [[Balamuralikrishna]], [[TN Seshagopalan]], [[K J Yesudas]], [[N. Ramani]], [[Umayalpuram K. Sivaraman]], [[Sanjay Subrahmanyan]], [[TM Krishna]], [[Bombay Jayashri]], [[T S Nandakumar]], [[Aruna Sairam]], and [[Mysore Manjunath]].

Every December, the city of [[Chennai]] in India has its eight-week-long [[Madras Music Season|Music Season]], which is the world's largest cultural event.{{cn|date=February 2018}}

Carnatic music has served as the foundation for most music in South India, including folk music, festival music and has also extended its influence to film music in the past 100–150 years or so.

==Light classical music==
There are many types of music which comes under the category of light classical or semi-classical. Some of the forms are [[Thumri]], [[Dadra]], [[Ghazal]], [[Chaiti]], [[Kajri]], [[Tappa]], [[Natya Sangeet]] and [[Qawwali]]. These forms place emphasis on explicitly seeking emotion from the audience, as opposed to the classical forms.

=== Tamang Selo ===
{{Main article|Tamang Selo}}

This is a genre of [[Music of Nepal|Nepali folk song]] of the [[Tamang people]] and popular amongst the Nepali speaking community in West Bengal, Sikkim and around the world. It is accompanied by Tamang instruments, the [[Madal]], [[Damphu drum|Damphu]] and [[Tungna]], although nowadays musicians have taken to modern instruments. A Tamang Selo can be catchy and lively or slow and melodious, and is usually sung to convey sorrow, love, happiness or day-to-day incidents and stories of folklore.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.accu.or.jp/ich/en/arts/A_NPL12.html|title=Asia-Pacific Database on Intangible Cultural Heritage(ICH)|last=(ACCU)|first=Asia⁄Pacific Cultural Centre for UNESCO|website=www.accu.or.jp|access-date=2018-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hira Devi Waiba]] is hailed as the pioneer of Nepali folk songs and Tamang Selo. Her song 'Chura ta Hoina Astura' (चुरा त होइन अस्तुरा) is said to be the first Tamang Selo ever recorded. She has sung nearly 300 songs through her musical career spanning 40 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/1110120/jsp/siliguri/story_13466851.jsp|title=The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) {{!}} North Bengal &amp; Sikkim  {{!}} Hira Devi dies of burn injuries|website=www.telegraphindia.com|access-date=2018-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tamangonline.com/news/13540|title=चुरा त होइन अस्तुरा - पहिलो तामाङ सेलो गीत ? - Tamang Online|date=2016-12-07|work=Tamang Online|access-date=2018-07-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Waiba's death in 2011, her son Satya Waiba (producer) and [[Navneet Aditya Waiba]] (singer) collaborated and re-recorded her most iconic songs and released an album titled ''[[Ama Lai Shraddhanjali]]'' (आमालाई श्रद्धाञ्जली-Tribute to Mother).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170126/jsp/siliguri/story_132419.jsp|title=Daughter revives mother's songs|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2018-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/music/songs-of-tribute-navneet-aditya-waiba-and-satya-aditya-waiba/|title=Songs of Tribute|date=2017-01-10|work=The Himalayan Times|access-date=2018-07-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.kantipurdaily.com/literature/2017/11/04/20171104075616.html|title=छोराछोरीले दिए हीरादेवीलाई श्रद्धाञ्जली|access-date=2018-07-21|language=ne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sufi folk rock / Sufi rock ===
Sufi folk rock contains elements of modern hard rock and traditional folk music with Sufi poetry. While it was pioneered by bands like Junoon in Pakistan it became very popular, especially in north India. In 2005, Rabbi Shergill released a Sufi rock song called "Bulla Ki Jaana", which became a chart-topper in India and Pakistan. More recently, the sufi folk rock song "Bulleya" from the 2016 film ''[[Ae Dil Hai Mushkil]]'' became a mammoth hit.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

===Dandiya===
{{Main article|Dandiya}}

===Uttarakhandi music===
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}
Uttarakhandi folk music had its root in the lap of nature and the hilly terrain of the region. Common themes in the folk music of Uttarakhand are the beauty of nature, various seasons, festivals, religious traditions, cultural practices, folk stories, historical characters, and the bravery of ancestors. The folk songs of [[Uttarakhand]] are a reflection of the cultural heritage and the way people live their lives in the Himalayas. Musical instruments used in [[Uttarakhand]] music include the Dhol, Damoun, Turri, Ransingha, Dholki, Daur, Thali, Bhankora and Masakbhaja. [[Tabla]] and [[Harmonium]] are also sometimes used, especially in recorded folk music from the 1960s onwards. Generic Indian and global musical instruments have been incorporated in modern popular folks by singers like Narendra Singh Negi, Mohan Upreti, Gopal Babu Goswami, and Chandra Singh Rahi.

===Lavani===
{{Main article|Lavani}}

[[Lavani]] comes from the word ''Lavanya'' which means "beauty". This is one of the most popular forms of dance and music that is practiced all over [[Maharashtra]]. It has, in fact, become a necessary part of the Maharashtrian folk dance performances. Traditionally, the songs are sung by female artists, but male artists may occasionally sing [[Lavani]]s. The dance format associated with [[Lavani]] is known as [[Tamasha]]. Lavani is a combination of traditional song and dance, which particularly performed to the enchanting beats of 'Dholaki', a drum-like instrument. The dance is performed by attractive women wearing nine-yard saris. They are sung in a quick tempo. Lavani originated in the arid region of Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh.

===Rajasthan===
{{main article|Music of Rajasthan}}

[[Rajasthan]] has a very diverse cultural collection of musician [[caste]]s, including [[Langha (tribe)|Langa]]s, [[Sapera]], [[Bhopa]], [[Jogi]] and [[Manganiyar]] (lit. "the ones who ask/beg"). ''Rajasthan Diary'' quotes it as a soulful, full-throated music with harmonious diversity. The melodies of Rajasthan come from a variety of instruments.

Music composers, like [[R. D. Burman]], [[Shankar Jaikishan]], [[S. D. Burman]], [[Madan Mohan (music director)|Madan Mohan]], [[Bhupen Hazarika]], [[Naushad Ali]], [[O. P. Nayyar]], [[Hemant Kumar]], [[C. Ramchandra]], [[Salil Chowdhury]], [[Kalyanji Anandji]], [[Ilaiyaraaja]], [[A. R.

Reputed names in the domain of Indian classical music like [[Ravi Shankar]], [[Vilayat Khan]], [[Ali Akbar Khan]] and [[Ram Narayan]] have also composed music for films. Traditionally, in Indian films, the voice for the songs is not provided by the actors, they are provided by the professional [[playback singer]]s, to sound more developed, melodious and soulful, while actors lipsynch on the screen. In the past, only a handful of singers provided the voice in Hindi films. These include [[Kishore Kumar]],[[K. J. Yesudas]], [[Mohammed Rafi]], [[Mukesh (singer)|Mukesh]], [[S.P.

===Interaction with non-Indian music===
{{see also|Indo jazz|Raga rock|Psychedelic music|Indo-Caribbean music|Asian Underground|Bhangra (music)}}

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, [[rock and roll]] fusions with Indian music were well known throughout [[Europe]] and [[North America]]. [[Ali Akbar Khan]]'s 1955 performance in the [[United States]] was perhaps the beginning of this trend.

[[Jazz]] pioneers such as [[John Coltrane]]—who recorded a composition entitled 'India' during the November 1961 sessions for his album [[Village Vanguard|''Live At The Village Vanguard'']] (the track was not released until 1963 on [[John Coltrane|Coltrane]]'s album ''[[Impressions (John Coltrane album)|Impressions]]'')—also embraced this fusion. [[George Harrison]] (of [[the Beatles]]) played the [[sitar]] on the song "[[Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)]]" in 1965, which sparked interest from Shankar, who subsequently took Harrison as his apprentice. [[Jazz]] innovator [[Miles Davis]] recorded and performed with musicians like Khalil Balakrishna, Bihari Sharma, and Badal Roy in his post-1968 electric ensembles. Virtuoso jazz guitarist John McLaughlin spent several years in Madurai learning Carnatic music and incorporated it into many of his acts including Shakti which featured prominent Indian musicians. Other Western artists such as the [[Grateful Dead]], [[Incredible String Band]], [[the Rolling Stones]], [[the Move]] and [[Traffic (band)|Traffic]] soon incorporated Indian influences and instruments, and added Indian performers.
Legendary Grateful Dead frontman Jerry Garcia joined guitarist Sanjay Mishra on his classic CD "Blue Incantation" (1995). Mishra also wrote an original score for French Director Eric Heumann for his film ''Port Djema'' (1996) which won best score at Hamptons film festival and The Golden Bear at Berlin. in 2000 he recorded ''Rescue'' with drummer Dennis Chambers (Carlos Santana, John McLaughlin et al.) and in 2006 Chateau Benares with guests DJ Logic and Keller Williams (guitar and bass).

Though the Indian music craze soon died down among mainstream audiences, die-hard fans and immigrants continued the fusion. In 1985, a beat-oriented, Raga Rock hybrid called Sitar Power by [[Ashwin Batish]] reintroduced sitar in western nations. Sitar Power drew the attention of a number of record labels and was snapped up by Shanachie Records of New Jersey to head their World Beat Ethno Pop division.

In the late 1980s, Indian-British artists fused Indian and Western traditions to make the [[Asian Underground]]. Since the 1990s, Canadian born musician [[Nadaka]] who has spent most of his life in India, has been creating music that is an acoustic fusion of Indian classical music with western styles. One such singer who has merged the Bhakti sangeet tradition of India with the western non-Indian music is [[Krishna Das (singer)|Krishna Das]] and sells music records of his musical [[sadhana]]. Another example is the Indo-Canadian musician [[Vandana Vishwas]] who has experimented with western music in her 2013 album ''Monologues''.

In the new millennium, American [[hip hop music|hip-hop]] has featured Indian filmi and bhangra. Mainstream hip-hop artists have sampled songs from Bollywood movies and have collaborated with Indian artists.  Examples include [[Timbaland]]'s "Indian Flute", [[Erick Sermon]] and [[Redman (rapper)|Redman]]'s "React", Slum Village's "Disco", and [[Truth Hurts]]' hit song "Addictive", which sampled a [[Lata Mangeshkar]] song, and [[The Black Eyed Peas]] sampled [[Asha Bhosle]]'s song "Yeh Mera Dil" in their hit single "[[Don't Phunk With My Heart]]". In 1997, the British band [[Cornershop (band)|Cornershop]] paid tribute to [[Asha Bhosle]] with their song ''[[Brimful of Asha]]'', which became an international hit. [[United Kingdom|British]]-born Indian artist [[Panjabi MC]] also had a Bhangra hit in the U.S. with "Mundian To Bach Ke" which featured rapper [[Jay-Z]]. [[Asian Dub Foundation]] are not huge mainstream stars, but their politically charged [[hip hop music|rap]] and [[punk rock]] influenced sound has a multi-racial audience in their native UK. In 2008, international star [[Snoop Dogg]] appeared in a song in the film [[Singh Is Kinng]]. In 2007, hip-hop producer [[Madlib]] released [[Beat Konducta Vol 3–4: Beat Konducta in India]]; an album which heavily samples and is inspired by the music of India.

Sometimes, the music of India will fuse with the traditional music of other countries. For example, [[Delhi 2 Dublin]], a band based in Canada, is known for fusing Indian and [[music of Ireland|Irish]] music, and [[Bhangraton]] is a fusion of [[Bhangra (music)|Bhangra]] music with [[reggaeton]], which itself is a fusion of hip hop, reggae, and traditional [[Latin American music]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reggaetonline.net/luny-tunes-04262006_inside-reggaeton reggaetonline.net]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a more recent example of Indian-British fusion, [[Laura Marling]] along with [[Mumford and Sons]] collaborated in 2010 with the [[Dharohar Project]] on a four-song EP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=BBC review |title=A triumphant experiment that feels surprisingly authentic |first= Colin |last=Irwin |date=2010-09-03 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/rqzb}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British band [[Bombay Bicycle Club]] also sampled the song "[[Nagin (1954 film)#Soundtrack|Man Dole Mera Tan Dole]]" for their single "[[So Long, See You Tomorrow (album)|Feel]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | publisher= ''Indian Express'' |title= A Little This, A Little That |first= Pallavi |last= Pundir | date= March 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indian pop music===
{{main article|Indian pop}}

Indian pop music is based on an amalgamation of Indian folk and classical music, and modern beats from different parts of the world. Pop music really started in the [[South Asian]] region with the playback singer [[Ahmed Rushdi]]'s song ‘''Ko Ko Korina''’ in 1966, followed initially by [[Mohammad Rafi]] in the late 1960s and then by [[Kishore Kumar]] in the early 1970s.&lt;ref name="CITEREFSocPolHistory"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chowk.com/articles/8459|title=Socio-political History of Modern Pop Music in Pakistan|publisher=[[Chowk.com|Chowk]]|accessdate=2008-06-27|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100618091924/http://www.chowk.com/articles/8459|archivedate=2010-06-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After that, much of Indian Pop music comes from the [[Indian Film Industry]], and until the 1990s, few singers like [[Usha Uthup]], [[Sharon Prabhakar]], and [[Penaz Masani|Peenaz Masani]] outside it were popular. Since then, pop singers in the latter group have included [[Daler Mehndi]], [[Baba Sehgal]], [[Alisha Chinai]], [[KK (singer)|KK]], [[Shantanu Mukherjee]] a.k.a. Shaan, [[Sagarika Mukherjee|Sagarika]], [[Colonial Cousins]] ([[Hariharan (singer)|Hariharan]], [[Lesle Lewis (composer)|Lesle Lewis]]), [[Lucky Ali]], and [[Sonu Nigam]], and music composers like [[Zila Khan]] or [[Jawahar Wattal]], who made top selling albums with, [[Daler Mehndi]], [[Shubha Mudgal]], [[Baba Sehgal]], [[Shweta Shetty]] and [[Hans Raj Hans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/mp/2002/12/09/stories/2002120900620200.htm |title=Music man with a golden touch |publisher= [[The Hindu]] |date=December 9, 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides those listed above, popular Indi-pop singers include [[Sanam (band)|Sanam]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Creating New Memories With Old Songs: Sanam, The Band That Redefined The Meaning of Renditions |url=https://www.news18.com/news/ivideos/creating-new-memories-with-old-songs-sanam-the-band-that-redefined-the-meaning-of-renditions-1801793.html |accessdate=22 October 2018 |agency=News 18}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Band), [[Gurdas Maan]], [[Sukhwinder Singh]], [[Papon]], [[Zubeen Garg]], [[Raghav Sachar]] [[Rageshwari]], [[Vandana Vishwas]], [[Devika Chawla]], [[Bombay Vikings]], [[Asha Bhosle]], [[Sunidhi Chauhan]], [[Anushka Manchanda]], [[Bombay Rockers]], [[Anu Malik]], [[Jazzy B]], [[Malkit Singh]], [[Raghav]], [[Jay Sean]], [[Juggy D]], [[Rishi Rich]], [[Sheila Chandra]], [[Bally Sagoo]], [[Punjabi MC]], [[Bhangra Knights]], [[Mehnaz]], [[Sanober]] and [[Vaishali Samant]].{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

Recently, Indian pop has taken an interesting turn with the "[[remix]]ing" of songs from past Indian movie songs,  new beats being added to them.

====Raga rock====
{{Main article|Raga rock}}
{{See also|Psychedelic rock}}

Raga rock is rock or pop music with a heavy Indian influence, either in its construction, its timbre, or its use of instrumentation, such as the sitar and tabla. Raga and other forms of classical Indian music began to influence many rock groups during the 1960s; most famously [[the Beatles]]. The first traces of "raga rock" can be heard on songs such as "[[See My Friends]]" by [[the Kinks]] and [[the Yardbirds]]' "[[Heart Full of Soul]]", released the previous month, featured a sitar-like riff by guitarist [[Jeff Beck]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Miller, Andy.|page=3|year=2003|title=The Kinks are the Village Green Preservation Society (33⅓ series)|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|isbn=0-8264-1498-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bellman"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bellman, Jonathan.|page=297|year=1997|title=The Exotic in Western Music|publisher=Northeastern|isbn=1-55553-319-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Beatles song "[[Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)]]", which first appeared on the band's 1965 album [[Rubber Soul]], was the first western pop song to actually incorporate the sitar (played by lead guitarist [[George Harrison]]).&lt;ref name="bellman"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lewisohn, Mark.|authorlink=Mark Lewisohn|page=63|year=1989|title=The Complete Beatles Recording Sessions|publisher=The Hamlyn Publishing Group|isbn=0-600-55784-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Byrds]]' March 1966 single "[[Eight Miles High]]" and its B-side "[[Why (The Byrds song)|Why]]" were also influential in originating the musical subgenre. Indeed, the term "raga rock" was coined by The Byrds' publicist in the press releases for the single and was first used in print by journalist Sally Kempton in her review of "Eight Miles High" for [[The Village Voice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bellman, Jonathan.|page=351|year=1997|title=The Exotic in Western Music|publisher=Northeastern Publishing|isbn=1-55553-319-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hjort, Christopher.|page=88|year=2008|title=So You Want To Be A Rock 'n' Roll Star: The Byrds Day-By-Day (1965-1973)|publisher=Jawbone Press|isbn=1-906002-15-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; George Harrison's interest in Indian music, popularised the genre in the mid-1960s with songs such as "[[Love You To]]", "[[Tomorrow Never Knows]]" (credited to [[Lennon-McCartney]]), "[[Within You Without You]]" and "[[The Inner Light (song)|The Inner Light]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lavezzoli, Peter.|page=293|year=2007|title=The Dawn of Indian music in the West|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|isbn=0-8264-2819-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lavezzoli, Peter.|page=175|year=2007|title=The Dawn of Indian music in the West|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|isbn=0-8264-2819-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pedler|first=Dominic|page=524|title=The Songwriting Secrets of the Beatles|publisher=Omnibus Press|location=London|year=2003|isbn=978-0-7119-8167-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rock acts of the sixties both in turn influenced British and American groups and Indian acts to develop a later form of [[Indian rock]].

[[File:Nicotine Metal Band Indore.jpg|thumb|[[Nicotine (band)|Nicotine]] playing at 'Pedal To The Metal', TDS, Indore, India in 2014. The band is known for being the pioneer of [[metal music]] in [[Central India]].]]

The rock music "scene" in India is small compared to the filmi or fusion musicality "scenes" but as of recent years has come into its own, achieving a cult status of sorts. Rock music in India has its origins in the 1960s when international stars such as [[the Beatles]] visited India and brought their music with them. These artists' collaboration with Indian musicians such as [[Ravi Shankar]] and [[Zakir Hussain (musician)|Zakir Hussain]] have led to the development of [[raga rock]]. International shortwave radio stations such as The Voice of America, BBC, and Radio Ceylon played a major part in bringing Western pop, folk, and rock music to the masses. Indian rock bands began to gain prominence only much later, around the late 1980s.

It was around this time that the rock band [[Indus Creed]] formerly known as The Rock Machine got itself noticed on the international stage with hits like ''Rock N Roll Renegade''. Other bands quickly followed. As of now, the rock music scene in India is quietly growing day by day and gathering more support. With the introduction of MTV in the early 1990s, Indians began to be exposed to various forms of rock such as grunge and speed metal. This influence can be clearly seen in many Indian bands today. The cities of the North Eastern Region, mainly Guwahati and [[Shillong]], [[Kolkata]], [[Delhi]], [[Mumbai]] and [[Bangalore]] have emerged as major melting pots for rock and metal enthusiasts. Bangalore has been the hub for rock and metal movement in India. Some prominent bands include [[Nicotine (band)|Nicotine]], [[Voodoo Child (band)|Voodoo Child]], [[Indian Ocean (band)|Indian Ocean]], [[Kryptos (band)|Kryptos]], [[Thermal and a Quarter]], [[Demonic Resurrection]], [[Motherjane]], [[Avial (band)|Avial]], and [[Parikrama (band)|Parikrama]]. The future looks encouraging thanks to entities such as [[DogmaTone]] Records and [[Eastern Fare Music Foundation]] that are dedicated to promoting and supporting Indian rock.

From Central India, [[Nicotine (band)|Nicotine]], an Indore-based metal band, is widely credited of being the pioneer of [[metal music]] in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dnasyndication.com/dna/article/DNIND3926|title=Does Indore have the mettle for metal?    - DNA - English News &amp; Features - Art &amp; Culture - dnasyndication.com&lt;|work=dnasyndication.com|accessdate=18 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.educationinsider.net/detail_news.php?id=731|title=Metal mania|work=educationinsider.net|accessdate=18 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epaper.dnaindia.com/story.aspx?id=42518&amp;boxid=63886&amp;ed_date=2014-01-06&amp;ed_code=820076&amp;ed_page=1|title=Indore has a bandtastic time!|work=dnaindia.com|accessdate=18 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sinlung.com/2011/01/10-famous-rock-bands-of-india.html|title=The 10 Famous Rock Bands of India - Sinlung|work=sinlung.com|accessdate=18 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiaonline.in/About/Culture/Best-Rock-Bands-In-India.html|title=Best Rock Bands In India|work=indiaonline.in|accessdate=18 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.walkthroughindia.com/hot-trends/the-10-famous-rock-bands-of-india/|title=The 10 Famous Rock Bands of India|work=walkthroughindia.com|accessdate=18 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youthkiawaaz.com/2013/07/almost-there-6-awesome-indian-music-bands-to-look-forward-to/|title=Almost There: 6 Awesome Indian Music Bands To Look Forward To|work=Youth Ki Awaaz|accessdate=18 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.witty9.com/list-of-top-10-famous-rock-bands-who-gave-a-new-defination-to-the-music/|title=# 12 Prominent Indian Rock Bands Who Gave a New Definition To The Music.|work=Witty9|accessdate=18 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://travel.india.com/articles/12-cities-home-awesome-bands-probably-dint-know/|title=12 Cities That are Home to Awesome Bands and You Probably Din't Know It!|work=Travel India|accessdate=18 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toplisthub.com/top-10-rock-bands-in-india/|title=Top 10 Rock Bands in India|author=Neelima K|work=Top List Hub|accessdate=18 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epaper.dnaindia.com/epapermain.aspx?pgNo=4&amp;edcode=820076&amp;eddate=2013-6-26|title=DNA E-Paper - Daily News &amp; Analysis -Mumbai, India|work=dnaindia.com|accessdate=18 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Western classical music==
The spread and following of Western classical music in India is almost entirely non-existent. It is mainly patronised by the Indian [[Zoroastrian]] community and small esoteric groups with historical exposure to Western classical music. Another esoteric group with significant patronage is the Protestant Christian community in Chennai and Bangalore.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} Western Music education is also severely neglected and pretty rare in India. Western keyboard, drums and guitar instruction being an exception as it has found some interest; mainly in an effort to create musicians to service contemporary popular Indian music. Many reasons have been cited for the obscurity of Western classical music in India, a country rich in its musical heritage by its own right, however, the two main reasons are an utter lack of exposure and a passive disinterest in what is considered esoteric at best. The difficulty in importing Western musical instruments and their rarity have also contributed to the obscurity of classical Western music.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

Despite more than a century of exposure to Western classical music and two centuries of British colonialism, classical music in India has never gained more than 'fringe' popularity. Many attempts to popularise Western classical music in India have failed in the past due to disinterest and lack of sustained efforts.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} Today, Western classical music education has improved with the help of numerous institutions in India. Institutions like [[KM Music Conservatory]] (founded by Oscar-winning Composer [[A.R.Rahman]]), [[Calcutta School of Music]], [[Eastern Fare Music Foundation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://gnews.com/outstanding-results-for-eastern-fare-in-trinity-guildhall-exam-01200923114518/ | work=G News | title=Outstanding Results for Eastern Fare in Trinity Guildhall Exam | date=November 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Delhi School of Music]], [[Delhi Music Academy]], [[Guitarmonk]] and many others are dedicated to contributing to the progress or growth and supporting Western classical music. In 1930, [[Mehli Mehta]] set up the Bombay Symphony Orchestra. 

The Bombay Chamber Orchestra&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bcoindia.co.in/|title=The Bombay Chamber Orchestra - orchestra in Mumbai|website=www.bcoindia.co.in}}&lt;/ref&gt; (BCO) was founded in 1962.

In 2006, the [[Symphony Orchestra of India]] was founded, housed at the [[National Centre for the Performing Arts (India)|NCPA]] in Mumbai. It is today the only professional symphony orchestra in India and presents two concert seasons per year, with world-renowned conductors and soloists.

Some prominent Indians in Western [[classical music]] are:

*[[Andre de Quadros]], [[conducting|conductor]] and music educator
*[[Zubin Mehta]], conductor
*[[Mehli Mehta]], father of Zubin, violinist and founding conductor of the Bombay Symphony Orchestra
*[[Anil Srinivasan]], pianist
*[[Ilaiyaraaja]], the first Indian to compose a full symphony performed by the [[Royal Philharmonic Orchestra]] in London's Walthamstow Town Hall
*[[Naresh Sohal]], British Indian-born composer
*[[Param Vir]], British Indian-born composer

==Patriotism and music==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}
Patriotic feelings have been instigated within Indians through music since the era of the freedom struggle. [[Jana Gana Mana]], the [[national anthem]] of India by [[Rabindranath Tagore]], is largely credited&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://indianexpress.com/photos/india-news/rabindranath-tagore-77-death-anniversary-rare-photos-gurudev-mahatma-gandhi-5295604/|title=Rabindranath Tagore’s 77th death anniversary: Rare photos of ‘Gurudev’ with Mahatma Gandhi|date=2018-08-07|work=The Indian Express|access-date=2018-09-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.news18.com/news/ivideos/independence-day-2018-the-unheard-full-version-of-jana-gana-mana-1845167.html|title=Independence Day 2018 : The Unheard Full Version Of Jana Gana Mana|work=News18|access-date=2018-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; for uniting India through music and [[Vande Mataram]] by [[Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay]] as the national song of India. Patriotic songs were also written in many regional languages such as ''Biswo Bizoyi No Zuwan '' in Assamese. Post-independence songs such as [[Aye mere watan ke logo]], [[Mile Sur Mera Tumhara]], [[Ab Tumhare Hawale Watan Saathiyo]], [[Maa Tujhe Salaam (song)|Maa Tujhe Salaam]] by [[A.R.Rahman]] have been responsible for consolidating feelings of national integration and unity in diversity.

{{Italic title|reason=[[:Category:Japanese words and phrases]]}}
[[Image:Kuniyoshi Utagawa, The sumo wrestler.jpg|thumb|220px|A rikishi drawn in [[Ukiyoe]]. Inagawa Masanosuke (highest order Sekiwaki), 1844]]

A '''''rikishi''''' (力士) '''''sumotori''''' or, more colloquially, '''''sumosan''''', is a professional [[sumo]] wrestler. ''Rikishi'' are expected to live according to centuries-old rules and, although there are some exceptions, most come from [[Japan]], where sumo is practiced exclusively. Participation in official tournaments is the only means of marking achievement in sumo and the rank of an individual ''rikishi'' is based solely on official wins. 

==Terminology==
In popular use, the term ''rikishi'' can mean any sumo wrestler and an alternative term to ''sumotori'' (sumo practitioner) or the more colloquial ''sumosan''. The two [[kanji]] characters that make up the word ''rikishi'' are "strength/power" and "gentleman/samurai"; consequently, and more idiomatically, the term can be defined as "a gentleman of strength".

Within the world of sumo, ''rikishi'' is used as a catch-all term for wrestlers who are in the lower, un-salaried divisions of ''[[jonokuchi]]'', ''[[jonidan]]'', ''[[sandanme]]'' and ''[[makushita]]''. The more prestigious term ''[[sekitori]]'' refers to wrestlers who have risen to the two highest divisions of ''[[jūryō]]'' and ''[[makuuchi]]'' and who have significantly more status, privilege and salary than their lower-division counterparts, as enumerated [[sekitori|here]]. For details about the differences in competition between divisions see [[Professional sumo divisions]].

==Lifestyle of ''rikishi''==
The life of a sumo wrestler is strictly regimented and has detailed prescriptions and rules for ''rikishi'' that have been observed for centuries, so much so that ''rikishi'' can be seen more as a way of life than a career.

They are expected to grow their hair long to form a topknot or ''chonmage'', similar to the samurai hairstyles of the Edo Period. Furthermore, they are expected to wear the ''chonmage'' and traditional Japanese dress at all times when in public. Sumo life centers around the training [[Heya (sumo)|stable]]s to which all active wrestlers belong. In addition, most wrestlers, and all junior ones, live in their stable in a dormitory style: training, cleaning, eating, sleeping and socializing together. For more details, see [[Sumo#Life as a professional sumo wrestler|Life as a professional sumo wrestler]].

==Foreign-born rikishi==
{{see also|List of non-Japanese sumo wrestlers}}
Professional sumo is practiced exclusively in Japan, but wrestlers of other nationalities participate. As of August 2009 there were 55 wrestlers officially listed as foreigners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Foreigners in Sumo | publisher=dichne.com  | url=http://www.dichne.com/tForeigners.htm | accessdate=August 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2007, there were 19 foreigners in the top two divisions, which was an all-time record, and for the first time a majority of wrestlers in the top ''san'yaku'' ranks were from overseas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=McCurry, Justin | title=Last of the Sumo – Japanese youth turn their backs on gruelling sport of emperors |work=The Guardian |location=UK | url=https://www.theguardian.com/international/story/0,,2117132,00.html |date=  July 3, 2007| accessdate=July 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, the ratio of foreigners has stabilized and as of November 2011 there were 18 foreigners in the two top divisions.

A Japanese-American, [[Toyonishiki Kiichiro|Toyonishiki]], and the Korean-born [[Rikidōzan]] achieved ''[[sekitori]]'' status prior to World War II, but neither were officially listed as foreigners. The first non-Asian to achieve fame and fortune in sumo was Hawaii-born [[Takamiyama Daigorō|Takamiyama]]. He reached the top division in 1968 and in 1972 became the first foreigner to win the top division championship. He was followed by a fellow Hawaii-born 287 kg (660 pound) mega-weight, [[Konishiki Yasokichi|Konishiki]] of ethnic [[Samoans|Samoan]] descent, the first foreigner to reach the rank of ''ōzeki'' in 1987; and the native [[Native Hawaiians|Hawaiian]] [[Akebono Tarō|Akebono]], who became the first foreign-born ''yokozuna'' in 1993. [[Musashimaru Kōyō|Musashimaru]], born in [[Samoa]] but from Hawaii, became the second foreigner to reach sumo's top rank in 1999. Four straight ''yokozuna'', retired [[Asashōryū Akinori|Asashōryū]] and [[Harumafuji Kōhei]], and still active [[Hakuhō Shō|Hakuhō]] and [[Kakuryū Rikisaburō]] are all [[Mongolia]]n. In 2012, the Mongolian [[Kyokutenhō Masaru|Kyokutenhō]] became the oldest wrestler in modern history to win a top division championship.&lt;ref name=tenho&gt;{{cite news|title=Kyokutenho beats Tochiozan for title|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/ss20120521b1.html|accessdate=22 May 2012|newspaper=Japan Times|date=21 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wrestlers from Eastern European countries such as [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Russia]] have also found success in the upper levels of sumo. In 2005, [[Kotoōshū Katsunori|Kotoōshū]] from [[Bulgaria]] became the first wrestler of European birth to attain the ''ōzeki'' ranking and the first to win a top division championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bulgarian ozeki Kotooshu first European to win Emperor's Cup|publisher=[[Japan Times]]|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/ss20080525b1.html|accessdate=October 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another milestone, Brazilian [[Ryūkō Gō]] became the first foreign born wrestler to be given ''[[makushita tsukedashi]]'' status.

Until relatively recently, the [[Japan Sumo Association]] had no restrictions at all on the number of foreigners allowed in professional sumo. In May 1992, shortly after the [[Ōshima stable]] had recruited six Mongolians at the same time, the Sumo Association's new director Dewanoumi, the former ''yokozuna'' [[Sadanoyama Shinmatsu|Sadanoyama]], announced that he was considering limiting the number of overseas recruits per stable and in sumo overall. There was no official ruling, but no stable recruited any foreigners for the next six years.&lt;ref name="Tai"&gt;{{cite web | author=Hiroyuki Tai| title=Foreign sumo aspirants' numbers kept in check by stable quota policy |work=Japan Times   | url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20051125f2.html | date=November 25, 2005|accessdate=September 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This unofficial ban was then relaxed, but only two new foreigners per stable were allowed, until the total number reached 40.&lt;ref name="Tai"/&gt; Then in 2002, a one foreigner per stable policy was officially adopted, though the ban was not retroactive, so foreigners recruited before the changes were unaffected. Though the move has been met with criticism, there are no plans to relax the restrictions at this time.&lt;ref name="Tai"/&gt; Originally, it was possible for a place in a stable to open up if a foreign born wrestler acquired Japanese citizenship. This occurred when [[Aotsurugi Kenta|Hisanoumi]] changed his nationality from [[Tonga]]n at the end of 2006, allowing another Tongan to enter his stable,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Buckton, Mark|title=Numbers break records, character creates legends|work=The Japan Times |url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/ss20070123a1.html|date=January 23, 2007|accessdate=June 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kyokutenhō Masaru|Kyokutenhō]]'s change of citizenship allowed Ōshima stable to recruit Mongolian [[Kyokushūhō]] in May 2007.  However, on February 23, 2010 the Sumo Association announced that it had changed its definition of "foreign" to "foreign-born" (''gaikoku shusshin''), meaning that even naturalized Japanese citizens will be considered as foreigners if they were born outside Japan. The restriction on one foreign wrestler per stable was also reconfirmed. As Japanese law does not recognize subcategories of Japanese citizen, this unique treatment of naturalized citizens may well be illegal under Japanese law, although the restriction has never been challenged in court.&lt;ref&gt;Arudou, Debito, "[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fl20100302ad.html Sumo body deserves mawashi wedgie for racist wrestler ruling]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', March 2, 2010, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Rikishi'' in contrast to other martial arts practitioners==
While sumo is considered a martial art, it diverges from the typical Eastern style both at the surface and at its heart. Whereas most martial arts award promotions to practitioners through time and practice, a ''rikishi'''s sumo rank can be gained and lost every two months in the official tournaments. Conversely, in more common Japanese martial arts (such as [[karate]]), ranks are gained after passing a single test, and practitioners of karate are not normally demoted, even after repeated poor performances at tournaments. This divergence from other martial arts creates a high-pressure, high-intensity environment for ''rikishi''. All the benefits that ''[[sekitori]]'' wrestlers receive can be taken from them if they fail to maintain a high level of achievement in each official tournament (or ''[[honbasho]]'').

Furthermore, sumo does not provide any means of achievement besides the official tournaments. A ''rikishi'''s rank is determined ''solely'' by his number of wins during an official tournament. On the other hand, in many other Eastern martial arts, competitors can display their skill by performing standard routines, called ''[[kata]]'' or forms, to receive recognition. Thus, sumo wrestlers are very specialized fighters who train to win their bouts using good technique, as this is their only means of gaining better privileges in their stables and higher salaries.

== Former ''rikishi'' in mixed martial arts ==
{{Main|Mixed martial arts}}
The numerous differences between sumo and its martial arts counterparts have not deterred many former sumo wrestlers from competing in [[mixed martial arts]]. Most have had limited achievement; perhaps the most successful sumo wrestler to have competed in MMA is [[Tadao Yasuda]] who holds a record of two wins and four losses. Sumo wrestlers are seen as generally ineffective in MMA because the sports are vastly different from one another in achieving victory; striking techniques and submissions are required for MMA and neither are taught in sumo wrestling. A few key sumo techniques which require grabbing the belt or pants of the opponent also become ineffective, as this is illegal in MMA.

Other sumo wrestlers to have fought in mixed martial arts include [[Alan Karaev]], [[Kōji Kitao]], [[Henry Armstrong Miller]], [[Akebono Tarō]], [[Teila Tuli]] and [[Wakashoyo]]. Former UFC Light Heavyweight Champion [[Lyoto Machida]] also has a sumo background but his main style is [[Shotokan Karate]].

The '''Royal Scottish Country Dance Society''' (RSCDS), was founded in 1923 as the '''Scottish Country Dance Society''' by Jean Milligan and Ysobel Stewart of [[Fasnacloich]], who wanted to preserve [[Scottish country dance|country dancing]] as performed in [[Scotland]], country dancing having fallen into disuse after the influx of continental ballroom dances such as the [[waltz]] or [[quadrille]]s and, later on, American-style dances like the [[One-step]] or [[Foxtrot (dance)|foxtrot]]. (The SCDS didn't become the RSCDS until 1951.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rscds.org/help/history.html |title=RSCDS's History |accessdate=2013-11-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131119121454/http://www.rscds.org/help/history.html |archivedate=19 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;)

The RSCDS collected dances from living memory as well as from old (17-19c.) manuscripts and republished them in a series of books. Most of these dances needed some interpretation, and the dance style itself underwent serious standardisation, becoming much more balletic instead of the easy-going style that was the norm in the early 20th century, and which the RSCDS's founders considered sloppy and untraditional. After some argument, in the late 1940s the RSCDS also started publishing newly devised dances.

Today the RSCDS numbers some 11.000 members all over the world, served from the headquarters in [[Edinburgh]], and the continuous well-being of the [[Scottish country dance]] scene is largely due to the efforts of the Society. The RSCDS offers teacher training and holds an annual summer school in [[St Andrews]], [[Fife]] for four weeks in July and August. In addition to the annual summer school, the RSCDS offers a winter school in February and a youth orientated Spring Fling in April, which is held in the UK and Europe respectively.

'''''Scream of the Shalka''''' is a [[Macromedia Flash|Flash]]-animated series based on the British [[science fiction television]] series ''[[Doctor Who]]''. It was produced to coincide with the 40th Anniversary of the series and was originally posted in six weekly parts from 13 November to 18 December 2003 on [[bbc.co.uk]]'s ''Doctor Who'' website.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/doctorwho/webcasts/shalka/&lt;/ref&gt;

Although ''Scream of the Shalka'' continues the narrative of the original 1963–89 programme and the [[Doctor Who (film)|1996 television film]], the show's [[Doctor Who (series 1)|2005 revival]] ignored its events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bahn|first1=Christopher|title=Doctor Who (Classic): "Scream Of The Shalka"|url=http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/scream-of-the-shalka-106395|accessdate=28 July 2014|publisher=AVClub|date=21 Dec 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series was scripted by veteran ''Doctor Who'' writer [[Paul Cornell]], with [[Richard E. Grant]] providing the voice for the Ninth Doctor. This performance followed years of rumours that Grant would play [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor]] in a film or new series, and indeed he had appeared as the "Conceited Doctor" in the Comic Relief special ''[[Doctor Who and the Curse of Fatal Death]]'' in 1999. Grant subsequently went on to appear in the revived television series of ''Doctor Who'' as a guest villain in 2012's "[[The Snowmen]]" and 2013's "[[The Bells of Saint John]]" and "[[The Name of the Doctor]]". The Doctor's companion for this adventure, [[List of Doctor Who spin-off companions#Alison Cheney|Alison Cheney]], was voiced by [[Sophie Okonedo]] who a year later would be nominated for an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for her performance in ''[[Hotel Rwanda]]''. She also appeared in the [[Doctor Who (2010 series)|2010 series]] of ''Doctor Who'', as Liz 10, in the episodes "[[The Beast Below]]" and "[[The Pandorica Opens]]". [[Derek Jacobi]] reprised his role as the Master in 2007's "[[Utopia (Doctor Who)|Utopia]]". [[David Tennant]] appeared in a cameo role as the Caretaker, later being cast as the [[Tenth Doctor]] in 2005.

Previous ''Doctor Who'' webcasts had limited animation and were little more than a series of illustrations.  Earlier in 2003, BBCi had had some success with the original animated webcast ''[[Ghosts of Albion]]''.  The animation for that story was provided by Manchester-based animation studio [[Cosgrove Hall Films|Cosgrove Hall]], who were also hired to animate the missing episodes of Second Doctor serial ''[[The Invasion (Doctor Who)|The Invasion]]'' for its home release.

This story was the first officially licensed, fully animated ''Doctor Who'' story.

==Plot==
The [[TARDIS]] materializes in the village of Lannet in [[Lancashire]].  An annoyed Doctor, who has apparently been transported here against his will, is locked out of the [[TARDIS]] and forced to examine his surroundings. After determining he is in England in 2003, he is surprised to discover the village is silent and the inhabitants all living in fear except for a barmaid named Alison Cheney. After the patrons and bar owner refuse to tell the Doctor what's going on, he leaves the bar and stumbles upon a lava statue and a homeless woman who is frightened.  As the woman is beginning to fill in the Doctor on what's been happening, a tremor strikes the area and the woman is killed by a mysterious force.  Back at the TARDIS, the ground opens up and the Doctor's police box is swallowed up into the lava below.  Angered at the homeless woman's death, the Doctor tracks down Alison and her boyfriend Joe at their home and breaks in demanding that someone tell him what's been going on.  Alison tells the Doctor that three weeks ago, strange noises began coming from underground.  She has seen mysterious aliens around town watching her.  The townspeople have convinced themselves that they need to stay indoors and make as little noise as possible.  The Doctor begins making noise to attract the aliens, who burst up through the floor in a pool of lava.  Immune to their shrieking cries, he deflects their noises back at them causing them to explode.  The Doctor, Alison, and Joe flee next door where the Doctor explains that the aliens have bodies that can remake themselves.  He improvises a large explosion which he believes will disable them and buy time.  The explosion destroys the two alien worms and causes the noises from the ground to stop.

The Doctor contacts [[UNIT]] and explains that he is not interested in getting involved in this problem.  He gives them all the information he has on the aliens and tells them that once he retrieves his TARDIS he is leaving.  The aliens have begun nesting below ground at a site rich with a special volcanic rock the Doctor believes they have adapted themselves to use.  He maps out the area and leads a UNIT team down into some caves to find his TARDIS.  After a tense exchange with the UNIT commander, the worm creatures attack and the Doctor separates himself from the group and hitches a ride in a giant underground worm to the main lair of the aliens.  There he meets Prime, commander of the [[List of Doctor Who monsters and aliens#Shalka|Shalka]].  Prime declares humans inferior and subject to their domination.  The Doctor attempts to act inept to extract information from Prime, who sees through the act and calls him out on it.  Prime reveals that the Shalka are 2000 strong and will be invading the surface soon.  The Doctor attempts another bluff, declaring himself a non-human and therefore uninterested in what happens to the humans.  Prime orders Alison executed in hot lava, which forces the Doctor to make a deal to spare her life. He allows the Shalka into the TARDIS and de-activates the Master, who turns out to be an android programmed by the Doctor.  The Shalka tell the Doctor his technology is inferior and they do not need him.  He is cast into a black hole they have created inside Earth that they are using as a gateway to bring in more troops and also to dispose of people they do not need.  As he is plummeting into the black hole the Doctor realizes his phone is still connected to the TARDIS and uses it to summon the TARDIS.  He finds the Master re-activated and forcefully expels the Shalka from the TARDIS into the black hole.  For an unknown reason, the Shalka release Alison back to the surface.

As UNIT evacuates the town, a soldier tells the Doctor he has captured one of the Shalka on the surface.  The Shalka was accidentally exposed to raw oxygen when a cylinder near it exploded.  The raw oxygen caused it to pass out.  The Doctor also discovers that Alison is alive, and that none of the survivors from the town have made it to their new destinations.  The Doctor attempts to interrogate the Shalka but it recovers and attacks the soldier.  The Doctor uses more oxygen to subdue it until he can determine what's going on.  He also discovers that the survivors all have sore throats.  The survivors and Alison all march against their will to a warehouse in another town.  The Doctor arrives in his TARDIS with UNIT men inside and they storm the area.  The Doctor removes a living Shalka from Alison's forehead but the effort causes him to pass out.  When he recovers they find that all around the world people are mobilizing against their will to strategic points on Earth.  The Doctor realizes that the reason everyone has a sore throat is that they all have been emitting subsonic screams when under Shalka control.  The Shalka are using the screams to alter the atmosphere of the Earth.  As the slaves begin emitting their screams and the ozone layer of the Earth is being stripped away the Doctor takes Alison and the Master back to the Shalka underground lair.  When asked if the Master is coming with them, the Doctor tells Alison that the Master cannot leave the TARDIS.  The Doctor and Alison confront Prime, who tells them that the Shalka inhabit 80% of the worlds in the universe, living underground off of volcanic energy.  When a species is on the edge of ecological destruction, the Shalka come in and finish destroying the planet.  The rest of the universe assumes that the species that died off did the damage to themselves, and the Shalka live underground in the remains of that world.

The Doctor swallows the small piece of Shalka he removed from Alison's forehead.  He bonds with it, reprogramming it to do what he wants.  He uses its knowledge to plug himself into their sonic network and understand the shrieks.  He engages Prime in a "sonic duel", which he [[Match fixing|purposely throws]] to get Prime to move him toward the black hole controls.  He activates the black hole, sucking in Prime and sending her to her death.  Alison stops the black hole and the Doctor coughs up the piece of Shalka.  He puts it back in Alison's head, where she fights off the remaining Shalka and shuts down the screams.  The Doctor unplugs her a few moments before she can reprogram the scream to heal the atmosphere.  He tells her that she cannot be allowed that much power.  On board the TARDIS, the Master reveals that it has been a long time since the Doctor had a living companion.  His last companion was killed in the events that also led to the Master choosing to have his consciousness placed in the android and to the Doctor's exile.  Without being specific, the Master tells her that they are being controlled by an unknown force and the Doctor wants Alison to stay as his companion but he won't ask her to.  After they land, Joe arrives and Alison tells him she is leaving with the Doctor because she is bored and wants to see the universe.  Joe reluctantly accepts her decision and a kiss before the Master begins the TARDIS dematerializing cycle and they board the craft.

==Production==
''Doctor Who'' had suspended production in 1989, and aside from charity specials had only resurfaced as an American-funded [[Doctor Who (1996)|television movie]] in 1996, which did not garner enough ratings to go to a regular series. When ''Shalka'' was announced in July 2003 for planned broadcast in November, the possibility of ''Doctor Who'' returning to television screens still seemed remote and BBC Worldwide were continuing to shop around for another possible movie deal. As a result, BBCi officially announced, with BBC approval, that the Doctor appearing in ''Shalka'' would be the Ninth Doctor. However, events rapidly overtook this.

In September [[Lorraine Heggessey]], the Controller of [[BBC One]], managed to persuade BBC Worldwide that as their plans for a ''Doctor Who'' film were nowhere near fruition, BBC television should be allowed to make a new series. A deal with [[Russell T Davies]] to produce the new series was quickly struck, and on 26 September, the BBC announced that ''Doctor Who'' would be returning to [[BBC One]] in 2005, produced by [[BBC Wales]]. As a result, the status of the ''Shalka'' webcast was in doubt from even before it was released.

After the webcast, in February 2004, plans for sequels were indefinitely shelved. For a period, it was unclear if the new television Doctor would be the Ninth or Tenth Doctor, but this was ultimately settled in April 2004 when in an interview with ''[[Doctor Who Magazine]]'', Davies announced that the new television Doctor (played by [[Christopher Eccleston]]), would be the [[Ninth Doctor]], relegating Grant's Doctor to an alternate Doctor. Davies later commented that Grant had never been considered for the role in the television series, telling ''Doctor Who Magazine'': "I thought he was terrible. I thought he took the money and ran, to be honest. It was a lazy performance. He was never on our list to play the Doctor."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The novelization of ''Shalka'' was written by Paul Cornell. The book also includes a feature on the making of the webcast, as well as the original ''Servants of the Shalakor'' story outline.

[[Obverse Books]] published ''[[The Black Archive]] #10: Scream of the Shalka'' by Jon Arnold in March 2017,  detailing the story's key points and the production process, featuring an in depth look at the unmade sequel story ''Blood of the Robots''. This book also revealed that the [[Big Finish Productions|Big Finish]] audio drama ''Immortal Beloved'' was originally intended as a Shalka sequel before being adapted to feature the [[Eighth Doctor]].

==DVD release==
The [[British Board of Film Classification]] cleared all six episodes of the series for release on DVD. In March 2007, clips from the series were released to DVD, as part of ''Flash Frames'', a documentary on the DVD release of the restored ''The Invasion''. The story was released on DVD in Region 2 on 16 September 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Animation Plans for The Tenth Planet Episode 4 | journal = [[Doctor Who Magazine]] | issue = 458 | pages = 9 | publisher = [[Panini Comics]] | date = April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet|user=Paul_Cornell|author=Paul_Cornell|number=299650933502124034|date=7 February 2013|title=16th September: Scream of the Shalka on DVD! #fb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
&lt;!-- Please review WP:FILMPLOT before adding material. Plot summaries are recommended to be 400-700 words. --&gt;
Fin Shepard, and his ex-wife, April Wexler, are traveling to [[New York City]] to promote ''How to Survive a Sharknado and Other Unnatural Disasters'', a book April has written about [[Sharknado|the Los Angeles sharknado]]. As the plane comes in for a landing through a storm, it is battered by airborne sharks, losing an engine. Sharks enter the plane, killing passengers and the crew, including both pilots. While Fin lands the plane, April's hand is severed while she attempts to shoot a shark with an [[Federal Air Marshal Service|air marshal]]'s handgun.

Fin's sister, Ellen Brody, is sightseeing in New York with her family. Her husband, Martin, a childhood friend of Fin's, takes their son, Vaughn, to a [[New York Mets|Mets]] game at [[Citi Field]] along with Martin's and Fin's friends Skye and Brian. Ellen takes their daughter, Mora, to the [[Statue of Liberty]], where she meets with her friends, Polly and Chrissie, who tell her about Fin's recent appearance.

At the airport, Fin tries to warn the crowd of the impending storm, only for no one to take him seriously. After leaving April to the hospital for surgery, Fin is able to contact Ellen, and tells her to get to the Bales Tower Hotel on Manhattan as soon as possible. He agrees to retrieve Martin and Vaughn from the ball game, hiring a cabbie, Ben, in the process. At Citi Field, Skye surprises Fin with a kiss, but Fin explains that he and April are back together. The game is cancelled because of the storm, but when sharks start falling from the sky and killing people, Fin and his group improvise weapons to fight them and go to the [[Mets-Willets Point (IRT Flushing Line)|subway]].

On the ferry ride back to Manhattan, a shark kills Chrissie. The remaining three women flee from the severed head of the Statue of Liberty. Meanwhile, the subway tunnels flood, sending sharks to break into the train's rear cabin and kill Brian. Ben, who anticipated Fin's escape, takes Fin and the others to shops in search of weapons and items to make explosives. When the taxi is caught in a flood, Fin forms a [[Swing (seat)|rope swing]] to take Skye, Vaughn, and Martin to safety. When Ben is killed in his attempt and the rope falls away, Fin uses the top of the sharks as stepping stones to reach the others.

Two sharknadoes are converging into a more powerful storm directly above the hotel. Fin and Skye head to the roof to try to bomb the sharknadoes. Polly is flattened by a [[whale shark]], but Ellen and Mora reach the hotel, and reunite with Martin and Vaughn. Fin and Skye sling bombs into the tornadoes, but as the storm system is too cold; only a few sharks are knocked down, and they are forced to flee down a [[Emergency exit|fire exit stairwell]]. They meet the Brodys, who were fleeing up the stairwell that is flooding with sharks. They break down a door to escape the stairwell and leave the building.

April flees the hospital, taking a fire truck to meet Fin and the others. At the [[Empire State Building]], a third tornado is expected to merge with the other two. Fin plans to detonate a tank of [[Freon]] at the top of the building by connecting it to the structure's [[lightning rod]] to halt the storm. He rallies a crowd of New Yorkers, including the mayor and his task force, to battle the sharks. As he and Skye implement the plan, April, who has affixed a [[circular saw]] to her stump, arrives and saves Fin from a falling shark. Skye sacrifices herself to help connect the cables; the Freon explosion throws them in the air where sharks rip Skye in half. While in the twister, Fin grabs onto and rides a great white shark using chains, eventually impaling it on the building's antenna. He reunites with April and finds her lost arm in one of the fallen sharks, using the handgun to kill another one. He then takes the wedding ring from April's severed hand and uses it to propose remarriage, and she accepts.

Both of those properties, like Syfy, are owned by [[Comcast]].&lt;ref name=nbccameo/&gt; In contrast, [[Michael Gelman]], Strahan and Ripa all reprised their roles from ''[[Live with Kelly and Michael]]'' in the film; that show is not a Comcast property, instead directly competing with ''The Today Show''.

There are multiple in-jokes about ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'' (1975). Polly ([[Peggy Scott]]) was Mr. Brody's secretary, Martin Brody ([[Roy Scheider]]) was the chief, Ellen ([[Lorraine Gary]]) was his wife, Vaughn ([[Murray Hamilton]]) was the mayor's last name, Quint ([[Robert Shaw (British actor)|Robert Shaw]]) was the shark hunter, and Chrissy ([[Susan Backlinie]]) was the name of the first victim.

Brian Lowry of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' said the CGI sharks looked terrible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://variety.com/2014/tv/reviews/tv-review-sharknado-2-the-second-one-1201266887/ | title=TV Review: ‘Sharknado 2!

Don Kaplan of the ''[[New York Daily News]]'' said the film was "a slightly better, more watchable movie than its predecessor."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/sharknado-2-tv-review-article-1.1866578 | title='Sharknado 2: The Second One': TV review | newspaper=[[The New York Daily News]] |first=Don|last=Kaplan |  date=July 15, 2014 | accessdate=July 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Caroline Framke]] of ''[[The A.V.

==Broadcast==
The sequel was broadcast on SyFy on July 30, 2014.

Upon airing, the film was watched by 3.9 million viewers, with 1.6 million in the 18-49 demographic.&lt;ref name=ratings&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.stltoday.com/entertainment/television/gail-pennington/11b24922-6a29-5ac2-859c-0b5e32237134.html|title= 'Sharknado 2' smashes ratings records |newspaper=[[St. Louis Post Dispatch]] |first=Gail|last=Pennington |date=July 31, 2014 |accessdate=July 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Archie Comics]] also released a story about [[Archie Andrews]] encountering a Sharknado leading up to the third film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Blair|last=Marnell |url=http://www.craveonline.com/comics/previews/880155-first-look-archie-vs-sharknado-1 |title=First Look: Archie vs. Sharknado # 1 |website=Crave Online |date=July 21, 2015 |accessdate=July 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It aired on the promised date, followed by ''[[Lavalantula]]'', which debuted July 25, 2015, the Saturday after ''Sharknado 3''{{-'}}s Wednesday premiere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn505cckDI |title=Lavalantula Promo - July 25 on Space|date=15 July 2015 |publisher= |via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Lavalantula'' featured ''Sharknado''{{-'}}s protagonist in a cameo wearing a white T-shirt with crossed chainsaws. This indicates that it takes place in a shared universe. As he says he has "shark problems right now", this may indicate that the events of ''Lavalantula'' take place just before or concurrently with ''Sharknado 3''.

''[[Sharknado 4]]'' was confirmed to follow upon ''Sharknado 3''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s premiere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-33635945 |title=Sharknado 4 confirmed by Syfy as third film premieres |work=[[BBC News]] |date=July 23, 2014 |accessdate=July 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1285">The '''TV8-301''' was a small [[black and white]] [[television]] made by [[Sony]]. It is notable for being the world's first non-[[Projection TV|projection type]] all-[[transistor]] television. It had an eight-inch [[Television screen|screen]]. It was also portable, having a bay in the back for two 6&amp;nbsp;volt [[lead acid]] batteries. It was priced high as it was innovative on multiple fronts, so, to the average consumer it was something of a luxury item and not a practical buy. Additionally, this television was rather prone to malfunction, which led to it being called Sony's “frail little baby". Released on the market in 1960, it was discontinued in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sony.net/Fun/SH/1-7/h7.html Sony.net] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090830014548/http://www.sony.net/Fun/SH/1-7/h7.html |date=August 30, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Mani Madhava Chakyar-Sringara-new.jpg|''Sringāra'' Rasa-abhinaya by Nātyāchārya [[Padma Shri]] [[Māni Mādhava Chākyār]]|thumb|right|250px]] 
'''Sringara''' ({{lang-sa|शृङ्गार}}, {{IAST|śṛṅgāra}}) is one of the nine [[Rasa (aesthetics)|rasas]], usually translated as erotic love, romantic love, or as attraction or beauty. ''Rasa'' means "flavour", and the theory of rasa is the primary concept behind classical [[Indian arts]] including theatre, music, dance, poetry, and sculpture. Much of the content of traditional Indian arts revolves around the relationship between a man and a woman. The primary emotion thus generated is Sringara. The romantic relationship between lover and beloved is a metaphor for the relationship between the individual and the [[divinity|divine]].

Classical theater/dancers (i.e. [[Bharatanatyam]], [[Odissi dance|Odissi]], [[Mohiniyattam]]) refer to Sringara as 'the Mother of all rasas.' Sringara gives scope for a myriad of other emotions including jealousy, fear, anger, compassion, and of course for the expression of physical intimacy. No other Rasa has such a vast scope.

The treatment and performance of Sringara varies on a large scale from the grotesque (as in [[Koodiyattam]]) to very refined and subtle (as in some styles of Bharatanatyam, or in Odissi).

[[Image:Sringara3sm.jpg|left|thumb|Expression of ''Sringāra'' in [[Bharatanatyam]]]]
The attraction between lover and beloved is a metaphor for the relationship between the individual and the [[divinity|divine]], the Nara-Narayana relationship. [[Natya Shastra]] lists Vishnu as the presiding deity of the Sringara rasa.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1023">A '''swami gimmick''' is a prop used in [[magic (illusion)|magic]] and [[mentalism]]. It enables its user to create the [[illusion]] of knowing something in advance under impossible conditions ([[precognition]]), or of being able to read the thoughts of another person ([[telepathy]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[Tony Corinda]], ''[[Thirteen Steps To Mentalism]]''(1968)&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also known as a "nail writer" or "boon writer." It is any device used to covertly write information down for the purpose of creating the illusion of precognition or telepathy. They are commonly available from magic shops, and often consist of a small pencil lead held in a clear plastic sleeve that can be fitted under the thumbnail or over the thumb itself. Modern versions of the swami gimmick allow for the writing to be ink or marker.

It is possible to use the basic method without the manufactured prop by breaking a piece of lead from a pencil tip and wedging it under a thumb nail.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5580">'''TV-Anytime''' is a set of specifications for the controlled delivery of multimedia content to a user's local storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TV-Anytime scope|website=https://tech.ebu.ch/tvascope|publisher=EBU|accessdate=9 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It seeks to exploit the evolution in convenient, high capacity storage of digital information to provide consumers with a highly personalized TV experience. Users will have access to content from a wide variety of sources, tailored to their needs and personal preferences. TV-''Anytime'' specifications are specified by the TV-''Anytime'' Forum.

==The TV-Anytime Forum==
The global TV-Anytime Forum is an association of organizations which seeks to develop specifications to enable audio-visual and other services based on mass-market high volume digital storage in consumer platforms.

It was formed in [[Newport Beach]], [[California]], United States, on 27–29 September 1999 after [[DAVIC]] was closed down.  It was wound up on 27 July 2005 following the publication of RFC 4078 (reference: http://www.tv-anytime.org/).

Its first specifications were published by the [[European Telecommunications Standards Institute]] (ETSI) on August 1, 2003 as TS 102 822-1 '''Broadcast and On-line Services: Search, select, and rightful use of content on personal storage systems'' ("''TV''-Anytime")'.  RFC 4078 (The TV-Anytime [[Content Reference Identifier]] (CRID)) was published in May 2005.

TV-Anytime has more than 60 member companies from Europe (including [[BBC]], [[BSkyB]], [[Canal Plus|Canal+ Technologies]], [[Disney]], [[EBU]], [[Nederlands Omroep Productie Bedrijf (NOB)]] , [[France Telecom]], [[Nokia]], [[Philips]], [[PTT Research ]] , [[Thomson SA|Thomson]]), Asia (including [[ETRI]], [[KETI]], [[NHK]], [[Nippon Telegraph and Telephone|NTT]], [[Dentsu]], [[Hakuhodo]], [[Nippon TV]], [[Sony]], [[Panasonic]], [[LG]], [[Samsung]], [[Sharp Corporation|Sharp]], [[Toshiba]]) and the USA (including [[Motorola]], [[Microsoft]], and [[Nielsen Media Research|Nielsen]]).

==The objectives==
The TV-Anytime Forum has set up the following four objectives for their standardization work:

#Develop specifications that will enable applications to exploit local persistent storage in consumer electronics platforms.
#Be network independent with regard to the means for content delivery to consumer electronics equipment, including various delivery mechanisms (e.g. [[ATSC]], [[Digital Video Broadcasting|DVB]], [[Direct broadcast satellite|DBS]] and others) and the [[Internet]] and enhanced TV.
#Develop specifications for interoperable and integrated systems, from content creators/providers, through service providers, to the consumers.
#Specify the necessary security structures to protect the interests of all parties involved.

==Current status==

Several implementations of the TV-Anytime specifications exist among broadcasters, EPG operators, press guide printers, etc. Early implementations have been done in the field of metadata aggregation. More is coming in the field of hybrid broadcast-broadband delivery.

A licensing program for TV-Anytime was managed by Via Licensing Corporation until early December 2010. More information on known patents of the defunct licensing programme's patent holders, claimed to be essential, is provided on the new TV-Anytime website now officially hosted by EBU.

'''''The Bourne Legacy''''' is a 2012 American [[action film|action]] [[thriller film]] directed by [[Tony Gilroy]], and is the fourth installment in the [[Bourne (film series)|series of films]] adapted from the [[Bourne (novel series)|''Jason Bourne'' novels]] originated by [[Robert Ludlum]] and continued by [[Eric Van Lustbader]], being preceded by ''[[The Bourne Identity (2002 film)|The Bourne Identity]]'' (2002), ''[[The Bourne Supremacy (film)|The Bourne Supremacy]]'' (2004), and ''[[The Bourne Ultimatum (film)|The Bourne Ultimatum]]'' (2007). Although this film has the same title as Van Lustbader's first ''Bourne'' novel, ''[[The Bourne Legacy (novel)|The Bourne Legacy]]'', the actual screenplay bears little resemblance to the novel. Unlike the novel, which features Jason Bourne as the principal character, the film centers on [[Black operation|black ops]] agent Aaron Cross (played by [[Jeremy Renner]]), an original character. In addition to Renner, the film stars [[Rachel Weisz]] and [[Edward Norton]].

The titular character Jason Bourne does not appear in ''The Bourne Legacy'', as actor [[Matt Damon]] chose not to return for the fourth film, due to [[Paul Greengrass]] not directing. Bourne is shown in pictures and mentioned by name several times throughout the film. Tony Gilroy, co-screenwriter of the first three films, sought to continue the story of the film series without changing its key events, and parts of ''The Bourne Legacy'' take place at the same time as the previous film, ''[[The Bourne Ultimatum (film)|The Bourne Ultimatum]]'' (2007).

In ''The Bourne Legacy'', Aaron Cross is a member of a black ops program called Operation Outcome whose subjects are genetically enhanced. He must run for his life once former CIA Treadstone agent [[Jason Bourne]]'s actions lead to the public exposure of Operation Treadstone and its successor Operation Blackbriar.

Filming was primarily in [[New York City]], with some scenes shot in the [[Philippines]], [[South Korea]], [[Pakistan]], and [[Canada]]. Released on {{nowrap|August 10}}, 2012, the film received mixed reviews, with critics praising the story, James Newton Howard's score, and Renner's performance, but expressing disappointment in Matt Damon's absence, as well as the lack of [[shaky camera]] work (a key element of Greengrass' directorial style) that the second and third films had used. The film was followed in 2016 by ''[[Jason Bourne (film)|Jason Bourne]]'', in which Damon and Greengrass reprised their earlier roles.

== Plot ==
Six weeks after [[Jason Bourne]]'s [[The Bourne Supremacy|escape from Moscow]], Aaron Cross ([[Jeremy Renner]]), an operative belonging to a [[United States Department of Defense|Defense Department]] [[black operation|black ops]] program called Operation Outcome, is assigned to [[Alaska]] for a training exercise. He is forced to survive weather extremes and traverse rugged terrain to arrive at a remote cabin as punishment for missing training and going off the grid for four days. The cabin is operated by an exiled Outcome operative, Number Three ([[Oscar Isaac]]), who informs Aaron that he has broken the mission record by two days. As an Outcome operative, Aaron uses experimental pills known as "chems" (chemicals) which enhance the physical and mental abilities of their users.

After the Treadstone and Blackbriar programs are exposed, retired [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] colonel Eric Byer ([[Edward Norton]]) is tasked with containing the fallout. He discovers a potentially scandalous video on the Internet showing a meeting between Treadstone and Outcome medical directors, Albert Hirsch ([[Albert Finney]]) and Dan Hillcott (Neil Brooks Cunningham). To prevent the Senate investigation from learning about Outcome, Byer orders everyone associated with the program killed. He sees the sacrifice as acceptable to protect next-generation "beta programs", including the [[supersoldier]] program LARX.

[[File:MQ-1 Predator unmanned aircraft.jpg|thumb|upright|[[General Atomics MQ-1 Predator|Predator]], an unmanned aerial vehicle like the one featured in ''Legacy'']]

Byer deploys a [[unmanned aerial vehicle|drone]] to eliminate Outcome agents Number Three and Five (Aaron) in Alaska. Aaron evades the drone and force-feeds his [[radio-frequency identification]] to a wolf which is then blown up by a missile, tricking Byer into believing Aaron is dead. Hirsch dies of an apparent heart attack before he can testify before the Senate. At Sterisyn-Morlanta, a biogenetics company supporting Outcome, researcher Dr. Donald Foite ([[Željko Ivanek]]) shoots and kills all but one of his colleagues in the research laboratory. After being cornered by guards, Foite turns his gun on himself, leaving [[biochemist]] Dr. Marta Shearing ([[Rachel Weisz]]) as the sole survivor.  Meanwhile, other Outcome agents are eliminated when their handlers give them poisoned yellow pills disguised as new chems.

Four "D-Track" assassins disguised as federal agents visit Marta at her country house. After she states her belief of Foite having been chemically brainwashed into an emotionless killer, the assassins attempt to fake her suicide, but are killed by Aaron. He saves her life as she is his last link to the chems so that he can retain his enhanced capabilities and avoid withdrawal symptoms. Marta reveals that Cross has been [[Genetic engineering|genetically modified]] by a tailored virus to retain the physical benefits permanently without needing the green chems anymore. He still requires regular doses of blue chems to maintain his intelligence, but he is running out. Aaron confides to her that he is [[Private first class|Private First Class]] Kenneth J. Kitsom (reportedly killed by a [[Improvised explosive device|roadside bomb]] in the [[Iraq War]]) and that his recruiter added twelve points to his IQ, enabling Aaron to meet the [[United States Army]]'s requirements. Without his enhanced intelligence, Aaron believes they stand no chance of survival. Aaron and Marta travel to [[Manila]], where the chems are manufactured, to try to infect him with another virus so he will not need the blue chems and making his new intelligence permanent.

Aaron and Marta bluff their way into the Morlanta Pacific pharmaceutical factory and Marta injects Aaron with the live virus stems. Byer alerts factory security, but Aaron and Marta evade capture. Byer orders LARX-03, a chemically-brainwashed supersoldier, to track and kill them. As Aaron is struck by flu-like symptoms induced by the virus, he hallucinates about his Outcome training. When police surround their shelter while Marta is buying medicine, she warns Aaron by screaming. Aaron rescues her and steals a motorbike. They are pursued by both the police and LARX-03. After a lengthy chase through the streets and marketplaces of Manila to [[Marikina]], they lose the police, but not the assassin. As Aaron, still sick, begins losing consciousness, LARX-03 is killed when Marta causes his motorcycle to crash into a pillar. Marta persuades a Filipino boatman to help them escape by sea.

Back in New York, Blackbriar supervisor Noah Vosen ([[David Strathairn]]) lies to the Senate, stating that Blackbriar was created solely to track down Jason Bourne, and that [[Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency|Deputy Director]] Pamela Landy ([[Joan Allen]]) committed treason by assisting Bourne and trying to sell Treadstone secrets to the press.

== Production ==
Universal Pictures originally intended ''[[The Bourne Ultimatum (film)|The Bourne Ultimatum]]'' to be the final film in the series, but development of another film was under way by October 2008.&lt;ref name="MovesAhead"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117994152.html |title=Universal moves ahead with 'Bourne' |first=Michael |last=Fleming |date=October 16, 2008 |work=Variety |accessdate=October 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Nolfi]], who co-wrote ''The Bourne Ultimatum'', was to write the script of a fourth film, not to be based on any of the novels by Robert Ludlum.&lt;ref name="MovesAhead" /&gt; Joshua Zetumer had been hired to write a parallel script—a draft which could be combined with another (Nolfi's, in this instance)—by August 2009 since Nolfi would be directing ''[[The Adjustment Bureau]]'' that September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kit|first=Borys|title=Next 'Bourne' lands scribe|url=http://www.filmjournal.com/filmjournal/content_display/news-and-features/news/cinemas/e3i7dcd79987813f417ebb342c6c944c9d1|work=Film Journal International|accessdate=July 11, 2012|date=August 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Matt Damon]] stated in November 2009 that no script had been approved and that he hoped that a film would begin shooting in mid-2011.&lt;ref name="JonesTotalFilm"&gt;{{cite news |title=Exclusive Matt Damon Interview |date=November 12, 2009 |url=http://www.totalfilm.com/features/exclusive-matt-damon-interview/page:6 |website=TotalFilm.com |page=6 |accessdate=November 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next month, he said that he would not do another Bourne film without Paul Greengrass, who announced in late November that he had decided not to return as director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hollywoodinsider.ew.com/2009/12/04/matt-damon-on-bourne-4-i-wouldnt-do-it-without-paul-greengrass |title=Matt Damon on 'Bourne 4': 'I wouldn't do it without Paul Greengrass' |last=Sperling |first=Nicole |date=December 4, 2009 |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |accessdate=December 5, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091206115237/http://hollywoodinsider.ew.com/2009/12/04/matt-damon-on-bourne-4-i-wouldnt-do-it-without-paul-greengrass/ |archivedate=December 6, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2010, Damon said that there would "probably be a prequel of some kind with another actor and another director before we do another one just because I think we're probably another five years away from doing it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Will The Next Bourne Be A Prequel? |url=http://www.empireonline.com/news/story.asp?NID=26881 |accessdate=June 30, 2010 |work=Empire |date=February 1, 2010 |first=Chris |last=Hewitt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it was reported in June 2010 that [[Tony Gilroy]], who co-wrote each of the three previous ''Bourne'' films, would be writing a script with his brother, screenwriter [[Dan Gilroy]], for a fourth ''Bourne'' film to be released sometime in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Tony Gilroy penning a fourth 'Bourne' script |url=http://hollywoodinsider.ew.com/2010/06/09/tony-gilroy-penning-fourth-bourne-script |accessdate=June 30, 2010 |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=June 9, 2010 |first=Nicole |last=Sperling |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615004418/http://hollywoodinsider.ew.com/2010/06/09/tony-gilroy-penning-fourth-bourne-script/ |archivedate=June 15, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  That October, Universal set the release date for ''The Bourne Legacy'' for August 10, 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=71268 |title=Universal Sets Release Dates Through 2013 |date=October 29, 2010 |accessdate=October 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tony Gilroy was confirmed as the director of the film, and it was also announced that Jason Bourne will not be appearing in ''The Bourne Legacy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news-briefs.ew.com/2010/10/11/no-matt-damon-in-bourne-legacy |title=No Matt Damon in Bourne Legacy |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |accessdate=October 11, 2010 |date=October 11, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204145818/http://news-briefs.ew.com/2010/10/11/no-matt-damon-in-bourne-legacy/ |archivedate=February 4, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gilroy said he did not get involved with the project "until the rules were that Matt [Damon] was gone, Matt and Paul [Greenglass] were gone, there was no Jason Bourne. That was the given when I had the first conversation about this. So it was very important to me, extremely important to me, that everything that had happened before be well preserved and be enhanced if possible by what we're doing now."&lt;ref name="Weintraub"&gt;{{cite web|last=Weintraub|first=Steve|title=Writer/Director Tony Gilroy Talks THE BOURNE LEGACY, Deleted Scenes, the Franchise Going Forward, His Thoughts on IMAX and More|url=http://collider.com/tony-gilroy-the-bourne-legacy-interview/187798/|work=Collider|accessdate=September 4, 2012|date=August 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also said, "you could never replace Matt [Damon] as Jason Bourne. This isn't [[James Bond in film|James Bond]]. You can't do a [[prequel]]. You can't do any of those kinds of things, because there was never any cynicism attached to the franchise, and that was the one thing they had to hang on to."&lt;ref name="Hornaday"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hornaday|first=Ann|title=Tony Gilroy talks about the fractious, entertaining, lucrative ride of ‘Bourne’|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/tony-gilroy-talks-about-the-fractious-entertaining-lucrative-wild-ride-of-bourne/2012/08/09/b38f4af4-e0be-11e1-a19c-fcfa365396c8_story.html|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=September 5, 2012|date=August 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gilroy "never had any intention of ever coming back to this realm at all—much less write it, much less direct it. Then I started a really casual conversation about what we could do in a post-Jason Bourne setting. I was only supposed to come in for two weeks, but the character we came up with, Aaron Cross, was so compelling."&lt;ref name="Abrahams"&gt;{{cite web|last=Abrahams|first=Stephanie|title=Director Tony Gilroy on the 'Epic' Bourne Legacy|url=http://entertainment.time.com/2012/08/08/bourne-director-tony-gilroy-on-why-legacy-is-the/|work=Time|accessdate=September 4, 2012|date=August 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After watching ''The Bourne Ultimatum'' again, Gilroy called his brother, screenwriter Dan Gilroy, and said, {{" '}}The only thing you could do is sort of pull back the curtain and say there's a much bigger conspiracy.' So we had to deal with what happened in ''Ultimatum'' as the starting point of this film. ''Ultimatum'' plays in the shadows of ''Legacy'' for the first 15 minutes—they overlap."&lt;ref name="Abrahams"/&gt;

In speaking about the film's storyline, Gilroy drew a distinction between the fictional programs in the ''Bourne'' film series:
{{Quote|On a practical level, the Treadstone program was about assassination. They're basically assassins. They live in the world—you can see Clive Owen [in ''The Bourne Identity''] as a piano teacher, they have covers—but they're essentially assassins. There was nothing that would be described as espionage, [they're] basically a kill squad. The Outcome program that Aaron [played by Jeremy Renner] is part of, [Oscar Isaac's character] is one of them too... The conceit is that [Edward Norton's character] is the mastermind of this entire franchise. We're stepping back a little bit in time here, he's been a developer, he's been at the nexus of the corporate military and intelligence communities. There's a very large corporate element, pharmaceutical corporate element...&lt;ref name="Perez"&gt;{{cite web|last=Perez|first=Rodrigo|title=Interview: Tony Gilroy Talks The Challenges Of Mounting 'The Bourne Legacy,' Addresses The 'Enhancement' Concerns &amp; More|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/interview-tony-gilroy-talks-the-challenges-of-mounting-the-bourne-legacy-addresses-the-enhancement-concerns-more-20120809?page=1|work=The Playlist|accessdate=September 4, 2012|date=August 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Although a large part of the film was set in and around Washington, DC, the real DC appears only in aerial [[establishing shot]]s.

The site's critical consensus reads, "It isn't quite as compelling as the earlier trilogy, but ''The Bourne Legacy'' proves the franchise has stories left to tell—and benefits from Jeremy Renner's magnetic work in the starring role."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_bourne_legacy/|title=The Bourne Legacy|website=rottentomatoes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film has a score of 61 out of 100 based on 42 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-bourne-legacy/critic-reviews|title=The Bourne Legacy|website=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=August 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of "B" on an A+ to F scale.&lt;ref name="CinemaScore"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://m.cinemascore.com|title=CinemaScore|accessdate=August 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lisa Schwarzbaum]] of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave the film an A-, commenting that "Gilroy, who as a screenwriter has shaped the movie saga from the beginning, trades the wired rhythms established in the past two episodes by Paul Greengrass for something more realistic and closer to the ground. The change is refreshing. Jason Bourne's legacy is in good hands."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20483133_20589882,00.html|title='The Bourne Legacy' Review|author=Schwarzbaum, Lisa|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=August 8, 2012|accessdate=August 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave the film 2½ stars out of 4, writing: "''The Bourne Legacy'' is always gripping in the moment. The problem is in getting the moments to add up. I freely confess that for at least the first 30 minutes I had no clear idea of why anything was happening. The dialogue is concise, the cinematography is arresting and the plot is a murky muddle."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-bourne-legacy-2012|last=Ebert|first=Roger|title=The Bourne Legacy Movie Review (2012)|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|date=August 8, 2012|accessdate=July 28, 2016}}]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Peter Debruge of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote that "the combination of Robert Elswit's elegant widescreen lensing and the measured editing by Tony Gilroy's brother John may be easier to absorb than Greengrass' hyperkinetic docu-based style, but the pic's convoluted script ensures that auds will emerge no less overwhelmed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117948003?refcatid=31|title=Variety Reviews: 'The Bourne Legacy'|author=Debruge, Peter|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=August 6, 2012|accessdate=August 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Atkinson of ''[[The Village Voice]]'' also wrote a scathing review of the film, saying: "The ''Bourne'' films have more than just overstayed their welcome and outlasted the Ludlum books—they've been [[Van Halen]]ized, with an abrupt change of frontman and a resulting dip in personality."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2012-08-08/film/the-bourne-legacy-who-s-the-new-guy|title='The Bourne Legacy': Who's the New Guy?|author=Atkinson, Michael|work=[[The Village Voice]]|date=August 8, 2012|accessdate=August 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kenneth Turan]] of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' gave the film a positive review, called the film "an exemplary espionage thriller that has a strong sense of what it wants to accomplish and how best to get there." He especially commended Gilroy's work on the film: "Gilroy knows the underpinnings of this world inside out and appreciates how essential it is to maintain and extend the house style of cool and credible intelligence that marked the previous films."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-bourne-legacy-review-20120810,0,3228287.story|title=Review: 'The Bourne Legacy' lives up to its predecessors|first=Kenneth|last=Turan|date=August 9, 2012|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=August 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Todd McCarthy]] of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' commented on his review that "the series' legacy is lessened by this capable but uninspired fourth episode."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com//review/bourne-legacy-jeremy-renner-rachel-weisz-358482|title='The Bourne Legacy': Film Review|last1=McCarthy |first1=Todd|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=August 6, 2012|accessdate=August 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Universal Pictures]] stated at a media conference in [[Los Angeles, California]], that they are likely to release more ''Bourne'' films, despite ''The Bourne Legacy'' being given mixed reviews by critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-19597043|title=Bourne Legacy sequel confirmed|work=BBC News|date=September 14, 2012|accessdate=August 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a December 2012 interview, [[Matt Damon]] revealed that he and [[Paul Greengrass]] were interested in returning for the next film as Jason Bourne and the director, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://movies.msn.com/movies/article.aspx?news=780494&amp;ocid=rr-mov-news|title=Matt Damon: Door is still open for more 'Bourne'|website=MSN|date=December 16, 2012|accessdate=August 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Damon is reported saying that although he had not seen ''Legacy'', he intends to do so because not only is he curious to see it, but also because he has enjoyed Jeremy Renner in everything he has seen him in. However, as of June 2014, executive producer Frank Marshall said that Matt Damon will not be returning to the big screen for the next ''Bourne'' film, contrary to earlier statements made by Damon and rumors surrounding his return to the franchise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/553199/matt-damon-not-coming-back-for-next-bourne-movie |title=Matt Damon Not Coming Back for Next Bourne Movie |website=E!

==Critical reception==
''The Square'' received universal acclaim, currently holding a 100% "fresh" rating on review aggregator website [[Rotten Tomatoes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{rotten-tomatoes|771363914|The Square}} Retrieved January 28, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film has an 84/100 rating, indicating "universal acclaim".&lt;ref&gt;{{metacritic film|the-square-2013|The Square}} Retrieved July 18, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

A.O. Scott of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote, "''The Square'', while it records the gruesome collision of utopian aspirations with cold political realities, is not a despairing film. It concludes on a note of resolve grounded in the acknowledgment that historical change can be a long, slow process."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Scott |first=A.

''[[The Chicago Tribune]]'' described it as "A compelling inside look at the cascading series of revolutions and counterrevolutions that have shaken Egypt since the beginning of 2011."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Turan |first=Kenneth |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/chi-square-review-0117-20140116,0,7541213.story |title=Documentary The Square, nominated for an Oscar, details life in an Egyptian crossroads |work=Chicago Tribune |date=February 11, 2011 |accessdate=January 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Washington Post]]'' described it as "elegantly shot and structured, but infused with rough, spontaneous energy; global in its consciousness but intimate in its approach; carefully pitched but emotionally wrenching; deeply troubling but ultimately exhilarating."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hornaday|first=Ann|title='The Square' movie review: An exhilarating portrait of Egyptian politics|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/goingoutguide/movies/the-square-movie-review-an-exhilarating-portrait-of-egyptian-politics/2014/01/15/692ff142-7d49-11e3-93c1-0e888170b723_story.html|accessdate=February 6, 2014|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=January 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for ''[[Bright Lights Film Journal]]'', Gregory Stephens suggests the film soberly "confirms that only rarely do revolutions 'jump their tracks' so that a new script can be written. ... This disaffection, both spontaneous and stylized, makes good copy, and good theatre. On whether or not it can lead to a new script of how government 'of the people' serves the often conflicting interests of its citizens, the jury is still out."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Stephens|first=Gregory|title=Recording the Rhythm of Change: A Rhetoric of Revolution in ''The Square'' |url=http://brightlightsfilm.com/recording-rhythm-change-rhetoric-revolution-square/|accessdate=May 7, 2014|work=Bright Lights Film Journal|date=May 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Story of My Life''''' is a [[musical theatre|musical]] with music and lyrics by [[Neil Bartram]], and a book by [[Brian Hill (author)|Brian Hill]].  The show follows two childhood friends from age six to 35 and has only two characters.

The musical debuted at [[Canadian Stage Company]] in Toronto in 2006 starring [[Brent Carver]] and [[Jeffrey Kuhn]] and premiered on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in February 2009, closing after nineteen previews and five regular performances.

==The Story==
The musical follows a lifelong friendship between two men, Alvin and Thomas, whose childhood bond continues throughout their adult years. Amazon.com describes the musical as "an authentic and affecting work, told through a series of songs in turn playful, touching and dramatic, and expertly orchestrated by [[Jonathan Tunick]]. One New York critic predicted, 'When the original cast recording comes out, see if you don't find yourself moved to Google the name of some long-lost friend with whom you simply lost touch. ''The Story Of My Life'' inspires us to reconnect with those who were part of the earliest chapters of our own life stories'."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.broadwayworld.com/article/THE_STORY_OF_MY_LIFE_Cast_Recording_Released_62_Now_Avaliable_For_Preorder_20090505 "Cast Recording Released 6/2, Now {{sic|nolink=y|Avaliable}} For Pre-order"] broadwayworld.com, May 5, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Summary'''

Thomas stands alone, contemplating how to write his eulogy for his best friend Alvin's funeral. He comes to the conclusion that it should be about his life with Alvin ("Write What You Know") but cannot bring himself to write anything down. He is then visited by the ghost of Alvin, who tells him that they will write story after story about their childhood, until Thomas has completed the eulogy. Alvin walks around the room and removes stories from the room’s bookshelves, which make up the musical’s remaining songs.

Starting at the beginning of their friendship, Alvin recalls their meeting in "Mrs. Remington('s)" first-grade class where Alvin was the only student to recognize that Thomas was dressed as Clarence (from ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]'') for Halloween. The two became inseparable, with Thomas spending more and more time with Alvin in his father’s bookstore. Alvin gives Thomas “The Greatest Gift” of a copy of ''[[The Adventures of Tom Sawyer]]'', which inspires Thomas’ sixth-grade book report (“1876”). This book report inspired Thomas to be a writer and, outside the story, Thomas tries to pull the focus back to writing Alvin’s eulogy.

Alvin removes a story from the shelf, which is about his abnormal tendencies and Thomas’ attempts to reign them in (“Normal”). The story ends with a group of bullies throwing Alvin’s bathrobe, which belonged to his deceased mother, over a bridge. Alvin is sad but hopeful that “People Carry On” after a loss. In another story, Thomas reads his college entrance essay on the [[Butterfly effect|Butterfly Effect]] (“The Butterfly”) to Alvin. Thomas is accepted into college and leaves Alvin, who is now working at his father’s bookstore, behind (“Saying Goodbye, Part 1”). When Thomas comes home for Christmas, he talks about his creative process; this bores Alvin, who wants to play in the snow as they did when they were young (“Here’s Where It Begins”).

Thomas leaves, graduates, and becomes a semi-famous writer. When he returns home again, he brings home his “colleague, girlfriend, and number-one fan” Anne. Alvin worries that Anne will draw Thomas away from him and seems sad about his life in the bookstore, which he assumes ownership of after his father gets sick (“Saying Goodbye, Part 2”). Thomas returns home to help Alvin with the paperwork to finish the transfer of ownership. Alvin asks Thomas to stay in town with him, but Thomas invites Alvin to join him in the city instead (“Independence Day”). After receiving many excited phone calls from Alvin, Thomas tells him that he shouldn’t come after all because it’s “not a good time,” and then breaks up with Anne (“I Like It Here”).

Thomas doesn’t tell Alvin about the break-up, and tries to “streamline his personal life” to avoid writer’s block. Alvin writes Thomas from the bookstore to congratulate him on his continued success (“You’re Amazing, Tom”). Thomas ignores the letters and stops coming home, suffering from writer’s block while writing about the angles in the snow (“Nothing There”).

Thomas goes home yet again and sneaks in to watch Alvin deliver the eulogy at his father’s funeral, which is made up of “story after story after story.” Thomas is mad that Alvin is at ease telling the stories and, in retrospect, recognizes that he didn’t see the struggles Alvin faced at the time (“I Didn’t See Alvin”). Thomas notes that this was the last time he saw Alvin alive.

After finishing the story of his father’s eulogy, Alvin attempts one last time to bring Thomas back to writing the eulogy for his own funeral (“This Is It”). Thomas finally sits and finishes his “work in progress” about their childhood Christmas traditions (“Angels in the Snow”), and finally delivers his eulogy—a collection of stories—for Alvin.

[[Ben Brantley]], in a review in ''[[The New York Times]]'', wrote that "In addition to jettisoning the usual excesses of tourist-trapping extravaganzas, they have tossed away such niceties as originality, credibility, tension and excitement...Mr. Chase and Mr. Gets sing and act with winning (and, under the circumstances, merciful) restraint."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Brantley |first=Ben |url=http://theater.nytimes.com/2009/02/20/theater/reviews/20stor.html |title=Male Bonding: It’s a Wonderful Friendship |work=The New York Times |date=February 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael Kuchwara, in his ''Associated Press'' review, wrote "The Story of My Life is a heartfelt little musical that has the courage of its sweet-tempered, low-key convictions. These days, that's a novelty. In a Broadway world of big musicals determined to sell themselves, this gentle new show celebrates softly but with an emotional pull that slowly wins you over."&lt;ref&gt;Kuchwara, Michael.[http://www.foxnews.com/wires/2009Feb19/0,4670,TheaterReviewStoryofMyLife,00.html Review: Friendship flowers in 'Story of My Life'] foxnews.com (AP), February 19, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

NY1's Roma Torre said "Partners Neil Bartram, who wrote the music and lyrics, and Brian Hill, who wrote the obviously Sondheim-inspired book, fine-tuned this work with a keen insight for those seemingly inconsequential moments in relationships that turn out to be magically momentous. Bartram's lovely songs resonate on many levels, while Richard Maltby Jr. adds further dimension with his sharply-etched direction. Will Chase as Thomas and Malcolm Gets as Alvin are exceptionally talented. So perfectly matched in ways both subtle and large, they deliver splendidly calibrated performances that are simply flawless....This is an impressive collaborative effort that, despite its minimalism, has the power to pack quite an emotional punch."&lt;ref&gt;Torre, Roma.[http://www.ny1.com/content/ny1_living/theater_reviews/94270/ny1-theater-review---the-story-of-my-life- "NY1 Theater Review"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121004003332/http://www.ny1.com/content/ny1_living/theater_reviews/94270/ny1-theater-review---the-story-of-my-life- |date=2012-10-04 }} ny1.com&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Trump-Tower-3.jpg|thumb|alt=View of the facade of Trump Tower.|[[Trump Tower]]|600x600px]]
On March 4, 2017, [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Donald Trump]] wrote a series of posts on [[Donald Trump on social media|his Twitter account]] that accused former President [[Barack Obama]] of [[Telephone tapping|wiretapping]] his phones at his [[Trump Tower]] office late in the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 presidential campaign]]. Trump called for a congressional investigation into the matter, and the Trump administration cited news reports to defend these accusations.

Representative [[Devin Nunes]], who chairs the [[United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence|House Intelligence Committee]], vowed to investigate the claim. At a House Intelligence Committee open hearing on March 20, 2017, [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) Director [[James Comey]] stated that neither the FBI nor the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] (DOJ) possessed any information to support Donald Trump's wiretapping allegations. Nunes stated on March 23 that the Trump administration's communications might have been legally monitored during the [[Presidential transition of Donald Trump|transition period]] as part of an "[[incidental collection]]".&lt;ref name="AP1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/8f45d6141e4e4cce86024af85841a9f7|title=Spying claim by Intel chair renews fight over Russia probe|publisher=Associated Press|date=March 22, 2017|access-date=March 23, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170324020019/http://bigstory.ap.org/8f45d6141e4e4cce86024af85841a9f7|archive-date=March 24, 2017|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DOJ declared in a September 1, 2017 court filing that "both the FBI and [[United States Department of Justice National Security Division|NSD]] confirm that they have no records related to wiretaps as described by the March 4, 2017 tweets,"&lt;ref name="Justice Department"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Burleigh|first=Nina|url=http://www.newsweek.com/trump-russia-investigation-wiretap-fbi-obama-658888|title=Trump's Claim That Obama Wiretapped His Campaign Is False: U.S. Department of Justice|work=[[Newsweek]]|date=September 2, 2017|accessdate=September 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and confirmed this in another court filing of October 19, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lawandcrime.com/high-profile/trump-admin-says-there-is-no-evidence-obama-wiretapped-trump/|title=Trump Admin Says There is No Evidence Obama Wiretapped Trump|website=lawandcrime.com|accessdate=October 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 19, 2017  [[CNN]] reported that the FBI wiretapped [[Paul Manafort]] before and after the presidential election, extending into early 2017, although the report did not make clear whether Manafort was monitored during his tenure with the Trump campaign from March through August 2016. The CNN report also stated that the Manafort surveillance began after he became the subject of an FBI investigation in 2014.  Some commentators cited this report as vindication for Trump's claims, while others noted that it did not confirm the accuracy of Trump's original tweets, and that it is still unknown whether any surveillance of Manafort took place at Trump Tower.&lt;ref name="Manafort wiretap"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fox Vindicated?"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Graham Not Vindicated"/&gt; Manafort owned a condominium in Trump Tower from 2006 until its seizure by federal authorities following his 2018 convictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/06/paul-manaforts-trump-tower-condo-the-latest-issue-for-prosecutors.html|title=Paul Manafort's Trump Tower condo becomes the latest sticking point for prosecutors|first=Christina|last=Wilkie|date=November 6, 2017|publisher=|accessdate=October 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2018/10/05/655007793/feds-move-to-take-paul-manaforts-trump-tower-condo|title=Feds Move To Take Paul Manafort's Trump Tower Condo|publisher=|accessdate=October 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 7, 2016, [[Louise Mensch]] reported&lt;ref name="HeatStreet"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://heatst.com/world/exclusive-fbi-granted-fisa-warrant-covering-trump-camps-ties-to-russia/ |title=EXCLUSIVE: FBI 'Granted FISA Warrant' Covering Trump Camp's Ties To Russia |publisher=HeatStreet |accessdate=September 20, 2017 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161108195626/https://heatst.com/world/exclusive-fbi-granted-fisa-warrant-covering-trump-camps-ties-to-russia/ |archivedate=November 8, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the right-leaning&lt;ref name="HtStreetcopypasta"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2017/03/05/trumps-evidence-for-obama-wiretap-claims-relies-on-sketchy-anonymously-sourced-reports/|title=Trump's 'evidence' for Obama wiretap claims relies on sketchy, anonymously sourced reports|date=March 5, 2017|last1=Kessler|first1=Glenn|accessdate=March 8, 2017|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Heat Street]]'', that the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) had twice sought [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act]] (FISA) warrants in connection with its investigation of the Trump campaign's links to Russia. According to Mensch, the first request for a warrant which "named Trump" was denied in June 2016 and, a second, more "narrowly drawn" request was granted in October 2016. Mensch wrote that this warrant gave "counter-intelligence permission to examine the activities of 'U.S. persons' in Donald Trump's campaign with ties to Russia," and to "look at the full content of emails and other related documents that may concern US persons". Mensch further claimed that the October warrant was granted in "connection with the investigation of suspected activity between the server [in Trump Tower] and two banks, SVB Bank and Alfa Bank," and that "it is thought in the intelligence community that the warrant covers any 'US person' connected to this investigation, and thus covers Donald Trump and at least three further men." Mensch's article cited reports from two anonymous "sources with links to the counter-intelligence community."&lt;ref name="HeatStreet" /&gt;

On January 19, ''[[The New York Times]]'' published an article&lt;ref name="Trump Russia Investigation"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Michael S.

Trump, including his former campaign chairman [[Paul Manafort]]."  The article also noted the uncertainty regarding the scope of the wiretapping, stating: "It is not clear whether the intercepted communications had anything to do with Mr. Trump's campaign, or Mr. Trump himself."&lt;ref name="Trump Russia Investigation" /&gt;

On March 3, ''[[Breitbart News]]'' ran an article by [[Joel Pollak]] headlined "[[Mark Levin]] to Congress: Investigate Obama's 'Silent Coup' vs. Trump." On the previous day, right-wing radio personality Mark Levin alleged that Obama and his allies were conducting a "silent coup" against Trump, and asked: "How many phone calls of Donald Trump, if any, have been intercepted by the administration and recorded by the Obama administration?"&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2017/03/06/media/mark-levin-joel-pollak-breitbart-trump-obama/index.html|title=Trump's wiretap claim: How a conspiracy theory got its start |last=Stelter |first=Brian |date=March 6, 2017 |website=CNNMoney |access-date=March 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-pol-trump-wiretap-conspiracy-20170322-story.html |title=How the phony conspiracy theory over wiretapping caught fire |last=Finnegan |first=Michael |date=March 22, 2017 |work=Los Angeles Times |access-date=April 4, 2017 |last2=Barabak |first2=Mark Z. |language=en-US |issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Breitbart'' article alleged that "the Obama administration is now monitoring an opposing presidential campaign using the high-tech surveillance powers of the federal intelligence services".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Citing Mensch's November article, ''Breitbart'' claimed the existence of a June FISA request "to monitor communications involving Donald Trump and several advisers", and of an October FISA warrant "focused on a computer server in Trump Tower." Breitbart cited a January 11 ''[[National Review]]'' article,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/443768/obama-fisa-trump-wiretap|title=FISA and the Trump Team|authorlink=Andrew C. McCarthy|last=McCarthy|first=Andrew C.|date=January 11, 2017|work=National Review|access-date=March 22, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; which speculated about alleged "wiretaps" of the Trump campaign and their legal ramifications. Like the ''Breitbart'' article,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; the ''National Review'' article had also extensively relied on Mensch's piece.&lt;ref name="HtStreetcopypasta" /&gt;

Both ''McClatchy'' and BBC reported on the existence of an October FISA warrant, as did Mensch. However, these accounts differed substantially from Mensch's story with respect to the scope and purpose of the warrant. They alleged that the October warrant authorized to monitor financial transactions related to Russia — not communications.&lt;ref name="HtStreetcopypasta" /&gt; Unlike the derivative accounts in ''National Review'' and ''Breitbart'',&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HtStreetcopypasta" /&gt; Mensch's original article did not use the term "wiretap" (implying voice telephone calls), but only made claims about e-mail exchanged with [[Silicon Valley Bank|SVB Bank]] and the Russian [[Alfa-Bank]].&lt;ref name="HtStreetcopypasta" /&gt; While Mensch did claim the e-mail server was located in Trump Tower, it was likely located in [[Lititz, Pennsylvania]], as Trump outsourced e-mail to Listrak, which operates out of a [[data center]] there.&lt;ref name=Filkins2018.10.15&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/10/15/was-there-a-connection-between-a-russian-bank-and-the-trump-campaign |title=Was There a Connection Between a Russian Bank and the Trump Campaign?

Contrary to ''The Times'', Mensch claimed that the server's activity remained suspicious enough to lead the FBI to request the FISA warrant.&lt;ref name="HtStreetcopypasta" /&gt;&lt;ref name="British Lawmaker"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/the-former-british-lawmaker-at-the-heart-of-the-trump-wiretap-allegations/2017/03/06/9d8c6b94-027c-11e7-9d14-9724d48f5666_story.html|title=This former British lawmaker is at the heart of the Trump wiretap allegations|last=Adam|first=Karla|date=March 6, 2017|newspaper=The Washington Post|accessdate=March 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Breitbart'' article was subsequently circulated among White House staffers, and was reportedly given to Trump on the following day, together with his morning newspapers and printouts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HtStreetcopypasta" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://apnews.com/eae4bee334fb4e358bfb1217d3e0ee74/Media-the-enemy?-Trump-is-sure-an-insatiable-consumer|title=Media the enemy?

=== Followup ===
The White House claimed that reports "from BBC, ''Heat Street'', ''New York Times'', Fox News, among others" established the president's wiretapping allegation, providing links of these to ''The Washington Post''.&lt;ref name="British Lawmaker" /&gt;

In a statement issued through press secretary [[Sean Spicer]] on March 5, Trump asked congressional intelligence committees to "determine whether executive branch investigative powers were abused in 2016" as part of their investigation into [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections|Russian interference in the election]].&lt;ref name="Comey refute"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Michael S.

White House officials gave discordant responses to initial media inquiries about Trump's accusations. Spicer banned cameras in the briefing room at a press conference the following day. White House counselor [[Kellyanne Conway]] told [[Fox News]]'s ''[[Fox &amp; Friends]]'' that the president had "information and intelligence that the rest of us do not," although Spicer later said Conway was not qualified to make that claim.&lt;ref name="Clapper Meet the Press"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Ashley Parker|author2=Jenna Johnson|title=White House aides struggle to defend Trump wiretap claims|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/white-house-aides-contort-themselves-trying-to-defend-trump-wiretap-claims/2017/03/06/fef6e368-02aa-11e7-ad5b-d22680e18d10_story.html|accessdate=March 8, 2017|work=The Washington Post|date=March 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Extension of claim ==
During an interview on March 12, Conway told [[The Record (Bergen County)|''The Record'']]'s [[Mike Kelly (journalist)|Mike Kelly]] that the surveillance could have potentially used hacked electronic devices: "You can surveil someone through their phones, certainly through their television sets — any number of ways." She also suggested that Trump could have been monitored with "microwaves that turn into cameras."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.northjersey.com/story/news/columnists/mike-kelly/2017/03/12/mike-kelly-conway-suggests-even-wider-surveillance-trump-campaign/99060910/|title=Kellyanne Conway alludes to even wider surveillance of Trump campaign|work=North Jersey|access-date=March 13, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conway later retracted the claim, stating that "I'm not [[Inspector Gadget#Inspector Gadget|Inspector Gadget]], I don't believe that people are using the microwave to spy on the Trump campaign."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/kellyanne-conway-dont-believe-microwaves-used-spy-trump-campaign-surveillance-inspector-gadget-2017-3|title='I'm not Inspector Gadget': Kellyanne Conway refutes claims that she suggested Trump's team may have been spied on with microwaves|work=Business Insider|access-date=March 14, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a March 13 press briefing, Spicer claimed that Trump was referring to general surveillance rather than direct wiretapping.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/spicer-trump-talking-general-surveillance-wiretapping-tweets/story?id=46101282|title=Trump was talking about general surveillance in wiretapping claims, Spicer says|last=Keneally|first=Meghan|date=March 13, 2017|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=March 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spicer also said that the White House believed that the [[Obama administration]] was responsible for the surveillance, not Obama himself, said Trump's tweet which specifically named the former president.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/sean-spicer-trump-doesnt-really-think-obama-ordered-wiretap-2017-3|title=Sean Spicer says Trump 'doesn't really think' Obama 'personally' wiretapped Trump|work=Business Insider|accessdate=March 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a March 15 interview with [[Tucker Carlson]] on Fox News, Trump supported his claims of wiretapping by citing a March 3 interview with [[Paul Ryan]] on an episode of ''[[Special Report (Fox News program)|Special Report with Bret Baier]]'' on Fox News and the January 19 ''New York Times'' article.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; While ''The New York Times'' article&lt;ref name="Trump Russia Investigation" /&gt; mentioned "wiretapping" and reported that the FBI was "examining intercepted communications and financial transactions", it stipulated neither the targeting of American citizens for surveillance, nor any involvement in such surveillance by the Obama administration.

Ryan responded: "Well, again, like I said, none of us in Congress or anybody I know in Congress has been presented with anything to the contrary of what you just said." However, there may have been a misunderstanding between Baier and Ryan throughout the interview, with Baier asking about undue surveillance of the Trump campaign, and Ryan responding that intelligence gathering had produced no evidence of collusion between Russia and Trump. Ryan stated, in response to a question about Trump's March 15 comments,  that he had been unaware of any wiretapping allegations prior to his interview with Baier, and that "the intelligence committees&amp;nbsp;... have determined&amp;nbsp;... that no such wiretap existed."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/trump-wiretap-paul-ryan-bret-baier-fox-news-2017-3|title=Trump suggests little-noticed interview between Fox News host and Paul Ryan helped fuel his explosive wiretap claims|work=Business Insider|access-date=March 21, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a March 14 ''Fox &amp; Friends'' interview, [[Andrew Napolitano]] said that "Three intelligence sources have informed Fox News that President Obama went outside the chain of command," using the British [[Government Communications Headquarters]] (GCHQ) to implement surveillance to avoid leaving "American fingerprints."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://insider.foxnews.com/2017/03/14/judge-napolitano-why-there-may-never-be-proof-even-if-obama-spied-trump|title=Judge Nap: Obama 'Went Outside Chain of Command,' Used British Spy Agency to Surveil Trump|last=|first=|date=March 14, 2017|publisher=Fox News|access-date=March 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Napolitano accused [[Robert Hannigan]], who resigned from the GCHQ on January 23, of ordering the wiretap.

On March 16, Spicer repeated Napolitano's claim at a White House press briefing. The following day, GCHQ responded with a rare public statement: "Recent allegations made by media commentator Judge Andrew Napolitano about GCHQ being asked to conduct 'wiretapping' against the then president-elect are nonsense.

On April 12, 2017, ''The Guardian'' reported that GCHQ (and other European intelligence agencies) had intercepted communications between members of the Trump campaign team and Russian officials, and shared the intelligence with their US counterparts. The communications were obtained through "incidental collection" as part of routine surveillance of Russian intelligence assets, not from a targeted operation against Trump or his campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/apr/13/british-spies-first-to-spot-trump-team-links-russia|title=British spies were first to spot Trump team's links with Russia|last=Harding|first=Luke|date=April 13, 2017|work=The Guardian|access-date=May 12, 2017|last2=Kirchgaessner|first2=Stephanie|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|last3=Hopkins|first3=Nick}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/04/13/politics/trump-russia-british-intelligence/index.html|title=British intelligence passed Trump associates' communications with Russians on to US counterparts|author1=Jim Sciutto |author2=Pamela Brown |author3=Eric Bradner|publisher=CNN|access-date=May 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Surveillance of Trump associates ===

==== Reports ====
On January 11, 2017, ''[[The Guardian]]'' reported&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/10/fbi-chief-given-dossier-by-john-mccain-alleging-secret-trump-russia-contacts|title=John McCain passes dossier alleging secret Trump-Russia contacts to FBI|last=Borger|first=Julian|date=January 11, 2017|work=The Guardian|access-date=March 19, 2017|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the FBI initially applied for a FISA warrant in June 2016, requesting to "monitor four members of the Trump team suspected of irregular contacts with Russian officials." This initial request was denied. A source told ''The Guardian'' that the FBI then submitted a more narrowly focused request in October, "but that has not been confirmed, and it is not clear whether any warrant led to a full investigation." ''The Guardian'' article was not cited by the [[White House Press Secretary|White House]] in connection with Trump's wiretapping claim.&lt;ref name="HtStreetcopypasta" /&gt;

The day after ''The Guardian'' report, ''[[BBC]]'' journalist [[Paul Wood (journalist)|Paul Wood]] separately reported that, in response to an April 2016 tip from a foreign intelligence agency to the CIA about "money from the Kremlin going into the US presidential campaign", a joint task force had been established including representatives of the FBI, the [[US Department of the Treasury|Department of the Treasury]], the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] (DOJ), the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA), the [[Office of the Director of National Intelligence]] (ODNI) and the NSA; and in June 2016 lawyers from the FBI had applied to the FISA court for "permission to intercept the electronic records from two Russian banks." The BBC alleged that the investigation was prompted in April 2016 by a "tip" from an intelligence agency of one of the [[Baltic states|Baltic States]]. According to Wood, this application was rejected, as was a more narrowly focused request in July, and the order was finally granted by a different FISA judge on October 15, three weeks before the presidential election. According to the article, the warrant did not name Trump or his associates.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite web|title=Trump 'compromising' claims: How and why did we get here?|author=Paul Wood|work=BBC|date=January 12, 2017|accessdate=March 7, 2017|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-38589427}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 18, [[The McClatchy Company|''McClatchy'']] separately&lt;ref name="HtStreetcopypasta" /&gt; reported&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/article127231799.html|title=FBI, 5 other agencies probe possible covert Kremlin aid to Trump|work=mcclatchydc|access-date=March 22, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; that "the FBI had obtained a warrant on Oct. 15 from the highly secretive Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court allowing investigators access to bank records and other documents about potential payments and money transfers related to Russia." The ''McClatchy'' article was not cited by the [[White House Press Secretary|White House]] in connection with Trump's wiretapping claim.&lt;ref name="HtStreetcopypasta" /&gt;

In April 2017, ''The Washington Post'' initially reported that the FBI secured a FISA warrant to monitor Trump campaign associate [[Carter Page]] in the summer of 2016 — later corrected to October 2016, one month after Page had left the Trump campaign. The warrant was reportedly based on the possibility that Page was acting as an agent of a foreign government, i.e., Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Nakashima |first1=Ellen |last2=Barrett |first2=Devlin |last3=Entous |first3=Adam |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/fbi-obtained-fisa-warrant-to-monitor-former-trump-adviser-carter-page/2017/04/11/620192ea-1e0e-11e7-ad74-3a742a6e93a7_story.html |title=FBI obtained FISA warrant to monitor Trump adviser Carter Page |date=April 11, 2017 |work=The Washington Post |accessdate=September 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Green |first1=Miranda |url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/04/12/politics/fbi-carter-page-russia/index.html |title=FBI monitored former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page on Russia |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=April 12, 2017 |accessdate=September 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 18, 2017, [[CNN]] reported that the FBI wiretapped [[Paul Manafort]], Trump's former campaign chairman, from as early as 2014 through an unspecified time before the 2016 election, and also after the election through early 2017, pursuant to two separate FISA court orders. It has not been confirmed whether Trump's conversations with Manafort were intercepted as part of this surveillance. CNN acknowledged that prior to this disclosure, "speculation has run rampant about whether Manafort or others associated with Trump were under surveillance." The CNN report noted that it was unclear if Manafort was under FBI surveillance while he resided in Trump Tower.&lt;ref name="Manafort wiretap"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Perez |first1=Evan |last2=Prokupecz |first2=Shimon |last3=Brown |first3=Pamela |url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/09/18/politics/paul-manafort-government-wiretapped-fisa-russians/index.html |title=Exclusive: US government wiretapped former Trump campaign chairman |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=September 18, 2017 |accessdate=September 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Analysis ====
In its March 5 analysis of the reporting that preceded Trump's allegations, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' stated that "the articles all suggest that the FISA requests—if they happened—were done by the intelligence agencies and the FBI," and not by the Obama administration. According to ''The Post'', Mensch's article was the only one to have alleged any surveillance of Trump Tower. No major news organizations have been able to confirm Mensch's account,&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; despite prolonged efforts by ''The New York Times'' and ''The Washington Post''. This absence of verification, combined with Mensch's reliance on "vague"&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/05/us/politics/trump-phone-tapping-surveillance-issues.html|title=What Can Be Gleaned From Trump's Allegations of Wiretapping|last=Savage|first=Charlie|date=March 5, 2017|work=The New York Times|access-date=April 4, 2017|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; and anonymous sourcing to individuals "with links to the counter-intelligence community," lead ''The Times'' and ''The Post'' to urge skepticism about the veracity of her account.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HtStreetcopypasta" /&gt;

Some Trump supporters cited the Manafort wiretap report as vindicating Trump's March 2017 tweets.&lt;ref name="Fox Vindicated?"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/09/19/trump-vindicated-manafort-wiretapping-report-lends-credence-to-claim.html|title=Trump vindicated?

Graham of ''[[The Atlantic]]'' responded: "This is not true—Trump claimed he had been the subject of Obama-ordered, politically motivated surveillance, for which there remains no evidence." While acknowledging that "it does make for a more complicated picture than previously known," Graham argued "there are reasons to doubt" that Trump was even aware of the Manafort wiretap at the time he made his unsupported allegations against Obama. Graham concluded: "Insofar as there are parallels between what Pollak, Levin, and Napolitano said and the new story, it looks like luck."&lt;ref name="Graham Not Vindicated"&gt;{{cite web|last=Graham|first=David A.|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/09/does-the-latest-manafort-news-vindicate-trumps-wiretap-claim/540321/|title=Is Trump's 'Wiretap' Claim Vindicated?|work=[[The Atlantic]]|date=September 19, 2017|accessdate=September 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aaron Blake of ''The Washington Post'' noted that, according to CNN, lawyers for both Trump and Manafort convinced the two men to discontinue their phone conversations some time after Trump took office: "If Trump's lawyers somehow knew about and fought back against the Manafort wiretap, it stands to reason that Trump himself might have been aware of it.&amp;nbsp;... While we don't know the exact timing of all of this, perhaps this is what Trump was referring to and he, as he is wont to do, exaggerated it."&lt;ref name="Blake Wash Post"&gt;{{cite web|last=Blake|first=Aaron|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/09/19/cnn-says-the-government-wiretapped-manafort-does-that-vindicate-trumps-obama-wiretapped-me-claims/|title=CNN says Manafort was wiretapped.

== Reactions ==
There has been criticism of Trump's claim as simply being a "[[Dead cat strategy|dead cat]]", a false allegation against Obama intended to direct media and public interest away from Trump and his team's alleged connections with Russia.&lt;ref name="bbcnews1"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-39221378|title=Trump and the media – Is it war or love?|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=March 10, 2017|accessdate=March 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== From politicians ===
Most Republicans in Congress distanced themselves from the claim and refused to comment on it, although members of both the [[United States Senate|Senate]] and [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] vowed to investigate the matter.&lt;ref name="The Guardian no evidence"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Top Republicans refuse to back up Trump's unproven wiretapping claim |author=Sabrina Siddiqui, David Smith |date=March 8, 2017 |newspaper=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/mar/07/trump-wiretap-obama-republicans-us-intelligence }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Obama spokesman Kevin Lewis repudiated the claim in a statement later that day saying: "A cardinal rule of the Obama administration was that no White House official ever interfered with any independent investigation led by the Department of Justice."&lt;ref name="WaPost no evidence" /&gt;  ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' described Obama as "livid" when he heard about the allegations personally,&lt;ref name="Business Insider"&gt;{{cite news|author=Brian Logan|title=Obama is reportedly 'furious' over Trump's unsubstantiated wiretapping allegations|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/obama-responds-trump-wiretapping-claim-2017-3|work=Business Insider|date=March 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; though other sources said he "rolled his eyes" and remained more concerned about Trump's conservative and nationalist agenda.&lt;ref name="The Hill"&gt;{{cite news|author=Rebecca Savransky|title=Obama 'rolled his eyes' at Trump's wiretap accusation|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/322945-obama-rolled-his-eyes-at-trumps-wiretap-accusation|work=The Hill|date=March 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the Obama administration's former press secretary [[Josh Earnest]] was asked by [[ABC News]]'s [[Martha Raddatz]] if he could deny that the Obama Justice Department had sought and obtained a FISA court-ordered wiretap of the Trump campaign, he responded, "I don't know&amp;nbsp;...

On March 23, [[Devin Nunes]] stated that communications to and from [[Presidential transition of Donald Trump|Trump's presidential transition team]] may have been intercepted as part of incidental collection.&lt;ref name="Rosenberg Goldman Huetteman 2017"&gt;{{cite web | last=Rosenberg | first=Matthew | last2=Goldman | first2=Adam | last3=Huetteman | first3=Emmarie | title=Monitoring May Have 'Incidentally' Picked Up Trump Aides, House Member Says | website=The New York Times | date=March 20, 2017 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/22/us/politics/devin-nunes-wiretapping-trump.html | access-date=December 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, officials in the Obama administration refuted any claims that it had been monitoring the Trump team. Nunes said the surveillance was unrelated to the Russia investigation and "suggested the contents may have been inappropriately disseminated in intelligence reports&amp;nbsp;... for political reasons."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/8f45d6141e4e4cce86024af85841a9f7|title=Spying claim by Intel chair renews fight over Russia probe|publisher=Associated Press|date=March 22, 2017|access-date=March 23, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170324020019/http://bigstory.ap.org/8f45d6141e4e4cce86024af85841a9f7|archive-date=March 24, 2017|deadurl=no}}

Therefore, to better understand the intent of the meeting, she "requested the names of the Americans mentioned in the classified report be revealed internally" (or "[[Masking and unmasking by intelligence agencies|unmasked]]"). According to [[CNN]]'s Manu Ragu, while Nunes implied that such "unmasking" may have been improper—an allegation that the Trump administration used to deflect from Trump's original wiretap claim—Rice's "explanation appears to have satisfied some influential Republicans on the committee, undercutting both Nunes and Trump." Republican Representative [[Mike Conaway]] affirmed: "She was a good witness, answered all our questions. I'm not aware of any reason to bring her back."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ragu|first=Manu|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/09/13/politics/susan-rice-house-investigators-unmasked-trump-officials/index.html|title=Exclusive: Rice told House investigators why she unmasked senior Trump officials|publisher=[[CNN]]|date=September 18, 2017|accessdate=September 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== From U.S. government agencies ===
On March 4, FBI director [[James Comey]] asked the Justice Department to issue a statement refuting Trump's claims.&lt;ref name="Comey refute" /&gt; Speaking to NBC's ''Meet the Press'', former Director of National Intelligence [[James Clapper]] said "For the part of the national security apparatus that I oversaw as DNI there was no such wiretap activity mounted against the President-elect at the time, or as a candidate, or against his campaign."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/03/05/politics/clapper-trump-wiretap/index.html|title=Clapper: 'No such wiretap activity mounted' on Trump|last=Diamond|first=Jeremy|date=March 5, 2017|publisher=CNN|access-date=March 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a [[House Intelligence Committee]] open hearing on March 20, 2017, Comey stated that neither the FBI nor the Justice Department possessed any information to support Trump's wiretapping allegations.&lt;ref name="nyt_comey"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/20/us/politics/intelligence-committee-russia-donald-trump.html|title=Comey Confirms F.B.I.

On September 1, 2017, a DOJ court filing stated that "both the FBI and NSD &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[United States Department of Justice National Security Division]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; confirm that they have no records related to wiretaps as described by the March 4, 2017 tweets." Furthermore, it said that the Department of Justice and the FBI "[[Glomar response|do not confirm or deny the existence]]" of any other records that are responsive to American Oversight's [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|FOIA]] request, which was broader than the alleged wiretaps of Trump Tower.&lt;ref name="Justice Department"&gt;{{Cite web |last=Walsh |first=Deirdre |url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/09/02/politics/justice-department-trump-tower-wiretap/index.html |title=Justice Department: No evidence Trump Tower was wiretapped |date=September 2, 2017 |publisher=CNN |access-date=September 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Voice acting''' is the art of performing [[voice-over]]s or providing voices to represent a character or to provide information to an audience or user. Examples include [[animation|animated]], off-stage, off-screen or non-visible characters in various works, including feature [[film]]s, [[dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]] foreign language films, animated [[short film]]s, [[television program]]s, [[Television advertisement|commercials]], [[radio drama|radio or audio dramas]], [[Radio comedy|comedy]], [[video game]]s, [[Puppetry|puppet shows]], [[List of amusement rides|amusement ride]]s, [[audiobook]]s and [[Documentary film|documentaries]]. Voice acting is also done for small handheld [[audio game]]s.

Performers are called '''voice actors''' or '''actresses''', '''voice artists''' or '''voice talent'''. Their roles may also involve singing, although a second voice actor is sometimes cast as the character's [[singing]] voice. Voice acting is recognised in Britain as a specialized dramatic profession, chiefly owing to the [[BBC]]'s long tradition of radio drama.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/2RSmkTlT319KR9yd9DmzBb6/acting-for-radio|title=Soundstart - Acting for Radio|publisher=|accessdate=16 January 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161230080050/http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/2RSmkTlT319KR9yd9DmzBb6/acting-for-radio|archivedate=30 December 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Voice artists are also used to record the individual sample fragments played back by a computer in an automated announcement.

==Types==
{{further information|Voice-over|Dubbing (filmmaking)}}

===Character voices===
The voices for animated characters are provided by [[voice actor]]s. For [[live action]] productions, voice acting often involves reading the parts of computer programs, radio dispatchers, or other characters who never actually appear on screen. With a [[radio drama]] or [[Compact Disc]] [[drama]], there is more freedom in voice acting, because there is no need to match a dub to the original actors, or to match an animated character.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Producers and agencies are on the look out for many styles of voices such as booming voices, which maybe perfect for more dramatic productions or cute, young sounding voices that are perfect for trendier markets.

Some just sound like regular, natural, everyday people and all of these voices have their place in the Voiceover world, provided they are used correctly and in the right context.&lt;ref&gt;How to be a voiceover in todays world {{cite web |url=https://thevoicefinder.com/todo/how-to-become-a-voice-artist/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-07-09 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170918064951/https://thevoicefinder.com/todo/how-to-become-a-voice-artist/ |archivedate=2017-09-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Narration===
In the context of voice acting, [[narration]] is the use of spoken commentary to convey a [[narrative|story]] to an [[audience]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Narration in Poetry and Drama|author-last1=Hühn|author-first1=Peter|author-last2=Sommer|author-first2=Roy|work=The Living Handbook of Narratology|year=2012|publisher=Interdisciplinary Center for Narratology, University of Hamburg|url=http://www.lhn.uni-hamburg.de/article/narration-poetry-and-drama|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150218060329/http://www.lhn.uni-hamburg.de/article/narration-poetry-and-drama|archivedate=2015-02-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A narrator is a personal character or a non-personal voice that the creator of the story develops to deliver information to the audience, particularly about the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]]. The voice actor who plays the narrator is responsible for performing the scripted lines assigned to the narrator.

In traditional literary narratives (such as [[novels]], [[short stories]], and [[memoir]]s), narration is a required [[literary element|story element]]; in other types of (chiefly non-literary) narratives, such as plays, television shows, video games, and films, narration is merely optional.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

=== Commercial ===
One of the most common uses for voice acting is within commercial advertising. The voice actor is hired to voice a message associated with the advertisement. This has different subgenres; television, radio, cinema, and web-advertising. The subgenres are all different styles in their own right. For example, television commercials tend to be voiced with a narrow, flat inflection pattern (or [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] pattern), whereas radio (especially local radio) commercials tend to be voiced with a very wide inflection pattern in an almost over-the-top style. 

Markerters and advertisers use voiceover all over their projects, from radio, to TV, to online and more! Total advertising spend in the UK is forecast to be £21.8 billion in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thevoicefinder.com/todo/industry-insight-and-tips/|title=Industry insights – The Voice Finder|author=|date=|website=thevoicefinder.com|accessdate=8 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171019224514/https://thevoicefinder.com/todo/industry-insight-and-tips/|archivedate=19 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Voiceover used in commercial adverts also is the only area of voice acting where de-breathing is used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gravyforthebrain.com/gravytimes/commercial-voiceover-when-should-you-debreath/|title=Debreath your Voiceovers the Human Way|date=2016-06-02|website=Gravy Times - Voiceover Blog|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; De-breathing means artificially removing breaths from the recorded voice. This is done to stop the audience being distracted in any way from the commercial message that is being put across.{{Citation needed|date = March 2017}}

===Translation===
[[Dub localization]] is a type of [[voice-over]].  It is the practice of [[voice-over translation]] altering a [[foreign language]] [[film]], [[art film]] or [[television series]] by voice actors.

[[Voice-over translation]] is an [[audiovisual translation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=USA|first1=Translate|title=Voice-over Translation|url=http://www.usatranslate.com/voice-over-translation-funny-way-of-translation/|website=USATranslate.com|accessdate=31 December 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141231132326/http://www.usatranslate.com/voice-over-translation-funny-way-of-translation/|archivedate=31 December 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; technique, in which, unlike in Dub localization, actor voices are recorded over the original audio track, which can be heard in the background. This method of translation is most often used in [[documentary film|documentaries]] and [[news report]]s to translate words of foreign-language interviewees.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

===Automated dialogue replacement===
{{main article|Dubbing (filmmaking)#ADR/post-sync}}
Automated dialogue replacement (ADR) is the process of re-recording dialogue by the original actor after the filming process to improve audio quality or reflect dialogue changes (also known as "looping" or a "looping session").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ADR: Hollywood Dialogue Recording Secrets|url=http://magazine.creativecow.net/article/adr-hollywood-dialogue-recording-secrets|work=Creative COW Magazine|publisher=Creative COW|accessdate=30 July 2012|author=Cowdog|year=2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120815105431/http://magazine.creativecow.net/article/adr-hollywood-dialogue-recording-secrets|archivedate=15 August 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Dark Knight Without Heath Ledger: How will Warner Bros. sell a summer blockbuster marked by tragedy?|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/hollywoodland/2008/01/the_dark_knight_without_heath_ledger.html|work=Slate|publisher=The Slate Group, LLC|accessdate=30 July 2012|first=Kim|last=Masters|date=31 January 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120620093828/http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/hollywoodland/2008/01/the_dark_knight_without_heath_ledger.html|archivedate=20 June 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ADR is also used to change original lines recorded on set to clarify context, improve [[diction]] or [[Synchronization|timing]], or to replace an accented vocal performance. In the [[United Kingdom|UK]], it is also called "post-synchronization" or "post-sync".{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

===Automated announcements===
Voice artists are also used to record the individual sample fragments played back by a computer in an automated announcement. At its simplest, each recording consists of a short phrase which is played back when necessary, e.g. the "[[Mind the gap]]" announcement introduced by London Underground in 1969. In a more complicated system, such as a speaking clock, the announcement is re-assembled from fragments such as "minutes past" "eighteen" and "p.m." For example, the word "twelve" can be used for both "Twelve O'Clock" and "Six Twelve."

Automated announcements can also include on-hold messages on phone systems and location-specific announcements in tourist attractions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.debbiegrattan.com/blog/benefits-of-voice-over-phone-patch/|title=Benefits of Phone Automation &amp; phone patch|date=27 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Voice acting by country==

===Japan===
{{Main article|Voice acting in Japan}}

'''{{nihongo|Seiyū|声優|lead=yes}}''' occupations include performing roles in [[anime]], audio dramas and video games, performing voice-overs for [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubs]] of non-Japanese movies, and providing narration to documentaries and similar programs. Because the animation industry in Japan is so prolific, voice actors in Japan are able to have full-time careers as voice-over artists. Japanese voice actors are able to take greater charge of their careers than voice actors in other countries. Japan has approximately 130 voice acting schools and troupes of voice actors, who work for a specific broadcast company or talent agency. They often attract their own appreciators and fans, who watch shows specifically to hear their favorite actor or actress.

Many Japanese voice actors frequently branch into music, often singing the opening or closing themes of shows in which their character stars, or become involved in non-animated side projects such as [[audio drama]]s (involving the same characters in new story lines) or [[image song]]s (songs sung in character that are not included in the anime but which further develop the character).

===Brazil===

Although voice acting is criticized heavily in [[Brazil]], most of the films in the theaters are dubbed in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], and most [[Brazilians]] prefer watching movies in their native language.{{Which|date=March 2017}} Voice acting in Brazil has been highly acclaimed by other countries. Many voice actors are also dubbing directors, people that direct other voice actors, and [[translators]]. To become a voice actor in Brazil, you need to be a professional actor and attend dubbing courses.

'''Women in documentary film''' describes the role of women as directors, writers, performers, producers, and other film industry professions. According to a 2017 study by San Diego University’s Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film, women make up around thirty percent of the population of people working in the [[documentary film]] industry, worldwide.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://womenintvfilm.sdsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2017_Celluloid_Ceiling_Report.pdf|title=The Celluloid Ceiling: Behind-the-Scenes Employment of Women on the Top 100, 250, and 500 Films of 2017|last=Lauzen|first=Martha|date=January 10, 2018|website=San Diego University's Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a separate study on the employment of women in indie films, the Center found that overall fewer woman directed independent films were screened at film festivals but that a higher percentage of woman directed documentary films were screened, at 8 films versus 13 documentary films directed by men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://womenintvfilm.sdsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2017-18_Indie_Women_Report.pdf|title=Indie Women|last=Lauzen|first=Martha M.|date=2018|website=Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a October 2015 Annenberg study, women documentarians in countries other than the U.S. were 40 percent likely to be “helmers” (in the top position) as opposed to 30 percent likely in the U.S. The study counted films with multiple countries involved “as other countries” but if the U.S. was involved it wasn’t counted as “other countries.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://annenberg.usc.edu/sites/default/files/2015/05/17/2015_phase-iii-research--female-filmmakers-initiative.pdf|title=Female Filmmakers Initiative|last=Smith|first=Stacy|date=2015|website=Sundance Institute and Women In Film Los Angeles|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The world of documentary film and the Oscars were criticized in 2016 by entertainment attorney Victoria Cook, who commented that there is a “misperception that the (feature) documentary category is more inclusive, less sexist and less racist than the other categories" and noted that only two female documentary filmmakers have won Oscars in the documentary feature category in the last twenty years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/news/gender-bias-documentary-industry-1201708404/|title=Oscars: Examining Gender Bias in the Documentary Categories|last=Morfoot|first=Addie|date=2016-02-18|work=Variety|access-date=2018-06-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
