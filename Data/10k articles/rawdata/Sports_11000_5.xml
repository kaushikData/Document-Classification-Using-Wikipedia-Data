The '''2–3 zone defense''' is a defensive strategy used in basketball as an alternative to [[man-to-man defense]]. It is referred to as the 2–3 because of its formation on the court, which consists of two players at the front of the defense (and closer to half court) and three players behind (and closer to the team's basket).

==History ==
In 1914, [[Cam Henderson|Eli Camden "Cam" Henderson]]'s Bristol High School first used a 3-2 zone defense against [[Clair Bee]]'s team, Grafton YMCA, in West Virginia. The zone defense was used because the gym floor was made of green pine and it was very slippery when wet, when the roof leaked.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=DDO3sdV6ytsC&amp;pg=PA205&amp;lpg=PA205&amp;dq=eli+camden+henderson&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=q7Es7yC5PW&amp;sig=l5pRplNjkbJM4wqyut9wQLGxHAI&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=uRBoStCiEIuAsgPdiMiFBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1 Basketball by David L. Porter]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[3-2 zone defense]] did not provide the rebounding support for the [[fast break]] that Cam Henderson was using. The top defender dropped back to form the 2–3 zone. Henderson developed this style of basketball successfully at [[Davis &amp; Elkins College]], before moving on to coach at [[Marshall Thundering Herd men's basketball|Marshall University]].

In 1938, Marshall University upset [[LIU Brooklyn Blackbirds men's basketball|Long Island University]], to snap their 40-game winning streak.&lt;ref&gt;Coach Don Casey &amp; Ralph Pim, Own the Zone – Executing &amp; attacking the zone defense, New York: McGraw Hill, 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;18&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1947, Henderson led Marshall to a [[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics]] (NAIA) championship title with his 2–3 zone defense and [[fast break]] offense.&lt;ref&gt;Coach Don Casey &amp; Ralph Pim, Own the Zone – Executing &amp; attacking the zone defense by Charlie Halford New York: McGraw Hill, 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;19&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[2002–03 NCAA Division I men's basketball season|2003]], [[Syracuse Orange men's basketball|Syracuse University]] coach [[Jim Boeheim]] led his [[2002–03 Syracuse Orangemen basketball team|team]] to an [[2003 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|NCAA Tournament]] championship playing the 2-3 zone, which has become Boeheim's trademark.

==How to play a 2–3 zone defense==
The widespread use of the 2–3 zone is likely due to its somewhat intuitive operation. The two players on the top of the zone are usually a team's guards, and they guard the zones closest to them on the perimeter and three-point arc. In the same way, a team's forwards guard the sides of the zone and its center guards the lane and center of the defense. As the opposing team moves with the basketball around the court, the ''zone as a whole'' shifts accordingly.

The individuals that make up a 2–3 zone are often described as "being on a string." This means that as one player moves, he pulls the imaginary string (which is attached to every defensive player) and therefore pulls the entire defense in that same direction. As the ball moves throughout the court, every player should shift simultaneously in the direction of the ball. When a player in the zone is shifting, that player should look to fill in gaps of space vacated by other shifting players and also guard offensive players in that space.

For example, if a player with the ball stood on the right wing (beyond the three point arc), defensive players 1 and 2 would shift towards that direction. To effectively operate the 2–3 zone, a defense must move as a whole. In this case, that would mean every defensive player shifting around 5 to 6 feet in the direction of the right wing and the player with the ball. Similarly, if that player moved to the right corner, the 4 player would move to guard him and the rest of the defense would shift towards that direction. So much so, in fact, that ideally no defensive players should be on the left side of the court at all, because it would require several passes, or a long pass(skip pass) through the defense to get the ball to the left side.

===Key points of emphasis===
*''Communicate'' — this is probably the most important thing to remember when playing a 2–3 zone. Players should talk to each other on the court about who's open, who should be where, what to do, and everything else worth knowing. The team must work together, and the best way to do so is to communicate with each other on the floor.
*Players should anticipate the next pass before it happens, so that when it does, each person knows where to go on the floor and fewer breakdowns happen.
*Although it is a zone defense, players should always be aware of the offensive players' locations on the floor. It is more important to guard an open player than stay within the normal constraints of the zone.
*Offensive players closer to the basket take priority. The defense begins at the basket and radiates outwards—the idea is to force the offense to take shots from the perimeter and prevent access to the basket and surrounding area.

==Strengths of the 2–3 zone==
The 2–3 zone is a very effective defense when executed properly. This defense's strong suits include:

*Forcing outside shots—it generally holds true that as players get further away from the basket, their chances of scoring decrease. The 2–3 essentially fills the middle of the court and is very effective at preventing penetration into the lane and heart of the defense, leaving the perimeter as an offense's most accessible option.
*"Hiding" poor defensive players—because the 2–3 zone is so team-oriented, players who are less effective defensively are less likely to be exploited by the offense. It is very difficult to target just one defensive player in the 2–3 because the zone is always shifting and players work together. Similarly, using a 2–3 more evenly distributes fouls throughout the players on defense, meaning foul-prone players are less likely to accumulate many fouls or foul out.
*Slowing the game (Gibson)—Because the 2–3 often guards the interior of the court well, offenses generally pass the ball around the perimeter frequently before attempting to penetrate the defense or initiate an offense. As a result, it takes longer for an offense to take a shot, and therefore slows the tempo of the game. Therefore, hypothetically defensive players have more time to catch their breath as a result. Also players exert somewhat less energy in a zone than in man-to-man since they often cover less ground while playing defense.
*Fewer offensive plays—There are far fewer zone offenses than there are man-to-man offenses to prepare for as a defense. As a result, defenses often have a better idea of what to expect from the offensive team when playing a zone defense.&lt;ref&gt;http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/ncaatourney03/story?id=1532389&lt;/ref&gt;

==Weaknesses of the 2–3 zone==
On the other hand, there are many reasons why many coaches prefer not to use the zone. Its strengths can easily become its weaknesses, which include:

*Perimeter scoring—because the 2–3 zone often leaves some parts of the perimeter wide open for the opposing offense's long-range shooters, offenses that excel at 3-point shots and mid-range jump shots always have a chance to keep the score even (or, to build large leads). This is probably the 2–3's most obvious Achilles' heel.
*Playing from behind—teams that are losing rarely use the 2-3 zone, because it gives the opposing  offense ample time—and space—to repeatedly pass the ball around the perimeter, reducing the amount of time left in the game.
*Rebounding—in man-to-man defense, defensive players know who to "block out" if the shot misses, and an offensive rebound's attempted; each defender covers the individual offensive player they're assigned to personally defend. However, in the 2–3 zone, defensive players do not guard individuals, only areas of the court (zones); so, it is more difficult to quickly and accurately assess where the offensive players are, and which defensive players are supposed to block them out. As a result, 2–3 zones often yield more rebounds for the opposing offense, which can tire out a defense, and/or put them far behind in scoring.
*Gaps in the zone—there are a few areas on the court that often cause breakdowns in the 2–3 zone, especially at the high-[[post (basketball)|post]] area. The high post/[[free throw]] line area (i.e., the center of the 2–3 zone) is often a weak spot in the zone that is exploited by the offense.  Multiple defensive players tend to "collapse" (i.e., converge at once) on an offensive player who has the ball in this part of the zone, leaving other offensive players unguarded on the wings, blocks, and/or baseline areas.
*Degree of difficulty—because the 2–3 zone relies so heavily on well-timed teamwork, each individual player must know exactly where to be at all times. Because a zone defense is more complex than simply following one player always following his counterpart around the court, there is a higher probability that at least one defensive player will forget which opposing player he/she was assigned to guard. Players must be extremely practiced and knowledgeable to run a 2–3 zone correctly.

==Notes==
*The 2–3 zone is sometimes called a 2–1–2 zone, simply because the player (usually the center) standing under the basket moves further up on the key. The concept, however, remains the same. The 2–1–2 concept is used when the other team runs cutters to break down the zone.

[[File:Basse fra Trøndelag.jpeg|thumb|A basse, made of cut bicycle rubber tubes, tied together into a ball. Photo: Lars Haugdal Andersen / www.basse.no]]

'''Basse''' is a [[Norway|Norwegian]] bag ball game, with roots before World War I.&lt;ref&gt;Sørensen, B. (1980). Basse – ein trøndersport. I: Stemshaug, O. (red.) (Yearbook for Trøndelag). Trondheim: Trønderlaget. pp. 119–124.&lt;/ref&gt; Today basse is mostly played in the [[county]] of [[Trøndelag]], but also spread to other countries.

==Construction==
The basse can be made with rings (two or three, up to eight). Use [[rubber]] band or old bicycle [[Tyre (wheel)|tyre]]. The basse is a bag ball, it should be round, but not bounce in any direction. The weight is about 70 – 100 [[gram]]s. 

==Gameplay==

Create fields (squares or circles) on any surface (gravel, tarmac, grass or indoors). Use your feet, chalk or spray paint to create the field, depending on the surface. First, draw the mid field circle. Diameter 1–1,5 metre. Make room, 30–40&amp;nbsp;cm between the next circles. You can have 4 to 8 fields around the center circle. The optimal number of players are 5–7, but 8–9 can play a game of basse, depending on the field and space available.

The overall goal is to defend your field (a circle) and to score goals on the other players. It is an individual sport and everyone plays against everyone. The game starts with a serve (not lower than the knee). If you concede a goal (i.e. the basse must land completely inside the circle and not touch the edge), you get one minus point. After 3 minus points you are out of the game. You must defend your circle and the players can hit the basse with all body limbs, except arms and hands. 

The finale is played when there are two players left. ”The first goal wins”, regardless of the number of minus points each finalists has received before.

Some players practice rules for refereeing, dead squares, hand ball and penalty kicks. Basse tournaments are often held during the summer season.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1867">'''Clássico dos Clássicos''' ({{lang-en|the Derby of Derbies}}) is a [[local derby|derby]] between two crosstown [[football (soccer)|football]] teams in the [[Brazil]]ian city of [[Recife]]: [[Clube Náutico Capibaribe]] and [[Sport Club do Recife]].&lt;ref name=CADCDC&gt;Cem anos do ‘Clássico do clássicos’http://globoesporte.globo.com/platb/memoriaec/2009/07/25/cem-anos-do-classico-do-classicos/&lt;/ref&gt; It is the third oldest derbie in Brazilian football (1909), just after [[Clube de Regatas Vasco da Gama|Vasco]]x[[Flamengo]] and [[Grenal]].

==Background==
Sport was created in 1905 by a falling out between Náutico members, renegade members leaving Náutico to create the new club.  The series of matches began in 1909.  A newspaper item in 1945 led to the current name for the derby.

The rivalry between the two clubs is intense and is reflected in part by the opposing teams colors: the principal colors of Clube Náutico Capibaribe are red and white; those of Sport Club do Recife are red and black. The competitiveness has sometimes given rise to conflicts between the supporters of the teams, especially among organized members of the teams' fan clubs. Security has been a significant concern for the local authorities, involving large numbers of police and firefighters.

==Statistics==

'''Constant Vanden Stock Stadium''' ({{lang-fr|Stade Constant Vanden Stock}}, {{lang-nl|Constant Vanden Stockstadion}} {{IPA-nl|kɔ̃ːˈstɑ̃ː  vɑndɛn ˈstɔk ˌstaːdijɔn|}}) is a [[football (soccer)|football]] [[stadium]] in the municipality of [[Anderlecht]], [[Brussels]]. It is home to [[R.S.C. Anderlecht]]. It also hosted the [[UEFA Euro 1972]] semifinal [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]] against [[Soviet Union national football team|Soviet Union]], as well as several games of the [[Belgium national football team]].

==Overview==
It was in 1917 that R.S.C. Anderlecht installed, on the border of the Meir Park (later renamed [[Astrid Park]]), a new stadium with only one wooden stand. They called it '''Émile Versé Stadium''', in the name of a generous patron. Later, concrete stands were set up. Though, in 1983, the stadium was completely rebuilt and took the name of the club's then chairman [[Constant Vanden Stock]].  Its capacity was decreased to 21,500 &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.erasmix.be/content/%E2%80%98een-nationaal-stadion-stamt-uit-de-koloniale-tijd%E2%80%99/ Een nationaal stadion stamt uit de koloniale tijd] erasmix.be, 15 may 2013&lt;/ref&gt;. During European competitions, the stadium is all-seated, which decreases its capacity. In 2010 the son of Constant Vanden Stock, [[Roger Vanden Stock|Roger]], announced together with RSC Anderlecht's manager Herman Van Holsbeeck that the club was going to build a third ring above the two existing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rsca.be/go/fr/article/26260/stade_-_le_rsca_restera_%C3%A0_anderlecht_et_il_a_opt%C3%A9_pour_un_troisi%C3%A8me_anneau |title=Stade - Le RSCA restera à Anderlecht et il a opté pour un troisième anneau |publisher=rsca.be |accessdate=30 October 2010 |language=French |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101025131453/http://www.rsca.be/go/fr/article/26260/stade_-_le_rsca_restera_%C3%A0_anderlecht_et_il_a_opt%C3%A9_pour_un_troisi%C3%A8me_anneau |archivedate=25 October 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to increase the stadium's capacity to 30,000 places. To date, these works have not started, and it is doubtful they will, as in 2014 Anderlecht agreed to become anchor tenant of the planned 60,000+ new national stadium, thus sealing the fate of their spiritual home. In summer 2012, rail seats for [[safe standing]] were fitted on the terracing behind each goal.&lt;ref&gt;http://stadiumdb.com/news/2012/07/belgium_anderlecht_gives_cvds_a_makeover&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium address is Avenue Théo Verbeecklaan 2, B-1070 Anderlecht.  It is located near [[Saint-Guidon/Sint-Guido metro station]]. Rival supporters must stop at [[Aumale metro station]] for [[UEFA Champions League]] matches due to security measures. The stadium hosts a former one-star restaurant (''Le Saint-Guidon'') and a cafeteria, as well as the official club fanshop and the ticketing.

The '''Danish handball cup''' ({{lang-da|Landspokalturneringen i håndbold}}) is the nationwide cup tournament for [[team handball|handball]] teams of Denmark. The competition has been played annually since 1964.

== Tournament structure ==
The competition begins in the autumn and spring on a regional basis, after which eight teams from the regional federation of [[Jutland]] and the other five regional federations respectively qualify to the round of 16. That round is the first nationwide round, where no [[geography|geographical]] considerations are taken into account. All rounds are played as a single game, where either the first drawn team or (when relevant) the lowest ranked team play at home. The last four rounds are played from August till newyear, where the finals (both men's and women's) are played in the city of [[Århus]], with both games the same day.

The winner of the tournament will qualify for the European tournament [[EHF Cup Winners' Cup]], unless they later in the season qualify to the [[EHF Champions League]]. In this case the ticket wil pass on to another team.

It opened in 2009, built on the {{convert|58|acre|m2|adj=on}} site of the abandoned Longhorn Quarry, and has 2,525 paved parking spaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neisd.net/constr/bonds/projects/heroes_stadium/2007/site.htm|title=2007 Bond Project: Heroes Stadium|publisher=NEISD}}&lt;/ref&gt;  $27.5 million of funding was provided by a 2007 school district bond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neisd.net/constr/bonds/projects/heroes_stadium/2007/index.html|title=2007 Bond Project|publisher=NEISD}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A video board system measuring {{convert|15|by|25|ft|m|abbr=on}} was installed in 2010. Along with [[Comalander Stadium]], Heroes is the home venue for the football, track and field, soccer, and band events for the high schools in the [[North East Independent School District]], and also plays host to various athletic events for the district's middle and elementary schools.

The stadium received national exposure on August 27, 2010, when it held a game between local [[James Madison High School (San Antonio, Texas)|Madison Mavericks]] and [http://www.scuc.txed.net/ByronSteele.cfm Steele Knights] of [[Cibolo, Texas|Cibolo]]. The game was televised by [[ESPN]], as part of its High School Rise Kickoff Event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncaa/recruiting/football/news/story?id=5500773|title=Steele Knights vs. Madison Mavericks|publisher=ESPN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The venue hosted the [[San Antonio Scorpions FC|San Antonio Scorpions]] in their inaugural [[2012 San Antonio Scorpions FC season|2012]] [[North American Soccer League (2011)|NASL]] [[2012 North American Soccer League season|season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NASL chief gives OK to Heroes&lt;br/&gt; Stadium|url=http://www.mysanantonio.com/sports/article/NASL-chief-gives-OK-to-Heroes-Stadium-1354089.php|publisher=San Antonio Express-News}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The team played at the site to an average attendance of 9,176, including a couple of sellout crowds,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=dohertysoocer|title=2012 NASL Attendance|url=http://dohertysoccer.com/2012-lower-division-attendance/2012-nasl-attendance/|publisher=dohertysoocer}}&lt;/ref&gt; while their stadium, [[Toyota Field]], was being completed.

'''Koning Willem II Stadion''' ({{IPA-nl|ˌkoːnɪŋ ˌʋɪləm ˈtʋeː ˌstaːdijɔn}}) is a [[multi-purpose stadium]] in [[Tilburg]], [[Netherlands]], and the home ground of [[Willem II Tilburg]].  It is currently used mostly for [[association football|football]] matches. The stadium is able to hold 14,700 people, was built in 1995 and renovated in 2000 to add business lodges, a restaurant, conference rooms, business club and a supporters bar to the main building.

The new stadium is built on the same spot as the old stadium, the [[Gemeentelijk Sportpark Tilburg]], which had a smaller capacity and fewer facilities. This stadium was demolished in 1992. The current stadium opened in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Koning Willem II Stadion|publisher=Soccerway|accessdate=18 August 2017|url=https://int.soccerway.com/venues/netherlands/willem-ii-stadion/v274/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original name was ''Willem II Stadion'', but in 2009 the stadium was renamed ''Koning'' ("King") ''Willem II Stadion'', honoring [[William II of the Netherlands]].

== Running ==
{{Main|Running}}
[[File:100m women Golden League 2007 in Zurich.jpg|thumb|The finish of a women's 100&amp;nbsp;m race]]
Running is defined in [[sport]]ing terms as a [[gait]] in which at some point all feet are off the ground at the same time. This is in contrast to [[walking]], where one foot is always in contact with the ground. The term running can refer to any of a variety of speeds ranging from [[jogging]] to [[Sprint (running)|sprinting]]. Competitive running grew out of religious festivals in various areas.  The [[Ancient_Olympic_Games#Origins|origins of the Olympics]] are shrouded in myth, though the first recorded game took place in 776 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cgkzWTugSj0C&amp;pg=PA201&amp;dq=first+recorded+victor+of+the+stade-race+in+776&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=1MYlTNDBDJCNOO3WrPAC&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=first%20recorded%20victor%20of%20the%20stade-race%20in%20776&amp;f=false |title=The Ancient Olympics - Google Books |publisher=books.google.com |accessdate=2010-06-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Gaelic Ireland]] the [[Tailteann Games (ancient)|Tailteann Games]], which featured footraces, are attested from the 6th century CE; medieval chroniclers gave founding dates as early as 1829 BCE.

A '''metric mile''' is a distance which approximates one statute [[mile]] (1609.344&amp;nbsp;m) at a round figure of [[metre]]s (the [[SI]] or metric unit of length). The term is most commonly used in [[track running]] and [[swimming (sport)|swimming]].

In track running, the [[1500 metres|1500&amp;nbsp;m race]] became the standard [[middle distance track event|middle distance race]] in Europe in the late 19th century,&lt;ref name=nelsonpluquercetania&gt;{{cite book
 | last = [[Cordner Nelson|Nelson]]
 | first =  [[Cordner Nelson|Cordner]]
 |author2=Quercetani, Roberto
 | title =  The Milers
 | url = 
 | year=   1985
 | isbn = 0-911521-15-1
 | page=14
 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  and has been the standard distance in the Olympic Games since 1896. The distance of the race is sometimes referred to as a metric mile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9052542/middle-distance-running|title=Middle-distance running|accessdate=2008-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to [[metrication]], many tracks in the United States and the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] were constructed to the specifications of one quarter of a mile, 440&amp;nbsp;yards (402.336&amp;nbsp;m).  Thus when the [[mile run|mile]] was run, the race was a four lap race.  The Commonwealth officially converted to metric in the mid-1960s.  The [[Metrication in the United States#Sports|United States adopted metric rules]] in the mid to late 1970s, though some tracks are still constructed to be a quarter of a mile in length requiring calibrated painted lines to run metric races.

Even in countries [[United States customary units|like the U.S]]. which do not embrace the metric system, most running tracks now have a lap distance of [[400&amp;nbsp;metres]] in the innermost lane. The final leg of a [[distance medley relay]] uses a four lap 1600&amp;nbsp;m leg; The standard middle distance in many [[United States]] [[National Federation of State High School Associations|high school competitions]] is 1600&amp;nbsp;m and this distance is sometimes referred to as a metric mile as well.

In swimming, the 1500&amp;nbsp;m (or 1650&amp;nbsp;yards) race is commonly referred to as "the swimmer's mile", and is often the longest distance swum by competitors in a pool. The standard distance triathlon also employs the swimmer's mile, except in open water instead of a pool.

'''Microfracture surgery''' is an [[articular cartilage repair]] [[surgery|surgical technique]] that works by creating tiny [[Bone fracture|fractures]] in the underlying [[bone]]. This causes new cartilage to develop from a so-called super-clot. 

The surgery is quick (typically lasting between 30–90 minutes), minimally invasive, and can have a significantly shorter recovery time than an [[arthroplasty]] ([[knee replacement]]).

Chronic articular cartilage defects do not heal spontaneously.&lt;ref&gt;Hunter W (1743) "On the structure and diseases of articulating cartilages." Trans R Soc Lond 42B:514-21&lt;/ref&gt; However, acute traumatic osteochondral lesions or surgically created lesions extending into subchondral bone, e.g. by [[Kenneth Pridie|Pridie]] drilling,&lt;ref&gt;Pridie K (1959) ''A method of resurfacing osteoarthritic knee joints.'' J Bone Joint Surg Br 41-B(3):618-619&lt;/ref&gt; spongialization&lt;ref&gt;Ficat RP, Ficat C, Gedeon P, Toussaint JB (1979) ''Spongialization: a new treatment for diseased patellae.'' Clin Orthop Relat Res (144):74-83&lt;/ref&gt;  abrasion&lt;ref&gt;Johnson LL (1986) ''Arthroscopic abrasion arthroplasty historical and pathologic perspective: present status.'' Arthroscopy 2(1):54-69&lt;/ref&gt; or microfracture causing the release of  multipotent mesenchymal stem cells from the bone marrow, may heal with repair tissue consisting of fibrous tissue, fibrocartilage or hyaline-like cartilage.&lt;ref&gt;Key JA (1931) ''Experimental arthritis: The changes in joints produced by creating defects in the articular cartilage.'' J Bone Joint Surg Am 13(4):725-739&lt;/ref&gt; The quality of the repair tissue after these "bone marrow stimulating techniques" depends on various factors including the species and age of the individual, the size and localization of the articular cartilage defect, the surgical technique, e.g., how the subchondral bone plate is treated, and the postoperative rehabilitation protocol.&lt;ref&gt;Alford JW, Cole BJ (2005) ''Cartilage restoration, part 2: techniques, outcomes, and future directions.'' Am J Sports Med 33(3):443-460&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The surgery was developed in the late 1980s and early 1990s by Dr. [[Richard Steadman]] of the Steadman-Hawkins [[clinic]] in [[Vail, Colorado]]. Steadman slowly refined the procedure through research (including tests on [[horse]]s).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.knee1.com/hero/hero.cfm/19/1 Dr. Richard Steadman: Pioneer in Cartilage Regeneration], interview by Neal Patel, Knee1.com, July 31, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; The surgery was soon called "controversial" by many [[sportswriting|sportswriters]], due to a lack of studies on the long-term effects and the fact that an unsuccessful surgery could end an athlete's career.&lt;ref&gt;[http://static.espn.go.com/nfl/trainingcamp03/columns/bills/observations/1590409.html "Bills looking for more balance on offense"], Len Pasquarelli, [[ESPN.com]], August 5, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Steadman has also adapted the surgery into a treatment to help reattach torn ligaments (a technique he calls the "healing response")

==Procedure==
The surgery is performed by [[arthroscopy]], after the joint is cleaned of calcified cartilage. Through use of an [[wikt:awl|awl]], the surgeon creates tiny fractures in the subchondral bone plate.&lt;ref name="thegoodpoint.com"&gt;[http://thegoodpoint.com/2010/07/microfracture-knee-surgery-nba/ "Microfracture knee surgery and its impact on the NBA"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120723004848/http://thegoodpoint.com/2010/07/microfracture-knee-surgery-nba/ |date=2012-07-23 }}, Austin Kent, ''The Good Point'' July 26, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; [[Blood]] and [[bone marrow]] (which contains [[stem cell]]s) seep out of the fractures, creating a [[blood clot]] that releases cartilage-building [[cell (biology)|cell]]s. The microfractures are treated as an injury by the body, which is why the surgery results in new, replacement cartilage.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;[http://www.shsmf.org/pdf/fallwinter0506.pdf "Older Knees Now Have New Option"], Vicky Lowry, ''[[New York Times]]'', April 5, 2005 (reprinted with permission in Steadman-Hawkins Research Foundation newsletter, Vol 11 (Fall-Winter) 2005-06)&lt;/ref&gt; The procedure is less effective in treating older patients, overweight patients, or a cartilage lesion larger than 2.5&amp;nbsp;cm.&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt; Further on, chances are high that after only 1 or 2 years of the surgery symptoms start to return as the fibrocartilage wears away, forcing the patient to reengage in articular cartilage repair.

The effectiveness of cartilage growth after microfracture surgery is thought to be dependent on the patient's bone marrow stem cell population and some think increasing the number of stem cells increases the chances of success.  A couple of physicians are promoting an alternative treatment  implanting [[autologous]] mesenchymal stem cells directly into the cartilage defect, without having to penetrate the subchondral bone.&lt;ref&gt;Centeno CJ, Busse D, Kisiday J, Keohan C, Freeman M, Karli D Increased knee cartilage volume in degenerative joint disease using percutaneously implanted, autologous mesenchymal stem cells.

==Microfracture Reports==
Studies have shown that microfracture techniques do not fill in the chondral defect fully, forming [[fibrocartilage]] rather than [[hyaline cartilage]]. Fibrocartilage is not as mechanically sound as hyaline cartilage; it is much denser and unable to withstand the demands of everyday activities as well as the original cartilage and is thus at higher risk of breaking down.&lt;ref name="cartilagehealth.com"&gt;"Articular cartilage repair of the knee" by Karen Hambly. www.cartilagehealth.com/acr.html&lt;/ref&gt; The blood clot is very delicate after surgery and needs to be protected. In terms of time, the clot takes about 8 to 15 weeks for conversion to fibrous tissue and is usually fibrocartilage by about four months post surgery, holding implications for the rehabilitation.&lt;ref name="cartilagehealth.com"/&gt;

'''[[Autologous Chondrocyte Implantation|Chondrocyte Implantation]] procedures''' (CCI), a cell based [[articular cartilage repair]] procedure that aims to provide complete hyaline repair tissues for articular cartilage repair, have been posed by some as an alternative to microfracture surgery. In February 2008, Saris ''et. al'' published a large-scale study claiming that CCI results in better structural repair for symptomatic cartilage defects of the knee than microfracture surgery. According to the study, one year after treatment, the tissue regenerate associated with CCI is of better quality than that of microfracture surgery.&lt;ref&gt;Characterized Chondrocyte Implantation Results in Better Structural Repair When Treating Symptomatic Cartilage Defects of the Knee in a Randomized Controlled Trial Versus microfracture, The American Journal of Sports Medicine volume 36 number 2, pp 235-246. February 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in professional sports==
There have been many notable professional athletes who have undergone the procedure. Partially because of the high level of stress placed on the knees by these athletes, the surgery is not a [[Panacea (medicine)|panacea]] and results have been mixed. Many players' careers effectively end despite the surgery. However, some players such as [[Jason Kidd]], [[Steve Yzerman]], [[John Stockton]], [[Kenyon Martin]] and [[Zach Randolph]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nba.com/features/stoudemire_060713.html&lt;/ref&gt; have been able to return at or near their pre-surgery form while players [[Ron Harper]], [[Brian Grant]], [[Chris Webber]], [[Allan Houston]], [[Penny Hardaway]], and the late [[Derek Smith (basketball)|Derek Smith]] never regained their old form.&lt;ref name="thegoodpoint.com"/&gt; Others such as [[Jamal Mashburn]] and [[Terrell Brandon]] never recovered and retired.  Portland Trail Blazers rookie [[Greg Oden]] underwent the procedure on his right knee in early September 2007 and missed the entire 2007-2008 NBA season. At only 19 at the time of the surgery, doctors were confident that he would return to at or near full strength by the 2008-2009 season; he had a second microfracture surgery, this time on his left knee, in November 2010. Subsequently, Oden did not play in the NBA for over four years, missing the entirety of the 2011-2012 and 2012-2013 NBA seasons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nba.com/blazers/news/Oden_Undergoes_Microfracture_S-236705-1218.html] "Greg Oden undergoes microfracture surgery"&lt;/ref&gt; The former San Antonio Spurs and Houston Rockets player, [[Tracy McGrady]] also underwent microfracture surgery; doctors were confident that the 2 time scoring champion will return to full strength. As of 2012 he has not had the same speed and jumping ability as he formerly did. He retired in 2013, never regaining his previous form after the surgery.

In October 2005, young star [[Amar'e Stoudemire]] of the [[NBA]]'s [[Phoenix Suns]] underwent one of the highest-profile microfracture surgeries to date. He returned to the court in March 2006 and initially appeared to have made a full recovery, but subsequently started feeling stiffness in both knees (his right knee had been overcompensating for the injured left knee). He and the team doctor decided he needed more time to rehab and he did not return until the [[2006-2007 NBA season]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azcentral.com/sports/suns/articles/0330amare0330.html "Amaré back in Valley"], Paul Coro, ''[[The Arizona Republic]]'', March 30, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; During the 2006-2007 season, Stoudemire returned to form, averaging 20.4 points and 9.6 rebounds per game while playing in all 82 regular-season games and the [[2007 NBA All-Star Game]]. His recent success has brought positive publicity to the procedure, further distancing it from a previous reputation as a possible "career death sentence" in the sports world, though he was one of the youngest of the aforementioned players to undergo the surgery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/dailydime?page=dailydime-070317-18&amp;lpos=spotlight&amp;lid=tab3pos2.html "The Daily Dime 3.17.07: 10 Drops of NBA Knowledge.  (Section 3, Western Conference)"], Marc Stein, ''[[ESPN.com]]'', March 17, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2010, Grady Sizemore of the Cleveland Indians underwent microfracture surgery after injuring his left knee while diving back to first base earlier in the season. Sizemore was re-activated as the Indians center fielder in April 2011, ending an 11-month stretch of being disabled due to his injury. In his first game back on April 17, 2011 Sizemore showed no signs of slowing down as he had 2 hits in 4 AB which included a double and Home Run. Currently, Sizemore is the only player in MLB history to come back from knee microfracture surgery and play centerfield.&lt;ref&gt;[https://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/news;_ylt=AqFuAru29XU4ld.0iuQMrYARvLYF?slug=jp-passan_grady_sizemore_indians_knee_royals_041811] "Sizemore’s running and Indians are winning"&lt;/ref&gt;

Vontaze Burfict, a linebacker for the Cincinnati Bengals, is one of the few notable NFL players to have the surgery. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000463388/article/bengals-vontaze-burfict-had-microfracture-surgery&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recovery==
One study has shown a success rate of 75 to 80 percent among patients 45 years of age or younger.&lt;ref name="journal"&gt;[http://www.arthroscopyjournal.org/article/PIIS0749806303001245/abstract "Outcomes of microfracture for traumatic chondral defects of the knee: Average 11-year follow-up"], Steadman et al., ''Arthroscopy: The Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery'', Vol 19, No 5 (May–June), 2003: pp 477–484&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mednews"&gt;[http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/medicalnews.php?newsid=38404 Orthopaedic Surgeon Performs Innovative Microfracture Procedure On Arthritic Knees Avoiding Knee Replacement Surgery], Medical News Today, February 26, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; 
It is an outpatient procedure and causes only small discomfort.  The harder part is the restrictions that are placed on the patient during the post-operative recovery period. This can be a major challenge for many patients. For optimal re-growth of joint surface, the patients need to be very patient and also extremely cooperative. They usually need to be on crutches for four to six weeks (sometimes longer). Sometimes a brace is needed. This all depends on the size and/or location of the joint surface defect that is being repaired or regenerated. The patients are encouraged to spend approximately 6–8 hours a day on a CPM ([[Continuous Passive Motion]]) machine that helps with optimal re-growth of joint surface. The procedure can be painless for some patients that the patients avoid these critically important steps and expose the knee to physical activity before the joint fully heals. However, with other patients the procedure can be very painful for weeks even months. Pain medication may be required to manage pain levels in those patients. 

Steadman cites the significance of a patient's natural joint alignment in addition to disciplined rehabilitation in recovery from the procedure.&lt;ref name="thegoodpoint.com"/&gt;

'''Podgorica City Stadium''' ([[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]]: ''Stadion pod Goricom'') is an all-seater [[multi-purpose stadium]] in [[Podgorica]], [[Montenegro]]. Mostly used for [[association football|football matches]], it has a [[seating capacity]] of 15,230. The planned capacity of stadium, after the next reconstruction of the east stand, is over 18,000. The stadium is the home ground of [[Montenegro national football team|Montenegrin national football team]] and [[FK Budućnost Podgorica]] ([[Montenegrin First League]]).

==History==
[[Image:Stadion pod Goricom.jpg|thumb|right|West stand in September 2005|270px]]
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:PodgoricaFootballStadium.png|thumb|left|Podgorica City Stadium|300px]] --&gt;
Podgorica City Stadium was built in 1945, following [[World War II]]. Before the war, [[FK Budućnost Podgorica]] and other clubs from Podgorica played their matches in a field near that location.

The stadium's original capacity was around 5,000 spectators. The stadium burned down completely in 1952, but was later rebuilt, with a new capacity of about 17,000 seats. The new stadium has four stands—west, east, south and north.

In 1989, floodlights were installed in the City Stadium in Podgorica (then known as Titograd). During the 1980s, the main stand (west) was reconstructed. The new stand has a seating capacity of 6,000 and a modern roof.

After the breakup of [[SFR Yugoslavia]], the stadium underwent additional construction work. The east stand was torn down, and a new north stand was built. Capacity was reduced to 12,000.

The latest construction work took place between 2004 and 2006. The south and north stand were renovated, with two tiers (lower tier and upper tier). On both sides, the capacity of the lower tier is 1,000 seats, and the capacity of upper tier is 2,500. Both stands are all-seater with roofs. During the last reconstruction, a new east stand was built.

The stadium's current capacity is 15,230, but for international games there are about 13,000 free-seats, because most seats on the south stand are reserved for guest supporters. 
The north stand is the home of [[FK Budućnost Podgorica]] fans, the popular ''Varvari'' (''Barbarians''). Varvari often account for a large percentage of the attendance at games featuring FK Budućnost. They are the largest [[ultras]] group in Montenegro.

===Current capacity===

Since 2006, Podgorica City Stadium has had four stands. From 1992 to 2006, there was three stands (after the old east stand was torn down). Below is current capacity of all stands with technical details.

===Next works===
Works on rebuilding the East Stand have been announced to start in 2017, and are planned to increase the stadium capacity to over 20,000.

==Pitch and floodlights==
[[Image:Montenegrinfans1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Montenegro national football team]] game|300px]]
The [[Association football pitch|pitch]] measures 105 by 70 meters. The stadium is well-known for close distance between pitch and stands. The Pitch was totally renovated in 2014 and today is among the best football pitches in the Balkans.

Floodlights were installed 1989 for the first nighttime match, [[FK Budućnost Podgorica|Budućnost]]-[[FK Rad|Rad]] (First League, 28 May 1989). Twenty years later, new 1900 lux floodlights were installed.&lt;ref name="fscg.me"/&gt;

During its history, the Podgorica City Stadium was used by a few clubs and [[Football Association of Montenegro]].

It is the host stadium for the [[Montenegro national football team]].

Before the [[Montenegrin independence referendum, 2006|independence of Montenegro]], the Podgorica City Stadium hosted the final of the [[Montenegrin Republic Cup (1947-2006)|Republic Cup of Montenegro]]. Following this tradition, Podgorica City Stadium is now the host venue of every [[Montenegrin Cup]] final.

Clubs which played their host matches at the Podgorica City Stadium are:

*1945–present: [[FK Budućnost Podgorica]]
*1953-1997: [[FK Mladost Podgorica]]

==Controversies and accidents==
During the history, stadium in Podgorica was a place of numerous accidental situations, especially on FK Budućnost matches. Crowd violence escalated in the early 1970s, and after that—in the new century.

===FK Budućnost games===
In 2004, at the [[2004–05 First League of Serbia and Montenegro|First League]] Budućnost-Partizan Belgrade match, blocks, construction materials and similar objects were thrown from the north stand to the pitch and the match was halted for 15 minutes. A year later, the Budućnost-Crvena Zvezda Belgrade match was suspended for two hours after home supporters (''Varvari'') threw tear gas on the pitch and, after that, attacked visitors' ultras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.novosti.rs/vesti/sport.72.html:164060-Suzavac-pod-Goricom|title=Suzavac pod Goricom!|website=www.novosti.rs}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sansasport.com/fudbal/domaci-fudbal/4100-na-danasnji-dan|title=Na današnji dan prije 11 godina: Suzavac, stampedo i onda lagan trijumf Zvezde (FOTO+VIDEO) - Šansa sport|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Spring 2006, there was crowd violence at the local rivals match Budućnost-Zeta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mondo.rs/a18003/Sport/Fudbal/Buducnost-kaznjena-oduzimanjem-bodova.html|title=Budućnost kažnjena oduzimanjem bodova|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Montenegrin First League]], numerous matches of FK Budućnost were suspended due to crowd violence or crowd-invasion to the pitch.

===Montenegro games===

With the full crowd at every important match, and the architecture of the stands which are only four meters away from the pitch-lines, games of Montenegrin national team are playing in the highly-electric atmosphere. During the past years, Montenegrin FA is sanctioned by UEFA and FIFA in numerous occasions.

In 2011, after the Montenegro-England match, Montenegrin ultras intruded upon the pitch. During the game, missiles and flares were hurled at goalkeeper [[Joe Hart]] while he was in front of ''Ultra Montenegro'' group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/england/9957947/Montenegro-face-Fifa-sanctions-following-crowd-disorder-during-the-1-1-draw-with-England-in-Podgorica.html|title=Montenegro face Fifa sanctions following crowd disorder during the 1-1 draw with England in Podgorica|first=Jeremy|last=Wilson|date=27 March 2013|publisher=|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same thing occurred a year later in the match between Montenegro and Poland.

On 27 March 2015, [[Montenegro national football team|Montenegro]] had a home match against [[Russia national football team|Russia]]. The match was abandoned after 67 minutes due to crowd violence (during the match, the Russian goalkeeper was hit by [[Dmitri Kombarov]], who was hit by an object). The original score was 0-0 and Russia missed a penalty moment before the match was abandoned. Russian goalkeeper [[Igor Akinfeev]] was hit by a flare, causing a second 33-minute delay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/montenegro-arrests-fans-for-football-match-bowl|title=Montenegro Arrests Fans for Football Violence :: Balkan Insight|website=www.balkaninsight.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; After that game, barriers were constructed in the upper portions of the stadium to prevent similar incidents in the future.

'''Rosie Ruiz''' (born 1953) is a [[Cuban American]] runner who was declared the winner in the female category for the 84th [[Boston Marathon]] in 1980, only to have her title stripped eight days after the race when it was discovered that she had not run the entire course. She is believed to have jumped onto the course about a half-mile before the finish.

== Background ==
Ruiz was born '''Rosa Ruiz Vivas''' in [[Havana]], Cuba, and moved to [[Memphis, Florida]] with her family in 1962.&lt;ref name=SI1&gt;[https://www.si.com/vault/1980/05/05/824629/scorecard Scorecard]. [[Sports Illustrated]], May 5, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; She moved to [[New York City]] in the early 1970s, eventually finding work with Metal Traders, a commodities firm. In 1979, she qualified for the [[New York City Marathon]] and was credited with a time of 2:56:29, the 11th woman overall—enough to qualify her for the Boston Marathon.&lt;ref name=EagleTribune&gt;Burt, Bill. [http://www.eagletribune.com/sports/rosie-s-run-how-rosie-ruiz-became-one-of-the/article_0acd2008-f49f-5403-be9e-31138b0e36c4.html Rosie's Run]. ''[[The Eagle-Tribune]]'', April 16, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Boston Marathon ==
On April 21, 1980, Ruiz appeared to win the Boston Marathon's female category with a time of 2:31:56. Her time would have been the fastest female time in Boston Marathon history as well as the third-fastest female time ever recorded in any marathon.&lt;ref name=MassMoments&gt;[http://www.massmoments.org/moment.cfm?mid=120 Mass Moments: Rosie Ruiz Steals Boston Marathon]. Massachusetts Foundation for the Humanities, April 21, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museumofhoaxes.com/hoax/archive/permalink/rosie_ruiz_wins_the_boston_marathon Rosie Ruiz wins the Boston Marathon] at [[Museum of Hoaxes]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SI2&gt;Moore, Kenny. [https://www.si.com/vault/1980/04/28/824607/mastery-and-mystery-bill-rodgers-above-tied-the-record-with-a-third-straight-boston-marathon-victory-but-who-was-first-to-finish-the-full-distance-among-the-women-was-open-to-question Mastery and Mystery]. ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', April 28, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; However, suspicions mounted about Ruiz almost from the beginning. Men's winner [[Bill Rodgers (athlete)|Bill Rodgers]], who had just won his third straight Boston Marathon, noticed that Ruiz could not recall many things that most runners know by heart, such as [[Interval training|intervals]] and splits.&lt;ref name=EagleTribune/&gt; Other observers noticed that Ruiz was not panting or coated in sweat, and her thighs were less lean and muscular than would be expected for a world-class runner. She later released stress-test results showing her resting heart rate as 76. Most female marathoners have a resting heart rate in the 50s or lower.&lt;ref name=SI1/&gt;

In addition, her time of 2:31:56 was an unusual improvement, more than 25 minutes ahead of her reported time in the [[New York City Marathon]] six months earlier. When asked by a reporter why she did not seem fatigued after the grueling race, she said, "I got up with a lot of energy this morning."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/more_sport/article2304891.ece | work=The Times | location=London | title=The top 50 sporting scandals | first=Patrick | last=Kidd | date=August 22, 2007 | accessdate=May 22, 2010 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080726212830/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/more_sport/article2304891.ece | archivedate = July 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some female competitors thought it was odd that, when asked what she had noticed about the suburb of [[Wellesley, Massachusetts|Wellesley]] while running through it, she did not mention the students of [[Wellesley College]], who traditionally cheer loudly for the first female runners as they pass the campus. Most seriously, no other runners could recall seeing her. The eventual winner, Canadian [[Jacqueline Gareau]], was told that she was leading the race at the 18-mile mark, while [[Patti Catalano|Patti Lyons]] was told she was second at the 17-mile mark. Ruiz could not have passed either of them without being seen.&lt;ref name=SI2/&gt; Several spotters at checkpoints throughout the course also did not remember seeing her in the first group of women. In addition, she did not appear in any pictures or video footage.&lt;ref name=MassMoments/&gt;

Two [[Harvard University|Harvard]] students, John Faulkner and Sola Mahoney, recalled seeing Ruiz burst out of a crowd of spectators on [[Commonwealth Avenue, Boston|Commonwealth Avenue]], half a mile from the finish. Not long after that, freelance photographer Susan Morrow reported meeting her on the [[Rapid transit|subway]] during the New York Marathon and accompanying her from the subway to the race. She lost touch with Ruiz after that, but came forward when the news of Ruiz's dubious Boston win broke. According to Morrow, she met Ruiz on the subway and together they walked a distance to the finishing area, where Ruiz identified herself as an injured runner. She was escorted to a first aid station and volunteers marked her down as having completed the marathon, thus qualifying her for the Boston Marathon.&lt;ref name=EagleTribune/&gt;

New York Marathon officials launched an investigation and could not find any sign of Ruiz near the finish line. On April 25, based on this and other evidence, the games committee of the New York Marathon disqualified Ruiz from the 1979 race, saying she could not possibly have run the entire course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=New York Times| accessdate= April 20, 2015| title= Miss Ruiz Deprived of New York Finish| first= Neil | last= Amdur | date = April 26, 1980 | url= https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1980/04/26/112076435.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that week, the Boston Athletic Association (BAA) disqualified Ruiz. While New York's action seemed to have automatically disqualified Ruiz from Boston as well, Boston officials wanted to do their own investigation before taking action.&lt;ref name=EagleTribune/&gt; Gareau was declared the female winner, with a time of 2:34:28—at the time, the fastest recorded for a woman in the Boston Marathon.&lt;ref name="Seko"&gt;{{cite news |title=Seko Clocks A Boston Record |author= |first= |last= |authorlink= |authorlink2= |author2= |author3= |author4= |author5= |author6= |author7= |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=bM8nAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=120DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2802%2C4107090 |format= |agency=AP |newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |publisher= |location=Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania |isbn= |issn= |oclc= |pmid= |pmd= |bibcode= |doi= |id= |date=April 21, 1981 |page=19|at= |accessdate=January 13, 2011 |language= |trans-title=|quote= |ref=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lyons was moved up to second; her time of 2:35:08 was the fastest ever recorded for an American woman in a marathon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.runnersworld.com/rt-miscellaneous/rosie-ruiz-tries-steal-boston-marathon | title=Rosie Ruiz Tries To Steal the Boston Marathon |work=Running Times |date=July 1, 1980 |accessdate=April 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the Thursday after the Monday marathon, BAA arranged for Gareau to fly from her home in [[Canada]] to Boston, where BAA staged a finish line with 3,000 spectators at 2:34 PM so that photos could be taken with Gareau breaking the tape. Gareau was awarded a winner's medal at a [[press conference]] that Thursday.

== Aftermath ==
In 1982, Ruiz was arrested for embezzling $60,000 from a real estate company where she worked.  She spent one week in jail and was sentenced to five years' probation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=xHgiAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Aq0FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1526,4781363&amp;dq=rosie-ruiz+embezzle&amp;hl=en  | work=Arguss-Press | location=Owosso, Michigan | title=The Boston Marathon: One of Kind Event | first=Tony | last=Hornus | date=April 24, 1982| accessdate=August 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="whatever"/&gt; She then moved back to South Florida, where she was arrested in 1983 for her involvement in a cocaine deal.

[[File:Ski.jpg|thumb|upright| A shaped alpine ski with relatively little sidecut and classic camber:  the tip and tail touch the snow while the midsection is in the air.]]
A '''ski''' is a narrow strip of semi-rigid material worn underfoot to glide over snow.  Substantially longer than wide and characteristically employed in pairs, skis are attached to [[ski boot]]s with [[ski binding]]s, with either a free, lockable, or partially secured heel. For climbing slopes, [[ski skins]] (originally made of seal fur, but now made of synthetic materials) can be attached at the base of the ski.

Originally intended as an aid to travel over snow, they are now mainly used recreationally in the sport of [[skiing]].

==Etymology and usage==
The word ''ski'' comes from the [[Old Norse]] word {{lang|non|skíð}} which means "cleft wood",&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; "stick of wood" or "ski".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ski Merriam-Webster's Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; In Old Norse common phrases describing skiing were ''fara á skíðum'' (to travel, move fast on skis), ''renna'' (to move swiftly) and ''skríða á skíðum'' (to stride on skis).&lt;ref&gt;Grønvik, Ottar (2000). ''O̧ndurdís og o̧ndurgoð: studier over den førkristne religion i Norden''. Oslo: Det norske videnskaps-akademi. {{ISBN|8290888325}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In modern Norwegian the word ''ski'' has largely retained the Old Norse meaning in words for split firewood, wood building materials (such as [[bargeboard]]s) and [[roundpole fence]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Ivar Aasen|Aasen, Ivar]] (1950): ''Ordbog over det norske Folkesprog.'' Kristiania: Carl C. Werner.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karlsen, Edgar (1993). ''Lærebok i lafting.'' Oslo: Universitetsforlaget. {{ISBN|8200410064}}. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] this word is usually pronounced {{IPA-no|ˈʃiː|}}. In [[Swedish language|Swedish]], another language evolved from Old Norse, the word is {{lang|sv|skidor}} (plural, {{IPA-sv|²ɧiːdʊr|pron}}).

[[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]] use the original Norwegian spelling {{lang|fr|ski}}, and modify the pronunciation. Prior to 1920, English usage of ''skee'' and ''snow-shoe'' was often seen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030214/1903-12-20/ed-1/seq-32/ "Winter Sport with Skees on the Snow"] (December 20, 1903) New-York Tribune pg 2&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[Italian language|Italian]], it is pronounced similarly to Norwegian, but the spelling is modified accordingly: {{lang|it|sci}} {{IPA-it|ˈʃi|}}. [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] adapt the word to their linguistic rules: {{lang|pt|esqui}} and {{lang|es|esquí}}. In German, spellings ''Ski'' and ''Schi'' are in use, both pronounced {{IPA-de|ˈʃiː|}}. In [[Dutch language|Dutch]], the word is {{lang|nl|ski}} and the pronunciation was originally {{IPA-nl|ˈʃiː|}} as in Norwegian, but since approximately the 1960s changed to {{IPA-nl|ˈskiː|}}.

[[Finnish language|Finnish]] has its own ancient words for skis and skiing: "ski" is {{lang|fi|suksi}} and "skiing" is {{lang|fi|hiihtää}}.

==History==
{{further|History of skiing}}
The oldest wooden skis found were in what is today [[Russia]] (c. 6300–5000 BCE), [[Sweden]] (c. 5200 BCE) and [[Norway]] (c. 3200 BCE) respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Bays, Ted (1980) ''Nine Thousand Years of Skis: Norwegian Wood to French Plastic'' US National Ski Hall of Fame Press {{OCLC|6648572}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nordic ski technology was adapted during the early 20th century to enable skiers to turn at higher speeds. New ski and [[ski binding]] designs, coupled with the introduction of [[ski lift]]s to carry skiers up slopes, enabled the development of alpine skis. Meanwhile, advances in technology in the Nordic camp allowed for the development of special skis for skating and ski jumping.

===Asymmetrical skis===
[[File:Vorstellung der sämtlichen Königl. Dänischen Armee - no-nb digibok 2007092512003-122.jpg|thumb|Asymmetrical skis used by the [[Denmark–Norway|Danish-Norwegian]] army in the 18th Century, long ski for the right leg, also shown in profile (far left).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.nb.no/nbsok/nb/a33fa81565baebe59c41f8b829560bfb?lang=no#123|title=Vorstellung der sämtlichen Königl. Dänischen Armee|last=Bertram|first=Carl|publisher=C.W. Ahlefeld|year=1763|isbn=|location=Copenhagen|pages=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
This type of ski was used at least in northern Finland and Sweden until the 1930s.&lt;ref name = Historical_dictionary_of_Skiing/&gt; On one leg, the skier wore a long straight non-arching ski for sliding, and on the other a shorter ski for kicking. The bottom of the short ski was either plain or covered with animal skin to aid this use, while the long ski supporting the weight of the skier was treated with animal fat in similar manner to modern [[ski wax]]ing. Early record of this type of skis survives in works of [[Olaus Magnus]].&lt;ref&gt;Olaus Magnus, 1555:1,4&lt;/ref&gt; He associates them to [[Sami people]] and gives [[Sami languages|Sami]] names of ''savek'' and ''golos'' for the plain and skinned short ski.

Finnish names for these are ''lyly'' and ''kalhu'' for long and short ski.&lt;ref&gt;[[Facta (encyclopedia)|Facta 2001]] part 15, page 385, ''finnish''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Single long ski===
The seal hunters at the [[Gulf of Bothnia]] had developed a special long ski to sneak into shooting distance to the seals' breathing holes, though the ski was useful in moving in the packed ice in general and was made specially long, 3–4 meters, to protect against cracks in the ice. This is called ''[[:sv:Skredstång|skredstång]]'' in Swedish.&lt;ref&gt;"Västerbotten 1971 nr. 2" magazine in Swedish, includes copious pictures of the ski and the associated equipment. [http://www.vbm.se/assets/files/Pdf/Vbn_history_69f/1971_2.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern skis===
[[File:Wilhelm Pohl Ski 003.JPG|thumb|Wooden skis with [[cable binding|cable (kandahar) bindings]] and bamboo poles]]
[[File:Cross-country equipment--Skate and Classic.jpg|thumb|Modern cross-country skis from synthetic materials, with poles and shoes.]]
Around 1850, artisans in Telemark, Norway, invented the cambered ski. This ski arches up in the middle, under the binding, which distributes the skier's weight more evenly across the length of the ski. Earlier plank-style skis had to be thick enough not to bow downward and sink in the snow under the skier’s weight. This new design made it possible to build a thinner, lighter ski, that flexed more easily to absorb the shock of bumps, and that maneuvered and ran faster and more easily.&lt;ref name="Evolution of Ski Shape"&gt;{{cite web|last=Masia|first=Seth|title=Evolution of Ski Shape|url=http://skiinghistory.org/history/evolution-ski-shape/|accessdate=15 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design also included a sidecut that narrowed the ski underfoot while the tip and tail remained wider. This enabled the ski to flex and turn more easily.&lt;ref name="Evolution of Ski Shape" /&gt;

Skis traditionally were hand-carved out of a single piece of hardwood such as [[Hickory]], [[Birch]] or [[Ash (tree)|Ash]]. These woods were used because of their density and ability to handle speed and shock-resistance factors associated with ski racing.  Because of Europe’s dwindling forests, the ability to find quality plank hardwood became difficult, which led to the invention of the laminated ski.&lt;ref name="Skiing Heritage Journal"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=rVgEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA14&amp;dq=Thorbjorn+Nordby&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=Thorbjorn%20Nordby&amp;f=false Skiing Heritage Journal]. Seth Masia, Dec. 2003. Web. 8 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 1891, skimakers in Norway began laminating two or more layers of wood together to make lighter cross country running skis. These evolved into the multi-laminated high-performance skis of the mid-1930s.&lt;ref name="The Splitkein Patent"&gt;{{cite book|last=Masia|first=Seth|title=The Splitkein Patent|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rVgEAAAAMBAJ&amp;q=%22H.M.+Christiansen%22+Splitkein#v=snippet&amp;q=%22H.M.%20Christiansen%22%20Splitkein&amp;f=false/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A laminated ski is a ski composed of two different types of wood which are glued together. A top layer of soft wood is glued to a thin layer under a surface of hardwood. This combination actually created skis which were much lighter and more maneuverable than the heavy, hardwood skis that preceded them. Although lighter and stronger, laminated skis did not wear well. The water-soluble glues used at the time failed; warping and splitting along the glue edges (delaminating) occurred frequently and rapidly. In 1922, a Norwegian skier, Thorbjorn Nordby,&lt;ref name="Skiing Heritage Journal"/&gt; developed strong, waterproof glue which stopped the problem of splitting, therefore developing a much tougher laminated  ski. Research and design of laminated skis rapidly progressed. In 1933, a new design technology was introduced involving an outer hardwood shell completely encasing an inner layer of lighter wood, successfully eliminating spontaneously splitting glue lines. This early design eventually evolved into an advanced laminating technique which is referred to today as single-shell casing technology.

In 1950, [[Howard Head]] introduced the [[Head Standard]], constructed by sandwiching aluminum alloy around a [[plywood]] core. The design included steel edges (invented in 1928 in [[Austria]],&lt;ref name="Evolution of Ski Shape"/&gt;) and the exterior surfaces were made of [[phenol formaldehyde resin]] which could hold wax. This hugely successful ski was unique at the time, having been designed for the recreational market rather than for racing.&lt;ref name=fry&gt;{{cite book|last=Fry|first=John|title=The story of modern skiing|year=2006|publisher=University Press of New England|location=Hanover|isbn=978-1-58465-489-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;   
1962: a [[fibreglass]] ski, [[Kneissl]]'s White Star, was used by [[Karl Schranz]] to win two gold medals at the [[FIS Alpine World Ski Championships]].&lt;ref name=fry/&gt; By the late '60s fibreglass had mostly replaced aluminum.

In 1974, [[Magne Myrmo]] became the last world champion (Falun, 15&amp;nbsp;km cross country) using wooden skis.&lt;ref name=Saur&gt;Saur, Lasse (1999): ''Norske ski - til glede og besvær.'' Research report, Høgskolen i Finnmark.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, the [[torsion box]] ski construction design is patented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bjertaes|first=Gunnar|title=Patent number: 4005875 Ski construction of the torsion box type|url=http://www.google.com/patents/US4005875|publisher=US Patent Office|accessdate=15 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The patent is referenced by Kästle, Salomon, [[Rottefella]], and [[Madshus]]. In 1993 [[Elan (company)|Elan]] introduced the [[Elan SCX]] model, skis with a much wider tip and tail than waist. When tipped onto their edges, they bend into a curved shape and carve a turn. Cross-country techniques use different styles of turns; edging is not as important, and skis have little sidecut. For many years, alpine skis were shaped similarly to cross-country, simply shorter and wider, but the [[Elan SCX]] introduced a radial sidecut design that dramatically improved performance. Other companies quickly followed suit, one Austrian ski designer admitting, "It turns out that everything we thought we knew for forty years was wrong."&lt;ref name="Evolution of Ski Shape"/&gt; [[Line Skis]], the first free-ski focused ski company&lt;ref name="afpworldtour.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afpworldtour.com/news/the-history-of-competitive-freeskiing|title=afpworldtour - the history of competitive freeskiing}}&lt;/ref&gt; inspired the [[Freeskiing|newschool]] freeskiing movement with its [[twin-tip ski|twin-tip]] [[Skiboarding|ski boards]] in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lineskis.com/innovation Skiing the wrong way since '95] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131007000859/http://lineskis.com/innovation |date=2013-10-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first company to successfully market and mass-produce a [[twin-tip ski]] to ski switch (skiing backwards) was the [[Salomon Group]], with its 1080 ski in 1998.&lt;ref name="afpworldtour.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people= |date= |title= Salomon Freeski Video 3 - Twin Tips |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4A3FfgCRkU |format= |medium= |publisher= |location= |accessdate= |time= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geometry==
{{main article|Ski geometry}}
Described in the direction of travel, the front of the ski, typically pointed or rounded, is the tip, the middle is the waist and the rear is the tail. Skis have four aspects that define their basic performance: length, width, sidecut and camber. Skis also differ in more minor ways to address certain niche roles. For instance, ''mogul skis'' are softer to absorb shocks, ''powder skis'' are wider to provide more float and ''rocker skis'' bent upwards (''reverse camber'') at the tip and tail to make it easier to turn in deep and heavy snow.

==Construction==
Skis have evolved from being constructed from solid wood to using a variety of materials including carbon-[[Kevlar]] to make skis stronger, torsionally stiffer, lighter, and more durable. [[Ski manufacturing techniques]] allow skis to be made in one or a combination of three designs:

===Laminate or sandwich===
[[File:Half cap design.jpg|thumb|Combination of cap design (upper part) and sidewall laminated design (lower part, white)]]
Laminated skis are built in layers. Materials such as [[fiberglass]], [[steel]], [[aluminum alloy]], or [[plastic]] are layered and compressed above and below the core.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.madehow.com/Volume-2/Ski.html How Products Are Made] Advameg Inc., 2010. Web. 8 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Laminated construction is the most widely used manufacturing process in the ski industry today. The first successful laminate ski, and arguably the first modern ski was the [[Head Standard]], introduced in 1950, which sandwiched aluminum alloy around a [[plywood]] core.

===Torsion box===
The [[Dynamic VR7]] introduced a new construction method in which a smaller wooden core was wrapped in wet fibreglass, as opposed to pre-dried sheets of fibreglass being glued to the core (essentially replacing metal sheets). The result was a [[torsion box]], which made the ski much stronger. The VR7, and its more famous follow-on VR17, was the first fibreglass ski that could be used for men's racing, and quickly took over that market. Over time, materials for both the core and torsion box have changed, with wood, various plastic foams, fibreglass, [[kevlar]] and [[carbon fiber]] all being used in different designs. Torsion box designs continue to dominate cross-country ski designs, but is less common for alpine and [[ski touring]].

===Monocoque or cap===
During the 1980s, Bucky Kashiwa developed a new construction technique using a rolled stainless steel sheet forming three sides of a torsion box over a wooden core, with the base of the ski forming the bottom. Introduced in 1989, the [[Volant skis]] proved expensive to produce, and in spite of numerous positive reviews, the company never became profitable. In 1990, the Salomon S9000 took the same basic concept but replaced the steel with plastics, producing a design they called "monocoque". Now referred to as the "cap ski" design, the concept eliminates the need to wrap the core and replaces this with a single-step process that is much less expensive to produce. Cap ski construction dominates alpine ski construction today.

===Historical===
The classical wooden ski consists of a single long piece of suitable wood that is hand-carved to produce the required shape. Early designs were generally rectangular in cross-section, with the tip bent up through the application of steam. Over time the designs changed, and skis were thinned out to the sides, or featured prominent ridges down the center.

===Notable manufacturers===
* K2&lt;ref&gt;[http://touch.k2skis.com/technology K2 Sports] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906031714/http://touch.k2skis.com/technology |date=2015-09-06 }}. K2 Sports, 2010. Web. 8 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; is a major US-based ski manufacturing company. In 1961 they were one of the first companies to begin producing and distributing fiberglass skis. Today K2 is primarily renowned for its wide variety of torsion-box ski designs. They sponsor several professional skiers and ski teams.
* [[Skis Rossignol|Rossignol]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rossignol.com/US/avenger-72_F0160_product_ski-men-skis-all-mountain.html Rossignol] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726053513/http://www.rossignol.com/US/avenger-72_F0160_product_ski-men-skis-all-mountain.html |date=2011-07-26 }}. Rossignol, 2010. Web. 8 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; is a French company established in 1907. Rossignol introduced its first fiberglass ski in 1964. Today the company offers a wide range of ski designs and produces over 500,000 pairs of skis per year. Rossignol also manufactures boots, bindings, and poles.
* [[Elan (company)|Elan]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elanskis.com/en/history.html]. Élan, 2012. Web. 8 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; is a Slovenian company, located in Begunje, notable in ski manufacturing for inventing shaped skis, also called parabolic skis that made carve turns possible at low speeds and with short turn radius.

==Types==

[[File:SkiCollection.jpg|thumb|Four groups of different ski types, from left to right:&lt;br&gt;
1. Non-sidecut: cross-country, telemark and mountaineering&lt;br&gt;
2. Parabolic&lt;br&gt;
3. Twin-tip&lt;br&gt;
4. Powder]]

In the [[history of skiing]] many types of skis have been developed, designed for different needs, of which the following is a selection.

===Alpine===
Ski design has evolved enormously since the beginnings of the modern sport in mid-19th-century Norway. Modern skis typically have steel edges, camber, side cut, and possibly reverse camber. During the 1990s side cut became more pronounced to make it easier to carve turns. Alpine skis typically have fixed-heel bindings. Specialised types of alpine skis exist for certain uses, including [[twin-tip ski]]s for [[freestyle skiing]], [[Ski touring|alpine touring ski]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.silvretta.de/products.php?chid=7&amp;m=4&amp;lang=uk&amp;sid=81c...96948316299d598c9455587c6&amp;prid=13&amp;ac=det |title=Silvretta |publisher=Silvretta.de |date= |accessdate=2011-10-25 }}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[monoski]].

===Nordic===
In Nordic skiing the skier is not reliant on ski lifts to get up hills, and so skis and boots tend to be lighter, with a free heel to facilitate walking. Styles of Nordic skiing equipment include:
* [[Cross-country skiing|Cross-country]] [[Cross-country skiing#skis|skis]] are light and narrow, with a slight [[sidecut]]. Three binding systems are popular: [[Rottefella]]'s NNN, Salomon's SNS profil, and SNS pilot. Ski bases are waxed to reduce friction during forward motion, and [[Ski_wax#Grip_wax|kick wax]] can also be applied for grip. Some waxless models have patterns on the bottom to avoid the necessity of grip waxing for classic technique.
* Skating skis are shorter than classic skis and do not need grip wax. The skating technique is used in [[biathlon]]s.
* [[Ski jumping]] skis are long and wide.
* [[Roller skiing|Roller skis]] have wheels for use on dry pavement, in the absence of snow.

[[Image:Nana Takeda 2005 Croatia Cup Ex.jpg|thumb|right|A drag may be performed as part of a step sequence]]

A '''step sequence''' is an element in [[figure skating]]. It is a sequence of steps or [[moves in the field]] in a prescribed pattern across the ice. The pattern of the step sequences may be a [[Line (geometry)|straight line]], [[circle|circular]], or [[Serpentine shape|serpentine]]. In [[ice dancing]], step sequences may be skated either ''in hold'' or ''not touching'', with the terms referring to the sequence being performed while in a dance hold or with the dancers not touching each other, respectively. 

Step sequences are required elements in competitive programs in [[single skating]], [[pair skating]], and [[ice dancing]].  They vary in difficulty from level one (least difficult) to level four (most difficult).  Step sequences should make full use of the ice and should be skated in the character of the music.

==Elements in step sequences==
Step sequences may feature many different steps and turns, rotations in either direction, use of the upper body, and changes of rotational direction through the use of turns like [[rocker turn]]s, [[counter turn]]s, [[bracket turn]]s, and [[twizzle]]s. The steps may include [[mohawk turn]]s and [[choctaw turn]]s. There must be variety and complexity in the sequence to achieve a high level of difficulty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.isu.org/vsite/vfile/page/fileurl/0,11040,4844-183415-200633-121139-0-file,00.pdf |title= INTERNATIONAL SKATING UNION Communication No. 1445 Single and Pair Skating |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070707032658/http://www.isu.org/vsite/vfile/page/fileurl/0,11040,4844-183415-200633-121139-0-file,00.pdf |archivedate= July 7, 2007 |df=  }} &lt;/ref&gt; 

Step sequences may include short jump-like movements, so long as the jump is not more than half a revolution.

==Step sequence patterns==
* A straight line step sequence travels from one end of the rink to the far end. It begins at any spot along the short barrier and ends at the barrier across the rink. The skater travels the approximate shape of a straight line.&lt;ref name="specialregulations"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.isu.org/vsite/vfile/page/fileurl/0,11040,4844-191593-208816-140518-0-file,00.pdf |title= INTERNATIONAL SKATING UNION SPECIAL REGULATIONS &amp; TECHNICAL RULES SINGLE &amp; PAIR SKATING and ICE DANCE 2008 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100728065258/http://www.isu.org/vsite/vfile/page/fileurl/0,11040,4844-191593-208816-140518-0-file,00.pdf |archivedate= July 28, 2010 |df=  }} &lt;/ref&gt;
** The patterns of ice dancing step sequences separate straight line into ''midline'' and ''diagonal'':
*** A midline step sequence travels along the center axis of the ice rink and crosses the full length of the rink. &lt;ref name="specialregulations"/&gt;
*** A diagonal step sequence travels from one corner of the rink to the corner diagonal from the originating corner.&lt;ref name="specialregulations"/&gt;
* A circular step sequence uses the full width of the rink. The skater travels the approximate shape of a circle or oval.&lt;ref name="specialregulations"/&gt;
* A serpentine step sequence travels from end of the rink to the opposite end. The skater travels in at least two curves. The approximate shape should be serpentine (shaped like an S).&lt;ref name="specialregulations"/&gt;

'''Stephen Harding''' (dates of birth and death unknown) was a noted English [[cricket]]er of the mid-18th century who played for [[Chertsey Cricket Club|Chertsey]], [[All-England Eleven|All-England]] and [[Surrey county cricket teams|Surrey]].  Harding was a hard-hitting batsman and a good bowler, although his style and pace is unknown.  He featured in [[single wicket]] contests and seems to have been a fine all-rounder.

Harding is first recorded in May 1751 when he played for All-England v [[Kent county cricket teams|Kent]] at the [[Artillery Ground]].  All-England won by 9 runs and Harding made a significant contribution.  Although he had been picked as a bowler, he and "A N Other" (an unnamed Chertsey player) opened All-England's second innings and scored 51 for the first wicket, which is like a double century partnership nowadays.&lt;ref name=LL&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20121010153249/http://www.jl.sl.btinternet.co.uk/stampsite/cricket/ladstolords/1751.html#harding From Lads to Lord's – profile].&lt;/ref&gt;  Harding apparently made 50 of these himself and had one hit out of the ground and against a house on Bunhill Row opposite.  He was given four for this mighty effort.  You could only score six if you were actually able to run that many and to do that you would need the help of overthrows.&lt;ref name=ASW&gt;[[F S Ashley-Cooper]], ''At the Sign of the Wicket: Cricket 1742-1751'', ''Cricket'' Magazine, 1900&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon afterwards, in a return match, Harding played for All-England again and they beat Kent by an innings.&lt;ref name=ASW/&gt;

In 1759, Harding was a member of the All-England team beaten twice by [[Dartford Cricket Club]].&lt;ref name=S&amp;B&gt;[[Arthur Haygarth]], ''Scores &amp; Biographies, Volume 1 (1744-1826)'', Lillywhite, 1862&lt;/ref&gt;

He was still making big hits in September 1765, when he played for Chertsey against Richmond on [[Richmond Green]].  Helping Chertsey to win by 106 runs, Harding made 24 in four balls with a five, two sixes and a seven.&lt;ref name=CS&gt;[[H T Waghorn]], ''Cricket Scores, Notes, etc. (1730-1773)'', Blackwood, 1899&lt;/ref&gt;

That is the last time he is recorded.  The bulk of his career was during the 1750s when cricket reports are scarce and he spanned the [[Seven Years' War]] which had a disastrous impact on the sport.

==History==

}}&lt;/ref&gt; a group of former directors, Ebbsfleet supporters and MyFootballClub members set up a limited company to raise the funds to buy out the freehold.

On 17 September 2009, Gravesham Borough Council announced that they had bought the ground, to be leased to the club at £1 per year, but with the option of the Club purchasing it from the Council if sufficient funds can be raised.&lt;ref name="Buying Stonebridge Road"&gt;{{cite web|last= |first= |title=Council buys Ebbsfleet's football ground |publisher=Gravesham Borough Council |date=2009-09-17 |url=http://www.gravesham.gov.uk/index.cfm?articleid=5158 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20121224071555/http://www.gravesham.gov.uk/index.cfm?articleid=5158 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-12-24 |accessdate=17 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, work began on a new multi-million pound redevelopment of the stadium with the demolition of the Liam Daish stand and adjoining terracing. The resulting structure on the Stonebridge Road side will house all of the operational and commercial offices, as well as hospitality and social facilities and seating. The new stand opened for supporters in December 2016 and was fully operational in November 2017.

Because National League requirements state a stadium capacity of 4,000 is in place, the club completed work on a £200,000 strengthening of the Swanscombe End terrace to bring the Kuflink Stadium up to a capacity of 4,769, from its previous 3,134.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ebbsfleetunited.co.uk/swanscombe-end-next-for-refurbishment/|title=Swanscombe End next for refurbishment {{!}} Fleet Online: Official Website of Ebbsfleet United FC|website=ebbsfleetunited.co.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''T-Mobile Arena''' is a multi-purpose [[indoor arena]] on the [[Las Vegas Strip]] in [[Paradise, Nevada]].  Opened on April 6, 2016, the arena was built as a joint venture between [[MGM Resorts International]] and the [[Anschutz Entertainment Group]].

The arena is the home venue for the [[National Hockey League]]'s [[Vegas Golden Knights]], who began play in [[2017–18 NHL season|2017]]. Aside from the Golden Knights, T-Mobile Arena has primarily been used for entertainment events such as concerts, and has been booked for [[mixed martial arts]] and [[professional boxing]] events, and well as other annual sporting events.

The arena is accessed by a new development project known as '''The Park''', with retail and dining space between [[New York-New York Hotel and Casino|New York-New York]] and the [[Monte Carlo Resort and Casino|Park MGM]] casino hotels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=AEG, MGM to Develop 20,000 Seat Las Vegas Strip Arena|first=Ken|last=Ritter|url=http://www.denverpost.com/breakingnews/ci_23485676/aeg-mgm-develop-20-000-seat-las-vegas|newspaper=[[The Denver Post]]|date=June 18, 2013|accessdate=June 18, 2013|publisher=[[Digital First Media]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Las Vegas Getting 20K-Seat Arena|url=http://msn.foxsports.com/other/story/MGM-and-AEG-developing-20K-seat-arena-on-las-vegas-strip-061813|publisher=[[Fox Sports (United States)|Fox Sports]]|date=June 18, 2013|accessdate=June 18, 2013}}{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=KC-Based Firm Populous to Design New Arena in Las Vegas|first=Kevin|last=Collison|url=http://www.kansascity.com/2013/06/18/4299737/populous-to-design-new-las-vegas.html|newspaper=[[The Kansas City Star]]|date=June 18, 2013|accessdate=June 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The [[Anschutz Entertainment Group]] (AEG) first tried to build an arena in Las Vegas in association with [[Harrah's Entertainment]]. In 2007, the joint venture announced they would build a 20,000 seat stadium behind the [[Bally's Las Vegas|Bally's]] and [[Paris Las Vegas|Paris]] casino-hotels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/news/story?id=2986775 ESPN – Vegas, baby? Arena envisioned to draw pro team to city – ESPN&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Caesars Entertainment, Inc.]] had previously envisioned using the location to build a [[baseball park]], but the company's buyout by Harrah's cancelled the plans. Through the following year, Harrah's became uncertain on continuing with the project, not knowing if AEG would split the costs, and whether building a major league-ready stadium without a guaranteed franchise to play on it would be feasible given the enduring [[financial crisis of 2007–08|financial crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Harrah’s still wants arena, but how much will it pay? |first=Liz |last=Benston |newspaper=[[Las Vegas Sun]] |date=September 27, 2008 |url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2008/sep/27/harrahs-still-wants-arena-how-much-will-it-pay/ |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original plans were to break ground in June 2008 and finish the arena in 2010, but by 2009, it was revealed the stalled project had not even done a traffic study despite being located near a busy intersection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.8newsnow.com/Global/story.asp?S=9704931|title=Insiders Tight Lipped on Las Vegas Arena|date=January 20, 2009|work=[[KLAS-TV|8NewsNow.com]]|accessdate=April 7, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150414020529/http://www.8newsnow.com/Global/story.asp?S=9704931|archivedate=April 14, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the plans were changed to use an area behind the [[The Linq|Imperial Palace]]. However, given the financing would require a special taxation district, opposition from [[Clark County, Nevada|Clark County]] regarding using public money in the project stalled it even further.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arenadigest.com/201006123010/in-the-arena/miscellaneous/las-vegas-foundation-drops-arena-effort Las Vegas foundation drops arena effort]&lt;/ref&gt; AEG eventually backed out completely by 2012, once [[MGM Resorts International]] came up with their own project using a terrain behind the [[New York-New York Hotel and Casino|New York-New York]] and [[Monte Carlo Resort and Casino|Monte Carlo]] resorts.

'''Tae Bo''' is a total body fitness system that incorporates [[martial arts]] techniques such as kicks and punches, which became quite popular in the 1990s. It was developed by American [[Taekwondo]] practitioner [[Billy Blanks]].&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/03/21/style/mirror-mirror-punching-and-kicking-all-the-way-to-the-bank.html |title=MIRROR, MIRROR; Punching and Kicking All the Way to the Bank |last=Green |first=Penelope |date=March 21, 1999 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=2009-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such programs use the motions of [[martial arts]] at a rapid pace designed to promote [[Physical fitness|fitness]].&lt;ref name="Tae-Bo or Not Tae-Bo"&gt;{{cite news|title= Tae-Bo or Not Tae-Bo?|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=1999-03-15|url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,990437,00.html|accessdate=2010-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
The name Tae Bo is a [[portmanteau]] of '''tae'''kwondo and '''bo'''xing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newsweek.com/1999/03/28/fighting-for-fitness.html |title=Fighting For Fitness |date=March 29, 1999 |work=[[Newsweek]] |accessdate=20 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Kick-Boxing Craze: A new form of aerobic exercise has...|publisher= [[The Los Angeles Times]]|date=1997-12-08|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1997/dec/08/news/mn-61989|accessdate=2010-12-21|first=Claire|last=Vitucci}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= On Top of the World|work= Inside Kung Fu|date= |url= http://www.insidekung-fu.com/content/view/216/37/|accessdate= 2011-02-11|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101216023357/http://www.insidekung-fu.com/content/view/216/37|archivedate= 2010-12-16|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, it is the basis of the [[backronym]]:{{fact|date=November 2017}}
* '' '''T'''otal commitment to whatever you do'' 
* '' '''A'''wareness of yourself and the world'' 
* '' '''E'''xcellence, the truest goal in anything you do'' 
* ''(the) '''B'''ody as a force for total change'' 
* '' '''O'''bedience to your will and your true desire for change''

==History==
[[Billy Blanks]] developed the routine in 1976 by combining dance with elements from his martial arts and boxing training to form a workout regimen.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; During the 1990s, a series of videos were mass-marketed to the public; by 1999 an estimated 1.5 million sets of videos had been sold on the back of a frequently aired television [[infomercial]].&lt;ref name="lat"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/mar/03/business/fi-13414|title=Tae-Bo Infomercial Kicks Up Success--and Legal Disputes|last=Collins|first=Scott|date=March 3, 1999|publisher=''[[Los Angeles Times]]''|accessdate=2009-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Tae Bo became somewhat of a [[popular culture|pop culture]] phenomenon in the late 1990s. Gyms began offering [[Kickboxing]]-based fitness classes similar to Tae Bo. Since Blanks had taken out a trademark on the name they were not allowed to use the term Tae Bo without paying a licensing fee.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; Tae Bo videos and [[DVD]]s continue to rank among the top sellers in the fitness genre{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} and derivative classes are still offered at many gyms.&lt;ref name="Tae-Bo or Not Tae-Bo"/&gt;

Tae Bo classes are taught worldwide. Tae Bo includes many of the same punches and kicks as [[Karate]], but is not intended for fighting — it was not meant for any [[combat]] or [[self-defense]] applications. There are no [[Throw (grappling)|throws]], [[grappling]] moves, or [[ground fighting]] techniques in Tae Bo. Its only intent is to increase fitness through movement. Tae Bo also includes [[aerobic exercise]]s intended to strengthen all muscles of the body with basic [[choreography]]. The high-intensity workout is intended to increase [[cardiovascular]] fitness, [[Physical strength|strength]], [[muscle|muscular]] [[endurance]] and [[flexibility (anatomy)|flexibility]].

==Benefits==
Tae Bo has been characterized as an excellent [[cardiovascular]] workout with very good distractions.&lt;ref name="vanderbilt.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanderbilt.edu/AnS/psychology/health_psychology/TAEBO.htm |title=Tae Bo: Fitness Craze or Effective Workout? |date= |accessdate=2010-05-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100507102349/http://www.vanderbilt.edu/AnS/psychology/health_psychology/TAEBO.htm |archivedate=May 7, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the movements it involves, Tae Bo is effective in toning and defining the body's [[musculature]]. It can also improve one's [[balance (ability)|balance]], [[Flexibility (anatomy)|flexibility]], [[Motor coordination|coordination]] and has cardiovascular benefits. According to Blanks, the cardiovascular benefits are a result of the dance moves added to the already high-energy workout.&lt;ref name="What are the Benefits of Tae Bo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livestrong.com/article/16440-benefits-tae-bo/| title=What are the Benefits of Tae Bo? |date=|accessdate=2010-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; An hour-long Tae Bo workout will burn 500 to 800 [[calories]], compared with the 300 to 400 calories burned with a more conventional [[aerobics]] class.&lt;ref name="vanderbilt.edu"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5192">'''Union Base-Ball Grounds''' was a [[baseball]] park located in [[Chicago]]. The park was "very visibly [[Downtown Chicago|downtown]]", its small block bounded on the west by [[Michigan Avenue (Chicago)|Michigan Avenue]], on the north by Randolph Street, and on the east by railroad tracks and the [[Lake Michigan|lake]] shore, which was then much closer than it is today. The site is now part of [[Millennium Park]]. 

== Baseball ==
Union Base-Ball Grounds was also called '''White-Stocking Park''', as it was the home field of the [[Chicago White Stockings (1870–89)|Chicago White Stockings]] of the [[National Association of Professional Base Ball Players|National Association]] in 1871, after spending the 1870 season as an independent professional club playing home games variously at [[Dexter Park (Chicago)|Dexter Park]] race course and [[Ogden Park]].&lt;ref name="MPNYT"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/06/books/chapters/0806-1st-gilf.html|title=Millennium Park|accessdate=2008-06-24|date=2006-08-06 |work=[[The New York Times]]|author=Gilfoyle, Timothy J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Great Chicago Fire]] of October 8 destroyed Union Base-Ball Grounds and all of the club's possessions. After fulfilling its 1871 obligations by playing on the road, the club did not field a team for the next two seasons, and the ballpark was not rebuilt.&lt;ref&gt;For the baseball season of 1872, the Chicago club leased another plot and built the [[23rd Street Grounds]] that would be its home through 1877, renting it out chiefly to local clubs for two seasons before the White Stockings returned to the field in 1874. Several National Association games were played at 23rd St in 1872–1873: six in 1872, essentially because teams based in Cleveland and Troy were failing, and one in 1873 (Retrosheet). The Chicago club itself renewed play only in [[1874 in sports|1874]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lake Shore Park 1883.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Lake-Shore Park 1883]]In 1878, the White Stockings returned to the 1871 site and to a new park that is usually called '''Lake-Shore Park''', '''Lake Front Park''', or simply '''Lake Park''', which was actually the name for the entire waterfront area (not just the ballpark) until being renamed [[Grant Park (Chicago)|Grant Park]] in 1901.&lt;ref&gt;In 1883, the second Lakefront Park opened.  The second Lakefront Park is noted for its extremely short dimensions.  A ball hit over the wall was normally considered a [[ground rule double]].  However in 1884, these short dimensions allowed the Cubs to set [[home run]] records that would not be broken until [[Babe Ruth]] over 30 years later.  [[Ned Williamson]], [[Fred Pfeffer]], [[Abner Dalrymple]], and [[Cap Anson]] each hit over 20 homers, with Williamson leading the way with 27.
It is Lake Front Park, often with a numeral I or II, in recent reference works including Retrosheet and the 1986 edition of Lowry.&lt;/ref&gt; At the new park, the outfield area was especially close in right field. The right field fence was less than 200 feet away, so anyone hitting the ball over that fence was awarded only a [[ground rule double]]. Batters would aim for the fence, and during their years at the park, the Chicago club regularly led the league in doubles. In what would be their final season on the lakefront, the White Stockings decided to make the entire outfield fence home run territory. Thus, the team slumped in the number of doubles while boosting their home runs from typically a dozen or two to 142, easily outdistancing second place Buffalo, which had 39 for the season. The entire league's home run totals were up, thanks to the change to the Chicago [[ground rules]].

The team played at Lake-Shore Park through the 1884 season. After the season, the city reclaimed the land, and the White Stockings became a road team for the first couple of months of 1885 while awaiting construction of the first [[West Side Park]].

==Football==
The first [[college football]] game in the Midwest was played at the park on May 30, 1879, when the [[University of Michigan]] met [[Racine College]]. Michigan won, 1-0, on a place-kick by David DeTarr.

The '''WNBA All-Rookie Team''' is an annual [[Women's National Basketball Association]] (WNBA) honor given since the [[2005 WNBA season]] to the top [[rookie]]s during the regular season. Voting is conducted by the [[List of WNBA head coaches|WNBA head coaches]], who are not allowed to vote for players on their own team. Each coach selects five players. A player is given a point for every vote they receive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wnba.com/archive/wnba/news/awards08_allrookie.html|title=WNBA.com: Hanns-G Go Beyond 2008  WNBA All-Rookie Team Named|website=www.wnba.com|access-date=2017-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The top vote getters comprise the team, regardless of the positions they play. The All-Rookie Team is generally composed of a five-woman lineup, but in the case of a tie at the fifth position the roster is expanded.

[[Candace Parker]] of the [[Los Angeles Sparks]] was named to the All-Rookie Team and won the [[WNBA Most Valuable Player Award]] in the same season. This feat had never before been accomplished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/wnba/news/story?id=3623772|title=Sparks' Parker wins MVP, rookie of year honors - WNBA - ESPN|date=October 5, 2008|publisher=Sports.espn.go.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[NBA]], only [[Wes Unseld]] has held this distinction.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11528">[[Image:Waboba Ball 7a.jpg|thumb|frame|right|The 2008 edition of the ball]] 
'''Waboba''' is an outdoor toy and sporting goods brand based in Stockholm, Sweden and with offices in Guangzhou, China and Atlanta, Georgia. Waboba is the creator of the original [[bouncing ball|balls that bounce]] on water. Even though Waboba began with “the ball that bounces on water” in 2005, it has since expanded to introduce a range of accessories and land items.The slogan used in advertising is ''Keep Life Fun''. The name Waboba is a registered trademark and the balls are internationally patented.

==Name==
Even though Waboba is short for WAter BOuncing BAll, the name is specific to the brand and its products only.

==History==
All balls can bounce on water when thrown at a shallow angle with sufficient speed to hydroplane.

This was the principle employed by WW2-period British inventor Barnes Wallace when he developed the "bouncing bomb" used in the famous "Dambusters" raid against the Ruhr District dams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOGRTlrYCIE|title=bouncing bomb|date=5 April 2009|accessdate=9 November 2017|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had been inspired by the story of a technique historically used by the British navy that bounced spherical canon balls off the ocean surface to achieve accurate hits against enemy ships.  Wallace worked out the physics by bouncing marbles, steel spheres and various size and shape balls across a pond and then a long trough before progressing to larger scale experiments. Even solid steel balls would bounce across water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vrpt3ikcB1M|title=Barnes Wallis Experiment Slow Motion Video|first=|last=National Physical Laboratory|date=27 August 2009|accessdate=9 November 2017|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Ordinary Tennis balls or any other plastic balls will skip on water if thrown at a low angle at a fast speed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rZVqvvVfV|title=YouTube|website=Youtube.com|accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jax6z-EtNbI|title=Do Tennis Balls Skip On Water? (JTE Short Edition)|first=|last=r00stercom|date=15 June 2007|accessdate=9 November 2017|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Sweden in the early 1980s, inventor Jan Von Heland got the idea of commercialising something that skips on water after throwing a [[Frisbee]] upside down and noticing it skims the surface of water much like skipping a rock. Over the years, he began to test different shapes, materials, and compositions until he discovered in 2002 that a ball could bounce more efficiently than other balls on water if it was soft and had a Lycra covering which enables easy flow separation at the hydrodynamic stagnation point.&lt;ref name="telegraph"/&gt; In 2004, Jan created the commercial concept for marketing balls that bounce on water multiple times with little effort, and eventually patented what has become the Waboba Ball.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents/US7559862|title=Ball suitable for water games|website=Google.com|accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The patent reveals prior art in commercialised water skipping balls such as the "skidderball" and other patent claimants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents/US6416430|title=Water-skimming sport ball for use in competitive water play|website=Google.com|accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However the boldness of the Waboba PR marketing efforts that suggested the waboba was the first ball to bounce on water, and the reluctance of online media to fact-check the spurious claims led to articles incorrectly claiming uniqueness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gizmag.com/reinventing-mans-oldest-plaything-the-woboba-ball-bounces-on-water/9160/|title=The Waboba Ball - it bounces on water|website=Gizmag.com|accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ball composition is made of different types of [[Polyurethane]] covered in [[Lycra]], allowing it to bounce on water and float.&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/2484555/Ball-that-bounces-on-water-is-latest-beach-toy.html|title=Ball that bounces on water is summer craze|date=1 August 2008|accessdate=9 November 2017|website=Telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its patented design and durability gives Waboba its quality. To bounce the ball on the water, one must throw like skipping a rock. The ball bounces high on the water in between players when thrown at the right angle (overhand) with the right force.[1] The ball does not bounce on land.&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;

In 2005, the Waboba Ball in widespread advertising made the false claim to be the first ball to bounce on water, a claim easily debunked by history and by simply throwing a tennis ball the same way and seeing that they easily bounce on water, and introduced it to the market where it later evolved into the Waboba Extreme.

However the Waboba does bounce very well on water and can do so multiple times but bouncing on water is not unique to the branded ball.

To date, there are now 6 different types of Waboba balls  (Pro, Extreme, Surf, Blast, Big Kahuna, and Fetch) as well as several land items and accessories.

==Geographical spread==
The Waboba Ball was first introduced in Sweden in 2005 where it sold for two years before it was introduced to new markets in Europe, United States and Australia in the summer of 2007. In summer 2008, Waboba entered markets in Canada, South Africa, and the United Kingdom. During the fall of 2008 and spring 2009, Waboba was introduced in Brazil, China, Singapore, Kuwait, Dubai, Germany, Portugal, Scandinavia, France, Spain, and Cyprus. By 2013, Waboba is present in all European countries and continents except Antarctica &lt;ref name="company"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://waboba.com/|title=Waboba|first=|last=Waboba|website=Waboba|accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The game==
[[Image:Waboba Play 25 - Small.jpg|thumb|frame|right|Two people playing Waboba]]

===Official match game===
The object of the 4v4 game is to bounce the Waboba Pro on the water in order to pass to team members and score points by bouncing the ball into a goal.

Described as a cross between ultimate frisbee and water polo, the official match game is a team water sport played with the Pro ball that bounces on water. Teams consist of 3 field players, a goalkeeper and 2 substitutes. The winner of the game is the team that scores the most goals. The object of the game is to pass the ball with at least one bounce on water between team members in order to score goals. No direct passes allowed. There are no offside rules so teams have the ability to spread players across the game field, facilitating long, uninterrupted passes.&lt;ref name="waboba.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://waboba.com/howtoplay |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808151733/http://waboba.com/howtoplay/ |archivedate=2014-08-08 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

===Ultimate Waboba===
Use any Waboba ball. Each team, a minimum of 2 players per team, passes the Waboba to each other to complete a round. A team gets 1 point when each team member has caught the ball without interruption from the opposing team. A pass must bounce on the water before being caught. First team to 3 points wins. Passes have to be made within 5 seconds after receiving the ball. No holding players allowed.&lt;ref name="waboba.com"/&gt;

==Physics==
An elastic ball that bounces on water, the Waboba water balls flatten like a pancake when they hits the water surface, increasing its lift and propelling it upward. When it hits the water at a shallow angle, it too creates a bowl-shaped depression. But because it is soft, the ball flattens into a disc-shape when it hits the surface and this allows it to aquaplane efficiently across the surface. And the angle of the bowl-shaped depression causes it to launch into the air where the ball regains its shape, making it look as if it has bounced. The process is remarkably similar to the way stones skip across water, even though they are denser than the liquid. A shallow impact with the water surface creates a bowl-shaped depression that launches the stone into the air as it leaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/view/425827/like-stones-why-some-balls-bounce-on-water/|title=Like Stones, Why Some Balls Bounce On Water|website=Technologyreview.com|accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Naval use==
Researchers with the U.S. Navy’s University Laboratory Initiative have been studying the mechanics and elasticity of the Waboba balls. The military branch is interested in how elasticity affects motion in water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/43917-toy-physics-waboba-ball.html|title=US Navy Toys With Physics of Bouncy Balls|website=Livescience.com|accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wagon Works Ground''' is a [[cricket]] ground in [[Gloucester]], [[Gloucestershire]].  The ground was owned by the [[Gloucester Railway Carriage and Wagon Company]]. 

==History==
The first recorded match on the ground was in 1923, when [[Gloucestershire County Cricket Club|Gloucestershire]] played [[Lancashire County Cricket Club|Lancashire]] in the grounds first [[first-class cricket|first-class]] match.   Gloucestershire played first-class matches at the ground from 1923 to 1992, playing a total of 155 first-class matches there, the last of which saw them play [[Somerset County Cricket Club|Somerset]] in the 1992 [[County Championship]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/493_f.html First-Class Matches played on Wagon Works Ground]&lt;/ref&gt;  One innings of note came in 1936, when [[Wally Hammond]] made 317 of Gloucestershire's 485 against [[Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club|Nottinghamshire]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cricinfo.com/england/content/ground/57002.html#Profile Ground profile]&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as hosting first-class cricket the ground has also hosted [[List-A cricket|List-A]] matches.  The first List-A match held there came in the 1969 [[Player's County League]] when Gloucestershire played [[Yorkshire County Cricket Club|Yorkshire]].  From 1969 to 1992, Gloucestershire played 27 List-A matches there, the last of which saw them play Somerset in the 1992 [[Sunday League (cricket)|Sunday League]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/493_a.html List-A Matches played on Wagon Works Ground]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ground has also played host to 6 matches involving the [[Gloucestershire County Cricket Club|Gloucestershire Second XI]] in the [[Second XI Championship]] and Second XI Trophy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/493_sec.html Second XI Championship Matches played on Wagon Works Ground]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/493_set.html Second XI Trophy Matches played on Wagon Works Ground]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ground is still used for cricket today as well as [[association football|football]].  Following the rejection of Gloucestershire's plans to redevelop the [[County Ground, Bristol|County Ground]] in [[Bristol]], Gloucester City Council contacted Gloucestershire over a potential move back to the ground, which would see it redeveloped and become Gloucestershire's permanent home ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/county-cricket-2012/content/story/549003.html|title=Gloucestershire's future in doubt|date=11 January 2012|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=15 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.stroudnewsandjournal.co.uk/sport/9484536.Light_supports_move_to_Wagon_Works/|title=Light supports move to Wagon Works|date=20 January 2012|work=[[Stroud News &amp; Journal]]|publisher=www.stroudnewsandjournal.co.uk|accessdate=15 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
