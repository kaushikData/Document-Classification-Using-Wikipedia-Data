All [[first-class cricket|first-class]] cricket was cancelled in the '''1940 to 1944 English [[cricket]] seasons''' because of the [[Second World War]]; no first-class matches were played in England after Friday, 1 September 1939 until Saturday, 19 May 1945.

Ten matches were cancelled at the end of the [[1939 English cricket season]] due to the [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|German invasion of Poland on 1 September]] and the British government’s [[declaration of war]] against Germany on Sunday 3 September.

Although eleven first-class matches were arranged during [[1945 English cricket season|the 1945 season]] following the final defeat of Germany in early May, it was not until [[1946 English cricket season|the 1946 season]] that normal fixtures, including the [[County Championship]] and [[Minor Counties Championship]], could resume. In contrast with much of the [[First World War]], it was realised in the 1940s that cricket had its part to play in terms of raising both public morale and funds for charity. Efforts were made to stage matches whenever opportunity arose, especially if a suitable number of top players could be assembled. From the summer of 1941 onwards, teams such as the British Empire Eleven toured the country raising money for war charities.

At league cricket level, playing one-day matches, many competitions continued throughout the war: e.g., the [[Birmingham and District Premier League|Birmingham League]], the [[Bradford Cricket League|Bradford League]] and the [[Lancashire League (cricket)|Lancashire League]].&lt;ref&gt;Birley, Derek; ''A Social History of English Cricket'', pp. 267–268 {{ISBN|1854106228}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Successful wartime players included [[Laurie Fishlock]], [[Eric Hollies]] and [[Eddie Paynter]].&lt;ref&gt;Andrews, Gordon; ''The Datasport Book of Wartime Cricket 1940–45'', pp. 57, 157, 160. {{ISBN|1872862004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1940==
In the 1940 ''[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack|Wisden]]'', the cricket author [[Harry Altham|H S Altham]], now an Army Major, described his “sobering experience” when he visited [[Lord's Cricket Ground|Lord’s]] the previous December.  He said:

:''...there were sandbags everywhere, and the Long Room was stripped and bare, with its treasures safely stored beneath ground, but ... one felt that somehow it would take more than totalitarian war to put an end to cricket''.

Altham reflected the popular (and official) view that ''the game can and should be kept going whenever possible''.

One venue where it would not be possible was [[The Oval]], which was commandeered in 1939 and quickly turned into a [[prisoner-of-war camp|prisoner of war camp]], except that no prisoners were ever interned there. The playing area became a maze of concrete posts and wire fences.

Lord’s was also due for requisition but it was spared and [[Marylebone Cricket Club|MCC]] was able to stage many public schools and representative games throughout the war. A highlight in 1940 was the one-day game in which [[Plum Warner|Sir PF Warner]]’s XI, including [[Len Hutton]] and [[Denis Compton]] (who top-scored with 73), beat a West Indies XI which included [[Learie Constantine]] and [[Leslie Compton]] (an honorary West Indian for the day).

Of the more regular wartime teams, the most famous were the British Empire XI and the [[London Counties cricket team|London Counties XI]] which were established in 1940. Both played one-day charity matches, mostly in the south-east and often at Lord’s. The British Empire XI was founded by [[Pelham Warner]] but featured mainly English county players. The politician [[Desmond Donnelly]], then in the [[Royal Air Force]], began the London Counties XI. In one match between the two, [[Frank Woolley]] came out of retirement and played against the new star batsman [[Denis Compton]].&lt;ref&gt;Birley; ''A Social History of English Cricket'' p. 263.&lt;/ref&gt; The British Empire XI played between 34 and 45 matches per season from 1940 to 1944; the London Counties XI was credited with 191 matches from 1940 to 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews; ''The Datasport Book of Wartime Cricket'', pp. 145–146&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the teams were successful in raising money for charity, their main purpose was to help sustain morale. Many of the services and civil defence organisations had their own teams, some of them national and featuring first-class players.&lt;ref name="Birley1"&gt;Birley; ''A Social History of English Cricket'' p. 264.&lt;/ref&gt;

County clubs encouraged their players to join the services but at the same time pleaded with their members to continue subscriptions “as an investment for the future”.&lt;ref name="Birley1"/&gt; While some counties (notably [[Somerset County Cricket Club|Somerset]] and [[Hampshire County Cricket Club|Hampshire]]) closed for the duration, others did arrange matches. Nottinghamshire played six matches at [[Trent Bridge]] in 1940 and Lancashire mooted a scheme for a regionalised county competition to include the minor counties, but it was not taken further.&lt;ref name="Birley1"/&gt;

==1941==
From 1941 to 1945 the [[University Match (cricket)|University Match]] was played annually at [[Lord's]] as a one-day, and hence not [[first-class cricket|first-class]], game. Because [[Fenner's]] had not been commandeered, Cambridge had played nine matches during the 1941 season against [[Sussex County Cricket Club|Sussex]] and strong military and hospital teams and won four against a single defeat,&lt;ref name="Whitaker1"&gt;Whitaker, Haddon (editor); ''[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack]]'', Seventy-Eighth Edition (1942), pp. 227-228&lt;/ref&gt; whereas Oxford had played no cricket whatsoever due to [[University Parks|The Parks]] being commandeered.&lt;ref&gt;Whitaker (editor); ''Wisden'' (1942), p. 235&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, Cambridge were expected to and did win the match and were to win easily all but one of the subsequent one-day University Matches. Cambridge’s most famous player was [[John Bridger]], who played after the war for Hampshire with considerable success.&lt;ref name="Whitaker1"/&gt;

In public school cricket, a future champion in [[Trevor Bailey]] demonstrated his latterly-famous defensive skill for [[Dulwich College]] by scoring 851 runs in fifteen innings – in only seven of which was he dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;Whitaker (editor), ''Wisden'' (1942), p. 299&lt;/ref&gt; Dulwich also had the best school bowler in [[Horace Kiddle]], who took fifty wickets for 7.86 runs each but was killed in action in 1944 before World War II ended,&lt;ref&gt;CricketArchive; [https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/280/280772/280772.html Horace Kiddle]&lt;/ref&gt; whilst future [[Worcestershire County Cricket Club|Worcestershire]] bowler [[George Chesterton]] of Malvern took 45 wickets for 12.88 runs each, but could not make the ''Wisden'' editors best school eleven.&lt;ref&gt;Whitaker (editor); ''Wisden'' (1942), p. 239&lt;/ref&gt; Edward Spooner, a son of famous Marlborough and Lancashire batsman [[Reggie Spooner|Reggie]], averaged 49.50 for [[Eton College|Eton]]&lt;ref&gt;Whitaker (editor); ''Wisden'' (1942), p. 301&lt;/ref&gt; and was tipped for a big future, but was never to play first-class cricket at all.

The British Empire XI was dominated by West Indian leg-spinner [[Bertie Clarke]] – exempt from military service because of his profession as a doctor – whose leg-breaks and googlies took 98 wickets for 11.40 runs apiece and was to better this record in 1942.&lt;ref&gt;Whitaker(editor); ''Wisden'' (1942), p. 142&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the main players for the London Counties XI were veterans, with [[Alf Gover]] their most successful bowler with 83 wickets for 9.50.&lt;ref&gt;Whitaker(editor); ''Wisden'' (1942), p. 155&lt;/ref&gt;

==1942==
As the war grew more intense, Lord’s was still able to expand its profits, with 1942 described as “the best wartime season Lord’s has had”.&lt;ref name="Whitaker2"&gt;Whitaker, Haddon (editor); ''Wisden Cricketers' Almanack'', Seventy-Ninth Edition (1943), pp. 48-51&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jack Robertson (English cricketer)|Jack Robertson]] came to prominence with an innings of 102 for the Army against the Royal Navy&lt;ref name="Whitaker2"/&gt;

[[Eddie Paynter]] scored 970 runs at an average of 138.50 for Keighley in the Bradford League,&lt;ref&gt;Andrews; ''The Datasport Book of Wartime Cricket'', p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; whist Bailey took 52 wickets for Dulwich at 6.16 runs apiece&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/almanack/year.html?year=1943 Notes on 1942 season]&lt;/ref&gt; to follow up his high-class batting from the previous season. Essex veteran [[Jack O'Connor (English cricketer)|Jack O’Connor]] scored 208 – the only double-century in wartime cricket – in a two-day match on 4 and 5 July against Peterborough.&lt;ref&gt;Whitaker (editor); ''Wisden'' (1943), p. 178&lt;/ref&gt; whilst Clarke surpassed his 1942 record for the Empire XI. In public school cricket, the most significant discovery was [[Nigel Howard]] of [[Rossall School]],&lt;ref&gt;Whitaker (editor); ''Wisden'' (1943), pp. 265-267&lt;/ref&gt; who scored 456 runs at an average of 45 and took twenty-four cheap wickets,&lt;ref name="Whitaker3"&gt;Whitaker (editor); ''Wisden'' (1943), p. 335&lt;/ref&gt; whilst future Derbyshire captain [[Donald Carr]] made his debut for [[Repton School|Repton]] as a spin bowler.&lt;ref name="Whitaker3"/&gt;

==1943==
A drawn one-day match at Lord’s between an England XI and a West Indies XI featured the young [[Alec Bedser]] and Trevor Bailey. Bedser made his mark by taking 6/27 in the West Indies first innings. In the drawn Sir PF Warner’s XI v [[Royal Australian Air Force]] match at Lord’s, [[Keith Miller]] top-scored in the RAAF’s first innings, with 45 out of 100, as well as taking 2/20. The RAAF won a two-day match against The South at Hove by ten wickets. A strong England XI beat The Dominions by 8 runs in a two-day match at Lord’s. [[Les Ames]] made 133 in the England first innings, and Denis Compton then took 6/15 in eight overs. In their second innings, The Dominions came close to snatching an unlikely victory, with [[Stewie Dempster]] making 113.

==1944==
At [[Lord's]], two one-day matches were played by an England XI against “West Indies” and “Australia”, England winning both matches. (These were not limited overs matches.) [[Jack Young (cricketer)|Jack Young]], unknown before the war&lt;ref&gt;Preston, Hubert (editor); ''Wisden Cricketers’ Almanack'', 84th edition (1947), p. 348&lt;/ref&gt; but later to win two County Championships for [[Middlesex County Cricket Club|Middlesex]], took 88 wickets for London Counties XI at 7.63 runs apiece.

The '''2010 Catalan autonomy protest''' was a [[demonstration (people)|demonstration]] in central [[Barcelona]] on 10 July 2010 against limitations of the autonomy of [[Catalonia]], and particularly against a recent decision of the [[Spanish Constitutional Court]] to annul or reinterpret several articles of the 2006 [[Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = Catalan protesters rally for greater autonomy in Spain | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/10588494.stm | publisher = BBC News | date = 10 July 2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The number of people taking part in the demonstration was estimated at between 1.1&amp;nbsp;million (according to the local police) and 1.5&amp;nbsp;million (according to the organisers),&lt;ref name="EPDC"&gt;{{citation | title = La manifestació ha desbordat totes les previsions | url = http://www.elperiodico.cat/ca/noticias/politica/20100710/1100000-persones-assisteixen-marxa-protesta-per-sentencia/379832.shtml | newspaper = El Periódico de Catalunya | date = 10 July 2010}}. {{ca icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LV"&gt;{{ citation | title =Un millón de personas inundan Barcelona en una histórica manifestación de rechazo a la sentencia contra el Estatut | url = http://www.lavanguardia.es/politica/noticias/20100710/53961206706/un-millon-de-personas-inundan-barcelona-en-una-historica-manifestacion--de-rechazo-a-la-sentencia-co.html | newspaper = La Vanguardia | date = 10 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Madrid]]-based newspaper [[El País]] estimated the number of demonstrators at 425,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/Calculo/asistentes/elpepiesp/20100711elpepinac_21/Tes Cálculo de asistentes] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mobilisation was described as "unprecedented" by the mayor of [[Barcelona]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = Hereu: "No hi ha precedent d'una mobilització així" | url = http://www.elperiodico.cat/ca/noticias/politica/20100710/hereu-precedent-duna-mobilitzacio-aixi/379984.shtml | newspaper = El Periódico de Catalunya | date = 10 July 2010}}. {{ca icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Barcelona daily newspaper ''[[El Periódico de Catalunya]]'' described it as "without a doubt one of the biggest protest marches that has ever occurred in Catalonia, possibly the biggest".&lt;ref name="EPDC"/&gt; It is thought that the [[2012 Catalan independence demonstration]] involved more people, but this protest brought the dispute to light in the world.

The demonstration was led by a banner with the slogan in [[Catalan language|Catalan]] ''Som una nació. Nosaltres decidim.'' (in [[English language|English]], "We are a nation. We decide.").

==Background==
A new Statute of Autonomy for Catalonia was a key promise by [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party|Socialist]] candidate [[José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero]] in the run-up to the [[Catalonian parliamentary election, 2003|2003 Catalan parliamentary election]] and the [[Spanish general election, 2004|2004 Spanish general elections]].&lt;ref name="LV"/&gt; The new Statute was approved by 91% of the [[Parliament of Catalonia]], by the ''[[Cortes Generales]]'' (parliament of Spain), albeit in a curtailed form, and finally by the electors of Catalonia in a [[Catalonian constitutional referendum, 2006|referendum]] on 18 June 2006 (73.24% in favour on a turnout of 48.85%).

Almost immediately, the opposition [[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party]] launched a legal challenge to declare unconstitutional much of the new Statute.&lt;ref name="LV"/&gt; The opinion of the judges in the Constitutional Court was divided between "progressives", who felt the Statute was basically in line with [[Spanish Constitution of 1978|Spain's 1978 Constitution]], and "conservatives", who felt the Statute gave Catalonia far too much autonomy and so threatened the unity of the Spanish State. The debate went on for four years, with one judge dying in the meantime and four other judges continuing long after their terms of office had theoretically come to an end. A compromise was finally reached on 28 June 2010, and passed by six votes to four. The summary judgment published the same day revealed that the Court had declared parts of 14&lt;ref&gt;Tribunal Constitucional de España. Sentencia RI 8045-2006 http://www.tribunalconstitucional.es/en/resolucionesrecientes/Documents/SENTENCIA_RI_8045-2006.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100821175124/http://www.tribunalconstitucional.es/en/resolucionesrecientes/Documents/SENTENCIA_RI_8045-2006.pdf |date=21 August 2010 }} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; out of 277&amp;nbsp;articles unconstitutional and would submit 27 more to restrictive "interpretation". The full judgment was released on 9 July 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = Els detalls de la sentència | url = http://www.elperiodico.cat/ca/noticias/politica/20100710/els-detalls-sentencia-que-anulla-articles-del-text-catala/379440.shtml | newspaper = El Periódico de Catalunya | date = 10 July 2010}}. {{ca icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organisation of the protest==
The protest was organised by the prominent Catalan cultural organisation [[Òmnium Cultural]] with the public support of about 1,600 other organisations,&lt;ref name="EPDC"/&gt; including four out of the six political parties represented in the [[Parliament of Catalonia]] (representing more than 85% of votes at the [[Catalonian parliamentary election, 2006|last parliamentary election]]), the two main [[trade union]]s ([[CCOO]] and [[Unión General de Trabajadores]] (UGT)), the main employers' federation ([[Cipec]]), and [[F.C. Barcelona]].&lt;ref name="LV"/&gt;

The march had been planned to start at 18:00&amp;nbsp;[[Central European Summer Time|CEST]] (16:00&amp;nbsp;[[Universal Coordinated Time|UTC]]) at the junction between the [[Avinguda Diagonal]] and the [[Passeig de Gràcia]] {{coord|41.3965|2.1595|display=inline}}. It was then to have descended the Passeig de Gràcia to its junction with the [[Gran Via de les Corts Catalanes, Barcelona|Gran Via]], before turning left and finishing at the [[Plaça de Tetuan]] {{coord|41.3948|2.1755|display=inline}}, a distance of about 2&amp;nbsp;kilometres (1¼&amp;nbsp;miles).

==Events on the day==
[[File:Somunanacio15.jpg|thumb|250px|People deploy a large [[Estelada]] flag and the slogan in [[English language|English]] ''Catalonia is not Spain'' during the demonstration.]]
Well before 18:00, crowds had started to press down the Passeig de Gràcia from Diagonal, and many people were still moving up from the [[Plaça de Catalunya]] along both the Passeig de Gràcia and the parallel [[Rambla de Catalunya]]. The official "front" of the march, with its 25 by 10 metre ''[[Senyera]]'' (flag of Catalonia), eventually managed to form at the junction of the Passeig de Gràcia with [[Carrer d'Aragó]] {{coord|41.3922|2.1648|display=inline}}, and started moving at around 18:20,&lt;ref name="EPDC"/&gt; albeit moving ''through'' dense crowds. By 19:30, it had only reached the Gran Via  {{coord|41.3894|2.1683|display=inline}}, a distance of about 400&amp;nbsp;metres.&lt;ref name="LV"/&gt; The organisers decided to perform the closing act – the singing of ''[[Els Segadors]]'' (the Catalan anthem) and the reading of a short manifesto – in a packed Plaça de Tetuan despite the absence of the official "head" of the march, and the demonstration started to disperse at around 20:00.&lt;ref name="LV"/&gt;

Smaller parallel demonstrations by Catalan nationals living abroad also took place in London, Berlin, Brussels and other places.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lavanguardia.es/politica/noticias/20100710/53961777414/manifestaciones-en-berlin-londres-y-bruselas-contra-la-sentencia-del-constitucional-sobre-el-estatut.html|title=Política|publisher=|accessdate=16 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Following years==
The protest was followed in the succeeding years by the [[2012 Catalan independence demonstration]], the [[Catalan Way]] (2013), the [[Catalan Way 2014]], the [[Free Way to the Catalan Republic]] (2015) and [[Go ahead, Catalan Republic]] (2016).

The '''Anzac Day Act''' in '''New Zealand''' is a law which makes [[Anzac Day]] a national holiday in [[New Zealand]].

Anzac Day is the anniversary of the landing of the [[Australian and New Zealand Army Corps]] at [[Gallipoli]] in [[Turkey]] during [[World War I]]. This was the first major battle [[Australia]]n or New Zealand troops had been in, and losses were severe. From 1916, the day was given over to commemoration of the Anzacs who died in this battle. In 1920 the [[Reform Government of New Zealand]] passed the '''Anzac Day Act 1920''' to make the day an official public holiday. This stated that the day was in "commemoration of the part taken by New Zealand troops in [[World War I]], and in memory of those who gave their lives for the [[British Empire|Empire]]" rather than only those who died at Gallipoli. The Act stated that the day would be observed "as a public holiday", banned the holding of horse races on Anzac Day and required the closing of licensed premises on the same basis as Christmas Day and Good Friday.

The following year the Act was amended by repealing the sections on licensed premises and horse-racing, and stated that the day would be observed 'as if Anzac Day were a Sunday' rather than as a public holiday, perhaps in order to better express the quasi-religious mood of the day.

Following [[World War II]], the 1920 Act was repealed and replaced with the '''Anzac Day Act 1949'''. The day became one of commemoration of the part taken by New Zealand servicemen and women in the Second World War and the [[Boer War]] as well as World War I, and in memory of "those who gave their lives for New Zealand and the British Empire or [[Commonwealth of Nations]]". It also banned employers from transferring their employees' Anzac Day holiday or holiday pay to another day.

In 1966 the 1949 Act was repealed and replaced with the '''Anzac Day Act 1966'''. This specified that the day was in commemoration of those who "''at any time'' have given their lives for New Zealand the British Empire or Commonwealth of Nations". It also specified that when Anzac Day falls on a Sunday it will be observed on the Sunday and not moved to the Monday, and made the day a half-day rather than full-day holiday, with any activities normally permitted on a Saturday allowed after 1pm. The Act also allowed the [[Royal New Zealand Returned and Services' Association]] (a veterans' association) to establish charitable trusts. 

The 1966 Act was passed following several years of controversy over the Anzac Day holiday. Many people resented that sport and other entertainment was banned (generally by local authorities rather than central government), especially as there was a widespread perception that returned servicemen spent the day drinking. At the same time, some felt that the day had become less respected, and simply a 'day off' for most. The law was changed with the support of the RSA and followed partial liberalisation of the day by several local councils. In debates on the Act, MP Sir [[Basil Arthur]] and former Prime Minister [[Walter Nash]] suggested that New Zealanders should be ashamed that they could not set an entire day aside for remembrance. The ''[[Evening Post (New Zealand)|Evening Post]]'' newspaper, however, argued that if the day was not changed it 'was surely destined to die not many years hence'.&lt;ref&gt;Helen Robinson, 'Lest we Forget? The Fading of New Zealand War Commemorations, 1946-1966', ''New Zealand Journal of History'', 44, 1 (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the Holidays (Full Recognition of Waitangi Day and ANZAC Day) Amendment Act 2013 was passed, with the effect that if Anzac Day should fall on a Saturday or Sunday, for those employees who would not work otherwise work on that Saturday or Sunday, the public holiday must be treated as falling on the following Monday.  

The 1966 Act remains part of [[New Zealand law]].

An '''axiom''' or '''postulate''' is a statement that is taken to be [[truth|true]], to serve as a [[premise]] or starting point for further reasoning and arguments. The word comes from the Greek ''axíōma'' ({{lang|grc|{{linktext|ἀξίωμα}}}}) 'that which is thought worthy or fit' or 'that which commends itself as evident.'&lt;ref&gt;Cf. axiom, n., etymology. ''Oxford English Dictionary'', accessed 2012-04-28.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oxford American College Dictionary: "n. a statement or proposition that is regarded as being established, accepted, or self-evidently true. ORIGIN: late 15th cent.: ultimately from Greek axiōma 'what is thought fitting,' from axios 'worthy.' http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1O997-axiom.html {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term has subtle differences in definition when used in the context of different fields of study. As defined in [[classic philosophy]], an axiom is a statement that is so [[Self-evidence|evident]] or well-established, that it is accepted without controversy or question.&lt;ref&gt;"A proposition that commends itself to general acceptance; a well-established or universally conceded principle; a maxim, rule, law" axiom, n., definition 1a. ''Oxford English Dictionary'' Online, accessed 2012-04-28. Cf. Aristotle, ''[[Posterior Analytics]]'' I.2.72a18-b4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- HIDDEN UNTIL SOURCED —it is better known and more firmly believed than the conclusion.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}--&gt; As used in modern [[logic]], an axiom is a premise or starting point for reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;"A proposition (whether true or false)" axiom, n., definition 2. ''Oxford English Dictionary'' Online, accessed 2012-04-28.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
As used in [[mathematics]], the term ''axiom'' is used in two related but distinguishable senses: [[#Logical axioms|"logical axioms"]] and [[#Non-logical axioms|"non-logical axioms"]]. Logical axioms are usually statements that are taken to be true within the system of logic they define (e.g., (''A'' and ''B'') implies ''A''), often shown in symbolic form, while non-logical axioms (e.g., {{nowrap|1= ''a'' + ''b'' = ''b'' + ''a''}}) are actually substantive assertions about the elements of the domain of a specific mathematical theory (such as [[arithmetic]]). When used in the latter sense, "axiom", "postulate", and "assumption" may be used interchangeably. In general, a non-logical axiom is not a self-evident truth, but rather a formal logical expression used in deduction to build a mathematical theory.  To axiomatize a system of knowledge is to show that its claims can be derived from a small, well-understood set of sentences (the axioms). There are typically multiple ways to axiomatize a given mathematical domain.

Any axiom is a statement that serves as a starting point from which other statements are logically derived.  Whether it is meaningful (and, if so, what it means) for an axiom to be "true" is a subject of debate in the [[philosophy of mathematics]].&lt;ref&gt;See for example {{cite journal|first=Penelope|last=Maddy|journal=Journal of Symbolic Logic|title=Believing the Axioms, I|volume=53|issue=2|date=Jun 1988|pages=481–511|doi=10.2307/2274520}} for a [[mathematical realism|realist]] view.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word ''axiom'' comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word {{lang|grc|ἀξίωμα}} (''axíōma''), a [[verbal noun]] from the verb {{lang|grc|ἀξιόειν}} (''axioein''), meaning "to deem worthy", but also "to require", which in turn comes from {{lang|grc|ἄξιος}} (''áxios''), meaning "being in balance", and hence "having (the same) value (as)", "worthy", "proper". Among the [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[philosopher]]s an axiom was a claim which could be seen to be true without any need for proof.

The root meaning of the word ''postulate'' is to "demand"; for instance, [[Euclid]] demands that one agree that some things can be done, e.g. any two points can be joined by a straight line, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Wolff, P. ''Breakthroughs in Mathematics'', 1963, New York: New American Library, pp&amp;nbsp;47–48&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancient geometers maintained some distinction between axioms and postulates. While commenting on Euclid's books, [[Proclus]] remarks that, "[[Geminus]] held that this [4th] Postulate should not be classed as a postulate but as an axiom, since it does not, like the first three Postulates, assert the possibility of some construction but expresses an essential property."&lt;ref&gt;[[T. L. Heath|Heath, T.]] 1956. The Thirteen Books of Euclid's Elements. New York: Dover. ''p 200''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Boethius]] translated 'postulate' as ''petitio'' and called the axioms  ''notiones communes'' but in later manuscripts this usage was not always strictly kept.

==Historical development==

===Early Greeks===
The logico-deductive method whereby conclusions (new knowledge) follow from premises (old knowledge) through the application of sound arguments ([[syllogisms]], rules of inference), was developed by the ancient Greeks, and has become the core principle of modern mathematics. [[tautology (logic)|Tautologies]] excluded, nothing can be deduced if nothing is assumed. Axioms and postulates are the basic assumptions underlying a given body of deductive knowledge. They are accepted without demonstration. All other assertions ([[theorem]]s, if we are talking about mathematics) must be proven with the aid of these basic assumptions. However, the interpretation of mathematical knowledge has changed from ancient times to the modern, and consequently the terms ''axiom'' and ''postulate'' hold a slightly different meaning for the present day mathematician, than they did for [[Aristotle]] and [[Euclid]].

The ancient Greeks considered [[geometry]] as just one of several [[science]]s, and held the theorems of geometry on par with scientific facts. As such, they developed and used the logico-deductive method as a means of avoiding error, and for structuring and communicating knowledge. Aristotle's [[posterior analytics]] is a definitive exposition of the classical view.

An "axiom", in classical terminology, referred to a self-evident assumption common to many branches of science. A good example would be the assertion that &lt;blockquote&gt;''When an equal amount is taken from equals, an equal amount results.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At the foundation of the various sciences lay certain additional hypotheses which were accepted without proof. Such a hypothesis was termed a ''postulate''. While the axioms were common to many sciences, the postulates of each particular science were different. Their validity had to be established by means of real-world experience. Indeed, Aristotle warns that the content of a science cannot be successfully communicated, if the learner is in doubt about the truth of the postulates.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, Metaphysics Bk IV, Chapter 3, 1005b "Physics also is a kind of Wisdom, but it is not the first kind. – And the attempts of some of those who discuss the terms on which truth should be accepted, are due to want of training in logic; for they should know these things already when they come to a special study, and not be inquiring into them while they are listening to lectures on it." W.D. Ross translation, in The Basic Works of Aristotle, ed. Richard McKeon, (Random House, New York, 1941)|date=June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The classical approach is well-illustrated by [[Euclid's Elements]], where a list of postulates is given (common-sensical geometric facts drawn from our experience), followed by a list of "common notions" (very basic, self-evident assertions).

:;Postulates
:# It is possible to draw a [[straight line]] from any point to any other point.
:# It is possible to extend a line segment continuously in both directions.
:# It is possible to describe a [[circle]] with any center and any radius.
:# It is true that all [[right angle]]s are equal to one another.
:# ("[[Parallel postulate]]") It is true that, if a straight line falling on two straight lines make the [[polygon|interior angles]] on the same side less than two right angles, the two straight lines, if produced indefinitely, [[Line-line intersection|intersect]] on that side on which are the [[angle]]s less than the two right angles.

:;Common notions:
:# Things which are equal to the same thing are also equal to one another.
:# If equals are added to equals, the wholes are equal.
:# If equals are subtracted from equals, the remainders are equal.
:# Things which coincide with one another are equal to one another.
:# The whole is greater than the part.

===Modern development===
A lesson learned by mathematics in the last 150 years is that it is useful to strip the meaning away from the mathematical assertions (axioms, postulates, [[propositional logic|propositions]], theorems) and definitions. One must concede the need for [[primitive notion]]s, or undefined terms or concepts, in any study. Such abstraction or formalization makes mathematical knowledge more general, capable of multiple different meanings, and therefore useful in multiple contexts. [[Alessandro Padoa]], [[Mario Pieri]], and [[Giuseppe Peano]] were pioneers in this movement.

Structuralist mathematics goes further, and develops theories and axioms (e.g. [[Field theory (mathematics)|field theory]], [[group (mathematics)|group theory]], [[topological space|topology]], [[linear space|vector spaces]]) without ''any'' particular application in mind. The distinction between an "axiom" and a "postulate" disappears. The postulates of Euclid are profitably motivated by saying that they lead to a great wealth of geometric facts. The truth of these complicated facts rests on the acceptance of the basic hypotheses. However, by throwing out Euclid's fifth postulate we get theories that have meaning in wider contexts, [[hyperbolic geometry]] for example. We must simply be prepared to use labels like "line" and "parallel" with greater flexibility. The development of hyperbolic geometry taught mathematicians that postulates should be regarded as purely formal statements, and not as facts based on experience.

When mathematicians employ the [[Field (mathematics)|field]] axioms, the intentions are even more abstract. The propositions of field theory do not concern any one particular application; the mathematician now works in complete abstraction. There are many examples of fields; field theory gives correct knowledge about them all.

It is not correct to say that the axioms of field theory are "propositions that are regarded as true without proof." Rather, the field axioms are a set of constraints. If any given system of addition and multiplication satisfies these constraints, then one is in a position to instantly know a great deal of extra information about this system.

Modern mathematics formalizes its foundations to such an extent that mathematical theories can be regarded as mathematical objects, and mathematics itself can be regarded as a branch of [[logic]]. [[Gottlob Frege|Frege]], [[Bertrand Russell|Russell]], [[Henri Poincaré|Poincaré]], [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]], and [[Kurt Gödel|Gödel]] are some of the key figures in this development.

In the modern understanding, a set of axioms is any [[Class (set theory)|collection]] of formally stated assertions from which other formally stated assertions follow by the application of certain well-defined rules. In this view, logic becomes just another formal system. A set of axioms should be [[consistent]]; it should be impossible to derive a contradiction from the axiom. A set of axioms should also be non-redundant; an assertion that can be deduced from other axioms need not be regarded as an axiom.

It was the early hope of modern logicians that various branches of mathematics, perhaps all of mathematics, could be derived from a consistent collection of basic axioms. An early success of the formalist program was Hilbert's formalization of [[Euclidean geometry]], and the related demonstration of the consistency of those axioms.

In a wider context, there was an attempt to base all of mathematics on [[Georg Cantor|Cantor's]] [[set theory]]. Here the emergence of [[Russell's paradox]], and similar antinomies of [[naïve set theory]] raised the possibility that any such system could turn out to be inconsistent.

The formalist project suffered a decisive setback, when in 1931 Gödel showed that it is possible, for any sufficiently large set of axioms ([[peano arithmetic|Peano's axioms]], for example) to construct a statement whose truth is independent of that set of axioms. As a [[corollary]], Gödel proved that the consistency of a theory like [[Peano arithmetic]] is an unprovable assertion within the scope of that theory.

It is reasonable to believe in the consistency of Peano arithmetic because it is satisfied by the system of [[natural number]]s, an [[Infinite set|infinite]] but intuitively accessible formal system. However, at present, there is no known way of demonstrating the consistency of the modern [[Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms]] for set theory. Furthermore, using techniques of [[forcing (mathematics)|forcing]] ([[Paul Cohen|Cohen]]) one can show that the [[continuum hypothesis]] (Cantor) is independent of the Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms. Thus, even this very general set of axioms cannot be regarded as the definitive foundation for mathematics.

===Other sciences===
Axioms play a key role not only in mathematics, but also in other sciences, notably in [[theoretical physics]]. In particular, the monumental work of [[Isaac Newton]] is essentially based on [[Euclid]]'s axioms, augmented by a postulate on the non-relation of [[spacetime]] and the physics taking place in it at any moment.

In 1905, Newton's axioms were replaced by those of [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[special relativity]], and later on by those of [[general relativity]].

Another paper of Albert Einstein and coworkers (see [[EPR paradox]]), almost immediately contradicted by [[Niels Bohr]], concerned the interpretation of [[quantum mechanics]]. This was in 1935. According to Bohr, this new theory should be [[Probability theory|probabilistic]], whereas according to Einstein it should be [[deterministic]]. Notably, the underlying quantum mechanical theory, i.e. the set of "theorems" derived by it, seemed to be identical.  Einstein even assumed that it would be sufficient to add to quantum mechanics  "hidden variables" to enforce determinism. However,  thirty years later, in 1964, [[John Stewart Bell|John Bell]] found a theorem, involving complicated optical correlations (see [[Bell inequalities]]), which yielded measurably different results using Einstein's axioms compared to using Bohr's axioms. And it took roughly another twenty years until an experiment of [[Alain Aspect]] got results in favour of Bohr's axioms, not Einstein's. (Bohr's axioms are simply: The theory should be probabilistic in the sense of the [[Copenhagen interpretation]].)

As a consequence, it is not necessary to explicitly cite Einstein's axioms, the more so since they concern subtle points on the "reality" and "locality" of experiments.

Regardless, the role of axioms in mathematics and in the above-mentioned sciences is different. In mathematics one neither "proves" nor "disproves" an axiom for a set of theorems; the point is simply that in the conceptual realm identified by the axioms, the theorems logically follow. In contrast, in physics a comparison with experiments always makes sense, since a [[Falsifiability|falsified]] physical theory needs modification.

==Mathematical logic==
In the field of [[mathematical logic]], a clear distinction is made between two notions of axioms: ''logical'' and ''non-logical'' (somewhat similar to the ancient distinction between "axioms" and "postulates" respectively).

===Logical axioms===
These are certain [[Formula (mathematical logic)|formulas]] in a [[formal language]] that are [[tautology (logic)|universally valid]], that is, formulas that are [[satisfiability|satisfied]] by every [[Assignment (mathematical logic)|assignment]] of values.  Usually one takes as logical axioms ''at least'' some minimal set of tautologies that is sufficient for proving all [[tautology (logic)|tautologies]] in the language; in the case of [[predicate logic]] more logical axioms than that are required, in order to prove [[logical truth]]s that are not tautologies in the strict sense.

====Examples====

=====Propositional logic=====
In [[propositional logic]] it is common to take as logical axioms all formulae of the following forms, where &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\chi&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; can be any formulae of the language and where the included [[Logical connective|primitive connectives]] are only "&lt;math&gt;\neg&lt;/math&gt;" for [[negation]] of the immediately following proposition and "&lt;math&gt;\to&lt;/math&gt;" for [[Entailment|implication]] from antecedent to consequent propositions:

#&lt;math&gt;\phi \to (\psi \to \phi)&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;(\phi \to (\psi \to \chi)) \to ((\phi \to \psi) \to (\phi \to \chi))&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;(\lnot \phi \to \lnot \psi) \to (\psi \to \phi).&lt;/math&gt;

Each of these patterns is an ''[[axiom schema]]'', a rule for generating an infinite number of axioms.  For example, if &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; are [[propositional variable]]s, then &lt;math&gt;A \to (B \to A)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(A \to \lnot B) \to (C \to (A \to \lnot B))&lt;/math&gt; are both instances of axiom schema 1, and hence are axioms.  It can be shown that with only these three axiom schemata and ''[[modus ponens]]'', one can prove all tautologies of the propositional calculus.  It can also be shown that no pair of these schemata is sufficient for proving all tautologies with ''modus ponens''.

Other axiom schemas involving the same or different sets of primitive connectives can be alternatively constructed.&lt;ref&gt;Mendelson, "6. Other Axiomatizations" of Ch. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

These axiom schemata are also used in the [[predicate calculus]], but additional logical axioms are needed to include a quantifier in the calculus.&lt;ref&gt;Mendelson, "3. First-Order Theories" of Ch. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

=====First-order logic=====
&lt;div style="border: 1px solid #CCCCCC; padding-left: 5px; "&gt;
'''Axiom of Equality.''' Let &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{L}&lt;/math&gt; be a [[first-order language]]. For each variable &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, the formula

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;x = x&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

is universally valid.
&lt;/div&gt;

This means that, for any [[Free variables and bound variables|variable symbol]] &lt;math&gt;x\,,&lt;/math&gt; the formula &lt;math&gt;x = x&lt;/math&gt; can be regarded as an axiom. Also, in this example, for this not to fall into vagueness and a never-ending series of "primitive notions", either a precise notion of what we mean by &lt;math&gt;x = x&lt;/math&gt;  (or, for that matter, "to be equal") has to be well established first, or a purely formal and syntactical usage of the symbol &lt;math&gt;=&lt;/math&gt;  has to be enforced, only regarding it as a string and only a string of symbols, and mathematical logic does indeed do that.

Another, more interesting example [[axiom scheme]], is that which provides us with what is known as '''Universal Instantiation''':

&lt;div style="border: 1px solid #CCCCCC; padding-left: 5px; "&gt;
'''Axiom scheme for Universal Instantiation.''' Given a formula &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; in a first-order language &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{L}&lt;/math&gt;, a variable &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and a [[First order logic#Terms|term]] &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; that is [[First-order logic#Rules of inference|substitutable]] for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;, the formula

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\forall x \, \phi \to \phi^x_t&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

is universally valid.
&lt;/div&gt;

Where the symbol &lt;math&gt;\phi^x_t&lt;/math&gt; stands for the formula &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; with the term &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; substituted for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. (See [[Substitution of variables]].) In informal terms, this example allows us to state that, if we know that a certain property &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; holds for every &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and that &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; stands for a particular object in our structure, then we should be able to claim &lt;math&gt;P(t)&lt;/math&gt;. Again, ''we are claiming that the formula'' &lt;math&gt;\forall x \phi \to \phi^x_t&lt;/math&gt; ''is valid'', that is, we must be able to give a "proof" of this fact, or more properly speaking, a ''metaproof''. Actually, these examples are ''metatheorems'' of our theory of mathematical logic since we are dealing with the very concept of ''proof'' itself. Aside from this, we can also have '''Existential Generalization''':

&lt;div style="border: 1px solid #CCCCCC; padding-left: 5px; "&gt;
'''Axiom scheme for Existential Generalization.''' Given a formula &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; in a first-order language &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{L}&lt;/math&gt;, a variable &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and a term &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; that is substitutable for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;, the formula

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\phi^x_t \to \exists x \, \phi&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

is universally valid.
&lt;/div&gt;

===Non-logical axioms===
'''Non-logical axioms''' are formulas that play the role of theory-specific assumptions.  Reasoning about two different structures, for example the [[natural number]]s and the [[integer]]s, may involve the same logical axioms; the non-logical axioms aim to capture what is special about a particular structure (or set of structures, such as [[group (algebra)|groups]]).  Thus non-logical axioms, unlike logical axioms, are not ''[[Tautology (logic)|tautologies]]''.  Another name for a non-logical axiom is ''postulate''.&lt;ref&gt;Mendelson, "3. First-Order Theories: Proper Axioms" of Ch. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost every modern [[mathematical theory]] starts from a given set of non-logical axioms, and it was thought{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} that in principle every theory could be axiomatized in this way and formalized down to the bare language of logical formulas.&lt;!-- This turned out to be impossible{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} and proved to be quite a story (''[[#role|see below]]''); however recently this approach has been resurrected in the form of [[neo-logicism]].--&gt;

Non-logical axioms are often simply referred to as ''axioms'' in mathematical [[discourse]].  This does not mean that it is claimed that they are true in some absolute sense.  For example, in some groups, the group operation is [[commutative]], and this can be asserted with the introduction of an additional axiom, but without this axiom we can do quite well developing (the more general) group theory, and we can even take its negation as an axiom for the study of non-commutative groups.

Thus, an ''axiom'' is an elementary basis for a [[Formal system#Logical system|formal logic system]] that together with the [[rules of inference]] define a '''[[deductive system]]'''.

====Examples====
This section gives examples of mathematical theories that are developed entirely from a set of non-logical axioms (axioms, henceforth). A rigorous treatment of any of these topics begins with a specification of these axioms.

Basic theories, such as [[arithmetic]], [[real analysis]] and [[complex analysis]] are often introduced non-axiomatically, but implicitly or explicitly there is generally an assumption that the axioms being used are the axioms of [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] with choice, abbreviated ZFC, or some very similar system of [[axiomatic set theory]] like [[Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory]], a [[conservative extension]] of ZFC. Sometimes slightly stronger theories such as [[Morse–Kelley set theory]] or set theory with a [[strongly inaccessible cardinal]] allowing the use of a [[Grothendieck universe]] are used, but in fact most mathematicians can actually prove all they need in systems weaker than ZFC, such as [[second-order arithmetic]].{{citation needed|reason=This claim should include a citation |date=April 2016}}

The study of topology in mathematics extends all over through [[point set topology]], [[algebraic topology]], [[differential topology]], and all the related paraphernalia, such as [[homology theory]], [[homotopy theory]]. The development of ''abstract algebra'' brought with itself [[group theory]], [[ring (mathematics)|rings]], [[field (mathematics)|fields]], and [[Galois theory]].

This list could be expanded to include most fields of mathematics, including [[measure theory]], [[ergodic theory]], [[probability]], [[representation theory]], and [[differential geometry]].

=====Arithmetic=====
The [[Peano axioms]] are the most widely used ''axiomatization'' of [[first-order arithmetic]].  They are a set of axioms strong enough to prove many important facts about [[number theory]] and they allowed Gödel to establish his famous [[Gödel's second incompleteness theorem|second incompleteness theorem]].&lt;ref&gt;Mendelson, "5. The Fixed Point Theorem. Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem" of Ch. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

We have a language &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{L}_{NT} = \{0, S\}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; is a constant symbol and &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is a [[unary function]] and the following axioms:

# &lt;math&gt;\forall x. \lnot (Sx = 0) &lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\forall x. \forall y. (Sx = Sy \to x = y) &lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;(\phi(0) \land \forall x.\,(\phi(x) \to \phi(Sx))) \to \forall x.\phi(x)&lt;/math&gt; for any &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{L}_{NT}&lt;/math&gt; formula &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; with one free variable.

The standard structure is &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{N} = \langle\N, 0, S\rangle&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\N&lt;/math&gt; is the set of natural numbers, &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is the [[successor function]] and &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; is naturally interpreted as the number 0.

=====Euclidean geometry=====
Probably the oldest, and most famous, list of axioms are the 4 + 1 [[Euclid's postulates]] of [[Euclidean geometry|plane geometry]].  The axioms are referred to as "4 + 1" because for nearly two millennia the [[parallel postulate|fifth (parallel) postulate]] ("through a point outside a line there is exactly one parallel") was suspected of being derivable from the first four.  Ultimately, the fifth postulate was found to be independent of the first four.  Indeed, one can assume that exactly one parallel through a point outside a line exists, or that infinitely many exist.  This choice gives us two alternative forms of geometry in which the interior [[angle]]s of a [[triangle]] add up to exactly 180 degrees or less, respectively, and are known as Euclidean and [[hyperbolic geometry|hyperbolic]] geometries. If one also removes the second postulate ("a line can be extended indefinitely") then [[elliptic geometry]] arises, where there is no parallel through a point outside a line, and in which the interior angles of a triangle add up to more than 180 degrees.

=====Real analysis=====
The objectives of study are within the domain of [[real numbers]].  The real numbers are uniquely picked out (up to [[isomorphism]]) by the properties of a ''Dedekind complete ordered field'', meaning that any nonempty set of real numbers with an upper bound has a least upper bound. However, expressing these properties as axioms requires use of [[second-order logic]]. The [[Löwenheim–Skolem theorem]]s tell us that if we restrict ourselves to [[first-order logic]], any axiom system for the reals admits other models, including both models that are smaller than the reals and models that are larger.  Some of the latter are studied in [[non-standard analysis]].

===&lt;span id="role"&gt;Role in mathematical logic&lt;/span&gt;===

====Deductive systems and completeness====
A '''[[deductive]] system''' consists of a set &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; of logical axioms, a set &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; of non-logical axioms, and a set &lt;math&gt;\{(\Gamma, \phi)\}&lt;/math&gt; of ''rules of inference''.  A desirable property of a deductive system is that it be '''complete'''.  A system is said to be complete if, for all formulas &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\text{if }\Sigma \models \phi\text{ then }\Sigma \vdash \phi&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

that is, for any statement that is a ''logical consequence'' of &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; there actually exists a ''deduction'' of the statement from &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;.  This is sometimes expressed as "everything that is true is provable", but it must be understood that "true" here means "made true by the set of axioms", and not, for example, "true in the intended interpretation". [[Gödel's completeness theorem]] establishes the completeness of a certain commonly used type of deductive system.

Note that "completeness" has a different meaning here than it does in the context of [[Gödel's first incompleteness theorem]], which states that no ''recursive'', ''consistent'' set of non-logical axioms &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; of the Theory of Arithmetic is ''complete'', in the sense that there will always exist an arithmetic statement &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; such that neither &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; nor &lt;math&gt;\lnot\phi&lt;/math&gt; can be proved from the given set of axioms.

There is thus, on the one hand, the notion of ''completeness of a deductive system'' and on the other hand that of ''completeness of a set of non-logical axioms''.  The completeness theorem and the incompleteness theorem, despite their names, do not contradict one another.

===Further discussion===
Early [[mathematician]]s regarded [[Foundations of geometry|axiomatic geometry]] as a model of [[physical space]], and obviously there could only be one such model. The idea that alternative mathematical systems might exist was very troubling to mathematicians of the 19th century and the developers of systems such as [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]] made elaborate efforts to derive them from traditional arithmetic. [[Évariste Galois|Galois]] showed just before his untimely death that these efforts were largely wasted. Ultimately, the abstract parallels between algebraic systems were seen to be more important than the details and [[abstract algebra|modern algebra]] was born.  In the modern view axioms may be any set of formulas, as long as they are not known to be inconsistent.

'''Búsqueda''' is a [[Uruguay]]an [[weekly newspaper]] published since 1972. 
==General information==
Established in the early 1970s when Uruguay was still dominated by [[statism]], ''Búsqueda'' sought to advocate for [[economic liberalism]]. One of its foremost journalists was [[Ramón Díaz (economist)|Ramón Díaz]].

It has national coverage and is printed on white [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] paper; only advertisements are coloured. Búsqueda used to feature only political and economic news, but culture, science, health, humour and sports sections were added later. Since 2000, a women's magazine named '''Galería''' is sold together with Búsqueda.

Opinions tend to be concentrated in [[Column (newspaper)|columns]] and [[editorial]]s, mostly with a [[classical liberal]] view. Photographs are small and never used in politics and economy sections. According to The New York Times, sociologist César Aguiar noted that "[[Citibank]] and the [[Communist Party of Uruguay|Communist Party [of Uruguay]]] both advertise in its pages".&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE5DF113BF931A3575AC0A966958260 Magazine in Uruguay Wins a Wide Audience] - The New York Times&lt;/ref&gt;

Together with ''[[Brecha (newspaper)|Brecha]]'', it is considered one of the two most influential political weekly newspapers in Uruguay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/DE/Aussenpolitik/Laender/Laenderinfos/01-Nodes_Uebersichtsseiten/Uruguay_node.html |title=Information about Uruguay |publisher=[[Auswärtiges Amt]] |accessdate=24 Nov 2012|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Charles Henry Crane''' B.A. M.A. M.D. (July 19, 1825 – October 10, 1883) was an [[United States|American]] [[physician]] and the 13th [[Surgeon General of the United States Army]] (1882–1883). He was the son of [[Ichabod Crane (Colonel)|Colonel Ichabod B. Crane]]

Crane received his B.A. from  [[Yale College]] in 1844. He then went to the [[Harvard Medical School]] where he received his  M.D. in 1847.&lt;ref name=Bowen/&gt;  Crane joined the army from Massachusetts on February 14, 1848.&lt;ref name=NewYorkTimes&gt;''New York Times'', "Surgeon General Crane Dead."&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1865, Crane was one of the doctors attending [[Abraham Lincoln|President Lincoln]] at [[Abraham Lincoln Assassination|his death]].&lt;ref name=NewYorkTimes/&gt;

On April 9, 1866, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Andrew Johnson]] nominated Crane for appointment to the grade of [[Brevet (military)|brevet]] [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] in the [[Regular Army (United States)|Regular Army]], to rank from March 13, 1865, and the [[United States Senate]] confirmed the appointment on May 4, 1866.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = | last = Eicher | first = John H. | author2 = | last2 = Eicher | first2 = David J. | authorlink2 = David J.

On July 29, 1866 Crane was confirmed by the US. Senate to be the Assistant Surgeon General of the Army under Surgeon General [[Joseph K. Barnes]].&lt;ref name=NewYorkTimes2&gt;''New York Times'', "Washington News.; Final Adjournment of Congress to December."&lt;/ref&gt;

Crane began to serve as Acting Surgeon General of the Army when his predecessor resigned.&lt;ref name=NewYorkTimes3&gt;''New York Times'', "National Capital Topics; News and Orders for the Army and Navy."&lt;/ref&gt;  Crane was subsequently nominated by President [[Chester A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12433">{{rquote|right|&lt;small&gt;[For Russia, the Danube has always been] the life-line of the Empire! It is also the symbol of her historic ''Drang nach Westen'' — an extension of the Czarist policies originating in the 18th Century.|American historian&lt;/small&gt;.&lt;ref name=Rasmussen&gt;Charlotte Rasmussen, "Freedom of the Danube," ''Current History,'' XII (January 1947)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|27–28}}}}

The '''Danube River Conference of 1948''' was held in [[Belgrade|Belgrade, Yugoslavia]],  to develop a new [[international regime]] for the development and control of the Danube in the wake of World War II. It was the first postwar conference pitting the victorious Allies of the west against [[Soviet Union|the Soviet Union]] and its allied states of Eastern Europe in which the latter held a majority and were expected to win all points of disagreement between the two sides. As such, it attracted more than the usual share of attention from East and West alike.&lt;ref name=GLG/&gt;{{rp|46–47}}

The major result of the conference was the ouster of non-Danubian powers from the international agencies that had controlled the commerce and physical care of the river for decades.&lt;ref name=GLG/&gt;{{rp|55}}

==Pre-conference maneuvering==

Postwar discussion of the [[Danube River]] was begun by the United States in 1945 when [[Harry S Truman|President Truman]] proposed at the [[Potsdam Conference]] that [[Freedom of Navigation|freedom of navigation]] should be assured on Europe's inland waterways.&lt;ref name=Campbell/&gt;{{rp|318}} Britain and France were concerned with reestablishing their prewar positions as members of the [[Commissions of the Danube River|European Commission of the Danube]].
In 1947, the [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947|Paris peace treaties]] signed with [[Romania]], [[Hungary]], and [[Bulgaria]] guaranteed free navigation.&lt;ref name=GLG/&gt;{{rp|48}}The [[foreign minister]]s of [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[France]], the [[USSR]], and the [[United States]] stipulated that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Navigation on the Danube shall be free and open for the nationals, vessels of commerce and goods of all states, on a footing of equality in regard to port and navigation charges and conditions for [[merchant shipping]]. The foregoing shall not apply to traffic between ports of the same state.&lt;ref name=Rasmussen/&gt;{{rp|27}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Big Four also decided that a conference should be held within six months after the treaties came into force "to work out a new convention regarding the regime of the Danube."&lt;ref name=Campbell/&gt;{{rp|316}} In February 1948 the United States proposed calling a conference, thus averting a multilateral pact that might have been concluded among the Eastern European countries.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times,'' November 26, 1947, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

Germany, still without a government and [[Four Power Agreement on Berlin|under four-power control]], could not be represented, but the United States championed the entry of Austria. That nation, however, was rejected by the eastern bloc on the grounds they were still at war. As a compromise, it was agreed that Austria would attend as a consultant only. The four [[Great power|major powers]], with Yugoslavia (then under the control of [[Josip Broz Tito|Marshal Tito]] and the Communist Party), issued invitations.&lt;ref name=GLG/&gt;{{rp|48–49}}

==East Versus West==

The conference caught the attention of the Eastern and Western press immediately. For months, Russia and Eastern Europe had been on the losing side of nearly every vote of importance in [[United Nations|the United Nations]] sessions at [[Lake Success, New York]]. In Belgrade, though, the West was in the minority.&lt;ref name=GLG/&gt;{{rp|49}} Soviet Foreign Minister [[Andrei Vishinsky]] told the Western delegates: "The door was open for you to come in. The door is open for you to leave, if that is what you wish."&lt;ref name=Blitz&gt;"Danubian Conference," ''Life,'' XXV (August 30, 1948)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|13}}

{{rquote|left|&lt;small&gt;[The Danube] has always been a ''political'' question. As a commercial route it has never lived up to its potentialities. Those Powers which have been concerned with opening or closing it have been more interested in their influence and control in the Danubian region than in navigation on the river itself.|Eastern European specialist&lt;br&gt;in the U.S. State Department&lt;/small&gt;.&lt;ref name=Campbell&gt;{{cite journal |first=John C. |last=Campbell |title=Diplomacy on the Danube |journal=[[Foreign Affairs]] |volume=27 |issue=2 |pages=315–327 |year=1949 |jstor=20030183 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|316}}}}

Vishinsky said that the Danubian countries (the USSR now being one of them as a result of reclaiming its old province of [[Bessarabia]]) would draw up a convention and put it into force "regardless of the minority opinion."&lt;ref name=IO&gt;"Danubian Conference," ''International Organization,'' III (February 1949)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|179}} For this purpose, the Soviet Union introduced a draft convention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/viewArticle.arc?articleId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1948-08-03-04-010&amp;pageId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1948-08-03-04 "A New Danube Convention: Russian Draft," ''The Times'' of London, August 3, 1948, page 4]&lt;/ref&gt; So  did the United States, but the conference spurned it.&lt;ref name=GLG/&gt;{{rp|49–50}}

The delegates also rejected a Western attempt to have Austria seated, if not at the conference, then in the international commission that the meeting was developing. The final draft said only that Austria would be become a member after a peace was signed. Germany was left out of the final draft altogether.&lt;ref name=GLG/&gt;{{rp|50}}

A U.S. proposal that the new commission be brought into some kind of liaison with the United Nations, through appeal to the [[International Court of Justice]] in case of dispute and in periodic reports to the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council|Economic and Social Council]], was also defeated.&lt;ref name=GLG/&gt;{{rp|50}}

America came to the table with a full delegation of experienced transportation men, maritime lawyers, and other experts who worked out a detailed draft convention.&lt;ref name=Campbell/&gt;{{rp|323}} When U.S. Delegate [[Cavendish Cannon]] explained the reasons for each article of the American draft, one State Department official observed, &lt;blockquote&gt;some of the satellite [[Eastern European]] delegates seated round the table may have recognized the weight of those arguments. Indirectly, they may reach the people of those countries. . . . Nations for which the Danube is a principal route to world markets can scarcely feel happy, in the long run, about a system which puts control of that route in the hands of a single Great Power. . . . All the western Powers could hope to do at Belgrade was to show that their plans for the Danube were conceived to benefit the Danubian nations themselves as well as non-riparian states, and to prove that the charge of [[imperialism]] in the Danube basin lay not against the West but against Russia.&lt;ref name=Campbell/&gt;{{rp|324, 326}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The United States, he said, was trying to
&lt;blockquote&gt;focus the debate on the major points of difference between the Soviet and the American drafts. . . . The United States was convinced . . . that the Soviet convention was designed not to guarantee freedom of navigation but to give a legal basis for the existing system of Soviet control over the river. To prove this point, it framed its amendments and concentrated its arguments on a few main issues.&lt;ref name=Campbell/&gt;{{rp|322}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Britain and France, however, were less idealistic. Ignoring the fact that [[Nazi rule over the Danube River#Before the war|they had agreed in 1938]] to turn the European Commission of the Danube over to the river-bordering powers (headed by [[Nazi Germany]]), they insisted that the [[Commissions of the Danube River#Reorganizing|Convention of 1921]] was still in force and that their rights could not be abolished without their consent.&lt;ref name=GLG/&gt;{{rp|51}}

To illustrate this distinction, the American magazine ''Life'' commented that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;U.S. Delegate [[Cavendish Cannon]] often talked and acted as though merely technical matters were involved and, in the words of one correspondent, showed "all the brilliance of a [[Cigar store Indian|cigar-store Indian]]." . . . Only Britain's [[Charles Peake|Sir Charles Peake]] put up a strong and vigorous fight for the Western cause.&lt;ref name=Blitz/&gt;{{rp|13}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==The decision==

The seven Danubian nations voted to adopt the Soviet draft, with a few changes proposed in the conference by Vishinsky. Britain, France, the U.S., and Austria announced their refusal to sign. The U.K. and France took no part in the final vote, on the grounds that the whole thing was illegal. The U.S. abstained in individual article votes and voted against the document as a whole. The conference closed on August 18.&lt;ref name=GLG/&gt;{{rp|53}}

The West suffered a slight financial loss in the deal, the new treaty having set up a new [[Danube Commission]] that assumed all the assets of the old international Danube conventions but not of the liabilities — which included loans that Britain, France, and Italy had made. A year later, parallel copies of a note rejecting the new convention were dispatched by the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Belgium, Italy, and Greece to the six Eastern nations, ignoring Ukraine. Six months later, in March 1950, the Soviet Union replied that it did not agree and that the new convention “eliminated previous injustices and established jurisdiction over the river by the countries through which or along which the river actually flowed.”&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times,'' March 10, 1950, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

The river system was thenceforth divided into three administrations — the regular River Commission, a bilateral Romania-USSR administration between Braila and the mouth of the Sulina channel, and a bilateral Romania-Yugoslavia administration at the [[Iron Gate (Danube)|Iron Gate]]. Both of the latter were technically under the control of the main commission, members of which were Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Ukraine, the USSR, and Yugoslavia.&lt;ref name=GLG/&gt;{{rp|55}}

"'''Domino'''" is a song written by the band [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] for their 1986 album ''[[Invisible Touch]]''. The song was the sixth track on the album. The music was written by the band, while the lyrics were written by [[Keyboard instrument|keyboardist]] [[Tony Banks (musician)|Tony Banks]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[When in Rome 2007]]'' DVD&lt;/ref&gt; The song is divided into two parts, "'''In the Glow of the Night'''" and "'''The Last Domino'''".

The song, though not released as a single, charted at number 29 on the [[Mainstream Rock Tracks|Mainstream Rock Charts]].

The [[B-side]] of the "[[Tonight, Tonight, Tonight]]" single was the first half of this song, "In the Glow of the Night", while the B-side of "[[Invisible Touch (song)|Invisible Touch]]" was the second part of the song, "The Last Domino".

During a clip titled "Tony talks about his inspiration" on the ''[[When in Rome 2007]]'' DVD, Banks states that his inspiration for the song lyrics was the [[1982 Lebanon War]] which was still being contested prior to the recording of ''[[Invisible Touch]]''. He set the action on a hotel room in [[Beirut]], minutes after bombs start to fall on the city.

==Live performances==
Before the song was performed, [[Phil Collins]] would talk to the audience about the [[Domino effect|Domino Principle]] and demonstrate it by stating that something that might happen to the people in one section, might affect the people in another section (with the lights lighting up that section of the audience) multiple times.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Way We Walk - Live in Concert]] 2001 Speech before ''Domino'' is played.&lt;/ref&gt; 

It was performed on the ''[[Invisible Touch]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.genesis-movement.org/php/listtour.php?tourid=15&amp;addcommentsall=  Invisible Tour Songs &amp; Dates]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[We Can't Dance|The Way We Walk]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.genesis-movement.org/php/listtour.php?tourid=16&amp;addcommentsall=  The Way We Walk Tour Songs &amp; Dates]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Calling All Stations]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.genesis-movement.org/php/listtour.php?tourid=17&amp;addcommentsall=  Calling All Stations Tour Songs &amp; Dates]&lt;/ref&gt; (with [[Ray Wilson (musician)|Ray Wilson]] on vocals) and ''[[Turn It On Again: The Tour|Turn It On Again]]''&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.genesis-movement.org/tioa2007europe.html European setlist]". genesis-movement.com.

A live version appears on their albums ''[[The Way We Walk, Volume Two: The Longs]]'', and ''[[Live Over Europe 2007]]'' (simply titled "Domino") as well as corresponding DVDs ''[[Genesis Live at Wembley Stadium]]'', ''[[The Way We Walk - Live in Concert]]'' and ''[[When in Rome 2007]]''.

==Critical reception==
In 2014, Stevie Chick of ''[[The Guardian]]'' chose "Domino" as one of the ten best Genesis songs and the highlight of the ''Invisible Touch'' album, describing it as "a fusion of everything Genesis had ever been and now become: an 11-minute multi-part epic played with the minimal attack of 'Abacab', the haunting 'In the Glow of the Night' giving way to the anthemic synth-rock bombast of 'The Last Domino'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2014/sep/03/genesis-10-of-the-best | title= Genesis: 10 of the best | work=The Guardian | location=London | first=Stevie | last=Chick | date=3 September 2014 | accessdate=6 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Eschatology |inter}}

The '''end time''' (also called '''end times''', '''end of time''', '''end of days''', '''last days''', '''final days''', or '''eschaton''') is a future time-period described variously in the [[eschatology|eschatologies]] of several [[world religion]]s (both [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic]] and non-Abrahamic), which believe that world events will reach a final climax.

The Abrahamic faiths maintain a linear [[cosmology]], with end-time scenarios containing themes of [[Spiritual transformation|transformation]] and [[Redemption (theology)|redemption]]. In [[Judaism]], the term "end of days" makes reference to the [[Messianic Age]] and includes an in-gathering of the exiled Jewish [[diaspora]], the coming of the [[Jewish Messiah|Messiah]], the [[Techiyat hamaysim|resurrection of the righteous]], and [[Jewish eschatology#"The world to come"|the world to come]]. Some sects of [[Christianity]] depict the end time as a period of [[tribulation]] that precedes the [[Second Coming|second coming]] of [[Jesus Christ|Christ]], who will face the [[Antichrist]] along with his power structure and usher in the [[Kingdom of God]].

In Islam, the [[Yawm al-Qiyāmah|Day of Judgement]] is preceded by the appearance of the [[Masih ad-Dajjal|al-Masih al-Dajjal]], and followed by the descending of [[Jesus in Islam|Isa]] (Jesus). Isa will triumph over the false messiah, or the Antichrist, which will lead to a sequence of events that will end with the sun rising from the west and the beginning of the [[Qiyamah]] (Judgment day).

Non-Abrahamic faiths tend to have more cyclical world-views, with end-time eschatologies characterized by [[Social disintegration|decay]], redemption, and rebirth. In [[Hinduism]], the end time occurs when [[Kalki]], the final incarnation of [[Vishnu]], descends atop a [[White horse (mythology)|white horse]] and brings an end to the current ''[[Kali Yuga]]''. In [[Buddhism]], the [[Buddha]] predicted that his teachings would be forgotten after 5,000 years, followed by turmoil. A ''[[bodhisattva]]'' named [[Maitreya]] will appear and rediscover the teaching of ''[[dharma]]''. The ultimate destruction of the world will then come through seven suns.

Since the development of the concept of [[deep time]] in the 18th century and the calculation of the estimated [[age of the Earth]], scientific discourse about end times has centered on the [[ultimate fate of the universe]]. Theories have included the [[Big Rip]], [[Big Crunch]], [[Big Bounce]], and [[Big Freeze]] ([[Heat death of the universe|heat death]]).

==Cyclic cosmology==

===Indian religions===
====Buddhism====
{{Main|Buddhist eschatology|Maitreya}}
There are two major points of Buddhist eschatology, the appearance of [[Maitreya]], followed by the Sermon of the Seven Suns.

=====Maitreya=====
Buddha described his teachings disappearing five thousand years from when he preached them, corresponding approximately to the year 2300. At this time, knowledge of [[dharma]] will be lost as well. The last of his relics will be gathered in Bodh Gaya and cremated.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}} There will be a new era in which the next Buddha Maitreya will appear, but it will be preceded by the degeneration of human society. This will be a period of greed, lust, poverty, ill will, violence, murder, impiety, physical weakness, sexual depravity and societal collapse, and even the Buddha himself will be forgotten.&lt;ref name="Hooper"/&gt;

This will be followed by the coming of Maitreya when the teachings of [[dharma]] are forgotten. Maitreya was the first Bodhisattva around whom a cult developed, in approximately the 3rd century CE.&lt;ref name="Brittanica"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/358868/Maitreya|title=Maitreya|publisher=Brittanica Encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest mention of Maitreya is in the Cakavatti, or Sihanada Sutta in [[Digha Nikaya]] 26 of the [[Pali Canon]]. In it, [[Gautama Buddha]] predicted that his teachings of dharma would be forgotten after 5,000 years.{{quote|“At that period, brethren, there will arise in the world an Exalted One named Maitreya, Fully Awakened, abounding in wisdom and goodness, happy, with knowledge of the worlds, unsurpassed as a guide to mortals willing to be led, a teacher for gods and men, an Exalted One, a Buddha, even as I am now. He, by himself, will thoroughly know and see, as it were face to face, this universe, with Its worlds of the spirits, Its Brahmas and Its Maras, and Its world of recluses and Brahmins, of princes and peoples, even as I now, by myself, thoroughly know and see them”|Digha Nikaya, 26}}

Maitreya Buddha is then foretold to be born in the city of Ketumatī in present-day Benares, whose king will be the Cakkavattī Sankha. Sankha will live in the former palace of King Mahāpanadā, and will become a renunciate who follows Maitreya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.basicbuddhism.org/index.cfm?GPID=29 |title=''Cakkavatti Sutta: The Wheel-turning Emperor'' |authors=Sutta Pitaka, Digha Nikaya, Pāli Canon |page=26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505101810/http://www.basicbuddhism.org/index.cfm?GPID=29 |archivedate=5 May 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vipassana.info, [http://www.vipassana.info/me_mu/metteyya.htm Pali Proper Names Dictionary: Metteyya]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Mahayana Buddhism, Maitreya will attain ''[[bodhi]]'' in seven days, the minimum period, by virtue of his many lifetimes of preparation. Once Buddha, he will rule over the Ketumati Pure Land, an earthly paradise sometimes associated with the Indian city of [[Varanasi]] or Benares in Uttar Pradesh. In Mahayana Buddhism, the Buddha presides over a land of purity. For example, [[Amitabha]] presides over Sukhavati, more popularly known as the 'Western Paradise'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://enlight.lib.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-BJ013/51013.pdf |title=《彌勒上生經》與《彌勒下生經》簡介 |format=PDF |accessdate=2012-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:KushanMaitreya.JPG|right|upright|thumb|Bodhisattva Maitreya from the 2nd-century Gandharan art period]]

A notable teaching he will rediscover is that of the ten non-virtuous deeds—killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, lying, divisive speech, abusive speech, idle speech, covetousness, harmful intent and wrong views. These will be replaced by the ten virtuous deeds, which are the abandonment of each of these practices. He is described by Conze in his Buddhist Scriptures: {{quote|The Lord replied, 'Maitreya, the best of men, will then leave the [[Tushita|{{IAST|Tuṣita}}]] heavens, and go for his last rebirth. As soon as he is born he will walk seven steps forward, and where he puts down his feet a jewel or a lotus will spring up. He will raise his eyes to the ten directions, and will speak these words: "This is my last birth. There will be no rebirth after this one. Never will I come back here, but, all pure, I shall win Nirvana."|''Buddhist Scriptures'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Buddhist Scriptures|last=Conze|first=Edward|publisher=Penguin Classics|date=1959-07-30|pages=256|isbn= 0140440887}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} He currently resides in [[Tushita]], but will come to [[Jambudvipa]] when needed most as successor to the historic [[Śākyamuni Buddha]]. Maitreya will achieve complete enlightenment during his lifetime, and following this reawakening, he will bring back the timeless teaching of [[dharma]] to this plane and rediscover [[Nirvana (concept)|enlightenment]].&lt;ref name="Theravada Buddhism 1988, pages 83-85"/&gt; The [[Arya Maitreya Mandala]], founded by [[Lama Anagarika Govinda]] is based on the idea of Maitreya.

Maitreya eschatology forms the central canon of the [[Drikung Kagyu|White Lotus Society]], a revolutionary movement during [[British imperialism|British colonial rule]]. It later branched into the [[China|Chinese]] underground criminal organization known as the [[Triad (underground society)|Triad]], which exists today as an international underground criminal network.

It is of note that description of Maitreya occurs in no other sutta in the canon, casting doubt as to authenticity of the scripture. In addition, sermons of the Buddha normally are in response to a question, or in a specific context, but this sutta has a beginning and an ending, and its content is quite different from the others. This has led some to conclude that the whole sutta is apocryphal, or tampered with.&lt;ref name="Theravada Buddhism 1988, pages 83-85"&gt;[[Richard Gombrich]], ''Theravada Buddhism: A Social History from Ancient Benares to Modern Colombo''. Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1988, pages 83–85.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Sermon of the Seven Suns=====
In his "Sermon of the Seven Suns" in the [[Pali Canon]], the Buddha describes the ultimate fate of the world in an apocalypse that will be characterized by the consequent appearance of seven suns in the sky, each causing progressive ruin till the Earth is destroyed:

{{quote|All things are impermanent, all aspects of existence are unstable and non-eternal. Beings will become so weary and disgusted with the constituent things that they will seek emancipation from them more quickly. There will come a season, O monks when, after hundreds of thousands of years, rains will cease. All seedlings, all vegetation, all plants, grasses and trees will dry up and cease to be...There comes another season after a great lapse of time when a second sun will appear. Now all brooks and ponds will dry up, vanish, cease to be.|Aňguttara-Nikăya, VII, 6.2 Pali Canon&lt;ref name="Hooper"/&gt;}}

The canon goes on to describe the progressive destruction of each sun. A third sun will dry the mighty [[Ganges]] and other great rivers. A fourth will cause the great lakes to evaporate, and a fifth will dry the oceans. Finally:

{{quote|Again after a vast period of time a sixth sun will appear, and it will bake the Earth even as a pot is baked by a potter. All the mountains will reek and send up clouds of smoke. After another great interval a seventh sun will appear and the Earth will blaze with fire until it becomes one mass of flame. The mountains will be consumed, a spark will be carried on the wind and go to the worlds of God....Thus, monks, all things will burn, perish and exist no more except those who have seen the path.||Aňguttara-Nikăya, VII, 6.2 Pali Canon&lt;ref name="Hooper"/&gt;}}

The sermon completes with the planet engulfed by a vast inferno. The Pali Canon does not indicate when this will happen relative to Maitreya.&lt;ref name="Hooper"/&gt;

====Hinduism====
{{Main|Hindu eschatology|Kalki}}
In [[Hindu eschatology]], time is cyclic and consists of [[Kalpa (aeon)|kalpas]]. Each lasts 4.1 – 8.2 billion years, which is a period of one full day and night for [[Brahma]], who will be alive for 311 trillion, 40 billion years. Within a ''kalpa'' there are periods of [[Brahma|creation]], [[Vishnu|preservation]] and [[Shiva|decline]]. After this larger cycle, all of creation will contract to a [[Gravitational singularity|singularity]] and then again will expand from that single point, as the [[yuga|ages]] continue in a religious [[fractal]] pattern.&lt;ref name="Hooper"/&gt;

Within the current kalpa, there are four epochs that encompass the cycle. They progress from a beginning of complete purity to a descent into total corruption. The last of the four ages is [[Kali Yuga]], our current time, during which will be characterized by impiety, violence and decay. The four pillars of dharma will be reduced to one, with truth being all that remains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.astrojyoti.com/vishnupurana.htm |title = Vishnu Purana |publisher = Astrojyoti.com |accessdate = 2011-11-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As written in the [[Bhagavad Gita|Gita]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Yadā yadā hi dharmasya glānirbhavati Bhārata
Abhyutthānam adharmasya tadātmānam sṛjāmyaham

Whenever there is decay of righteousness O! Bharata
And a rise of unrighteousness then I manifest Myself!&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m06/m06025.htm |title=The Mahabharata, Book 6, Bhagavad Gita Chapter IV, Section 7|publisher=Sacred-texts.com|accessdate = 12 Nov 2012|date = 12 Nov 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At this time of chaos, the final avatar, [[Kalki]], endowed with eight superhuman faculties  will appear on a white horse. Kalki will amass an army to "establish righteousness upon the earth" and leave "the minds of the people as pure as crystal."

At the completion of [[Kali Yuga]], the next cycle will begin with a new [[Satya Yuga]], in which all will once again be righteous with the reestablishment of dharma. This, in turn, will be followed by epochs of Treta Yuga, Dwapara Yuga and again another Kali Yuga. This cycle will then repeat till the larger cycle of existence under [[Brahma]] returns to the [[Gravitational singularity|singularity]], and a new universe is born.&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Browne|first1=Sylvia|last2=Harrison|first2=Lindsay|title=End of Days: Predictions and Prophecies About the End of the World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bAAOiMl1BIcC|year=2008|publisher=Penguin Publishing Group|isbn=978-1-4406-3141-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Ragnarök}}
[[File:Odin und Fenriswolf Freyr und Surt.jpg|thumb|upright|Odin fighting his old nemesis [[Fenrir]]]]
[[File:Ragnarök by Doepler.jpg|thumb|upright|Ragnarök after Surtr has engulfed the world with fire]]
[[Norse mythology]] depicts the end of days as ''Ragnarök'', an [[Old Norse]] term translatable as "twilight of the gods". It will be heralded by a devastation known as [[Fimbulvetr]] which will seize [[Midgard]] in cold and darkness. The sun and moon will disappear from the sky, and poison will fill the air. Dead will rise from the ground and there will be widespread despair.

There follows a battle between – on the one hand – the Gods with the [[Æsir]], [[Vanir]]{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} and [[Einherjar]], led by [[Odin]], and – on the other hand – forces of Chaos, including the fire giants and [[jötunn]], led by [[Loki]]. In the fighting [[Odin]] will be swallowed whole by his old nemesis [[Fenrir]].&lt;ref name=LARRINGTON266&gt;Larrington (1996:266).&lt;/ref&gt; The god [[Freyr]] fights [[Surtr]] but loses. [[Víðarr]], son of Odin, will then avenge his father by ripping Fenrir's jaws apart and stabbing the wolf in the heart with his spear. The serpent [[Jörmungandr]] will open its gaping maw and be met in combat by [[Thor]]. Thor, also a son of Odin, will defeat the serpent, only to take nine steps afterwards before collapsing to his own death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Larrington |first = Carolyne|authorlink = | title= The Poetic Edda| publisher = [[Oxford World's Classics]] | year = 1999 | doi = | isbn = 0-19-283946-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After this people will flee their homes as the sun blackens and the earth sinks into the sea. The stars will vanish, steam will rise, and flames will touch the heavens. This conflict will result in the deaths of most of the major Gods and forces of Chaos. Finally, [[Surtr]] will fling fire across the nine worlds. The ocean will then completely submerge [[Midgard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Bellows|first = Henry Adams|authorlink = | title= The Poetic Edda: The Mythological Poems| publisher = [[Dover Publications]] | year = 2004 | isbn = 0-486-43710-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the cataclysm the world will resurface new and fertile, and the surviving Gods will meet. [[Baldr]], also a son of Odin will be reborn in the new world, according to [[Völuspá]]. The two human survivors, [[Líf and Lífþrasir]], will then repopulate this new earth.&lt;ref name="Odin"&gt;{{cite book|last = Byock | first = Jesse | title = The Prose Edda| publisher = [[Penguin Classics]] | year = 2005 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=bAAOiMl1BIcC| isbn = 0-14-044755-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abrahamic religions===
====Bahá'í Faith====
The founder of the [[Bahá'í Faith]], [[Bahá'u'lláh]] claimed that he was the [[Second Coming|return of Christ]] as well as prophetic expectations of other religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Studies in Modern Religions, Religious Movements and the Bābī-Bahā'ī Faiths | editor = Sharon, Moshe | chapter = The eschatology of Globalization: The multiple-messiahship of Bahā'u'llāh revisited | first = Christopher | last = Buck | isbn = 90-04-13904-4 | pages = 143–178 | location = Boston | publisher = Brill | year = 2004 | url = http://bahai-library.com/buck_eschatology_globalization }}&lt;/ref&gt; The inception of the Bahá'í Faith coincides with [[Great Disappointment|Millerite prophesy]], pointing to the year 1844. They also believe the [[Battle of Armageddon]] has passed and that the mass martyrdom anticipated during the ''End Times'' had already passed within the [[Persecution of Bahá'ís#Historical context|historical context]] of the Bahá'í Faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Smith |first = P. |year = 1999 |title = A Concise Encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |publisher = Oneworld Publications |location = Oxford, UK |pages = 98 &amp; 247–248 |isbn = 1-85168-184-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author = Stephen Lambden |url = http://bahai-library.com/lambden_catastrophe_millennium |title = Catastrophe, Armageddon and Millennium: some aspects of the Bábí-Baha'i exegesis of apocalyptic symbolism |publisher = Bahai-library.com |accessdate = 2011-11-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bahá'ís expect their faith to be eventually embraced by the masses of the world, ushering in a [[golden age]].

====Christianity====
{{Christian Eschatology}}
{{Main|Second Coming|Christian eschatology|Last Judgment}}
;Date
Some [[Christianity in the 1st century|first-century Christians]] believed Jesus would return during their lifetime. When the converts of Paul in [[Thessalonica]] were persecuted by the [[Roman Empire]], they believed the end of days to be imminent.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Second Epistle to the Thessalonians|2 Thessalonians]] chapter {{bibleverse-nb|2|Thess|2}} and [[Son of perdition]].&lt;/ref&gt;

While some who believe in the literal interpretation of the Bible insist that the prediction of dates or times is futile, others believe Jesus foretold signs of the end of days. The precise time, however, will come like a "thief in the night" ({{bibleref2|1 Thess.|5:2}}). They may also refer to {{bibleref2|Matthew|24:36}} in which Jesus is quoted as saying:
{{quote|
"But concerning that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels of heaven, nor the Son, but the Father only."}}

;Great Tribulation
{{Main|Abomination of desolation|Great Tribulation}}
In the New Testament, Jesus refers to this period preceding the end times as the "Great Tribulation" ({{bibleref2|Matthew 24:21}}), "Affliction"({{bibleref2|Mark 13:19}}), and "days of vengeance"({{bibleref2|Luke 21:22}}).

The Book of Matthew describes the devastation:
{{quote|When ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place, (whoso readeth, let him understand). Then let them which be in Judaea flee into the mountains. Let him which is on the housetop not come down...Neither let him which is in the field return back to take his clothes, and woe unto them that are with child...For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be. And except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be saved: but for the elect's sake those days shall be shortened.|{{bibleref2|Matthew|24:15–22}}}}

The resulting chaos will affect pregnancies, newborns, and a scourge will spread throughout the flesh, save for the elect. The vivid imagery of this section is repeated closely in {{bibleref2|Mark|13:14–20}}.

The Gospel of Luke describes a complete unraveling of the social fabric, with widespread calamity and war:
{{quote|Then he said to them, “Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be great earthquakes, and in various places famines and pestilences. And there will be terrors and great signs from heaven. But before all this they will lay their hands on you and persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues and prisons, and you will be brought before kings and governors for my name's sake. This will be your opportunity to bear witness. Settle it therefore in your minds not to meditate beforehand how to answer, for I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which none of your adversaries will be able to withstand or contradict. You will be delivered up even by parents and brothers and relatives and friends, and some of you they will put to death. You will be hated by all for my name's sake. But not a hair of your head will perish. By your endurance you will gain your lives.

“But when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then know that its desolation has come near. Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains, and let those who are inside the city depart, and let not those who are out in the country enter it, for these are days of vengeance, to fulfill all that is written. Alas for women who are pregnant and for those who are nursing infants in those days! For there will be great distress upon the earth and wrath against this people. They will fall by the edge of the sword and be led captive among all nations, and Jerusalem will be trampled underfoot by the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled.

“And there will be signs in sun and moon and stars, and on the earth distress of nations in perplexity because of the roaring of the sea and the waves, people fainting with fear and with foreboding of what is coming on the world. For the powers of the heavens will be shaken. And then they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory. Now when these things begin to take place, straighten up and raise your heads, because your redemption is drawing near.”

And he told them a parable: “Look at the fig tree, and all the trees. As soon as they come out in leaf, you see for yourselves and know that the summer is already near. So also, when you see these things taking place, you know that the kingdom of God is near. Truly, I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all has taken place. Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.|{{bibleref2|Luke|21:10–33}}}}

=====Catholicism=====
The [[Profession of faith (Catholic Church)|Profession of Faith]] addresses Catholic beliefs concerning the Last Days.&lt;ref&gt;
An explanation of these beliefs appears on the [http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p1s2c2a7.htm#668 Holy See's website]&lt;/ref&gt; Catholicism adheres to the [[Amillennialism|amillennial]] school of thought, promoted by [[Augustine of Hippo]] in his work [[City of God (book)|''The City of God'']].

=====Protestantism=====
[[File:Antichrist1.jpg|thumb|left|The Antichrist, by [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]] (1521) Here the [[Antichrist]] is shown wearing the triple crown of the Roman papacy.]]
Protestants are divided between Millennialists and Amillennialists. [[Millennialism|Millennialists]] concentrate on the issue of whether the true believers will see the [[tribulation]] or be removed from it by what is referred to as a Pre-Tribulation [[Rapture]]. [[Amillennialism|Amillennialists]] believe that the end times encompass the time from Christ's ascension to the Last day, and maintain that the mention of the "thousand years" in the [[Book of Revelation]] is meant to be taken metaphorically (i.e., not literally, or 'spiritually'), a view which continues to cause divisions within [[Protestantism|evangelical]] Christianity.

There is a range of eschatological belief in Protestant Christianity. Christian [[premillennialism|premillennialists]] who believe that the End Times are occurring now, are usually specific about timelines that climax in the end of the world. For some, [[Israel]], the [[European Union]], or the United Nations are seen as major players whose roles were foretold in scripture. Within [[dispensationalism|dispensational premillennialist]] writing, there is the belief that Christians will be summoned to [[Heaven]] by Christ at the [[Rapture]], occurring before a "Great Tribulation" prophesied in Matthew 24–25; Mark 13 and Luke 21. The Tribulation is described in the book of Revelation.

"End times" may also refer to the passing of an age or long period in the relationship between man and God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chang Soppe|first1=Seok Lyun|title=God's Mystery That Is Christ|date=2014|publisher=WestBow Press|isbn=1490815945}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adherents to this view cite the [[Second Epistle to Timothy]] and draw analogies to the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries.

Post-Exilic Hebrew books of [[prophecy]] such as [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]] and [[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]] are given new interpretations in this tradition, while in [[apocalyptic literature|apocalyptic forecasts]] appear in the Judeo-Christian [[Sibylline Oracles]] which include the Book of Revelation ascribed to John, the [[apocrypha]]l [[Apocalypse of Peter]], and the [[2 Esdras|Second Book Of Esdras]].

Most fundamentalist Christians anticipate biblical prophecy to be literally fulfilled. They see current wars, natural disaster and famine as the birth pangs which Jesus described in Matthew {{bibleverse-nb||Matthew|24:7–8|}} and Mark {{bibleverse-nb||Mark|13:8|}}. They believe that mankind began in the [[garden of Eden]], and point to the Valley of [[Megiddo (place)|Megiddo]] as the place where the current [[World-system|world system]] will terminate, after which the Messiah will rule for 1,000 years.

Contemporary use of the term ''End Times'' has evolved from literal belief in Christian [[millennialism]]. In this tradition, [[Biblical]] [[apocalypse]] is believed to be imminent, with various current events as [[omen]]s of impending [[Armageddon]]. These beliefs have been put forward by the Adventist movement ([[Millerites]]), [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], and [[dispensationalism|dispensational premillennialists]]. In 1918 a group of eight well known preachers produced the [[London Manifesto]], warning of an imminent second coming of Christ shortly after the 1917 liberation of Jerusalem by the British.

[[Image:Icon second coming.jpg|right|thumb|Icon of the Second Coming. Greek, ca. 1700 A.D.]]Religious movements which expect that the [[Parousia|second coming of Christ]] as a cataclysmic event are generally called ''adventism''. These have arisen throughout the Christian era, but were particularly common after the [[Protestant Reformation]]. [[Emanuel Swedenborg]] considered the second coming to be symbolic, and to have occurred in 1757. Along with others, he developed a religious system around the second coming of Christ, disclosed by new prophecy or special revelation not described in the Bible. The [[Millerites]] are diverse religious groups which similarly rely upon a special gift of interpretation for predicting the second coming.

The difference between the 19th-century Millerite and [[Adventism|Adventist]] movements and contemporary prophecy is that [[William Miller (preacher)|William Miller]] and his followers, based on Biblical interpretation, predicted the time of the Second Coming to have occurred in 1844. Contemporary writing of end time has suggested that the timetable will be triggered by future wars and [[moral panic|moral catastrophe]], and that this time of tribulation is close at hand.

Seventh-day Adventists believe Biblical prophecy to foretell an end time scenario in which the United States works in conjunction with the Catholic Church to mandate worship on a day other than the true Sabbath, Saturday, as prescribed in the Ten Commandments (Exodus 20:8–11). This will bring about a situation where one must choose for or against the Bible as the will of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.adventist.org/beliefs/statements/main_stat42.html |title = How Seventh-day Adventists View Roman Catholicism }} – Main Statements of Belief from the official Adventist Church website.&lt;/ref&gt;

======Preterism======
{{Main|Preterism}}
Another view of the ''end times'' is [[preterism]]. It distinguishes ''the time of the end'' from ''the end of time''.  Preterists believe the term ''Last Days'' (or ''Time of the End'') refers to, neither the last days of the Earth, nor the last days of humankind, but the end of the [[Mosaic covenant|Old Covenant]] between [[Yahweh|God]] and [[Israelites#Biblical Israelites|Israel]];  which, according to preterism, took place when the [[Second Temple|Temple]] in [[Jerusalem]] which was destroyed in 70 [[Common Era|CE]].

Preterists believe that [[Bible Prophecy|prophecies]]—such as the [[Second Coming]], the desecration of the Jewish Temple, the destruction of Jerusalem, the rise of the [[Antichrist]], the [[Great Tribulation]], the advent of [[The Day of the Lord]], and a [[Last Judgment|Final Judgment]]—had been fulfilled when the Romans [[destruction of Jerusalem|sacked Jerusalem]] and completely destroyed its Temple.

Proponents of ''full preterism'' do not believe in a coming [[resurrection of the dead]]. They place this event (as well as the Second Coming) in the year 70. Advocates of [[partial preterism]] do believe in a coming resurrection. Full preterists contend that partial preterists are merely ''futurists'', since they believe the Second Coming, the Resurrection, the [[Rapture]], and the Judgment are yet to come.

Many preterists believe that first-century [[Christian]]s experienced the Rapture to rejoin the [[Christ]].

According with Preterism's [[Christian views on the Old Covenant|interpretation]] of end times, many "time passages" in the [[New Testament]] foretell a [[Second Coming]] of Christ, with Last Days to take place within the lifetimes of his disciples: [[Gospel of Matthew|Matt.]] 10:23, [[Gospel of Matthew|Matt.]] 16:28, [[Gospel of Matthew|Matt.]] 24:34, [[Gospel of Matthew|Matt.]] 26:64, [[Epistle to the Romans|Rom.]] 13:11–12, [[1 Corinthians|1 Cor.]] 7:29–31, [[1 Corinthians|1 Cor.]] 10:11, [[Epistle to the Philippians|Phil.]] 4:5, [[Epistle of James|James]] 5:8–9, [[1 Peter|1 Pet.]] 4:7, [[1 John|1 Jn.]] 2:18.

======Dispensationalist prophecies======
{{Main|Dispensationalism|Christian Zionism}}
Dispensationalism is an [[evangelical]] [[futurist]] Bibilical interpretation that foresees a series of [[dispensation (period)|dispensations]], or periods, in which God relates to human beings under different [[Biblical covenants]]. The belief system is primarily rooted in the writings of [[John Nelson Darby]] and is [[premillennial]] in content. The [[Declaration of Independence (Israel)|reestablishment of Israel]] in 1948 provided a major impetus to the dispensationalist belief system. The wars of Israel after 1948 with its Arab neighbors provided further support, according to [[John F. Walvoord]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biblio.com/isbn/0310539218.html |title=Armageddon, Oil and the Middle East Crisis |author=[[John F. Walvoord]] |origyear=1974|year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Six-Day War]] in 1967, and the [[Yom Kippur War]] in 1973, it seemed plausible to many [[Fundamentalist Christians]] in the 1970s that Middle East turmoil may well be leading up to the fulfillment of various Bible prophecies and to the Battle of [[Armageddon]].

Members of the dispensationalist movement such as [[Hal Lindsey]], [[J. Dwight Pentecost]], [[John Walvoord]], all of whom have [[Dallas Theological Seminary]] backgrounds, and some other writers, claimed further that the [[European Economic Community]], which preceded the [[European Union]], would become a [[United States of Europe]], which would in turn become a Revived Roman Empire ruled by the [[Antichrist]]. The Revived Roman Empire also figured into the [[New Testament]] writers' vision of the future. The fact that in the early 1970s, there were (erroneously thought to be) seven nations in the European Economic Community was held to be significant; this aligned the Community with a seven-headed beast mentioned in Revelation. This specific prophecy has required revision, but the idea of a Revived Roman Empire remains.

The separate destinies of the Church and Israel, a belief which is inherent in [[dispensationalism]], is a particular concern to some Jews and evangelical Christians. Evangelicals who reject dispensationalism, such as those who hold to a [[Post Tribulation Rapture]], (or more accurately a Post Tribulation Resurrection-Rapture), see both the Church and Israel entering the crucible of the End Time together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voltairenet.org/article144310.html|title=The Jerusalem Declaration on Christian Zionism|publisher=Riah Abu El-Assal, Swerios Malki Mourad, His Beatitude Michel Sabbah, Bishop Dr. Munib Younan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dispensationalism, in contrast to the Millerite Adventist movement, had its beginning in the 19th century, when [[John Nelson Darby]], founder of the [[Plymouth Brethren]] [[religious denomination]], incorporated into his system of Biblical interpretation a system of organizing Biblical time into a number of discrete [[dispensation (period)|dispensations]], each of which marks a separate [[Covenant (religion)|covenant]] with God. Darby's beliefs were widely publicized in [[Cyrus I. Scofield]]'s ''[[Scofield Reference Bible]]'', an annotated Bible that became popular in the United States of America.

Since the majority of the Biblical prophets were writing at a time when the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] was still functioning, they wrote as if it would still be standing during the prophesied events. According to preterism, this was a fulfillment of the prophecies. However, according to [[Futurism (Christian eschatology)|Futurists]], their destruction in AD 70 put the prophetic timetable on hold. Many such believers therefore anticipated the return of Jews to Israel and the [[Third Temple#Christian views|reconstruction of the Temple]] before the Second Coming could occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://christianactionforisrael.org/congress.html|title=Proclamation of the 3rd International Zionist Congress|accessdate=27 Nov 2012|date=25 Feb 1996 |publisher=Christian Action For Israel|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120719161650/http://christianactionforisrael.org/congress.html|archivedate=19 July 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leaderu.com/common/british.html|title=The Untold Story: The Role of Christian Zionists in the Establishment of Modern-day Israel|accessdate=27 Nov 2012|date=13 Jul 2002|publisher=Rabbi Jamie Cowen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A view of the Second Coming of Christ as held by post-tribulational pre-millennialists holds that the Church of Christ will have to undergo great persecution by being present during the great tribulation.

{{main|Great Disappointment}}
[[File:William Miller.jpg|thumb|upright=0.56|left|William Miller predicted the end of the world in 1843, known as the [[Great Disappointment]]]]In 1843, [[William Miller (preacher)|William Miller]] made the first of several predictions that the world would end in only a few months. As his predictions did not come true (referred to as the [[Great Disappointment]]), [[Millerites|followers of Miller]] went on to found separate groups, the most successful of which is the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]].

Members of the [[Bahá'í Faith]] believe that Miller's interpretation of signs and dates of the coming of Jesus were, for the most part, correct.&lt;ref name="momen"&gt;{{cite journal | journal = Bahá'í Studies Review | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | year = 1992 | first = Moojan | last = Momen | title = Fundamentalism and Liberalism: towards an understanding of the dichotomy |url=http://bahai-library.com/momen_fundamentalism_liberalism_dichotomy }}&lt;/ref&gt; They believe that the fulfillment of biblical prophecies of the coming of Christ came through a forerunner of their own religion, the [[Báb]].

=====Restorationism (Christian primitivism)=====
End times theology is also significant to [[Restorationism (Christian primitivism)|restorationist]] Christian religions, which consider themselves distinct from both Catholicism and Protestantism.

======Jehovah's Witnesses======
{{Main|Eschatology of Jehovah's Witnesses}}
[[File:Watchtower Bible &amp; Tract Society (world headquarters).jpg|upright|right|thumb|300px|Former Watch Tower headquarters in [[Brooklyn]]. The society made a number of emphatic claims of impending last days and ensuing chaos between 1879–1924.]]
The [[eschatology]] of [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] is central to their religious beliefs. They believe that [[Jesus Christ]] has been ruling in heaven as king since 1914 (a date they believe was prophesied in Scripture), and that after that time a period of cleansing occurred, resulting in God's selection of the [[Bible Student movement|Bible Students]] associated with [[Charles Taze Russell]] to be his people in 1919. They also believe the destruction of those who reject their message&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=The Watchtower|title=The House-to-House Ministry—Why Important Now?|date=15 July 2008|pages=5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus willfully refuse to obey God&lt;ref&gt;''You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth'', Watch Tower Bible &amp; Tract Society, 1989, p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Revelation—Its Grand Climax at Hand!'', Watch Tower Bible &amp; Tract Society, 1988, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; will shortly take place at [[Armageddon#Jehovah's Witnesses|Armageddon]], ensuring that the beginning of the new earthly society will be composed of willing subjects of that kingdom.

The religion's doctrines surrounding 1914 are the legacy of a series of emphatic claims regarding the years 1799,&lt;ref name=indisputable&gt;''The Watchtower'', 1 March 1922, page 73, "The indisputable facts, therefore, show that the 'time of the end' began in 1799; that the Lord's second presence began in 1874."&lt;/ref&gt; 1874,&lt;ref name=indisputable /&gt; 1878,&lt;ref name="OurFaith1875"&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=The Herald of the Morning|title=Our Faith|url=http://www.watchtowerdocuments.com/downloads/1874-1876_Herald_of_the_Morning.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512062421/http://www.watchtowerdocuments.com/downloads/1874-1876_Herald_of_the_Morning.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2008-05-12|format=PDF|date=September 1875|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1914,&lt;ref name="TheWatchtower"&gt;''The Watchtower'', [http://www.mostholyfaith.com/bible/Reprints/Z1894JUL.asp#R1677 July 15, 1894, p. 1677]: "We see no reason for changing the figures—nor could we change them if we would. They are, we believe, God's dates, not ours. But bear in mind that the end of 1914 is not the date for the beginning, but for the end of the time of trouble."&lt;/ref&gt; 1918&lt;ref name="September"&gt;1 September 1916 ''The Watchtower'', pages [http://www.mostholyfaith.com/bible/Reprints/Z1916SEP.asp#Z264:2 264–265]&lt;/ref&gt; and 1925&lt;ref name="MillionsNow"&gt;''Millions Now Living Will Never Die'', 1920, page 97, "Based upon the argument heretofore set forth, then, that the old order of things, the old world, is ending and is therefore passing away, and that the new order is coming in, and that 1925 shall mark the resurrection of the faithful worthies of old and the beginning of reconstruction, it is reasonable to conclude that millions of people now on the earth will be still on the earth in 1925. Then, based upon the promises set forth in the divine Word, we must reach the positive and indisputable conclusion that millions now living will never die."&lt;/ref&gt; made in the [[Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania|Watch Tower Society's]] publications between 1879 and 1924. Claims about the significance of those years, including the presence of Jesus Christ, the beginning of the "last days", the destruction of worldly governments and the earthly resurrection of Jewish patriarchs, were successively abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Holden | first = Andrew | title = Jehovah's Witnesses: Portrait of a Contemporary Religious Movement | publisher = Routledge | year = 2002 | page = 1 | isbn = 0-415-26609-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1922 the society's principal journal, ''[[The Watchtower]]'', described its chronology as "no stronger than its weakest link", but also claimed the chronological relationships to be "of divine origin and divinely corroborated...in a class by itself, absolutely and unqualifiedly correct"&lt;ref&gt;"The Strong Cable of Chronology", ''Watch Tower'', 15 July 1922, page 217, "The chronology of present truth is, to begin with, a string of dates... Thus far it is a chain, and no stronger than its weakest link. There exist, however, well established relationships among the dates of present-truth chronology. These internal connections of the dates impart a much greater strength than can be found in other [secular, archeological] chronologies. Some of them are of so remarkable a character as clearly to indicate that this chronology is not of man, but of God. Being of divine origin and divinely corroborated, present-truth chronology stands in a class by itself, absolutely and unqualifiedly correct."&lt;/ref&gt; and "indisputable facts",&lt;ref name=indisputable /&gt; while repudiation of Russell's teachings was described as "equivalent to a repudiation of the Lord".&lt;ref&gt;''The Watchtower'', 1 May 1922, page 132, "To abandon or repudiate the Lord's chosen instrument means to abandon or repudiate the Lord himself, upon the principle that he who rejects the servant sent by the Master thereby rejects the Master. ... Brother Russell was the Lord's servant. Then to repudiate him and his work is equivalent to a repudiation of the Lord, upon the principle heretofore announced."&lt;/ref&gt;

The Watch Tower Society has admitted its early leaders promoted "incomplete, even inaccurate concepts".&lt;ref&gt;''Jehovah's Witnesses—Proclaimers of God's Kingdom'' (Watch Tower Society, 1993), chapter 10.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Governing Body of Jehovah's Witnesses]] says that, unlike [[Old Testament]] [[Prophet#Judaism|prophets]], its interpretations of the Bible are not [[Biblical inspiration|inspired]] or [[Biblical infallibility|infallible]].&lt;ref&gt;''Revelation – Its Grand Climax'', Watch Tower Bible &amp; Tract Society, 1988, page 9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = Reasoning From the Scriptures | publisher = Watchtower Bible and Tract Society | chapter = False Prophets | at = p.137:Have not Jehovah's Witnesses made errors in their teachings? }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine| title = To Whom Shall We Go but Jesus Christ? | magazine= Watchtower | date = 1 March 1979 | page = 23 | quote = the “faithful and discreet slave” has alerted all of God’s people to the sign of the times indicating the nearness of God’s Kingdom rule.

Watch Tower publications often cite Proverbs 4:18, "The path of the righteous ones is like the bright light that is getting lighter and lighter until the day is firmly established" ([[New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures|NWT]]) to support their view that there would be an increase in knowledge during "the time of the end", as mentioned in Daniel 12:4. Jehovah's Witnesses state that this increase in knowledge needs adjustments. Watch Tower publications also say that unfulfilled expectations are partly due to eagerness for [[God's Kingdom]] and that they do not call [[Jehovah's Witnesses beliefs|their core beliefs]] into question.&lt;ref&gt;Why have there been changes over the years in the teachings of Jehovah’s Witnesses?,"Jehovah's Witnesses", ''Reasoning From the Scriptures'', 1989, Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, page 205&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Allow No Place for the Devil!", ''The Watchtower'', 15 March 1986, page 19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Keep in Step With Jehovah’s Organization", ''Watchtower'', 15 January 2001, page 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

======The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints======
{{main|Second Coming (LDS Church)}}
Members of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] believe that there will be a Second Coming of Jesus to the earth sometime in the future. The LDS Church and its leaders do not make any predictions of the actual date of the Second Coming.

According to church doctrine, the true [[gospel]] will be taught in all parts of the world prior to the Second Coming.&lt;ref name="Matthew 24:14"&gt;[http://lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/24.14?lang=eng#13 Matthew 24:14] KJV&lt;/ref&gt; They also believe that there will be increasing war, earthquakes, hurricanes, and man-made disasters prior to the Second Coming.&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Doctrine and Covenants|dc|45|26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Disasters of all kind will happen before Christ comes.&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|doctrine and covenants|dc|45|26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Upon the return of Jesus Christ, all people will be resurrected, the righteous in a first resurrection and the unrighteous in a second, later resurrection. Christ shall reign for a period of 1000 years, after which the Final Judgement will occur.

According to Harun Yahya, the first period is said to have begun with the death of Muhammad. The second began with the passing of all his Companions, and ended a thousand years later. Another event of the second period was the Tartar invasion, occurring 650 years after Muhammad. The Mongols, led by [[Hulagu Khan]], grandson of [[Genghis Khan]], attacked Baghdad in 1258 AD and brought the Abbasid caliphate to an end. They massacred millions of Muslims, and the water of the river Tigris turned red with blood. A traditional narration also predicted a fire at Madinah in the Hijaz near [[Busra]] in Syria, which Islamic scholars believe occurred in 654 AH. Following the second, the third and final period will be heralded by the appearance of the [[Mahdi]].&lt;ref name="Mahdi2"/&gt;

In its writing, the present age has been witness to the evil of man and wrath of God, with war and natural disaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://aaiil.org/text/books/others/mirzamasumbeg/propheciespromisedmessiah/propheciespromisedmessiah.pdf |title = Prophecies of the Promised Messiah -- www.aaiil.org |format = PDF |accessdate = 2010-03-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad|Ghulam Ahmad]]  is seen as the [[Second coming|promised Messiah]] and the [[Mahdi]], fulfilling Islamic and Biblical prophecies, as well as scriptures of other religions such as Hinduism. His teaching will establish spiritual reform and establish an age of peace. This will continue for a thousand years, and will unify mankind under one faith.&lt;ref&gt;''The Review of Religions'', January 2009, Vol.104, issue 1. p. 18-22&lt;/ref&gt;

Ahmadis believe that despite harsh and strong opposition and discrimination they will eventually be triumphant and their message vindicated both by Muslims and non-Muslims alike. Ahmadis also incorporate the eschatological views from other religions into their doctrine and believe that Mirza Ghulam Ahmed falls into this sequence.&lt;ref&gt;HFaith and Philosophy of Islam – Page 180, Shamim Akhter – 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

====Judaism====
[[Image:Isaiah scroll.PNG|thumb|200px|right|Scroll of Book of Isaiah]]
{{Main|Jewish eschatology}}
In [[rabbinic literature]], rabbis elaborated and explained the prophecies that were found in the Hebrew Bible, along with [[oral law]] and rabbinic traditions about its significance.  The main tenets of Jewish eschatology, in no particular order, include:&lt;ref name="Jewish Eschatology"&gt;{{cite web|title= Jewish Eschatology|url= http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/5849-eschatology|work= Jewish Encyclopedia|accessdate= 1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* God will redeem Israel from the captivity that began during the [[Babylonian Exile]] in a new [[The Exodus|Exodus]].
* God will return the Jewish people to the [[Land of Israel]].
* God will restore the [[Davidic line|House of David]] and the [[The Third Temple|Temple in Jerusalem]].
* God will raise up a regent from the House of David, the [[Jewish Messiah]], to lead the Jewish people and the world and to usher in an [[Messianic Age|age of justice and peace]].
* Nations will recognize that the [[God in Judaism|God of Israel]] is the only true god.
* God will [[Resurrection of the Dead|resurrect the dead]].
* God will create a [[World to Come#Judaism|new heaven and earth]].

The idea of a [[messianic age]], an era of global peace and knowledge of the Creator, has a prominent place in Jewish thought, and is incorporated as part of the end of days.  A well-known passage from the [[Book of Isaiah]] describes this future condition of the world: "They shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks; nation will not lift sword against nation and they will no longer study warfare" (2:4)&lt;ref name="Jewish Eschatology"/&gt; [[Maimonides]] (1135–1204) further describes the Messianic Era in the [[Mishneh Torah]]: "And at that time there will be no hunger or war, no jealousy or rivalry. For the good will be plentiful, and all delicacies available as dust. The entire occupation of the world will be only to know God... the people Israel will be of great wisdom; they will perceive the esoteric truths and comprehend their Creator's wisdom as is the capacity of man. As it is written (Isaiah 11:9): 'For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of God, as the waters cover the sea.'"&lt;ref&gt;Mishneh Torah, Laws of Kings 12:5&lt;/ref&gt;

The Zohar&lt;ref&gt;Zohar, Vayera 119a&lt;/ref&gt; maintains that the seven days of the week, based on the seven days of creation, correspond to the seven millennia of creation. The seventh day of the week, the [[Shabbat]] day of rest, corresponds to the seventh millennium, the age of universal rest, or the Messianic Era. The seventh millennium begins with the year 6000 [[Anno Mundi|AM]], and is the latest time the Messiah can come. A number of early and late Jewish scholars have written in support of this, including the [[Nahmanides|Ramban]],&lt;ref&gt;Ramban on Genesis (2:3)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Isaac Abrabanel]],&lt;ref&gt;Abarbanel on Genesis 2&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abraham Ibn Ezra]],&lt;ref&gt;Ramban quoting Ibn Ezra at Leviticus (25:2)&lt;/ref&gt; Rabbeinu [[Bachya]],&lt;ref&gt;Bachya on Genesis 2:3&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Vilna Gaon]],&lt;ref&gt;Safra D'Tzniusa, Ch. 5&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Lubavitcher Rebbe]],&lt;ref&gt;Sefer HaSichos 5750:254&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Ramchal]],&lt;ref&gt;Derech Hashem 4:7:2&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aryeh Kaplan]]&lt;ref&gt;Page 318, The Real Messiah {{cite book|first1=Aryeh|last1=Kaplan|title= The Aryeh Kaplan Anthology: Illuminating Expositions on Jewish Thought and Practice by a Revered Teacher|url=https://books.google.com/?id=7vxjgVY33LkC&amp;pg=PA318&amp;lpg=PA318&amp;dq=aryeh+kaplan+1840#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|publisher=Mesorah Publications|date=1 August 1991|isbn=9780899068664|accessdate=2 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Rebbetzin [[Esther Jungreis]].&lt;ref&gt;

====Rastafari movement====
{{main|Rastafari movement}}
[[File:Selassie restored.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Haile Selassie I]] is viewed as god incarnate in [[Rastafarianism]]]]
Rastafarians have a unique interpretation of end times, based on the [[Old Testament]] and the [[Book of Revelation]]. They believe [[Ethiopia]]n Emperor [[Haile Selassie I]] to be God [[incarnate]], the ''King of kings'' and ''Lord of lords'' mentioned in Revelation 5:5. They saw the crowning of Selassie as the [[second coming]], and the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War]] as fulfillment of Revelation. There is also the expectation that Selassie will return for a day of judgment and bring home the lost children of Israel, which in Rastafarianism refer to those taken from Africa through the [[slave trade]]. There will then be an era of peace and harmony at Mount [[Zion]] in Africa.&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt;

===Zoroastrianism===
{{Main|Frashokereti}}
Zoroastrian eschatology is considered one of the oldest in recorded history.  The birth of its founder, [[Zoroaster]], is unknown, with scholarly dates ranging from 6th century BCE to 5,500 years earlier.  [[Pliny the Elder]] even suggests there were two Zoroasters.&lt;ref name="WestDate13"&gt;{{harvnb|West|2013|pp=89–109}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However,  with beliefs paralleling and possibly predating the framework of the major Abrahamic faiths, a fully developed concept of the end of the world was not established in Zoroastrianism until 500 BCE. The [[Bahman Yasht]] describes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;At the end of thy tenth hundredth winter, the [[sun]] is more unseen and more spotted; the year, month, and day are shorter; and the earth is more barren; and the crop will not yield the seed. And men become more deceitful and more given to vile practices. They will have no gratitude. Honorable wealth will proceed to those of perverted faith. And a dark cloud makes the whole sky night, and it will rain more noxious creatures than water.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
A [[Manichaeism|Manichaean]] battle between the righteous and wicked will be followed by the [[Frashokereti]]. On earth, the [[Saoshyant]] will arrive as the final savior of mankind, and bring about the [[resurrection of the dead]]. The ''yazata''s [[Airyaman]] and [[Atar]] will melt the metal in the hills and mountains, which will flow as lava across the earth and all mankind, both the living and resurrected, will be required to wade through it. ''[[Ashavan]]'' will pass through the molten river as if it were warm milk, but the sinful will burn. It will then flow down to hell, where it will annihilate [[Angra Mainyu]] and the last vestiges of wickedness.

The righteous will partake of the ''parahaoma'', which will confer immortality upon them. Humanity will become like the [[Amesha Spenta]]s, living without food, hunger, thirst, weapons or injury. Bodies will become so light as to cast no shadow. All humanity will speak a single language, and belong to a single nation with no borders. All will share a single purpose and goal, joining with [[Ahura Mazda]] for a perpetual and divine exaltation.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Taylor|first=Richard P.|title=Death and Afterlife: A Cultural Encyclopedia|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2000|page=312}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Boyce"&gt;{{citation|last=Boyce|first=Mary|authorlink=Mary Boyce|title=Zoroastrians: Their Religious Beliefs and Practices|year=1979|location=London|publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul|isbn=978-0-415-23902-8|pages=27–29|url=https://books.google.com/?id=a6gbxVfjtUEC}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{history of Tibet}}
The '''Era of Fragmentation''' ({{Bo-textonly|སིལ་ཆད་དུ་འཆད་པ}}) is a period of [[history of Tibet|Tibetan history]] in the 9th and 10th century. During this era, the political centralization of the earlier [[Tibetan Empire]] collapsed following a civil war between [[Yumtän]] (''Yum brtan'') and [[Ösung]] (''’Od-srung'').&lt;ref&gt;Shakabpa. p.173.&lt;/ref&gt; The period was dominated by rebellions against the remnants of imperial Tibet and the rise of regional warlords.&lt;ref name="SchaikGalambos"&gt;Schaik, Galambos. p.4.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Civil war and the decline of imperial Tibet ==
{{Main|Tibetan Empire}}

The last emperor of the unified [[Tibetan Empire]], [[Langdarma]], was assassinated in 842-846, by either a Buddhist hermit or a monk named Pelgyi Dorje of Lhalung.&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith 1987, pp. 168-169&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="stein70-1"&gt;Stein 1972, pp. 70-71&lt;/ref&gt; The assassination left two possible heirs, Yumtän and Ösung, to fight for the throne, leading to a civil war. The successors of Osung controlled the region of [[Ngari Prefecture|Ngari]], while the successors of Yumtän controlled the [[Ü (region)|Ü]] region.&lt;ref name="shakabpa117"&gt;Shakabpa. p.177.&lt;/ref&gt; The son of Ösung was Pälkhortsän (''Dpal 'khor brtsan'') (865–895 or 893–923), who would sire two sons, Trashi Tsentsän (''Bkra shis brtsen brtsan'') and Thrikhyiding (''Khri khyi lding''), also called Kyide Nyigön (''Skyid lde nyi ma mgon'') in some sources. Thrikhyiding migrated to the western Tibetan region of [[Ngari Prefecture|upper Ngari]] (''Stod Mnga ris'') and married a woman of high central Tibetan nobility, with whom he founded a local dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;Petech, L. ''The Kingdom of Ladakh,'' (Serie Orientale Roma 51) Rome: Instituto Italiano per il Medio ed Estremo Oriente, 1977: 14-16&lt;/ref&gt;  This civil war weakened the political authority of the Tibetan monarchy,&lt;ref name="mckay57"&gt;Samten Karmay in McKay 2003, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; dissolving Tibet into separate tribes and small kingdoms.&lt;ref name="shakabpa117"/&gt;

==Revolts and warlords==
The dissolution of a centralized empire allowed Tibetan peasants, dissatisfied with the political turmoil, to rebel against regional governments. These uprisings split imperial Tibet into a multitude of separate, autonomous kingdoms, each ruled by a local warlord.&lt;ref name="shakabpa117"/&gt; The warlords constantly fought for political dominance, utilizing private armies and military fortresses.&lt;ref name="shakabpa117"/&gt; Between 842 and 1247, no central authority was in control of Tibet. The period ended with the [[Mongol conquest of Tibet]] and subsequent [[Tibet under Yuan rule|Yuan rule of Tibet]].

Traditional accounts of the period focus on religion. The Era of Fragmentation is depicted as a low point in the development of Tibetan Buddhism, with the Buddhist monastic order facing persecution and exile. Monastic Buddhism was alleged to have only persevered in [[Amdo]], then largely dominated by non-Tibetan peoples, and would not be conquered by a Tibetan polity until the 10th century.&lt;ref name="SchaikGalambos" /&gt;

According to this account, during the reign of [[Langdarma]], three monks fled to [[Mt. Dantig]] in [[Amdo]].  Their disciple Muzu Selbar ({{bo|w=mu zu gsal 'bar}}), later known as the scholar [[Gongpa Rapsel]] ({{bo|w=dgongs pa rab gsal}}, 953-1035&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=dgongs pa rab gsal |url = http://www.tbrc.org/#!rid=P1523 |website=Tibetan Buddhist Resource Center |publisher=Tibetan Buddhist Resource Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;), was responsible for the renewal of Buddhism in northeastern Tibet. The students of Rapsal are said to have returned to Ü-Tsang, where they re-introduced monastic Buddhism. Modern historians contest traditional views of the era, arguing that Buddhism was in fact widespread during the period, and that regional political authorities shared a close relationship with Buddhist monastic leaders.&lt;ref name="SchaikGalambos" /&gt;

The '''Festa do Peão de Barretos''' ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] for "Cowboy Festival of Barretos") is a [[rodeo]] featuring [[bull]]s and [[horse]]s. In Barretos, Brazil hundreds such festivals are held throughout the year.  The Festa do Peão is one of the most famous such festivals, and has become world-famous for its size. The festival is held every year in the [[São Paulo (state)]] city of [[Barretos]], where it has traditionally been organized and promoted by the social club ''Os Independentes'' ("The Independents").

==History==

The festival has its origins in the transfer of cattle from pasturing in the nearby states of [[Minas Gerais]], [[Goiás]], [[Mato Grosso do Sul]], and [[Mato Grosso]] to slaughterhouses in Barretos. The cowboys in the "entourages" that led the herds would meet in the afternoons and compete with each other to see who could ride the most spirited horses - the precursor to today's competition. The more difficult tradition of riding bulls instead of horses was brought from the United States.

In 1955, in [[Barretos]], a group of [[bachelor]]s organized the first recorded Festa do Peão de Boiadeiro. Since that time the festival has become world-famous for its scale, and the high quality of cowboys, horses, and bulls. The festival takes place every August, coinciding with the anniversary of the founding of Barretos, August 25. It continues to be organized by The Independents.

2005 was the 50th annual Festa. Until 1984, the festivities took place in Paulo de Lima park, in the center of Barretos, where memorable expositions of cattle took place during the 60s through the 80s. Since 1985 The Independents have held the event in a 110-hectare park with a [[stadium]] large enough to hold 35 thousand people, designed by renowned Brazilian [[architect]] [[Oscar Niemeyer]].

The '''Cans Festival''' ({{lang-gl|Festival de Cans}}) is an annual [[short film]] festival held in the [[parroquia|parish]] of Cans ([[O Porriño]], [[Spain]]) that coincides with the near-homophonous [[Cannes Film Festival]]. The festival is organized by the Arela Cultural Association and coordinated by the scriptwriter Alfonso Pato.

The festival takes over the whole village; Barns and basements change their normal uses to become cinema screens and the audience are ferried by locals to and from the screenings on two-wheel tractors, known locally as ''[[wiktionary:chimpín|chimpín]]s''. Other free activities are also available to the public: concerts, parades and hiking routes.

==Background==
The Cans Festival is celebrated every year in the parish of Cans ([[O Porriño]], Pontevedra Spain), which has an official population of 400 inhabitants although during the festival that number rises to more than 10,000 people. Its symbols of identity are the peculiar cinema rooms: sheds, basements, empty houses, wine cellars and even henhouses transferred altruistically by their owners who devote themselves to the festival and collaborate in everything they can. 

[[Short film]] is the genre par excellence in Cans, and every year the festival official section shows the best Galician productions of the season. But Cans is something else than a short film festival: it has documentaries and full length films premiers, a video clip contest, talks with prestigious filmmakers, presentations of experimental productions like web series, training programs for AV students, etc.

==History==
Cans Festival was born in 2004, as a kind of joke. The phonetic similarity between Cans (which also means dogs in Galician language) and [[Cannes]] was in the mind of some visionaries from a long time ago. In that year they decided to join forces and ideas and set in motion an event that would coincide in time with the glamorous [[Cote d'azur]] festival: Cannes. But that was a long time ago and from this funny word game a serious film festival emerged.

Nowadays, Cans Festival is in the epicenter of the worldwide filming earthquake that takes place in May, with or without the consent of its French half- brother Cannes. It has also red carpet and movie stars, but unlike Cannes, here actors, actresses, filmmakers or scriptwriters mix with a heterogeneous public who can easily address them.

Filmmakers, film directors, musicians, actors and actress like [[Isabel Coixet]], [[Juanma Bajo Ulloa]], [[Fernando León de Aranoa|Fernando León]], [[Manuel Martín Cuenca]], [[Patricia Ferreira]], [[Luis Tosar]], [[Tristán Ulloa]], [[Mabel Rivera]], [[María Pujalte]], [[José Sacristán]], [[Xoel López]], [[Kiko Veneno]], [[Iván Ferreiro]], [[Coque Malla]], [[Javier Krahe]], [[Manuel Rivas]], [[Lucía Echevarría]], [[Suso de Toro]], [[El Gran Wyoming]], [[Teté Delgado]], [[Antonio Durán "Morris"]], [[Julián Hernández (filmmaker)|Julián Hernández]] or [[Emma Suárez]] have been in Festival de Cans as guests, rewarded or speakers.

In 2009 it received the [[Premio da Crítica Galicia]], in the section of Cultural Initiatives. In 2011 Pontevedra Provincial Council gave the festival the [[Premio Provincial á Cultura]]  in the category of Innovation and Avant-garde. In 2013 it received the [[Premio Internacional Ateneo de Ourense]].

The '''Formula Volkswagen South Africa Championship''' is an [[Open-wheel car|open wheel racing]] series run by [[Volkswagen]] and based in South Africa. The cars are the fastest race series in the country.  The inaugural season was in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.driverdb.com/championships/Formula-Volkswagen-South-Africa/]&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous drivers to have competed in this series include [[Gavin Cronje]], Maxime Soulet, Wesleigh Orr, [[Cristiano Morgado]] and Simon Moss. Tasmin Pepper, a leading South African female driver has been a regular competitor in 2009 and 2010.

[[File:Droits de lHomme sinking.jpg|thumb|right|''View of the wreck of the French ship Le Droits D' Homme'', [[John Fairburn]]]]The '''Expédition d'Irlande''' was a [[Expédition d'Irlande|French attempt to invade Ireland]] in December 1796 during the [[French Revolutionary Wars]]. Encouraged by representatives of the [[Society of United Irishmen]], an [[Irish republicanism|Irish republican]] organisation, the [[French Directory]] decided that the best strategy for eliminating Britain from the war was to invade [[Ireland]], then under British control.&lt;ref name="DC181"&gt;Come, p. 181&lt;/ref&gt; It was hoped that a substantial invasion in the summer of 1796 would encourage a widespread uprising among the Irish population and force the British to abandon Ireland, providing a major strategic and propaganda coup for the [[First French Republic|French Republic]] and a staging point for a subsequent invasion of Britain.&lt;ref name="GR88"&gt;Regan, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; Assigned to lead the operation was General [[Lazare Hoche]], the Republic's most successful military commander, who was provided with a significant body of troops and the services of the entire French Atlantic fleet.&lt;ref name="WJ5"&gt;James, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[#notea|[A]]]&lt;/sup&gt;

Preparation for the invasion was slow throughout the autumn, and it was not until December that the force was ready to leave [[Brest, France|Brest]]. The delay was principally the result of poor organisation and discipline within the [[French Navy]], and preparations were only completed once the commander at Brest, Vice-amiral [[Louis Thomas Villaret de Joyeuse|Villaret de Joyeuse]], had been replaced with Vice-amiral [[Justin Bonaventure Morard de Galles|Morard de Galles]] and Hoche given direct command of discipline within the fleet.&lt;ref name="DC184"&gt;Come, p. 184&lt;/ref&gt; Departing Brest on 15 December, the French invasion fleet was almost immediately scattered: a combination of bad weather, inexperience at sea and the depredations of British frigates dispersing the force and destroying one [[ship of the line]].&lt;ref name="RW85"&gt;Woodman, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; As separate ships and small squadrons made their way independently to the rendezvous point off [[Mizen Head]], the flagship [[frigate]] [[French frigate Aglaé (1788)|''Fraternité'']] was chased deep into the Atlantic by a British frigate and took more than a week to return to Ireland. In that time the rest of the fleet, buffeted by the worst winter storms since 1708, broke up off the landing beaches in [[Bantry Bay]], the weather too fierce to allow any [[amphibious landings]].&lt;ref name="JH22"&gt;Henderson, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

By the last week of December 1796 the fleet was in full retreat, having failed to land a single soldier in Ireland.&lt;ref name="TP18"&gt;Pakenham, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Several ships were wrecked or foundered in heavy seas, and a British frigate squadron based at [[Cork (city)|Cork]] managed to seize a number of lone frigates and transports during the first two weeks of January.&lt;ref name="WLC304"&gt;Clowes, p. 304&lt;/ref&gt; The main British fleet, although ordered to intercept the invasion force, made little progress and did not arrive in the [[Western Approaches]] until 13 January, by which time all except three French ships had been accounted for.&lt;ref name="WJ10"&gt;James, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; Two, including the flagship ''Fraternité'', were chased by the British fleet, eventually reaching safety at [[Rochefort, Charente-Maritime|Rochefort]]. The third, the ship of the line [[French ship Droits de l'Homme (1794)|''Droits de l'Homme'']], was intercepted by two British frigates led by Captain [[Edward Pellew|Sir Edward Pellew]] and destroyed in [[Action of 13 January 1797|a running action]] that cost the lives of over 1,000 Frenchmen.&lt;ref name="WJ19"&gt;James, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

In total, French losses were 12 ships captured or destroyed and over 2,000 men drowned.&lt;ref name="WLC304"/&gt; The Brest fleet was so badly damaged by the operation that they launched no major operations during 1797 and were unable to respond when the British fleet was paralysed by the [[Spithead Mutiny]] a few months later.&lt;ref name="WLC305"&gt;Clowes, p. 305&lt;/ref&gt; A second French attempt to invade Ireland was launched in the summer of 1798, in response to the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|Irish Rebellion]], but this too ended in disaster: all of the men landed were captured a few weeks later at the [[Battle of Ballinamuck]]. A third and final invasion effort was defeated and destroyed by a British squadron at the [[Battle of Tory Island]] in October 1798.&lt;ref name="RG114"&gt;Gardiner, p. 114&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;li id="notea"&gt;'''[[#notea|^]]''' Sources vary on the exact number of French troops that eventually participated in the campaign.

'''Grigori Efimovich Rasputin''' is a fictional character, a [[supervillain]] in the [[comic book]] series ''[[Hellboy]]''. The character was created by [[Mike Mignola]] and [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]], and was based on the real life [[Grigori Rasputin|Russian mystic of the same name]]. Rasputin serves as the second archenemy of Hellboy after the Ogdru Jahad.

In 2009, Grigori Rasputin was ranked as [[IGN]]'s 83rd Greatest Comic Book Villain of All Time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/83.html Grigori Rasputin is number 83] [[IGN]]. Retrieved 10-05-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fictional biography==
In 1895, questioning his powers and purpose, Rasputin is visited by the witch [[Baba Yaga]] who told him that he is destined to father a new age. Rasputin then allowed Baba Yaga to take a fragment of his soul and hide it within the roots of [[Yggdrasil]] to become immortal. It was only after his assassination by Prince [[Felix Yusupov]] on December 16, 1916 that Rasputin is contacted by the Ogdru Jahad as he is revived. They enlisted him as their mortal agent in the world. Soon after, Rasputin was contacted by the [[Nazis]] to begin development on an occult method for ending the war. From this, Project Ragna Rok was born. The Nazis sought to use Rasputin to defeat the Allies, but Rasputin knew this would never happen. He merely intended to use the Nazis' resources as long as he could to achieve his own goals: to trigger the apocalypse which would jumpstart a new Eden.

===''Hellboy: Seed of Destruction''===
During [[World War II]], Rasputin conducted a ritual to summon the means to bring the Ogdru Jahad to Earth and permit them to raze the earth. But the summoning accidentally placed the creature to carry out the deed, later named [[Hellboy]], in the hands of the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]. Having already known that the war is lost and Hitler's eventual death, Rasputin tells those among Project Ragna Rok he sees as loyal to seek refuge in their base at Norway while he traveled to the [[Arctic Circle]] at the beckoning of Sadu-Hem, a monstrous spawn of the [[Ogdru Jahad]]. There, Rasputin entered a meditative state. Rasputin resurfaced in 1994 when awakened by an expedition group, using them to reach the Cavendish estate. Rasputin lured Hellboy to the manor have him free the Ogdru Jahad from their crystal prisons, deciding to siphon power from [[Liz Sherman]] to use Sadu-Hem to free its creator. But with the timely intervention of [[Abe Sapien]] impaling him while under the influence of the ghost of Elihu Cavendish, ends up Rasputin being reduced to a skeleton as Liz's flames incinerate Sadu-Hem. Though Rasputin attempts to convince Hellboy to spare him, he ends up being physically destroyed.

===''Hellboy: Wake the Devil''===
Rasputin re-appeared as a ghost while his revived pawns attempted to restore the [[vampire]] Vladimir Giurescu to life. Rasputin directed Ilsa Haupstein, a loyal member of Project Ragna Rok, to abandon her efforts to revive Giurescu and instead place herself within an enchanted [[iron maiden (torture device)|iron maiden]] under the notion that she would be infused into the relic so she can endure the Ogdru Jahad when they burn the world. Leaving Ilsa, unaware that she died spiritually and only become a vessel for the goddess [[Hecate]] after her previous physical form was destroyed by Hellboy, Rasputin targets Abe Sapien and prophecies that Abe will suffer the same death as he did. After the unintended destruction of Project Ragna Rok's base, Rasputin pays a visit to Baba Yaga at Yggdrasil. While offered to stay with her, Rapustin says that he'll go on and continue to try to make himself a god.

===''Hellboy: Conqueror Worm and Darkness Calls''===
Rasputin appeared lastly in his ghostly form as a counsel to Inger von Klempt. He persuaded her that she was to be the first of a final race of men, but she was executed by [[Lobster Johnson]] and the end of the world was averted with the destruction of the Conqueror Worm.  Afterward, Rasputin attempts to command Hecate into doing his bidding, and they begin bickering about the Apocalypse and Hellboy. Hecate then destroys Rasputin's ghostly form, with his remnants retreating to the roots of the Yggdrasil, where Baba Yaga gathered what remained of his soul and placed it in an [[acorn]]. Despite no longer having a presence in world events, Rasputin's prophecy for Abe comes to light in the [[Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense|BPRD]] side story ''Plague of Frogs'' through a [[doomsday cult]] led by an acolyte of the Orgdu Jahad named Humbert who became a host for a regenerated Sadu-Hem and fulfilled Abe's near death experience.

Later, as Hellboy is trying to fight his way out of the Baba Yaga's world, the witch puts as much of her power as she can into her slave [[Koschei the Deathless]] to kill Hellboy. As she runs out of her own power, she states she has one more try, and wants to use the spirit of Rasputin, (still in the acorn) to power Koschei. But her servant, Koku, throws the acorn away out of fear with the acorn holding Rasputin's soul falling through a crack in Yggdrasil that leads to Hell.

==In other media==

===Film===
[[Image:Rasputin2.JPG|thumb|right|150px|Grigori Rasputin as seen in the first ''Hellboy'' film]]
* Actor [[Karel Roden]] played Rasputin, the primary antagonist, in the 2004 [[Hellboy (2004 film)|film adaptation of ''Hellboy'']]. Rasputin's inability to die is explained to be the result of an otherworldly being residing in his body that the man considers a god, his "god" slowly manifesting within him through each resurrection. Rasputin is seen working with the Nazis in the film and demonstrated great occult abilities linked with the underworld. In the beginning of the film, he succeeds in opening a portal to the dimension of the [[Ogdru Jahad]], but the portal was sabotaged by the Allied Forces. After (unknowingly) letting Hellboy through, Rasputin was sucked into the portal before it vanished entirely. He was then resurrected by Ilsa and [[Karl Ruprecht Kroenen|Kroenen]] in an Arctic temple, the director's cut revealing that he was rendered eyeless before being provided with [[Ocular prosthesis]] after Hellboy's initial fight with Sammael. Needing to prepare for an upcoming eclipse that would allow him to bring the Ogdru Jahad, Rasputin orchestrates various events throughout the movie to have Hellboy realize his true calling in summoning the entities. But Hellboy rejects Rasputin and stabs him with one of his own severed horns, causing Rasputin's 'god' to emerge, crushing Rasputin and Ilsa in the process.
* in the sequel, ''[[Hellboy II: The Golden Army]]'', though director [[Guillermo Del Toro]] could not add it into the after-credits for budget reasons, set up an animated sequel that reveals Rasputin's ghost aiding Roderick Zinco to resurrect [[Kroenen]], telling Zinco he has one final mission to perform for him.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tilh0_WusTQ Zinco Epilogue]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Hats Off to Ice''''' was an ice show originally conceived by [[figure skating]] champion [[Sonja Henie]], G.S. Eyssell, and [[Arthur Wirtz]]. The show was presented at the [[Center Theatre (New York City)|Center Theatre]] in [[New York City]] and ran from 1944-1946 for a total of 889 performances. It became Henie's most popular show.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sonjahenie.net/revues.htm Ice Revues]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Musical ice shows==
As an ice theater, the Center Theatre's initial presentation was of Henie's production ''It Happens on Ice'', the first of the musical ice spectacles by Henie. More ice spectacles produced by Henie and Wirtz soon followed, including: ''[[Stars on Ice]]'', ''Hats Off to Ice'', ''Icetime'', and ''[[Howdy Mr. Ice]]''. 

By the end of the 1940s, the novelty of ice shows had waned, and the sensation had all but ended.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2790">'''Intentional harassment, alarm or distress''' is a [[statutory]] offence in [[England and Wales]]. It is an aggravated form of the offence of [[harassment, alarm or distress]] under section 5 of the [[Public Order Act 1986]].

==The offence==

The offence is created by section 4A of the [[Public Order Act 1986]], which was inserted by section 154 of the [[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994]]:

{{cquote|
:(1) A person is guilty of an offence if, with intent to cause a person harassment, alarm or distress, he:
::(a) uses threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour, or disorderly behaviour, or
::(b) displays any writing, sign or other visible representation which is threatening, abusive or insulting
:thereby causing that or another person harassment, alarm or distress.
:(2) An offence under this section may be committed in a public or a private place, except that no offence is committed where the words or behaviour are used, or the writing, sign or other visible representation is displayed, by a person inside a dwelling and the person who is harassed, alarmed or distressed is also inside that or another dwelling.
:(3) It is a defence for the accused to prove:
::(a) that he was inside a dwelling and had no reason to believe that the words or behaviour used, or the writing, sign or other visible representation displayed, would be heard or seen by a person outside that or any other dwelling, or
::(b) that his conduct was reasonable.}}

==Mode of trial and sentence==

This is a [[summary offence]]. It is punishable with [[imprisonment]] for a term not exceeding six months, or a fine not exceeding [[Standard scale#United Kingdom|level 5]] on the [[standard scale]], or both.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Public Order Act 1986]], section 4A(5)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrest==
Section 4A(4) of the 1986 Act formerly provided that a constable (or [[designated person]]) could arrest without warrant anyone he reasonably suspected was committing this offence. This was repealed by section 174 of, and Part 2 of Schedule 17 to, the [[Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005]].

==Racially or religiously aggravated offence==

Section 31(1)(b) of the [[Crime and Disorder Act 1998]] (c.37) creates the distinct offence of [[Crime and Disorder Act 1998#Racially or religiously aggravated offences|racially or religiously aggravated intentional harassment, alarm or distress]].

The '''Irving Place Theatre''' was located at the southwest corner of [[Lexington Avenue (Manhattan)|Irving Place]] and East [[15th Street (Manhattan)|15th Street]] in the [[Union Square (New York City)|Union Square]] neighborhood of [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]]. Built in 1888, it served as a German language theatre, a [[Yiddish theatre]], a [[burlesque]] house, a union meeting hall, a legitimate [[theatre]] and a movie theatre. It was demolished in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/11996|title=Cinema Treasures - Irving Place Theatre}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theater is the setting for the 2013 fictional play, ''[[The Nance]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/16/theater/reviews/the-nance-starring-nathan-lane-at-lyceum-theater.html | title = A Play’s Love Woes Cut Close to Home | work=[[The New York Times]] | publisher = [[The New York Times Company]] | date = March 28, 2013 | accessdate = 2014-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The original building on the site was '''Irving Hall''', which opened in 1860 as a venue for balls, lectures, and concerts. It was also for many years the base for one faction of the city's Democratic Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1916/06/18/99440560.pdf|title=Union Square Loses Its Old Residences|date=18 June 1916|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|accessdate=2009-06-14 | format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The facility was rebuilt, and opened as '''Amberg's German Theatre''' in 1888 under the management of Gustav Amberg, as a home for German-language theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Cambridge History of English and American Literature in 18 Volumes|editor=Ward &amp; Trent|publisher=G.P.

'''''Jelly's Last Jam''''' is a [[musical theatre|musical]] with a book by [[George C. Wolfe]], lyrics by [[Susan Birkenhead]], and music by [[Jelly Roll Morton]] and [[Luther Henderson]].  Based on the life and career of [[Ferdinand Joseph LaMothe]], known as Jelly Roll Morton and generally regarded as one of the primary driving forces behind the introduction of [[jazz]] to the [[United States|American]] public in the early 20th century, it also serves as a social commentary on the [[African-American]] experience during the era. LaMothe was born into a [[Louisiana Creole]] family that was established and free before the Civil War. 

==Plot==
The play opens with the recently deceased Morton in a state of limbo, looking back on his life.  He is reluctantly guided by the mysterious 'Chimney Man,' who forces him to recall the more painful moments of his life when he attempts to ignore or embellish them.  Born into an old and wealthy mixed-race [[Louisiana Creole people|Creole]] family in [[New Orleans]], the young Morton rebels against his upbringing by going into the streets and absorbing the rhythms of the vendors and poor blacks, meeting blues musician [[Buddy Bolden]].  When his Creole grandmother discovers his new lifestyle, she disowns him.  

Forced to go on the road, Morton becomes a prominent composer and musician, and the self-proclaimed creator of jazz.  His sadness over his family's rejection causes him to stress his Creole ancestry and claim that there are 'no black notes in my song.' Eventually his pride and racism cause him to betray his best friend and the woman he loves.  In his later years, as the Jazz culture continues to grow, Morton is largely forgotten and reduced to dealing with crooked music publishers and gangsters, eventually dying of a knife wound in the colored wing of a [[Los Angeles]] hospital.  At the moment of his death, Morton at last admits to his heritage - "Ain't no black notes in my song/I was wrong/ I was wrong."  At this moment, the shadows of the people in his life surround him to congratulate him, and Morton takes his place in history among the other Jazz legends.

==Production==
''Jelly's Last Jam'' premiered at the [[Mark Taper Forum]], Los Angeles, California, in March 1991. Directed by Wolfe, [[Obba Babatunde]] played Jelly Roll.&lt;ref&gt;De Vries, Hilary.

'''Johannes Gouws''' (13 August 1919 – 29 March 1944), was a fighter pilot from [[South Africa]] who was taken prisoner during the [[Second World War]]. Notable for his part in the 'Great Escape' from [[Stalag Luft III]] in March 1944 when he almost reached Switzerland but was one of the men recaptured and subsequently murdered by the ''[[Gestapo]]''.

==Pre-war life==
Gouws was born in [[Bultfontein]], [[South Africa]]&lt;ref&gt;Andrews (1976), p.205&lt;/ref&gt; the eldest son of an [[Afrikaans]] speaking farming family of Boer tradition. His boyhood ambition was to join the [[British South Africa Police]]. He was educated at the farm school and later [[Bultfontein]] High School where he was a keen athlete and captained the school [[rugby football]] team when it toured [[Cape Province]] in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;[[:af:Johannes Gouws|]][Biographical material - Johannes Gouws]{{Better source|date=November 2015|reason=[[WP:CIRCULAR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vance (2000), p.127&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from school that year and joined the [[Special Service Battalion]] a training unit for boys wishing to join the military. He applied for the [[South African Air Force]] but failed as his English language did not meet the required standard. Gouws returned to school, studied at University College of [[Orange Free State]] to study science and improved his language skills.&lt;ref&gt;Vance (2000), p.127&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ehf0ESmep-8C&amp;pg=PA158&amp;lpg=PA158&amp;dq=%22johannes+stephanus+gouws%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=WRDG0cd8LT&amp;sig=XiK-i7J6Hy7WdH2IOz4hBS3wMjM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwBjgKahUKEwj_5s6hgNHHAhXPjtsKHROFCJA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22johannes%20stephanus%20gouws%22&amp;f=false][A Gallant Company - early life of Johannes Gouws]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Service career==
Gouws was successful in his next attempt and joined the [[South African Air Force]] on 14 May 1940&lt;ref&gt;Read (2012), p.139&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vance (2000), p.128&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[:af:Johannes Gouws|]][Biographical material - Johannes Gouws]{{Better source|date=November 2015|reason=[[WP:CIRCULAR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a pilot candidate and service number 103275. After completing basic training he learned to fly in [[South Africa]] in [[de Havilland Tiger Moth]] aircraft. He received his [[aircrew brevet]] “wings” and commission as [[second lieutenant]] on 29 March 1941.  He was posted on 7 May 1941 to [[No. 41 Squadron SAAF]] flying [[Hawker Hartbees]] fighter bombers in [[Ethiopia|Abyssinia]].&lt;ref&gt;SAAF Private Bag Pretoria, Service record – 103275 Johannes Gouws]&lt;/ref&gt;  On a ground attack mission on 18 August 1941 his aircraft developed a fuel leak and he had to crash land in a ploughed field,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ehf0ESmep-8C&amp;pg=PA158&amp;lpg=PA158&amp;dq=%22johannes+stephanus+gouws%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=WRDG0cd8LT&amp;sig=XiK-i7J6Hy7WdH2IOz4hBS3wMjM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwBjgKahUKEwj_5s6hgNHHAhXPjtsKHROFCJA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22johannes%20stephanus%20gouws%22&amp;f=false][A Gallant Company - Johannes Gouws - 41 Squadron]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Read (2012), p.139&lt;/ref&gt; the aircraft flipped over and his crewman had to fight to free Gouws from the wreckage. The local farmer assisted them for a reward and they returned safely.&lt;ref&gt;Vance (2000), p.128&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:WAAF and RAF trainee ground crew work together on a Hawker Hart in Pretoria, South Africa.jpg|thumb|Hawker Hartbees]]
 
In September 1941 he was posted to [[No. 40 Squadron SAAF]]&lt;ref&gt;[[:af:Johannes Gouws|]][Biographical material - Johannes Gouws]{{Better source|date=November 2015|reason=[[WP:CIRCULAR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vance (2000), p.128&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;SAAF Private Bag Pretoria, Service record – 103275 Johannes Gouws]&lt;/ref&gt;    which was then back in [[South Africa]], the squadron's personnel were flown to Egypt to join the [[Desert Air Force]]. Until new aircraft arrived, the Squadron operated at Burg-el-Arab as an Advanced Maintenance Unit. In this period, six pilots were attached to [[No. 208 Squadron RAF]] for operational experience in modern monoplane fighters. The squadron became fully operational in March 1942, flying tactical reconnaissance missions and Photo Recce in support of [[British Eighth Army]].
The squadron's pilots soon learnt to operate in pairs and to stay out of range of small arms fire from the ground, to reduce heavy casualties; however, as [[Erwin Rommel]]'s [[Afrika Korps]] prepared to go on the offensive, [[Luftwaffe]] [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]] fighters concentrated on intercepting Tac.R aircraft. Casualties rose rapidly until HQ [[Desert Air Force]] ordered a fighter escort for all Tac.Rs.

==Prisoner of war==
One of the casualties was on 9 April 1942, a [[P-40 Tomahawk]] flown by [[Lieutenant]] Gouws on a mission over the Chichiba-Ezzeiat area was intercepted by two [[Bf 109]]’s and he was shot down&lt;ref&gt;Read (2012), p.139&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Luftwaffe]] [[flying ace]] [[Gustav Rödel]] of [[Jagdgeschwader 27]]. Gouws belly-landed his aircraft on fire south of Mteifel Chebir and was taken prisoner.&lt;ref&gt;Shores (1969), p.105&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vance (2000), p.129&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:AWM 010926 tomahawk.jpg|thumb|Armourers working on a P-40 Tomahawk in North Africa, 23 December 1941]]

=='Great Escape'==
For the Great Escape operation Gouws was one of the team dispersing the excavated sandy earth&lt;ref&gt;[[:af:Johannes Gouws|]][Biographical material - Johannes Gouws]{{Better source|date=November 2015|reason=[[WP:CIRCULAR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was scheduled for an early position in the queue of men&lt;ref&gt;Vance (2000), p.129&lt;/ref&gt;   to pass through the tunnel due to his active participation in the tunneling and fair command of the German language. Gouws was one of the first ten&lt;ref&gt;Andrews (1976), p.46&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vance (2000), p.220&lt;/ref&gt;   of the 76{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} men who escaped the prison camp on the night of 24–25 March 1944,{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} in the escape now famous as "[[Stalag Luft III|the Great Escape]]". When the Germans discovered the escape they began extensive well planned manhunts. 
The plan of Gouws and his British born South African partner [[Rupert Stevens]] was apparently to head for Switzerland&lt;ref&gt;[[:af:Johannes Gouws|]][Biographical material - Johannes Gouws]{{Better source|date=November 2015|reason=[[WP:CIRCULAR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; via Breslau&lt;ref&gt;Burgess (1990), p.248&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrews (1976), p.51&lt;/ref&gt; They missed the train which they had hoped to catch at [[Żagań|Sagan]] but travelled on a later train to [[Breslau]]&lt;ref&gt;Vance (2000), p.228&lt;/ref&gt;  and later towards Switzerland on to [[Lindau]] where they were recaptured on 29 March 1944&lt;ref&gt;Burgess (1990), p.271&lt;/ref&gt; near the [[Bodensee]] beside the border of neutral [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref&gt;Andrews (1976), p.51&lt;/ref&gt; on two different trains&lt;ref&gt;Read (2012), p.143&lt;/ref&gt;
The two South Africans were taken to [[Munich]] central [[Gestapo]] offices,&lt;ref&gt;Vance (2000), p.257&lt;/ref&gt; later that day they were apparently shot and cremated&lt;ref&gt;Andrews (1976), p.114-121 and p.196&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Read (2012), p.145 and 151&lt;/ref&gt;

He was one of the 50 escapers [[Stalag Luft III murders|executed and murdered]] by the ''Gestapo''.&lt;ref&gt;Read (2012), p.143&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrews (1976), p.205&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Burgess (1990), p.271&lt;/ref&gt; Originally cremated and buried at Sagan, he is now buried in part of the Poznan Old Garrison Cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cwgc.org/find-war-dead/casualty/2194269/GOUWS,%20J%20S][Commonwealth War Graves Commission casualty – Lieut. J S Gouws SAAF]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pegasusarchive.org/pow/cSL_3_Fifty.htm][Pegasus Archive - 50 murdered escapers]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[:af:Johannes Gouws|]][Biographical material - Johannes Gouws]{{Better source|date=November 2015|reason=[[WP:CIRCULAR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
His name is recorded on the official list published by the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rcaf-arc.forces.gc.ca/en/article-template-standard.page?doc=commemorating-the-great-escape/hvhsqy96][RCAF Website with list of the 50 murdered officers]&lt;/ref&gt;

His name was amongst the 47 murdered officers named in the British press when the story became public knowledge on or about 20 May 1944&lt;ref&gt;Western Morning News, Dundee Courier and Yorkshire Post, 20 May 1944&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/44291180/][Ottawa Journal, 20 May 1944, p.17 – listing murdered officers]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
His conspicuous bravery was recognized by a [[Mention in Despatches]] as none of the other relevant decorations then available could be awarded posthumously. It was published in a supplement to the [[London Gazette]] on 8 June 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=36544 | supp=y |date=2 June 1944 |pages=2645–2646 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;SAAF Private Bag Pretoria, Service record – 103275 Johannes Gouws]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other victims==
:''See [[Stalag Luft III murders]]''
The Gestapo executed a group of 50 of the recaptured prisoners representing almost all of the nationalities involved in the escape.

Post-war investigations saw a number of those guilty of the murders tracked down, arrested and tried for their crimes.&lt;ref&gt;Vance (2000), p.209-210&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrews (1976), p.217-220&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Read (2012), p.288&lt;/ref&gt;

As a product of the [[Cold War]] between the Soviet Union and the United States, [[Division of Korea|Korea had been split]] into two [[sovereign states]]. Both governments claimed to be the sole legitimate government of all of [[Korea]], and neither accepted the border as permanent. The conflict escalated into open warfare when North Korean forces—supported by the Soviet Union and China—moved into the south on 25 June 1950.&lt;ref name="Devine 2007 819-821" /&gt; The [[United Nations Security Council]] authorized the formation and dispatch of UN forces to Korea&lt;ref&gt;[[United Nations Security Council Resolution 83]]&lt;/ref&gt; to repel what was recognized as a North Korean invasion.&lt;ref&gt;[[United Nations Security Council Resolution 82]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Derek W. Bowett, United Nations Forces: A Legal Study of United Nations Practice, Stevens, London, 1964, pp. 29–60&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty-one countries of the United Nations eventually contributed to the UN force, with the United States providing around 90% of the military personnel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Korea: Where the American Century Began|first=Michael|last=Pembroke|publisher=Hardie Grant Books|date=2018|page=141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the first two months of war, South Korean and U.S. forces rapidly dispatched to Korea were on the point of defeat, forced back to a small area in the south known as the [[Battle of Pusan Perimeter|Pusan Perimeter]]. In September 1950, an amphibious UN counter-offensive was launched at [[Incheon]], and cut off many North Korean troops. Those who escaped envelopment and capture were forced back north. UN forces rapidly approached the [[Yalu River]]—the border with China—but in October 1950, mass Chinese forces crossed the Yalu and entered the war.&lt;ref name="Devine 2007 819-821" /&gt; The surprise Chinese intervention triggered a retreat of UN forces which continued until mid-1951.

In these reversals of fortune, [[Seoul]] changed hands four times, and the last two years of fighting became a [[attrition warfare|war of attrition]], with the front line close to the 38th parallel. The war in the air, however, was never a stalemate. North Korea was subject to a massive bombing campaign. [[Jet fighters]] confronted each other in [[air-to-air combat]] for the first time in history, and Soviet pilots covertly flew in defense of their communist allies.

The fighting ended on 27 July 1953, when an [[Korean Armistice Agreement|armistice]] was signed. The agreement created the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone]] to separate North and South Korea, and allowed the return of prisoners. However, no [[peace treaty]] was ever signed, and according to some sources the two Koreas are technically still at war, engaged in a [[frozen conflict]].&lt;ref name="HeFeng2013"&gt;{{cite book|last1=He |first1=Kai |last2=Feng |first2=Huiyun |title=Prospect Theory and Foreign Policy Analysis in the Asia Pacific: Rational Leaders and Risky Behavior |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iAaHqijyLy8C&amp;pg=PA50 |year=2013 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1135131197 |page=50 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170704225317/https://books.google.com/books?id=iAaHqijyLy8C&amp;pg=PA50 |archivedate=4 July 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LiCribb2014"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Li |first1=Narangoa |last2=Cribb |first2=Robert |title=Historical Atlas of Northeast Asia, 1590–2010: Korea, Manchuria, Mongolia, Eastern Siberia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zfMYBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA194 |year=2014 |publisher=Columbia University Press |isbn=978-0231160704 |page=194 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170704225317/https://books.google.com/books?id=zfMYBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA194 |archivedate=4 July 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2018, the leaders of North and South Korea met at the demilitarized zone&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kim becomes first North Korean leader to cross border into South since war|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-southkorea-summit-crossing/kim-becomes-first-north-korean-leader-to-cross-border-into-south-since-war-idUSKBN1HY01L|accessdate=28 April 2018|work=Reuters|date=27 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and agreed to sign a treaty by the end of the year to formally end the Korean War.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://edition.cnn.com/asia/live-news/north-korea-south-korea-summit-intl/index.html|title=North and South Korean leaders hold historic summit: Live updates|work=CNN|date=2018-04-26|access-date=2018-04-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a war undeclared by all participants, the conflict helped bring the term "[[police action]]" into common use. It also led to the permanent alteration of the balance of power within the United Nations, where [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 377|Resolution 377]]—passed in 1950 to allow a bypassing of the Security Council if that body could not reach an agreement—led to the General Assembly displacing the Security Council as the primary organ of the UN.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=World History of the Twentieth Century New Edition|last=Cornwell|first=RD|publisher=Longman House|year=1980|isbn=978-0582330757|location=London|pages=540}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In South Korea, the war is usually referred to as "[[Korean numerals#Numerals (Cardinal)|625]]" or the "6–2–5 Upheaval" ({{lang|ko|6.25 동란}} ({{lang|ko|動亂}}), ''yook-i-o dongnan''), reflecting the date of its commencement on 25 June.&lt;ref name="Hoare1999" /&gt;

In North Korea, the war is officially referred to as the "Fatherland Liberation War" (''Choguk haebang chǒnjaeng'') or alternatively the ''"[[Names of Korea#Korea|Chosǒn]] [''Korean''] War"'' ({{lang|ko|조선전쟁}}, ''Chosǒn chǒnjaeng'').&lt;ref name="Kim2003" /&gt;

In China, the war is officially called the "War to Resist America and Aid Korea" ({{zh | t = 抗美援朝戰爭| s = 抗美援朝战争| p = Kàngměi Yuáncháo Zhànzhēng}}),&lt;ref name="CRI2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Xinhua2000" /&gt; although the term "''[[Names of Korea#Chinese-speaking areas|Chaoxian]]'' (Korean) War" ({{zh&lt;!--  --&gt;|t=朝鮮戰爭|s=朝鲜战争|p= Cháoxiǎn Zhànzhēng}}) is also used in unofficial contexts, along with the term "''Han'' (Korean) War" ({{zh&lt;!--  --&gt;|t=韓戰|s=韩战|p= Hán Zhàn}}) more commonly used in regions such as Hong Kong and Macau.

In the U.S., the war was initially described by President [[Harry S.

==Background==

===Imperial Japanese rule (1910–1945)===
{{Main|Korea under Japanese rule}}
Imperial Japan destroyed the influence of [[Qing dynasty|China]] over Korea in the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] (1894–95), ushering in the short-lived [[Korean Empire]].{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p=}} A decade later, after defeating [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]] in the [[Russo-Japanese War]] (1904–05), Japan made Korea its [[protectorate]] with the [[Eulsa Treaty]] in 1905, then annexed it with the [[Japan–Korea Treaty of 1910|Japan–Korea Annexation Treaty]] in 1910.&lt;ref name="Schnabel1972" /&gt;

Many [[Korean nationalism|Korean nationalists]] fled the country. The [[Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea]] was founded in 1919 in [[Republic of China (1912–49)|Nationalist China]]. It failed to achieve international recognition, failed to unite nationalist groups, and had a fractious relationship with its U.S.-based founding president, [[Syngman Rhee]].{{sfn|Stueck|2002|pp=19–20}} From 1919 to 1925 and beyond, Korean [[communist]]s led internal and external warfare against the Japanese.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p=23}}{{sfn|Dear|Foot|1995|p=516}}

In China, the Nationalist [[National Revolutionary Army]] and the communist [[People's Liberation Army]] helped organize Korean refugees against the Japanese military, which had also occupied parts of China. The Nationalist-backed Koreans, led by [[Lee Beom-seok (prime minister)|Yi Pom-Sok]], fought in the [[Burma Campaign]] (December 1941 – August 1945). The communists, led by [[Kim Il-sung]] among others, fought the Japanese in Korea and Manchuria.{{sfn|Cumings|2005|pp=160–61, 195–96}}

At the [[Cairo Conference (1943)|Cairo Conference]] in November 1943, [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|China]], the United Kingdom, and the United States all decided that "in due course Korea shall become free and independent".&lt;ref name="Early1943"/&gt;

===Soviet–Japanese War (1945)===
{{Main|Soviet–Japanese War}}
At the [[Tehran Conference]] in November 1943 and the [[Yalta Conference]] in February 1945, the Soviet Union promised to join its [[Allies of World War II|allies]] in the [[Pacific War]] within three months of the [[Victory in Europe Day|victory in Europe]]. Accordingly, it declared war on Japan on 9 August 1945, three days after the USA dropped the bomb on Hiroshima.{{sfn|Dear|Foot|1995|p=516}}&lt;ref name="Whelan1991" /&gt; By 10 August, the [[Red Army]] had begun to occupy the northern part of the Korean Peninsula.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|pp=24, 25}}

On the night of 10 August in Washington, U.S. colonels [[Dean Rusk]] and [[Charles H. Bonesteel III]] were tasked with dividing the Korean Peninsula into Soviet and U.S. occupation zones and proposed the [[38th parallel north|38th parallel]]. This was incorporated into the U.S. [[General Order No. 1]] which responded to the [[Surrender of Japan|Japanese surrender]] on 15 August. Explaining the choice of the 38th parallel, Rusk observed, "even though it was further north than could be realistically reached by U.S. forces, in the event of Soviet disagreement&amp;nbsp;... we felt it important to include the capital of Korea in the area of responsibility of American troops". He noted that he was "faced with the scarcity of US forces immediately available, and time and space factors, which would make it difficult to reach very far north, before Soviet troops could enter the area".{{sfn|Goulden|1983|p=17}} As Rusk's comments indicate, the U.S. doubted whether the Soviet government would agree to this.&lt;ref name="McCullough1992" /&gt;{{sfn|Appleman|1998|p=}}&lt;ref name="McCune1946" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Grajdanzev1945" /&gt; Stalin, however, maintained his wartime policy of co-operation, and on 16 August the Red Army halted at the 38th parallel for three weeks to await the arrival of U.S. forces in the south.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|pp=24, 25}}

===Korea divided (1945–1949)===
{{See also|Division of Korea}}
On 8 September 1945, U.S. Lieutenant General [[John R. Hodge]] arrived in [[Incheon]] to accept the Japanese surrender south of the 38th parallel.{{sfn|Appleman|1998|p=}} Appointed as military governor, Hodge directly controlled South Korea as head of the [[United States Army Military Government in Korea]] (USAMGIK 1945–48).{{sfn|Halberstam|2007|p= 63}} He attempted to establish control by restoring Japanese colonial administrators to power, but in the face of Korean protests quickly reversed this decision.&lt;ref name="Hermes2002" /&gt; The USAMGIK refused to recognize the provisional government of the short-lived [[People's Republic of Korea]] (PRK) due to its suspected Communist sympathies.

In December 1945, Korea was administered by a U.S.-Soviet Union Joint Commission, as agreed at the [[Moscow Conference (1945)|Moscow Conference]], with the aim of granting independence after a five-year trusteeship.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|pp=25–26}}{{sfn|Becker|2005|p=53}} The idea was not popular among Koreans and riots broke out.&lt;ref name="Schnabel1972" /&gt; To contain them, the USAMGIK banned strikes on 8 December 1945 and outlawed the PRK Revolutionary Government and the PRK People's Committees on 12 December 1945.{{sfn|Jager|2013|pp=41–42}} Following further large-scale civilian unrest,{{sfn|Cumings|1981|loc=chapter 3, 4}} the USAMGIK declared [[martial law]].

Citing the inability of the Joint Commission to make progress, the U.S. government decided to hold an election under United Nations auspices with the aim of creating an independent Korea. The Soviet authorities and the Korean Communists refused to co-operate on the grounds it would not be fair, and many South Korean politicians boycotted it.{{sfn|Cumings|2005|p=211}}{{sfn|Jager|2013|p=47}} A [[South Korean general election, 1948|general election]] was held in the South on 10 May 1948.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p=26}}&lt;ref name="Time1946" /&gt; North Korea held [[North Korean parliamentary election, 1948|parliamentary elections]] three months later on 25 August.{{sfn|Malkasian|2001|p=13}}

The resultant South Korean government promulgated a national political constitution on 17 July 1948, and elected [[Syngman Rhee]] as president on 20 July 1948. The Republic of Korea (South Korea) was established on 15 August 1948. In the Soviet Korean Zone of Occupation, the Soviet Union established a communist government{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p=26}} led by Kim Il-sung.&lt;ref name="AMH" /&gt;

The Soviet Union withdrew as agreed from Korea in 1948, and U.S. troops withdrew in 1949.

===Chinese Civil War (1945–1949)===
{{Main|Chinese Civil War}}
With the end of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|war with Japan]], the Chinese Civil War resumed in earnest between the Communists and Nationalists. While the Communists were struggling for supremacy in [[Manchuria]], they were supported by the North Korean government with [[materiel|matériel]] and manpower.{{sfn|Chen|1994|p=110}} According to Chinese sources, the North Koreans donated 2,000 railway cars worth of supplies while thousands of Koreans served in the Chinese [[People's Liberation Army]] (PLA) during the war.{{sfn|Chen|1994|pp=110–11}} North Korea also provided the Chinese Communists in Manchuria with a safe refuge for non-combatants and communications with the rest of China.{{sfn|Chen|1994|p=110}}

The North Korean contributions to the Chinese Communist victory were not forgotten after the creation of the People's Republic of China in 1949. As a token of gratitude, between 50,000 and 70,000 Korean veterans that served in the PLA were sent back along with their weapons, and they later played a significant role in the initial invasion of South Korea.{{sfn|Chen|1994|p=110}} China promised to support the North Koreans in the event of a war against South Korea.{{sfn|Chen|1994|p=111}}

After the formation of the People's Republic of China in 1949, the Chinese government named the Western nations, led by the United States, as the biggest threat to its national security.{{sfn|Chen|1994|p=26}} Basing this judgment on China's [[century of humiliation]] beginning in the early 19th century,{{sfn|Chen|1994|p=22}} U.S. support for the Nationalists during the Chinese Civil War,{{sfn|Chen|1994|p=41}} and the ideological struggles between revolutionaries and reactionaries,{{sfn|Chen|1994|p=21}} the Chinese leadership believed that China would become a critical battleground in the United States' crusade against Communism.{{sfn|Chen|1994|p=19}} As a countermeasure and to elevate China's standing among the worldwide Communist movements, the Chinese leadership adopted a foreign policy that actively promoted Communist revolutions throughout territories on China's periphery.{{sfn|Chen|1994|pp=25–26, 93}}

===Prelude to war (1950)===
By 1949, South Korean forces had reduced the active number of communist guerrillas in the South from 5,000 to 1,000. However, Kim Il-sung believed that the guerrillas weakened the South Korean military and that a North Korean invasion would be welcomed by much of the South Korean population. Kim began seeking Stalin's support for an invasion in March 1949, traveling to Moscow to attempt to persuade him.{{sfn|Weathersby|2002|pp=3–4}}

Serious border clashes between South and North occurred on 4 August 1949, when thousands of North Korean troops attacked South Korean troops occupying territory north of the 38th parallel. The 2nd and 18th infantry regiments of ROKA repulsed initial attacks in Kuksa-bong (above the 38th parallel)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mapcarta.com/16197292|title=Kuksa-bong|website=Mapcarta|accessdate=11 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Ch'ungmu,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/rok/18in-rgt.htm|title=18th Infantry Regiment|first=John|last=Pike|website=www.globalsecurity.org|accessdate=11 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at the end of the clashes ROKA troops were "completely routed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.hr/books?id=lY5-7ZirsmgC&amp;v=snippet&amp;q=august+4+1949#v=snippet&amp;q=august+4+1949|title=The Korean War: A History|first=Bruce|last=Cumings|date=27 July 2010|publisher=Random House Publishing Group|accessdate=11 November 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stalin initially did not think the time was right for a war in Korea. Chinese Communist forces were still embroiled in the [[Chinese Civil War]], while U.S. forces remained stationed in South Korea.{{sfn|Weathersby|2002|p=3}} By spring 1950, he believed that the strategic situation had changed: Communist forces under [[Mao Zedong]] had secured final victory in China, U.S. forces had withdrawn from Korea, and the Soviets [[Soviet atomic bomb project|detonated their first nuclear bomb]], breaking the U.S. atomic monopoly. As the U.S. had not directly intervened to stop the communist victory in China, Stalin calculated that they would be even less willing to fight in Korea, which had much less strategic significance. The Soviets had also cracked the codes used by the U.S. to communicate with their embassy in Moscow, and reading these dispatches convinced Stalin that Korea did not have the importance to the US that would warrant a nuclear confrontation.{{sfn|Weathersby|2002|pp=9, 10}} Stalin began a more aggressive strategy in Asia based on these developments, including promising economic and military aid to China through the [[Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance|Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance]].{{sfn|Weathersby|2002|pp=11}}

In April 1950, Stalin gave Kim permission to invade the South under the condition that Mao would agree to send reinforcements if needed. Stalin made it clear that Soviet forces would not openly engage in combat, to avoid a direct war with the United States.{{sfn|Weathersby|2002|p=10}} Kim met with Mao in May 1950. Mao was concerned the U.S. would intervene but agreed to support the North Korean invasion. China desperately needed the economic and military aid promised by the Soviets.{{sfn|Barnouin|Yu|2006|pp=139–40}} However, Mao sent more ethnic Korean PLA veterans to Korea and promised to move an army closer to the Korean border.{{sfn|Weathersby|1993|p=29}} Once Mao's commitment was secured, preparations for war accelerated.{{sfn|Weathersby|2002|p=13}}&lt;ref&gt;Mark O'Neill, "Soviet Involvement in the Korean War: A New View from the Soviet-Era Archives", OAH Magazine of History, Spring 2000, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Soviet generals with extensive combat experience from the Second World War were sent to North Korea as the Soviet Advisory Group. These generals completed the plans for the attack by May.{{sfn|Weathersby|1993|pp=29–30}} The original plans called for a skirmish to be initiated in the [[Ongjin Peninsula]] on the west coast of Korea. The North Koreans would then launch a counterattack that would capture Seoul and encircle and destroy the South Korean army. The final stage would involve destroying South Korean government remnants and capturing the rest of South Korea, including the ports.{{sfn|Weathersby|2002|p=14}}

On 7 June 1950, Kim Il-sung called for a Korea-wide election on 5–8 August 1950 and a consultative conference in [[Haeju]] on 15–17 June 1950. On 11 June, the North sent three diplomats to the South as a peace overture that Rhee rejected outright.{{sfn|Weathersby|2002|p=10}} On 21 June, Kim Il-Sung revised his war plan to involve a general attack across the 38th parallel, rather than a limited operation in the Ongjin Peninsula. Kim was concerned that South Korean agents had learned about the plans and that South Korean forces were strengthening their defenses. Stalin agreed to this change of plan.{{sfn|Weathersby|2002|p=15}}

While these preparations were underway in the North, there were frequent clashes along the 38th parallel, especially at [[Kaesong]] and [[Ongjin County, South Hwanghae|Ongjin]], many initiated by the South.{{sfn|Cumings|2005|pp=247–53}}{{sfn|Stueck|2002|p=71}} The [[Republic of Korea Army]] (ROK Army) was being trained by the U.S. [[Korean Military Advisory Group]] (KMAG). On the eve of war, KMAG commander General William Lynn Roberts voiced utmost confidence in the ROK Army and boasted that any North Korean invasion would merely provide "target practice".{{sfn|Cumings|2005|pp=255–56}} For his part, [[Syngman Rhee]] repeatedly expressed his desire to conquer the North, including when U.S. diplomat [[John Foster Dulles]] visited Korea on 18 June.{{sfn|Cumings|2005|pp=249–58}}

Although some South Korean and U.S. intelligence officers predicted an attack from the North, similar predictions were made before and nothing happened.{{sfn|Millett|2007|p=17}} The [[Central Intelligence Agency]] noted the southward movement by the [[Korean People's Army]] (KPA), but assessed this as a "defensive measure" and concluded an invasion was "unlikely".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=CIA Files Show U.S. Blindsided By Korean War |author=Tom Gjelten |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=128092817 |newspaper=[[National Public Radio]] |date=25 June 2010 |accessdate=16 February 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130824155650/http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=128092817 |archivedate=24 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 June, UN observers inspected the border and did not detect that war was imminent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Seth|first=Michael J.|title=A history of Korea: From Antiquity to the Present | year = 2010 | publisher = Rowman &amp; Littlefield | location = Lanham, MD | isbn = 978-0742567160 | page = 324}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparison of forces===
Throughout 1949 and 1950, the Soviets continued arming North Korea. After the Communist victory in the Chinese Civil War, ethnic Korean units in the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) were released to North Korea.{{sfn|Millett|2007|p=14}} The combat veterans from China, the tanks, artillery and aircraft supplied by the Soviets, and rigorous training increased North Korea's military superiority over the South, armed by the US military with mostly [[small arms]], but no heavy weaponry such as tanks.{{sfn|Millett|2007|p=15}}

According to the first official census in 1949 the population of North Korea numbered 9,620,000,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=72lpTkNcJQ4C&amp;lpg=PA60&amp;pg=PA61#v=onepage |title=Policy and Economic Performance in Divided Korea During the Cold War Era: 1945–91|first=Nick|last=Eberstadt|date=27 September 2017|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|via=Google Books|isbn=9780844742748}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by mid-1950 North Korean forces numbered between 150,000 and 200,000 troops, organized into 10 infantry divisions, one tank division, and one air force division, with 210 fighter planes and 280 tanks, who captured scheduled objectives and territory, among them [[Kaesong]], [[Chuncheon]], [[Uijeongbu]], and [[Ongjin, South Hwanghae|Ongjin]]. Their forces included 274 [[T-34|T-34-85]] tanks, 200 artillery pieces, 110 attack bombers, and some 150 [[Yakovlev|Yak]] fighter planes, and 35 reconnaissance aircraft. In addition to the invasion force, the North KPA had 114 fighters, 78 bombers, 105 T-34-85 tanks, and some 30,000 soldiers stationed in reserve in North Korea.{{sfn|Appleman|1998|p=}} Although each navy consisted of only several small warships, the North and South Korean navies fought in the war as sea-borne artillery for their armies.

In contrast, the Republic of Korea population totaled 20,188,641,{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} and its army was unprepared and ill-equipped. &lt;!-- In ''South to the Naktong, North to the Yalu'' (1961), R. E. Appleman reports the ROK forces' low combat readiness --&gt; As of 25 June 1950 the ROK Army had 98,000 soldiers (65,000 combat, 33,000 support), no tanks (they had been requested from the U.S. military, but requests were denied), and a 22-piece air force comprising 12 [[Liaison aircraft|liaison-type]] and 10 [[T-6 Texan|AT6]] advanced-trainer airplanes. Large U.S. garrisons and air forces were in Japan,{{sfn|Appleman|1998|p={{page needed|date=April 2017}}}} but only 200–300 American troops were in Korea.&lt;ref name="james19500625"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.upi.com/Archives/1950/06/25/North-Koreans-invade-South-Korea/1012416555294/ |title=North Koreans invade South Korea |last=James |first=Jack |date=1950-06-25 |access-date=2017-07-29 |agency=United Press |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Course of the war==
[[File:South Korean refugees mid-1950.jpg|thumb|Hundreds of thousands of South Koreans fled south in mid-1950 after the North Korean army invaded.]]

At dawn on Sunday, 25 June 1950, the [[Korean People's Army]] crossed the 38th parallel behind artillery fire.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p=14}} The KPA justified its assault with the claim that ROK troops attacked first and that the KPA were aiming to arrest and execute the "bandit traitor Syngman Rhee".{{sfn|Appleman|1998|p=21}} [[Battle of Ongjin|Fighting]] began on the strategic [[Ongjin County, South Hwanghae|Ongjin Peninsula]] in the west.{{sfn|Cumings|2005|pp=260–63}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = The Making of Modern Korea | last = Buzo | first = Adrian | year = 2002| publisher = Routledge|  location = London | isbn = 978-0415237499 |p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were initial South Korean claims that they captured the city of [[Haeju]], and this sequence of events has led some scholars to argue that the South Koreans fired first.{{sfn|Cumings|2005|pp=260–63}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Korea since 1850 | last1 = Lone |  first1 = Stewart| last2 = McCormack | first2 = Gavan | authorlink2 = Gavan McCormack | publisher = Longman Cheshire | location = Melbourne | year = 1993 | pp=110–11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whoever fired the first shots in Ongjin, within an hour, North Korean forces attacked all along the 38th parallel. The North Koreans had a combined arms force including tanks supported by heavy artillery. The South Koreans had no tanks, anti-tank weapons or heavy artillery to stop such an attack. In addition, South Koreans committed their forces in a piecemeal fashion and these were routed in a few days.{{sfn|Millett|2007|pp=18–19}}

On 27 June, Rhee evacuated from [[Seoul]] with some of the government. On 28 June, at 2&amp;nbsp;am, the South Korean Army blew up the [[Hangang Bridge bombing|Hangang Bridge]] across the [[Han River (Korea)|Han River]] in an attempt to stop the North Korean army.

In five days, the South Korean forces, which had 95,000 men on 25 June, was down to less than 22,000 men. In early July, when U.S. forces arrived, what was left of the South Korean forces were placed under U.S. operational command of the [[United Nations Command]].&lt;ref name="Webb" /&gt;

===Factors in U.S. intervention===

The Truman administration was unprepared for the invasion. Korea was not included in the strategic Asian Defense Perimeter outlined by Secretary of State [[Dean Acheson]].{{sfn|Kim|1973|p=30}} Truman himself was at his home in [[Independence, Missouri]].&lt;ref name="upi19500624"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1950/06/24/Press-spokesman-doubts-President-Truman-yet-told-of-Korea-conflict/3625210094214/ |title=Press spokesman doubts President Truman yet told of Korea conflict |date=1950-06-24 |access-date=2017-07-29 |agency=UP |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Military strategists were more concerned with the security of Europe against the Soviet Union than East Asia. At the same time, the administration was worried that a war in Korea could quickly widen into another world war should the Chinese or Soviets decide to get involved.

While there was initial hesitance by some in the US government to get involved in the war, considerations about Japan played a part in the ultimate decision to engage on behalf of South Korea. Especially after the fall of China to the Communists, U.S. experts on East Asia saw Japan as the critical counterweight to the Soviet Union and China in the region. While there was no United States policy dealing with South Korea directly as a national interest, its proximity to Japan increased the importance of South Korea. Said Kim: "The recognition that the security of Japan required a non-hostile Korea led directly to President Truman's decision to intervene&amp;nbsp;... The essential point&amp;nbsp;... is that the American response to the North Korean attack stemmed from considerations of U.S. policy toward Japan."{{sfn|Kim|1973|p=46}}

Another major consideration was the possible Soviet reaction in the event that the U.S. intervened. The Truman administration was fearful that a war in Korea was a diversionary assault that would escalate to a general war in Europe once the United States committed in Korea. At the same time, "[t]here was no suggestion from anyone that the United Nations or the United States could back away from [the conflict]".{{sfn|Rees|1964|p=22}} Yugoslavia—a possible Soviet target because of the [[Tito–Stalin Split|Tito-Stalin Split]]—was vital to the defense of Italy and Greece, and the country was first on the list of the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]]'s post-North Korea invasion list of "chief danger spots".&lt;ref name="schindler19980224"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://20committee.com/2015/09/29/dodging-armageddon-the-third-world-war-that-almost-was-1950/ |title=Dodging Armageddon: The Third World War That Almost Was, 1950 |author=Schindler, John R. |journal=Cryptologic Quarterly |date=24 February 1998 |pages=85–95 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150930082157/http://20committee.com/2015/09/29/dodging-armageddon-the-third-world-war-that-almost-was-1950/ |archivedate=30 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Truman believed if aggression went unchecked, a chain reaction would be initiated that would marginalize the United Nations and encourage Communist aggression elsewhere. The UN Security Council approved the use of force to help the South Koreans, and the U.S. immediately began using what air and naval forces that were in the area to that end. The Truman administration still refrained from committing on the ground because some advisers believed the North Koreans could be stopped by air and naval power alone.{{sfn|Rees|1964|p=23}}

The Truman administration was still uncertain if the attack was a ploy by the Soviet Union or just a test of U.S. resolve. The decision to commit ground troops became viable when a communiqué was received on 27 June indicating the Soviet Union would not move against U.S. forces in Korea.{{sfn|Rees|1964|p=26}} The Truman administration now believed it could intervene in Korea without undermining its commitments elsewhere.

===United Nations Security Council Resolutions===
{{Further|List of United Nations Security Council resolutions concerning North Korea}}
On 25 June 1950, the [[United Nations Security Council]] unanimously condemned the North Korean invasion of the Republic of Korea, with [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 82|UN Security Council Resolution 82]]. The Soviet Union, a [[United Nations Security Council veto power|veto-wielding power]], had boycotted the Council meetings since January 1950, protesting that the Taiwanese "[[Taiwan|Republic of China]]" and not the mainland "People's Republic of China" [[China and the United Nations|held a permanent seat]] in the UN Security Council.{{sfn|Malkasian|2001|p=16}} After debating the matter, the Security Council, on 27 June 1950, published [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 83|Resolution 83]] recommending member states provide military assistance to the Republic of Korea. On 27 June [[Harry S. Truman|President Truman]] ordered U.S. air and sea forces to help the South Korean regime. On 4 July the Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister accused the United States of starting armed intervention on behalf of South Korea.&lt;ref name="Gromyko1950" /&gt;

The Soviet Union challenged the legitimacy of the war for several reasons. The ROK Army intelligence upon which Resolution 83 was based came from U.S. Intelligence; North Korea was not invited as a sitting temporary member of the UN, which violated UN Charter Article 32; and the fighting was beyond the UN Charter's scope, because the initial north-south border fighting was classed as a civil war. Because the Soviet Union was boycotting the Security Council at the time, legal scholars posited that deciding upon an action of this type required the unanimous vote of all the five permanent members including the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="Gross1951" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Schick1950" /&gt;

Within days of the invasion, masses of ROK Army soldiers—of dubious loyalty to the Syngman Rhee regime—were retreating southwards or [[Defection|defecting]] en masse to the northern side, the KPA.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p=23}}

===United Nations' response (July–August 1950)===
[[File:KumRiver Howitzer.jpg|thumb|alt=A group of soldiers readying a large gun in some brush|A U.S. howitzer position near the Kum River, 15 July]]

As soon as word of the attack was received,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.learner.org/workshops/primarysources/coldwar/docs/onkorea.html|title=Truman Address on Korea|website=www.learner.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. Secretary of State [[Dean Acheson]] informed President Truman that the North Koreans had invaded South Korea.{{sfn|Goulden|1983|p=48}}&lt;ref name="Hess2001" /&gt; Truman and Acheson discussed a U.S. invasion response and agreed that the United States was obligated to act, paralleling the North Korean invasion with [[Adolf Hitler]]'s aggressions in the 1930s, with the conclusion being that the mistake of appeasement must not be repeated.&lt;ref name="Graebner1979" /&gt; Several U.S. industries were mobilized to supply materials, labor, capital, production facilities, and other services necessary to support the military objectives of the Korean War.&lt;ref&gt;Reis, M. (12 May 2014), "[http://www.historyassociates.com/blog/historical-research-blog/industrial-mobilization-records-overview/ WWII and Korean War Industrial Mobilization: History Programs and Related Records]" ({{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715064838/http://www.historyassociates.com/blog/historical-research-blog/industrial-mobilization-records-overview/ |date=15 July 2014 }}), History Associates, retrieved 17 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; However, President Truman later acknowledged that he believed fighting the invasion was essential to the U.S. goal of the global [[containment]] of communism as outlined in the [[NSC 68|National Security Council Report 68 (NSC 68)]] (declassified in 1975):

{{quote|Communism was acting in Korea, just as Hitler, Mussolini and the Japanese had ten, fifteen, and twenty years earlier. I felt certain that if South Korea was allowed to fall, Communist leaders would be emboldened to override nations closer to our own shores. If the Communists were permitted to force their way into the Republic of Korea without opposition from the free world, no small nation would have the courage to resist threat and aggression by stronger Communist neighbors.&lt;ref name="Truman1980" /&gt;}}

In August 1950, the President and the Secretary of State obtained the consent of Congress to appropriate $12&amp;nbsp;billion for military action in Korea.&lt;ref name="Hess2001" /&gt;

Because of the extensive defense cuts and the emphasis placed on building a nuclear bomber force, none of the services were in a position to make a robust response with conventional military strength. General [[Omar Bradley]], Chairman of the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]], was faced with re-organizing and deploying a U.S. military force that was a shadow of its World War II counterpart.{{sfn|Blair|2003|p=290}}&lt;ref&gt;Hofmann, George F., "Tanks and the Korean War: A case study of unpreparedness", ''Armor'', Vol. 109 Issue 5 (Sep/Oct 2000), pp. 7–12: In 1948, the U.S. Army had to impose an 80 percent reduction in equipment requirements, deferring any equipment modernization. When the Joint Chiefs of Staff submitted a $30 billion total defense budget for FY 1948, the administration capped the DOD budget at the $14.4 billion set in 1947 and progressively reduced in succeeding fiscal years until January 1950, when it was reduced again to $13.5 billion.&lt;/ref&gt;

Acting on Secretary of State Acheson's recommendation, President Truman ordered General MacArthur to transfer matériel to the South Korean military while giving air cover to the evacuation of U.S. nationals. The President disagreed with advisers who recommended unilateral U.S. bombing of the North Korean forces, and ordered the [[United States Seventh Fleet|U.S. Seventh Fleet]] to protect the Republic of China (Taiwan), whose government asked to fight in Korea. The United States denied ROC's request for combat, lest it provoke a communist Chinese retaliation.{{sfn|Rees|1964 | page = 27}} Because the United States had sent the [[United States Seventh Fleet|Seventh Fleet]] to "neutralize" the [[Taiwan Strait]], Chinese premier [[Zhou Enlai]] criticized both the UN and U.S. initiatives as "armed aggression on Chinese territory".{{sfn|Barnouin|Yu|2006|p=140}}

===The drive south and Pusan (July–September 1950)===
[[File:KoreanWarFallenSoldier1.jpg|thumb|G.I. comforting a grieving infantryman]]

The [[Battle of Osan]], the first significant U.S. engagement of the Korean War, involved the 540-soldier Task Force Smith, which was a small forward element of the [[24th Infantry Division (United States)|24th Infantry Division]] which had been flown in from Japan.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p=45}} On 5 July 1950, Task Force Smith attacked the North Koreans at [[Osan]] but without weapons capable of destroying the North Koreans' tanks. They were unsuccessful; the result was 180 dead, wounded, or taken prisoner. The KPA progressed southwards, pushing back the U.S. force at [[Battle of Pyongtaek|Pyongtaek]], [[Battle of Chonan|Chonan]], and [[Battle of Chochiwon|Chochiwon]], forcing the 24th Division's retreat to [[Daejeon|Taejeon]], which the KPA captured in the [[Battle of Taejon]]; the 24th Division suffered 3,602 dead and wounded and 2,962 captured, including its commander, Major General [[William F. Dean]].{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p=48}}

By August, the KPA steadily pushed back the ROK Army and the [[Eighth United States Army]] southwards.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p=53}} The impact of the Truman administration's defense budget cutbacks were now keenly felt, as U.S. troops fought a series of costly rearguard actions. Lacking sufficient anti-tank weapons, artillery or armor, they were driven down the Korean Peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;Dunford, J.F. (Lt. Col.) ''The Strategic Implications of Defensive Operations at the Pusan Perimeter July–September 1950'', Carlisle, PA: U.S. Army War College (7 April 1999) pp. 6–8, 12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zabecki, David T., ''Stand or Die: 1950 Defense of Korea's Pusan Perimeter'', Military History (May 2009): The inability of U.S. forces to stop the 1950 North Korean summer offensive cost the Eighth Army 4,280 killed in action, 12,377 wounded, with 2,107 missing and 401 confirmed captured between 5 July and 16 September 1950. In addition the lives of tens of thousands of South Korean soldiers and civilians were lost as well.&lt;/ref&gt; During their advance, the KPA purged the Republic of Korea's intelligentsia by killing civil servants and intellectuals. On 20 August, General MacArthur warned North Korean leader Kim Il-sung he was responsible for the KPA's atrocities.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p= 56}} By September, UN forces were hemmed into a small corner of southeast Korea, near [[Busan|Pusan]]. This 140-mile perimeter enclosed about 10% of Korea, in a line partially defined by the [[Nakdong River]].

Although Kim's early successes led him to predict he would end the war by the end of August, Chinese leaders were more pessimistic. To counter a possible U.S. deployment, Zhou Enlai secured a Soviet commitment to have the Soviet Union support Chinese forces with air cover, and deployed 260,000 soldiers along the Korean border, under the command of [[Gao Gang]]. Zhou commanded Chai Chengwen to conduct a topographical survey of Korea, and directed Lei Yingfu, Zhou's military advisor in Korea, to analyze the military situation in Korea. Lei concluded that [[Douglas MacArthur|MacArthur]] would most likely attempt a landing at [[Incheon]].{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} After conferring with Mao that this would be MacArthur's most likely strategy, Zhou briefed Soviet and North Korean advisers of Lei's findings, and issued orders to Chinese army commanders deployed on the Korean border to prepare for U.S. naval activity in the [[Korea Strait]].{{sfn|Barnouin|Yu|2006|p=141}}

In the resulting [[Battle of Pusan Perimeter]] (August–September 1950), the U.S. Army withstood KPA attacks meant to capture the city at [[Battle of Naktong Bulge|the Naktong Bulge]], [[Battle of P'ohang-dong|P'ohang-dong]], and [[Battle of Taegu|Taegu]]. The [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) interrupted KPA logistics with 40 daily ground support [[sortie]]s that destroyed 32 bridges, halting most daytime road and rail traffic. KPA forces were forced to hide in tunnels by day and move only at night.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|pp=47–48, 66}} To deny matériel to the KPA, the USAF destroyed logistics depots, petroleum refineries, and harbors, while the U.S. Navy air forces attacked transport hubs. Consequently, the over-extended KPA could not be supplied throughout the south.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p=58}} On 27 August, [[67th Fighter Squadron]] aircraft mistakenly attacked facilities in Chinese territory and the Soviet Union called the UN Security Council's attention to China's complaint about the incident.&lt;ref&gt;[https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1950v07/pg_793 493rd meeting of the UN Security Council, 31 August 1950] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160302173851/https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1950v07/pg_793 |date=2 March 2016 }} ''[[United Nations Security Council]] Official Records'' No. 35, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. proposed that a commission of India and Sweden determine what the U.S. should pay in compensation but the Soviets vetoed the U.S. proposal.&lt;ref&gt;[https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1950v07/d551 Telegram, Dean Rusk to James Webb] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160302165211/https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1950v07/d551 |date=2 March 2016 }} ''[[Foreign Relations Series|Foreign Relations of the United States]]'' 1950 Volume VII, Korea, Document 551&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 1950 | title = work of the Security Council from August 1, 1950 to September 18, 1950 | journal = [[International Organization]]  | volume = 4 | issue = 4 | page = 638 | doi = 10.1017/S0020818300029465  | url = http://journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S0020818300029465 | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, U.S. garrisons in Japan continually dispatched soldiers and matériel to reinforce defenders in the Pusan Perimeter.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|pp=59–60}} Tank battalions deployed to Korea directly from the U.S. mainland from the [[port of San Francisco]] to the port of [[Pusan]], the largest Korean port. By late August, the Pusan Perimeter had some 500 medium tanks battle-ready.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p=61}} In early September 1950, ROK Army and UN Command forces outnumbered the KPA 180,000 to 100,000 soldiers.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p=}}{{sfn|Appleman|1998|p=61}}

===Battle of Inchon (September 1950)===
{{Main|Battle of Inchon}}

Against the rested and re-armed Pusan Perimeter defenders and their reinforcements, the KPA were undermanned and poorly supplied; unlike the UN Command, they lacked naval and air support.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|pp=58, 61}} To relieve the Pusan Perimeter, General MacArthur recommended an [[Amphibious warfare|amphibious landing]] at [[Incheon]], near Seoul and well over {{convert|100|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} behind the KPA lines.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p=67}} On 6 July, he ordered Major General [[Hobart R. Gay]], commander of the [[1st Cavalry Division (United States)|1st Cavalry Division]], to plan the division's amphibious landing at Incheon; on 12–14 July, the 1st Cavalry Division embarked from [[Yokohama]], Japan, to reinforce the 24th Infantry Division inside the Pusan Perimeter.&lt;ref name="Cavalry Outpost Publications" /&gt;

Soon after the war began, General MacArthur began planning a landing at Incheon, but [[the Pentagon]] opposed him.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p=67}} When authorized, he activated a combined U.S. Army and Marine Corps, and ROK Army force. The [[X Corps (United States)|X Corps]], led by Major General [[Edward Almond]], consisted of 40,000 men of the [[1st Marine Division (United States)|1st Marine Division]], the [[7th Infantry Division (United States)|7th Infantry Division]] and around 8,600 ROK Army soldiers.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p=68}} By 15 September, the amphibious assault force faced few KPA defenders at Incheon: military intelligence, [[psychological warfare]], [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] reconnaissance, and protracted bombardment facilitated a relatively light battle. However, the bombardment destroyed most of the city of Incheon.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p=70}}

After the Incheon landing, the 1st Cavalry Division began its northward advance from the Pusan Perimeter. "Task Force Lynch" (after Lieutenant Colonel James H. Lynch),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hoyt | first=Edwin P. |title=On to the Yalu | location=New York | publisher=Stein and Day |year=1984 | page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; 3rd Battalion, 7th Cavalry Regiment, and two 70th Tank Battalion units (Charlie Company and the Intelligence–Reconnaissance Platoon) effected the "Pusan Perimeter Breakout" through {{convert|106.4|mi|order=flip|abbr=on}} of enemy territory to join the 7th Infantry Division at Osan.&lt;ref name="Cavalry Outpost Publications" /&gt; The X Corps rapidly defeated the KPA defenders around Seoul, thus threatening to trap the main KPA force in Southern Korea.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|pp=71–72}} On 18 September, Stalin dispatched General [[Matvei Zakharov|H. M. Zakharov]] to Korea to advise Kim Il-sung to halt his offensive around the Pusan perimeter and to redeploy his forces to defend Seoul. Chinese commanders were not briefed on North Korean troop numbers or operational plans. As the overall commander of Chinese forces, Zhou Enlai suggested that the North Koreans should attempt to eliminate the enemy forces at Incheon only if they had reserves of at least 100,000 men; otherwise, he advised the North Koreans to withdraw their forces north.{{sfn|Barnouin|Yu|2006|p=143}}

On 25 September, Seoul was recaptured by South Korean forces. U.S. air raids caused heavy damage to the KPA, destroying most of its tanks and much of its artillery. North Korean troops in the south, instead of effectively withdrawing north, rapidly disintegrated, leaving Pyongyang vulnerable.{{sfn|Barnouin|Yu|2006|p=143}} During the general retreat only 25,000 to 30,000 North Korean soldiers managed to reach the KPA lines.&lt;ref name="Schnabel" /&gt;&lt;ref name="KIMH" /&gt; On 27 September, Stalin convened an emergency session of the Politburo, in which he condemned the incompetence of the KPA command and held Soviet military advisers responsible for the defeat.{{sfn|Barnouin|Yu|2006|p=143}}

===UN forces cross partition line (September–October 1950)===
{{Main|UN Offensive, 1950}}
On 27 September, MacArthur received the top secret National Security Council Memorandum 81/1 from Truman reminding him that operations north of the 38th parallel were authorized only if "at the time of such operation there was no entry into North Korea by major Soviet or Chinese Communist forces, no announcements of intended entry, nor a threat to counter our operations militarily".&lt;ref name="Weintraub2000" /&gt; On 29 September MacArthur restored the government of the Republic of Korea under Syngman Rhee.{{sfn|Barnouin|Yu|2006|p=143}} On 30 September, Defense Secretary [[George Marshall]] sent an [[eyes only|eyes-only]] message to MacArthur: "We want you to feel unhampered tactically and strategically to proceed north of the 38th parallel."&lt;ref name="Weintraub2000" /&gt; During October, the ROK police [[Goyang Geumjeong Cave Massacre|executed people]] who were suspected to be sympathetic to North Korea,&lt;ref name=Hankyoreh100209&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_national/403731.html |title=Goyang Geumjeong Cave Massacre memorial service |newspaper=[[Hankyoreh]] |date=9 February 2010 |accessdate=20 January 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120516121629/http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_national/403731.html |archivedate=16 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Namyangju Massacre|similar massacres]] were carried out until early 1951.&lt;ref name=SanDiegoUnionTribune20081206&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2008/dec/06/korea-mass-executions-120608/ |title=Children 'executed' in 1950 South Korean killings |agency=[[Associated Press]] |author1=Charles J.

[[File:Korean War, train attack.jpg|thumb|[[U.S. Air Force]] attacking railroads south of [[Wonsan]] on the eastern coast of North Korea]]

On 30 September, Zhou Enlai warned the United States that China was prepared to intervene in Korea if the United States crossed the 38th parallel. Zhou attempted to advise North Korean commanders on how to conduct a general withdrawal by using the same tactics that allowed Chinese communist forces to successfully escape Chiang Kai-shek's [[Encirclement Campaigns]] in the 1930s, but by some accounts North Korean commanders did not use these tactics effectively.{{sfn|Barnouin|Yu|2006|pp=143–44}} Historian [[Bruce Cumings]] argues, however, that the KPA's rapid withdrawal was strategic, with troops melting into the mountains from where they could launch guerrilla raids on the UN forces spread out on the coasts.{{sfn|Cumings|2005|pp=278–81}}

By 1 October 1950, the UN Command repelled the KPA northwards past the 38th parallel; the ROK Army crossed after them, into North Korea.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|pp=79–94}} MacArthur made a statement demanding the KPA's unconditional surrender.{{sfn|Barnouin|Yu|2006|p=144}} Six days later, on 7 October, with UN authorization, the UN Command forces followed the ROK forces northwards.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p=81}} The X Corps landed at [[Wonsan]] (in southeastern North Korea) and [[Riwon]] (in northeastern North Korea), already captured by ROK forces.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|pp=87–88}} The Eighth U.S. Army and the ROK Army drove up western Korea and [[Battle of Pyongyang (1950)|captured Pyongyang city]], the North Korean capital, on 19 October 1950.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p=90}} The [[187th Infantry Regiment (United States)|187th Airborne Regimental Combat Team]] made their first of two combat jumps during the Korean War on 20 October 1950 at [[Sunchon, North Korea|Sunchon]] and [[Sukchon]]. The missions of the 187th were to cut the road north going to China, preventing North Korean leaders from escaping from [[Pyongyang]]; and to rescue U.S. [[prisoners of war]]. At month's end, UN forces held 135,000 KPA prisoners of war. As they neared the Sino-Korean border, the UN forces in the west were divided from those in the east by 50–100 miles of mountainous terrain.{{sfn|Stueck|2002|pp=92–93}}

Taking advantage of the UN Command's strategic momentum against the communists, General MacArthur believed it necessary to extend the Korean War into China to destroy depots supplying the North Korean war effort. President Truman disagreed, and ordered caution at the Sino-Korean border.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p=83}}

===China intervenes (October–December 1950)===

On 20 August 1950, Premier [[Zhou Enlai]] informed the UN that "Korea is China's neighbor&amp;nbsp;... The Chinese people cannot but be concerned about a solution of the Korean question". Thus, through neutral-country diplomats, China warned that in safeguarding Chinese [[national security]], they would intervene against the UN Command in Korea.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p=83}} President Truman interpreted the communication as "a bald attempt to blackmail the UN", and dismissed it.&lt;ref name="Offner2002" /&gt;

On 1 October 1950, the day that UN troops crossed the 38th parallel, the Soviet ambassador forwarded a telegram from Stalin to Mao and Zhou requesting that China send five to six divisions into Korea, and Kim Il-sung sent frantic appeals to Mao for Chinese military intervention. At the same time, Stalin made it clear that Soviet forces themselves would not directly intervene.{{sfn|Barnouin|Yu|2006|p=144}}

In a series of emergency meetings that lasted from 2 to 5 October, Chinese leaders debated whether to send Chinese troops into Korea. There was considerable resistance among many leaders, including senior military leaders, to confronting the U.S. in Korea.{{sfn|Halberstam|2007|pp=355–56}} Mao strongly supported intervention, and Zhou was one of the few Chinese leaders who firmly supported him. After [[Lin Biao]] politely refused Mao's offer to command Chinese forces in Korea (citing his upcoming medical treatment),{{sfn|Halberstam|2007|p=355}} Mao decided that [[Peng Dehuai]] would be the commander of the Chinese forces in Korea after Peng agreed to support Mao's position.{{sfn|Halberstam|2007|p=355}} Mao then asked Peng to speak in favor of intervention to the rest of the Chinese leaders. After Peng made the case that if U.S. troops conquered Korea and reached the Yalu they might cross it and invade China the Politburo agreed to intervene in Korea.{{sfn|Halberstam|2007|p=359}} On 4 August 1950, with a planned invasion of Taiwan aborted due to the heavy U.S. naval presence, Mao reported to the Politburo that he would intervene in Korea when the People's Liberation Army's (PLA) Taiwan invasion force was reorganized into the PLA North East Frontier Force.&lt;ref name="AcademyC2000" /&gt; On 8 October 1950, Mao redesignated the PLA North East Frontier Force as the Chinese [[People's Volunteer Army]] (PVA).&lt;ref name="Academy2000" /&gt;

To enlist Stalin's support, Zhou and a Chinese delegation arrived in Moscow on 10 October, at which point they flew to Stalin's home at the Black Sea.{{sfn|Halberstam|2007|p=360}} There they conferred with the top Soviet leadership, which included Joseph Stalin as well as [[Vyacheslav Molotov]], [[Lavrentiy Beria]] and [[Georgi Malenkov]]. Stalin initially agreed to send military equipment and ammunition, but warned Zhou that the Soviet Union's air force would need two or three months to prepare any operations. In a subsequent meeting, Stalin told Zhou that he would only provide China with equipment on a credit basis, and that the Soviet air force would only operate over Chinese airspace, and only after an undisclosed period of time. Stalin did not agree to send either military equipment or air support until March 1951.{{sfn|Barnouin|Yu|2006|pp=146, 149}} Mao did not find Soviet air support especially useful, as the fighting was going to take place on the south side of the Yalu.{{sfn|Halberstam|2007|p=361}} Soviet shipments of matériel, when they did arrive, were limited to small quantities of trucks, grenades, machine guns, and the like.{{sfn|Cumings|2005|p=266}}

Immediately on his return to Beijing on 18 October 1950, Zhou met with Mao Zedong, [[Peng Dehuai]], and Gao Gang, and the group ordered two hundred thousand Chinese troops to enter North Korea, which they did on 25 October.{{sfn|Barnouin|Yu|2006|pp=147–48}} UN aerial reconnaissance had difficulty sighting PVA units in daytime, because their march and [[bivouac shelter|bivouac]] discipline minimized aerial detection.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p=102}} The PVA marched "dark-to-dark" (19:00–03:00), and aerial camouflage (concealing soldiers, pack animals, and equipment) was deployed by 05:30. Meanwhile, daylight advance parties scouted for the next bivouac site. During daylight activity or marching, soldiers were to remain motionless if an aircraft appeared, until it flew away;{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p=102}} PVA officers were under order to shoot security violators. Such battlefield discipline allowed a three-[[division (military)|division]] army to march the {{convert|286|mi|order=flip|abbr=on}} from [[Dandong|An-tung]], Manchuria, to the combat zone in some 19 days. Another division night-marched a circuitous mountain route, averaging {{convert|18|mi|order=flip|abbr=on}} daily for 18 days.{{sfn|Appleman|1998|p=}}

Meanwhile, on 15 October 1950, President Truman and General MacArthur met at [[Wake Island]] in the mid-Pacific Ocean. This meeting was much publicized because of the General's discourteous refusal to meet the President on the continental United States.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p=88}} To President Truman, MacArthur speculated there was little risk of Chinese intervention in Korea,{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p=89}} and that the PRC's opportunity for aiding the KPA had lapsed. He believed the PRC had some 300,000 soldiers in Manchuria, and some 100,000–125,000 soldiers at the Yalu River. He further concluded that, although half of those forces might cross south, "if the Chinese tried to get down to Pyongyang, there would be the greatest slaughter" without air force protection.&lt;ref name="Schnabel" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Donovan1996" /&gt;

After secretly crossing the Yalu River on 19 October, the PVA 13th Army Group launched the First Phase Offensive on 25 October, attacking the advancing UN forces near the Sino-Korean border. This military decision made solely by China changed the attitude of the Soviet Union. Twelve days after Chinese troops entered the war, Stalin allowed the Soviet Air Force to provide air cover, and supported more aid to China.&lt;ref&gt;Shen Zhihua, [https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/citedby/10.1080/01402391003590291 China and the Dispatch of the Soviet Air Force: The Formation of the Chinese-Soviet-Korean Alliance in the Early Stage of the Korean War], The Journal of Strategic Studies, vol. 33, no. 2, pp. 211–30&lt;/ref&gt; After inflicting heavy losses on the ROK [[II Corps (South Korea)|II Corps]] at the [[Battle of Onjong]], the first confrontation between Chinese and U.S. military occurred on 1 November 1950. Deep in North Korea, thousands of soldiers from the PVA 39th Army [[encirclement|encircled]] and attacked the U.S. [[8th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|8th Cavalry Regiment]] with three-prong assaults—from the north, northwest, and west—and overran the defensive position flanks in the [[Battle of Unsan]].&lt;ref name="Stewart" /&gt; The surprise assault resulted in the UN forces retreating back to the [[Ch'ongch'on River]], while the Chinese unexpectedly disappeared into mountain hideouts following victory. It is unclear why the Chinese did not press the attack and follow up their victory.

The UN Command, however, were unconvinced that the Chinese had openly intervened because of the sudden Chinese withdrawal. On 24 November, the [[Home-by-Christmas Offensive]] was launched with the U.S. Eighth Army advancing in northwest Korea, while the US X Corps attacked along the Korean east coast. But the PVA were waiting in ambush with their [[Second Phase Offensive (Korean War)|Second Phase Offensive]], which they executed at two sectors: in the East at the Chosin Reservoir and in the Western sector at Ch'ongch'on River.

After consulting with Stalin, on 13 November, Mao appointed Zhou Enlai the overall commander and coordinator of the war effort, with Peng as field commander.{{sfn|Barnouin|Yu|2006|pp=147–48}} On 25 November at the Korean western front, the PVA 13th Army Group attacked and overran the ROK II Corps at the [[Battle of the Ch'ongch'on River]], and then inflicted heavy losses on the US [[2nd Infantry Division (United States)|2nd Infantry Division]] on the UN forces' right flank.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|pp=98–99}} The UN Command retreated; the U.S. Eighth Army's retreat (the longest in US Army history)&lt;ref name="CohenGooch2006" /&gt; was made possible because of the [[Turkish Brigade]]'s successful, but very costly, rear-guard [[Battle of Wawon|delaying action near Kunuri]] that slowed the PVA attack for two days (27–29 November). By 30 November, the PVA 13th Army Group managed to expel the U.S. Eighth Army from northwest Korea. Retreating from the north faster than they had counter-invaded, the Eighth Army crossed the 38th parallel border in mid December.{{sfn|Mossman|1990|p=160}} UN morale hit rock bottom when Lieutenant General [[Walton Walker]], commander of the U.S. Eighth Army, was killed on 23 December 1950 in an automobile accident.

Concurrent with the [[Battle of the Ch'ongch'on River]] was the [[Battle of Chosin Reservoir]], which the PVA 9th Army Group initiated on 27 November. Here the UNC forces fared comparatively better: like the Eighth Army the surprise attack also forced X Corps to retreat from northeast Korea, but they were in the process able to breakout from the attempted encirclement by the PVA and execute a [[Battle of Chosin Reservoir#Aftermath#Outcome assessment|successful tactical withdrawal]]. X Corps managed to establish a defensive perimeter at the port city of [[Hungnam]] on 11 December and were able to evacuate by 24 December in order to reinforce the badly depleted U.S. Eighth Army to the south.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|pp=104–11}}{{sfn|Mossman|1990|p=158}} During the Hungnam evacuation, about 193 shiploads of UN Command forces and matériel (approximately 105,000 soldiers, 98,000 civilians, 17,500 vehicles, and 350,000 tons of supplies) were evacuated to Pusan.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p=110}} The [[SS Meredith Victory|SS ''Meredith Victory'']] was noted for evacuating 14,000 refugees, the largest rescue operation by a single ship, even though it was designed to hold 12 passengers.

China justified its entry into the war as a response to "American aggression in the guise of the UN".&lt;ref name="AcademyC2000" /&gt; Later, the Chinese claimed that U.S. bombers had violated PRC national airspace on three separate occasions and attacked Chinese targets before China intervened.&lt;ref name="Weng1966" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AcademyB2000" /&gt;

===Fighting around the 38th parallel (January–June 1951)===
With Lieutenant General [[Matthew Ridgway]] assuming the command of the U.S. Eighth Army on 26 December, the PVA and the KPA launched their Third Phase Offensive (also known as the "Chinese New Year's Offensive") on New Year's Eve of 1950/51. Utilizing night attacks in which UN Command fighting positions were encircled and then assaulted by numerically superior troops who had the element of surprise, the attacks were accompanied by loud trumpets and gongs, which fulfilled the double purpose of facilitating tactical communication and mentally disorienting the enemy. UN forces initially had no familiarity with this tactic, and as a result some soldiers panicked, abandoning their weapons and retreating to the south.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p=117}} The Chinese New Year's Offensive overwhelmed UN forces, allowing the PVA and KPA to [[Third Battle of Seoul|conquer Seoul]] for the second time on 4 January 1951.

[[File:Korean War bombing Wonsan.jpg|thumb|[[A-26 Invader|B-26 Invaders]] bomb logistics depots in Wonsan, North Korea, 1951]]

These setbacks prompted General MacArthur to consider using [[nuclear weapon]]s against the Chinese or North Korean interiors, with the intention that radioactive fallout zones would interrupt the Chinese supply chains.&lt;ref name="MacArthur" /&gt; However, upon the arrival of the charismatic General Ridgway, the ''esprit de corps'' of the bloodied Eighth Army immediately began to revive.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p=113}}

UN forces retreated to [[Suwon]] in the west, [[Wonju]] in the center, and the territory north of [[Samcheok]] in the east, where the battlefront stabilized and held.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p=117}} The PVA had outrun its logistics capability and thus were unable to press on beyond Seoul as food, ammunition, and matériel were carried nightly, on foot and bicycle, from the border at the Yalu River to the three battle lines.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p=118}} In late January, upon finding that the PVA had abandoned their battle lines, General Ridgway ordered a reconnaissance-in-force, which became ''[[Operation Roundup (1951)|Operation Roundup]]'' (5 February 1951).{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p=121}} A full-scale X Corps advance proceeded, which fully exploited the UN Command's air superiority,{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p=120}} concluding with the UN reaching the [[Han River (Korea)|Han River]] and recapturing [[Wonju]].{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p=121}}

Following the failure of ceasefire negotiations in January, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] passed [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 498|Resolution 498]] on 1 February, condemning PRC as an aggressor, and called upon its forces to withdraw from Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/5/ares5.htm |title=Resolution 498(V) Intervention of the Central People's Government of People's Republic of China in Korea |publisher=United Nations |date=1 February 1951 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525180549/http://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/5/ares5.htm |archivedate=25 May 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legacy.wilsoncenter.org/coldwarfiles/index-3262.html |title=Cold War International History Project's Cold War Files |publisher=Wilson Center |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130930121857/http://legacy.wilsoncenter.org/coldwarfiles/index-3262.html |archivedate=30 September 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In mid-February, the PVA counterattacked with the Fourth Phase Offensive and achieved initial victory at [[Hoengseong]].

[[File:U.S. Marines in the Korean War 003.jpg|thumb|left|upright|U.S. Marines move out over rugged mountain terrain while closing with North Korean forces.]]

In the last two weeks of February 1951, ''Operation Roundup'' was followed by ''[[Operation Killer]]'', carried out by the revitalized Eighth Army. It was a full-scale, battlefront-length attack staged for maximum exploitation of firepower to kill as many KPA and PVA troops as possible.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p=121}} ''Operation Killer'' concluded with [[I Corps (United States)|I Corps]] re-occupying the territory south of the Han River, and IX Corps capturing Hoengseong.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p=122}} On 7 March 1951, the Eighth Army attacked with ''[[Operation Ripper]]'', expelling the PVA and the KPA from Seoul on 14 March 1951. This was the fourth conquest of the city in a year's time, leaving it a ruin; the 1.5&amp;nbsp;million pre-war population was down to 200,000, and people were suffering from severe food shortages.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p=122}}&lt;ref name="KIMH" /&gt;

On 1 March 1951, Mao sent a cable to Stalin emphasizing the difficulties faced by Chinese forces and the need for air cover, especially over supply lines. Apparently impressed by the Chinese war effort, Stalin agreed to supply two air force divisions, three anti-aircraft divisions, and six thousand trucks. PVA troops in Korea continued to suffer severe logistical problems throughout the war. In late April Peng Dehuai sent his deputy, [[Hong Xuezhi]], to brief Zhou Enlai in Beijing. What Chinese soldiers feared, Hong said, was not the enemy, but having no food, bullets, or trucks to transport them to the rear when they were wounded. Zhou attempted to respond to the PVA's logistical concerns by increasing Chinese production and improving supply methods, but these efforts were never sufficient. At the same time, large-scale air defense training programs were carried out, and the [[People's Liberation Army Air Force|Chinese Air Force]] began participating in the war from September 1951 onward.{{sfn|Barnouin|Yu|2006|p=149}}

On 11 April 1951, Commander-in-Chief Truman [[President Truman's relief of General Douglas MacArthur|relieved the controversial General MacArthur]], the Supreme Commander in Korea.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|pp=123–27}} There were several reasons for the dismissal. MacArthur crossed the 38th parallel in the mistaken belief that the Chinese would not enter the war, leading to major allied losses. He believed that whether to use nuclear weapons should be his decision, not the president's.{{sfn|Stein|1994|p=69}} MacArthur threatened to destroy China unless it surrendered. While MacArthur felt total victory was the only honorable outcome, Truman was more pessimistic about his chances once involved in a land war in Asia, and felt a truce and orderly withdrawal from Korea could be a valid solution.{{sfn|Halberstam|2007|p= 600}} MacArthur was the subject of congressional hearings in May and June 1951, which determined that he had defied the orders of the president and thus had violated the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]].{{sfn|Stein|1994|p=79}} A popular criticism of MacArthur was that he never spent a night in Korea, and directed the war from the safety of Tokyo.{{sfn|Halberstam|2007|p= 498}}

[[File:Centurion tanks and infantry of the Gloucestershire Regiment advancing to attack Hill 327 in Korea, March 1951. BF454.jpg|thumb|British UN troops advance alongside a [[Centurion tank]], March 1951]]

MacArthur was relieved primarily due to his determination to expand the war into China, which other officials believed would needlessly escalate a limited war and consume too many already overstretched resources. Despite MacArthur's claims that he was restricted to fighting a limited war when China was fighting all-out, congressional testimony revealed China was using restraint as much as the U.S. was, as they were not using air power against front-line troops, communication lines, ports, naval air forces, or staging bases in Japan, which had been crucial to the survival of UN forces in Korea. Simply fighting on the peninsula had already tied down significant portions of U.S. airpower; as [[Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force|Air Force chief of staff]] [[Hoyt Vandenberg]] said, 80–85% the tactical capacity, one-fourth of the strategic portion, and 20% of air defense forces of the United States were engaged in a single country. There was also fear that crossing into China would provoke the Soviet Union into entering the war. General [[Omar Bradley]] testified that there were 35 Russian divisions totaling some 500,000 troops in the Far East, and if sent into action with the approximately 85 Russian submarines in the vicinity of Korea, they could overwhelm U.S. forces and cut supply lines, as well as potentially assist China in taking over territory in Southeast Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/redacted-testimony-fully-explains-why-general-macarthur-was-fired-180960622/|title=The Redacted Testimony That Fully Explains Why General MacArthur Was Fired|last1=Brands|first1=H.W. |date=28 September 2016 |website=[[Smithsonian (magazine)]] |publisher= |accessdate=25 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

General Ridgway was appointed Supreme Commander in Korea, and he regrouped the UN forces for successful counterattacks,{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p=127}} while General [[James Van Fleet]] assumed command of the U.S. Eighth Army.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p=130}} Further attacks slowly depleted the PVA and KPA forces; Operations ''[[Operation Courageous|Courageous]]'' (23–28 March 1951) and ''[[Operation Tomahawk|Tomahawk]]'' (23 March 1951) were a joint ground and airborne infilltration meant to trap Chinese forces between Kaesong and Seoul. UN forces advanced to "Line Kansas", north of the 38th parallel.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p=131}} The second of two combat jumps by the [[187th Infantry Regiment (United States)|187th Airborne Regimental Combat Team]] ("Rakkasans") was on Easter Sunday 1951, at [[Munsan-ni]], South Korea, codenamed [[Operation Tomahawk]]. The mission was to get behind Chinese forces and block their movement north. The 60th Indian Parachute Field Ambulance provided medical cover for the operations, dropping an ADS and a surgical team and treating over 400 battle casualties, apart from the civilian casualties that formed the core of their objective as the unit was on a humanitarian mission.

The Chinese counterattacked in April 1951, with the Fifth Phase Offensive, also known as the [[Chinese Spring Offensive]], with three field armies (approximately 700,000 men).{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p=131–32}} The first thrust of the offensive fell upon I Corps, which fiercely resisted in the [[Battle of the Imjin River]] (22–25 April 1951) and the [[Battle of Kapyong]] (22–25 April 1951), blunting the impetus of the offensive, which was halted at the "No-name Line" north of Seoul.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|pp=133–34}} On 15 May 1951, the Chinese commenced the second impulse of the Spring Offensive and attacked the ROK Army and the U.S. X Corps in the east at the [[Soyang River]]. After initial success, they were halted by 20 May.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|pp=136–37}} At month's end, the U.S. Eighth Army counterattacked and regained "Line Kansas", just north of the 38th parallel.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|pp=137–38}} The UN's "Line Kansas" halt and subsequent offensive action stand-down began the stalemate that lasted until the armistice of 1953.

===Stalemate (July 1951 – July 1953)===
For the remainder of the Korean War the UN Command and the PVA fought but exchanged little territory, as the stalemate held. Large-scale bombing of North Korea continued, and protracted armistice negotiations began 10 July 1951 at Kaesong.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|pp=145, 175–77}} On the Chinese side, Zhou Enlai directed peace talks, and [[Li Kenong]] and Qiao Guanghua headed the negotiation team.{{sfn|Barnouin|Yu|2006|p=149}} Combat continued while the belligerents negotiated; the goal of the UN Command forces was to recapture all of South Korea and to avoid losing territory.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p=159}} The PVA and the KPA attempted similar operations, and later effected military and psychological operations in order to test the UN Command's resolve to continue the war.

[[File:M46 tiger paint.png|thumb|upright=1.3|left|U.S. [[M46 Patton]] tanks, painted with tiger heads thought to demoralize Chinese forces]]

The principal battles of the stalemate include the [[Battle of Bloody Ridge]] (18 August–15 September 1951),{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p=160}} the [[Battle of the Punchbowl]] (31 August-21 September 1951), the [[Battle of Heartbreak Ridge]] (13 September–15 October 1951),{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p=161–62}} the [[Battle of Old Baldy]] (26 June–4 August 1952), the [[Battle of White Horse]] (6–15 October 1952), the [[Battle of Triangle Hill]] (14 October–25 November 1952), the [[Battle of Hill Eerie]] (21 March–21 June 1952), the sieges of [[Outpost Harry]] (10–18 June 1953), the [[Battle of the Hook]] (28–29 May 1953), the [[Battle of Pork Chop Hill]] (23 March–16 July 1953), and the [[Battle of Kumsong]] (13–27 July 1953).

Chinese troops suffered from deficient military equipment, serious logistical problems, overextended communication and supply lines, and the constant threat of UN bombers. All of these factors generally led to a rate of Chinese casualties that was far greater than the casualties suffered by UN troops. The situation became so serious that, in November 1951, Zhou Enlai called a conference in [[Shenyang]] to discuss the PVA's logistical problems. At the meeting it was decided to accelerate the construction of railways and airfields in the area, to increase the number of trucks available to the army, and to improve air defense by any means possible. These commitments did little to directly address the problems confronting PVA troops.{{sfn|Barnouin|Yu|2006|p=148}}

[[File:02 Dad in action april1952 Korea sepia.jpg|thumb|New Zealand artillery crew in action, 1952]]

In the months after the Shenyang conference Peng Dehuai went to Beijing several times to brief Mao and Zhou about the heavy casualties suffered by Chinese troops and the increasing difficulty of keeping the front lines supplied with basic necessities. Peng was convinced that the war would be protracted, and that neither side would be able to achieve victory in the near future. On 24 February 1952, the [[Central Military Commission (People's Republic of China)|Military Commission]], presided over by Zhou, discussed the PVA's logistical problems with members of various government agencies involved in the war effort. After the government representatives emphasized their inability to meet the demands of the war, Peng, in an angry outburst, shouted: "You have this and that problem... You should go to the front and see with your own eyes what food and clothing the soldiers have! Not to speak of the casualties! For what are they giving their lives? We have no aircraft. We have only a few guns. Transports are not protected. More and more soldiers are dying of starvation. Can't you overcome some of your difficulties?" The atmosphere became so tense that Zhou was forced to adjourn the conference. Zhou subsequently called a series of meetings, where it was agreed that the PVA would be divided into three groups, to be dispatched to Korea in shifts; to accelerate the training of Chinese pilots; to provide more anti-aircraft guns to the front lines; to purchase more military equipment and ammunition from the Soviet Union; to provide the army with more food and clothing; and, to transfer the responsibility of logistics to the central government.{{sfn|Barnouin|Yu|2006|pp=148–49}}

[[File:C Coy 2 RAR soldiers on The Hook Jun 1953 (AWM 157648).png|thumb|left|Men from the [[Royal Australian Regiment]], June 1953]]
The on-again, off-again armistice negotiations continued for two years,{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|pp=144–53}} first at [[Kaesong]], on the border between North and South Korea, and then at the neighboring village of [[Panmunjom]].{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p=147}} A major, problematic negotiation point was [[prisoner of war]] (POW) repatriation.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|pp=187–99}} The PVA, KPA, and UN Command could not agree on a system of repatriation because many PVA and KPA soldiers refused to be repatriated back to the north,&lt;ref name="Boose2000" /&gt; which was unacceptable to the Chinese and North Koreans.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|pp=189–90}} In the final armistice agreement, signed on 27 July 1953, a [[Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission]], under the chairman Indian General [[K. S. Thimayya]], was set up to handle the matter.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|pp=242–45}}

In 1952, the United States elected a new president, and on 29 November 1952, the president-elect, [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], went to Korea to learn what might end the Korean War.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p=240}} With the United Nations' acceptance of India's proposed Korean War [[armistice]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harrison (Lt.

Upon agreeing to the armistice, the belligerents established the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone]] (DMZ), which has since been [[Patrol#Military|patrolled]] by the KPA and ROKA, United States, and Joint UN Commands.

The Demilitarized Zone runs northeast of the 38th parallel; to the south, it travels west. The old Korean capital city of Kaesong, site of the armistice negotiations, originally was in pre-war South Korea, but now is part of North Korea. The United Nations Command, supported by the United States, the North Korean People's Army, and the Chinese People's Volunteers, signed the [[Korean Armistice Agreement|Armistice Agreement]] on 27 July 1953 to end the fighting. The Armistice also called upon the governments of South Korea, North Korea, China and the United States to participate in continued peace talks. The war is considered to have ended at this point, even though there was no [[peace treaty]].&lt;ref name="fas.org" /&gt; North Korea nevertheless claims that it won the Korean War.&lt;ref name="Ho1993" /&gt;&lt;ref name="KCNA2011" /&gt;

After the war, [[Operation Glory]] was conducted from July to November 1954, to allow combatant countries to exchange their dead. The remains of 4,167 U.S. Army and U.S. Marine Corps dead were exchanged for 13,528 KPA and PVA dead, and 546 civilians dead in UN prisoner-of-war camps were delivered to the South Korean government.&lt;ref name="OperationGlory" /&gt; After Operation Glory, 416 Korean War unknown soldiers were buried in the [[National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific]] (The Punchbowl), on the island of [[Oahu]], Hawaii. [[Defense Prisoner of War/Missing Personnel Office]] (DPMO) records indicate that the PRC and the DPRK transmitted 1,394 names, of which 858 were correct. From 4,167 containers of returned remains, forensic examination identified 4,219 individuals. Of these, 2,944 were identified as from the U.S., and all but 416 were identified by name.&lt;ref name="DPMO" /&gt; From 1996 to 2006, the DPRK recovered 220 remains near the Sino-Korean border.&lt;ref name="Army Times" /&gt;

The [[Korean Armistice Agreement]] provided for monitoring by an international commission.

In April 1975, [[South Vietnam]]'s capital was [[Fall of Saigon|captured]] by the [[People's Army of Vietnam|North Vietnamese army]]. Encouraged by the success of Communist revolution in Indochina, Kim Il-sung saw it as an opportunity to invade the South. Kim visited China in April of that year, and met with [[Mao Zedong]] and [[Zhou Enlai]] to ask for military aid. Despite Pyongyang's expectations, however, Beijing refused to help North Korea for another war in Korea.&lt;ref name="KimIlsung1975"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wilsoncenter.org/publication/nkidp-e-dossier-no-7-east-german-documents-kim-il-sung%E2%80%99s-april-1975-trip-to-beijing#_ftn2 |title=NKIDP e-Dossier No. 7: East German Documents on Kim Il Sung's April 1975 Trip to Beijing |author=Ria Chae |date=May 2012 |publisher=Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars |series=North Korea International Documentation Project |accessdate=30 May 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104124051/http://www.wilsoncenter.org/publication/nkidp-e-dossier-no-7-east-german-documents-kim-il-sung%E2%80%99s-april-1975-trip-to-beijing |archivedate=4 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the armistice, there have been numerous incursions and acts of aggression by North Korea. In 1976, the [[axe murder incident]] was widely publicized. Since 1974, [[North Korean tunnels|four incursion tunnels]] leading to [[Seoul]] have been uncovered. In 2010, a North Korean submarine torpedoed and sank the South Korean [[corvette]] [[ROKS Cheonan (PCC-772)|ROKS ''Cheonan'']], resulting in the deaths of 46 sailors.&lt;ref name="BBC2010" /&gt; Again in 2010, North Korea [[Bombardment of Yeonpyeong|fired artillery shells on Yeonpyeong]] island, killing two military personnel and two civilians.&lt;ref name="Reuters2010" /&gt;

In 2016, it was revealed that North Korea approached the United States about conducting formal peace talks to formally end the war. While the White House agreed to secret peace talks, the plan was rejected due to North Korea's refusal to discuss nuclear disarmament as part of the terms of the treaty.&lt;ref name="CassellaChiacu"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cassella |first1=Megan |last2=Chiacu |first2=Doina |title=U.S. rejected North Korea peace talks offer before last nuclear test: State Department |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-nuclear-idUSKCN0VU0XE |accessdate=22 February 2016 |work=[[Reuters]] |date=21 February 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160222022637/http://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-nuclear-idUSKCN0VU0XE |archivedate=22 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===U.S. unpreparedness for war===
In a postwar analysis of the unpreparedness of U.S. Army forces deployed to Korea during the summer and fall of 1950, Army Major General [[Floyd L. Parks]] stated that "Many who never lived to tell the tale had to fight the full range of ground warfare from offensive to delaying action, unit by unit, man by man ... [T]hat we were able to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat ... does not relieve us from the blame of having placed our own flesh and blood in such a predicament."&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Adrian R., ''The American culture of war'', New York: Taylor &amp; Francis Group, {{ISBN|978-0415979757}} (2007), p. 82&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1950, U.S. Secretary of Defense [[Louis A. Johnson]] had established a policy of faithfully following President Truman's defense economization plans, and had aggressively attempted to implement it even in the face of steadily increasing external threats. He consequently received much of the blame for the initial setbacks in Korea and the widespread reports of ill-equipped and inadequately trained U.S. military forces in the war's early stages.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Forgotten War: America in Korea, 1950–1953|last=Blair|first=Clay|publisher=Naval Institute Press|year=2003|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an initial response to the invasion, Truman called for a naval blockade of North Korea, and was shocked to learn that such a blockade could be imposed only "on paper", since the U.S. Navy no longer had the warships with which to carry out his request.{{sfn|Blair|2003|p=}}&lt;ref name="blockade"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trumanlibrary.org/whistlestop/study_collections/korea/large/week2/kw_78_1.jpg|title=Memorandum of Information for the Secretary&amp;nbsp;– Blockade of Korea|date=6 July 1950|publisher=Truman Presidential Library&amp;nbsp;– Archives|accessdate=28 July 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070809213846/http://www.trumanlibrary.org/whistlestop/study_collections/korea/large/week2/kw_78_1.jpg|archivedate=9 August 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Army officials, desperate for weaponry, recovered [[Sherman tank]]s from World War II Pacific battlefields and reconditioned them for shipment to Korea.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Army Ordnance officials at Fort Knox pulled down [[M26 Pershing]] tanks from display pedestals around Fort Knox in order to equip the third company of the Army's hastily formed [[70th Tank Battalion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Armor Debacle in Korea, 1950: Implications For Today|last=Connor|first=Arthur W.|publisher=U.S. Army War College|year=1992|isbn=|location=|pages=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without adequate numbers of tactical fighter-bomber aircraft, the Air Force took [[P-51 Mustang|F-51 (P-51)]] propeller-driven aircraft out of storage or from existing [[Air National Guard]] squadrons, and rushed them into front-line service. A shortage of spare parts and qualified maintenance personnel resulted in improvised repairs and overhauls. A Navy helicopter pilot aboard an active duty warship recalled fixing damaged rotor blades with masking tape in the absence of spares.&lt;ref&gt;Close, Robert A. (Cmdr), [https://www.usna.com/SSLPage.aspx?pid=656 ''Helo Operations''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120214182049/https://www.usna.com/SSLPage.aspx?pid=656 |date=14 February 2012 }}, Class of '45, U.S. Naval Academy Alumni Association &amp; Foundation: "There were insufficient spare sets of blades for all ships having helos.

Army Reserve and Army National Guard infantry soldiers and new inductees (called to duty to fill out understrength infantry divisions) found themselves short of nearly everything needed to repel the North Korean forces: artillery, ammunition, heavy tanks, ground-support aircraft, even effective anti-tank weapons such as the M20 3.5-inch (89&amp;nbsp;mm) [[Bazooka#Rocket Launcher, M20 "Super Bazooka"|Super Bazooka]].&lt;ref&gt;Blair, Clay, ''The Forgotten War: America in Korea, 1950–1953'', Naval Institute Press (2003), p. 50: The planned introduction into service of the M20, an antitank weapon urgently required to defeat the thick cast armor of Soviet tanks being supplied to the North Koreans, had been cancelled due to budget cuts.&lt;/ref&gt; Some Army combat units sent to Korea were supplied with worn out, 'red-lined' M-1 rifles or carbines in immediate need of ordnance depot overhaul or repair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher=Korean War Educator | year=1999-2000 | title=Memoirs, William E.

Due to public criticism of his handling of the Korean War, Truman decided to ask for Johnson's resignation. On 19 September 1950, Johnson resigned as Secretary of Defense, and the president quickly replaced him with [[General of the Army (United States)|General of the Army]] [[George C. Marshall]].

===Armored warfare===
The initial assault by North Korean KPA forces was aided by the use of Soviet [[T-34|T-34-85]] tanks.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|pp=14, 43}} A North Korean [[Tank corps (Soviet Union)|tank corps]] equipped with about 120 T-34s spearheaded the invasion.

The tide turned in favour of the United Nations forces in August 1950 when the North Koreans suffered major tank losses during a series of battles in which the UN forces brought heavier equipment to bear, including [[M4 Sherman|M4A3 Sherman]] medium tanks backed by [[M26 Pershing|U.S. M26]] heavy tanks, and the British [[Centurion tank|Centurion]], [[Churchill tank|Churchill]], and [[Cromwell tank|Cromwell]] tanks.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|pp=182–84}}

The [[Battle of Inchon|U.S. landings at Inchon]] on 15 September cut off the North Korean supply lines, causing their armored forces and infantry to run out of fuel, ammunition, and other supplies. As a result, the North Koreans had to retreat, and many of the T-34s and heavy weapons had to be abandoned. By the time the North Koreans withdrew from the South, a total of 239 T-34s and 74 [[SU-76]]s were lost.{{sfn|Perrett|1987|p=135}} After November 1950, North Korean armor was rarely encountered.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Zaloga-1996|Zaloga &amp; Kinnear 1996: 33–34]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the initial assault by the north, the Korean War saw limited use of tanks and featured no large-scale tank battles. The mountainous, forested terrain, especially in the Eastern Central Zone, was poor tank country, limiting their mobility. Through the last two years of the war in Korea, UN tanks served largely as infantry support and mobile artillery pieces.{{sfn|Ravino|Carty|2003|p=130}}

===Naval warfare===

{{Naval engagements of the Korean War}}
[[File:KoreanWarNavyGunfire.jpg|thumb|To disrupt North Korean communications, {{USS|Missouri|BB-63|6}} fires a salvo from its 16-inch guns at shore targets near [[Chongjin]], North Korea, 21 October 1950]]

Because neither Korea had a significant navy, the Korean War featured few naval battles. A skirmish between North Korea and the UN Command occurred on 2 July 1950; the U.S. Navy cruiser {{USS|Juneau|CL-119|6}}, the Royal Navy cruiser {{HMS|Jamaica|44|6}}, and the Royal Navy frigate {{HMS|Black Swan|L57|6}} fought four North Korean torpedo boats and two mortar gunboats, and sank them.
USS ''Juneau'' later sank several ammunition ships that had been present. The last sea battle of the Korean War occurred at Inchon, days before the Battle of Inchon; the ROK ship ''PC-703'' sank a North Korean mine layer in the [[Battle of Haeju]] Island, near Inchon. Three other supply ships were sunk by ''PC-703'' two days later in the [[Yellow Sea]].&lt;ref name="Marolda2003" /&gt; Thereafter, vessels from the UN nations held undisputed control of the sea about Korea. The gun ships were used in shore bombardment, while the aircraft carriers provided air support to the ground forces.

During most of the war, the UN navies patrolled the west and east coasts of North Korea, sinking supply and ammunition ships and denying the North Koreans the ability to resupply from the sea. Aside from very occasional gunfire from North Korean shore batteries, the main threat to United States and UN navy ships was from [[magnetic mine]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s. During the war, five U.S. Navy ships were lost to mines: two minesweepers, two minesweeper escorts, and one ocean tug. Mines and gunfire from North Korean coastal artillery damaged another 87 U.S. warships, resulting in slight to moderate damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.korean-war.com/USNavy/usnavyshipssunk.html |title=Korean War |work=korean-war.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130120050209/http://www.korean-war.com/USNavy/usnavyshipssunk.html |archivedate=20 January 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aerial warfare===
{{Further|MiG Alley|USAF Units and Aircraft of the Korean War|Korean People's Air Force}}
The Korean War was the first war in which [[jet aircraft]] played the central role in air combat. Once-formidable fighters such as the [[P-51 Mustang]], [[F4U Corsair]], and [[Hawker Sea Fury]]{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p=174}}—all [[Reciprocating engine|piston-engined]], propeller-driven, and designed during World War II—relinquished their air-superiority roles to a new generation of faster, [[turbojet|jet-powered]] fighters arriving in the theater. For the initial months of the war, the [[P-80 Shooting Star]], [[F9F Panther]], [[Gloster Meteor#Service during the Korean War|Gloster Meteor]] and other jets under the UN flag dominated North Korea's prop-driven air force of Soviet [[Yakovlev Yak-9]] and [[Lavochkin La-9]]s.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p=182}}{{sfn|Werrell|2005|p=71}}

[[File:WarKorea B-29-korea.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A [[B-29 Superfortress]] bomber dropping its bombs]]
The Chinese intervention in late October 1950 bolstered the [[Korean People's Air Force]] (KPAF) of North Korea with the [[MiG-15]], one of the world's most advanced jet fighters.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p=182}} The heavily armed MiGs were faster than first-generation UN jets and therefore could reach and destroy U.S. [[B-29 Superfortress]] bomber flights despite their fighter escorts. With increasing B-29 losses, the Air Force was forced to switch from a daylight bombing campaign to the safer but less accurate nighttime bombing of targets.

The USAF countered the MiG-15 by sending over three squadrons of its most capable fighter, the [[F-86 Sabre]]. These arrived in December 1950.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p=183}}{{sfn|Werrell|2005|pp=76–77}} The MiG was designed as a bomber interceptor. It had a very high [[Ceiling (aeronautics)|service ceiling]]—{{convert|50000|ft|m|sigfig=2|order=flip|abbr=on}} and carried very heavy weaponry: one 37&amp;nbsp;mm cannon and two 23&amp;nbsp;mm cannons. The F-86 had a ceiling of {{convert|42000|ft|m|sigfig=2|order=flip|abbr=on}} and were armed with six .50 caliber (12.7&amp;nbsp;mm) machine guns, which were range adjusted by radar [[Gunsights#Aircraft gunsights|gunsights]]. If coming in at higher altitude the advantage of engaging or not went to the MiG. Once in a level flight [[dogfight]], both swept-wing designs attained comparable maximum speeds of around {{convert|660|mi/h|km/h|sigfig=2|abbr=on|order=flip}}. The MiG climbed faster, but the Sabre turned and dived better.&lt;ref name="Sherman2000" /&gt;

In the summer and autumn of 1951, the outnumbered Sabres of the USAF's [[4th Fighter Wing|4th Fighter Interceptor Wing]]—only 44 at one point—continued seeking battle in [[MiG Alley]], where the [[Yalu River]] marks the Chinese border, against Chinese and North Korean air forces capable of deploying some 500 aircraft. Following Colonel [[Harrison Thyng]]'s communication with the Pentagon, the [[51st Fighter Wing|51st Fighter-Interceptor Wing]] finally reinforced the beleaguered 4th Wing in December 1951; for the next year-and-a-half stretch of the war, aerial warfare continued.&lt;ref name="DavisThyng" /&gt;

Unlike the Vietnam War, in which the Soviet Union only officially sent "advisers", in the Korean aerial war Soviet forces participated via the [[64th Fighter Aviation Corps]]. Fearful of confronting the United States directly, the Soviet Union denied involvement of their personnel in anything other than an advisory role, but air combat quickly resulted in Soviet pilots dropping their code signals and speaking over the wireless in Russian. This known direct Soviet participation was a ''[[casus belli]]'' that the UN Command deliberately overlooked, lest the war for the Korean Peninsula expand to include the Soviet Union, and potentially escalate into atomic warfare.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p=182}}

After the war, and to the present day, the USAF reports an F-86 Sabre [[Loss exchange ratio|kill ratio]] in excess of 10:1, with 792 MiG-15s and 108 other aircraft shot down by Sabres, and 78 Sabres lost to enemy fire.&lt;ref name="Puckett2005" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Frans P.B.

The KPAF reported no data, but the UN Command estimates some 200 KPAF aircraft lost in the war's first stage, and 70 additional aircraft after the Chinese intervention. The USAF disputes Soviet and Chinese claims of 650 and 211 downed F-86s, respectively. However, one source claims that the U.S. Air Force has more recently cited 224 losses (c.100 to air combat) out of 674 F-86s deployed to Korea.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nationalinterest.org/feature/cold-war-battle-the-sky-f-86-saber-vs-mig-15-12909 Cold War Battle in the Sky: F-86 Saber vs. Mig-15] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161203204118/http://nationalinterest.org/feature/cold-war-battle-the-sky-f-86-saber-vs-mig-15-12909 |date=3 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Korean War marked a major milestone not only for fixed-wing aircraft, but also for [[rotorcraft]], featuring the first large-scale deployment of [[helicopter]]s for [[medical evacuation]] (medevac).&lt;ref name="Kreisher2007" /&gt; In 1944–1945, during the Second World War, the [[Sikorsky R-4|YR-4]] helicopter saw limited ambulance duty, but in Korea, where rough terrain trumped the [[jeep]] as a speedy medevac vehicle,&lt;ref name="OliveDrab" /&gt; helicopters like the [[Sikorsky H-19]] helped reduce fatal casualties to a dramatic degree when combined with complementary medical innovations such as [[Mobile Army Surgical Hospital]]s.&lt;ref name="Day" /&gt; The limitations of jet aircraft for [[close air support]] highlighted the helicopter's potential in the role, leading to development of the [[AH-1 Cobra]] and other helicopter gunships used in the Vietnam War (1965–75).&lt;ref name="Kreisher2007" /&gt;

===Bombing of North Korea===
{{Main|Bombing of North Korea 1950-1953}}
[[File:Pyongyang_1951.jpg|thumb|Pyongyang in May 1951]]
The initial bombing attack on North Korea was approved on the fourth day of the war, 29 June 1950, by [[Douglas MacArthur|General Douglas MacArthur]] immediately upon request by the commanding general of the [[Pacific Air Forces|Far East Air Forces]], [[George E. Stratemeyer]].&lt;ref name=Kim2012&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kim|first1=Taewoo|title=Limited War, Unlimited Targets: U.S. Air Force Bombing of North Korea during the Korean War, 1950–1953| journal=Critical Asian Studies |date=2012| volume=44| issue=3|pages=467–492| url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14672715.2012.711980|doi=10.1080/14672715.2012.711980}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Major bombing began in late July.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Ethics of Destruction: Norms and Force in International Relations |author=Ward Thomas |page=149 |publisher=[[Cornell University Press]] |date=14 June 2001 |isbn=978-0801487415}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 August 1950, the U.S. Air Force dropped 625 tons of bombs on North Korea; two weeks later, the daily tonnage increased to some 800 tons.&lt;ref name="Cumings2006"/&gt;

From June through October, official U.S. policy was to pursue precision bombing aimed at communication centers (railroad stations, marshaling yards, main yards, and railways) and industrial facilities deemed vital to war making capacity. The policy was the result of debates after World War II, in which U.S. policy rejected the mass civilian bombings that had been conducted in the later stages of World War II as unproductive and immoral.&lt;ref name=Kim2012/&gt; In early July, General Emmett "Rosie" O'Donnell requested permission to burn five North Korean cities. He proposed that MacArthur announce that the UN would employ the firebombing methods that "brought Japan to its knees." The announcement would warn the leaders of North Korea "to get women and children and other noncombatants the hell out."&lt;ref name=ConwayLanz/&gt;

According to O'Donnell, MacArthur responded, "No, Rosie, I'm not prepared to go that far yet. My instructions are very explicit; however, I want you to know that I have no compunction whatever to your bombing bona fide military objectives, with high explosives, in those five industrial centers. If you miss your target and kill people or destroy other parts of the city, I accept that as a part of war."&lt;ref name=ConwayLanz/&gt;

In September 1950, MacArthur said in his public report to the United Nations, "The problem of avoiding the killing of innocent civilians and damages to the civilian economy is continually present and given my personal attention."&lt;ref name=ConwayLanz/&gt;

In October 1950, FEAF commander General Stratemeyer requested permission to attack the city of Sinuiju, a provincial capital with an estimated population of 60,000, "over the widest area of the city, without warning, by burning and high explosive." MacArthur's headquarters responded the following day: "The general policy enunciated from Washington negates such an attack unless the military situation clearly requires it. Under present circumstances this is not the case."&lt;ref name=ConwayLanz/&gt;

Following the intervention of the Chinese in November, General MacArthur ordered increased bombing on North Korea which included [[Firebombing|incendiary attacks]] against the country's arsenals and communications centers and especially against the "Korean end" of all the bridges across the Yalu River.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Beyond the Wild Blue: A History of the U.S. Air Force, 1947–1997 |author=Walter J.

On 3 November 1950, General Stratemeyer forwarded to MacArthur the request of Fifth Air Force commander General Earle E. Partridge for clearance to "burn Sinuiju." As he had done previously in July and October, MacArthur denied the request, explaining that he planned to use the town's facilities after seizing it. However, at the same meeting, MacArthur agreed for the first time to a firebombing campaign, agreeing to Stratemeyer's request to burn the city of Kanggye and several other towns: "Burn it if you so desire. Not only that, Strat, but burn and destroy as a lesson to any other of those towns that you consider of military value to the enemy." The same evening, MacArthur's chief of staff told Stratemeyer that the firebombing of Sinuiju had also been approved. In his diary, Stratemeyer summarized the instructions as follows: "Every installation, facility, and village in North Korea now becomes a military and tactical target." Stratemeyer sent orders to the Fifth Air Force and Bomber Command to "destroy every means of communications and every installation, factory, city, and village."&lt;ref name=ConwayLanz/&gt;

On 5 November 1950, General Stratemeyer gave the following order to the commanding general of the Fifth Air Force: "Aircraft under Fifth Air Force control will destroy all other targets including all buildings capable of affording shelter." The same day, twenty-two B-29s attacked Kanggye, destroying 75% of the city.&lt;ref name=Kim2012/&gt;

After MacArthur was removed as Supreme Commander in Korea in April 1951, his successors continued this policy and ultimately extended it to all of North Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Brief History: Brief History of Korea |author=Mark Peterson |page=149 |publisher=Facts on File |date=1 December 2009 |isbn=978-0816050857}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. dropped a total of 635,000 tons of bombs, including 32,557 tons of napalm, on Korea, more than during the whole Pacific campaign of World War II.&lt;ref name="Walkom2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="japanfocus.org"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Armstrong|first1=Charles|title=The Destruction and Reconstruction of North Korea, 1950–1960|journal=The Asia-Pacific Journal|date=20 December 2010|volume=8|issue=51|url=http://www.japanfocus.org/-charles_k_-armstrong/3460/article.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===U.S. threat of atomic warfare===
[[File:Mk4 Fat Man bomb.jpg|thumb|Mark 4 bomb, seen on display, transferred to the [[9th Bombardment Wing, Heavy]]]]
On 5 November 1950, the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] (JCS) issued orders for the retaliatory atomic bombing of Manchurian PRC military bases, if either their armies crossed into Korea or if PRC or KPA bombers attacked Korea from there. The President ordered the transfer of nine [[Mark 4 nuclear bomb]]s "to the Air Force's [[9th Bombardment Wing, Heavy|Ninth Bomb Group]], the designated carrier of the weapons ... [and] signed an order to use them against Chinese and Korean targets", which he never transmitted.{{sfn|Cumings|2005|pp=289–92}}

Many U.S. officials viewed the deployment of nuclear-capable (but not nuclear-armed) B-29 bombers to Britain as helping to resolve the [[Berlin Blockade]] of 1948–1949. Truman and Eisenhower both had military experience and viewed nuclear weapons as potentially usable components of their military. During Truman's first meeting to discuss the war on 25 June 1950, he ordered plans be prepared for attacking Soviet forces if they entered the war. By July, Truman approved another B-29 deployment to Britain, this time with bombs (but without their [[Pit (nuclear weapon)|cores]]), to remind the Soviets of U.S. offensive ability. Deployment of a similar fleet to [[Guam]] was leaked to ''The New York Times''. As United Nations forces retreated to Pusan, and the [[CIA]] reported that mainland China was building up forces for a possible invasion of Taiwan, the Pentagon believed that Congress and the public would demand using nuclear weapons if the situation in Korea required them.&lt;ref name="jstor2538736"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dingman | first1 = R. | year = 1988–1989 | title = Atomic Diplomacy during the Korean War | journal = International Security | volume = 13 | issue = 3 | pages = 50–91 | jstor = 2538736 | doi = 10.2307/2538736 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Chinese forces pushed back the United States forces from the Yalu River, Truman stated during a 30 November 1950 press conference that using nuclear weapons was "always [under] active consideration", with control under the local military commander.{{r|jstor2538736}} The Indian ambassador, [[Kavalam Madhava Panikkar|K. Madhava Panikkar]], reports "that Truman announced he was thinking of using the atom bomb in Korea. But the Chinese seemed unmoved by this threat ... The PRC's propaganda against the U.S. was stepped up. The 'Aid Korea to resist America' campaign was made the slogan for increased production, greater national integration, and more rigid control over anti-national activities. One could not help feeling that Truman's threat came in useful to the leaders of the Revolution, to enable them to keep up the tempo of their activities."&lt;ref name="Schnabel" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Knightley1982" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Panikkar1981" /&gt;

After his statement caused concern in Europe, Truman met on 4 December 1950 with UK prime minister and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] spokesman [[Clement Attlee]], French Premier [[René Pleven]], and French Foreign Minister [[Robert Schuman]] to discuss their worries about atomic warfare and its likely continental expansion. The United States' forgoing atomic warfare was not because of "a disinclination by the Soviet Union and People's Republic of China to escalate [the Korean War]", but because UN allies—notably from the UK, the Commonwealth, and France—were concerned about a [[geopolitics|geopolitical]] imbalance rendering NATO defenseless while the United States fought China, who then might persuade the Soviet Union to conquer Western Europe.&lt;ref name="Schnabel" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Truman1955" /&gt; The Joint Chiefs of Staff advised Truman to tell Attlee that the United States would use nuclear weapons only if necessary to protect an evacuation of UN troops, or to prevent a "major military disaster".{{r|jstor2538736}}

On 6 December 1950, after the Chinese intervention repelled the UN Command armies from northern North Korea, General [[J. Lawton Collins]] (Army Chief of Staff), General MacArthur, Admiral [[C. Turner Joy]], General [[George E. Stratemeyer]], and staff officers Major General Doyle Hickey, Major General [[Charles A. Willoughby]], and Major General Edwin K. Wright met in Tokyo to plan strategy countering the Chinese intervention; they considered three potential atomic warfare scenarios encompassing the next weeks and months of warfare.&lt;ref name="Schnabel" /&gt;
* In the first scenario: If the PVA continued attacking in full and the UN Command was forbidden to blockade and bomb China, and without ROC reinforcements, and without an increase in U.S. forces until April 1951 (four [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] divisions were due to arrive), then atomic bombs might be used in North Korea.&lt;ref name="Schnabel" /&gt;
* In the second scenario: If the PVA continued full attacks and the UN Command blockaded China and had effective aerial reconnaissance and bombing of the Chinese interior, and the ROC soldiers were maximally exploited, and tactical atomic bombing was to hand, then the UN forces could hold positions deep in North Korea.&lt;ref name="Schnabel" /&gt;
* In the third scenario: if China agreed to not cross the 38th parallel border, General MacArthur recommended UN acceptance of an armistice disallowing PVA and KPA troops south of the parallel, and requiring PVA and KPA guerrillas to withdraw northwards. The U.S. Eighth Army would remain to protect the Seoul–Incheon area, while X Corps would retreat to Pusan. A UN commission should supervise implementation of the armistice.&lt;ref name="Schnabel" /&gt;

Both the Pentagon and the State Department were cautious about using nuclear weapons because of the risk of general war with China and the diplomatic ramifications. Truman and his senior advisors agreed, and never seriously considered using them in early December 1950 despite the poor military situation in Korea.{{r|jstor2538736}}

In 1951, the U.S. escalated closest to atomic warfare in Korea. Because China deployed new armies to the Sino-Korean frontier, pit crews at the [[Kadena Air Base]], [[Okinawa Prefecture|Okinawa]], assembled atomic bombs for Korean warfare, "lacking only the essential pit nuclear cores". In October 1951, the United States effected [[Operation Hudson Harbor]] to establish a nuclear weapons capability. USAF B-29 bombers practised individual bombing runs from Okinawa to North Korea (using dummy nuclear or conventional bombs), coordinated from [[Yokota Air Base]] in east-central Japan. ''Hudson Harbor'' tested "actual functioning of all activities which would be involved in an atomic strike, including weapons assembly and testing, leading, [and] ground control of bomb aiming". The bombing run data indicated that atomic bombs would be tactically ineffective against massed infantry, because the "timely identification of large masses of enemy troops was extremely rare."&lt;ref name="Hasbrouck1951" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chiefof Staff1951" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Watson1998" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CommandingGeneral1951" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FarEastCommand" /&gt;

[[Matthew Ridgway|General Matthew Ridgway]] was authorized to use nuclear weapons if a major air attack originated from outside Korea. An envoy was sent to Hong Kong to deliver a warning to China. The message likely caused Chinese leaders to be more cautious about potential U.S. use of nuclear weapons, but whether they learned about the B-29 deployment is unclear and the failure of the two major Chinese offensives that month likely was what caused them to shift to a defensive strategy in Korea. The B-29s returned to the United States in June.{{r|jstor2538736}}

Despite the greater destructive power deploying atomic weapons would bring to the war, their effects on determining the war's outcome would have likely been minimal. Tactically, given the dispersed nature of Chinese and North Korean forces, the relatively primitive infrastructure for staging and logistics centers, and the small number of bombs available (most would have been conserved for use against the Soviets), atomic attacks would have limited effects against the ability of China to mobilize and move forces. Strategically, attacking Chinese cities to destroy civilian industry and infrastructure would cause the immediate dispersion of the leadership away from such areas and give propaganda value for the communists to galvanize the support of Chinese civilians. Since the Soviets were not expected to intervene with their few primitive atomic weapons on China or North Korea's behalf, if the U.S. used theirs first factors such as little operational value and the lowering of the "threshold" for using atomic weapons against non-nuclear states in future conflicts played more of a role in not deploying them than the threat of a possible nuclear exchange.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thediplomat.com/2016/01/what-if-the-united-states-had-used-the-bomb-in-korea/|title=What If the United States had Used the Bomb in Korea? |last1=Farley |first1=Robert |date=5 January 2016 |website=[[The Diplomat]] |publisher= |accessdate=5 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Eisenhower succeeded Truman in early 1953 he was similarly cautious about using nuclear weapons in Korea, including for diplomatic purposes to encourage progress in ongoing truce discussions. The administration prepared contingency plans to use them against China, but like Truman, the new president feared doing so would result in Soviet attacks on Japan. The war ended as it began, without U.S. nuclear weapons deployed near battle.{{r|jstor2538736}}

There were numerous atrocities and massacres of civilians throughout the Korean war committed by both the North and South Koreans. Many started on the first days of the war.

In occupied areas, North Korean Army [[political commissar|political officers]] purged South Korean society of its intelligentsia by executing every educated person—whether it be academically, governmentally, religiously—who might lead resistance against the North; the purges continued during the NPA retreat.&lt;ref name="Rummel1997" /&gt; When the North Koreans retreated north in September 1950, they abducted tens of thousands of South Korean men. The reasons are not clear, but the intention might have been to acquire skilled professionals to the North.&lt;ref name="Choe2007" /&gt;

In addition to conventional military operations, North Korean soldiers fought the UN forces by [[infiltration tactics|infiltrating]] guerrillas among refugees. These soldiers disguised as refugees would approach UN forces asking for food and help, then open fire and attack. U.S. troops acted under a "shoot-first-ask-questions-later" policy against any civilian refugee approaching U.S. battlefield positions,&lt;ref name="HanleyMendoza2006" /&gt; a policy that led U.S. soldiers to kill an estimated 400 civilians at [[No Gun Ri]] (26–29 July 1950) in central Korea because they believed some of the refugees to be North Korean soldiers in disguise.&lt;ref name="HanleyMendoza2007" /&gt; The [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Korea)|South Korean Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] defended this policy as a "military necessity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/2010/jul/10/korea-bloodbath-probe-ends-us-escapes-much-blame/ |title=Korea bloodbath probe ends; US escapes much blame |agency=[[Associated Press]] |work=[[U-T San Diego]] |author1=Charles J.

Beginning in 2005, the South Korean Truth and Reconciliation Commission has investigated numerous atrocities committed by the Japanese colonial government, North Korean military, U.S. military, and the authoritarian South Korean government. It has investigated atrocities before, during and after the Korean War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Truth Commission: South Korea 2005 |url=http://www.usip.org/publications/truth-commission-south-korea-2005 |website=United States Institute of Peace |publisher=United States Institute of Peace |accessdate=13 June 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610224046/http://www.usip.org/publications/truth-commission-south-korea-2005 |archivedate=10 June 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Commission verified over 14,000 civilians were killed in the [[Jeju uprising]] (1948–49) that involved South Korean military and paramilitary units against pro-North Korean guerrillas on the island of Jeju southwest of tip of the peninsula. Although most of the fighting subsided by 1949, it continued until 1950. The Commission estimates 86% of the civilians were killed by South Korean forces. The Americans on the island documented the events, but never intervened.&lt;ref name="Newsweek2000" /&gt;

The United States reported that North Korea mistreated prisoners of war: soldiers were beaten, starved, put to [[unfree labour|forced labor]], [[death march|marched to death]], and [[summary execution|summarily executed]].&lt;ref name="Potter1953" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Carlson2003" /&gt;

The KPA killed POWs at the battles for Hill 312, [[Hill 303]], the Pusan Perimeter, and Daejeon; these massacres were discovered afterwards by the UN forces. Later, a U.S. Congress [[war crime]]s investigation, the United States Senate Subcommittee on Korean War Atrocities of the Permanent Subcommittee of the Investigations of the Committee on Government Operations, reported that "two-thirds of all American prisoners of war in Korea died as a result of war crimes".&lt;ref name="Lakshmanan1999" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Van Zandt2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Skelton2002" /&gt;

Although the Chinese rarely executed prisoners like their North Korean counterparts, mass starvation and diseases swept through the Chinese-run POW camps during the winter of 1950–51. About 43 percent of U.S. POWs died during this period. The Chinese defended their actions by stating that all Chinese soldiers during this period were suffering mass starvation and diseases due to logistical difficulties. The UN POWs said that most of the Chinese camps were located near the easily supplied Sino-Korean border, and that the Chinese withheld food to force the prisoners to accept the communism indoctrination programs.&lt;ref name="Lech2000" /&gt; According to Chinese reports, over a thousand U.S. POWs died by the end of June 1951, while a dozen British POWs died, and all Turkish POW survived.&lt;ref&gt;中国人民解放军总政治部联络部编. 敌军工作史料·第6册(1949年–1955年). 1989&lt;/ref&gt; According to Hastings, wounded U.S. POWs died for lack of medical attention and were fed a diet of corn and millet "devoid of vegetables, almost barren of proteins, minerals, or vitamins" with only 1/3 the calories of their usual diet. Especially in early 1951, thousands of prisoners lost the will to live and "declined to eat the mess of sorghum and rice they were provided."&lt;ref&gt;Hastings. The Korean War.

==Aftermath==
{{Main|Aftermath of the Korean War}}

Postwar recovery was different in the two Koreas. South Korea stagnated in the first postwar decade. In 1953, South Korea and the United States signed a [[Mutual Defense Treaty Between the United States and the Republic of Korea|Mutual Defense Treaty]]. In 1960, the [[April Revolution]] occurred and students joined an anti-[[Syngman Rhee]] demonstration; 142 were killed by police; in consequence Syngman Rhee resigned and left for exile in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |others= |editor1-last=Savada |editor1-first=Andrea |title=South Korea: A Country Study |url=https://books.google.com/?id=_adMWevoEq0C&amp;pg=PA34&amp;q=korea%20april%20revolution%20Rhee&amp;f= |accessdate=5 April 2013 |year=1997 |publisher=Diane Pub Co |isbn=978-0788146190 |page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Park Chung-hee]]'s [[May 16 coup]] enabled social stability.

Following extensive USAF bombing, North Korea "had been virtually destroyed as an industrial society." After the armistice, Kim Il-Sung requested Soviet economic and industrial assistance. In September 1953, the Soviet government agreed to "cancel or postpone repayment for all ... outstanding debts", and promised to grant North Korea one billion [[rubles]] in monetary aid, industrial equipment and consumer goods. Eastern European members of the [[Soviet Bloc]] also contributed with "logistical support, technical aid, [and] medical supplies." China canceled North Korea's war debts, provided 800 million [[Chinese yuan|yuan]], promised trade cooperation, and sent in thousands of troops to rebuild damaged infrastructure.&lt;ref name="japanfocus.org"/&gt;

South Korean [[Anti-American sentiment in Korea|anti-Americanism]] after the war was fueled by the presence and behavior of U.S. military personnel ([[USFK]]) and U.S. support for the [[Park Chung-hee|authoritarian regime]], a fact still evident during the country's democratic transition in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="NYTimes12July1987" /&gt; However, anti-Americanism has declined significantly in South Korea in recent years, from 46% favorable in 2003 to 74% favorable in 2011,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pewglobal.org/2007/06/27/chapter-1-views-of-the-u-s-and-american-foreign-policy/ "Global Unease With Major World Powers"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130310043046/http://www.pewglobal.org/2007/06/27/chapter-1-views-of-the-u-s-and-american-foreign-policy/ |date=10 March 2013 }}.

In addition, a large number of [[Amerasian|mixed-race]] "G.I. babies" (offspring of U.S. and other UN soldiers and Korean women) were filling up the country's orphanages. Because Korean traditional society places significant weight on paternal family ties, bloodlines, and purity of race, children of mixed race or those without fathers are not easily accepted in South Korean society. International adoption of Korean children began in 1954.&lt;ref name="Jang1998" /&gt; The U.S. [[Immigration Act of 1952]] legalized the [[naturalization]] of non-blacks and non-whites as U.S. citizens, and made possible the entry of military spouses and children from South Korea after the Korean War. With the passage of the [[Immigration Act of 1965]], which substantially changed U.S. immigration policy toward non-Europeans, [[Korean American|Koreans]] became one of the fastest-growing [[Asian American|Asian]] groups in the United States.&lt;ref name="Choe2005" /&gt;

Mao Zedong's decision to take on the United States in the Korean War was a direct attempt to confront what the Communist bloc viewed as the strongest anti-Communist power in the world, undertaken at a time when the Chinese Communist regime was still consolidating its own power after winning the [[Chinese Civil War]]. Mao supported intervention not to save North Korea, but because he believed that a military conflict with the United States was inevitable after the United States entered the Korean War, and to appease the Soviet Union to secure military dispensation and achieve Mao's goal of making China a major world military power. Mao was equally ambitious in improving his own prestige inside the communist international community by demonstrating that his Marxist concerns were international. In his later years Mao believed that Stalin only gained a positive opinion of him after China's entrance into the Korean War. Inside mainland China, the war improved the long-term prestige of Mao, Zhou, and Peng, allowing the Chinese Communist Party to increase its legitimacy while weakening anti-Communist dissent.{{sfn|Barnouin|Yu|2006|p=150}}
[[File:NKmuseum.jpg|thumb|North Koreans touring the [[Sinchon Museum of American War Atrocities|Museum of American War Atrocities]] in 2009]]

The Chinese government have encouraged the point of view that the war was initiated by the United States and South Korea, though ComIntern documents have shown that Mao sought approval from Joseph Stalin to enter the war. In Chinese media, the Chinese war effort is considered as an example of China's engaging the strongest power in the world with an under-equipped army, forcing it to retreat, and fighting it to a military stalemate. These successes were contrasted with China's historical humiliations by Japan and by Western powers over the previous hundred years, highlighting the abilities of the [[People's Liberation Army]] and the [[Chinese Communist Party]]. The most significant negative long-term consequence of the war for China was that it led the United States to guarantee the safety of Chiang Kai-shek's regime in Taiwan, effectively ensuring that Taiwan would remain outside of PRC control through the present day.{{sfn|Barnouin|Yu|2006|p=150}} Mao had also discovered the usefulness of large-scale [[mass movement]]s in the war while implementing them among most of his ruling measures over PRC.&lt;ref&gt;沈志华、李丹慧．《战后中苏关系若干问题研究》(Research into Some Issues of Sino-USSR Relationship After WWII)人民出版社，2006年：p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, [[Anti-Americanism|anti-U.S. sentiments]], which were already a significant factor during the Chinese Civil War, was ingrained into Chinese culture during the Communist propaganda campaigns of the Korean War.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Zhang | first = Hong | title = The Making of Urban Chinese Images of the United States, 1945–1953 | location = Westport, CT | publisher = Greenwood Press | year = 2002 | isbn = 978-0313310010 | pages = 164–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Korean War affected other participant combatants. [[Turkey]], for example, entered [[NATO]] in 1952,&lt;ref name="StateDept" /&gt; and the foundation was laid for bilateral diplomatic and trade relations with South Korea.&lt;ref name="Turquie2010" /&gt;

The '''left-wing uprisings against the Bolsheviks''' were a series of [[rebellion]]s and uprisings against the [[Bolsheviks]] by rival [[left-wing politics|left-wing parties]] that started soon after the [[October Revolution]], continued through the [[Russian Civil War]], and lasted into the first few years of [[Bolshevik]] [[Communist]] rule and establishment of the [[Soviet Union]]. They were led or supported by left-wing groups such as some factions of the [[Socialist Revolutionary Party]], [[Left Socialist-Revolutionaries]], [[Mensheviks]], and [[Anarchism in Russia|anarchists]]. The uprisings started in 1918, just as the [[Armistice]] of 11 November 1918 was proclaimed, ending the [[World War I|First World War]], and continued during and after the Civil War until around 1923. The Bolsheviks increasingly abandoned attempts to invite these groups to join the government and instead later suppressed them with force.

At the same time the Bolshevik provisional government in [[Petrograd]] ([[St Petersburg]]) and [[Moscow]] was also struggling against forces from the conservative right of [[House of Romanov|Romanov]] monarchists, moderate socialists, former [[Russian Imperial Army|Imperial Army]] officers and soldiers in the anti-communist [[White Army|White Armies]] along with several foreign nations sending in post World War expeditionary forces and legions.

==Background==
{{Libertarian socialism|Events}}
Previously, the dominating parts of the [[Mensheviks]] and of the [[Socialist Revolutionary Party]] had supported the continuation of Russian involvement in [[World War I]] by the Provisional Government after the February Revolution of 1917. The Bolsheviks called the war an interimperialist war and called for the revolutionary defeat of their own [[Russian Empire|imperialist]] government. Within the Mensheviks and the Socialist Revolutionists, there did exist factions that also opposed the war and the government, but much of their leadership was involved in both. In the [[July Days]] of 1917, the Menshevik and Socialist Revolutionary parties supported suppression of the Bolsheviks.

The [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Bolshevik Party]] came to power in the [[October Revolution]] of November 1917 through simultaneous election in the most prominent [[Soviet (council)|soviets]] and an organized uprising supported by military mutiny. Several of the main reasons for which much of the population supported the Bolsheviks were to end the war and have a [[social revolution]], exemplified by the slogan "Peace, Land, Bread".

===SR split===
The Bolsheviks invited Left SRs and [[Martov]]'s [[Menshevik Internationalists]] to join the government. The Mensheviks and Right SRs walked out. The majority of SRs split to form the Left SRs{{sfnp|Carr|1985|page=111}} and joined the Bolshevik coalition government, supporting the Bolsheviks' immediate enactment of the Socialist Revolutionary Party's land redistribution program. The Left SRs were given four Commissar positions and held high posts within the [[Cheka]]. The Left SRs still diverged with the Bolsheviks on the issue of the war.

===First party ban===
The only party banned at first was the [[pogrom]]ist [[Union of the Russian People]], generally known as "The [[Black Hundreds]]".

===Anarchist divisions===
{{further|Anarchism in Russia}}
Anarchists, like the Socialist Revolutionaries, were divided. Some supported the Bolsheviks, holding minor positions in the government,&lt;ref name="avrich1968" /&gt; some were neutral, and some actively resisted. Anarchists that supported the Soviet government were referred to as "Soviet anarchists", by anti-Bolshevik anarchists, and were lauded by Lenin in August 1919 as "the most dedicated supporters of Soviet power".&lt;ref name="avrich1968"&gt;[[Paul Avrich|Avrich, Paul]]. "Russian Anarchists and the Civil War", ''Russian Review'', Vol. 27, No. 3 (Jul., 1968), pp. 296-306. [[Blackwell Publishing]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dissolution of the Constituent Assembly, early Constituent Assembly rebellions==
The [[Russian Constituent Assembly|Constituent Assembly]] had been a demand of the Bolsheviks against the Provisional Government, which kept delaying it. After the October Revolution the elections were run by the body appointed by the previous Provisional Government. It was based on universal suffrage, but used party lists from before the Left-Right SR split. The anti-soviet Right SRs took the majority of the seats but this reflected the opposite of reality: the majority of SRs and the people were pro-soviet.{{sfnp|Carr|1985|pages=111–112}} Lenin's ''Theses on the Constituent Assembly'' argued in ''[[Pravda]]'' that because of class conflicts, conflicts with Ukraine, and with the Kadet-Kaledin uprising formal democracy was impossible. He argued the Constituent Assembly must unconditionally accept sovereignty of the soviet government or it would be dealt with "by revolutionary means".{{sfnp|Carr|1985|pages=113–115}}

On December 30, 1917, the SR [[Nikolai Avksentiev]] and some followers were arrested for organizing a conspiracy. This was the first time Bolsheviks used this kind of repression against a socialist party. ''[[Isvestiya]]'' said the arrest was not related to his membership in the Constituent Assembly.{{sfnp|Carr|1985|page=115}}

On January 4, 1918, the [[All-Russian Central Executive Committee|VTsIK]] made a resolution saying the slogan "all power to the constituent assembly" was counterrevolutionary and equivalent to "down with the soviets".{{sfnp|Carr|1985|pages=115–116}}

[[File:Maria Spiridonova.jpg|thumb|left|[[Maria Spiridonova]]]]
[[File:Viktor Chernov (1873-1952), Russian revolutionary (small).jpg|thumb|right|[[Viktor Chernov]]]]

The Constituent Assembly met on January 18, 1918. The Right SR Chernov was elected president defeating the Bolshevik supported candidate, the Left SR [[Maria Spiridonova]]. The majority refused to accept sovereignty of the Soviet government, and in response the Bolsheviks and Left SRs walked out. It was dispersed by an armed guard, sailor Zheleznyakov.{{sfnp|Carr|1985|pages=118–120}} A simultaneous demonstration in favor of the Constituent Assembly was dispersed with force, but there was little protest afterward as people in general supported the Bolsheviks.{{sfnp|Carr|1985|pages=120–121}}

The first large [[Cheka]] repression with some killings began against the [[libertarian socialism|libertarian socialist]]s of Petrograd in mid-April 1918. On May 1, 1918, a pitched battle took place in Moscow between the anarchists and the police. (P.Avrich. G Maximoff)

===Constituent Assembly uprising===
The [[Union of Regeneration]] was founded in Moscow in April 1918 as an underground agency organizing democratic resistance to the Bolshevik dictatorship, composed of the Popular Socialists, Right Socialist Revolutionaries, and Defensists, among others. They were tasked with propping up anti-Bolshevik forces and to create a Russian state system based on civil liberties, patriotism, and state-consciousness with the goal to liberate the country from the "Germano-Bolshevik" yoke.&lt;ref name=WS&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=73lLeNeICXUC "White Siberia: the politics of civil war"], Norman G. O. Pereira.

On May 7, 1918, the [[Eighth Party Council]] of the [[Socialist-Revolutionary Party|Party of Socialist Revolutionaries]] commenced in [[Moscow]] and recognized the Union's leading role, putting aside political ideology and class for the purpose of Russia's salvation. They decided to start an uprising against the Bolsheviks with the goal of reconvening the Russian Constituent Assembly.&lt;ref name=WS /&gt; While preparations were under way, the [[Czechoslovak Legions]] overthrew Bolshevik rule in [[Siberia]], [[Urals]] and the [[Volga]] region in late May-early June 1918 and the center of SR activity shifted there. On June 8, 1918, five Constituent Assembly members formed the All-Russian [[Committee of Members of the Constituent Assembly]] (''Komuch'') in [[Samara, Russia|Samara]] and declared it the new supreme authority in the country.&lt;ref name="komuch"&gt;See Jonathan D. Smele. Op. cit., p.32 ("Op. cit." means to refer to a work cited earlier in the citations. this means you copied it from a citation list, and are citing something that you have not read. instead you should cite what you read and say it refers to this, or if you can get the original work and look at it then you can cite it directly.)&lt;/ref&gt; The Social Revolutionary [[Provisional Government of Autonomous Siberia]] came to power on June 29, 1918, after the uprising in [[Vladivostok]].

==Left SRs disagreements==
The Left SRs were dismayed that the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] gave up large amounts of territory. With the signing of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk by the Bolsheviks on March 3, 1918, the Socialist Revolutionary leadership "increasingly viewed" the Bolshevik government as a German proxy.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} They left the government in protest in March 1918.

===Mensheviks and SRs excluded from soviets===
At the [[5th All-Russia Congress of Soviets]] of July 4, 1918, the [[Left Socialist-Revolutionaries]] had 352 delegates compared to 745 Bolsheviks out of 1132 total. The Left SRs raised disagreements on the suppression of rival parties, the death penalty, and mainly, the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. The Bolsheviks excluded the Right SRs and Mensheviks from the government on 14 June for associating with counterrevolutionaries and seeking to "organize armed attacks against the workers and peasants" (though Mensheviks had not supported them), while the Left SRs advocated forming a government of all socialist parties. The Left SRs agreed with extrajudicial execution of political opponents to stop the counterrevolution, but opposed having the government legally pronouncing death sentences, an unusual position that is best understood within the context of the group's terrorist past. The Left SRs strongly opposed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, and opposed Trotsky's insistence that no one try to attack German troops in Ukraine.{{sfnp|Carr|1985|pages=161–164}}

==Left SR Uprising==
{{main|Left SR Uprising}}
Defeated at the Congress, the Left SRs pursued their aim of sabotaging the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk and dragging [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]] back into war with [[Germany]] by using their positions within the [[Cheka]] to assassinate the German [[Ambassador]] in [[Moscow]], [[Count]] [[Wilhelm Mirbach|Wilhelm von Mirbach]], on July 6, 1918. The Leadership of the Left SRs incorrectly believed this assassination would lead to a widespread popular uprising in support of their aims. They claimed to be leading an uprising against peace with Germany and not necessarily against the Bolsheviks and Soviet power.&lt;ref name="boniece2004" /&gt;

The main rebel force was a [[Detachment (military)|detachment]] commanded by [[Dmitry Ivanovich Popov]], a Left S.R. and member of the Cheka. About 1,800 revolutionaries took part in the [[insurrection]], [[bomb]]arding the [[Kremlin]] with [[artillery]] and seizing the [[telephone]] exchange and [[Telegraphy|telegraph]] office. During the two days that they remained in control there, they sent out several [[manifesto]]s, bulletins and [[telegram]]s in the name of the Left S.R. Central Committee declaring that the Left S.R.s had taken over [[power (sociology)|power]] and that their action had been welcomed by the whole [[nation|people]]. The Fifth Congress of Soviets instructed{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} the [[government]] to suppress the [[insurrection]] at once, and the group of Left S.R.s at the Congress was [[arrest]]ed.

Left S.R.s and [[anarchist]]s{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} also started insurrections in [[Petrograd]], [[Vologda]], [[Arzamas]], [[Murom]], [[Yaroslavl]], [[Velikiy Ustyug]], [[Rybinsk]] and other [[city|cities]]. A telegram from the Left S. R. Central Committee stating that the Left S.R.s had seized power in Moscow, was sent to [[Mikhail Artemyevich Muravyov|M. A. Muravyov]], a Left S.R. and [[Commander]] of the [[Eastern Front (World War I)]]. On the pretext of attacking the Germans, he seized [[Simbirsk]] (later Ulyanovsk) and marched his forces on Moscow in support of the revolutionaries.

The result of the Left SR Uprising was the suppression of the Left SRs, the last major independent party other than the Bolsheviks, leaving the Bolsheviks as the only party in government.

Subsequent uprisings included the [[Tambov Rebellion]], [[Workers' Opposition]], and the [[Kronstadt rebellion]].

===Aims and slogans===
Socialist Revolutionaries tended to claim to be fighting to restore the February Revolution. Some anarchists used the slogan "Third Revolution". The slogan was later used during the Kronstadt rebellion also.&lt;ref name="avrich1974"&gt;Avrich, Paul. [[Kronstadt, 1921]]. W. W. Norton &amp; Company 1974, 170&lt;/ref&gt;

===Repression===
[[Lenin]] sent the [[telegram]]s to "introduce mass terror" in [[Nizhny Novgorod]] in response to the civilian uprising there, and "crush" peasants in [[Penza]] who protested to requisition of their grain by military detachments.&lt;ref name=courtois&gt;[http://users.cyberone.com.au/myers/courtois.html Stephane Courtois, The Black Book of COMMUNISM&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114220819/http://users.cyberone.com.au/myers/courtois.html |date=2009-01-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Black Book of Communism]]: ""It is quite clear that preparations are being made for a White Guard uprising in Nizhni Novgorod," wrote Lenin in a telegram on 9 August 1918 to the president of the Executive Committee of the Nizhni Novgorod soviet, in response to a report about [[peasant]] protests against requisitioning. "Your first response must be to establish a dictatorial troika (i.e., you, Markin, and one other person) and introduce mass terror, shooting or deporting the hundreds of prostitutes who are causing all the soldiers to drink, all the ex-officers, etc. There is not a moment to lose; you must act resolutely, with massive reprisals. Immediate execution for anyone caught in possession of a firearm. Massive deportations of Mensheviks and other suspect elements."  The next day Lenin sent a similar telegram to the Central Executive Committee of the Penza soviet:

{{quote|Comrades! The kulak uprising in your five districts must be crushed without pity. The interests of the whole revolution demand such actions, for the final struggle with the kulaks has now begun. You must make an example of these people. (1) Hang (I mean hang publicly, so that people see it) at least 100 kulaks, rich bastards, and known bloodsuckers. (2) Publish their names. (3) Seize all their grain. (4) Single out the hostages per my instructions in yesterday's telegram. Do all this so that for miles around people see it all, understand it, tremble, and tell themselves that we are killing the bloodthirsty kulaks and that we will continue to do so. Reply saying you have received and carried out these instructions. Yours, Lenin.

''P.S. Find tougher people.''&lt;ref name=courtois/&gt;}}

===Assassination attempts===
[[File:Lenin attempt.jpg|250px|thumb|right|[[Vladimir Pchelin]]'s depiction of the assassination attempt on Lenin]]
In the morning of August 30, 1918, a Social Revolutionary [[Leonid Kannegisser]], who was [[Boris Savinkov]]'s comrade, killed the chief of the [[Cheka]] in Petrograd, [[Moisei Uritsky]], in his office.

On August 30, 1918 [[Lenin]] survived an attempted assassination by [[Fanny Kaplan]] leaving a bullet in his neck. This contributed to the strokes&lt;ref&gt;''New York Post'' - [http://www.nypost.com/seven/11192007/news/cextra/vladimir_lenin___the_father_of_communism_532746.htm?page=0 "Vladimir Lenin - The Father Of Communism"] November 19, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; that prevented him from removing Stalin.

On September 5, 1918 the Cheka gave responsibility for targeting opposing parties on the left such as the Social Revolutionaries and other anti-Bolshevik groups, chiefly the [[Anarchism in Russia|anarchists]], by the policy of [[Red Terror]].

===Reinstatement of Mensheviks===
In November 1918, the Sixth All-Russian Congress of Soviets met. They approved an amnesty, ordering release of those detained by the Cheka who had no definite charges within two weeks of arrest, and of hostages except those needed to guarantee hostages held by their enemies. They also held out an [[olive branch]] to the other socialist parties. The Menshevik conference in October 1918 had declared military support to the Soviet Government but still opposed the Cheka and terror. On November 30 the VTsIK annulled the exclusion of the Mensheviks except those who were still allied with enemies.{{sfnp|Carr|1985|pages=170-172}}

==Constituent Assembly and White Armies==
The All-Russian Constituent Assembly Committee had the support of the [[Czechoslovak Legions]] and was able to spread its authority over much of the [[Volga]]-[[Kama River|Kama]] region. However, most of the Siberia and Urals regions were controlled by a patchwork of ethnic, [[Cossack]], military and liberal-rightist local governments, which constantly clashed with the Committee. The Committee functioned until September 1918, eventually growing to about 90 Constituent Assembly members, when The State Conference representing all the anti-Bolshevik local governments from the Volga to the Pacific Ocean formed the coalition of [[Provisional All-Russian Government]] (aka the Ufa Directory) with the ultimate goal of re-convening the Constituent Assembly once the circumstances permitted:

{{quote|2. In its activities the government will be unswervingly guided by the indisputable supreme rights of the Constituent Assembly. It will tirelessly ensure that the actions of all organs subordinate to the Provisional Government do not in any way tend to infringe the rights of the Constituent Assembly or hinder its resumption of work.&lt;br&gt;3. It will present an account of its activities to the Constituent Assembly as soon as the Constituent Assembly declares that it has resumed operation. It will subordinate itself unconditionally to the Constituent Assembly, as the only supreme authority in the country.&lt;ref name="samara"&gt;Both quotes from the "Constitution of the Ufa Directory", first published in ''Narodovlastie'', No. 1, 1918, reprinted in ''Istoriya Rossii 1917 - 1940'', Ekaterinburg, 1993, pp. 102 - 105, English translation available [http://www.uea.ac.uk online]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The All-Russian Constituent Assembly Committee continued functioning as "Congress of Members of the Constituent Assembly" but had no real power, although the Directory pledged to support it:

{{quote|All possible assistance to the Congress of Members of the Constituent Assembly, operating as a legal state organ, in its independent work of ensuring the relocation of members of the Constituent Assembly, hastening and preparing the resumption of activity by the Constituent Assembly in its present composition&lt;ref name="samara" /&gt;}}

Initially, the agreement had the support of the Socialist Revolutionary Central Committee which delegated two of its right-wing members, Avksentiev and Zenzinov, to the five member Ufa Directory. However, when [[Victor Chernov]] arrived in Samara on September 19, 1918, he was able to persuade the Central Committee to withdraw support from the Directory because he viewed it as too conservative and the SR presence there as insufficient.&lt;ref name="ufa"&gt;See Michael Melancon. "Chernov", in ''Critical Companion to the Russian Revolution 1914-1921'', op.cit., p.137&lt;/ref&gt; This put the Directory in a political vacuum and two months later, in November 1918, The [[Provisional Government of Autonomous Siberia|Social Revolutionary-Menshevik Provisional Government of Autonomous Siberia]] was overthrown in the military ''[[coup d'etat]]''. Kolchak had returned to Omsk on November 16 from an inspection tour. He was approached and refused to take power. On November 18, 1918, Ufa Directory was overthrown by rightwing officers who made [[Alexander Kolchak]] the new Supreme Ruler (''Verkhovnyi Pravitel''), and he promoted himself to [[Admiral]]. The [[Socialist-Revolutionary Party|Socialist-Revolutionary]] (SR) Directory leader and members were arrested on November 18 by a troop of [[Cossack]]s under [[ataman]] [[I. N. Krasilnikov]]. The remaining cabinet members met and voted for Kolchak to become the head of government with dictatorial powers. The arrested SR politicians were expelled from Siberia and ended up in Europe. After the fall of the Ufa Directory, Chernov formulated what he called the "third path" against both the Bolsheviks and the liberal-rightist [[White Movement]], but the SRs' attempts to assert themselves as an independent force were unsuccessful and the party, always fractious, began to disintegrate. On the Right, [[Avksentiev]] and [[Vladimir Zenzinov]] went abroad with Kolchak's permission. On the Left, some SRs became reconciled with the Bolsheviks. The SR leaders in Russia denounced Kolchak and called for him to be killed. Victor Chernov tried to stage an uprising against Kolchak. Their activities resulted in the [[Omsk]] Uprising on December 22, 1918, which was put down by [[Cossacks]], who summarily executed almost 500 revolutionaries.

===Mensheviks and the Democratic Republic of Georgia===
[[File:Noe Schordania.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Noe Zhordania]]]]
Mensheviks took power in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and in 1918 the [[Democratic Republic of Georgia]] was proclaimed with [[Noe Zhordania]] becoming the head. The area was forcefully sovietized by February 25, 1921. Lenin recommended "a policy of concessions in relation to the Georgian [[intelligentsia]] and small traders" and "a coalition with Noe Zhordania or similar Georgian Mensheviks". Most Menshevik leaders fled to [[Paris]].{{sfnp|Carr|1985|page=339-350}}

===Reinstatement of SRs===
In January 1919 the SR Central Committee decided that the Bolsheviks were the lesser of two evils and gave up armed struggle against them. The SRs opened negotiations with the Bolsheviks and in February 1919 the SR People's Army joined with the [[Red Army]]. The VTsIK resolved on February 25, 1919 to reinstate the SRs except those who continued to directly or indirectly support counterrevolution.{{sfnp|Carr|1985|page=172}}

===Further repression===
In [[Astrakhan]], the strikers and Red Army soldiers who joined them were loaded onto barges and then thrown by the hundreds into the [[Volga]] with stones around their necks.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} Between 2,000 and 4,000 were shot or drowned from March 12 to 14, 1919.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} In addition, the repression also claimed the lives of some 600 to 1,000 [[bourgeoisie]]. Recently published archival documents{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} indicate this was the largest [[Wiktionary:massacre|massacre]] of workers by the Bolsheviks before the suppression of the [[Kronstadt rebellion]].{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

On March 16, 1919, Cheka stormed the [[Putilov factory]].{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} More than 900 workers who went to a strike were arrested. More than 200 of them were executed without trial during next few days.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} Numerous strikes took place in the spring of 1919 in cities of [[Tula, Russia|Tula]], [[Oryol|Orel]], [[Tver]], [[Ivanovo]], and [[Astrakhan]]. The starving workers sought to obtain food rations matching those of Red Army soldiers. They also demanded the elimination of privileges for Communists, freedom of press, and free elections. All strikes were mercilessly suppressed by Cheka using arrests and executions.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

===SR disbanded ===
The Bolsheviks let the SR Central Committee re-establish itself in Moscow and start publishing a party newspaper in March 1919.&lt;ref name="ref1919"&gt;See Ronald Grigor Suny. ''The Soviet Experiment: Russia, the USSR, and the Successor States'', Oxford University Press, 1998, {{ISBN|0-19-508105-6}} p.80&lt;/ref&gt; After the defeat of White Army in Russia, the party tried to reorganise and to retake contacts with its provincial organisations; despite numerous requests from party sections in East Russia and by exiled members in Europe, the Central Committee refused to take armed action against the Bolsheviks, and also supported them in the ensuing war against Poland. These decisions were confirmed by the Tenth Party Council in 1920. Despite that, Lenin accused the party of cooperation with counter-revolutionary forces and SR Central Committee members were arrested. Chernov went undercover and eventually was forced to flee Russia and the party was officially banned in 1921, after the Tenth Congress of Russian Communist Party (bolshevik).

===Repression===
A typical report from a Cheka department stated: "[[Yaroslavl]] Province, 23 June 1919. The uprising of deserters in the Petropavlovskaya ''volost'' has been put down. The families of the deserters have been taken as hostages. When we started to shoot one person from each family, the [[Green armies|Greens]] began to come out of the woods and surrender. Thirty-four deserters were shot as an example".

===SR trial===
The imprisoned SR Central Committee members were put on trial starting June 8, 1922.&lt;ref name="ref1922"&gt;See Elizabeth A. Wood. ''Performing Justice: Agitation Trials in Early Soviet Russia'', Cornell University Press, 2005, {{ISBN|0-8014-4257-5}}, p.83&lt;/ref&gt; The trial was the first of the many political trials of Soviet Russia and ended with twelve death sentences and several years of hard labour sentences.

The death sentences were temporarily suspended by the government, despite Lenin requests to proceed with executions immediately.

==Other revolts==
{{undue weight|section|date=October 2015}}
{{cleanup reorganize|section|date=October 2015}}
The first large CHEKA action against alleged anarchists where people were killed was in mid April 1918 in Petrograd. Then at the end of April and beginning of May coordinated CHEKIST attacks against alleged anarchists were launched in both Petrograd and Moscow. ( P. Avrich. G. Maximoff. ) These violent attacks without warning from the Bolsheviks forced anarchists underground and prompted measured retaliation by them in self-defense.  Anarchists in [[Rostov]], [[Ekaterinoslav]] and [[Briansk]] broke into prisons to liberate the prisoners and issued fiery proclamations calling on the people to revolt against the Bolshevik regime. The Anarchist Battle Detachments attacked the [[White movement|Whites]], Reds and Germans alike. Many peasants joined the revolt, attacking their enemies with pitchforks and sickles. Meanwhile, in Moscow, the [[Underground Anarchists]] were formed by [[Kazimir Kovalevich]] and [[Piotr Sobolev]] to be the shock troops of their revolution, infiltrating Bolshevik ranks and striking when least expected. On 25 September 1919, the Underground Anarchists struck the Bolsheviks with "their heaviest blow against the 'oppressors'".&lt;ref name="avrich2006"&gt;Avrich, Paul - [https://books.google.com/books?id=5pqSkSgKacAC&amp;pg=PA188&amp;lpg=PA188&amp;dq=%22heaviest+blow%22+%22underground+anarchists%22 The Russian Anarchists] 2006 AK Press, p 188&lt;/ref&gt; The headquarters of the Moscow Committee of the Communist Party was blown up, killing 12 and injuring 55 Party members, including [[Nikolai Bukharin]] and [[Emilian Iaroslavskii]]. Spurred on by their apparent success, the Underground Anarchists proclaimed a new "era of dynamite" that would finally wipe away capitalism and the State.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} The Bolsheviks responded by initiating a new wave of mass repression in which Kovalevich and Sobolev were the first to be shot.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} The remaining Underground Anarchists blew themselves up in their last battle with the [[Cheka]],{{when|date=February 2014}} taking much of their safe house with them.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

===Further repression===
However, strikes continued. In January 1920, Lenin sent a telegram to [[Izhevsk]] telling that "I am surprised that you are taking the matter so lightly and are not immediately executing large numbers of strikers for the crime of [[sabotage]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Wilson's War: How Woodrow Wilson's Great Blunder Led to Hitler, Lenin, Stalin and World War II|first=Jim|last=Powell|publisher=Crown Publishing Group|date=29 March 2005|page=206|isbn=1400082366|author-link=Jim Powell (historian)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June&amp;nbsp;1920, female workers in [[Tula, Russia|Tula]] who refused to work on Sunday were arrested and sent to [[labor camp]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|isbn=0300067062|title=The Bolsheviks in Russian Society: The Revolution and the Civil Wars|editor-first=Vladimir N.|editor-last=Brovkin|date=1997|publisher=Yale University|page=216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Workers opposition===
[[File:Shliapnikov-alexander.jpg|thumb|right|[[Alexander Shlyapnikov]]]]
[[File:AlexandraKollontai.jpg|thumb|left|[[Alexandra Kollontai]]]]
Around 1920 [[Alexander Shlyapnikov]], [[Sergei Medvedev (revolutionary)|Sergei Medvedev]] and other trade-unionists of working class origins formed a left-wing faction within the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] that became known as the [[Workers' Opposition]]. In 1921 it gained support from [[Alexandra Kollontai]], who published a pamphlet entitled ''The workers' opposition'', as well. The new faction had some similar demands to some of the rebellions, but supported the government and argued peacefully within it rather than resorting to violent uprisings. Instead the Workers Opposition energetically supported the crushing of these rebellions, including volunteering government representatives to participate in the crushing of the Kronstadt Rebellion. After the Kronstadt Rebellion, Lenin argued that the party needed unity at that time because their enemies were trying to exploit disunity. The Workers' Opposition and other factions were dissolved, but the leaders of the two main factions Workers Opposition and Democratic Centralists were included in the new leadership.

===Tyumen revolt===
In January 1921, the largest uprising&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kommersant.com/t-75/r_5/n_419/Tyumen_Region/ Kommersant - Russia's Daily Online&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; in Russia since the civil war broke out. Insurgents blocked the railway, occupied [[Tobolsk]], [[Surgut]], [[Berezovo]], and [[Salekhard]], stormed [[Ishim, Tyumen Oblast|Ishim]], and came within four km of [[Tyumen]]. Both sides fought a battle of unprecedented savagery.  {{dubious|date=February 2010}} Regular [[Red Army]] units using [[armored train]]s, [[warship]]s, and other means took part in suppressing the uprising, which was finally crushed only in 1922.

===Revolutionary Insurrectionary (Anarchist) Army===
[[File:Makhno group.jpg|thumb|right|[[Simon Karetnik]], [[Batko Makhno]], and [[Fedir Shchus|Fedir Szczus]] (Fedor Shchus)]]
[[The Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine]] or Anarchist Black Army led by anarchist and former Red Army leader [[Nestor Makhno]] took control of most of the southern Ukraine and Crimea after its abandonment by Red Army troops in 1919. Makhno's forces fought on the side of the Bolsheviks and played an important role in the eventual defeat of the White Armies.  However, they were at odds with the Bolshevik view of a unitary Bolshevik dominated political movement.  Occasionally Makhno's Black Army troops fought Red Army forces, whom the Ukrainian anarchists had viewed with mistrust after Chekist and Red Army raids on anarchist centers, including arrests, detentions, and executions commencing in May 1918.

For his part, Makhno stated his support for "free worker-peasant soviets"&lt;ref name="RIAdeclaration"&gt;[http://www.ditext.com/arshinov/appendix.html Declaration Of The Revolutionary Insurgent Army Of The Ukraine (Makhnovist)]. Peter Arshinov, [http://www.ditext.com/arshinov/makhno.html History of the Makhnovist Movement (1918-1921), 1923.] Black &amp; Red, 1974&lt;/ref&gt; independent of centralized control by Moscow.  Makhno, a rural anarchist, viewed the Bolsheviks as urban dictators out-of-touch with the people, opposing the Bolshevik-controlled  "[[Cheka]] [secret police]... and similar compulsory authoritative and disciplinary institutions".  He called for "[f]reedom of speech, press, assembly, unions and the like".&lt;ref name="RIAdeclaration" /&gt; In practice, Makhno's Anarchist Black Army, the ''Anarchist Revolutionary Military Council'', and the Ukrainian anarchists' political arm, the ''Congress of the Confederation of Anarchists Groups'' (''NABAT'') formed an overall government over the [[Free Territory (Ukraine)|area they controlled]], though they did permit local self-governing autonomous committees of peasants.  Like the Red Army, they used forced conscription and summary executions, though as a relatively popular native Ukrainian movement, these measures were not used on the same scale as that of the Bolshevik Red Army.&lt;ref name="avrich1988"&gt;Avrich, Paul. [https://books.google.com/books?id=hOd0-HITuhEC&amp;pg=PA111&amp;dq=%22anarchist+portraits%22+makhno#PPA118,M1 Anarchist Portraits], 1988 Princeton University Press&lt;/ref&gt;  In the areas under his military control, the ''Anarchist Revolutionary Military Council'' banned all opposition parties&lt;ref name="RIAdeclaration" /&gt;(,&lt;ref name="avrich1988" /&gt; 119), and like the Bolsheviks, used two [[secret police]] counter-intelligence forces: the [[Razedka]] and the [[Kommissiya Protivmakhnovskikh Del]].&lt;ref name="footman1961"&gt;Footman, David. [[iarchive:civilwarinrussia000722mbp|Civil War In Russia]] Frederick A. Praeger 1961, p. 287&lt;/ref&gt;

Some members of the Bolshevik Central Committees considered allowing an independent area for Makhno's libertarian experiment,&lt;ref name="avrich1988" /&gt; an idea fiercely opposed by both Lenin and [[Leon Trotsky]], War Commissar of the [[Red Army]].  After each successful repulse of White Army forces, Trotsky ordered fresh attacks against Makhno and the Anarchist Black Army, halting only when White forces threatened to once again defeat the Red Army in the field.  At the instructions of Moscow, the [[Cheka]] sent two agents to assassinate Makhno in 1920.  After repudiation of two military alliances, and the final defeat of White General Wrangel in the Crimea, Trotsky ordered the mass executions of Makhnovist sympathizers, followed by the liquidation of many of Makhno's subordinate commanders and his entire headquarters staff at a "joint planning conference" in November 1920.  By August 1921, Makhno and the remainder of the Anarchist Black Army had been forced into exile.

===Revolts against grain requisitioning===
SRs were among the main leaders of the uprisings of the [[Tambov Rebellion]] and the [[Kronstadt Rebellion]] of 1921. Protests against grain requisitioning of the peasantry were a major component of these uprisings and Lenin's New Economic Program was introduced as a concession.

===Kronstadt Rebellion===
{{main|Kronstadt rebellion}}
The [[Kronstadt rebellion]] was led by (,&lt;ref&gt;[[Voline]], La Révolution Inconnue, Tome 2&lt;/ref&gt; 95) Social-Revolutionary [[Stepan Petrichenko]]. He initiated the change from a protest to an open rebellion by spreading a false rumor that the Bolsheviks were coming to arrest everyone(,&lt;ref name="avrich1974" /&gt; 85). The rebels called for free elections to regional councils (soviets) and an end to grain requisitioning.

[[File:Anarkistimatruuseja.jpg|thumb|Sailors of the battleship [[Russian battleship Petropavlovsk (1911)|''Petropavlovsk'']] in [[Helsinki]]; [[Anarchist flag|black flag]] calls for "death to the [[bourgeoisie]]".]]

Despite protests from notorious anarchists like Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman, the revolt was suppressed by Bolsheviks.

===Numerous minor rebellions===
Numerous attacks and assassinations occurred frequently until these rebellions finally petered out in 1922. Anarchists participated in almost all of the attacks the Left SR's organized, and carried out many on their own initiative. The most celebrated figures of these rebellions, [[Lev Chernyi]] and [[Fanya Baron]] were both Anarchists.

===Results===
The end result of these rebellions was the suppression of rival socialist parties and anarchists, and economic concessions from the Bolsheviks with the [[New Economic Policy]].

[[Menshevik|Menshevism]] were suppressed after the Kronstadt Uprising and the forceful sovietization of Menshevik Georgia. A number of prominent Mensheviks emigrated thereafter. [[Julius Martov]] who was suffering from ill health at this time went to [[Weimar Republic]].

The Left SRs collapsed as a party by 1922 and existed as small cells through 1925.

==Later claims==
During the [[Moscow Trials]] in 1937, it was claimed that [[Leon Trotsky]], [[Lev Kamenev]], and [[Grigory Zinoviev]] were involved in the Left SR uprising.&lt;ref name="spitzer1990"&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2505202 John Dewey, the "Trial" of Leon Trotsky and the Search for Historical Truth]. History and Theory, Vol. 29, No. 1 (Feb., 1990), pp. 16-37&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Iurii Georgievich Fel'shtinskii]] claimed the Left SR Uprising was staged by the Bolsheviks as a pretext to discredit the Left SRs. [[L. M. Ovrutskii]] and [[Anatolii Izrailevich Razgon]] produced research to refute this.&lt;ref name="boniece2004"&gt;Boniece, Sally A. - [https://muse.jhu.edu/journals/kritika/v005/5.1boniece.html link "Don Quixotes of the Revolution"?

[[File:Houghton AC8 Sn612 825h - Liberty Tree.jpg|thumb|The Liberty Tree in Boston, as illustrated in 1825]]

The '''Liberty Tree''' (1646–1775) was a famous [[elm tree]] that stood in Boston near [[Boston Common]], in the years before the [[American Revolution]]. In 1765, colonists in Boston staged the first act of defiance against the British government at the tree. The tree became a rallying point for the growing resistance to the rule of Britain over the [[Thirteen Colonies|American colonies]], and the ground surrounding it became known as '''Liberty Hall'''. The Liberty Tree was felled by [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]] Nathaniel Coffin Jr. in August 1775.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.ca/books?id=oIjjAd6vOOoC&amp;pg=PT302&amp;lpg=PT302&amp;dq=Nathaniel+Coffin+Jr.+(and+his+wife+Elizabeth+Barnes)&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=yMF2yZLd1x&amp;sig=nKgbsyK5wqA9N6ga5iXzOtwUSs4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwicw5Kpw_DZAhVPcq0KHePSCkYQ6AEIODAD#v=onepage&amp;q=Nathaniel%20Coffin%20Jr.%20(and%20his%20wife%20Elizabeth%20Barnes)&amp;f=false  The Loyalists of Massachusetts And the Other Side of the American Revolution By James Henry Stark]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Stamp Act protests===
[[File:Liberty Tree.jpg|thumb|"The Colonists Under Liberty Tree," ''Cassell's Illustrated History of England'', 1865.]]
{{main|Stamp Act 1765#Protests in the streets}}

In 1765 the British government imposed a [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act]] on the American colonies. It required all legal documents, permits, commercial contracts, newspapers, pamphlets, and playing cards in the American colonies to carry a [[stamp duty|tax stamp]]. Colonists were outraged. In Boston, a group of local businessmen calling themselves the [[Loyal Nine]] began meeting in secret to plan a series of protests against the Stamp Act.&lt;ref name="museum"&gt;{{cite web |website=Boston Tea Party Ships &amp; Museum |title=The Loyal Nine of Boston: The Predecessors of the Sons of Liberty |url=https://www.bostonteapartyship.com/loyal-nine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 14, 1765, a crowd gathered in Boston under a large oak tree at the corner of Essex Street and Washington Street (then called Orange Street) to protest the hated Stamp Act. Hanging from the tree was a straw-stuffed effigy labeled "A. O." for [[Andrew Oliver]], the colonist chosen by [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] to impose the Stamp Act. Beside it hung a British cavalry [[jackboot]], its sole painted green. This second effigy represented the two British ministers who were considered responsible for the Stamp Act: the [[Earl of Bute]] (the boot being a pun on "Bute") and Lord [[George Grenville]] (the green being a pun on "Grenville").&lt;ref name="young2012"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Young |first1=Alfred F. |authorlink=Alfred F. Young |title=Revolutionary Founders: Rebels, Radicals, and Reformers in the Making of the Nation |publisher=Knopf Doubleday |date=2012 |isbn=9780307455994 |chapter=Ebenezer Mackintosh: Boston's Captain General of the Liberty Tree |pages=15–34 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lx9ns8drpWwC&amp;pg=PA15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peering up from inside the boot was a small devil figure, holding a copy of the Stamp Act and bearing a sign that read, "What Greater Joy did ever New England see / Than a Stampman hanging on a Tree!"&lt;ref name="smithsonian"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=[[Smithsonian Magazine]] |title=The Story Behind a Forgotten Symbol of the American Revolution: The Liberty Tree |last1=Trickey |first1=Erick |date=May 19, 2016 |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/story-behind-forgotten-symbol-american-revolution-liberty-tree-180959162/}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first public show of defiance against the Crown and spawned the resistance that led to the [[American Revolutionary War]] 10 years later.

The tree became a central gathering place for protesters, and the ground surrounding it became popularly known as Liberty Hall.&lt;ref name="drake"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Drake |first1=Samuel Adams |authorlink=Samuel Adams Drake |title=Old Landmarks and Historic Personages of Boston. Profusely Illustrated. |publisher=J. R. Osgood |date=1873 |chapter=Liberty Tree and the Neighborhood |pages=396–415 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=B1pDAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA396}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[liberty pole]] was installed nearby with a flag that could be raised above the tree to summon the townspeople to a meeting. [[Ebenezer Mackintosh]], a shoemaker who handled much of the hands-on work of hanging effigies and leading angry mobs, became known as "Captain General of the Liberty Tree."&lt;ref name="young2012" /&gt; [[Paul Revere]] included the Liberty Tree in an engraving, "A View of the Year 1765."&lt;ref name="smithsonian" /&gt;

When the Stamp Act was repealed in 1766, townspeople gathered at the Liberty Tree to celebrate. They decorated the tree with flags and streamers, and when evening fell, hung dozens of lanterns from its branches.&lt;ref name="smithsonian" /&gt; A copper sign was fastened to the trunk which read, "This tree was planted in the year 1646, and pruned by order of the Sons of Liberty, Feb. 14th, 1766."&lt;ref name="drake" /&gt; Soon colonists in other towns, from [[Newport, Rhode Island]] to [[Charleston, South Carolina]], began naming their own liberty trees, and the Tree of Liberty became a familiar symbol of the American Revolution.&lt;ref name="young2012" /&gt;

===Other protests===
[[File:Philip_Dawe_(attributed),_The_Bostonians_Paying_the_Excise-man,_or_Tarring_and_Feathering_(1774)_-_02.jpg|thumb|The Sons of Liberty tarring and feathering John Malcolm under the Liberty Tree]]
The Loyal Nine eventually became part of a larger group, the [[Sons of Liberty]].&lt;ref name="museum" /&gt; They continued to use the Liberty Tree as a gathering place for protests, leading [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|loyalist]] [[Peter Oliver (loyalist)|Peter Oliver]] to write bitterly in 1781,

&lt;blockquote&gt;This Tree stood in the Town, &amp; was consecrated for an Idol for the Mob to Worship; it was properly the ''Tree ordeal'', where those, whom the Rioters pitched upon as State delinquents, were carried to for Trial, or brought to as the Test of political Orthodoxy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Oliver |first1=Peter |authorlink=Peter Oliver (loyalist) |title=Peter Oliver's Origin &amp; Progress of the American Rebellion: A Tory View |publisher=Stanford University Press |origyear=1781 |date=1967 |isbn=9780804706018 |page=54 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=08IL5DO_q94C&amp;pg=PA54}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During the [[Liberty Riot]] of 1768, to protest the seizure of [[John Hancock]]'s ship by the Royal Navy, townspeople dragged a customs commissioner's boat out of the harbor all the way to the Liberty Tree, where it was condemned at a mock trial and burned on Boston Common. Two years later, a funeral procession for the victims of the [[Boston Massacre]] passed by the tree.&lt;ref name="smithsonian" /&gt; It was also the site of protests against the [[Tea Act]]. In 1774, a customs official and staunch loyalist named [[John Malcolm (Loyalist)|John Malcolm]] was stripped to the waist, [[tarred and feathered]], and forced to announce his resignation under the tree.&lt;ref name="young2001"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Young |first1=Alfred F. |authorlink=Alfred F. Young |title=The Shoemaker and the Tea Party: Memory and the American Revolution |publisher=Beacon Press |date=2001 |isbn=9780807071427 |pages=49, 118 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dYcDAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA49}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, [[Thomas Paine]] published an [[:s:Liberty Tree|ode to the Liberty Tree]] in the ''[[Pennsylvania Gazette]]''.&lt;ref name="smithsonian" /&gt;

In the years leading up to the war, the British made the Liberty Tree an object of ridicule. British soldiers [[tarring and feathering|tarred and feathered]] a man named Thomas Ditson, and forced him to march in front of the tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=American Archives, Northern Illinois University |title=Deposition of Thomas Ditson |url=http://amarch.lib.niu.edu/islandora/object/niu-amarch%3A105673}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Siege of Boston]], a party of British soldiers and Loyalists led by Job Williams cut the tree down, knowing what it represented to the patriots, and used it for firewood.&lt;ref name="drake" /&gt; (Later, in the [[Raid on Charlottetown (1775)]], American privateers would seek revenge against the man who cut the tree down, Loyalist Nathaniel Coffin Jr.)

Following the British [[Siege of Boston#Evacuation|evacuation]] in 1776, patriots returning to Boston erected a [[liberty pole]] at the site. For many years the tree stump was used as a reference point by local citizens, similar to the [[Boston Stone]].&lt;ref name="young2001" /&gt; During an 1825 tour of Boston, the [[Marquis de Lafayette]] declared, "The world should never forget the spot where once stood Liberty Tree, so famous in your annals."&lt;ref name="smithsonian" /&gt;

==Memorials==
[[File:LibertyTree2.jpg|thumb|Marker at the site where the Liberty Tree once stood]]

At the [[1964 New York World's Fair]] a sculpture of the tree designed by Albert Surman was a featured exhibit in the New England Pavilion. When the [[Liberty Tree Mall]] was opened in 1972, the sculpture was installed at center court.

In October 1966, the ''Boston Herald'' began running stories pointing out that the only commemoration of the Liberty Tree site was a grimy plaque, installed in the 1850s,&lt;ref name="smithsonian" /&gt; on a building three stories above what is now the intersection of Essex and Washington Streets, a block east of the Boston Common. Reporter [[Ronald Kessler]] found that the plaque was covered with bird droppings and obscured by a Kemp's hamburger sign. Local guidebooks did not mention it.&lt;ref name="herald66"&gt;''Boston Herald'', October 2, 1966, Section One.&lt;/ref&gt;

To call attention to how obscure the site had become, Kessler interviewed waitresses at the Essex Delicatessen below the plaque on Washington Street. None knew what the Liberty Tree was. "The Liberty Tree? That's a roast beef sandwich with a slice of Bermuda onion, Russian dressing, and a side of potato salad," said one waitress who had worked beneath the plaque for 20 years.&lt;ref name="herald66" /&gt;

[[File:LibertyTree3.jpg|thumb|left|Bronze plaque on sidewalk]]Kessler persuaded then Massachusetts Governor [[John A. Volpe]] to visit the site. A photo of Volpe examining the plaque from a fire engine ladder appeared on page one of the 6 October 1966 edition of the ''Boston Herald''.&lt;ref&gt;''Boston Herald'', October 6, 1966, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kessler, Volpe promised to preserve the site in the form of a park with monuments, and "Edward J. Logue, the administrator of the Boston Redevelopment Authority, said the park would be a 'handsome, open space' with grass, benches, plaques explaining the history of the tree, and 'the largest elm tree that can be transported and is resistant to Dutch elm disease.' ... That promise was never fulfilled." Kessler explored the subject further and presented the entire history of the Liberty Tree in "America Must Remember Boston's Liberty Tree".&lt;ref name="libertytree"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsmax.com/RonaldKessler/America-Boston-Liberty-Tree/2011/10/03/id/413067|title=America Must Remember Boston's Liberty Tree|publisher=Newsmax|last=Kessler|first=Ronald|date=October 3, 2011|accessdate=December 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, funding was approved for a small park at Washington and Essex, which at that time was part of an area known as the [[Combat Zone, Boston|Combat Zone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Yudis|first1=Anthony|title=Lots and Blocks/Something new for the Combat Zone—Liberty Tree Park|url=https://secure.pqarchiver.com/boston/doc/840765040.html?FMT=AI&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Apr+21%2C+1974&amp;author=Yudis%2C+Anthony&amp;pub=Boston+Globe+%281960-1982%29&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=&amp;desc=LOTS+AND+BLOCKS|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=April 21, 1974 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plans to plant trees there had to be scrapped because there were too many underground utilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jones|first1=Arthur|title=Downtown Boston planting runs into $1 million problem|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/boston/doc/612929489.html?FMT=AI&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Jun+6%2C+1974&amp;author=Jones%2C+Arthur&amp;pub=Boston+Globe+%281960-1982%29&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=&amp;desc=Downtown+Boston+planting+runs+into+%241+million+problem|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=June 6, 1974 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Boston Redevelopment Authority ultimately placed a small bronze plaque in the sidewalk across the street from the bas relief plaque. The plaque bears the inscription "SONS OF LIBERTY, 1766; INDEPENDENCE of their COUNTRY, 1776."&lt;ref name="libertytree" /&gt;

Boston's [[Old State House (Boston)|Old State House]] museum houses a remnant of the flag that flew above the Liberty Tree, and one of the original lanterns that were hung from the tree during the Stamp Act repeal celebration in 1766.&lt;ref name="smithsonian" /&gt;

==Other trees==

Many other towns designated their own Liberty Trees. Most have been lost over time, although [[Randolph, New Jersey]] claims a white oak Liberty Tree dating to 1720.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.randolphnj.org/news/liberty_tree |title=Randolph's Liberty Tree to Live On |date=13 March 2014 |publisher=Township of Randolph |accessdate=18 August 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6RuGtMGlF?url=http://www.randolphnj.org/news/liberty_tree |archivedate=18 August 2014 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 400-year-old [[tulip poplar]] stood on the grounds of [[St. John's College (Annapolis/Santa Fe)|St. John's College]] in [[Annapolis, Maryland]] until 1999, when it was felled after [[Hurricane Floyd]] caused irreparable damage to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=October 25, 1999 |title=Liberty Tree Is Felled |last1=Morley |first1=Jefferson}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Liberty Tree in [[Acton, Massachusetts]], was an elm tree that lasted until about 1925. In 1915, knowing that the Liberty Tree was getting older, Acton students planted the Peace Tree, a maple that still stands today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=Acton Historical Society |title=Liberty Tree Site and Simon Hunt Farm |url=http://www.actonhistoricalsociety.org/liberty-tree-site.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Arbres de la liberté'' ("Liberty Trees"), inspired by the American example, were a symbol of the [[French Revolution]], the first being planted in 1790 by a pastor of a [[Vienne]] village, inspired by the Liberty Tree of Boston. The last surviving liberty elm in France from c.1790 still stands in the parish of La Madeleine at [[Faycelles]], in the Département de Lot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=GiuseppeMusolino.it |title='L'olmo, l'albero della libertà |language=Italian |url=http://www.giuseppemusolino.it/?p=232}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Liberty Tree was also planted in Dam Square in [[Amsterdam]] on January 19, 1795, in celebration of the alliance between the French Republic and the [[Batavian Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=Rijksmuseum.nl |title=1795-1806 Liberty Tree |url=https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/rijksstudio/timeline-dutch-history/1795-1806-batavian-republic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1798, with the establishing of the short-lived [[Roman Republic (18th century)|Roman Republic]], such a tree was also planted in Rome's [[Piazza delle Scole]], to mark the legal abolition of the [[Roman Ghetto]] (which was, however, re-instated with the resumption of Papal rule). The last surviving liberty elm in Italy, planted in 1799 to celebrate the new [[Parthenopean Republic]], stood until recently in [[Montepaone]], [[Calabria]]. The tree was badly damaged in a storm in 2008 and has been replaced by a clone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=Calabria Online |title=L'Olmo Storico di Montepaone, Ultimo Albero della Libertà |language=Italian  |url=http://www.calabriaonline.com/specialecol/rubriche/storia_e_curiosita/olmo_di_montepaone.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As students at the [[Tübinger Stift]], the German philosopher [[Georg Hegel]] and his friend [[Friedrich Schelling]] planted a liberty tree on the outskirts of [[Tübingen]], Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Plant |first1=Raymond |title=Hegel |publisher=Routledge |date=2013 |isbn=9781136526329 |page=51 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MF3obXsPBpYC&amp;pg=PT51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- This paragraph should logically go at the end, after any mentions of actual trees. --&gt;Besides actual trees, the term "Tree of Liberty" is associated with a quotation from a 1787 letter written by [[Thomas Jefferson]] to [[William Stephens Smith]]: "The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=American History from Revolution to Reconstruction and Beyond |title=To William S.

The '''Long Island serial killer''' (also referred to as '''LISK''', the '''Gilgo Beach Killer''' or the '''Craigslist Ripper''') is an unidentified suspected [[serial killer]] who is believed to have murdered 10 to 16 people associated with [[prostitution]], over a period of nearly 20 years, and dumped their bodies along the [[Ocean Parkway (Long Island)|Ocean Parkway]], near the remote [[Long Island, New York|Long Island]], [[New York (state)|New York]] beach towns of [[Gilgo, New York|Gilgo]] and [[Oak Beach, New York|Oak Beach]] in [[Suffolk County, New York|Suffolk County]], and the area of [[Jones Beach State Park]] in [[Nassau County, New York|Nassau County]]. The remains of four victims were found in December 2010, while six more sets of remains were found in March and April 2011.&lt;ref name=WNYW&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.myfoxny.com/dpp/news/8-sets-of-remains-recovered-from-beach-20110404|title=8 Sets Of Remains Now Found On Beach|work=[[WNYW]]|accessdate=April 4, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110407094557/http://www.myfoxny.com/dpp/news/8-sets-of-remains-recovered-from-beach-20110404|archivedate=April 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FoxNews&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2011/04/04/search-resumes-new-york-beach-victims-online-escort-murders|title=3 More Sets of Human Remains Found on New York Beach|work=[[Fox News]]|accessdate=April 9, 2016|date=April 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='cbs'&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2011/04/11/investigators-of-gilgo-beach-victims-expand-search-on-l-i|title=Cops Confirm New Remains Human; Skull Also Found Along Ocean Parkway|work=CBS |location=New York|date=April 11, 2011|accessdate=April 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police believe the latest sets of remains predate the four bodies found in December 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2011/04/13/latest-remains-ny-beach-victims-long-island-serial-killer-726616671/ |title=Latest Remains Found on N.Y.

==Police investigation==
Police were initially searching for Shannan Gilbert, a 24-year-old woman from [[New Jersey]], who was working as an escort and was reported missing on May 1, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Amy Brittain [http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2011/06/jersey_city_prostitute_still_m.html Jersey City prostitute still missing after 13 months of searching], [[New Jersey On-Line]], June 12, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joel Rose, [https://www.npr.org/2011/04/10/135296732/on-long-island-police-search-for-missing-woman On Long Island, Police Search For Missing Woman], npr.org, April 10, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; She was last seen in the Long Island area after she ran from, rather than to, her driver, Michael Pak,&lt;ref name="Newsday"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsday.com/news/breaking/gilbert-vanishing-reaches-one-year-mark-1.2849214|title=Gilbert vanishing reaches one-year mark|author1=Michael Amon |author2=Matthew Chayes |author3=Chau Lam |author4=Paul Larocco |author5=Tania Lopez |author6=Jennifer Smith |author7=Andrew Strickler |publisher=Newsday.com|date=April 30, 2011|accessdate=June 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was waiting for her outside a client's house in nearby Oak Beach.&lt;ref name="Newsday"/&gt;

[[File:Robert Moses Parkway Exit on the Ocean Pkwy.JPG|thumb|Exit for [[Robert Moses Causeway]] on the Ocean Parkway, near where the first body was found]]
In December 2010, a police officer and his dog, on a routine training exercise, discovered the first body: "the skeletal remains of a woman in a nearly disintegrated [[Hessian fabric|burlap]] sack."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/18/nyregion/in-long-island-hunt-for-bodies-key-role-for-officer-and-dog.html "Officer and His Dog Play Key Role in Hunt for Remains"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', April 18, 2011; retrieved April 23, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; This discovery led to three more bodies being found two days later in the same area, on the north side of the Ocean Parkway. [[Suffolk County Police Department (New York)|Suffolk County Police]] [[Police Commissioner|Commissioner]] Richard Dormer said, "Four bodies found in the same location pretty much speaks for itself. It's more than a coincidence. We could have a serial killer."&lt;ref name='abc news'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/long-island-serial-killer-discovery-bodies-beach-raises/story?id=13294531|title=Long Island Serial Killer: Discovery of Three More Bodies on Beach Raises Number of Possible Victims to Eight|publisher=ABC News|date=April 4, 2011|accessdate=April 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few months later, in late March and early April 2011, four more bodies were discovered in another area off the parkway. Suffolk Police expanded the search area up to the Nassau County border, looking for more victims.&lt;ref name='abc local'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/long_island&amp;id=8053594|title=Shannan Gilbert not among new LI bodies, police say|publisher=Abclocal.go.com|date=April 5, 2011|accessdate=April 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 6, Detective Lt. Kevin Smith of the [[Nassau County Police Department]] said that his office will "further explore and investigate any criminal activity which may be in close proximity to the recently discovered human remains found in Suffolk." Smith also said that Nassau County Police will be coordinating with Suffolk County and [[New York State Police]] on the investigation.&lt;ref name='newsday'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsday.com/news/breaking/gilgo-search-to-extend-into-nassau-1.2803585|title=Police expand Gilgo probe into Nassau|publisher=Newsday.com|date=April 6, 2011|accessdate=April 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Five days later, the search for more bodies began in Nassau County. Local media reported that an additional set of partial human remains was found, as well as a separate skull, bringing the potential total number of victims found since December to ten.&lt;ref&gt;[http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/long_island&amp;id=8061689 "More remains found in serial killer investigation"]; retrieved April 11, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; On April 22, two human teeth were found about a foot from the skull.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/04/22/us-serialkiller-newyork-maine-idUSTRE73L3Z020110422 "Human teeth found in serial killer search in New York"], reuters.com; retrieved April 23, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; On June 16, Suffolk County police raised the reward from $5,000 to $25,000 (the largest ever offered in the county's history) for information leading to an arrest in the Long Island murders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2011/CRIME/06/16/new.york.bodies/ "Police raise reward in Long Island serial killer case"]. CNN.com; retrieved June 17, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 20, police released composite sketches of two of the unidentified victims whose remains were found in March and April (an Asian male and Jane Doe No. 6), as well as photos of jewelry found on the remains of a female toddler and her mother, found on April 4 and 11, respectively.&lt;ref name=NYPost&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/two_more_faces_of_death_R3TxB7N7v5l3sBjzlsHbuN|title=Two More Faces of Death:LI detectives release new sketches of victims in hunt for serial slayer|publisher=[[New York Post]]|accessdate=September 24, 2011|first=Selim|last=Algar|date=September 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The toddler's mother was also revealed as one of the sets of remains found in Nassau County on April 11.&lt;ref name=NYPost/&gt; Also on September 20, police revealed that the second set of remains found in Nassau County on April 11 matched two legs that were found in a garbage bag that had washed up on [[Fire Island]] in 1996.&lt;ref name=NYPost/&gt;&lt;ref name=LIPress/&gt; {{As of|2011|9|22|df=us}}, the police had received over 1,200 tips via text, email and phone since the beginning of the investigation.&lt;ref name=LIPress&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.longislandpress.com/2011/09/22/suffolk-cops-getting-tips-in-li-serial-killer-probe|title=Suffolk Cops Getting Tips in LI Serial Killer Probe|publisher=LongIslandPress.com|accessdate=September 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 29, police announced that they believed one person is responsible for all 10 murders, and that the person is almost certainly from Long Island.&lt;ref name="nbcnewyork.com"&gt;[http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Gilgo-Beach-Serial-Killer-Investigation-Theory-Changes-Shannan-Gilbert-134724808.html "Investigators Believe Single Serial Killer Behind Gilgo Beach Bodies"], nbcnewyork.com; retrieved November 30, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; On December 13, the remains of Shannan Gilbert were found in a marsh about half a mile from where she had disappeared; only a week earlier, some of her clothes and belongings had been found in the same vicinity. Police believe that Shannan accidentally drowned after stumbling into a swamp, a view not shared by her mother. She had last been seen banging on a resident's door and screaming for help before running off into the night. A panicked 911 call from Gilbert that night includes her saying that they were going to kill her.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

On December 10, 2015, Suffolk County Police announced that the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] had officially joined the investigation. A spokesperson for the FBI confirmed the announcement. The FBI had previously assisted in the search for victims, but was never officially part of the investigation until this announcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=FBI joins 'Long Island serial killer' investigation|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2015/12/11/fbi-joins-long-island-serial-killer-investigation.html|accessdate=October 9, 2017|work=Fox News|date=December 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 12, 2017, it was announced that Long Island carpenter and convicted murderer [[John Bittrolff]] was a suspect in at least one of the murders attributed to the Long Island Serial killer.&lt;ref name="nydailynews.com"&gt;{{cite news|last=Green|first=Leonard|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/convicted-killer-tied-gilgo-beach-murders-article-1.3490281|title=L.I. convicted killer could be tied to Gilgo Beach murders|date=September 12, 2017|work=New York Daily News|accessdate=October 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Identity of the killer==
There has been much speculation in the media concerning the identity of the killer, currently known as "Unsub" (unknown subject). It has been suggested that the serial killer is most likely a white male in his mid-20s to mid-40s who is very familiar with the South Shore of Long Island and has access to [[Gunny sack|burlap sacks]], which he uses to contain the bodies.&lt;ref name=TimesProfile&gt;{{cite news|title=Bright, Careful and Sadistic: Profiling Long Island's Mystery Serial Killer|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/22/nyregion/long-island-serial-killer-gets-a-personality-profile.html|accessdate=May 15, 2011|first1=Manny|last1=Fernandez|first2=Al|last2=Baker|date=April 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He may have a detailed knowledge of law enforcement techniques, and perhaps even ties to law enforcement, which have thus far helped him avoid detection.&lt;ref name=TimesProfile/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/police-say-new-york-may-have-two-serial-killers-2282119.html "Police say New York may have two serial killers"] [[The Independent]]. Retrieved May 15, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Some have speculated that serial killer and former Long Island resident [[Joel Rifkin]] may have been responsible for some of the older remains found in March and April 2011, as four of the victims' bodies were never found.&lt;ref name=JoelRifkin&gt;{{cite web|title=Rifkin: 'I have nothing to do with' victims|publisher=Newsday.com|url=http://www.newsday.com/news/breaking/rifkin-i-have-nothing-to-do-with-victims-1.2819302|accessdate=May 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an April 2011 prison interview with ''[[Newsday]]'', Rifkin denied having anything to do with recently discovered remains.&lt;ref name=JoelRifkin/&gt;

==Suspects and persons of interest==
'''James Burke'''

On December 15, 2016, the attorney for Shannan Gilbert's family said there was a connection between former Suffolk County Police Chief James Burke and the murders.&lt;ref name="pix11.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pix11.com/2016/12/15/lawyer-theres-connection-between-disgraced-police-chief-james-burke-unsolved-gilgo-beach-murders/|title=Escort claims disgraced ex-Police Chief James Burke linked to unsolved Gilgo Beach murders|date=December 15, 2016|website=pix11.com|accessdate=October 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was rumored that Burke frequently engaged with prostitutes, and one escort came forward claiming that she had "rough sex" with Burke during an Oak Beach party during which she was choked.&lt;ref name="pix11.com"/&gt; It was also revealed that Burke intentionally blocked an FBI probe of the LISK case during his time as police chief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2015/12/12/busted-ex-police-chief-blocked-fbi-probe-of-gilgo-beach-murders/|title=Busted ex-police chief blocked FBI probe of Gilgo Beach murders|date=December 12, 2015|website=nypost.com|accessdate=October 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2016, Burke was sentenced to 46 months in federal prison, along with three years of supervised release, for beating of a man who stole a duffel bag filled with sex toys and pornography from his vehicle. Burke pleaded guilty in February to a civil rights violation and [[obstruction of justice|conspiracy to obstruct justice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pelisek|first1=Christine|title=Former Police Chief James Burke Sentenced to Prison in Suspect's Beating and Cover-Up|url=http://people.com/crime/suffolk-county-police-chief-james-burke-sentenced-prison/|accessdate=December 16, 2016|work=PEOPLE.com|publisher=Time Inc.|date=November 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Bittrolff'''

[[John Bittrolff]], a Suffolk county resident who was convicted of the murders of two prostitutes in 1993 and 1994, and is a suspect in the murder of a third woman from that time period, was named as a suspect in at least one of the LISK murders on September 12, 2017. Suffolk County prosecutor Robert Biancavilla released a statement noting that Bittrolf was likely responsible for the deaths of other women, and that there were similarities between the Gilgo Beach crime scenes and Bittrolff's known murders. Bittrolff was a [[carpentry|carpenter]] who lived in [[Manorville, New York|Manorville]], where the torsos of LISK victims Jessica Taylor and "Jane Doe No. 6" were recovered. The remains were discovered roughly three miles away from Bittrolff's home. He was also a hunter who seemed to enjoy killing and mutilating animals, and reportedly once "cut out the heart of a deer he had just shot and ate it raw in the woods". Neighbors also recalled him killing small animals when he was younger.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.newser.com/article/64ad0c77a9ee4bdf9b1ec54425d42686/prosecutor-convicted-killer-may-be-tied-to-more-ny-slayings.html|title=Prosecutor: Convicted killer may be tied to more NY slayings|author=Frank Eltman|work=Newser}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nydailynews.com"/&gt; Another link between Bittrolff and the LISK case became apparent when it was revealed that the grown daughter of Rita Tangredi, one of Bittrolff's known victims, was reportedly "best friends" with Melissa Barthelemy, one of the Gilgo Beach victims. Barthelemy's mother also reported that Melissa "had a lot of calls to Manorville from her phone" at the time.&lt;ref name="people.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people.com/crime/prosecutor-says-john-bittrolff-long-island-serial-killer/|title=Prosecutor Suggests a N.Y.

'''Joseph Brewer'''

Joseph Brewer, an Oak Beach resident, was one of the last people to see Shannan Gilbert alive. She was hired by Brewer as an escort on the night of her disappearance after posting an ad on [[Craigslist]]. Brewer alleged that shortly after Gilbert arrived at his residence, she began acting erratically before fleeing from his home off into the night. Gilbert was later seen running through Oak Beach, pounding on the doors of homes in Brewer's neighborhood. It was around this time that Gilbert made the phone call to [[9-1-1]] claiming that "they were trying to kill her". However, police did not find any evidence of any wrongdoing, and Brewer was quickly cleared as a suspect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huntakiller.com/blog-articles/2016/11/5/six-years-later-more-questions-than-answers-in-case-of-the-long-island-serial-killer|title=Six Years Later: More Questions than Answers in Case of The Long Island Serial Killer|website=huntakiller.com|accessdate=October 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dr. Peter Hackett'''

Two days after Shannan's disappearance, her mother, Mari Gilbert, received a phone call from Dr. Peter Hackett, an Oak Beach resident and neighbor of Brewer. Hackett allegedly told Mari that he was taking care of Shannan, and that he "ran a home for wayward girls." Five days after Gilbert's disappearance, Hackett made another phone call to Mari in which he vehemently denied ever coming into contact with Shannan, or ever making the phone calls to her mother. However, phone records later confirmed that Hackett called Mari twice following the disappearance. The marshy area where Shannan's remains were eventually found was also noted to be close in proximity to Hackett's backyard. Subsequently, Gilbert's family filed a wrongful death suit against Hackett in November 2012, claiming that he took Shannan into his home that morning and administered drugs to her, facilitating her death. However, it was later revealed that Hackett had a history of inserting himself into, or exaggerating his role in certain major events. This included the embellishment of his role in the investigation of [[TWA Flight 800]]. Police also noted that Hackett's wife and two children were home on the night of Shannan's disappearance, and would have had to have been aware of or complicit in any foul play that went on that night. Police later ruled out Hackett as a suspect in the deaths of Shannan and the LISK victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/4wbegj/ghosts-of-suffolk-county-inside-the-bizarre-unsolved-case-of-the-long-island-serial-killer|title=Inside the Bizarre, Unsolved Case of the Long Island Serial Killer|date=February 3, 2016|website=vice.com|accessdate=October 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''James Bissett'''

Rumors and suspicion grew after the [[suicide]] of local businessman and aquarium owner James Bissett regarding possible links to the LISK case. Bissett killed himself two days after Shannan's remains were found. Speculation grew when it was revealed that Bissett also owned a nursery, and had access to large amounts of burlap. However, police deny that Bissett was ever a [[person of interest]] or a suspect in the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.longislandpress.com/2012/12/16/gilgo-victims-families-frustrated-wonder-if-answers-will-ever-come/|title=Gilgo Victims’ Families Frustrated, Wonder if Answers Will Ever Come - Long Island Press|website=archive.longislandpress.com|accessdate=October 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Victims==

===Bodies discovered in December 2010===
Of the ten bodies or sets of remains found since late 2010, the four discovered in December 2010 have been identified as missing sex workers who all advertised their services on Craigslist. They had all been strangled and their bodies wrapped in burlap sacks before being dumped along Gilgo Beach.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504083_162-20053194-504083.html "Long Island serial killer?

The man claimed that he had just seen Maureen and that she was alive and staying at a “whorehouse in Queens”. He refused to identify himself and could not tell Karnes the location of the “whorehouse”. He told Karnes he would call her back and give her the address, but he never called again. Karnes has stated that the man she spoke to had no discernible New York or Boston accent.
* Melissa Barthelemy, 24, of [[Erie County, New York]], went missing on July 10, 2009. She had been living in the [[Bronx]] and working as an escort through Craigslist.&lt;ref name=wsjblog2011-01-24&gt;{{cite news|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2011/01/24/drawn-to-citys-glamour-cut-down-by-a-serial-killer|title=Drawn to city's glamour, cut down by serial killer|publisher=Wall Street Journal|date=January 24, 2010|accessdate=April 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the night she went missing, she met with a client, deposited $900 in her bank account, and attempted to call an old boyfriend but did not get through. Beginning one week after her disappearance, and lasting for five weeks, her teenage sister, Amanda, received a series of "vulgar, mocking and insulting" calls from someone who may have been the killer using her sister's cell phone. The caller spoke in a low, calm voice, and asked if Amanda "was a whore like her sister." The calls became increasingly disturbing, and eventually culminated in the caller telling Amanda that Melissa was dead, and that he was going to "watch her rot." Police were able to trace some of the calls to [[Madison Square Garden]], midtown [[Manhattan]], and [[Massapequa]], but were unable to determine who was making the calls.&lt;ref name="NYT2011-04-08"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/09/nyregion/09bodies.html|title=Prostitutes' killer seen as versed in police techniques|work=The New York Times|date=April 8, 2011|accessdate=April 9, 2016|first1=William K.|last1=Rashbaum|first2=Joseph|last2=Goldstein}}&lt;/ref&gt; Melissa's mother also noted that there were "a lot of calls to [[Manorville, New York|Manorville]]" from Melissa's phone around the time of her disappearance.&lt;ref name="people.com"/&gt;
* Megan Waterman, 22, of [[South Portland, Maine|South Portland]], [[Maine]], went missing on June 6, 2010, after placing advertisements on Craigslist as an escort. The day before, she had told her 20-year-old boyfriend that she was going out and would call him later.

* Jessica Taylor, 20, most recently of Manhattan, went missing in July 2003.

====Unidentified====
* "Jane Doe No. 6": A human head, right foot, and hands, found on April 4, were determined to have belonged to an unidentified victim, the rest of whose body was found on November 19, 2000, in the same part of Manorville where most of Jessica Taylor's remains were discovered. The victim's torso was found wrapped in garbage bags and dumped in the woods near the intersection of Halsey Manor Rd and Mill Rd, adjacent to a set of power lines and a nearby power line access road. Her right foot had been cut off high above the ankle, possibly to conceal an identifying mark or tattoo. The dismembered remains of Jessica Taylor and "Jane Doe No. 6" were both disposed of in a similar manner and in the same town, suggesting a link. In September 2011, police released a composite sketch of "Jane Doe No. 6": she was  about 5' 2" and was between 18 and 35-years old. It is likely that she worked as a prostitute.&lt;ref name=NYPost/&gt;
* "John Doe": Also discovered on April 4 at Gilgo Beach, very close to where the first four were discovered in December 2010, was the body of what appeared to be a young Asian male who died from blunt-force trauma.&lt;ref name=LIkiller/&gt;&lt;ref name="newsday.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsday.com/long-island/suffolk/bodies-found-at-li-beaches-1.2541830|title=Bodies found at LI beaches|work=Newsday|accessdate=April 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2011, police released a composite sketch of the victim and stated that he had likely been working as a prostitute and was wearing women's clothing at the time of his death.&lt;ref name=NYPost/&gt; He was between 17 and 23 years of age, 5' 6" in height, and missing four teeth; he had been dead for between 5 and 10 years.&lt;ref name=NYPost/&gt; He is believed to have lived as a woman, perhaps being killed when the killer found out he wasn't a cisgender woman, and to have had some kind of musculoskeletal disorder which would have affected his gait.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doenetwork.org/cases/2864umny.html|title=The Doe Network: 2864UMNY|work=doenetwork.org|accessdate=November 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* "[[Peaches (murder victim)|Peaches]]": On June 28, 1997, the dismembered torso of an unidentified young [[African-American]] female was found at [[Hempstead Lake State Park]], in the town of [[Lakeview, New York]]. The torso was found in a green plastic [[Rubbermaid]] container, which was dumped next to a road along the west side of the lake. Investigators reported that the victim had a tattoo of a heart-shaped peach with a bite out of it and two drips falling from its core on her left breast. Then, on April 11, 2011, police in Nassau County discovered dismembered skeletal human remains inside a plastic bag near [[Jones Beach State Park]], nicknamed "Jane Doe No. 3". DNA analysis identified this victim as the mother of "Baby Doe." &lt;ref name=NYT2011/&gt; She was found wearing similar jewelry to "Baby Doe."&lt;ref name=NYPost/&gt; In December 2016, Peaches and Jane Doe No. 3 were positively identified as being the same individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.longislandpress.com/2016/12/13/unidentified-murder-victim-dubbed-peaches-linked-to-gilgo-beach-killings/|title=Murder Victim Dubbed 'Peaches' Linked to Long Island Serial Killer Case|first=Timothy|last=Bolger|date=December 13, 2016|website=longislandpress.com|accessdate=October 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other possible victims===
These additional cases have not been officially linked to the other 10 bodies, but are being reviewed by police:

*19-year-old Tina Foglia was last seen in the early morning hours of February 1, 1982 at a rock music venue in [[West Islip]]. She was a known hitchhiker. Her dismembered body was discovered by Department of Transportation workers on February 3 along the shoulder of the Southern State Parkway. Her remains were placed in three separate plastic garbage bags, and were found a few miles north of the [[Robert Moses Causeway]], which leads to Gilgo Beach and Oak Beach. A diamond ring that Foglia was known to wear was missing, and the DNA of an unknown male was found on the garbage bags. Police have not ruled out the possibility that Tina Foglia was an early victim of the Long Island Serial Killer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pix11.com/2017/07/14/male-dna-retrieved-in-mystery-of-dismembered-teen-left-in-3-bags-on-long-island-parkway/|title=Male DNA retrieved in mystery of dismembered teen left in 3 bags on Long Island Parkway|date=July 14, 2017|website=pix11.com|accessdate=October 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*On March 3, 2007, a suitcase containing the dismembered torso of an unidentified [[Hispanic]] or light-skinned African-American female washed up on a beach at [[Harbor Island Park]], in the town of [[Mamaroneck, New York|Mamaroneck]]. The victim had a tattoo of two cherries on her left breast that was similar in appearance to the tattoo found on Peaches, and was determined to have been stabbed to death. Never identified, the victim is referred to as "[[Cherries (murder victim)|Cherries]]" by investigators. One of her dismembered legs washed up at [[Cold Spring Harbor, New York|Cold Spring Harbor]] on March 21, and her other leg washed up at [[Oyster Bay (town), New York|Oyster Bay]] in the village of [[Cove Neck, New York|Cove Neck]] the following day. "Cherries" was dismembered in a fashion similar to that of Jessica Taylor, "Peaches" and "Jane Doe No. 6," meaning she may possibly linked to the other official victims.&lt;ref name="archive.longislandpress.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.longislandpress.com/2011/05/11/two-ocean-parkway-remains-still-await-identification|title=Long Island Serial Killer: Two Ocean Parkway Bodies Still Await Identification|work=Long Island Press|date=May 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://doenetwork.org/cases/605ufny.html|title=The Doe Network: 605UFNY|work=doenetwork.org|accessdate=April 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was wearing a 22 karat gold pig pendant which may be a reference in some Asian cultures to "The Year of the Pig." This leads some to believe she died at the age of 29. {{citation needed|date=July 2018}} There was trauma caused to her bones; investigators believe she was buried before [[Hurricane Sandy]] in late 2012.

The '''Markovic affair''' was a [[political scandal]] in [[France]] in the late 1960s, involving [[French President]] [[Georges Pompidou]] and [[movie star]] [[Alain Delon]].
&lt;!--
L’instruction se dirige vers Alain Delon et François Marcantoni. Puis un événement fait tout basculer : une lettre anonyme publiée dans Le Figaro implique des hauts fonctionnaires et d’anciens membres du gouvernement dans des soirées douteuses organisées par Marcantoni. On apprend qu’un Yougoslave nommé Akov a des révélations à faire.
On est désormais loin du simple fait divers, et l’affaire devient politique. Le « tout-Paris » ne parle plus que de l’affaire Markovic et les rumeurs s’amplifient. Des photos d’un genre particulier circulent sous le manteau sur lesquelles apparaîtraient des personnalités de la politique, des médias, du spectacle et autres en train de se livrer à des « partouzes ». Sur les photos, on peut, selon la rumeur, reconnaître Claude Pompidou, l’épouse de Georges Pompidou alors ancien premier ministre, remercié quelques mois plus tôt par le général de Gaulle.
Georges Pompidou fut persuadé de l'implication de Louis Vallon, un de ses ennemis les plus tenaces, et de René Capitant, un de ses ennemis les plus anciens, connu au cabinet du général de Gaulle en 1944-1945, en plus de quelques comparses. Ceux-ci se servirent du SDECE (l'ancêtre de la DGSE) dans le cadre d'un complot le visant, en particulier son fameux service 6. Le but était évident : briser les ambitions présidentielles de Georges Pompidou.
La presse de l'époque ne s'y trompa pas. Pierre Viansson-Ponté écrivit dans Le Monde à ce moment : « L'ennemi est là, tout près, tapi dans l'ombre... » Il laissait entendre par là que les comploteurs bénéficiaient du soutien implicite de cercles proches du pouvoir. Cette affaire provoqua une rupture entre de Gaulle et Pompidou. Celui-ci se considéra alors délié de tout serment d'allégeance envers son mentor. Le soutien de l'opinion, qui voyait en Pompidou le successeur du Général, l'absence de faits probants, ainsi que le référendum du 27 avril 1969, firent avorter la conjuration.
Seule personne arrêtée, François Marcantoni est envoyé onze mois derrière les barreaux. La police effectue un travail de fourmi, notamment sur la housse de matelas où a été retrouvé Markovic. En partant de plus de 800 acquéreurs de matelas Treca, ils parviennent à sept noms, sept suspects, dont Marcantoni. En 1976, sept ans plus tard, malgré un sérieux faisceau de présomptions, le procureur de Versailles, Pierre Bezio, rendra pourtant un non-lieu grâce à son avocat Jacques Isorni et son cousin Jean-Charles Marchiani[réf. nécessaire].
--&gt;

The affair began when one of Delon's bodyguards, [[Stevan Marković (bodyguard)|Stevan Marković]], was found dead, which caused his brother to start a feud with Delon and his friends, one of whom was Georges Pompidou. Both Delon and his longtime friend [[François Marcantoni]] were questioned by the police immediately after the murder. Marcantoni was originally charged for the murder, but after further questioning by the police, he was released.&lt;ref name=Henley&gt;Jon Henley, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/sep/30/filmnews.books "Nervous publisher sneaks biography of Delon into shops"] ''The Guardian'', September 29, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the drama continued when supposedly-inappropriate photos of [[Claude Pompidou]], were found. A former police chief, [[Lucien Aimé-Blanc]], who had been involved in obtaining the photos, stated that they had been planted by old Gaullist clans who had long had animosity against Pompidou.&lt;ref name=Anderson&gt;Malcolm Anderson, ''In Thrall To Political Change: Police And Gendarmerie In France''. (Oxford: Oxford, 2011), 237.&lt;/ref&gt; That led to controversy over whether the photos were real. Marković's murder is still unsolved.

==Life and death of Stevan Marković==
Marković was the ex-bodyguard of movie star Alain Delon. A major gambler who was often suspected of cheating, Marković was known especially for his high-class parties at which, it was alleged, he would set up secret cameras throughout the house, especially in the bedrooms.&lt;ref name=Ghali&gt;Paul Ghali, "Marković Affair: Paris 'Dolce Vita' A web of Murder, Sex and Politics" ''The Pittsburgh Press'', April 14, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; He thus had collected many questionable photos of the guests that could have damaged their social status. He most likely used the pictures for blackmail, especially since he approached several newspapers trying to sell them. Surprisingly, some of these photographs would be alleged to be directly targeting Delon and Marcantoni themselves.&lt;ref name=Ghali/&gt; However, the most important photos that Marković supposedly possessed had scandalous shots of Pompidou's wife. That was a major concern to Pompidou, who was preparing to run for president of France.&lt;ref name=Henley/&gt; Then on October 1, 1968, in the village of [[Élancourt]], [[Yvelines]], west of Paris, the body of Stevan Marković was found in a public dump. Although many people had a reason to kill him, his murder is still unsolved.

==Alain Delon and François Marcantoni's involvement==
It was alleged that star actor Alain Delon communicated with French gangsters, such as Z, Bimbo, and Petit René. Suspiciously, many of them violently died after meeting Delon. However, Corsican [[François Marcantoni]] was Delon's closest gangster-friend.&lt;ref name=Henley/&gt; When Delon's bodyguard, Marković, mysteriously died, Marcantoni and Delon came under investigation. One of the factors pointing in that direction was a letter by Marković to his brother Aleksandar in which he wrote: "If I get killed, it's 100% the fault of Alain Delon and his godfather François Marcantoni." Marcantoni was initially charged with the murder. However, after being questioned by the police, the charges were eventually dropped, and the crime is still unsolved.

==Georges Pompidou's involvement==
The death of Stevan Marković provoked a great deal of rumours, many suggesting the existence of group sex photos with Madame Pompidou. Pompidou was then running his campaign for presidency and wanted to dispel them as soon as possible. He formally told the public that all the talk concerning the Marković affair were rumours.&lt;ref name=Ghali/&gt; Pompidou himself accused Louis Wallon and Henri Capitant of using the French espionage service [[Service de Documentation Extérieure et de Contre-Espionnage|SDECE]] to set him up. He admitted that he had been at parties with his wife and Stevan Marković and Alain Delon. However, many theories claimed that Pompidou ordered Marković's murder for revenge against the supposed photos of his wife. Even though he claimed the woman in the photos was a prostitute who simply greatly looked like his wife, the rumours would still hurt his campaign.&lt;ref name=Anderson/&gt; After he still won the 1969 election, he named [[Alexandre de Marenches]] as the head of the SDECE to reform it.

==Madame Pompidou's involvement==
The Marković affair was a play to ruin Georges Pompidou's reputation by hurting the public image of his wife. There were alleged compromising photos of Madame Pompidou. Later, information showed that it was not Madame Pompidou in the photos but a prostitute who had been hired by a former police chief, Luicien Aimé-Blanc, who had long been involved with the intelligence agency, the [[Service de Documentation Extérieure et de Contre-Espionnage|SDECE]]. An anonymous friend of Amié-Blanc asked him to produce a prostitute who was blonde and in her forties, but Aimé-Blanc did not know that the woman would be used as Madame Pompidou's [[lookalike]]. The prostitute was then photographed in compromising positions with another woman. The photos were found in Marković's car after his body had been found. However, it is still unknown whether it was the prostitute or Madame Pompidou.&lt;ref name=Anderson/&gt;

==Aftermath==
[[:fr:Bernard Violet|Bernard Violet]] wrote [https://www.amazon.com/Les-Myst%C3%A8res-Delon-Bernard-Violet/dp/2080681052 ''Les Mystères Delon]'', a book about Alain Delon, published in 2000. It was the first book in French legal history to have been banned before it was officially allowed to be sold, allegedly because Delon, the only remaining person associated with the affair to be still alive, did not approve of it. However, it was still sold in France.&lt;ref name=Henley/&gt;

In May 2008, MediaDefender performed a [[Denial-of-service attack|distributed-denial-of-service]] attack on [[Revision3]], despite the fact that they were not hosting unauthorized materials. Jim Louderback, Revision3 CEO charged that these attacks violated the [[Economic Espionage Act]] and the [[Computer Fraud and Abuse Act]].

The [[MPAA]] denied any involvement with MediaDefender.&lt;ref name="ArsTechnicaJuly6"/&gt; On September 14, 2007, internal emails from MediaDefender were leaked on to [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]] file sharing networks, which contradicted MediaDefender's claims of MiiVi being an "internal test site," revealing additional detailed [[information]] about the website and that the site was closed when the connection between it and MediaDefender became public knowledge. It was scheduled to be re-launched as www.viide.com, but has not yet been opened up to the public.&lt;ref name="TorrentFreak-Anti-PiracyGang"/&gt;

== Leaked information ==
Beginning on September 14, 2007, MediaDefender experienced a security breach caused by a group of hackers led by high school student "Ethan". This group called themselves MediaDefender-Defenders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.portfolio.com/news-markets/national-news/portfolio/2008/01/14/Media-Defenders-Profile?print=true Media Defenders Profile - National Business News - Print - Portfolio.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; According to an SEC filing, this ultimately cost parent company [[ARTISTdirect]] at least $825,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irconnect.com/mc/irc/secfilings.mc?cmd=disp&amp;id=5543752&amp;type=HTML ARTISTDIRECT INC (Form: 10QSB, Received: 11/14/2007 16:07:22)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071123102516/http://www.irconnect.com/mc/irc/secfilings.mc?cmd=disp&amp;id=5543752&amp;type=HTML |date=2007-11-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The breach included emails, a phone conversation, and a number of internal anti-infringement tools, including some source code.

===Leaked e-mails===
On September 14, 2007, 6,621 of the company's internal [[e-mail]]s were leaked, containing information contradicting previous statements and details of strategies intended to deceive copyright infringers. The emails link MediaDefender to projects that management previously denied involvement in. The [[Associated Press]] and other media outlets suggest that the leak may confirm speculation that MiiVi.com was an anti-copyright infringement "[[Honeypot (computing)|honeypot]]" site.&lt;ref name="AssociatedPress9-18-2007"&gt;Veiga, Alex (September 18, 2007). "[https://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/computersecurity/hacking/2007-09-18-mediadefender-leak_N.htm?csp=34 Hackers leak anti-piracy firm's e-mails]". [[Associated Press]].

''SC Magazine US''. Retrieved on September 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; One e-mail suggests using the [[MiiVi]] client program to turn users' PCs into drones for MediaDefender's [[eMule]] spoofing activities. The leaked e-mails discuss responses to unexpected and negative press, and expose upcoming projects, problems in and around the office, [[Domino's]] pizza orders, and other personal information about employees. Beyond strategic information, the leak also exposed login information for [[FTP]] and [[MySQL]] servers, making available a large library of [[MP3]] files likely including artists represented by MediaDefender's clients. The emails also revealed that MediaDefender probably was negotiating with the New York Attorney General's office to allow them access to information about users accessing pornographic material.&lt;ref name="ArsTechnicaSep16" /&gt; As of September 15, 2007, there had been no official response from the company.&lt;ref name="TorrentFreak-TheBiggestEver"/&gt; However, evidence exists that MediaDefender had been employing both legal and illegal actions to remove copies of the leaked emails from their respective hosting sites. In addition to the usual [[cease and desist|cease-and-desist letters]] from their legal department, IP addresses that are owned by MediaDefender were found to have been used in [[denial-of-service attack]]s against sites hosting the leaked emails.&lt;ref&gt;[https://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20070919-p2p-sites-ridicule-mediadefender-takedown-notices-in-wake-of-e-mail-leak.html P2P sites ridicule MediaDefender takedown notices in wake of e-mail leak] arstechnica.com&lt;/ref&gt;

The e-mails also revealed direction by MediaDefender founder [[Randy Saaf]] to have developer Ben Ebert attempt to eliminate the information about MiiVi from MediaDefender's [[English Wikipedia]] entry.&lt;ref name="ArsTechnicaSep16"&gt;[https://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20070916-leaked-media-defender-e-mails-reveal-secret-government-project.html Leaked Media Defender e-mails reveal secret government project]&lt;/ref&gt; Ebert responds in an email on the same day saying, "I will attempt to get all {{sic|referenes}} to miivi removed from wiki. I should easily be able to get It contested. We'll see if I can get rid of it."&lt;ref name="MediaDefenderEmail"&gt;[http://www.mediadefender-defenders.com/msg03754.html Re: MiiVi got Dugg&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016200639/http://mediadefender-defenders.com/msg03754.html |date=2007-10-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Leaked phone conversation ===
On September 16, 2007, MediaDefender-Defenders released a 25-minute excerpt of a phone conversation between the [[New York State Attorney General|New York Attorney General's]] office and MediaDefender as a [[BitTorrent (protocol)|torrent]] on The Pirate Bay. MediaDefender-Defenders claims in information released with the phone conversation that they have infiltrated the "internals" of the company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://torrentfreak.com/more-mediadefender-leaks-070916/ MediaDefender Phone Call and Gnutella Tracking Database Leaked]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leaked source code===
On September 20, 2007, MediaDefender-Defenders released the source code of TrapperKeeper, MediaDefender's decoy systems on The Pirate Bay.&lt;ref&gt;[http://torrentfreak.com/mediadefender-anti-piracy-tools-leaked-070920/ MediaDefender Anti-Piracy Tools Leaked]&lt;/ref&gt; A large chunk of MediaDefender's [[software]] was available by Bittorrent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theinquirer.net/?article=42516 MediaDefender source code leaked to wibble]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Revision3 controversy==
[[Revision3]] is an [[Internet television|Internet television network]] which distributes video content legally through various means, including the BitTorrent protocol. During the [[Memorial Day]] weekend in 2008, Revision3 came under a [[Denial of Service]] attack originating from MediaDefender IP addresses. The attack left the company's service inaccessible until mid-Tuesday the following week. Revision3 CEO [[Jim Louderback]] accused MediaDefender of injecting its [[Spoofing (anti-piracy measure)|decoy files]] into Revision3's BitTorrent service through a [[Vulnerability (computing)|vulnerability]], then automatically perpetrating the attack after Revision3 increased security.&lt;ref&gt;[http://revision3.com/blog/2008/05/29/inside-the-attack-that-crippled-revision3 Inside the Attack that Crippled Revision3] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130721014755/http://revision3.com/blog/2008/05/29/inside-the-attack-that-crippled-revision3/ |date=2013-07-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/technology/la-fi-outage30-2008may30,0,4328786.story Anti-piracy misfire blamed for crash of popular online TV network]&lt;/ref&gt;

Randy Saaf defended MediaDefender's actions by stating "Our systems were targeting a tracker not even knowing it was Revision3's tracker", adding that the denial-of-service attack resulted when "Revision3 changed some configurations" to their bittorrent tracker.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/2008/05/mediadefender-d MediaDefender Defends Revision3 SYN Attack]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Messe Frankfurt''' (literally "Frankfurt Trade Fair") is the world’s largest trade fair, congress and event organiser with its own exhibition grounds{{cn|date=June 2018}}. The organisation has 2,500 employees at some 30 locations, generating  annual sales of around €661 million. Its services include renting exhibition grounds, trade fair construction and marketing, personnel and food services. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.messefrankfurt.com/frankfurt/en/press/press-releases/2017/messe-frankfurt-record-turnover-press.html Press release Messe Frankfurt plays host to 95,000 exhibitors and sets new sales record]&lt;/ref&gt;

Headquartered in [[Frankfurt am Main]], the company is owned by the City of Frankfurt (60 percent) and the State of Hesse (40 percent).The Board of Management of Messe Frankfurt consists of Wolfgang Marzin (Chairman), Detlef Braun, and Uwe Behm.

Frankfurt has been known for its trade fairs for over 800 years. In the Middle Ages, merchants and businessmen met at the “Römer”, a medieval building in the heart of the city that served as a market place; from 1909 onwards, they met on the grounds of the ''[[Festhalle Frankfurt]]'', to the north of Frankfurt Central Station. The first Frankfurt trade fair to be documented in writing dates back to 11 July 1240, when the Frankfurt Autumn Trade Fair was called into being by Emperor Frederick II, who decreed that merchants travelling to the fair were under his protection. Some ninety years later, on 25 April 1330, the Frankfurt Spring Fair also received its privilege from Emperor Louis IV. And from this time onwards, trade fairs were held in Frankfurt twice a year, in spring and autumn, forming the basic structure for Messe Frankfurt’s modern consumer goods fairs.&lt;ref name="Trade Fair location Frankfurt"&gt;[http://www.messefrankfurt.com/frankfurt/en/messe/messe_leitbild/messeplatz.html Trade Fair location Frankfurt]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Frankfurt Trade Fair ==

=== Location and size ===
Located at the heart of financial and business centre Frankfurt, the exhibition grounds are among the largest and most modern worldwide with some 367,000 m² of hall area and more than 96,000 m² of free space at its disposal. As well as excellent international transport connections by air, rail and road, the exhibition venue enjoys excellent public transport connections: The S-Bahn suburban train station “Messe” stops in the centre of the exhibition grounds, the U-Bahn underground train station and the Strassenbahn tram station are located directly at the City Entrance/Festhalle.

=== Architecture ===
With their unique designs, architects such as Helmut Jahn, Oswald M. Ungers and Nicolas Grimshaw gave Messe Frankfurt’s exhibition grounds an unmistakable look that dovetails with Frankfurt’s modern cityscape. . With the Congress Center and Kap Europa, the company operates two congress centres as well. The Hall 12 is currently being built in the western section of the exhibition grounds and will be going into operation in autumn 2018.

'''Mono No Aware''' is a cinema-arts [[non-profit organization]]. Founded in 2007, its mission entails the advancement of “connectivity through the cinematic experience.”&lt;ref name="bedfordandbowery.com"/&gt; The organization is named after the Japanese concept [[mono no aware]] (物の哀れ), which expresses the [[impermanence]]  of [[being]] and [[beauty]].&lt;ref&gt;Franco Gatti, ''Rethinking Japan: Literature, Visual Arts &amp; Linguistics'', Psychology Press, 1990, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mono No Aware is based in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]] and organizes artist screenings,  [[analog recording|analog]] filmmaking workshops, equipment rentals, and [[film stock]] distribution. Film artists [[Bill Brand (film artist)|Bill Brand]] and [[Leslie Thornton (filmmaker)|Leslie Thornton]] serve on its Advisory Board.&lt;ref name="mononoawarefilm.com"/&gt; Since its founding, the organization has hosted an annual film festival, exhibiting expanded cinema works from around the world that utilize both analog technologies and live performance. Following the completion of the tenth festival, a month-long series of exhibitions, Mono No Aware undertook the construction of the first non-profit [[motion picture laboratory]] to operate in the United States.&lt;ref name="Mala 2017"&gt;{{cite web | last=Mala | first=Elisa | title=A Brooklyn Film School Where the Digital Revolution Didn’t Happen | website=[[The New York Times]] | date=July 11, 2017 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/11/nyregion/a-brooklyn-film-school-where-the-digital-revolution-didnt-happen.html | access-date=August 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22686">In [[economics]] a [[monopoly]] is a firm that lacks any viable [[competition]], and is the sole producer of the [[Product (business)|industry's product]].&lt;ref name="Essentials"&gt;Bradley R. chiller, "Essentials of Economics", New York: McGraw-Hill, Inc., 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MicroTheory"&gt;Edwin Mansfield, "Micro-Economics Theory and Applications, 3rd Edition", New York and London:W.W. Norton and Company, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IntermediateMicro"&gt;Roger LeRoy Miller, "Intermediate Microeconomics  Theory Issues Applications, Third Edition", New York: McGraw-Hill, Inc, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IndustrialOrg"&gt;Tirole, Jean,  "The Theory of Industrial Organization", Cambridge, Massachusetts: The MIT Press, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EconDictionary"&gt;John Black, "Oxford Dictionary of Economics", New York: Oxford University Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; In a normal [[Competition (economics)|competitive]] situation, no firm can charge a [[price]] that is significantly higher than the [[Marginal cost|Marginal]] [[Economic cost|(Economic)]] [[cost]] of producing (the last unit of) the product.&lt;ref name="Essentials" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IntermediateMicro" /&gt;  If any firm doing business within a [[Competition (economics)|competitive]] situation tries to raise prices significantly higher than the [[Marginal cost]] of producing the product, it will lose all of its [[customer]]s to either other existing firms that charge lower prices, or to a new firm that will find it profitable to use a lower price (closer to its [[Marginal Cost|marginal cost]]) to take customers away from the firm charging the higher price.&lt;ref name="Essentials" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MicroTheory" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IntermediateMicro" /&gt;  But since the monopoly firm does not have to worry about losing customers to competitors, it can set a ''[[Monopoly price]]'' that is significantly higher than its [[marginal cost]], allowing it to have an [[economic profit]] that is significantly higher than the [[normal profit]] that is typically found in a [[perfect competition|perfectly competitive]] industry.&lt;ref name="Essentials" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MicroTheory" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IntermediateMicro" /&gt; The high [[economic profit]] obtained by a monopoly firm is referred to as '''monopoly profit'''.

The existence of a monopoly, and therefore the existence of a [[monopoly price]] and monopoly profit, depend on the existence of [[Barrier to entry|barriers to entry]]: these stop other firms from entering into the industry and sapping away profits.&lt;ref name="IndustrialOrg" /&gt;

== Basic Classical and Neo-Classical Theory ==
According to Classical and Neo Classical Economic thought, firms in a [[Perfect competition|perfectly competitive]] market are '''price takers''' because no firm can charge a price that is different from the [[Economic equilibrium|equilibrium price]] set within the entire [[Industry|industry's]] perfectly [[perfect competition|competitive]] market.&lt;ref name="IntermediateMicro"&gt;Roger LeRoy Miller, "Intermediate Microeconomics Theory Issues Applications, Third Edition", New York: McGraw-Hill, Inc, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IntermediateMicro" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IndustrialOrg" /&gt; Since a competitive market has many competing firms, a customer can just easily buy [[Widget (economics)|widgets]] from any of the competing firms.&lt;ref name="Essentials" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MicroTheory" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IntermediateMicro" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EconDictionary" /&gt; Competing firms in a market essentially (each) face its own ''horizontal'' [[demand curve]] that is fixed at a single [[Price]] established by [[Economic equilibrium|Market Equilibrium]] for the entire [[Industry]] as a whole.&lt;ref name="Essentials" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MicroTheory" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EconDictionary" /&gt; Each firm in a [[Perfect competition|Competitive Market]] will have [[demand curve|buyers for its product]] as long as the firm charges 'no more than' the 1 single [[Price]]. &lt;ref name="Essentials" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MicroTheory" /&gt; Since firms cannot control the activities of other firms that produce the same [[Widget (economics)|widget]] sold within the [[Industry|market]], a firm that charges a [[Price]] that is higher than the [[Economic equilibrium|industry's Market Equilibrium Price]] would lose ''all'' business as customers would simply respond by buying their [[Widget (economics)|widgets]] from other competing firms that charge the (lower) [[Economic equilibrium|Market Equilibrium Price]]. .&lt;ref name="Essentials" /&gt; This makes Deviation from the [[Economic equilibrium|Market Equilibrium Price]] impossible.&lt;ref name="Essentials" /&gt;

[[Perfect competition]] is commonly characterized by an idealized situation in which all firms within the [[industry]] produce ''exactly'' comparable goods that are ([[Marginal rate of substitution|"Perfect Substitutes"]]).&lt;ref name="MicroTheory" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IntermediateMicro" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EconDictionary" /&gt;  With the exception of [[commodity markets]], this idealized situation does not typically exist in many actual markets.&lt;ref name="MicroTheory" /&gt;  However, in many cases, there exist products that are "similar" (such as butter and margarine) which are [[Marginal rate of substitution|relatively easily interchangeable]] because they are close [[Substitute good|Substitutes]].&lt;ref name="IntermediateMicro" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EconDictionary" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mathematical_MicroEcon"&gt;Henderson, James M., and Richard E. Quandt, "Micro Economic Theory, A Mathematical Approach. 3rd Edition", New York: McGraw-Hill Book Company, 1980. Glenview, Illinois: Scott, Foresmand and Company, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;  A relatively significant rise in a product's price will tend to cause [[Marginal rate of substitution|customers to switch from this good to]] a lower priced [[Substitute good|Close Substitute]].&lt;ref name="Mathematical_MicroEcon" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IndustrialOrg" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IntermediateMicro_Note"&gt;Roger LeRoy Miller, "Intermediate Microeconomics  Theory Issues Applications, Third Edition", New York: McGraw-Hill, Inc, 1982.
See Reference to "Price Elasticity" as it relates to "substitutability", as well as the "Marginal Rate of Technical Substitution"&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases firms that produce different ''but similar'' goods have relatively similar production processes; making it relatively easy for these firms of 1 good [[Marginal rate of technical substitution|to switch their manufacturing process]] to produce the other different ''but similar'' good.&lt;ref name="IntermediateMicro" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IndustrialOrg" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mathematical_MicroEcon" /&gt;  This would be the case when the cost of changing the firm's manufacturing process to produce the different ''but similar'' good can be relatively [[Generally Accepted Auditing Standards|"immaterial"]] in relationship to the firm's overall profit and cost.&lt;ref name="Mathematical_MicroEcon" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IntermediateMicro" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IndustrialOrg" /&gt; Since consumers will tend to replace goods whose prices are relatively high with relatively cheaper [[Marginal rate of substitution|"Close Substitutes"]], the existence of [[Marginal rate of substitution|"Close Substitutes"]] whose manufacturing processes are similar enough so as to allow a firm (producing a relatively low priced good) to easily switch over to producing the other higher priced good, the [[Perfect competition|Competition Model]] will still accurately explain why the existence of different [[Substitute good|"similar goods"]] form [[Competition (economics)|competitive forces]] that deny any single firm the ability to establish a [[monopoly]] in their product;&lt;ref name="Intermediate_Mathematical_MicroEcon"&gt;Henderson, James M., and Richard E. Quandt, "Micro Economic Theory, A Mathematical Approach. 3rd Edition", New York: McGraw-Hill Book Company, 1980. Glenview, Illinois: Scott, Foresmand and Company, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

This is shown in a high profit and production cost industry such as the car industry and many other Industries facing [[Import substitution industrialization|Competition from Imports]].&lt;ref name="Automotive_Competitive_Forces"&gt;Drake Bennett, "BusinessWeek": [http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-04-04/gm-ford-and-chrysler-the-detroit-three-are-back-right "GM, Ford, and Chrysler: The Detroit Three Are Back, Right?"], April 4, 2013.

&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
[[File:CompetitiveMarket.jpg|Firms in a Competitive Market|thumb|upright=3.2|Competitive firms are forced to be "Price Takers" of the "Equilibrium Price" set within the Industry's Market by Total Consumer Demand and Supply provided by all firms in the Industry.]]

By contrast, the lack of [[competition]] in a market ensures the firm ([[monopoly]]) has a downward sloping demand curve&lt;ref name="Intermediate_Mathematical_MicroEcon" /&gt;  Although raising prices causes the [[monopoly]] to lose some business, some sales can be made at the higher prices.&lt;ref name="Essentials" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MicroTheory" /&gt; Though monopolists are constrained by [[Demand (economics)|consumer demand]], they are not "price takers" because they can influence price through their production decisions.&lt;ref name="Essentials" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MicroTheory" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IndustrialOrg" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Intermediate_Mathematical_MicroEcon" /&gt; The monopolist can either have a ''target level of output'' that will ensure the ''[[Monopoly Price]]'' as the given consumer demand in the industry reacts to the fixed and limited [[Supply (economics)|Market Supply]], or it can set a fixed ''[[Monopoly Price]]'' at the onset and adjust [[Output (economics)|output]] until it can ensure no excess [[Inventory control|inventories]] occurs at the final [[Output (economics)|output level]] chosen.&lt;ref name="IndustrialOrg" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Intermediate_Mathematical_MicroEcon" /&gt; A each price, the firm must accept the level of output as determined by the [[Demand (economics)|market's consumer demand]], and every output quantity is identified with a price that is determined by the [[Demand (economics)|market's consumer demand]]. The price and output are co-determined by consumer demand and the firm's [[Industrial engineering|production cost structure]].&lt;ref name="MicroTheory" /&gt;

A firm with monopoly power sets a [[monopoly price]] that maximizes the '''Monopoly profit'''.&lt;ref name="MicroTheory" /&gt; The most ''profitable'' price for the monopoly occurs when output level ensures the [[marginal cost]] (MC) equals the [[marginal revenue]] (MR)) associated with the demand curve.&lt;ref name="MicroTheory" /&gt; Under normal market conditions for a monopolist, this [[monopoly price]] will be higher than the [[Marginal cost|Marginal]] [[Economic cost|(Economic)]] [[cost]] of producing the product, thereby indicating the price paid by the consumer, which is equal to the [[marginal benefit]] for the consumer, is above the firm's [[marginal cost]].&lt;ref name="MicroTheory" /&gt; In the chart below the shaded area represents the profits of the monopolist, such that MR = MC for the case of monopoly. The lower half represents the normal profits that would go to a competitive firm (ignoring output losses). The upper half represent the additional economic profit going to the monopolist.

[[File:MonopolyPower3-Wiki.JPG|Monopoly Price and Output|center|A monopolist will set a price and production quantity where MC=MR, such that MR is always below the [[Monopoly Price]] set.  A Competitive Firm's MR is the Price it gets for its product, and will have Price=MC.]]

== Persistence ==

'''In the ''absence of'' [[Barrier to entry|barriers to entry]] and [[collusion]] in a market''', the existence of a monopoly, and therefore monopoly profit, cannot persist in the [[long run]].&lt;ref name="Essentials"&gt;Bradley R. Chiller, "Essentials of Economics", New York: McGraw-Hill, Inc., 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IndustrialOrg" /&gt; (Note that a barrier can be caused by increasing returns to scale—a bigger firm can produce more cheaply. If the most efficient size firm serves the whole market, we have a "natural monopoly," and no other firms will "rush" to enter.) Normally, when economic profit exists within an industry, [[economic agent]]s rush to form new firms in the industry in an effort to obtain at least a portion of the existing economic profit.&lt;ref name="Essentials" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MicroTheory"/&gt;  As new firms enter the industry, they increase the supply of the product available in the Market, and these new firms are forced to charge a lower price to entice consumers to buy the additional supply these new firms are supplying (they compete for customers).&lt;ref name="Essentials" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MicroTheory" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IntermediateMicro"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IndustrialOrg"/&gt; Since consumers will flock toward the lowest price (in search of a bargain), older firms within the industry actually face losing their existing customers to the new firms entering the industry, and are therefore forced to lower their prices to match the lower prices set by the new firms.&lt;ref name="Essentials" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MicroTheory" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IndustrialOrg" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MicroEcon_MathApproach"&gt;Henderson, James M., and Richard E. Quandt, "Micro Economic Theory, A Mathematical Approach. 3rd Edition", New York: McGraw-Hill Book Company, 1980. Glenview, Illinois: Scott, Foresmand and Company, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; New firms will continue to enter the industry until the price of the product is lowered to the point that it is the same as the average economic cost of producing the product, and all of the economic profit disappears.&lt;ref name="Essentials" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MicroTheory" /&gt; When this happens, economic agents outside of the industry find no advantage to entering the industry, supply of the product stops increasing, and the price charged for the product stabilizes.&lt;ref name="Essentials" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MicroTheory" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IntermediateMicro" /&gt; Essentially, a competitive situation always leads to an [[Perfect competition|equilibrium solution]]".

Normally, a firm that introduces a brand new product can initially secure a monopoly for a short while.&lt;ref name="Essentials" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MicroTheory" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IntermediateMicro" /&gt; At this stage, the initial price the consumer must pay for the product is high, and the demand for, as well as the available of the product in the market, will be limited. In the long run, however, when the profitability of the product is well established, the number of firms that produce this product will increase until the available supply of the product eventually becomes relatively large, the price of the product shrinks down to the level of the average "[[Economic cost]]" of producing the product.&lt;ref name="Essentials" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MicroTheory" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IntermediateMicro" /&gt; When this finally occurs, all monopoly associated with producing and selling the product disappears, and the initial monopoly turns into a (perfectly) competitive industry.&lt;ref name="Essentials" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MicroTheory" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IntermediateMicro" /&gt;

When consumers have full information about the prices available in the market and the quality of the products sold by the various firms, there cannot be a persistent monopolistic situation in the absence of barriers to entry and collusion.&lt;ref name="Essentials" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IntermediateMicro" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RationalExpecation"&gt;Steven M. Sheffrin, "Rational Expectations", New York: Cambridge University Press, 1987. John Black, "Oxford Dictionary of Economics", New York: Oxford University Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Various barriers to entry include patent rights&lt;ref name="Essentials" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MicroTheory" /&gt; and monopolization of a natural resource needed to produce a product.&lt;ref name="Essentials" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MicroTheory" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IntermediateMicro" /&gt; The American firm [[Alcoa|Alcoa Aluminum]] is a historical example of a monopoly due to natural resource control; their control of "practically every source of [[bauxite]] in the United States" (bauxite is used to produce aluminum) was one key reason that "Alcoa was, for a long time, the sole producer of aluminum in the United States." &lt;ref name="MicroTheory" /&gt;

== Government intervention ==
[[Competition law|Anti-Trust]] (Competition) Laws were created to prevent ''powerful firms'' from using their economic power to '''''artificially'' create the "barriers to entry"''' they need to protect their monopoly profits.&lt;ref name="MicroTheory" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IntermediateMicro" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IndustrialOrg" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MicroEcon_MathApproach" /&gt; This includes the use of [[predatory pricing]] toward smaller competitors.&lt;ref name="Essentials" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IndustrialOrg" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EconDictionary"/&gt; In the United States, [[Microsoft Corporation]] was initially convicted of breaking the Anti-Trust Laws and engaging in anti-competitive behavior in order to form one such barrier in ''[[United States v. Microsoft]]''; after a successful appeal on technical grounds, Microsoft agreed to a settlement with the Department of Justice in which they were faced with stringent oversight procedures and explicit requirements&lt;ref name="MSCourtSettlement"&gt;[http://www.justice.gov/atr/cases/f200400/200457.pdf "United States of America, Plaintiff, v. Microsoft Corporation, Defendant", Final Judgement], Civil Action No. 98-1232, November 12, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; designed to prevent this predatory behavior.&lt;ref name="Essentials" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IndustrialOrg" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EconDictionary" /&gt; Microsoft was successfully convicted of similar anti-competitive behavior in the [[European Economic Community]]'s second highest court, the Luxembourg-based [[Court of First Instance]], in 2007.&lt;ref name="EC_MS_AntiTrust"&gt;Andy Reinhardt, "BusinessWeek": [http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/content/apr2006/gb20060424_729316.htm "Microsoft's Day in European Court"], April 24, 2006.

&lt;/ref&gt; If firms in an industry collude they can also limit production, thereby restricting supply to ensure the price of the product remains high enough to ensure all of the firms in the industry achieve an economic profit.&lt;ref name="Essentials" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IndustrialOrg" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EconDictionary" /&gt;

[[File:monopolyPower AddCompetion.JPG|thumb|center|upright=3.2|Introducing new Competition in what was previously a monopoly removes monopoly profit.

Only 2 Firms are shown here to make Illustration of the additional Competition easier in a Graphical Presentation.  In Normal Circumstances, it takes more than 2 firms to form a ''Competitive Situation'', and having only 2 firms forms a ''[[Oligopoly|"Duopoly]] (See Oligopoly)"'']]

The diagram to the right depicts an industry that initially starts out with a single firm that enjoys a monopoly and the initial monopoly profit that comes with it. Later, a second firm enters into the industry, lowering its price to obtain customers that usually do not purchase the product at the high [[Monopoly Price]]. As the initial monopoly firm loses customers, it is forced to lower its price to retain profitability. In the competition for sales to customers, the firms lower their prices even further, which increases the consumer demand for the product, and thereby entices the firms to raise production and which then increases the industry's total production and sales. Finally, the price and production in the industry stabilizes into its "competitive equilibrium"; the price paid by the consumers are just high enough to cover the average [[economic cost]] of producing the product, and the available quantity of the product doubles from its initial sales (under the monopoly).

If a government feels it is impractical to have a competitive market, it will sometimes try to regulate the monopoly by controlling the price the monopoly charges for its product.&lt;ref name="MicroTheory" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IntermediateMicro" /&gt; The old AT&amp;T (regulated) monopoly, which existed before the courts [[United States v. AT&amp;T|ordered its breakup]] and tried to force competition in the market, had to get government approval to raise its prices.&lt;ref name="IntermediateMicro" /&gt; The government examined the monopoly's costs, and determined whether or not the monopoly should be able raise its price and if the government felt that the cost did not justify a higher price, it rejected the monopoly's application for a higher price. Though a regulated monopoly will not have a monopoly profit that is high as it would be in an unregulated situation, it still can have an economic profit that is still well above a competitive firm has in a truly competitive market.&lt;ref name="IntermediateMicro" /&gt;

[[File:MonopolyPower-GovRegulated.jpg|thumb|center|upright=3.2|Government regulations of the Price the Monopoly can charge ''reduces'' the Monopoly Profit, but does not ''eliminate'' it.]]
The government examines the marginal cost associated with raising the production level up to its presently desirable quantity, and allows the regulated monopoly to charge a price that is no greater than this marginal cost. Though the monopoly's profit is lower than it is in an unregulated Situation, it can still make a positive economic profit.

'''Oklahoma Shakespeare in the Park''' (OSP) was founded in 1985 in [[Edmond, Oklahoma]], USA by current Executive Director and Artistic Director Kathryn McGill ([[née]] Huey) and Jack J. O'Meara. With two different performing venues, the organization produces a range of classic plays. Oklahoma Shakespeare in the Park is a non-profit organization overseen by a Board of Directors. Jason Foreman serves as Board President.&lt;ref name="SCF"&gt;{{cite book |title=Shakespeare Companies and Festivals: An International Guide |last1=Engle |first1=Ron |last2=Londré |first2=Felicia Hardison |last3=Watermeier |first3=Daniel J. |year=1995 |location= |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |isbn=978-0-313-27434-3 |pages=270–73}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jon Haque serves as Managing Director, and Michelle Swink as PR/Marketing Associate.  In 2007, it relocated to downtown Oklahoma City.

==History==
OSP was founded in 1985 by Kathryn McGill and Jack J. O'Meara as an outdoor summer [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] festival. McGill, a native of [[Edmond, Oklahoma]], met O'Meara—a local television promotions director—on a visit home from her [[Master of Fine Arts]] training in [[New York City]]. Their shared interest in Shakespeare and the opportunity presented by the small stage in [[E.C. Hafer Park]], which was available for use by community groups,  led to the formation of Oklahoma Shakespeare in the Park as an outdoor summer Shakespeare festival. McGill and O'Meara found interested local actors and generated enthusiasm for the project. In July and August 1985, with a $500 grant from the [[Oklahoma Arts Council]] and their own money, they staged their first productions: [[Twelfth Night]] and [[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]. Each play ran for 5 weeks, for a 10-week season, drawing a total attendance of 6,000 people.&lt;ref name="SCF"/&gt;


Since the project turned out to be so popular, McGill and O'Meara decided to pursue the project further and formally incorporated Oklahoma Shakespeare in the Park in 1986 with O'Meara acting as managing director and McGill as artistic director. Office and storage space was rented at the [[Edmond Community Center]], along with an all purpose room used for a winter season of performances. The winter performances ran for 3 seasons, but since the space was shared with "…dog shows, cotillions, and other rental uses … which necessitated striking the set after almost every performance"&lt;ref name="SCF"/&gt; they were eventually put on hold until a more suitable space could be found.&lt;ref name="SCF"/&gt;


The summer productions fared better, expanding from two to three productions in 1988 and briefly switching to a rotating repertory format in 1989. In 1990 budget limitations forced a return to stock performances of four plays in 59 performances, but the company's goal was still to return to a rotating repertory format. They began charging admissions in 1988, but still set an attendance record with 12.000 visitors for three shows.&lt;ref name="SCF"/&gt;


In 1989 the City of Edmond's parks department created a new performance site for the company and in 1991 funded the construction of permanent toilet facilities. OSP also built its own semi-permanent two-story wooden thrust stage in 1990.&lt;ref name="SCF"/&gt; By 1991 OSP had grown to the point where its 25-member board could arrange two benefits each year, raising $15-20.000, and the company received fairly large grants from companies like [[Phillips Petroleum]] and [[Target Stores]].&lt;ref name="SCF"/&gt;


In 2001, OSP's stage was destroyed by fire. The company rebuilt on the same location, but in 2005 fire again struck and the company relocated to the [[University of Central Oklahoma]] as a temporary home. In December 2006, under the leadership of then-Board President [[David Holt (politician)]], OSP announced that it was relocating to downtown [[Oklahoma City]], and the [[Myriad Botanical Gardens]] Water Stage and from  June 14 through September 1, 2007 it presented its inaugural summer season in downtown Oklahoma City with performances in repertory of [[A Midsummer Night's Dream]], [[Cyrano de Bergerac (play)|Cyrano de Bergerac]], and [[Macbeth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oklahomashakespeare.com/files/OSP-Speech20061212.pdf |title=Oklahoma Shakespeare in the Park Speech |last=Holt |first=David |date=December 12, 2006 |location=Water Stage, Myriad Botanical Garden |accessdate=January 7, 2009 |format=PDF |publisher=Oklahoma Shakespeare in the Park |work=oklahomashakespeare.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''season finale''' ([[British English]]: '''last in the series'''; [[Australian English]]: '''season final''') is the final episode of a [[Television program#Seasons/series|season]] of a [[television program]]. This is often the final episode to be produced for a few months or longer, and, as such, will try to attract viewers to continue watching when the series begins again.

A season finale may contain a [[Cliffhanger|cliffhanger ending]] to be resolved in the next season. Alternatively, a season finale could bring storylines to a close, "going out on a high" and similarly maintaining interest in the series' eventual return.

==Mid-season finale==
In the 2000s, the terms "mid-season finale", "fall finale" and "winter finale" began being used by some cable and broadcast networks in the United States to denote the last episode in the first half of a [[split television season]]. Such a "finale" is ahead of a break in the broadcast schedule in order to make room for a [[mid-season replacement]] series, or it can simply demarcate the interregnum between November [[sweeps]] and the end of the [[Christmas and holiday season|Christmas/Hanukkah/New Year holiday period]], when most regular programming is in [[Hiatus (television)|hiatus]].

==Series finale==
{{main|Series finale}}
The ''final'' episode of a television series often concludes the entire premise of the show, wrapping up any loose ends and storylines.  On occasion, the season finale has become the series finale due to [[cancellation (television)|cancellation]] of the series, sometimes unexpectedly so, leaving plot points unresolved.

==In sports==
In [[American English]], the term has evolved to describe the final event of a [[Season (sports)|sporting season]], e.g. in [[soccer]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://soccershout.com/2007/05/28/soccer-07-05-29-season-finale/ Soccershout.com, "07-05-29 – Season Finale"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080113223926/http://soccershout.com/2007/05/28/soccer-07-05-29-season-finale/ |date=2008-01-13 }} Retrieved September 26, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; or [[motocross]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crash.net/news_view~cid~29~id~153927.htm Crash.net, "Strijbos wins season finale, Ramon crowned"] Retrieved September 26, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps partly because of the popularity of these with television viewers.

'''''The Atlanta Child Murders''''' is a TV [[miniseries]] that aired on February 10 and 12, [[1985 in television|1985]] on [[CBS]].  Inspired by true events, the miniseries examines the so-called "[[Atlanta child murders]]" of the late 1970s and early 1980s.

==Plot summary==
Between the summer of 1979 and the spring of 1981, 29 African American children, adolescents and adults were murdered in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. The killings gained nationwide attention, with many suspecting that they were the work of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] or a similar [[white supremacist]] group. However, in June 1981, a 23-year-old African American named [[Wayne Williams]] (Levels) was arrested for [[first-degree murder]] in the deaths of 27-year-old Nathaniel Carter and 29-year-old Jimmy Ray Payne.  Eight months later, Williams was convicted of both killings and sentenced to two consecutive terms of [[life imprisonment]].  Some parties speculate that Williams was not the real killer, and that local law enforcement officials used him as a [[Scapegoat#Metaphor|scapegoat]] to bring a seemingly unsolvable case to a close.  However, it is generally presumed that Williams was the culprit in most of the murders, if not all of them. No one was ever tried in connection with the other killings.

==Reception==
*Atlanta officials criticized ''The Atlanta Child Murders'', claiming that it distorted the facts of the case. After a series of negotiations, CBS executives agreed to insert a disclaimer alerting viewers that the film is based on fact but contains fictional elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

'''''The Informant''''' is a [[nonfiction]] [[white-collar crime]] book written by journalist [[Kurt Eichenwald]] and published in 2000 by [[Random House]].&lt;ref name="Webber"&gt;{{cite news |last=Webber |first=Susan |title=Tale of the Tapes |work=The Daily Deal |publisher=[[Aurora Advisors]], Inc. |date=2000-09-25 |url=http://www.auroraadvisors.com/articles/2000-09_dailydeal.html |accessdate=2008-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It documents the mid-1990s [[lysine price-fixing conspiracy]] case and the involvement of [[Archer Daniels Midland]] executive [[Mark Whitacre]], inspiring [[The Informant!|a film adaptation]] starring [[Matt Damon]] as Whitacre.

==Summary==
{{see also|Lysine price-fixing conspiracy}}
{{external media| float = right| video1 = [https://www.c-span.org/video/?160555-1/informant-true-story-part-1 Part One of ''Booknotes'' interview with Kurt Eichenwald  on ''The Informant'', February 4, 2001], [[C-SPAN]]| video2 = [https://www.c-span.org/video/?160555-2/informant-true-story-part-2 Part Two of ''Booknotes'' interview, February 11, 2001], [[C-SPAN]]}}
In the early 1990s, at the [[agri-business]] conglomerate [[Archer Daniels Midland]] (ADM), [[Mark Whitacre]] is a corporate vice president and head of the bio-products division. In November 1992, under pressure from his wife, Whitacre confesses to an [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent that he, along with other ADM executives, routinely met with competitors to fix the price of [[lysine]], a food additive. Afterwards, Whitacre assists in gathering evidence against the other conspirators by secretly taping their activities during overseas business meetings. Over the course of three years, the FBI collects hundreds of hours of video and audio tapes documenting the largest case of price-fixing in history.

Whitacre is revealed to have defrauded $9 million from ADM at the same time he was aiding the FBI. After federal agents stage raid on ADM, the company hits back with damning evidence against the government's star witness. Whitacre becomes delusional and engages in [[pathological lying]] to save himself, leading the FBI to learn that he suffers from [[bipolar disorder]]. Worst of all, he gives false stories to the media about being forced to destroy evidence by the FBI. Whitacre becomes extremely manic, stops sleeping, and exhibits bizarre behavior as his meltdown continues. He attempts suicide a few months later, but is saved by his groundskeeper.

After seeing the movie ''[[The Firm (1993 film)|The Firm]]'', Whitacre's delusional fantasy causes him to record and collect his conversations with FBI agents. Because he violated his immunity agreement with the government, Whitacre is charged with price-fixing along with the other ADM conspirators. Whitacre's attorney, James Epstein, successfully convinces the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] officials that the government was culpable for Whitacre's behavior as he was emotionally unprepared for the case. Epstein manages to get a very light sentence for Whitacre. However, Whitacre, unwilling to serve any jail time, fires Epstein.

At his trial, Whitacre is convicted and receives a federal prison sentence three times longer than the other conspirators. Whitacre's FBI handlers, along with [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[John Ashcroft]], attempt to obtain a [[presidential pardon]] for Whitacre. With remarkable support from the FBI and his wife, Whitacre recovers from his mental problems and, after leaving prison, is promoted to COO and president of a California biotechnology company.&lt;ref name="News Blaze"&gt;{{cite news |author=Staff writers |title=Mark Whitacre, Ph.D. Promoted at Cypress Systems, Inc. and a Warner Bros.

The National Triathlon or '''Tri-Zone''' is a relatively new event for Venture Scouts, that was run for the first time in September 2005. In this physical challenge teams of two people from a Venture Group complete a set course combining rafting, cycling and mountaineering.

==Teams==

Each team consists of two Ventures, who must be registered as Venture Scouts in the National Office. Mixed teams are allowed, as long as two separate tents are provided for the team.

==Equipment==

The equipment that is brought is arguably the most important aspect for any team. The recommended items to bring are:
*Food and cooking facilities (i.e. [[trangia]])
*Tent(s)
*Hiking Boots
*Raingear
*The participant's own bike
*Runners for rafting (these will get wet) and runners for cycling
*Sleeping bag, Spare clothes etc...
*First aid kit&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scouts.ie/ventures/venture-event-information/trizone-the-national-venture-triathlon/ Scouting Ireland] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071119083833/http://www.scouts.ie/ventures/venture-event-information/trizone-the-national-venture-triathlon/ |date=2007-11-19 }}, All information rewritten from the Scouting Ireland website.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Competition==

Although Tri-Zone is technically a competition, it is also an opportunity for Ventures to have fun, and try new things.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scouts.ie/ventures/ Venture Scouts] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080610011929/http://www.scouts.ie/ventures/ |date=2008-06-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''University of Chicago Scavenger Hunt''' (or '''Scav Hunt''', colloquially '''Scav''') is an annual four-day team-based [[scavenger hunt]] held at the [[University of Chicago]] from Thursday to Sunday of [[Mother's Day]] weekend in May. The list of items, usually over 300 items long, encompasses cryptograms, competitions, build challenges, a 3 course meal, and a 2,000 mile road trip. "Scav Hunt" is well known for its quirky, strange, or impossible items.&lt;ref name=NewYorker2012 /&gt; Scav held the [[Guinness World Record]] for largest scavenger hunt from 2011 to 2014.&lt;ref name=Baker2014&gt;{{cite news|last1=Baker|first1=Sierra|title=Provo breaks record for world’s largest scavenger hunt |url=http://universe.byu.edu/2014/09/16/provo-breaks-record-for-worlds-largest-scavenger-hunt1/|accessdate=17 May 2015|publisher=[[The Universe (student newspaper)|The Universe]]|date=16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format==
The Scavenger Hunt is held annually over four days in May, such that the final day's judging of items (known as 'judgment day') is held on [[Mother's Day]].&lt;ref name="RedEye2013"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://articles.redeyechicago.com/2013-05-07/news/39147778_1_list-chicago-scavenger-hunt-residence-hall | title=U. of C.

"The Hunt" begins ceremoniously at midnight of the Thursday directly preceding Mother's Day weekend, with an event known as "List Release."&lt;ref name="TimeOut2011"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.timeout.com/chicago/things-to-do/university-of-chicago-scav-hunt | title=University of Chicago Scav Hunt: Participants in the U. of C.’s 25th annual Scav Hunt try to set a Guinness world record. | publisher=[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]] Chicago | date=3 May 2011 | accessdate=14 May 2015 | author=Cromidas, Rachel}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ceremony surrounding the unveiling of the list usually begins a few hours before midnight, as teams slowly assemble on the ground floor of [[Ida Noyes Hall]]. These teams (ranging in size from 1 to over 250 each) then participate in what has been described as [[collective effervescence]], as they chant various team-based and humorous slogans, eventually coalescing into a repeated "we want the list".&lt;ref name="CollegeEvent"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://college.uchicago.edu/2014-university-chicago-scavenger-hunt-list-release | title=Event: The 2014 University of Chicago Scavenger Hunt List Release | publisher=The College of the University of Chicago | date=8 May 2014 | accessdate=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ChicagoMaroonPhotos2015"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://chicagomaroon.com/2015/05/11/scav-inspires-student-creativity-and-matrimony/ | title=Scav Inspires Student Creativity and Matrimony | publisher=The Chicago Maroon | date=11 May 2015 | accessdate=14 May 2015 |author1=McVea, Andrew  |author2=Hauck, Grace |lastauthoramp=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, at midnight, the judges (members of the University of Chicago Scavenger Hunt Organizing Committee) run into the center of this gathering, and announce that year's list release challenge.

Each challenge is designed to delay teams in acquiring a paper copy of that year's list of approximately 300 items. Previous examples have included the pages of the list buried under sand at a nearby beach, team captains kidnapped and forced to transcribe items onto their bodies with Sharpies, and copies of the list suspended from a wall six feet high ten feet away from a team representative, because "the floor is lava."&lt;ref name="NewYorker2012"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/07/02/the-hunter-games | title=The Hunter Games | publisher=[[The New Yorker]] | date=2 July 2012 | accessdate=14 May 2015 | author=Marx, Patricia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once a team has obtained the list, they travel back to their headquarters (usually a dorm lounge or apartment living room) to begin working on the list of items. Several hours after the release of the list the judges publish it online (usually around 3:00 A.M. [[Central Time Zone|CST]] on the Thursday of the Hunt), thus making it available for teams unable to attend "List Release."&lt;ref name="RickVug"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://rickvug.com/node/34 | title=SlashDot Article | publisher=Rick Vugteveen | date=17 February 2012 | accessdate=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Every year, teams attempt to complete items from a list of approximately 300. Each item is written, assigned a point value, and put onto the list by a panel of judges known as the University of Chicago Scavenger Hunt Organizing Committee. The list has, since 1997,&lt;ref name="ScavHuntArchives1996List"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://scavhunt.uchicago.edu/lists/1996.pdf | title=The 1996 University of Chicago Scavenger Hunt List | publisher=The University of Chicago Scavenger Hunt Committee | date=5 May 1996 | accessdate=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ScavHuntArchives1997List"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://scavhunt.uchicago.edu/lists/1997.pdf | title=The 1997 University of Chicago Scavenger Hunt List | publisher=The University of Chicago Scavenger Hunt Committee | date=11 May 1997 | accessdate=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; been formatted in [[LaTeX]] and released online in [[PDF]] and the original LaTeX formats at 3:00 A.M.

Since 2006,&lt;ref name="ScavHuntArchives2006List"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://scavhunt.uchicago.edu/lists/2006.pdf | title=The 2006 University of Chicago Scavenger Hunt List | publisher=The University of Chicago Organizing Committee | date=11 May 2006 | accessdate=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the list has begun with a set of official rules, including:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol start="1"&gt;&lt;li&gt;
Acquisition of Items. All items on the List can be obtained and performed legally. It may involve smooth talking, or it may involve something else, but it is all possible. The Judges take no responsibility for your getting thrown into the clink—be it local clink, state clink, federal clink, or Colonel Klink. If you end up there, it is your fault.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ol start="4"&gt;&lt;li&gt;
Props. All props must, always and forever, be mad props.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ol start="7"&gt;&lt;li&gt;
A Good Time. For a good time, call (202) 762-1401.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The phone number above is for the voice announcer of the [[United States Naval Observatory]]'s "[[Master clock|Master Clock]],"&lt;ref name="USNO"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/voice.html | title=USNO Master Clock Voice Announcer | publisher=United States Naval Observatory | accessdate=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usno.navy.mil/USNO/time/master-clock/ |title=USNO Master Clock — Naval Oceanography Portal |publisher=Usno.navy.mil |accessdate=27 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which provides time measurements at the [[atomic clock|atomic level]] of precision to the [[GPS satellite]] constellation run by the [[U.S. Air Force]].

After the official rules, a list of qualifying factors for the road trip portion of the scavenger hunt is included. These qualifying factors have been included in the list at the behest of UChicago's Center for Leadership and Involvement (the governing body for [[University of Chicago#Student organizations|registered student organizations]]) since 2006.&lt;ref name="ScavHuntArchives2006List"/&gt; The road trip, itself, though, has been a part of the Hunt since 1991.&lt;ref name="ScavHuntArchives1991List"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://scavhunt.uchicago.edu/lists/1991.pdf | title=The 1991 University of Chicago Scavenger Hunt List | publisher=The University of Chicago Organizing Committee | date=11 May 1991 | accessdate=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the road trip qualifications, all "Scav Olympics" events are listed. These are original competitions designed annually and held on Eckhart Quad Saturday afternoon of the Hunt.&lt;ref name="WBEZ2011"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wbez.org/story/who-brought-tiger-photosvideos-inside-uofc-scav-hunt-86274 | title=Who brought the tiger?

Finally, following the above sections, is the list of all general category items. Item lists are broken up into pages, with one or several judges contributing to the items on each page.

===Road trip===

Road trip, one of the more original elements of the hunt, is constrained by several factors. The furthest destination may be no more than 1,000 miles from Chicago and the trip must be completed between 8 a.m. Thursday morning and Saturday night.&lt;ref&gt;http://chicagomaroon.com/2013/05/17/dispatches-from-the-scav-road-trip/&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, road trip is completed with participants wearing ridiculous costumes. Items for the road trip are scattered throughout the main list.

Drivers on the road trip are held to the following requirements:

* Minimum age of 18.
* Must have had a valid U.S. driver’s license for at least two years.
* Must have more than 2,000 miles driving experience.
* Cannot have received any moving violations or convictions or court-ordered supervision.
* Must be alcohol- and drug-free.
* Must have valid automobile insurance.

===Friday night event===
On the Friday Night of the Scavenger Hunt, there is usually a large themed event held in one of the gathering spaces on campus. In recent years, this event has been a wedding,&lt;ref name=DNAInfo2015/&gt; a sleepover party with pillow and blanket forts,&lt;ref name="College2014"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://college.uchicago.edu/uniquely-chicago/story/scav-past-and-present | title=Scav: Past and Present | publisher=The College of the University of Chicago | date=29 October 2014 | accessdate=18 May 2015 | author=Rhee, William}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[prom|prom dance]].{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Previously, this event took the form of a large party held on the main quads attended by scavenger hunt participants and nonparticipants alike.&lt;ref name="Maroon2008"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://chicagomaroon.com/2008/05/09/scav-hunt-festivities-consume-campus/ | title=Scav Hunt festivities consume campus | publisher=The Chicago Maroon | date=9 May 2008 | accessdate=16 May 2015 | author=Yang, Mimi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually, this party involved a theme. Each team would design their own section of the party with drinks and attire adhering to this theme.

This long string of parties ended when, in 2006, during a particularly bad storm, the party was moved inside Cobb Hall. The theme that year was "visions of the future." ORCSA, the university administration body responsible for overseeing the Hunt, shut down the party due to intoxicated participants and alleged property damage.&lt;ref name="Maroon2006Party"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://chicagomaroon.com/2006/05/16/scav-hunt-party-in-cobb-shut-down-2/ | title=Scav Hunt party in Cobb shut down | publisher=The Chicago Maroon | date=16 May 2006 | accessdate=16 May 2015 | author=Brown, Aaron}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Ready for battle (4590500259).jpg|thumb|A Scav participant wearing a suit of armor made of sponges during the 2010 hunt]]
Scav Hunt was founded in 1987 by Chris Straus, who organized the list and judged items collected by other residents of Hitchcock house, with Cassie Scharff, Diane Kelly, and [[Nolan McCarty]].&lt;ref name=NewYorker2012 /&gt;&lt;ref name="CollegeSecretHistory"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://college.uchicago.edu/uniquely-chicago/story/secret-history | title=Secret History: What do the Senior Class Gift and Scav Hunt have in common? Christopher Straus, LAB’84, AB’88, MD’92, tells all. | publisher=The College of the University of Chicago | date=1 August 2012 | accessdate=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the most notable item that has yet been completed was from the 1999 list; a [[breeder reactor]] in a shed was successfully built in front of Ida Noyes Hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scavhunt1.uchicago.edu/lists/1999/node2.html|title=Items|accessdate=22 February 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080309222750/http://scavhunt1.uchicago.edu/lists/1999/node2.html|archivedate=9 March 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The item itself was a joke referring to the "Radioactive Boy Scout" [[David Hahn]]. The students irradiated [[thorium]] with [[thermal neutrons]] and observed traces of [[uranium]] and [[plutonium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-news.uchicago.edu/citations/99/990519.scavhunt.nyt.html|title=In Chicago, Ph.D.'s Take a Back Seat to a Degree of Silliness|accessdate=22 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Scav Hunt was the subject of a documentary titled ''The Hunt''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://periphrastic.com/about.html|title=The Hunt|accessdate=22 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2007 Scav Hunt was also the subject of a documentary, ''Scavengers''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thecore.uchicago.edu/springsummer08/the-searchers.shtml|title=The Searchers|accessdate=16 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Scav Hunt formerly held the [[Guinness World Record]] for largest scavenger hunt.&lt;ref name=Baker2014/&gt; To obtain the record, the Judges organized a miniature scavenger hunt during the 2011 Hunt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dries|first1=Katie|title=In its 25th year, University of Chicago Scavenger Hunt breaks a world record|url=http://www.wbez.org/story/its-25th-year-university-chicago-scavenger-hunt-breaks-world-record-86200|accessdate=17 May 2015|publisher=[[Chicago Public Media]]|date=7 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The smaller event was required to meet the Guinness World Record definition of a scavenger hunt. The Scav Hunt has since been officially surpassed for the title of the world's largest scavenger hunt by "Passport to Provo," an event organized by [[Provo, Utah|Provo]] and [[Google]].&lt;ref name=Baker2014/&gt;

== Judges ==
[[File:The University of Chicago is watching you (5694539537).jpg|thumb|Enormous [[googly eyes]] attached to Harper Memorial Library during the 2011 hunt]]
The Scavenger Hunt committee is a [[University of chicago#Student organizations|registered student organization]] at the University of Chicago. The committee is made up of judges, those who make the list and determine item completion, and non-judges, who help with other administrative tasks. Judges are known as "Hot Side Hot" while non-judge members are known as "Cold Side Cold".&lt;ref name=bylaws&gt;{{cite web|title=Bylaws|url=http://scavhunt.uchicago.edu/bore.html|work=The University of Chicago Scavenger Hunt|accessdate=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The list is compiled solely by the panel of judges, though the panel also organizes other aspects of the Scav Hunt. Judges begin compiling the list after the end of each Scav Hunt weekend, and continue to add items throughout the year. Members of the panel, of course, are sworn to secrecy of the contents of next year's list.

Any University of Chicago student with a GPA above 0.5 may apply to be a judge.&lt;ref name=bylaws /&gt; Potential judges submit applications consisting of a questionnaire and a sample list of 30 items. Applicants are chosen to interview with the existing judges based on merit. New judges are often previous team captains or perennial participants of the Hunt. Actual methods of judge selection, however, are kept secret. Fragments of the sample lists of the newly chosen judges are often added to next year's list. Applications for new judges open at the beginning of October. New judges are selected by the end of the calendar year. Judges are appointed for life, but are required to maintain eligibility to join a student organization to remain active.&lt;ref name=about&gt;{{cite web|title=About|url=http://scavhunt.uchicago.edu/lore.html|work=The University of Chicago Scavenger Hunt|accessdate=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The head judge, known as the Scavenczar, is appointed at the end of the Scavenger Hunt each year. He or she oversees the planning and execution of the next Scav Hunt, until his or her successor is named.&lt;ref name=bylaws /&gt;

'''''War and Peace''''' ('''Op. 91''') ({{lang-ru|Война и мир}}, ''Voyna i mir'') is an [[opera]] in two parts (an Epigraph and 13 scenes), sometimes arranged as five acts, by [[Sergei Prokofiev]] to a Russian [[libretto]] by the composer and [[Mira Mendelson]], based on the novel ''[[War and Peace]]'' by [[Leo Tolstoy]]. Although Tolstoy's work is classified as a novel, the [[1812 invasion of Russia]] by the French was based on real-life events, and some real-life people appear as characters in both the novel and the opera, e.g. Prince [[Mikhail Illarionovich Kutuzov|Mikhail Kutuzov]] and [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]].

==Composition history==
Mendelson and Prokofiev's original scheme for the libretto of the opera envisaged 11 scenes, and Prokofiev began composing the music in the summer of 1942, spurred on by the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of the Soviet Union]] which began on June 22, 1941. The description "lyric-dramatic scenes" in the libretto accurately suggests both a homage to [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]]'s [[Eugene Onegin (opera)|''Eugene Onegin'']] and an emphasis on individuals and their emotions rather than on the bigger picture of a country at war.

A piano score was completed by the summer of 1942 (two scenes having been changed from the original version), and it was submitted to the [[Soviet Union]]'s Committee on the Arts. The Committee demanded that the Part 2 (War) scenes needed a more patriotic and heroic emphasis. Prokofiev, who had wanted to see his masterpiece staged as quickly as possible, added marches, choruses, and other materials to Part 2 to satisfy the committee. In addition, he composed the choral Epigraph, which emphasises the Russian people's defiance in the face of the enemy.

==Performance history==
Plans were drawn up for a 1943 première at the [[Bolshoi Theatre]], [[Moscow]], to be directed by [[Sergei Eisenstein]] and conducted by [[Samuil Samosud]]. Nothing came of this project, although a private performance of eight scenes with piano accompaniment took place at the [[Moscow]] Actors’ Centre on October 16, 1944, and a public concert performance of nine scenes, conducted by Samosud, was given in the Great Hall of the [[Moscow Conservatory]] on June 7, 1945.

The first staged performance was of a newly extended seven-scene version of Part 1 (what is now Scene 2 having been added at Samosud’s suggestion), together with Scene 8, the first scene of Part 2. This took place on June 12, 1946, at the [[Mikhailovsky Theatre|Maly Theatre]] (before the Revolution - Mikhailovsky Theatre) in [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]], again conducted by Samosud. Part 2, also with an additional scene (Scene 10), was to be performed there in July 1947, but after the dress rehearsal no public performances were given, “for reasons beyond the control of the theatre and the composer”.

Following the [[Zhdanov decree]] of February 1948, Prokofiev started work on a shortened single-evening version of the opera, at the same time making various revisions to his original scheme, although the thirteen-scene framework remained.  This version was first performed on 26 May 1953, at the [[Teatro Comunale Florence|Teatro Comunale]], [[Florence]], conducted by [[Artur Rodziński]], two months after the composer’s death.  Scenes 2 and 9 were, however, omitted.  The Russian première of this version was given at the Maly Theatre, Leningrad, on April 1, 1955, conducted by [[Eduard Grikurov]], in this case with the omission of Scenes 7 and 11.  All thirteen scenes (but with cuts) were eventually first performed together on November 8, 1957, at the [[Stanislavski-Nemirovich-Danchenko Theatre]] in Moscow, under the baton of Samosud's assistant [[Alexander Shaverdov]]. On December 15, 1959, the 13 scenes and Epigraph were finally staged uncut (conducted by [[Alexander Melik-Pashayev]]) at the Bolshoi Theatre, Moscow, although this was preceded in the United States by an [[NBC]] telecast conducted by [[Peter Herman Adler]] on January 13, 1957.

The first British performance was a [[Leeds Festival (classical music)|Leeds Festival]] concert performance at [[Leeds Town Hall]] on April 19, 1967 (conductor [[Edward Downes]]). The first British staged performance was by [[English National Opera|Sadlers’ Wells Opera]] on October 11, 1972, and the first American staging by the [[Opera Company of Boston]] on May 8, 1974. In other countries, the thirteen-scene version of the opera was first performed in Germany ([[Bonn]]) and [[Bulgaria]] ([[Sofia]]) in 1957, [[Serbia]] ([[Belgrade]]) in 1958, [[Croatia]] ([[Zagreb]]) in 1961, the [[Czech Republic]] ([[Liberec]]) in 1962, France ([[Théâtre des Champs-Élysées]], [[Paris]], in concert) and Canada ([[Montreal]]) in 1967, Austria ([[Vienna State Opera]], conducted by [[Mstislav Rostropovich]]) in 1971, Australia (the opening performance at the [[Sydney Opera House]]) and Argentina ([[Teatro Colón]], [[Buenos Aires]]) in 1973, Spain ([[Liceu]], [[Barcelona]]) in 1977 and the Netherlands ([[Amsterdam]], conducted by [[Edo de Waart]]) in 1991. The [[Canadian Opera Company]] performed the opera as part of its 2008-09 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coc.ca/performances/war.html|title=Canadian Opera Company's website|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Original version===

In 2010 Prokofiev's original version of the opera, edited by [[Rita McAllister]], was premiered in [[Glasgow]], in a collaboration between [[Scottish Opera]] and the [[Royal Conservatoire of Scotland]] (formerly [[RSAMD]]). This briefer version represents Prokofiev's thoughts in 1941, before the various additions and amendments he assembled over the years. It runs some 90 minutes shorter than the later version.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rcs.ac.uk/aboutus/theexchange/funded_projects_and_partnerships/past_projects/war_and_piece.html  Information on the Scottish Opera's ''War and Peace''] on rcs.ac.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==

===Part 1 (Peace)===
The '''Overture''' or the '''Epigraph''' usually precedes the action

''Scene 1: After dark, in the garden of Count Rostov's country estate, May, 1806''

Andrei, who is a guest there, is depressed by the loss of his wife. Natasha, who also cannot sleep, looks out of her window and tells Sonya how beautiful the garden looks in the moonlight, and Andrei recovers his spirits.

''Scene 2: New Year's Eve, 1810''

At a ball in St Petersburg attended by the Tsar, Pierre encourages Andrei, who is attracted to Natasha, to ask her to dance.  Anatole, also attracted to her, asks Hélène to arrange an introduction.

''Scene 3: Town house of Prince Nikolai, February 1812''

Count Rostov and Natasha visit Prince Nikolai's home. He is the father of Andrei, to whom she is engaged. Andrei has been abroad for a year. Princess Marya indicates that her father will not see them, and Count Rostov departs. However, the Prince, dressed eccentrically and behaving boorishly, does appear, and Natasha realises that he does not approve of the marriage.

''Scene 4:  Pierre's Moscow house, May 1812''

Hélène tells Natasha that Anatole is attracted to her, and, after some hesitation, Natasha hears his declaration of love and agrees to meet him.

''Scene 5: Dolokhov's apartment, 12 June 1812''

Dolokhov has made the arrangements for his friend Anatole's elopement with Natasha.  The coach-driver Balaga, Dolokhov and Anatole drink to the escapade and to the latter's mistress Matriosha.

''Scene 6: Later that night''

Natasha discovers that Sonya has given away her secret to Madame Akhrosimova, with whom they are staying. Anatole and Dolokhov are sent away by Gavrila, and Akhrosimova reduces Natasha to tears. Pierre arrives, reveals that Anatole is married, and agrees to ask Andrei to forgive Natasha. He shyly admits that he himself would want to marry her if he were free. Natasha makes her peace with Sonya.

''Scene 7: Later still''

Hélène is entertaining Anatole, Metivier and an Abbé. Pierre, returning home, upbraids Anatole and demands that he leave Moscow immediately. He agrees, and Pierre is left alone to bemoan his own circumstances. Denisov arrives with the news that Napoleon and his army are crossing into Russia.  War is inevitable.

===Part 2 (War)===
The '''Epigraph''' is usually performed here if it was not used at the start of Part 1.

''Scene 8: Near Borodino, 25 August 1812''

Amid preparations for the defence of Moscow, Andrei and Denisov discuss utilising partisans to make life difficult for Napoleon's army.  Pierre, wanting to observe the scene, arrives, and he and Andrei embrace, perhaps for the last time. Field-Marshal Kutuzov offers Andrei a position on his staff, but Andrei prefers to go into battle with his own regiment. The battle starts.

''Scene 9: Later that day''

Napoleon ponders his position, first refusing to commit more men, then agreeing. An unexploded cannonball lands at his feet and he kicks it away.

''Scene 10: Two days later''

Kutuzov and his generals are holding a Council of War at Fili, near Smolensk. The army will be at risk if Moscow is to be defended to the last - but if the army retreats, Moscow will be at the mercy of the French. Kutuzov decides that only by retreating, and potentially sacrificing Moscow, will there be any hope of victory.

''Scene 11: Moscow is burning''

The city is on fire because its citizens try to avoid a surrender. Pierre is caught up among some Muscovites, including the veteran Platon Karataev, who are accused by the French of fire-raising. As the asylum and theatre burn, lunatics and actresses flee - but Napoleon has to admit that the courage of the people has frustrated his plans.

''Scene 12: In a peasant's hut at Mitishi''

The wounded Prince Andrei, delirious, has been evacuated with the Rostovs from Moscow. Natasha, who had been unaware that he was among her fellow evacuees, visits him. She tries to apologise for her conduct, but he again declares his love for her, and they sing of their happiness as Natasha reassures him that he will live. He falls asleep, and his heartbeat (conveyed by an offstage chorus) stops for ever.

''Scene 13: November, 1812''

On the road to Smolensk, the retreating French are escorting a group of prisoners through a snow-storm. Karataev cannot keep up and is shot, but Pierre and the others are rescued by the partisans. Denisov tells Pierre that Andrei is dead but that Natasha is alive and well. Kutuzov and his men rejoice in their victory, and celebrate the indomitable will of the Russian people.

==Music==
Broadly speaking, the music for Part 1 is lyrical and that for Part 2 is dramatic. There are a number of arias, though these are rarely free-standing and are usually preceded and/or followed by arioso or short conversational passages. Dance music is prominent in Part 1, military music and choruses in Part 2. A number of themes, associated especially with Natasha, Andrei and Pierre, recur throughout the opera. Prokofiev borrowed Natasha's and Andrei's principal themes from incidental music that he had written for a dramatisation of [[Alexander Pushkin|Pushkin]]'s ''[[Eugene Onegin]]'': Natasha's theme had been associated with Lensky, and Andrei's with Tatyana. Kutuzov's aria in Scene 10 (also sung by the chorus at the end of the opera) re-used [[Ivan the Terrible (Prokofiev)|music]] that Prokofiev had written for [[Sergei Eisenstein|Eisenstein]]'s film ''[[Ivan the Terrible (1944 film)|Ivan the Terrible]]''.

==Hymn of the World Youth Day 1987==

THE NEW CIVILIZATION

The WYD Hymn of Buenos Aires 1987, popularly known as "Un Nuevo Sol" was composed by Alberto Croce and Eugenio Perpetua. 

A land that has no borders
but hands that together will form
a stronger chain
that war and that death.

We know it, love is the path

A more just and fraternal homeland
where we all build unity
where nobody is displaced,
because all are called.

We know...

A new sun rises
about the new civilization
that is born today.
A stronger chain
that hate and that death
We know it, love is the path.

Justice is the force of peace
love, who makes forgive.
The truth, the force that gives us liberation.

We know...

The one who has shares his wealth
and the one who knows does not impose his truth.
The boss understands
that power is a service.

We know...

The one who believes contagious with his life
and the pain is covered with love
because the man feels supportive
in solidarity with the world.

We know...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/laity/documents/rc_pc_laity_doc_20020324_hymns-youth-days_it.html#UN|title=Inni delle Giornate Mondiali della Gioventù|website=www.vatican.va|accessdate=21 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kraemer, pg.106&lt;/ref&gt; but was killed by the Abbasid forces led by [[Al-Husayn ibn Isma'il al-Mus'abi|Hussain ibn Isma’il]], who had been sent to deal with him.

==Sequence of events of Yahya’s life==
[[File:Iraq-CIA WFB Map.png|right|thumb|250px|Map of Iraq, where Yahya ibn Umar conducted his revolt]]
The following is a sequence of events of Yahya’s life:
*In 850 C.E. [[Al-Mutawakkil]] brought Yahya from one of the Abbasid provinces in order to punish him, after he had reportedly assembled a group of supporters. Umar ibn Faraj al-Rukhkhaj [[Al-Sijistani]]&lt;ref&gt;Incipient decline, By Tabarī, Joel L. Kraemer, pg.74&lt;/ref&gt; (one of the Abbasid’s official secretaries who had purchased land for the founding of [[Samarra]])&lt;ref&gt;Incipient decline, By Ṭabarī, Joel L. Kraemer, pg.35, 62&lt;/ref&gt; flogged him 18 lashes and he was incarcerated in [[Baghdad]] in the Matbaq Prison before being released.&lt;ref&gt;Incipient decline, By Ṭabarī, Joel L. Kraemer, pg.105-106&lt;/ref&gt;
*Yahya was hard pressed by his creditors and sought a grant from Umar ibn Faraj, but was harshly denied. He thus cursed Umar ibn Faraj and as a result was imprisoned, but was later set free. He then moved to live in Baghdad, but was still suffering from hardship. He then went to Samarra where he met another man whom he asked for a grant, but was again harshly denied.&lt;ref&gt;The crisis of the ʻAbbāsid Caliphate, By Ṭabarī, George Saliba, pg.15&lt;/ref&gt;
*Yahya then went to Kufa, where he rebelled in 864 C.E. His uprising seems to have been a rash course of action. In Kufa, Yahya gathered a great throng of Bedouins and a contingent of Kufa also rallied around him. He then marched to [[Fallujah|Al-Fallujah]] and encamped at a village known as al-‘Umud. He then marched to Kufa and proceeded as far as the treasury, where he took whatever he found. Following this, he declared his rebellion in Kufa. He then liberated the two prisons of Kufa of all those interred. He then left Kufa for its agricultural hinterland (the [[Sawad]]) and settled in a place called Bustan. He was followed and supported by a group of [[Zaidiyyah|Zaydis]], Bedouins living near Bustan and people from other certain places near Kufa. After establishing himself at Bustan his followers grew in number.&lt;ref&gt;The crisis of the ʻAbbāsid Caliphate, By Ṭabarī, George Saliba, pg.15-17]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Yahya routed an Abbasid force sent to defeat him in a fierce battle near the Kufa bridge.&lt;ref&gt;The crisis of the ʻAbbāsid Caliphate, By Ṭabarī, George Saliba, pg.17&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Zaydis propagandized that he was the chosen one (al-Rida) of [[Ahl al-Bayt|Muhammad’s family]]. This increased his popularity and even the mob of Baghdad held him in high esteem. In Kufa a group of experienced [[Shia|Shiites]] swore allegiance to him, along with other people. While he was in Kufa he was making preparations for his forces, while the Abbasid forces sent to defeat him were also making the necessary preparations.&lt;ref name="Abbāsid Caliphate pg.18"&gt;The crisis of the ʻAbbāsid Caliphate, By Ṭabarī, George Saliba, pg.18&lt;/ref&gt;
*On the 13th [[Rajab]] (20 August) 864 C.E. he marched against the Abbasid forces of Hussain ibn Isma’il, after being urged to do so by his followers.&lt;ref name="Abbāsid Caliphate pg.18"/&gt;
*The next day, Yahya’s forces attacked Hussain ibn Isma’il forces,  but were defeated and fled, abandoning Yahya on the battlefield.&lt;ref name="Abbāsid Caliphate pg.18"/&gt;
*Yahya was then beheaded on the battlefield in Rajab 250 A.H. (August 864 C.E.) and his head was mutilated. His  head was then sent to Al-Musta'in, from where it was displayed at the public gate in Samarra.&lt;ref&gt;The crisis of the ʻAbbāsid Caliphate, By Ṭabarī, George Saliba, pg.19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZY-HUxd2eRgC&amp;pg=PA75&amp;dq=Yahya+ibn+Umar&amp;lr=&amp;cd=23#v=onepage&amp;q=Yahya%20ibn%20Umar&amp;f=false Ibn Abī Ṭāhir Ṭayfūr and Arabic writerly culture: a ninth-century bookman in ..., By Shawkat M.

Some of Yahya’s companions did not accept the news that he was defeated and killed. Instead, they believed that he was not killed and he only hid himself and went into [[The Occultation|occultation]] and that he was the [[Mahdi]] and the [[Al-Qa'im (person)|Qa’im]], who will reappear another time. 

His revolt had an interesting sequel in 255 A.H. (868-69 C.E.), when ʿAlī ibn Muḥammad, the leader of the [[Zanj Rebellion]], claimed to be the incarnated form of Yahya.&lt;ref&gt; name="The History of al-Tabari Vol. 34 Incipient Decline" author="Ṭabarī, Joel L. Kraemer" pg.106&lt;/ref&gt;

==Elegies written for Yahya==
[[Al-Masudi]] mentions that many [[Elegy|elegies]] were written for Yahya, and that he had recorded some of them in his Kitab al-Awsat (The Middle Book). But in his book [[The Meadows of Gold]], it is the elegy by Ibn Abi Tahir Tayfur (which Al-Masudi alone had preserved) that he gives pride of place. Ibn Abi Tahir’s elegy on the crucified Zaydi rebel is composed of 14 lines and the poem was possibly recited in Samarra, where Yahya’s head was displayed, or else before the large crowds that are known to have gathered in Baghdad. In the elegy, Ibn Abi Tahir attacks the [[Sunni]] Abbasid Caliphal family for its usurpation of the rights of the house of Ali.&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Abī Ṭāhir Ṭayfūr and Arabic writerly culture: a ninth-century bookman in ..., By Shawkat M. Toorawa, pg.39, 74-75, 127&lt;/ref&gt;

Ibn al-Rumi (d.283 A.H. / 896 C.E.) also published elegies on Yahya.&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Abī Ṭāhir Ṭayfūr and Arabic writerly culture: a ninth-century bookman in ..., By Shawkat M. Toorawa, pg.75&lt;/ref&gt;
