'''[[Canada]]'s 2008 annual [[Commerce|commercial]] [[seal hunting|seal hunt]]''' in the [[Gulf of St. Lawrence]] and around [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], [[Quebec]] and [[Nova Scotia]] began on March 28. The hunting season lasts from mid-November to mid-May, but the hunt mainly occurs in March and April.&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;{{cite news|title=Canada defiant over annual seal pup cull |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/main.jhtml?xml=/earth/2008/03/26/easeal126.xml |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=2008-03-26 |accessdate=2008-03-29 |location=London |first=Tom |last=Leonard |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080328162438/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/main.jhtml?xml=%2Fearth%2F2008%2F03%2F26%2Feaseal126.xml |archivedate=28 March 2008 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Canada's seal hunt is the world's largest hunt for [[marine mammal]]s.&lt;ref name=Gillies/&gt;

Some [[animal rights]] groups were given observer permits and monitored the hunt. They said it was cruel and that it ravaged the seal population. Sealers said it was sustainable, humane, and well-managed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rockymountainnews.com/news/2008/mar/29/canadas-seal-hunt-begins-amid-wary-eyes-improved/ Canada's seal hunt begins amid wary eyes, improved population], ''[[Rocky Mountain News]]'', March 29, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

== 2008 regulations ==

A new rule in the [[Marine Mammal Regulations]] for 2008 required hunters to slit the seal's [[Pulmonary artery|main arteries]] under its [[flipper (anatomy)|flipper]]s, after clubbing or shooting a seal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,23450210-23109,00.html Annual seal hunt begins], ''[[The Herald Sun]]'', March 29, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Union]] recommended  adding this rule in a report released in December 2007.&lt;ref name="hunt"&gt;{{cite news|title=Canada's Contentious Seal Hunt Begins |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/feedarticle/7419976 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=2008-03-28 |accessdate=2008-03-29 |location=London |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080401024645/http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/feedarticle/7419976 |archivedate=2008-04-01 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was to prevent the seal from having to withstand the pain of being skinned alive.

== Vessels ==

=== Four men missing ===
{{main|L'Acadien II}}
On March 29, 2008, a 12-metre fishing vessel with six men, ''[[L'Acadien II]]'', [[capsize]]d near [[Cape Breton Regional Municipality, Nova Scotia|Cape Breton]]. Navy [[Underwater diving|divers]] searched the waters for four men, who had been sleeping in the lower decks of the vessel. Two men, who were at the upper decks, were rescued on to another fishing boat. The vessel had capsized when it was being towed by the Canadian Coast Guard's ''[[CCGS Sir William Alexander|Sir William Alexander]]''. The ''L'Acadien II'' took part in the seal hunt, and had to be towed because of a steering problem. When the vessel had capsized, a [[CH-149 Cormorant|Cormorant helicopter]] and a [[C-130 Hercules|Hercules aircraft]] came to aid the rescue. The vessel had since been secured to the side of the Coast Guard's vessel.&lt;ref name="capsize"&gt;{{cite news|title=Four men still missing after fishing boat on seal hunt capsizes |url=http://www.canada.com/topics/news/story.html?id=9e91b88a-0ea7-4339-8f5d-733368599aa3&amp;k=17366 |publisher=[[Canada.com]] |date=2008-03-29 |accessdate=2008-03-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080529074521/http://www.canada.com/topics/news/story.html?id=9e91b88a-0ea7-4339-8f5d-733368599aa3&amp;k=17366 |archivedate=2008-05-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The navy divers recovered the bodies of three of the missing men on March 29, with one man still missing. The men who died were from the [[Magdalen Islands]].

=== Technical problems ===

On the evening of March 28, it was reported that two sealing vessels were taking in water, and one vessel had mechanical problems, in heavy [[ice]] conditions off Cape Breton. Two [[icebreaker]]s were sent out to help the vessels out of the ice.&lt;ref name="four"&gt;{{cite news|title=Four men missing after fishing vessel capsizes off Cape Breton |url=http://canadianpress.google.com/article/ALeqM5j1UFS2QxJWNFivIixTzn2F2pIQZw |publisher=[[Canadian Press]] |date=2008-03-29 |accessdate=2008-03-29 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 29, the coast guard and [[Department of National Defence (Canada)|Department of Defence]] rescued seven people before their vessel, the ''Annie Marie'', was crushed in the ice pack northeast off Cape Breton.&lt;ref&gt;[https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/story.html?id=410875 Questions for Coast Guard after sealers drown during rescue]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''[[National Post]]'', March 30, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allheadlinenews.com/articles/7010483024 Conservationists Renew Call To Stop Seal Hunt] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080404000319/http://www.allheadlinenews.com/articles/7010483024 |date=2008-04-04 }}, [[All Headline News|AHN]], March 30, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 14, the vessel ''Lucy May'' [[burn]]t to the waterline on Newfoundlands's northeast coast, after the crew had been rescued by a [[CH-149 Cormorant|Cormorant]] helicopter. Also on April 14, the vessel ''BS Venture'' had mechanical trouble on Newfoundland's west coast, and six men escaped from the vessel before it ran ashore. The men reached land safely in Rocky Harbour in a self-brought speedboat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/canada/newfoundland-labrador/story/2008/04/15/sealers-escape.html Sealers safe after fleeing ship drifting ashore], [[CBC News]], April 15, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=western&gt;[http://www.thewesternstar.com/index.cfm?sid=127323&amp;sc=506 Another vessel sinks off coast], ''[[The Western Star (Corner Brook)|The Western Star]]'', April 18, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The vessel ''White Bay Challenger'' started to take in water on April 17 because it had been struck by ice while it was being escorted by the Canadian Coast Guard Ship ''[[Canadian Coast Guard#Vessels: ships and small boats|Ann Harvey]]''. The ''White Bay Challenger'' sank after the seven people on board had been taken aboard the ''Ann Harvey''.&lt;ref name=western/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canada.com/windsorstar/news/story.html?id=f7d17845-1eaa-468d-bdf3-bbf5c8315f32 Third seal-hunt vessel abandoned] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105033140/http://www.canada.com/windsorstar/news/story.html?id=f7d17845-1eaa-468d-bdf3-bbf5c8315f32 |date=2012-11-05 }}, [[Canada.com]], April 18, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

== Observer permits ==

Journalists have a constitutional right to observe the hunt that was affirmed under a 1989 [[Federal Court of Appeal]] ruling. The federal government have a right to issue observer permits, to prevent the ice from being overcrowded with observers.&lt;ref name="globe"/&gt; A Seal Fishery Observation Licence in 2008 cost $25, and regulations on who is eligible for a license were found in the Marine Mammal Regulations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/ShowFullDoc/cr/SOR-93-56///en Marine Mammal Regulations (SOR/93-56)], [[Department of Justice Canada]],  (Regulation current to March 25th, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

After noon on March 28, federal fisheries officials issued observer permits for the hunt's opening day to [[activist]]s and [[journalist]]s.&lt;ref name="globe"&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20080329.HUNT29/TPStory/National Sealing begins in St. Lawrence], ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', March 29, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; A couple of hours before the permits were issued, Phil Jenkins of the [[Department of Fisheries and Oceans]] said: "We're going to delay the giving out of permits until we can understand what exact level of sealing is going on."&lt;ref name="issuing"&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/canada/nova-scotia/story/2008/03/28/hunt-observers.html DFO delays issuing seal hunt observer permits], [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]], March 28, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; When the permits were issued,&lt;ref name="globe"/&gt; the [[International Fund for Animal Welfare]] (IFAW) managed to fly out to film some scenes. The journalists (such as the United Kingdom's [[British Sky Broadcasting|Sky TV]]&lt;ref name="permits"/&gt;) and the representatives of the [[Humane Society of the United States]] (HSUS) were unable to make it to the ice floes because the weather had turned bad during the day, making it very hard to fly a helicopter.&lt;ref name="globe"/&gt; DFO spokesman Phil Jenkins said that 60 observer permits had been issued.&lt;ref name="permits"&gt;{{cite news|title=Seal hunters, protesters head for the ice floes |url=http://www.canada.com/story.html?id=ff72842d-5f5b-4503-b676-ec103414bbaa |publisher=[[Canada.com]] |date=2008-03-28 |accessdate=2008-03-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080529074626/http://www.canada.com/story.html?id=ff72842d-5f5b-4503-b676-ec103414bbaa |archivedate=2008-05-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The permits for March 29 were issued on the evening of March 28.&lt;ref name="globe"/&gt;

== Seals ==

According to the Marine Mammal Regulations, Canada does not allow the hunting of [[whitecoats]]. Whitecoats are suckling pups of the [[harp seal|harp]] or [[grey seal]] under two weeks of age.

Most of the seals that were hunted are young [[harp seal]]s, called beaters.&lt;ref name="newswire"/&gt; They were whelped (born) in February or early March in whelping patches on the ice. Such patches vary from 20 to 200 square kilometres, and may contain as many as 2,000 adult females per square kilometre.&lt;ref name=theharp&gt;[http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/zone/underwater_sous-marin/hseal/seal-phoque_e.htm The harp seal] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060207145022/http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/zone/underwater_sous-marin/hseal/seal-phoque_e.htm |date=February 7, 2006 }}, [[Fisheries and Oceans Canada]]&lt;/ref&gt; The pups are abandoned by their mothers at two weeks of age, and remain in the whelping patches until the ice starts to melt in March or early April.&lt;ref name=theharp/&gt; The hunt takes place in and around these whelping patches.&lt;ref name=tech&gt;[http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/misc/seal_briefing_e.htm Technical Briefing on the Harp Seal Hunt in Atlantic Canada] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528093724/http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/misc/Seal_briefing_e.htm |date=2008-05-28 }}, [[Fisheries and Oceans Canada]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== The R/V ''Farley Mowat'' protest ==

On March 24, the [[Sea Shepherd Conservation Society]]'s vessel, the [[Research vessel|R/V]] [[RV Farley Mowat|''Farley Mowat'']], left [[Bermuda]] to head for the [[Gulf of St. Lawrence]].&lt;ref name="sea"&gt;{{cite news|title=Sea Shepherd to monitor seal hunt |url=http://www.canada.com/edmontonjournal/news/story.html?id=3ad301e4-7a7c-4aba-a151-ce079bf8b9da |publisher=[[Edmonton Journal]] |date=2008-03-22 |accessdate=2008-03-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105033158/http://www.canada.com/edmontonjournal/news/story.html?id=3ad301e4-7a7c-4aba-a151-ce079bf8b9da |archivedate=2012-11-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The seventeen persons on the vessel were from the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, France, Sweden, South Africa, Canada and the United States.&lt;ref name=decry&gt;[http://www.canada.com/globaltv/bc/story.html?id=2fa0e7fc-5c3f-47a8-b7ff-a0dc53a65b18&amp;k=10047 Anti-seal hunt protesters decry Canada's 'act of war' in seizing their vessel] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104062629/http://www.canada.com/globaltv/bc/story.html?id=2fa0e7fc-5c3f-47a8-b7ff-a0dc53a65b18&amp;k=10047 |date=2012-11-04 }}, [[Canada.com]], April 13, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 21, [[Lawrence Cannon]] of the Canadian government had sent a fax to the ''Farley Mowat'', ordering it not to enter Canadian waters and warning it of prosecution if the order was not complied with. [[Paul Watson]] replied to the minister that the conventions of the [[International Maritime Organization]] apply to commercial ships, but the ''Farley Mowat'' is a [[Netherlands|Dutch]]-registered [[yacht]]. He said the ''Farley Mowat'' would enter the [[Exclusive Economic Zone#Canada|Canadian Economic Exclusion Zone]], but not the {{convert|12|nmi|km|adj=on}} territorial limit.&lt;ref name="newswire"&gt;{{cite news|title= Canada Orders Sea Shepherd to Stay Away from Seal Hunt|url=http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/mar2008/2008-03-24-02.asp|publisher=Environment News Service|date=2008-03-24|accessdate=2008-03-31| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080404044815/http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/mar2008/2008-03-24-02.asp| archivedate= 4 April 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Collision ===

On March 30, according to the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, the ''Farley Mowat'' was rammed twice by the icebreaker ''[[CCGS Des Groseilliers|Des Groseilliers]]'' of the [[Canadian Coast Guard]]. The collision occurred after the ''Farley Mowat'' failed to comply with a request from ''Des Groseilliers'' not to approach the [[seal hunt]] area. Plates on the ''Farley Mowat'' were buckled by the contact, but there was no other damage. Phil Jenkins of the [[Department of Fisheries and Oceans]] called the allegation "absolutely false."&lt;ref name="confrontation"&gt;{{cite news|title=Confrontation breaks out on high seas over East Coast seal hunt |url=http://www.ckwstv.com/news/national-news/20080331-Confrontation-Breaks-Out-On.html |publisher=[[CKWS-TV|CKWS]] |date=2008-03-31 |accessdate=2008-03-31 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="anti"&gt;{{cite news|title=Anti-sealing ship says it was rammed twice by Canadian Coast Guard icebreaker |url=http://www.ckwstv.com/news/national-news/20080331-Anti-sealing-Ship-Says-It.html |publisher=[[CKWS-TV|CKWS]] |date=2008-03-31 |accessdate=2008-03-31 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Loyola Hearn]], the [[Minister of Fisheries and Oceans]], issued a statement on March 31, saying the allegations were "completely untrue", and that the ''Farley Mowat'' manoeuvred itself in front of the ''Des Groseilliers'' to cause a collision as an attempt to provoke a confrontation and attract media attention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.streetinsider.com/Press+Releases/DFO:+Minister+Hearn+Calls+for+Extremist+Animal+Rights+Group+to+Respect+the+Safety+of+Sealers/3502097.html DFO: Minister Hearn Calls for Extremist Animal Rights Group to Respect the Safety of Sealers], StreetInsider.com, March 31, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Watson replied on the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society's [[website]], on April 1, that ''Des Groseilliers'' was faster and more manoeuvrable in the ice than the ''Farley Mowat'', and that the ''Farley Mowat'' was stopped when it was hit for the second time. He said the entire incident was captured on video by a man on board the ''Farley Mowat'', and the [[Humane Society of the United States]] (HSUS) helicopter was going to pick up the video on March 31, but had been [[Grounding (punishment)|grounded]] by the government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seashepherd.org/news/media_080401_1.html Hearn is Spinning a Tangled Web of Lies to Defend Government Incompetence] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080405202858/http://www.seashepherd.org/news/media_080401_1.html |date=2008-04-05 }}, [[Sea Shepherd Conservation Society]], April 1, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Sealer Shane Briand said the ''Farley Mowat'' came close to the hunters about sixty km off Cape Breton and broke up the ice under a hunter on March 30. He said his ship and crew was harassed{{by whom|date=September 2018}} until the ''Des Groseilliers'' arrived.&lt;ref name=decry/&gt;

=== Paul Watson's remarks ===

A release from the [[Sea Shepherd Conservation Society]] on April 2&lt;ref name="seaquotes"&gt;[http://www.seashepherd.org/news/media_080402_1.html Sea Shepherd News - Seal Slaughter Suspended for a Week] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080405194225/http://www.seashepherd.org/news/media_080402_1.html |date=2008-04-05 }}, [[Sea Shepherd Conservation Society]], April 2, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; said: "The Sea Shepherd Conservation Society recognizes that the deaths of four sealers is a tragedy but Sea Shepherd also recognizes that the slaughter of hundreds of thousands of seal pups is an even greater tragedy." [[Paul Watson]] was quoted in the same release as saying: "One of the sealers was quoted as saying that he felt absolutely helpless as he watched the boat sink with sealers on board. I can't think of anything that defines helplessness and fear more than a seal pup on the ice that can't swim or escape as it is approached by some cigarette smoking ape with a club. This is a seal nursery and these men are sadistic baby killers and that might offend some people but it is the unvarnished truth — they are vicious killers who are now pleading for sympathy because some of their own died while engaged in a viciously brutal activity."&lt;ref name="seaquotes"/&gt;

Because of these statements, the leader of the [[Green Party of Canada]], [[Elizabeth May]], decided on April 3 to resign from the [[advisory board]] of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thechronicleherald.ca/Canada/1047533.html Green party boss leaves advisory committee over Watson’s remarks], ''[[The Chronicle Herald]]'', April 4, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 4, angry fishermen used axes to cut the [[Mooring (watercraft)|mooring line]]s of the ''Farley Mowat'' in [[Saint-Pierre, Saint Pierre and Miquelon|Saint-Pierre]], where it was tied up. According to a fisherman, the ropes were cut because the fishermen of Saint-Pierre did not accept what Paul Watson had said. There had first been a confrontation between the activists and the fishermen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miamiherald.com/580/story/482114.html Seal hunt protesters chased from port], [[The Associated Press]], April 4, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thestar.com/News/Canada/article/410312 Seal hunt protestors chased from St-Pierre port], [[The Canadian Press]], April 4, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Charges ===

Captain Alexander Cornelissen was also charged under the Fisheries Act for obstructing or hindering a Fishery Officer, a fishery guardian, or an inspector.&lt;ref name="charges"/&gt;

On April 12, armed [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] officers&lt;ref name=highseas/&gt; [[wiktionary:close|board]]ed and seized the ''Farley Mowat''. They had first asked permission to board the vessel, but were refused. The ''Farley Mowat''{{'}}s captain and first officer were arrested.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/feedarticle/7458065 Canadian Police Seize Anti-Hunt Ship], ''[[The Guardian]]'', April 13, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Fisheries Department, the ''Farley Mowat'' was to be kept in [[Fisheries and Oceans Canada|DFO]] custody until a court ordered the release of the vessel.&lt;ref name=decry/&gt; According to Paul Watson of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, the boarding happened in [[international water]]s, and the ''Farley Mowat'' had never strayed into Canada's {{convert|12|nmi|km|adj=on}} territorial limit. He said this was proven in the ship's [[Logbook|logs]] and [[GPS]] records, which the Canadian authorities had seized.&lt;ref name=highseas&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20080414.SEAL14/TPStory/National Coast Guard seized ship on high seas, protesters say], ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', April 14, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Department of Fisheries and Oceans, the vessel was seized in Canadian national waters.&lt;ref name=highseas/&gt;

'''Aleksandër Vasilev Lilov''' ({{lang-bg|Александър Василев Лилов}}; 31 August 1933 – 20 July 2013) was a [[Bulgaria]]n politician and philosopher.

At his career's height during the [[People's Republic of Bulgaria]], he was described as the second most powerful man of the regime. However, he fell out of favor in 1983 and lost his power. He made a strong political comeback during the democratic transition and was elected chairman of the [[Bulgarian Communist Party]]. He led the party to transform and adapt to the post-communist era.  A party referendum supported his proposal to change the name to the [[Bulgarian Socialist Party]]. After winning the first [[Bulgarian Constitutional Assembly election, 1990|democratic elections]] he did not become prime minister himself, instead he eventually supported a multi-party government led by [[Dimitar Iliev Popov|Dimitar Popov]]. After losing the [[Bulgarian parliamentary election, 1991|1991 parliamentary elections]] he stepped down as party leader. In 2001 he retired as MP after having served for 39 years.

==Biography==
Aleksandar Lilov was born on 31 August 1933 in the village of [[Granichak (village)|Granichak]], northwestern [[Vidin Province]]. He graduated Bulgarian Studies (philosophy) at [[Sofia University]] in 1962 and graduated doctoral studies in communist Social Science at the Academy of Public Sciences in Moscow. In 1975 he became an associate at the institution of art at the [[Bulgarian Academy of Sciences]]. Six years later, he defended a doctoral thesis in 1981.&lt;ref name=Death /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bio /&gt; He died on 20 July 2013 at the age of 79.

==Political career==
Lilov joined the Dimitrov Young Communist League in Vidin and rose to the ranks of its central committee in 1963. Six years later he joined the central Party organ and in 1971 he became a prominent member of the Communist Party. Lilov was a member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the [[Bulgarian Communist Party]] from July 1974 to September 1983 and was also a secretary of the Central Committee of the Party from July 1972 to September 28, 1983. He was also a member of the [[State Council of Bulgaria]] from 1976 to 1983.&lt;ref name=Bio /&gt; By the end of the 70s he was viewed as the second most powerful member of the party. After the death of [[Lyudmila Zhivkova]] (General Secretary [[Todor Zhivkov]]'s daughter) in 1981, Lilov's power began to wane. In 1983 he was removed from the Politburo after criticizing the General Secretary for his economic mismanagement and apparent lack of interest in current issues.&lt;ref name=Bio /&gt;

After fading from the public view for six year, Lilov returned from Great-Britain - where he was when Zhivkov was forced to resign on November 10, 1989 - and was welcomed back among the leaders of the BCP. There he denounced the [[Revival Process]] (started by Zhivkov and internationally condemned) and allowed Bulgarian Muslims to reinstate their former names.&lt;ref name=Bio /&gt;

During the 14th emergency congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party (held in January - February 1990), the post of general secretary was abolished, and Lilov was elected to the new post of chairman. Under his leadership the party was dissolved and reorganized into the [[Bulgarian Socialist Party]] on April 3 following an party referendum.&lt;ref name=Bio /&gt; This transition brought about revolutionary change to the party's ideology, from Communism to Socialism (from [[far-left politics|far-left]] to [[left-wing politics|left-wing]]). Change was also brought to the way the party was run in order to dismantle the totalitarian apparatus in the country. In September he was reelected as party chairman by a margin of 2 to 1 against the hopes of the liberals in the party who sought to remove the remains of the former Communist regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WORLD : Bulgaria Socialists Reelect Lilov|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-09-25/news/mn-1340_1_socialist-party|work=World News|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=25 September 1990|accessdate=9 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He remained the party's leader until the end of 1991.

He led the Socialists through the first democratic elections in [[Bulgarian Constitutional Assembly election, 1990|1990]], elected to adopt a new constitution, where his party won a majority of the seats (211 out of 400) and 47.15% of the votes. He did not become Prime Minister himself, instead continuing his support for the socialist government in place led by [[Andrey Lukanov]]. This came to an end when mass demonstrations and a general strike led to the formation of a government under the non-partisan judge [[Dimitar Iliev Popov|Dimitar Popov]] in which the BSP participated alongside the [[Union of Democratic Forces (Bulgaria)|UDF]], [[Bulgarian Agrarian National Union|BANU]] and independent experts.

His second election campaign in [[Bulgarian parliamentary election, 1991|1991]] ended with defeat after his electoral alliance won only 33.1% of the votes and 106 seats (out of 240); finishing behind the [[Union of Democratic Forces (Bulgaria)|Union of Democratic Forces]] who won 34.4% of the votes and 110 seats. Later that year he stepped down and as chairman of the party and was succeeded by [[Zhan Videnov]]. Lilov remained a Member of Parliament until 2001, a seat he held for 39 years (1962–2001).&lt;ref name=Bio /&gt; In 2001 he was the longest serving member of parliament.&lt;ref name=Death /&gt;

Of Netherlandic and Jewish ancestry,&lt;ref&gt;"Johnson, Alexander Bryan", in ''[[Chambers Biographical Dictionary]]'' (1990), Edinburgh:  Chambers.&lt;/ref&gt; he was born in [[Gosport]], [[Hampshire]], [[England]], [[United Kingdom]] and at age 16 he emigrated to the United States, and settled at [[Utica, New York|Utica]], where he was a banker for many years. He was admitted to the [[Bar (law)|bar]], but never practised.

==Family==
He married Abigail Louisa Smith Adams (1798-1836), daughter of [[Charles Adams (1770-1800)]] and Sally Smith, niece of [[William Stephens Smith]], and granddaughter of [[John Adams]] and [[Abigail Adams]].  She died of uterine cancer.&lt;ref&gt;Adams Genealogy [http://masshist.org/adamsgenealogy.cfm#charles]{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} .&lt;/ref&gt;

His son, [[Alexander S. Johnson|Alexander Smith Johnson]], was born in Utica in 1817, served as a judge, and died in [[Nassau, Bahamas]] in 1878.&lt;ref&gt;"Johnson, Alexander Smith", in ''Concise [[Dictionary of American Biography]]'' (1964), New York:  Scribner's.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
From his youth he had given all his leisure to the study of problems in intellectual philosophy, and especially of the relations between knowledge and language. He attempted to show the ultimate meaning of words, apart from their meaning as related to each other in ordinary definition, and thus to ascertain the nature of human knowledge as it exists independent of the words in which it is expressed.

His 1836 work, ''A Treatise on Language'', was little recognised in his own time, and this remained the case for nearly a century after his death. It can now be seen to have anticipated the thrust of [[logical positivism]], at least in arguing that misunderstandings of how language operates bedevil philosophical questions, and theories of modern [[linguistics]].

==Writings==
*''Philosophy of Human Knowledge, or a Treatise on Language'' (New York, 1828)
*''Treatise on Language, or the Relation which Words bear to Things'' (1836)
*''Religion in its Relation to the Present Life'' (1840), in which he aims to establish the congruity of Christian precepts with man's physical, intellectual, and emotional nature
*''The Meaning of Words Analyzed into Words and Unverbal Things, and Unverbal Things Classified into Intellections, Sensations, and Emotions'' (1854), in which he confesses that he had been 50 years in arriving at a clear comprehension of the object of his search
*''Physiology of the Senses, or How and What we See, Hear, Taste, Feel, and Smell'' (1856)
*''Encyclopaedia of Instruction, or Apologues and Breviates on Men and Manners'' (1857)
*''The Philosophical Emperor: A Political Experiment; or The Progress of a False Proposition'' (New York, 1841), attributed to him
He wrote several works on financial and political topics.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10648">'''Anutpada''' is a Buddhist concept for the absence of an origin. 

==Etymology==
"Anutpāda" means "having no origin", "not coming into existence", "not taking effect", "non-production".&lt;ref&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?script=HK&amp;beginning=0+&amp;tinput=anutpAda+&amp;trans=Translate&amp;direction=AU Sanskrit Dictionary for Spoken Sanskrit, ''Anutpāda'']&lt;/ref&gt;
* "An" also means "not", or "non"
* "Utpāda" means "genesis", "coming forth", "birth"&lt;ref&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=utpAda&amp;script=&amp;direction=SE&amp;link=yes Sanskrit Dictionary for Spoken Sanskrit, ''Utpāda'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage in Buddhist tradition==
The Buddhist tradition uses the term "anutpāda" for the absence of an origin{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=157}}{{sfn|Bhattacharya|1943|p=49}} or [[sunyata]] (voidness).{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=160}} ''Anutpāda'' means that ''[[dharma]]s'', the constituting elements of reality, do not come into existence.{{sfn|King|1995|p=113}} [[Atiśa]]:
{{quote|One may wonder, "From where did all this come in the first place, and to where does it depart now?" Once examined in this way, [one sees that] it neither comes from anywhere nor departs to anywhere. All inner and outer phenomena are [[Tathatā|just like that]].{{sfn|Brunholzl|2004|p=295}}{{refn|group=note|Brunholzl quotes Atisha's ''Centrist Pith Instructions, Called The Open jewel Casket''.}}{{refn|group=note|Compare the [[Upanishads]], for example the [[Mundaka Upanishad]], where the same question is being asked, but where the answer is that [[Brahman]] is the origin of All.}}}}

[[Chandrakirti]], in his ''Yuktisastikavrrti'', states:
{{quote|Nagarjuna taught, "bereft of beginning, middle, and end," meaning that the world is free from creation, duration, and destruction.&lt;ref&gt;Loizzo, Joesph ''Nagarjuna's Reason Sixty.'' American Institute of Buddhist Studies 2007, page 177.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to Nakamura in his study of Advaita  Vedanta, the Buddhist ''[[Paramārtha-satya|paramārtha]]'', "highest truth", is identified with ''anutpāda'' {{sfn|Nakamura|2004|p=255}} The term ''paramārtha'' is a synonym for [[tattva]], [[tathata]], [[sunyata]], [[Bhūmi (Buddhism)#The sixth bhūmi, the Manifest|animitta]], [[Buddha-nature#Vajrasamadhi-sutra (685 CE)|bhutakoti]] and [[dharmadhatu]].{{sfn|Nakamura|2004|p=255}} One who understands sunyata, anutpada and dependent arising, has realized the ultimate truth and gains nirvana. Nagarjuna:
{{quote|[67] Nothing exists by virtue of own-being, nor is there any non-being here. Being and non-being, born through causes and conditions, are empty.&lt;br&gt;
[68] Since all things are empty of own-being, the incomparable Tathagata teaches dependent co-origination regarding things.&lt;br&gt;
[69] The ultimate meaning consists in that! The perfect Buddhas, the Bhagavats, have [only] conceived the entire multiplicity in reliance upon worldly convention.&lt;br&gt;
[70] The worldly norms [dharmas] are not violated. In reality [the Tathagata] has not taught the Dharma. Not understanding the Tathagata's words, [fools] fear this spotless discourse.&lt;br&gt;
[71] The worldly principle, "This arises depending on that," is not violated. But since what is dependent lacks own-being, how can it exist? That is certain!&lt;br&gt;
[72] One with faith who tries to seek the truth, one who considers this principle logically [and] relies [upon] the Dharma that is lacking all supports leaves behind existence and non-existence [and abides in] peace.&lt;br&gt;
[73] When one understands that "This is a result of that/' the nets of bad views all vanish. Undefiled, one abandons desire, delusion, and hatred and gains nirvana.&lt;ref name="Seventy"&gt;[http://www.purifymind.com/Sutras5.htm Nagarjuna, ''Sunyatasaptati. Seventy Verses on Sunyata.'']&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''Anutpāda'' is one of the important features of the [[Prajnaparamita|Prajñāpāramitā Sutras]] and [[Madhyamaka]].{{refn|group=note|Buswell, Robert; Lopez, Donald S. Jr., eds. (2014), ''The Princeton Dictionary of Buddhism'', Princeton University Press pg. 945   "In the PRAJÑĀPĀRAMITĀ  literature  and  the MADHYAMAKA  school,  the  notion  of production  comes  under  specific criticism  (see VAJRAKAṆĀ),  with NĀGĀRJUNA  famously  asking,  e.g.,  how an  effect can be produced  from  a  cause that  is  either  the  same  as  or  different from  itself.  The  prajñāpāramitā  sūtras thus  famously declare  that  all  dharmas are  actually ANUTPĀDA,  or “unproduced.”"}}{{refn|group=note|King, Richard (1995), ''Early Advaita Vedānta and Buddhism: The Mahāyāna Context of the Gauḍapādīya-kārikā'', SUNY Press pg.113 "It is equally apparent that one of the important features of the Prajnaparamita positition is that of the nonarising (anutpada) of dharmas."}} The term is also being used in the [[Lankavatara Sutra]].{{sfn|Suzuki|1999}} According to D.T Suzuki, "anutpada" is not the opposite of "utpada", but transcends opposites. It is the [[Kensho|seeing into the true nature of existence]],{{sfn|Suzuki|1999|p=123-124}} the seeing that "all objects are [[Sunyata|without self-substance]]".{{sfn|Suzuki|1999|p=168}} Another well-known use is in [[Bankei Yōtaku|Bankei's]] "Unborn".{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005|p=316}}

==Influence on Gaudapada==
{{Main|Advaita Vedanta|Ajativada}}

Gaudapada-karika characterizes Brahman-Atman Absolute with the concept of "Ajātivāda". It is a fundamental philosophical doctrine of [[Gaudapada]].{{sfn|Sarma|1996|p=127}} In ''Gaudapada-Karika'', chapter III, verses 46-48, Gaudapada states that [[Brahman]] never arises, is never born, is never unborn, it rests in itself:
{{quote|
When the mind does not lie low, and is not again tossed about, then that being without movement, and not presenting any appearance, culminates into [[Brahman]]. Resting in itself, calm, with Nirvana, indescribable, highest happiness, unborn and one with the unborn knowable, omniscient they say. No creature whatever is born, no origination of it exists or takes place. This is that highest truth where nothing whatever is born.
|Gaudapada Karika|3.46-48, Translated by RD Karmarkar&lt;ref&gt;RD Karmarkar, [https://archive.org/stream/Gaudapada-Karika.English/Gaudapada-Karika#page/n83/mode/2up Gaudapada's Karika], Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to Gaudapada, the Absolute has no origin, and is not subject to [[Saṃsāra|birth, change and death]]. The Absolute is ''aja'', the unborn eternal.{{sfn|Sarma|1996|p=127}} The [[Empiricism|empirical world]] of [[phenomenon|appearances]] is considered [[Maya (illusion)|Maya]] (unreal, changing, transitory), and not [[Philosophical realism|ontologically independent reality]].{{sfn|Sarma|1996|p=127}}

Gaudapada's concept of "ajāta" is similar to Nagajurna's  Madhyamaka philosophy.{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=157}}{{sfn|Comans|2000|p=35-36}} The Buddhist tradition usually uses the term "anutpāda" for the absence of an origin{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=157}}{{sfn|Bhattacharya|1943|p=49}} or śūnyatā.{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=160}}

But Gaudapada's perspective is quite different from Nagarjuna.{{sfn|Comans|2000|p=36}} Gaudapada's perspective is based on the ''[[Mandukya Upanishad]]''.{{sfn|Comans|2000|p=36}} According to Gaudapada, Brahman cannot undergo alteration, so the phenomenal world cannot arise independently from Brahman. If the world cannot arise, yet is an empirical fact, than the world has to be an unreal (transitory) appearance of Brahman. And if the phenomenal world is a transitory appearance, then there is no real origination or destruction, only apparent origination or destruction. From the level of ultimate truth (''paramārthatā'') the phenomenal world is ''[[Maya (illusion)|māyā]]'',{{sfn|Comans|2000|p=36}}{{sfn|Hiriyanna|2000|p=25, 160-161}} changing and not what it seems to be.&lt;ref&gt;M Hiriyanna (2000), The Essentials of Indian Philosophy, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120813304}}, pages 25, 160-161&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wendy Doniger O'Flaherty (1986), Dreams, Illusion, and Other Realities, University of Chicago Press, {{ISBN|978-0226618555}}, page 119&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ajativada of Gaudapada, states Karmarkar, has nothing in common with the Sunyavada concept in Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;RD Karmarkar, [https://archive.org/stream/Gaudapada-Karika.English/Gaudapada-Karika#page/n45/mode/2up/search/ajativada Gaudapada's Karika], Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, pages xxxix-xl&lt;/ref&gt; While the language of Gaudapada is undeniably similar to those found in Mahayana Buddhism, Coman states that their perspective is different because unlike Buddhism, Gaudapada is relying on the premise of "Brahman, [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] or Turiya" exist and are the nature of absolute reality.{{sfn|Comans|2000|p=36}}{{Clarify|date=May 2017}}

'''Brook Farm''', also called the '''Brook Farm Institute of Agriculture and Education'''&lt;ref name=Felton124&gt;Felton, 124&lt;/ref&gt; or the Brook Farm Association for Industry and Education,&lt;ref name=Rose140&gt;Rose, 140&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[utopia]]n experiment in [[Commune (intentional community)|communal living]] in the United States in the 1840s. It was founded by former [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] minister [[George Ripley (transcendentalist)|George Ripley]] and his wife [[Sophia Ripley]] at the Ellis Farm in [[West Roxbury, Massachusetts|West Roxbury]], [[Massachusetts]]  (9 miles outside of downtown [[Boston]]) in 1841 and was inspired in part by the ideals of [[Transcendentalism]], a religious and cultural philosophy based in [[New England]]. Founded as a [[joint stock company]], it promised its participants a portion of the profits from the farm in exchange for performing an equal share of the work. Brook Farmers believed that by sharing the workload, ample time would be available for leisure activities and intellectual pursuits.

Life on Brook Farm was based on balancing labor and leisure while working together for the benefit of the greater community. Each member could choose to do whatever work they found most appealing and all were paid equally, including women. Revenue for the community came from farming and from selling handmade products like clothing as well as through fees paid by the many visitors to Brook Farm. The main source of income was the school, which was overseen by Mrs. Ripley. A pre-school, primary school, and a college preparatory school attracted children internationally and each child was charged for his or her education. Adult education was also offered.

The community was never financially stable and had difficulty profiting from its agricultural pursuits. By 1844, the Brook Farmers adopted a societal model based on the [[socialism|socialist]] concepts of [[Charles Fourier]] and began publishing ''The Harbinger'' as an unofficial journal promoting Fourierism. Following his vision, the community members began building an ambitious structure called the [[Phalanstère|Phalanstery]]. When the uninsured building was destroyed in a fire, the community was financially devastated and never recovered. It was fully closed by 1847. Despite the experimental commune's failure, many Brook Farmers looked back on their experience positively. Critics of the commune included [[Charles Lane (transcendentalist)|Charles Lane]], founder of another utopian community called [[Fruitlands (transcendental center)|Fruitlands]]. [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]] was a founding member of Brook Farm, though he was not a strong adherent of the community's ideals. He later fictionalized his experience in his novel ''[[The Blithedale Romance]]'' (1852).

After the community's failure, the property was operated for most of the next 130 years by a Lutheran organization as first an orphanage, and then a treatment center and school.  The buildings of the Transcendentalists were destroyed by fire over the years.  In 1988 the [[State of Massachusetts]] acquired {{convert|148|acre|ha}} of the farm, which is now operated by the [[Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation]] as a historic site. Brook Farm was one of the first sites in Massachusetts to be listed on the National Register of Historic Places and be designated a National Historic Site. In 1977, the [[Boston Landmarks Commission]] designated [https://www.cityofboston.gov/images_documents/Brook%20Farm%20%2314%20Study%20Report_tcm3-42379.pdf Brook Farm] a Landmark, the city's highest recognition for historic sites.

== History ==

===Planning and background===
[[File:George Ripley.jpg|thumb|right|George Ripley founded Brook Farm based on Transcendental ideals.]]
In October 1840, [[George Ripley (transcendentalist)|George Ripley]] announced to the [[Transcendental Club]] that he was planning to form a Utopian community.&lt;ref name=Packer133&gt;Packer, 133&lt;/ref&gt; Brook Farm, as it would be called, was based on the ideals of Transcendentalism; its founders believed that by pooling labor they could sustain the community and still have time for literary and scientific pursuits.&lt;ref name=Hankins34/&gt; The experiment was meant to serve as an example for the rest of the world, based on the principles of "industry without drudgery, and true equality without its vulgarity".&lt;ref name=McFarland83&gt;McFarland, 83&lt;/ref&gt; At Brook Farm, as in other communities, physical labor was perceived as a condition of mental well-being and health. Brook Farm was one of at least 80 communal experiments active in the United States throughout the 1840s, though it was the first to be [[secular]].&lt;ref&gt;Delano, 52&lt;/ref&gt; Ripley believed his experiment would be a model for the rest of society. He predicted: "If wisely executed, it will be a light over this country and this age. If not the sunrise, it will be the morning star."&lt;ref name=Felton124/&gt; As more interested people began to take part in planning, Ripley relocated meetings from his home to the West Street bookshop operated by [[Elizabeth Peabody|Elizabeth Palmer Peabody]].&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, 398&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beginnings===
Ripley and his wife [[Sophia Ripley|Sophia]] formed a joint stock company in 1841 along with 10 other initial investors.&lt;ref name=Hankins34&gt;Hankins, 34&lt;/ref&gt; He sold shares of the company $500 apiece with a promise of five percent of the profits to each investor.&lt;ref name=Packer133/&gt; Shareholders were also allowed a single vote in decision-making and several held director positions.&lt;ref name=Felton124/&gt; The Ripleys chose to begin their experiment at a dairy farm owned by Charles and Maria Mayo Ellis in [[West Roxbury, Massachusetts]], near the home of [[Theodore Parker]].&lt;ref name=Delano39&gt;Delano, 39&lt;/ref&gt; They began raising money, including holding a meeting at Peabody's bookshop to raise $10,000 for the farm's initial purchase.&lt;ref name=Marshall415&gt;Marshall, 415&lt;/ref&gt; The site was eventually purchased on October 11, 1841, for $10,500.&lt;ref name=Delano71&gt;Delano, 71&lt;/ref&gt; though participants had begun moving in as early as April.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, 407&lt;/ref&gt; The {{convert|170|acre|km2|adj=on}} farm about eight miles (13&amp;nbsp;km) from Boston was described in a pamphlet as a "place of great natural beauty, combining a convenient nearness to the city with a degree of retirement and freedom from unfavorable influences unusual even in the country".&lt;ref name=Delano39/&gt; The purchase also covered a neighboring Keith farm, approximately {{convert|22|acre|m2}}, "consisting altogether of a farm with dwelling house, barn, and outbuildings thereon situated".&lt;ref name=Delano71/&gt;

The first major public notice of the community was published in August 1841. "The Community at West Roxbury, Mass." was likely written by Elizabeth Palmer Peabody.&lt;ref&gt;Delano, 63&lt;/ref&gt; Though they began with 10 investors, eventually some 32 people would become Brook Farmers.&lt;ref name=Hankins34/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rose, 132&lt;/ref&gt; Writer and editor [[Margaret Fuller]] was invited to Brook Farm&lt;ref&gt;Gura, 156&lt;/ref&gt; and, though she never officially joined the community, she was a frequent visitor, often spending New Year's Eve there.&lt;ref name=Blanchard187&gt;Blanchard, Paula. ''Margaret Fuller: From Transcendentalism to Revolution''. Reading, Massachusetts: Addison-Wesley Publishing Company, 1987: 187. {{ISBN|0-201-10458-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ripley received many applications to join the community, especially from people who had little money or those in poor health, but full-fledged membership was granted only to individuals who could afford the $500 share of the joint stock company.&lt;ref name=Packer155&gt;Packer, 155&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the initial founders of Brook Farm was author [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]]. Hawthorne did not particularly agree with the ideals of the experiment, hoping only that it would help him raise enough money to begin his life with his wife-to-be [[Sophia Hawthorne|Sophia Peabody]].&lt;ref name=McFarland83/&gt; She considered moving there as well and even visited in May 1841, though Hawthorne sent her away.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, 408–409&lt;/ref&gt; Ripley was aware of Hawthorne's motivations, and tried to convince him to get involved more fully by appointing him as one of four trustees, specifically overseeing "Direction of Finance".&lt;ref name=Delano71/&gt; After requesting his initial investment be returned, Hawthorne officially resigned from Brook Farm on October 17, 1842.&lt;ref name="Delano, 97"&gt;Delano, 97&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote of his displeasure with the community: "even my Custom House experience was not such a thraldom and weariness; my mind and heart were freer ...Thank God, my soul is not utterly buried under a dung-heap."&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, 417&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fourier inspiration===
[[File:Hw-fourier.jpg|thumb|right|Brook Farm was reorganized to follow the work of Charles Fourier.]]
In the late 1830s Ripley became increasingly engaged in "[[Fourierism|Associationism]]", an early [[socialism|socialist]] movement based on the work of [[Charles Fourier]]. [[Horace Greeley]], a New York newspaper editor, and others began to pressure the Brook Farm experiment to follow more closely the pattern of Charles Fourier&lt;ref name=Hankins35&gt;Hankins, 35&lt;/ref&gt; at a time when the community was struggling to be self-sufficient.&lt;ref name=Packer155/&gt; [[Albert Brisbane]], whose book ''The Social Destiny of Man'' (1840) had been an inspiration to Ripley,&lt;ref&gt;Felton, 123&lt;/ref&gt; paid Greeley $500 for permission to publish a front-page column in the ''[[New York Tribune]]'' which ran in several parts from March 1842 to September 1843. Brisbane argued in the series, titled "Association: or, Principles of a True Organization of Society", how Fourier's theories could be applied in the United States.&lt;ref name=Packer155/&gt; Brisbane published similar articles in 1842 in ''[[The Dial]]'', the journal of the Transcendentalists.&lt;ref&gt;Delano, 91&lt;/ref&gt; Fourier's societal vision included elaborate plans for specific structures and highly organized roles of its members.&lt;ref name=Hankins35/&gt; He called this system for an ideal community a "Phalanx".&lt;ref&gt;Delano, 90&lt;/ref&gt;

To meet this vision, now under the name "Brook Farm Association for Industry and Education",&lt;ref name=Rose140/&gt; Brook Farmers committed themselves to constructing an ambitious communal building known as the [[Phalanstère|Phalanstery]]. Construction began in the summer of 1844 and the structure would provide accommodations for 14 families and single people as well.&lt;ref name=Packer161/&gt; It was planned to be {{convert|175|ft|m}} by {{convert|40|ft|m}} and include, as Ripley described, "a large and commodious kitchen, a dining-hall capable of seating from three to four hundred persons, two public saloons, and a spacious hall or lecture room".&lt;ref&gt;Delano, 255&lt;/ref&gt;

Ripley and two associates created a new constitution for Brook Farm in 1844, beginning the experiment's attempts to follow closely Fourier's Phalanx system.&lt;ref&gt;Packer, 157&lt;/ref&gt; Many Brook Farmers supported the transition; at a dinner in honor of Fourier's birthday, one member of the group proposed a toast to "Fourier, the second coming of Christ".&lt;ref name=Packer158&gt;Packer, 158&lt;/ref&gt; Others, however, did not share in the enthusiasm and some left the commune altogether.&lt;ref name=Packer158/&gt; One of those who left was [[Isaac Hecker]], who converted to [[Catholicism]] and went on to become the founder of the first American-based order of priests, the [[Paulist Fathers]], in 1858.&lt;ref&gt;Howe, Daniel Walker. ''What Hath God Wrought: The Transformation of America, 1815–1848''. New York: Oxford University Press, 2007: 300–301. {{ISBN|978-0-19-507894-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, many Brook Farmers thought the new model was too rigid and structured and too different from the carefree aspects that they had been attracted to.&lt;ref name=Felton127&gt;Felton, 127&lt;/ref&gt; Both supporters and detractors referred to the early part of Brook Farm's history as the "Transcendental days".&lt;ref name=Packer158/&gt; Ripley himself became a celebrity proponent of Fourierism and organized conventions throughout New England to discuss the community.&lt;ref&gt;Crowe, 170&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:TheHarbinger.JPG|thumb|right|November 7, 1846, issue of ''The Harbinger'', printed at Brook Farm]]
In the last few months of 1844, Brook Farmers were offered the possibility of taking over two Associationism-inspired publications, Brisbane's ''[[The Phalanx]]'' and John Allen's ''The Social Reformer''. Four printers were part of Brook Farm at the time and members of the community believed it would elevate their status as leaders of the movement as well as provide additional income.&lt;ref&gt;Delano, 190–191&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, the Brook Farmers published a new journal combining the two, ''The Harbinger''.&lt;ref name=Packer161/&gt; The journal's first issue was published June 14, 1845, and was continuously printed, originally weekly, until October 1847, when it was relocated to New York City, still under the oversight of George Ripley and fellow Brook Farmer [[Charles Anderson Dana]].&lt;ref&gt;Delano, 217&lt;/ref&gt; Naming the publication, however, turned out to be a difficult task. [[Parke Godwin (journalist)|Parke Godwin]] offered advice when it was suggested to keep the name ''The Phalanx'':

{{quote|text=Call it the Pilot, the Harbinger, the Halycon, the Harmonist, The Worker, the Architect, The Zodiac, The Pleiad, the Iris, the Examiner, The Aurora, the Crown, the Imperial, the Independent, the Synthesist, the Light, the Truth, the Hope, the Teacher, the Reconciler, the Wedge, the Pirate, the Seer, the Indicator, the Tailor, the Babe in the Manger, the Universe, the Apocalypse, the Red Dragon, the Plant, Beelzebub—the Devil or anything rather than the meaningless name Phalanx.&lt;ref&gt;Delano, 222&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Decline and dissolution===
Brook Farm began to decline rapidly after its restructuring. In October 1844, [[Orestes Brownson]] visited the site and sensed that "the atmosphere of the place is horrible".&lt;ref name=Delano192&gt;Delano, 192&lt;/ref&gt; To save money, "retrenchments", or sacrifices, were called for, particularly at the dinner table.&lt;ref&gt;Packer, 160&lt;/ref&gt; Meat, coffee, tea, and butter were no longer offered, though it was agreed that a separate table with meat be allowed in December 1844.&lt;ref name=Delano192/&gt; That Thanksgiving, a neighbor had donated a turkey.&lt;ref name=Packer161&gt;Packer, 161&lt;/ref&gt; Many Brook Farmers applied for exceptions to these rules and soon it was agreed that "members of the Association who sit at the meat table shall be charged extra for their board".&lt;ref&gt;Delano, 193&lt;/ref&gt; Life on Brook Farm was further worsened by an outbreak of [[smallpox]] in November 1845; though no one died, 26 Brook Farmers were infected.&lt;ref name=Packer161/&gt; Ripley attempted to quell the financial difficulties by negotiating with creditors and stockholders, who agreed to cancel $7,000 of debts.&lt;ref name=Crowe187&gt;Crowe, 187&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction on the Phalanstery was progressing well&lt;ref name=Packer161/&gt; until the evening of March 3, 1846, when it was discovered that the Phalanstery had caught fire. Within two hours, the structure had completely burned down;&lt;ref&gt;Delano, 254&lt;/ref&gt; firefighters from Boston arrived too late.&lt;ref name=Packer162&gt;Packer, 162&lt;/ref&gt; The fire was likely caused by a defective chimney. One participant noted, "Ere long the flames were chasing one another in a mad riot over the structure; running across long corridors and up and down the supporting columns of wood, until the huge edifice was a mass of firework".&lt;ref name=Felton128&gt;Felton, 128&lt;/ref&gt; The financial blow from the loss of the uninsured building was $7,000 and it marked the beginning of the end of Brook Farm.&lt;ref name=Packer162/&gt;

George Ripley, who had begun the experiment, made an unofficial break with Brook Farm in May 1846.&lt;ref&gt;Delano, 269&lt;/ref&gt; Many others began to leave as well, though the dissolution of the farm was slow. As one Brook Farmer said, the slow decline of the community was like apple petals drifting slowly to the ground, making it seem "dreamy and unreal".&lt;ref name=Packer162/&gt; On November 5, 1846, Ripley's book collection, which had served as Brook Farm's library, was auctioned to help cover the association's debts.&lt;ref name=Delano283&gt;Delano, 283&lt;/ref&gt; By the end, Brook Farm had a total debt of $17,445.&lt;ref name=Rose136&gt;Rose, 136&lt;/ref&gt; Ripley told a friend, "I can now understand how a man would feel if he could attend his own funeral".&lt;ref name=Delano283/&gt; He took a job with the ''New York Tribune'' and it took him 13 years to pay off the Brook Farm debt, which he did in 1862.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, 209&lt;/ref&gt;

==After Brook Farm==
[[File:BrookFarm-PrintShop.jpg|thumb|The Print Shop, constructed in about 1890, is the last remaining historic building at Brook Farm, though it is not associated with the Transcendentalist Utopian community. It was built by the Lutheran Church, which operated the Martin Luther Orphan's Home on the property from 1871 to 1944.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mass.gov/dcr/news/pdf/pr08-05-28.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
A man named John Plummer purchased the land that was Brook Farm in 1849 before selling it six years later to [[James Freeman Clarke]], who intended to establish another community there. Instead, Clarke offered it to President [[Abraham Lincoln]] during the [[American Civil War]] and the Second Massachusetts Regiment used it for training as [[Camp Andrew]].&lt;ref name=Felton129&gt;Felton, 129&lt;/ref&gt;

Clarke sold the property in 1868 to two brothers, who used it as a summer boarding house.  In 1870 Gottlieb F. Burckhardt purchased the property, after which he formed the Association of the Evangelical Lutheran Church for Works of Mercy to operate an orphanage in The Hive, as the main house on the property was known.  The orphanage opened in 1872 and operated until 1943.  In 1948 the Lutherans converted it into a treatment center and school, which closed in 1977.&lt;ref name=DCRBrochure&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mass.gov/dcr/parks/metroboston/brookfarmbrochure.pdf|title=Brooks Farm Brochure|publisher=Massachusetts DCR|accessdate=2013-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Parts of the farm were separated in 1873 for use as a cemetery, a use that continues today as a non-denominational cemetery known as the Gardens of Gethsemene  (as part of St. Joseph's Cemetery and the [[Baker Street Jewish Cemeteries]]).  During the period of Lutheran ownership the only now extant building, a c. 1890 print shop, was built on the land; the buildings associated with the Transcendentalists, most recently the Margaret Fuller Cottage, had burned down by the 1980s.&lt;ref name=Felton129/&gt;&lt;ref name=DCRBrochure/&gt;

In 1988 the Metropolitan District Commission (since merged with the [[Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation]], or DCR) purchased {{convert|148|acre|km2}} of the original land.&lt;ref&gt;Delano, 326&lt;/ref&gt;  The farm was declared a U.S. [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1965, a [[Boston Landmark]] in 1977, and is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref name="nrhpinv2"&gt;Polly M. Rettig and S. Sydney Bradford (April 3, 1976) {{NHLS url|id=66000141|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory-Nomination: Brook Farm}}, National Park Service and {{NHLS url|id=66000141|title=''Accompanying five photos, from 1975''|photos=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nhlsum"/&gt;  The DCR now operate the state-owned portion as a historic site; the West Roxbury Historical Society periodically offers tours.&lt;ref name=DCRBrochure/&gt;

== Landscape and facilities ==
Brook Farm was named for the brook that ran near the roadside and that eventually went to the [[Charles River]].&lt;ref&gt;Myerson, 299–300&lt;/ref&gt; It was surrounded by low hills and its meadows and sunny slopes were diversified by orchard, quiet groves and denser pine woods. The land, however, turned out to be difficult to farm.&lt;ref name=Packer134&gt;Packer, 134&lt;/ref&gt;

The land on the Keith lot that was purchased along with the Ellis farm included a functional farmhouse, which Brook Farmers immediately began calling "The Hive".&lt;ref name=Delano71/&gt; The Hive became the center for social activities and was where the people of the community went to eat three meals a day. The Hive's dining room held fifty people and its library was stocked with George Ripley's personal book collection which was made available for all community members.&lt;ref&gt;Felton, 124–125&lt;/ref&gt;

As the community grew, it became necessary to add more buildings for lodgings and various activities. The first building constructed was "The Nest", where school lessons took place and where guests of the farm would stay. Mr. and Mrs. Ripley's house, later to be called the Eyrie, was built during the second year. The next building to be built was the Margaret Fuller Cottage; though named after Fuller, she never spent a night there.&lt;ref name=Felton125&gt;Felton, 125&lt;/ref&gt; A participant at Brook Farm named Ichabod Morton built the Pilgrim House, named in honor of his home town of [[Plymouth, Massachusetts]]. The {{frac|2|1|2}}-story building was the third structure built that year and cost nearly $5,000 to build.&lt;ref&gt;Delano, 96&lt;/ref&gt; Morton stayed there only two weeks before moving out, after which the building was used for general lodging and also held the laundry facilities.&lt;ref name=Felton125/&gt; The many constructions, including [[greenhouse]]s and small craft shops, quickly reduced their treasury.&lt;ref name=Packer134/&gt;

== Community life ==

=== Work and finances ===
Participants at Brook Farm were also shareholders and were promised five percent of the annual profits or free tuition for one student. In exchange for 300 days of work per year, they were granted free room and board.&lt;ref name=Felton124/&gt; Members performed whatever work most appealed to them and all, including women, were paid equal wages.&lt;ref&gt;Delano, 65–66&lt;/ref&gt; The philosophy of labor, according to Ripley, was "to insure a more natural union between intellectual and manual labor than now exists; to combine the thinker and the worker, as far as possible, in the same individual."&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, 407–408&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization of work in Brook Farm changed over time because of both financial troubles and changes in ideologies. Members of Brook Farm initially participated in an "attractive industry" system where each individual could pick his or her work assignments based on their won preferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McKanan|first1=Dan|title=Self-Unfolding as Communitarian Vision: Brook Farm's Challenge to Contemporary Communities.|journal=Communal Societies|date=September 2006|volume=26|issue=2|pages=4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This method did not have any specific authority making sure that essential tasks were getting done. After initial leniency, some sensed that not all members were doing their fair share of the labor, so in 1841 the community adopted required standards for work: ten hours of work were required per day during the summer, and eight hours during winter.&lt;ref name=Felton127/&gt; When Brook Farm first started adopting Fourierist notions, they created a more structured work environment with a system that consisted of three series of [[industry]], which were  [[agriculture]], mechanical, and [[Housekeeper (domestic worker)|domestic]], and within each series there were a number of groups that handled more specific tasks.&lt;ref name="The Ideology of Brook Farm"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Francis|first1=Richard|title=The Ideology of Brook Farm|journal=Studies in the American Renaissance|date=1977|pages=14–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Each group had a chief whose duty it was to keep a record of the work done. While this system did create a new work hierarchy, the members still had the flexibility to move between groups easily.&lt;ref name="The Ideology of Brook Farm"/&gt; These new measures caused Brook Farm to achieve a profit in 1844 which was a feat that had not been accomplished in its first few years of the community's existence.&lt;ref name="The Ideology of Brook Farm"/&gt;

Typical work duties at Brook Farm included chopping wood, bringing in firewood, milking cows, turning a [[millstone|grindstone]], and other farming chores.&lt;ref name=Felton128/&gt; Not all were farmers, however. Some worked in the trades, including making shoes, and others were teachers. Regardless of the job, all were considered equal and because of the job distribution, as Elizabeth Peabody wrote, "no one has any great weight in any one thing".&lt;ref&gt;Rose, 135&lt;/ref&gt; In exchange for their work, participants were granted several "guarantees", including "medical attendance, nursing, education in all departments, amusements".&lt;ref name=Delano67&gt;Delano, 67&lt;/ref&gt; There were some occasional conflicts between different workers, partly because those who were educators believed themselves more [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrat]]ic; overall, however, as historian Charles Crowe wrote, "indeed all aspects of communal life operated with surprisingly little friction" in general.&lt;ref name="Crowe178"/&gt;

Visitors to Brook Farm came frequently, totaling an estimated 1,150 each year, though each was charged for their visit. Between November 1844 and October 1845, surviving records show that $425 was collected from visitor fees.&lt;ref&gt;Delano, 53&lt;/ref&gt; The list of visitors included theologian [[Henry James, Sr.]], sculptor [[William Wetmore Story]], artist [[John Sartain]], and British social reformer [[Robert Owen]].&lt;ref&gt;Delano, 54&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite multiple sources of income, the community was in constant debt almost immediately after it began.&lt;ref name=Rose136/&gt; The community, including Ripley, had difficulty with the farming aspects of the community, in particular because of poor soil and not enough labor. The major crop was hay, though it was sold at low grade prices; vegetables, milk, and fruit were not produced in high enough numbers to be profitable.&lt;ref&gt;Crow, 161&lt;/ref&gt; The property was mortgaged four times between 1841 and 1845.&lt;ref name=Rose136/&gt; Brook Farm got into the habit of spending money before they had raised it. As one Brook Farmer wrote, "I think here lies the difficulty,—we have not had business men to conduct our affairs ... those among us who have some business talents, see this error".&lt;ref name=Packer161/&gt;

===Education===
On September 29, 1841, the "Brook Farm Institute of Agriculture and Education" was organized. The school was the most immediate (and at times the only) source of income for Brook Farm and attracted students as far away as [[Cuba]] and the [[Philippines]].&lt;ref name=Packer155/&gt; Children under twelve were charged three-and-a-half dollars per week and, at first, boys over twelve were charged four dollars a week and girls were charged five; by August 1842, the rates were made identical, regardless of gender.&lt;ref name=Delano67/&gt; Adult education was also available in the evenings. The schedule for adults included courses on [[ethics|moral philosophy]], German language, and modern European history.&lt;ref name=Felton126&gt;Felton, 126&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the school there was an infant school for children under six, a primary school for children under ten, and there was a preparatory school that prepared children for college in six years.&lt;ref name=Felton126/&gt; When entering the school, each pupil under high school age was assigned a woman of the community who was in charge of his/her wardrobe, personal habits, and exercise.&lt;ref name=Myerson82&gt;Myerson, 82&lt;/ref&gt; The teachers included three graduates of [[Harvard Divinity School]] (George Ripley, George Bradford, [[John Sullivan Dwight]]) as well as several women (Ripley's wife Sophia, his sister Marianne, and his cousin Hannah, as well as Georgianna Bruce and [[Abby Morton Diaz|Abby Morton]]).&lt;ref&gt;Delano, 79&lt;/ref&gt; Ripley was in charge of teaching English and was known to be relaxed in his class. Dana taught languages, being able to speak ten himself. Dwight taught music&lt;ref&gt;Myerson, 305&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Latin]].&lt;ref name=Marshall415/&gt; Students studied European languages and literature and, at no extra cost, pupils could also indulge in the fine arts.&lt;ref name=Myerson82/&gt; The primary school was overseen by Sophia Ripley and Marianne Ripley, using a progressive child-centered [[pedagogy]] that has been compared to the later reforms of [[John Dewey]].&lt;ref name=Felton126/&gt; Sophia Ripley's dedication to the school was remarked upon by many; she only missed two classes in six years.&lt;ref name=Rose186&gt;Rose, 186&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Leisure ===
The people of Brook Farm spent most of their time either studying or working the farm, but they always set aside time in the day for play. In their free time, the members of Brook Farm enjoyed music, dancing, card games, drama, costume parties, sledding, and skating.&lt;ref name=Hankins34/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rose131&gt;Rose, 131&lt;/ref&gt; Every week everyone in the community would gather at The Hive for a dance of the young ladies of the community. They would wear wreaths of wild daisies on top of their heads, and each week a special wreath, bought from a florist, would be given to the best dressed girl.&lt;ref&gt;Myerson, 302–303&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of every day, many performed a "symbol of Universal Unity", in which they stood in a circle and joined hands and vowed for "truth to the cause of God and Humanity".&lt;ref&gt;Felton, 125–126&lt;/ref&gt;

Spirits remained high throughout the experiment, regardless of the community's financial standing.&lt;ref name=Packer133/&gt; Their social structure demanded selflessness&lt;ref name=Rose186/&gt; and individuals rarely failed to fulfill their duties,&lt;ref name=Crowe178&gt;Crowe, 178&lt;/ref&gt; a requirement to earn leisure time. Leisure time was important to the Brook Farm philosophy. As Elizabeth Palmer Peabody wrote for ''The Dial'' in January 1842, "none will be engaged merely in bodily labor ... This community aims to be rich, not in the metallic representative of wealth, but in ... leisure to live in all the faculties of the soul".&lt;ref name=Marshall416&gt;Marshall, 416&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Role of women ===
At Brook Farm, women had the opportunity to expand beyond their typical sphere of tasks and their labor was highly valued.&lt;ref name=Packer159&gt;Packer, 159&lt;/ref&gt; They did have tasks that were typical of other women at the time such as simple food preparation, and shared housekeeping. However, during the harvest time women were allowed to work in the fields and men even helped out with laundry during the cold weather. Because no single religion could impose its beliefs on the community, women were safe from the typical [[patriarchy]] associated with religion at the time.&lt;ref name=Packer159/&gt; Because of the community's focus on individual freedom, women were autonomous from their husbands and were also allowed to become stockholders.&lt;ref name=Rose186/&gt; Women also played an important role in providing sources of income to the community. Many devoted time to making, as Brook Farmer Marianne Dwight described, "elegant and tasteful caps, capes, collars, undersleeves, etc., etc.," for sale at shops in Boston.&lt;ref name=Packer159/&gt; Others painted screens and lamp shades for sale.&lt;ref name=Crowe178/&gt; Women were allowed to go to school and, because of the well-known education of women at Brook Farm, many female writers and performers visited the farm. George Ripley's wife Sophia, who had written an outspoken feminist essay for ''The Dial'' on "Woman" before moving to Brook Farm,&lt;ref&gt;Rose, 185&lt;/ref&gt; was very educated and was able to teach history and foreign languages at the farm.

==Criticism==
Many people in the community wrote of how much they enjoyed their experience and, in particular, the light-hearted atmosphere.&lt;ref name=Rose131/&gt; One participant, a man named John Codman, joined the community at the age of 27 in 1843. He wrote, "It was for the meanest a life above humdrum, and for the greatest something far, infinitely far beyond. They looked into the gates of life and saw beyond charming visions, and hopes springing up for all".&lt;ref&gt;Packer, 135&lt;/ref&gt; The idealism of the community sometimes was not met, however. Because the community was officially secular, a variety of religions were represented, though not always amicably. When Isaac Hecker and, later, Sophia Ripley converted to Catholicism, a Protestant Brook Farmer complained, "We are beginning to see wooden crosses around and pictures of saints ... and I suspect that [[rosary|rosaries]] are rattling under aprons."&lt;ref&gt;Rose, Ann C. ''Beloved Strangers: Interfaith Families in Nineteenth-century America'' Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2001: 94–95. {{ISBN|0-674-00640-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nathaniel Hawthorne, eventually elected treasurer of the community, did not enjoy his experience. Initially, he praised the work he was doing, boasting of "what a great, broad-shouldered, elephantine personage I shall become by and by!"&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, 409&lt;/ref&gt; Later, he wrote to his wife-to-be Sophia Peabody, "labor is the curse of the world, and nobody can meddle with it without becoming proportionately brutified".&lt;ref&gt;McFarland, 84&lt;/ref&gt; After disassociating with the community Hawthorne demanded the return of his initial investment, though he never held any ill will with Ripley, to whom he wrote he would "heartily rejoice at your success—of which I can see no reasonable doubt".&lt;ref name="Delano, 97"/&gt;

Many outside the community were critical of Brook Farm, especially in the press. The New York ''Observer'', for example, suggested that, "The Associationists, under the pretense of a desire to promote order and morals, design to overthrow the marriage institution, and in the place of the divine law, to substitute the 'passions' as the proper regulator of the intercourse of the sexes", concluding that they were "secretly and industriously aiming to destroy the foundation of society".&lt;ref&gt;Delano, 275–276&lt;/ref&gt; Critic [[Edgar Allan Poe]] expressed his opinions on the community in an article titled "Brook Farm" in the December 13, 1845, issue of the ''[[Broadway Journal]]''. He wrote that he had "sincere respect" for the group and that its journal, ''The Harbinger'', was "conducted by an assemblage of well-read persons who mean no harm—and who, perhaps, can do no less".&lt;ref&gt;Sova, Dawn B. ''Edgar Allan Poe: A to Z''. New York: Checkmark Books, 2001: 35. {{ISBN|0-8160-4161-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite many critics, none suggested George Ripley be replaced as Brook Farm's leader.&lt;ref name=Crowe187/&gt;

[[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] never joined the Brook Farm community, despite several invitations. He wrote to Ripley on December 15, 1840, of his "conviction that the Community is not good for me".&lt;ref name=Packer134/&gt; He also questioned the idealism of the community, particularly its optimism that all members would equally share responsibility and workload. As he wrote, "The country members naturally were surprised to observe that one man ploughed all day and one looked out of a window all day ... and both received at night the same wages".&lt;ref name=Felton127/&gt; Twenty years later, Emerson [[The Conduct of Life#Brook Farm|publicly denounced]] the experiment in his collection of essays titled ''[[The Conduct of Life]]''. [[Charles Lane (transcendentalist)|Charles Lane]], one of the founders of another community called [[Fruitlands (transcendental center)|Fruitlands]], thought the Brook Farmers lived a lifestyle that did not sacrifice enough. As he said, they were "playing away their youth and day-time in a miserably joyous frivolous manner".&lt;ref&gt;Delano, 119&lt;/ref&gt; Like other communities, Brook Farm was criticized for its potential to break up the [[nuclear family]] because of its focus on working as a larger community.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, 189&lt;/ref&gt; After its conversion to Fourierism, the Transcendentalists showed less support for the experiment.&lt;ref&gt;Crowe, 179&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henry David Thoreau]] questioned the community members' idealism and wrote in his journal, "As for these communities, I think I had rather keep bachelor's hall in hell than go to board in heaven".&lt;ref name=Hankins35/&gt; Even Sophia Ripley later questioned their original optimism, referring to it as "childish, empty, &amp; sad".&lt;ref&gt;Rose, 196&lt;/ref&gt;

== In fiction ==
[[File:Eastman Johnson - Hawthorne.png|thumb|left|A founding member, Hawthorne later fictionalized his experience at Brook Farm in ''[[The Blithedale Romance]]''.]]
Nathaniel Hawthorne, though a founding member, was unhappy during his tenure as a Brook Farmer, partly because he was unable to write while living there. "I have no quiet at all", he complained, and his hands were covered "with a new crop of blisters—the effect of raking hay".&lt;ref name=Marshall416/&gt; He later presented a fictionalized portrait of his experience in his 1852 novel, ''[[The Blithedale Romance]]''.&lt;ref&gt;McFarland, 149&lt;/ref&gt; He acknowledged the resemblance in his introduction, saying "in the 'Blithedale' of this volume, many readers will probably suspect a faint and not very faithful shadowing of Brook Farm, in West Roxbury, which (now a little more than ten years ago) was occupied and cultivated by a company of socialists." The chapter called "The Masqueraders", for example, was based on a picnic held one September to celebrate the harvest season.&lt;ref&gt;Delano, 102&lt;/ref&gt; George Ripley, who reviewed the book for the ''New York Tribune'', said that former Brook Farmers would only notice the resemblance in the humorous parts of the story.&lt;ref name=Packer162/&gt; Some have also seen a resemblance between Margaret Fuller and Hawthorne's fictional character Zenobia.&lt;ref name=Blanchard187/&gt; In the novel, a visitor—a writer like Hawthorne—finds that hard farm labor is not conducive to intellectual creativity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4737">'''Charles Batteux''' (6 May 1713{{snd}}14 July 1780) was a [[France|French]] [[philosopher]] and writer on [[aesthetics]].
[[File:Les beaux-arts reduits 1.png|thumb|175px|Title page of ''Les Beaux-Arts réduits à un même principe'']]

==Life==
Batteux was born in [[Alland'Huy-et-Sausseuil]], [[Ardennes]], and studied [[theology]] at [[Reims]]. In 1739 he came to [[Paris]], and after teaching in the colleges of [[Lisieux]] and [[Navarre]], was appointed to the chair of [[Greek philosophy|Greek]] and [[Roman philosophy]] in the [[Collège de France]]. 
His 1746 treatise ''Les beaux arts réduits à un même principe'' (translated into English as ''The Fine Arts Reduced to a Single Principle'', trans. James O. Young, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2015) was an attempt to find a unity among existing theories of [[beauty]] and [[taste (aesthetics)|taste]] on "a single principle", and its views were widely accepted,&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Batteux, Charles|volume=3|page=533}} This cites [[André Dacier|Dacier]] et Dupuy, ''Éloges'', in ''Mémoires de l'Académie des Inscriptions''.&lt;/ref&gt; not only in France but throughout Europe.
 
According to [[Paul Oskar Kristeller|P. O. Kristeller]], {{quote|the decisive step towards the system of the fine arts [thereby to the modern idea, "fine art"] was taken by the Abbé Batteux in his famous and influential treatise ... [making him] the first to set forth a clearcut system of the fine arts in a treatise devoted entirely to this subject.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Oskar Kristeller]], "The Modern System of the Arts" (1951–1952), repr. in Kristeller, ''Renaissance Thought and the Arts'' (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1965), pp. 163-227.&lt;/ref&gt; }}

The reputation thus gained, confirmed by his translation of [[Horace]] (1750), led to Batteux's becoming a member of the [[Académie des Inscriptions]] (1754) and of the [[Académie française]] (1761). His ''Cours de belles lettres'' (1765) was afterwards included with some minor writings in the large treatise, ''Principes de la littérature'' (1774). His philosophical writings were ''La morale d'Épicure tirée de ses propres écrits'' (1758), and the ''Histoire des causes premières'' (1769). In consequence of the freedom with which in this work he attacked the abuse of authority in philosophy, he lost his professorial chair. 
His last and most extensive work was a ''Cours d'études à l'usage des élèves de l'école militaire'' in forty-five volumes.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

In ''Les Beaux Arts'', Batteux developed a theory influenced by [[John Locke]] through [[Voltaire]]'s sceptical [[sensualism]]. He held that the [[fine arts]] are arts ("assemblages of rules for doing well"), for producing fine or beautiful things ("which please" of themselves), always "in imitation of ''la belle nature''" and requiring genius.  
Applying this principle to the art of [[poetry]], and analysing, line by line and even word by word, the works of great poets, he deduced the law that the beauty of poetry consists in the accuracy, beauty and harmony of individual expression. 
His ''Histoire des causes premières'' was among the first attempts at a history of philosophy, and in his work on [[Epicurus]], following on [[Pierre Gassendi|Gassendi]], he defended [[Epicureanism]] against the general attacks made against it.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Strictly in Aesthetics terms Batteux sets the single principle for fine arts in imitation of nature, and this in terms of ideal of perfection to make an harmonious whole: "let's choose the most beautiful parts of nature, to make an exquisite whole, more perfect then nature, but never ending to be natural".&lt;ref&gt;Book I, part I: "à faire un choix des plus belles parties de la nature pour en former en tout exquis, qui fùt plus parfait que la nature elle-méme, sans cependant cesser d'étre naturel". See: TOSCANO A. (1991). Charles Batteux: Les Quatre Poëtiques. RIVISTA DI ESTETICA, vol. 39; p. 67-78, {{ISSN|0035-6212}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this concept, clearly, Batteux follows a long tradition, present at least in [[Leon Battista Alberti#Contributions|Leon Battista Alberti]]; as well as for the expression of fine arts, present in [[Giovanni Battista Armenini]] and more back in [[Sebastiano Serlio#Content|Sebastiano Serlio]].

'''David Hawkins''' (February 28, 1913 – February 24, 2002) was a professor whose interests included the philosophy of science, mathematics, economics, childhood science education, and ethics. He also served as an administrative assistant at [[Manhattan Project]]'s [[Los Alamos Laboratory]], and later as one of its official historians. Together with [[Herbert A. Simon]], he discovered and proved the [[Hawkins–Simon theorem]].

==Early life==
David Hawkins was born in [[El Paso, Texas]], the youngest of seven children of William Ashton Hawkins, and his wife Clara {{nee}} Gardiner.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=New York Times |first=Christopher |last=Lehmann-Haupt |title=Obituary of David Hawkins |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/04/us/david-hawkins-88-historian-for-manhattan-project-in-1940-s.html |date=March 4, 2002 |access-date=January 27, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His father was a prominent lawyer noted for his work on water law,&lt;ref name="lat"&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2002/mar/03/local/me-hawkins3 |access-date=January 27, 2017 |first=Elaine |last=Woo |title=D. Hawkins, 88; Atomic Bomb Historian }}&lt;/ref&gt; who worked for the [[El Paso and Northeastern Railway]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://focus.nps.gov/GetAsset?assetID=a1274d75-8e4f-4579-9405-f11b2a62b4db |title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory Nomination Form – La Luz Townsite |publisher=National Park Service  |access-date=January 27, 2017  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was one of the founders of the city of [[Alamogordo, New Mexico]].&lt;ref name=nyt /&gt; He grew up in [[La Luz, New Mexico]].&lt;ref name="lat" /&gt;

Hawkins attended [[Hotchkiss School]] in [[Lakeville, Connecticut]], but left after his [[Junior (education)|junior]] year to enter [[Stanford University]].&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; He initially studied chemistry, but then switched to physics before finally majoring in [[philosophy]].&lt;ref name=rmoa&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Rocky Mountain Online Archive |title=David Hawkins Papers |url=http://rmoa.unm.edu/docviewer.php?docId=cou2hawkins.xml |access-date=January 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded his [[B.A.]] in 1934 and [[M.A.]] in 1936.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; While he was there, he met Frances Pockman,&lt;ref name=cu&gt;{{cite web |publisher=University of Colorado |title=Obituary of David Hawkins.  |url=https://www.cu.edu/sg/messages/373.html |date=March 7, 2002 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301080429/https://www.cu.edu/sg/messages/373.html |archive-date=March 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; a teacher and writer.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; They were married in San Francisco in 1937. They had a daughter, Julie.&lt;ref name=rmoa /&gt;

In 1936 Hawkins went to the [[University of California, Berkeley]], to work on his doctorate.&lt;ref name="voices"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://manhattanprojectvoices.org/oral-histories/david-hawkinss-interview-part-1 |date=1982 |title=Audio Interview with David Hawkins |first=Martin |last=Sherwin |publisher=Voices of the Manhattan Project |access-date=January 27, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He became friends with [[Robert Oppenheimer]], with whom he liked to discuss [[Hindu philosophy]], and issues in the [[philosophy of science]], such as the [[uncertainty principle]], and [[Niels Bohr]]'s [[Complementarity (physics)|complementarity]]. In 1938, Hawkins and his wife Frances joined the Berkeley campus branch of the [[Communist Party of America]].&lt;ref name=rmoa /&gt; He earned his [[Ph.D.]] in 1940, writing his thesis on "A Causal Interpretation of Probability".&lt;ref name=rmoa /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oskicat.berkeley.edu/record=b12232030~S1 |title=A Causal Interpretation of Probability |publisher=University of California, Berkeley |access-date=January 27, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manhattan Project==
After graduating, Hawkins worked at Berkeley until May 1943, when Oppenheimer recruited him to work at the [[Manhattan Project]]'s [[Los Alamos Laboratory]], also known as Project Y, as his administrative assistant.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; "I was intrigued by the thought of being part of this extraordinary development", he later explained, "And it was still of course in those days entirely focused on the terrible thought that the Germans might get this weapon and win World War II."&lt;ref name="wp"&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=Washington Post |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/2002/03/02/philosopher-david-hawkins-dies/d991f439-8878-4638-95eb-633d4ab6cde1/ |title=Philosopher David Hawkins Dies |first=Martin |last=Weil |date=March 2, 2002 |access-date=January 27, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hawkins saw his role as that of a go-between, mediating between the civilian scientists and the military leadership at Los Alamos;&lt;ref name="lat"/&gt; but he also found a kindred spirit in the Polish mathematician [[Stan Ulam]], who was working in [[Edward Teller]]'s "[[History of the Teller–Ulam design|Super]]" Group. They investigated the problem of branching a [[neutron]] multiplication in a [[nuclear chain reaction]]. [[Stan Frankel]] and [[Richard Feynman]] had tackled the problem using classical physics, but Ulam and Hawkins approached it using [[probability theory]], creating a new sub-field now known as [[branching process]] theory.{{sfn|Ulam|1983|p=153}} They investigated branching chains using a [[characteristic function (probability theory)|characteristic function]]. After the war, Ulam would extend and generalise this work.{{sfn|Ulam|1983|pp=158–161}} He described Hawkins as "the most talented amateur mathematician I know."{{sfn|Ulam|1983|p=159}}  

Hawkins is credited with the selection of the Alamogordo area for the [[Trinity nuclear test]],&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; but he declined to watch it.&lt;ref name="wp"/&gt; His final assignment at Los Alamos was as its historian, writing the history of Project Y. He completed this work in August 1946, covering the history of Project Y up to August 1945, but it remained classified until 1961. He was a founding member of the [[Federation of American Scientists]].&lt;ref name="rmoa"/&gt;

==Later life==
With [[World War II]] over, he left Los Alamos to become an associate professor of philosophy at George Washington University, but left in 1947 to join the faculty at the [[University of Colorado Boulder]].&lt;ref name=rmoa /&gt; Together with [[Herbert A. Simon]], he discovered and proved the [[Hawkins–Simon theorem]] on the "conditions for the existence of positive solution vectors for [[Input-output model|input-output matrices]]."&lt;ref name="wp"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Some Conditions of Macroeconomic Stability |first=David |last=Hawkins |first2=Herbert A. |last2=Simon |journal=[[Econometrica]] |volume=17 |issue=3/4 |year=1949 |pages=245–248 |jstor=1905526 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[macroeconomic]] theorem helped economists better understand the interconnectedness of various sectors of an economy.&lt;ref name="wp"/&gt;

On December 20, 1950, Hawkins was called before the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]].&lt;ref name="rmoa"/&gt; He testified that he had been a member of the Communist Party from 1938 to 1942.&lt;ref name="wp"/&gt; The testimony of Hawkins and his wife Frances was released publicly in January 1951, resulting in an outcry led by ''[[The Denver Post]]''. There were calls for his dismissal, but he had [[tenure]], and under the university's law, this could only be revoked for incompetence or moral turpitude.&lt;ref name="voices"/&gt; The regents took a vote, and were split evenly; the numbers went in his favor when one of them died.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; He remained at the University of Colorado until he retired in 1982,&lt;ref name="rmoa"/&gt; except for periods as a visiting professor at Berkeley, the [[University of North Carolina]], [[Cornell University]], [[Simon Fraser University]], the [[University of Michigan]] and the [[Sapienza University of Rome|University of Rome]]. He was also a fellow at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] and the [[American Council of Learned Societies]].&lt;ref name="cu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rmoa"/&gt;

From 1962 on, Hawkins increasingly took an interest in early childhood education, and in improving elementary school science education. With his wife Frances, they established the Elementary Science Advisory Center to improve the standard of science teaching, which he directed from 1965 to 1970. In 1970 they founded the campus-based Mountain View Center for Environmental Education with funding from the university and the [[Ford Foundation]],&lt;ref name="rmoa"/&gt; which provided advanced education for elementary school teachers.&lt;ref name="cu"/&gt; He was a consultant to the [[National Institute of Education]] and the [[National Science Foundation]].&lt;ref name="rmoa"/&gt; In 1981, he received a $300,000 "[[MacArthur Fellowship|genius grant]]" from the [[MacArthur Foundation]].&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;  

Hawkins died at his home in [[Boulder, Colorado]], on February 24, 2002.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; He was survived by his wife Frances and daughter Julie.
His papers are in the University of Colorado, Boulder, library.&lt;ref name="rmoa"/&gt; In 2013, the University of Colorado hosted an interactive exhibit in Boulder about his life and work, ''Cultivate the Scientist in Every Child: The Philosophy of Frances and David Hawkins''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ucdenver.edu/academics/colleges/SchoolOfEducation/Documents/WebsitestoryCultivatetheScientistinEveryChildExhibitFINAL.pdf |title=Cultivate the Scientist in Every Child Exhibit Explores Compelling Childhood Learning Approaches |publisher=University of Colorado, Denver |access-date=8 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the following five years the exhibit travelled to Wyoming, New Mexico, Nebraska, Illinois, Wisconsin, Tennessee, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and California, before landing in its permanent home at Boulder Journey School in Boulder, CO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hawkinscenters.org/blog/category/cultivate-the-scientist#sthash.Vw9iJY9z.dpuf |title=Throwback Thursday: Cultivate the Scientist in Every Child |publisher=Hawkins Centers |access-date=8 February 2017  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wheelock.edu/hawkins-exhibit |title=Wheelock Hosts Hawkins Exhibit and Conference |publisher=Wheelock College  |access-date=8 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hawkinscenters.org/exhibit-location.html |title=Exhibit Location |publisher=Hawkins Centers of Learning  |access-date=8 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bodies in cyberspace==
{{BLP sources section|date= August 2015}}
Ihde's ''Bodies in Technology''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url=http://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/bodies-in-technology | title=Bodies in Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt; spells out the original exploration of the ways cyberspace affects the human experience. The book is useful to the research scholars who are exploring the role of bodies in the VR technologies. The book is the study of embodiment in cyberspace, an ideal book also related to [[human–computer interaction]] (HCI); Ihde explores the meaning of bodies in technology.

Don Ihde entirely rejects Cartesian dualism and Ihde further "does not believe we human beings can exist in disembodied form." Even to have an out of body experience is to have an implicit 'here-body' from which we experience an 'object-body' over there. Ihde believes in having 'I am my body.' But its outlines are ambiguous and 'my experience' can reach through other spatialitities. Don Ihde has further explored these arguments in his book ''Bodies in Technology'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url=http://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/bodies-in-technology | title=Bodies in Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning with a "phenomenology of multistability" in the way various "technological media" are perceived, Don Ihde examines the "roles of human embodiment, perception, and spatial transformations within communication and information media."

Ihde (2006)&lt;ref&gt;Ihde D (2006) Technofantasies and embodiment. In: Diocaretz M, Herbrechter S (eds) The matrix in theory, (Rodopi, 2006), pp 153–166 &lt;/ref&gt; argues that movies like the Matrix trilogy play upon fantasy in a technological context and relate to the human sense of embodiment. Ihde points out to an important fact that we have to experience the embodiment where we live, rather than to "plugin" to a technofantasies world.

==Technoscience Research Seminar==
Ihde is the Director of the Technoscience Research Group in the Philosophy Department. The study of [[technoscience]] examines cutting-edge work in the fields of the philosophies of science and technology, and science studies; it also emphasizes the roles of our material cultures and expertise.

Ihde directs the graduate and post-graduate Technoscience research seminar, which reads only living authors such as [[Donna Haraway]], [[Bruno Latour]], [[Ian Hacking]], [[Andrew Pickering]], [[Sandra Harding]]. Ihde has on occasion invited other authors to the seminar for a "roast". Past roastees have included [[Peter Galison]], [[Hubert Dreyfus]], [[Albert Borgmann]], [[Andrew Feenberg]], and [[Harry Collins]].

The seminar on technoscience has resulted in a number of publications related to its activities, and participants regularly present research results at major international conferences (Aarhus, Denmark; Vienna, Austria; CERN, Switzerland, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ralon|first1=Laureano|title=Interview with Don Ihde|url=http://figureground.org/interview-with-don-ihde|website=Figure/Ground|accessdate=24 August 2015|date=2010-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a paper "Was Heidegger prescient concerning Technoscience?", Ihde re-examines [[Martin Heidegger]]'s philosophy of science with a reappraisal of what was innovative, and what remained archaic. Heidegger then is read against the background of the "new" approaches to science in science studies, and against the background of the scientific revolutions which have occurred since the mid-20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Ihde, D (2001) Was Heidegger Prescient Concerning Technoscience? Existentia 11 (3-4):373-386&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expanding hermeneutics==
On the issues of ''Hermeneutics from the Phenomenological Perspective'' Ihde examines what might he called a "material hermeneutics,"  which characterizes much practice within the domains of technoscience. Ihde rejects the vestigial [[Wilhelm Dilthey|Diltheyan]] division between the humanistic and natural sciences and argues that certain types of critical interpretation, broadly hermeneutic, characterize both sets of disciplines. Ihde examines what he calls a style of interpretation based in material practices relating to imaging technologies which have given rise to the visual hermeneutics in technoscience studies. Veszprém, 1993, it was at that meeting that Ihde first proposed the notion of ''Expanding hermeneutics''.

==Material hermeneutics==
''Abstract of Ihde's Sheffield paper on Material Hermeneutics, 2006'':&lt;ref&gt;[http://traumwerk.stanford.edu:3455/symmetry/816 "Material Hermeneutics"]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070120110535/http://traumwerk.stanford.edu:3455/symmetry/816 |date=January 20, 2007 }}, presented at [http://traumwerk.stanford.edu:3455/symmetry/816 "A Symmetrical Archaeology, TAG 2005"]   symposium.&lt;/ref&gt;

:A material hermeneutics is a hermeneutics which "gives things voices where there had been silence, and brings to sight that which was invisible." Such a hermeneutics in natural science can best be illustrated by its imaging practices. The objects of this visual hermeneutics were not texts nor linguistic phenomena, but things which came into vision through instrumental magnifications, allowing perception to go where it had not gone before. One could also say that a visual hermeneutics is a perceptual hermeneutics with a perception which while including texts, goes beyond texts. This local history gives but a small glimpse of the directions Ihde tried to outline in ''Expanding Hermeneutics''. Such material hermeneutics are doubly material—first, in the sense that the objects being investigated are material entities—paramecia, extra-geocentric satellites, and eventually even the chemical make-up of the stars—but also it is material in the sense that the instruments being used to 'bring close' such phenomena are also material entities, technologies, by which and through which the natural sciences are embodied.

:In ''Expanding Hermeneutics'' I outlined both a weak program of hermeneutics in natural science, that is, a program of actual and extant practices which can best be understood as hermeneutic practices, and a strong program which was more prescriptive, suggesting ways to radicalize a material hermeneutics. In part the trajectory of expanding hermeneutics comes from much that I have learned from the new versions of interdisciplinary "science studies," which include the strands of the new sociologies of science, feminist critiques of science, and the varieties of philosophy of science which emphasize praxis, instruments, and laboratories over sheer theory production, all under which he now title "technoscience studies." I developed a sensitivity to the ways in which our instruments, technologies operate in hermeneutic ways.

==Philosophers in the 'R&amp;D' position==
Don Ihde has argued on numerous occasions that "if the philosopher is to play a more important role it must not be only in or limited to the 'Hemingway role'. Rather, it should take place in the equivalent of the officers' strategy meeting, before the battle takes shape. I will call this the 'R&amp;D role'" (Ihde, 1999, p.&amp;nbsp;46).&lt;ref&gt;Ihde, D (1999) Technology and Prognostic Predicaments, AI &amp; Soc (1999) 13:44-51, Springer-Verlag London&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophers should engage themselves on "interdisciplinary research teams and play precisely ‘R&amp;D’ roles" (p.&amp;nbsp;49).&lt;ref&gt;Ihde, D (1999) Technology and Prognostic Predicaments, AI &amp; Soc (1999) 13:44-51, Springer-Verlag London&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years Don Ihde has been pleading that philosophers should be in the 'R&amp;D' position. The philosophers of technology "should reposition themselves" in the "R&amp;D" position where "technologies are taking developmental shape, in think tanks, in incubator facilities, in research centers. Only then can truly "new" and emerging technologies be philosophically engaged" (Ihde, 2012, p.&amp;nbsp;332).
&lt;ref&gt;Ihde, D (2012) Can continental philosophy deal with the new technologies? (pp. 321 – 332), Journal of Speculative Philosophy, Vol. 26, No. 2, The Pennsylvania State University Press&lt;/ref&gt;
"Philosophers, postphenomenologists, in R&amp;D positions could conceivable bring to bear thinking on future, rather than past or actually in-place phenomena" argues Don Ihde (2003, p.&amp;nbsp;7).&lt;ref&gt;Ihde, D (2003) Postphenomenology - Again?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15211">The '''ethics of terraforming''' has constituted a philosophical debate within [[biology]], [[ecology]], and [[environmental ethics]] as to whether [[terraforming]] other worlds is an [[ethics|ethical]] endeavor.

==Support==
On the pro-terraforming side of the argument, there are those like [[Robert Zubrin]] and [[Richard L. S. Taylor]] who believe that it is humanity's moral obligation to make other worlds suitable for Terran life, as a continuation of the history of life transforming the environments around it on Earth. They also point out that Earth will eventually be destroyed as nature takes its course, so that humanity faces a very long-term choice between terraforming other worlds or allowing all Earth life to become extinct. Dr. Zubrin further argues that even if native microbes have arisen on Mars, for example, the fact that they have not progressed beyond the microbe stage by this point, halfway through the lifetime of the Sun, is a strong indicator that they never will; and that if microbial life exists on Mars, it is likely related to Earth life through a common origin on one of the two planets, which spread to the other as an example of [[panspermia]]. Since Mars life would then not be fundamentally unrelated to Earth life, it would not be unique, and competition with such life would not be fundamentally different from competing against microbes on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why life on Mars may help change the paradigm|url=http://www.bernardokastrup.com/2012/12/life-mars-paradigm.html|publisher=By [[Bernardo Kastrup]] (December 2, 2012) |accessdate=May 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Zubrin summed up this view:

{{Cquote
|''Some people consider the idea of terraforming Mars heretical—humanity playing God. Yet others would see in such an accomplishment the most profound vindication of the divine nature of the human spirit, exercised in its highest form to bring a dead world to life. My own sympathies are with the latter group. Indeed, I would go farther. I would say that failure to terraform Mars constitutes failure to live up to our human nature and a betrayal of our responsibility as members of the community of life itself. Today, the living biosphere has the potential to expand its reach to encompass a whole new world. Humans, with their intelligence and technology, are the unique means that the biosphere has evolved to allow it to make that land grab, the first among many. Countless beings have lived and died to transform the Earth into a place that could create and allow human existence. Now it's our turn to do our part''. (1996) &lt;ref name="zoob1"&gt;Robert Zubrin, ''[[The Case for Mars|The Case for Mars: The Plan to Settle the Red Planet and Why We Must]]'', pp. 248-249, Simon &amp; Schuster/Touchstone, 1996, {{ISBN|0-684-83550-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Richard Taylor more succinctly exemplified this point of view with the slogan, "move over microbe".&lt;ref name="Terraforming: Engineering Planetary Environments"&gt;{{cite book| last=Fogg| first=Martyn J.| year=1995| title=Terraforming: Engineering Planetary Environments| publisher=SAE International, Warrendale, PA.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some critics label this argument as an example of [[anthropocentrism]]. These critics may view the homocentric view as not only [[geocentric]] but short-sighted, and tending to favour human interests to the detriment of [[ecosystem|ecological systems]]. They argue that an anthropocentrically driven approach could lead to the extinction of indigenous [[extraterrestrial life]], or the [[Interplanetary contamination]].

[[Martyn J. Fogg]] rebutted these ideas by delineating four potential rationales on which to evaluate the ethics of terraforming—[[anthropocentrism]], [[Biocentrism (ethics)|zoocentrism]], [[ecocentrism]], and [[preservationism]]—roughly forming a spectrum from placing the most value on human utility to placing the most value on preserving [[nature]]. While concluding that arguments for protecting alien biota can be made from any of these standpoints, he also concludes with an argument, similar to Zubrin's, that strict preservationism is "untenable", since "it assumes that human consciousness, creativity, culture and technology stand outside nature, rather than having been a product of natural selection. If ''Homo sapiens'' is the first space faring species to have evolved on Earth, space settlement would not involve acting 'outside nature', but legitimately 'within our nature'." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~mfogg/EthicsDTP.pdf | title=The Ethical Dimensions of Space Settlement| format=pdf| accessdate=2006-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

Strong [[ecocentrist]]s like [[Richard Sylvan]] feel there is an intrinsic value to life, and seek to preserve the existence of native lifeforms. This idea is usually referred to as [[biocentrism (ethics)|biocentrism]]. In response to these objections, weak anthropocentrism incorporates biocentric ethics, allowing for various degrees of terraforming.

[[Christopher McKay (planetary scientist)|Christopher McKay]] strikes a position between these two, what may be termed weak ecocentrism, proposing that an entire biosphere of alien life, even if only microbial life, has far more value than individual microbes, and should not be subject to interference by Earth life. However, he also proposed that it would be valuable and desirable to terraform a planet to nurture the alien life, to allow it to thrive as well as to exhibit a broader range of behavior for scientific study, and that such activity is ultimately justified by the utilitarian value to humans of being able to study and appreciate the still somewhat undisturbed alien life.

McKay put his views in these words:

{{Cquote
|''If we discover living or dormant organisms on Mars and these forms represent a different type of life than the life we have on Earth, then we should not bring life from Earth to Mars. Instead, we should alter the Martian environment so that this native Martian life can expand to fill a planetary scale biosphere''. [...] ''it is essential to maintain the categorical distinction between killing individual microorganisms and extinguishing an entire alternative system of life. There is no logical argument against killing microorganisms per se, either for research, medical, sanitary, or even casual reasons. However... it does not logically follow that destroying or displacing the first example of life beyond Earth is acceptable if the only examples of that life are microscopic''. [...] ''If we terraformed Mars to allow the expansion of that life we would then reap the maximum benefits from the scientific study of that life form and its development into a full scale global biosphere. We would also enjoy the educational and [aesthetic] benefits of life in a biologically richer solar system''.&lt;ref name="ontomars"&gt;Christopher McKay and Robert Zubrin, "Do Indigenous Martian Bacteria have Precedence over Human Exploration?", pp. 177-182, in ''[[On to Mars: Colonizing a New World]]'', Apogee Books Space Series, 2002, {{ISBN|1-896522-90-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; (2002)}}

Even this "help" would be seen as a type of terraforming to the strictest of ecocentrists, who would say that all life has the right, in its home biosphere, to evolve at its own pace as well as its own direction, free of any outside interference. The impact of the human species on otherwise untouched worlds and the possible interference with or elimination of alien life forms are good reasons to leave these other worlds in their natural states; this is an example of a strong biocentric view, or object-centered ethic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Terraforming|url=http://www.experiencefestival.com/a/Terraforming_-_Ethical_issues/id/2077768|publisher=By [[Global Oneness Commitment]]|accessdate=May 19, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101222154427/http://www.experiencefestival.com/a/Terraforming_-_Ethical_issues/id/2077768|archivedate=December 22, 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics claim this is a form of [[Antihumanism|anti-humanism]] and they assert that rocks and bacteria can not have rights, nor should the discovery of alien life prevent terraforming from occurring.

Pragmatists argue that humanity on other planets is [[sociology|sociologically]] impractical. The basis is that being on another planet wouldn't change [[human nature]], so it wouldn't be long until pollution and destruction by humankind began, and on a planet that has probably only known peace since its formation. Since [[life|life on Earth]] will ultimately be destroyed by planetary impacts or the [[red giant]] phase of the Sun, all native species will perish if not allowed to move to other objects.

Some advocates of animal welfare have pointed out the ethical issues associated with spreading Earth-based wild-animal life by terraforming. In particular, they claim it may be ethically objectionable to bring into existence large numbers of animals that suffer greatly during their often-short lives in the wild.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/suffering-nature.html
| author=Brian Tomasik | title=The Importance of Wild-Animal Suffering | accessdate=2009-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also concerns that even with full terraformation, distinct differences between Earth and Mars, such as gravity, lengths of the day and night cycles, and differing/lacking magnetic fields, would cause harm to many introduced species that have evolved for millions of years under Earth conditions. Though some species may survive, and others possibly could be adapted through genetic modification, if the introduced species were isolated on Mars and not frequently interbred with Earth counterparts, the species would eventually evolve through many generations in order to better suit their new environment, possibly leading to different evolutionary lines. Thus, the introduced life may eventually look and act very different from their Earthly counterparts and/or ancestors.

Another aspect of terraforming ethics deals with an opposing extreme in this debate. Terraforming could be seen as a potential waste of precious materials, in light of alternative uses.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Critics{{Who|date=May 2010}} believe that it would constrict the growth potential of humanity by encapsulating the material inside of an astronomical object. Once the surface is terraformed and people have taken residence there, all the interior material is needed to sustain the maximum gravity potential for those inhabitants. If all of the material were utilized to produce space habitation systems, a much greater number of lives would then be supported.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

==Future prospects==
The contrasts between these arguments are fully explored in the field of environmental ethics. Some researchers suggest that both paradigms need to mature into a more complex, [[cosmocentric ethic]] which incorporates the (unknown) value of extraterrestrial life with the values of humanity and all things in the universe. Debates often focus on how much time and effort should be expended on investigating the possibility of any microscopic life on a planet before deciding whether to terraform, and what level of sophistication or chances for future development alien life would deserve varying levels of commitment to non-interference. Such debates have been engaged in live, between Zubrin and McKay and others, at various conferences of the [[Mars Society]], which has made written and video records of the debates available. For example, a written account of some of these debates is available in ''[[On to Mars: Colonizing a New World]]'', as a joint article, "Do Indigenous Martian Bacteria have Precedence over Human Exploration?" (pp.&amp;nbsp;177–182)

==Ethics of terraforming in fiction==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Rgbmars.jpg|thumb|right|307px|Covers of the ''Mars'' series]] --&gt;
A fairly thorough non-fictional analysis of the ethics of terraforming is also presented under the guise of the fictional [[Mars trilogy]] by [[Kim Stanley Robinson]], particularly between the characters [[Mars trilogy#Ann Clayborne|Ann Clayborne]] and [[Mars trilogy#Saxifrage .22Sax.22 Russell|Sax Russell]], with Clayborne epitomizing an ecocentric ethic of non-interference and Russell embodying the anthropocentric belief in the virtue of terraforming.
The idea of interplanetary colonization and its ethical implications are also explored by C.S. Lewis in the first book of his Space Trilogy ''[[Out of the Silent Planet]]'' published in 1938.

The plot of the 1982 film ''[[Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan]]'' is based around the use of the so-called "Genesis Device" to create the conditions and organic building-blocks for life on previously lifeless planets. In debating the ethics of the device, [[Leonard McCoy|Dr. McCoy]], [[Spock]] and [[James T. Kirk|Admiral Kirk]] reflect on the Device's ability to replace any existing lifeforms with "its new matrix". McCoy describes the ethics of the Device in the following terms: "According to myth, the Earth was created in six days. Now watch out - here comes Genesis! We'll do it for you in six minutes!" The technology is shown to be flawed in the 1984 sequel, ''[[Star Trek III: The Search for Spock]]''

''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' dealt with terraforming. In the episode "[[Home Soil]]", terraformers are causing harm to the native lifeforms on Velara III, with disastrous consequences.

In the novel ''[[Revelation Space]]'' by [[Alastair Reynolds]], there was a political dispute in the human colony of a fictional planet called Resurgam between a faction who were in support of terraforming the planet and another faction of archeologists who were against terraforming due to the discovery of the remains of an extinct alien civilisation on the planet and due to the fear that any attempt to terraform the planet would destroy the valuable artifacts that still might be buried underground.

The ethics of terraforming, as well as deep [[space colonization]], are recurring themes in ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'', in which they are compared to the issues of [[expansionism]] and [[imperialism]] in the [[American Old West]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4328">The '''First Earth Battalion''' was the name proposed by Lieutenant Colonel [[Jim Channon]], a [[United States|U.S.]] [[soldier]] who had served in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]], for his [[idea]] of a new [[military]] of [[supersoldier]]s to be organized along [[New Age]] lines. A book of the same name was published in 1982.

==''The Men Who Stare at Goats''==
According to the book ''[[The Men Who Stare at Goats]]'' by [[journalist]] [[Jon Ronson]], Channon spent time in the 1970s with many of the people in [[California]] credited with starting the [[Human Potential Movement]], and subsequently wrote an operations manual for a First Earth Battalion. The manual was a 125-page mixture of drawings, graphs, maps, polemical essays, and point-by-point redesigns of every aspect of military life. Channon imagined a new battlefield uniform that would include pouches for [[ginseng]] regulators, [[Dowsing|divining tools]], food stuffs to enhance [[night vision]], and a loudspeaker that would automatically emit "[[indigenous music]] and words of peace."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, B. (2006). ''Immortal Combat: Portrait of a True Warrior.'' Berkeley, CA: Blue Snake Books.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ronson, J. (2004). ''The Men Who Stare at Goats.'' New York: Simon &amp; Schuster.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[The Men Who Stare at Goats (film)|movie based on the book]]—released in Autumn 2009—starring [[George Clooney]], [[Ewan McGregor]], [[Jeff Bridges]] and [[Kevin Spacey]], fictionalized the First Earth Battalion as the ''New Earth Army''.

==Beliefs==
Channon believed the [[Army]] could be the principal [[moral]] and [[ethical]] basis on which [[politics]] could harmonize in the name of the [[Earth]]. He declared that the First Earth Battalion's primary allegiance was to the planet earth.&lt;ref&gt;Grant De Pauw, L. (2000). ''Battle Cries and Lullabies: Women in War from Prehistory to the Present.'' Oklahoma City, OK: University of Oklahoma Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Channon envisioned that the First Earth Battalion would organize itself informally: uniforms without uniformity, structure without status, and unity powered by diversity, and members would be [[multicultural]], with each [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] contributing to "rainbow power".&lt;ref&gt;McRae, R.F. (1984). ''Mind Wars: The True Story of Government Research into the Military Potential of Psychic Weapons.'' New York: St. Martin's Press.&lt;/ref&gt; He also proposed as a guiding principle that members of the First Earth Battalion seek nondestructive methods of [[conflict resolution]] because their first [[loyalty]] is to the planet.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson, M. (1980). ''The Aquarian Conspiracy: Personal and Social Transformation in Our Time.'' Los Angeles, CA: J.P. Tarcher, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Warrior Monk===
Channon adopted the term "[[warrior monk]]" for potential members of the First Earth Battalion.&lt;ref&gt;Druckman, D., &amp; Swets, J.A. (eds.). (1988). ''Enhancing Human Performance: Issues, Theories, and Techniques.'' Washington, DC: National Academy Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Credo===
According to the book ''Mind Wars'' by Ronald McRae, each member of the First Earth Battalion would be sworn to uphold a credo of "high [[commandos]] and [[guerrilla]] [[gurus]]":
* I have the capacity and therefore the duty to contribute to the development of myself, my associates, and our planet, simultaneously, now!
* I will organize a self-supporting high commando group that will create and perform evolutionary breakthrough actions on behalf of people and planet. One people, one planet.
* I will then pass on this concept to others who are capable of generating further self-organizing commando teams.
* I will await the time when my group can connect naturally with others at higher and higher levels of awareness and performance — the Natural Guard.

'''Free and open-source software''' ('''FOSS''') is [[software]] that can be classified as both [[free software]] and [[open-source software]].{{efn|FOSS is an inclusive term that covers both [[free software]] and [[open-source software]], which despite describing similar development models, have differing cultures and philosophies.{{sfn|Feller|2005|pages=89, 362}} ''Free'' refers to the users' freedom to copy and re-use the software. The [[Free Software Foundation]], an organization that advocates the free software model, suggests that to understand the concept, one should "think of free as in free speech, not as in free beer". (See {{cite web | url = https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html | publisher = GNU.org | title = The Free Software Definition | accessdate =4 February 2010 }}) Free software focuses on the fundamental freedoms it gives to users, whereas open source software focuses on the perceived strengths of its peer-to-peer development model.{{sfn|Feller|2005|pages=101–106, 110–111}} FOSS is a term that can be used without particular bias towards either political approach.}} That is, anyone is [[free software license|freely licensed]] to use, copy, study, and change the software in any way, and the [[source code]] is openly shared so that people are encouraged to voluntarily improve the design of the software.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html|title=What is free software?  The Free Software Definition|last=|first=|date=2018-06-12|website=The GNU Project -- GNU.org|access-date=2018-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is in contrast to [[proprietary software]], where the software is under restrictive [[copyright]] [[licensing]] and the source code is usually hidden from the users.

FOSS maintains the software user's civil liberty rights (see the [[#Four essential freedoms of Free Software|Four Essential Freedoms]], below).  Other benefits of using FOSS can include decreased software costs, increased [[Security (computing)|security]] and stability (especially in regard to [[malware]]), protecting [[privacy]], education, and giving users more control over their own hardware. Free and open-source operating systems such as [[Linux]] and descendants of [[BSD]] are widely utilized today, powering millions of [[server (computing)|servers]], [[desktop computer|desktops]], smartphones (e.g. [[Android (operating system)|Android]]), and other devices.{{sfn|Hatlestad|2005}}{{sfn|Claburn|2007}} [[Free-software license|Free-software licenses]] and [[Open-source license|open-source licenses]] are used by [[List of open-source software packages|many software packages]].

==Overview==
{{Further|Alternative terms for free software}}

"Free and open-source software" (FOSS) is an umbrella term for software that is simultaneously considered both [[Free software]] and [[open-source software]].  FOSS (free and open-source software) allows the user to inspect the source code and provides a high level of control of the software's functions compared to [[proprietary software]]. The term "free software" does not refer to the monetary cost of the software at all, but rather whether the license maintains the software user's civil liberties ("free” as in “free speech,” not as in “free beer”).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; There are a number of related terms and abbreviations for free and open-source software (FOSS or F/OSS), or free/libre and open-source software (FLOSS or F/LOSS -- FLOSS is the FSF-preferred term).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/floss-and-foss.en.html|title=FLOSS and FOSS|last=Stallman|first=Richard|date=|website=The GNU Project -- GNU.org|language=en|access-date=2018-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although there is almost a complete overlap between [[Free software|free-software]] licenses and [[Open-source software|open-source-software]] licenses, there is a strong philosophical disagreement between the advocates of these two positions. The terminology of FOSS or "Free and Open-source software" was created to be a neutral on these philosophical disagreements between the FSF and OSI and have a single unified term that could refer to both concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/floss-and-foss.en.html|title=FLOSS and FOSS|last=Stallman|first=Richard|date=|website=www.gnu.org|language=en|access-date=2018-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Free Software Foundation (FSF) explains the philosophical difference between [[free software]] and [[open-source software]]: "The two terms describe almost the same category of software, but they stand for views based on fundamentally different values. Open-source is a development methodology; free software is a social movement.  For the free-software movement, free software is an ethical imperative, essential respect for the users' freedom.  By contrast, the philosophy of open-source considers issues in terms of how to make software “better”—in a practical sense only."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html|title=Why Open Source misses the point of Free Software|last=Stallman|first=Richard|date=18 November 2016|website=The GNU Project -- GNU.org|access-date=15 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In parallel to this the [[Open Source Initiative]] (OSI) considers many free-software licenses to also be open source.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://opensource.org/faq#free-software|title=Frequently Answered Questions {{!}} Open Source Initiative|website=opensource.org|language=en|access-date=2018-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include the latest versions of the FSF's three main licenses: the GPL, the [[Lesser General Public License]] (LGPL), and the [[GNU Affero General Public License]] (AGPL).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Licenses by Name|url=http://www.opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical|work=Open Source License|publisher=Open Source Initiative|accessdate=23 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Free software===

Richard Stallman's [[Free Software Definition]], adopted by the [[Free Software Foundation]] (FSF), defines [[free software]] as a matter of liberty not price,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html |title=GNU.org |work=GNU.org |date=20 September 2011 |accessdate=23 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it upholds the Four Essential Freedoms. The earliest-known publication of the definition of his free-software idea was in the February 1986 edition&lt;ref name="bull6"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.gnu.org/bulletins/bull1.txt | title=GNU's Bulletin, Volume 1 Number 1, page 8 | publisher=GNU.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the FSF's now-discontinued GNU's Bulletin publication. The canonical source for the document is in the philosophy section of the [[GNU Project]] website. As of August 2017, it is published there in 40 languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html#translations | title=The Free Software Definition – Translations of this page | publisher=GNU.org }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Four essential freedoms of Free Software====

To meet the definition of "free software", the FSF requires the software's licensing rights what the FSF respect the civil liberties / human rights of what the FSF calls the software user's "[[The Free Software Definition#The definition and the Four Freedoms|Four Essential Freedoms]]".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html|title=What is free software?  The Free Software Definition|last=Free Software Foundation|first=|date=27 December 2016|website=The GNU Project  -- GNU.org|access-date=15 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose (freedom 0).
* The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a precondition for this.
* The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others (freedom 2).
* The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (freedom 3).  By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Open source ===

The [[Open Source Definition|open-source-software definition]] is used by the [[Open Source Initiative]] (OSI) to determine whether a [[computer software|software]] license qualifies for the organization's insignia for [[Open-source software]]. The definition was based on the [[Debian Free Software Guidelines]], written and adapted primarily by [[Bruce Perens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/opensources/book/perens.html|title=''The Open Source Definition by Bruce Perens''}}, Open Sources: Voices from the Open Source Revolution, January 1999, {{ISBN|1-56592-582-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://opensource.org/docs/osd|title=''The Open Source Definition''}}, The Open Source Definition according to the Open Source Initiative&lt;/ref&gt; Perens did not base his writing on the Four Essential Freedoms of free software from the [[Free Software Foundation]], which were only later available on the web.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=1129863&amp;cid=26875815 |title=Slashdot.org |work=News.slashdot.org |date=16 February 2009 |accessdate=23 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perens subsequently stated that he felt Eric Raymond's promotion of Open-source unfairly overshadowed the Free Software Foundation's efforts and reaffirmed his support for Free software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/1999/02/msg01641.html|title=It's Time to Talk About Free Software Again|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140716055445/https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/1999/02/msg01641.html|archivedate=2014-07-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the following 2000s, he spoke about open source again.&lt;ref name="10yearsoss"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://perens.com/works/articles/State8Feb2008.html |title=Bruce Perens - State of Open Source Message: A New Decade For Open Source |publisher=Perens.com |date=1998-02-09 |accessdate=2009-07-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104135143/http://perens.com/works/articles/State8Feb2008.html |archivedate=4 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="meet the perens"&gt;{{cite web |title=Meet the Perens |url=http://akashsingh.ulitzer.com/node/32606 |first=Joe |last=Barr |publisher=''LinuxWorld Magazine'' |date=January 13, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s through the 1980s, it was common for computer users to have the source code for all programs they used, and the permission and ability to modify it for their own use. [[Software]], including source code, was commonly shared by individuals who used computers, often as [[public domain software]].&lt;ref name="infoworld1983"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yy8EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA31|work=[[InfoWorld]] |date=1983-06-23|title=Free software - Free software is a junkyard of software spare parts |first=Tom |last=Shea |accessdate=2016-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most companies had a business model based on [[computer hardware|hardware]] sales, and provided or [[bundled software]] with hardware, free of charge.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 1960s, the prevailing business model around software was changing. A growing and evolving software industry was competing with the hardware manufacturer's bundled software products; rather than funding software development from hardware revenue, these new companies were selling software directly. Leased machines required software support while providing no revenue for software, and some customers able to better meet their own needs did not want the costs of software bundled with hardware product costs. In ''United States vs. [[IBM]]'', filed 17 January 1969, the government charged that bundled software was anticompetitive.{{sfn|Fisher|McKie|Mancke|1983}} While some software was still being provided without monetary cost and license restriction, there was a growing amount of software that was only at a monetary cost with restricted licensing. In the 1970s and early 1980s, some parts of the [[software industry]] began using technical measures (such as distributing only [[Executable|binary copies]] of [[computer programs]]) to prevent [[computer users]] from being able to use [[reverse engineering]] techniques to study and customize software they had paid for. In 1980, the copyright law was extended to computer programs in the [[United States]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://history.nih.gov/research/downloads/PL96-517.pdf Computer Software 1980 Copyright Act, Pub. L. No. 96-517, 94 Stat. 3015, 3028].&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;mdash;previously, computer programs could be considered ideas, procedures, methods, systems, and processes, which are not copyrightable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lib.purdue.edu/uco/CopyrightBasics/basics.html|title=Copyright Basics}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Weber|2009}}

Early on, [[closed-source]] software was uncommon until the mid-1970s to the 1980s, when IBM implemented in 1983 an "object code only" policy, no longer distributing source code.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=hSBrPSYgjI4C&amp;pg=PP55 Object code only: is IBM playing fair?] ''IBM's OCO policy protects its own assets but may threaten customers investment'' on [[Computerworld]] - 8 Febr. 1988&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=4Wgmey4obagC&amp;pg=PA8 Firm sidestep IBM policy by banning software changes] on [[Computerworld]] (18 March 1985)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ibm-oco-policy"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4Wgmey4obagC&amp;pg=PA8|publisher=[[Computerworld]] |first=John |last=Gallant |date=1985-03-18| accessdate=2015-12-27 |title=IBM policy draws fire – Users say source code rules hamper change |quote=While IBM's policy of withholding source code for selected software products has already marked its second anniversary, users are only now beginning to cope with the impact of that decision. But whether or not the advent of object-code-only products has affected their day-to-day DP operations, some users remain angry about IBM's decision. Announced in February 1983, IBM's object-code-only policy has been applied to a growing list of Big Blue system software products}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, [[Richard Stallman]], longtime member of the [[hacker (programmer subculture)|hacker]] community at the [[MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory]], announced the [[GNU project]], saying that he had become frustrated with the effects of the change in culture of the computer industry and its users.{{sfn|William|2002}} Software development for the [[GNU operating system]] began in January 1984, and the [[Free Software Foundation]] (FSF) was founded in October 1985. An article outlining the project and its goals was published in March 1985 titled the ''[[GNU Manifesto]]''. The manifesto included significant explanation of the GNU philosophy, ''[[Free Software Definition]]'' and "[[copyleft]]" ideas. The FSF takes the position that the fundamental issue [[Free software]] addresses is an ethical one—to ensure software users can exercise what it calls "[[Free software#Definition and the Four Freedoms|The Four Essential Freedoms]]".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The [[Linux kernel]], created by [[Linus Torvalds]], was released as freely modifiable source code in 1991. Initially, Linux was not released under either a Free software or an Open-source software license. However, with version 0.12 in February 1992, he [[Software relicensing|relicensed]] the project under the [[GNU General Public License]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/Historic/old-versions/RELNOTES-0.12 | title=Release notes for Linux kernel 0.12 | publisher=Kernel.org }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[FreeBSD]] and [[NetBSD]] (both derived from [[386BSD]]) were released as Free software when the [[USL v. BSDi]] lawsuit was settled out of court in 1993. [[OpenBSD]] [[Fork (software development)|forked]] from NetBSD in 1995. Also in 1995, The [[Apache HTTP Server]], commonly referred to as Apache, was released under the [[Apache License|Apache License 1.0]].

In 1997, [[Eric S. Raymond|Eric Raymond]] published [[The Cathedral and the Bazaar]], a reflective analysis of the hacker community and Free software principles. The paper received significant attention in early 1998, and was one factor in motivating [[Netscape Communications Corporation]] to release their popular [[Netscape Communicator]] Internet suite as [[Free software]]. This code is today better known as [[Mozilla Firefox]] and [[Mozilla Thunderbird|Thunderbird]].

Netscape's act prompted Raymond and others to look into how to bring the FSF's Free software ideas and perceived benefits to the commercial software industry. They concluded that FSF's social activism was not appealing to companies like Netscape, and looked for a way to rebrand the Free software movement to emphasize the business potential of sharing and collaborating on software source code. The new name they chose was "Open-source", and quickly [[Bruce Perens]], publisher [[Tim O'Reilly]], [[Linus Torvalds]], and others signed on to the rebranding. The [[Open Source Initiative]] was founded in February 1998 to encourage the use of the new term and evangelize open-source principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://opensource.org/history |title=History of the OSI | publisher=Opensource.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Open Source Initiative sought to encourage the use of the new term and evangelize the principles it adhered to, commercial software vendors found themselves increasingly threatened by the concept of freely distributed software and universal access to an application's [[source code]]. A [[Microsoft]] executive publicly stated in 2001 that "Open-source is an intellectual property destroyer. I can't imagine something that could be worse than this for the software business and the intellectual-property business."{{sfn|Charny|2001}} This view perfectly summarizes the initial response to FOSS by some software corporations.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} For many years FOSS played a niche role outside of the mainstream of private software development.  However the success of FOSS Operating Systems such as GNU/Linux, BSD and the companies based on FOSS such as [[Red Hat]], has changed the software industry's attitude and there has been a dramatic shift in the corporate philosophy concerning the development of Free and Open-source software (FOSS).{{sfn|Miller|Voas|Costello|2010|pages=14–16}}

Manufacturers of proprietary, closed-source software are sometimes pressured to building in [[backdoor (computing)|backdoor]]s or other covert, undesired features into their software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Microsoft Back Doors|url=https://www.gnu.org/proprietary/malware-microsoft.en.html|website=www.gnu.org|accessdate=4 July 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Microsoft Accidentally Leaks Key to Windows Backdoor - Schneier on Security|url=https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2016/08/microsoft_accid.html|website=www.schneier.com|accessdate=4 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thomson|first1=Iain|title=Snowden leak: Microsoft added Outlook.com backdoor for Feds|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/07/11/snowden_leak_shows_microsoft_added_outlookencryption_backdoor_for_feds/|accessdate=4 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Strandburg|first1=Katherine J.|last2=Raicu|first2=Daniela Stan|title=Privacy and Technologies of Identity: A Cross-Disciplinary Conversation|date=2005|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9780387260501|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-ZgEVDt30zIC&amp;pg=PA323|accessdate=4 July 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/11/microsoft-nsa-collaboration-user-data prism--&gt; Instead of having to trust software vendors users of FOSS can inspect and verify the source code themselves and can put trust on a community of volunteers and users.&lt;ref name=pcw1/&gt; As proprietary code is typically hidden from public view, only the vendors themselves and hackers may be aware of any [[vulnerability (computing)|vulnerabilities]] in them&lt;ref name=pcw1/&gt; while FOSS involves as many people as possible for exposing bugs quickly.&lt;ref name=wash1/&gt;&lt;ref name=scmagazine&gt;{{cite web|title=Open source software is more secure than you think|url=https://www.scmagazine.com/open-source-software-is-more-secure-than-you-think/article/541874/|publisher=SC Media US|accessdate=12 July 2017|language=en|date=8 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Low costs or no costs====
FOSS is often free of charge although donations are often encouraged. This also allows users to better test and compare software.&lt;ref name=pcw1/&gt;

====Quality, collaboration and efficiency====
{{See also|#Bugs and missing features}}
FOSS allows for better collaboration among various parties and individuals with the goal of developing the most efficient software for its users or use-cases while proprietary software is typically [[Profit motive|meant to generate profits]]. Furthermore, in many cases more organizations and individuals contribute to such projects than to proprietary software.&lt;ref name=pcw1/&gt; It has been shown that technical superiority is typically the primary reason why companies choose open source software.&lt;ref name=pcw1/&gt;

===Drawbacks to proprietary software===
'''Infringes on user's civil liberties and human rights'''

By definition [[proprietary software]] does not respect the user's [[Free software#Definition and the Four Freedoms|Four Essential Freedoms]].  This means that even though the software purchaser has bought the software, the software does not fully belong to the purchaser because the software can not be used to do whatever the user wishes with it and that the source code is not made available by it's creator to be inspected, modified and redistributed. This state of affairs is counter to what people are used to such as when they purchase an item (ie. a car), they have the right to do with it as they please, to tinker with it, modify it or resell it.

====Security and user-support====
{{See also|Common good|Public participation|Proactive cyber defence#Measures}}
According to [[Linus's Law]] the more people who can see and test a set of code, the more likely any flaws will be caught and fixed quickly. However, this does not guarantee a high level of participation. Having a grouping of full-time professionals behind a commercial product can in some cases be superior to FOSS.&lt;ref name=pcw1&gt;{{cite web|title=10 Reasons Open Source Is Good for Business|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/209891/10_reasons_open_source_is_good_for_business.html|publisher=PCWorld|accessdate=4 July 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wash1&gt;{{cite journal|title=Is Open Source Software More Secure?|url=https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/csep590/05au/whitepaper_turnin/oss(10).pdf|accessdate=4 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=obs/&gt;

Furthermore, publicized source code might make it easier for hackers to find vulnerabilities in it and write exploits. This however assumes that such malicious hackers are more effective than [[White hat (computing)|white hat hackers]] which [[responsible disclosure|responsibly disclose]] or help fix the vulnerabilities, that no code leaks or [[data breach|exfiltrations]] occur and that [[reverse engineering]] of proprietary code is a hindrance of significance for malicious hackers.&lt;ref name=wash1/&gt;

====Hardware and software compatibility====
{{Further|Software incompatibility|System requirements}}
Often FOSS is not compatible with proprietary hardware or specific software. This is often due to manufacturers obstructing FOSS such as by not disclosing the [[Interface (computing)|interfaces]] or other specifications needed for members of the FOSS movement to write [[Device driver|drivers]] for their hardware − for instance as they wish customers to run only their own proprietary software or as they might benefit from partnerships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fogel|first1=Karl|title=Producing Open Source Software: How to Run a Successful Free Software Project|date=2005|publisher="O'Reilly Media, Inc."|isbn=9780596552992|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0vbr7xvvzjgC&amp;pg=PA245|accessdate=4 July 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sery|first1=Paul G.|title=Ubuntu Linux For Dummies|date=2007|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9780470125052|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IpkXTUqriTsC&amp;pg=PA111|accessdate=4 July 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Linux Today - KERNEL-DEV: UDI and Free Software by Richard Stallman|url=http://www.linuxtoday.com/developer/1998100500205OP|website=www.linuxtoday.com|accessdate=4 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vaughan-Nichols|first1=Steven J.|title=Microsoft tries to block Linux off Windows 8 PCs {{!}} ZDNet|url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-tries-to-block-linux-off-windows-8-pcs/|publisher=ZDNet|accessdate=12 July 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kingsley-Hughes|first1=Adrian|title=Lenovo reportedly blocking Linux on Windows 10 Signature Edition PCs (updated) {{!}} ZDNet|url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/lenovo-reportedly-blocking-linux-on-windows-10-signature-edition-pcs/|website=ZDNet|accessdate=12 July 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Linux Today - How Microsoft Changes the Prices at OEMs to Block GNU/Linux Sales|url=http://www.linuxtoday.com/infrastructure/2009041200535NWMDMS|website=www.linuxtoday.com|accessdate=12 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Microsoft ‘killed Dell Linux’ – States|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2002/03/19/microsoft_killed_dell_linux_states/|accessdate=12 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{additional citation needed|date=July 2017}}

====Bugs and missing features====
{{See also|#Quality, collaboration and efficiency}}
While FOSS can be superior to proprietary equivalents in terms of software features and stability, in many cases FOSS has more unfixed bugs and missing features when compared to similar commercial software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hill|first1=Benjamin Mako|title=When Free Software Isn't (Practically) Superior|url=https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/when-free-software-isnt-practically-superior.en.html|accessdate=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Additional citation needed|date=July 2017}} This varies per case and usually depends on the level of interest and participation in a FOSS project. Furthermore, unlike with typical commercial software missing features and bugfixes can be implemented by any party that has the relevant motivation, time and skill to do so.&lt;ref name=obs&gt;{{cite web|title=Too Big to Fail Open-Source Software Needs Hacker Help|url=http://observer.com/2016/11/open-source-too-big-to-fail/|publisher=Observer|accessdate=12 July 2017|date=4 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Additional citation needed|date=July 2017}}

====Less guarantees of development====
There is often less certainty in FOSS projects gaining the required resources / participation for continued development than commercial software backed by companies.&lt;ref name=arthur&gt;{{cite book|last1=Arthur|first1=Tatnall|title=Encyclopedia of Portal Technologies and Applications|date=2007|publisher=Idea Group Inc (IGI)|isbn=9781591409908|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D3dJO-O5PewC&amp;pg=PA685|accessdate=11 July 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Additional citation needed|date=July 2017}} However companies also often abolish projects for being unprofitable and often large companies rely on and hence co-develop open source software.&lt;ref name=scmagazine/&gt;

====Missing applications====
As the FOSS operating system distributions of [[GNU/Linux]] has a lower [[market share]] of end users there are also fewer applications available.&lt;ref name=Kenneth&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baldauf|first1=Kenneth|last2=Stair|first2=Ralph|title=Succeeding with Technology|date=2008|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=1423925297|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VAa-AouAHxoC&amp;pg=PA147|accessdate=12 July 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mastering Information Technology for CXC CSEC CAPE|publisher=Dennis Adonis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PdpDFv5Gu5YC&amp;pg=PT24|accessdate=12 July 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Technical skills and user-friendliness====
GNU/Linux may require more effort or technical knowledge to set up and maintain.&lt;ref name=Kenneth/&gt;

===GPLv3 controversy===
{{Context|section|date=February 2017}}
While copyright is the primary legal mechanism that FOSS authors use to ensure license compliance for their software, other mechanisms such as legislation, patents, and trademarks have implications as well. In response to legal issues with patents and the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] (DMCA), the Free Software Foundation released [[GPL version 3|version 3 of its GNU Public License]] in 2007 that explicitly addressed the DMCA and patent rights.

After the development of the [[GNU GPLv3]] in 2007, the FSF (as the copyright holder of many pieces of the GNU system) updated many{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} of the GNU programs' licenses from GPLv2 to GPLv3. On the other hand, the adoption of the new GPL version was heavily discussed in the FOSS ecosystem,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://socializedsoftware.com/2008/05/08/the-curse-of-open-source-license-proliferation/ |title=The Curse of Open Source License Proliferation |author=Mark |date=2008-05-08 |accessdate=2015-11-30 |publisher=socializedsoftware.com |quote=''Currently the decision to move from GPL v2 to GPL v3 is being hotly debated by many open source projects. According to Palamida, a provider of IP compliance software, there have been roughly 2489 open source projects that have moved from GPL v2 to later versions.'' |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208112000/http://socializedsoftware.com/2008/05/08/the-curse-of-open-source-license-proliferation/ |archive-date=2015-12-08 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; several projects decided against upgrading. For instance the [[linux kernel]],&lt;ref name="linuxlicense"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-stable.git/tree/COPYING |quote=''Also note that the only valid version of the GPL as far as the kernel is concerned is _this_ particular version of the license (ie v2, not v2.2 or v3.x or whatever), unless explicitly otherwise stated.'' |accessdate=13 August 2013 |publisher=kernel.org |first=Linus |last=Torvalds |title=COPYING}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="torvaldsgpl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internetnews.com/dev-news/article.php/3720371/Torvalds+Still+Keen+On+GPLv2.htm |title=Torvalds Still Keen On GPLv2 |quote=''"In some ways, Linux was the project that really made the split clear between what the FSF is pushing which is very different from what open source and Linux has always been about, which is more of a technical superiority instead of a -- this religious belief in freedom," Torvalds told Zemlin. So, the GPL Version 3 reflects the FSF's goals and the GPL Version 2 pretty closely matches what I think a license should do and so right now, Version 2 is where the kernel is."'' |date=2008-01-08 |first=Sean Michael|last=Kerner |publisher=internetnews.com |accessdate=2015-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[BusyBox]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lwn.net/Articles/202106/ |title=Busy busy busybox |date=2006-10-01 |author=corbet |publisher=lwn.net |quote=''Since BusyBox can be found in so many embedded systems, it finds itself at the core of the GPLv3 anti-DRM debate. [...]The real outcomes, however, are this: BusyBox will be GPLv2 only starting with the next release.

Following the release by the Free Software Foundation (FSF) of the new version 3 of its GNU General Public License (GPL) on the 29th of June 2007, contributors to the VLC media player, and other software projects hosted at videolan.org, debated the possibility of updating the licensing terms for future version of the VLC media player and other hosted projects, to version 3 of the GPL. [...] There is strong concern that these new additional requirements might not match the industrial and economic reality of our time, especially in the market of consumer electronics. It is our belief that changing our licensing terms to GPL version 3 would currently not be in the best interest of our community as a whole. Consequently, we plan to keep distributing future versions of VLC media player under the terms of the GPL version 2. |publisher=videolan.org |accessdate=2015-11-21 |first=Rémi |last=Denis-Courmont}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Apple, Inc.|Apple]], a user of [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] and a heavy user of both [[Digital rights management|DRM]] and patents, switched the compiler in its [[Xcode]] IDE from GCC to [[Clang]], which is another FOSS compiler{{sfn|Brockmeier|2010}} but is under a [[permissive license]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://llvm.org/docs/DeveloperPolicy.html#license | title=LLVM Developer Policy | publisher=LLVM | accessdate=November 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[LWN.net|LWN]] speculated that Apple was motivated partly by a desire to avoid GPLv3.{{sfn|Brockmeier|2010}} The [[Samba (software)|Samba]] project also switched to GPLv3, so Apple replaced [[Samba (software)|Samba]] in their software suite by a closed-source, proprietary software alternative.{{sfn|Holwerda|2011}}

===Skewed prioritization, ineffectiveness and egoism of developers===
{{See also|Issue tracking system}}
Leemhuis criticizes the [[prioritization]] of skilled developers who − instead of fixing issues in popular applications and desktop environments − create new, mostly redundant software to gain fame and fortune.&lt;ref name=Leemhuis&gt;{{cite web|last1=Leemhuis|first1=Thorsten|title=Kommentar: Linux scheitert an Egozentrik|url=https://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/Kommentar-Linux-scheitert-an-Egozentrik-3766433.html|publisher=heise online|accessdate=12 July 2017|language=de-DE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also criticizes notebook manufacturers for optimizing their own products only privately or creating [[workaround]]s instead of helping fix the actual causes of the many issues with GNU/Linux on notebooks such as the unnecessary power consumption.&lt;ref name=Leemhuis/&gt;

===Commercial ownership of open-source software===
Mergers have affected major open-source software. [[Sun Microsystems]] (Sun) acquired [[MySQL AB]], owner of the popular open-source [[MySQL]] database, in 2008.&lt;ref name="sun buys mysql"&gt;{{cite web |title=Sun to Acquire MySQL |publisher=MySQL AB |url=http://mysql.com/news-and-events/sun-to-acquire-mysql.html |accessdate=2008-01-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718044718/http://mysql.com/news-and-events/sun-to-acquire-mysql.html |archivedate=2011-07-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oracle in turn purchased Sun in January, 2010, acquiring their copyrights, patents, and trademarks. Thus, Oracle became the owner of both the most popular proprietary database and the most popular open-source database. Oracle's attempts to commercialize the open-source MySQL database have raised concerns in the FOSS community.{{sfn|Thomson|2011}} Partly in response to uncertainty about the future of MySQL, the FOSS community [[Fork (software development)|forked]] the project into new [[database management system|database systems]] outside of Oracle's control. These include [[MariaDB]], [[Percona]], and [[Drizzle (database)|Drizzle]].{{sfn|Samson|2011}} All of these have distinct names; they are distinct projects and cannot use the trademarked name MySQL.{{sfn|Nelson|2009}}

===Legal cases===
====Oracle v. Google====
In August, 2010, [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]] sued [[Google]], claiming that its use of [[Java (software platform)|Java]] in [[Android (software)|Android]] infringed on Oracle's copyrights and patents. The [[Oracle v. Google]] case ended in May 2012, with the finding that Google did not infringe on Oracle's patents, and the trial judge ruled that the structure of the Java APIs used by Google was not copyrightable. The jury found that Google infringed a small number of copied files, but the parties [[stipulation (law)|stipulated]] that Google would pay no damages.{{sfn|Niccolai|2012}} Oracle appealed to the [[Federal Circuit]], and Google filed a [[cross-appeal]] on the literal copying claim.{{sfn|Jones|2012}}

== As part/driver of a new socio-economic model ==
{{Main|Open-source model}}
{{See also|Commons-based peer production|Open content|Sharing economy|Post-scarcity economy}}

By defying ownership regulations in the construction and use of information − a key area of contemporary [[Economic growth|growth]] − the [[Free software movement|Free/Open Source Software (FOSS) movement]] counters [[neoliberalism]] and [[privatization]] in general.&lt;ref name=Geor&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Georgopoulou|first1=Panayiota|title=The free/open source software movement Resistance or change?|journal=Civitas - Revista de Ciências Sociais|date=2009|volume=9|issue=1|url=http://www.redalyc.org/html/742/74212712006/|accessdate=11 July 2017|issn=1519-6089}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By realizing the historical potential of an "[[economy of abundance]]" for the [[Digital Revolution|new digital world]] FOSS may lay down a plan for political resistance or show the way towards a potential [[Transformation of culture|transformation]] of [[capitalism]].&lt;ref name=Geor/&gt;

According to [[Yochai Benkler]], Jack N. and Lillian R. Berkman Professor for Entrepreneurial Legal Studies at [[Harvard Law School]], free software is the most visible part of a new economy of [[commons-based peer production]] of information, knowledge, and culture. As examples, he cites a variety of FOSS projects, including both free software and open-source.{{sfn|Benkler|2003}}

==Life and career==
Johnson studied at [[The Queen's College, Oxford]], winning a college scholarship, the [[John Ireland (Dean of Westminster)|Ireland]] scholarship and the university mathematics scholarship. He obtained a first-class degree in 1829 and was appointed to a college [[Oxbridge Fellow|fellowship]] in the same year.  He was ordained into the [[Church of England]] in 1834 and elected as a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in 1838.  He was appointed [[Savilian Professor of Astronomy]] in 1839, although his lack of astronomical knowledge led to the separation of the chair from the post of [[Radcliffe Observatory|Radcliffe Observer]].  In 1842, he changed professorships to become [[White's Professor of Moral Philosophy]], a post he held for three years. He advocated reform of Oxford and its colleges, an unpopular stance which he believed scuppered his chances of becoming Provost (head) of his college, although he was appointed as a commissioner under the [[Oxford University Act 1854]]. In 1854, Johnson was appointed [[Dean of Wells]], where his time was marred by a dispute about his unpopular decision to hold a parish position in Wells in addition to the deanery to supplement his income.  He published ''Optical Investigations'' (1835), a book of sermons in 1857 and ''Science and Natural Religion: a Sermon'' (which went to two editions).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=M.

'''Greenhouse Development Rights''' (GDRs) is a justice-based effort-sharing framework designed to show how the costs of rapid climate stabilization can be shared fairly, among all countries. More precisely, GDRs seeks to transparently calculate national “fair shares” in the costs of an emergency global climate mobilization, in a manner that takes explicit account of the fact that, as things now stand, global political and economic life is divided along both North/South and rich/poor lines.

Critically, GDRs approaches climate protection and economic development as two sides of one coin. Its goal is [[developmental justice]], as it might exist even in a world that is compelled to rapidly reduce greenhouse-gas emissions to near-zero levels. The GDRs analysis suggests that rapid climate stabilization will prove impossible without an extremely strong commitment – a right – to a dignified level of sustainable [[human development (humanity)]]. A right to life free from the privations of poverty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Athanasiou | first1 = Tom | last2 = Baer | first2 = Paul | last3 = Kartha | first3 = Sivan | last4 = Kemp-Benedict | first4 = Erik| title = The right to development in a climate constrained world | url = http://gdrights.org/2009/02/16/second-edition-of-the-greenhouse-development-rights/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GDRs approach builds, whenever possible, upon established scientific and political understandings. In particular, it explicitly codifies the foundational call of the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]], which seeks “the widest possible cooperation by all countries and their participation in an effective and appropriate international response, in accordance with their common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change | url=http://unfccc.int/essential_background/convention/background/items/1350.php | accessdate=May 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GDRs strategy is to transparently calculate responsibility and capacity for all countries, with respect to explicit assumptions and benchmarks that can be clearly debated, negotiated, and, when necessary, changed. By so doing, it seeks to provide a coherent, transparent, and compelling way of calculating and comparing national “fair shares” – broadly defined – of the cost of the global climate transition.

The goal of the GDRs effort is a sustainable mobilization that can be accepted as fair around the world. National obligations are calculated as shares of a global obligation that includes [[adaptation]] as well as [[Mitigation of global warming|mitigation]]. The approach here does not traditionally exhibit [[political realism]], for that term is generally understood to imply an approach that starts with what is politically realistic today. The GDRs approach, in contrast, seeks to outline an approach that is consistent with the requirements of the climate science.

In the GDRs framework, a country’s obligation to act is based upon its [[climate debt]] – its responsibility for contributing to climate change – and equally upon its capacity to act. Responsibility and capacity are both defined with respect to a “development threshold” that exempts the responsibilities and resources of the poor – survival resources and survival income – from being considered when calculating national obligation. Thus, GDRs can be seen as a ''reference framework'' intended to support clear, useful thinking about “comparability of effort,” even between widely disparate developed and developing nations.

Finally, GDRs is not an academic exercise. Climate stabilization is a global commons problem, one that is fundamentally defined by the problem of fair use. GDRs, by transparently calculating principle-based obligations to protect the global climate system, sets out a framework by which fair-shares emissions rights can be defined, calculated, understood, debated, and negotiated. As such, it lays out a framework by which actually existing climate treaties and strategies – even “bottom up pledges” like those welcomed by the Copenhagen Accord – can be transparently evaluated and compared.

== History ==
The Greenhouse Development Rights framework was developed and modeled by Paul Baer, Tom Athanasiou of [[EcoEquity]], Sivan Kartha and Eric Kemp-Benedict of the [[Stockholm Environment Institute]].
GDRs evolved from per-capita frameworks that conceive of fair-shares global effort-sharing in terms of equal rights to emit greenhouse gases. The most well known of these is the proposal of [[Anil Agarwal (environmentalist)|Anil Agarwal]] and [[Sunita Narain]] (1991),.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Agarwal | first1 = Anil | last2 = Narain | first2 = Sunita | title = Global Warming in an Unequal World: A Case of Environmental Colonialism, Centre for Science and Environment | year = 1991 | location = New Delhi | url = http://www.indiaenvironmentportal.org.in/content/global-warming-unequal-world-a-case-environmental-colonialism}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GDRs authors group felt that the per-capita emission rights approach lacked a systematic treatment of “national circumstances,” and attempted to solve this problem with a “Per-capita Plus” approach. They eventually concluded that, despite the obvious importance of the per-capita principle, it is not a viable foundation for a robust approach to a fair climate regime, not, at least, in a world where most all the “atmospheric space” has already been consumed. The Per-capita Plus approach was eventually abandoned in favor of GDRs (which is based not on per-capita rights but rather the UNFCCC principles of responsibility and capacity).
GDRs debuted at a side event at the Tenth Conference of Parties (COP10) in Argentina in December 2004, with a paper and presentation entitled ''Cutting the Gordian Knot''. The final, reworked version of this paper was published on April 15, 2005, under the title Cutting the Knot: Climate Protection, Political Realism, and Equity as Requirements of a Post-Kyoto Regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | authors = T. Athanasiou, P. Baer, D. Cornland, S. Kartha | title = Cutting the Knot: Climate Protection, Political Realism and Equity as requirements of a Post-Kyoto regime | url = http://gdrights.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/cuttingtheknot.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2010-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first edition of the GDRs book and model were published in 2007 by the [[Heinrich Böll Foundation]], and was presented at [[COP-13]] in Bali. The [http://www.gdrights.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/.../gdrs_execsummary.pdf GDRs second edition book] and model were released at [[COP 14]] in Poznan. The GDRs framework continues to evolve. It can best be tracked at the project [http://www.gdrights.org website].

== Development threshold ==
As a first step, GDRs codifies the [[right to development]] as a ''development threshold'' − a level of welfare below which people are not expected to share the costs of the climate transition.&lt;ref&gt;For a greater discussion of the Development Threshold, see section 3.2 of the GDRs 2nd edition http://gdrights.org/2009/02/16/second-edition-of-the-greenhouse-development-rights/&lt;/ref&gt; It’s important to note that this threshold is not an [[extreme poverty]] line, which is typically defined to be so low ($1 or $2 a day) as to be more properly called a “destitution line.” Rather, it is set to be above the global poverty line (about $16 per person per day, in [[Purchasing Power Parity]] terms ), and to reflect a level of welfare that is beyond basic needs, but still well short of today’s levels of affluent consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Who is Not Poor? Dreaming of a World Truly Free of Poverty | journal = The World Bank Research Observer | date = Spring 2006 | first = Pritchett | last = Lant | volume = 21 | issue = 1 | page = 23| url = http://wbro.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/short/21/1/1 | accessdate = 2010-05-31 | doi=10.1093/wbro/lkj002}} and {{cite journal | title = Who is not Poor? Proposing A Higher International Standard for Poverty | journal = Center for Global Development | date = November 2003 | first = Pritchett | last = Lant | id = }} Pritchett concluded that the use of an elevated poverty line is "justifiable, more consistent with international fairness, and is a better foundation for the World Bank’s organizational mission of poverty reduction” and that “If the poverty line were defined as the level of income at which people typically achieve acceptable levels of the Millennium Development Goal indicators (such as universal primary school completion), it would be set at about [$16] a day.”&lt;/ref&gt;
The level where a development threshold would best be set is a matter for debate. In the GDRs standard case, it is set to be modestly (25%) above the global poverty line, at about $20 per person per day ($7,500 per year). This figure reflects an empirical analysis of the income levels at which the classic plagues of poverty – malnutrition, high infant mortality, low educational attainment, high relative food expenditures – begin to disappear, or at least become exceptions to the rule. It also reflects the level at which the southern “middle class” begins to emerge.

Hardship, of course, persists at incomes above $7,500 per year, and a higher development threshold (and thus a more progressive effort-sharing function) can be strongly defended. But, for introductory purposes, the GDRs standard case takes people whose incomes are above $20 per day – be they lower middle-class or middle-class or wealthy – to have “developed,” in the most basic meaningful sense of the term. Poorer people, as they struggle for better lives, are taken to have little responsibility for the climate problem (the approximately 70 percent of humanity that lives below the development threshold is responsible for only about 15 percent of all cumulative emissions) and precious little capacity to invest in solving it.
Richer people are taken as having realized their right to development and as bearing the responsibility to preserve that right for others. As their incomes rise, they assume a greater faction of the costs of curbing the emissions associated with their own consumption, as well as the costs of ensuring that, as those who still live below the threshold rise toward and then above it, they are able to do so along sustainable, low-emission paths. Moreover, and critically, these obligations are taken to belong to all those above the development threshold, whether they happen to live in the North or in the South.

== Responsibility and capacity ==
Based on the global development threshold, and national emissions history and income distribution data, it is possible to calculate any country’s ''responsibility'' and ''capacity''.
:
* A nation’s ''responsibility'' is defined as the contribution it has made to climate change, and is specified in the GDRs standard case as its cumulative emissions since 1990. Emissions corresponding to consumption below the development threshold are excluded from the calculation. It is important to note that the 1990 baseline year is not fixed by the GDRs framework. Earlier dates are also plausible, and in practice the “responsibility state date” would be fixed by negotiation.
* A nation’s ''capacity'' is defined as the national income not demanded by the necessities of everyday life. Thus, any income above the development threshold is available to be “taxed” for investment in climate mitigation and adaptation. This can be more straightforwardly interpreted as total income, excluding income below the development threshold.

These measures of responsibility and capacity can be combined (by averaging, in the GDRs standard case) to determine a country’s obligation for shouldering the climate challenge, which is represented as a '''Responsibility and Capacity Index''' (RCI). This calculation is done for all countries. The precise numerical results depend, of course, on the particular values chosen for key parameters, such as the development threshold and the responsibility start date.

In the 2010 standard case, the United States, with its exceptionally large population of individuals with incomes above the $7,500 development threshold (capacity) and the world’s largest share of cumulative emissions since 1990 (responsibility), has the largest single share (32 percent) of global RCI. The EU follows with 25 percent of the global RCI. China, despite being relatively poor, is home to a significant number of people still living above the development threshold, and has a notable 6.6 percent share of global RCI, which puts it close behind Japan with its 7.4 percent. India is also large but far poorer, placing it far behind with a 0.8 percent share.

== Emission reduction pathways ==
GDRs is a reference framework. Its principal goal is to demonstrate the fair allocation of the effort (or "burden”) of managing the global climate transition among nations. In mitigation terms, the size of this effort can be expressed as an increasingly wide wedge (measured in tons) that defines a “mitigation gap” between a business-as-usual emissions trajectory and an “emergency pathway” that is defined in scientific terms (see the 2 °C Emergency Pathway shown in Figure 2).&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion of emergency pathways in general, and a specification of this one, see {{cite book | title=A 350 ppm Emergency Pathway| url=http://www.gdrights.org/2009/10/25/a-350-ppm-emergency-pathway}}&lt;/ref&gt;

National reduction obligations in any year are defined as shares of the global mitigation gap, which is allocated among countries in proportion to their RCI. The US, for example (see Figure 2) is projected to have a 2020 reduction obligation equal to 29.1% of the roughly 4 Gigatonnes of carbon mitigation that will then be needed. In general, each country is given an emission target equal to its reference trajectory&lt;ref&gt;The reference trajectory is essentially a business-as-usual trajectory, excluding some “no-regrets” options.&lt;/ref&gt; minus its proportional share of the global mitigation gap. Distributing the global mitigation gap in this way yields some striking results. For one thing, it clearly shows that a major commitment to North-South cooperation – including financial and technological transfers – is an inevitable part of any viable global climate stabilization architecture. This is because the national mitigation obligations of the high-RCI countries of the North vastly exceed the reductions they could conceivably make at home. In fact, by 2030, northern mitigation obligations typically come to exceed even their total domestic emissions. Which is to say that wealthier and higher emitting countries would receive “negative allocations,” as is necessary in order to open enough atmospheric space for the developing world. This kind of negative allocation can never arise under frameworks that seek to allocate “emission rights.”

== Institutional implications ==
Institutionally, there are many ways that a system like GDRs could be implemented. For example, an international fund could be used to support both mitigation and adaptation. In this case, the RCI would serve as the basis for determining each nation’s expected financial contribution to that fund. More generally, it’s useful to think about the RCI as, in effect, the basis of a progressive global “climate tax” – not a carbon tax, per se (carbon taxes are, all else being equal, regressive) but a ''responsibility'' and ''capacity'' tax. Alternatively, GDRs could be implemented by way of global emissions markets. In this case, national RCIs would be used to calculate allocations, in tons, and these would then be traded to generate the international financial flows necessary to support a fair global climate regime.

The real issue here is that the scale and nature of the financial and technological cooperation demanded by the climate crisis is unprecedented, and will inevitably involve the expansion and reform of existing institutions, as well as the creation of entirely new ones. Any number of devices might be useful: progressive taxes of various kinds, trade-related levies, auctions, rebates, sectoral agreements, multilateral funds, international property-rights concessions, and so on. Beyond these, new and as-yet unnamed channels for both international resource transfer and accounting will need to be conceived and implemented, inevitably posing an impressive set of challenges: How to scale up rapidly? How to build absorptive and distributional capacity? How to ensure efficiency and avoid waste? How to institute credible and democratic governance?

== Toward principle-based effort-sharing ==
Whatever the eventual utility of frameworks like GDRs, no principle-based effort-sharing system that would impose binding commitments on developing countries is likely to be adopted anytime soon. As long as developing countries are still lack convincing evidence that poverty eradication and human development can be attained simultaneously with decarbonization, binding commitments will appear too them as being too great a risk.

A transition to principle-based effort-sharing would require industrialized countries to embrace their commitment under the UNFCCC to “take the lead in combating climate change and the adverse effects thereof”, and in so doing convincingly demonstrate the existence of an alternative develop path. A trust-building and momentum-building period (lasting, say, to 2020) during which the industrialized countries prove the technical and political possibility of climate-friendly development would open up the possibility of a global regime based on principle-based effort-sharing.

== Other approaches to principle-based effort sharing ==
While the GDRs approach promotes a responsibility and capacity based effort-sharing regime, there are other approaches that aim to define fairness differently using different means.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | contribution = Going Clean – The Economics of China's Low-carbon Development | title = Stockholm Environment Institute and Chinese Economists 50 Forum | place = Stockholm, Sweden | page = 49 | date = November 2009| id = | contribution-url = http://sei-international.org/mediamanager/.../china.../china%20091207%20web.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2010-06-23 | quote = For a brief but excellent discussion of the issues here, see pages 11 to 14. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

::
* ''Simple per-capita'' takes national per-capita levels of greenhouse-gas emissions as its key equity indicator. The difference between GDRs and a simple per-capita approach is that the latter does not account for historical emissions or its strong correlation to national development.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | contribution = Mitigation: Contribution of Working Group III to the third assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change | title = Climate Change 2001 | editor-first = Bert | editor-last = Metz | publisher = Cambridge University Press | place = United States of America | page = 15 | year = 2001| id = | contribution-url = http://www.grida.no/publications/other/ipcc_tar/?src=/climate/ipcc_tar/ | accessdate = 2010-06-23 | quote = Carbon emissions are closely correlated to income levels – both across time and across nations – which suggests that restrictions on such emissions may have strong distributional effects}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, countries with larger cumulative emissions are wealthier countries with more developed infrastructures, and the per-capita approaches can therefore impede developmental justice.
* ''Cumulative per-capita'' approaches define climate justice as the convergence of, not individual per-capita emissions, but rather per-capita emissions over time. Over, perhaps, a very long time. Such approaches are considered to be quite reasonable by many developing-country analysts. Chinese analysts, in particular, seem to see them as direct responses to per-capita proposals.&lt;ref&gt;For example, He Jiankun, Chen Wenying, et al presented a paper at a COP15 side event entitled “Long-term Climate Change Mitigation Target and Carbon-Permit Allocation." In this paper the authors comment that “some developed countries advocate the principle of per capita emission convergence while China and other developing countries propose the principle of convergence of cumulative emissions per-capita to consider historical responsibility.” (Carbon Equity: Perspectives from Chinese Academic Community, Dec 10, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; Such an approach is reflected in the interest and recent popularity of the [[carbon debt]] approach to global climate justice.&lt;ref&gt;This upsurge of interest in climate debt began in early 2009, accelerated at the Copenhagen Conference of Parties, and became institutionalized as a pillar of climate-movement radicalism at the World People's Conference on Climate Change and the Rights of Mother Earth held in Cochabamba, Bolivia between April 19 and 22, 2010. For more information, see {{cite web | url = http://pwccc.wordpress.com/category/working-groups/08-climate-debt | title = The Archives of Working Group 8 on Climate Debt | accessdate = 2010-05-31 | first = Working Grouping 8 of the World People’s Conference}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aims of both the carbon debt campaign and the GDRs project are closely aligned. The two approaches embody altogether similar theories of equity and burden sharing, with differences that are minor, and even helpful, when it comes to fruitful debate and public education.

"'''Honour thy father and thy mother'''" is one of the [[Ten Commandments]] in the [[Hebrew Bible]]. The commandment is generally regarded in Protestant and Jewish sources as the fifth in both the list in Exodus 20:1–21, and in [[Deuteronomy]] (Dvarim) 5:1–23. Catholics count this as the fourth.&lt;ref&gt;‘’Ten Commandments,’’ ''New Bible Dictionary'', Second Edition, Tyndale House, 1982 pp. 1174–1175&lt;/ref&gt;

These commandments were enforced as law in many jurisdictions, and are still considered enforceable law by some.&lt;ref&gt;Posner, Richard A., ''How Judges Think'', Harvard University Press, 2008, p. 322&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bromiley, Geoffrey W., ''The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia'', 1988, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Williams, J.

See also Deuteronomy 27:16 and Proverbs 20:20.&lt;/ref&gt; and so the clause "so that you may live long" could be interpreted as "so that you are not put to death".  In the [[Talmud]], the commandment to honour one's human parents is compared to honoring God.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Mishneh Torah, Shoftim,  Mamrim 6:1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Kitzor Shulchan Aruch Yoreh Deah 143:1&lt;/ref&gt; According to the prophet [[Malachi]], God makes the analogy himself:
{{quote|
"A son honours his father, and a servant his master. If I am a father, where is the honour due me? If I am a master, where is the respect due me?" says the LORD Almighty. "It is you, O priests, who show contempt for my name. But you ask, 'How have we shown contempt for your name?'"|Malachi 1:6 (NIV)}}

==Judaism==
{{quote| What constitutes "honour?" One must provide them with food and drink and clothing. One should bring them home and take them out, and provide them with all their needs cheerfully. | Kitzur Shulchan Aruch 143:7}}

The commandment to honour one's human parents is compared to honouring God, for human owes his existence to his father and his mother.

{{quote|...Honor the body that bore thee, and the breasts that gave thee suck, maintain thy parents, for thy parents took part in thy creation." For man owes his existence to God, to his father, and to his mother, in that he receives from each of his parents five of the parts of his body, and ten from God. The bones, the veins, the nails, the brain, and the white of the eye come from the father. The mother gives him skin, flesh, blood, hair, and the pupil of the eye. God gives him the following: breath, soul, light of countenance, sight, hearing, speech, touch, sense, insight, and understanding...but if people do not honor their parents, God say: "It is good that I do not dwell among men, or they would have treated Me superciliously, too."&lt;ref&gt;Ginzberg, Louis (1909). ''[[Legends of the Jews|The Legends of the Jews]] [https://philologos.org/__eb-lotj/vol3/p03.htm#THE%20OTHER%20COMMANDMENTS%20REVEALED%20ON%20SINAI Vol III : The Other Commandments Revealed On Sinai]'' (Translated by Henrietta Szold) Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society.&lt;/ref&gt; | ''Legends of the Jews'' Vol. III}}

The Talmud says that since there are three partners in the creation of a person (God and two parents), honour showed to parents is the same as honour shown to God.&lt;ref&gt;Talmud Kiddushin 31&lt;/ref&gt; It also compares a number of similarly constructed passages from the Torah and concludes that honour toward parents and honour toward God are intentionally equated:
{{quote| Our Rabbis taught: It says, 'Honour your father and your mother' (Exodus 20:12), and it says, 'Honor God with your wealth' (Proverbs 3:9). By using the same terminology, the Torah compares the honour you owe your father and mother to the honour you have to give to the Almighty. It also says, 'Every person must respect his mother and his father' (Leviticus 19:3), and it says, 'God your Lord you shall respect, Him you shall serve' (Deuteronomy 10:20). Here the same word, respect, is used. The Torah equates the respect you owe your parents with the respect you must show God. Furthermore it says, 'Whoever curses his father or mother shall be put to death' (Exodus 21:17). And furthermore it says, 'Anyone that curses God shall bear his sin' (Leviticus 24.–15). By using the same terms the Torah compares cursing of parents with cursing the Almighty.&lt;ref&gt;(see also Kitzur Shulchan Aruch 143:1 and Sefer Maalot ha Middot)&lt;/ref&gt; | Talmud Kiddushin 31 }}

Because honouring parents is part of honouring God, the [[mitzvah]] does not depend on the worthiness of the parent:"Even if his father is wicked and a sinner, he must fear and revere him ... A convert to Judaism must not curse or despise his non-Jewish father." (Kitzur Shulchan Aruch 143:13,25)

It also requires honour to one's [[stepparent]]s&lt;ref&gt;Mishneh Torah, Shoftim, Mamrim 6:17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kitzor Shulchan Aruch Yoreh Deah 143:19&lt;/ref&gt; or an older sibling who is raising one,&lt;ref&gt;Plaut, W.

The commandment is repeated eight times throughout the bible.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}&lt;ref&gt;Exodus 21:11; Deuteronomy 5:16; Leviticus 19:3;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical beliefs===
Keeping this commandment was associated by the Israelites with the ability of the nation of Israel to remain in the land to which God was leading them.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="See also Deuteronomy 6:3-4"/&gt; According to the [[Torah]], striking or cursing one’s father or mother was punishable by immediate death.&lt;ref&gt;Exodus 21:15,17, Leviticus 20:9.  See also Deuteronomy 27:16 and Proverbs 20:20.&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[Deuteronomy]], a procedure is described for parents to bring a persistently disobedient son to the city elders for death by stoning.&lt;ref&gt;Deuteronomy 21:18–21. Note that the reference to the son being a drunkard would suggest that he is not a small child.&lt;/ref&gt;

Honouring one's parents is also described in the Torah as an analogue to honouring God.&lt;ref&gt;Commentary on Exodus 20:12, ''The Jewish Study Bible: Tanakh Translation''&lt;/ref&gt; According to the prophet [[Jeremiah]], God refers to himself as Father to Israel,&lt;ref&gt;Jeremiah 31:9&lt;/ref&gt; and according to the prophet [[Isaiah]], God refers to Israel as his sons and daughters.&lt;ref&gt;Isaiah 43:6&lt;/ref&gt; According to the prophet [[Malachi]], God calls for similar honour.&lt;ref&gt;Malachi 1:6 (NIV)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Jeremiah, God blessed the descendants of [[Rechabite|Rechab]]&lt;ref&gt;This family is first introduced in 2 Kings 10:15–31&lt;/ref&gt; for obeying their forefather's command to not drink wine and uses the family as a counterexample to Israel's failure to obey his command to not worship other gods:  {{quote|"Will you not learn a lesson and obey my words?" declares the LORD. "Jonadab son of Recab ordered his sons not to drink wine and this command has been kept. To this day they do not drink wine, because they obey their forefather's command. But I have spoken to you again and again, yet you have not obeyed me.  Again and again I sent all my servants the prophets to you. They said, 'Each of you must turn from your wicked ways and reform your actions; do not follow other gods to serve them. Then you will live in the land I have given to you and your fathers.' But you have not paid attention or listened to me. The descendants of Jonadab son of Recab have carried out the command their forefather gave them, but these people have not obeyed me." |Jeremiah 35:12–16 (NIV)}}

===Precedence===
According to the [[Mishneh Torah]] this commandment requires one to honour both of one's parents equally; there is no greater weight given to either the father or the mother. While in some parts of scripture, father is stated first, in others, mother comes first. This shows that the honour due to each is equal.&lt;ref&gt;Mishneh Torah, Shoftim, Mamrim 6:2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shulchan Aruch Yoreh Deah 240:14&lt;/ref&gt;

While Jewish teaching holds that a married woman must honour her husband, there are also guidelines for how she may continue to honour her parents:
{{quote| It is the duty of both men and women to honour their parents. However, a married woman, who owes devotion to her husband, is exempt from the precept of honouring her parents. Yet, she is obliged to do for the parents, all she can, if her husband does not object. | Kitzur Shulchan Aruch 143:17}}

===Requirements===
The commandment requires one to obey one's parents when the command given by a parent is reasonable and permissible under Jewish law. For example, if a parent asks a child to bring him/her water, he/she must obey.  Because honouring God is above all mitzvot, if a parent asks a child to break a [[halakha|law of the Torah]], s/he must refuse to obey.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;
{{quote| Everything that your father says to you, you are obliged to obey.  But if he says to you: "Let us bow down to idols", you must not obey him, lest you become an apostate. | Midrash, Yalkut Shimoni, Proverbs 960}}

{{quote| I am the Lord your God, and both you and your parents are equally bound to honour Me, therefore, you must not hearken to them to disregard My word. | Kitzur Shulchan Aruch 143:15}}

A child is not required to obey if a parent says that s/he must marry a particular person, or must not marry a person s/he wishes to marry, provided the marriage is permissible by Jewish law.&lt;ref&gt;Isaacs, ''The Jewish Book of Etiquette'' (p. 132)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Donin, Hayim Halevy. ''To be a Jew: A Guide to Jewish Observance in Contemporary Life''.  (p. 129) 1991 Basic Books. {{ISBN|0-465-08632-2}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ak6-iopHKaMC&amp;pg=PA129&amp;lpg=PA128&amp;dq=Honor+your+father+and+your+mother&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;output=html view on Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;

A child who is travelling has an obligation to communicate with his/her parents to let them know s/he is safe in order to prevent them from worrying.&lt;ref&gt;Sefer Chassidim 542 in Finkel, Avraham Yaakov. 1997 ''Sefer Chasidim: The Book of the Pious'' Jason Aaronson {{ISBN|1-56821-920-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A child must continue to honour his/her parent after their deaths. This can be done by reciting [[kaddish]] for 11 months and on the [[yarzeit]] (anniversary of the parent's death), and by donating charity in the memory of the parent. The study of Torah is also considered to be reverence toward a parent, for it shows that a parent raised a worthy child.{{sfn|Donin, p. 129}}

A child must never put a parent to shame, or speak arrogantly to a parent.{{sfn|Donin, p. 129}} A person who is told to do something by his/her mother for which his father does not like the result is not permitted to tell his/her father that his/her mother said to do that. This is because this could lead to his/her father cursing his/her mother.{{sfn|Isaacs, pp. 134–135}} A child is not permitted to interrupt or contradict a parent, or to disturb a parent's sleep.&lt;ref&gt;''The Little Midrash Says'', Volume III, The Book of Vayikra, by M. Weissman, C 1988, page 165&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Testament==
{{religious text primary|section|date=June 2015}}
[[File:Ruth Naomi Obed.jpg|thumb|130px|left|Ruth honoured her widowed mother-in-law Naomi. Simeon Solomon, 1860.]]

In the gospels, [[Jesus]] affirmed the importance of honouring one's father and mother (Matthew 15:1–9, Matthew 19:17–19, Mark 10:17–19, Luke 18:18–21) [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] quotes the commandment in his letter to the church in [[Epistle to the Ephesians|Ephesus]]:
{{quote|Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right. "Honour your father and mother" (this is the first commandment with a promise), "that it may go well with you and that you may live long in the land." (Ephesians 6:1–2, ESV. See also Colossians 3:20)| Ephesians 6:1–2 (ESV)}}

In his letters to the [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] and [[Saint Timothy|Timothy]], Paul describes disobedience to parents as a serious sin (Romans 1:29–31, 2 Timothy 3:2).

The words of Jesus and the teaching of Paul indicate that adult children remain obligated to honour their parents by providing for material needs. In the gospels, Jesus is portrayed as angry with some people who avoided materially providing for their parents by claiming the money they would have used was given to God (Matthew 15:3–8, Mark 7:9–12. In these passages, Jesus quotes Isaiah 29:13) According to the [[Gospel of John]], when Jesus was on the cross, he provided for his natural mother by giving the Apostle John the charge to care for her, which John accepted.&lt;ref name=erlc/&gt;

According to the gospel of [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]], the obligation to honour one's parents is bounded by one's obligation to God: "Whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me." (Matthew 10:37 ESV) Such boundaries, and the primacy of the first commandment itself, lead scholars to conclude that honouring one's parents does ''not'' include breaking God's law (i.e., committing a sin) at the behest of a parent.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary on Exodus 20:12–17 [http://www.christnotes.org/commentary.php?com=mhc&amp;b=2&amp;c=20 read online] (accessed 31 August 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;NIV Study Bible. 1999. Zondervan. Note on Colossians 3:20 with reference to Acts 5:29&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul's instructions to Timothy regarding the physical care of widows include the following:
{{quote|But if a widow has children or grandchildren, these should learn first of all to put their religion into practice by caring for their own family and so repaying their parents and grandparents, for this is pleasing to God.|1 Timothy 5:4 (NIV)}}

==Christian==

===Catholicism===
The import of honouring father and mother is based on the divine origin of the parental role:
{{quote|The divine fatherhood is the source of human fatherhood. (Ephesians 3:14) This is the foundation of the honour owed to parents. ... It is required by God's commandment. (Exodus 20:12) Respect for parents (filial piety) derives from gratitude toward those who, by the gift of life, their love and their work, have brought their children into the world and enabled them to grow in stature, wisdom, and grace.{{sfn|CCC §§2214–2215}}}}

According to the teachings of the Catholic Church, the commandment to honour father and mother reveals God's desired order of charity – first God, then parents, then others.{{sfn|CCC §2197}} Keeping the commandment to honour father and mother brings both spiritual and temporal rewards of peace and prosperity, while failure to honor parents harms the individual as well as society.{{sfn|CCC §2200}} The pervasive societal effect of obedience or disobedience to this command is attributed to the status of the family as the fundamental building block of society:
{{quote|The family is the original cell of social life. ...Authority, stability, and a life of relationships within the family constitute the foundations for freedom, security, and fraternity within society. The family is the community in which, from childhood, one can learn moral values, begin to honour God, and make good use of freedom. Family life is an initiation into life in society.{{sfn|CCC §2207}}}}

The [[Gospel of Luke]] notes that, as a child, Jesus was obedient to his earthly parents. For a child in the home, the commandment to honour parents is comprehensive, excluding immoral actions. Grown children, while not obligated to obedience in the same way, should continue to afford respect for parental wishes, advice and teaching.{{sfn|CCC §2217}} "Filial respect is shown by true docility and obedience. 'My son, keep your father's commandment, and forsake not your mother's teaching. ... When you walk, they will lead you; when you lie down, they will watch over you...'" (Proverbs 6:20–22){{sfn|CCC §2216}}

The Church teaches that adult children have a duty to honour their parents by providing "material and moral support in old age and in times of illness, loneliness, or distress".{{sfn|CCC §2218}} This honour should be based on the son or daughter's gratitude for the life, love and effort given by the parents and motivated by the desire to pay them back in some measure.{{sfn|CCC §2215}}

The principle of the commandment is extended to the duty to honour others in direct authority, such as teachers, and employers.{{sfn|CCC §2199}} The commandment to honour father and mother also forms a basis for charity to others when each person is seen, ultimately, as "a son or daughter of the One who wants to be called 'our Father'."{{sfn|CCC §2212}} Thus, charitable actions are viewed as extensions of the honour owed to the heavenly Father.

===Orthodox Church===
Father Seraphim Stephens sees "Honor" defined as "Love and Respect", and notes that this commandment is positioned between those that address one's obligations to God and those that relate to how one treats others. "It clearly lays the foundation of our relationship to God and to all other people."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roca.org/OA/142/142m.htm Stephens, Seraphim. "Honor thy Father and thy Mother", Orthodox America, 1996]&lt;/ref&gt; Richard D. Andrews points out that, "Every time we do something good, just, pure, holy, we bring honor to our parents."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orthodoxytoday.org/articles7/AndrewsParents.php Andrews, Richard Demetrius. "Honor thy Father and Mother", ''Orthodoxy Today'', June 2, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protestantism===
[[John Calvin]] describes the sacred origin of the role of human father (which thus demands honour). The analogy between the honour of parents and the honour of God himself is further strengthened by this understanding that earthly fatherhood is derived from God's Fatherhood.  Thus the duty to honour does not depend on whether the parent is particularly worthy. However, Calvin acknowledges that some fathers are outright wicked and emphasizes there is no excuse for sin in the name of honouring a parent, calling the notion "absurd".&lt;ref&gt;Calvin, John. ''Harmony of the Law, Part III'', Commentary on Exodus 20:12 and Deuteronomy 5:16 [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/calvin/calcom05.ii.i.ii.html read online]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Since, therefore, the name of Father is a sacred one, and is transferred to men by the peculiar goodness of God, the dishonouring of parents redounds to the dishonour of God Himself, nor can any one despise his father without being guilty of an offence against God, (sacrilegium.) If any should object that there are many ungodly and wicked fathers whom their children cannot regard with honour without destroying the distinction between good and evil, the reply is easy, that the perpetual law of nature is not subverted by the sins of men; and therefore, however unworthy of honour a father may be, that he still retains, inasmuch as he is a father, his right over his children, provided it does not in anywise derogate from the judgement of God; for it is too absurd to think of absolving under any pretext the sins which are condemned by His Law; nay, it would be a base profanation to misuse the name of father for the covering of sins.&lt;ref name="ccel.org"&gt;Calvin, John. Harmony of the Law, Part III. Commentary on Exodus 20:12 and Deuteronomy 5:16 [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/calvin/calcom05.ii.i.ii.html read online]&lt;/ref&gt; | John Calvin, commentary on Exodus 20:12 and Deuteronomy 5:16}}

The commentary of [[John Wesley]] on the commandment to honour father and mother is consistent with the interpretation in the Catechism of the Catholic Church. He summarizes the actions that express honour as follows: 1. An inward esteem of them, outwardly expressed, 2. Obedience to their lawful commands (Ephesians 6:1–3), 3. Submission to their rebukes, instructions and corrections, 4. Acting with consideration of parental advice, direction and consent, 5. Giving comfort and providing for physical needs of aged parents.&lt;ref&gt;Wesley, John. Notes on the Bible: Notes on the Second Book of Moses, commentary on Exodus 20:12 [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/wesley/notes.ii.iii.xxi.ii.html read online]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;see also Matthew Henry's Commentary on the Whole Bible, comments on Exodus 20:12 [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/henry/mhc1.Ex.xxi.html read online]&lt;/ref&gt; Like the Catechism, Wesley also teaches that the commandment includes honouring others in legitimate secular authority. He also encourages people toward honour of those in spiritual leadership with the question, "Have ye all obeyed them that watch over your souls, and esteemed them highly in love for their work's sake?" This question is reminiscent of Paul's statements to the church in Galatia and to Timothy.&lt;ref&gt;Galatians 6:6 and 1 Timothy 5:17–18&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Matthew Henry]] explains that the commandment to honour father and mother applies not only to biological parents but also to those who fulfill the role of mother or father. He uses the example of [[Esther]] honouring her guardian and cousin Mordecai:
{{quote|Mordecai being Esther's guardian or pro-parent, we are told ... How respectful she was to him. Though in relation she was his equal, yet, being in age and dependence his inferior, she honoured him as her father—did his commandment, v. 20. This is an example to orphans; if they fall into the hands of those who love them and take care of them, let them make suitable returns of duty and affection. The less obliged their guardians were in duty to provide for them the more obliged they are in gratitude to honour and obey their guardians.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Henry's Commentary on Esther Chapter 2 [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/henry/mhc2.xvii.iii.html read online]&lt;/ref&gt; | Matthew Henry, commentary on Esther 2}}

[[File:Esther Mordechai Purim.jpg|thumb|350px|left|Esther and Mordecai writing the second letter of Purim. Arent de Gelder, ca. 1685. Oil on canvas, RISD Museum of Art, Providence RI]]

The commandment itself encourages obedience "so that you may enjoy long life and that it may go well with you".&lt;ref&gt;Deuteronomy 5:16&lt;/ref&gt;  Henry, Wesley and Calvin affirm the applicability of this promise for all who keep the commandment, though each notes that for the New Testament Christian, the promise may be fulfilled as earthly rewards and/or heavenly rewards, as God sees fit in his wisdom and love for the individual.

In his commentary, Calvin notes the harsh consequences required in Exodus and Leviticus for specific failures to keep the commandment. Those who struck or cursed a parent were to be sentenced to death.&lt;ref&gt;Exodus 21:15,17 and Leviticus 20:9&lt;/ref&gt; Persistently disobedient sons were to be brought before the city elders and stoned by the whole community if the parents' testimony was judged to be accurate.&lt;ref&gt;Deuteronomy 21:18–21&lt;/ref&gt;  Calvin writes that God knew capital punishment for these offences would seem harsh and be difficult to pronounce, even for those responsible for adjudicating the situation. This is why, he argues, the text specifically places responsibility for the consequences on the offender. The severity of the sentence emphasized the importance of removing such behaviour from the community and deterring others who might imitate it.&lt;ref&gt;Calvin, John. Harmony of the Law, Part III. Commentary on Exodus 21:15, 17 and Leviticus 20:9 [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/calvin/calcom05.ii.i.ii.html read online]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Calvin refers mostly to fathers in his commentary on the commandment to honour father and mother, he writes near the beginning that the commandment mentions both parents on purpose.&lt;ref name="ccel.org"/&gt; As described above, Proverbs supports the value of guidance from both father and mother,&lt;ref&gt;Proverbs 6:20–22&lt;/ref&gt; and Paul specified  that children should provide for their own widowed mothers and grandmothers, “which is pleasing to God.”&lt;ref&gt;1 Timothy 5:4&lt;/ref&gt;

Just as "honor" involves offering profound respect, the opposite of honoring someone is to trivialize him, as if of no importance.&lt;ref name=erlc&gt;[http://erlc.com/resource-library/articles/honor-your-father-and-mother "Honor your father and mother", The Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Respect is not something based solely on personal or professional qualifications, but also on the position that God has given that person. In 1 Samuel 26 David spares Saul’s life, even at the risk of losing his own, submitting to the authority God had placed over him as anointed king.&lt;ref name=erlc/&gt;

==Rewards for compliance==
This commandment is distinct from the others in that a promise is attached to it: "...so that you may live long in the land the Lord your God is giving you."&lt;ref&gt;Plaut and Stein,''The Torah: A Modern Commentary''(p. 504)&lt;/ref&gt; Deuteronomy 5:16 amplifies this: "...that your days may be prolonged, and that it may be well with you, in the land which the Lord your God is giving you."
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jba.gr/Articles/jba2004_06.htm Kioulachoglou, Anastasios. "Honor your father and mother", ''Journal of Bible Accuracy'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences of disobedience==
As with most terms of the [[Mosaic covenant|covenant]] between God and Israel, there are consequences for disobedience as well as rewards for obedience:
{{quote | Just as the reward for honouring father and mother is very great, the punishment for transgressing it is very great. And the one who afflicts his parents causes the shechinah [presence of God] to separate from him and harsh decrees fall upon him and he is given many sufferings. And even if life smiles on him in this life, he will surely be punished in the World to Come. | Kitzur Shulchan Aruch 143:4}}

An indigenous philosopher is an indigenous person or associate who practices philosophy and has a vast knowledge of various indigenous history, culture, language, and traditions. There are very few contemporary indigenous philosophers alive today.

==Epistemology and science==
[[File:Native American Faith (4180525160).jpg|thumb|Ceremonies play a key part in Native American philosophy.|245x245px]]
Epistemology refers to the study of knowledge, the ways in which a person acquires and processes information. Among Indigenous cultures, epistemology is understood differently and more inherently than how it is understood in Western philosophy.  Native American epistemology is found primarily in theories, philosophies, histories, ceremonies and nature as multiple ways of knowing. Emphasis is put on the importance of language as one of the vital components of Native American epistemology.{{sfnb|Battise|2002|p=17}} It is through the unique symbolism and the close connection with nature, that Native Americans consider knowledge to be acquired. In relation to consciousness, rationality and other heavily studied psychological states, the inherent structure of the complex Native American language is necessary to understand in the obtainment of indigenous knowledge.{{sfnb|Battise|2002|p=17}} There is also a strong link between nature and the interpretation of knowledge within Native American culture. It is believed that the mind interacts with the environment in a very active, conscious way.{{sfnb|Hester and Cheney|2001|pp=319-34}} The process through which they interact with nature is through the necessary need for survival but also through a deep respect and understanding the land as a huge part of their identity. It is vital to understand how to gather medicine, predict weather conditions so as to effectively produce food, and how to navigate through the land in order to grow and thrive as part of an ecological dependent community. Native American knowledge is continuously adapting to the changing environment as the ecosystem evolves and this is how epistemology is understood to have such a strong root to nature.{{sfnb|Parry et. al|2007|pp=625-66}}

===Phenomenology===
[[File:Native American Artifacts.jpg|thumb|Native American artifacts |245x245px]]
Native American science and understanding is said to have a basis in perceptual [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], meaning the philosophical study of phenomena.{{sfnb|Cajete|2003|p=45}} In this context, phenomenology refers to the examination of ones experiences to come to a personal world view.{{sfnb|Arola|2011}} Something is believed to be true when it has been verified by experiences and provides explanations which assist in completing tasks.This worldview is dynamic as new experiences alter this worldview and add to it.{{sfnb|Battiste|2002|pp=1-69}} There is no belief in a universal worldview which could explain all aspects of reality for a permanent set of time.

The world is viewed as infinitely complex and so it is impossible to come to a universal understanding of it.{{sfnb|Moore et. al|2007}} Therefore, Native Americans believe that useful knowledge can only be acquired through individual experience which, whilst subjective, is valid to that space and time.{{sfnb|Barnhardt|2005|pp=8-23}} The method of interacting with the environment is never made fixed and instead, is carried through generations who continuously revise it and add to it.{{sfnb|Battiste|2002|pp=1-69}}  This creates a [[Coherentism|web of knowledge]] shaped by the individual experiences of a community.

The subjectivity of experience and circumstance means that each Indigenous community's beliefs will be distinct. Indigenous people believe that experience can always present a better way of interacting with the environment.{{sfnb|Arola|2011}}{{sfnb|Barnhardt|2005|pp=8-23}} As a result of this understanding, no belief is viewed as being supremely valid when compared to another belief.{{sfnb|Moore et. al|2007}} A belief receives its validity from experience.Regardless of whether an experience is ordinary and extraordinary, they are both viewed the same and are equally useful for gathering knowledge.{{sfnb|Tedlock and Tedlock|1992}} Everything is viewed as possible in the world as no universal laws are seen to govern how the world exists. Each person in their own environment and circumstance can derive their own beliefs which is completely valid and logical in their personal circumstance.

===The principle of relatedness===
Brian Yazzie Burkhart, a [[Cherokee]], has described his experience of the story of Coyote:

{{quote|Coyote is wandering around in his usual way when he comes upon a prairie dog town. The prairie dogs laugh and curse at him. Coyote gets angry and wants revenge. The sun is high in the sky. Coyote decides that he wants clouds to come. He is starting to hate the prairie dogs and so thinks about rain. Just then a cloud appears.

Coyote says, "I wish it would rain on me." And that is what happened.

Coyote says, "I wish there were rain at my feet." And that is what happened.

"I want the rain up to my knees," Coyote says. And that is what happened.

"I want the rain up to my waist," he then says. And that is what happened.{{sfnb|Burkhart|2003|pp=15-16}}}}

Eventually, the entire land is flooded. Coyote's mistake is not letting what is right guide his actions, but instead acting entirely on his own motivations. This is a reminder that one must be careful about what one desires, and must keep in mind the things around us and how we relate to them. Burkhart terms this the principle of relatedness:{{sfnb|Burkhart|2003|p=16}}

{{quote|The idea here is simply that the most important things to keep in mind are the simple things that are directly around us in our experience and the things to which we are most directly related. In calling these ideas principles, I do not mean to give them special philosophical status. In American Indian thought, they are simply ways of being. These principles are merely abstractions from these ways of being. ... Principles in the traditional philosophical sense have no place in American Indian philosophy.{{sfnb|Burkhart|2003|p=16}}}}

==Metaphysics==
Anne Waters has described a "nondiscreet [[ontology]] of being" in the context of gender.{{sfnb|Waters|2003|p=97}} With a different attitude towards labels, Waters argues that American Indian viewpoints are more tolerant to those that don't fit into a strict binary gender framework.{{sfnb|Waters|2003|p=97}}

==Differences to other philosophical traditions==
[[File:American Horse Tribal Council, 1903.png|thumb|287x287px|[[American Horse]] Tribal Council 1903 (includes [[Red Cloud]])- meeting of Native Americans.]]
The canon of Western philosophy (WP) is rooted in the [[Platonism|Platonic]] understanding of truth (the form of the truth) being stable immutable and present, upon which philosophical investigations take place.{{Dubious|Revamp|reason=A strange generalization to make given the diversity of opinions in the Western tradition|date=April 2018}} On the other hand, Native American philosophy (NAP) holds that the stability for the basis of such inquiry in the native world is found not in absolutes, rather the consistencies in a complexity of the world.{{sfnb|Arola|2011|p=556}} This concept of an absolute simplified starting point against finding similarities in a complex matrix is highlighted in particular in the different ways notes how NAP and WP analyse space and time. Typical WP views the world in sections: the universe is views as created [[ex nihilo]] (implying it had a definitive beginning and most likely with have a definitive end) and is depicted as violent (e.g. 'the big bang'). Moreover, time is broken up into 3 simple sections that all acts can fit within: past, present and future, all of which have definable boundaries that actions in reality can go up to and occasional cross.{{sfnb|Younker|2008|pp=641-42}} Conversely, Cordova notes that NAP views space as being a concept that connects everything to our global environment and time as an endless continuous motion. The universe is considered as infinite and unbound; being in constant motion with no beginning or end and is balanced and stable despite occasional "temporary sadness."{{sfnb|Moore|2007|p=117}} Similarly, time does not belong to an absolute and bounded category in NAP, it is not a self-existing thing independent of human acknowledgement. Time is not even another dimension - it is nothing more than a human construct. Instead, it is, "merely a measure of motion ... the sun, stars, and moon through the sky, of changes that are visible and can be predicted."{{sfnb|Moore|2007|p=118}}

==Early life and education==
Prezent was born in 1902 in the town of [[Toropets]] in a [[Jews|Jewish]] family.&lt;ref name="Prezent Isaak Izrailevich" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Who's Who"&gt;{{cite book|last1=McCauley|first1=Martin|title=Who's Who in Russia Since 1900|date=1997|publisher=Routledge|location=London and New York|isbn=0-415-13898-1|page=163|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q2RF5YGDZAsC&amp;pg=PA163&amp;dq=who%27s+who+in+russia+prezent&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjCkpek1vzTAhUC5iYKHXw8A7EQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=19 May 2017|ref=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father owned a shop in [[Zapadnaya Dvina]].&lt;ref name="Prezent Isaak Izrailevich" /&gt;

Prezent went to high school in [[Dukhovshchina, Smolensk Oblast|Dukhovshschina]], and after completing it in 1919, he returned to Zapadnaya Dvina to teach in a local railway school. He became a [[Communism|communist]] activist while still in high school. Parallel with being a teacher in Zapadnaya Dvina, he helped found a local branch of [[Komsomol]], and was finally accepted as a [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|party]] member in 1921. Later that year he moved to [[Pskov]] to assume a gubernatorial-level party function. Following a party decision, he enrolled at [[Saint Petersburg State University|Leningrad State University (LGU)]] in 1922. He temporarily left university in 1923 to take part in the late stages of the [[Russian Civil War|Civil War]] as a political instructor. He soon resumed his studies, and graduated from Faculty of Social Sciences of LGU in 1926.&lt;ref name="Prezent Isaak Izrailevich" /&gt; As a recognition for his work on biology, he was awarded a doctorate in biological sciences in 1936.&lt;ref name="Vikent'ev"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vikent'ev|first1=Igor' Leonardovich|title=Prezent Isaak (Isay) Izrailevich|url=http://vikent.ru/author/1613/|website=vikent.ru: vydayushchiesya dostizheniya|publisher=Vikent'ev Igor' Leonardovich|accessdate=19 May 2017|ref=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
After graduating, Prezent worked on achieving transition from social sciences to biology by acquainting himself to some of the lead Soviet [[biologists]] of the time, including geneticist [[Nikolai Vavilov]]. Prezent even briefly worked for Vavilov at the [[Institute of Plant Industry]]. However, the two would later become major adversaries, once Prezent joined Lysenko and denounced genetics.&lt;ref name="Weiner"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Weiner|first1=Douglas R.|title=Models of Nature: Ecology, Conservation and Cultural Revolution in Soviet Russia|date=2000|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|location=Pittsburgh, Pa|isbn=0-8229-5733-7|pages=129–133|edition=2nd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b8_2PvhwnO8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=weiner+models+of+nature&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj9t5yXx_3TAhVESiYKHRhZBfEQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=20 May 2017|ref=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After leaving Vavilov, Prezent started teaching at [[Herzen University|Herzen Pedagogical Institute]], where he quickly rose through the academic ranks and became a docent within a couple of years.&lt;ref name="Prezent Isaak Izrailevich" /&gt;&lt;ref name="the journal article" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Weiner" /&gt; At the same time, he was active in the [[Scientific Society of Marxists]] (NOM, [[Acronym#Nomenclature|initialism]] for Nauchno obshchestvo marksistov). There he co-headed the group focused on biology. In 1930, NOM was merged into the [[Communist Academy]], and in that or following year Prezent assumed a position of the head of biology sector of the natural science section of the [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]] branch of Communist Academy. In 1931, he started teaching [[Dialectic#Marxist dialectic|dialectics]] of nature and [[evolution]]ary studies at LGU, parallel with his activities in the Communist Academy.&lt;ref name="Prezent Isaak Izrailevich" /&gt; In this early part of his career, Prezent was mostly focused on [[ecology]].&lt;ref name="Weiner" /&gt;

However, from 1932 on, many of the academic Marxist societies were shut down, after the proponents of [[1928-1931 cultural revolution in Russia|"cultural revolution"]] fell out of favor with the regime. In 1934, Prezent had to leave university, and he moved to [[Odessa]], where he worked with [[Trofim Lysenko]] at [[All-Union Institute of Selection and Genetics]] until 1938.&lt;ref name="Prezent Isaak Izrailevich" /&gt; The alliance with Lysenko proved extremely useful for both men, as Lysenko got a politically-savvy mentor in Prezent, while Prezent managed to return to political grace by associating himself with Lysenko and changing his views on biology and genetics in the process. From 1935 to 1941, Prezent was a deputy editor-in-chief of journal ''Yarovizaciya'' (Russian: ''Яровизация'', meaning [[Vernalization]]).&lt;ref name="Prezent Isaak Izrailevich" /&gt; In 1939, he became Lysenko's consultant for philosophical issues at [[VASKhNIL|Lenin All-Union Academy of Agricultural Science]] (VASKhNIL) in [[Moscow]], where he became a full member in 1948. From 1943 until 1951, Prezent held a chair of Darwinism and History of Biology at LGU, while for the final three years of that period (1948-1951) simultaneously being the dean of the Faculty of Biology of [[Moscow State University]] (MGU).&lt;ref name="Prezent Isaak Izrailevich" /&gt;

In 1951, Prezent was made to leave both university positions due to concerns about his capacity to teach biology. He returned to VASKhNIL, where he stayed until the beginning of 1969, when he was dismissed due to his association with Lysenkoism.&lt;ref name="the journal article" /&gt;

==Attacks on ecology==
During the early 1930s, Prezent established himself as a critic of the leading Soviet ecologists of the time, and especially of the sub-field of [[biocenology]] as such. His attack on biocenologists had three directions: attack on the [[Botany|botanically]]-oriented ecologists, attack on then-most prominent Soviet educator in the field [[Boris Yevgenyevich Raikov]], and finally attack on [[zoology]]-focused ecologists.&lt;ref name="Weiner" /&gt;

Prezent's attack on plant ecologists occurred in February 1931. As a representative of Leningrad branch of Communist Academy, he had a role in the organization of the First All-Union Conference of Geobotanists and Floristics Experts. The conference was sponsored by the Botanical Institute, but Prezent nonetheless managed to overtake "methodological leadership" and put forward his agenda against biocenological botanists.&lt;ref name="Weiner" /&gt;

Boris Raikov was Prezent's former colleague from Herzen Institute, and as of 1930 he was already under attacks from the organization of [[young naturalists]]. Prezent objected to Raikov's [[Conservation movement|conservationist]] views. He considered conservationism a "wrecking theory", holding that it opposed the Stalinist views on progress, understood here as a triumph of working men and their technology. Proponents of conservationism, such as Raikov, were therefore considered by Prezent to be "[[Foreign agent|agents]] of the world [[Bourgeoisie#Marxist theory|bourgeoisie]]". In 1932, one of the Prezent's anti-Raikov speeches, titled ''Class Struggle on the Natural Science Front'' was published in 20,000 copies, which marked the demise of conservationism in ecological education. Raikov and his associates were arrested or exiled.&lt;ref name="Weiner" /&gt; Raikov himself spent the [[Great Patriotic War (term)|World War II]] teaching in [[Arkhangelsk]].

The attack on zoologists started early, during the Fourth All-Union Congress of Zoologists, Anatomists, and Histologists in [[Kiev]] in May 1930, where Prezent first made his criticism of biocenology public in an exchange with the prominent zoologist [[Vladimir Vladimirovich Stanchinskiy]]. Similarly to the tactics he employed in fighting the botanists, Prezent waited until the December 1931 All-Union Faunistics Conference, and navigated its organization into silencing and attacking conservationsim.&lt;ref name="Weiner" /&gt;

==Prezent's cooperation with Lysenko==
{{Main|Lysenkoism}}
Prezent first met Lysenko at the Congress of [[Genetics|Geneticists]] and Breeders in 1929,&lt;ref name="the journal article" /&gt; but it was not until 1934 that they started closely cooperating in Lysenko's lab in Odessa. By that time, Lysenko was already following [[Ivan Vladimirovich Michurin|Michurin's]] version of [[Lamarckism]], but he was not yet associating his work in the field of genetics with any political positions. However, after 1934, Prezent began introducing Lysenko to Marxist theory and party politics, which led to increasingly political tone of Lysenko's pronouncements, as well as to both Lysenko and Prezent denouncing [[Mendelian inheritance|Mendelian genetics]].&lt;ref name="the journal article" /&gt; Prezent's influence on Lysenko was not limited to the philosophical and political aspects of the latter's work. Despite Prezent's lack of formal education in biology, he was one of Lysenko's main sources of information on [[Darwinism]].&lt;ref name="the journal article" /&gt;

Lysenko eventually produced a [[Pseudoscience|pseudo-scientific]] synthesis of Michurin's evolutionary biology, Prezent's philosophy of science, and [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] political theory that came to be known as Lysenkoism. Lysenko's teachings were based on his concept of "natural cooperation", as opposed to [[Charles Darwin|Darwin's]] idea of [[natural selection]] that he rejected. According to Lysenko, not only that the [[Inheritance of acquired characteristics|acquired characteristics of organisms were inheritable]], but it was even possible for organisms of one species to transform into another species by acquiring appropriate characteristics over the course of their lives. The proponents of Lysenkoism advocated for the use of these "findings" in agriculture in order to increase [[Crop yield|yields]], and alleviate the consequences of the [[Soviet famine of 1932-33]].

While many of Lysenko's views on [[agriculture]], as well as his prominence, predated his cooperation with Prezent, it was only after 1934 that his debate with the mainstream geneticists became politicized. In that period, and with the full support of [[Stalin]], many of the Soviet geneticists were [[Great Purge|purged]] or at least fired. In 1935 and 1936 Lysenko and Prezent brought the debates over genetics to the center of party politics. In those two years, the so-called "Academy Sessions" took place. It was a series of scientific debates chaired by Stalin himself, where Lysenko and Prezent counterposed their views to those of mainstream geneticists. The entire time, Prezent was extremely active in presenting Lysenko's works publicly as acts of genius. The full triumph came during a conference in 1948, when Lysenko announced genetics to be a [[bourgeois pseudoscience]], and that the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee]] supported such stance.&lt;ref name="the journal article" /&gt; After this, any serious engagement with non-Lysenkoist genetics became impossible in the Soviet union until 1964, especially at Lysenko-headed VASKhNIL, and Prezent-headed MGU Department of Darwinism.

==Death==
Isaak Prezent died of cancer on January 6, 1969 in Moscow. It was only several days after being dismissed from VASKhNIL.&lt;ref name="the journal article" /&gt;

==Awards==
In 1943, Prezent was awarded [[Order of the Red Banner of Labour]].&lt;ref name="Prezent Isaak Izrailevich" /&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Itsuo Tsuda'''|津田 逸夫|Tsuda Itsuo|3 May 1914 – 10 March 1984}}&lt;ref name="EoA"&gt;S. Pranin, [http://www.aikidojournal.com/encyclopedia?entryID=713 The Encyclopedia of Aikido] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605115612/http://www.aikidojournal.com/encyclopedia?entryID=713 |date=2011-06-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was a Japanese [[Philosophy|philosopher]] and a practitioner and teacher of [[aikido]] and Seitai.

Tsuda was born in [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese-ruled Korea]].&lt;ref name="EoA" /&gt; When he was 16 years old, he defied his father, who wished for his eldest son to remain home and manage his family's estate. He left his family home and begin wandering, searching for new philosophies that would free his mind.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pagespro-orange.fr/tansen/bioethics//seitai/tsuda.htm Biography]&lt;/ref&gt;

Having reconciled with his father, in 1934 he went to France, where he studied with [[Marcel Granet]] and [[Marcel Mauss]] until 1940, when he went back Japan: he studied [[Noh]] with Hosada, Seitai with  [[Haruchika Noguchi]] and [[aikido]] with  [[Morihei Ueshiba]].

In 1970 Itsuo Tsuda came back to Europe to disseminate the regenerative movement (or katsugen undō 活元運動, かつげんうんどう, a basic Seitai practice) and his ideas on [[Qi|Ki]]. In 1973 he published his first book, "Le Non-Faire"&lt;ref&gt;Paris: Courrier du Livre; Translation: "Not Doing". Sum. {{ISBN|2-88063-007-X}}. Out of print; Italian Translation: "Il Non-Fare. Scuola della Respirazione". Milano, Luni Editrice, 2003; {{ISBN|88-7435-023-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; while waiting to open his first dojo, in Paris, L'Ecole de la Respiration (also the title of his series of books).

He died in Paris in 1984, but his practical philosophy is left in his work and his books and taught in several European "School of Breathing" [[dojo]]s.

'''Kurt Baier''' (January 26, 1917 – November 7, 2010)&lt;ref name=PPGobit&gt;{{cite news|title=Obituary: Kurt Baier / One of the founders of Pitt's philosophy department|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/10318/1103194-122.stm|work=Pittsburgh Post Gazette|accessdate=5 May 2011|first=MacKenzie|last=Carpenter|date=14 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an [[Austrians|Austrian]] [[moral philosopher]] who taught for most of his career in [[Australia]] and the [[United States]].

==Life and career==
Born in [[Cincinnati]], [[Ohio]], Baier studied law at the [[University of Vienna]].&lt;ref name="post-gazette.com"&gt;http://www.post-gazette.com/news/obituaries/2010/11/14/Obituary-Kurt-Baier-One-of-the-founders-of-Pitt-s-philosophy-department/stories/201011140196&lt;/ref&gt; In 1938, after the [[Anschluss]] he had to abandon his studies, and went to the [[United Kingdom]] as a refugee, where he was interned as a "friendly enemy alien" and sent to [[Australia]] on the [[HMT Dunera|''Dunera'']]. There he began studying [[philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bookrags.com/research/baier-kurt-1917-eoph/ | title = BookRags biography | accessdate=2008-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baier received his [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] from the [[University of Melbourne]] in 1944, and his [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] in 1947. In 1952, he received his [[DPhil]] at [[Oxford University]].&lt;ref name="post-gazette.com"/&gt;

Baier taught at the University of Melbourne and the [[Australian National University]]. He met and married [[Annette Baier]] in 1958.&lt;ref name=Otago&gt;{{cite web|title=Kurt Baier|url=http://www.otago.ac.nz/philosophy/Baier.pdf|work=University of Otago|accessdate=5 May 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110309150723/http://www.otago.ac.nz/philosophy/Baier.pdf|archivedate=9 March 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He joined the faculty of the [[University of Pittsburgh]] in 1961, and became Chair of the Department in 1967, and remained at Pitt until his retirement in 1996.&lt;ref name=PPGobit /&gt; He became president of the Eastern Division and chair of the National Board of Officers of the [[American Philosophical Association]], Both Baiers gave the [[Paul Carus lectures]]. He was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1974.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780-2010: Chapter B|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterB.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=5 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, Kurt was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Jurisprudence from the [[University of Graz|Karl Franzen University of Graz]]. He was also honored by the Humanist Society.

Baier died at his home in [[Dunedin]], New Zealand.&lt;ref name=PPGobit /&gt;

==Philosophical work==

Beginning with his first and best known book, ''The Moral Point of View'' (1958), Baier has been attempting to construct a justification of [[morality]] that is grounded in [[rationality]]. His original strategy was to find certain nonquestion-begging requirements of practical reason that then could be shown to favor morality over [[egotism|egoism]]. According to Baier, the very raison d'être of a morality is to yield reasons that overrule the reasons of self-interest in those cases when everyone following their own self-interest would be harmful to everyone.	If we appeal to self-interested reasons to be moral, it would seem that such reasons cannot support morality over self-interest in cases of conflict. On the other hand, if we appeal to non-self-interested reasons to justify morality, those reasons seem to be implicitly moral, and so this would just be begging the question against egoistic opponents of morality. While making many contributions to the conceptual analysis of basic concepts in moral, political and legal philosophy such as those of obligation, responsibility, reason for action, egoism and the meaning of life, and also to applied ethics. Baier has struggled with the fundamental question of how to justify morality throughout his career. He inspired many other philosophers to do so as well.

In ''The Rational and the Moral Order'' (1995), Baier attempted to answer the question by interpreting morality as a system of reasons of mutual benefit that are appropriate for contexts in which everyone's following self-interested reasons would have suboptimal results for everyone. So interpreted, moral reasons apply only when there exists an adequate enforcement system that makes acting against those reasons unprofitable. Morality so construed never requires any degree of altruism or self-sacrifice; it only requires that people act upon reasons of mutual benefit. Given this interpretation of morality, it is not possible for the egoist to do better by acting against morality. So construed, morality and egoism do not really conflict. This solution to the problem of the justification of morality bears some resemblance to the one offered by [[David Gauthier]] in ''Morals By Agreement'' (1986), a philosopher who was also inspired by Baier’s work and who later joined Baier as a colleague at the University of Pittsburgh in 1980.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6977">'''Levels of edit''' (or '''levels of editing''') describes a cumulative or categorical scheme for revising text. Beginning as a tool that helped standardize communication between writers and editors at a government laboratory, published information about levels of edit was later made available to the general public. Subsequently, others developed a variety of levels of edit, which are now accessible through print and web-based resources.

== History ==
Van Buren and Buehler of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) developed five levels of edit defined by nine editorial categories.
# Coordination: Consider version and circulation, Consider the review cycles
# Policy: Consider the organizational structure
# Integrity: Are sources noted? 
# Screening: Consider spelling. Are visuals/art presented with clarity?
# Copy clarification: Are images legible? Are images trimmed?
# Format: What are the layout conventions?  What are the typographical conventions?
# Mechanical style: Check spelling and usage.
# Language: Make edits for clarity and concision.
# Substantive
In 1976, JPL first published Van Buren and Buehler's work as The Levels of Edit.&lt;ref name=buren1980&gt;Van Buren, R., and M .F. Buehler. 1980. ''The Levels of Edit'', Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Pasadena: California Institute of Technology.&lt;/ref&gt; JPL published a second edition in 1980, and the [[US Government Printing Office|United States Government Printing Office]] (GPO) sold copies of the book to the general public. After the GPO’s supply of the second edition was depleted, the [[Society for Technical Communication]] (STC) made available a facsimile reprint of the second edition.

Drawing on Van Buren and Buehler’s work, in 1985 the writing and editing group at the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] established four levels of edit for technical reports. A team at the laboratory revised the work following a 1994 survey that indicated the original four levels no longer met authors’ needs. The Los Alamos revision presented three “author-based” levels of edit (proofreading edit, grammar edit, and full edit) whose goals were to “simplify the editing process, focus editing on improving technical clarity, and ensure that value was added in editing.”&lt;ref name=prono1998&gt;Prono, J., DeLanoy, M., Deupree, R., Skiby, J., and B. Thompson. 1998. “Developing New Levels of Edit,” Los Alamos, NM: Los Alamos National Laboratory.&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, Rude reduced the levels to just two types: 1) comprehensive editing and 2) copyediting.&lt;ref name=rude2006&gt;Rude, C. D. 2006. ''Technical Editing'' (4th ed.), New York: Pearson Longman.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Several chapters in New Perspectives on Technical Editing, edited by Avon J. Murphy,&lt;ref name=murphy2010&gt;Murphy, A.J. (Ed.) 2010. ''New Perspectives on Technical Editing'', Amityville, New York: Baywood Publishing Company, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; include discussions of the different types of edits.

Other researchers built schemes based on editing rules, tasks, and analyses. For example, Tarutz defined a hierarchy of levels&lt;ref name=tarutz1992&gt;Tarutz, J. 1992. ''Technical Editing: The Practical Guide for Editors and Writers''. Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley.&lt;/ref&gt; that Corbin and Oestreich referred to in their presentation at the 2011 STC Summit&lt;ref name=corbin2011&gt;Corbin, M. and L. Oestreich. 2011. “Editing: Reviewing Levels and Choosing Types.” Presented at the 58th annual conference of the Society for Technical Communication, Technical Communication Summit, Sacramento, CA.&lt;/ref&gt; as “informal,” as follows.

# Turning pages (a superficial look of the text)
# Skimming (correcting obvious errors of spelling, grammar, and punctuation)
# Skimming and comparing (seeking internal consistency, including cross-references)
# Reading (improving writing style, such as wording and usage)
# Analyzing (identifying and fixing organizational flaws, missing information, redundancy, and technical inconsistency)
# Testing and using (fixing technical errors and resolving usability problems)


To bring a quality assurance perspective to technical editing, Corbin and others mapped types of edit to types of testing, for example, “system testing to comprehensive editing” and “function testing to copyediting” (p.&amp;nbsp;290).&lt;ref name=corbin2002&gt;Corbin, M., Moell, P., and M. Boyd. 2002. “Technical Editing As Quality Assurance: Adding Value to Content.” ''Technical Communication'', 49 (3): 286-300.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other variations ==
As web-based on-demand proofreading and editing services have become increasingly available, the number of edit levels and editing schemes has increased in variety. For example, three cumulative levels is a common scheme, typically 1) light, 2) medium, and 3) heavy editing, although another three-level scheme appears frequently across websites: 1) proofreading and 2) light and 3) heavy editing. Four levels usually differs from a three-level scheme only by the inclusion of a mid-range level, such as 1) basic proofreading and 2) light, 3) medium, and 4) heavy editing.&lt;ref name=dr2010&gt;dr. edit®. 2010-2011. Online: [http://www.dr-edit.com www.dr-edit.com]. Irvine, CA.&lt;/ref&gt; No matter the scheme, a level of edit defined as heavy often results in a complete rewrite. And one web-based service offers six levels of edit according to a partially cumulative scheme:
# Basic proofreading
# Complete editing without comments
# Complete editing with comments

==Early life and education==

Marcus Feldman was born and raised in [[Perth]], [[Australia]]. His father Simon Feldman was an engineer, and this inspired him to take up mathematics. He studied at the [[University of Western Australia]] from where he [[matriculated]] in 1959, and [[Graduation|graduated]] (with majors in mathematics and statistics) in 1964. In 1966 he obtained Master of Science degree in mathematics from [[Monash University]]. He went abroad to US to join a PhD programme at Stanford University. He earned his degree in 1969 under the supervision of [[Samuel Karlin]] in the Department of Mathematics. Karlin influenced him to pursue his research in [[population genetics]] using his computational know-how.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author= |title= Marc Feldman|date= | url= http://www.santafe.edu/about/people/profile/Marc%20Feldman |work= santafe.edu |publisher=Santa Fe Institute |accessdate= 3 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional career==

After a brief work at Stanford as a Research Assistant for Karlin, and as Acting Assistant Professor in the Department of Biology, Feldman returned to Australia to join at [[La Trobe University]] as a Lecturer of mathematics. In 1971 he was appointed as Assistant Professor in the Department of Biological Sciences at Stanford, and went back to US. With [[L.L. Cavalli-Sforza]] in 1973, he originated the quantitative theory of cultural evolution, initiating a research program in cultural transmission and gene-culture [[coevolution]]. His own research into human molecular evolution such as in [[China]] led him to international recognition. He is the author of more than 500 scientific papers and several books on evolution, ecology, and mathematical biology. 

In addition, he is the founding editor of ''[[Theoretical Population Biology]]'' (1971-2013) and an associate editor of ''[[Genetics (journal)|Genetics]]'', ''[[Human Genetics (journal)|Human Genetics]]'', ''[[Annals of Human Genetics]]'', ''[[Annals of Human Biology]]'', and ''[[Complexity (journal)|Complexity]]''. He was the editor of ''[[The American Naturalist]]'' from 1984 to 1990. He was a Member of Board of Trustees at the [[Santa Fe Institute]] from 1984 to 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author= |title= Vita: MARCUS WILLIAM FELDMAN|date=2013 | url= http://www-evo.stanford.edu/Feldman-cv.pdf |work= www-evo.stanford.edu |publisher= Department of Biology, Stanford University |accessdate= 3 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Maria Tecla Artemisia Montessori''' ({{IPA-it|maˈriːa montesˈsɔːri}}; August 31, 1870 – May 6, 1952) was an [[Italy|Italian]] physician and educator best known for the [[Montessori education|philosophy of education that bears her name]], and her writing on scientific [[pedagogy]]. At an early age, Montessori broke gender barriers and expectations when she enrolled in classes at an all-boys technical school, with hopes of becoming an engineer. She soon had a change of heart and began medical school at the [[Sapienza University of Rome|University of Rome]], where she graduated – with honors – in 1896. Her educational method is in use today in many public and private schools throughout the world.

==Life and career==

===Birth and family===
[[File:Lire 1000 (Maria Montessori).jpg|thumb|250px|Italian 1000 Lire banknote (approx. 0.52 €) representing Maria Montessori.]]

Montessori was born on August 31, 1870 in [[Chiaravalle, Marche|Chiaravalle]], Italy.  Her father, Alessandro Montessori, 33 years old at the time, was an official of the Ministry of Finance working in the local state-run tobacco factory.  Her mother, Renilde Stoppani, 25 years old, was well educated for the times and was the great-niece of Italian geologist and paleontologist [[Antonio Stoppani]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Highlights from 'Communications 2007/1' |url=http://www.montessori-ami.org/communications/commun2007_1.htm |publisher=Association Montessori Internationale |accessdate=May 2, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071214125212/http://www.montessori-ami.org/communications/commun2007_1.htm|archivedate=December 14, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kramer, 24;  Trabalzini, 13&lt;/ref&gt; While she did not have any particular mentor, she was very close to her mother who readily encouraged her. She also had a loving relationship with her father, although he disagreed with her choice to continue her education.&lt;ref name="Flaherty"&gt;Flaherty, T.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1883–1896: Education===

====Early education====
The Montessori family moved to Florence in 1873 and then to Rome in 1875 because of her father's work.  Montessori entered a public elementary school at the age of 6 in 1876.  Her early school record was "not particularly noteworthy",&lt;ref&gt;Trabalzini 7&lt;/ref&gt; although she was awarded certificates for good behavior in the 1st grade and for "lavori donneschi", or "women's work", the next year.&lt;ref&gt;Kramer 27&lt;/ref&gt;

====Secondary school====
In 1883&lt;ref&gt;Kramer 31&lt;/ref&gt; or 1884,&lt;ref&gt;Trabalzini 8&lt;/ref&gt; at the age of 13, Montessori entered a secondary, technical school, Regia Scuola Tecnica Michelangelo Buonarroti, where she studied Italian, arithmetic, algebra, geometry, accounting, history, geography, and sciences.  She graduated in 1886 with good grades and examination results. That year, at the age of 16, she continued at the technical institute Regio Istituto Tecnico Leonardo da Vinci, studying Italian, mathematics, history, geography, geometric and ornate drawing, physics, chemistry, botany, zoology, and two foreign languages.  She did well in the sciences and especially in mathematics.

She initially intended to pursue the study of engineering upon graduation, an unusual aspiration for a woman in her time and place. However, by the time she graduated in 1890 at the age of 20, with a certificate in physics–mathematics, she had decided to study medicine instead, an even more unlikely pursuit given cultural norms at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Kramer 32–33; Trabalzini 7–8&lt;/ref&gt;

====University of Rome—Medical school====
Montessori moved forward with her intention to study medicine.  She appealed to Guido Baccelli, the professor of clinical medicine at the [[Sapienza University of Rome|University of Rome]], but was strongly discouraged. Nonetheless, in 1890, she enrolled in the University of Rome in a degree course in natural sciences, passing examinations in botany, zoology, experimental physics, histology, anatomy, and general and organic chemistry, and earning her ''diploma di licenza'' in 1892. This degree, along with additional studies in Italian and Latin, qualified her for entrance into the medical program at the University in 1893.&lt;ref&gt;Kramer 34–35;  Trabalzini 9–10&lt;/ref&gt;

She was met with hostility and harassment from some medical students and professors because of her gender.  Because her attendance of classes with men in the presence of a naked body was deemed inappropriate, she was required to perform her dissections of cadavers alone, after hours. She resorted to smoking [[tobacco]] to mask the offensive odor of [[formaldehyde]].&lt;ref&gt;Kramer 40–41&lt;/ref&gt;  Montessori won an academic prize in her first year, and in 1895 secured a position as a hospital assistant, gaining early clinical experience.  In her last two years she studied [[pediatrics]] and [[psychiatry]], and worked in the pediatric consulting room and emergency service, becoming an expert in pediatric medicine. Montessori graduated from the University of Rome in 1896 as a doctor of medicine. Her thesis was published in 1897 in the journal ''Policlinico''.  She found employment as an assistant at the University hospital and started a private practice.&lt;ref&gt;Kramer 47–50&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Montessori is often described as the first woman doctor in Italy, but in fact Ernestina Paper earned a medical degree in Florence in 1877 and practiced medicine beginning in 1878. (Trabalzini 14)&lt;/ref&gt;)

===1896–1901: Early career and family===
From 1896 to 1901, Montessori worked with and researched so-called "phrenasthenic" children—in modern terms, children experiencing some form of mental retardation, illness, or disability.  She also began to travel, study, speak, and publish nationally and internationally, coming to prominence as an advocate for women's rights and education for mentally disabled children.&lt;ref&gt;Kramer 52–58;  Trabalzini 16–23&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 March 1898, her only child – a son named Mario Montessori (March 31, 1898 – 1982) was born.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sweetwatermontessori.com/Mario_Montessori.htm|title=Mario Montessori|publisher=Sweetwater Montessori School|accessdate=31 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mario Montessori was born out of her love affair with Giuseppe Montesano, a fellow doctor who was co-director with her of the Orthophrenic School of Rome.  If Montessori married, she would be expected to cease working professionally; instead of getting married, Montessori decided to continue her work and studies. Montessori wanted to keep the relationship with her child's father secret under the condition that neither of them would marry anyone else. When the father of her child fell in love and subsequently married, Montessori was left feeling betrayed and decided to leave the university hospital and place her son into foster care with a family living in the countryside opting to miss the first few years of his life. She would later be reunited with her son in his teenage years, where he proved to be a great assistant in her research.&lt;ref name="Flaherty" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.feministvoices.com/maria-montessori/|title=Maria Montessori|publisher=[[Psychology's Feminist Voices]]|first=Laura|last=Ball|accessdate=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Work with mentally disabled children====
After graduating from the University of Rome in 1896, Montessori continued with her research at the University's psychiatric clinic, and in 1897 she was accepted as a voluntary assistant there.  As part of her work, she visited [[History of psychiatric institutions|asylums]] in Rome where she observed children with mental disabilities, observations which were fundamental to her future educational work.  She also read and studied the works of 19th-century physicians and educators [[Jean Marc Gaspard Itard]] and [[Édouard Séguin]], who greatly influenced her work. Maria was intrigued by Itard's ideas and created a far more specific and organized system for applying them to the everyday education of children with disabilities. When she discovered the works of Jean Itard and Édouard Séguin they gave her a new direction in thinking and influenced her to focus on children with learning difficulties. Also in 1897, Montessori audited the University courses in pedagogy and read "all the major works on educational theory of the past two hundred years".&lt;ref&gt;Kramer 58–61;  Standing 28;  Trabalzini 16–17&lt;/ref&gt;

====Public advocacy====
In 1897 Montessori spoke on societal responsibility for juvenile delinquency at the National Congress of Medicine in Turin. In 1898, she wrote several articles and spoke again at the First Pedagogical Conference of Turin, urging the creation of special classes and institutions for mentally disabled children, as well as teacher training for their instructors.&lt;ref&gt;Trabalzini 18–19; Kramer 73&lt;/ref&gt; In 1899 Montessori was appointed a councilor to the newly formed National League for the Protection of Retarded Children, and was invited to lecture on special methods of education for retarded children at the teacher training school of the College of Rome. That year Montessori undertook a two-week national lecture tour to capacity audiences before prominent public figures.&lt;ref&gt;Kramer 78&lt;/ref&gt;  She joined the board of the National League and was appointed as a lecturer in hygiene and anthropology at one of the two teacher-training colleges for women in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Kramer 84–85&lt;/ref&gt;

====Orthophrenic School====
In 1900 the National League opened the ''Scuola Magistrale Ortofrenica'', or Orthophrenic School, a "medico-pedagogical institute" for training teachers in educating mentally disabled children with an attached laboratory classroom. Montessori was appointed co-director.&lt;ref&gt;Kramer 86;  Trabalzini 21&lt;/ref&gt;  64 teachers enrolled in the first class, studying psychology, anatomy and physiology of the nervous system, anthropological measurements, causes and characteristics of mental disability, and special methods of instruction.  During her two years at the school, Montessori developed methods and materials which she would later adapt to use with mainstream children.&lt;ref&gt;Kramer 90&lt;/ref&gt;

The school was an immediate success, attracting the attention of government officials from the departments of education and health, civic leaders, and prominent figures in the fields of education, psychiatry, and anthropology from the University of Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Kramer 87&lt;/ref&gt;  The children in the model classroom were drawn from ordinary schools but considered "uneducable" due to their deficiencies.  Some of these children later passed public examinations given to so-called "normal" children.&lt;ref&gt;Kramer 91;  Trabalzini 23–24&lt;/ref&gt;

===1901–1906: Further studies===
In 1901, Montessori left the Orthophrenic School and her private practice, and in 1902 she enrolled in the philosophy degree course at the University of Rome.  (Philosophy at the time included much of what we now consider psychology.) She studied theoretical and moral philosophy, the history of philosophy, and psychology as such, but she did not graduate. She also pursued independent study in anthropology and educational philosophy, conducted observations and experimental research in elementary schools, and revisited the work of Itard and Séguin, translating their books into handwritten Italian. During this time she began to consider adapting her methods of educating mentally disabled children to mainstream education.&lt;ref&gt;Kramer 92, 94–95; Trabalzini 39&lt;/ref&gt;

Montessori's work developing what she would later call "scientific pedagogy" continued over the next few years. Still in 1902, Montessori presented a report at a second national pedagogical congress in Naples. She published two articles on pedagogy in 1903, and two more the following year. In 1903 and 1904, she conducted anthropological research with Italian schoolchildren, and in 1904 she was qualified as a free lecturer in anthropology for the University of Rome.  She was appointed to lecture in the Pedagogic School at the University and continued in the position until 1908.  Her lectures were printed as a book titled ''Pedagogical Anthropology'' in 1910.&lt;ref&gt;Kramer 95–97; Trabalzini 39–41&lt;/ref&gt;

===1906–1911: ''Casa dei Bambini'' and the spread of Montessori's ideas===

====The first ''Casa''====
In 1906 Montessori was invited to oversee the care and education of a group of children of working parents in a new apartment building for low-income families in the [[Quartiere San Lorenzo|San Lorenzo district]] in Rome. Montessori was interested in applying her work and methods to mentally normal children, and she accepted.&lt;ref&gt;Kramer 110; Trabalzini 49, 52&lt;/ref&gt; The name ''Casa dei Bambini'', or Children's House, was suggested to Montessori, and the first ''Casa'' opened on January 6, 1907, enrolling 50 or 60 children between the ages of two or three and six or seven.&lt;ref&gt;Kramer 111&lt;/ref&gt;

At first, the classroom was equipped with a teacher's table and blackboard, a stove, small chairs, armchairs, and group tables for the children, and a locked cabinet for the materials that Montessori had developed at the Orthophrenic School.  Activities for the children included personal care such as dressing and undressing, care of the environment such as dusting and sweeping, and caring for the garden.  The children were also shown the use of the materials Montessori had developed.&lt;ref&gt;Trabalzini 53&lt;/ref&gt; Montessori herself, occupied with teaching, research, and other professional activities, oversaw and observed the classroom work, but did not teach the children directly. Day-to-day teaching and care were provided, under Montessori's guidance, by the building porter's daughter.&lt;ref&gt;Kramer 111–112&lt;/ref&gt;

In this first classroom, Montessori observed behaviors in these young children which formed the foundation of her educational method.  She noted episodes of deep attention and concentration, multiple repetitions of activity, and a sensitivity to order in the environment.  Given free choice of activity, the children showed more interest in practical activities and Montessori's materials than in toys provided for them, and were surprisingly unmotivated by sweets and other rewards.  Over time, she saw a spontaneous self-discipline emerge.&lt;ref&gt;Kramer 113–116; Trabalzini 40–47&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on her observations, Montessori implemented a number of practices that became hallmarks of her educational philosophy and method.  She replaced the heavy furniture with child-sized tables and chairs light enough for the children to move, and placed child-sized materials on low, accessible shelves. She expanded the range of practical activities such as sweeping and personal care to include a wide variety of exercises for care of the environment and the self, including flower arranging, hand washing, gymnastics, care of pets, and cooking.&lt;ref name="kramert"&gt;Kramer 115–121; Trabalzini 54–56&lt;/ref&gt; She also included large open air sections in the classroom encouraging children to come and go as they please in the room's different areas and lessons. In her book &lt;ref name="Montessori"&gt;Montessori, M.&lt;/ref&gt; she outlines a typical winter's day of lessons, starting at 09:00&amp;nbsp;AM and finishing at 04:00&amp;nbsp;PM:

*9–10. Entrance. Greeting. Inspection as to personal cleanliness. Exercises of practical life; helping one another to take off and put on the aprons. Going over the room to see that everything is dusted and in order. Language: Conversation period: Children give an account of the events of the day before. Religious exercises.
*10–11. Intellectual exercises. Objective lessons interrupted by short rest periods. Nomenclature, Sense exercises.
*11–11:30. Simple gymnastics: Ordinary movements done gracefully, normal position of the body, walking, marching in line, salutations, movements for attention, placing of objects gracefully.
*11:30–12. Luncheon: Short prayer.
*12–1. Free games.
*1–2. Directed games, if possible, in the open air. During this period the older children in turn go through with the exercises of practical life, cleaning the room, dusting, putting the material in order. General inspection for cleanliness: Conversation.
*2–3. Manual work. Clay modelling, design, etc.
*3–4. Collective gymnastics and songs, if possible in the open air. Exercises to develop forethought: Visiting, and caring for, the plants and animals.

She felt by working independently children could reach new levels of autonomy and become self-motivated to reach new levels of understanding. Montessori also came to believe that acknowledging all children as individuals and treating them as such would yield better learning and fulfilled potential in each particular child.&lt;ref name="Montessori" /&gt;
She continued to adapt and refine the materials she had developed earlier, altering or removing exercises which were chosen less frequently by the children.  Also based on her observations, Montessori experimented with allowing children free choice of the materials, uninterrupted work, and freedom of movement and activity within the limits set by the environment.  She began to see independence as the aim of education, and the role of the teacher as an observer and director of children's innate psychological development.&lt;ref name="kramert"/&gt;

====Spread of Montessori education in Italy====
The first ''Casa dei Bambini'' was a success, and a second was opened on April 7, 1907.  The children in her programs continued to exhibit concentration, attention, and spontaneous self-discipline, and the classrooms began to attract the attention of prominent educators, journalists, and public figures.&lt;ref&gt;Kramer 123–125; Standing 53–54; Trabalzini 56&lt;/ref&gt; In the fall of 1907, Montessori began to experiment with teaching materials for writing and reading—letters cut from sandpaper and mounted on boards, moveable cutout letters, and picture cards with labels.  Four- and five-year-old children engaged spontaneously with the materials and quickly gained a proficiency in writing and reading far beyond what was expected for their age.  This attracted further public attention to Montessori's work.&lt;ref&gt;Kramer 126–131; Standing  47–50&lt;/ref&gt; Three more Case dei Bambini opened in 1908, and in 1909 Italian Switzerland began to replace [[Friedrich Fröbel|Froebellian]] methods with Montessori in orphanages and kindergartens.&lt;ref&gt;Kramer 135–136&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1909, Montessori held the first teacher training course in her new method in [[Città di Castello]], Italy.  In the same year, she described her observations and methods in a book titled ''Il Metodo della Pedagogia Scientifica Applicato All'Educazione Infantile Nelle Case Dei Bambini'' (''The Method of Scientific Pedagogy Applied to the Education of Children in the Children's Houses'').&lt;ref&gt;Kramer 137 ; Trabalzini 57&lt;/ref&gt; Two more training courses were held in Rome in 1910, and a third in Milan in 1911. Montessori's reputation and work began to spread internationally as well, and around that time she gave up her medical practice to devote more time to her educational work, developing her methods and training teachers.&lt;ref&gt;Kramer 147, 150, 155; Standing  58–61; Trabalzini 103–104&lt;/ref&gt; In 1919 she resigned from her position at the University of Rome, as her educational work was increasingly absorbing all her time and interest.

===1909–1915: International recognition and growth of Montessori education===
As early as 1909, Montessori's work began to attract the attention of international observers and visitors. Her work was widely published internationally, and spread rapidly. By the end of 1911, Montessori education had been officially adopted in public schools in Italy and Switzerland, and was planned for the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Kramer 155&lt;/ref&gt; By 1912, Montessori schools had opened in Paris and many other Western European cities, and were planned for Argentina, Australia, China, India, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Switzerland, Syria, the United States, and New Zealand.  Public programs in London, Johannesburg, Rome, and Stockholm had adopted the method in their school systems.&lt;ref&gt;Kramer 176&lt;/ref&gt; Montessori societies were founded in the United States (the Montessori American Committee) and the United Kingdom (the Montessori Society for the United Kingdom).&lt;ref&gt;Kramer 172, 155&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1913 the first International Training Course was held in Rome, with a second in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;Trabalzini 107–108&lt;/ref&gt;

Montessori's work was widely translated and published during this period.  ''Il Metodo della Pedagogia Scientifica'' was published in the United States as ''The Montessori Method: Scientific Pedagogy as Applied to Child Education in the Children's Houses'', where it became a best seller.&lt;ref name="Kramer"&gt;Kramer 167&lt;/ref&gt; British and Swiss editions followed.  A revised Italian edition was published in 1913.  Russian and Polish editions came out in 1913 as well, and German, Japanese, and Romanian editions appeared in 1914, followed by Spanish (1915), Dutch (1916), and Danish (1917) editions.  ''Pedagogical Anthropology'' was published in English in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;Trabalzini 106–107&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1914, Montessori published, in English, ''Doctor Montessori's Own Handbook'', a practical guide to the didactic materials she had developed.&lt;ref&gt;Kramer 174; Trabalzini 103–104&lt;/ref&gt;

====Montessori in the United States====
{{Main|Montessori in the United States}}

In 1911 and 1912, Montessori's work was popular and widely publicized in the United States, especially in a series of articles in ''[[McClure's|McClure's Magazine]]'', and the first North American Montessori school was opened in October 1911, in [[Tarrytown, New York]].  The inventor [[Alexander Graham Bell]] and his wife became proponents of the method and a second school was opened in their Canadian home.&lt;ref&gt;Kramer 159, 162–5&lt;/ref&gt;  ''The Montessori Method''  sold quickly through six editions.&lt;ref name="Kramer" /&gt; The first International Training Course in Rome in 1913 was sponsored by  the American Montessori Committee, and 67 of the 83 students were from the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Kramer 172&lt;/ref&gt; By 1913 there were more than 100 Montessori schools in the country.&lt;ref&gt;Kramer 181&lt;/ref&gt;  Montessori traveled to the United States in December 1913 on a three-week lecture tour which included films of her European classrooms, meeting with large, enthusiastic crowds wherever she traveled.&lt;ref&gt;Kramer 186–202&lt;/ref&gt;

Montessori returned to the United States in 1915, sponsored by the [[National Education Association]], to demonstrate her work at the [[Panama–Pacific International Exposition]] in San Francisco, California, and to give a third international training course.  A glass-walled classroom was put up at the Exposition, and thousands of observers came to see a class of 21 students.  Montessori's father died in November 1915, and she returned to Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Kramer 212–215&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Montessori and her educational approach were highly popular in the United States, she was not without opposition and controversy.  Influential progressive educator [[William Heard Kilpatrick]], a follower of American philosopher and educational reformer [[John Dewey]], wrote a dismissive and critical book titled ''The Montessori Method Examined'', which had a broad impact. The National Kindergarten Association was critical as well.  Critics charged that Montessori's method was outdated, overly rigid, overly reliant on sense-training, and left too little scope for imagination, social interaction, and play.&lt;ref&gt;Kramer 227–229&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, Montessori's insistence on tight control over the elaboration of her method, the training of teachers, the production and use of materials, and the establishment of schools became a source of conflict and controversy.  After she left in 1915, the Montessori movement in the United States fragmented, and Montessori education was a negligible factor in education in the United States until 1952.&lt;ref&gt;Kramer 230–231&lt;/ref&gt;

===1915–1939: Further development of Montessori education===
In 1915, Montessori returned to Europe and took up residence in [[Barcelona]], Spain.  Over the next 20 years Montessori traveled and lectured widely in Europe and gave numerous teacher training courses.  Montessori education experienced significant growth in Spain, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and Italy.

====Spain (1915–1936)====
On her return from the United States, Montessori continued her work in Barcelona, where a small program sponsored by the Catalan government begun in 1915 had developed into the Escola Montessori, serving children from three to ten years old, and the Laboratori i Seminari de Pedagogia, a research, training, and teaching institute.  A fourth international course was given there in 1916, including materials and methods, developed over the previous five years, for teaching grammar, arithmetic, and geometry to elementary school children from six to twelve years of age.&lt;ref&gt;Kramer 246–250&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1917 Montessori published her elementary work in ''L'autoeducazionne nelle Scuole Elementari (Self-Education in Elementary School)'', which appeared in English as ''The Advanced Montessori Method''.&lt;ref&gt;Kramer 249–250; Trabalzini 119–120&lt;/ref&gt;  Around 1920, the [[Catalan independence]] movement began to demand that Montessori take a political stand and make a public statement favoring Catalan independence, and she refused.  Official support was withdrawn from her programs.&lt;ref&gt;Kramer 269–270&lt;/ref&gt; In 1924, a new military dictatorship closed Montessori's model school in Barcelona, and Montessori education declined in Spain, although Barcelona remained Montessori's home for the next twelve years. In 1933, under the [[Second Spanish Republic]], a new training course was sponsored by the government, and government support was re-established. In 1934, she published two books in Spain, ''Psicogeometrica'' and ''Psicoarithemetica''.&lt;ref&gt;Trabalzini 160&lt;/ref&gt;  However, with the onset of the [[Spanish Civil War]] in 1936, political and social conditions drove Montessori to leave Spain permanently.&lt;ref&gt;Kramer 331–333&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Netherlands (1917–1936)====
In 1917,  Montessori lectured in [[Amsterdam]], and the Netherlands Montessori Society was founded.&lt;ref&gt;Kramer 251&lt;/ref&gt;   She returned in 1920 to give a series of lectures at the [[University of Amsterdam]].&lt;ref&gt;Kramer 267&lt;/ref&gt;  Montessori programs flourished in the Netherlands, and by the mid-1930s there were more than 200 Montessori schools in the country.&lt;ref&gt;Kramer 323&lt;/ref&gt;   In  1935 the headquarters of the [[Association Montessori Internationale]], or AMI, moved permanently to Amsterdam.&lt;ref&gt;Kramer 305&lt;/ref&gt;

====The United Kingdom (1919–1936)====
Montessori education was met with enthusiasm and controversy in England between 1912 and 1914.&lt;ref&gt;Kramer 235–245&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1919, Montessori came to England for the first time and gave an international training course which was received with high interest.  Montessori education continued to spread in the United Kingdom, although the movement experienced some of the struggles over authenticity and fragmentation that took place in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Kramer 272&lt;/ref&gt;  Montessori continued to give training courses in England every other year until the beginning of World War II.&lt;ref&gt;Kramer 294&lt;/ref&gt;

====Italy (1922–1934)====
In 1922, Montessori was invited to Italy on behalf of the government to give a course of lectures and later to inspect Italian Montessori schools.  Later that year [[Benito Mussolini]]'s Fascist government came to power in Italy. In December, Montessori came back to Italy to plan a series of annual training courses under government sponsorship, and in 1923, the minister of education [[Giovanni Gentile]] expressed his official support for Montessori schools and teacher training.&lt;ref&gt;Kramer 280–281&lt;/ref&gt; In 1924 Montessori met with Mussolini, who extended his official support for Montessori education as part of the national program.&lt;ref&gt;Kramer 282; Trabalzini  127&lt;/ref&gt;  A pre-war group of Montessori supporters, the Societa gli Amici del Metodo Montessori (Society of Friends of the Montessori Method) became the Opera Montessori (Montessori Society) with a government charter, and by 1926 Mussolini was made honorary president of the organization.&lt;ref&gt;Kramer 283, 285&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1927 Mussolini established a Montessori teacher training college, and by 1929 the Italian government supported a wide range of Montessori institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Kramer 302–304&lt;/ref&gt; However, from 1930 on, Montessori and the Italian government came into conflict over financial support and ideological issues, especially after Montessori's lectures on Peace and Education.&lt;ref&gt;Kramer 326; Trabalzini  156–7&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1932 she and her son Mario were placed under political surveillance.&lt;ref&gt;Trabalzini  158&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, in 1933, she resigned from the Opera Montessori, and in 1934 she left Italy.  The Italian government ended Montessori activities in the country in 1936.&lt;ref&gt;Trabalzini 158–160&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other countries====
Montessori lectured in [[Vienna]] in 1923, and her lectures were published as ''Il Bambino in Famiglia'', published in English in 1936 as ''The Child in the Family''. Between 1913 and 1936 Montessori schools and societies were also established in France, Germany, Switzerland, Belgium, Russia, Serbia, Canada, India, China, Japan, Indonesia, Australia, and New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;Kramer 246; Standing 64&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Association Montessori Internationale====
In 1929, the first International Montessori Congress was held in [[Elsinore]], Denmark, in conjunction with the Fifth Conference of the New Education Fellowship.  At this event, Montessori and her son Mario founded the [[Association Montessori Internationale]] or AMI "to oversee the activities of schools and societies all over the world and to supervise the training of teachers."&lt;ref&gt;Kramer  305–306&lt;/ref&gt; AMI also controlled rights to the publication of Montessori's works and the production of authorized Montessori didactic materials. Early sponsors of the AMI included [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Jean Piaget]], and [[Rabindranath Tagore]].&lt;ref&gt;Kramer 311&lt;/ref&gt;

====Peace====
In 1932, Montessori spoke on Peace and Education at the Second International Montessori Congress in [[Nice]], France; this lecture was published by the Bureau International d'Education, [[Geneva]], Switzerland. In 1932, Montessori spoke at the International Peace Club in Geneva, Switzerland, on the theme of Peace and Education.&lt;ref&gt;Trabalzini 157&lt;/ref&gt;  Montessori held peace conferences from 1932 to 1939 in Geneva, [[Brussels]], [[Copenhagen]], and [[Utrecht]], which were later published in Italian as ''Educazione e Pace'', and in English as ''Education and Peace''.&lt;ref&gt;Kramer 330; Trabalzini 173&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949, and again in 1950 and in 1951, Montessori was nominated for the [[Nobel Peace Prize]], receiving a total of six nominations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/nomination/nomination.php?string=Maria+Montessori&amp;action=simplesearch&amp;submit.x=0&amp;submit.y=0| title = Nomination Database – Peace | publisher = [[Nobelprize.org]] | year = | accessdate = 2011-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Laren, the Netherlands (1936–1939)====
In 1936 Montessori and her family left Barcelona for England, and soon moved to [[Laren, North Holland|Laren]], near Amsterdam.  Montessori and her son Mario continued  to develop new materials here, including the knobless cylinders, the grammar symbols, and botany nomenclature cards.&lt;ref&gt;Kramer 337; Trabalzini  161&lt;/ref&gt;  In the context of rising military tensions in Europe, Montessori increasingly turned her attention to the theme of peace.  In 1937, the 6th International Montessori Congress was held on the theme of "Education for Peace", and Montessori called for a "science of peace" and spoke about the role of education of the child as a key to the reform of society.&lt;ref&gt;Kramer 339; Trabalzini 162&lt;/ref&gt; In 1938, Montessori was invited to India by the Theosophical Society to give a training course, and in 1939 she left the Netherlands with her son and collaborator Mario.&lt;ref&gt;Kramer 340–341; Trabalzini 165&lt;/ref&gt;

===1939–1946: Montessori in India===
{{main|Montessori in India}}
An interest in Montessori had existed in India since 1913, when an Indian student attended the first international course in Rome, and students throughout the 1920s and 1930s had come back to India to start schools and promote Montessori education.  The Montessori Society of India was formed in 1926, and ''Il Metodo'' was translated into [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] and [[Standard Hindi|Hindi]] in 1927.&lt;ref&gt;Kramer 342&lt;/ref&gt; By 1929, Indian poet [[Rabindranath Tagore]] had founded many "Tagore-Montessori" schools in India, and  Indian interest in Montessori education  was  strongly represented at the International Congress in 1929.&lt;ref&gt;Kramer 306–307&lt;/ref&gt; Montessori herself had been personally associated with the Theosophical Society since 1907.  The Theosophical movement, motivated to educate India's poor, was drawn to Montessori education as one solution.&lt;ref&gt;Kramer 341–342&lt;/ref&gt;

====Internment in India====
Montessori gave a training course at the [[Theosophical Society]] in [[Chennai|Madras]] in 1939, and had intended to give a tour of lectures at various universities, and then return to Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Trabalzini  165&lt;/ref&gt;  However, when Italy entered World War II on the side of the Germans in 1940, Britain interned all Italians in the United Kingdom and its colonies as enemy aliens.  In fact only Mario Montessori was interned, while Montessori herself was confined to the Theosophical Society compound, and Mario was reunited with his mother after two months.  The Montessoris remained in Madras and [[Kodaikanal]] until 1946, although they were allowed to travel in connection with lectures and courses.

====Elementary material, cosmic education, and birth to three====
During her years in India, Montessori and her son Mario continued to develop her educational method.  The term "cosmic education" was introduced to describe an approach for children aged from six to twelve years that emphasized the interdependence of all the elements of the natural world. Children worked directly with plants and animals in their natural environments, and the Montessoris developed lessons, illustrations, charts, and models for use with elementary aged children.  Material for botany, zoology, and geography was created.  Between 1942 and 1944 these elements were incorporated into an advanced course for work with children from six to twelve years old. This work led to two books:  ''Education for a New World'' and ''To Educate the Human Potential''.&lt;ref&gt;Kramer 345–346; Trabalzini  167–168&lt;/ref&gt;

While in India, Montessori observed children and adolescents of all ages, and turned to the study of infancy.  In 1944 she gave a series of thirty lectures on the first three years of life, and a government-recognized training course in Sri Lanka. These lectures were collected in 1949 in the book ''What You Should Know About Your Child''.&lt;ref&gt;Kramer 348; Trabalzini  168&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1944 the Montessoris were granted some freedom of movement and traveled to Sri Lanka.  In 1945 Montessori attended the first All India Montessori Conference in [[Jaipur]], and in 1946, with the war over, she and her family returned to Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Kramer 348&lt;/ref&gt;

===1946–1952: Final years===
In 1946, at the age of 76, Montessori returned to Amsterdam, but she spent the next six years travelling in Europe and India.  She gave a training course in London in 1946, and in 1947 opened a training institute there, the Montessori Centre. After a few years this centre became independent of Montessori and continued as the [[Montessori St Nicholas Charity|St. Nicholas Training Centre]]. Also in 1947, she returned to Italy to re-establish the Opera Montessori and gave two more training courses.  Later that year she returned to India and gave courses in [[Adyar (Chennai)|Adyar]] and [[Ahmedabad]].  These courses led to the book ''The Absorbent Mind'', in which Montessori described the development of the child from birth onwards and presented the concept of the Four Planes of Development.  In 1948 ''Il Metodo'' was revised again and published in English as ''The Discovery of the Child''. In 1949 she gave a course in Pakistan and the Montessori Pakistan Association was founded.&lt;ref&gt;Kramer 348–355; Trabalzini  169–170&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1949 Montessori returned to Europe and attended the 8th International Montessori Congress in [[Sanremo]], Italy, where a model classroom was demonstrated.  The same year, the first training course for birth to three years of age, called the Scuola Assistenti all'infanzia (Montessori School for Assistants to Infancy) was established.&lt;ref&gt;Trabalzini  170&lt;/ref&gt; She was nominated for the [[Nobel Peace Prize]].  Montessori was also awarded the French [[Legion of Honor]], Officer of the Dutch [[Order of Orange Nassau]], and received an Honorary Doctorate of the University of Amsterdam.  In 1950 she visited Scandinavia, represented Italy at the [[UNESCO]] conference in Florence, presented at the 29th international training course in [[Perugia]], gave a national course in Rome, published a fifth edition of ''Il Metodo'' with the new title ''La Scoperta del Bambino'' (''The Discovery of the Child''), and was again nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize.  In 1951 she participated  in the 9th International Montessori Congress in London, gave a training course in Innsbruck, was nominated for the third time for the Nobel Peace Prize.  Montessori died of a [[cerebral hemorrhage]] on May 6, 1952 at the age of 81 in [[Noordwijk aan Zee]], the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;Kramer 360–367; Trabalzini  170–172&lt;/ref&gt;

==Educational philosophy and pedagogy==
{{Main|Montessori education}}

===Early influences===
Montessori's theory and philosophy of education were initially heavily influenced by the work of [[Jean Marc Gaspard Itard]], [[Édouard Séguin]], [[Friedrich Fröbel]], and [[Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi]], all of whom emphasized sensory exploration and manipulatives.&lt;ref&gt;Kramer 59–67&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Montessori (1938), 17–23&lt;/ref&gt; Montessori's first work with mentally disabled children, at the Orthophrenic School in 1900–1901, used the methods of Itard and Séguin, training children in physical activities such as walking and the use of a spoon, training their senses by exposure to sights, smells, and tactile experiences, and introducing letters in tactile form.&lt;ref&gt;Kramer 76&lt;/ref&gt; These activities developed into the Montessori "Sensorial" materials.&lt;ref&gt;Lillard 16&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scientific pedagogy===
Montessori considered her work in the Orthophrenic School and her subsequent psychological studies and research work in elementary schools as "scientific pedagogy", a concept current in the study of education at the time. She called for not just observation and measurement of students, but for the development of new methods which would transform them. "Scientific education, therefore, was that which, while based on science, modified and improved the individual."&lt;ref&gt;Montessori (1938) 28&lt;/ref&gt; Further, education itself should be transformed by science: "The new methods if they were run on scientific lines, ought to change completely both the school and its methods, ought to give rise to a new form of education."&lt;ref&gt;Montessori (1938) 1–3, 28–29&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Casa dei Bambini''===
Working with non-disabled children in the ''Casa dei Bambini'' in 1907, Montessori began to develop her own pedagogy. The essential elements of her educational theory emerged from this work, described in ''The Montessori Method'' in 1912 and in ''The Discovery of the Child'' in 1948. Her method was founded on the observation of children at liberty to act freely in an environment prepared to meet their needs.&lt;ref&gt;Montessori (1938) 62&lt;/ref&gt; Montessori came to the conclusion that the children's spontaneous activity in this environment revealed an internal program of development, and that the appropriate role of the educator was to remove obstacles to this natural development and provide opportunities for it to proceed and flourish.&lt;ref&gt;Montessori (1938) 62, 76–77&lt;/ref&gt;

Accordingly, the schoolroom was equipped with child-sized furnishings, "practical life" activities such as sweeping and washing tables, and teaching material that Montessori had developed herself. Children were given freedom to choose and carry out their own activities, at their own paces and following their own inclinations. In these conditions, Montessori made a number of observations which became the foundation of her work. First, she observed great concentration in the children and spontaneous repetition of chosen activities. She also observed a strong tendency in the children to order their own environment, straightening tables and shelves and ordering materials. As children chose some activities over others, Montessori refined the materials she offered to them. Over time, the children began to exhibit what she called "spontaneous discipline".&lt;ref&gt;Montessori (1936) 126–138&lt;/ref&gt;

===Further development and Montessori education today===
Montessori continued to develop her pedagogy and her model of human development as she expanded her work and extended it to older children. She saw human behavior as guided by universal, innate characteristics in human psychology which her son and collaborator Mario Montessori identified as "human tendencies" in 1957. In addition, she observed four distinct periods, or "planes", in human development, extending from birth to six years, from six to twelve, from twelve to eighteen, and from eighteen to twenty-four. She saw different characteristics, learning modes, and developmental imperatives active in each of these planes, and called for educational approaches specific to each period. Over the course of her lifetime, Montessori developed pedagogical methods and materials for the first two planes, from birth to age twelve, and wrote and lectured about the third and fourth planes. Maria created over 4,000 Montessori classrooms across the world and her books were translated into many different languages for the training of new educators. Her methods are installed in hundreds of public and private schools across the United States.&lt;ref name="Lillard"&gt;Lillard, P. (1996).

==Montessori method==
{{Main|Montessori education}}

One of Montessori's many accomplishments was the [[Montessori method]]. This is a method of education for young children that stresses the development of a child's own initiative and natural abilities, especially through practical play. This method allowed children to develop at their own pace and provided educators with a new understanding of child development. Montessori's book, ''The Montessori Method'', presents the method in detail. Educators who followed this model set up special environments to meet the needs of students in three developmentally-meaningful age groups: 2–2.5 years, 2.5–6 years, and 6–12 years. The students learn through activities that involve exploration, manipulations, order, repetition, abstraction, and communication. Teachers encourage children in the first two age groups to use their senses to explore and manipulate materials in their immediate environment. Children in the last age group deal with abstract concepts based on their newly developed powers of reasoning, imagination, and creativity.&lt;ref name=" Hainstock "&gt;Hainstock, Elizabeth G. (1997).  ''The Essential Montessori:  An introduction to the woman, the writings, the method, and the movement''.  New York:  the Penguin Group.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
Montessori published a number of books, articles, and pamphlets during her lifetime, often in Italian, but sometimes first in English.  According to Kramer, "the major works published before 1920 (''The Montessori Method'', ''Pedagogical Anthropology'', ''The Advanced Montessori Method—Spontaneous Activity in Education and The Montessori Elementary Material''), were written in Italian by her and translated under her supervision."&lt;ref&gt;Kramer  356&lt;/ref&gt;  However, many of her later works were transcribed from her lectures, often in translation, and only later published in book form.

Montessori's major works are given here in order of their first publication, with significant revisions and translations.

'''Metaphysical solipsism''' is the variety of [[idealism]] which asserts that nothing exists externally to ''this one mind'', and since ''this mind'' is the whole of reality then the "external world" was never anything more than an ''idea''.  It can also be expressed by the assertion "there is nothing external to these present experiences", in other words, no reality exists beyond whatever is presently being sensed.  The aforementioned definition of solipsism entails the non-existence of anything presently unperceived including the external world, causation, other minds (including God's mind or a subconscious mind), the past or future, and a subject of experience.  Despite their ontological non-existence, these entities may nonetheless be said to "exist" as ''useful descriptions'' of the various experiences and thoughts that constitute 'this' mind.  The solipsistic self is described by Wittgenstein in the Tractatus: "The self of solipsism shrinks to a point without extension and there remains the reality co-ordinated with it" (''TLP'' 5.64).

There are weaker versions of metaphysical solipsism, such as Caspar Hare's [[egocentric presentism]] (or [[perspectival realism]]), in which other persons are conscious but their experiences are simply not ''present''. Similarly, J. J. Valberg develops a concept of one's [[personal horizon]] and discusses how it is in a sense ''the'' (preeminent) horizon, stating that "we are all solipsists" in his sense of solipsism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Valberg|first=J. J.|title=Dream, Death, and the Self|year=2007|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=9780691128597|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/8416.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arguments for metaphysical solipsism==

The argument in favor of solipsism:

* The only thing one has direct access to is the contents of one's own mind (one's mental states). What one knows most certainly are one's mental states – one's thoughts, experiences, emotions, and so on.
* Just because one sees an object does not mean that the object exists. One could be dreaming or hallucinating.  There is no direct conceptual or logically necessary link between the mental and the physical.
* The experiences of a given person are necessarily private to that person. The contents of one's mind are the only things one has direct access to. One cannot get ‘outside’ of one's mind to encounter any other objects including other persons. Other minds are even more removed.

The basic form of the argument:

* Person's mental states are the only things they have access to.
* One cannot conclude the existence of anything outside of their mental states.
** Therefore, only their mental states exist.
Similar philosophy is found in Hindu religion, namely [[drishti-srishti-vada]].&lt;ref name="Drishti-sristi-vada"&gt;[http://www.vmission.org.in/vedanta/articles/drishtishristi.htm], Drishti-sristi-vada.&lt;/ref&gt;
In teachings of Ramana Maharshi there are two cues on solipsism:

"Jiva is called so because he sees the world. A dreamer sees many jivas in a dream, but all of them are not real. The dreamer alone exists and he sees all. So it is with the individual and the world. There is the creed of only one Self, which is also called the creed of only one jiva. It says that the jiva is the only one who sees the whole world and the lives therein."

==Criticism of metaphysical solipsism==

One reason for the lack of support of this philosophical position is how strange it would be for a solipsist to preach solipsism – as if to convince everyone around them that they are purely a figment of the author's own imagination. The very idea of communicating philosophical ideas would be arbitrary to a true solipsist, as according to them, there is no other mind with whom they would communicate their beliefs.

[[Bertrand Russell|Russell]] commented, on the same theme:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"As against solipsism, it is to be said, in the first place, that it is psychologically impossible to believe, and is rejected in fact even by those who mean to accept it. I once received a letter from an eminent logician, Mrs. [[Christine Ladd-Franklin]],
saying that she was a solipsist, and was surprised that there were no others. Coming from a logician, this surprised me. The fact that I cannot believe something does not prove that it is false, but it does prove that I am insincere and frivolous if I pretend to believe it." (Russell, p. 180).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;The basic argument for solipsism suffers a logical error as well. It is argued that, because the mind can not conclude the existence of anything external, therefore nothing external exists. But this conclusion does not follow, only that the existence of externalities cannot be known. It is just as logically consistent that there are external realities/minds/etc. as there are not when experience cannot be verified either true or false.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8057">'''Michael Hauser''' (born 30 March 1972) is a [[Czech people|Czech]] philosopher, translator and founder of the civic organization Socialist Circle ({{lang-cs|Socialistický kruh}}), which he also chaired until 2014. He became a member of the Council of [[Česká televize]] in March 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://domaci.ihned.cz/cesko/c1-61914970-rada-ceske-televize-je-uz-kompletni-u-rozhlasu-ale-poslanci-zvolili-jen-dva-radni|title=Rada České televize je už kompletní, u rozhlasu ale poslanci zvolili jen dva radní|language=Czech|work=Hospodářské noviny|publisher=ihned.cz|date=26 March 2014|accessdate=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and work==
Hauser studied philosophy at [[Charles University]] in [[Prague]], and completed his dissertation, entitled ''Modernity and Negativity. Adorno's Perspective'', in 2004. His primary fields of interest are critical theory, Western [[Marxism]] and Post-Marxism, and their relation to contemporary thought. He mostly deals with materialistic theory of the subject, ideas and [[universalism]], [[praxis (process)|praxis]], concepts of transition and the theory of spectacular categories (or materialist hauntology). He is a fellow at the Department of Contemporary Continental Philosophy (Institute of Philosophy at the Academy of Arts of the Czech Republic), and also teaches at the Faculty of Education ([[Charles University]]). Since 2005, Hauser has published several academic books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oskf.flu.cas.cz/cz/lide/michael-hauser|title=Michael Hauser|author=|publisher=Oskf.flu.cas.cz|accessdate=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hauser has made several translations into Czech, including ''The Ticklish Subject'' by [[Slavoj Žižek]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kosmas.cz/knihy/170838/nepolapitelny-subjekt|title=Nepolapitelný subjekt - Slavoj Žižek - KOSMAS.cz - vaše internetové knihkupectví|work=Kosmas.cz - internetové knihkupectví|accessdate=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Dialectic of the Enlightenment]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oikoymenh.cz/adorno-t-horkheimer/dialektika-osvicenstvi/|title=OIKOYMENH : Dialektika osvícenství - 295Kč|publisher=Oikoymenh.cz|accessdate=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He published a number of articles, both academic (in ''Filosofický časopis'', ''Décalages'', ''An Althusser Studies Journal'') and popular (''Právo'', ''A2'', ''Literární noviny'', ''A2larm''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=A2larm|title=Autor: Michael Hauser|accessdate=14 March 2017|url=http://a2larm.cz/author/michael-hauser/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Deník referendum''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Michael Hauser|work=Deník referendum|url=http://denikreferendum.cz/autor/37-michael-hauser|accessdate=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;). In 2004, he founded Socialist Circle (later renamed as SOK – Association for Leftist Theory), an organization that seeks to reflect and promote contemporary leftist theory in the Czech environment and establish a common basis for interaction between philosophy, sociology, economy and art theory. The association held a number of conferences and public seminars, many of which included Hauser as a speaker, and also published translations of the works of [[Alain Badiou]], [[Jacques Rancière]] or [[Slavoj Žižek]]. Alongside the focus on European philosophy, the association also concentrates on the Czech and Slovak leftist scene (Karel Kosík, Egon Bondy, Milan Machovec). In 2006, Hauser was among the leading figures of the ''Jsme občané!'' (We Are Citizens!) initiative,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://obcan.ecn.cz/index.shtml?apc=rj--1-&amp;w=z&amp;s=n&amp;x=1960025|title=Obansk spolenost - informan server|publisher=Obcan.ecn.cz|accessdate=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; a critical public reflection of the shortcomings of liberal democracy in the Czech Republic. His current work includes the development of a materialist theory of the subject alternative to the conceptions of Alain Badiou and Slavoj Žižek, in the sense that it would relate the discussed issues to the tradition of Western Marxism (Adorno, Lukács, Althusser, Marx). Hauser also finds inspiration in Czech critical thinking (Karel Kosík, Robert Kalivoda, Milan Machovec). He first presented his conception in the book ''Ways out of Postmodernism''.

'''Nikola Milošević''', [[PhD]] ([[Serbian Cyrillic]]: Никола Милошевић) (17 April 1929 in [[Sarajevo]], [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] – 24 January 2007 in [[Belgrade]], [[Serbia]]) was a Serbian writer, political philosopher, literary critic, and politician.

He graduated from the [[University of Belgrade]] [[University of Belgrade Faculty of Philosophy|Faculty of Philosophy]]. He was professor of Literary Theory at the University of Belgrade [[University of Belgrade Faculty of Philology|Faculty of Philology]] since 1969. He became a correspondent member of the [[Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts]] in 1983 and a full member in 1994.  He was president of the [[Miloš Crnjanski]] Endowment in Belgrade.

== Political and intellectual activity ==
In 1968 during [[1968 student demonstrations in Belgrade|a big student revolt]] in the streets of [[Belgrade]], he daily criticized official press coverage of the protests in front of hundreds of protesting students. For this reason he was denounced by semi-official newspaper ''[[Politika]]''. He was a leading anti-Marxist intellectual in [[Serbia]] during the 1970s and 1980s. In the 1970s he criticized severely [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s involvement in pre-revolutionary robberies and this had powerful echo and undermined pro-Marxist intelligentsia in [[Yugoslavia]] that supported the government of [[Josip Broz Tito]]. In his 1985 book ''Marxism and Jesuitism'' he severely criticized Lenin and [[Joseph Stalin]], which prompted Soviet officials to unsuccessfully demand his removal from the [[University of Belgrade]]. He continued his anti-communist involvement during the rule of [[Slobodan Milošević]] (1990–2000) and was eventually banned from entering the Faculty of Philology building in 1998 by a government-appointed dean.

Nikola Milošević's lectures at the Faculty of Philology were attended by the who is who of intellectual Belgrade and his polemics with Marxist authors attracted considerable attention. In 1982, he declined to accept the highest communist award of the City of Belgrade for scholars and artists – the October Prize.

In political sphere he was a [[conservative liberalism|conservative liberal]]. He was one of the founders of the re-established [[Democratic Party (Serbia)|Democratic Party]] in Serbia in 1990. After quarrels with party's leader prof. [[Dragoljub Mićunović]], Nikola Milošević, together with a group of ten prominent members of the Democratic Party, established a new party – the [[Serbian Liberal Party]]. This party advocated liberal and anti-communist ideas and boycotted all elections during the reign of [[Slobodan Milošević]] (1990–2000). In 2003 Nikola Milošević became a member of the [[Parliament of Serbia|Serbian Parliament]] since the Serbian Liberal Party participated in December 2003 elections as a coalition partner of the Democratic Party of Serbia.

His last publication was a collection of political polemics entitled ''Politički spomenar: Od Broza do DOS-a'' [Political Recollection: From Broz to DOS].

== Philosophical orientation ==
He was dedicated to [[philosophical anthropology]] and the problems of [[human nature]]. He attempted to establish a new subdivision of philosophical anthropology which he named [[psychology of knowledge]] and elaborated in detail on this discipline in his books ''Psychology of Knowledge'' and ''Philosophy and Psychology''. Overall he was an anthropological pessimist.&lt;ref name="obituary"&gt;{{cite web|title=Nikola Milošević buried|url=http://www.b92.net/info/vesti/index.php?yyyy=2007&amp;mm=01&amp;dd=26&amp;nav_category=12&amp;nav_id=229377|date=2007-01-26

'''Omega Institute for Holistic Studies''' is a non-profit educational [[Retreat (spiritual)|retreat]] center located in [[Rhinebeck, New York]]. Founded in 1977 by [[Elizabeth Lesser]] and Stephan Rechtschaffen, inspired by [[Sufi]] mystic, Pir [[Vilayat Inayat Khan]] and his [[ecumenical]] spirituality, today it offers classes to over 25,000 people a year, at the {{convert|190|acre|km2|adj=on}} campus.&lt;ref name=pe/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=HAVENS; The 'Bhajan Belt': Serenity in the Catskills|author= Mark Healy|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/18/travel/havens-the-bhajan-belt-serenity-in-the-catskills.html?pagewanted=all |publisher=[[New York Times]] |date=October 18, 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Omega Institute |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BOwDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA59&amp;dq=Omega+Institute&amp;cd=3#v=onepage&amp;q=Omega%20Institute&amp;f=false |date=Mar 1987 |publisher=[[Yoga Journal]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Yoga escapes: a Yoga journal guide to the best places to relax, reflect, and renew|last=Ricci|first=Jeanne|authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2003|publisher=Celestial Arts|isbn=1-58761-187-2|page=30 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DTDJnHfrpOwC&amp;pg=PA30&amp;dq=Omega+Institute&amp;cd=9#v=onepage&amp;q=Omega%20Institute&amp;f=false |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Omega Institute logo.png|frameless|right]]
In 1977, co-founders Stephan Rechtschaffen, author of ''Timeshifting,'' and Elizabeth Lesser, author of ''The Seeker’s Guide'' and ''New York Times'' best-selling ''Broken Open'', say they were inspired to create the Omega Institute by scholar and Eastern meditation teacher, [[Pir Vilayat Inayat Khan]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephan Rechtschaffen, MD, ''Timeshifting: Creating More Time to Enjoy Your Life'' (New York: Main Street Books, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="seeker"&gt;Elizabeth Lesser. ''The Seeker's Guide: Making Your Life a Spiritual Adventure'' (New York: Villard, 1999).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[New York Times]],'' “[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/01/books/bestseller/bestpaperadvice.html?scp=5&amp;sq=%22broken%20open%22%20elizabeth%20lesser&amp;st=cse Bestsellers: Paperback Advice],” ''New York Times Sunday Book Review'' (January 23, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Lesser. ''Broken Open: How Difficult Times Can Help Us Grow'' (New York: Villard, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;  The name “Omega” came from the teachings of [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]], a 20th-century French philosopher and Jesuit priest who used the term “[[Omega Point]]” to describe the peak of unity and integration toward which all life is evolving. First established while Lesser and Rechtschaffen were staying at [[Mount Lebanon Shaker Village|New Lebanon Shaker Village]], then in 1980 it found a new home at a land which once housed the [[Sholem Aleichem]] Folk Institute's Camp Boiberick, in the [[Hudson River Valley]].&lt;ref name=pe&gt;Peter Applebome, “[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9503EEDD1F3EF93BA15751C0A9619C8B63&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=applebome%20Omega&amp;st=cse Our Towns; The Fringe, Now Embraced By Main Street],” ''[[New York Times]]''(February 28, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

Omega Institute began its programming with several workshops, and now holds more than 300 workshops in Rhinebeck, [[New York City]], [[Costa Rica]], and California.&lt;ref name="rising"&gt;Andrea Birnbaum. “Omega Rising,” ''Hudson Valley Chronogram'' (September 2007), 34–36.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rhinebeck, New York Campus==

In 1982, Omega expanded from rented facilities in New York and Vermont to its current location on the former grounds of [[Camp Boiberik]], a Yiddish camp, in Rhinebeck, New York.&lt;ref&gt;BBC Radio. "...Jane Little also visits the oldest new-age institute in the US," ''Americana'' (Episode 11, August 9, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;  There are more than 100 buildings on the {{convert|250|acre|km2|adj=on}} campus, including a dining hall, café, and bookstore. Its buildings also include the [[Ram Dass]] Library, named for author Ram Dass who "has been a trusted guide to Omega". In honor of Dass' life’s work, the organization commissioned the library, which is designed in an eight petal lotus blossom shape to represent Ram Dass’ service to public health, advancing social justice, and supporting spiritual development throughout the world.&lt;ref name="seeker"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rising" /&gt;

The campus also includes the {{visible anchor|Omega Center for Sustainable Living}} (OCSL), which is an education center powered by a 48.5&amp;nbsp;kW solar electric system and has a water reclamation facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Omega seeks 'living building' status|url=http://www.upi.com/Science_News/2009/07/17/Omega-seeks-living-building-status/UPI-66661247849291/tab-listen/ |publisher=[[United Press International]] |date=July 17, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Omega Institute Turns On America's First Zero-Impact "Living Building"  |url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/partner/alteris-4286/news/article/2009/08/omega-institute-turns-on-americas-first-zero-impact-living-building |date=August 24, 2009 |publisher=[[Renewable Energy World]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The OCSL was one of the first two buildings in the world to be certified as "living" by the International Living Building Institute. The Omega Center for Sustainable Living is a wastewater filtration facility that is designed to use the treated water for garden irrigation and in a grey water recovery system. Omega will use the system and the building as a teaching tool in their educational program designed around the ecological impact of their campus.

==Programs and faculty==

Omega’s educational programs include workshops, professional trainings, retreats, and conferences. Workshops are organized into six categories: body, mind, and spirit; health and healing; creative expression; relationships and family; leadership and work; and sustainable living.

New York City events have included speakers such as [[Al Gore]], [[Christopher Reeve]], and
[[Eckhart Tolle]]. Annually, Omega hosts a yoga service conference, and the Omega Women’s Leadership Center offers a conference that has included speakers such as [[Eve Ensler]], [[Isabel Allende]], and [[Sally Field]].&lt;ref&gt;Philip Weiss. “[http://www.observer.com/taxonomy/term/44347/feed Ram Dass Revival: Frail but Vibrant, He Gets a Library],” ''[[The New York Observer]]'' (October 6, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephanie Elizondo Griest. ''100 Places Every Woman Should Go'' (Palo Alto: Solas House, 2007), 149.&lt;/ref&gt;  Omega offers scholarships to a variety of its workshops, trainings, conferences, and retreats.

Other Omega speakers and teachers have included [[Adyashanti]], [[Maya Angelou]], [[Deepak Chopra]], [[Pema Chödrön]], [[Jeanne Fleming]], [[Jane Goodall]], [[Pir Vilayat Inayat Khan]], [[Ram Dass]], [[Thich Nhat Hanh]], [[Allen Ginsberg]], [[Gloria Steinem]], [[Pete Seeger]],
[[Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.]], [[Philip Glass]], [[Betty Williams (Nobel laureate)|Betty Williams]], [[Lon Milo DuQuette]], and many others.

==Staff==

Omega has a core staff of 85 and a seasonal staff of more than 250.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn Behrendt. "Omega, All Grown Up", ''About Town'' (Fall 2007), 1,16.&lt;/ref&gt; The core staff plan and develop the curriculum, marketing, and production for the season’s programs, and its seasonal staff manage and staff campus departments. Inspired by Ram Dass, Omega created a curriculum for Omega’s staff that includes classes designed to encourage self-development, mindfulness, and community service.&lt;ref name="rising"/&gt;

'''Paul Souriau''' (1852–1926) was a [[France|French]] [[Philosophy|philosopher]] known for his works on [[Invention|invention theory]] and [[aesthetics]].

He studied at the [[École normale supérieure]] where he wrote a [[thesis or dissertation|doctoral thesis]] entitled ''Théorie de l'invention'' published in 1881. In his thesis, he argues that inventions are not the result of a rigorous scientific method but rather come as a [[Determinism|deterministic]] consequence of a set of conditions in which the inventor lives. This theory was contested very soon after its publication in the 1882 edition of the ''Revue Internationale de l'Enseignement''.&lt;ref&gt;Société de l'enseignement supérieur (1882) [https://books.google.com/books?id=TdfNAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=th%C3%A9orie%20de%20l'invention%20souriau&amp;hl=en&amp;pg=PR8#v=onepage&amp;q=th%C3%A9orie%20de%20l'invention%20souriau&amp;f=false Revue internationale de l'enseignement, Volume 3], G. Masson, ed.&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1882 his wife gave birth to [[Étienne Souriau]], who also became a philosopher in [[aesthetics]]. The French thesis was created simultaneously with a [[Latin]] thesis titled ''De motus perceptione''. The Latin thesis emphasized the importance of vision in movement perception, hence the initial title ''De visione motus''.&lt;ref&gt;Guyard MM. S., Havet L., Monod G., Paris G. (1882) [https://books.google.com/books?id=8fbUAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=th%C3%A9orie%20de%20l'invention&amp;hl=en&amp;pg=PA135#v=onepage&amp;q=souriau&amp;f=false Revue critique d'histoire et de littérature, Volume 1], Ernest Leroux, ed.&lt;/ref&gt; The thesis was a precursor for his later works on movement perception.

He became a professor at the Faculté des Lettres de [[Lille]] (now [[Université Lille Nord de France|University of Lille]]) very soon after its foundation in 1887. In 1889, he published his reflections on the aesthetics of movement.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Souriau (1889) [https://books.google.com/books?id=j7YRAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_v2_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false L'esthétique du mouvement], Félix Alcan, ed.&lt;/ref&gt; The book described two levels of movement [[aesthetics]]: the mechanical beauty (the adaptation of the movement to fulfil its goal) and the movement expression (the meaning of the movement for an observer). By doing so Souriau distinguished movement from perception of movement, two concepts which later became the subjects of studies of [[motor cognition]] and [[psychophysics]].

Throughout his career, but more particularly during the first decade of the 20th century, he published his reflections on the [[aesthetics]] of arts while being a professor at [[Henri Poincaré University]] ([[Nancy, France|Nancy]]).&lt;ref&gt;Paul Souriau (1901) [https://archive.org/stream/limaginationdel00sourgoog#page/n12/mode/1up L'imagination de l'artiste], Librairie Hachette et Cie, ed.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Souriau (1904) [https://archive.org/stream/labeautrationne01sourgoog#page/n10/mode/1up La beauté rationnelle], Félix Alcan, ed.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Souriau (1906) [https://archive.org/stream/larverieesthtiq01sourgoog#page/n9/mode/1up La rêverie esthétique: essai sur la psychologie du poète], Félix Alcan, ed.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Souriau (1909) [https://archive.org/stream/lasuggestiondans00souruoft#page/n9/mode/2up La suggestion dans l'art], Félix Alcan, ed.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout his life, [[Félix Alcan]] was his main editor.

==Career==

===Early career===
Kuhn first came to prominence in 1972 when "Why the Vast Difference between Animal Brain and Human Mind?" appeared in ''[[The Plain Truth]]'' magazine published by [[Ambassador College]], an institution of the [[Worldwide Church of God]] (WCG). The WCG's Systematic Theology Project&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Systematic Theology Project|url=http://www.hwarmstrong.com/history/stp.htm}} 1978, which can be obtained on data disc from www.icg.org.au&lt;/ref&gt; was coordinated by Kuhn, but later banned by WCG Founder [[Herbert W. Armstrong]]. Kuhn severed his connection to the WCG and its affiliates, including the Ambassador International Cultural Foundation (classical music concerts, featuring musicians including [[Vladimir Horowitz]] and [[Luciano Pavarotti]]), which Kuhn had created and managed.

During the 1980s, Kuhn represented American and [[Japanese companies]] in [[mergers and acquisitions]].

===China===
During the 19th CPC National Congress (October 2017), Dr. Kuhn was interviewed extensively, including multiple times on CNN, BBC World News and BBC World Service, CGTN, and CCTV, and he was quoted extensively. His full-page, in-depth analyses of the 19th CPC National Congress were featured in China Daily to open the Congress ("Historical Starting Point for New Stage of Development")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/opinion/2017-10/18/content_33394848.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to close the Congress ("New Era on the Road to 2050")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/opinion/2017-10/28/content_33807725.htm).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kuhn has written on President Xi Jinping's "core" status in the Communist Party of China ("Why China needs Xi Jinping as its core leader")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/2047173/why-china-needs-xi-jinping-its-core-leader).}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the elimination of term limits for China's presidency ("Xi Jinping's power has a purpose—one person to see China through its development plans").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/2136309/xi-jinpings-power-has-purpose-one-person-see-china-through).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kuhn provided the live commentary on CNN during President Xi Jinping's policy address in [[Seattle]] on September 2, 2015 during Xi's state visit to the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/videos/world/2015/09/23/china-xi-jinping-us-visit-kuhn-intv.cnn|title=Xi Jingping visits the United States|accessdate=October 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kuhn spoke at the launch ceremony of Xi's book, entitled ''Xi Jinping: The Governance of China'' at the Frankfurt Book Fair on October 8, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.sina.com/culture/p/2014/1008/743823.html|title=Xi's book on governance debuts at German fair|work=sina.com|accessdate=August 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kuhn writes on Xi's ''Four Comprehensives'' political theory of governance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europe.chinadaily.com.cn/epaper/2015-08/07/content_21525385.htm|title=Xi makes his governance comprehensive-Comment -chinadaily.com.cn|work=chinadaily.com.cn|accessdate=August 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/1845021/xi-jinpings-four-comprehensives-show-depth-his-leadership|title=Xi Jinping's 'Four Comprehensives' show the depth of his leadership|date=July 30, 2015|work=South China Morning Post|accessdate=August 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on understanding the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/opinion/2015-06/03/content_20894534.htm|title=Understanding Communist Party of China|author=殷涛|work=chinadaily.com.cn|accessdate=August 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/1809033/know-china-one-must-understand-communist-party|title=To know China, one must understand the Communist Party|date=May 26, 2015|work=South China Morning Post|accessdate=August 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, he was invited to China by the director of the [[State Science and Technology Commission]], [[Song Jian]], whom Kuhn considers his mentor.&lt;ref name="Kuhn2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Lawrence Kuhn|title=How China's Leaders Think: The Inside Story of China's Reform and What This Means for the Future|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BOf_WWTKZpMC&amp;pg=PA278|date=19 November 2009|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-82590-7|pages=278–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then he has worked with China's senior leaders and advised the Chinese government on international, policy and business matters.

Kuhn is the author of ''How China's Leaders Think: The Inside Story of China's Past, Current and Future Leaders'', featuring exclusive discussions with more than 100&amp;nbsp;Chinese leaders and features President Xi Jinping.&lt;ref name="Kuhn2009"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chang|first=Gordon G.|title=Politically Incorrect: Robert Lawrence Kuhn's "How China's Leaders Think."|url=https://www.forbes.com/2010/01/18/china-leaders-politics-asia-opinions-book-review-gordon-g-chang.html|accessdate=August 9, 2012|newspaper=Forbes|date=January 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He wrote ''The Man Who Changed China: The Life and Legacy of Jiang Zemin''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Man-Who-Changed-China-Legacy/dp/B005ZOKFTW/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1354408455&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=jiang+zemin|title=The Man Who Changed China: The Life and Legacy of Jiang Zemin: Robert Lawrence Kuhn: Amazon.com: Books|work=amazon.com|accessdate=August 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first [[biography]] of a living Chinese leader and was a best-seller in China in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gilley|first=Bruce|title=In China's Own Eyes|url=http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/61033/bruce-gilley/in-china-s-own-eyes|accessdate=August 9, 2012|newspaper=Foreign Affairs|date=September–October 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kuhn, Robert Lawrence|first=and Bruce Gillery|title=One Country, Two Prisms|url=http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/61383/robert-lawrence-kuhn-and-bruce-gilley/one-country-two-prisms|accessdate=August 13, 2012|newspaper=Foreign Affairs|date=January–February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kuhn is co-editor-in-chief of ''China's Banking &amp; Financial Markets: The Internal Research Report of the Chinese Government''.

===Criticism of Kuhn's Jiang Zemin Biography===
Several reviewers argue that Kuhn has obtained privileged access to China's leaders by refraining from critical comments, producing propaganda instead of serious works of non-fiction. A review in [[Foreign Affairs]] of Kuhn's [[The Man Who Changed China]], a biography of [[Jiang Zemin]] said it was actually better understood as an officially sanctioned autobiography, presenting an image that China's leaders want the world to see. Additionally, it said the writing of the book was, beginning in 2001, overseen by a secret state propaganda team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/61033/bruce-gilley/in-china-s-own-eyes|title=In China's Own Eyes|work=Foreign Affairs|accessdate=May 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Asian Review of Books said that the first part of this book was "close to [[hagiography]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianreviewofbooks.com/new/?ID=738#!|title=The Asian Review of Books|work=asianreviewofbooks.com|accessdate=May 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A review on the website of [[Forbes]] said his later book, ''How China's Leaders Think: The Inside Story of China's Past, Current and Future Leaders'', was equally reluctant to criticize [[Hu Jintao]], the leader who followed Jiang. The reviewer writes: "Kuhn merely repeats what the Communist Party says about itself and accepts its words at face value, taking obsequiousness to new heights." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/2010/01/18/china-leaders-politics-asia-opinions-book-review-gordon-g-chang.html|title=Politically Incorrect|author=Gordon G.

He grew up in Warsaw, where his father Morduch Zaitchik became a merchant. After graduating from the 8th grade of the 5th Warsaw gymnasium he became a member of a revolutionary circle, which led to a legal action against him in 1887 over spreading of a revolutionary poem. He left Warsaw in late December of that year and moved to Vienna.

He was a professor at [[Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich|Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zürich]] (1895–1914), [[University of Cologne|Universität zu Köln]] (1914–1925).

Ruether is an advocate of women's [[ordination]], a movement among Catholic religious persons who affirm women's capacity to serve as priests, despite official sanction. Since 1985 Ruether has served as a board member for the [[pro-choice]] group "[[Catholics for Choice]]".&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, Mary E. [http://ncronline.org/news/people/life-scholar-activist-rosemary-radford-ruether "The Life of 'Scholar Activist' Rosemary Radford Ruether."] National Catholic Reporter, October 15, 2014. Accessed January 4, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==

Ruether was born in 1936 in [[St. Paul, Minnesota]],&lt;ref name=ContempAuth /&gt;  to a [[Roman Catholic]] mother and [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] father. She has reportedly described her upbringing as [[free-thinking]] and [[Humanism|humanistic]] as opposed to oppressive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people.bu.edu/wwildman/WeirdWildWeb/courses/mwt/dictionary/mwt_themes_908_ruether.htm|title=Boston Collaborative Encyclopedia of Western Theology|website=people.bu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ruether's father died when she was 12 and afterwards Ruether and her mother moved to California. Ruether attended several Catholic schools staffed by the Sisters of Providence from St. Mary-of-the-Woods, IN, who, in conjunction with her mother's friend group, offered Ruether a strong feminist and activist foundation that informed her later work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ncronline.org/news/people/life-scholar-activist-rosemary-radford-ruether|title=The life of 'scholar activist' Rosemary Radford Ruether|date=2014-10-15|work=National Catholic Reporter|access-date=2018-03-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; She pursued a college education at [[Scripps College]] from 1954-58. She entered with an intention to study art, but one professor, Robert Palmer, influenced her decision to switch to classics. Palmer's passion for classical Greek and Roman culture introduced Ruether to the philosophies and histories of  the era. She received an MA in classics and Roman history, and later a doctorate in classics and patristics at the School of Theology at Claremont.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://people.bu.edu/wwildman/bce/mwt_themes_908_ruether.htm|title=Boston Collaborative Encyclopedia of Western Theology: Rosemary Radford Ruether |website=people.bu.edu|access-date=2018-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruether participated in civil rights activism during the 1960s in Mississippi and Washington D.C. She worked for the [[Delta Ministry]] in Mississippi where she was exposed to the struggles of African American communities and the realities of racism. She became immersed in black liberation theology literature during her time of teaching at the Howard University, School of Religion. She dedicated her time to the peace movement in Washington D.C., and she often went to jail with other radical Catholics and Protestants because of marches and demonstrations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Despite her radicalism, Ruether remained in the Catholic Church alongside other religious activists. Her first book, ''The Church Against Itself'' (1967), criticizes the doctrine of the church and the church's views of sexuality and reproduction.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

She is married to the [[political scientist]] Herman Ruether.&lt;ref name="ContempAuth" /&gt; They studied their different interests alongside each other after their marriage during Ruether's last year of college.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; They have three children and live in California.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cst.edu/academic_resources/faculty.php Website of Claremont School of Theology]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==

'''Seongcheol''' (April 6, 1912 &amp;ndash; November 4, 1993) is the [[dharma name]] of a [[Koreans|Korean]] [[Buddhism in Korea|Seon]] ([[Zen]]) Master.&lt;ref name=sibong&gt;원택. (2001). ''성철스님 시봉이야기''. Seoul: 김영사. (Wontek. (2001). ''Seongcheol Seunim Sibong Iyagi''.  Seoul: Kimyoungsa.) {{ISBN|89-349-0847-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a key figure in modern [[Korean Buddhism]], being responsible for significant changes to it from the 1950s to 1990s.&lt;ref name=sibong/&gt;

Seongcheol was widely recognized in [[Korea]] as having been a living [[Buddhahood|Buddha]], due to his extremely [[ascetic]] lifestyle, the duration and manner of his [[meditation]] training, his central role in reforming [[Korean Buddhism]] in the post-[[World War II]] era, and the quality of his oral and written teachings.&lt;ref name=sibong/&gt;

==Life==

===Early life===
{{Buddhism}}
Born on April 10, 1912 in [[Korea]] under the name of Yi Yeongju(이영주), Seongcheol was the first of seven children of a [[Confucian]] scholar in [[Gyeongsang]] [[province]].  He was rumored to have been an exceptionally bright child who read constantly, having learned to read at the age of three, and being proficient enough to read such [[China|Chinese]] classics as ''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]'' and ''[[Journey to the West]]'' by age ten.  His enthusiasm for reading was such that he once traded a sack of rice for [[Immanuel Kant]]'s ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' as a teenager.&lt;ref name=net&gt;[http://www.songchol.net/ 인터넷 사바세계와 함께 하는 성철큰스님]&lt;/ref&gt;

Having read numerous books on [[philosophy]] and [[religion]], both [[Western culture|Western]] and [[Eastern culture|Eastern]], he reportedly felt dissatisfied, being convinced that these could not lead him to truth.  One day, a [[Korean Buddhism#Seon|Seon]] [[monk]] gave Seongcheol a copy of ''[[Song of Enlightenment|The Song of Attainment of the Tao]]'' ([[Hangul]]: 증도가, [[Hanja]]: 證道歌), a Seon text written by Yeongga Hyeon-gak (永嘉玄覺) in the [[Tang dynasty]].  Seongcheol felt as if "a bright light had suddenly been lit in complete darkness," and that he had finally found the way to the ultimate truth.&lt;ref name=sibong/&gt;

Immediately, he started meditating on the "Mu" gong-an (Japanese: [[koan]]) and started ignoring all his responsibilities at home.  Deciding that his parents' house had too many distractions, he promptly packed his bags and went to Daewonsa (Daewon [[temple]]).  After obtaining permission to stay in the [[temple]], the young Seongcheol started to [[meditate]] intensively.  Later in life, he would say that he attained the state of Dongjeong Ilyeo (see Teachings below, [[Hangul]]: 동정일여, [[Hanja]]: 動靜一如) at this early point in his life in only forty-two days.&lt;ref name=sibong/&gt;

The rumor of a lay person meditating so intensely naturally spread to the main [[temple]] of [[Haeinsa]](해인사).  Under the recommendations of renowned Seon Masters Gim Beomnin and Choe Beomsul, the young Seongcheol left for [[Haeinsa]] in the winter of 1936.  At the time, Seon Master Dongsan was the spiritual leader of [[Haeinsa]], and recognizing Seongcheol's great potential, he recommended he become a [[monk]].  But Seongcheol refused, stating that he had absolutely no intention of becoming a [[monk]] and that only intense [[meditation]] was important.  But Dongsan master's [[dharma]] talk during the following retreat season changed his mind:&lt;ref name=sibong/&gt;

:"There is a way.  No one will reveal the secret.  You must enter the door yourself.  But there is no door.  In the end, there is not even a way."&lt;ref name=net/&gt;

In March 1937, Yi Yeongju received his [[dharma name]] of Seongcheol, forsook all relations with the outside world, and became a monk, writing this [[poem]]:

:''The great achievements of the world are but snowflakes melting on fire,''
:''Accomplishments that move oceans are but dew disappearing in the glare of the sun,''
:''Why live a dream in this ethereal life of dreams,''
:''I forsake all to walk towards the great eternal truth.''&lt;ref name=sibong/&gt;&lt;ref name=net/&gt;
:彌天大業紅爐雪
:跨海雄基赫日露
:誰人甘死片時夢
:超然獨步萬古眞&lt;ref name=sibong/&gt;&lt;ref name=net/&gt;

===Enlightenment===
In the tradition of Korean Buddhist monks, Seongcheol wandered from one temple to the next after each meditation retreat.  In the summer of 1940, he went into deep meditation at the Geum Dang Seon Center and attained enlightenment.&lt;ref name=net/&gt;  Having become a monk at the age of 25, he had attained his true nature in only three years.  He went on to write his enlightenment poem:

:''The Yellow River flows westward,
:''To the summit of Gonryun [Kunlun] Mountain,
:''Sun and moon lose their light and the earth falls away,
:''Smiling once and turning around, the blue mountain stands amongst the white clouds as before.''&lt;ref name=sibong/&gt;&lt;ref name=net/&gt;
:黃河西流崑崙頂
:日月無光大地沈
:遽然一笑回首立
:靑山依舊白雲中&lt;ref name=sibong/&gt;&lt;ref name=net/&gt;

Having attained enlightenment, Seongcheol began pilgrimages to various temples in order to validate his experience and to examine other monks and their levels of attainment.  But he was frequently disappointed, noticing that [[Dharma transmission|inka]] (validation of a monk's attainment by a master) was given too carelessly, thereby falsely recognizing many monks as having fully attained enlightenment.&lt;ref name=sibong/&gt;  During his retreat at [[Songgwangsa]], he was also dismayed at [[Jinul]]'s theory of Dono Jeomsu (sudden enlightenment, gradual training), and how it was the widespread theory during the time.  Later during the 1980s and 1990s, his contribution to the revival of [[Hui Neng]]'s traditional theory of Dono Donsu (sudden enlightenment, sudden training) would have a significant effect on the practice of [[Korean Buddhism#Seon|Seon]] in [[Korea]], [[China]], [[Japan]], and other countries where Seon/[[Zen]] is practiced.&lt;ref name=sibong/&gt;

===Growing reputation and recognition===
Seongcheol's reputation soon began to spread.  Numerous factors contributed to his growing recognition.

One of the more famous anecdotes is Seongcheol's Jangjwa Bulwa ([[Hangul]]: 장좌불와, [[Hanja]]: 長坐不臥).  Literally translated as 'long sitting, no lying,' it is a [[meditation]] technique that some monks employ to intensify their practice.  Sitting meditation is equivalent to most other practices, except that the practitioner does not lie down to sleep, but stays in the [[lotus position]] even during sleep, with the intention of minimizing sleep through the position.  Seongcheol was known to have practiced this for eight years after his enlightenment.  He reportedly never once lied down and denied sleeping at all.&lt;ref name=sibong/&gt;&lt;ref name=net/&gt;

Another anecdote recounts how while Seongcheol was staying in Mangwolsa in Dobong mountain, an old [[monk]] by the name of Chunseong refused to believe this.  He wanted to catch Seongcheol dozing off to sleep, so spied on him secretly throughout one night.  But having witnessed the truth of the rumor, Chunseong was struck with amazement and himself started employing the technique.  It is said that the stress of the practice and the old age at which he started the technique caused all of his teeth to fall out later in life.&lt;ref name=sibong/&gt;&lt;ref name=net/&gt;

Seongcheol's reputation for intensive practice was not limited only to his [[meditation]] per se.  He was also known to be completely indifferent to the outside world, focused intently only on meditation and guiding fellow monks to enlightenment.  His indifference was so thorough that he even refused to see his mother when she visited him at Mahayunsa in [[Kumgangsan]] mountain.  "No need to see her" was reportedly his reply to her visit, to which his fellow monks burst out in anger, stating that although they were monks devoted to [[asceticism]] and [[meditation]], refusing to see his own mother was too extreme an action.  Afterwards, Seongcheol accompanied his mother, showing her the sites of [[Kumgangsan]] mountain.&lt;ref name=sibong/&gt;&lt;ref name=net/&gt;

===Reformation of Korean Buddhism===

====Bong Am Sa====
On August 15, 1945, [[Japan]] surrendered unconditionally, thereby ending [[World War II]] and the [[Korea under Japanese rule|occupation of Korea]].  The events offered an invaluable opportunity for the  reformation of [[Korean Buddhism]], which had been severely oppressed during the [[Korean Buddhism#Buddhism during the Japanese occupation (1910–1945)|Japanese occupation]].  As an emerging leader of [[Korean Buddhism]], Seongcheol joined the nascent discussions on the emerging plans to reform the religion.  Forming a partnership with such luminaries as the venerable Jawoon, Cheongdam, and Hyanggok, the future leaders of Korean Buddhism chose Bong Am Sa temple of Heui Yang mountain.  There, they formed a pact to live strictly according to the [[Vinaya]], the Buddhist code of ethics.  The members agreed upon rules of conduct ([[Hangul]]: 공주규약, [[Hanja]]: 共住規約) and required strict adherence to it amongst themselves:&lt;ref name=sibong/&gt;

#To follow the Vinaya and practice the teachings of the patriarchs in order to attain the great enlightenment.
#With the exception of the Buddhist teachings, no personal opinions or philosophies will be tolerated.
#The necessary items for daily living should be obtained on his own, without dependence on lay people, including daily chores of field work, firewood, etc.
#Absolutely no assistance from the lay people in terms of cooking, clothing, alms, or gifts.
#To eat only gruel in the morning, and to not eat at all after noon.
#The monks' sitting order follows the dates of ordination.
#To only meditate and be silent in the rooms.&lt;ref name=sibong/&gt;&lt;ref name=net/&gt;

The reformation movement started around a small group of monks centered on Seongcheol, but quickly grew by reputation, attracting monks all over the country who were also intent on bringing back the Korean tradition of intense meditation, strict celibacy, and study of [[sutra]]s.  Among these younger generations were Weolsan (월산), Ubong (우봉), Bomun (보문), Seongsu (성수), Dou (도우), Hyeam (혜암), Beopjeon (법전), etc.  Not only did this group become the future leaders of Korean Buddhism, but produced two Supreme Patriarchs (Hyeam, Beopjeon) and three chief administrators of the [[Jogye]] order.&lt;ref name=net/&gt;

====Post-Bong-amsa====
Unfortunately, the Bong Am Sa experiment ended prematurely in 1950 when the [[Korean War]] broke out on the peninsula.  With constant bombing raids and the presence of soldiers of both sides around the temple, it was impossible to continue the strict monastic life of Bong-amsa.&lt;ref name=sibong/&gt;

Some of the reforms that occurred during this period were:&lt;ref name=sibong/&gt;
*unification of robes, including the color (mostly grey), cut, and seasonal variants
*rectification of the [[Jogye]] order's bylaws
*unification of Buddhist services
*instatement of the monastic educational curriculum

After the war, the reformation gained momentum and significant changes were set in motion, although it would be years until they were solidified.  Central to the reformation was the issue of celibacy.  While all the Buddhist canons emphasized the celibacy of monks, Japanese Buddhism had undergone significant changes during the Meiji Restoration, most notably the end of monastic celibacy.  During the Japanese occupation, Korean Buddhism was [[Korean Buddhism#Buddhism during the Japanese occupation (1910–1945)|severely oppressed]] and the Japanese style was advocated, thereby converting most Korean monks into little more than monastic residents officiating over ceremonies, married, with a business and income.  Seongcheol and the new leaders were very critical of the Japanese style of Buddhism, maintaining that the tradition of celibacy, hermitage, poverty, and intense meditation were not only central to Korean Buddhism but to the true spirit of Buddhism as a whole.  Korean post-war sentiments towards Japan could not have been worse at this time, and with the help of the populace and president [[Syngman Rhee]], the traditional Korean style began to take hold and became the dominant form of Buddhism by the 1970s.&lt;ref name=sibong/&gt;

Seongcheol insisted on giving away all monastic assets to the public and reverting to the original Buddhist way of wandering and begging for alms while investing all energy into meditation.  He contended this was the only surefire way for true reforms to take place, warning that otherwise, full-scale conflict could ensue between bikkhus and married monks fighting over temples.  The leaders of the reformation refused to follow, stating that his assertions were too extreme.&lt;ref name=net/&gt;  Seongcheol's predictions, though, did come true and Korean Buddhism has had numerous conflicts between monks over temple jurisdiction ever since then up to the present day, many of them escalating to violent measures by both sides (e.g. paying gangsters to physically harm opponents).  Many ordination restrictions were loosened by the bikkhus in order to increase their numbers in their efforts to assume control over temples such that men of questionable social standing (e.g. former convicts and criminals) were ordained as bikkhus, leading to more violent fights amongst monks.  A particularly embarrassing chapter in Korean Buddhism was in the late 1990s when monks fought over Jogyesa, the main administrative temple in Seoul, by not only employing gangsters but joining the fight themselves using weapons, including Molotov cocktails, to violently subdue each other.&lt;ref name=sibong/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130814060336/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/472155.stm Violent clashes in the Jogye order]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ten years as a hermit in Seongjeonam===
In 1955, Seongcheol was appointed as the patriarch of [[Haeinsa]], but disappointed by the direction that the reformation was taking, Seongcheol declined, removing himself from the forefront and moved to a hermitage near Pagyesa in the Palgong mountains near Daegu to deepen the meditative and enlightened stage that he had attained.  The hermitage was named Seongjeonam and it was here that Seongcheol began to build the scholarly foundations that would later support his spiritual teachings.  Seongcheol surrounded the hermitage with barbed wire so as to keep outsiders out (except for a few assistants) and himself within its boundaries.  Never leaving the boundaries of the small hermitage for an incredible ten years, he deepened his meditation and studied the ancient Buddhist canons, Zen texts, sutras, modern mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, and even taught himself English so as to keep current on international affairs.  This decade of self-education would affect his future teachings significantly.&lt;ref name=sibong/&gt;&lt;ref name=net/&gt;

===Haeinsa and the Hundred-Day Talk===
Seongcheol finally opened the doors of Seong Juhn Am hermitage in 1965.  The temple he visited was Gimyongsa, where he gave his first dharma talk in a decade.  In 1967, with the insisting of Jawoon, Seongcheol became the patriarch of [[Haeinsa]] temple.  That winter, he started his daily two-hour dharma talks to monks and the lay people, thereby beginning his famous Hundred-Day Talk ([[Hangul]]: 백일법문, [[Hanja]]: 百日法門.)  Applying his decade of scholarly studies, he began to break the stereotype of the "boring and stuffy" dharma talks and transformed them into an electrifying hybrid of Buddhism, spiritualism, quantum mechanics, general relativity, and current affairs, ushering in a new kind of dharma talk aimed at reaching the modern audience living in an age of globalization and intellectual diversity.&lt;ref name=sibong/&gt;&lt;ref name=net/&gt;

===Supreme Patriarch of the Jogye order===
Ushering in a revival of the Seon tradition of intense meditation and strict monastic lifestyle, Seongcheol spearheaded the reformation of modern Korean Buddhism from the rubbles of Japanese colonialism into an epicenter of meditation training.  During his tenure as patriarch of Haeinsa, the temple transformed into a training ground for meditation, sutra studies, and Vinaya studies, attracting monks from all over the country.  The meditation center averaged approximately 500 monks per biannual retreat, which was unheard of since the days of [[Hui Neng]] and [[Mazu Daoyi|Ma Tzu]].&lt;ref name=net/&gt;

During the 1970s, the political climate became even more militaristic and dictatorial, eventually leading to a purge of many Buddhist monks suspected of political involvement.  With his increasing reputation as a living Buddha both by the lay and the monastic, the [[Jogye]] order looked toward Seongcheol and nominated him as the next Supreme Patriarch of the order.  "If I can help reform and improve Korean Buddhism, I will humbly accept" was the response he gave.&lt;ref name=sibong/&gt;&lt;ref name=net/&gt;  His inauguration speech brought him from a little known monk, only known by monks and devout lay people, into the limelight as the official leader of Korean Buddhism, bringing his teachings to the entire nation:
:''Perfect enlightenment pervades all, serenity and destruction are not two
:''All that is visible is [[Avalokiteshvara]], all that is audible is the mystical sound
:''No other truth than seeing and hearing
:''Do you understand?
:''Mountain is mountain, water is water.''&lt;ref name=sibong/&gt;&lt;ref name=net/&gt;
:원각이 보조하니 적과 멸이 둘이 아니라.
:보이는 만물은 관음이요 들리는 소리는 묘음이라.
:보고 듣는 이 밖에 진리가 따로 없으니
:시회대중은 알겠는가?
:산은 산이요 물은 물이로다.&lt;ref name=sibong/&gt;&lt;ref name=net/&gt;

Declining all formal ceremonies as Supreme Patriarch from inauguration to his death, Seongcheol never left the mountains, stating that a monk's true place was in the temple.  There was initially a huge protest against his semi-hermetic policy, but this was eventually replaced by sense of respect that had been lacking [[Korean Buddhism#Suppression under the Joseon Dynasty (1392–1910)|since the Joseon period]], and helped to vastly improve the image and treatment of monks in Korea.&lt;ref name=sibong/&gt;

During his years as patriarch of [[Haeinsa]] and as Supreme Patriarch of the [[Jogye]] order, Seongcheol's reputation kept growing.  Amongst monks, he was famous for being a very strict teacher, being called the tiger of Kaya mountain.  When monks would nod off to sleep during meditation, he would beat them with wooden sticks while yelling, "Thief, pay for your rice!" (referring to the donations of the lay, and the monks' debts to society and therefore his duty to practice to the utmost of his abilities).&lt;ref name=sibong/&gt;

He was also known for his unique three thousand prostrations.&lt;ref name=sibong/&gt;&lt;ref name=net/&gt;&lt;ref name=see/&gt;&lt;ref name=forever/&gt;  After the [[Korean war]], Seongcheol built a small cave-hermitage near Anjungsa temple and named it Cheonjegul.  Around this time, many people came to pay their respects to him, and to further guide the pilgrims in their practice, Seongcheol first started using his famous 3000 prostrations.  Nobody could visit with him unless the person completed 3000 prostrations in front of the statue of the Buddha in the main hall.  Later, some lay people would accuse Seongcheol of arrogance, but he maintained that this practice was used to help guide practitioners in their own practice by helping them destroy their ego and more easily attain one-mindedness (N.B.: the 3000 full prostrations are actually a mainstay of the Korean Buddhist training regimen, performed at most temples in Korea on a monthly basis.  It would take approximately eight to twelve hours, depending on the experience of the practitioner, and the technique is used frequently to "clear the mind," instill a sense of humility, and increase the awareness and focusing power of the practitioner).  As his fame and reputation grew, the prostrations became more necessary as more and more people asked to meet with him.  What was unique was that this requirement was uniform, i.e., he would never make any exceptions regardless of the person's wealth, fame, or power.  A famous anecdote serves to illustrate the daunting task of the 3000 prostrations and Seongcheol's strict adherence to his own rules.  When [[Park Chung-hee]], the president of Korea, was opening up the new highway between Seoul and Pusan, he happened to visit Haeinsa.  Hearing that the president was visiting, the head administrative monk quickly sent word to Seongcheol to come down from his hermitage to greet the president.  But true to form, Seongcheol demanded the president go to the main Buddha hall and perform the 3000 prostrations before meeting with him.  Park refused and the two never met.&lt;ref name=sibong/&gt;

===Publications===
During the latter years of his life, Seongcheol presided over many publications, including eleven books of his lectures and 37 books that translated many Zen classics not well known to the general public (see [http://www.songchol.net official website]).  The former included the full transcriptions of the Hundred-Day Talk, lectures on [[Huineng]]'s [[Platform Sutra|sutra]], [[Xinxin Ming|''Shin Sim Myung'']] ([[Hangul]]: 신심명, [[Hanja]]: 信心銘), ''Jeung Do Ga'' ([[Hangul]]: 증도가, [[Hanja]]: 證道歌), ''Illumination of Sudden Enlightenment'' ([[Hangul]]: 돈오입도요문론, [[Hanja]]: 頓悟入道要門論), and his dharma talks.  The latter was called ''Seon Lim Go Gyung Chong Suh'' ([[Hangul]]: 선림고경총서, [[Hanja]]: 禪林古鏡叢書) and was a collection of Chinese and Korean Zen classics that until publication was known mostly only to monks.&lt;ref name=sibong/&gt;  These publications helped to spread his teachings to the general public and raise the general awareness and knowledge of Buddhism.

English translations of Great Master Seongcheol's work include "Echoes from Mt. Kaya", Changgyonggak Publishing, Seoul, 1988 (currently out of print), and "Opening the Eye", Gimmyeong International Co., Seoul, 2002. Both are translations from Korean by Brian Barry.

===Death===
On November 4, 1993, Seongcheol died in Haeinsa Toesoeldang, the same room in which he had first become ordained as a monk.&lt;ref name=sibong/&gt;&lt;ref name=net/&gt;  His last words to his followers were: "Meditate well".&lt;ref name=sibong/&gt;  His parinirvana poem was:
:''Deceiving people all my life, my sins outweigh Mount Sumeru.
:''Falling into hell alive, my grief divides into ten thousand pieces.
:''Spouting forth a red wheel,
:''It hangs on the blue mountain.''&lt;ref name=sibong/&gt;&lt;ref name=net/&gt;
:生平欺狂男女群
:彌天罪業過須彌
:活陷阿鼻恨萬端
:一輪吐紅掛碧山&lt;ref name=sibong/&gt;&lt;ref name=net/&gt;

Seongcheol had this explanation for the cryptic poem:&lt;ref name=sibong/&gt;
{{Quote|I've lived my entire life as a practitioner, and people have always asked me for something.  Everyone is already a Buddha, but they do not try to realize that fact and only look towards me.  So, in a way, you could say I've deceived people all my life.  I've failed to get this message across to everyone so I'm suffering in a kind of hell.}}

His death was followed by the largest funeral ever seen in Korean history for a monk, with over 100,000 people attending.  His cremation took over thirty hours and his [[sarira]] numbered over a hundred.&lt;ref name=sibong/&gt;

==Teachings==
Seongcheol's teachings can be summarized into five big categories:

===Sudden enlightenment, sudden cultivation===
Citing [[Taego Bou]] (太古普愚: 1301-1382) as the true successor of the [[Linji Yixuan]] (臨済義玄) line of patriarchs rather than [[Jinul]] (知訥: 1158-1210), he advocated [[Hui Neng]]'s original stance of 'sudden enlightenment, sudden cultivation' ([[Hangul]]: 돈오돈수, [[Hanja]]: 頓悟頓修) as opposed to Jinul's stance of 'sudden enlightenment, gradual cultivation' ([[Hangul]]: 돈오점수, [[Hanja]]: 頓悟漸修).&lt;ref name=line&gt;퇴옹 성철. (1976). ''한국불교의 법맥''. 해인사 백련암 (Korea): 장경각. (Toeng Seongcheol. (1976). ''Hanguk Bulgyo Ei Bupmaek''. Haeinsa Baekryun'am (Korea): Jang'gyung'gak.) {{ISBN|89-85244-16-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Whereas Jinul had initially asserted that with enlightenment comes the need to further one's practice by gradually destroying the karmic vestiges attained through millions of rebirths, [[Huineng]] and Seongcheol maintained that with perfect enlightenment, all karmic remnants disappear and one becomes a Buddha immediately.&lt;ref name=see&gt;퇴옹 성철. (1987). ''자기를 바로 봅시다''. 해인사 백련암 (Korea): 장경각. (Toeng Seongcheol. (1987). ''Jaghireul Baro Bopshida''. Haeinsa Baekryun'am (Korea): Jang'gyung'gak.) {{ISBN|89-85244-11-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=forever&gt;퇴옹 성철. (1988). ''영원한 자유''. 해인사 백련암 (Korea): 장경각. (Toeng Seongcheol. (1988). ''Yongwonhan Jayou''. Haeinsa Baekryun'am (Korea): Jang'gyung'gak.) {{ISBN|89-85244-10-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=correct&gt;퇴옹 성철. (1987). ''선문정로''. 해인사 백련암 (Korea): 장경각. (Toeng Seongcheol. (1987). ''Seon Mun Jung Ro''. Haeinsa Baekryun'am (Korea): Jang'gyung'gak.) {{ISBN|89-85244-14-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hundred&gt;퇴옹 성철. (1992). ''백일법문''. 해인사 백련암 (Korea): 장경각. (Toeng Seongcheol. (1992). ''Baek Il Bupmun''. Haeinsa Baekryun'am (Korea): Jang'gyung'gak.) {{ISBN|89-85244-05-1}}, {{ISBN|89-85244-06-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle Way===
He also expounded on the true definition of the [[Middle Way]] ([[Hangul]]: 중도, [[Hanja]]: 中道), stating that it was not limited to avoiding the two extremes of sensual indulgence and self-mortification as many understood, but that it was also an explanation of the state of [[nirvana]] where all dualities fuse and cease to exist as separate entities, where good and bad, self and non-self become meaningless.  He compared this to the common misconception that had ruled pre-Einsteinian physics, that energy and mass were two separate entities, but which Einstein had elucidated as interchangeable dual forms with the relationship described by ''E=mc²'', thereby proving the equivalence of one to the other.  He also compared this to the fusion of space and time into spacetime, and also formed the analogy of ice and water.  The [[Middle Way]] is not the 'middle' or 'average' of ice and water, but the true form of each, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, and maintained that the state of [[nirvana]] was also like this, a state where the true form of all dualities is revealed as equivalent.&lt;ref name=see/&gt;&lt;ref name=hundred/&gt;

===Gong'an practice===
Seongcheol strongly advocated the [[koan|gong'an]] ([[Hangul]]: 공안, [[Hanja]]: 公案) meditation technique, asserting that it was the fastest and safest way to enlightenment.&lt;ref name=sibong/&gt;&lt;ref name=see/&gt;&lt;ref name=correct/&gt;&lt;ref name=hundred/&gt;  The most common gong'ans he would give to the lay and his followers were:
#Not mind, not a thing, not Buddha, what is this?&lt;ref name=hundred/&gt; ([[Hangul]]: 마음도 아니고, 물건도 아니고, 부처도 아닌 것, 이것이 무엇인고?, [[Hanja]]: 不是心, 不是物, 不是佛, 是什麼?)
#A monk once asked [[Dongshan Shouchu|Dongsan Chan Master]],"What is Buddha?"  Dongsan replied, "Three pounds of flax" ([[Hangul]]: 마삼근, [[Hanja]]: 麻三斤).&lt;ref name=sibong/&gt;&lt;ref name=forever/&gt;&lt;ref name=hundred/&gt;

===In deep sleep, one mind===
Seongcheol also set a clear benchmark that the practitioner could apply to gauge his level of practice.  Throughout his life, many followers came to him to obtain acknowledgement of their enlightenment.  He was dismayed at the number of people who thought they had attained perfect enlightenment by experiencing some mental phenomenon during their practice.  He therefore reiterated that every enlightened person from the Buddha and on had asserted the same definition of what enlightenment is.  True attainment, he quoted, came only after ''going beyond'' the level of being able to meditate in deep sleep.  Only after being able to meditate on a gong'an continuously, without interruption, throughout the waking state, then the dreaming state, and finally in deep sleep, one reaches the state where enlightenment can become possible.  Before any of this, one should never claim to have become enlightened, even though there may be many instances of weird mental phenomena that happens during one's practice.  The levels he identified were:&lt;ref name=see/&gt;&lt;ref name=forever/&gt;&lt;ref name=correct/&gt;&lt;ref name=hundred/&gt;
#'''In the waking state, one mind''' ([[Hangul]]: 동정일여, [[Hanja]]: 動靜一如): the state where the practitioner can meditate on a gong'an continuously throughout the day without interruption, even through talking and thinking.
#'''In the dreaming state, one mind''' ([[Hangul]]: 몽중일여, [[Hanja]]: 夢中一如): the state where the practitioner can meditate on a gong'an continuously in the dreaming state.
#'''In deep sleep, one mind''' ([[Hangul]]: 숙면일여, [[Hanja]]: 熟眠一如): the state described above, where the practitioner can meditate on a gong'an continuously through even the deepest sleep.
#'''In death, attain life''' ([[Hangul]]: 사중득활, [[Hanja]]: 死中得活): from the previous state where all thoughts are overtaken by the gong'an (therefore, the practitioner is considered mentally "dead"), the moment of attaining enlightenment, that is, "life."
#'''Great, round, mirror-like wisdom''' ([[Hangul]]: 대원경지, [[Hanja]]: 大圓鏡智): the state of perfect enlightenment, using the analogy of the bright mirror for the great internal wisdom that comes forth during enlightenment.  The final state where the practitioner loses the sense of self, is liberated from his karma, and therefore, all future rebirths.

===Criticism of the Japanese style of meditation===
Seongcheol was very critical of the [[koan|Japanese style of Zen meditation]].&lt;ref name=see/&gt;&lt;ref name=forever/&gt;&lt;ref name=correct/&gt;&lt;ref name=hundred/&gt;  The Japanese style favors a gradual study of many gong'ans, similar to a curriculum where the practitioner would improve from an easier gong'an to a more difficult one as he mastered each one over time.  Seongcheol, and many other masters,&lt;ref name=yonghwa&gt;[http://www.yonghwasunwon.or.kr/html/bupmun/wonjang1_03.asp 용화선원]&lt;/ref&gt; stated that this would achieve nothing since the whole point of meditation was to rid one's mind of all divergent thoughts, which was the cause of karmic rebirths and its concomitant suffering, by focusing the mind deeply on only one gong'an until it destroyed all other thoughts.  By studying gong'ans like a curriculum, one was only exercising the mind even more, which was diametrically opposed to the original goal of extinguishing the mind.  Thus, this gradual style of meditation was not only similar to [[Jinul]]'s gradual cultivation, it was a complete waste of time to the practitioner in that Zen became nothing more than an exercise in sophistry, with higher positions being given to those who could solve more riddles.  Gong'ans can never be solved with such rational, or even intuitive methods, and only the final, perfect enlightenment could give the solution to the gong'an, and simultaneously all gong'ans.&lt;ref name=see/&gt;&lt;ref name=forever/&gt;&lt;ref name=correct/&gt;&lt;ref name=hundred/&gt;  Therefore, Seongcheol repeatedly made clear that the study of many gong'ans was antithetical to true meditation.  He stated that attaining perfect enlightenment was equal to becoming a Buddha, and this was also equal to definitively solving the gong'an, remarking that this was not his unique teaching, but that of numerous masters including [[Huineng]], [[Mazu Daoyi|Ma Tzu]], all the way down to current masters.&lt;ref name=sibong/&gt;&lt;ref name=net/&gt;&lt;ref name=see/&gt;&lt;ref name=forever/&gt;&lt;ref name=correct/&gt;&lt;ref name=hundred/&gt;&lt;ref name=yonghwa/&gt;  Being able to solve multiple gong'ans was pure delusion believed by many practitioners, and Seongcheol devoted much of his teachings to elucidating this point.

===Quotations===
{{quote|The Buddha said, "I have attained nirvana by relinquishing all dualities.  I have relinquished creation and destruction, life and death, existence and non-existence, good and evil, right and wrong, thereby attaining the Absolute.  This is liberation, this is nirvana.  You [the five initial bikkhus] practice self-mortification and the world indulges in the sensual.  You therefore think you are great and holy, but both extremes are the same.  To truly become free, you must give up both, you must give up all dualities...|Seongcheol|&lt;ref name=net/&gt;}}

{{quote|It's the scientific age, so let's talk in the language of science.  Einstein's general relativity proves that energy and mass, previously thought as separate, are actually one and the same.  Energy ''is'' mass, and mass ''is'' energy.  Energy and mass are one.|Seongcheol|&lt;ref name=net/&gt;}}

{{quote|The fact that energy and mass are equivalent means that nothing is truly created or destroyed.  This is what the Buddha was talking about when he relinquished both creation and destruction.  It is like water and ice.  Water converting into ice and vice versa does not mean that either of them gets destroyed.  It is just the change in the form of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, which itself never changes, just like energy and mass.  If we compare mass to 'form' and energy to 'formlessness,' the Heart sutra says the same thing as general relativity.  Form ''is'' formlessness and formlessness ''is'' form.  Not only in words, not only in the realm of philosophy, but in truth, in nature, measurable by scientific methods.  This is the Middle Way!|Seongcheol|&lt;ref name=net/&gt;}}

{{quote|The three poisons that prevent us from realizing our true selves are desire, anger, and ignorance.  Among those, desire is the basis for the latter two, and desire comes from 'I'.  The attachment to the 'I,' the ego, and the indifference to others, these are the basis of all suffering.  Once you realize that there really is no you or me, self or non-self, you will understand that all things are inter-related, therefore helping others is helping oneself, and hurting others is hurting oneself.  This is the way of the universe, the Middle Way, dependent origination, and karma.|Seongcheol|&lt;ref name=net/&gt;}}

{{quote|Removing the clouds that are blocking our pure light of wisdom, we can become liberated from the chains of karma, thereby becoming truly free.  But how do you do this?  There are many methods, but the fastest is meditation and the fastest of those is the hwadu, or [[koan|gong-an]].  By going beyond the level of being able to meditate in deep sleep, you will reach a place of perfect serenity, your original, bright, shining mirror devoid of all dust that had sat on it.  You will see your original face, your true nature, the nature of the entire universe, and realize that you had always and originally been a Buddha.  This is nirvana.|Seongcheol|&lt;ref name=net/&gt;&lt;ref name=forever/&gt;&lt;ref name=hundred/&gt;}}

{{quote|No one can help you with this endeavor.  No books, no teachers, not even the Buddha.  You must walk this road yourself.
#Do not sleep more than four hours.
#Do not talk more than necessary.
#Do not read books.
#Do not snack.
#Do not wander or travel frequently.|Seongcheol|&lt;ref name=net/&gt;&lt;ref name=forever/&gt;&lt;ref name=hundred/&gt;}}

{{quote|Many practitioners believe that they have attained enlightenment.  Some say they have attained it multiple times.  This is a big delusion.  There is only one true enlightenment, such that the attained state never disappears and then reappears, but is constantly present even through the deepest sleep.  As [[Mazu Daoyi|Ma Tzu]] said, 'attained once, attained forever.'  Any enlightenment that comes and goes or has gradations is nothing more than delusion.|Seongcheol|&lt;ref name=net/&gt;&lt;ref name=forever/&gt;&lt;ref name=hundred/&gt;}}

==Legacy==
Seongcheol played a key role in revitalizing Korean Buddhism which had been in deep disarray from the [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese occupation]].&lt;ref name=sibong/&gt;  He was one of the leaders in the reformation, bringing back celibacy, strict practice, monasticism, and mendicancy back to Korean Buddhism.  Later in his life, with his growing recognition, he helped to rectify Buddhism's discredited reputation amongst the general public, from a group of nominal monks who would get married, own businesses, and frequently collude with the Japanese occupiers, to that of serious practitioners, who never got married, and owned no possessions. Seongcheol also contributed significantly to bringing back [[Huineng]]'s 'sudden enlightenment, sudden cultivation,' and clarified the notions of gong'an practice, meditation, monasticism, and enlightenment.  More than a decade after his death, his books are still widely read and respected, and pilgrimages to [[Haeinsa]] are a mainstay for Buddhists.

A '''social edition''' is a form of textual scholarship that utilizes social media like Wikimedia or blogs to create annotated editions of texts. [[Constance Crompton|Crompton]], [[Alyssa Arbuckle|Arbuckle]] and [[Ray Siemens|Siemens]] describe that "Using social media allows us to integrate a new stage into the editorial process — a stage that fills the gap between an edition’s initial planning stages and its concluding blind peer review, which capitalizes on the engaged knowledge communities inside and outside the academy".&lt;ref&gt;[http://src-online.ca/index.php/src/article/viewFile/118/268 "Understanding the Social Edition Through Iterative Implementation: The Case of the Devonshire MS (BL Add MS 17492),"] with Constance Crompton, Alyssa Arbuckle, and the Devonshire MS Editorial Group. ''Scholarly and Research Communication'' 4.2 (2013). 9 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 22–May 23, 2018, Trump announced and elaborated, without providing evidence, on the existence of this conspiracy via his Twitter account, stating his belief that the previous administration under [[Barack Obama]] paid to plant a spy inside [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|Trump's 2016 presidential campaign]] to assist his rival, [[Hillary Clinton]], win the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 US presidential election]].&lt;ref name=vox1/&gt;&lt;ref name=CNN1&gt;{{cite web |last1=Tatum |first1=Sophie |title=Carter Page: I 'never found anything unusual' in conversations with FBI source |url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/05/22/politics/carter-page-fbi-informant-cnn-tv/index.html |publisher=[[CNN]] |accessdate=2 June 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180523170622/https://edition.cnn.com/2018/05/22/politics/carter-page-fbi-informant-cnn-tv/index.html |archivedate=23 May 2018 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; An FBI informant had approached separately three Trump campaign advisers in 2016 in a covert effort to investigate [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections]], but as of June 7, 2018, no evidence has appeared indicating that this individual attempted to join Trump's campaign.&lt;ref name=WaPo2&gt;{{cite web|title=Secret FBI source for Russia investigation met with three Trump advisers during campaign| first1=Robert| last1=Costa| first2=Carol| last2=Leonnig| first3=Tom| last3=Hamburger| first4=Devlin| last4=Barrett| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/secret-fbi-source-for-russia-investigation-met-with-three-trump-advisers-during-campaign/2018/05/18/9778d9f0-5aea-11e8-b656-a5f8c2a9295d_story.html|work=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=29 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180529204037/https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/secret-fbi-source-for-russia-investigation-met-with-three-trump-advisers-during-campaign/2018/05/18/9778d9f0-5aea-11e8-b656-a5f8c2a9295d_story.html?utm_term=.818bc6887f6f|archivedate=29 May 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Democratic ([[Adam Schiff]]) and Republican ([[Paul Ryan]], [[Trey Gowdy]], [[Tom Rooney (Florida politician)|Tom Rooney]], [[Richard Burr]], [[Jeff Flake]] and [[Marco Rubio]]) Congressmen have dismissed Trump's May 2018 allegations as lacking evidence, and maintained that the FBI did not do anything improper.

In June 2018, Trump again alleged, without providing any evidence, that there was a counter-intelligence operation into the Trump campaign starting from December 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Chait |first=Jonathan |url=http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2018/06/trumps-latest-fbi-conspiracy-theory-is-his-craziest-yet.html |title=Trump's Latest FBI Conspiracy Theory Is His Craziest  Yet |work=New York Magazine |date=5 June 2018 |accessdate=27 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

Trump has been involved in the promotion of a number of conspiracy theories which have lacked meaningful substance. These have included promoting [[Barack Obama citizenship conspiracy theories]] from 2011, claiming that [[Ted Cruz]]'s father was involved in the [[assassination of John F. Kennedy]] in 2016, and claiming that he would have won the popular vote in the 2016 election (in addition to his [[electoral college]] win) if there had not been "millions" of illegal voters in that election cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Evans |first1=Greg |title=8 of the biggest conspiracy theories that Trump has shared |url=https://www.indy100.com/article/donald-trump-us-president-conspiracy-theories-spygate-barack-obama-ted-cruz-8369426 |work=[[The Independent]] |accessdate=9 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WaPo3&gt;{{cite web |last1=Blake |first1=Aaron |title=The No. 1 reason Trump’s ‘spygate’ conspiracy theory doesn’t make sense |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2018/05/23/the-no-1-reason-trumps-spygate-conspiracy-theory-doesnt-make-sense/?noredirect=on |publisher=[[The Washington Post]] |accessdate=3 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trump also made his [[Trump Tower wiretapping allegations]] in 2017, for which the Department of Justice has said evidence has yet to be provided. In January 2018, Trump claimed that texts between FBI employees [[Peter Strzok]] and Lisa Page were tantamount to "treason", but the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' reviewed them and concluded that the texts "show no evidence of a conspiracy against" Trump.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Boot |first1=Max |title=Trump just keeps on lying — because it works |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/global-opinions/wp/2018/06/07/trump-just-keeps-on-lying-because-it-works/ |work=[[The Washington Post]] |accessdate=9 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wilber |first1=Del Quentin |title=Inside the FBI Life of Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, as Told in Their Text Messages |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/inside-the-fbi-life-of-peter-strzok-and-lisa-page-as-told-in-their-text-messages-1517589380?mod=searchresults&amp;page=1&amp;pos=1 |work=[[Wall Street Journal]] |accessdate=9 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Glenn Kessler, Salvador Rizzo and Meg Kelly, writing for ''[[The Washington Post]]'', found that Trump has made over 3,000 false or misleading claims (including repeats) in the first 466 days of his presidency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kessler |first1=Glenn |last2=Rizzo |first2=Salvador |last3=Kelly |first3=Meg |title=President Trump has made 3,001 false or misleading claims so far |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2018/05/01/president-trump-has-made-3001-false-or-misleading-claims-so-far/ |work=[[The Washington Post]] |accessdate=9 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Roberts |first1=Steve |last2=Roberts |first2=Cokie |title=GOP’s silence is the real scandal |url=http://www.albanyherald.com/opinion/steve-cokie-roberts-gop-s-silence-is-the-real-scandal/article_f1795b74-0aa0-5166-aa6d-bd1356ad986b.html |work=[[The Albany Herald]] |accessdate=9 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[NBC News]], around July to August 2016, after Donald Trump had become the Republican nominee for president during the 2016 presidential election, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) "briefed and warned" Trump that foreign adversaries, which included Russia, would probably attempt to spy on and infiltrate his campaign. Trump was told to alert the FBI of any suspicious activity. White House spokesman [[Raj Shah]] acknowledged that "the Republican and Democrat nominee for president received a standardized briefing on counterintelligence" and said that NBC News learned "about the contents of this classified conversation due to an inappropriate leak".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dilanian |first1=Ken |last2=Ainsley |first2=Julia |last3=Lee |first3=Carol |title=FBI warned Trump in 2016 Russians would try to infiltrate his campaign |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/fbi-warned-trump-2016-russians-would-try-infiltrate-his-campaign-n830596 |publisher=[[NBC News]] |accessdate=2 June 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180423134603/https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/fbi-warned-trump-2016-russians-would-try-infiltrate-his-campaign-n830596 |archivedate=23 April 2018 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 16, 2018, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported the existence of a 2016 FBI investigation called Crossfire Hurricane, which investigated whether individuals within the Trump campaign had links to Russian efforts to undermine the presidential election. Four individuals, [[Michael T. Flynn]], [[Paul Manafort]], [[Carter Page]] and [[George Papadopoulos]], were initially investigated due to obvious or suspected Russian ties.&lt;ref name=NYT2&gt;{{cite web |last1=Apuzzo |first1=Matt |last2=Goldman |first2=Adam |last3=Fandos |first3=Nicholas |title=Code Name Crossfire Hurricane: The Secret Origins of the Trump Investigation |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/16/us/politics/crossfire-hurricane-trump-russia-fbi-mueller-investigation.html |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=2 June 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180601134038/https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/16/us/politics/crossfire-hurricane-trump-russia-fbi-mueller-investigation.html |archivedate=1 June 2018 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the investigation, the FBI "obtained phone records and other documents using [[national security letters]], a secret type of subpoena". ''The New York Times'' also reported that FBI agents (believing that Trump would lose the election and cognizant of Trump's claims that the election was rigged against him) took extreme care and caution to keep the investigation secret as they feared that Trump would blame his defeat on the revelation of the investigation.&lt;ref name=NYT2/&gt; 

On May 17, 2018, Trump quoted ''[[National Review]]'' columnist [[Andrew C. McCarthy]], who had said: "There's probably no doubt that [the FBI] had at least one confidential informant in the [Trump] campaign". From that quote, Trump described that "word seems to be coming out that the Obama FBI SPIED ON THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN ... If so, this is bigger than [[Watergate]]!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Manchester |first1=Julia |title=Trump: Report that Obama FBI spied on campaign could be 'bigger than Watergate' |url=http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/388101-trump-report-that-obama-fbi-spied-on-campaign-could-be-bigger-than |publisher=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]] |accessdate=2 June 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180519150403/http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/388101-trump-report-that-obama-fbi-spied-on-campaign-could-be-bigger-than |archivedate=19 May 2018 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although an FBI informant, [[Stefan Halper]], spoke separately to three Trump campaign advisers (Carter Page, [[Sam Clovis]] and George Papadopoulos) in 2016 in an effort to investigate [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections]], there is no evidence that Halper actually tried to join Trump's campaign. Page said that he "had extensive discussions" with Halper on "a bunch of different foreign-policy-related topics". Clovis's attorney said that Clovis and Halper had discussed China during their sole meeting. Papadopoulos was paid $3,000 by Halper for a research paper on the oil fields of Turkey, Israel and Cyprus.&lt;ref name=WaPo2/&gt;

== Trump and his allies' allegations ==

=== May 2018 ===
On May 22, 2018, Trump expanded on McCarthy's theory, alleging that the [[Barack Obama]] administration had paid to plant a spy inside the 2016 Trump presidential campaign "very early on" to assist Trump's rival, [[Hillary Clinton]], win the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 US presidential election]].&lt;ref name=vox1/&gt;&lt;ref name=CNN1/&gt; From May 23, 2018, Trump began to describe his allegations as Spygate.&lt;ref name=NYT1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=DeCosta-Klipa |first1=Nik |title=This Donald Trump tweet might have caused some confusion for Patriots fans |url=https://www.boston.com/news/politics/2018/05/23/donald-trump-spygate |website=[[Boston.com]] |accessdate=1 June 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180524000912/https://www.boston.com/news/politics/2018/05/23/donald-trump-spygate |archivedate=24 May 2018 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WaPo1/&gt; The [[Associated Press]] reported that Trump privately said that he wanted "to brand" the informant as a "spy" as using a more nefarious term would supposedly resonate more with the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Jalonick |first1=Mary |last2=Lemire |first2=Jonathan |title=Seething over Russia probe, Trump tears into ‘spygate’ |url=https://apnews.com/23b9456c12484b6cb31c93da269a6159/Seething-over-Russia-probe,-Trump-tears-into-%27spygate |publisher=[[Associated Press]] |accessdate=2 June 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180603051743/https://apnews.com/23b9456c12484b6cb31c93da269a6159/Seething-over-Russia-probe,-Trump-tears-into-%27spygate |archivedate=3 June 2018 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the May 22 tweets, Trump wrote that Halper, the FBI informant, was paid a "massive amount of money", and concluded that he thus must be a spy implanted for "political purposes". However, the $1 million in contracts were signed between Halper (a professor in international security) and the [[United States Department of Defense]]'s [[Office of Net Assessment]] between 2012 to 2016, with 40% of the money awarded before Trump announced his candidacy in 2015.

In the May 23 tweets, Trump published a false quote attributed to former [[Director of National Intelligence]] [[James Clapper]] that "Trump should be happy that the FBI was SPYING on his campaign". Instead, when asked "was the FBI spying on Trump’s campaign", Clapper had said, "No, they were not." What Clapper really said Trump should have been happy about was that the FBI was investigating “what the Russians were doing” and "were the Russians infiltrating" his campaign and trying to influence the election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kiely |first1=Eugene |title=Trump Misquotes Clapper on FBI ‘Spy’ |url=https://www.factcheck.org/2018/05/trump-misquotes-clapper-on-fbi-spy/ |website=[[FactCheck.org]] |accessdate=2 June 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180531020644/https://www.factcheck.org/2018/05/trump-misquotes-clapper-on-fbi-spy/ |archivedate=31 May 2018 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 26, 2018, Trump questioned "why didn’t the crooked highest levels of the FBI or “Justice” contact me to tell me of the phony Russia problem?" However, according to NBC News, Trump was warned by the FBI around July to August 2016 about possible Russian espionage and infiltration into his campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Greenwood |first1=Max |title=Trump: Why didn't FBI tell me about 'phony Russia problem' during campaign |url=http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/389523-trump-why-didnt-fbi-tell-me-about-phone-russia-problem-during |publisher=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]] |accessdate=2 June 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180528072945/http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/389523-trump-why-didnt-fbi-tell-me-about-phone-russia-problem-during |archivedate=28 May 2018 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 25, ''The Washington Post'' wrote that several conservative sources have sided with Trump to embrace and promote Spygate, including the ''[[Fox &amp; Friends]]'' talk show and political commentators [[Tucker Carlson]] and [[Sean Hannity]] for Fox News, the website [[Breitbart]], and also radio show host [[Rush Limbaugh]]. Meanwhile, [[Infowars]] host [[Alex Jones]] took credit for coining the "Spygate" term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Farhi |first1=Paul |title=‘Spygate’?

Asked on whether the promotion of the Spygate theory is meant to discredit the [[Special Counsel investigation (2017–present)|special counsel investigation]], Trump’s attorney [[Rudy Giuliani]] said on May 27 that the investigators "are giving us the material to do it. Of course, we have to do it in defending the president ... it is for public opinion" on whether to "impeach or not impeach" Trump.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://fortune.com/2018/05/28/rudy-giuliani-spygate-mueller-investigation/|title='It Is for Public Opinion.'

=== June 2018 ===
On June 5, Trump declared that "SPYGATE is in full force!", claiming without providing any evidence that "[[Peter Strzok|Strzok]]-Page, the incompetent &amp; corrupt FBI lovers, have texts referring to a counter-intelligence operation into the Trump Campaign dating way back to December, 2015."&lt;ref name=nymag1&gt;{{cite web |last1=Chait |first1=Jonathan |title=Trump’s Latest FBI Conspiracy Theory Is His Craziest Yet |url=http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2018/06/trumps-latest-fbi-conspiracy-theory-is-his-craziest-yet.html |work=[[New York Magazine]] |accessdate=June 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the December 2015 texts do not make any reference to the Trump campaign or Russia.&lt;ref name=CNN2&gt;{{cite web |last1=Herb |first1=Jeremy |last2=Raju |first2=Manu |title=From Reddit to Trump: How the President latched onto a conspiracy theory |url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/06/06/politics/trump-fbi-texts-conspiracy-theory/index.html |publisher=[[CNN]] |accessdate=June 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This particular conspiracy theory promoted by Trump was traced by media outlets to originate from a Twitter user called @Nick_Falco, who on June 4 posted about the words "oconus lures" in December 2015 texts between FBI employees Peter Strzok and Lisa Page. While "oconus" refers to "outside the continental United States", Falco inferred that "lures" refer to spies.&lt;ref name=nymag1/&gt;&lt;ref name="axios1"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kight |first1=Stef |title=Go deeper: Digging into Trump’s latest "Spygate" tweet |url=https://www.axios.com/trump-tweets-spygate-strzok-page-gateway-pundit-conspiracy-5fa36da4-d07a-454b-8aba-4e30fe5fc651.html |publisher=[[Axios.com]] |accessdate=June 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to the [[United States Department of Justice]], "lures" refer to "subterfuge to entice a criminal defendant to leave a foreign country so that he or she can be arrested".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=9-15.630 - Lures |url=https://www.justice.gov/usam/usam-9-15000-international-extradition-and-related-matters#9-15.630 |publisher=[[United States Department of Justice]] |accessdate=June 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Falco questioned if "the FBI wanted to run a baited Sting Op using foreign agents against Trump", despite none of the texts mentioning the Trump campaign or Russia.&lt;ref name=CNN2/&gt;
Also on June 4, Falco's tweet spread to the ''r/conspiracy'' forum on [[Reddit]], and also [[The Gateway Pundit]], a far-right, pro-Trump website which has published multiple false conspiracy theories.&lt;ref name=nymag1/&gt;&lt;ref name="axios1"/&gt; The Gateway Pundit wrote an article entitled: "Breaking: Senate releases unredacted texts showing FBI initiated MULTIPLE SPIES in Trump campaign in December 2015".&lt;ref name=vox2&gt;{{cite web |last1=Beauchamp |first1=Zack |title=Trump, Fox News, and Twitter have created a dangerous conspiracy theory loop |url=https://www.vox.com/world/2018/6/6/17433876/trump-spygate-fox-twitter |website=[[Vox (website)|Vox]] |accessdate=June 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the texts referenced by Falco were publicly released by a Senate committee  months earlier in February 2018.&lt;ref name="axios1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=CNN2/&gt; On June 5, [[Lou Dobbs]] of [[Fox Business]] said that "the FBI may have initiated a number of spies into the Trump campaign as early as December of 2015." Dobbs' interviewee on the show, Chris Farrell, agreed that the existence of an "intelligence operation directed against then-candidate Trump" was "indisputable". Trump's June 5 tweet on Spygate came less than an hour after Dobbs' interview, with Trump also tweeting praise of Dobbs for the "great interview".&lt;ref name=CNN2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hill |first1=James |last2=Bruggeman |first2=Lucien |title='Oconus lures': Evolution of a conspiracy theory, from Reddit to the White House |url=https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/oconus-lures-evolution-conspiracy-theory-reddit-white-house/story?id=55730297 |publisher=[[ABC News]] |accessdate=8 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Trump made his June 5 tweet, Fox News described the news as "New Strzok-Page texts released", with Fox News television host [[Laura Ingraham]] saying: "It certainly appears they were looking to put more lures into the campaign in 2015." Republican Representative [[Ron DeSantis]], a panelist on Ingraham's show, agreed that it was  "clear" that the FBI investigation into Trump started earlier than July 2016.&lt;ref name=CNN2/&gt;&lt;ref name=vox2/&gt;

==Reactions and criticism== 

=== May 2018 allegations ===
[[Trey Gowdy]], the Republican chairman of the [[House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform]], said after a classified meeting with Department of Justice officials that "the FBI is doing what [Trump] told them to do ... I am even more convinced that the FBI did exactly what my fellow citizens would want them to do when they got the information they got, and that it has nothing to do with Donald Trump".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=MacCallum |first1=Martha |title=Gowdy on Trump's Spy Claims: I'm 'Convinced' FBI Did What Americans Would Want Them to Do |url=http://insider.foxnews.com/2018/05/29/donald-trump-russia-probe-gowdy-says-he-should-be-upset-democrats-obama-not-fbi |publisher=[[Fox News]] |accessdate=1 June 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180601070149/http://insider.foxnews.com/2018/05/29/donald-trump-russia-probe-gowdy-says-he-should-be-upset-democrats-obama-not-fbi |archivedate=1 June 2018 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fellow Republicans, [[Paul Ryan]], [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives]], and [[Richard Burr]], chairman of the [[Senate Intelligence Committee]], have supported Gowdy's assessment of the situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Demirjian |first1=Karoun |last2=DeBonis |first2=Mike |title=Paul Ryan splits with Trump, says ‘no evidence’ FBI spied on president’s campaign |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/paul-ryan-splits-with-trump-says-no-evidence-fbi-spied-on-presidents-campaign/2018/06/06/c8bab620-6998-11e8-bea7-c8eb28bc52b1_story.html |work=[[The Washington Post]] |accessdate=June 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Republican Representative [[Tom Rooney (Florida politician)|Tom Rooney]], who is on the [[House Intelligence Committee]], chided Trump for creating "this thing to tweet about knowing that it’s not true ...

Representative [[Adam Schiff]], the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, has said that Spygate is "lie-gate", a "piece of propaganda the president wants to put out and repeat". He accused President Trump of repeatedly spreading baseless lies by quoting that "people are saying ..." or "we’ve been told ..."&lt;ref name=reuters1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Samuels |first1=Brett |title=Top Intel Dem: This isn't 'spygate,' it's 'liegate' |url=http://thehill.com/homenews/house/389166-top-intel-dem-this-isnt-spygate-its-liegate |publisher=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]] |accessdate=8 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Hayden (general)|Michael Hayden]], a retired [[General (United States)|general]], former [[Director of the National Security Agency]] and former [[Director of the Central Intelligence Agency]], said that Trump, through Spygate, was "simply trying to delegitimize the Mueller investigation, the FBI, the Department of Justice, and he’s willing to throw almost anything against the wall".&lt;ref name=sentinel1/&gt;

Journalist [[Shepard Smith]] has said that "[[Fox News]] can confirm that Spygate is not" true; "Fox News knows of no evidence to support the president's claim. Lawmakers from both parties say using an informant to investigate is not spying. It’s part of the normal investigative process."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bort |first1=Ryan |title=Even Conservatives Are Realizing Trump's 'Spygate' Conspiracy Is a Hoax |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/why-trump-spygate-conspiracy-w520889 |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |accessdate=1 June 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180531004720/https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/why-trump-spygate-conspiracy-w520889 |archivedate=31 May 2018 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Legal analyst [[Andrew Napolitano]] concurred in telling Fox News that the FBI's usage of an informant was being done "all the time" and thus "stunningly unremarkable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Judge Nap: Giuliani Shouldn't Make 'Outlandish &amp; Outrageous' Spy Allegations Without Evidence |url=http://insider.foxnews.com/2018/05/30/napolitano-giuliani-shouldnt-make-outlandish-outrageous-spy-allegations-without-evidence |publisher=[[Fox News]] |accessdate=1 June 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180603051743/http://insider.foxnews.com/2018/05/30/napolitano-giuliani-shouldnt-make-outlandish-outrageous-spy-allegations-without-evidence |archivedate=3 June 2018 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jon Meacham]], a presidential historian, has said, in regards to Spygate, "The effect on the life of the nation of a president inventing conspiracy theories in order to distract attention from legitimate investigations or other things he dislikes is corrosive".&lt;ref name=NYT1/&gt;

Aaron Blake, writing for ''[[The Washington Post]]'', wrote that the "central problem" of the Spygate conspiracy theory is the "fact that these people who supposedly would do anything to stop Trump ... didn't." In the period before the election, the FBI "didn't use the information it had collected to actually prevent Trump from becoming president", as it did not publicly reveal it was already investigating links between George Papadopoulos, Carter Page, Paul Manafort and Russia. Rather, the reports before the election were that the FBI saw no clear link between Russia and the Trump campaign, instead believing that Russia was trying to disrupt the election without purposely trying to elect Trump.&lt;ref name=WaPo3/&gt;

Steven Poole, writing for ''[[The Guardian]]'', wrote that the real scandal was Trump even using the [[List of scandals with "-gate" suffix|"-gate"]] suffix for the issue, as the Spygate allegations are about "purely imaginary things".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Poole |first1=Steven |title=Spygate: why Donald Trump’s use of ‘gate’ is a scandal |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/31/word-of-the-week-steven-poole-spygate |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From May 31 to June 5, 2018, [[Quinnipiac University]] conducted a national poll of 1,223 voting Americans regarding the Spygate allegations. With the margin for error being 3.4%, a majority of 56% believe that the FBI's usage of a confidential informant was "routine procedure", while 33% agree with Trump that the FBI was spying on the Trump campaign. The only group of voters with a majority believing Trump are Republicans at 66%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wise |first1=Justin |title=Poll: Majority says Trump's 'spygate' claims not accurate |url=http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/gop-primaries/84071-crist-says-he-would-not-scrap-entire-health-bill |publisher=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]] |accessdate=14 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=June 8, 2018 - U.S. Voters Oppose Steel Tariff, Back China Levy, Quinnipiac University National Poll Finds; FBI Did Not Spy On Trump Campaign, Voters Say |url=https://poll.qu.edu/search-releases/search-results/release-detail?What=&amp;strArea=6;0;&amp;strTime=28&amp;ReleaseID=2547#Question009 |publisher=[[Quinnipiac University]] |accessdate=14 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== June 2018 allegations ===
The [[New York (magazine)|''New York'' magazine]] addressed the June 2018 allegations by stating: "It’s not surprising or scandalous that FBI agents would be using espionage tradecraft. Gateway Pundit seems to have invented the crucial factual element of the conspiracy out of thin air" while "Trump is citing right-wing conspiracy theorists who operate at a full level further removed from reality than the right-wing conspiracy theorists he customarily cites."&lt;ref name=nymag1/&gt;

Zack Beauchamp of ''[[Vox (website)|Vox]]'' wrote about the situation which was "entirely unfounded in the actual evidence" is that "Fox picks up on some random internet rumor, the president picks it up from Fox, and then Fox and other right-wing outlets leap to defend what the president tweeted, which only reinforces Trump’s sense that he’s right."&lt;ref name=vox2/&gt;

'''''The Denationalization of Money''''' is a 1976 book by [[Friedrich Hayek]], in which the author advocated the establishment of competitively issued private moneys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Looking ahead to the digital imperatives|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=WT&amp;p_theme=wt&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB0F3B2161A54F1&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM|accessdate=28 January 2013|newspaper=Washington Times|date=July 18, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978 Hayek published a revised and enlarged edition entitled '''''Denationalization of Money: The Argument Refined''''', where he speculated that rather than entertaining an unmanageable number of currencies, markets would converge on one or only a limited number of monetary standards, on which institutions would base the issue of their notes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boettke|first=Peter J.|title=The legacy of Friedrich von Hayek, Volume 1|year=2000|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|isbn=1858982995|pages=363, 374|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=rzcGUbeEE4jq0AGlvIDQAg&amp;id=kkC6AAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=%22Denationalization+of+Money%22+Hayek&amp;q=%22Denationalization+of+Money%22+#search_anchor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
According to Hayek, instead of a national government issuing a specific currency, use of which is imposed on all members of its economy by force in the form of legal tender laws, private businesses should be allowed to issue their own forms of money, deciding how to do so on their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ron Paul, Upping the Ante in His Campaign for Liberty, Hoists the Flag of Hayek|url=http://www.nysun.com/opinion/ron-paul-upping-the-ante-in-his-campaign/87502/|publisher=New York Sun|accessdate=28 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;“There is no justification in history for the existing position of a government monopoly of issuing money. It has never been proposed on the ground that government will give us better money than anybody else could.” See [https://mises.org/books/denationalisation.pdf''here'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Hayek advocates a system of private currency in which financial institutions create currencies that compete for acceptance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schramm|first=Helmar|title=Instruments in Art and Science|year=2008|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=3110202409|page=451|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HP-FNOpBCGUC&amp;pg=PA451&amp;dq=%22Denationalization+of+Money%22+Hayek&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TTQGUd2PCrS50AGJuoG4CQ&amp;ved=0CGUQ6AEwCTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Denationalization%20of%20Money%22%20Hayek&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stability in value is presumed to be the decisive factor for acceptance. Hayek makes the assumption that competition will favor currencies with the greatest stability in value since a devalued currency hurts creditors, and an upward-revalued currency hurts debtors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ferris|first=J. Stephen|author2=John A. Galbraith |title=On Hayek's denationalization of money, free banking and inflation targeting|journal=European Journal of the History of Economic Thought|year=2006|volume=13|issue=13|pages=213–231|doi=10.1080/09672560600708359}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence users would choose the monies which they expected to offer a mutually acceptable intersection between depreciation and appreciation. Hayek suggests that institutions may find through experimentation that an extensive basket of commodities forms the ideal monetary base. Institutions would issue and regulate their currency primarily through loan-making, and secondarily through currency buying and selling activities. It is postulated that the financial press would report daily information on whether institutions are managing their currencies within a previously-defined tolerance. Hayek's effort has been cited by economists [[George Selgin]], [[Richard Timberlake]], and [[Lawrence H. White|Lawrence White]].

==Criticism==
Economist [[Milton Friedman]] was critical of Hayek's writings of the 1970s on monetary reform. Noting Hayek's vigorous defense of "invisible hand" evolution that Hayek claimed has created better economic institutions than could be created by rational design, Friedman pointed out the irony that Hayek was then proposing to replace the monetary system thus created with a deliberate construct of his own design. Moreover, Friedman noted, there is nothing in current law to prevent voluntary bilateral exchange via any medium freely accepted by two parties.&lt;ref name="Money in Historical Perspective"&gt;{{cite book|last=Friedman and Schwartz|first=Milton and Anna J.|title=Has Government Any Role in Money?|year=1987|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=0-226-74228-8|page=312|url=https://www.nber.org/books/schw87-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1977 review of the book, economist David H. Howard also noted that Hayek neglected to address the extent to which existing monetary institutions evolved to meet real economic needs. Furthermore, Howard states, Hayek's regime of competitive moneys may result in the establishment of a new monopoly similar to the existing system. According to Howard, Hayek did not consider the real costs and other inefficiencies of a system of competing monies that might lead to such an outcome.&lt;ref name=Howard&gt;{{cite web|last=Howard|first=David H.|title=The Denationalization of Money: A Review|url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/ifdp/1977/102/ifdp102.pdf|work=Journal of Monetary Economics|accessdate=31 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Austrian School]] economist [[Lawrence H. White]] was critical of Hayek's assumption that the most stable currencies would win market acceptance.&lt;ref name="Larry White"&gt;{{cite web|last=White|first=Lawrence|title=Larry White on Hayek and Money|url=http://www.econtalk.org/archives/2010/02/larry_white_on.html|publisher=Library of Economics and Liberty|accessdate=31 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Trungpa [[tulku]]''' are a line of incarnate [[Tibet]]an [[lama]]s who traditionally head Surmang monastery complex in [[Kham]], now [[Surmang]]. The three heads of the Zurmang [[Kagyu]] are known as GharTengTrungSum (Gharwang, Tenga, Trungpa), and the lineage holder of the Zurmang Kagyu is [[Zurmang Gharwang Rinpoche]]. There have been twelve such Trungpa tulkus. [[Mahasiddha]] Trungmase, 1st Zurmang Gharwang Rinpoche, was the teacher of Künga Gyaltsen, 1st Trungpa Tulku.

==Line of the Trungpa tulkus==
# Künga Gyaltsen (15th century)
# [[Künga Sangpo]] (born 1464)
# [[Künga Öser]] (15th and 16th centuries)
# [[Künga Namgyal]] (1567–1629)
# [[Tenpa Namgyal]] (1633–1712)
# [[Tendzin Chökyi Gyatso]] (1715–1761)
# [[Jampal Chökyi Gyatso]] (1763–1768)
# [[Gyurme Thenphel]] (born 1771)
# [[Tenpa Rabgye]] (19th century)
# [[Chökyi Nyinche]] (1879–1939)
# [[Chögyam Trungpa]] (Chökyi Gyamtso, 1940–1987) was one of the most influential teachers of [[Buddhism]] in the west. He is the founder of [[Shambhala Buddhism]].
# Chökyi Sengay (Sengye/Senge, [[Choseng Trungpa]], born February 6, 1989). Chokyi Sengay is the present Trungpa tülku.

== Chökyi Nyinche ==
According to Fabrice Midal, the tenth Trungpa tulku rejected his role as fundraiser for the Surmang monasteries and preferred to live as a disciplined meditation practitioner. At one point, to escape his duties as the figurehead of the monastery complex, he ran away on foot to study with [[Jamgon Kongtrul]]. He studied with Kongtrul Rinpoche for many years before returning to Surmang, and at that point had the reputation of a realized teacher. [[Dilgo Khyentse]] and the second Jamgon Kongtrul of Sechen studied with him. They later became the direct teachers of the eleventh Trungpa tulku.&lt;ref&gt;Midal (2004) p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of a '''Universal reason''' implies an underpinning system of [[perception]] and [[Conception (idea)|conception]] of all forms of complexity. Many [[philosophers]] over the years have dealt with or relate to this idea in their writings. In recent years, the idea of a universal reason has been brought up in discussions of [[artificial intelligence]] and other topics regarding consciousness for it provides a stage of universality for a mechanistic description of [[thought]].

'''Verity''' (''alias'' Veretie, Verety, Verita, Veritie, etc.) is a female first name and a surname. As a first name it derives from the Latin feminine noun ''veritas'', meaning "[[truth]]". It is thus an equivalent of [[Alethea]], a female first name first used in England ''circa'' 1585, derived from the ancient and modern Greek feminine noun ''αλήθεια'' (pronounced "al-'''ee'''-thia"), meaning "truth". It was adopted in England as a [[Puritan]] [[virtue name]], truthfulness being considered as a desirable attribute especially in a female. Verity was one of the most popular first names given to girls in Australia.{{when|date=October 2014}} It is especially associated with parts of [[Yorkshire]] and [[Northern England]]. Verity is also a surname, which may have more ancient unrelated origins, possibly being a corruption of a similar word.&lt;ref&gt;Surnames had been adopted by families in England centuries before the Puritan era&lt;/ref&gt; Notable people with the name include:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4152">'''Wholistic reference''' is reference to the whole—with respect to the context. In its strongest, unqualified form, '''the principle of wholistic reference''' is the [[proposition]] that each and every proposition, regardless how limited the referents of its [[non-logical symbol|non-logical]] or content terms, refers to the whole of its [[universe of discourse]]. According to this principle every proposition of [[number theory]], even an equational proposition such as 5 + 7 = 12, refers not only to the individual numbers that it happens to mention but to the whole universe of numbers.  The relation verb ‘refers’ is being used in its broad sense (loosely “is about”) and not as a synonym for ‘names’ in the sense of “is a name of”.

[[George Boole]] (1815–1864) introduced this principle into modern logic: Even though he changed from a monistic fixed-universe framework in his 1840s writings to a pluralistic multiple-universe framework in 1854,&lt;ref&gt;[[John Corcoran (logician)|Corcoran, John]], and [[José Miguel Sagüillo|Sagüillo, José Miguel]], 2011. “The Absence of Multiple Universes of Discourse in the 1936 Tarski Consequence-Definition Paper”, ''History and Philosophy of Logic'' 32: 359–80.&lt;/ref&gt; he never wavered in his frank avowal of the principle of wholistic reference.  Indeed, he took it as an essential accompaniment to his theory of concept formation and proposition formation. For Boole, the essential first step in the process of conceiving of a proposition preliminary to making a judgement of its truth or falsity – or even using it in a deduction, however hypothetically – was to conceive of the universe of discourse. See Boole 1854/2003, xxi, 27, 42, 43.&lt;ref&gt;[[George Boole]]. 1854/2003. ''The Laws of Thought.'' Facsimile of 1854 edition, with an introduction by J. Corcoran. Buffalo: Prometheus Books (2003). Reviewed by James van Evra in ''Philosophy in Review'' 24 (2004): 167–169.&lt;/ref&gt; One statement of his principle is in the sentence immediately following his definition of universe of discourse, which is his first use of the expression 'universe of discourse' and probably the first in the history of the English language. See the next section.

Similar views, perhaps not similarly motivated, are found in later logicians, including [[Gottlob Frege]] (1848–1925).  Some recent formulations of standard one-sorted first-order logic seem to be in accord with a form of it, if they do not actually imply the principle itself.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Corcoran (logician)|Corcoran, John]]. Principle of Wholistic Reference. ''Manuscrito'' 27 (2004): 155–166.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Boole’s 1854 definition==
{{Quote|text=
In every discourse, whether of the mind conversing with its own thoughts, or of the individual in his intercourse with others, there is an assumed or expressed limit within which the subjects of its operation are confined. The most unfettered discourse is that in which the words we use are understood in the widest possible application, and for them the limits of discourse are co-extensive with those of the universe itself. But more usually we confine ourselves to a less spacious field. Sometimes, in discoursing of men we imply (without expressing the limitation) that it is of men only under certain circumstances and conditions that we speak, as of civilized men, or of men in the vigour of life, or of men under some other condition or relation. Now, whatever may be the extent of the field within which all the objects of our discourse are found, that field may properly be termed the universe of discourse. Furthermore, this universe of discourse is in the strictest sense the ultimate subject of the discourse. |author=[[George Boole]]|source=&lt;ref&gt;Page 42: [[George Boole]]. 1854/2003.

The '''World Kindness Movement''' ('''WKM''') is the peak global kindness body, a movement with no religious, political or commercial affiliation. The WKM’s chief object is to foster goodwill among the broad community – local, national and international – by way of collaborations in kindness and in so doing, create greater understanding and co-operation between all people and all nations throughout the world. WKM is a worldwide coalition of the Good-Willing various ''kindness movements''—organizations that study and promote improved individual and collective human behavior. The movement was initially conceptualized in 1997 with the aim of bringing like minded kindness movements across the globe together. The current members of the movement represent 27 nations including Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, India, Italy, Japan, Liberia, Nepal, Malaysia, Mexico, Netherlands, Pakistan, New Zealand, Nigeria, Oman, Romania, Scotland, South Korea, South Africa, Switzerland, Thailand, United Arab Emirates, Ukraine, United Kingdom and 10 organisations from the USA.

== History ==

The idea of a World Kindness Movement was conceived at a Tokyo conference in 1996 when founders of the Small Kindness Movement in Japan brought together like-minded individuals from around the world who had started kindness movements in their own countries. They were led by Dr. [[Wataru Mori]], a physician in Tokyo, who envisioned that a more compassionate and peaceful world could be achieved if a critical mass of acts of kindness was ignited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Sweet Milk of Human Kindness | date=7 May 2009 | publisher=Africa News}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:CosmosBipinnatus002.JPG|thumb|170px|[[Cosmos bipinnatus]], official flower of the World Kindness Movement]]
A second conference was held in 1997 in which the World Kindness Movement was formed. The founding members of the movement were Japan, Singapore, Australia, Canada, Thailand, the United Kingdom and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Celebrating kindness |url=http://www.hindu.com/2001/06/10/stories/1310046b.htm| accessdate=4 January 2013 | date=10 June 2001 | publisher=[[The Hindu]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Yokoji Zen Mountain Center''' is a '''year-round''' [[Zen Buddhist]] training and retreat center located in the [[San Jacinto Mountains]] of Southern California.  It is a 160 acres (65 hectares) of sacred Native American land and wilderness.

Founded 1981 by [[Taizan Maezumi]], Roshi as a summer retreat center for the [[Zen Center of Los Angeles]].  [[Charles Tenshin Fletcher]], Roshi who received [[Dharma transmission]] from [[Taizan Maezumi]] in the White Plum [[Zen]] Lineage is the teacher and abbot. His successor, David Jokai Blackwell, serves as vice-abbot.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.zmc.org/jokai&lt;/ref&gt;

When Yokoji Zen Mountain Center was founded, the formal name of the temple was Dounzan Yokoji.  Doun refers to the honorary founder, Shiomi Doun, Roshi; Zan means mountain; and Yokoji means sunlight temple.  Commonly the Center was known by the name of '''Zen Mountain Center''' and in 2006 it returned to the lineage root name, Yokoji Zen Mountain Center to prevent confusion with other Zen centers.

Yokoji Zen Mountain Center is open to people in all spiritual traditions and walks of life.  The Center has full-time residential training programs, as well as regularly scheduled silent meditation retreats ([[sesshin]]). Home practice is also supported by coming to the Center for periods of intensive practice as well and local practice with one of the affiliated sitting groups.  Affiliated sitting groups are located in:

* [[Los Angeles, California]]
* [[Pasadena, California]]
* [[Long Beach, California]]
* [[Boca Raton, Florida]]
* [[Mexico City, Mexico]]
* [[Liverpool, England]]
* [[Wellington, New Zealand]]
* [[Mendoza, Argentina]]

The buildings and grounds of the Center were developed with ecological principles in concept and construction.  It is an alternative power community and serves as the ecological model for the EarthWitness Foundation.
