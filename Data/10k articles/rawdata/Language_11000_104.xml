      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2283">'''Augustin Chaho''' in French or '''Agosti Xaho''' in Basque was an important [[Romanticism|Romantic]] [[Basque language|Basque]] writer. He was born in [[Tardets]] (Atharratze in basque), [[Soule]], French [[Basqueland]] on 10 October 1811 and died in [[Bayonne]] (Baiona in Basque), [[Labourd]] 23 October 1858. It is usually said that he studied in Paris with [[Charles Nodier]].

He wrote ''Travel to Navarre during the insurrection of the Basques (1830-1835)'' (1836, in French, on his experiences in the [[First Carlist War]], which he interprets as an ethnic war of Basques against Spain), ''The Legend of [[Aitor]]'' (in which he invented a national [[creation myth]], that had great acceptance for some time) and ''Azti-Begia'' (''The Soothsayer's Eye'' in [[Souletin]] [[Basque language|Basque]]).

He was a [[French Republic|republican]] supporter, and became councillor in Bayonne and the [[Basses-Pyrénées]] department. He headed the [[Revolutions of 1848 in France|revolution of 1848]] in Bayonne. After the Bonapartist [[French coup of 1851|coup of 1851]], he escaped to [[Vitoria, Spain|Vitoria]] (Gasteiz in Basque), in [[Alava]], Spanish Basqueland.

'''Bijago''' or '''Bidyogo''' is the language of the [[Bissagos Islands|Bissagos Archipelago]] of [[Guinea-Bissau]]. There are some difficulties of grammar and intelligibility between dialects, with the Kamona dialect being unintelligible to the others.

Dialects are as follows:

* Anhaki on Canhabaque ([[Roxa]]) Island
* Kagbaaga on [[Bubaque]] Island
* Kajoko on [[Orango]] and [[Uno (Guinea-Bissau)|Uno]] Islands.
* Kamona on the northern [[Caravela (Guinea-Bissau)|Caravela]] and [[Carache]] Islands

==Characteristics==

The Kajoko dialect is one of the few in the world known to use a [[linguolabial consonant]], the voiced stop {{IPA|[d̼]}}, in its basic sound system (Olson et al. 2009).

==Classification==
Bijago is highly divergent. Sapir (1971) classified it as an isolate within the [[West Atlantic languages|West Atlantic family]]. However, Segerer showed that this is primarily due to unrecognized sound changes, and that Bijago is in fact close to the [[Bak languages]]. For example, the following cognates in Bijago and [[Kasa language|Joola Kasa]] (a Bak language) are completely regular, but had not previously been identified (Segerer 2010):

'''Yetfa''' and '''Biksi''' (Biaksi) are dialects of a language spoken in [[West Papua (region)|West Papua]], [[Indonesia]], and across the border in [[Papua New Guinea]]. It's a trade language in West Papua up to the PNG border.

The language is not close to others.  Ross (2005), following Laycock &amp; Z’Graggen (1975), places Biksi in its own branch of the [[Sepik languages|Sepik]] family, but there is little data to base a classification on.  The similarities noted by Laycock are sporadic and may simply be loans; Ross based his classification on pronouns, but they are dissimilar enough for the connection to be uncertain. Usher found it to be a Southern Pauwasi language. According to Hammarström (2008), it's being passed on to children and is not in immediate danger.

The '''Bongo–Bagirmi''' or '''Sara–Bongo–Bagirmi''' languages are the major branch of the [[Central Sudanic languages|Central Sudanic language family]] with about forty languages. Principal groups include [[Bagirmi languages]] such as [[Naba language|Naba]] and the [[Sara languages]].

==Languages==
The Bongo–Bagirmi languages are for the most part poorly studied, and there is little agreement and to their internal classification. The table below is taken from [[Lionel Bender (linguist)|Lionel Bender]], as summarized in [[Roger Blench|Blench]] (2000).

*[[Bongo–Baka languages|Bongo–Baka]]
*[[Kara languages|Kara]] (= ''[[Tar Gula language|Tar Gula]]'' ?)
*''[[Sinyar language|Sinyar]] (Shemya)'' ?
*[[Bagirmi languages|Bagirmi]]
*[[Sara languages|Sara]]
*''[[Doba language|Doba]] (Bedjond, Gor, Mango)''
*[[Kaba languages|Kaba]]
*[[Vale languages|Vale]]
*''[[Birri language|Birri]]'' (likely to be closer to Kresh)
*''[[Fongoro language|Fongoro]] (Formona)'' ?
*''[[Yulu language|Yulu]] (Yulu–Binga)''

Sinyar and Fongoro may not be Bongo–Bagirmi or even Central Sudanic languages.

'''Chyngyz Aitmatov''' ({{lang-ky|Чыңгыз Айтматов}}, ''Çıñğız Aytmatov'', چىڭعىز ايتماتوۋ {{IPA-ky|tʃɯŋˈʁɯs ɑjtˈmɑtəf|}}; {{lang-ru|Чинги́з Тореку́лович Айтма́тов}}, ''Chingiz Torekulovich Aytmatov'') (12 December 1928 – 10 June 2008) was a [[USSR|Soviet]] and Kyrgyz author who wrote in both [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Kyrgyz language|Kyrgyz]]. He is one of the best known figures in [[Kyrgyzstan]]'s literature.

== Life ==
He was born to a Kyrgyz father and Tatar mother. Aitmatov's parents were civil servants in [[Sheker]]. In 1937 his father was charged with "[[bourgeois nationalism]]" in Moscow, arrested and executed in 1938.&lt;ref name=reuters/&gt;

Aitmatov lived at a time when Kyrgyzstan was being transformed from one of the most remote lands of the [[Imperial Russia|Russian Empire]] to a republic of the [[USSR]]. The future author studied at a Soviet school in Sheker. He also worked from an early age. At fourteen he was an assistant to the Secretary at the Village [[Soviet (council)|Soviet]]. He later held jobs as a tax collector, a loader, an engineer's assistant and continued with many other types of work.

In 1946 he began studying at the [[Animal Husbandry]] Division of the Kirghiz Agricultural Institute in [[Bishkek|Frunze]], but later switched to literary studies at the [[Maxim Gorky Literature Institute]] in Moscow, where he lived from 1956 to 1958. For the next eight years he worked for [[Pravda]]. His first two publications appeared in 1952 in Russian: "The Newspaper Boy Dziuio" and "Ашым." His first work published in Kyrgyz was "Ак Жаан" (White rain, 1954), and his well-known work "[[Jamila (novel)|Jamila]]" (Jamila) appeared in 1958. In 1961 he was a member of the jury at the [[2nd Moscow International Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="Moscow1961"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moscowfilmfestival.ru/miff34/eng/archives/?year=1961 |title=2nd Moscow International Film Festival (1961) |accessdate=2012-11-04 |work=MIFF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116210653/http://www.moscowfilmfestival.ru/miff34/eng/archives/?year=1961 |archivedate=2013-01-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971 he was a member of the jury at the [[7th Moscow International Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="Moscow1971"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moscowfilmfestival.ru/miff34/eng/archives/?year=1971 |title=7th Moscow International Film Festival (1971) |accessdate=2012-12-22 |work=MIFF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140403094201/http://www.moscowfilmfestival.ru/miff34/eng/archives/?year=1971 |archivedate=2014-04-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

1980 saw his first novel ''The Day Lasts More than a Hundred Years''; his next significant novel, ''The Scaffold'' was published in 1988. ''The Day Lasts More than a Hundred Years'' and other writings were translated into several languages. In 1994 he was a member of the jury at the [[44th Berlin International Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="Berlinale"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1994/04_jury_1994/04_Jury_1994.html |title=Berlinale: 1994 Juries |accessdate=2011-06-09 |work=berlinale.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002 he was the President of the Jury at the [[24th Moscow International Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="Moscow2002"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moscowfilmfestival.ru/miff34/eng/archives/?year=2002 |title=24th Moscow International Film Festival (2002) |accessdate=2013-03-30 |work=MIFF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130328141921/http://moscowfilmfestival.ru/miff34/eng/archives/?year=2002 |archivedate=2013-03-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aitmatov suffered [[kidney failure]], and on 16 May 2008 was admitted to a hospital in Nuremberg, Germany, where he died of [[pneumonia]] on 10 June 2008 at the age of 79.&lt;ref name=reuters/&gt;  After his death, Aitmatov was flown to Kyrgyzstan, where there were numerous ceremonies before he was buried in Ata Beyit cemetery, which he helped found&lt;ref name="eurasianet"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/insight/articles/pp061108.shtml |title=KYRGYZSTAN: CHINGIZ AITMATOV, A MODERN HERO, DIES |publisher=EurasiaNet |date=2008-06-11 |accessdate=2009-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and where his father most likely is buried,&lt;ref name="rferldeath"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/Chyngyz_Aitmatovs_Lifelong_Journey_Toward_Eternity/1359041.html |title=Chingiz Aitmatov's Lifelong Journey Toward Eternity |publisher=Radio Free Europe, Radio Liberty |date=2008-12-12 |accessdate=2009-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Chong-Tash]] village, [[Alamüdün district]], [[Chüy oblast]], Kyrgyzstan.

His obituary in [[The New York Times]] characterized him as "a Communist writer whose novels and plays before the collapse of the Soviet Union gave a voice to the people of the remote Soviet republic of Kyrgyz" and adds that he "later became a diplomat and a friend and adviser to the Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/15/books/15aitmatov.html?ref=obituaries Chingiz Aitmatov, Who Wrote of Life in U.S.S.R., Is Dead at 79] by Bruce Weber in The New York Times, 15 June 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Chinghiz Aitmatov belonged to the post-war generation of writers. His output before ''[[Jamila (novel)|Jamila]]''
&lt;ref name="jami"&gt;Chingiz Aitmatov. [http://www.angelfire.com/rnb/bashiri/Stories/Jamila.html Jamila]. Translated by Fainna Glagoleva. Prepared for the Internet by Iraj Bashiri, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; was not significant, a few short stories and a short novel called ''Face to Face''. But it was ''Jamila'' that came to prove the author's work.&lt;ref name="jami"/&gt; Seen through he eyes of an adolescent boy, it tells of how Jamila, a village girl, separated from her soldier husband by the war, falls in love with a disabled soldier staying in their village as they all work to bring in and transport the grain crop. Aitmatov's representative works also include the short novels ''Farewell, Gulsary!'',&lt;ref name="gu"&gt;Chingiz Aitmatov.

Aitmatov was honoured in 1963 with the [[Lenin Prize]] for ''Tales of the Mountains and Steppes'' (a compilation including "Jamila", "First Teacher" and "Farewell Gulsary") and was later awarded a State prize for ''Farewell, Gulsary!''.&lt;ref name="gu"/&gt; Aitmatov's art was glorified by admirers.&lt;ref&gt;Iraj Bashiri. ''[http://www.angelfire.com/rnb/bashiri/Aitmatov/Jamila.html The Art of Chingiz Aitmatov's Stories]'' {{en icon}} (discussion of Aitmatov's characters)&lt;/ref&gt; Even critics of Aitmatov mentioned the high quality of his novels.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sofia Kallistratova|S.V.Kallistratova]]. [http://www.memo.ru/library/books/sw/chapt55.htm#_VPID_131 We were not silent]. Open letter to writer Chingiz Aitmatov, May 5, 1988 {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aitmatov's work has some elements that are unique specifically to his creative process. His work drew on folklore, not in the ancient sense of it; rather, he tried to recreate and synthesize oral tales in the context of contemporary life. This is prevalent in his work; in nearly every story he refers to a myth, a legend, or a folktale.&lt;ref name=reuters/&gt; In ''The Day Lasts More Than a Hundred Years,'' a poetic legend about a young captive turned into a [[mankurt]] serves as a tragic allegory and becomes a significant symbolic expression of the philosophy of the novel.

A second aspect of Aitmatov's writing is his ultimate closeness to our "little brothers" the animals, for their and our lives are intimately and inseparably connected. The two central characters of ''Farewell, Gulsary!'' are a man and his stallion. A camel plays a prominent role in ''The Day Lasts More Than a Hundred Years''; one of the key turns of the novel which decides the fate of the main character is narrated through the story of the camel's rut and riot. ''The Scaffold'' starts off and finishes with the story of a wolf pack and the great wolf-mother Akbara and her cub; human lives enter the narrative but interweave with the lives of the wolves. Some of his stories were filmed, like ''The First Teacher'' in 1965 and "Red Scarf" (1970) as [[The Girl with the Red Scarf]] (1978).

As many educated Kyrgyzs, Aitmatov was fluent in both Kyrgyz and Russian. As he explained in one of his interviews, Russian was as much of a native language for him as Kyrgyz. Most of his early works he wrote in Kyrgyz; some of these he later translated into Russian himself, while others were translated into Russian by other translators. Since 1966, he was writing in Russian.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vb.kg/doc/314306_irina_melnikova:_raboty_nad_sbornikom_aytmatova_schitau_podarkom_sydby.html Ирина Мельникова: Работу над сборником Айтматова считаю подарком судьбы] ("Irina Melnikova: I view the opportunity to work on Aitmatov's ''Collected Works'' as a gift of fate")  (An interview with the editor of a Four-volume collection of Aitmatov's work), 2015-05-27&lt;/ref&gt;

== Diplomatic career ==

In addition to his literary work, Chinghiz Aitmatov was first the ambassador for the [[Soviet Union]] and later for Kyrgyzstan, to the [[European Union]], [[NATO]], [[UNESCO]] and the [[Benelux]] countries.&lt;ref name=reuters/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4764">The '''critical apparatus''' ({{lang-la|apparatus criticus}}) is the critical and [[primary source]] material that accompanies an edition of a text. A critical apparatus is often a by-product of [[textual criticism]].

Many editions employ a standard format for a critical apparatus, as illustrated by a line from ''[[Hamlet]]'', which the Oxford ''Complete Works'' (1988) prints as follows:&lt;ref&gt;William Shakespeare, ''The Complete Works'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1991), p. 682&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|{{sc|LAERTES}}. Alas, then is she drowned.}}

The apparatus for the line might be rendered as:&lt;ref&gt;Suggested by Stanley Wells and Gary Taylor, ''William Shakespeare: A Textual Companion'' (New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 1997), p. 408.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|4.7.156 Alas, then is she drowned.] {{sc|'''HIBBARD'''}}; Alas then, is she drown'd? '''F''';&lt;br&gt;Alas then is she drownd. '''Q3'''; Alas, then, she is drownd. '''Q2''';&lt;br/&gt;So, she is drownde: '''Q1'''.}}

The format of the apparatus has several parts:
* The location of the variant in the text (act, scene, line number)
* The ''lemma'', which is the portion of the text to which the note applies
* A right bracket (])
* The source from which the edition took its reading
* A list of variants, in each case followed by the source in which the variant is found, and set off with a semicolon.

To save space, frequently cited sources are usually assigned an abbreviation called a ''siglum''. In Shakespeare editions, '''F''' always signifies the [[First Folio]]; the second through fourth folios are referred to as '''F2''' through '''F4''' respectively. Similarly, '''Q1''' is the first [[quarto]], '''Q2''' the second quarto, and '''Q3''' the third.

In the example given, the first folio ('''F''') and the three early quartos ('''Q1''' to '''Q3''') each have a different reading of the line in question. The editors have concluded that all four early sources are corrupt, and instead have adopted a reading suggested by [[G. R. Hibbard]]. Other editors of the play may choose a different reading of the line. The apparatus summarizes all of the textual evidence, allowing readers to assess for themselves whether the editor has made the best choice. Sometimes the editor will add a commentary, defending the choice made, explaining why other readings were rejected, or discussing how other editors have treated the passage.

This format has been used for critical apparatuses of [[Shakespeare]] and many other authors. In [[variorum]] editions, the apparatus is often placed at the bottom of the page. Sometimes a three-part format is employed, with the main text at the top of the page, textual variants in the middle, and the editor's commentary at the bottom. This remains the most common format for Shakespeare editions, although the Oxford ''Complete Works'' breaks with tradition by putting its critical apparatus in a separately published volume.

In the United States, bibliographer [[Fredson Bowers]] established a tradition of putting the critical apparatus at the back of the book, leaving the edited text clear of apparatus. This has the advantage of leaving the main text uncluttered with editorial details that may not be of interest to the general reader. However, this format is a disadvantage to scholarly readers, who are not able to see all of the textual evidence in one place.

==Bible==
The first printed edition of the [[New Testament]] with ''critical apparatus'', noting variant readings among the manuscripts, was produced by the printer [[Robert Estienne]] of Paris in 1550. The Greek text of this edition and of those of Erasmus became known as the ''[[Textus Receptus]]'' (Latin for "received text"), a name given to it in the [[House of Elzevir|Elzevier]] edition of 1633, which termed it as the text ''nunc ab omnibus receptum'' ("now received by all").

==Electronic representation==
The de facto standard for the representation of critical apparatus in digital scholarly editions is to follow the recommendations of the [[Text Encoding Initiative]].&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/TC.html&lt;/ref&gt; While other formats are also used in digital literary studies this has become the most accepted storage format.&lt;ref&gt; See also James Cummings, "[http://www.digitalhumanities.org/companion/view?docId=blackwell/9781405148641/9781405148641.xml&amp;chunk.id=ss1-6-6&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;toc.id=ss1-6-6&amp;brand=9781405148641_brand The Text Encoding Initiative and the Study of Literature]" in 'A Companion to Digital Literary Studies', ed.

The '''decoder pen''', '''yes-no pen''', '''yes-know pen''' or '''magic pen''' book is a combination of '''decoder pen''' or [[marker pen|marker]] specially designed to reveal [[invisible ink]]-encoded pictures or writing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Confidential Secret Decoder Pen|url=http://www.mastermindtoys.com/Confidential-Secret-Decoder-Pen.aspx|accessdate=24 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the form of answers to questions or hidden parts of pictures,  with specially created [[children's books]] with hidden words and pictures.  They were most popular in the 1970s, but continue to be sold at gift shops. Often they were in the form of trivia games, which enabled the player to guess before revealing the answer. Brands of books for use with decoder pens include Yes &amp; Know, and surprise Ink.

Fans of the adventure games released by [[Sierra Entertainment]] in the 1980s such as ''[[King's Quest]]'' and ''[[Space Quest]]'' are also familiar with the decoder pen, which was used to reveal the answers to hints in the hints book sold for each game. Eventually these were replaced by a colored translucent plastic window, which eliminated a visually interfering red pattern.  [[Infocom]] sold similar hint books called "invisiclues" for their [[interactive fiction]] games.

The '''Eastern Daly languages''' are an extinct family of [[Australian aboriginal languages]] that are fairly closely related, at 50% cognate.  They were:

*[[Matngele language|Matngele]]
*[[Kamu language|Kamu]]

These languages had elements of verbal structure that suggest they may be related to the [[Macro-Gunwinyguan languages]]. All are now extinct.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, 2003, ''The non-Pama-Nyungan languages of northern Australia''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Muhammad Enamul Haque''' (20 September 1902 – 16 February 1982) was a Bangladeshi researcher, litterateur and educationist.&lt;ref name=bpedia&gt;{{cite book |last=Inam |first=Muhammad Ibne |year=2012 |chapter=Haq, Muhammad Enamul |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Haq,_Muhammad_Enamul |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Haque was born on 20 September 1902 in Bakhtpur in [[Fatikchhari Upazila]] of [[Chittagong District]]. While studying in Rauzan High School, he came into contact with [[Ismail Hossain Shiraji]] and was imbued with the spirit of nationalism. He passed the Entrance Examination obtaining first division in 1923 and was awarded a Mohsin scholarship. He passed the FA Examination in 1925 from [[Chittagong College]]. He earned BA degree with Honors in Arabic in 1927 and MA in 1929 securing first position in the first class in Oriental languages from the [[University of Calcutta]]. He was awarded the Jagattarini Gold Medal for the result.

Receiving a scholarship from the University of Calcutta, Enamul researched on the history of [[Sufism in Bengal]] under the supervision of [[Suniti Kumar Chatterji]] from 1929 to 1934. He got his PhD degree in 1935.

==Career==
Haque started his career as a translator in the [[Writers Building]], Calcutta and soon after he left the job and joined teaching. He taught at Jorwarganj High School in Meersarai in 1936, Barasat High School in 1937, [[Howrah Zilla School]] in 1941 and [[Maldah Zilla School]] in 1942. He became the Headmaster of Dhaka Zila School in 1945. He joined the [[Rajshahi College]] as a professor in 1948. He was appointed the principal of Daulatpur College (non-Government) on deputation in 1952. He joined the Rajshahi Government College as a professor of Bengali in 1954. After a few months he joined [[Jagannath College]] as the principal.

Haque was appointed the chairman of the East Bengal School Text Book Board in 1955 and that of the East Bengal Secondary Education Board in 1956. He was appointed the first director of the newly established [[Bangla Academy]] in 1956. He joined [[University of Rajshahi]] as a professor of Bengali in 1961. During 1964-68, he was the founder-director of the Kendriyo Bangla Unnayan Board (Central Board for the Development of Bengali). He served in the Department of Bengali, [[University of Dhaka]], as a supernumerary professor from 1969 to 1973. He worked at the post of chairman of the Bangladesh Itihas Parisad in 1973.

After the [[independence of Bangladesh]], Haque was made a full-time member of the University Grants Commission in 1973. He became the vice-chancellor of [[Jahangirnagar University]] in 1975. He joined Dhaka Museum as a senior research fellow in 1981, a position which he held till his death on 16 February 1982.

'''Exopheromone''' is a term coined by [[Terence McKenna]], proposed in his book ''[[Food of the Gods (book)|Food of the Gods]]'' for the controversial idea of chemical signals between members of different classes of living things, as opposed to among [[conspecific]]s. He suggested that certain chemicals produced in abundance in various [[hallucinogens|hallucinogenic plants and fungi]], such as [[dimethyltryptamine]] and [[psilocybin]] may act as [[pheromone]]s produced by one kingdom (the vegetal) waiting for absorption by various others (for example, early primates or [[Hominidae|hominid]]s). In this way a kind of ecological pheromonal system may be at work among biological kingdoms and [[ecosystem]]s that have coevolved closely for long stretches of time. The term is not scientifically accepted.

'''Faetar''', fully known as '''Faetar and Cellese''' (''Cigliàje''), is a [[Franco-Provençal language]] spoken in two small communities in [[Province of Foggia|Foggia]] in south [[Italy]]: [[Faeto]] and [[Celle di San Vito]], and in emigre communities such as Toronto and Brantford, one hour west of Toronto. Although it shares many similarities with both Franco-Provençal and [[Italian language|Italian]], it is distinct from both. These two small communities have been isolated from the rest of Italy by mountains, and so Faetar has evolved and changed over the centuries into a distinct language.

After a large wave of emigration from Italy after the [[Second World War]], many Faetano and Cellese settled in [[North America]]; with a relatively large group immigrating to [[Toronto]], [[Canada]]. The language has been studied both in its native Italy, and in Toronto, because of its small number of speakers, its unique blend of Italian and Franco-Provençal features, and its changes brought on by language contact.

Although not given a distinct language code from Franco-Provençal, it is listed by [[UNESCO]] as "definitely endangered".&lt;ref name="unesco"&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/culture/languages-atlas/en/atlasmap/language-id-351.html], UNESCO Interactive Atlas of the World’s Languages in Danger.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The Faetar language has its beginnings in the 13th century.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;[http://ifg.uniurb.it/network/ricucci/], Accenti provenzali sui monti Dauni, by Antonio Ricucci, April 30, 2012 (in Italian).&lt;/ref&gt; A Franco-Provençal group of soldiers was sent to the Puglia region to fight the [[battle of Benevento]] of 1266. After the battle, some soldiers stayed and set up communities in the region. Celle di San Vito was founded as a monastery on the mountainside to avoid an outbreak of [[malaria]] down the mountain, and Faeto was founded either on 8 July 1268, or 20 October 1274 by an edict from [[Charles of Anjou]].

In the 20th century, hundreds of Faetano and Cellese people left Italy and settled in the Toronto area of Canada, and in small pockets of the [[United States]], such as upstate [[New York (state)|New York]] (The [[demonyms]] for the people from Faeto and Celle di San Vito are Faetani and Cellese, respectively). The Toronto community has been studied recently to examine the effects of language contact, and to look at the differences between the language in Toronto and in its native Italy.&lt;ref name= "ItalyetCanada" /&gt;

== Language ==

There have been at least two dictionaries and one grammar published since 2000 that describe the Faetar language in Italian.&lt;ref name="2007dict"&gt;, Rubino, Vincenzo et. al. 2007. Dizionario Italiano-Francoprovenzale (F-I) di Faeto. Sportello Linguistico Francoprovenzale. Foggia, Italy.&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been studied extensively in English,&lt;ref name="perta"&gt;, Perta, Carmela. 2008. Can language politics ensure languages survival? Evidence from Italy. Language and Linguistics Compass 2.6: 1216-1224.&lt;/ref&gt; French,&lt;ref name="french"&gt;, Colecchio, Linda &amp; Michele Pavia. 2008. Les patrimoines linguistiques dans le cadre du développement local: enjeux seulement symboliques ou également économiques? la situation de Faeto. Abstract for a paper presented at Les droits linguistiques: droit à la reconnaissance, droit à la formation. Université de Teramo.&lt;/ref&gt; and Italian &lt;ref name="italian"&gt;, Bitonti, Alessandro. 2012. Luoghe, lingue, contatto: Italiano, dialetti, e francoprovenzale in Puglia. Tesi. Università di Lecce.&lt;/ref&gt; as a [[minority language]], a language in contact, and for comparison with other Franco-Provençal languages.&lt;ref name="Heap"&gt;, Heap, D. &amp; N. Nagy. 1998. Subject pronoun variation in Faetar and Francoprovencal. Papers in Sociolinguistics. NWAVE-26 a l'Universite Laval. Quebec: Nota bene. 291-300.&lt;/ref&gt;

Faetar’s grammar is similar to most other Romance languages with articles that agree with masculine and feminine nouns, and verbs that are inflected with different endings for person, number, and tense. Because of these inflected verbs, pronouns are not necessary. However, Faetar has a unique pronoun characteristic in that it has two versions of each pronoun. There is a "strong" pronoun and a "weak" [[pronoun]]. In conversation, both the strong and the weak can be used together (the strong always comes first), or only the strong, or only the weak, or no pronoun at all. The weak can also appear after a noun. For example:

(1)  '''No overt subject pronoun'''

/ɛ lu dʒórɛ '''Ø''' stav a la kaz/

''and that day, '''[Ø=I]''' was at the house''

(2)  '''Weak pronoun'''

/e '''i''' stávo vakánt/

''and '''it''' was vacant''

(3)  '''Strong pronoun'''

/no '''íʎɛ''' sta tútːo/

''No, '''he''' was always…''

(4)  '''Strong + Weak pronoun'''

/'''íʎɛ i''' e lu me prɛfɛríːtə/

'''''She-''strong ''she-''weak''' ''is my favourite'' &lt;ref&gt;Nagy, N.; Iannozzi, M.; &amp; D. Heap. In Press. Faetar Null Subjects: A Variationist Study of Heritage Language In Contact. International Journal of the Sociology of Language.&lt;/ref&gt;

This case of strong and weak pronouns has been the source of much study as to what constrains, if anything, the choice of pronouns in a given phrase.&lt;ref name="Heap"/&gt; This also makes Faetar a partial [[pro-drop language]].

A '''gender bender''' ([[LGBT slang]]: one who '''genderfucks''')&lt;!-- NOTE: "Genderfucks" is here, per WP:Alternative title; read that Wikipedia policy. "Genderfuck" is the alternative name for this article and redirects here. Also see what the rest of this article, including the lead, states about the term.--&gt; is a person who disrupts, or "bends", expected [[gender role]]s. [[Gender]] bending is sometimes a form of social [[activism]] undertaken to destroy rigid gender roles and defy sex-role stereotypes, notably in cases where the gender-nonconforming person finds these roles oppressive. It can be a reaction to, and protest of, [[homophobia]], [[transphobia]], [[misogyny]] or [[misandry]]. Some gender benders [[gender identity|identify]] with the [[Sex assignment|sex assigned them at birth]], but challenge the societal [[norm (sociology)|norms]] that assign expectations of particular, gendered behavior to that sex. This rebellion can involve [[androgyny|androgynous]] dress, adornment, behavior, and [[atypical gender role]]s. Gender benders may self-identify as [[transgender|trans]] or [[genderqueer]]. However, many trans people do not consider themselves "gender benders".{{Citation needed|reason=Provides no statistics as to frequency of trans people who do not consider themselves to be "gender benders," so claim that "many" do not consider themselves to be so is unsupported.|date=October 2017}}

Genderbending may be political, stemming from the early [[identity politics]] movements of the 1960s and 1970s, a guiding principle of which is the idea that the personal is political.&lt;ref&gt;Elisa Glick. Sex Positive: Feminism, Queer Theory, and the Politics of Transgression. Feminist Review, No. 64, Feminism 2000: One Step beyond?. (Spring, 2000), pp. 19–45.&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1974 article, ''Genderfuck and Its Delights'',&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Lonc. Genderfuck and Its Delights. Gay Sunshine 21 (Spring 1974).&lt;/ref&gt; Christopher Lonc explained his motivation for performing genderfuck: "I want to criticize and poke fun at the roles of women and of men too. I want to try [to] show how not-normal I can be. I want to ridicule and destroy the whole cosmology of restrictive [[gender role|sex role]]s and [[sexual identity|sexual identification]]."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{cite book|editor-last=Bergman|editor-first=David|title=Camp Grounds: Style and Homosexuality|publisher=University of Massachusetts Press|location=Amherst|year=1993|page=7|isbn=0-87023-878-7|oclc=28294779|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''genderfuck'' has long been part of the gay vernacular, and started to appear in written documents in the 1970s. Sheidlower cites the definition of the term ''gender fuck'' in L Humphreys' 1972 work ''Out of the Closets: Sociology of Homosexual Liberation'' as "a form of extended [[guerilla theatre]]". Also quoted is the August 1972 issue of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine, in reference to the [[glam rock]] style: "The new "macho" [[transvestism]], called vulgarly "gender-fuck", a curious satire of [[female impersonation]] – dresses, pumps, full make-up and beards – Is represented by, among others, three men in [[Women's Army Corps|WAC]] uniforms and big moustaches".&lt;ref name="Sheidlower 2009 189–190"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sheidlower|first=Jesse|title=The F-Word|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0199751552|pages=189–190|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I_AGK-49nlcC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender binary==
To "fuck with" gender, one must have an expectation to be able to rebel against. These expectations are socially constructed and can vary widely between cultures. The [[gender binary]] is the idea that only two genders exist: men and women. In many cultures it is only acceptable for an individual to embody one of two polar gender roles. Gender roles often mimic the social expectations of the sexual categories of "male" and "female". Within this cultural expectation, people designated as male are expected to be masculine, while those designated female are expected to be feminine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gender Trouble: Tenth Anniversary Edition|last=Butler|first=Judith|publisher=Routledge|year=2006|isbn=0415389550|location=New York, NY|pages=10–11|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The belief in and subscription to polar gender roles is known as gender binarism.

In many cultures, for a person to be seen as belonging to a particular gender category, the individual must not only have a particular anatomical (including genital) makeup, but must conform to that culture's ideas of appropriate sex-role stereotypes. These roles are highly influenced by culture and peers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Adler|first=Patricia A.|last2=Kless|first2=Steven J.|last3=Adler|first3=Peter|date=1992-01-01|title=Socialization to Gender Roles: Popularity among Elementary School Boys and Girls|jstor=2112807|journal=Sociology of Education|volume=65|issue=3|pages=169–187|doi=10.2307/2112807}}&lt;/ref&gt; This sex-role stereotype includes sexual orientation. To this end, those who go against expected conduct, for example [[gay]]s and [[lesbian]]s, may be seen as "less than" or "other".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Card|first1=C|title=Adventures in Lesbian Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_pIRGizLcMkC&amp;pg=PA127#v=onepage|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Western culture]]s, gender roles have changed somewhat over the years. However, mainstream western culture still tends to expect stereotypical "[[feminine]]" behaviors from females, and "[[masculine]]" sex-role stereotypes from males. A study by [[Princeton University]] outlined these common, prescriptive gender stereotypes: "masculine" - acts as a leader, aggressive, ambitious, analytical, assertive, athletic, competitive, defends own beliefs, dominant, forceful, has leadership abilities, independent, individualistic, makes decisions easily, self-reliant, self-sufficient, strong-personality, willing to take a stand, and willing to take risks. "Feminine" sex-role stereotypes, as defined by this same study included: affectionate, cheerful, childlike, compassionate, does not use harsh language, eager to soothe hurt feelings, flatterable, gentle, gullible, loves children, loyal, sensitive to the needs of others, shy, soft-spoken, sympathetic, tender, understanding, warm, and yielding.&lt;ref name=Princeton1&gt;{{cite web|last1=Prentice |first1=D |last2=Carranza |first2=E |title=What Women And Men Should Be, Shouldn't Be, Are Allowed To Be, And Don't Have To Be: The Contents of Prescriptive Gender Stereotypes |url=https://psych.princeton.edu/psychology/research/prentice/pubs/Prentice%20Carranza.pdf |website=psych.princeton.edu |accessdate=24 November 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140628230217/http://psych.princeton.edu/psychology/research/prentice/pubs/Prentice%20Carranza.pdf |archivedate=28 June 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Christian and Jewish cultures, gender roles and gender presentation have been policed since Biblical times: "The woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man, neither shall a man put on a woman's garment; for all that do so are abomination unto the Lord thy God" (Deut. 22:5). Crossing these lines has been interpreted by some Christians as a moral transgression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Garber|first1=M|title=Vested Interests: Cross-Dressing and Cultural Anxiety|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rCzYJisHWHAC|website=Google Books|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, other cultures - often [[indigenous peoples]], or [[subculture]]s that exist within Western cultures - may conceptualize gender as having [[Third gender|more than two options]], and even see their people as potentially fulfilling more than one gender role. Some [[indigenous peoples of North America]] have historically had [[Two-Spirit|more than two gender roles]] as part of their social structure,&lt;ref name=Estrada&gt;Estrada, Gabriel S. 2011. "[http://nativeout.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Two-Spirits-Nadleeh-and-Navajo-LGBTQ2-Gaze.pdf Two Spirits, Nádleeh, and LGBTQ2 Navajo Gaze]." ''American Indian Culture and Research Journal'' 35(4):167-190.&lt;/ref&gt; while others, who may or may not have embraced this diversity historically, may accept modern [[two spirit]] people as part of their communities now.&lt;ref name=Pember&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rewire.news/article/2016/10/13/two-spirit-tradition-far-ubiquitous-among-tribes/|title=‘Two Spirit’ Tradition Far From Ubiquitous Among Tribes|publisher=[[Rewire (website)|Rewire]]|first=Mary Annette |last=Pember |date=Oct 13, 2016|accessdate=Oct 17, 2016 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other cultures may see people as being capable of embodying more than one gender role at different times,&lt;ref name=Estrada/&gt; or of being "in the middle", "embracing both male and female spirit."&lt;ref name=CIFF&gt;Cleveland International Film Festival, selections; ''[http://www.clevelandfilm.org/films/2015/kumu-hina-a-place-in-the-middle Kumu Hina: A Place in the Middle]''&lt;/ref&gt; One such example is the Bugis people of South Sulawesi, Indonesia. People of the [[Gender in Bugis society|Bugis society]] have a total of five genders. These genders include what would traditionally be seen as cisgender man and woman, as well as transgender men and women, and the androgynous ''Bissu'' shamans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Graham|first=Sharyn|year=2004|title=It's Like One of Those Puzzles: Conceptualising Gender among Bugis|url=http://pl8cg5fc8w.search.serialssolutions.com/?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;ctx_enc=info%3Aofi%2Fenc%3AUTF-8&amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fsummon.serialssolutions.com&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.atitle=It%27s+Like+One+of+Those+Puzzles%3A+Conceptualising+Gender+among+Bugis&amp;rft.jtitle=Journal+of+Gender+Studies&amp;rft.au=Graham%2C+Sharyn&amp;rft.date=2004&amp;rft.issn=0958-9236&amp;rft.eissn=1465-3869&amp;rft.volume=13&amp;rft.issue=2&amp;rft.spage=107&amp;rft.externalDocID=R04061377&amp;paramdict=en-US|journal=Journal of Gender Studies|volume=13|pages=107–116|via=EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender bending in practice==
Often, [[parody]] and exaggeration are used to transgress [[gender roles]], usually to expose them as artificial.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson, Sue and Celia Kitzinger (1996). "The Queer Backlash". In {{cite book |editor-last=Bell |editor-first=Diane |editor2=Renate Klein|editor-link2=Renate Klein |title=Radically Speaking: Feminism Reclaimed |publisher=Zed Books |year=1996 |location=London |pages=375–382 }} Quoted in {{cite book |last=Weedon |first=Chris |title=Feminism, Theory, and the Politics of Difference |publisher=Blackwell Publishers |location=Cambridge, MA |year=1999 |pages=74–75 |isbn=0-631-19824-5 | oclc = |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a person who engages in genderfucking may purposefully exaggerate conventional notions of [[femininity]], or [[masculinity]]. Genderfucking can also be achieved through [[cross-dressing]] and [[androgyny]], both of which challenge and contribute to dismantling the gender binary by separating expression or performance of gender from perceptions of [[biological]] or [[physiological]] sex. Thus, genderfucking protests gender [[essentialism]]. This concept is protested not only through non-normative appearance, but by challenging normative gender roles, characteristics, or behaviors as well – for example, a female-bodied individual who is purposefully assertive and nondomestic in order to challenge the notion of essential femininity. Genderfucking is based in [[gender performativity]]: the concept of gender as a performance. It can be achieved through physical presentation (e.g. clothing, hair, makeup, and secondary sex characteristics), as well as behavior. Because much of gender performance is expressed through clothing, in societies where a gender binary can be observed, there is an established, widespread notion that some clothes are "masculine" and should be worn only by male-bodied individuals, and others are "feminine" and should be worn only by female-bodied individuals. Hawkes, sociologist and author, addresses this "dress code" and the opportunity for a resistance: "The universality of [dress] codes and their meanings allows for the [subversion of] the mainstream 'messages' they convey and through this to illuminate the existence of alternative [gender] identities."&lt;ref&gt;Hawkes, G. (1995). "Dressing-up – cross-dressing and sexual dissonance". Journal of Gender Studies 4(3): 261–270.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cross-dressing and androgyny===
Cross-dressing would be a form of gender bending because the purpose is to "fuck with gender" roles and presentation. [[Androgyny]] is not specifically genderfucking, but it can be considered genderfucking if someone is being androgynous on purpose. Many people who are androgynous may not make a conscious effort to look so.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} The origin of the word "[[androgynous]]" is from the Greek ''androgynos'': "male and female in one; womanish man; common to men and women".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Online Etymology Dictionary: androgynous|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=androgynous|accessdate=9 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been many famous people who have cross-dressed and many famous people now who are androgynous. The rock star [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] was very well known for his cross-dressing or androgynous look. [[Eddie Izzard]] started to freely talk about his cross-dressing as early as 1992.

[[Shakespeare]] used cross-dressing in his performances. Over the centuries some readers have posited that Shakespeare's sonnets are autobiographical,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lee|1900|loc=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; and point to them as evidence of his love for a young man. With this said, Shakespeare had characters in his writings that were considered cross-dressers. The four of the five main female characters in his plays were seen as women who cross-dress as men or boys: Cleopatra in [[Antony and Cleopatra]], Portia in [[The Merchant of Venice]], Rosalind in [[As You Like It]], Viola in [[Twelfth Night]].

Genderfucking is seen through many forms of life. One of these forms is [[Drag (clothing)|drag]].

===Drag===
[[Drag (clothing)|Drag shows]] are stage performances where people perform in [[drag (clothing)|drag]]. Drag costuming and makeup may in some cases simply involve an actor portraying a character of a sex or gender different from their own, or the performance itself may be a parody or critique of gender and gender roles. Often "feminine" or "masculine" gender stereotypes of the persons's culture are exaggerated for comic or satirical effect. Performers may call themselves [[drag king]]s or [[drag queen]]s. Drag revues typically involve elaborate, glamorous costumes and musical performances. The entertainers may sing, dance, or [[lip sync]].

A faux drag performer is a person who performs as the gender they identify as in day-to-day life, albeit in a usually exaggerated form. For instance a cisgender woman who performs as a drag queen is a [[faux queen]] or the other way around for a faux king.

"In order to understand the differences and similarities between gay male drag queens and female-bodied and transgender drag kings and bio queens, we consider how the personal gender and sexual identities of drag performers affect and are affected by their gender performances in drag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rupp |first=Leila |author2=Taylor, Verta |author3=Shapiro, Eve |title=Drag Queens and Drag Kings: The Difference Gender Makes |journal=Sexualities |date=June 8, 2010 |volume=13 |issue=275 |pages=278 |doi=10.1177/1363460709352725 }}&lt;!--|accessdate=June 4, 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literature===
Literature, in particular [[erotica]], is another method that has been used to explore genderfuck scenarios. The basis of the literary genre of genderfuck is that it's unimportant whether someone is a man or a woman during the sex act. Doris Libetseder points to [[Carol Queen]]'s short story ''The Leather Daddy and the Femme'', where a lesbian [[butch and femme|femme]] uses a [[strap-on dildo]] to have sex with a gay leather [[daddy (gay slang)|daddy]] as a fitting example of the genderfuck genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Leibetseder|first=Doris|title=Queer Tracks: Subversive Strategies in Rock and Pop Music|year=2013|publisher=Ash gate Publishing Ltd|isbn=1409472035|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M1cxkUZNMKwC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-political genderbending==
Genderfucking is not always a purposeful political standpoint. According to Butler, gender is something that is [[gender performance|performed]]; it only holds cultural significance to the extent that this is ascribed to it. Despite the [[gender binary]] roles society imposes, there are many ways for individuals to express gender variation and not all of them are intentionally [[political radicalism]].&lt;ref name=Butler /&gt; Further, in 1995 Tamsin Wilton argued that: &lt;blockquote&gt;
Gender-fuck is not intrinsically radical – otherwise gender-benders such as [[Boy George]], [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], [[Annie Lennox]], [[David Bowie]] etc. would not get away with it to the extent that they do. A politically aware gender-fuck – such as that of [[RuPaul]] or (to a limited extent) [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] – gets much closer to radicalism, but it is only by incorporating a critique of gender ''as an axis of power'' that playing about with gender signifiers can be more than wickedly entertaining&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilton|first=Tamsin|title=Lesbian Studies: Setting an Agenda|year=1995|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0415086566|pages=109|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hnzcVXPkyyMC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Judith Butler and gender as performance==
[[Judith Butler]] is one of the most well-known theorists who believe the idea that gender is something that is performed by individuals. Her concept of "[[gender performativity]]" is the idea that people choose to perform gender in a context in which we are given very few socially acceptable choices, but can be explained as being similar to what actors do in front of the camera. Due to the importance we place on the belief that men need to act like men and women need to behave like women, it is often believed that gender is an innate attribute and not a social construct. In her article ''Performative Acts and Gender Constitution: An Essay in Phenomenology and Feminist Theory'', Butler explains that if gender is something that sexed bodies assimilate to in order to follow the societal codes of what is appropriate behavior, then those actions can be conceptualized in different ways to allow more flexibility for individuals. In the same article, she asserts that in U.S. culture, the gender binary and its strict social repercussions against those that act against the "normal" script, this script is policed by harassment, parental pressures to fill expectations, and peer influence. All of which are a way to guarantee that the culture will repeat itself from generation to generation.&lt;ref name=Butler&gt;{{cite web|last=Butler|first=Judith|title=Performative Acts and Gender Construction: An Essay in Phenomenology and Feminist Theory|url=http://www.mariabuszek.com/kcai/PoMoSeminar/Readings/BtlrPerfActs.pdf|accessdate=1 June 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112054310/http://www.mariabuszek.com/kcai/PoMoSeminar/Readings/BtlrPerfActs.pdf|archivedate=12 January 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Judith Butler's theory about gender roles and their social implications and need for reconstruction is more fully developed in her book, ''[[Gender Trouble]]'' (1990). She argues that the limited acceptance of variation in gender roles does great harm to individual expression. With the limited options for both men and women, there is little room for their combined forces, because men are constantly focused on becoming the financial supporters of their families which leaves women with the sole option of being the maternal expert she is expected to be. This idea excludes the masculine women or feminine men from being acceptable parental figures for their children because it may lead to a child growing up and conceptualizing the world differently.&lt;ref name=Butler /&gt;

==Gender and childraising==
According to Susan Witt's recent study, children generally come to their first conclusions about being male or female from their parents since typically they are the first people the child relates to and the nature of the relationship is intense. Besides parents giving children gender specific clothing, toys, and expectations, there are often many subtle messages about what is acceptable or not regarding gender. Witt's study showed that children that grow up with more [[androgynous]] gendered parents are more focused on achievements and typically have a better sense of self.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Witt|first=Susan D.|title=Parental Influence on Children's Socialization to Gender Roles|url=http://gozips.uakron.edu/~susan8/parinf.htm|publisher=University of Akron School of Home Economics and Family Ecology|accessdate=26 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, in cases of gender nonconformity, when a child exhibits [[gender performance]]s that are atypical of their prescribed gender role, Kerry Robinson reports that a parental figure may respond with hostility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Robinson|first=Kerry|title=Tomboys and Sissy Girls: young girls' negotiations of femininity and masculinity |url=https://uws.academia.edu/KerryRobinson/Papers/319023/Tomboys_and_Sissy_Girls_young_girls_negotiations_of_femininity_and_masculinity |publisher=International Journal of Equity and Innovation in Early Childhood|accessdate=26 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''Official Journal of American Academy of Pediatrics'', people who do not conform to the [[gender binary]] are often subject to abuse from society, from within the family and within their community. Types of abuse range from [[physical abuse|physical]] and [[sexual abuse|sexual]] to [[psychological abuse]] and are not associated with homosexuality alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Andrea L.

==In fiction==
{{refimprove section|date=May 2016}}
In fiction, the term gender bender may refer not only to characters modeled after real-life gender benders, but also to characters who undergo changes in their physical sex – magically or otherwise – throughout the story. A work of art which challenges gender roles or features gender bending may itself be referred to as a "gender bender".

*In ''[[Orlando: A Biography]]'', an influential novel by [[Virginia Woolf]] published in 1928, the protagonist lives three hundred years and in the middle transforms from a man into a woman. It was made into a [[Orlando (film)|movie by the same name]] in 1992, starring [[Tilda Swinton]] and [[Quentin Crisp]].
*A historical and well-studied example of "gender bending" in English narrative is Shakespeare's ''[[Twelfth Night]]''.
*In the novel ''[[The Left Hand of Darkness]]'' by [[Ursula K. Le Guin]], characters have neutral sex for most of their lives, but take on either male or female characteristics when in heat (''kemmering'').
*In [[Neil Gaiman]]'s comic, [[The Sandman (Vertigo)|''The Sandman'']], the character [[Desire (DC Comics)|Desire]] is gender-fluid, and can become male, female, both, or neither, depending on the situation.
*Early examples of cross-dressing in films include ''[[A Florida Enchantment]]'' (1914) directed by and starring [[Sidney Drew]] and ''[[Mabel's Blunder]]'' (1914) directed by and starring [[Mabel Normand]].
*''[[The X-Files]]'' episode [[Gender Bender (The X-Files)|''Gender Bender'']] features a series of identical sexually-oriented murders, where the killer appears to be both male and female, changing gender after experience of intercourse.
*In the [[Raging Bender|eighth episode]] of ''[[Futurama]]''{{'}}s [[Futurama (season 2)|second season]], [[Bender (Futurama)|Bender]] is briefly known as "The Gender Bender".
*In [[Hetalia]]: The Beautiful World, an extra episode sees [[Estonia]] in a dream scenario where all the countries, except for him, are depicted as their opposing sex

A '''general plan''' is a broad planning guideline to a city's or county's future development goals and provides policy statements to achieve those development goals. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fulton|first1=William|last2=Shigley|first2=Paul|title=Guide to California Planning|date=September 2012|publisher=Solano Press Books|edition=Fourth}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each [[city]] and [[county]] adopts and updates their General Plan to guide the growth and [[land development]] of their [[community]], for both the current period and the long term.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sandiego.gov/planning/genplan/index.shtml San Diego General Plan Update adopted March 10 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; The General Plan is the foundation for establishing goals, purposes, [[zoning]] and activities allowed on each land parcel to provide compatibility and continuity to the entire region as well as each individual [[neighborhood]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.arguscourier.com/article/20080417/OPINION01/643129081 New General Plan a balanced blueprint]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Govind Ballal Deval''' (1855 - 1916) was a [[Marathi people|Marathi]] playwright from [[Maharashtra]], India.

Deval was born in 1855 in a village in the [[Konkan]] region of Maharashtra, but he spent his childhood in Haripur near [[Sangli]]. He attended a high school in [[Belgaum]], where he came in contact with, and was influenced by, playwright/actor [[Annasaheb Kirloskar|Balwant Pandurang Kirloskar]], who worked as a teacher in that school.

After a late high school graduation in 1879 at age 24, Deval worked for a few years as a teacher in the same school, moved to [[Pune]] to finish in 1894 a college course in Agriculture, and worked for a short while as a botany school teacher. An elder brother of Deval was a musician, while another brother was an accomplished actor in ''Ichalkaranjikar Natak Mandali''.

==Career==
While Deval was in high school in Belgaum, he joined Kirloskar's ''Kirloskar Natak Mandali'' as an actor after its inception around 1875 and soon became an associate  play director there. He even composed the lyrics and music of many of the 198 songs in Kirloskar's play ''Shakuntal'' (शाकुंतल), the first half of which was presented to the public in 1880. (Kirloskar presented the complete play the next year.)

After Kirloskar's death in 1885, Deval continued to work for a few years at ''Kirloskar Natak Mandali'' as a playwright, an actor, and a play director. After his move to Pune in 1894, he founded ''Aryoddharak Natak Mandali''; and in 1913, three years before his death, he joined [[Bal Gandharva]]'s newly established ''Gandharva Natak Mandali''.

Deval's disciples in acting included Bhaurao Kolhatkar, Nanasaheb Joglekar, [[Ganesh Bodas|Ganesh Bodas aka Ganpatrao]], Kashinathpant Parchure, and Bal Gandharva, all of whom turned out to be well-known actors in Maharashtra in the early part of the 20th century.

==Plays==
During 1886-1916, Deval wrote and presented to the public seven plays:

* ''Durga'' (दुर्गा) (1886) (An adapted version of [[Thomas Southerne]]'s ''The Fatal Marriage'' (or ''Isabella''))
* ''Mruchchhakatik'' (मृच्छकटिक) (1887) (An adapted version of [[Shudrak]]'s [[Sanskrit]] play with [[Mrichchakatikam|the same name]])
* ''Vikramorwashiya'' (विक्रमोर्वशीय) (1889) (An adapted  of [[Kālidāsa|Kalidas]]'s play with the same name)
* ''Jhunjarrao'' (झुंझारराव) (1890) (An adapted version of [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Othello]]'')
* ''Shapa Sambhram'' (शापसंभ्रम) (1893) (An adapted version of [[Banabhatta]]'s ''[[Kadambari]]'')
* ''[[Sangeet Sharada]]'' (शारदा) (1899)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mumbaimirror.com/index.aspx?page=article&amp;sectid=57&amp;contentid=2009041520090415023739989aeb54aa1|title=Beyond entertainment: Sangeet Sharada|work=[[Mumbai Mirror]]|date=April 15, 2009|agency=[[The Times of India]]|accessdate=August 16, 2013|author=Gokhale, Shanta|location=Mumbai}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Samshay Kallol'' (संशयकल्लोळ) (1916) (Based partly on [[Molière]]'s ''[[Sganarelle]]''. This play had been presented to the public by ''Gandharva Natak Mandali'' after Deval's death earlier in 1916.)

Graciliano Ramos de Oliveira was born in the city of [[Quebrangulo]], in the Brazilian state of [[Alagoas]], on October 27, 1892, to Sebastião Ramos de Oliveira and Maria Amélia Ramos. Graciliano was the oldest of the couple's 16 children.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.graciliano.com.br/vida_arvore.html Árvore genealógica de Graciliano Ramos] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140328122131/http://www.graciliano.com.br/vida_arvore.html |date=2014-03-28 }} {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He would spend most part of his childhood travelling through different cities of [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeast Brazil]]. After finishing high school in [[Maceió]], he became a collaborator of the newspaper ''Jornal de Alagoas'' in 1909, where he published a [[sonnet]] called "Céptico" under the pen name '''Almeida Cunha''', and some other texts under many different pseudonyms. He also published texts in the magazine ''O Malho'', under the pen name '''Feliciano de Olivença''', and founded a short-lived periodical named ''Echo Viçosense'' in 1906.

In 1914 he moved to [[Rio de Janeiro]], but had to return to Alagoas in September 1915, in order to live with his father, who became a salesman in the city of [[Palmeira dos Índios]]. Also in 1915, he married his first wife, Maria Augusta de Barros, having with her four children. Maria Augusta died in 1920, due to troubles during childbirth.

In 1927, Ramos was elected mayor of [[Palmeira dos Índios]]: he took office in 1928 and would abdicate his post in 1930. Mesmerized by the high literary quality of his prefecture reports, Augusto Frederico Schmidt would approach Ramos into publishing his first novel, ''[[Caetés (novel)|Caetés]]'', that Ramos started to write circa 1925. He would finish ''Caetés'' in 1930, but did not publish it until 1933. In 1928, he married his second wife, Heloísa Leite de Medeiros, having with her four more children.

From 1930 to 1936 he lived once again in Maceió. In 1934 he published the novel ''[[São Bernardo (novel)|São Bernardo]]'', and in the following year, he was arrested due to alleged (but never confirmed) participation in the [[Brazilian uprising of 1935|Communist Revolt of 1935]]. (Graciliano wrote an account of his time in prison named ''[[Memórias do Cárcere (Graciliano)|Memórias do Cárcere]]'', published a few months after his death in [[1953 in literature|1953]].) After being freed from prison, he publishes with the help of associates such as [[José Lins do Rego]] his most famous novel, ''[[Angústia]]''.

In 1938 he publishes ''[[Vidas Secas]]'' and moves definitely to Rio de Janeiro, where he became in 1945 a member of the [[Communist Party of Brazil]]. In the subsequent years, he travelled alongside his wife to countries such as France, Portugal, the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Czechoslovakia]]. Also in 1945 he published an account of his childhood years, named ''[[Infância]]''. Beginning in 1952, Graciliano's health gradually began to decline. He was diagnosed with [[lung cancer]] and, after an unsuccessful surgery, died on March 20, 1953. His wife Heloísa would die 46 years later, in [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]], [[Bahia]].

Graciliano is survived by one daughter and many grandchildren and great-grandchildren.

'''Haquin Spegel''' (Haqvin) (14 June 1645 – 17 April 1714), born ''Håkan Spegel'' in [[Ronneby]] in [[Blekinge]] (today in [[Sweden]]), was a religious author and hymn writer who held several bishop's seats. 

== Life ==
In 1675, the King [[Charles XI of Sweden]] appointed him as court chaplain. During the wars in the following years, he followed the King, and became a close confidant of his. He kept a diary during the whole time, which has proven to be valuable as research material.

In 1680 he wed Queen [[Ulrika Eleonora]] and the King. He spent the following five years mainly on the island of [[Gotland]] as a superintendent over the [[Diocese of Visby]]. He managed to write the ''Rudera Gothlandica'' during this time (published first 1901).

In 1685 he was appointed [[Bishop of Linköping]] in eastern Sweden. In 1693 he was transferred to the seat in [[Diocese of Skara]], central Sweden, where he remained until 1711. On the death of the [[Archbishop of Uppsala]], Spegel was elected his successor, although he only held this position for three years.

During that time he wrote an influential epos called ''God's work and rest'' about God's creation as written about in the Bible.

== Other notability ==
It is said that he worked for education of the people, and wanted every peasant in Sweden to be able to read.

He was also known as a [[hymnist]] and poet.

'''Icelandic''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-Icelandic.ogg|aɪ|s|ˈ|l|æ|n|d|ɪ|k}}; {{lang-is|íslenska|link=no}} {{IPA-is|ˈiːs(t)lɛnska|pron|Is-Íslenska.oga}}) is a [[North Germanic languages|North Germanic language]] spoken in [[Iceland]]. Along with [[Faroese language|Faroese]], [[Norn language|Norn]], and Western [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] it formerly constituted ''West Nordic''; while [[Danish language|Danish]], Eastern Norwegian and [[Swedish language|Swedish]] constituted ''East Nordic''. Modern Norwegian {{lang|nb|[[Bokmål]]}} is influenced by both groups, leading the Nordic languages to be divided into mainland Scandinavian languages and ''Insular Nordic'' (including Icelandic). Historically, it was the westernmost of the [[Indo-European languages]] until the [[History of the Azores|Portuguese settlement in the Azores]]. 

Most Western European languages have greatly reduced levels of [[inflection]], particularly noun [[declension]]. In contrast, Icelandic retains a four-[[grammatical case|case]] [[synthetic language|synthetic]] grammar comparable to German, though considerably more conservative and synthetic. Icelandic is distinguished by a wide assortment of irregular declensions. Icelandic also has many instances of [[oblique case]]s without any governing word, much like [[Latin]]. For example, many of the various Latin [[ablative case|ablatives]] have a corresponding Icelandic [[dative case|dative]].{{what|date=June 2018}} The conservatism of the Icelandic language and its resultant near-isomorphism to [[Old Norse]] (which is equivalently termed Old Icelandic by linguists) means that modern Icelanders can easily read the ''[[Edda]]s,'' [[saga]]s, and other classic Old Norse literary works created in the tenth through thirteenth centuries.

Icelandic is closely related to, but not mutually intelligible with the [[Faroese language]], and is also not mutually intelligible with the continental Scandinavian languages. It is also farther away from the largest Germanic languages [[English language|English]] and [[German language|German]] than those three are.

The vast majority of Icelandic speakers—about 320,000—live in Iceland. More than 8,000 Icelandic speakers live in Denmark,&lt;ref name="Denmark"&gt;[http://www.statbank.dk/statbank5a/default.asp?w=1280 Statbank Danish statistics]&lt;/ref&gt; of whom approximately 3,000 are students.&lt;ref name="Danishstudents"&gt;[http://www.iceland.is Official Iceland website]&lt;/ref&gt; The language is also spoken by some 5,000 people in the United States&lt;ref name="USA"&gt;{{cite web |title=Icelandic |work=MLA Language Map Data Center |publisher=[[Modern Language Association]] |url=http://www.mla.org/map_data_results&amp;mode=lang_tops&amp;SRVY_YEAR=2000&amp;lang_id=617 |accessdate=2010-04-17 }} Based on [[United States Census, 2000|2000 US census data]].&lt;/ref&gt; and by more than 1,400 people in Canada,&lt;ref name="Canada"&gt;[http://www12.statcan.ca/nhs-enm/2011/dp-pd/dt-td/Rp-eng.cfm?LANG=E&amp;APATH=3&amp;DETAIL=0&amp;DIM=0&amp;FL=A&amp;FREE=0&amp;GC=0&amp;GID=0&amp;GK=0&amp;GRP=1&amp;PID=105400&amp;PRID=0&amp;PTYPE=105277&amp;S=0&amp;SHOWALL=0&amp;SUB=0&amp;Temporal=2013&amp;THEME=95&amp;VID=0&amp;VNAMEE=&amp;VNAMEF= Canadian census 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; notably in the province of [[Manitoba]].

Icelandic speakers abroad represent recent emigration in almost all cases except [[Gimli, Manitoba]], which was settled from the 1880s onwards.

The state-funded [[Árni Magnússon Institute for Icelandic Studies]] serves as a centre for preserving the medieval Icelandic manuscripts and studying the language and its literature. The Icelandic Language Council, comprising representatives of universities, the arts, journalists, teachers, and the [[Ministry of Education, Science and Culture (Iceland)|Ministry of Culture, Science and Education]], advises the authorities on [[language policy]]. Since 1995, on 16 November each year, the birthday of 19th-century poet [[Jónas Hallgrímsson]] is celebrated as [[Icelandic Language Day]].&lt;ref name="Mothertongue"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Menntamálaráduneyti"&gt;{{cite web |title=Menntamálaráðuneyti |trans-title=Ministry of Education |url=http://www.menntamalaraduneyti.is/malaflokkar/Menning/dit/ |accessdate=2007-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{Main| History of Icelandic}}
[[File:LandnamabokManuscriptPage.jpg|thumb|right|A page from the {{lang|is|[[Landnámabók]]}}, an early Icelandic manuscript.]]

The oldest preserved texts in Icelandic were written around 1100 AD. Much of the texts are based on poetry and laws traditionally preserved orally. The most famous of the texts, which were written in [[Iceland]] from the 12th century onward, are the [[Icelandic Sagas]]. They comprise the historical works and the [[eddaic poems]].

The language of the sagas is [[Old Icelandic]], a western dialect of [[Old Norse]]. The [[Denmark-Norway|Dano-Norwegian]], then later Danish rule of Iceland from 1536 to 1918 had little effect on the evolution of Icelandic (in contrast to the Norwegian language), which remained in daily use among the general population. Though more archaic than the other living Germanic languages, Icelandic changed markedly in pronunciation from the 12th to the 16th century, especially in vowels (in particular, ''{{lang|is|á}}'', ''{{lang|is|æ}}'', ''{{lang|is|au}}'', and ''{{lang|is|y}}/{{lang|is|ý}}'').

The modern [[Icelandic orthography|Icelandic alphabet]] has developed from a standard established in the 19th century, primarily by the Danish linguist [[Rasmus Rask]]. It is based strongly on an [[orthography]] laid out in the early 12th century by a mysterious document referred to as ''[[First Grammatical Treatise|The First Grammatical Treatise]]'' by an anonymous author, who has later been referred to as the First Grammarian. The later Rasmus Rask standard was a re-creation of the old treatise, with some changes to fit concurrent [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] conventions, such as the exclusive use of ''{{lang|is|k}}'' rather than ''{{lang|is|c}}''. Various archaic features, as the letter ''{{lang|is|[[eth|ð]]}}'', had not been used much in later centuries. Rask's standard constituted a major change in practice. Later 20th-century changes include the use of ''{{lang|is|é}}'' instead of ''{{lang|is|je}}'' and the removal of ''{{lang|is|z}}'' from the Icelandic alphabet in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://brunnur.stjr.is/mrn/logogregl.nsf/nrar/auglysingar2721973 |title=Auglýsing um afnám Z |trans-title=Advertising on the Elimination of Z |publisher=Brunnur.stjr.is |date=2000-04-03 |accessdate=2010-06-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from the addition of new vocabulary, written Icelandic has not changed substantially since the 11th century, when the first texts were written on vellum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sanders |first=Ruth |title=German: Biography of a Language |year=2010 |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=209 |quote=Overall, written Icelandic has changed little since the eleventh century Icelandic sagas, or historical epics; only the addition of significant numbers of vocabulary items in modern times makes it likely that a saga author would have difficulty understanding the news in today's [Icelandic newspapers]. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern speakers can understand the original [[Icelandic sagas|sagas]] and [[Edda]]s which were written about eight hundred years ago. The sagas are usually read with updated modern spelling and footnotes but otherwise intact (as with modern English readers of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]). With some effort, many Icelanders can also understand the original manuscripts.

== Legal status and recognition ==
According to an act (61/2011) passed by parliament in 2011, Icelandic is "the official language in Iceland".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Act [No 61/2011] on the status of the Icelandic language and Icelandic sign language |url=http://eng.menntamalaraduneyti.is/media/MRN-pdf/Icelandic-Language-Act-tr-260711.pdf |publisher=[[Ministry of Education, Science and Culture (Iceland)|Ministry of Education, Science and Culture]] |accessdate=15 November 2013 |page=1 |format=PDF |quote=Article 1; National language – official language; Icelandic is the national language of the Icelandic people and the official language in Iceland. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Iceland is a member of the [[Nordic Council]], a forum for co-operation between the Nordic countries, but the council uses only Danish, Norwegian and Swedish as its working languages (although the council does publish material in Icelandic).&lt;ref name="Norden"&gt;{{cite web |title=Norden |url=http://www.norden.org |accessdate=2007-04-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the [[Nordic Language Convention]], since 1987 Icelandic citizens have had the right to use Icelandic when interacting with official bodies in other Nordic countries, without becoming liable for any interpretation or translation costs.

== Phonology ==
{{Main|Icelandic phonology}}
{{IPA notice}}
Icelandic has very minor [[dialect]]al differences phonetically. The language has both [[monophthong]]s and [[diphthong]]s, and consonants can be [[voice (phonetics)|voiced]] or [[unvoiced]].

Voice plays a primary role in the differentiation of most [[consonant]]s including the nasals but excluding the [[plosives]]. The plosives ''b'', ''d'', and ''g'' are voiceless and differ from ''p'', ''t'' and ''k'' only by their lack of [[aspiration (phonetics)|aspiration]]. [[Preaspiration]] occurs before [[gemination|geminate]] (long or double consonants) ''p'', ''t'' and ''k''. It does not occur before geminate ''b'', ''d'' or ''g''. Pre-aspirated ''tt'' is analogous etymologically and phonetically to [[German language|German]] and [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''cht'' (compare Icelandic ''{{lang|is|nótt}}'', ''{{lang|is|dóttir}}'' with the [[German language|German]] ''{{lang|de|Nacht}}'', ''{{lang|de|Tochter}}'' and the Dutch ''{{lang|nl|nacht}}'', ''{{lang|nl|dochter}}'').

== Grammar ==
[[File:Icelandic Text Extract.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Photograph taken from page 176 of ''Colloquial Icelandic'']]
{{Main|Icelandic grammar}}

Icelandic retains many grammatical features of other ancient [[Germanic languages]], and resembles [[Old Norwegian]] before much of its [[fusional language|fusional]] inflection was lost. Modern Icelandic is still a heavily [[inflection|inflected language]] with four [[list of grammatical cases|cases]]: [[nominative case|nominative]], [[accusative case|accusative]], [[dative case|dative]] and [[genitive case|genitive]]. Icelandic nouns can have one of three [[grammatical gender]]s: masculine, feminine or neuter. There are two main declension paradigms for each gender: [[strong noun|strong]] and [[weak noun]]s, and these are further divided into subclasses of nouns, based primarily on the ''genitive singular'' and ''nominative plural'' endings of a particular noun. For example, within the strong masculine nouns, there is a subclass (class 1) that declines with ''-s'' (''{{lang|is|hests}}'') in the genitive singular and ''-ar'' (''{{lang|is|hestar}}'') in the nominative plural. However, there is another subclass (class 3) of strong masculine nouns that always declines with ''-ar'' (''{{lang|is|hlutar}}'') in the genitive singular and ''-ir'' (''{{lang|is|hlutir}}'') in the nominative plural. Additionally, Icelandic permits a [[quirky subject]], i.e. certain verbs have subjects in an oblique case (i.e. other than the nominative).

Nouns, adjectives and pronouns are declined in the four cases and for number in the singular and plural. [[T-V distinction]] (''{{lang|is|þérun}}'') in modern Icelandic seems on the verge of extinction, but it can still be found, especially in structured official address and traditional phrases.

[[Verb]]s are [[grammatical conjugation|conjugated]] for [[grammatical tense|tense]], [[grammatical mood|mood]], [[grammatical person|person]], [[number (grammar)|number]] and [[grammatical voice|voice]]. There are three voices: active, passive and middle (or medial), but it may be debated whether the middle voice is a voice or simply an independent class of verbs of its own (because every middle-voice verb has an active ancestor but concomitant{{clarify|date=October 2018}} are sometimes drastic changes in meaning, and the middle-voice verbs form a conjugation group of their own). Examples are ''{{lang|is|koma}}'' ("come") vs. ''{{lang|is|komast}}'' ("get there"), ''{{lang|is|drepa}}'' ("kill") vs. ''{{lang|is|drepast}}'' ("perish ignominiously") and ''{{lang|is|taka}}'' ("take") vs. ''{{lang|is|takast}}'' ("manage to"). In each of these examples, the meaning has been so altered, that one can hardly see them as the same verb in different voices. Verbs have up to ten tenses, but Icelandic, like English, forms most of them with [[auxiliary verb]]s. There are three or four main groups of weak verbs in Icelandic, depending on whether one takes a historical or a formalistic view: ''{{lang|is|-a}}'', ''{{lang|is|-i}}'', and ''{{lang|is|-ur}}'', referring to the endings that these verbs take when conjugated in the [[grammatical person|first person]] [[grammatical number|singular]] present. Some Icelandic [[infinitive]]s end with the ''{{lang|is|-ja}}'' [[suffix]], some with ''{{lang|is|á}}'', two with ''{{lang|is|u}}'' (''{{lang|is|munu}}'', ''{{lang|is|skulu}}'') one with ''{{lang|is|o}}'' (''{{lang|is|þvo}}'': "wash") and one with ''{{lang|is|e}}'' (the Danish borrowing ''{{lang|is|ske}}'' which is probably withdrawing its presence){{clarify|date=October 2018}}. Many transitive verbs (i.e they require an [[object (grammar)|object]]), can take a [[reflexive pronoun]] instead. The case of the pronoun depends on the case that the verb governs. As for further classification of verbs, Icelandic behaves much like other Germanic languages, with a main division between weak verbs and strong, and the strong verbs, of which there are about 150 to 200, are divided into six classes plus reduplicative verbs. They still make up some of the most frequently used verbs. (''{{lang|is|Að vera}}'', "to be", is the example ''par excellence'', having two subjunctives and two imperatives in addition to being made up of different stems.) There is also a class of auxiliary verbs, called the ''{{lang|is|-ri}}'' verbs (4 or 5, depending who is counting){{clarify|date=October 2018}} and then the oddity ''{{lang|is|að valda}}'' ("to cause"), called the only totally irregular verb in Icelandic although [[wikt:valda#Icelandic|every form of it]] is caused by common and regular sound changes.

The basic word order in Icelandic is [[subject–verb–object]]. However, as words are heavily inflected, the word order is fairly flexible, and every combination may occur in poetry; SVO, SOV, VSO, VOS, OSV and OVS are all allowed for metrical purposes. However, as with most Germanic languages, Icelandic usually complies with the [[V2 word order]] restriction, so the conjugated verb in Icelandic usually appears as the second element in the clause, preceded by the word or phrase being emphasized. For example:
* ''{{lang|is|Ég veit það ekki.}}'' (''I'' know it not.)
* ''{{lang|is|Ekki veit ég það.}}'' (''Not'' know I it. )
* ''{{lang|is|Það veit ég ekki.}}'' (''It'' know I not.)
* ''{{lang|is|Ég fór til Bretlands þegar ég var eins árs.}}'' (I went to Britain when I was one year old.)
* ''{{lang|is|Til Bretlands fór ég þegar ég var eins árs.}}'' (To ''Britain'' went I, when I was one year old.)
* ''{{lang|is|Þegar ég var eins árs fór ég til Bretlands.}}'' (When I was one year old, went I to Britain.)

In the above examples, the conjugated verbs ''{{lang|is|veit}}'' and ''{{lang|is|fór}}'' are always the second element in their respective clauses.

== Vocabulary ==
{{Main| Icelandic vocabulary | Icelandic name}}
[[File:Icelandic Patronyms.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|A simple family tree showing the Icelandic patronymic naming system.]]
[[File:Eyjafjallajökull.jpeg|thumb|{{lang|is|[[Eyjafjallajökull]]}}, one of the smaller ice caps of Iceland, situated to the north of {{lang|is|Skógar}} and to the west of {{lang|is|Mýrdalsjökull}}, is Icelandic for "glacier of {{lang|is|Eyjafjöll}}"]]
Early Icelandic vocabulary was largely [[Old Norse]]. The [[Christianization of Iceland|introduction of Christianity to Iceland]] in the 11th century brought with it a need to describe new [[Christian theology|religious concepts]]. The majority of new words were taken from other [[Scandinavian languages]]; ''{{lang|is|kirkja}}'' ("church"), for example. Numerous other languages have had their influence on Icelandic: [[French language|French]] brought many words related to the court and knightship; words in the [[semantic field]] of trade and commerce have been borrowed from [[Low German]] because of trade connections. In the late 18th century, [[language purism]] began to gain noticeable ground in Iceland and since the early 19th century it has been the linguistic policy of the country (see [[linguistic purism in Icelandic]]). Nowadays, it is common practice to [[neologism|coin]] new compound words from Icelandic derivatives.

[[Icelandic name|Icelandic personal names]] are [[patronymic]] (and sometimes [[matronymic]]) in that they reflect the immediate father or mother of the child and not the historic family lineage. This system—which was formerly used throughout the Nordic area and beyond—differs from most [[Western Hemisphere|Western]] [[family name]] systems.

=== Linguistic purism ===
{{Main| Linguistic purism in Icelandic}}
During the 19th century, a movement was started by writers and other educated people of the country to rid the language of foreign words as much as possible and to create a new vocabulary and adapt the Icelandic language to the evolution of new concepts, thus avoiding the use of borrowed [[neologism]]s as are found in many other languages. Many old words which had fallen into disuse were recycled and given new senses in the modern language, and neologisms were created from Old Norse roots. For example, the word ''{{lang|is|rafmagn}}'' ("electricity"), literally means "amber power", [[calque|calquing]] the derivation of the [[Greek language|Greek]] root "electr-" from Greek ''{{lang|el-Latn|elektron}}'' ("amber")&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E1%BC%A4%CE%BB%CE%B5%CE%BA%CF%84%CF%81%CE%BF%CE%BD#Ancient_Greek|title=ἤλεκτρον - Wiktionary|website=en.wiktionary.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Similarly, the word ''{{lang|is|sími}}'' ("telephone") originally meant "cord", and ''{{lang|is|tölva}}'' ("computer") is a [[portmanteau]] of ''{{lang|is|tala}}'' ("digit; number") and ''{{lang|is|völva}}'' ("seeress").

== Writing system ==
{{Main|Icelandic orthography|Icelandic Braille}}
The Icelandic alphabet is notable for its retention of two old letters which no longer exist in the [[English alphabet]]: [[Thorn (letter)|Þ, þ]] ({{lang|ang|þorn}}, modern English "thorn") and [[Eth|Ð, ð]] ({{lang|ang|eð}}, anglicised as "eth" or "edh"), representing the [[voiceless consonant|voiceless]] and [[Voiced consonant|voiced]] "th" sounds (as in English ''thin'' and ''this''), respectively. The complete Icelandic alphabet is:

{| class="wikitable" style="table-layout: fixed; width: 50em; text-align: center;"

|}

The [[diacritic|letters with diacritics]], such as ''{{lang|is|á}}'' and ''{{lang|is|ö}}'', are for the most part treated as separate letters and not variants of their derivative vowels. The letter ''{{lang|is|é}}'' officially replaced ''{{lang|is|je}}'' in 1929, although it had been used in early manuscripts (until the 14th century) and again periodically from the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Is icon}} [http://www.visindavefur.hi.is/svar.asp?id=1947 Hvenær var bókstafurinn 'é' tekinn upp í íslensku í stað 'je' og af hverju er 'je' enn notað í ýmsum orðum?] (retrieved on 2007-06-20)&lt;/ref&gt; The letter ''{{lang|is|z}}'', which had been a part of the Icelandic alphabet for a long time but was no longer distinguished from ''{{lang|is|s}}'' in pronunciation, was officially removed in 1973.

== Cognates with English ==
As Icelandic shares its ancestry with [[English language|English]] and both are [[Germanic languages]], there are many [[cognate]] words in both languages; each have the same or a similar meaning and are derived from a common root. The possessive, though not the plural, of a noun is often signified with the ending ''{{lang|is|-s}}'', as in English. [[Phonology|Phonological]] and [[orthography|orthographical]] changes in each of the languages will have changed spelling and pronunciation. But a few examples are given below.

'''Ikobi''', or '''Ikobi-Mena''' after its two varieties, is a [[Papuan language]], or pair of languages, of [[Papua New Guinea]]. Wurm and Hattori (1981) treat the two varieties, Ikobi and Mena, as distinct languages, but ''Ethnologue'' 16 judges them to be one.

'''Implicature''' is a technical term within [[pragmatics]], a subdiscipline of [[linguistics]]. It was coined by [[Paul Grice|H. P. Grice]] to refer to what is ''suggested'' in an [[Wikt:utterance|utterance]], even though neither expressed nor ''strictly implied'' (that is, [[entailment (pragmatics)|entailed]]) by the utterance.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refBlackburn1996|Blackburn 1996]], p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt; As an example, the sentence "Mary had a baby and got married" strongly suggests that Mary had the baby before the wedding, but the sentence would still be ''strictly true'' if Mary had her baby after she got married. Further, if we append the qualification "not necessarily in that order" to the original sentence, then the implicature is now cancelled even though the meaning of the original sentence is not altered.

"Implicature" is an alternative to "[[Logical consequence|implication]]", which has additional meanings in [[logic]] and informal language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/implicature/|title=Implicature|last=Wayne|first=Davis|date=24  June 2014|website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|access-date=23 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==

===Conversational implicature===
Conversational implicatures are implicatures that arise during conversation, where the speaker voluntarily flouts, or violates, one of maxims in the [[maxims of conversation]] that create an implied meaning to the addressee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wilson|first1=Deirdre|last2=Sperber|first2=Dan|title=On Grice's Theory of Conversation|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Deirdre_Wilson/publication/259476430_On_Grice's_theory_of_conversation/links/54ec8f0d0cf27fbfd7710450.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; These conversational implicatures have many uses in creating an additional meaning to a given utterance.

====Examples====

:"So where do you want to eat? [[Applebee's]] has a huge selection of burgers, appetizers, salads, and drinks! Everything is super affordable, too."

As seen here, this utterance flouts the maxim of quantity because of the extra amount of information given about the types of options and pricing. Giving examples about the types of options at the restaurant and mentioning their prices gives much more information than needed in reference to a name of a restaurant. Also, this example flouts the maxim of relevance because the name of a restaurant is not directly relevant to a list of food items and prices.

:"Who's driving?"
:"Well, my car only fits three people."

In this context, the addressee is flouting the maxim of relevance, because the question of who is driving is not directly related to the number of people that someone's car can fit. Also, the use of ''only'' is a quantity maxim that semantically flouts that there is a maximum number of people that can fit in the car; and, that the number of people present exceeds this limit. 

:"What items on your menu are dairy free?"
:"The lobster mac and cheese."

In this example, the addressee is flouting the maxim of quality because the utterance of mac and cheese is known to not always be dairy free. Since this utterance is not true, we can conclude that the maxim of quality is being violated. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|title=Conversational Implicatures|url=http://www.bu.edu/linguistics/UG/course/lx502/_docs/lx502-implicatures.pdf|ref=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A key characteristic of conversational implicature is that it is context dependent. This means that the utterance will not give rise to the implicature if said in a different context. Conversational implicatures are cancellable, meaning that the implicature may be canceled with further information or context:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introduction to Pragmatics|last=Birner|first=Betty J.|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell, A John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd., Publication|year=2013|isbn=|location=Chichester, West Sussex, UK|pages=62-66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:(a) "That cake looks delicious."
:''I would like a piece of that cake.''
:(b) "That cake looks delicious, but it looks too rich for me."

We see in example (a) the implicature underneath is created. However, with the introduction of new information in example (b), the speaker is able to cancel the conversational implicature which was arisen.

===Scalar Implicature===
Scalar implicatures are implicatures that have both a semantic and pragmatic use in language.&lt;ref name="scalar-implicatures"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Holtgraves|first1=Thomas|last2=Kraus|first2=Brian|title=Processing scalar implicatures in conversational contexts: An ERP study|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0911604417300490?via%3Dihub}}&lt;/ref&gt; These types of implicatures are types of quantity maxims. Some of these implicatures include "some", "few", and "many".

The implicature itself has a meaning and social use that imply something about an object. For example:
:"John ate ''some'' of the cookies."
Here, the use of ''some'' semantically implies that more than one cookie was eaten. Consequently, ''some'' pragmatically implies that not every cookie was eaten, but more than one was.
:"I only need a ''few'' cupcakes for the dinner tomorrow."
Here, the use of ''few'' semantically implies that more than one cupcake is needed, while pragmatically implies that more than one BUT not many are needed for the dinner.

The use of these implicatures flout to the addressee that semantically, a nonspecific amount exists in the utterance; and, pragmatically, that the quantity is defined in a certain interval of large or small.&lt;ref name="scalar-implicatures"/&gt;

===Conventional implicature===

Conventional implicature is independent of the cooperative principle and its four maxims. A statement always carries its conventional implicature.

:''Donovan is poor but happy.''

This sentence implies poverty and happiness are not compatible but in spite of this Donovan is still happy. The conventional interpretation of the word "but" will always create the implicature of a sense of contrast. So ''Donovan is poor but happy'' will always necessarily imply "Surprisingly Donovan is happy in spite of being poor".

==Implicature vs entailment==
Implicature differs from [[entailment (linguistics)|entailment]]. Sentences with implicatures are open to interpretation because they “require contextual factors and conventions [...] observed in conversation.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Entailments must follow the literal meaning of utterances and do not require context outside of a given utterance, and thus also cannot be cancelled&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ello.uos.de/field.php/Pragmatics/PragmaticsConversationalImplicature|title=ELLO|website=www.ello.uos.de|access-date=2018-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Example of entailment:

:Sentence A: “The President was assassinated”
:Sentence B: “The president is dead”

''If'' A is true, B '''must''' be true. “The President was assassinated” entails “The president is dead” No alterations can be made to the truth  A without changing the truth of B.

Example of implicature:

:Sentence A: “Raj was late to the wedding after he crashed his car.”
:Sentence B: “Raj was late to the wedding '''because''' he crashed his car.”
:Sentence C: “A week '''after''' crashing his car, Raj was late to the wedding.”

''If'' A is true, B and/or C can be true. “Raj was late to the wedding after he crashed his car” implicates “Raj was late to the wedding because he crashed his car” but could also mean “A week after crashing his car, Raj was late to the wedding.” Neither B nor C must be true for A to be true.

For example, in fields such as [[physics]], [[chemistry]], or [[biology]], ''in situ'' may describe the way a measurement is taken, that is, in the same place the phenomenon is occurring without isolating it from other systems or altering the original conditions of the test.

== Aerospace ==
In the [[aerospace industry]], equipment on-board aircraft must be tested ''in situ'', or in place, to confirm everything functions properly as a system. Individually, each piece may work but interference from nearby equipment may create unanticipated problems. Special test equipment is available for this ''in situ'' testing.

== Archaeology ==
[[File:Hohokam Arrowhead Sahuarita Arizona 2014.jpg|thumb|Ancient [[Hohokam]] arrowhead ''in situ''.]]

In [[archaeology]], ''in situ'' refers to an artifact that has not been moved from its original place of deposition. In other words, it is stationary, meaning "still." An artifact being ''in situ'' is critical to the interpretation of that artifact and, consequently, of the culture which formed it. Once an artifact's 'find-site' has been recorded, the artifact can then be moved for conservation, further interpretation and display. An artifact that is not discovered ''in situ'' is considered out of context and as not providing an accurate picture of the associated culture. However, the out of context artifact can provide scientists with an example of types and locations of ''in situ'' artifacts yet to be discovered. When excavating a burial site or surface deposit "in situ" refers to cataloging, recording, mapping, photographing human remains in the position they are discovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The label ''in situ'' indicates only that the object has not been "newly" moved. Thus, an archaeological ''in situ'' find may be an object that was historically looted from another place, an item of "booty" of a past war, a traded item, or otherwise of foreign origin. Consequently, the ''in situ'' find site may still not reveal its [[provenance]], but with further detective work may help uncover links that otherwise would remain unknown. It is also possible for archaeological layers to be reworked on purpose or by accident (by humans, natural forces or animals). For example, in a [[Tell (archaeology)|Tell]] mound, where layers are not typically uniform or horizontal, or in land cleared or tilled for farming.

The term ''in situ'' is often used to describe ancient sculpture that was carved in place such as the [[Great Sphinx of Giza|Sphinx]] or [[Petra]]. This distinguishes it from statues that were carved and moved like the [[Colossi of Memnon]], which was moved in ancient times.

== Art ==
In art, ''in situ'' refers to a work of art made specifically for a host site, or that a work of art takes into account the site in which it is installed or exhibited. For a more detailed account see: [[Site-specific art]]. The term can also refer to a work of art created at the site where it is to be displayed, rather than one created in the artist's studio and then installed elsewhere (''e.g.,'' a sculpture carved ''in situ'').  In [[architectural sculpture]] the term is frequently employed to describe sculpture that is carved on a building, frequently from scaffolds, after the building has been erected.&lt;ref name="FriedlandSobocinski2015"&gt;{{cite book

== Biology and biomedical engineering ==
[[File:Natica hebraea.jpg|thumb|Live [[sea snail]], species ''[[Nataea]]'', photographed ''in situ'']]

In [[biology]] and [[biomedical engineering]], ''in situ'' means to examine the phenomenon exactly in place where it occurs (i.e., without moving it to some special medium).

In the case of observations or photographs of living animals, it means that the organism was observed (and photographed) in the wild, exactly as it was found and exactly where it was found. This means it was not taken out of the area. The organism had not been moved to another (perhaps more convenient) location such as an aquarium.

This phrase ''in situ'' when used in laboratory science such as cell science can mean something intermediate between ''[[in vivo]]'' and ''[[in vitro]]''. For example, examining a [[w:cell (biology)|cell]] within a whole [[organ (anatomy)|organ]] intact and under [[perfusion]] may be ''in situ'' investigation. This would not be ''in vivo'' as the donor is sacrificed by experimentation, but it would not be the same as working with the cell alone (a common scenario for ''in vitro'' experiments).

''In vitro'' was among the first attempts to qualitatively and quantitatively analyze natural occurrences in the lab. Eventually, the limitation of ''in vitro'' experimentation was that they were not conducted in natural environments. To compensate for this problem, ''in vivo'' experimentation allowed testing to occur in the original organism or environment. To bridge the dichotomy of benefits associated with both methodologies, ''in situ'' experimentation allowed the controlled aspects of ''in vitro'' to become coalesced with the natural environmental compositions of ''in vivo'' experimentation.

In conservation of [[Germplasm|genetic resources]], "[[in situ conservation|''in situ'' conservation]]" (also "on-site [[Conservation movement|conservation]]") is the process of protecting an [[endangered species|endangered]] [[plant]] or [[animal]] [[species]] in its natural [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]], as opposed to [[Ex situ conservation|''ex situ'' conservation]] (also "off-site conservation").

== Chemistry and chemical engineering ==
In chemistry, ''in situ'' typically means "in the reaction mixture."

There are numerous situations in which chemical intermediates are synthesized ''in situ'' in various processes. This may be done because the species is unstable, and cannot be isolated, or simply out of convenience. Examples of the former include the [[Corey-Chaykovsky reagent]] and [[adrenochrome]].

In biomedical engineering, protein nanogels made by the in situ polymerization method provide a versatile platform for storage and release of therapeutic proteins. It has tremendous applications for cancer treatment, vaccination, diagnosis, regenerative medicine, and therapies for loss-of-function genetic diseases.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In chemical engineering, ''in situ'' often refers to industrial plant "operations or procedures that are performed in place." For example, aged catalysts in industrial reactors may be regenerated in place (''in situ'') without being removed from the reactors.

== Civil engineering ==
In [[architecture]] and [[building]], ''in situ'' refers to construction which is carried out at the building site using raw materials. Compare that with ''prefabricated'' construction, in which building components are made in a factory and then transported to the building site for assembly. For example, [[concrete slab]]s may be ''in situ'' (also "cast-in-place") or ''prefabricated''.

'''''In situ''''' techniques are often more labour-intensive, and take longer, but the materials are cheaper, and the work is versatile and adaptable. ''Prefabricated'' techniques are usually much quicker, therefore saving money on labour costs, but factory-made parts can be expensive. They are also inflexible, and must often be designed on a grid, with all details fully calculated in advance. Finished units may require special handling due to excessive dimensions.

The phrase may also refer to those assets which are present at or near a project site. In this case, it is used to designate the state of an unmodified sample taken from a given stockpile.

Site construction usually involves grading the existing soil surface so that material is "cut" out of one area and "filled" in another area creating a flat pad on an existing slope.  The term "in situ" distinguishes soil still in its existing condition from soil modified (filled) during construction.  The differences in the soil properties for supporting building loads, accepting underground utilities, and infiltrating water persist indefinitely.

== Computer science ==
{{citation needed span|text=In [[computer science]] an ''in situ'' operation is one that occurs without interrupting the normal state of a system|date=June 2015}}. For example, a file backup may be restored over a running system, without needing to take the system down to perform the restore. In the context of a database, a restore would allow the database system to continue to be available to users while a restore happened. An ''in situ'' upgrade would allow an [[operating system]], [[firmware]] or [[computer program|application]] to be upgraded while the system was still running, perhaps without the need to reboot it, depending on the sophistication of the system.

Another use of the term in-situ that appears in Computer Science focuses primarily on the use of technology and user interfaces to provide continuous access to situationally relevant information in various locations and contexts&lt;ref&gt; {{cite journal | last1= Ens|first1=Barrett |last2=Irani |first2=Pourang |date=March 2017 |title= Data representations for in-situ exploration of health and fitness data |url= https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7436646 |journal= IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications|volume= 37|issue=2 |pages=66-79 |doi=10.1109/MCG.2016.38 |access-date=2018-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1= Willett  |first1= Wesley  |last2=Jansen |first2=Yvonne | last3=Dragicevic |first3=Pierre |date=August 2016 |title= Embedded Data Representations |url= https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.uml.idm.oclc.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=7539328|journal= IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VISUALIZATION AND COMPUTER GRAPHICS|volume= 23|issue=1 |pages=461-470 |doi= 10.1109/TVCG.2016.2598608 |access-date=2018-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

{{citation needed span|text=An [[algorithm]] is said to be an [[in-place algorithm|''in situ'' algorithm, or in-place algorithm]], if the extra amount of memory required to execute the algorithm is [[O(1)]]|date=June 2015}}, that is, does not exceed a constant no matter how large the input ---except for space for recursive calls on the "call stack." Typically such an algorithm operates on [[object (computer science)|data objects]] directly in place rather than making copies of them. 

For example, [[heapsort]] is an ''in situ'' sorting algorithm, which sorts the elements of an array in place. [[Quicksort]] is an ''in situ'' sorting algorithm, but in the worst case it requires linear space on the call stack (this can be reduced to log space). Merge sort is generally not written as an ''in situ'' algorithm. 

In designing [[user interface]]s, {{citation needed span|text=the term ''in situ'' means that a particular user action can be performed without going to another window|date=June 2015}}, for example, if a word processor displays an image and allows the image to be edited without launching a separate image editor, this is called ''in situ editing.''

AJAX partial page data updates is another example of ''in situ'' in a Web UI/UX context. ''Web 2.0'' included AJAX and the concept of asynchronous requests to servers to replace a portion of a web page with new data, without reloading
the entire page, as the early HTML model dictated. Arguably, ''all'' asynchronous data transfers or ''any'' background task is ''in situ'' as the normal state is normally unaware of background tasks, usually notified on completion
by a callback mechanism.

In Big Data space, in situ data would mean bringing the computation to where data is located, rather than the other way&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.flashmemorysummit.com/English/Collaterals/Proceedings/2014/20140806_202E_Alves.pdf|title=In-Situ Processing Presentation|last=Alves|first=Vladimir|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; like in traditional RDBMS systems where data is moved to computational space.

== Design and advertising ==
In design and advertising the term typically means the superimposing of theoretical design elements onto photographs of real world locations. This is a pre-visualization tool to aid in illustrating a proof of concept.

== Earth and atmospheric sciences ==
In [[physical geography]] and the [[Earth science]]s, ''in situ'' typically describes natural material or processes prior to transport. For example, ''in situ'' is used in relation to the distinction between [[weathering]] and [[erosion]], the difference being that erosion requires a transport medium (such as [[Aeolian processes|wind]], [[glacier|ice]], or [[water]]), whereas weathering occurs ''in situ''. [[geochemistry|Geochemical]] processes are also often described as occurring to material ''in situ''.

In the [[atmospheric sciences]], ''in situ'' refers to obtained through direct contact with the respective subject, such as a [[radiosonde]] measuring a parcel of air or an [[anemometer]] measuring wind, as opposed to [[remote sensing]] such as weather [[Weather radar|radar]] or [[Weather satellite|satellites]].

== Economics ==
In economics, ''in situ'' is used when referring to the ''in place'' storage of a product, usually a natural resource. More generally, it refers to any situation where there is no out-of-pocket cost to store the product so that the only storage cost is the opportunity cost of waiting longer to get your money when the product is eventually sold. Examples of ''in situ'' storage would be oil and gas wells, all types of mineral and gem mines, stone quarries, timber that has reached an age where it could be harvested, and agricultural products that do not need a physical storage facility such as hay.

== Electrochemistry ==
In [[electrochemistry]], the phrase in situ refers to performing electrochemical experiments under operating conditions of the electrochemical cell, i.e., under potential control. This is opposed to doing ex situ experiments that are performed under the absence of potential control. Potential control preserves the electrochemical environment essential to maintain the double layer structure intact and the electron transfer reactions occurring at that particular potential in the electrode/electrolyte interphasial region.

== Environmental remediation ==
''In situ'' can refer to where a clean up or [[Environmental remediation|remediation]] of a [[polluted]] site is performed using and simulating the natural processes in the [[soil]], contrary to ''[[ex situ]]'' where contaminated soil is excavated and cleaned elsewhere, off site.

== Experimental physics ==
In [[experimental physics]] ''in situ'' typically refers to a method of data collection or manipulation of a sample without exposure to an external environment. For example, the Si(111) 7x7 surface reconstruction is visible using a [[scanning tunneling microscope]] when it is prepared and analyzed ''in situ''.

== Experimental psychology ==
In psychology [[experiment]]s, ''in situ'' typically refers to those experiments done in a field setting as opposed to a laboratory setting.

== Gastronomy ==
In [[gastronomy]], "in situ"&lt;!-- or "in situs" --&gt; refers to the art of cooking with the different resources that are available at the site of the event. Here a person is not going to the restaurant, but the restaurant comes to the person's home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Law ==
In [[legal]] contexts, ''in situ'' is often used for its literal meaning. For example, in [[Hong Kong]], "''in situ'' land exchange" involves the government exchanging the original or expired [[Leasehold estate|lease]] of a piece of land with a new [[Land grant|grant]] or re-grant with the same piece of land or a portion of that.

In the field of recognition of governments under public international law the term ''in situ'' is used to distinguish between an [[Government in exile|exiled government]] and a government with effective control over the territory, i.e. the government ''in situ''.

== Linguistics ==
In [[linguistics]], specifically [[syntax]], an element may be said to be ''in situ'' if it is pronounced in the position where it is interpreted. For example, [[question]]s in languages such as [[Chinese language|Chinese]] have ''in situ'' wh-elements, with structures comparable to "John bought what?" with ''what'' in the same position in the sentence as the grammatical object would be in its affirmative counterpart (for example, "John bought bread"). An example of an [[English language|English]] wh-element that is not ''in situ'' (see [[wh-movement]]): "What did John buy?"

== Literature ==
In [[literature]] ''in situ'' is used to describe a condition. The [[Rosetta Stone]], for example, was originally erected in a courtyard, for public viewing. Most pictures of the famous stone are not ''in situ'' pictures of it erected, as it would have been originally. The stone was uncovered as part of building material, within a wall. Its '''in situ''' condition today is that it is erected, vertically, on public display at the [[British Museum]] in London, England.

== Medicine ==
[[File:In situ carcinoma.jpg|thumb|In addition to benign tumors, there are in situ tumors and invasive tumors. In situ tumors do not invade the basement membrane, whereas invasive tumors do invade the basement membrane." Diagram of an in [[Carcinoma in situ|situ carcinoma]]]]

In [[oncology]]: for a [[carcinoma]], ''[[Carcinoma in situ|in situ]]'' means that [[malignant]] cells are present as a tumor but have not metastasized, or invaded, beyond the basement membrane of where the tumor was discovered. This can happen anywhere in the body, such as the skin, breast tissue, or lung. This type of tumor can often, depending on where it is located, be removed by [[surgery]].

In [[anatomy]]: ''in situ'' refers to viewing structures as they appear in normal healthy bodies. For example, one can open up a [[cadaver]]'s abdominal cavity and view the liver ''in situ'' or one can look at an isolated liver that has been removed from the cadaver's body.

In [[nursing]], "in situ" describes any devices or appliances on the patient's body that remain in their desired and optimal position.

In [[medical simulation]], "in situ" refers to the practice of clinical professionals using high fidelity patient simulators to train for clinical practice in patient care environments, such as wards, operating rooms, and other settings, rather than in dedicated simulation training facilities.

In biomedical, protein nanogels made by the in situ polymerization method provide a versatile platform for storage and release of therapeutic proteins. It has tremendous applications for cancer treatment, vaccination, diagnosis, regenerative medicine, and therapies for loss-of-function genetic diseases.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

== Mining ==
''In situ leaching'' or ''in situ recovery'' refers to the mining technique of injecting water underground to dissolve ore and bringing the uranium-impregnated water to the surface for extraction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf27.html In Situ Leach (ISL) Mining of Uranium]. world-nuclear.org&lt;/ref&gt;

== Petroleum production ==
''In situ'' refers to recovery techniques which apply heat or solvents to [[heavy crude oil]] or [[bitumen]] reservoirs beneath the earth's crust. There are several varieties of ''in situ'' techniques, but the ones which work best in the [[oil sands]] use heat (steam).

The most common type of ''in situ'' petroleum production is referred to as SAGD ([[steam-assisted gravity drainage]]) this is becoming very popular in the Alberta Oil Sands.

== RF transmission ==
In [[radio frequency]] (RF) transmission systems, ''in situ'' is often used to describe the location of various components while the system is in its standard transmission mode, rather than operation in a test mode. For example, if an ''in situ'' [[wattmeter]] is used in a commercial broadcast transmission system, the [[wattmeter]] can accurately measure power while the station is "on air."

== Space-related ==
Future space exploration or [[terraforming]] may rely on [[In-situ resource utilization|obtaining supplies ''in situ'']], such as previous plans to power the [[Orion (Constellation program)|Orion space vehicle]] with fuel minable on the moon. The [[Mars Direct]] mission concept is based primarily on the ''in situ'' fuel production using [[Sabatier reaction]].

In the [[space sciences]], ''in situ'' refers to measurements of the particle and field environment that the satellite is embedded in, such as the detection of energetic particles in the [[solar wind]], or magnetic field measurements from a [[magnetometer]].

== Urban planning ==
In urban planning, in-situ upgrading is an approach to and method of upgrading [[informal settlement]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Vacuum technology ==
In [[vacuum technology]], ''in situ'' baking refers to heating parts of the vacuum system while they are under vacuum in order to drive off volatile substances that may be [[Absorption (chemistry)|absorbed]] or [[adsorbed]] on the walls so they cannot cause [[outgassing]].

== Road assistance ==
The term ''in situ'', used as "repair in situ," means to repair a vehicle at the place where it has a breakdown.

'''Judeo-Tat''' or '''Juhuri''' (''çuhuri'' / жугьури / ז'אוּהאוּראִ) is the traditional language of the [[Mountain Jews]] of the eastern [[Caucasus Mountains]], especially [[Azerbaijan]] and [[Dagestan]], now mainly spoken in Israel.&lt;ref name=E18&gt;{{Ethnologue18|jdt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The language is a form of [[Persian language|Persian]]; it belongs to the southwestern group of the [[Iranian languages|Iranian]] division of the [[Indo-European languages]]. The [[Tat language (Caucasus)|Tat language]] is spoken by the [[Muslim]] [[Tat people (Caucasus)|Tats]] of [[Azerbaijan]], a group to which the Mountain Jews were mistakenly considered to belong during the era of [[Soviet historiography]] though the languages probably originated in the same region of the Persian empire. The words ''Juvuri'' and ''Juvuro'' literally translate as "Jewish" and "Jews".

Judeo-Tat has [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] ([[Hebrew]]/[[Aramaic]]/[[Arabic]]) elements on all linguistic levels. Judeo-Tat has the Semitic sound "[[ayin|ayin/ayn]]" (ع/ע), whereas no neighbouring languages have it.

Judeo-Tat is an [[endangered language]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.helsinki.fi/~tasalmin/chris.html Published in: Encyclopedia of the world’s endangered languages. Edited by Christopher Moseley. London &amp; New York: Routledge, 2007. 211–280.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Clifton /&gt; classified as "definitely endangered" by [[UNESCO]]'s [[Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?pg=00206 UNESCO Interactive Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090222090430/http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?pg=00206 |date=2009-02-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--UNESCO Endangered Language Criteria: 1.

==Alphabet==
In the early 20th century Judeo-Tat used the [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew script]]. In the 1920s the [[Latin script]] was adapted for it; later it was written in [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]]. The use of the Hebrew alphabet has enjoyed renewed popularity.

==Influences and etymology==
{{refimprove|article's section called "Influences and etymology"|date=June 2009}}
Judeo-Tat is a Southwest Iranian language (as is modern [[Persian language|Persian]]) and is much more closely related to modern Persian than most other Iranian languages of the Caucasus e.g. [[Talysh language|Talysh]], [[Ossetian language|Ossetian]], and [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} However, it also bears strong influence from other sources:

'''[[Persian language|Medieval Persian]]''': Postpositions are used predominantly in lieu of prepositions e.g. modern Persian: باز او &gt; Judeo-Tat ''æ uræ-voz''  "with him/her".

'''[[Arabic language|Arabic]]''': like in modern Persian, a significant portion of the vocabulary is Arabic in origin. Unlike modern Persian, Judeo-Tat has almost universally retained the original pharyngeal/uvular phonemes of Arabic e.g. {{IPA|/ʕæsæl/}} "honey" (Arab. {{lang|ar|عسل}}), {{IPA|/sæbæħ/}} "morning" (Arab. {{lang|ar|صباح}}).

'''[[Hebrew]]''': As other Jewish dialects, the language also has many Hebrew loanwords e.g. {{IPA|/ʃulħon/}} "table" (Heb. {{Hebrew|שלחן}}), {{IPA|/mozol/}} "luck" (Heb. {{Hebrew|מזל}}), {{IPA|/ʕoʃiɾ/}} "rich" (Heb. {{Hebrew|עשיר}}). Hebrew words are typically pronounced in the tradition of other [[Mizrahi Jews]].  Examples: {{Hebrew|ח}} and {{Hebrew|ע}} are pronounced pharyngeally (like Arabic {{lang|ar|ح}}&amp;lrm;, {{lang|ar|ع}} respectively); {{Hebrew|ק}} is pronounced as a [[voiced uvular plosive]] (like Persian {{lang|fa|ق/غ}}). Classical Hebrew {{IPA|/w/}} ({{Hebrew|ו}}) and {{IPA|/aː/}} ([[kamatz]]), however, are typically pronounced as /v/ and /o/ respectively (similar to the Persian/Ashkenazi traditions, but unlike the Iraqi tradition, which retains {{IPA|/w/}} and {{IPA|/aː/}})

'''[[Azerbaijani language|Azeri]]''': [[Vowel harmony]] and many loan words

'''[[Russian language|Russian]]''': Loanwords adopted after the Russian Empire's annexation of Daghestan and Azerbaijan

'''[[Northeast Caucasian languages]]''': e.g. {{IPA|/tʃuklæ/}} "small" (probably the same origin as the medieval Caucasian city name "Sera-chuk" mentioned by [[Ibn Battuta]], meaning "little Sera")

Other common phonology/morphology changes from classical Persian/Arabic/Hebrew:
* {{IPA|/aː/}} &gt; /o/, /æ/, or /u/ e.g. {{IPA|/kitob/}} "book" (Arab. {{lang|ar|كتاب)}}, {{IPA|/ɾæħ/}} "road/path" (Pers. {{lang|fa|راه}}), {{IPA|/ɢurbu/}} "sacrifice" (Arab. or Aramaic {{IPA|/qurbaːn/}})
* /o/ &gt; /u/ e.g. {{IPA|/ovʃolum/}} "Absalom" (Heb. {{Hebrew|אבשלום}})
* /u/ &gt; /y/, especially under the influence of [[vowel harmony]]
* Stress on final syllable words
* Dropping of the final /n/, e.g. /soχtæ/ "to make" (Pers. {{lang|fa|ساختن}}){{Clarify|date=June 2017|reason=transcriptions needed throughout}}

==Dialects==
Being a variety of the Tat language, Judeo-Tat itself can be divided into several dialects:
*Quba dialect (traditionally spoken in [[Quba]] and [[Qırmızı Qəsəbə]]).
*Derbent dialect (traditionally spoken in the town of [[Derbent]] and the surrounding villages), has been used as a standard form of Judeo-Tat.
*Kaitag dialect (spoken in the [[North Caucasus]]).
The dialects of [[Oghuz (city)|Oğuz]] (formerly Vartashen) and the now extinct Jewish community of [[Mücü]] have not been studied well and thus cannot be classified.&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://www.jewish-heritage.org/ve13a7r.htm Language of the Mountain Jews of Dagestan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050501081420/http://www.jewish-heritage.org/ve13a7r.htm |date=2005-05-01 }} by E.Nazarova&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kelantan-Pattani Malay''', often referred to in Thailand as '''Yawi''' (in Thai) or '''Jawi''' (in Patani Malay), and in Kelantan as ''Baso Kelaté'', is an [[Austronesian | Austronesian language ]] and a Malayic / [[Malayan languages|Malayan language]] spoken in the Malaysian state of [[Kelantan]] and the neighbouring southernmost provinces of [[Thailand]]. It is the primary spoken language of [[Thai Malay]]s, but is also used as a [[lingua franca]] by ethnic Southern Thais in rural areas, Muslim and non-Muslim, and the ''samsam'', a mostly Thai-speaking population of mixed Malay and Thai ancestry.

Kelantan–Pattani Malay is a highly divergent dialect of [[Malay language|Malay]] because of the geographical isolation of the dialect from the rest of the Malay world by high mountains, deep rainforest and the Gulf of Thailand. In Thailand, it is influenced by Thai. Several varieties exist, but they are mutually comprehensible to the extent that native speakers of Pattani and Kelantanese often cannot differentiate each other.

Kelantanese–Pattani Malay is distinct enough that radio broadcasts in Standard Malay cannot be understood easily by native speakers of Kelantanese–Pattani Malay who are not taught the standard language, for example, those in Thailand. Unlike Malaysia where Standard Malay is compulsory in the school curriculum, no one is required to learn Standard Malay in Thailand, and so there is potentially less language influence from standard Malay but potentially more from [[Thai language|Thai]]. It is different also from [[Kedah Malay]] and [[Terengganu Malay|Terengganuan Malay]], but both languages have close similarities with the Kelantanese-Pattani Malay language.

==Names==
The language is often referred to in Thai as ''Phasa Yawi'' (Thai: ภาษายาวี {{IPA-th|pʰāːsǎː jāːwīː|}}), which is a corruption of the Malay name for the modified Arabic alphabet for writing Malay, [[Jawi script|Jawi]] (Yawi: جاوي, Rumi: Jawi, {{IPA-xx|dʑaˈwi|IPA}}).  It is also referred to in Thai as ''Phasa Malayu Pattani'' (Thai: ภาษามลายูปัตตานี {{IPA-th|pʰāːsǎː mālāːjūː pàttāːnīː|}}) and similarly locally in Malay as ''Bahasa Malayu Patani'' (Jawi: بهاس ملايو ڤطاني, Rumi: Bahasa Melayu Patani, {{IPA-xx|baˈsɔ ˈnːaju ˈtːaniŋ|local}}). The dialect is often simply just called ''Bahasa Patani''.

Kelantanese is known in Standard Malay as {{lang|ms|Bahasa Kelantan}}, and in Kelantanese as ''Baso Kelate''.

==Distribution==
Pattani Malay is the main language of the provinces of [[Narathiwat]], [[Yala Province|Yala]], [[Pattani]]  where the Malay ethnic group is the dominant one. Also some part of [[Songkhla]]. It is less spoken in [[Satun]], where even the ethnic Malays generally speak [[Southern Thai language|Southern Thai]] and [[Kedah Malay]]. It is also spoken in scattered villages as far north as [[Hat Yai]].  In the past, Malay was the main language as far north as the [[Isthmus of Kra]], the traditional division between [[Central Thailand]] and [[Southern Thailand]], based on the preponderance of etymologically Malay place names.

Kelantanese is spoken in the state of [[Kelantan]], as well as in [[Besut]] and [[Setiu]] districts of [[Terengganu]] and the [[Perhentian Islands]]. Also in [[Merapoh]] district of [[Pahang]]. Many people in the districts of [[Baling]], [[Sik]] and [[Padang Terap]] in [[Kedah]] as well as [[Grik]] and [[Hulu Perak]] districts of [[Perak]] speak Kelantanese dialects, since most of the Malay people there are the descendants of Kelantanese migrants and Pattani refugees.

==Writing system==
Kelantanese Malay has an older and a richer literary history than standard Malay.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}  It is written in the [[Jawi alphabet]], based on the [[Arabic script]], which is where the name "Yawi/Jawi" for the language comes from. This is in stark contrast to the rest of the general population of Malay speakers in both [[Malaysia]] and [[Indonesia]] that now use the [[Latin script]], known in Malay as ''rumi'' (رومي), for daily communication.  Today, Pattani Malay itself is generally not a written language, though it is sometimes written in informal settings or [[eye dialect]]. When writing is needed, an old-fashioned variety of standard Malay is used rather than the local dialect. A phonetic rendering of Pattani Malay in the [[Thai alphabet]] has been introduced, but it has not met with much success, due to the socio-religious significance of Jawi to Muslim Malays, as well as because of numerous inconsistencies and inaccuracies.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

==History==
[[Southern Thailand]] has continued to be a region affected by two cultural spheres: the mainly Buddhist, Thai-speaking [[Siam]]ese kingdoms and the mainly Muslim, Malay-speaking sultanates. The region was a warehouse of trade where merchants from Europe, India, Arabia, China, Siam, and the other Malay world met. At first dominated by Hindu-Buddhist Indian influences, the great kingdom of [[Srivijaya]] would later fall in chaos. [[Islam]] was introduced by Arab and Indian traders in the 11th century and has been the dominant religion ever since, replacing the Buddhism and Hinduism that had held sway before. By the 14th century, the area became vassals to [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya]], but the region was autonomous and never fully incorporated into the modern Thai [[nation-state]] till 1902. This political autonomy and isolation from the rest of the Malay world allowed for preservation of the Malay language and culture but also led to the divergence of the dialect.

==Differences between Yawi and Standard Malay==
Kelantanese is different enough from Standand Malay that it is often unintelligible to speakers of the standard language.  Differences include different vocabulary, but also involve regular sound changes. The influence of Southern Thai and Pattani Malay upon each other is great, and both have large numbers of loanwords from the other.  The influence of the Thai language is one factor that makes comprehension between Pattani Malay and Standard Malay difficult.

==Bio==
Tubosun was born in [[Ibadan]], [[Nigeria]] on 22 September 1981, and holds a Masters in Linguistics from [[Southern Illinois University Edwardsville]] (2012) and a BA from the [[University of Ibadan]] (2005). He also studied briefly at [[Moi University]], [[Eldoret]], [[Kenya]], in April 2005, as part of a [[MacArthur Foundation]]-sponsored Socio-Cultural Exchange Programme.

He was granted a [[Fulbright Fellowship|Fulbright scholarship]] in 2009 through which he taught [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] at [[Southern Illinois University Edwardsville]] in 2009–10. In 2010, he worked as a volunteer adult literacy tutor, with resettled immigrants, at the International Institute of [[St. Louis]], Missouri, and later as a high school teacher of [[English language]] in [[Lagos]], [[Nigeria]].

==Language advocacy==
=== Twitter in Yoruba Campaign ===
Tubosun is known for his work in language advocacy. In 2012, he started an online campaign to demand that Twitter include [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] (his mother tongue) in the list of languages into which Twitter was being translated: 1 March 2012 was declared "the Tweet Yoruba Day" to call attention to the matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://globalvoices.org/2013/03/06/nigerians-shake-up-twitter-with-yoruba-language-tweets/|title=Nigerians Shake Up Twitter with Yoruba-Language Tweets|last=Egbunike|first=Nwachukwu|date=2013|website=Global Voices}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign involved other speakers of Yoruba online tweeting only in the language and directing their comments to the Twitter translation platform, and it eventually yielded first an acknowledgment of the protest and then a promise to act in support of the idea.

The campaign continued on 1 March 2013 and again on 1 March 2014. In August 2014, Twitter announced through a tweet that they were now adding Yoruba (along with Esperanto) to the translation platform, ending the two years of advocacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://techloy.com/2012/03/02/twitter-supports-yoruba/|title=Twitter Promises Support For Yoruba in Coming Months|last=Oluwafemi|first=Bankole|date=2 March 2012|website=TechLoy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://encomium.ng/twitter-can-now-be-translated-into-yoruba/|title=Twitter Can Now be Translated into Yoruba|last=|first=|date=4 December 2014|website=Encomium|publisher=|access-date=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://techcabal.com/2014/11/14/twitter-yoruba/|title=It Took Only Two Years, But Twitter Is Finally Getting Translated into Yoruba|last=Bankole|first=Oluwafemi|date=14 November 2014|website=TechCabal|publisher=|access-date=|quote="As we speak, Kola and others are working to translate the Twitter's standard glossary of terms."}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201504211070.html/|title=Cultural Export|last=Elusoji|first=Solomon|date=21 April 2015|website=This Day Live/AllAfrica|quote="An online Yoruba dictionary has been launched to help the Yoruba race in Nigeria go beyond borders."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Yoruba Names Project ===
[[File:Kola Tubosun.jpg|thumb|404x404px|Kola Tubosun as a Fulbright Scholar teaching Yoruba at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville in 2010.]]Tubosun founded the "[[The Yoruba Name Project|Yorùbá Names Project]]" at YorubaName.com in March 2015 after months of crowdfunding as&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.voanews.com/content/online-dictionary-helps-nigerians-decode-their-names/3208016.html/ "Online Dictionary Helps Nigerians Decode Their Names"], ''[[Voice of America]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://techcabal.com/2015/03/12/yorubanames-com-hits-crowd-funding-benchmark/ "YorubaName.com Hits Crowdfunding Benchmark"], ''TechCabal''.&lt;/ref&gt; an effort to document all names in Yoruba in an accessible multimedia format while bringing together a community of interested linguists and other culture enthusiasts to document the African cultural and linguistic experience on the web. He is also involved in setting up a version for [[Igbo language]] at IgboName.com. On 8 August 2015, the project released a free Yorùbá Keyboard software for Mac and Windows to allow its users type in [[Yoruba language|Yorùbá language]] on the internet&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://radar.techcabal.com/t/yoruba-keyboard-layouts-for-windows-and-mac/1630|title=Yoruba keyboard layouts for Windows and Mac|website=Radar from TechCabal|language=en|access-date=2017-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; with an update to cater for [[Igbo language|Igbo]] in July 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gadgetsreview.com.ng/yorubaname-team-launch-yoruba-and-igbo-keyboards/|title=Yorubaname Team Launch Yoruba and Igbo keyboards - Gadget Reviews Nigeria|date=2016-07-20|language=en-US|access-date=2016-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://technologytimes.ng/combined-igboyoruba-keyboard-layout-now-available/|title=Combined Igbo, Yoruba keyboard made available on Yorubaname.com|date=2016-07-18|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2017, the project released the first online speech synthesizer for Yoruba,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.orishaimage.com/blog/yorubatts|title=The Yorùbá Speech Synthesizer|work=Orisha Image|access-date=2018-01-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; created after crowdfunding and months of research&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@baroka/what-were-building-next-8b34f7ff545c|title=What We’re Building Next|date=2017-03-14|website=Medium|access-date=2017-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.okayafrica.com/culture-2/yoruba-text-to-speech-app/|title=A Yoruba Text-to-Speech App Is Being Brought to Life Through This New Tech Initiative|date=2017-03-23|work=OkayAfrica|access-date=2017-03-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2017, in collaboration with the Orisha Image Blog, the project released a free Yoruba learning audio course.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.okayafrica.com/free-multilingual-audio-course-yoruba-language-olorisha/|title=This Multilingual Audio Course Is a Free Guide to Yoruba for Olorishas Around the World|date=2018-01-11|work=OkayAfrica|access-date=2018-01-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.orishaimage.com/blog/course|title=Yorùbá Melody Audio Course|work=Orisha Image|access-date=2018-01-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Work at Google ===
Between October 2015 and July 2016, Tubosun worked as a Linguist at [[Google]] with the Speech team as Project Manager.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.yorubaname.com/2016/12/16/e%e1%b9%a3u-isnt-the-devil-but-you-knew-that-already/|title="Èṣù" isn’t "the Devil"; But You Knew That Already|date=2016-12-16|website=Yoruba Name|access-date=2017-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.orishaimage.com/blog/kola-tubosun|title=Interview with Yoruba writer Kola Tubosun|access-date=2017-01-09|newspaper=Orisha Image}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While at Google, he was also instrumental to changing the erstwhile inaccurate translation of [[Eshu|Esu]] on Google Translate,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.yorubaname.com/2016/12/16/e%e1%b9%a3u-isnt-the-devil-but-you-knew-that-already/|title="Èṣù" isn’t "the Devil"; But You Knew That Already|date=2016-12-16|website=Yoruba Name|access-date=2017-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; which had hitherto caused a lot of backlash in the Yoruba language community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ooduarere.com/news-from-nigeria/breaking-news/esu-is-not-satan-2016-awareness/|title=Esu Is Not Satan 2016 Awareness|work=Ọmọ Oòduà|access-date=2017-03-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.orishaimage.com/blog-gallery/esu-is-not-satan|title=Esu is not Satan|work=Orisha Image|access-date=2017-03-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Translations ===
Tubosun's work in localizing the predictive text input product "T9" was detailed in a memoir/ essay for [[Farafina Magazine]] in 2007 titled "Speaking the Machine".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://issuu.com/farafina/docs/f_12|title=Farafina 12|access-date=2016-11-27|newspaper=issuu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2016, at the [[Aké Arts and Book Festival]], he was instrumental in translating a short story by Kenyan writer [[Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o]] into [[Yoruba language]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://jaladaafrica.org/2016/03/22/jalada-translation-issue-01-ngugi-wa-thiongo/|title=Jalada Translation Issue 01: Ngũgĩ wa Thiong’o|last=Jalada|date=2016-03-22|website=Jalada|access-date=2017-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; part of which he read out at the festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thenewsnigeria.com.ng/2016/11/ngugi-wa-thiongo-ake-arts-and-book-festivals-worthy-headliner/|title=Ngugi wa Thiong’o: Ake Arts and Book Festival’s Worthy Headliner|date=2016-11-25|access-date=2016-11-27|language=en-US|newspaper=The NEWS}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://guardian.ng/art/abeokuta-a-feast-of-books-arts-on-the-rock/|title=Abeokuta… a feast of books, arts on the rock|access-date=2016-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Journalism ===
Tubosun was the president of the Union of Campus Journalists at [[University of Ibadan]] (2002-2004) during &lt;nowiki/&gt;which time he helped institute two prizes for student journalists, as well as set up the first internship opportunities for student journalists with prominent media houses in the country. Some students from that program became full-time journalists upon graduation.

In September 2016, after the demolition of [[Ilojo Bar]], a national monument on Lagos Island, he published a three-part investigative feature in the Nigerian Guardian about the causes, cost, and consequences of the demolition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://guardian.ng/sunday-magazine/demolishing-history/|title=Demolishing history|access-date=2017-03-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://guardian.ng/art/a-tragedy-of-confusing-interests/|title=A tragedy of confusing  interests|access-date=2017-03-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://guardian.ng/art/a-failure-all-around/|title=A failure all around|access-date=2017-03-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Writing activism and advocacy ===
In 2003, during a nine-month strike of the Academic Staff Union of Universities, Tubosun created a petition online admonishing the president and minister of education in Nigeria and warning them of the dangers of a continued elongation of the industrial strike to students and the educational system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200304160127.html|title=Nigeria: Hi-Tech: Students Fight ASUU Strike @ Petitiononline|date=2003-04-16|work=Vanguard (Lagos)|access-date=2017-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200305040012.html|title=Nigeria: Students, Other Stakeholders Seek End to ASUU Strike|date=2003-05-04|work=Vanguard (Lagos)|access-date=2017-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2016, after the election of [[Donald Trump]], he co-wrote a petition to restate "our respect for the dignity of people of all races, faiths, creeds, classes, abilities, ancestries, gender identities, and sexual orientations" and express support for the goals of the Fulbright Program "to bring a little more knowledge, a little more reason, and a little more compassion into world affairs and thereby increase the chance that nations will learn at last to live in peace and friendship" warning that cuts to the program will jeopardize its goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/an-open-letter-from-1500-fulbrighters-regarding-the_us_582b14aee4b02b1f5257a91b|title=An Open Letter From 1,500+ Fulbrighters Regarding The Election Of Trump|last=Tubosun|first=Kola|last2=Dinh|first2=Claire|date=2016-11-15|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-21|last3=Downs|first3=Benjamin}}&lt;/ref&gt; The petition was signed by about 2000 [[Fulbright Program]] grantees and alumni. The [[Fulbright Program]] has so far survived the proposed cut to the US government budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/03/15/us/politics/trump-budget-proposal.html|title=Who Wins and Loses in Trump’s Proposed Budget|last=Parlapiano|first=Alicia|date=2017-03-15|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-03-21|last2=Aisch|first2=Gregor|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2017, Tubosun joined "nearly 300 participants from over 80 countries around the world, including key players involved in the fields of government, arts, philanthropy, heritage preservation, education, media, science and technology" at [[Saadiyat Island]] in [[Abu Dhabi]], to "explore... a wide range of topics all focused on answering how cultural tools can be used to help address significant international challenges and seize emerging opportunities." It was the first edition of the [[Culture Summit Abu Dhabi|Culture Summit]], sponsored by [[Foreign Policy Magazine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gulftoday.ae/portal/36c185bd-6d7a-48b7-ac39-fa62e51f97e9.aspx|title=gulftoday.ae {{!}} Summit to bring creative leaders|website=www.gulftoday.ae|access-date=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1168">In [[formal language]] theory, a '''leftist grammar''' is a [[formal grammar]] on which certain restrictions are made on the left and right sides of the grammar's productions. Only two types of productions are allowed, namely those of the form &lt;math&gt;a \to ba&lt;/math&gt; (insertion rules) and &lt;math&gt;cd \to d&lt;/math&gt; (deletion rules). Here, &lt;math&gt;a,b,c&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; are terminal symbols. This type of grammar was motivated by accessibility problems in the field [[computer security]].&lt;ref name="accessibility="&gt;{{cite conference

'''Literal and figurative language''' is a distinction within some fields of [[language]] analysis, in particular [[Stylistics (field of study)|stylistics]], [[rhetoric]], and [[semantics]]. 
*'''Literal language''' uses words exactly according to their conventionally accepted [[meaning (linguistics)|meaning]]s or [[denotation]].
*'''Figurative''' (or '''non-literal''') '''language''' uses words in a way that deviates from their conventionally accepted definitions in order to convey a more complicated meaning or heightened effect.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/figure%20of%20speech Figure of speech]." ''Merriam-Webster Dictionary''. Merriam-Webster, Inc. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Figurative language is often created by presenting words in such a way that they are equated, compared, or associated with normally unrelated meanings.

Literal usage confers meaning to words, in the sense of the meaning they have by themselves, outside any figure of speech.&lt;ref name="JaszczoltTurner2003"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jaszczolt|first1=Katarzyna M..|last2=Turner|first2=Ken|title=Meaning Through Language Contrast.

[[Aristotle]] and later the Roman [[Quintilian]] were among the early analysts of [[rhetoric]] who expounded on the differences between literal and figurative language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|DUPLICATE_title=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SUEtEa9nUWQC&amp;pg=PA129|title=A Glossary of Literary Terms|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2011|isbn=9780495898023|edition=10|author1=M.H. Abrams|author2=Geoffrey Harpham}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1769, [[Frances Brooke]]'s novel ''The History of Emily Montague'' was used in the earliest ''Oxford English Dictionary'' citation for the figurative sense of ''literally''; the sentence from the novel used was, "He is a fortunate man to be introduced to such a party of fine women at his arrival; it is literally ''to feed among the lilies''."&lt;ref name="languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu"&gt;[http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=5914]&lt;/ref&gt; This citation was also used in the OED's 2011 revision.&lt;ref name="languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu"/&gt;

Within literary analysis, such terms are still used; but within the fields of cognition and linguistics, the basis for identifying such a distinction is no longer used.&lt;ref name="BarberStainton2009"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barber|first1=Alex|last2=Stainton|first2=Robert J|title=Concise Encyclopedia of Philosophy of Language and Linguistics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2boGE2NKtpsC&amp;pg=PA230|accessdate=23 December 2012|date=2009-11-20|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=9780080965000|pages=230–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{original research|section|date=August 2010}}
Figurative language can take multiple forms, such as [[simile]] or [[metaphor]].&lt;ref name="MontgomeryDurant2007"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Montgomery|first1=Martin|last2=Durant|first2=Alan|last3=Fabb|first3=Nigel |author4=Tom Furniss |author5=Sara Mills|title=Ways of Reading: Advanced Reading Skills for Students of English Literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BhrYfYdHuN8C&amp;pg=PA117|accessdate=3 April 2013|date=2007-01-09|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780203597118|pages=117–}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia Of Literature'' says that figurative language can be classified in five categories: resemblance or relationship, emphasis or [[understatement]], figures of sound, verbal games, and errors.&lt;ref name="inc1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=Merriam-Webster, inc.|title=Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia Of Literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eKNK1YwHcQ4C|accessdate=23 April 2013|year=1995|publisher=Merriam-Webster|isbn=9780877790426|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=eKNK1YwHcQ4C&amp;pg=PA415 415]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A [[simile]]&lt;ref&gt;Origin: 1350–1400; Middle English &lt; Latin: image, likeness, comparison, noun use of neuter of ''similis'' similar. {{cite web|url=http://www.oed.com.nuncio.cofc.edu/Entry/179881|work=simile, n.|publisher=Oxford English Dictionary|title=Simile}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a comparison of two things, indicated by some connective, usually "like", "as", "than", or a verb such as "resembles" to show how they are similar.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, X. J., and [[Dana Gioia]]. [[An Introduction To Poetry]]. 13th ed. Longman Pub Group, 2007. Pg 594.&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[metaphor]]&lt;ref&gt;Origin: 1525–35; &lt; Latin ''metaphora''  &lt; Greek ''metaphorá''  a transfer, akin to ''metaphérein'' to transfer. See meta-, -phore{{cite web|url=http://www.oed.com.nuncio.cofc.edu/Entry/117328|work=metaphor, n.|publisher=Oxford English Dictionary|title=Metaphor}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a figure of speech in which two "essentially unlike things" are shown to have a type of resemblance or create a new image.&lt;ref name="Miller2001"/&gt; The similarities between the objects being compared may be implied rather than directly stated.&lt;ref name="Miller2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Miller|first=Carol Rawlings|title=Irresistible Shakespeare: 6 Sensational Scenes from Favorite Plays and Dozens of Fun Ideas That Introduce Students to the Wonderful Works of Shakespeare|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qT3BC2CH1LoC&amp;pg=PA25|accessdate=23 December 2012|date=2001-03-01|publisher=Scholastic Inc.|isbn=9780439098441|pages=25–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Onomatopoeia]] is a word designed to be an imitation of a sound.&lt;ref&gt;Origin: 1570–80; &lt; Late Latin &lt; Greek ''onomatopoiía'' making of words = onomato-  (combining form of ónoma name) + poi-  (stem of poieîn to make; see poet) + -ia -ia{{cite web|url=http://www.oed.com.nuncio.cofc.edu/Entry/131486|work=onomatopoeia, n.|publisher=Oxford English Dictionary|title=Onomatopoeia}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: Example: “Bark! Bark!” went the dog as he chased the car that vroomed past.

==Standard pragmatic model of comprehension==
Prior to the 1980s, the "standard pragmatic" model of comprehension was widely believed. In that model, it was thought the recipient would first attempt to comprehend the meaning as if literal, but when an appropriate literal inference could not be made, the recipient would shift to look for a figurative interpretation that would allow comprehension.&lt;ref name="Katz1998"&gt;{{cite book|last=Katz|first=Albert N.|title=Figurative Language and Thought|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lSxhb_fZLx0C&amp;pg=PA166|accessdate=20 December 2012|year=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195109634|pages=166–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, research has cast doubt on the model. In tests, figurative language was found to be comprehended at the same speed as literal language; and so the premise that the recipient was first attempting to process a literal meaning and discarding it before attempting to process a figurative meaning appears to be false.&lt;ref name="EysenckKeane2005"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eysenck|first1=Michael William|last2=Keane|first2=Mark T.|title=Cognitive Psychology: A Student's Handbook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=22ZWi-LVLDcC&amp;pg=PA369|accessdate=20 December 2012|year=2005|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9781841693590|pages=369–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reddy and contemporary views==
Beginning with the work of [[Michael Reddy (linguist)|Michael Reddy]] in his 1979 work "[[Conduit metaphor|The Conduit Metaphor]]", many linguists now reject that there is a valid way to distinguish between a "literal" and "figurative" mode of language.&lt;ref name="Ortony1993"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ortony|first=Andrew|title=Metaphor and Thought|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QiJRvuXA_VcC&amp;pg=PA204|accessdate=20 December 2012|date=1993-11-26|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521405614|pages=204–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mam''' is a [[Mayan languages|Mayan language]] spoken by about half a million [[Mam people]] in the [[Departments of Guatemala|Guatemalan departments]] of [[Quetzaltenango Department|Quetzaltenango]], [[Huehuetenango Department|Huehuetenango]], [[San Marcos Department|San Marcos]], and [[Retalhuleu Department|Retalhuleu]], and the [[Mexico|Mexican]] state of [[Chiapas]]. Thousands more make up a Mam diaspora throughout the [[United States]] and [[Mexico]], with notable populations living in [[Oakland, California]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-mayan-indigenous-languages-20160725-snap-story.html|title=Ancient Mayan languages are creating problems for today's immigration courts|last=Carcamo|first=Cindy|website=latimes.com|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Washington, D.C.]]

==Classification==
{{see also|Mayan languages#Subdivisions}}
Mam is closely related to the [[Tektitek language]], and the two languages together form the Mamean sub-branch of the Mayan language family. Along with the Ixilan languages, [[Awakatek language|Awakatek]] and [[Ixil language|Ixil]], these make up the [[Mamean languages|Greater Mamean]] sub-branch, one of the two branches of the Eastern Mayan languages (the other being the Greater Quichean sub-branch, which consists of 10 Mayan languages, including [[K'iche' language|K'iche']]).

==Dialects==
Because contact between members of different Mam communities is somewhat limited, the language varies considerably even from village to village. Nevertheless, mutual intelligibility, though difficult, is possible through practice&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/748935484|title=A grammar of Mam, a Mayan language|last=England|first=Nora C.|date=1983|publisher=University of Texas Press|year=|isbn=0292729278|edition=|location=Austin|pages=|oclc=748935484}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Mam varieties within Guatemala are divided into four dialect groups&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gramática Pedagógica Mam|last=Pérez Vail|first=Eduardo Gustavo|publisher=Instituto de Lingüística y Educación, Universidad Rafael Landívar|year=2004|isbn=|location=Guatemala|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;:

*'''Northern Mam''' in southern [[Huehuetenango Department]]. Northern Mam is the least conservative group according to [[Terrence Kaufman]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.
*'''Southern Mam''' in [[Quetzaltenango Department]], [[San Marcos Department]], and [[Retalhuleu Department]].
*'''Central Mam''' in [[San Marcos Department]].
*'''Western Mam''' in northwestern [[San Marcos Department]]. The [[Tektitek language]] may be mutually intelligible with Western Mam dialects.

In addition to these, the dialects of [[Chiapas|Chiapas, Mexico]] may form a fifth dialect group, characterised by significant grammatical as well as lexical differences from the Guatemalan varieties&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gramática Didáctica Mam: Segundo Ciclo|last=Ramos Ortíz|first=Nicacio, Juan Rolando Morales de León, Juan Rodriguez Pérez|publisher=Instituto Nacional de Lenguas Indígenas|year=2013|isbn=|location=Mexico|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Distribution==
Mam is spoken in 64 communities in four [[Departments of Guatemala|Guatemalan departments]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = [[Academia de Lenguas Mayas de Guatemala]] | year = 2003 | title = Pujb'il Yol Mam: Vocabulario Mam}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 18 communities in [[Chiapas|Chiapas, Mexico]]&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. Neighboring languages include [[Jakaltek language|Jakaltek]] and [[Q’anjob’al language|Q'anjob'al]] to the north, [[Tektitek language|Tektitek]] to the west, and [[Ixil language|Ixil]], [[Awakatek]], [[Sipakapense language|Sipacapense]], and [[K'iche' language|K'iche']] to the east.

==Phonology==

===Vowels===
Mam has 10 [[vowel]]s, 5 short and 5 long:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.utexas.edu/utpress/books/enggra.html A Grammar of Mam, A Mayan Language, Nora C. England, University of Texas Press, page 33&lt;/ref&gt;

*The Mid-central vowel is an allophone of short a, e and u that can occur in the syllable following a stressed long vowel.

Like in many other Mayan languages, [[vowel length]] is contrastive, and short and long vowels have different phonemic values and are treated as separate vowels. The long versions of the back vowels, /o/, /u/, /ɑ/ vowels, transcribed as '''[oo]''', '''[uu]''', and '''[aa]''' are slightly compressed and pronounced as /o͍ː/, /u͍ː/, and /ɑ͍ː/  respectively, being partially rounded.

In the Todos Santos dialect the vowel structure is somewhat different. While /o/, /a/, and /u/ remain the same as in other varieties, short /e/ has become the diphthong /ɛi/, an audio example of this can be heard here:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite video
  | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2WZsDB2LHM
  | people = 
  | title = Speaking in MAM
  | medium = streaming video
  | publisher = YouTube
  | location = Todos Santos, Guatemala
  | date = 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Todos Santos dialect, the long vowels (distinguished by the doubling of the letter) have evolved into separate sounds altogether. Long /aː/ has become /ɒ/,  long /oː/ has become /øː/ and long /uː/ has become /yː/.

In some dialects vowels interrupted by stop have evolved into individual phonemes themselves, for example in Todos Santos dialect
/oʔ/ represented by o' has evolved into /ɵʏˀ/ and /oʔo/ represented by o'o has evolved into /ɵ'ʉ/.

===Consonants===
Mam has 27 [[consonant]]s, including the [[glottal stop]]:

/ɓ/ is realized as [βʼ] word-finally and when part of a consonant cluster in many dialects. In the Todos Santos dialect it is pronounced as [v] as part of a consonant cluster and as [βv̻] word finally.
: Examples: '''tzeb'''' [tsɛβʼ] ''goat'', '''kbon''' [kβʼɤŋ] ''small table''. In the Todos Santos dialect, '''tseb''''  is [tsɛiβv̻] and '''kbon''' is [kvoŋ] ''small table''.

/p/ is realized as [pʰ] word-finally and word initially, [p] elsewhere, [ɸ] in a consonant cluster and before short i, o, and u. It is pronounced as [ɸʰ] word finally in certain dialects. [f] is an interchangeable pronunciation of [ɸ].
: Examples: '''piich''' [pʰiːt͡ʃ] ''bird'', '''txkup''' [ʈ͡ʂkʰɯpʰ] or [ʈ͡ʂkʰɯɸʰ] ''animal'' , '''ptz'an''' [pʰt͡sʼaŋ] or [ɸʰt͡sʼaŋ] ''sugarcane''.

/ch/ has evolved from /tʃ/ to /sʃ/ in most Mexican dialects and some northern Guatemalan dialects. Sometimes the /t/ sound is still lightly pronounced before the stressed /sʃ/ sound.
: Example: '''choot''' [tʃʰoːtʰ] '''weeds''' has evolved into [sʃøːtʰ] or [&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;sʃoːtʰ]

/t/ is realized as [tʰ] word-finally and before another consonant, [t] elsewhere.
: Examples: '''ta'l''' [taʔl̥] ''juice, soup'', '''ch'it''' [t͡ʃʼɪtʰ] ''bird'', '''q'ootj''' [ʛoːtʰχ] ''dough''

/k/ is realized as [kʰ] word-finally and before another consonant, [k] elsewhere.
: Examples: '''paaki'l''' [pɑːkɪʔl̥] ''butterfly'', '''xtook''' [ʂtʰoːkʰ] ''staff'', '''kjo'n''' [kʰχɤʔŋ] ''cornfield''

/w/ can be pronounced [ʋ], [v], [v̥] or [β] word initially, [w], [ʍ] [ʋ] following a consonant, and [ʋ], [v], [v̻ʰ] or [fʰ] word finally. It is freely variable between [w] [v] [ʋ] [v̥] in all other positions with [ʋ] being the most common pronunciation. In the Todos Santos dialect, /w/ is realized as either [v] or [ʋ] word-initially or between vowels and before another consonant, as [ʍ] following a consonant and as [v̥] word finally.
: Examples: '''waaj''' [ʋɑːχ], [vɑːχ], [v̥ɑːχ], or [βɑːχ]''tortilla'', '''twon''' [twɤŋ], [tʍɤŋ], [tʋɤŋ] ''introversion'', '''lew''' [lɛʋ], [lɛv] [lɛv̥ʰ] [lɛfʰ] ''care''.

/q/ is realized as [qʰ] word-finally and before another consonant, [q] elsewhere.
: Examples: '''muuqin'''' [muːqɪŋ] ''tortilla'', '''aaq''' [ɑːqʰ] ''honeycomb'', '''qloolj''' [qʰɺoːlχ] ''obscurity''

/tʼ/ is realized interchangeably as [tʼ] and [ɗ] word-initially and -finally, after a vowel or before [l].
: Examples: '''t'rikpuul''' [tʼɾɪkʰɸuːl̥] ~ [ɗɾɪkʰpuːl̥] ''to jump'', '''ch'uut''' [t͡ʃʼuːtʼ] ~ [t͡ʃʼuːɗ] ''something sharp-pointed''
: Examples: '''t'ut'an''' [tʼɯtʼaŋ] ~ [ɗɯɗaŋ] ''wet'', '''wit'li''' [vɪtʼli] ~ [vɪɗli] ''seated squatting''

/n/ is realized as [ŋ] before [[velar consonant|velar-]] and [[uvular consonant]]s and word-finally,&lt;br /&gt;as [ɲ] before [j] and as [m] before /ɓ/ and /p/, [n] elsewhere.
: Examples: '''nim''' [nɪm] ''much'', '''juun''' [χuːŋ] ''one'', '''q'ankyoq''' [ʛaŋkʲɤqʰ] ''thunder''
: Examples: '''saajel''' [sɑːŋχel̥] ''sent'', '''nyuxh''' [ɲɯʃ] ''my godfather''
: Examples: '''qanb'ax''' [qamɓaʂ] ''foot'', '''npwaaqe''' [mpwɑːqɛ] ''my money''

/l/ is realized as  [l̥] word-finally, [ɺ] before short vowels and after plosives, bilabial, aveolar and retroflex consonants and [l] elsewhere. 
: Examples: '''luux''' [luːʂ] ''cricket'', '''lo'l''' [ɺoʔl̥] ''to eat fruits'', '''wlat''' [vɺatʰ] ''stiff''.

/ky/ is realized as [kɕʲ] in front of another consonant and kɕʰ word finally.  It is pronounced as kʲ in all other instances.
: Examples: '''kyja'tzan''' [kɕʲχaʲʔtsʰaŋ],  '''kyokleen''' [kʲɤkleːŋ]

/ ' / is realized as [ʲʔ] following /a/, /aa/, /e/, /ee/, /i/, /u/, /uu/ and /oo/. The standard pronunciation is simply [ʔ] after all vowels however in spoken speech [ʲʔ] is the common pronunciation. A similar trend can be seen in other Eastern Mayan languages. After /o/ it is pronounced as [ʉʔ] and after /ii/ it is pronounced simply as [ʔ]. Following consonants / ' / modifies each individual consonant differently as explained in the section above. In the Mam language every word must start with a consonant. In the current orthography initial / ' / is not written but if a word ever begins with a vowel, the word is treated as if it begin with a / ' /. The initial / ' / may be pronounced as either [ʔ] or [ʡ] in free variation.

==Grammar==
The most extensive Mam grammar is that of Nora C. England's ''A grammar of Mam, a Mayan language'' (1983), which is based on the [[San Ildefonso Ixtahuacán]] dialect of [[Huehuetenango Department]].

The basic word order of Mam is [[Verb–subject–object|VSO]] (Verb-Subject-Object, Verb-Ergative-Absolutive, or Verb-Agent-Patient). Most roots take the morphological shape CVC (England 1983:93). The only possible root final consonant cluster is -''nC''.

===Pronouns===
Mam has no independent pronouns (England 1983:155). Rather, pronouns in Mam always exist as [[bound morpheme]]s.

Below is a table of '''Set A''' (ergative) and '''Set B''' (absolutive) prefixes from England (1983:56). (''Note: The terms "Set A" and "Set B" are frequently used by Mayanists to describe the [[ergative–absolutive language|ergative]] systems typical of Mayan languages.'')

**n- /__C
**w- /__V
*Ø ~ tz- ~ tz'- ~ k-
**k- /potential
**tz'- /__V initial root, non-potential
**tz- /__''uul'' 'arrive here', ''iky''' 'pass by', non-potential
**Ø- /__C, non-potential
*-a ~ -ya
**-ya /V__ ; In the first person in post-vowel environments, -''ya'' varies freely with -''ky'a'' and -''y'''.
**-a /C__

When Set A prefixes can also be used with nouns. In this context, the Set A prefixes become '''[[possessive]]s'''.
*n- 'my'
*t- 'your (sg.)'
*t- 'his, her, its'
*q- 'our (exclusive)'
*q- 'our (inclusive)'
*ky- 'your (pl.)'
*ky- 'their'

Some paradigmatic examples from England (1983) are given below. Note that "Ø-" designates a [[null morpheme|null prefix]]. Additionally, ''ma'' is an aspectual word meaning 'recent past.'

===Nouns===
The Mam language displays [[inalienable possession]]. Certain Mam nouns cannot be possessed, such as ''kya7j'' 'sky' and ''che7w'' 'star' (England 1983:69). On the other hand, some Mam nouns are always possessed, such as ''t-lok' '' 'its root' and ''t-b'aq' '' 'its seed'.

Noun phrase structure can be summarized into the following template (England 1983:140).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15090">The grammar of the constructed [[Na'vi language]] was created for the movie ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'' by [[Paul Frommer]]. It is a [[tripartite language|tripartite]], primarily affixing [[agglutinative]] language.

== Morphophonology ==
{{wikibooks|Na'vi/Phonology}}

===Lenition===
[[Lenition]] is a phonological change that is the result of the application of certain prefixes:&lt;ref&gt;Frommer (Language Log), Phonetics and Phonology: 5. Phonetic detail and phonology: Lenition&lt;/ref&gt;
*px (/p‘/) → p
*tx (/t‘/) → t
*kx (/k‘/) → k
*p → f
*t or ts → s
*k → h
*' (/ʔ/) → ∅
Conventional notation uses + to denote a prefix that causes lenition.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, p.1&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other effects ===
Since Na'vi does not make the distinction between long and short vowels,&lt;ref&gt;Annis, § 2.1.4.3&lt;/ref&gt; if the application of an affix results in two of the same vowels in a row, it usually is shortened to one.&lt;ref&gt;Annis, § 2.3.1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;See exception with '''-ey-''' in the noun section&lt;/ref&gt; There is also some nasal assimilation of place.&lt;ref&gt;Annis, § 2.3.4&lt;/ref&gt; Specific affixes listed hereafter will list there variants. Many prefixes combine with each other to form slight variants

==Nouns==
{{wikibooks|Na'vi/Nouns}}

===Prefixes===

==== Plural ====
Na'vi has a singular, dual, trial and plural number. The dual prefix is '''me+''', the trial is '''pxe+''' and the general plural '''ay+'''. All of these prefixes cause lenition.&lt;ref&gt;Annis, § 3.1.3&lt;/ref&gt; If the '''ay+''' prefix causes a word to undergo lenition, the prefix may be dropped and the modified stem is also considered the general plural, and is known as the short plural&lt;ref&gt;Frommer (Language Log), Word Classes and Morphology: 1. Nouns: Number: Short plurals&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''tute''' ''person'' → '''aysute''' ''people'' → '''sute''' ''people''
The prefix '''fra-''' indicates means "every".&lt;ref&gt;Annis, § 3.3.4&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Deixis ====
The prefix '''fì-''' indicates proximal [[deixis]]. When used as a plural, it becomes '''fay+'''.&lt;ref&gt;Annis § 3.3.1&lt;/ref&gt;
'''payoang''' ''fish'' → '''fìpayoang''' ''this fish''
The prefix '''tsa-''' indicates distal dexis. When used as a plural, it becomes '''tsay+'''.&lt;ref&gt;Annis § 3.3.2&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Other ====
There is also the prefix '''fne-''' which means a type, sort or class of the noun it is attached to.

=== Suffixes ===
The suffix '''-o''' marks the noun as indefinite (i.e. "some").
*'''’eylan''' ''friend'' → '''’eylano''' ''some friend''
The suffix '''-tsyìp''' is used as a [[diminutive]]/endearment suffix.&lt;ref name="dim"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://naviteri.org/2010/07/diminutives-conversational-expressions/ |title= Diminutives; Conversational Expressions &amp;#x7C; Naviteri.org |last=Frommer |first=Paul |date=11 July 2010 |website=www.naviteri.org |accessdate=12 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''utral''' ''tree'' → '''utraltsyìp''' ''bush''
The suffix '''-fkeyk''' make the noun refers to the state of the noun to which it is attached.&lt;ref name="MillerH"&gt;Miller, Appendix. H&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Gender ====
Na'vi does not have grammatical gender, but it has two suffixes that indicate the gender of a noun: the feminine suffix '''-e''' and the masculine suffix '''-an'''.&lt;ref&gt;Annis, § 5.8.1.4&lt;/ref&gt; These are not mandatory.
*'''karyu''' ''teacher'' → '''karyuan''' ''male teacher''
*'''karyu''' ''teacher'' → '''karyue''' ''female teacher''

=== Cases ===
Na'vi is a tripartite language which means that the subject of an intransitive verb takes the [[intransitive case]]. The subject of a transitive verb takes the [[ergative case]], which is '''-l''' on nouns ending with vowels and '''-ìl''' on nouns ending with consontants. The object of a transitive verb takes the [[accusative]] case, which is ''-t'' on nouns that end with a vowel and ''-ìt''&lt;ref name="3.1.1"&gt;Annis § 3.1.1&lt;/ref&gt;

Example: '''oel ngati tse’a'''
{|
|'''oe&lt;u&gt;l&lt;/u&gt;''' || '''nga&lt;u&gt;ti&lt;/u&gt;''' || tse'a
|-
|''I.ERG'' || ''you.ACC'' || ''to see''
|}
:I see you
The [[dative]] case is '''-r''' or '''-ru''' on nouns ending with a vowel, and '''-ìr''' on nouns ending with a consonant.
The [[genitive]] case is '''-yä''', except on nouns ending with o or u, where it is '''-ä''', or nouns ending with '''-ia''' that become '''-iä'''.
The [[Topic-comment|topical]] case is '''-ri''' on nouns ending with a vowel, and '''-ìri''' on nouns ending with a vowel.&lt;ref name="3.1.1" /&gt;

=== Nominalizers ===
The suffix '''-yu''' turns a verb into an agent noun.
*'''slele''' ''to swim'' → '''sleleyu''' ''swimmer''
The prefix '''tì''', in combination with the infix '''-us-''', forms the gerund.&lt;ref name="dim" /&gt;
The suffix '''-tswo''' creates a noun indicating the ability to do the verb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://naviteri.org/2012/03/spring-vocabulary-part-2/ |title= Spring Vocabulary, Part 2 &amp;#x7C; Na’viteri.org |last=Frommer |first=Paul |date=31 March 2012 |website=www.naviteri.org |accessdate=12 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Verbs ==
{{wikibooks|Na'vi/Verbs}}
Na'vi verbs primarily use affixes to modify their meaning. They do not conjugate for person, but for tense. Each affix has a specific location.

===Positions===
When an infix is added to a Na'vi syllable, the infix goes after the initial consonant but before the vowel. There are three positions where an infix is added: the pre-first preposition, which goes immediately before the first position, the first position, which goes in the penultimate syllable, and the second position, which goes in the final syllable. If the verb is monosyllabic, all three positions go after each other. If the verb is a compound, the infixes only go in the head&lt;ref&gt;Annis, § 3.6.1.4.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pre-first position ===

==== Causative ====
The causative infix is '''-eyk-'''. When a causative verb is used, the ergative becomes the dative, and the accusative remains as it is.&lt;ref&gt;Annis § 6.1.1.2&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Reflexive ====
The reflexive infix is '''-äp-'''. When it is used with '''-eyk-''', it always comes first ('''-äpeyk-''')

=== 1st position ===

==== Tense infixes ====
There are four types of tense infixes, which mark for the past, near past, general, near future and future tenses, and that mark for the general, imperfective, and perfective aspects&lt;ref&gt;Annis § 3.6.3&lt;/ref&gt;
The first type are the regular ones
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! N/A !! Past !! Near past !! General !! Near future !! Future
|-
| '''General''' ||-am- || -ìm- || -∅- || -ìy- || -ay-
|-
| '''Perfective''' ||-alm- || -ìlm- || -ol- || -ìly- || -aly-
|-
| '''Imperfective ''' ||-arm- || -ìrm- || -er- || -ìry || -ary-
|}
There are two future intent infixes.&lt;ref&gt;Annis § 3.6.3.1&lt;/ref&gt;
{| class="wikitable"
! Near Future !! Future
|- 
| -ìsy- || -asy-
|}
There are also a few subjunctive infixes
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Past !! General !! Future !! Perfective !! Imperfective
|-
| -imv- || -iv- || -iyev- (or -ìyev) || -ilv- || -irv-
|}

==== Modal verbs ====
Na'vi has a few modal verbs, which when used, they must take the tense affixes and the modified verb must take the general subjunctive. The subject of the modal verb takes the intransitive case.&lt;ref&gt;Annis § 6.8.3.1-3&lt;/ref&gt;

Example:
'''’emyu new syuvet ayfol yivom'''
{|
|-
| '''’emyu''' || '''new''' || '''syuvet''' || '''ayfol''' || '''y&lt;u&gt;iv&lt;/u&gt;om''' 
|-
| ''chef''.INTR || ''want'' || ''food''.ERG || ''them''.ERG || ''eat''.SBJV
|}
: The chef wanted them to eat the food

===2nd position===
There are four infixes in this category, two indicating affect, two indicating speaker judgement. The infix '''-ei-''' indicate that the speaker is happy about the verb. The infix '''-äng-''' indicates that the speaker is unhappy about the verb.&lt;ref&gt;Annis § 3.6.4&lt;/ref&gt; The variant '''-eiy-''' of '''-ei-''' is used behind i,ì, ll, and rr&lt;ref&gt;Annis, § 2.3.3&lt;/ref&gt; and the variant '''-eng-''' of '''-äng-''' is used behind i&lt;ref&gt;Annis § 2.3.5.2&lt;/ref&gt;

The infix '''-ats-''' is used to indicate that the speaker is uncertain of the accuracy of his or her statement. There is also the [[honorifics (linguistics)|honorific]] infix '''-uy-'''.&lt;ref name="MillerH" /&gt;

Adjectives are created with the '''-a-''' affix. Adjectives can go before or after the noun that they modify. If the ajective is before the noun '''-a''' becomes a suffix, and if the adjective is after the noun, '''a-''' becomes a prefix.&lt;ref&gt;Annis §&lt;/ref&gt; 
Compare the two ways of saying ''the long river'' ('''kilvan''' ''river'', '''ngim''' ''long'')
:ngim'''a''' kilvan
and
:kilvan '''a'''ngim

=== Participles ===
Na'vi has an active participle infix '''-us-''', and the passive participle infix '''-awn-'''&lt;ref&gt;Annis, § 3.6.3.3&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ability adjectives ===
There are two prefixes that mark ability '''tsuk-''' indicates that the subject (ergative) is able to perform the verb. It is negated with '''ke-'''. These turn a verb into an adjective &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://naviteri.org/2011/03/%E2%80%9Creceptive-ability%E2%80%9D-and-hesitation/ |title= "Receptive Ability" and Hesitation &amp;#x7C; Naviteri.org |last=Frommer |first=Paul |date=22 March 2009 |website=www.naviteri.org |accessdate=11 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== From nouns ===
Nouns can be turned into adjective modifiers with the prefix '''le-'''. If this kind of adjective is used after the noun in question, the '''a-''' affix is usually dropped.&lt;ref&gt;Annis, § 3.5.1.1&lt;/ref&gt; When it is used is after the prefix '''ke-''' they become '''kel-'''. If the '''ke-''' goes before '''le-''', they become '''kel-'''.&lt;ref&gt;Annis, § 5.1.2.1-2&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Copula ===
The Na'vi copula is the verb '''lu'''. They can be linked to nouns or adjectives. Number is only required to be declared once in a phrase involving '''lu'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://naviteri.org/2011/07/number-in-na%E2%80%99vi/ |title= Number in Na'vi &amp;#x7C; Naviteri.org |last=Frommer |first=Paul |date=30 July 2011 |website=www.naviteri.org |accessdate=16 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Adjectives linked with '''lu''' are not required to have the '''-a-''' affix
The verb '''lu''' can also be used in the sense of '''having'''. In this case, the possessor takes the dative suffix.&lt;ref&gt;Annis, § 6.4.4.3&lt;/ref&gt;

Example: '''lu poru tstxo'''
{|
|'''lu''' || '''po&lt;u&gt;ru&lt;/u&gt;''' || '''tstxo'''
|-
|''to be'' || ''3SG.DAT'' || ''name''
|}
:s/he has a name

== Questions ==
{{wikibooks|Na'vi/Questions}}

=== Yes–no ===
[[Yes–no question]]s are formed with the word '''srak(e)''', which can go at the beginning or end of a clause (It has no e if it occurs at the end of a clause.

=== Pe question ===
The affix '''-pe+''' is used to form question words when attached to a noun, which means which. It can go before or after the noun, and it causes lenition if placed before the noun. If it is a prefix, and the noun is plural, they will combine and become '''pem+''' (dual), '''pep+''' (trial) or '''pay+''' (plural).
*

== Pronouns ==
{{wikibooks|Na'vi/Pronouns}}
Na'vi pronouns have the same declension as any other noun. The pronouns are declined for four persons: 1st person inclusive, 1st person exclusive, 2nd person, and 3rd person animate. Most of the plural forms of the various pronouns are made from the addition of the number prefixes to the singular. 
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! &lt;ref&gt;Annis, § 3.2.2&lt;/ref&gt; !! Singular !! Dual !! Trial !! plural
|-
| '''1st exclusive''' || oe || moe || pxoe || ayoe
|-
| '''1st inclusive''' || N/A || oeng || pxoeng || ayoeng
|-
| '''2nd person''' || nga || menga || pxenga || aynga
|-
| '''3rd animate''' || po || mefo || pxefo || ayfo/fo
|}
The singular inanimate 3rd person is '''tsa'u''', the demonstrative pronoun. The reflexive pronoun is '''sno''', and the indefinite personal pronoun is '''fko'''.&lt;ref&gt;Annis, § 3.2.2.7-9&lt;/ref&gt;

== Adpositions ==
{{wikibooks|Na'vi/Adpositions}}
Adpositions may go before or after the noun they modify. If it is before, then it is a separate word, but if after they are attach to the noun they modify.

== Relative clauses ==
{{wikibooks|Na'vi/Syntax}}
Relative clauses are formed with the particle '''a'''. If the [[Head (linguistics)|head]] noun is the ergative or accusative of the phrase it modifies, it is not present in the relative clause. If the head of the relative clause uses any other case or adposition, a [[resumptive pronoun]] is used.&lt;ref&gt;Annis, § 6.18.1-2&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conditionals ==
A conditional is use the words '''txo''' and '''tsakrr'''. The condidion goes after '''txo''', and takes the [[subjunctive]] case, then the consequent goes after the '''tsakrr''' (which is often omitted) and takes the relevant case.&lt;ref&gt;Annis, § 6.19.1-2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="counterfact"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://naviteri.org/2013/04/zun-zel-counterfactual-conditionals/ |title= Zun . . . Zel: Counterfactual Conditionalss &amp;#x7C; Naviteri.org |last=Frommer |first=Paul |date=30 April 2013 |website=www.naviteri.org |accessdate=16 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
A counter-factual conditional uses the words '''zun''' for the condition and '''zel''' for the consequent, and uses the subjunctive in both clauses&lt;ref name="counterfact" /&gt;&lt;!-- Add info about the use of the various subjunctives --&gt;

== Numbers ==
{{wikibooks|Na'vi/Numbers}}
Na'vi's native number system is an [[octal]] one. The numbers 0-7, 10&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; (8), and 100&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; (64) are&lt;ref name="MillerA"&gt;Miller, Appendix A&lt;/ref&gt;
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! 0 !! 1 !! 2 !! 3 !! 4 !! 5 !! 6 !! 7 !! 10&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; !! 100&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;
|-
| kew || 'aw || mune || pxey || tsìng || mrr || pukap || kinä || vol || zam
|}

The powers of eight are combined with special prefixes to create multiples of powers of eight. These are the first syllable of the corresponding number, except for 1, which has none, and 2, which has '''me-''' instead of '''mu-'''. To create a number that is a power of eight plus a number from 1 to 7, the ''l'' of '''vol''' is deleted (except for 1), and the initial consonant undergoes lenition.&lt;ref&gt;Annis, § 4.1.*&lt;/ref&gt;

Ordinals of the aforementioned numbers can be formed with the suffix '''-ve''', but there are a few irregularities&lt;ref&gt;Annis § 4.2.1&lt;/ref&gt;

Na'vi also has the numbers ''''eyt''' ''eight'' and '''nayn''' ''nine'' as loanwords from English.&lt;ref name="MillerA" /&gt;

'''Nahum Meïr Schaikewitz''',&lt;ref&gt;Also: ''Nachum Schaikewitsch, Nahum Mëir Schaikewitsch, Nachum Meir Schaikewitzsch, Nuchim Meir Scheikewicz, Nachum Meir Schaikewitch, Shaikevitch, Scheikowicz'' etc.&lt;/ref&gt; also known by his pseudonym "'''Shomer'''" (December 18, 1849 in [[Nesvizh]], [[Belarus]] &amp;ndash; 25 November 1905 in [[New York City]])&lt;ref name=PW&gt;''[[Publishers Weekly]]'', Vol. 68, No. 1766, 2 December 1905.  [https://books.google.com/books?id=7um7AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA1700 p. 1700, "Obituary Notes: Nahum Meyer Schaikewitz"].&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Yiddish]] [[novelist]] and [[playwright]]. Although he was very popular in his time and a giant in [[Yiddish literature]], sometimes styled the "[[Alexandre Dumas|Dumas]] of Yiddish literature",&lt;ref name=PW /&gt; he was significantly damaged by [[Sholem Aleichem]], who derided his plotting as extravagantly artificial and improbable, characteristic of a cheap potboiler.&lt;ref&gt;"Schaikewitz, Nahum Meyer", in [[Isaac Landman]] (ed.), ''[[The Universal Jewish Encyclopedia]]'', 1943; p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Qr9tAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Schaikewitz&amp;dq=Schaikewitz 338] ... [https://books.google.com/books?ei=k0cTTtDqCom7hAeH_Jz-DQ&amp;ct=result&amp;id=Qr9tAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Schaikewitz&amp;q=%22began+to+deride%22#search_anchor +]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life and works ==
Schaikewitz was born at Nesvizh, in the then [[Minsk Governorate|government]] of [[Minsk]], in the Russian Empire, on December 18, 1849. He distinguished himself as a clever story-teller even as a boy. His first literary efforts took the form of short stories in Hebrew for ''[[Ha-Meliẓ]]''; in this way he became acquainted with such writers of Hebrew as [[Ẓebi Hirsch Scherschewski]], [[Dobsevage]], and others. Later he became a business manager in [[Vilnius]], and spent some time in traveling. While in [[Bucharest]] he came under the influence of the [[Yiddish theatre|Jewish theater]] and resolved to become a dramatic author. He then settled in [[Odessa]], where he became theatrical manager and playwright at the Mariinski Theatre. His play ''Der Rewizor'' (Odessa, 1883), an adaptation from [[Gogol]]'s ''Revizor'' (''[[The Government Inspector]]''), proved very successful and showed Schaikewitz's talent as a writer. After the Jewish theater was closed in Russia, Schaikewitz went to New York in 1888, where he edited ''Der Menschenfreund'' and ''Der Jüdischer Puck'', two Yiddish-language weeklies.&lt;ref name=JE&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?letter=S&amp;artid=298 Schaikewitz, Nahum Meïr (Shomer)], ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]'', 1906&lt;/ref&gt;

Schaikewitz is the author of several Hebrew novels, all representing Jewish life in Russian towns. Among these are: ''Mumar le-Hak'is'' (Warsaw, 1879); ''Kewiyah Taḥat Kewiyah'' and ''Ṭa'ut Goi'' (Warsaw. 1880); and ''Ha-Niddaḥat'' (vols. 1 and 2, Vilnius, 1886; vol. 3, Warsaw, 1887). He also wrote ''Ḳayin'' (Warsaw, 1887), a novel on Jewish life in Portugal. But Schaikewitz became especially known as a writer in Yiddish, taking as a model, and finally excelling, [[Isaac Mayer Dick|Isaac Meir Dick]]. He wrote over two hundred novels in Yiddish, partly historical and partly reflecting Jewish life in the small towns and villages of Russia in the middle of the nineteenth century. As his language is simple, just as was spoken by the Jewish masses in Lithuania, his novels had the effect of greatly decreasing the fanaticism which prevailed in the small rural and urban communities. Among his more popular novels were ''Der Ḳaṭorzḥnikh'', ''Der Blutiger Adieu'', and ''Der Frumer Merder''. Many of his historical novels appeared in the Yiddish daily press.&lt;ref name=JE /&gt;

Over thirty of Schaikewitz's plays were produced, first in Russia, then in New York, among them being one entitled ''Tisza-Eslar'', on the subject of [[Tiszaeszlár Affair|the blood accusation]] brought in the Hungarian town of that name. Others included ''Der Bel Tchuve'' (The Penitent) and ''Trefnyak'' (The Impure One). He was the subject of vitriolic attacks by [[S. Rabinovitz]] ("Sholem Aleichem"), who directed against him his ''Shomer's Mishpaṭ'' (Berdychev, 1888), reproaching him for his literary deficiencies. Schaikewitz successfully defended himself in a pamphlet entitled ''Yehi Or'' (New York, 1898), showing that his literary problem was to satisfy every plane of intelligence, from the householder to the servant-girl who could not understand the works of the later Yiddish writers.&lt;ref name=JE /&gt;  [[Jacob Pavlovich Adler|Jacob Adler]] later wrote of his [[melodrama]]s that "Nothing so crude as this can be found in [[Abraham Goldfaden|Goldfaden]]... [but] the humor in Sheikevitch is more believable."&lt;ref&gt;[[Jacob Pavlovich Adler|Adler, Jacob]], ''A Life on the Stage: A Memoir'', translated and with commentary by Lulla Rosenfeld, Knopf, New York, 1999, {{ISBN|0-679-41351-0}}. 200, 271-272.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''predictive manufacturing system''' ('''PMS''') is a manufacturing paradigm wherein the system is programmed with certain amount and type of intelligence that allows assets to estimate their own condition, detect the presence of a fault or an anomaly, infer future fault events and even diagnose potential root cause of the problem. The goal of predictive manufacturing system (PMS) is to enable machine and systems with “self-aware” capabilities.&lt;ref name=No1&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lee|first=Jay|author2=Lapira ER |author3=Bagheri B |author4=Kao HA |title=Recent advances and trends in predictive manufacturing systems in big data environment|journal=Manufacturing Letters|year=2013|volume=1|issue=1|pages=38–41 |doi=10.1016/j.mfglet.2013.09.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The core technology of PMS in order to deliver “self-aware” capabilities is the smart computational agent that will contain advanced analytics to conduct predictive modeling functionalities.&lt;ref name=No2&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lee|first=Jay|author2=Lapira E |author3=Yang S |author4=Kao Ha |title=Predictive manufacturing system trends of next generation production systems|journal=the Proceedings of the 11th IFAC workshop on intelligent manufacturing systems|year=2013|volume=11|issue=1|pages=150–156 |doi=10.3182/20130522-3-br-4036.00107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

Transparency in an organization allows unraveling and even quantifying sources of uncertainty. It is an objective estimation of the company’s manufacturing capability and readiness.&lt;ref name=MyRefNo3&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lee|first=Jay|author2=Lapira E|title=Predictive factories: the next transformation|journal=Manufacturing leadership journal. Frost Sullivan.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most manufacturing strategies (such as mass production, lean manufacturing, flexible manufacturing, and reconfigurable manufacturing) haphazardly assume continuous equipment availability and constant maximum performance, which may never occur in a real factory. Manufacturing machines, like any other mechanical engineering assets, are prone to wear and tear that inhibit uninterrupted uptime. In order to achieve transparency within a facility, manufacturing industry is then asked to metamorphose into predictive manufacturing system so that data can be systematically processed into information that can explain the uncertainties and thereby enable users of the manufacturing assets to make more informed and evidence-based decisions.

The foundations of predictive manufacturing have already been laid out with the aggressive adoption of “Internet of Things” (IoT) principles wherein essential structures such as smart sensor networks and smart machines have become more prevalent.&lt;ref name="TheInternetof Things 4"&gt;{{cite web|vauthors=Chui M, Loffler M, Robert R |title=The internet of things|url=http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/high_tech_telecoms_internet/the_internet_of_things|publisher=McKinsey Quarterly No. 2.|accessdate=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Such scenario enables for seamless aggregation of data from assets (or asset fleet) on to a central location for appropriate processing. With the discovery and development of more advanced analytics, such data can then be transformed into information that can provide clarity or transparency, eventually addressing the uncertainties in the factory.

== Framework ==
An illustration of the conceptual framework of a predictive manufacturing system is shown in Figure 1.&lt;ref name=RefNo5&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lee|first=Jay|author2=Lapira E|title=Recent advances and trends in predictive manufacturing in Industry 4.0 environment|journal=Uptime Magazine|year=2014|pages=16–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The system starts out with a data acquisition system that can either be built-in by the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) or a third party provider. Using appropriate sensor assemblies, various signals such as vibration, pressure, temperature, etc. can be recorded. The types of signals and data acquisition parameters are determined by the application and the failure modes of the asset being monitored. Communication protocols, such as [[MTConnect]] and OLE-DB Process Control or OPC, can help users to acquire process or controller signals. Such data can provide context as to the type of action/function the machine was performing when sensor data was being collected. Imagine when all data are gathered and combined with all the assets in a facility. When all the data are aggregated, this phenomenon is called “Big Data” because of the volume of data collected, velocity by which data is being received and variety of data that are being collated. Such phenomenon requires new paradigms and approaches for analysis instead of statistical process control or other traditional statistical analysis techniques. The new transforming agent then consists of several components: an integrated platform, predictive analytics and visualization tools. The deployment platform is naturally selected based on several factors such as speed of computation, investment cost, ease of deployment for scaling purposes and update, etc. The actual processing or transformation of big data into useful information is performed by utilizing predictive analytics such as the tools found in the Watchdog Agent® toolbox that has been developed by researchers at the National Science Foundation (NSF) Industry/University Research Cooperative Center (I/UCRC) for Intelligent Maintenance Systems (IMS) since 2001.&lt;ref name=RefNo7&gt;{{cite journal|last=Djurdjanovic|first=Dragan|author2=Lee J |author3=Ni J |title=Watchdog Agent – an infotronics-based prognostics approach for product performance degradation assessment and prediction.|journal=Advanced Engineering Informatics|year=2003|volume=17|issue=3-4|pages=109–125|doi=10.1016/j.aei.2004.07.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=No8&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lee|first=Jay|author2=Djudjanovic D |author3=Qiu H |author4=Liao H |title=Intelligent prognostics tools and e-maintenance. Computers in Industry|journal=Computers in Industry|year=2006|volume=57|issue=6|pages=476–489 |doi=10.1016/j.compind.2006.02.014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also other predictive analytic providers such as IBM, Hadoop, SAS, SAP, etc. The algorithms found in the Watchdog Agent® can be categorized into four sections namely, signal processing and feature extraction, health assessment, performance prediction and fault diagnosis. By utilizing visualization tools, health information such as current condition, remaining useful life estimation, root cause, etc., can be effectively conveyed using radar charts, fault maps, risk charts and even health degradation curves. The calculated health information can then be forwarded or made available to existing company management systems such as enterprise resource planning system (ERP), manufacturing execution system (MES), supply chain management system (SCM), customer relation management system (CRM), product lifecycle management system (PLM) to achieve overall enterprise control and optimization. With manufacturing transparency, management then has the appropriate information (such as actual condition and state of machines, not just cycle times) to determine factory-wide overall equipment effectiveness (OEE). By knowing when assets will fail, equipment can then be managed more effectively with just-in-time maintenance. Finally, if historical health and failure modes can be compiled, such information can then be fed back to the equipment designer for closed loop lifecycle redesign

In [[philately]], '''private overprints '''or''' commercial overprints''' are [[overprint]]s applied to [[postage stamp]]s, [[postal stationery]] or [[revenue stamp]]s by anyone other than the official stamp-issuing entity. These overprints have principally been used as a security measure,&lt;ref name=sutton&gt;Sutton, R.J. &amp; K.W. Anthony. ''The Stamp Collector's Encyclopaedia''. 6th edition. London: Stanley Paul, 1966, p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt; however, propaganda and commemorative examples are also known. When overprinted for security purposes, they serve a similar function to [[perfins]]. It is important to distinguish between private overprints and [[private cancellation]]s.

==Background==
Private overprints have been used for a number of reasons. Generally they cannot be used as control marks, as the stamp or stamps are thus rendered invalid for prepayment of postage (though some such invalid stamps have successfully passed through the mails, presumably due to an oversight of postal employees).  However, while in Great Britain privately overprinted stamps usually served as receipts for tax payments, in 1859, upon application of the Oxford Union Society, there was a unique instance of a private overprint being approved for application on the face of stamps.&lt;ref name="op2"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120716232948/http://www.useless.connectfree.co.uk/com_op/oprint2/oprint2.htm Private Postal Overprints] 20 September 2001. Retrieved 11 July 2013 from Internet Archive.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stamp.demon.co.uk/Philately/ProtectiveOverprintsAndUnderprints/UserPages/OUS/OUS.htm O.U.S.] Andy Donaldson, 2013. [http://www.stamp.demon.co.uk/Philately/ProtectiveOverprintsAndUnderprints/UserPages/OUS/OUS.htm Archived here.]&lt;/ref&gt; This is to be distinguished from the more or less frequent application of private overprints to the back of stamps as control marks.&lt;ref name="op2"/&gt;

[[File:Harrods Limited commercial overprint on British 2d dark colours definitive stamp of 1938.jpg|thumbnail|right|A commercial overprint of [[Harrods|Harrods Limited]] on a British 2d stamp of 1938.]]
In Great Britain, commercial overprints were principally used to pay the tax on receipts&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cosgb.org/ Commercial Overprint Society of Great Britain] 2013. Retrieved 12 July 2013. [https://www.webcitation.org/6I2lQ5vV6 Archived here.]&lt;/ref&gt; and are found on both revenue and postage stamps with a great number of different varieties known between the 1880s and 1970s.

Other countries which had commercial overprints include Canada, Ceylon, India, Kenya &amp; Uganda, New South Wales, New Zealand, South Africa, Spain, the Straits Settlements and Victoria.

Private overprints can also originate from speculative philatelic purposes produced deliberately with a view to selling them to unsuspecting collectors.

==Political causes==
Private overprints have been used to express political opinions, or to commemorate events by creating collectors' items in cases in which the overprinted stamps cannot be used.  For instance, German sympathisers in the [[Sudetenland]] privately overprinted Czechoslovakian stamps with [[swastika]]s before the annexation, and in Italy, after the fall of [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]] and his establishment of the Italian Social Republic, stamps of the King were overprinted with fasces by [[Fascism|Fascist]] sympathizers.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

==In the United States==
Private overprints have also been used in the United States, though the Domestic Mail Manual states that stamps "overprinted with an unauthorized design, message or other marking" are not valid for postage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pe.usps.com/cpim/ftp/manuals/dmm300/604.pdf Domestic Mail Manual] [[U.S. Postal Service]], 2013, Section 604.1.3&lt;/ref&gt;  A private overprint exists on the Florida [[Commemorative stamp|commemorative]], and during the Vietnam War, a woman privately overprinted the stamps on her outgoing mail with the slogan "Pray for War" before postal authorities compelled her to move this stamping away from the stamps.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} There have been several American examples of [[postal card]]s being overprinted with a private overprint revaluation shortly after a rate change, including the [[Post Office Department]]'s authorization of a special [[Pitney-Bowes]] Tickometer [[Overprint|surcharge]] to be used to revalue postal cards in the possession of [[General Electric]] when the postcard rate went up to 3 cents in August 1958. The USPS also authorised overprinting of the 10¢ Tractor Trailer and 5¢ Canoe Transportation coil stamps.

'''Proclamation No. 55''' was signed by [[President of the Philippines|Philippine President]] [[Rodrigo Duterte]] on September 4, 2016, to officially declare a [[state of emergency]] in the Philippines in response to the [[2016 Davao City bombing]].&lt;ref name="gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/2016/09/04/proclamation-no-55-s-2016/ |title=Proclamation No. 55, s. 2016 |publisher=[[Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines]] |accessdate=6 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Following the September 2 bombing in [[Davao City]] that killed 14 people and seriously wounded at least 60 others, President Duterte placed the entire country under a national state of emergency.&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://time.com/4479616/rodrigo-duterte-philippines-obama-davao-blast/ |title=Rodrigo Duterte declares a state of emergency in the Philippines |publisher=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |author=Solomon, F. |date=6 September 2016 |accessdate=6 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rappler"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/145290-philippines-duterte-signs-state-national-emergency-lawless-violence-proclamation |title=Duterte signs state of nat'l emergency proclamation |publisher=[[Rappler]] |author=Ranada, P. |date=5 September 2016 |accessdate=6 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By virtue of the proclamation declaring a "State of National Emergency on Account of Lawless Violence in Mindanao", the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines]] (AFP) and the [[Philippine National Police]] (PNP) were ordered to suppress all forms of lawless violence in [[Mindanao]] and to undertake measures to prevent violence from spreading to other parts of the Philippines.&lt;ref name="philstar"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2016/09/06/1621023/palace-issues-proclamation-state-national-emergency |title=Palace issues proclamation of state of national emergency |publisher=[[The Philippine Star]] |author=Viray, P.L. |date=6 September 2016 |accessdate=6 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rappler"/&gt; The proclamation also came on the heels of the Philippine military offensive against the terrorist group [[Abu Sayyaf]] in [[Patikul, Sulu]] which left 15 soldiers dead on August 29, 2016. It also acknowledged the threats of further terror attacks by lawless elements in other parts of the country, including the metropolitan areas, following these developments in Mindanao.&lt;ref name="philstar"/&gt;

President Duterte issued the proclamation in [[Manila]] just before leaving for [[Laos]] to attend the [[ASEAN Summit|2016 ASEAN Summit]]. Earlier, he verbally declared a "state of [[lawlessness]]" in the country on September 3, 2016.&lt;ref name="rappler2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/145043-duterte-declares-state-of-lawlessness-ph |title=Duterte declares state of lawlessness in PH |publisher=[[Rappler]] |author1=Ranada, P. |author2=Elemia, C. |author3=Cupin, B. |date=3 September 2016 |accessdate=6 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a press conference in Davao the day following the attacks, Duterte said the declaration was to "ensure coordinated efforts" between the police and the military in the [[Philippine Drug War|government's fight against illegal drugs]], criminals and terrorism. He also said it was not a declaration of [[martial law]] and that the writ of ''[[habeas corpus]]'' will not be suspended.&lt;ref name="rappler2"/&gt;

The presidential proclamation orders the Philippine law enforcement officials to carry out suppression of violence "as may be permitted in the Constitution and existing laws," as well as "with due regard to the fundamental civil and political rights of our citizens."&lt;ref name="gov"/&gt; It also states that the "state of national emergency on account of lawless violence shall remain in force and effect until lifted or withdrawn by the President."&lt;ref name="gov"/&gt;

==Directives==
Under Memorandum Order No. 3 released on September 7, 2016, the [[Department of National Defense (Philippines)|Department of National Defense]] and the [[Department of the Interior and Local Government (Philippines)|Department of the Interior and Local Government]] are ordered to deploy additional forces of the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines|AFP]] and [[Philippine National Police|PNP]] in public areas throughout the country without causing undue alarm to the general public, and to intensify their local and transnational intelligence operations against individuals or groups suspected of, or responsible for, committing or conspiring to commit acts of lawless violence. It also orders the [[Department of Justice (Philippines)|Department of Justice]] to coordinate with law enforcement agencies for the prompt investigation and prosecution of all suspected individuals or groups.&lt;ref name="memo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/2016/09/07/memorandum-order-no-3-s-2016/ |title=Memorandum Order No. 3, s. 2016 |publisher=[[Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines]] |accessdate=18 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The memorandum guarantees the civil and political rights of individuals in the duration of the state of emergency and sets out the rules governing arrests for AFP and PNP personnel. It states: 

{{quotation|No warrantless arrests shall be effected unless the situation falls under any of the following circumstances, among others:

(i) when the person to be arrested has committed, is actually committing, or is attempting to commit an offense in the presence of the arresting officer;

(ii) when an offense has just been committed and the arresting officer has personal knowledge of facts indicating that the person to be arrested has committed the offense;

(iii) when the person to be arrested is a prisoner who escaped from a penal establishment or place where he is serving final judgment or temporarily confined with his case is pending;

(iv) when the person arrested, or to be arrested, has voluntarily waived his rights against warrantless arrests.|M.O. 3 sec. 5}}

The memorandum also lists the existing rules and procedures in carrying out warrantless searches and seizures, such as when the individual consents to the search or waives his right against warrantless search; when the search is made contemporaneous to a lawful arrest; the search of vessels and aircraft for violation of immigration and customs laws; the search of automobiles at borders for violation of immigration or smuggling laws; the seizure of objects made in plain view; stop-and-frisk situations; and searches arising from emergency circumstances.&lt;ref name="memo"/&gt;

Military and police checkpoint inspections shall be limited to requesting to roll down vehicle windows to search for objects in plain view only, and the production of identification and vehicle registration papers.&lt;ref name="memo"/&gt; The memorandum also states:

{{quotation|Any AFP/PNP personnel found violating any of the foregoing constitutional rights shall be held administratively and civilly/criminally liable therefor.|M.O. 3 sec. 6}}

The '''Puroik language''', also called '''Sulung''', is a language spoken by the [[Puroik people]] of [[Arunachal Pradesh]] in India and of [[Lhünzê County]], Tibet, in China. It is of uncertain affiliation.

==Geographical distribution==
Remsangpuia (2008:17) lists the following Puroik villages. The Puroik also live in Nyishi, Aka, and Miji areas.

*[[East Kameng District]]: [[Chayangtajo]], Pipu, [[Pakke-Kessang | Pakke Kessang]], Lada, Bameng, Seijosa, Seppa, Sawa, Khenewa, and Pipu-Dipu circles (about 70 villages)
*[[Kurung Kumey District]]: Koloriang, Sarli, Hurli, Nyopin, and Tali circles
*[[Papum Pare District]]
*[[West Kameng District]]

According to the ''Ethnologue'', Puroik is spoken in 53 villages along the Par River in [[Arunachal Pradesh]].

The Puroik are located from the Upper Subansiri River drainage basin (西巴霞区) to the Tawang River drainage basin (Li 2005).&lt;ref&gt;Li Daqin [李大勤]. 2005. "A sketch of Sulung" [苏龙语概况]. ''Minzu Yuwen'' 2005:1.&lt;/ref&gt; Names include ''pɯh31 ɣut55'' (autonym) and ''su55 loŋ33'' ([[Bangni language|Bangni]] exonym). There are about 3,000 people as of 2002.

==Dialects==
Lieberherr (2015)&lt;ref name="Lieberherr2015"/&gt; consider Puroik to be a [[dialect chain]] where geographically distant dialects are mutually unintelligible, whereas dialects located close to each other are mutually intelligible. The internal diversity of Puroik is about equal to that of the Western [[Kho-Bwa]] branch.&lt;ref name="Lieberherr-Bodt"/&gt; Lieberherr (2015) and Lieberherr &amp; Bodt (2017)&lt;ref name="Lieberherr-Bodt"&gt;Lieberherr, Ismael; Bodt, Timotheus Adrianus. 2017. [https://escholarship.org/uc/item/4t27h5fg Sub-grouping Kho-Bwa based on shared core vocabulary]. In ''Himalayan Linguistics'', 16(2).&lt;/ref&gt; list the following dialects of Puroik, provided here in geographical order from east to west.
*'''Kurung-Kumey''' dialect: spoken in [[Kurung Kumey district]], which is located to the east of [[Chayangtajo]]. May be most similar to the Puroik dialect described in Li Daqin (2004) and other Chinese sources.
*'''Chayangtajo''' dialect: spoken in Sanchu and neighboring villages of [[Chayangtajo]] circle, [[East Kameng district]], [[Arunachal Pradesh]], India by a few hundred speakers.
*'''Lasumpatte''' dialect: spoken in Lasumpatte village in Seijosa near the [[Assam]] border. Most inhabitants have recently migrated from the Chayangtajo area.
*'''Sario-Saria''' dialect: spoken in three villages by a few hundred speakers.
*'''Rawa''' dialect: spoken in several villages in and around Rawa by a few hundred speakers (located between [[Chayangtajo]] and Kojo-Rojo). Also includes ''Poube'' village.''
*'''Kojo-Rojo''' dialect: spoken in the villages of Kojo and Rojo, and possibly also in Jarkam village (mutually intelligible with the Puroik dialect spoken in other villages in Lada circle).
*'''Bulu''' dialect: spoken only in Bulu village by 7-20 speakers.

==Classification==
Lieberherr &amp; Bodt (2017)&lt;ref name="Lieberherr-Bodt"&gt;Lieberherr, Ismael; Bodt, Timotheus Adrianus. 2017. [https://escholarship.org/uc/item/4t27h5fg Sub-grouping Kho-Bwa based on shared core vocabulary]. In ''Himalayan Linguistics'', 16(2).&lt;/ref&gt; classify Puroik as [[Kho-Bwa languages|Kho-Bwa]], and has traditionally been considered to be a Sino-Tibetan language. There is some mutual intelligibility with [[Bugun language|Bugun]], and Burling (2003) grouped it with Bugun and [[Sherdukpen language|Sherdukpen]], and possibly with [[Lish language|Lish]] and [[Sartang language|Sartang]].

[[James A. Matisoff]] (2009)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Matisoff |first1=James A. |year=2009 |title=Stable Roots in Sino-Tibetan/Tibeto-Burman |journal=Senri Ethnological Studies |volume=75 |issue=291–318 |url=http://depts.washington.edu/icstll39/abstracts/icstll39_matisoff.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; considers Puroik to be a Tibeto-Burman language. Lieberherr (2015)&lt;ref name="Lieberherr2015"/&gt; also considers Puroik to be a Tibeto-Burman language, although he notes that it has likely borrowed from non-Tibetan-Burman languages. However, [[Roger Blench]] (2011) considers Puroik to be a [[language isolate]].&lt;ref&gt;Blench, Roger. 2011. [http://www.rogerblench.info/Language/South%20Asia/NEI/General/Lingres/Declassifying%20Arunachal.pdf ''(De)classifying Arunachal languages: Reconsidering the evidence''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130526230734/http://www.rogerblench.info/Language/South%20Asia/NEI/General/Lingres/Declassifying%20Arunachal.pdf |date=2013-05-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides their own language, the Puroik also use [[Nishi language|Nishi]], [[Hindi]], and [[Assamese language|Assamese]]. Literacy is very low, at about 2%. Those who are literate use either the [[Bengali script]], [[Devanagari]] or the [[Latin alphabet]] to write Puroik.

==Grammar==
The Sulung grammar notes here have been adapted primarily from Tayeng (1990).&lt;ref&gt;Tayeng, Aduk. 1990. Sulung language guide. Shillong: The Director of Information and Public Relations, Arunachal Pradesh&lt;/ref&gt;

===Number===
Number is not considered a grammatical feature in Sulung. Plurality is expressed, when required to be stated clearly by the [[huangda]] meaning all, many, etc.

===Gender===
There is no grammatical gender in [[Sulung]]. However the two sexes are distinguished when necessary.
To indicate other relatives and persons the suffix -aphu is added for the male and -amua for the female. Demonstrative, and Interrogative.

===Case===
Seven cases may be distinguished: Subject (Nominative), Object (Accusative), Instrumental, Dative (Purposive), Ablative, Possessive (Genitive), and Locative.

===Pronoun===
The Personal Pronoun distinguished three persons (the first person, second person, and third person) and two numbers (singular and plural). The same form is used for both genders.

===Adjective===
There are four types of adjectives: adjective of quality, adjective of quantity, demonstrative adjective, interrogative adjective.

===Verb===
Sulung verbs do not indicate number and person.

===Tense===
The three principal tenses (present, past, and future), including the indefinite and the continuous are indicated by means of particles used as suffixes.

===Moods===
There are four moods: Imperative, potential, conditional, and subjunctive. 
Imperative uses the suffix -bo, -da, and -ge for commands.
Potential uses the suffix -pa to express the ability to perform.
Conditional uses -re/-hangra to express obligation.

===Adverb===
Adverbs may be distinguished into four classes: Time, place, manner, and interrogative.

==Vocabulary==
The following list of 181 words in three Puroik dialects, in addition to Proto-Puroik (the reconstructed [[proto-language]] of the Puroik lects), is from Lieberherr (2015: 280-286). Lieberherr (2015)&lt;ref name="Lieberherr2015"&gt;Lieberherr, Ismael. 2015. A progress report on the historical phonology and affiliation of Puroik. [http://hdl.handle.net/1885/140248 North East Indian Linguistics (NEIL), 7]. Canberra, Australian National University: Asia-Pacific Linguistics Open Access.&lt;/ref&gt; reconstructs Proto-Puroik, drawing data from the ''Chayangtajo'' dialect and the newly described ''Kojo-Rojo'' and ''Bulu'' dialects. Forms from the ''Rawa'' and ''Saria'' dialects have also been included.&lt;ref name="Lieberherr2015"/&gt;

'''Samoan''' (''Gagana faʻa Sāmoa'' or ''Gagana Sāmoa'' – [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA:]] {{IPA-sm|ŋaˈŋana ˈsaːmʊa|}}) is the language of the [[Samoan Islands]], comprising [[Samoa]] and the [[United States territory]] of [[American Samoa]]. It is an official language – alongside [[English language|English]] – in both jurisdictions.

Samoan, a [[Polynesian languages|Polynesian language]], is the first language for most of the Samoa Islands' population of about 246,000 people. With many [[Samoans|Samoan people]] living in other countries, the total number of speakers worldwide is estimated at 510,000 in 2015. It is the third most widely spoken language in [[New Zealand]], where more than 2% of the population – 86,000 people – were able to speak it as of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.stats.govt.nz/~/media/Statistics/Census/2013%20Census/data-tables/totals-by-topic/totals-by-topic-tables.xls |title= 2013 Census totals by topic |publisher= [[Statistics New Zealand]] |accessdate= 11 December 2013 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131213100306/http://www.stats.govt.nz/~/media/Statistics/Census/2013%20Census/data-tables/totals-by-topic/totals-by-topic-tables.xls |archivedate= 13 December 2013 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The language is notable for the [[phonology|phonological]] differences between formal and informal speech as well as a ceremonial form used in Samoan oratory.

==Classification==
Samoan is an [[analytic language|analytic]], [[isolating language]] and a member of the [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]] family, and more specifically the [[Samoic languages|Samoic]] branch of the [[Polynesian languages|Polynesian]] subphylum. It is closely related to other [[Polynesian languages]] with many shared [[cognate]] words such as ''[[aliʻi]]'', ''[[Samoa 'ava ceremony|ʻava]]'', ''[[atua]]'', ''[[tapu (Polynesian culture)|tapu]]'' and numerals as well as in the name of gods in [[Polynesian mythology|mythology]].

Linguists differ somewhat on the way they classify Samoan in relation to the other [[Polynesian languages#History of classification|Polynesian languages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lmp.ucla.edu/Profile.aspx?menu=004&amp;LangID=96|work=University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)|title=Language Materials Project, Samoan|accessdate=17 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "traditional" classification,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_family.asp?subid=812-16 |title=Ethnologue Report for Polynesian |publisher=Ethnologue.com |accessdate=2011-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on shared innovations in grammar and vocabulary, places Samoan with [[Tokelauan language|Tokelauan]], the Polynesian outlier languages and the languages of [[Eastern Polynesian languages|Eastern Polynesia]], which include [[Rapa Nui language|Rapanui]], [[Māori language|Māori]], [[Tahitian language|Tahitian]] and [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]]. Nuclear Polynesian and Tongic (the languages of Tonga and Niue) are the major subdivisions of Polynesian under this analysis. A revision by Marck reinterpreted the relationships among Samoan and the outlier languages. In 2008 an analysis, of basic vocabulary only, from the Austronesian Basic Vocabulary Database is contradictory in that while in part it suggests that Tongan and Samoan form a subgroup,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://language.psy.auckland.ac.nz/austronesian/img/FullTreeFigure.pdf |title=Austronesian Basic Vocabulary Database figure template |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; the old subgroups Tongic and Nuclear Polynesian are still included in the classification search of the database itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://language.psy.auckland.ac.nz/austronesian/classification.php?node=Austronesian,%20Malayo-Polynesian,%20Central-Eastern,%20Eastern%20Malayo-Polynesian,%20Oceanic,%20Central-Eastern%20Oceanic,%20Remote%20Oceanic,%20Central%20Pacific,%20East%20Fijian-Polynesian,%20Polynesian |title=Classification search of the Austronesian Basic Vocabulary Database |publisher=Language.psy.auckland.ac.nz |accessdate=2011-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geographic distribution==
There are approximately 470,000 Samoan speakers worldwide, 50 per cent of whom live in the Samoan Islands.&lt;ref name=Ethnologue&gt;Lewis, M. Paul (ed.), 2009. "[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=smo Samoan]". Ethnologue: Languages of the World, Sixteenth edition. Dallas, Tex.: SIL International.&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, the greatest concentration is in [[New Zealand]], where people of Samoan ethnicity comprise the largest group after New Zealand European, [[Māori people|Māori]], and [[Chinese New Zealander|Chinese]]: the 2006 New Zealand census recorded 95,428 speakers of the Samoan language, and 141,103 people of Samoan ethnicity. Among ethnic Samoans in New Zealand, 70.5 percent (87,109 people) could speak Samoan. Samoan is the third most commonly spoken language in New Zealand after English and Māori.

[[File:Samoa islands 2002.gif|thumb|Samoa and American Samoan islands where Samoan is the official language.]]
The majority of Samoans in New Zealand (66.4 per cent) reside in the commercial capital, [[Auckland]]. Of those who speak Samoan, 67.4 percent live in Auckland, and 70.4 percent of people who are both of Samoan ethnicity and Samoan speakers live in that city.

According to the Australian census of 2006, there were 38,525 speakers of Samoan in [[Australia]], and 39,992 people of Samoan ancestry.

US Census 2010 shows more than 180,000 Samoans reside in the United States, which is triple the number of people living in American Samoa, while slightly less than the estimated population of the island nation of Samoa – 193,000, as of July 2011.

Samoan Language Week (''Vaiaso o le Gagana Sāmoa'') is an annual celebration of the language in New Zealand supported by the government&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.nz/en-NZ/PB/Debates/Debates/8/2/d/49HansD_20100601_00000023-Motions-Samoan-Language-Week-Recognition.htm|work=New Zealand Parliament|title=Motions; Samoan Language Week – Recognition|accessdate=10 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and various organisations including [[UNESCO]]. Samoan Language Week was started in Australia for the first time in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrc.co.nz/home/hrc/newsandissues/samoanlanguageweekonitsway.php|work=Human Rights Commission of New Zealand|title=Samoan Language Week on its way|accessdate=10 July 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101116181535/http://www.hrc.co.nz/home/hrc/newsandissues/samoanlanguageweekonitsway.php|archivedate=16 November 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phonology==
The Samoa alphabet consists of 14 letters, with another three letters ('''''H''''', '''''K''''', '''''R''''') used in loan words. The '''{{okina}}''' (''koma liliu'' or ''[[ʻokina]]'') is used for the [[glottal stop]].

|}

===Vowels===
Vowel length is phonemic in Samoan; all 5 vowels also have a long form denoted by the [[Macron (diacritic)|macron]].&lt;ref name=hunkin/&gt; For example, ''tama'' means child or boy, while ''tamā'' means father.

====Monophthongs==== 
{|class="wikitable"

| colspan=2 | {{IPA|a}}
| colspan=2 | {{IPA|aː}}
|}

Diphthongs are {{IPA|/au ao ai ae ei ou ue/}}.

The combination of '''u''' followed by a vowel in some words creates the sound of the English '''w''', a letter not part of the Samoan alphabet, as in ''uaua'' (artery, tendon).

{{IPA|/a/}} is reduced to {{IPA|[ə]}} in only a few words, such as ''mate'' or ''maliu'' 'dead', ''vave'' 'be quick'.

===Consonants===
In formal Samoan, used for example in news broadcasts or sermons, the consonants {{IPA|/t n ŋ/}} are used. In colloquial Samoan, however, {{IPA|/n ŋ/}} merge as {{IPA|[ŋ]}} and {{IPA|/t/}} is pronounced {{IPA|[k]}}.&lt;ref&gt;A somewhat similar situation is found in [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]], where {{IPA|/k/}} is the reflex of {{IPA|*t}} and {{IPA|*ŋ}} has merged with {{IPA|*n}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[glottal stop]] {{IPA|/ʔ/}} is phonemic in Samoan. The presence or absence of the glottal stop affects the meaning of words otherwise spelled the same,&lt;ref name=hunkin/&gt; e.g. ''mai'' = from, originate from; ''maʻi'' = sickness, illness.&lt;ref&gt;The glottal stop is often represented by an [[apostrophe]] in recent publications, and is referred to as the ''koma liliu'' (inverted comma).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{IPA|/l/}} is pronounced as a [[flap consonant|flap]] {{IPA|[ɾ]}} following a back vowel ({{IPA|/a, o, u/}}) and preceding an {{IPA|/i/}}; otherwise it is {{IPA|[l]}}. {{IPA|/s/}} is less [[sibilant]] (hissing) than in English.
{{IPA|/ɾ h/}} are found in loan words.

The consonants in parentheses are only present in loanwords and formal Samoan.&lt;ref&gt;http://linguistics.emory.edu/home/resources/polyglot/phonology.html#samoan&lt;/ref&gt;
====Foreign words====
Loanwords from English and other languages have been adapted to Samoan phonology:&lt;ref name=pratt/&gt;

/k/ is retained in some instances (Christ = "Keriso", club = "kalapu", coffee = "kofe"), and has become [t] in rare instances (such as "se totini", from the [[English language|English]] "stocking").

/ɹ/ becomes [ɾ] in some instances (e.g. Christ = "Keriso", January = "Ianuari", number = "numera"), and [l] in others (January = "Ianuali", herring = "elegi").

/d/ becomes [t] (David = "Tavita", diamond = "taimane").

/g/ becomes [k] in some cases (gas = "kesi"), while /dʒ/ and /tʃ/ usually become [s] (George = "Siaosi", Charlotte = "Salata", James = "Semisi").

/h/ is retained at the beginning of some proper names (Herod = "Herota"), but in some cases becomes an 's' (hammer = "samala"), and is omitted in others (herring = "elegi", half-caste = "afakasi")

/z/ becomes [s] (Zachariah = "Sakaria")

/w/ becomes [v] (William = "Viliamu")

/b/ becomes [p] (Britain = "Peretania", butter = "pata")

===Stress===
Stress generally falls on the penultimate [[mora (linguistics)|mora]]; that is, on the last syllable if that contains a long vowel or diphthong or on the second-last syllable otherwise. There are exceptions though, with many words ending in a long vowel taking the accent on the ultima; as ''ma'elega'', zealous; ''ʻonā'', to be intoxicated; ''faigatā'', difficult.

Verbs formed from nouns ending in a, and meaning to abound in, have properly two aʻs, as ''puaa'' (puaʻaa), ''pona'', ''tagata'', but are written with one.

In speaking of a place at some distance, the accent is placed on the last syllable; as ''ʻO loʻo i [[Safotu]]'', he is at Safotu. The same thing is done in referring to a family; as Sa Muliaga, the family of Muliaga, the term ''Sa'' referring to a wide extended family of clan with a common ancestor. So most words ending in ''ga'', not a sign of a noun, as ''tigā'', ''puapuaga'', ''pologa'', ''faʻataga'' and ''aga''. So also all words ending in a [[diphthong]], as ''mamau'', ''mafai'', ''avai''.&lt;ref name=pratt/&gt;

In speaking the voice is raised, and the emphasis falls on the last word in each sentence.

When a word receives an addition by means of an affixed particle, the accent is shifted forward; as ''alofa'', love; ''alofága'', loving, or showing love; ''alofagía'', beloved.

Reduplicated words have two accents; as ''palapala'', mud; ''segisegi'', twilight. Compound words may have even three or four, according to the number of words and affixes of which the compound word is composed; as ''tofátumoánaíná'', to be engulfed.

The articles ''le'' and ''se'' are unaccented. When used to form a pronoun or participle, ''le'' and ''se'' are contractions for ''le e'', ''se e'', and so are accented; as ''ʻO le ona le mea'', the owner, literally the (person) whose (is) the thing, instead of ''O le e ona le mea''. The sign of the nominative ''ʻo'', the prepositions o, a, i, e, and the [[euphonic]] particles i and ''te'', are unaccented; as ''ʻO maua, ma te o atu ia te oe'', we two will go to you.

''Ina'', the sign of the imperative, is accented on the ultima; ''ína'', the sign of the [[subjunctive]], on the penultima. The preposition ''iá'' is accented on the ultima, the pronoun ''ia'' on the penultima.&lt;ref name=pratt/&gt;

===Phonotactics===
Samoan [[phonotactics|syllable structure]] is (C)V, where V may be long or a diphthong. A sequence VV may occur only in derived forms and compound words; within roots, only the initial syllable may be of the form V. [[Metathesis (linguistics)|Metathesis]] of consonants is frequent, such as ''manu'' for ''namu'' 'scent', ''lavaʻau'' for ''valaʻau'' 'to call', but vowels may not be mixed up in this way.

Every syllable ends in a vowel. No syllable consists of more than three sounds, one consonant and two vowels, the two vowels making a diphthong; as ''fai'', ''mai'', ''tau''. Roots are sometimes [[monosyllabic]], but mostly [[disyllabic]] or a word consisting of two syllables. [[Polysyllabic]] words are nearly all derived or compound words; as ''nofogatā'' from ''nofo'' (sit, seat) and ''gatā'', difficult of access; ''taʻigaafi'', from ''taʻi'', to attend, and ''afi'', fire, the hearth, making to attend to the fire; ''talafaʻasolopito'', ("history") stories placed in order, ''faletalimalo'', ("communal house") house for receiving guests.&lt;ref name=pratt/&gt;

==Grammar==

===Morphology===

====Personal pronouns====
Like many Austronesian languages, Samoan has separate words for [[Clusivity|inclusive and exclusive we]], and distinguishes [[Grammatical number|singular]], [[dual (grammatical number)|dual]], and [[plural]]. The root for the inclusive pronoun may occur in the singular, in which case it indicates emotional involvement on the part of the speaker.

{| class="wikitable"
!
!singular

|-
! Second person
| ‘oe, ‘e
| ‘oulua
| ‘outou, tou
|-
! Third person
| ia / na
| lā‘ua
| lātou
|}

In formal speech, fuller forms of the roots ''mā-'', ''tā-'', and ''lā-'' are ''‘imā-'', ''‘itā-'', and ''‘ilā-.''

====Articles====
The definite article is ''le'': ''ʻo le Atua'', God; indefinite e.g., ''ʻo le matai o Pai'', (the) chief (named) Pai.  It is sometimes used where English would require the indefinite article: ''Ua tu mai le vaʻa'', a canoe appears. The article ''se'' is always a singular indefinite (''ta mai se laʻau'' = cut me a stick), while "ni" is the plural indefinite ("ta mai ni laʻau" = cut me some sticks). The article "le" is omitted before plural nouns: ''ʻO le tagata'', the person; ''ʻO tagata'', people.&lt;ref name=pratt/&gt;

====Nouns====
Names of natural objects, such as men, trees and animals, are mostly primitive nouns, e.g.''ʻO le la'', the sun; ''ʻo le tagata'', the person; ''ʻo le talo'', the taro; ''ʻo le iʻa'', the fish; also manufactured articles, such as ''matau'', an axe, ''vaʻa'', canoe, ''tao'', spear, ''fale'', house, etc.&lt;ref name=pratt/&gt;

Some nouns are derived from verbs by the addition of either ''ga'', ''saga'', ''taga'', ''maga'', or ''ʻaga'': such as ''tuli'', to chase; ''tuliga'', chasing; ''luluʻu'', to fill the hand; ''luʻutaga'', a handful; ''feanu'', to spit; ''anusaga'', spittle; ''tanu'', to bury; ''tanulia'', the part buried. These verbal nouns have an active participial meaning; e.g. ''ʻO le faiga o le fale'', the building of the house. Often they refer to the persons acting, in which case they govern the next noun in the genitive with ''a''; ''ʻO le faiga a fale'', contracted into ''ʻo le faiga fale'', those who build the house, the builders. In some cases verbal nouns refer to either persons or things done by them: ''ʻO le faiga a talo'', the getting of taro, or the party getting the ''taro'', or the ''taro'' itself which has been got. The context in such cases decides the meaning. Sometimes place is indicated by the termination; such as ''tofā'', to sleep; ''tofāga'', a sleeping-place, a bed. ''ʻO le taʻelega'' is either the bathing-place or the party of bathers. The first would take ''o'' after it to govern the next noun, ''ʻO le taʻelega o le nuʻu'', the bathing-place of the village; the latter would be followed by ''a'', ''ʻO le taʻelega a teine'', the bathing-place of the girls.

Sometimes such nouns have a passive meaning, such as being acted upon; ''ʻO le taomaga a lau'', the thatch that has been pressed; ''ʻo le faupuʻega a maʻa'', the heap of stones, that is, the stones which have been heaped up. Those nouns which take ''ʻaga'' are rare, except on [[Tutuila]]; ''gataʻaga'', the end; ''ʻamataʻaga'', the beginning; ''olaʻaga'', lifetime; ''misaʻaga'', quarrelling. Sometimes the addition of ''ga'' makes the signification intensive; such as ''ua'' and ''timu'', rain; ''uaga'' and ''timuga'', continued pouring (of rain).

The simple form of the verb is sometimes used as a noun: ''tatalo'', to pray; ''ʻo le tatalo'', a prayer; ''poto'', to be wise; ''ʻo le poto'', wisdom.

The reciprocal form of the verb is often used as a noun; e.g. ''ʻO le fealofani'', ''ʻo femisaiga'', quarrellings (from ''misa''), ''feʻumaiga''; ''E lelei le fealofani'', mutual love is good.

A few diminutives are made by [[reduplication]], e.g. ''paʻapaʻa'', small crabs; ''pulepule'', small shells; ''liilii'', ripples; '''ili'ili'', small stones.

Adjectives are made into abstract nouns by adding an article or pronoun; e.g. ''lelei'', good; ''ʻo le lelei'', goodness; ''silisili'', excellent or best; ''ʻo lona lea silisili'', that is his excellence or that is his best.

Many verbs may become participle-nouns by adding ''ga''; as ''sau'', come, ''sauga''; e.g. ''ʻO lona sauga muamua '', his first coming; ''mau” to mauga'', ''ʻO le mauga muamua'', the first dwelling.

====Gender====
Gender is sometimes expressed by distinct names:

{{col-begin|width=585px}}
{{col-break|width=50%}}
''ʻO le matai'', a chief.

''ʻO le tamāloa'', a man.

''ʻO le tama'', a boy.

''ʻO le poʻa'', a male animal.

''ʻO le toeaʻina'', an elderly man.

''sole'', colloquial male label.

{{col-break|width=50%}}
''ʻO le tamaitaʻi'', a lady.

''ʻO le fafine'', a woman.

''ʻO le teine'', a girl.

''ʻO le manu fafine'', a female animal.

''ʻO le loʻomatua'', an elderly woman.

''suga, funa'', colloquial female label.

{{col-end}}

When no distinct name exists, the gender of animals is known by adding ''poʻa'' and ''fafine'' respectively. The gender of some few plants is distinguished by ''tane'' and ''fafine'', as in ''ʻo le esi tane''; ''ʻo le esi fafine''. No other names of objects have any mark of gender.&lt;ref name=pratt/&gt;

====Number====
The singular number is known by the article with the noun; e.g. ''ʻo le tama'', a boy.

Properly there is no dual. It is expressed by omitting the article and adding numbers ''e lua'' for things e.g. ''e toʻalua teine'', two girls, for persons; or ''ʻo fale e lua'', two houses; ''ʻo tagata e toʻalua'', two persons; or ''ʻo lāʻua'', them/those two (people).

The plural is known by:
# the omission of the article; ''ʻo ʻulu'', breadfruits.
# particles denoting multitude, as ''ʻau'', ''vao'', ''mou'', and ''moíu'', and such plural is emphatic; ''ʻo le ʻau iʻa'', a shoal of fishes; ''ʻo le vao tagata'', a forest of men, i.e., a great company; ''ʻo le mou mea'', a great number of things; ''ʻo le motu o tagata'', a crowd of people. These particles cannot be used indiscriminately; ''motu'' could not be used with fish, nor ''ʻau'' with men.
# lengthening, or more correctly doubling, a vowel in the word; ''tuafāfine'', instead of ''tuafafine'', sisters of a brother. This method is rare.&lt;ref name=pratt/&gt;

Plurality is also expressed by internal [[reduplication]] in Samoan verbs ''(-CV- infix)'', by which the [[root (linguistics)|root]] or [[Stem (linguistics)|stem]] of a [[word]], or part of it, is repeated.

====Possessives====
Possessive relations are indicated by the particles ''a'' or ''o''. Possessive pronouns also have a-forms and o-forms: ''lou'', ''lau'', ''lona'', ''lana'', ''lo'' and ''la matou'', etc. Writers in the 1800s like Platt were unable to understand the underlying principles governing the use of the two forms: "There is no general rule which will apply to every case. The governing noun decides which should be used; thus ''ʻO le poto ʻo le tufuga fai fale'', "the wisdom of the builder"; ''ʻO le amio a le tama'', "the conduct of the boy"; ''ʻupu o fāgogo'', "words of ''fāgogo''" (a form of narrated and sung storytelling); but ''ʻupu a tagata'', "words of men". Pratt instead gives a rote list of uses and exceptions:

''O'' is used with:
# Nouns denoting parts of the body; ''fofoga o le aliʻi'', eyes of the chief. So of hands, legs, hair, etc.; except the beard, which takes ''a'', ''lana ʻava''; but a chief's is ''lona soesa''. Different terms and words apply to chiefs and people of rank and status according to the 'polite' variant of the Samoan language, similar to the 'polite' variant in the [[Japanese language]].
# The mind and its affections; ''ʻo le toʻasa o le aliʻi'', the wrath of the chief. So of the will, desire, love, fear, etc.; ''ʻO le manaʻo o le nuʻu'', the desire of the land; ''ʻO le mataʻu o le tama'', the fear of the boy.
# Houses, and all their parts; canoes, land, country, trees, plantations; thus, ''pou o le fale'', posts of the house; ''lona fanua'', ''lona naʻu'', etc.
# People, relations, slaves; ''ʻo ona tagata'', his people; ''ʻo le faletua o le aliʻi'', the chief's wife. So also of a son, daughter, father, etc. Exceptions; ''Tane'', husband; ''ava'', wife (of a common man), and children, which take ''a''; ''lana'', ''ava'', ''ma'', ''ana'', ''fānau''.
# Garments, etc., if for use; ''ona ʻofu''. Except when spoken of as property, riches, things laid up in store.

''A'' is used with:
# Words denoting conduct, custom, etc.; ''amio'', ''masani'', ''tu''.
# Language, words, speeches; ''gagana'', ''upu'', ''fetalaiga'', ''afioga''; ''ʻO le upu a le tama''.
# Property of every kind. Except garments, etc., for use.
# Those who serve, animals, men killed and carried off in war; ''lana tagata''.
# Food of every kind.
# Weapons and implements, as clubs, knives, swords, bows, cups, [[pe'a|tattooing]] instruments, etc. Except spears, axes, and ''ʻoso'' (the stick used for planting ''taro''), which take ''o''.
# Work; as ''lana galuega''. Except ''faiva'', which takes ''o''.

Some words take either ''a'' or ''o''; as ''manatu'', ''taofi'', ''ʻO se tali a [[Matautu]]'', an answer given by Matautu; ''ʻo se tali ʻo Matautu'', an answer given to Matautu.

Exceptions:
# Nouns denoting the vessel and its contents do not take the particle between them: ''ʻo le ʻato talo'', a basket of taro; ''ʻo le fale oloa'', a house of property, shop, or store-house.
# Nouns denoting the material of which a thing is made: ''ʻO le tupe auro'', a coin of gold; ''ʻo le vaʻa ifi'', a canoe of teak.
# Nouns indicating members of the body are rather compounded with other nouns instead of being followed by a possessive particle: ''ʻO le mataivi'', an eye of bone; ''ʻo le isu vaʻa'', a nose of a canoe; ''ʻo le gutu sumu'', a mouth of the sumu (type of fish); ''ʻo le loto alofa'', a heart of love.
# Many other nouns are compounded in the same way: ''ʻO le apaau tane'', the male wing; ''ʻo le pito pou'', the end of the post.
# The country or town of a person omits the particle: ''ʻO le tagata Sāmoa'', a man or person of Samoa.
# Nouns ending in a, lengthen (or double) that letter before other nouns in the possessive form: ''ʻO le sua susu''; ''ʻo le maga ala'', or ''maga a ala'', a branch road.
# The sign of the possessive is not used between a town and its proper name, but the topic marker 'o is repeated; thus putting the two in apposition: ''ʻO le ʻaʻai ʻo Matautu'', the commons of Matautu.

====Adjectives====
Some adjectives are primitive, as ''umi'', long; ''poto'', wise. Some are formed from nouns by the addition of ''a'', meaning "covered with" or "infested with"; thus, ''ʻeleʻele'', dirt; ''ʻeleʻelea'', dirty; ''palapala'', mud; ''palapalā'', muddy.

Others are formed by doubling the noun; as ''pona'', a knot; ''ponapona'', knotty; ''fatu'', a stone; ''fatufatu'', stony.

Others are formed by prefixing ''faʻa'' to the noun; as ''ʻo le tu [[fa'asamoa|fa'asāmoa]]'', Samoan custom or ''[[fa'amatai]].

Like ''ly'' in English, the ''faʻa'' often expresses [[wikt:similitude|similitude]]; ''ʻo le amio faʻapuaʻa'', behave like a pig (literally).

In one or two cases ''a'' is prefixed; as ''apulupulu'', sticky, from ''pulu'', resin; ''avanoa'', open; from ''vā'' and ''noa''.

Verbs are also used as adjectives: ''ʻo le ala faigatā'', a difficult road; ''ʻo le vai tafe'', a river, flowing water; ''ʻo le laʻau ola'', a live tree; also the passive: ''ʻo le aliʻi mātaʻutia''.

''Ma'' is the prefix of condition, ''sae'', to tear; ''masae'', torn; as, ''ʻO le iʻe masae'', torn cloth; Goto, to sink; ''magoto'', sunk; ''ʻo le vaʻa magoto'', a sunken canoe.

A kind of compound adjective is formed by the union of a noun with an adjective; as ''ʻo le tagata lima mālosi'', a strong man, literally, the stronghanded man; ''ʻo le tagata loto vaivai'', a weak-spirited man.

Nouns denoting the materials out of which things are made are used as adjectives: ''ʻo le mama auro'', a gold ring; ''ʻo le fale maʻa'', a stone house. Or they may be reckoned as nouns in the genitive.

Adjectives expressive of colours are mostly reduplicated words; as ''sinasina' or "paʻepaʻe" (white); ''uliuli'' (black); ''samasama'' (yellow); ''ʻenaʻena'" (brown); ''mumu" (red), etc.; but when they follow a noun they are usually found in their simple form; as ''ʻo le ʻie sina'', white cloth; ''ʻo le puaʻa uli'', a black pig. The plural is sometimes distinguished by doubling the first syllable; as ''sina'', white; plural, ''sisina''; ''tele'', great; pl. ''tetele''. In compound words the first syllable of the root is doubled; as ''maualuga'', high; pl. ''maualuluga''. Occasionally the reciprocal form is used as a plural; as ''lele'', flying; ''ʻo manu felelei'', flying creatures, birds.

Comparison is generally effected by using two adjectives, both in the positive state; thus ''e lelei lenei'', ''ʻa e leaga lena'', this is good – but that is bad, not in itself, but in comparison with the other; ''e umi lenei'', a e puupuu lena'', this is long, that is short.

The [[superlative]] is formed by the addition of an [[adverb]], such as ''matuā'', ''tasi'', ''sili'', ''silisiliʻese aʻiaʻi'', ''naʻuā''; as ''ʻua lelei tasi'', it alone is good – that is, nothing equals it. ''ʻUa matuā silisili ona lelei'', it is very exceedingly good; ''ʻua tele naʻuā'', it is very great. ''Silisili ese'', highest, ''ese'', differing from all others.

''Naua'' has often the meaning of "too much"; ''ua tele naua'', it is greater than is required.

===Syntax===
Sentences have different types of [[word order]] and the four most commonly used are [[verb–subject–object]] (VSO), [[verb–object–subject]] (VOS), [[subject–verb–object]] (SVO) and [[object–verb–subject]] (OVS).&lt;ref name=hunkin&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=mnIg9rH97_UC&amp;pg=PA122&amp;lpg=PA122&amp;dq=Samoan+language+word+order|title=Gagana Sāmoa: A Samoan Language Coursebook|first=Galumalemana Afeleti|last=Hunkin|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|year=2009|pages=103–105|isbn=0-8248-3131-4|accessdate=10 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Language, gender, and sex in comparative perspective |last=Philips |first=Susan Urmston |authorlink= |author2=Susan Steele |author3=Christine Tanz  |year=1987 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location= |isbn= 978-0-521-33807-3 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/?id=4tW2fS3cU-sC&amp;dq=Samoan+OVS+language |accessdate=3 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ochs/&gt;

=== Negation ===
A [[phrase]] or [[clause]] can be made [[Affirmative and negative|negative]] by the addition of a [[Grammatical particle|particle]], a [[morpheme]] usually meaning ‘not’. There are two common negative particles in Samoan, ''lē'' and ''leʻi'' (sometimes also written as ''lei'')''.'' ''Lē'' has the [[allomorph]]s [le:] or [le] ([[Ulrike Mosel|Mosel]] &amp; [[Even Hovdhaugen|Hovdhaugen]], 1992, pp.&amp;nbsp;142, 375).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Samoan Reference Grammar|last=Mosel|first=Ulrike|last2=Hovdhaugen|first2=Even|publisher=Scandinavian University Press : Institute for Comparative Research in Human Culture.|year=1992|isbn=|location=Oslo, Norway|pages=56, 114, 140–142, 175–179, 259, 331, 375–376, 479–483, 500–501.}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Lē'' should not be confused for ''le'', the specific [[Article (grammar)|singular article]], which indicates that the [[noun phrase]] refers to one particular entity (Mosel &amp; Hovdhaugen, 1992, pp.&amp;nbsp;259). ''Lē'' and ''lei'' negate [[Sentence (linguistics)|declarative and interrogative sentences]], but do not negate [[Imperative mood|imperative]] sentences. Negative imperative [[verb]]s are discussed later in this entry. ''Lē'' (meaning “not”) can be combined with all [[Tense–aspect–mood|tense-aspect-mood]] particles (or 'TAM' particles), except those that are [[Optative mood|optative]] and [[Subjunctive mood|subjunctive]], such as ''neʻi'', ''seʻi'', and ''ʻia'' (Mosel &amp; Hovdhaugen, 1992, pp.375).

A negative particle may mark a negative verbal clause, as seen in the example below (from Mosel &amp; Hovdhaugen, 1992, pp.56).
{{interlinear|lang=sm|number=(1)
|‘Ua '''lē''' fiafia le tama
|PERF not happy ART boy
|'The boy is unhappy.'}}
	
In this example of a negated [[Sentence (linguistics)|declarative sentence]], it can be seen that, in Samoan, there is no equivalent [[Interlinear gloss|gloss]] for 'unhappy'. The negative particle ''lē'' modifies the verbal clause to form something like “not happy” instead.

The meaning of ''leʻi'' differs slightly from that of ''lē.'' ''Leʻi'' indicates that an event or state has not been actualised yet, or for the time being, but is expected to become so. Therefore, ''leʻi'' is often translated as “not yet” rather than simply “not”. ''Leʻi'' is usually only combined with the general [[Tense–aspect–mood|TAM]] particle ''e'' or ''te''. See the example below (from Mosel &amp; Hovdhaugen, 1992, pp.&amp;nbsp;376).
{{interlinear|lang=sm|number=(2)|ablist = GENR:general tense/aspect/mood particle
|E '''lei''' tea Tutuila ae amata le pele
|GENR {not yet} part Tutuila but begin ART card-playing
|'The playing of cards started already before we left Tutuila.'}}

The above example (2) demonstrates the common usage of ''leʻi'' to mean “not yet”. In some cases, ''leʻi'' simply means “no, not at all”, expressing the concept that an event that had been expected to happen or had been thought to have happened, did not occur after all (Mosel &amp; Hovdhaugen, 1992, pp.&amp;nbsp;479).

There is a particle, ''faʻa=,'' that acts as a [[causative]], as well being as the most common [[prefix]] in the Samoan language. This particle can be attached to nearly all [[noun]]s and [[Ergative verb|non-ergative verbs.]] When attached to negated [[verb phrase]]s, ''faʻa='' means having the qualities of or being similar to whatever is [[Denotation|denoted]] by the basic [[Word stem|stem]] or phrase. It is often combined with the negative particle ''lē'' (or its [[allomorph]]s) to form the construction ''faʻa=lē=''. Prefixing ''Faʻa=lē='' onto a verb provides a polite way to say a negative phrase. Mosel &amp; Hovdhaugen (1992, pp.&amp;nbsp;175–179) state that these particles provide three ways to express negative evaluations that vary on a scale of politeness, as demonstrated below:
{|

==== Position of negation in sentences ====
In Samoan, particles modifying sentences usually take the first place in the sentence, with the exception of the question particle ''ʻea''. The particles forming a category are not always mutually exclusive: for instance, while two negative particles cannot be combined, certain [[Preposition and postposition|prepositions]] can occur together. Additionally, negative prenuclear particles will follow the preverbal pronoun or the [[Tense–aspect–mood|TAM]] particle (Mosel &amp; Hovdhaugen, 1992, pp.140).

In the following examples from Mosel &amp; Hovdhaugen (1992, pp.331), the negative particles follow the TAM particle ''te'' (Example 1: ''e'') or the preverbal pronoun (Example 2: ''ʻou''). 
{{interlinear|lang=sm|number=(1)|ablist = GENR:general tense/aspect/mood particle
|'''E''' '''lē''' lelei
|GENR not good
|'It is not good.'}}

{{interlinear|lang=sm|number=(2)|ablist = GENR:general tense/aspect/mood particle
|'''ʻOu''' te '''lē''' alu i Apia
|1sg GENR not go LD Apia
|'I don't go to Apia.'}}

In both examples, the negative particle is in the second position, after the preverbal pronoun and/or the [[Tense–aspect–mood|TAM]] particle. In Example 2, there is both a preverbal pronoun (''‘ou'') AND a TAM particle following it (''te''). This demonstrates that the negative particle must always follow these two types of preceding particles in the sentence, even if they are both present.

==== Verbs exempt from negation ====
There are two existential verbs in Samoan: ''iai,'' “to exist, be present” and the negative equivalent ''leai'' [leái] or [le:ái], “to not exist, be absent”. They differ from all other Samoan verbs in at least one respect: they cannot be negated by a negative particle. [[Ulrike Mosel|Mosel]] &amp; [[Even Hovdhaugen|Hovdhaugen]] (1992, pp.114) suggest that this originates in the [[etymology]] of these verbs: the negative existential verb ''leai'' is probably [[Morphological derivation|derived]] from ''lē'' (“not”) and ''ai'' (ANAPH, “not there”). It seems that the inclusion of negation in the verb itself disallows the negative particle from the sentence structure.

See the example from Mosel &amp; Hovdhaugen (1992, pp.56) in the sentence below: 
{{interlinear|lang=sm|number=(1)|ablist = GENR:general tense/aspect/mood particle; SP:specific; DIR:directional
|E '''leai''' ni taavale, aua e '''lei''' oo atu i ai ala taavale
|GENR {not exist} ART(NSP.PL) car because GENR {not yet} reach DIR LD ANAPH road(SP.PL) car
|'There were not any cars, because the roads did not reach there.'}}

In this example, the existential verb ''leai'' has been used to indicate the absence of something (that is, the cars) rather than using a negative particle. However, a negative particle (''lei'') has been used in the second [[clause]], modifying the verbal clause to create the [[phrase]] “the roads did NOT reach there”, with the emphasis on the absence of the roads in that area.

According to Mosel &amp; Hovdhaugen (1992, pp.&amp;nbsp;480–481) the only [[Tense–aspect–mood|TAM]] particles that appear with ''leai'' are ''ʻua'' and ''e or te.'' This means that ''leai'' acts as if non-existence is a general fact, rather than linking it to a specific point in time. When another verb follows ''leai'' within the same [[verb phrase]], it functions as a more emphatic negation meaning something like “not at all”. This is demonstrated in the following example: 
{{interlinear|lang=sm|number=(2)|ablist = GENR:general tense/aspect/mood particle
|E '''leai''' gāoi Sina
|GENR {not exist} move Sina
|'Sina didn't move at all.'}}

Here, the addition of ''leai'' to the verb ''gāoi'' “to move” makes the statement more emphatic: not only did Sina not move, she did not move ''at all''.

==== Negative imperative verbs ====
There are two negative [[Imperative mood|imperative]] [[verb]]s, ''ʻaua'' and ''sōia.'' ''&lt;nowiki/&gt;ʻAua'' should not be confused with ''aua'', which means "because". These negative imperative verbs can be used independently of negative particles; as the negation is in the verb itself, an extra particle is not required. ''ʻAua'' means “don’t do, should not do” and is employed to express commands in both [[Direct speech|direct]] and [[indirect speech]]. What should not be done is indicated by a verbal [[Complement (linguistics)|complement clause]], as seen in the example below (Mosel &amp; Hovdhaugen, 1992, pp.&amp;nbsp;482). 
{{interlinear|lang=sm|number=(1)|ablist = GENR:general tense/aspect/mood particle; SP:specific
|'''‘Aua''' e te fa‘asāunoa 'i mea{{=}}ola
|Don't 2.sg. GENR torture LD thing{{=}}life(SP.PL)
|'Do not torture animals.'}}
As discussed above, this sentence does not require a negative particle, because the negative [[Imperative mood|imperative]] verb is sufficient. Alternatively, ''sōia'' means that ‘one should stop doing something one has already started’ (Mosel &amp; Hovdhaugen, 1992, pp.&amp;nbsp;483). As with ''ʻaua'', what should not be done is indicated by a [[Complement (linguistics)|verbal complement]]. In [[direct speech]], ''sōia'' is either used in the [[Imperative mood|imperative]] without any [[Tense–aspect–mood|TAM]] particle or in the [[Optative mood|optative]] marked by ''seiʻi'' (Mosel &amp; Hovdhaugen, 1992, pp.483).

See the example below with ''sōia'' as the negative imperative:
{{interlinear|lang=sm|number=(2)|ablist = GENR:general tense/aspect/mood particle
|Mandy-Jane! '''sōia''' e te faitala!
|Mandy-Jane stop 2sg GENR gossip
|'Mandy-Jane! Stop gossiping!'}}
This works differently from ''ʻaua'', although they are both [[Imperative mood|imperative]]. It can be seen here that ''sōia'' means something like “cease what you are doing immediately” while ''ʻaua'' means “don’t do that action" (in a general sense).

==== Negation of existential clauses ====
The [[noun phrase]] forming an [[existential clause]] is introduced by a [[Preposition and postposition|preposition]]: ''ʻo'' or ''naʻo'', meaning “only”. An existential clause is negated with a complex clause: Mosel &amp; Hovdhaugen (1992, pp.&amp;nbsp;500–501) state that 'the existential clause functions as the [[Argument (linguistics)|argument]] of a verbal [[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]] formed by a [[Tense–aspect–mood|TAM]] particle and the negative particle ''lē'' (“not”)'. An example of this can be seen in the example below, where the preposition ''o'' precedes the negative particle ''lē''.
{{interlinear|lang=sm|number=(1)
|Aua foi, {'''o le''' a} '''le''' o Niu Sila, '''le''' '''o''' le Kolisi o Samoa a o le ta{{=}}mea ma le auli...
|Because also, FUT not PRES New Zealand not PRES ART college POSS Samoa but PRES ART beat{{=}}thing and ART ironing
|'There will be no New Zealand, no Samoan college [for me to go to if I do not pass the exam], but [only] washing and ironing [at home]....'}}
This complex sentence has several examples of negation where the negative particle lē is combined with the preposition ''o'' in order to negate an existential clause ("there will be no...").

==Registers==

===Formal versus colloquial register===
The language has a polite or  formal variant used in oratory and [[ceremony]] as well as in communication with elders, guests, people of rank and strangers.&lt;ref name=ochs&gt;{{cite book |title=Culture and language development |last=Ochs |first=Elinor |year=1988 |publisher=CUP Archive |isbn=0-521-34894-3 |page=56 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Zwc5AAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=colloquial+samoan+k+speech |accessdate= 18 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The consonant system of colloquial Samoan ("casual Samoan", or "tautala leaga" as it is known) is slightly different from the literary language ("proper Samoan", or "tautala lelei"), and is referred to as '''K speech''' or '''K style'''.&lt;ref name=hunkin/&gt; In colloquial speech, defined as taking place in casual social situations among intimates or in the home among familiars of equivalent social rank, /t/ is sometimes pronounced [k] and /n/ has merged with /ŋ/ as [ŋ]. Additionally, /l/ is pronounced {{IPA|[ɾ]}} following a back vowel (/a, o, u/) and preceding an /i/. /s/ is less [[sibilant]] than in English, and /h/ and /r/ are found only in borrowings, with /s/ and /l/ sometimes being substituted for them.

Therefore, in colloquial Samoan speech, common consonant replacements occur such as:&lt;ref name=hunkin/&gt;&lt;ref name=ochs/&gt;

'''t''' is pronounced '''k''' – ''tama'' (child, boy) is pronounced ''kama''; ''tautala'' ("to speak") is pronounced ''kaukala''; ''tulāfale'' ("orator", "talking chief") is pronounced ''kulāfale''.

'''n''' is pronounced '''ng''' – ''fono'' ("meeting", "assembly") is pronounced ''fongo''; ''ono'' (the numeral "six") is pronounced ''ongo''; ''mā{{okina}}ona'' ("satisfied", "full") is pronounced ''mā{{okina}}onga''.

===Oratorical register===
Historically and culturally, an important form of the Samoan language is oratory, a ceremonial language sometimes referred to in publications as 'chiefly language', or ''gagana fa'aaloalo'' ("dignified language")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Language and meaning: the structural creation of reality|last=Beedham |first=Christopher |year=2005 |publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|isbn=90-272-1564-2 |page=140|url=https://books.google.com/?id=PurwkTC8ydIC&amp;dq=Samoan+chiefly+language |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which incorporates classical Samoan terms and prose as well as a different set of vocabulary, which is tied to the roles of orator chiefs (''tulāfale'') and 'speechmaking' (''failāuga'') that remains part of the culture's continuing indigenous ''[[fa'amatai|matai]]'' system of governance and social organization. The ''gagana fa'aaloalo'' (polite speech) register is used by lower-ranking people to address people of higher status, such as their family ''matai'' chief, government officials, or clergy. It is also the formal register used among chiefs during ceremonial occasions and social rites such as funerals, weddings, chiefly title bestowals and village council meetings. It is not common for entire conversations to be held in chiefly register, instead the "dignified language" is mainly employed when making formal introductions between individuals, opening and concluding formal meetings, and executing ceremonial tasks (such as the [[Samoa 'ava ceremony]]). It is also considered proper to use the "polite" language when praying. Untitled people (those without ''matai'' chief titles) who are unfamiliar with each other will often greet each other in chiefly register as a common courtesy, while familiar individuals frequently use chiefly addresses in jest (as in humorously addressing friends with "talofa lava lau afioga" – "respectful greetings your highness" – instead of the more colloquial "malo sole!" – "hey man!").

Another polite form of speech in "polite" Samoan includes terms and phrases of self-abasement that are used by the speaker in order to show respect and flatter the listener. For example when praising the child of another woman, a mother might politely refer to her own children as "ui" (literally, "piglets"); in order to emphasize the beauty of a fine [[tapa cloth]], the presenter might refer to it as a simple "vala" (plain cloth); the weaver of an especially fine mat might call it "launiu" (coconut leaf) or "lā" (sail cloth) in order to not appear boastful. Overshadowing the dignity or prestige of higher-ranking individuals is a grave offense in Samoan culture, so words are chosen very carefully to express individual feelings in a way that acknowledges relative statuses within social hierarchy.

==Alphabet==
Encounters with [[Europe]]ans began in the 1700s, followed by the era of colonialism in the Pacific. Samoan was only a spoken language until the early to mid-1800s when Christian missionaries began documenting the spoken language for religious texts and introducing the [[Latin script]] for writing. In 1834, an [[orthography]] of the language was distributed by the [[London Missionary Society]], which also set up a printing press by 1839. The first complete [[Bible]] (''Tusi Pa'ia'', Sacred Book) in Samoan was completed and published in 1862.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Book and Print Culture in New Zealand |last=Hunkin |first=Alfred |author2=Penny Griffith |author3=Lagi Sipeli |author4=Jean Mitaera  |year=1997 |publisher=Victoria University Press|location=Wellington, NZ |isbn= 978-0-86473-331-3 |page=250|url=http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-GriBook-_div3-N1370A.html |accessdate=22 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first problem that faced the missionaries in Polynesia was that of learning the language of the island, which they intended to convert to [[Christianity]]. The second was that of identifying the sounds in the local languages with the symbols employed in their own languages to establish alphabets for recording the spelling of native words. Having established more-or-less satisfactory alphabets and spelling, teaching the indigenous people how to write and read their own language was next necessary. A [[printing press]], with the alphabet keys used only English, was part of the mission equipment, and it was possible not only to translate and write out portions of the [[Bible]] scriptures, and hymns in the local language but also to print them for use as texts in teaching. Thus, the missionaries introduced writing for the first time within Polynesia, were the first printers and established the first schools in villages.&lt;ref name=buck&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-BucIntr-t1-body-d6-d2.html|work=NZETC, Victoria University of Wellington|title=An Introduction to Polynesian Anthropology|first=Te Rangi|last=Hiroa|year=1945|page=28|publisher= Kraus Reprint Co.,|location=Honolulu|accessdate=17 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{anchor|diacritics}}Alphabet===
{{see also|Samoan Braille}}
The alphabet proper consists of only 14 letters: 5 vowels, '''a''' '''e''' '''i''' '''o''' '''u''', and 9 [[consonant]]s, '''f''' '''g''' '''l''' '''m''' '''n''' '''p''' '''s''' '''t''' '''v'''. In addition, there are two diacritics. A [[macron (diacritic)|macron]] (''fa'amamafa'') indicates the five long vowels, '''ā ē ī ō ū''', as in ''manu'' 'animal', ''mānu'' 'float, afloat', and a reversed apostrophe, '''{{okina}}''' (''koma liliu'' or ''[[ʻokina]]''), indicates the [[glottal stop (letter)|glottal stop]], as in many other [[Polynesian languages]]. The '''{{okina}}''' (''ʻokina'') is often replaced by '''{{apostrophe}}''' (''[[apostrophe]]'') in modern usage.&lt;ref name="hunkin xiii"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mnIg9rH97_UC&amp;pg=PA122&amp;lpg=PA122&amp;dq=Samoan+language+word+order&amp;|title=Gagana Sāmoa: A Samoan Language Coursebook|first=Galumalemana Afeleti|last=Hunkin|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|year=2009|page=xiii |isbn=0-8248-3131-4|accessdate=17 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The additional letters '''h''', '''k''', '''r''' are used in foreign [[loanword]]s, apart from the single [[interjection]] ''puke(ta)!'' 'gotcha!'; although the sound {{IPA|[k]}} is found in native words in colloquial speech, it is spelled '''t'''. The letter '''g''' represents a velar nasal, as in the English word ''sing,'' rather than a voiced velar stop, as in the English ''go.'' Thus, the correct pronunciation of [[Pago Pago]] is not ''Pay-go Pay-go'' but ''Pah-ngo Pah-ngo''.

The first grammar and dictionary of the Samoan language, ''A Grammar and Dictionary of the Samoan Language, with English and Samoan Vocabulary'', was written by Reverend [[George Pratt (missionary)|George Pratt]] in 1862.&lt;ref name=pratt&gt;{{cite book| title =  A Grammar and Dictionary of the Samoan Language, with English and Samoan vocabulary | first = George | last = Pratt | year = 1984 | origyear = 1893 | url = http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-PraDict.html | edition = 3rd and revised | publisher = R.

The term ''mano'' was an utmost limit until the adoption of loan words like ''miliona'' (million) and ''piliona'' (billion). Otherwise, quantities beyond ''mano'' were referred to as ''manomano'' or ''ilu''; that is, innumerable.&lt;ref name=pratt/&gt;

The prefix ''fa'a'' is also used to indicate the number of times.
For example; ''fa'atolu'' – three times. Or ''fa'afia?'' – how many times?

The prefix "lona" or "le" indicates sequential numbering, as in "lona lua" (second), lona tolu (third), "le fa" (fourth); "muamua" or "ulua'i" denote "first". Familial sequence was denoted with terms such as ''ulumatua'' ("eldest"), ''ui'i'' ("youngest"), and ''ogatotonu'' ("middle child"); first and last born were also deemed honorifically, ''pa le manava'' ("opening the womb") and ''pupuni le manava'' ("sealing the womb"), respectively.

To denote the number of persons, the term ''to'a'' is used. 
For example; ''E to'afitu tagata e o i le pasi''. Seven people are going/travelling by bus.

The suffix "lau" is used when formally counting fish, in reference to the customary plaiting of fish in leaves ("lau") before cooking.
For example: "tolu lau" – three fishes

There are also formal prefixes or suffixes used in the chiefly register when counting different species of fish, [[taro]], [[Yam (vegetable)|yams]], [[banana]]s, [[chickens]], [[pigs]], and other foodstuffs.

=== Similarities to other Austronesian languages ===

=== Language Preservation ===
Though it is not the primary language of a number of nations outside of Samoa, there is an effort by the descendants of Samoans to learn the native language of their ancestors and to better understand their origins and history. Much like any language, a shift is occurring in the way words are spoken and pronounced, especially as Samoans further integrate with other languages. Unfortunately, most looking to learn Samoan are forced to turn to written materials instead of living examples. To preserve the language, linguists must use diacritical marks. Without them, the actual pronunciations of words quickly become altered and lost.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tualaulelei|first=Eseta Magaui|last2=Mayer|first2=Fepuleai Lasei John|last3=Hunkin|first3=Galumalemana A.|date=2015-06-05|title=Diacritical Marks and the Samoan Language|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/583352|journal=The Contemporary Pacific|volume=27|issue=1|pages=183–207|doi=10.1353/cp.2015.0007|issn=1527-9464}}&lt;/ref&gt; The marks are commonly found before, under and above letters in words and are especially helpful for students and non-native speakers to realize the difference the vowels and glottal stops can make in the pronunciation of words.

Below is another example of a sentence with and without diacritical marks from the Samoan Bible (O le tusi paia, o le Feagaiga Tuai ma le Feagaiga fou lea) [https://books.google.com/books?id=aDs7AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PR14&amp;dq=%22Faauta,+ua+e+le+foai+mai+ia+te+au%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjt09b0ka_VAhWnh1QKHY_XDhgQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Faauta%2C%20ua%20e%20le%20foai%20mai%20ia%20te%20au%22&amp;f=false &lt;nowiki&gt;[1]&lt;/nowiki&gt;]:

[[File:Hauula Oahu.JPG|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Hauula%20Oahu.JPG|thumb|Sign with diacritic mark for Hauʻula elementary school in Hawaii]]
Samoan diacritical marks may seem confusing at first due to the way the language shifts based on context. Also, the mixed use of diacritical marks in literature and even within the same publication can surprise non-native speakers. This is evident in the Bible translation created by early missionaries and Reverend George Pratt which features markings in some words and not others. Part of it was due to the need to save time on the writing and typesetting and to use the markings as a guideline.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;  Much like the Bible helped improve literacy and understanding of the language throughout Samoan communities, written works continue to be important in much the same way today.

The use of the diacritical marks are not only prevalent in Samoan but also other proto-Polynesian languages, such as Hawaiian, where similar pronunciation losses exist. Since native speakers understand how a word should be pronounced without the markings, words are commonly written and accepted with the markings absent. To prevent the loss of correct pronunciations, however, language preservation groups and the Samoan and Hawaiian governments, are taking measure to include diacritical markings in signage, television programs, school materials and printed media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pireport.org/articles/2013/12/30/samoa-language-center-hawai%E2%80%98i-receives-multi-year-grant|title=Samoa Language Center In Hawai‘i Receives Multi-Year Grant {{!}} Pacific Islands Report|website=www.pireport.org|access-date=2017-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/international/programmes/datelinepacific/audio/2583909/samoa-government-makes-moves-to-preserve-language|title=Samoa government makes moves to preserve language|date=2014-01-29|work=Radio New Zealand|access-date=2017-07-29|language=en-nz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20344">'''Second-language acquisition classroom research''' is an area of research in [[second-language acquisition]] concerned with how people learn languages in educational settings. There is a significant overlap between classroom research and [[language education]]. Classroom research is [[empirical]], basing its findings on [[data]] and [[statistics]] wherever possible. It is also more concerned with what the [[student|learners]] do in the classroom than with what the [[teacher]] does. Where [[Methods of teaching foreign languages|language teaching methods]] may only concentrate on the activities the teacher plans for the class, classroom research concentrates on the effect the things the teacher does has on the students.

==Evaluating teaching practices==
Efforts have been made to systematically measure or evaluate the effectiveness of language teaching practices in promoting second-language acquisition. Such studies have been undertaken for every level of language, from phonetics to pragmatics, and for almost every current teaching methodology. It is therefore impossible to summarize their findings here. However, some more general issues have been addressed.

Research has indicated that many traditional [[Language education|language-teaching]] techniques are extremely inefficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lightbown|1990}} cited in {{Harvnb|Ellis|1994}}.&lt;/ref&gt; One issue is the effectiveness of explicit teaching: can language teaching have a constructive effect ''beyond'' providing learners with enhanced input?  Research on this at different levels of language has produced quite different results.  Traditional areas of explicit teaching, such as [[phonology]], grammar and vocabulary, have had decidedly mixed results. It is generally agreed that pedagogy restricted to teaching grammar rules and vocabulary lists does not give students the ability to use the L2 with accuracy and fluency.  Rather, to become proficient in the L2, the learner must be given opportunities to use the L2 for communicative purposes, learning (as for example, through a teacher's corrective feedback) to attend to both meaning and formal accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Doughty|Williams|1998}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ellis|2002}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corrective feedback==
There is considerable promising research in the classroom on the impact of corrective feedback on L2 learners' use and acquisition of target language forms. The effectiveness of corrective feedback has been shown to vary depending on the technique used to make the correction, and the overall focus of the classroom, whether on formal accuracy or on communication of meaningful content.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lightbown|Spada|1990}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lyster|Ranta|1997}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lyster|Mori|2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it appears that a learner's ability to focus on corrective feedback on grammatical features that do not affect meaning is considerably altered when the learner has low alphabetic literacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tarone|Bigelow|Hansen|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Action research==
There is considerable interest in supplementing published research with approaches that engage language teachers in action research on learner language in their own classrooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allwright|Hanks|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As teachers become aware of the features of learner language produced by their students, they can refine their pedagogical intervention to maximize interlanguage development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tarone|Swierzbin|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Horwitz summarises findings of SLA research, and applies to L2 teaching some principles of L2 acquisition honed from a vast body of relevant literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Horwitz|1986}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Like Asher,{{vague|date=November 2010}} Horwitz highlights the importance of naturalistic experience in L2, promoting listening and reading practice and stressing involvement in lifelike conversations. She explicitly suggests teaching practices based on these principles; ‘[m]uch class time should be devoted to the development of listening and reading abilities’, and ‘[t]eachers should assess student interests and supply appropriate…materials’.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Horwitz|1986|pp=685–686}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The ‘audio-lingual’ teaching practices used in the present study are based on principles explicated by Asher and Horwitz; listening featured heavily, closely followed by reading and speaking practice. The vocabulary items taught were deemed relevant for all learners, regardless of age, and, according to Pfeffer, they are among the most commonly used nouns in everyday German language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pfeffer|1964}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pedagogical content knowledge ==

[[Pedagogical content knowledge]] is understood as the “blending of content and pedagogy”&lt;ref&gt;Shulman, L.S. (1987). Knowledge and teaching: Foundations of the new reform. Harvard Educational Review, 57, 1-22.p.8&lt;/ref&gt; that guides the organization, representation and adaptation of the material for all learners through instruction. This concept goes beyond the consideration of the content knowledge as isolated from the pedagogical knowledge teachers must possess to effectively cater to the needs of their students. In order to illustrate how pedagogical content knowledge operates in reference to a specific [[knowledge domain]], we can turn to the field of [[second language teaching]]. In this field, pedagogical content knowledge can be considered a “developmental construct” &lt;ref name="Watzke, J. L. 2007"&gt;Watzke, J. L. (2007). "Foreign language pedagogical knowledge: Toward a developmental theory of beginning teacher practices". The Modern Language Journal. 91(1), 63 – 82.&lt;/ref&gt; initiated in pre-service teacher education programs and continued through in-service classroom experiences or “knowledge in action”.&lt;ref&gt;Schon, D. A. (1983). The Reflective Practitioner: How professionals think in action. New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt; From this perspective, it is useful to look at the various components. Pedagogical knowledge refers to the different instructional approaches and techniques used to teach languages as well as the consideration of how the linguistic knowledge progresses and grows in complexity along the continuum of a curriculum (i.e., Schulman’s lateral curricular knowledge). This pedagogical knowledge also involves a growing understanding of content choice and [[pedagogy]] that views language learning as communication, performance in tasks, student-centered instruction, attention to accuracy and message.&lt;ref name="Watzke, J. L. 2007"/&gt; On the other hand, if we were to characterize the content knowledge in language teaching, we would be talking about the [[Second language|target language]]. What it entails for the second language teacher is not only the mastery of the target language but also “discipline-derived understandings from [[applied linguistics]], SLA, [[psychology]] and curriculum development, among other areas, in a deeper examination of [the] subject matter -language- as it becomes classroom content”.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, D. &amp; Johnson, K. E. (1998). Reconceptualizing the Knowledge-Base of Language Teacher Education. TESOL Quarterly , 32 (3), 397-417. p. 413.&lt;/ref&gt; However, if we are to enhance the definition of the pedagogical content knowledge in [[second language teaching]], we need to include aspects related to language knowledge for teaching by following Schulman’s dimension of “subject matter knowledge for teaching”.&lt;ref&gt;Shulman, L.S. (1986). Those who understand: Knowledge growth in teaching. Educational
Researcher, 15(2), 4-2. p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; These aspects include language teachers’ use of effective ways to represent the various types of knowledge involved in learning a language &lt;ref name="Day"&gt;Day, R. (1993). Models and the knowledge base of second language teacher education.
University of Hawai‘i Working Papers in ESL, 11 (2), 1–13.&lt;/ref&gt; that include but are not limited to [[syntax]], [[semantics]], [[pragmatics]], and [[phonology]]. Besides it will require teachers to have a wide understanding of their language learners’ characteristics to be able to identify and explore the conceptions and misconceptions and, more importantly, “potential misunderstandings of [the] subject area” &lt;ref&gt;Grossman, P. L. (1988). A study in contrast: Sources of pedagogical content knowledge for secondary English. Unpublished doctoral dissertation, Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA.&lt;/ref&gt; these learners bring and/or develop in the learning situation. It also includes ways to help learners overcome these difficulties.&lt;ref name="Day" /&gt; For instance, Spanish speakers tend to omit subjects while learning a language with weak nominal features such as English, due to the fact that Spanish is predominantly a [[null subject language]].&lt;ref&gt;Montrul, S. (2004). Subject and object expression in Spanish Heritage speakers: a
case of morphosyntactic convergence. Bilingualism: Language and Cognition, 7. 125-142.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, this may turn into a source of overgeneralization while these learners learn the target language.  The two main aspects of pedagogical content knowledge presented here correspond to the two domains defined by Ball, Thames and Phelps &lt;ref&gt;Ball, D. L., Thames, M., and Phelps, G. (2008). Content knowledge for teaching: What makes it special? Journal of Teacher Education, 59(5), 389-407.&lt;/ref&gt; as knowledge of content and teaching as well as knowledge of content and students respectively. The consideration of all these components constitutes the pedagogical content knowledge language teachers need to possess to become effective practitioners.

==Time required==
A 1999 study of 50 years of second-language education at the [[United States Department of State]]'s [[Foreign Service Institute]] found that adult native speakers of English required 24 weeks or 600 classroom hours to achieve general proficiency ("3" on the [[Defense Language Proficiency Tests|DLPT]], or "Superior" rating on the [[ACTFL Proficiency Guidelines|ACTFL scale]]) in "Category I" closely [[cognate]] languages, such as French, Spanish, and Swedish. "Category II" languages such as Finnish, Russian, and Vietnamese required 44 weeks or 1,100 hours. The "Category III" languages Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean required 88 weeks with the second year in the language's country, or 2,200 hours.&lt;ref name="jackson1999"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://aladinrc.wrlc.org/bitstream/1961/3455/8/gurt_1999_07.pdf | title=Lessons learned from fifty years of theory and practice in  government language teaching |author1=Jackson, Frederick H. |author2=Kaplan, Marsha A. | journal=Georgetown University Round Table on Languages and Linguistics | year=1999 | pages=71–87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

E-Learning 2.0, by contrast to e-learning systems not based on CSCL, assumes that knowledge (as meaning and understanding) is [[Social constructionism|socially constructed]]. Learning takes place through conversations about content and [[Grounded theory|grounded]] interaction about problems and actions. Advocates of social learning claim that one of the best ways to learn something is to teach it to others.&lt;ref name="Minds on Fire" /&gt;

In addition to virtual classroom environments, social networks have become an important part of E-learning 2.0.&lt;ref&gt;Dunlap, J. C., &amp; Lowenthal, P. R. (2009). Horton hears a tweet. ''EDUCAUSE Quarterly, 32''(4). Retrieved from

Some feel, however, that schools have not caught up with the social networking trends. Few traditional educators promote social networking unless they are communicating with their own colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;Crane, Beverley E.

== Use of technology to practice speaking ==
Historically language learning in classrooms focused more on reading and writing than on speaking. The use of modern technology has made it more practical for second language learners to actually practice speaking. One approach is use a video-call technology such as [[Skype]] to pair off two students who wish to learn each other's native language.&lt;ref&gt;ERIC paper on [http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/search/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ846339&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=EJ846339 Skype and Podcasting: Disruptive Technologies for Language Learning]&lt;/ref&gt; One obvious advantage of using such technology is that there is no need for the two students to be geographically close. Though if they are in very different time-zones, finding a suitable time can be a challenge.&lt;br&gt;
Another approach is to use speech recognition software.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hstrik.ruhosting.nl/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/a102.pdf Automatic Speech Recognition for second language learning ] by A. Neri, C. Cucchiarini, W. Strik&lt;/ref&gt; In the past the hardware costs alone were so high that this was not a viable option in public schooling. However, in recent years as technology improved and prices fell, schools around the world introduced tablet computers to the classroom. And so the required computing power is already in the hands of an increasing number of children. One of the major advantages of using speech recognition software is that it can give feedback and so can be used to help improve pronunciation.

'''Silverpoint''' (one of several types of '''metalpoint''') is a traditional drawing technique first used by medieval scribes on manuscripts.

==History==
A silverpoint drawing is made by dragging a [[silver]] rod or wire across a surface, often prepared with [[gesso]] or [[Primer (paint)|primer]]. Silverpoint is one of several types of metalpoint used by scribes, craftsmen and artists since ancient times. Metalpoint styli were used for writing on soft surfaces (wax or bark), ruling and underdrawing on parchment, and drawing on prepared paper and panel supports. For drawing purposes, the essential metals used were [[lead]], [[tin]] and silver. The softness of these metals made them effective drawing instruments. (Watrous, 1957) [[Goldsmith|Goldsmiths]] also used metalpoint drawings to prepare their detailed, meticulous designs.  [[Albrecht Dürer]]'s father was one such craftsman who later taught his young son to draw in metalpoint, to such good effect that his 1484 ''[[Self-Portrait at the Age of 13]]'' is still considered a masterpiece.

In the late [[Gothic art|Gothic]]/early [[Renaissance]] era, silverpoint emerged as a fine line drawing technique. Not blunting as easily as lead or tin, and rendering precise detail, silverpoint was especially favored in Florentine and Flemish workshops. Silverpoint drawings of this era include model books and preparatory sheets for paintings. Artists who worked in silverpoint include [[Jan van Eyck]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]], Albrecht Dürer and [[Raphael]]. [[Cennino Cennini]]'s "Il Libro dell'Arte" provides a window on the practice of silver and leadpoint drawing, as well as preparing metalpoint grounds, in the late 14th century (Thompson, 1933; Duval, et al., 2004).  [[Susan Dorothea White]]'s book ''Draw Like da Vinci'' (2006) describes the silverpoint technique of Leonardo da Vinci.&lt;ref&gt;White, Susan D. (2006). ''Draw Like da Vinci''. London: Cassell Illustrated, pp.22-25, {{ISBN|9781844034444}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

As noted by Francis Ames-Lewis, drawing styles changed at the end of the 16th century, resulting in a decline for metalpoint. The discovery of [[graphite]] deposits at [[Seathwaite Fell|Seathwaite]] in [[Borrowdale]], [[Cumbria]], [[England]] in the early 1500s, and its increasing availability to artists in a pure, soft (and erasable) form hastened silverpoint's eclipse. Artists sought more gestural qualities, for which graphite, red and black chalk were better suited. Ink and wash drawings are also prevalent in the period. In addition, these other drawing techniques required less effort and were more forgiving than silver, which resists erasure and leaves a fainter line. Furthermore, the preparation of silverpoint supports, usually with hide glue with finely ground bone ash, was labor-intensive. Modern practitioners use [[zinc]], pre-prepared acrylic-based grounds or titanium white tempera or marble dust as a ground. Natural chalks and charcoal have the advantage of producing immediate results on uncoated papers (Ames-Lewis, 2000).

Dutch artists [[Hendrik Goltzius]] and [[Rembrandt]] maintained the silverpoint tradition into the 17th century, as it declined in other parts of Europe. Rembrandt made several silverpoints on prepared [[vellum]], the best-known being the portrait of his wife Saskia, 1633 (KdZ1152, Berlin). Botanical artists and architects continued to use metalpoint because of its exact lines. However, artists who continued this tradition of fine line drawing, such as [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres|J. A. D. Ingres]], turned to graphite, which gradually improved in quality and availability throughout Europe since the 17th century. Silverpoint was for practical purposes rendered obsolete by the 18th century (Reiche, 2005). There has however been a contemporary art revival among European and American artists and academies because the medium imposes considerable discipline in draughtsmanship since drawings cannot be erased or altered.

==Revival==
[[File:Artist's Wife, Edith Holman Hunt.jpg|thumb|''Artist's Wife, Edith Holman Hunt'' by [[William Holman Hunt]], a founding member of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. [[Birmingham Museum of Art]].]]
Joseph Meder (''Das Buchlein vom Silberstift'', 1909), [[Alphonse Legros]], the [[Pre-Raphaelites]] and [[Joseph Stella]] helped revitalize the technique. Art historian Meder created interest in the traditional technique in Austria and Germany, while artist and teacher Legros did likewise in England. In the early 20th century, Stella was one of the few American artists working in this method on the East Coast of the United States. Stella explored the technique on zinc white gouache prepared grounds, often with crayon and other media. Stella's silverpoint oevre includes the 1921 portrait of [[Marcel Duchamp]] (MoMA, Katherine S. Dreier Bequest) (Haskell, 1994). On the West Coast [[Xavier Martinez]], the Mexican-American artist who had studied in Paris at the [[École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts]] in the late 1890s during the resurgence of interest in silverpoint, taught this technique at the [[California College of the Arts]] from 1909 to the late 1930s.&lt;ref name="edwards"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Edwards|first1=Robert W.| title=Jennie V.

W-5; 27 February 1921, p.S-7.&lt;/ref&gt; 

An exhibit,  "The Fine Line: Drawing with Silver in America" was curated for the [[Norton Museum of Art]], in 1985 by [[Bruce Weber (photographer)|Bruce Weber]].

==Characteristics==
A traditional silverpoint stylus is made with a small fine rod of silver, such as [[jeweler's wire]], which is inserted into a wooden rod. Another design is a silver-tipped metal stylus with points on both ends. An example of this type is shown in [[Rogier van der Weyden]]'s ''St. Luke Drawing the Virgin,'' ca. 1435–40 (Boston Museum of Fine Arts). For a contemporary stylus, jeweler's wire may be inserted into a pin vise or mechanical pencil (Watrous, 1957).

The initial marks of silverpoint appear grey as other metalpoints, but silverpoint lines, when exposed to air, tarnish to a warm brown tone. The oxidation becomes perceptible over a period of several months. The speed of oxidation varies according to the level of pollution in the air. Historically, silverpoint styli ranged widely in composition from pure silver to heavily alloyed with copper (over 20% weight) (Duval, 2004; Reiche, 2004/2005; Watrous, 1957).

In the Middle Ages, metalpoint was used directly on parchment for the underdrawing of illuminated manuscripts or model books. On uncoated parchment (and paper), silverpoint is particularly light in value. However, since the 14th century, silverpoint was used more successfully on prepared supports. A traditional ground may be prepared with a rabbit skin glue solution pigmented with bone ash, chalk and/or lead white. Contemporary grounds include acrylic gesso, [[gouache]] and commercially prepared claycoat papers. The slight tooth of the ground preparation takes a little of the silver as it is drawn across the surface.

Silverpoint has encompassed a wide range of styles from Dürer's curvilinear precision to Rembrandt's gestural sketches. Silverpoint has also proven adaptable to modern styles. [[Thomas Wilmer Dewing]]'s late 19th Century silverpoint portraits are essentially tonal, as are [[Paula Gerard]]'s mid-20th-century abstract compositions. Gerard's "Vortex" (Fairweather Hardin Gallery) is an innovative combination of silverpoint, goldpoint and watercolor on casein-coated parchment (Weber, 1985).

Old Master silverpoints are typically intimate in scale, recalling the technique's roots in manuscript illumination. However, modern artists have also utilized this fine line technique for works on an increasingly large scale. [[John Wilde]]'s "The Great Autobiographical Silverpoint Drawing" (The Art Institute of Chicago 1986.8) which is 38 × 91", one of the largest modern silverpoints.

Silverpoint was also used in conjunction with other metal points by 20th-century artists.  [[Pedro Joseph de Lemos]], the Director of the [[San Francisco Art Institute]] from 1911 to 1917, popularized his “techniques” in California art schools with his published instructions on the easy fabrication of various types of metal points that would react with inexpensive coated paper.&lt;ref name="edwardsrw"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Edwards|first1=Robert W.| title=Pedro de Lemos, Lasting Impressions: Works on Paper| date=2015|publisher=Davis Publications Inc.| location=Worcester, Mass.|isbn=9781615284054|pages=62-63}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  In his ''The Last of the Old Woodstock Inn'', 1968 (The Art Institute of Chicago), [[Ivan Le Lorraine Albright]] used silver with platinum, gold, copper and brasspoint on commercially prepared video media paper. Contemporary artists continue to push the boundaries of this ancient drawing technique. Carol Prusa, for example, combines graphite and binder on acrylic hemispheres with metal leaf, video projection and fiber optics.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} [[Susan Schwalb]] has combined  smoke and fire in silver and copperpoints in the 1980s and currently creates drawings and paintings using numermous metals as well as acrylic paint.&lt;ref&gt;Weber, Bruce et al.

The different varieties of the [[Spanish language]] spoken in the [[Americas]] are distinct from [[Peninsular Spanish]] and Spanish spoken elsewhere, such as in Africa and Asia. Linguistically, this grouping is somewhat arbitrary, akin to having a term for "overseas English" encompassing variants spoken in the United States, Canada, Australia, India, New Zealand and Ireland, but not the Island of Britain. There is great diversity among the various Latin American vernaculars, and there are no traits shared by all of them which is not also in existence in one or more of the variants of Spanish used in Spain. A Latin American "standard" does, however, vary from the Castilian "standard" register used in television and notably the dubbing industry.
Of the more than [[Hispanosphere|469 million people]] who speak Spanish as their native language, more than 418 million are in [[Latin America]] and the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.personal.psu.edu/faculty/j/m/jml34/city.pdf  Lipski, J. "The role of the city in the formation of Spanish American dialect zones"]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are numerous regional particularities and idiomatic expressions within Spanish. In Latin American Spanish, [[loanword]]s directly from English are relatively more frequent, and often foreign spellings are left intact. One notable trend is the higher abundance of loan words taken from English in Latin America as well as words derived from English. The Latin American Spanish word for "computer" is ''computadora'', whereas the word used in Spain is ''ordenador'', and each word sounds foreign in the region where it is not used. Some differences are due to Iberian Spanish having a stronger French influence than Latin America, where, for geopolitical reasons, the United States influence has been predominant throughout the twentieth century.

Pronunciation varies from country to country and from region to region, just as English pronunciation varies from one place to another. In general terms, the speech of the Americas shows many common features akin to southern Spanish variants, especially to western Andalusia (Seville, Cádiz) and the [[Canarian Spanish| Canary Islands]]. Coastal language vernaculars throughout Hispanic America show particularly strong similarities to Atlantic-Andalusian speech patterns while inland regions in Mexico and Andean countries are not similar to any particular dialect in Spain.
*Most Spaniards pronounce {{angle bracket|z}} and {{angle bracket|c}} (before {{IPAslink|e}} and {{IPAslink|i}}) as {{IPAblink|θ}} (called ''[[distinción]]''). Conversely, most Hispanic Americans have ''[[seseo]]'', lacking a distinction between this phoneme and {{IPAslink|s}}. However, ''seseo'' is also typical of the speech of many [[Andalusian people|Andalusians]] and all [[Canarian people|Canary islanders]]. Andalusia's and the Canary Islands' predominant position in the conquest and subsequent immigration to Hispanic America from Spain is thought to be the reason for the absence of this distinction in most American Spanish dialects.
*Most of Spain, particularly the regions that have a distinctive {{IPAslink|θ}} phoneme, realize {{IPAslink|s}} with the tip of tongue against the alveolar ridge. Phonetically this is an [[voiceless alveolar retracted sibilant|"apico-alveolar" "grave" sibilant]] {{IPAblink|s̺}}, with a weak "hushing" sound reminiscent of {{lcons|retroflex}} fricatives. To a Hispanic American, Andalusian or Canary Island Spanish speaker the {{IPAslink|s}} in Spanish dialects from northern Spain might sound close to {{IPAblink|ʃ}} like English {{angbr|sh}} as in ''she''. However, this apico-alveolar realization of {{IPAslink|s}} is not uncommon in some Latin American Spanish dialects which lack {{IPAblink|θ}}; some inland Colombian Spanish (particularly Antioquia) and Andean regions of Peru and Bolivia also have an apico-alveolar {{IPAslink|s}}.
* As mentioned, Anglicisms are far more common in Hispanic America than in Spain, due to the stronger and more direct US influence.
* Equally, [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|indigenous languages]] have left their mark on Hispanic American Spanish, a fact which is particularly evident in vocabulary to do with flora, fauna and cultural habits. Nevertheless, European Spanish has also absorbed numerous words of Amerindian origin, although for historical reasons, the vast majority of these are taken from Nahuatl and various Caribbean languages.
* [[Arabic language|Arabic]]-derived words with Latinate doublets are common in Hispanic American Spanish, being influenced by Andalusian Spanish, such as ''alcoba'' ("bedroom") instead of standard ''cuarto'', ''recámara'', and many others and ''alhaja'' ("jewel") instead of standard ''joya''. In this sense Hispanic American Spanish is closer to the dialects spoken in the south of Spain.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}
* See [[Spanish dialects and varieties#Vocabulary|List of words having different meanings in Spain and Hispanic America]].
* Most Hispanic American Spanish usually features ''[[yeísmo]]'': there is no distinction between {{angbr|ll}} and {{angbr|y}}. However realization varies greatly from region to region. Chileans pronounce these 2 graphemes as {{angbr|j}}, for example. However, yeísmo is an expanding and now dominant feature of [[European Spanish]], particularly in urban speech (Madrid, Toledo) and especially in [[Andalusia]] and the [[Canary Islands]], though in some rural areas {{IPAblink|ʎ}} has not completely disappeared. Speakers of [[Rioplatense Spanish]] pronounce both {{angbr|ll}} and {{angbr|y}} as {{IPAblink|ʒ}} or {{IPAblink|ʃ}}. The traditional pronunciation of the digraph {{angbr|ll}} as {{IPAblink|ʎ}} is preserved in some dialects along the [[Andes]] range, especially in inland [[Peru]] and the [[Colombia]] highlands (Santander), northern Argentina, all [[Bolivia]] and [[Paraguay]].
*Most speakers of coastal dialects may [[debuccalization|debuccalize]] or [[aspiration (linguistics)|aspirate]] syllable-final {{IPAslink|s}} to {{IPAblink|h}}, or drop it entirely, so that ''está'' {{IPA-es|esˈta|}} ("s/he is") sounds like {{IPA|[ehˈta]}} or {{IPA|[eˈta]}}, as in southern Spain ([[Andalusia]], [[Extremadura]], [[Region of Murcia|Murcia]], [[Castile–La Mancha]] (except the northeast), [[Community of Madrid|Madrid]], the [[Canary Islands]], [[Ceuta]] and [[Melilla]]).
* {{angle bracket|g}} (before {{IPAslink|e}} or {{IPAslink|i}}) and {{angle bracket|j}} are usually [[aspiration (linguistics)|aspirated]] to {{IPAblink|h}} in Caribbean and other coastal language vernaculars, as well as in all of Colombia and southern Mexico, as in much of southern Spain. In other American dialects the sound is closer to {{IPAblink|x}}, and often firmly strong (rough) in Peruvian Spanish dialect. {{Citation needed|date=March 2016}} Very often, especially in Argentina and Chile, {{IPAblink|x}} becomes fronter {{IPAblink|ç}} when preceding high vowels {{IPA|/e, i/}} (these speakers approach {{IPAblink|x}} to the realization of [[ich-Laut|German {{angbr|ch}} in ''ich'']]); in other phonological environments it is pronounced either {{IPAblink|x}} or {{IPAblink|h}}.
*In many Caribbean varieties the phonemes {{IPAslink|l}} and {{IPAslink|r}} at the end of a syllable sound alike or can be exchanged: ''caldo'' &gt; ''ca[r]do'', ''cardo'' &gt; ''ca[l]do''; in the situation of {{IPAslink|r}} in word-final position, it becomes silent, giving Caribbean dialects of Spanish a partial [[rhotic and non-rhotic accents|non-rhoticity]]. This happens at a reduced level in Ecuador and Chile{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} as well. It is a feature brought from Extremadura and westernmost Andalusia.
*In many Andean regions the [[alveolar trill]] of ''rata'' and ''carro'' is realized as an [[alveolar approximant]] {{IPAblink|ɹ}} or even as a voiced apico-alveolar {{IPAblink|z}}. The alveolar approximant realization is particularly associated with an indigenous substrate and it is quite common in Andean regions, especially in inland Ecuador, Peru, most of Bolivia and in parts of northern Argentina and Paraguay.
*In Belize, Puerto Rico, and [[Archipelago of San Andrés, Providencia and Santa Catalina|Colombian islands of San Andrés, Providencia and Santa Catalina]], aside from {{IPAblink|ɾ}}, {{IPAblink|r}}, and {{IPAblink|l}}, syllable-final {{IPAslink|r}} can be realized as {{IPAblink|ɹ}}, an influence of [[American English]] to Puerto Rican dialect and [[British English]] to Belizean dialect and Colombian dialect of Archipelago of San Andrés, Providencia and Santa Catalina (in the case of the latter three, it is not exclusive to Colombians whose ancestors traced back to Spanish period before British invasion, under British territorial rule, and recovery of Spanish control, but is also used by [[Raizal]]s, whites of British descent, and descendants of mainland Colombians); ''"verso"''' (verse) becomes {{IPA|[ˈbeɹso]}}, aside from {{IPA|[ˈbeɾso]}}, {{IPA|[ˈberso]}}, or {{IPA|[ˈbelso]}}, "''invierno''" (winter) becomes {{IPA|[imˈbjeɹno]}}, aside from {{IPA|[imˈbjeɾno]}}, {{IPA|[imˈbjerno]}}, or {{IPA|[imˈbjelno]}}, and "''escarlata''" (scarlet) becomes {{IPA|[ehkaɹˈlata]}}, aside from {{IPA|[ehkaɾˈlata]}}, {{IPA|[ehkarˈlata]}}, or [{{IPA|ehkaˈlata}}]. In word-final position, {{IPAslink|r}} will usually be one of these:
** a trill, a tap, approximant, {{IPAblink|l}}, or elided when followed by a consonant or a pause, as in ''amo''{{IPA|[r ~ ɾ ~ ɹ ~ l]}} ''paterno'' 'paternal love', ''amor'' {{IPA|[aˈmo]}},
** a tap, approximant, or {{IPAblink|l}} when the followed by a vowel-initial word, as in ''amo''{{IPA|[ɾ ~ ɹ ~ l]}} ''eterno'' 'eternal love').
*The [[voice (phonetics)|voiced]] consonants {{IPAslink|b}}, {{IPAslink|d}}, and {{IPAslink|ɡ}} are pronounced as [[plosive]]s after and sometimes before any consonant in most of [[Colombian Spanish]] dialects (rather than the [[fricative consonant|fricative]] or [[approximant consonant|approximant]] that is characteristic of most other dialects):  ''pardo'' {{IPA|[ˈpaɾ'''d'''o]}}, ''barba'' {{IPA|[ˈbaɾ'''b'''a]}}, ''algo'' {{IPA|[ˈal'''ɡ'''o]}}, ''peligro'' {{IPA|[peˈli'''ɡ'''ɾo]}}, ''desde'' {{IPA|[ˈdez'''d'''e/ˈdeh'''d'''e]}}—rather than the {{IPA|[ˈpaɾ'''ð'''o]}}, {{IPA|[ˈbaɾ'''β'''a]}}, {{IPA|[ˈal'''ɣ'''o]}}, {{IPA|[peˈli'''ɣ'''ɾo]}}, {{IPA|[ˈdez'''ð'''e/ˈdeh'''ð'''e]}} of Spain and the rest of Spanish America. A notable exception is the [[Nariño Department|Department of Nariño]] and most [[Colombian Spanish#Caribbean dialect|''Costeño'' speech (Atlantic coastal dialects)]] which feature the soft, fricative realizations common to all other Hispanic American and European dialects.
*Word-final {{IPAslink|n}} is velar {{IPAblink|ŋ}} in much Latin American Spanish speech; this means a word like ''pan'' (bread) is often articulated {{IPA|['paŋ]}}. To an English-speaker, those speakers that have a velar nasal for word-final {{IPAslink|n}} make ''pan'' sound like ''pang''. Velarization of word-final {{IPAslink|n}} is so widespread in the Americas that it is easier to mention those regions that maintain an alveolar {{IPAslink|n}}: most of Mexico, Colombia (except for coastal dialects) and Argentina (except for some northern regions). Elsewhere, velarization is common, although alveolar word-final {{IPAslink|n}} can appear among some educated speakers, especially in the media or in singing. Velar word-final {{IPAslink|ŋ}} is also frequent in Spain, especially in southern Spanish dialects (Andalusia and the Canary Islands) and in the Northwest: Galicia, Asturias and León.

{{distinguish|text=the linguistic term [[sprachbund]]}}
A '''sprechbund''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|p|r|ɛ|k|b|ʊ|n|d}}; {{IPA-de|ˈʃpʁɛçbʊnt|lang}}, "[[speech]] bond") refers to "shared ways of speaking which go beyond language boundaries" (Romaine, 1994:23). Thus people speaking different [[language]]s can share certain linguistic characteristics.

This is a particularly useful concept for describing, for example, [[Hip hop music|hip-hop music]]. Hip-hop has a number of defining characteristics including musical style, clothing, and association with [[minority group|minorities]]. It also has a number of defining linguistic characteristics like [[rapping]], [[rhyme]] and [[beatboxing|human beatboxing]]. These are essentially linguistic features, but they can be used in any language – even [[genetic relatedness of languages|genetically unrelated]] languages. Their combined use in different languages allows a kind of universal "language of hip-hop".

The sprechbund is to be contrasted with the [[sprachbund]], which refers to "relatedness at the level of linguistic form" (Romaine 1994:23). A sprachbund (Norwegian ''{{Lang|no|språkknippe}}'') is a group of languages that have become structurally similar in some way because of geographical proximity. As the names suggest, sprechbund is about speech, and how language is produced; sprachbund is about the underlying structure of language.

The '''terminology of the British Isles''' refers to the various words and phrases that are used to describe the different (and sometimes overlapping) geographical and political areas of the islands of [[Great Britain]], [[Ireland]], and the smaller islands which surround them. The terminology is often a source of confusion, partly owing to the similarity between some of the actual words used, but also because they are often used loosely. In addition, many of the words carry both geographical and political connotations which are affected by the history of the islands. 

The purpose of this article is to explain the meanings of and relationships among the terms in use; however many of these classifications are contentious and are the subject of disagreement {{Crossreference|(See the [[British Isles naming dispute]])}}.

==Summary==
The use of terminology depends on context; words and phrases can generally be grouped into four main areas: geographical, political, linguistic and sporting terms. In brief&lt;!-- note that these are not intended to be full explanations of the terms; that is for later portions of the article --&gt;, the main terms and their simple explanations are as follows:

*Geographical terms:
**The [[British Isles]] is a group of islands in the [[Atlantic Ocean]] off the coast of [[Continental Europe]]. It includes [[Ireland]], [[Great Britain]], the [[Isle of Man]], [[Shetland]], [[Orkney]], and [[List of islands of the British Isles|thousands of smaller islands]]. Traditionally the [[Channel Islands]] are included, though these specific islands are geographically closer to mainland continental Europe, being positioned off the French coast of [[Normandy]]. This, in part, has resulted in the term being [[British Isles naming dispute|disputed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Alan | first1 = Lew |last2 = Colin |first2 = Hall |last3 = Dallen |first3 = Timothy |title = World Geography of Travel and Tourism: A Regional Approach |publisher=Elsevier |place = Oxford |year = 2008 |quote = The British Isles comprise more than 6,000 islands off the northwest coast of continental Europe, including the countries of the United Kingdom of Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) and Northern Ireland, and the Republic of Ireland. The group also includes the United Kingdom crown dependencies of the Isle of Man, and by tradition, the Channel Islands (the Bailiwicks of Guernsey and Jersey), even though these islands are strictly speaking an archipelago immediately off the coast of Normandy (France) rather than part of the British Isles. |isbn = 978-0-7506-7978-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Written Answers - Official Terms"&gt;"[http://www.oireachtas-debates.gov.ie/D/0606/D.0606.200509280360.html Written Answers – Official Terms"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121006211200/http://www.oireachtas-debates.gov.ie/D/0606/D.0606.200509280360.html |date=2012-10-06 }}, [[Dáil Éireann]], Volume 606, 28 September 2005. In his response, the Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs stated that "The British Isles is not an officially recognised term in any legal or inter-governmental sense. It is without any official status. The Government, including the Department of Foreign Affairs, does not use this term. Our officials in the Embassy of Ireland, London, continue to monitor the media in Britain for any abuse of the official terms as set out in the Constitution of Ireland and in legislation. These include the name of the State, the President, [[Taoiseach]] and others."&lt;/ref&gt;
*** '''[[Great Britain]]''' is the largest island of the [[archipelago]].&lt;ref&gt;"Britain", Oxford English Dictionary: "More fully Great Britain.  The term [[Great Britain]] includes [[England]], [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]]; it does not include [[Northern Ireland]]. As a geographical and political term: (the main island and smaller offshore islands making up) England, Scotland, and Wales, sometimes with the [[Isle of Man]]"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;New Oxford American Dictionary: "Britain: an island that consists of England, Wales, and Scotland. The name is broadly synonymous with Great Britain, but the longer form is more usual for the political unit."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Britain", Oxford English Dictionary (Online Edition): "Britain: 1a – The proper name of the whole island containing England, Wales, and Scotland, with their dependencies; more fully called Great Britain; now also used for the British state or empire as a whole."&lt;/ref&gt;
***'''[[Ireland]]''' is the second largest island of the archipelago and lies directly to the west of Great Britain. The island of Ireland itself has its own '''[[List of islands of Ireland|list of Irish Isles]]'''.
***The full '''[[list of islands of the British Isles]]''' includes over 6,000 islands,&lt;ref&gt;There are no official definitions, but Scotland has over 790 offshore islands – see {{cite book| author=Haswell-Smith, Hamish| year=2004| title=The Scottish Islands| location=Edinburgh| publisher=Canongate| isbn=1-84195-454-3}} plus numerous freshwater islands so a complete list of the British Isles would probably have between 1,000 and 2,000 entries.{{better source|date=February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; of which 51 have an area larger than {{convert|20|km2|abbr=on}}.
* Political terms:
** The '''[[United Kingdom|United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]]''' is the [[constitutional monarchy]] occupying the island of Great Britain, the small nearby islands (but not the Isle of Man or the Channel Islands), and the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland. Usually, it is shortened to ''United Kingdom'' or ''the UK'', though ''Britain''{{cn|date=June 2018}} is also an officially recognised short form.&lt;ref name="PCGN-uk-guide"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Permanent Committee on Geographical Names |title=Toponymic guidelines for the United Kingdom |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/toponymic-guidelines |website=gov.uk |publisher=UK Government |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Great Britain" is sometimes used as a short form, and is the name used by the UK in some international organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About BOA|url=http://www.teamgb.com/about-boa|publisher=British Olympic Authority|accessdate=28 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The abbreviation ''GB'' is frequently used for the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in international agreements, e.g. [[Universal Postal Union]] and [[Vienna Convention on Road Traffic|Road Traffic Convention]], as well as in the [[ISO 3166]] country codes (GB and GBR). "England" was also formerly used [[Synecdoche|synecdochically]] to refer to the whole United Kingdom, but this usage became rare early in the 20th century.
** '''[[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]''' is the sovereign republic occupying the larger portion of the island of Ireland. However, to distinguish the state from the island, or to distinguish either of these from [[Northern Ireland]], it is also called "the Republic of Ireland" or simply "the Republic". Occasionally, its [[Irish language|Irish-language]] name, ''[[Éire]]'' (or ''Eire'' without the diacritic), will be used in an English-language context to distinguish it from "Northern Ireland", even though the word ''Éire'' directly translates as "Ireland".
**[[England]], [[Scotland]], [[Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]] are the four [[countries of the United Kingdom]], though they are also referred to, especially in sporting contexts, as the [[home nations]] of the United Kingdom.
**[[England and Wales]], Scotland, and Northern Ireland are legal jurisdictions within the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="walesjurisdiction"&gt;Though the [[Contemporary Welsh Law#Wales as a jurisdiction|statute law applicable in Wales]] has diverged further from that applicable in England since devolution from the UK government to the [[National Assembly for Wales]], "England and Wales" remains a single jurisdiction.&lt;/ref&gt;
**[[Great Britain#Political definition|Great Britain]] means the countries of England, Wales and Scotland considered as a unit.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;"Great Britain", New Oxford American Dictionary: "Great Britain: England, Wales, and Scotland considered as a unit. The name is also often used loosely to refer to the United Kingdom."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.number-10.gov.uk/output/Page823.asp |title=Countries within a country |publisher=Number-10.gov.uk |date=2003-01-10 |accessdate=2010-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
**[[British Islands]] consists of the United Kingdom, the [[Channel Islands]] and the [[Isle of Man]]. These are the [[Polity|polities]] within the British Isles that have the [[British monarch]] as head of state.
*Linguistic terms:
**The two [[sovereign states]] in the region, the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], are frequently referred to as ''countries''. So too are [[England]], [[Wales]], [[Scotland]] and, to a lesser extent, [[Northern Ireland]] (as is the whole [[island of Ireland]]).
**British is an adjective pertaining to the United Kingdom; for example, a [[citizen]] of the UK is called a [[British citizen]]—but for citizenship purposes "British" includes the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man.
**[[Anglo-]] is often used as an adjectival prefix referring to the United Kingdom (notwithstanding that its original meaning is "English") particularly in the field of diplomatic relations.  It can also refer to the English language, to anglophone peoples and can have a variety of other shades of meaning.
**Wales is sometimes called the ''[[Principality of Wales]]'', although this has no modern constitutional basis.
**Northern Ireland is often referred to as a ''province'' or called ''Ulster'', after the [[Provinces of Ireland|traditional Irish province]] of [[Ulster]] within which it is located.
*Sport
**Forms of national representation vary from sport to sport. England, Scotland and Wales often compete separately as ''nations''.&lt;ref name="worldpeoples"&gt;{{citation|title=World and Its Peoples|publisher=Marshall Cavendish Corporation|location=Terrytown (NY)|year=2010|quote=In most sports, except soccer, Northern Ireland participates with the Republic of Ireland in a combined All-Ireland team.|page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some sports—such as [[rugby football|rugby]] and [[cricket]]—the island of Ireland competes as a nation; in others, most notably [[association football]], Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland field separate teams. In these contexts England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland/Northern Ireland  are sometimes described as ''the [[home nations]]''.
**[[Rugby union]] players from both Ireland and Great Britain play for [[British and Irish Lions]] representing the four "Home Unions" of [[Rugby Football Union|England]], [[Irish Rugby Football Union|Ireland]], [[Scottish Rugby Union|Scotland]] and [[Welsh Rugby Union|Wales]].
**[[Great Britain]] is sometimes used to mean [[United Kingdom]].  For example, at the [[Olympic Games]], the team called "Great Britain" represents Great Britain and Northern Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.olympics.org.uk/contentpage.aspx?page=127 British Olympic Association, Team GB] retrieved 2 Jan. 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Irishand"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/olympics_2004/olympics_2012/3433557.stm 'Irish and GB in Olympic row' BBC Sport 27 January, 2004] retrieved 1 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  However, athletes from Northern Ireland have, by virtue of their entitlement to dual nationality, the choice of participating in either the Great Britain team or the Republic of Ireland team.&lt;ref name="Irishand" /&gt;
**In the majority of individual sports (e.g. [[tennis]] and [[athletics (sport)|athletics]]), at international level competitors are identified as GB if they are from Great Britain or Northern Ireland. A small number of sports (e.g. [[golf]], [[darts]], [[snooker]]) identify participants as representing their constituent country. In the [[Commonwealth Games]], England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales each compete as separate nations, as do each of the three Crown Dependencies (Ireland is not part of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] and is not eligible to participate).

==Terminology in detail==

*'''[[Britain (name)|Britain]]''' is a political and geographic term which can refer to the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]],&lt;ref name="num10"&gt;"the term 'Britain' is used informally to mean the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland"&amp;nbsp;— quote from [http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20080909013512/http://www.number10.gov.uk/Page823 British Government website]&lt;/ref&gt; or the island of [[Great Britain]].
*'''[[Great Britain]]''' is the [[List of islands by area|largest island]] in Europe and the [[political union]] of three nations, these being:

:::*'''[[England]]''' (see also the historical [[Kingdom of England]]).
:::*'''[[Wales]]''' (see also the historical [[Principality of Wales]]).
::*'''[[Scotland]]''' (see also the historical [[Kingdom of Scotland]])

:*The historical '''[[Kingdom of Great Britain]]''' is Britain for the period 1707–1801.
:*'''Britannia''' is the [[Roman Britain|Roman province of Britain]], or a poetic reference to later Britain, or a [[Britannia|personification of Britain]].
*The '''[[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]]''', usually shortened to the '''United Kingdom''' (abbreviation '''UK'''),&lt;ref name="PCGN-uk-guide"/&gt; is the [[sovereign state]] comprising [[Great Britain#Political definition|Great Britain]] plus '''Northern Ireland''' since 1927. (The Partition of Ireland took place in 1922, but the consequent change in the official title of the UK was only made by Act of Parliament five years later.) The [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]] is often shortened to  '''Britain''', even on official websites,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Gtgl1/GuideToGovernment/AboutBritain/index.htm |title=UK Government's "Guide to Government" |publisher=Direct.gov.uk |accessdate=2010-06-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070714142445/http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Gtgl1/GuideToGovernment/AboutBritain/index.htm |archivedate=July 14, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/lib2000/index.html |title=Office for National Statistics |publisher=Statistics.gov.uk |accessdate=2010-06-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091005160325/http://www.statistics.gov.uk/lib2000/index.html |archivedate=2009-10-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; where such use is described as "informal".&lt;ref name="dgov-keyfacts"&gt;{{cite web |title=Key facts about the United Kingdom |url=http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Governmentcitizensandrights/LivingintheUK/DG_10012517 |website=Directgov |publisher=British Government |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20121003003526/http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Governmentcitizensandrights/LivingintheUK/DG_10012517 |dead-url=yes |archivedate=3 October 2012 |date=3 October 2012 |quote='Britain' is used informally, usually meaning the United Kingdom.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="num10"/&gt; A proposal to rename the political entity as the "[[Alternative names for Northern Ireland|United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ulster]]" was formally recommended by civil servants to the Cabinet in 1949 but ultimately rejected.&lt;ref&gt;British Archives, Catalogue Reference:CAB/129/32 (Memorandum by PM Attlee to Cabinet appending Working Party Report); Quoted at length on the [[Alternative names for Northern Ireland]] page.&lt;/ref&gt;
:*The historical '''[[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]]''' was [[Great Britain#Political definition|Great Britain]] plus [[Ireland]], for the period 1801 to 1922, although the name change after the secession of the Irish Free State only took place in 1927.
:N.B.: While "United Kingdom" is normally abbreviated '''UK''', the official [[ISO 3166]] two-letter country code is '''GB''' and the three letter code is '''GBR''' ([[Ukraine]] has the two letter code UA and the three letter code UKR). Due to a pre-existing convention originating in the UK's [[JANET]] academic computer network,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mech-eng.leeds.ac.uk/www_vms/mail_changes.html "Electronic Mail address changes"] On the transition form big-endian to little-endian notation (Dept of Mechanical Engineering, The University of Leeds&lt;/ref&gt; the UK's [[Country code top-level domain|Internet top-level domain]] is '''[[.uk]]''', a break from the [[TCP/IP]] practice of following ISO 3166 (a '''[[.gb]]''' domain has also been used to a limited extent in the past but is now defunct). '''GB''' is also used on car number plates to indicate the United Kingdom.

*'''[[Ireland]]'''  (in [[Irish language|Irish]], '''''Éire''''') refers, geographically, to the island of Ireland, or to any of the following:
&lt;!-- on this line, the only valid wikilink for Éire is to the page on ga:wiki.  But see the political context below.  --&gt;
:''Historically:''
:*The '''[[Kingdom of Ireland]]'''  was Ireland for the period 1541–1801. (The [[King of Ireland]] remained Head of State in the Irish Free State and Ireland/Éire until the [[Republic of Ireland Act 1948]] abolished that status).
:*The '''[[Irish Republic]]''', established by the [[Irish Declaration of Independence]], was a 32-county republic encompassing the entire island, during the period 1919–22—though its ''de facto'' rule did not encompass all of the island. During this period, according to British law, Ireland remained part of the UK though its independence was recognised by [[Russia]].
:*'''[[Southern Ireland (1921–22)|Southern Ireland]]''' was a  proposed [[Home Rule]] 26-county state under the [[Government of Ireland Act 1920]]. It never came into practical existence, being superseded by:
:*The '''[[Irish Free State]]''' is Ireland excepting Northern Ireland during the period 1922–37.
:''Present'':
:*'''Ireland''' (in [[Irish language|Irish]], ''[[Éire]]'') is the political entity consisting of the island of Ireland excepting Northern Ireland, 1937–present. This is the name of the state according to the [[Constitution of Ireland|Irish Constitution]] and the United Nations.
:*The '''[[Republic of Ireland]]''' is a commonly used description of Ireland excepting Northern Ireland, 1949–present. It is also the name used by the international [[Association Football]] team.
::The terms ''Irish Republic'', ''Southern Ireland'', the ''Irish Free State'', the ''Free State'', the ''26 Counties'' and ''Éire'' (in English-language texts) have been used synonymously with the ''Republic of Ireland''. Of these, ''Southern Ireland'' and ''Irish Free State'', in particular, are seen as outdated. "Eire" (spelt without the Irish ''[[Acute accent|fada]]'') was the British legal spelling from the [[Eire (Confirmation of Agreements) Act 1938]] until the [[Ireland Act 1949]], and informally for some years after.
:*'''[[Northern Ireland]]''' 1922–present. That part of the island of Ireland northeast of the line of partition of 1922, and which is still part of the United Kingdom. [[Alternative names for Northern Ireland|Various alternative names]] have been used or proposed for Northern Ireland. It is sometimes referred to as "the North of Ireland", "the Six Counties" or (in extremist usage) the "occupied six counties", especially by [[Irish Nationalism|Irish Nationalists]].
:*'''[[Ulster]]'''. The name of one of Ireland's four traditional [[Provinces of Ireland|provinces]]. The area contains nine northern counties, six of which make up [[Northern Ireland]], and three of which are part of the [[Republic of Ireland]]. It is also often used by [[Unionism in Ireland|Unionists]] to refer to the smaller [[Northern Ireland]]. Though [[Ulster]] has not been a political entity since the ancient Gaelic provincial kingdoms, it remains associated with a geographical area and is used in sporting and cultural contexts. See [[Ulster (disambiguation)]].
:''In sport''
:*In [[Gaelic games]], no distinction is recognised between the [[GAA county|GAA counties]] of the Republic and those of Northern Ireland. County teams play in their provincial championships (where the six counties of Ulster within Northern Ireland and three within the Republic all play in the Ulster championship) and the winners of these play in the All-Ireland championship. Even within Northern Ireland, a tricolour, the [[Flag of Ireland|flag of the Republic of Ireland]], is flown at all games. At bigger games, where an anthem is played, it is always [[Amhrán na bhFiann|the national anthem of the Republic]]. In the case of the [[International rules football|International Rules]] series against [[Australia international rules football team|Australia]], an Irish national team is chosen from all 32 counties.
:*In Association Football, the teams correspond to political entities: Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. In accordance with [[UEFA]] and [[FIFA]]'s rules, each of these countries has its own football league: the [[Irish Football League|Irish League]] and the [[League of Ireland]] respectively.
:*In [[rugby union]], [[rugby league]], [[field hockey]], [[cricket]], [[boxing]], [[golf]], [[athletics (sport)|athletics]] and others  the ''Ireland'' team is drawn from the whole island (i.e. both the Republic and Northern Ireland). Many sports organisations are subdivided along provincial lines e.g. [[Gaelic Athletic Association]], [[golf]].
*The '''[[British Isles]]''' is a term used to mean the island of Great Britain plus the island of Ireland and many smaller surrounding islands, including the [[Isle of Man]] and, in some contexts, the [[Channel Islands]] ([[Guernsey]] and [[Jersey]]). See [[British Isles naming dispute]] for details of the conflict over use of this term.
*''Great Britain and Ireland'', or variants like "Britain and Ireland" or "The UK and Ireland" are sometimes used as alternatives to the term [[British Isles]].
*'''Anglo-Celtic Isles''' is an alternative term (in limited use) for the geographic region comprising Britain &amp; Ireland, more commonly referred to as the 'British Isles'. 'Anglo-Celtic Islands' is a derivative of this. It is intended as a geographic term free of any political implication and uses the macro-cultural grouping term [[Anglo-Celtic]], referring to the peoples from which the majority of the island group's population are descended—the [[Anglo-Saxons]] and the [[Celt]]s (it can also be inclusive of the [[Anglo-Normans]]).
*'''[[Islands of the North Atlantic]]''' is another suggested replacement term for 'British Isles', without the same political connotations. However, its convolution and impracticality due to implying inclusion of fellow North Atlantic islands such as Iceland have made it unworkable and it has not come into common use. The term was used as part of the Strand 3 level of negotiations for the Belfast agreement. (Its acronym, IONA, is also the name of the small but historically important island of [[Iona]] off the coast of Scotland.)
*'''[[British Islands]]''' (a legal term not in common usage) is the UK, the Isle of Man, and the Channel Islands.
*'''[[Brittany]]''', itself a corruption of 'Britain', and sometimes formerly known as 'Little Britain' is a historical [[Duchy]] in the West of [[France]], now a French region; for this modern administrative sense, see [[Brittany (administrative region)]].

==Geographical distinctions==

===The British Isles===
{|
|-
| [[File:British Isles all.svg|50px]]
|
The [[British Isles]] is a group of islands in the [[Atlantic Ocean]] off the coast of [[Continental Europe]]. It includes [[Ireland]], [[Great Britain]], the [[Isle of Man]], [[Shetland]], [[Orkney]], and [[List of islands of the British Isles|thousands of smaller islands]]. Traditionally the [[Channel Islands]], are included, however these specific islands are geographically part of mainland continental Europe, as they are positioned off the French coast of Normandy. The term is disputed (see [[British Isles naming dispute]]).
|}

====Great Britain====
{|
|-
| [[File:Great Britain.svg|50px]]
| [[Great Britain]] is the largest of the British Isles. On Great Britain are located three constituent countries of the United Kingdom: [[Scotland]] in the north, [[England]] in the south and east and [[Wales]] in the west. There are also [[List of islands of the British Isles|numerous smaller islands]] off its coast (''not'' coloured red on the attached map) that are administered as part of England, Scotland and Wales.  The inclusion of these smaller islands means political 'Great Britain' covers a slightly larger area than the island of Great Britain.
|}

====Ireland====
{|
|-
| [[File:Island of Ireland.svg|50px]]
| The second largest island in the group is [[Ireland]]. Most of the island is in the [[Republic of Ireland]]. The north east of the island ([[Northern Ireland]]) is part of the [[United Kingdom]]. There are also [[List of islands of Ireland|numerous smaller islands]] off the coast of Ireland.
|}

====Isle of Man====
{|
|-
| [[File:British Isles Isle of Man.svg|50px]]
| The [[Isle of Man]] lies between Great Britain and Ireland. It is governed as a British [[Crown dependency]], having its own parliament, but with the United Kingdom responsible for its defence and external relations.
|}

====Channel Islands====
{|
|-
| [[File:British Isles Channel Islands.svg|50px]]
| Although the [[Channel Islands]] are associated with the United Kingdom politically as [[Crown dependencies]], they are geographically an outcrop of the nearby French mainland (specifically, the [[Armorican massif]]), and historically they are the last remaining parts of the [[Duchy of Normandy]], the Duke of Normandy being a title belonging to the British monarch.

==Political terms in more detail==

===The United Kingdom===
[[File:United Kingdom in the British Isles.svg|left|80px]]
[[File:British passport 2002.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|A UK passport]]
''The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland'' is the official full title of the state. This name appears on official documentation such as [[British passport]]s. For convenience, the name is usually shortened to ''United Kingdom'', ''UK'' or ''Britain''.&lt;ref name="PCGN-uk-guide"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dgov-keyfacts"/&gt;

The '''United Kingdom''' is a [[sovereign state]]. Its four [[Countries of the United Kingdom|constituent countries]] are sometimes considered to be of different status. This view may be supported by the existence of [[Devolution|devolved]] governments with different levels of power in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales (see [[Asymmetrical federalism]]).

Wales is also often erroneously&lt;ref name="Wales FAQ page"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wales.com/en/content/cms/FAQs|title=Wales FAQ Page|publisher=Wales.com|accessdate=2011-07-03|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110414171808/http://www.wales.com/en/content/cms/faqs/|archivedate=2011-04-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; described as a [[principality]] of the United Kingdom. The title of [[Prince of Wales]] is usually given to the [[heir apparent]] to the [[British throne]] but it has no political or other role in respect of Wales. The [[International Organization for Standardisation]] (ISO) has defined Wales as a "country" rather than a "principality" since 2011, following a recommendation by the [[British Standards Institute]] and the [[Welsh Government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/international-body-grants-wales-country-1813629|title=International body grants Wales country status after principality error|date=1 August 2011|work=WalesOnline|accessdate=4 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Northern Ireland]] is sometimes described by [[United Kingdom]] citizens as a [[province]] of the United Kingdom, which derives from the Irish [[Provinces of Ireland|province]] of [[Ulster]], of which [[Northern Ireland]] is a part. Northern Ireland also had, until 1972, a far greater degree of [[self-government]] than the other constituent parts of the UK.

''Great Britain'' is both a geographical and a political entity. Geographically, it is one island, but [[Great Britain#Political definition|as a political entity]] it also includes the smaller offshore islands that are administered as part of its constituent nations – England, Wales and Scotland – such as England's [[Isle of Wight]], Wales' [[Anglesey]] and Scotland's [[Inner Hebrides]], [[Outer Hebrides]], [[Orkney Islands]] and [[Shetland Islands]].

The abbreviation ''GB'' is sometimes officially used for the United Kingdom, for example in the [[Olympic Games|Olympics]], or as the [[vehicle registration plate#International codes|vehicle registration plate]] [[List of international license plate codes|country identification code]] for UK-registered cars ''(see also [[British car number plates]])''. ''SCO'' in Scotland, ''CYM'' for Wales (Cymru), ''NI'' for Northern Ireland, or ''ENG'' for England can also be used.&lt;ref name="numberplates"&gt;{{cite news
|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/1731653.stm
|title=Flag day for patriotic drivers
|date=2001-12-28
|accessdate=2007-10-22
|author=BBC News
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[internet code]] ''[[.gb]],'' although allocated to the UK, is virtually unused and UK web domains use ''[[.uk]]''.

The four constituent parts of the UK are also known, particularly in sporting contexts, as ''[[Home Nations]]'' or the "Four Nations". The BBC refers to its UK-wide broadcasting operation as ''Nations and Regions'' &lt;ref name="bbcnations"&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/keyfacts/stories/nationsregions.shtml
|title=BBC Nations &amp; Regions
|author=BBC Press Office
}}&lt;/ref&gt; ("regions" referring to geographic regions of England. Thus the UK naming conventions tend towards describing distinct ''regions'' or ''nations'' which exist within a single sovereign ''state''.

In sport, the UK Nations mostly have their own separate national teams – England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland, for example in [[football (soccer)|football]]. Sporting contests between the Four Nations are known as "Home internationals" (an example is the [[British Home Championship]] in football).

The governing body for football in Northern Ireland is called the [[Irish Football Association]] (the IFA), having been in existence since some forty years before [[Partition of Ireland|Partition]]. Its counterpart in the Republic (plus [[Derry City FC]]) is the [[Football Association of Ireland]] (the FAI). The [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland national team]] retained the name "Ireland" for some fifty years after partition. Since around 1970 the two teams have been consistently referred to as "Northern Ireland" and "[[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]]" respectively. The UK competes as Great Britain at the Olympic Games. According to the Olympic Charter the Olympic Council of Ireland represents the entire island of Ireland.&lt;ref name="olympicrow"&gt;{{cite news
|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/olympics_2004/olympics_2012/3433557.stm

|accessdate=2013-05-02
|author=BBC News
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Olympic athletes from Northern Ireland may choose whether to represent the UK or the [[Republic of Ireland]].

Since the [[Good Friday Agreement]] and the subsequent implementation legislation, sporting organisation (and several other organisations, e.g. [[Tourism in Ireland|tourism]], [[Irish Gaelic]] and [[Ulster Scots dialects|Ulster Scots]] language boards) on the island of Ireland has increasingly been cross-border.

Citizens of the UK are called ''British'', ''Brits'', ''Britons'' or ''Britisher'' (archaic). The term ''Unionists'' may also be used, sometimes [[pejoratively]], for example by supporters of [[Scottish independence]] when referring to supporters of the [[Acts of Union 1707|Union]]. Some older slang names for Britons are ''Tommy'' (for British soldiers) and ''Anglo''. [[Anglo]] properly refers only to England, but it is sometimes used as a broader reference as an element in compound adjectives: for example, "Anglo-French relations" may be used in newspaper articles when referring to relations between the political entities [[France]] and the United Kingdom. ''Anglo-Saxon'' may be used (particularly in Continental European languages) when referring to the whole [[English-speaking world]].

===Ireland===
{{Main article|Names of the Irish state}}
[[File:Republic of Ireland.svg|left|80px]]
[[File:Eirepas.JPG|thumb|upright=0.6|An Irish passport]]
Since the adoption of the [[Constitution of Ireland]] in 1937, '''[[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]''' has been the [[English (language)|English]] name of the state which covers approximately five-sixths of the island of [[Ireland]]. The name '''[[Éire]]''' is used when writing in [[Irish (language)|Irish]].

Since the [[Republic of Ireland Act 1948]], the term "Republic of Ireland" is the term used as the additional ''description'' of the state. This term is useful in avoiding ambiguity between the name of the island and the name of the state.  However, the term "Ireland" is always used in formal diplomatic contexts such as the [[European Union]] or the [[United Nations]]. The passport of the Republic of Ireland bears the name ''Éire – Ireland''.

Before the introduction of the 1937 constitution and the new name, the [[Irish Free State]] occupied the same territory as the modern state of Ireland. The Irish Free State became an autonomous [[dominion]] of the [[British Empire]] in 1922 when it seceded from the United Kingdom through the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]]. The King ceased to be its Head of State [[Executive Authority (External Relations) Act 1936|in 1936]] and the state ceased to be a Dominion and left the Commonwealth [[Republic of Ireland Act 1948|in 1948]].

Traditionally, the island of Ireland is divided into four [[Provinces of Ireland|province]]s – [[Leinster]], [[Connacht]], [[Munster]] and [[Ulster]], with each of the provinces further divided into counties. The Republic of Ireland takes up 83% of the island, twenty-six of the thirty-two traditional counties of Ireland. Northern Ireland takes up the remaining area, six of the traditional nine counties of Ulster.

On the island of Ireland the naming of places often raises political issues. The usage of "Ireland" as the [[Constitution of Ireland|official name]] of the state causes offence to some [[unionists (Ireland)|Unionists]] in [[Northern Ireland]], who believe it implies that the state [[Nineteenth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|still]] has a territorial claim to the whole island – the terminology of "Republic of Ireland" or "[[Éire]]" is much preferred by Northern Irish unionists when referring to that political state. Similarly, some [[Nationalists (Ireland)|Nationalists]] in Northern Ireland also prefer to reserve the usage of "Ireland" to refer to the whole island.

In Northern Ireland, Irishness is a highly contested identity, with fundamentally different perceptions of national identity between unionists (who generally perceive themselves as being British) and nationalists (who generally consider both communities to be part of the Irish nation).&lt;ref&gt;[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/dd/report7/report7c.htm CAIN: Democratic Dialogue: With all due respect – pluralism and parity of esteem (Report No. 7)] by Tom Hennessey and Robin Wilson, Democratic Dialogue (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Republic of Ireland is often referred to by the [[Irish nationalists|Nationalist]] and [[Irish Republicans|Republican]] communities by the term "the Twenty-six Counties", with the connotation that the state constituted as such forms only a portion of the ideal political unit of the [[Irish Republic]], which would consist of all of the [[Counties of Ireland|thirty-two counties]] into which the island is divided.  The term "the Six Counties" (of Northern Ireland) is also used. Other Nationalist terms in use include "the North of Ireland" and "the North". These latter are terms also used by the Irish national broadcaster [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}  More extreme terms for Northern Ireland include "the occupied six counties" or "occupied Ireland", which are often used by people who reject the idea of Northern Ireland as a separate entity from the Republic of Ireland.

The [[Irish passport]] is available to Irish citizens and can also be applied for abroad through Irish Consular services and the local Irish Embassy. As per the [[Irish nationality law]], any person born on the island of Ireland before 2005, or otherwise a first generation descendant of such a person, is allowed to apply for an Irish passport. As such, people born in Northern Ireland and their children may be Irish citizens and hold an Irish passport if they choose.

===British Islands===
[[File:British Islands.svg|left|80px]]
[[File:Jersey passport new.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|A Jersey passport]]
Under the Interpretation Act 1978 of the United Kingdom, the legal term '''''British Islands''''' (as opposed to the geographical term ''British Isles'') refers to the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]], together with the [[Crown dependencies]]: the [[Bailiwick]]s of [[Jersey]] and of [[Guernsey]] (which in turn includes the smaller islands of [[Alderney]], [[Herm]] and [[Sark]]) in the [[Channel Islands]]; and the [[Isle of Man]].

Special British passports are issued to citizens of the Crown dependencies. On the front of passports issued to residents of the Crown dependencies, the words ''"United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland"'' are replaced with ''"British Islands"'' followed by the name of the issuing state or island. This design applies to [[Jersey passport]], [[Guernsey passport]] and [[Isle of Man passport]].  Like UK passports, Crown dependency also bear the title ''"European Union"'' for customs purposes. However, Crown dependency citizens who have no family ties to the United Kingdom are granted a special limited "Islander Status" under EU law (article 6 of Protocol 3 in the [[Treaty of Accession 1972|Treaty of Accession of the UK to the European Community]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gov.gg/article/2822/What-is-Islander-status|title=What is Islander status?  |year=2013  |website=States of Guernsey  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131007233859/http://www.gov.gg/article/2822/What-is-Islander-status  |archivedate= 7 October 2013  |deadurl=yes  |accessdate=8 December 2017  |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jersey|first1=States of|title=Islander status and your right to live and work in Europe|url=https://www.gov.je/Travel/Passports/ApplyFirstAdult/Pages/islanderstatus.aspx|website=www.gov.je|accessdate=8 December 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171208112536/https://www.gov.je/Travel/Passports/ApplyFirstAdult/Pages/islanderstatus.aspx|archivedate=8 December 2017|language=en|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical aspects==
{{Further information|Britain (name)}}
Some suggest an early known  for the term might be  from [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] writings. Though some of the original texts have been lost, excerpts were quoted or paraphrased by later authors. Parts of the [[Massaliote Periplus]], a merchants' handbook describing searoutes of the sixth century BC, were used in translation in the writings of [[Avienus]] around AD 400. Ireland was referred to as ''Ierne'' (''Insula sacra'', the ''sacred island'', as the Greeks interpreted it) "inhabited by the race of ''Hiberni''" (''gens hiernorum''), and Britain as ''insula Albionum'', "island of the [[Albion]]s".&lt;ref name=snyder&gt;{{cite book

Greek writers called the peoples of these islands the {{lang|grc|Πρεττανοί}}, later {{lang|grc|Bρεττανοί}} (alternative spellings of this and of all relative words have a single [[tau]] or a double [[Nu (letter)|nu]]), a name that possibly corresponds to the ''[[Priteni]]''.&lt;ref name=snyder/&gt; These names may have derived from a "[[Celtic languages|Celtic language]]" term which may have reached Pytheas from the [[Gaul]]s&lt;ref name=ohi/&gt; who may have used it as their term for the inhabitants of the islands.

The Romans called the inhabitants of Gaul (modern [[France]]) ''Galli'' or ''Celtae'', the latter term deriving from the Greek name {{lang|grc|Κελτοί}} for a central European people.  Antiquarians of the seventeenth century who found language connections developed the idea of a race of [[Celt]]s inhabiting the islands, but this term was not used by the Greeks or Romans for the inhabitants of Britain or Ireland,&lt;ref name=ece&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.walespast.com/article.shtml?id=36 |title=The earliest Celts in Europe |publisher=WalesPast |accessdate=2010-06-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041011133701/http://www.walespast.com/article.shtml?id=36 |archivedate=2004-10-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; nor is there any record of the inhabitants of the British Isles referring to themselves as such. Nevertheless, Roman administration later incorporated the province of Britannia into the [[praetorian prefecture of Gaul]], in common with Hispania, which had Celtiberians. [[Armorica]], where the Bretons would settle{{when|date=June 2014}}, was part of ''Gallia Celtica'', so there were tertiary relations between the Britons and Gallic Celts at least. In addition, the [[Parisii (Gaul)|Parisii]] of Gallia Celtica are thought to have founded Aldborough in Britain. [[Belgae]] and [[Silures]] also came from Gallic areas, although not strictly "Celtic", but from ''Gallia Belgica'' and ''Aquitainia''.

''Priteni'' is the source of the [[Welsh language]] term [[Prydain]], ''Britain'',&lt;ref name=ohi/&gt; and has the same source as the [[Goidelic languages|Goidelic]] term [[Cruithne (people)|Cruithne]]. The latter referred to the early [[Brythonic languages|Brythonic]] speaking inhabitants of the [[Scottish highlands]] and the north of Scotland,&lt;ref name=ohi/&gt; who are known as the Cruithne in [[Scottish Gaelic]], and who the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] called [[Picts]] or [[Caledonians]].

===Romans===
[[File:Roman britain 400.jpg|thumb|Roman Britain in 410]]
[[Caesar's invasions of Britain]] brought descriptions of the peoples of what he called ''Britannia pars interior'', "inland Britain", in 55 BC. Throughout Book 4 of his ''Geography'', [[Strabo]] is consistent in spelling the island Britain (transliterated) as ''Prettanikē''; he uses the terms ''Prettans'' or ''Brettans'' loosely to refer to the islands as a group – a common generalisation used by classical geographers. For example, in Geography 2.1.18, ''…οι νοτιώτατοι των Βρεττανών βορειότεροι τούτων εισίν'' ("…the most southern of the Brettans are further north than this").&lt;ref name="Roseman"&gt;Translation by Roseman, ''op.cit.''&lt;/ref&gt; He was writing around AD 10, although the earliest surviving copy of his work dates from the 6th century.
[[Pliny the Elder]] writing around AD 70 uses a Latin version of the same terminology in section 4.102 of his ''[[Pliny's Natural History|Naturalis Historia]]''. He writes of Great Britain: ''Albion ipsi nomen fuit, cum Britanniae vocarentur omnes de quibus mox paulo dicemus.'' ("Albion was its own name, when all [the islands] were called the Britannias; I will speak of them in a moment"). In the following section, 4.103, Pliny enumerates the islands he considers to make up the Britannias, listing Great Britain, Ireland, and many smaller islands.
In his ''Geography'' written in the mid 2nd century and probably describing the position around AD 100,&lt;ref name=ohi/&gt; [[Ptolemy]] includes both Great Britain (Albion) and Ireland ([[Hibernia|Iwernia]]) in the so called ''Bretanic'' island group. He entitles Book II, Chapter 1 of as ''[[Hibernia|Iwernia]], Bretanic Island'', and Chapter 2 as ''Alwion [sic], Bretanic Island''.&lt;ref&gt;Greek text [http://www.wilbourhall.org/pdfs/ptolemy/Claudii_Ptolemaei_GeographiaVOL_I.pdf Ptolemy's ''Geography'', Books I-IV], pg 59&lt;/ref&gt;

The name ''Albion'' for [[Great Britain]] fell from favour, and the island was described in Greek as Πρεττανία or Βρεττανία, in [[Latin]] ''Britannia'', an inhabitant as Βρεττανός, ''Britannus'', with the adjective Βρεττανικός, ''Britannicus'', equating to "British".&lt;ref name=snyder/&gt; With the [[Roman conquest of Britain]] the name [[Britannia]] was used for the province of [[Roman Britain]]. The Emperor [[Claudius]] was honoured with the [[Roman naming convention|agnomen]] ''Britannicus'' as if he were the conqueror, and coins were struck from AD 46 inscribed &lt;small&gt;DE BRITAN, DE BRITANN, DE BRITANNI,&lt;/small&gt; or &lt;small&gt;DE BRITANNIS&lt;/small&gt;. With the visit of [[Hadrian]] in AD 121 coins introduced a female figure with the label &lt;small&gt;BRITANNIA&lt;/small&gt; as a personification or goddess of the place. These and later Roman coins introduced the seated figure of Britannia which would be reintroduced in the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.24carat.co.uk/britanniaframe.html|title=Britannia on British Coins|work=24carat.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the later years of Roman rule Britons who left Latin inscriptions, both at home and elsewhere in the Empire, often described themselves as ''Brittanus'' or ''Britto'', and where describing their citizenship gave it as ''cives'' of a British tribe or of a ''patria'' (homeland) of ''Britannia'', not ''Roma''.&lt;ref name=snyder/&gt; From the 4th century, many Britons migrated from Roman Britain across the [[English Channel]] and founded [[Brittany]].

===Mediaeval period===
[[File:Britain 802.jpg|Map of Britain with part of Ireland in 802|thumb]]
[[File:Hereford Mappa Mundi 1300.jpg|Hereford Mappa Mundi with the isles in the lower left hand corner.|thumb]]
While Latin remained the language of learning, from the early [[mediaeval]] period records begin to appear in native languages. The earliest [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] source to use a collective term for the archipelago is the ''[[Life of Saint Columba]]'', a [[hagiography]] recording the missionary activities of the sixth century Irish monk [[Saint Columba]] among the peoples of what is now Scotland. It was written in the late seventh century by [[Adomnán of Iona|Adomnán]] of [[Iona]], an Irish monk living on the [[Inner Hebridean]] island. The collective term for the archipelago used within this work is '''Oceani Insulae''' meaning "Islands of the Ocean" (Book 2, 46 in the Sharpe edition = Book 2, 47 in Reeves edition), it is used sparingly and no ''Priteni''-derived collective reference is made.

Another early native source to use a collective term is the ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum]]'' of [[Bede]] written in the early eighth century. The collective term for the archipelago used within this work is ''insularum'' meaning "islands" (Book 1, 8) and it too is used sparingly. He stated that Britain "studies and confesses one and the same knowledge of the highest truth in the tongues of five nations, namely the Angles, the Britons, the Scots, the Picts, and the Latins", distinguishing between the [[Brythonic languages]] of the "ancient Britons" or [[Old Welsh]] speakers and other language groups.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/institutes/sassi/spns/watsloth.htm General survey of Lothian] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060925082819/http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/institutes/sassi/spns/watsloth.htm |date=2006-09-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Britons (Celtic people)|Brythonic]], [[Anglo-Saxons|Saxon]] and [[Viking]] kingdoms such as [[Kingdom of Strathclyde|Strathclyde]], [[Wessex]], and [[Scandinavian York|Jórvík]] amalgamated, leading to the formation of [[Scotland]], and [[England]]. [[Wales]] was sometimes united under princes or kings such as [[Gruffydd ap Llywelyn]]. Between 854 and 1171, a kingship of Ireland was established by kings of the regional kingdoms such as [[Máel Sechnaill mac Máele Ruanaid]], [[Toirdelbach Ua Briain]], [[Muirchertach Mac Lochlainn]], and [[Ruaidrí Ua Conchobair]], something not achieved in Britain until 1707. In subsequent [[Norman Ireland]], local lords gained considerable autonomy from the [[Lordship of Ireland]] until it became the [[Kingdom of Ireland]] under direct English rule.

===Renaissance mapmakers===
[[File:Blaeu - Atlas of Scotland 1654 - INSULAE ALBION ET HIBERNIA - Old Great Britain.jpg|thumb|right|The 1654 Blaeu Atlas of Scotland, ''Insulae Albion Et Hibernia'']]
[[Abraham Ortelius]] makes clear his understanding that England, Scotland and Ireland were politically separate in 1570  by the full title of his map: ''Angliae, Scotiae et Hiberniae, sive Britannicar. insularum descriptio'' ('A representation of England, Scotland and Ireland, or the Britannic islands'). [[George Lily]]'s 1546 map divides Britain into the two kingdoms of England and Scotland, with Ireland alongside. Some maps from this period also appear to mark Wales, and sometimes Cornwall, as separate areas within Britain, while the history of England created by [[Polydore Vergil]]&lt;ref&gt;Map Collectors' Series, Issue 9, Map Collectors' Circle, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; for [[Henry VIII]] states, "The whole country of Britain is divided into four parts, whereof the one is inhabited by Englishmen, the other of Scots, the third Welshmen and the fourth of Cornish people."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Kingston Derry, Michael G. Blakeway, J. Murray, The making of pre-industrial Britain: life and work between the Renaissance and the Industrial Revolution, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Philip Payton, The Making of Modern Cornwall: Historical Experience and the Persistence of "Difference", Dyllansow Truran, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

Maps of the Mediaeval, Renaissance and later periods often referred to ''[[Albion]]''. This archaic term was originally used by [[Ptolemy]] and [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] to mean the island of Great Britain. In later centuries its meaning changed to refer only to the area we now call Scotland (''Albany'', or ''[[Alba]]'' in [[Scottish Gaelic language|Gaelic]]). ''Albion'' has survived as a poetic name for Britain but it is not in everyday use.

===18th and 19th centuries===
[[File:Moll - The north part of Great Britain called Scotland.png|thumb|A 1726 map showing "The north part of Great Britain called Scotland"]]
Following the [[Acts of Union 1707]], a fashion arose, particularly in Scotland, for referring to Scotland and England as ''[[North Britain]]'' and ''[[South Britain]]'' respectively. These terms gained in popularity during the 19th century. The most lasting example of this usage was in the name of the [[North British Railway]], which became part of the [[London and North Eastern Railway]] in 1923, and in the name of the North British Hotel, built by the railway in [[Edinburgh]] in 1902, which retained the name until it reopened in 1991 as the Balmoral Hotel.

===Evolution of kingdoms and states===
[[File:Nations of the UK.png|400px|thumb|right|A timeline of [[Sovereign state|states]] in the British Isles. (''Ireland'' continues to exist, but the description "Republic of Ireland" is used as a disambiguator in this case).]]
The diagram on the right gives an indication of the further evolution of kingdoms and states. In 1603 the [[Scottish King]] [[James I of England|James VI]] inherited the [[English throne]] as "James I of England". He styled himself as ''James I of Great Britain'', although both states retained their sovereignty and independent parliaments, the [[Parliament of Scotland]] and the [[Parliament of England]]. (The term "Great Britain" itself reportedly dates from as early as 1474, and was in common usage from the mid-16th century onwards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heraldica.org/topics/britain/royalstyle_uk.htm Royal Styles and Titles in England and Great Britain], heraldica.org&lt;/ref&gt;)

The 1707 [[Act of Union 1707|Act of Union]] united England and Scotland in the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] under the [[Parliament of Great Britain]], then in 1800 Ireland was brought under British government control by the [[Act of Union 1800|Act of Union]] creating the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]]. Irish unrest culminated in the [[Anglo-Irish War|Irish War of Independence]] and the 1922 separation of the [[Irish Free State]], which later became a republic with the name Ireland. The majority Protestant [[Northern Ireland|northeast]] continued to be part of what became the [[United Kingdom|United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]].

[[British overseas territories]] such as [[Bermuda]], [[Gibraltar]] and the [[Falkland Islands]] have various relationships with the UK. The [[Commonwealth of Nations]], initially formalised in 1931 (the British Commonwealth until 1949), is an association of independent states roughly corresponding to the former [[British Empire]]. (This has no connection with the [[Commonwealth of England]], a short-lived [[republic]] replacing the previous kingdoms during the [[English Interregnum]] (1649–1660).)

==Adjectives==
The [[adjectives]] used to describe the contents and attributes of the various constituent parts of the British Isles also cause confusion.

In the absence of a single adjective to refer to the [[United Kingdom]], ''British'' is generally used to refer to the [[United Kingdom]] as a whole. However, in a specifically physical geographical sense, ''British'' is used to refer to the island of [[Great Britain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=British|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/british?showCookiePolicy=true|publisher=Collins English Dictionary|accessdate=16 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The adjectival phrase ''Great British'' is very rarely used to refer to [[Great Britain]], other than to contrive a [[pun]] on the word ''great'', as in "Great British Food".

''Irish'', refers to people or a characteristic "of Ireland".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Irish|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/irish?showCookiePolicy=true|publisher=Collins English Dictionary|accessdate=16 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As such, its meaning is contextual on the meaning of "Ireland" being used: it can relate both to the [[Republic of Ireland|Irish state]], and to the [[Ireland (island)|island of Ireland]]. [[Northern Ireland]], as a constituent part of the [[United Kingdom]], can thus be both ''British'' or ''Irish'', reflected in the ability  for residents of Northern Ireland to take either British or Irish citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=British-Irish Agreement|url=http://www.britishirishcouncil.org/about/british-irish-agreement|publisher=British-Irish|accessdate=16 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to be more specific, ''Northern Irish'' is therefore in common usage. Members of the [[Irish Nationalism|Nationalist]] communities would not describe themselves as ''British'' and would only use the terms ''Irish'', or specifically ''Northern Irish'' where needed.

The term ''Ulster'' can also be used as an adjective (e.g. "[[Royal Ulster Constabulary]]"), but this is more likely to be used by [[Unionists (Ireland)|Unionists]] and has political connotations in the same fashion as its use as a proper noun (because only six of the traditional nine counties of [[Ulster]], namely [[County Antrim|Antrim]], [[County Armagh|Armagh]], [[County Down|Down]], [[County Fermanagh|Fermanagh]], [[County Londonderry|Londonderry]] and [[County Tyrone|Tyrone]], are included in Northern Ireland with the remaining three counties [[County Cavan|Cavan]], [[County Donegal|Donegal]] and [[County Monaghan|Monaghan]] forming part of the Republic).  The term ''Ulsterman'' (or ''Ulsterwoman'') is common and holds no such political connotation. Likewise, [[Irish Nationalism|Nationalists]] might describe, say, a lake in Northern Ireland as ''Irish''.

Note that the geographical term [[Irish Sea]] thus far appears to have escaped political connotations, even though territorial control of the waters of the Irish Sea is divided between both the Republic of Ireland and the UK, and also includes a British [[Crown dependency]], the [[Isle of Man]]—as yet there appears to be no controversy with the term’s usage to mirror that of "British Isles". The "Northern" in "Northern Ireland" is not completely accurate.  The most northerly point on the island, [[Malin Head]], is in the Republic of Ireland—in [[County Donegal]]'s [[Inishowen]] Peninsula.

==Problems with use of terms==

===British Isles===
{{Main article|British Isles naming dispute}}

The dictionary definition of [[British Isles]] is that it is a geographical term that refers to the whole of [[Ireland]] and [[Great Britain]] as well as the surrounding islands. It is sometimes incorrectly used as if identical to the UK;{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} or to refer to [[Great Britain]] and the surrounding islands, excluding the island of [[Ireland]] entirely.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.megalithics.com/] Website on Megalithic Monuments in the British Isles and Ireland. Ireland in this site includes Fermanagh, which is politically in Northern Ireland."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://genuki.cs.ncl.ac.uk/FHMpaper/ The website uses the term "British Isles" in various ways, including ways that use Ireland as all of Ireland, while simultaneously using the term "The British Isles and Ireland", e.g. "Anyone using GENUKI should remember that its name is somewhat misleading — the website actually covers the British Isles and Ireland, rather than just the United Kingdom, and therefore includes information about the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man, as well as England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland."]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.ngrs.demon.co.uk.guide.pdf]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Guide to Narrow Gauge rail in the British Isles and Ireland which includes Belfast lines under the section on Ireland."&lt;/ref&gt; The [[BBC]] and ''[[The Times]]'' have style guides that mandate the dictionary definition but occasional misuse can be found on their web sites.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/features/understanding/britain_01.shtml British Weather (Part One)] This BBC article referred to "a small '''country''' such as the British Isles" between at least April 2004 and January 2007 (checked using the Wayback Machine at https://web.archive.org.

The term ''[[British Isles]]'' can also be considered irritating or offensive by some&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/media/mind-your-language/2010/may/11/snooker-british-isles-mind-your-language | publisher = [[The Guardian]] | accessdate = 2011-08-23 | title = Snooker and the geography of the British Isles | location=London | first=David | last=Marsh | date=2010-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the grounds that the modern association of the term ''British'' with the [[United Kingdom]] makes its application to Ireland inappropriate.

The term ''[[British Isles]]'' can also be considered to imply a proprietary title on the entire archipelago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Trevor Montague |title=A to Z of Britain and Ireland (A to Z series) |publisher=Little, Brown Book Group |year=2009 |page=introduction |isbn=1-84744-087-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The policy of the government of [[Ireland]] is that no branch of government should use the term,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.oireachtas-debates.gov.ie/D/0606/D.0606.200509280360.html Written Answers – Official Terms"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121006211200/http://www.oireachtas-debates.gov.ie/D/0606/D.0606.200509280360.html |date=2012-10-06 }}, [[Dáil Éireann]] – Volume 606 – 28 September 2005. In his response, the Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs added that "Our officials in the Embassy of Ireland, London, continue to monitor the media in Britain for any abuse of the official terms as set out in the Constitution of Ireland and in legislation. These include the name of the State, the President, Taoiseach and others."&lt;/ref&gt; and although it is on occasion used in a geographical sense in Irish parliamentary debates, this is often done in a way that excludes the Republic of Ireland. In October 2006, ''The Times'' quoted a spokesman for the Irish Embassy in London as saying that they would discourage its use.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,13509-2385403.html New atlas lets Ireland slip shackles of Britain"] A spokesman for the Irish Embassy in London said: “The British Isles has a dated ring to it, as if we are still part of the Empire. We are independent, we are not part of Britain, not even in geographical terms. We would discourage its useage.{{sic}}”&lt;/ref&gt;

During a stop-over visit to the Republic of Ireland in 1989, the leader of the [[Soviet Union]], [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], indicated that he assumed Ireland's [[head of state]] was [[Queen Elizabeth II]], given that she was the British Queen and his officials said that Ireland was a part of the British Isles.&lt;ref&gt;Eamon Delaney, 2001, ''An Accidental Diplomat: My Years in the Irish Foreign Service'', New Island Books, Dublin, {{ISBN|1-902602-39-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Northern Ireland]], some [[Irish nationalism|nationalists]] reject the term and instead use ''these islands'', ''these isles'' or "Britain and Ireland" as an alternative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Guelke| first=Adrian |chapter=Northern Ireland and Island Status |title=Northern Ireland and the Divided World: The Northern Ireland Conflict and the Good Friday Agreement in Comparative Perspective |editor=[[John McGarry]] ed. |year=2001 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |page=231}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been several suggestions for replacements for the term ''British Isles''. Although there is no single accepted replacement, the terms ''Great Britain and Ireland'', ''The British Isles and Ireland'' and ''Britain and Ireland'' are all used.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; are examples of this usage of the term "England".

Because of the offence likely to be taken by Scots, Welsh and Irish at this usage, most politicians and official figures have avoided this usage since the early 20th century. However, there are frequent examples of this usage from earlier times.&lt;ref name="nelson"&gt;[[England expects that every man will do his duty]] — Horatio Nelson, message to the British Fleet 1805&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="disraeli"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mlincoln"&gt;"The more formal use of 'Great-Britain and Ireland' and colloquial use of 'Old England' and 'old English spirit' in this description is evidence of the process of forging a national identity..." page 99 — {{citation |author=Margarette Lincoln |title=Representing the Royal Navy: British Sea Power, 1750–1815 |publisher=Ashgate Publishing |year=1946 }} {{ISBN|0-7546-0830-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a long time it was common for fans of the [[England national football team|England football team]] to wave the British [[Union Flag]]—with the use of the specifically English [[St George's Cross]] flag only gaining popularity at the [[UEFA Euro 96|Euro 96]] tournament.&lt;ref name="englandpassport"/&gt;

The colloquial usage of "England" as a synonym for "Britain" is still widespread outside the UK. In [[Germany]], the term "England" is often used to mean Great Britain or even the entire United Kingdom. In many other languages, such as Chinese, Japanese or Korean, the word for "English" is synonymous with "British"—see the article on [[Alternative words for British#Other languages|Alternative words for British]] for more detail.

===Europe===
The term "[[Europe]]" may be used in one of several different contexts by British and Irish people: either to refer to the whole of the European continent, to refer to only to [[Mainland Europe]], sometimes called "continental Europe" or simply "the Continent" by some people in the archipelago. ''Europe'' may also be used in reference to the [[European Union]] (or, historically, to the [[European Economic Community]]). A comedic treatment of the different uses of this word appears in an episode of the BBC sitcom ''[[To the Manor Born]]''. When tradesmen are taking measurements in metric, and Audrey fforbes-Hamilton objects on the grounds that the house was built "in feet and inches", a tradesman says "We're in Europe now", referring to the European Economic Community. Audrey fforbes-Hamilton retorts "Well you may be, but I'm staying here!" - implying that to her, the word "Europe" referred only to mainland Europe, excluding Britain and Ireland.

===Great Britain===

The word "Great" means "larger", in comparison with [[Brittany]] in modern-day [[France]].  One historical term for the [[peninsula]] in France that largely corresponds to the modern French province is ''Lesser'' or ''Little Britain''.  That region was settled by many British immigrants during the period of [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] migration into Britain, and named "Little Britain" by them. The [[French language|French]] term "Bretagne" now refers to the French "Little Britain", not to the British "Great Britain", which in French is called ''Grande-Bretagne''. In classical times, the [[Greco-Roman world|Graeco-Roman]] geographer [[Geography (Ptolemy)|Ptolemy]] in his ''[[Almagest]]'' also called the larger island ''megale Brettania'' (great Britain). At that time, it was in contrast to the smaller island of [[Ireland]], which he called ''mikra Brettania'' (little Britain).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Claudii Ptolemaei Opera quae exstant omnia|author=Claudius Ptolemy|authorlink=Ptolemy|editor1-last=Heiberg|editor1-first=J.L.|publisher=in aedibus B.G.Teubneri|location=Leipzig|date=1898|volume=vol.1 Syntaxis Mathematica|url=http://www.wilbourhall.org/pdfs/HeibergAlmagestComplete.pdf|pages=112–113|chapter=Ἕκθεσις τῶν κατὰ παράλληλον ἰδιωμάτων: κβ', κε'}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his later work ''[[Geography (Ptolemy)|Geography]]'', Ptolemy refers to Great Britain as ''Albion'' and to Ireland as ''[[Hibernia|Iwernia]]''. These "new" names were likely to have been the native names for the islands at the time. The earlier names, [[Exonym and endonym|in contrast]], were likely to have been coined before direct contact with local peoples was made.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Freeman, ''Ireland and the Classical World'', University of Texas Press, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

===Britain===

The word ''Britain'' is ambiguous, being used variously to mean Great Britain,&lt;ref name="Britain-CED"&gt;{{cite web |title=Britain Meaning in the Cambridge English Dictionary |url=https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/britain |website=dictionary.cambridge.org |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Britain-OLD"&gt;{{cite web |title=Definition of Britain in English by Oxford Dictionaries |url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/britain |website=Oxford Dictionaries - English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Britain-Col"&gt;{{cite web |title=Britain definition and meaning |url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/britain |website=www.collinsdictionary.com |publisher=Collins English Dictionary |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; the United Kingdom,&lt;ref name="Britain-MW"&gt;{{cite web |title=Britain - Definition for English-Language Learners |url=http://learnersdictionary.com/definition/Britain |website=learnersdictionary.com |publisher=Merriam-Webster's Learner's Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Britain-Col"/&gt; and for some, England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Birch |first1=Anthony H. |title=British System of Government |date=2013 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781134670567 |page=2 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=e2WFAgAAQBAJ |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Use of ''Britain'' can be contentious, with many people in Northern Ireland objecting to its application to their province.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Alphabetical checklist |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/radio_newsroom/1099593.stm |publisher=BBC |date=19 August 2002 |quote=many people in Northern Ireland object strongly ... to the idea that they live in Britain.}}&lt;/ref&gt; While some organisations including the BBC and British Government prefer to use ''Britain'' as shorthand for Great Britain,&lt;ref name="checklist-bbc"&gt;{{cite web |title=Alphabetical checklist |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/academy/journalism/news-style-guide/article/art20130702112133551 |website=BBC News |publisher=BBC |access-date=2018-06-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180717052327/http://www.bbc.co.uk/academy/journalism/news-style-guide/article/art20130702112133551 |archive-date=2018-07-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="style-guide-govuk"&gt;{{cite web |title=A to Z - Style guide |url=https://www.gov.uk/guidance/style-guide/a-to-z-of-gov-uk-style#B |website=www.gov.uk |publisher=UK Government |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; others prefer, where precision is not required, to use ''Britain'' to mean the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Places and people |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/style-book/places-and-people/ |website=The Telegraph |date=23 January 2018 |quote=The United Kingdom or the abbreviation UK is to be avoided ... unless the story has a specific relevance to Northern Ireland that would make the use of "Britain" or "British" wrong.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Style Guide |url=https://bordeure.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/the-economist-style-guide.pdf |publisher=The Economist |page=38 |date=2005 |quote=favour simplicity over precision and use Britain rather than Great Britain or the United Kingdom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ireland===
The word ''Ireland'' has two meanings.

# It is the official name of [[Republic of Ireland|the state]] that occupies five sixths of the island, formally named the Republic of Ireland.
# It is a geographical term for [[Ireland|the whole island]], which may be referred to as "the island of Ireland" to avoid ambiguity.

===Ulster===
[[File:IrelandUlster.svg|thumb|right|The traditional province of Ulster on the island of Ireland, showing the modern-day border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland]]

The terminology and usage of the name ''Ulster'' in Irish and British culture varies. Many within the [[unionist (Ireland)|unionist]] community&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Glossary of Terms Related to the Conflict|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/glossary.htm#U|website=CAIN Web service|publisher=[[Ulster University]]|accessdate=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and much of the UK press refer to [[Northern Ireland]] as ''Ulster''{{spaced ndash}}whereas the [[Irish nationalism|nationalist]] community refer to the traditional [[Provinces of Ireland|Irish province]] of [[Ulster]], which is a nine-county entity that incorporates the three counties of [[County Donegal|Donegal]], [[County Cavan|Cavan]] and [[County Monaghan|Monaghan]]  (which are in the Republic) along with the counties of [[County Armagh|Armagh]], [[County Antrim|Antrim]], [[County Down|Down]], [[County Fermanagh|Fermanagh]], [[County Londonderry|Londonderry]] and [[Tyrone]] in Northern Ireland.

Thus, the word ''Ulster'' has two usages:
# It is the name of [[Ulster|one]] of the four [[Provinces of Ireland]], consisting of the nine northern counties of the island, that was partitioned between the United Kingdom (six counties) and the Republic of Ireland (three counties).
# It is an alternative name for [[Northern Ireland]], used by many in the [[Irish Unionism|Unionist]] community.  It consists of the six north-eastern counties of the island that remain part of the United Kingdom.

===Isle of Man and Channel Islands===
The Isle of Man and the two [[bailiwick]]s of the Channel Islands are [[Crown dependencies]]; that is, non-sovereign [[nation]]s, self-governing but whose sovereignty is held by the British [[The Crown|Crown]]. They control their own internal affairs, but not their defence or foreign relations. They are not part of the United Kingdom or part of the [[European Union]].
*The [[Isle of Man]] is part of the [[British Isles]], situated in the [[Irish Sea]] between Great Britain and Ireland.
*The [[Channel Islands]] consist politically of two self-governing [[bailiwick]]s: the [[Bailiwick of Guernsey]] and the [[Jersey|Bailiwick of Jersey]]. They are the remnants of the [[Duchy of Normandy]], which was once in [[personal union]] with the Kingdom of England. They are sometimes, despite their location next to mainland [[France]], considered part of the British Isles.  This usage is political rather than geographic.
*The Isle of Man and the Channel Islands are [[British Islands]] in United Kingdom law.

===Celtic names===
There are five living [[Celtic languages]] in the region. Each has names for the islands and countries of the British Isles. They are divided into two branches:

*[[Brythonic languages|Brythonic]] – which includes [[Welsh language|Welsh]] and [[Cornish language|Cornish]]
*[[Goidelic languages|Goidelic]] – which includes [[Irish language|Irish]], [[Scottish Gaelic language|Scottish Gaelic]] and [[Manx language|Manx]]

The English word ''Welsh'' is from a common [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] root meaning "Romanised foreigner" ([[cognate]] with [[Wallonia]] and [[Wallachia]], and also cognate with the word used in Mediaeval German to refer to the French and [[Italy|Italian]]s).&lt;ref name="Wales Hist 69"&gt;{{cite book|last =Davies|first=John|authorlink =John Davies (historian)|title = A History of Wales|publisher =Penguin|year =1994|location =London| pages =69|isbn =0-14-014581-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The English names ''[[Albion]]'' and ''[[Scotland|Albany]]'' are related to ''Alba'' and used poetically for either England or Scotland, or the whole island of Great Britain.

English ''[[Erin]]'' is a poetic name for Ireland derived from ''Éire'' (or rather, from its dative form ''Éirinn'').

===Terms for the British Isles in the Irish language===
In Irish, the term ''Oileáin Bhriotanacha'' is a translation of the English term ''British Isles''. Another translation is ''Oileáin Bhreataineacha'', which was used in the 1937 translation from English to Irish of a 1931 geography book.&lt;ref&gt;''Tír-Eóluíocht na h-Éireann'' (translation by Toirdhealbhach Ó Raithbheartaigh of ''Macmillan's General and Regional Geography of Ireland'' by T. J. Dunne), Government Publications Office, Dublin&lt;blockquote&gt;''Tá Éire ar cheann de na h-oileáin a dtugar na &lt;u&gt;h-Oileáin Bhreataineacha&lt;/u&gt; ortha agus atá ar an taobh Thiar-Thuaidh de'n Eóraip. Tá siad tuairim a's ar chúig mhíle oileán ar fad ann. (Oileánradh an t-ainm a bheirtear ar áit ar bith i n-a bhfuil a lán oileán agus iad i n-aice a chéile mar seo.) Éire agus an Bhreatain Mhór (Sasain, an Bhreatain Bheag, agus Alba) an dá oileán is mó de na h-Oileáin Bhreataineacha.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Ireland is one of the islands which are called the British Isles and which are on the North-Western side of Europe. It is thought that there are five thousand islands in total there. (Archipelago is the name which is borne by a place in which there are many islands next to each other like these.) Ireland and Great Britain (England, Wales, and Scotland) are the two largest islands of the British Isles.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier dictionaries&lt;ref&gt;Patrick S. Dinneen, ''Foclóir Gaeilge Béarla, Irish-English Dictionary'', Dublin, 1927&lt;/ref&gt; give ''Oileáin Iarthair Eorpa'' as the translation, literally meaning ''West European Isles''. Today the most common term ''Éire agus an Bhreatain Mhór'' is used, meaning literally as ''Ireland and Great Britain'', as provided by terminological dictionaries.&lt;ref name=tearma&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.tearma.ie/Search.aspx?term=the+British+Isles | title = the British Isles | work = téarma.ie – Dictionary of Irish Terms | publisher = [[Foras na Gaeilge]] and [[Dublin City University]] | accessdate = 18 Nov 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Slang==
''[[Blighty]]'' is a slang word for Britain derived from the [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] word ''bilāyatī'' ("foreign"). Depending on the user, it is meant either affectionately or archly. It was often used by British soldiers abroad in the [[First World War]] to refer to home.

The '''Yale school''' is a colloquial name for an influential group of [[literary criticism|literary critics]], [[literary theory|theorists]], and [[continental philosophy|philosophers]] of [[literature]] that were influenced by [[Jacques Derrida]]'s philosophy of [[deconstruction]]. Many of the theorists were affiliated with [[Yale University]] in the late 1970s, although a number of the theorists &amp;mdash; including [[Derrida]] himself &amp;mdash; subsequently moved to or became affiliated with the [[University of California at Irvine]].

==Relationship to deconstruction==
As a school of thought, the Yale School is more closely allied with the [[post-structuralist]] dimensions of deconstruction as opposed to its [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] dimensions. Additionally, the Yale School is more similar to the 1970s version of deconstruction that [[John D. Caputo]] has described as a "[[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzschean]] free play of signifiers" and not the 1990s version of deconstruction that was far more concerned with political and ethical questions.&lt;ref&gt;(2002) Raschke, Carl "Loosening Philosophy’s Tongue: A Conversation with Jack Caputo" http://www.jcrt.org/archives/03.2/caputo_raschke.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(2006) Zizek, Slavoj "A Plea for a Return to Differance (with a minor 'Pro Domo Sua')" ''Critical Inquiry'' 32 (2): 226-249&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
During the period between the late 1960s and the early 1980s, [[Yale University]] was the home of a variety of thinkers who were indebted to [[deconstruction]]. The group included high-profile literary scholars such as [[Paul de Man]], [[Geoffrey Hartman]], [[J. Hillis Miller]], and [[Harold Bloom]].  This group came to be known as the ''Yale School'' and was especially influential in literary criticism because de Man, Miller, Hartman and Bloom are all considered to be prominent literary critics. The four critics listed above, along with Derrida, contributed to an influential anthology, ''Deconstruction and Criticism''. However, Harold Bloom's position was always somewhat different from that of the rest of the group, and he later distanced himself from deconstruction.

==Book summaries==

===Deconstruction and Criticism (1979)===
In his introduction to ''Deconstruction and Criticism'', Hartman draws a distinction between Derrida, Miller, and de Man on the one hand, and himself and Bloom on the other.  The former category he refers to as "boa-deconstructors"&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, Harold, et al.  ''Deconstruction and Criticism'' (New York: Continuum, 1979), ix.&lt;/ref&gt; who pursue deconstruction to its utmost conclusions and who are more philosophically rigorous in their writings.  

Hartman claims that both himself and Bloom are "barely deconstructionists" and that they "even write against it on occasion."&lt;ref&gt;''Deconstruction and Criticism'', ix.&lt;/ref&gt; Hartman claims that his writing style in particular is more reliant on the traditional role of [[pathos]] as a fundamental impetus for literary language.  In contrast, deconstruction as advocated by Derrida seeks to reveal that the very notion of pathos is caught up in the rhetorical play which is endemic to language.

==Move to Irvine==
After teaching at Yale from 1972 to 1986, [[J. Hillis Miller]] left for the [[University of California, Irvine]], where he is today Distinguished Research Professor of English and Comparative Literature.

Shortly after J. Hillis Miller's arrival at UC Irvine in 1986, Derrida himself became Professor of the Humanities at UCI. Derrida remained at UCI until 2003, one year before his death. Until his death, Derrida had slowly been turning over lecture manuscripts, journals and other materials to UCI’s special collections library under an agreement he signed in 1990. After Derrida’s death, his widow and sons said they wanted copies of UCI’s archives shared with the Institute of Contemporary Publishing Archives in France. The university had sued in an attempt to get manuscripts and correspondence from Derrida’s widow and children that it believed the philosopher had promised to UC Irvine’s collection, although the suit was dropped in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.continental-philosophy.org/2007/02/15/uc-irvine-drops-suit-over-derridas-personal-papers/&lt;/ref&gt;

The Irvine Langson Library Special Collections also houses the [[Paul de Man]] Papers, a collection of personal and professional papers documenting de Man's work in comparative literature.
