==Synopsis==
A Martian boy, Kip, was caught up in an intergalactic race to save both Christmas and Earth.

==Cast==
*[[Cindy Robinson]] as Kip, Mary Kate
*[[Dino Andrade|K.C.D. Shannon]] as Zork, Dwight
*[[David Lodge (voice actor)|David Lodge]] as Gleeb, [[Santa Claus]], Martian Leader
*Mac Grave as Ned, Drang, Martian Scientist
*[[R. Martin Klein|Robert Mark Klein]] as Office Manager, Martian Officer
*[[Katie Leigh]] as Roxy
*[[Dave Mallow]] as VOX, Shopper

==Production==
On 6 October 2008, ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' reported that ''A Martian Christmas'' is in development from [[Porchlight Entertainment]] and [[Ánima Estudios]].&lt;ref name=hollywoodreporter/&gt; Post-production services was handled by Telegael.

==Reception==
The film received mixed reviews. IMDB reported the film received a 7.1 audience rating out of 10.&lt;ref name=commonsensemedia&gt;{{cite web|last=Filucci|first=Sierra|title=A Martian Christmas Movie Review|url=https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/a-martian-christmas|work=Common Sense Media|publisher=Common Sense Media|accessdate=21 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sierra Filucci of [[Common Sense Media]] gave this film 2 out of 5 stars and said, "Unfortunately the build-up to the main part of the story -- the journey to Earth -- takes so long and is packed with so much backstory that kids and even adults might get lost, or just bored. Once the trip begins, things pick up and it's sort of interesting to see humans and Christmas from outsiders' eyes."&lt;ref name=commonsensemedia/&gt;

==Release==
This film was released on DVD on 11 November 2009 by [[PorchLight Entertainment|PorchLight Home Entertainment]]. Due to its obscurity, it remains one of the rarest films to this day, most likely due to lack of promotion, and the fact that this film was primarily produced in [[Mexico]], as it is difficult for a Mexican animated production to get into the [[United States]] market, according to producer Fernando de Fuentes.&lt;ref name="DiálogoSinFronteras"&gt;{{cite news|title=ANIMA ESTUDIOS prepara sorpresas en cine de animación (in Spanish)|url=http://dialogosinfronteras.com/?p=29242|accessdate=27 June 2014|work=Diálogo Sin Fronteras|publisher=Diálogo Sin Fronteras|date=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DVD of the film is only available on online shopping sites, such as [[eBay]] and [[Amazon.com]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4221">'''Visual arts in Finland''' started to form its individual characteristics in the 19th century, when [[Romantic nationalism]] was rising in autonomic [[Finland]].

== Prehistoric art ==
The oldest marks of human activity in Finland has found in [[Wolf cave|Susiluola]], [[Kristiinankaupunki]]. Some excavation has been considered as a man-made over 100,000 years ago.&lt;ref name="kansallismuseo.fi"&gt;http://www.kansallismuseo.fi/en/nationalmuseum/exhibitions/permanent&lt;/ref&gt; After the Ice Age, area of Finland was resettled at around 9,000 years ago and first known sculpture [[Elk's Head of Huittinen]] (picture in stamp) has been dated about 5–7000 BCE.&lt;ref name="kansallismuseo.fi"/&gt;

==Medieval period==
[[File:Turun tuomiokirkko talvella.JPG|thumb|Turku Cathedral.]]
The most important products of medieval architecture in Finland are the medieval stone churches. More than a hundred of them were built during 15th and 16th centuries. [[Neoclassical architecture]] arrived in late 18th century, but important building projects started after 1808 when Finland was an autonomic part of Russia. [[Alexander II of Russia]] commissioned [[Carl Ludvig Engel]] to plan the new Senate and University for Helsinki.&lt;ref name="AH"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://helda.helsinki.fi/bitstream/handle/10138/24652/Suomen%20taidehistoria%202011.pdf?sequence=5 |title= Suomen Taidehistoria |last1=Hiekkanen |first1=Markus |last2= |first2= |date=2011 |website=Taidehistoria, Helsingin yliopisto |publisher=Helsinki University |language=fi |access-date=2015-10-25 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic visual arts==
The Finnish academic drawing tradition began at [[Royal Academy of Turku]] in 1707 when first instructions of drawing was given. In 1824 The School moves with the University to [[Helsinki]] and first Finland’s art exhibition was organised at the Drawing School in the autumn of 1845. Painting was rising in Golden era of Finnish art in 1880s, when [[romantic nationalism]] was the spirit of art. [[Akseli Gallen-Kallela]] started in naturalism but moved to national romanticism.&lt;ref name="AH"/&gt;

In 1950s the Finnish artists looked for foreign influence: first in Paris, then in United States but also in Stockholm, where modern art exhibitions were organized in Moderna museet. Abstract art made its breakthrough first in [[concrete art]]. Early concretists included [[Birger Carlstedt]] and [[Sam Vanni]]. When Vanni's monumental painting ''Contrapunctus'' (1959) won competition for mural in Helsinki, abstract art was considered to be accepted and established in Finland.&lt;ref name="CEN"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://ehtiihanpariisiin.keskisuomentaide.fi/artikkelit/kuvataide-suomessa/ |title= Kuvataide Suomessa 1950- ja 1960-luvuilla |last1= Heinänen  |first1= Seija |last2= |first2= |date= |website= Ehtiihän Pariisiin |publisher= Art Museum in Jyväskylä |access-date=2015-10-25 | language=fi |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Informalism]] spread quickly in 1950s and 1960s, when it was considered a new approach to [[landscape painting]]. It was also building on strong tradition of expressionism. It spread even outside of large cities.&lt;ref name="CEN"/&gt;

The Finnish contemporary art scene became much more visible than before with the establishment of [[Kiasma]], the Museum of Contemporary Art in Helsinki in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.artsy.net/article/editorial-number-focusfinland-your-crash-course-on-finlands-contemporary |title= #FocusFinland: Your Crash Course on Finland’s Contemporary Art Scene |date= 2014 |website= |publisher= Artsy |access-date=2015-10-25  |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6837">The '''Articulatory approach''' to teaching pronunciation considers learning how to pronounce a [[second language]] to be a [[motor skill]] which most students are not in a position to develop based on self-evaluation of their production. The role of the teacher is therefore to provide feedback on students' performance as part of coaching them in the movements of the [[vocal tract]] articulators (tongue, jaw, lips, etc.) which create speech sounds.

The Articulatory approach is an alternative to the imitative-intuitive and analytic-linguistic approaches,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Celce-Murcia|first1=Marianne|last2=Brinton|first2=Donna|last3=Goodwin|first3=Janet|title=Teaching Pronunciation|date=2010|publisher=CUP|isbn=978-0521729765|page=2|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; both of which involve the teacher providing a model for her students to imitate. The model might be her own voice or a recording. In the articulatory approach, the students are not asked to match a model but instead to experiment with making sounds, with the teacher acting as a source of ideas, encouragement and feedback on how close the students are getting to the target.

== The problem of categorical perception ==
When learning a new language, students are not in a position to compare [[First language|L1]] and [[Second language|L2]] sounds competently because the L2 sounds are evaluated using the [[categorical perception]] developed for L1. [[Trubetzkoy]] described the process as follows:&lt;ref&gt;N.S.Trubetzkoy, N.S. (1939) Grundzüge der Phonologie (Principles of Phonology), p.51
&lt;/ref&gt; "The phonological system of a language is like a sieve through which everything that is said passes ... Each person acquires the system of his mother tongue. But when he hears another language spoken, he intuitively uses the familiar 'phonological sieve' of his mother tongue to analyze what has been said. However, since this sieve is not suited for the foreign language, numerous mistakes and misinterpretations are the result. The sounds of the foreign language receive an incorrect phonological interpretation since they are strained through the 'phonological sieve' of one's own mother tongue."

Users of the imitative-intuitive approach, who simply give their students a model to imitate ('Listen and Repeat') believe that this problem will resolve itself with exposure to L2 over the course of time. Users of the analytic-linguistic approach address the problem explicitly through listening exercises, recently including high variability phonetic training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Logan|first1=John|last2=Lively|first2=Scott|last3=Pisoni|first3=David|title=Training Japanese listeners to identify English /r/ and /l/: A first report|journal=J Acoust Soc Am|date=1991|volume=89|issue=2|pages=874–886}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Iverson|first1=Paul|last2=Hazan|first2=Valerie|last3=Bannister|first3=Kerry|title=Phonetic training with acoustic cue manipulations: A comparison of methods for teaching English /r/-/l/ to Japanese adults|journal=J Acoust Soc Am|date=2005|volume=118|issue=5|pages=3267–3278|doi=10.1121/1.2062307}}&lt;/ref&gt; In both approaches, it is believed that as students improve their perception of L2 sounds, they will be better able to match their production of L2 sounds to the models provided.

Proponents of the articulatory approach argue that it is more efficient to begin by working on the production of L2 sounds directly (as a motor skill rather than an imitative task) and that this leads to improved L2 perception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Linebaugh|first1=Gary|last2=Roche|first2=Thomas|title=Evidence that L2 production training can enhance perception|journal=Journal of Academic Language &amp; Learning|date=2015|volume=9|issue=1|pages=1–17|url=http://journal.aall.org.au/index.php/jall/article/view/326}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In the late nineteenth century, [[Henry Sweet]] argued for the coaching of students in the use of their articulators: "Those who try to learn new sounds by ear alone, without any systematic training in the use of their vocal organs, generally succeed only partially. ... In the case of those who have only an average ear, and still more of those who have a defective ear, organic training is indispensable. There can be no question that flexible organs well trained together with only an average ear, will yield better results than even an exceptionally good ear without organic training. Nor must it be forgotten that fineness of ear is not necessarily accompanied by flexibility of the vocal organs."&lt;ref&gt;Sweet, H. (1877) A Handbook of Phonetics, London: MacMillan p.21&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, the phonetician [[J. C. Catford]] presented readers with "a series of simple introspective experiments [to be] carried out inside their own vocal tracts, their own throats and mouths. By actually making sounds (very often silently) and attending to the muscular sensations that accompany their production one can discover how they are produced ..."&lt;ref&gt;Catford, J. C. (1988) A practical introduction to phonetics. Oxford: Clarendon Press p.v&lt;/ref&gt;

Catford and Pisoni&lt;ref&gt;Catford, J. C. and Pisoni, D. B. (1970) Auditory vs. Articulatory Training in Exotic Sounds. The Modern Language Journal, 54: 477–481. {{doi|10.1111/j.1540-4781.1970.tb03581.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; undertook a small scale experiment in which they found that students learnt both the pronunciation and discrimination of foreign sounds better when they were explicitly taught how to produce them than when they were taught how to discriminate them by ear.

== Contemporary language teaching ==
Within foreign language teaching, the best known proponent of an articulatory approach was [[Caleb Gattegno]]. In his [[Silent Way]], the teacher does not model sounds, but encourages experimentation on the part of students, and gives them feedback on how closely they are approaching their targets.&lt;ref&gt;Kho, Mu-Jeong (2016).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1223">The '''Association Guillaume Budé''', named after the 16th century humanist [[Guillaume Budé]], is a [[France|French]] cultural and learned society dedicated to the promotion of [[Humanities]]. The current president of the society is the hellenist [[Jacques Jouanna]].

The society was founded in 1917 by the philologists Maurice Croiset, Paul Mazon, Louis Bodin and [[Alfred Ernout]]. The society's initial goal was to publish critical editions of [[Ancient Greek literature|Greek]] and [[Latin literature|Latin]] classics, competing with [[Germany]] which was then leading the field. The result was the ''[[Collection Budé]]'', first published in 1920. The society soon founded its own publishing house [[Les Belles Lettres]], and went beyond the classical world, getting involved in the studies of [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] and [[Middle Ages|medieval]] worlds. A bulletin has been published by the society since 1923. Besides publishing, the society organizes conferences, symposia and cultural tours.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="938">'''Aude''', or '''Alda''', '''Alde''', was the sister of [[Oliver (paladin)|Oliver]] and betrothed of [[Roland]] in ''[[The Song of Roland]]'' and other [[chanson de geste|chansons de geste]]. The story of her engagement to Roland is told in ''[[Girart de Vienne]]''.

In ''The Song of Roland'' Aude is first mentioned by her brother Oliver when he tells Roland that the two will never be married, when the two counts are arguing before the battle; they are later reconciled, but both die fighting the [[Saracen]]s. When [[Charlemagne]] returns to [[Aachen|Aix]] and informs Aude that Roland has died, she collapses at the Emperor's feet and dies of grief.

"The Lovely Alda" is part of [[Edward MacDowell]]'s 1891 orchestral composition, ''Two Fragments after the Song of Roland''.

'''''Avengers: Infinity War''''' is a 2018 American [[superhero film]] based on the [[Marvel Comics]] superhero team the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], produced by [[Marvel Studios]] and distributed by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures]]. It is the sequel to 2012's ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' and 2015's ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'', and [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the nineteenth film]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU). The film is directed by [[Russo brothers|Anthony and Joe Russo]], written by [[Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely]], and features an [[ensemble cast]] including&lt;!-- Order per TOP BILLING of the poster --&gt; [[Robert Downey Jr.]], [[Chris Hemsworth]], [[Mark Ruffalo]], [[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]], [[Scarlett Johansson]], [[Benedict Cumberbatch]], [[Don Cheadle]], [[Tom Holland (actor)|Tom Holland]], [[Chadwick Boseman]], [[Paul Bettany]], [[Elizabeth Olsen]], [[Anthony Mackie]], [[Sebastian Stan]], [[Danai Gurira]], [[Letitia Wright]], [[Dave Bautista]], [[Zoe Saldana]], [[Josh Brolin]], and [[Chris Pratt]]. In the film, the Avengers and the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]] attempt to stop [[Thanos]] from amassing the all-powerful [[Infinity Gems|Infinity Stones]].

The film was announced in October 2014 as ''Avengers: Infinity War – Part 1''. The Russo brothers came on board to direct in April 2015 and by May, Markus and McFeely had signed on to write the script for the film, which drew inspiration from [[Jim Starlin]]'s 1991 ''[[The Infinity Gauntlet]]'' comic and [[Jonathan Hickman]]'s 2013 ''[[Infinity (comic book)|Infinity]]'' comic. In 2016, Marvel shortened the title to ''Avengers: Infinity War''. Filming began in January 2017 at [[Pinewood Atlanta Studios]] in [[Fayette County, Georgia]], with a large cast consisting mostly of actors reprising their roles from [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe film actors|previous MCU films]], including Brolin as Thanos. The production lasted until July 2017, shooting [[back to back film production|back-to-back]] with an untitled [[Untitled Avengers film|direct sequel]]. Additional filming took place in Scotland, England, the [[Downtown Atlanta]] area, and New York City. With an estimated budget in the range of $316–400&amp;nbsp;million, it is [[List of most expensive films|one of the most expensive films ever made]].

''Avengers: Infinity War'' held its world premiere on April 23, 2018 in Los Angeles and was released in the United States on April 27, 2018, in [[IMAX]] and [[3D film|3D]]. The film received praise for the performances of the cast (particularly Brolin's) and the emotional weight of the story, as well as the visual effects and action sequences. It was the fourth film and the [[List of highest grossing superhero films#Top 50 superhero movies at the worldwide box office|first superhero film]] to gross over $2&amp;nbsp;billion worldwide, breaking numerous [[List of box office records set by Avengers: Infinity War|box office records]] and becoming the [[2018 in film#Highest-grossing films|highest-grossing film of 2018]], as well as the [[List of highest-grossing films#Highest-grossing films|&lt;!--This is the PEAK POSITION the film achieved NOT the CURRENT.

==Plot==
&lt;!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words only. --&gt;
Having acquired the Power Stone, one of the six [[Infinity Gems|Infinity Stones]], from the planet [[Xandar#Film|Xandar]], [[Thanos]] and his lieutenants&lt;!-- Per talk discussion "children" or "henchmen" does not succinctly convey their role. DO NOT CHANGE without consensus! --&gt;—[[Ebony Maw]], [[Black Dwarf (comics)#Film|Cull Obsidian]], [[Proxima Midnight]], and [[Corvus Glaive]]—intercept a spaceship carrying the last survivors of [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]]. As they extract the Space Stone from the [[Cosmic Cube|Tesseract]], Thanos subdues [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], overpowers [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], and kills [[Loki (comics)|Loki]].&lt;!-- Let's leave this alone. It doesn't matter HOW Thanos gets the stone, only that he DOES get it--&gt; [[Heimdall (comics)|Heimdall]] sends Hulk to Earth using the [[Bifröst#Adaptations|Bifröst]] before being killed. Thanos departs with his lieutenants and obliterates the ship.

Hulk crash-lands at the [[Sanctum Sanctorum]] in New York City, reverting to Bruce Banner. He warns [[Stephen Strange]] and [[Wong (comics)|Wong]] about Thanos' plan to kill half of all life in the universe; in response, Strange recruits [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark]]. Maw and Obsidian arrive to retrieve the Time Stone from Strange, drawing the attention of [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]]. Maw captures Strange, but fails to take the Time Stone due to an enchantment. Stark and Parker pursue Maw's spaceship, Banner contacts [[Captain America|Steve Rogers]], and Wong stays behind to guard the Sanctum.

In [[Edinburgh]], Midnight and Glaive ambush [[Scarlet Witch|Wanda Maximoff]] and [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]] in order to retrieve the Mind Stone in Vision's forehead. Rogers, [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)|Natasha Romanoff]], and [[Falcon (comics)|Sam Wilson]] rescue them and take shelter with [[War Machine|James Rhodes]] and Banner at the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] Facility. Vision offers to sacrifice himself by having Maximoff destroy the Mind Stone to keep Thanos from retrieving it. Rogers suggests they travel to [[Wakanda]], which he believes has the resources to remove the stone without destroying Vision.

The [[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]] respond to a distress call from the Asgardian ship and rescue Thor, who surmises Thanos seeks the Reality Stone, which is in the possession of the [[Collector (comics)|Collector]] on [[Knowhere]]. [[Rocket Raccoon|Rocket]] and [[Groot]] accompany Thor to [[Nidavellir]], where they and [[Eitri (comics)|Eitri]] create Stormbreaker, a&lt;!-- PER WP:EASTEREGG – DO NOT LINK STORMBREAKER; IT'S NOT TRUE IN THE COMICS! --&gt; battle-axe capable of killing Thanos. On Knowhere, [[Star-Lord|Peter Quill]], [[Gamora]], [[Drax the Destroyer|Drax]], and [[Mantis (Marvel Comics)|Mantis]] find Thanos with the Reality Stone already in his possession. Thanos kidnaps Gamora, his adopted daughter, who reveals the location of the Soul Stone to save her captive adopted sister [[Nebula (comics)|Nebula]] from torture. Thanos and Gamora travel to [[List of planets in Marvel Comics#Vormir|Vormir]], where [[Red Skull]], keeper&lt;!--The CREDITS specifically call him the "Stonekeeper"--&gt; of the Soul Stone, informs him the stone can only be retrieved by sacrificing someone he loves. Thanos reluctantly kills Gamora, earning the stone.

Nebula escapes captivity and asks the remaining Guardians to meet her on Thanos' destroyed homeworld, [[Titan (Marvel Comics)|Titan]]. Stark and Parker kill Maw and rescue Strange. Landing on Titan, they meet Quill, Drax, and Mantis. The group forms a plan to remove Thanos' Infinity Gauntlet after Strange uses the Time Stone to view millions of possible futures, seeing only one in which Thanos loses. Thanos arrives, justifying his plans as necessary to ensure the survival of a universe threatened by overpopulation. The group subdues him until Nebula deduces that Thanos has killed Gamora. Enraged, Quill attacks him, allowing Thanos to break the group's hold and overpower them. Stark is seriously wounded by Thanos, but is spared after Strange surrenders the Time Stone to Thanos.

In Wakanda, Rogers reunites with [[Bucky Barnes]] before Thanos' army invades. The Avengers, alongside [[Black Panther (comics)|T'Challa]] and the Wakandan forces, mount a defense while [[Shuri (comics)|Shuri]] works to extract the Mind Stone from Vision. Banner, unable to transform into the Hulk, fights in Stark's [[Hulkbuster armor]]. Thor, Rocket, and Groot arrive to reinforce the Avengers; Midnight, Obsidian, and Glaive are killed and their army is routed. Thanos arrives and despite Maximoff's attempt to destroy the Mind Stone, removes it from Vision's head, killing him.

Thor severely wounds Thanos, but Thanos activates the completed Infinity Gauntlet and teleports away. Half of all life across the universe disintegrates, including Barnes, T'Challa, Groot, Maximoff, Wilson, Mantis, Drax, Quill, Strange, and Parker, as well as [[Maria Hill]] and [[Nick Fury]], although Fury is able to transmit a signal first.{{refn|name=CaptainMarvel|group=N|Identified off-screen to be a message to [[Carol Danvers|Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel]].&lt;ref name="CaptainMarvel" /&gt;}} Stark and Nebula remain on Titan while Banner, [[Man-Ape|M'Baku]], [[Okoye (comics)|Okoye]], Rhodes, Rocket, Rogers, Romanoff, and Thor are left on the Wakandan battlefield.&lt;!-- THE BATTLEFIELD IS STATED AS SHURI'S FATE IS UNKNOWN--&gt; Meanwhile, Thanos watches a sunrise on another planet.&lt;!--Stop ascribing emotions to the ending scene. Nothing is explicitly stated, especially with the preceding scene in mind.--&gt;

I think he's had enough of saving Banner's ass." Russo added that this was "really reflective of the journey from ''Ragnarok''... [where] these two characters are constantly in conflict with each other over control."&lt;ref name="RussoHulkScared" /&gt; Banner's appearance in the film continues a story arc for the character that was established in ''Thor: Ragnarok'' and concludes in [[Untitled Avengers film|the ''Infinity War'' sequel]],&lt;ref name="RuffaloHulkArc" /&gt; with the difference between Hulk and Banner "starting to blur a little bit". Ruffalo described Hulk in ''Infinity War'' as having the mental capacity of a five-year-old.&lt;ref name="ColliderRuffaloBosemanMarch2018" /&gt;}}

Cheadle believed that Rhodes is "negotiating this reunion and his rejoining this team". He also explained that Rhodes' relationship with Stark "deepened" from his accident, saying, "I think Tony feels somewhat responsible and culpable in a way.

==Production==
{{main|Production of Avengers: Infinity War and the untitled Avengers sequel}}
In October 2014, Marvel announced a two-part sequel to ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'' (2015), titled ''Avengers: Infinity War''. ''Part 1'' was scheduled to be released on May 4, 2018, with ''Part 2'' scheduled for May 3, 2019.&lt;ref name="Oct2014Event" /&gt;&lt;ref name="InfinityWar" /&gt; In April 2015, Marvel announced that [[Russo brothers|Anthony and Joe Russo]] would direct both parts of ''Avengers: Infinity War'',&lt;ref name="Russos2" /&gt; with [[back to back film production|back-to-back filming]] expected to begin in 2016.&lt;ref name="Russos" /&gt; The next month, [[Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely]] had signed on to write the screenplays for both parts of the film,&lt;ref name="MarkusMcFeely" /&gt; which draws inspiration from [[Jim Starlin]]'s 1991 "[[The Infinity Gauntlet]]" comic and [[Jonathan Hickman]]'s 2013 "[[Infinity (comic book)|Infinity]]" comic.&lt;ref name="Influences" /&gt; Anthony Russo added the film was inspired by 1990s [[heist films]], with [[Thanos]] "on a smash-and-grab [to acquire the [[Infinity Gems#Film|Infinity Stones]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, and everybody's trying to catch up the whole movie".&lt;ref name="EWBTSPg2" /&gt; Producer [[Kevin Feige]] said that the ''Infinity War'' films were subtitled ''Part 1'' and ''Part 2'' "because they [have] such shared elements, it felt appropriate... But I wouldn't call it [[List of films split into multiple parts|one story that's cut in half]]. I would say it's going to be two distinct movies."&lt;ref name="FeigeApril2015" /&gt; In May 2016, the Russos revealed that they would retitle the two films, to further remove the misconception that they were one large film split in two, with Joe stating, "The intention is we will change [the titles], we just haven't come up with [them] yet."&lt;ref name="Retitled" /&gt; That July, Marvel revealed ''Part 1''{{'}}s title would be shortened to simply ''Avengers: Infinity War''.&lt;ref name="Retitled2" /&gt;

[[Principal photography]] began on January 23, 2017,&lt;ref name="FilmingStart" /&gt; under the [[working title]] ''Mary Lou'',&lt;ref name="WorkingTitle" /&gt; at [[Pinewood Atlanta Studios]] in [[Fayette County, Georgia]],&lt;ref name="Pinewood" /&gt; with [[Trent Opaloch]] as [[director of photography]].&lt;ref name="Atlanta" /&gt; ''Infinity War'', along with its sequel, were shot using [[IMAX#IMAX/Arri digital camera|IMAX/Arri]] 2D cameras, thus marking the first time that a Hollywood feature film was shot entirely with IMAX digital cameras.&lt;ref name="THRIMAX" /&gt; In early February, Marvel confirmed the involvement of [[Robert Downey Jr.]] as [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark / Iron Man]], [[Chris Pratt]] as [[Star-Lord|Peter Quill / Star-Lord]], and [[Tom Holland (actor)|Tom Holland]] as [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker / Spider-Man]] in the film.&lt;ref name="Holland" /&gt; Additional filming took place in Scotland beginning in February 2017. The filming occurred in [[Edinburgh]], [[Glasgow]] and the [[Scottish Highlands]],&lt;ref name="Scotland" /&gt; with studio work taking place at [[Wardpark Studios]] in [[Cumbernauld]].&lt;ref name="Wardpark" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wardpark2" /&gt; Filming also began at [[Durham Cathedral]] in [[Durham, England]] in early May 2017.&lt;ref name="Durham" /&gt; In late June 2017, filming occurred in [[Downtown Atlanta]],&lt;ref name="DowntownAtlantaFilming" /&gt; as well as Atlanta's [[Central Park (Atlanta)|Central Park]] in early July,&lt;ref name="AtlCentralPark" /&gt; before moving to [[Queens]], New York in the middle of the month.&lt;ref name="QueensFilming" /&gt; Filming concluded on July 14, 2017.&lt;ref name="FilmingEnd" /&gt; For the film's final scene, where Thanos emerges healed in a [[nipa hut]], the filmmakers partnered with Indochina Productions, a studio based in Thailand, to acquire footage of the [[Banaue Rice Terraces]] at [[Ifugao]], [[Philippines]].&lt;ref name="PhilippinesFilming" /&gt;

Later in July 2017, Joe Russo stated there were a couple of unfinished scenes for ''Infinity War'' that would be shot "in the next few months".&lt;ref name="AdditionalShooting" /&gt; In early March 2018, Disney moved the release of ''Infinity War'' in the United States to April 27, 2018, to have it be released the same weekend as some of its international markets.&lt;ref name="NewReleaseDate" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NewReleaseDate2" /&gt; Visual effects for the film were created by [[Industrial Light &amp; Magic]],&lt;ref name="ILM" /&gt; [[Framestore]],&lt;ref name="Framestore"/&gt; [[Method Studios]],&lt;ref name="MethodStudios" /&gt; [[Weta Digital]], [[Double Negative (VFX)|Double Negative]], [[Cinesite]], [[Digital Domain]], Rise, Lola VFX, and Perception.&lt;ref name="ArtofVFX" /&gt; With an estimated budget in the range of $316–400&amp;nbsp;million,&lt;ref name="DeadlineProfitAnalysis" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ForbesBudget" /&gt;&lt;ref name="VarietyBudget" /&gt; it is one of the [[List of most expensive films|most expensive films ever made]].&lt;ref name="MostExpensive" /&gt; Evans and Hemsworth both earned $15 million for the film.&lt;ref name="EvansHemsworthPay" /&gt;

==Music==
{{main|Avengers: Infinity War (soundtrack)}}
In June 2016, [[Alan Silvestri]], who composed the score for ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' (2012), was revealed to be returning to score both ''Infinity War'' and its sequel.&lt;ref name="Silvestri" /&gt; Silvestri started to record his score in January 2018,&lt;ref name="ScoreRecording" /&gt; and concluded in late March. Silvestri felt working on the film "was a really different experience than anything I'd done before, especially in regard to the approach and balancing quick shifts in tone".&lt;ref name="SilvestriApr2018" /&gt; [[Ludwig Göransson]]'s theme from ''Black Panther'' is also used in the film.&lt;ref name="SilvestriTHRApr2018" /&gt; [[Hollywood Records]] and [[Marvel Music]] released the soundtrack album digitally on April 27, 2018, with a release on physical formats following on May 18. Two versions were released, a regular and deluxe edition, with the deluxe edition featuring some extended and additional tracks.&lt;ref name="Soundtrack" /&gt;

In May 2017, Robert Downey Jr. and his philanthropic organization Random Act Funding partnered with [[Omaze]] to initiate a contest to benefit the organization. A randomly chosen winner from those that donated would receive an ''Infinity War'' set visit.&lt;ref name="Omaze" /&gt; A life-sized statue of Thanos, created by [[Legacy Effects]], was on display at [[D23 (Disney)#2017|D23 Expo 2017]],&lt;ref name="ThanoStatueD23" /&gt; alongside statues of the [[Black Order (comics)|Black Order]] / "Children of Thanos": [[Corvus Glaive]], [[Proxima Midnight]], [[Ebony Maw]], and [[Black Dwarf (comics)#Film|Cull Obsidian]].&lt;ref name="ChildrenOfThanos" /&gt; Additionally, Feige, Joe Russo, Downey, Brolin, Bettany, Olsen, Klementieff, Gillan, Bautista, Cheadle, Mackie, Cumberbatch, Stan, Holland, Boseman, Ruffalo, and Hemsworth appeared at D23 Expo to present a clip highlighting the 10 years of MCU films, along with footage from ''Infinity War''.&lt;ref name="D232017" /&gt; The footage, which was screened exclusively for the panel,&lt;ref name="THRD23Footage" /&gt; received strong audience reaction, with fans "literally on their feet and jumping as the footage played".&lt;ref name="THRD23Footage" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PolygonD23Footage" /&gt; Julia Alexander of ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'' commented, "to say that there was quite a bit happening in the trailer would be one hell of an understatement." She was excited that the film would deliver on the character interactions in one film and that ''Infinity War'' "finally feels like Marvel has made the movie it always wanted to—and the one we've always wanted to see. For nearly ten years we dreamt of this reality and to see it play across a massive screen... it was impossible to not feel emotional."&lt;ref name="PolygonD23Footage" /&gt; CinemaBlend's Eric Eisenberg said the footage left him "literally shaking", with the film looking "like it could be one of the most epic blockbusters ever created", concluding "the hype [for the film] most definitely feels very, very real".&lt;ref name="CinemaBlendD23Footage" /&gt; Haleigh Foutch for Collider said, "It looks dark and dramatic, and utterly epic. It's clear Marvel is trying to do something different here... to pay off a decade's worth of narrative and world-building. While it's impossible to tell from two minutes work of footage, it certainly looks like that gamble paid off."&lt;ref name="ColliderD23Footage" /&gt; The D23 footage was also shown at the 2017 [[San Diego Comic-Con International]].&lt;ref name="SDCCFootage" /&gt; Due to the two convention presentations, ''Avengers: Infinity War'' generated over 90,000 new conversations on social media from July 17 to 23, the third-most during that time period behind ''Thor: Ragnarok'' and ''[[Justice League (film)|Justice League]]'' (2017), according to [[comScore]] and its PreAct service.&lt;ref name="comScoreComicCon" /&gt; ''Infinity War'' stayed in third the following week, with over 41,000 new social media conversations, behind ''Ragnarok'' and ''[[It (2017 film)|It]]'' (2017).&lt;ref name="comScoreJuly31" /&gt; By the week of October 16, ''Infinity War'' had generated over 679,000 total social media conversations.&lt;ref name="comScoreOct16" /&gt;

To promote the release of the film's first trailer, Marvel released "a retrospective video looking back at some of its best trailers" since ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'' (2008), "paired with fan reaction videos to those trailers".&lt;ref name="RetrospectiveVideo" /&gt; The first trailer for ''Avengers: Infinity War'' debuted on ''[[Good Morning America]]'' on November 29, 2017.&lt;ref name="FirstTrailer" /&gt; Josh Spiegel of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' said, "The trailer promises, in many ways, exactly what anyone with a passing familiarity with superhero movies would expect..." but "the most important part of the trailer is how it carefully, deliberately introduces the notion that the ''Infinity War'' films are going to function as a passing of the torch, from one set of Avengers to a newer group."&lt;ref name="Spiegel_trailer" /&gt; Scott Mendelson, writing for ''[[Forbes]]'', noted that even though the trailer was not much different from the convention footage screened earlier in the year, it was "damn impressive. Moreover, it uses Nick Fury's big 'Avengers Initiative' speech, along with Alan Silvestri's Avengers theme, to excellent effect."&lt;ref name="ForbesTrailer" /&gt; Conversely to Mendelson, Alexander commented on the different marketing strategy for the film between the convention footage scenes and the trailer scenes, feeling the "two couldn't be more different". She noted how the convention footage ("meant to please a crowd running on little sleep and jittery with anticipation") was released between ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2]]'' (2017) and ''Thor: Ragnarok'', and "[i]t made sense to use Thor and the Guardians to hype up [''Infinity War'']" because "Marvel relied on the anticipation of ''Thor: Ragnarok'' and ''Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2''{{'}}s success to excite fans, and footage of older movies set to classic Marvel scores as a way to drive home how this movie is an event in itself." Conversely, the trailer ("designed to explain what's about to happen, teasing it out with additional background") heavily featured Black Panther and [[Wakanda (comics)|Wakanda]], which Alexander said could not have been done earlier, without the additional marketing for ''Black Panther'' that happened after the conventions to provide additional context.&lt;ref name="PolygonTrailer" /&gt; Gael Cooper of [[CNET]] observed that the trailer was viewed nearly 500,000 times in its first 15 minutes after it was posted on [[YouTube]], but questioned if the trailer broke the site after the view counter appeared to be stuck at 467,331.&lt;ref name="Cooper_trailer" /&gt; The trailer was viewed 230&amp;nbsp;million times in its first 24 hours, [[List of most viewed online trailers in the first 24 hours|becoming the most viewed trailer in that time period]], surpassing the record of ''It''.&lt;ref name="TrailerViews" /&gt;

In January 2018, Marvel Comics published a [[Marvel Cinematic Universe tie-in comics|two-issue prequel comic]] titled ''Avengers: Infinity War Prelude'', which serves as a bridge between ''Captain America: Civil War'' and ''Avengers: Infinity War''.&lt;ref name="PreludeComic" /&gt; A commercial for ''Infinity War'' aired during [[Super Bowl LII]]. The ad generated the most social media buzz out of all the films advertised during the Super Bowl, according to comScore and [[United Talent Agency]]; it was viewed 17.6&amp;nbsp;million times across YouTube and [[Facebook]].&lt;ref name="SuperBowl" /&gt; On February 27, 2018, Disney and Marvel announced the Marvel: The Universe Unites charity campaign leading to the release of merchandise for the film on March 3. The week-long event saw stars from the film create social media challenges to provide funds and raise awareness for charities that support children and families impacted by serious illness. If their collective posts reached 1&amp;nbsp;million likes, Marvel said they would make a $250,000 donation to [[Starlight Children's Foundation]]. Additionally, Disney planned to donate 10% of sales of all Marvel products purchased at [[Disney Store]]s in the United States and online on the weekend of March 3 to the [[Make-A-Wish Foundation]], up to $50,000. [[Hasbro]] donated $1&amp;nbsp;million worth of cash and products to [[Give Kids the World Village]] and [[Funko]] made a $1&amp;nbsp;million toy donation to Starlight.&lt;ref name="UniverseUnitesCampaign" /&gt;

A second trailer was released on March 16, 2018, which earned over 1&amp;nbsp;million views on YouTube in less than three hours after it was released.&lt;ref name="Trailer2InitialViews" /&gt; Alyssa Rosenberg of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' was not overly enthused about another superhero film having "special-effects-heavy villains, or the sight of yet {{em|another}} mysterious object hanging over the Manhattan skyline", but felt the trailer made her realize "that I'm actually looking forward to seeing [the characters of the MCU] get to know each other".&lt;ref name="WPTrailer2" /&gt; Spiegel agreed with Rosenberg about the potential for character interactions, noting the trailer "suggests that some of these meetings are going to keep up the playful tone of recent MCU movies". While conceding it was "gimmicky" to have so many "crossover-style introductions or combinations of heroes in a movie like this", he noted "the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe is built on a foundation of these heroes existing within the same space, so their eventual meetings have a level of anticipation that exceeds that of watching them face off against Thanos."&lt;ref name="THRTrailer2" /&gt; The second trailer was viewed 179&amp;nbsp;million times in the first 24 hours, the third-most viewed trailer in that time period, behind the first trailer for the film and ''It'', while also becoming the biggest release for a second trailer, surpassing ''[[Beauty and the Beast (2017 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' (2017) (128&amp;nbsp;million views).&lt;ref name="Trailer2Views" /&gt;

A week before the film's release, the [[Burj Khalifa]] in Dubai was lit up each night for the film, counting down to its release.&lt;ref name="BurjKhalifa" /&gt; Marvel also featured tie-in events across seven of their mobile games to promote the film.&lt;ref name="MarvelGamesTieIn" /&gt; In early May 2018, Marvel and [[Epic Games]] announced the "Infinity Gauntlet Limited Time Mashup" mode for ''[[Fortnite Battle Royale]]'', where players could find the Infinity Gauntlet hidden on the game map and become Thanos with added abilities. The Russo brothers were fans of ''Fortnite'' and approached Donald Mustard, the worldwide creative director of Epic Games, about the potential for a crossover between the properties.&lt;ref name="FortniteCrossover" /&gt; On November 20, 2018, [[Little, Brown and Company]] published ''Marvel's Avengers: Infinity War: Thanos – Titan Consumed'', written by [[Barry Lyga]]. Despite not existing within Marvel Studios' MCU canon, the novel explores the origins of Thanos before the events of the film. Lyga noted he spoke with Marvel Studios to get an "outline of who Thanos is and what he means to the movies", and "was given great latitude and a free hand [in some areas of the story], while in others I had to tip-toe very carefully through the MCU".&lt;ref name="ThanosNovel" /&gt;

Additional marketing partners for the film included [[Coca-Cola]], [[Quicken Loans]] and their Rocket Mortgage service, the [[Infiniti QX50]] (which is also featured in the film), [[Ziploc]], [[Go-Gurt]], [[Yoplait]], [[Synchrony Financial|Synchrony Bank]], [[American Airlines]], and [[Stand Up to Cancer]]. The partners created television commercials "inspired by or featuring the film's characters and themes", interactive digital initiatives, and robust in-store presences at numerous retailers. [[Duracell]], [[Unilever]], [[Quaker Oats Company]], [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]], and [[Samsung]] ran promotions in smaller markets. Coca-Cola, Ziploc, Go-Gurt, and Yoplait created special packaging in support of the film, with Synchrony implementing a "Save Like a Hero" campaign, and Stand Up to Cancer and American Airlines launching a national campaign with a [[Public service announcement|PSA]] starring Johansson and Hemsworth. In the United Kingdom, [[OnePlus]] released an ''Infinity War'' edition for one of their smartphones. ''[[Deadline Hollywood]]'' estimated the media value was $150&amp;nbsp;million, the largest for any Marvel film, with Coca-Cola contributing an estimated $40&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="MarketingPartners" /&gt;

==Release==
===Theatrical===
''Avengers: Infinity War'' held its world premiere at the [[Dolby Theatre]] in Los Angeles on April 23, 2018, screening also at the adjacent [[El Capitan Theatre]] and [[Grauman's Chinese Theatre]].&lt;ref name="WorldPremiere" /&gt; It was released in most countries worldwide, including the United States, on April 27, 2018, with a few debuts beginning as early as April 25,&lt;ref name="NewReleaseDate" /&gt; and was shown in [[IMAX]] and [[3D film|3D]] on select screens.&lt;ref name="IMAXRelease" /&gt;&lt;ref name="3DRelease" /&gt; In the United States, the film opened in 4,474 theaters, 408 of which were IMAX; this was the widest release for a Disney title ever and the second-widest ever after ''[[Despicable Me 3]]''{{'}}s 4,529 theaters. Three of [[AMC Theatres]]' locations screened the film for 24 hours straight, with 53 of their locations having showtimes at either 2&amp;nbsp;am or 3&amp;nbsp;am to accommodate demand.&lt;ref name="DeadlineWknd1" /&gt; In India, the film had the biggest release ever for a Hollywood film, opening on nearly 2,000 screens in four languages.&lt;ref name="IndiaRelease" /&gt; The film also screened in 515 [[4DX]] theaters in 59 countries.&lt;ref name="DeadlineWknd2" /&gt; ''Avengers: Infinity War'' was originally scheduled to be released on May 4, 2018 in the United States.&lt;ref name="Oct2014Event" /&gt;&lt;ref name="InfinityWar" /&gt; The Chinese release of the film, which opened on May 11, 2018,&lt;ref name="DeadlineIntWknd2" /&gt; was originally scheduled to end on June 10, 2018, but was granted a "rare" extension of 30 days, to end on July 9, 2018.&lt;ref name="ChinaExtension" /&gt;

Select footage from the film was screened around various cities during the film's press tour in early April, ahead of the film's Los Angeles premiere. The Russos noted that only a limited amount of the film would be shown at these screenings to reduce the chance of spoilers being leaked. Adam Chitwood of [[Collider (website)|Collider]] commented that this was "highly unusual as most Marvel movies are screened in their entirety for press about a month before they hit theaters".&lt;ref name="PressTourFootage" /&gt; Ahead of the United States release, AMC Theatres in New York City and Orlando, Florida aired an eleven-MCU film marathon beginning on April 25, leading to a screening of ''Infinity War''. The El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles also had a similar marathon ahead of the film's release.&lt;ref name="MCUMarathon" /&gt;

===Home media===
''Avengers: Infinity War'' was released on [[Digital distribution|digital download]] by [[Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment]] on July 31, 2018, and on [[Ultra HD Blu-ray]], [[Blu-ray]], and [[DVD]] on August 14. The digital and Blu-ray releases include behind-the-scenes featurettes, audio commentary, deleted scenes, and a blooper reel. The digital release also features a roundtable discussion between MCU directors the Russos, Jon Favreau, [[Joss Whedon]], James Gunn, [[Ryan Coogler]], [[Peyton Reed]], and Taika Waititi.&lt;ref name="HomeMedia" /&gt; In terms of home media sales, the physical versions of the film were collectively the top home media release of the week in which they were first released.&lt;ref name="HomeMediaSales" /&gt;

Despite being shot with IMAX cameras and releasing in IMAX theaters in that [[aspect ratio]], the IMAX version of the film was not released on the home media, instead including a [[Cropping (image)|cropped]] [[Anamorphic format#Aspect Ratio|2.39:1 aspect ratio]].&lt;ref name="ForbesBluRayRatio" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SlashFilmColliderQ&amp;A" /&gt; Joe Russo said they "spent a long time trying to" have the IMAX version on the home media, but since the [[IMAX Corporation]] has "agency over that format", the situation was "complicated".&lt;ref name="SuperHeroHypeColliderQ&amp;A" /&gt; He did not rule out the possibility that this version could be available at a later point.&lt;ref name="SlashFilmColliderQ&amp;A" /&gt;

====Pre-sale ticket records====
In December 2017, a survey from [[Fandango (company)|Fandango]] indicated that ''Infinity War'' was the most anticipated film of 2018.&lt;ref name="FandangoSurvey" /&gt; Fandango later reported that ''Infinity War'' achieved the largest initial 24-hour ticket pre-sales for a superhero film, taking just 6 hours to surpass the previous 24-hour record set by ''Black Panther''. Atom Tickets reported that ''Infinity War'' sold more tickets in its first pre-sales day than ''Black Panther'' sold in its first month.&lt;ref name="FandangoAtomPresales" /&gt; Within 72 hours, the film generated the largest pre-sales for any superhero film at AMC Theatres, with its advance ticket sales being 257.6% ahead of ''Black Panther''{{'}}s, 751.5% ahead of ''Captain America: Civil War'', and 1,106.5% ahead of ''Avengers: Age of Ultron'' during the same time frame.&lt;ref name="AMCAdvanceTickets" /&gt; Two weeks before its release, Fandango revealed that advance ticket sales for ''Infinity War'' were outpacing the last seven MCU films combined in the same timeframe, and had become the company's top April release. It was also on pace to become the top superhero film.&lt;ref name="FandangoOutpacing" /&gt; A week before the film released, ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' said the film had sold more than $50&amp;nbsp;million worth of advance tickets, behind only ''The Force Awakens'' and ''[[Star Wars: The Last Jedi]]'' (2017),&lt;ref name="WSJAdvancedTickets" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DeadlineWknd1" /&gt; with Fandango reporting that more than 2,500 showtimes had sold out. On Atom Tickets, ''Infinity War'' had the most pre-sale volume, selling 7% higher than ''The Last Jedi'' and 250% higher than ''Black Panther'' at the same point in their sales. Atom also reported that ticket sales for ''Infinity War'' were doubling daily the week of its release, the fastest rate of increase the service has seen for any MCU title.&lt;ref name="DeadlineWknd1" /&gt;

====United States and Canada====
''Avengers: Infinity War'' earned $106.7&amp;nbsp;million on its opening day in the United States and Canada (including $39&amp;nbsp;million from Thursday night previews), for an opening weekend total of $258.2&amp;nbsp;million. The Thursday night preview earning was the best for an MCU film (beating ''Avengers: Age of Ultron''{{'}}s $27.6&amp;nbsp;million) and the fourth-best of all time, behind ''The Force Awakens'' ($57&amp;nbsp;million), ''The Last Jedi'' ($45&amp;nbsp;million) and ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows&amp;nbsp;– Part 2]]'' (2011) ($43.5&amp;nbsp;million).

IMAX contributed $22.5&amp;nbsp;million to the opening weekend gross, which was the best opening for a Marvel film in the format and the third-biggest opening, behind ''The Force Awakens'' ($30&amp;nbsp;million) and ''The Last Jedi'' ($24.7&amp;nbsp;million). AMC reported that the film had the highest Friday and Saturday box office gross for a single title in the company's history, while Fandango reported that approximately $84&amp;nbsp;million worth of tickets were sold through the service, approximately 30%, which was the largest share of the weekend box office for any film in the company's history.&lt;ref name="DeadlineWknd1" /&gt; ''Avengers: Infinity War'' earned an additional $25&amp;nbsp;million the Monday after its opening weekend, which was the highest grossing Monday in April, beating ''[[Furious 7]]'' (2015) ($14&amp;nbsp;million), and the second-best Monday gross for an MCU film, after ''Black Panther'' ($40.1&amp;nbsp;million).&lt;ref name="DeadlineWknd1Monday" /&gt; The next day, it earned $23.5&amp;nbsp;million, which was the highest grossing Tuesday for an MCU film, beating ''Black Panther'' ($20.8&amp;nbsp;million), and the highest grossing Tuesday in May, beating ''The Avengers'' ($17.6&amp;nbsp;million). It also tied ''The Force Awakens'' for the fastest to reach $300&amp;nbsp;million at five days.&lt;ref name="DeadlineWknd1Tuesday" /&gt;

The film remained number one in its second weekend, earning $115.5&amp;nbsp;million, which was the second-best second weekend ever after ''The Force Awakens'' ($149.2&amp;nbsp;million). ''Infinity War'' also surpassed $400&amp;nbsp;million in the weekend, doing so in nine days, becoming the second fastest film to reach that mark, again after ''The Force Awakens''{{'}}s eight days.&lt;ref name="DeadlineWknd2" /&gt; In its third weekend, ''Infinity War'' remained number one at the box office, and became the second-fastest film to surpass $500&amp;nbsp;million, doing so in 15 days (behind ''The Force Awakens''{{'}}s 10 days). The weekend also saw its total domestic IMAX gross become $48.1&amp;nbsp;million, which was the highest for any MCU film.&lt;ref name="DeadlineWknd3" /&gt; The film's fourth weekend saw it come in second, behind ''[[Deadpool 2]]'',&lt;ref name="DeadlineWknd4" /&gt; and in its fifth it finished third behind ''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story]]'' and ''Deadpool 2''.&lt;ref name="DeadlineWknd5" /&gt; By May 23, ''Infinity War'' surpassed $600&amp;nbsp;million, becoming the second-fastest film to do so in 26 days, after ''The Force Awakens'' (12 days).&lt;ref name="600Million" /&gt; It remained in the top ten through its ninth weekend.&lt;ref name="TopTenRemain" /&gt; In the United States and Canada, it went on to become the [[List of highest-grossing films in the United States and Canada|fourth highest-grossing film of all time]],&lt;ref name="2Billion" /&gt; and the second highest-grossing superhero film, behind ''Black Panther''.&lt;ref name="BOM Dom"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/alltime/domestic.htm |title=''All Time Domestic Grosses'' |publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]] |accessdate=June 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical response===
[[File:Josh Brolin SDCC 2014.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Josh Brolin]]'s performance as Thanos was praised by many critics.&lt;ref name="RTRoundUp" /&gt;]]
The [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported an 84% approval rating based on 397 reviews, and an average rating of 7.5/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "''Avengers: Infinity War'' ably juggles a dizzying array of MCU heroes in the fight against their gravest threat yet, and the result is a thrilling, emotionally resonant blockbuster that (mostly) realizes its gargantuan ambitions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/avengers_infinity_war |title=Avengers: Infinity War (2018) |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate=November 25, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Metacritic]], which uses a [[weighted average]], assigned the film a score of 68 out of 100, based on 53 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/avengers-infinity-war |title=Avengers: Infinity War Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |accessdate=April 30, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of "A" on an A+ to F scale,&lt;ref name="DeadlineWknd1" /&gt; while [[PostTrak]] reported filmgoers gave it an 87% overall positive score and a 68% "definite recommend".&lt;ref name="DeadlineWknd2" /&gt;

[[Todd McCarthy]] of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' praised the writers' and directors' ability to balance the large cast of characters, saying, "...writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely and directors Anthony and Joe Russo, under the supervision of Marvel Films maestro Kevin Feige, acknowledge the traffic jam of egos and play it for laughs".&lt;ref name="THRReview" /&gt; [[Owen Gleiberman]] of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' concurred, stating, "''Infinity War'' is a brashly entertaining jamboree, structured to show off each hero or heroine and give them just enough to do, and to update their mythologies without making it all feel like homework."&lt;ref name="VarietyReview" /&gt; ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s [[Peter Travers]] said the film is "too much of a good thing" and wrote, "The Russo brothers have clearly never learned the concept that less is more. They've used the premise of an Avengers reunion to put on a fireworks explosion of action and laughs that won't quit."&lt;ref name="RollingStoneReview" /&gt; [[Richard Roeper]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' called it Marvel's "biggest and most ambitious movie yet", but concluded "it's certainly not the best. However, there's plenty of action, humor and heart—and some genuinely effective dramatic moments." Roeper went on to praise the film's cast and Josh Brolin in particular, whom he called "the film's most interesting performance".&lt;ref name="SunTimesReview" /&gt; Gleiberman called Brolin's motion capture performance "supremely effective" and said, "Brolin infuses Thanos with his slit-eyed manipulative glower, so that the evil in this movie never feels less than personal."&lt;ref name="VarietyReview" /&gt; McCarthy wrote, "Brolin's calm, considered reading of the character bestows this conquering beast with an unexpectedly resonant emotional dimension, making him much more than a thick stick figure of a supervillain." McCarthy also praised the film's action sequences, saying "''Infinity War'' brims with tensely spectacular combat sequences, even if the question of who's going to win each one has that extravagantly arbitrary could-[[Mighty Mouse|Mighty-Mouse]]-beat-up-[[Superman]]? quality."&lt;ref name="THRReview" /&gt; Gleiberman called the scale of the action, "astonishing",&lt;ref name="VarietyReview" /&gt; and Travers wrote, "''Avengers: Infinity War'' leaves viewers up in the air, feeling exhilarated and cheated at the same time, aching for a closure that never comes...at least not yet."&lt;ref name="RollingStoneReview" /&gt; Josh Spiegel, also of ''The Hollywood Reporter'', said the film takes "a cue from the ending of ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'' in its super-sized finale; this is the equivalent of [[Han Solo]] frozen in the carbonite, on steroids."&lt;ref name="EmpireStrikesBack" /&gt;

[[A. O. Scott]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' criticized the film's reliance on other films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, saying, "Considered on its own, as a single, nearly 2-hour-40-minute movie, ''Avengers: Infinity War'' makes very little sense", but conceded that it "was never meant to be viewed or judged in isolation".&lt;ref name="NYTReview" /&gt; [[Richard Brody]] of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' agreed, stating, "The insubstantiality of the film isn't due to the infinite yet flimsy malleability of C.G.I. gimmickry but, instead, to the dispersion of its drama throughout the many cinematic installations set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe."&lt;ref name="NewYorkerReview" /&gt; [[Stephanie Zacharek]] of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' said, "[It] isn't really a beginning, but more of a middle or an end with a new piece of yarn attached. You need to have seen and internalized every one of the previous 18 Marvel Cinematic Universe movies to fully get it."&lt;ref name="TimeReview" /&gt; [[Justin Chang]] of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' called it a "brisk, propulsive, occasionally rousing and borderline-gutsy continuation of a saga that finally and sensibly seems to be drawing to a close", but called its ultimate bid for catharsis "unsuccessful", saying, "Not even the threat of universal annihilation, it seems, will keep this assembly line from chugging ahead with its signature polished, mechanized efficiency."&lt;ref name="LATReview" /&gt; Scott also criticized the action sequences, calling them "tedious and predictable" and writing, "The noisy, bloated spectacles of combat were surely the most expensive parts of the movie, but the money seems less like an imaginative tool than a substitute for genuine imagination."&lt;ref name="NYTReview" /&gt; Likewise, Zacharek said, "There's no pacing in ''Avengers: Infinity War''. It's all sensation and no pulse. Everything is big, all of the time."&lt;ref name="TimeReview" /&gt;

===Audience response===
American YouTube personality Tony "Nem" Mitchell watched the film 103 times in theaters, a world record. When Mitchell's streak was gaining media awareness around his 44th viewing, he noted that IMAX reached out to give him 50 free tickets to continue the streak, and the Russo brothers invited him to the sequel's premiere.&lt;ref name="NemViewingPolygon" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NemViewingComicBook" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NemViewingTwitter" /&gt; Mitchell said this was the way he "want[ed] to support Marvel and the Russo brothers."&lt;ref name="NemViewingPolygon" /&gt; Seventeen-year-old Kieran Harvey from [[Staffordshire]] also watched the film in theaters 100 times. Harvey stated that he "didn't plan on seeing it this many times it just sort of happened" adding that ''Infinity War'' "just felt so different to anything I've ever seen before, and I just love it so much so have been going as much as I can!"&lt;ref name="HarveyViewing" /&gt;

The ending of the film sparked various [[Internet meme]] reactions,&lt;ref name="CBRMemes" /&gt; particularly one related to Spider-Man saying he does not feel good as he disintegrates, which was applied to other aspects of pop culture.&lt;ref name="SpideyFadeMeme" /&gt; The website, ''DidThanosKill.Me'' was created for fans to see if they would have been spared by Thanos or not.&lt;ref name="DidThanosKillMeWebsite" /&gt; The ending also spawned the creation of the [[Reddit]] subreddit, /r/thanosdidnothingwrong. A user within the subreddit suggested that half of the approximately 20,000 subscribers at the time be banned from the subreddit, in order to mimic the events of the film. After the community agreed to the measure, the moderators approached Reddit's administrators to see if the mass ban would even be possible. Once the administrators agreed to the random ban of half the subscribers, it was set to occur on July 9, 2018.&lt;ref name="PolygonRedditBan" /&gt; Notice of the impending ban made the subreddit's subscribers increase to over 700,000,&lt;ref name="GizmodoRedditBan" /&gt; including both of the Russos who subscribed.&lt;ref name="RussosRedditBan" /&gt; Ahead of the ban, Brolin posted a video saying "Here we go, Reddit users," and ending it with a snap.&lt;ref name="BrolinRedditBan" /&gt; Over 60,000 people watched a live [[Twitch.tv|Twitch]] stream of the ban occurring, which lasted a couple hours.&lt;ref name="GizmodoRedditBan" /&gt; The ban of over 300,000 accounts, which included Anthony Russo, was the largest in Reddit's history.&lt;ref name="GizmodoRedditBan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="VergeRedditBan" /&gt; Those banned then gathered in the new subreddit, /r/inthesoulstone.&lt;ref name="PolygonRedditBan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GizmodoRedditBan" /&gt; One Reddit user who participated felt the ban "embodie[d] the spirit of the Internet" with people "banding together, en masse, around something relatively meaningless but somehow decidedly awesome and hilarious."&lt;ref name="VergeRedditBan" /&gt; Andrew Tigani of [[Screen Rant]] spoke of the ban and how /r/thanosdidnothingwrong "only speaks to how impactful the film has already become to pop culture. It is also a testament to how valuable fan interaction can be via social media."&lt;ref name="BrolinRedditBan" /&gt;

'''Bonk Business''' is a [[fictional corporation]] created by Finnish artist and sculptor [[Alvar Gullichsen]]. The "products of Bonk Business" are absurd machines, such as the ''paranormal cannon'', that have no apparent use, and which are built by Gullichsen. The story is that Bonk machines are powered by anchovy oil. The works parody corporate and marketing cliches in a [[retrofuturistic]] style.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/01/bonk.html The Finnish Company that's Never Done|Fast Company]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Uusikaupunki]], there is a Bonk museum,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bonkcentre.fi/ Bonk Museum]&lt;/ref&gt; where Bonk machines are displayed.

==Idea==

Far from the consumptive aspect, which is closely connected to the nature of the field of graphic design as one of the applied arts, this project is based on exploring new design approaches that depends on the coincidence in its construction. The project relies on the idea of the [[Exquisite Corpse]] game, which was founded in 1925. The rules of the game were used to generate a succession of designs, as each participant will use the endpoint created by the previous designer to start his contribution. Each design consists of four consecutive contributions.

Six Graphic designers participated in *[https://web.archive.org/web/20100304164014/http://www.breakingboredomproject.com/ Breaking Boredom Project] to create twelve designs according to particular rules that differ from the traditional thinking patterns.

A '''Brunaille''' is a painting executed entirely or primarily in shades of brown.  Such a painting is described as having been painted "''en brunaille''".&lt;ref&gt;Christie’s, ''Sale 2437, Old Master Pictures'', lot 51, Amsterdam, Christie’s, 8 November 1999&lt;/ref&gt;  

''Brunaille'' has its roots in 12th century [[stained glass]] made for [[Cistercians|Cistercian]] monasteries,  which prohibited the use of colored art in 1134. However, it was only in the early 17th century that the French term “''brunaille''” was coined to describe pictures painted in shades of brown.&lt;ref&gt; Christie’s, ''Sale 1380, Old Master Paintings'', lot 49, New York, Christie’s, 17 June 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Brunaille are less common than paintings executed in grey (''[[grisaille]]''), though more common than those in green ([[verdaille]]).

Geophagia is the practice of eating the earth, including soil and chalk. This practice is neither new nor outdated and can be associated with religious beliefs, medication or as part of a regular diet.&lt;ref name=[4] /&gt;&lt;ref name=[5] /&gt;&lt;ref name=[6] /&gt;  This act can expose the consumer to [[Toxic Substances|toxic substances]] and parasites found in the ingested earth.&lt;ref name=[5] /&gt;

== Name ==

Calabash chalk is identified by different names such as: calabar stone (English), ''la craie'' or ''argile'' (French), ''mabele'' (Lingala in Congo), ''nzu'' ([[Igbo people|Igbo]] of Nigeria), ''ndom'' (Efik/Ibibio Nigeria) ''eko'' (Bini/Edo Nigeria). In addition it is also known as ''ebumba'', ''poto'' and ''ulo''. &lt;ref name=[1] /&gt;&lt;ref name=[5] /&gt; In [[Ghana]] it is known as ''shilè''.

== Location ==

Calabash chalk is found predominantly in Nigeria and other West African communities. Although this geophagic material is native to Africa, as a result of migration of West African's to other nations, it can also be found in ethnic stores in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], [[Canada]] and the [[United States|US]].&lt;ref name=[1] /&gt;&lt;ref name=[6] /&gt; Calabash chalk is also eaten amongst women of African descent in the US state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].&lt;ref name=[6] /&gt;

== Composition ==

Calabash chalk is a naturally occurring material composed of fossilized sea shells. However it can also be prepared artificially by combining clay, sand, [[wood ash]] and even salt. By molding and heating this mixture, the calabash chalk is obtained.&lt;ref name=[5] /&gt; It is available as a powder, a molded shape or a block.&lt;ref name=[4] /&gt;&lt;ref name=[5] /&gt;

There are different views concerning the components of calabash chalk, the consensus being that the major component is [[Aluminium silicate|aluminum silicate]] hydroxide. This comes from the [[Kaolinite|kaolin]] clay group, making Al2Si2O5(OH)4 a possible formula for calabash chalk. Aside from aluminum silicate hydroxide, calabash chalk is also known to have very high concentrations of lead. The [[Recommendation (European Union)|European Union recommends]] (Commission Regulation, 2001) the amount of lead in food should not exceed 1&amp;nbsp;mg/kg, however the amount of lead contained in calabash chalk has been reported (Codex Committee of Food Additives and Contaminants, 2003) to be between 10–50&amp;nbsp;mg/kg.
In addition, other reports of its composition include: [[Aluminium|aluminum]], persistent organic pollutants, [[silicon]], alpha lindane, [[endrin]], [[endosulfan]] 11, [[arsenic]], and [[chromium]].&lt;ref name=[4] /&gt;&lt;ref name=[5] /&gt;&lt;ref name=[6] /&gt;

== Uses ==

The practice of eating calabash chalk is observed by both sexes and different age groups of people of African descent, for the purpose of pleasure. However, it is prevalent among women, predominantly during [[pregnancy]], who claim it prevents [[vomiting]], over-salivation and [[nausea]].&lt;ref name=[1] /&gt; Calabash chalk is also used to make facial masks and soaps.&lt;ref name=[6] /&gt;

== Health risks ==

When geophagical materials are consumed and come in contact with [[Gastric acid|digestive fluids]], they have the potential of releasing clinical or sub-clinical toxic effects on an individual.&lt;ref name=[1] /&gt;
There are several reports regarding the health risks of consuming calabash chalk including; the alteration of the normal concentration of [[hemoglobin]], [[red blood cell]] counts and [[erythrocyte sedimentation rate]]. Another possible side effect of eating this geophagia is the alteration of growth rate and de-mineralization in the [[Femur|femur bone]].&lt;ref name=[5] /&gt; Other reports suggest that calabash chalk also causes numerous [[Gastrointestinal disease|gastrointestinal disorders]] such as nausea, [[ulcer]]s and [[gastritis]]. This stems from histomorphological changes that calabash chalk causes to the [[stomach]] and [[oesophagus]].&lt;ref name=[6] /&gt;

'''[[Catsuit]]s''' are a recurring costume for fictional characters in various media, as well as for entertainers, especially for use in musical performances. They are sometimes referred to as "[[bodysuit]]s", especially in reference to a full-body suit worn by a man (although ''bodysuit'' usually refers to a legless garment); ''catsuit'' is typically used only in reference to women.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=bodysuit Bodysuit], [[Reference.com|Dictionary.com]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=catsuit Catsuit], [[Reference.com|Dictionary.com]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The catsuit has been identified as a film-maker's costume of choice for stealth.&lt;ref name=NYTOR&gt;Paula Deitz, ''[https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/20/magazine/origins-of-casual-style.html Origins of Casual Style]'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', 1989-08-20&lt;/ref&gt; In films like  ''[[Irma Vep]]'', ''[[Les Vampires]]'' and ''[[Heroic Trio]]'', crime and catsuits are featured together, as well as its major original use in [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[To Catch a Thief]]''.&lt;ref name=NYTOR/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/05/06/1051987689106.html Danger clad in a catsuit], ''The Age''&lt;/ref&gt;

A trend of bodysuits was observed by film reviewer Alan Farrell in his book ''High Cheekbones, Pouty Lips, Tight Jeans'', and a number or occurrences of the garb{{failed verification|date=August 2014}} in films were mentioned - [[Charlize Theron]] in ''[[Aeon Flux]]'', [[Milla Jovovich]] in the [[Resident Evil: Afterlife|fourth]] and [[Resident Evil: Retribution|fifth]] film of the ''[[Resident Evil]]'' franchise, [[Carrie-Anne Moss]] in ''[[The Matrix]]'', [[Angelina Jolie]] in ''[[Lara Croft: Tomb Raider]]'', [[Kate Beckinsale]] in ''[[Underworld (2003 film)|Underworld]]'', and [[Raquel Welch]] in ''[[Fantastic Voyage]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Farrell, ''High Cheekbones, Pouty Lips, Tight Jeans'', page 15, Lulu.com, 2007, {{ISBN|1-4303-0434-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trend of leather and vinyl catsuits were identified as an attempt to redefine the [[gender role]] of women through films.&lt;ref&gt;Elyce Rae Helford, ''Fantasy Girls'', page 6, Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2000, {{ISBN|0-8476-9834-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theresa L. Geller described the catsuit as a part of the Hollywood ''tough chic'' paradigm in an article published in the journal ''[[Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies|Frontiers]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Geller | first = Theresa L. | title = Queering Hollywood's tough chick: the subversions of sex, race, and nation in "The Long Kiss Goodnight" and "The Matrix | journal = [[Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies]] | volume = 25 | issue = 3 | pages = 8–34 | publisher = University of Nebraska Press via JSTOR | date = 2004 | jstor = 3347316 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; That view was shared by Sherrie A. Inness in her book ''Action Chicks'', which also included computer games and professional wrestling in that paradigm.&lt;ref&gt;Sherrie A. Inness, ''Action Chicks'', page 72, Palgrave Macmillan, 2004, {{ISBN|1-4039-6403-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Action Heroine's Handbook'' describes the catsuit as one of the three options of the first rule of thumb described in the book: "Dress to accentuate your best physical assets".&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Worick, Joe Borgenicht and Larry Jost, ''The Action Heroine's Handbook'', page 73, Quirk Books, 2003, {{ISBN|1-931686-68-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Action Chicks: New Images of Tough Women in Popular Culture'' by Sherrie A. Inness describes catsuits as an iconic garb of female TV and film characters.&lt;ref&gt;Sherrie A.

==Post-modern thesis==
In a [[post-modern]] thesis on the [[superhero]] genre Michael Lecker wrote, "In the superhero genre, clothes do the talking through semiotics, which [Roland] Barthes discusses in depth in his work: The 'first, literal message serves as a support for a second meaning, of a generally affective or ideological order' ([[Roland Barthes]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Roland Barthes]], ''The Fashion System'' (Trans. Matthew Ward and Richard Howard),  page 28, Hill and Wang, 1983&lt;/ref&gt;). The cat suits that adorn the feline hybrid characters in this genre are firstly illustrating their connection to felines. On the ideological level, the costumes signify the attributes that our society has projected onto cats and that the characters embody."&lt;ref&gt;Michael Lecker, [http://www.ohiolink.edu/etd/send-pdf.cgi/Lecker%20Michael.pdf?acc_num=bgsu1174668318 Treacherous, deviant, and submissive: female sexuality represented in the character Catwoman]{{Dead link|date=December 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, [[Bowling Green State University]]&lt;/ref&gt; In another post-modern thesis on [[sadomasochism]] in cinema Andrea Beckmann wrote, "Cinematic SM is twisted into the non-consenting, violent realm of the unhinged that we know it is not. Fetishism is used as an excuse for a bit of titillatory semi-nudity, or to identify the villain – the man in black leather. Horror films, in particular, will happily throw in a leather catsuit or a gratuitous bondage scene to spice up a mediocre script (M Olley, ''Pam Hogg: Warrior queen of the catwalk''&lt;ref&gt;T. Woodward (Ed.), ''The best of skin two'', page 19, Richard Kasak, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;)."&lt;ref&gt;Andrea Beckmann, [http://www.albany.edu/scj/jcjpc/vol8is2/beckmann.pdf Deconstructing myths: the social construction of "sadomasochism" versus "subjugated knowledges" of practitioners of consensual "SM"], [[University of Lincolnshire and Humberside]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
New [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] agent Mike Connelly, assigned to protect [[President-elect of the United States|President-elect]] Jack Cahill, becomes uneasy having to protect a person who is having an affair with a friend's wife. Connelly feels even worse about it after preventing an assassination attempt aboard Cahill's plane where a flight attendant is accidentally killed in the process. Sensing Connelly's discomfort around Cahill, his boss reassigns him to the team that protects the "[[nuclear football]]" as soon as Cahill becomes president.

In the film, the "nuclear football" briefcase contains a high-tech laptop computer, which can only be operated through a two key system (one key operated by the president and the other by the agent on "football duty") along with thumbprint and eye retina scans from the president.

After the newly inaugurated president has been planning a meeting with Fung, the [[President of Taiwan]] to discuss the strained relationship between [[Taiwan]] and the [[China|People's Republic of China]], one of the Secret Service agents returns home to find that his family is being held hostage by some men who are later revealed to be Fung's henchmen. They force him to participate in a plot to steal "the football".  When President Cahill and President Fung are at Taiwan aboard Fung's ship, Fung insists that he feels that peaceful co-existence with mainland China may no longer be possible and that drastic action must be taken to ensure China does not invade Taiwan. Soon afterwards, Fung's henchmen begin killing all the other agents, leaving Mike Connelly as the only loyal Secret Service agent left.

Fung's men, along with Fung's girlfriend Iris, are successful in stealing the football, and Fung forces Cahill to activate it (by knocking him unconscious to get his thumbprint and eye retina scans), explaining that he will use the US's [[ICBM]]s to launch a nuclear strike on China, hoping that this will lead a revolution among his people towards "a new beginning" of Taiwanese freedom and pointing out that since he alone controls all of the US's missiles, he would not have to worry about [[mutually assured destruction]] of both China and the United States, just the United States when China retaliates.

Meanwhile, Vice President Valdez is informed of the situation and Fung makes a phone call to her explaining that he has seized control of the United States' nuclear missiles and will [[nuclear blackmail|launch one]] against Beijing unless both China and the United States  within 24 hours recognize Taiwan's independence and that the United States promises to use its full military might against China if it tries to invade Taiwan. Valdez insists that this would never be possible and later Fung follows through with his threat, launching a [[first strike]] against Beijing using an ICBM from [[Nebraska]].

Valdez first contacts the [[President of Russia]] to assure that the missile is [[Cold War|not targeted]] towards [[Russia]].  Then Valdez contacts Chairman Tzu of China to explain the situation and that the United States did not launch the missile and is therefore not responsible.  She also offers to give Tzu the chance to [[Strategic Defense Initiative|shoot the missile out of the sky]] but Tzu angrily points out that this would be impossible.  It is then that he gives the order to launch a retaliatory strike against the United States using one of China's ICBMs, which he calls "an eye for an eye".  True to his word, the missile is targeted for [[Washington, D.C.]]

After Beijing and later Washington are destroyed, Tzu launches a [[second strike]] using several of China's missiles as [[massive retaliation|further retaliation]] for the destruction of China's capital.  Meanwhile, Iris is revealed to Agent Connelly to be an undercover Chinese agent whose assignment was to recover the football and return it to Beijing.  But even she had no idea Fung would actually launch missiles against her country, and points out that China would no doubt retaliate against the US in response to the attack, thus she points out now they both have a common interest.  Together they are able to escape Fung's ship and follow Fung and the still kidnapped President to [[Hong Kong]].  They are both ultimately successful in taking out all but one of Fung's henchmen.  The last remaining one strangles Iris to death however and continues his search for Agent Connelly.

Meanwhile, Connelly finds President Cahill held at gunpoint by Fung who still has the football.  Fung along with Agent Thornton orders Connelly to surrender or else either Fung or Thornton will kill the President.  It is then Cahill says for Connelly to "remember your duty".  Fung at first thinks he means the duty of protecting the President, but then Connelly points out that he is on football duty and that it's "some other guy's job" to protect the President.  Connelly shoots the President in the leg which [[element of surprise|shocks]] Fung and distracts him just long enough to allow Connelly to take him and Agent Thornton out.  Connelly and President Cahill now are in control of the football and begin the process of deactivating it.  The last of Fung's henchmen however, is able to fatally wound the President before Connelly can take him out.  But not before President Cahill is successfully able to deactivate the football.  By doing so, Vice President Valdez and [[NORAD]] have regained control of the United States' nuclear arsenal.

Valdez gives this news to Chairman Tzu and says that he may now order the destruction of his missiles.  Tzu refuses, thinking Valdez is bluffing.  Valdez then gives the order to NORAD that "Stage One is a go", which Tzu is horrified to find out is in fact a launch of [[counterforce|several of the US' ICBMs]].  Valdez warns Tzu has one minute to destroy his missiles, and if he does, Valdez will destroy her missiles and points out to Tzu that he does not want to know what "[[Nuclear Annihilation|Stage Two]]" is.  Just when it seems all hope is lost however, Tzu complies with Valdez's instructions and destroys all his missiles which soon afterwards Valdez does the same with hers.  Thus a major [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]] was narrowly averted.

'''Collective action ''' refers to action taken together by a group of people whose [[goal]] is to enhance their status and achieve a common objective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1917157/collective-action-problem|title=collective action problem - collective action|website=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a term that has formulations and theories in many areas of the social sciences including psychology, sociology, anthropology, political science and economics.

==The social identity model==
Researchers Martijn van Zomeren, Tom Postmes, and Russell Spears conducted a meta-analysis of over 180 studies of collective action, in an attempt to integrate three dominant socio-psychological perspectives explaining antecedent conditions to this phenomenon – injustice, efficacy, and identity.&lt;ref name="van Zomeren, Postmes, &amp; Spears (2008)"&gt;{{cite journal|last = van Zomeren|first = M.|last2=Postmes|first2=T.|last3=Spears|first3=R.|title = Toward an integrative social identity model of collective action: A quantitative research synthesis of three socio-psychological perspectives |journal = Psychological Bulletin|volume = 134| issue = 4| pages = 504–535|year = 2008|doi = 10.1037/0033-2909.134.4.504|pmid = 18605818|ref = harv|citeseerx = 10.1.1.576.5638}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their resultant 2008 review article, an integrative Social Identity Model of Collective Action (SIMCA) was proposed which accounts for interrelationships among the three predictors as well as their predictive capacities for collective action.&lt;ref name="van Zomeren, Postmes, &amp; Spears (2008)"/&gt; An important assumption of this approach is that people tend to respond to subjective states of disadvantage, which may or may not flow from objective physical and social reality.

===Perceived injustice===
Examining collective action through perceived injustice was initially guided by [[Relative deprivation theory|relative deprivation theory (RDT)]]. RDT focuses on a subjective state of unjust disadvantage, proposing that engaging in fraternal (group-based) social comparisons with others may result in feelings of relative deprivation that foster collective action. Group-based emotions resulting from perceived injustice, such as anger, are thought to motivate collective action in an attempt to rectify the state of unfair deprivation.&lt;ref name="van Zomeren, Postmes, &amp; Spears (2008)"/&gt; The extent to which individuals respond to this deprivation involves several different factors and varies from extremely high to extremely low across different settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ostrom|first1=Elinor|title=Collective Action and the Evolution of Social Norms|journal=The Journal of Economic Perspectives|volume=14|issue=3|pages=137–158|doi=10.1257/jep.14.3.137|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Meta-analysis results confirm that effects of injustice causally predict collective action, highlighting the theoretical importance of this variable.&lt;ref name="van Zomeren, Postmes, &amp; Spears (2008)"/&gt;

===Perceived efficacy===
Moving beyond RDT, scholars suggested that in addition to a sense of injustice, people must also have the objective, structural resources necessary to [[Resource mobilization|mobilize change]] through social protest. An important psychological development saw this research instead directed towards subjective expectations and beliefs that unified effort (collective action) is a viable option for achieving group-based goals – this is referred to as perceived collective efficacy. Empirically, collective efficacy is shown to causally affect collective action among a number of populations across varied contexts.&lt;ref name="van Zomeren, Postmes, &amp; Spears (2008)"/&gt;

===Social identity===
[[Social identity theory]] (SIT) suggests that people strive to achieve and maintain positive social identities associated with their group memberships.&lt;ref name="Tajfel &amp; Turner (1979)"&gt;{{cite journal|last = Tajfel|first = H.|last2=Turner|first2=J.C.|title = An integrative theory of inter-group conflict. In W.G. Austin &amp; S. Worchel (Eds.)|journal = The Social Psychology of Inter-group Relations|volume = |pages= 33–47|year = 1979|ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where a group membership is disadvantaged (for example, low status), SIT implicates three variables in the evocation of collective action to improve conditions for the group – permeability of group boundaries,&lt;ref name="Wright, Taylor &amp; Moghaddam (1990)"&gt;{{cite journal| author1 = Stephen C. Wright | author2 = Donald M. Taylor | author3 = Fathali M. Moghaddam |title = Responding to Membership in a Disadvantaged Group: From Acceptance to Collective Protest |journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology| volume = 58|pages = 994–1003|year = June 1990| doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.58.6.994|issue = 6|ref = harv| url = http://digitool.Library.McGill.CA:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=64044 | format = Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; legitimacy of the intergroup structures, and the stability of these relationships. For example, when disadvantaged groups perceive intergroup status relationships as illegitimate and unstable, collective action is predicted to occur, in an attempt to change status structures for the betterment of the disadvantaged group.

Meta-analysis results also confirm that social identity causally predicts collective action across a number of diverse contexts. Additionally, the integrated SIMCA affords another important role to social identity – that of a psychological bridge forming the collective base from which both collective efficacy and group injustice may be conceived.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

===Model refinement===
While there is sound empirical support for the causal importance of SIMCA’s key theoretical variables on collective action,&lt;ref name="van Zomeren, Postmes, &amp; Spears (2008)"/&gt; more recent literature has addressed the issue of reverse causation, finding support for a related, yet distinct, encapsulation model of social identity in collective action (EMSICA).&lt;ref name="Thomas, Mavor &amp; McGarty (2011)"&gt;{{cite journal|last = Thomas|first = E.F.|last2=Mavor|first2=K.I.|last3=McGarty|first3=C.|title = Social identities facilitate and encapsulate action-relevant constructs: A test of the social identity model of collective action|journal = Group Processes and Intergroup Relations|volume = 15| issue = 1| pages = 75–88|year = 2011|doi = 10.1177/1368430211413619|ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; This model suggests that perceived group efficacy and perceived injustice provide the basis from which social identity emerges, highlighting an alternative causal pathway to collective action. Recent research has sought to integrate SIMCA with [[Contact hypothesis|intergroup contact theory]] (see Cakal, Hewstone, Schwär, &amp; Heath&lt;ref name="Cakal, Hewstone, Schwär &amp; Heath (2011)"&gt;{{cite journal|last = Cakal|first = H.|last2=Hewstone|first2=M.|last3=Schwär|first3=G.|last4=Heath|first4=A.|title = An investigation of the social identity model of collective action and the 'sedative' effect of intergroup contact among Black and White students in South Africa|journal = British Journal of Social Psychology|volume = 50| pages = 606–627|year = 2011|doi = 10.1111/j.2044-8309.2011.02075.x|pmid = 22122025|issue = 4|ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and others have extended SIMCA through bridging morality research with the collective action literature (see van Zomeren, Postmes, &amp; Spears&lt;ref name="van Zomeren, Postmes, &amp; Spears (2012)"&gt;{{cite journal|last = van Zomeren|first = M.|last2=Postmes|first2=T.|last3=Spears|first3=R.|title = On conviction's collective consequences: Integrating moral conviction with the social identity model of collective action|journal = British Journal of Social Psychology|volume = 51| pages = 52–71|year = 2012|doi = 10.1111/j.2044-8309.2010.02000.x|pmid = 22435846|issue = 1|ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; for a review).

==Public good==
The economic theory of collective action is concerned with the provision of [[public good]]s (and other collective consumption) through the [[collaboration]] of two or more individuals, and the impact of [[externality|externalities]] on group behavior. It is more commonly referred to as [[Public Choice]].  [[Mancur Olson]]'s 1965 book ''[[The Logic of Collective Action|The Logic of Collective Action: Public Goods and the Theory of Groups]],'' is an important early analysis of the problems of public good cost.

Besides economics, the theory has found many applications in [[political science]], [[sociology]], [[communication]], [[anthropology]] and [[environmentalism]].

===Collective action problem===
{{main|Collective action problem}}
The term collective action problem describes the situation in which multiple individuals would all benefit from a certain action, but has an associated cost making it implausible that any individual can or will undertake and solve it alone. The ideal solution is then to undertake this as a collective action, the cost of which is shared. Situations like this include the [[prisoner's dilemma]], a collective action problem in which no communication is allowed, the [[free rider problem]], and the [[tragedy of the commons]], also known as the problem with open access.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Agar|first1=Jesse|title=Tragedy of the Commons │ The Problem with Open Access|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYA1y405JW0|website=Youtube|publisher=This Place (youtube channel)|accessdate=Jun 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An allegorical metaphor often used to describe the problem is "[[belling the cat]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Dowding |first=Keith |authorlink=Keith Dowding |year=1996 |title=Power |pages=31&amp;nbsp;''ff.'' |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |isbn= 978-0-8166-2941-1 |ref=harv |postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Solutions to collective action problems include mutually binding agreements, government regulation, privatisation, and [[assurance contract]]s, also known as crowdacting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=van den Akker|first1=Ron|title=Crowdacting|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6tqZqoh8DY|website=YouTube|publisher=Bord&amp;Stift|accessdate=Sep 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exploitation of the great by the small===
[[Mancur Olson]] made the claim that individual [[Rational choice theory|rational choice]] leads to situations where individuals with more resources will carry a higher burden in the provision of the public good than poorer ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document|last=Olson|first=Mancur|title=logic of collective action: Public goods and the theory of groups|year=1965|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, MA|ref=harv|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- why exactly is this so controversial? --&gt; Poorer individuals will usually have little choice but to opt for the [[Free rider problem|free rider]] strategy, i.e., they will attempt to benefit from the public good without contributing to its provision. This may also encourage the under-production (inefficient production) of the public good.

===Institutional design===
While public goods are often provided by governments, this is not always the case.  Various institutional designs have been studied with the aim of reducing the collaborative failure.  The best design for a given situation depends on the production costs, the utility function, and the collaborative effects, amongst other things.  Here are only some examples:

====Joint products====
A joint-product model analyzes the collaborative effect of joining a private good to a public good.  For example, a tax deduction (private good) can be tied to a donation to a charity (public good).

It can be shown that the provision of the public good increases when tied to the private good, as long as the private good is provided by a monopoly (otherwise the private good would be provided by competitors without the link to the public good).

====Clubs====
Some institutional design, e.g., [[Intellectual property|intellectual property rights]], can introduce an exclusion mechanism and turn a pure [[public good]] into an impure public good artificially.

If the costs of the exclusion mechanism are not higher than the gain from the [[collaboration]], clubs can emerge.  [[James M. Buchanan]] showed in his seminal paper that clubs can be an efficient alternative to government interventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Buchanan|first=James M.|title=An Economic Theory of Clubs|journal=Economica|year=1965|volume=32|pages=1–14|jstor=2552442|doi=10.2307/2552442|issue=125|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[nation]] can be seen as a club whose members are its citizens. Government would then be the manager of this club.

====Federated structure====
In some cases, theory shows that collaboration emerges spontaneously in smaller groups rather than in large ones (see e.g. [[Dunbar's number]]). This explains why [[trade union|labor unions]] or [[Charitable organization|charities]] often have a federated structure.

==In philosophy==
Since the late 20th century, analytic philosophers have been exploring the nature of collective action in the sense of acting together, as when people paint a house together, go for a walk together, or together execute a pass play. These particular examples have been central for three of the philosophers who have made well known contributions to this literature:  [[Michael Bratman]], [[Margaret Gilbert]], and [[John Searle]], respectively.

In {{Harv|Gilbert|1989}} and subsequent articles and book chapters including Gilbert (2006, chapter 7) Gilbert argues for an account of collective action according to which this rests on a special kind of interpersonal commitment, what Gilbert calls a "joint commitment". A joint commitment in Gilbert's sense is not a matter of a set of personal commitments independently created by each of the participants, as when each makes a personal decision to do something. Rather, it is a single commitment to whose creation each participant makes a contribution. Thus suppose that one person says "Shall we go for a walk?" and the other says "Yes, let's". Gilbert proposes that as a result of this exchange the parties are jointly committed to go for a walk, and thereby obligated to one another to act as if they were parts of a single person taking a walk. Joint commitments can be created less explicitly and through processes that are more extended in time. One merit of a joint commitment account of collective action, in Gilbert's view, is that it explains the fact that those who are out on a walk together, for instance, understand that each of them is in a position to demand corrective action of the other if he or she acts in ways that affect negatively the completion of their walk. In {{Harv|Gilbert|2006a}} she discusses the pertinence of joint commitment to collective actions in the sense of the theory of rational choice.

In Searle (1990) Searle argues that what lies at the heart of a collective action is the presence in the mind of each participant of a "we-intention". Searle does not give an account of we-intentions or, as he also puts it, "[[collective intentionality]]", but insists that they are distinct from the "I-intentions" that animate the actions of persons acting alone.

In Bratman (1993) Bratman proposed that, roughly, two people "share an intention" to paint a house together when each intends that the house is painted by virtue of the activity of each, and also intends that it is so painted by virtue of the intention of each that it is so painted. That these conditions obtain must also be "common knowledge" between the participants.

Discussion in this area continues to expand, and has influenced discussions in other disciplines including anthropology, developmental psychology, and economics. One general question is whether it is necessary to think in terms that go beyond the personal intentions of individual human beings properly to characterize what it is to act together. Bratman's account does not go beyond such personal intentions. Gilbert's account, with its invocation of joint commitment, does go beyond them. Searle's account does also, with its invocation of [[collective intentionality]]. The question of whether and how one must account for the existence of mutual obligations when there is a collective intention is another of the issues in this area of inquiry.

==Spontaneous consensus==

In addition to the psychological mechanisms of collective action as explained by the [[Collective action#The social identity model|social identity model]], researchers have developed sociological models of why collective action exists and have studied under what conditions collective action emerges.&lt;ref name="Baronchelli (2017)"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Baronchelli |first=Andrea |arxiv=1704.07767|title=The Emergence of Consensus |journal=Royal Society Open Science |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=172189 |date=2017 |bibcode=2018RSOS....572189B |doi=10.1098/rsos.172189 |pmid=29515905 |pmc=5830794 |year=1721 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Along this social dimension, a special case of the general collective action problem is one of collective agreement: how does a group of agents (humans, animals, robots, etc.) reach consensus about a decision or belief in the absence of central organization? Common examples can be found from domains as diverse as biology ([[flocking (behavior)|flocking]], [[shoaling and schooling]], and general [[collective animal behavior]]), economics ([[Herd behavior#Stock market bubbles|stock market bubbles]]), and sociology ([[Convention (norm)#Social|social conventions]] and [[Norm (social)|norms]]) among others.

Consensus is distinct from the [[Collective action#Collective action problem|collective action problem]] in that there often is not an explicit goal, benefit, or cost of action but rather it concerns itself with a [[social equilibrium]] of the individuals involved (and their beliefs). And it can be considered '''''spontaneous''''' when it emerges without the presence of a centralized [[institution]] among self-interested individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sugden |first1=Robert |date=1989 |title=Spontaneous order |journal=The Journal of Economic Perspectives |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=85–97 |doi=10.1257/jep.3.4.85 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dimensions===

Spontaneous consensus can be considered along 4 dimensions involving the social structure of the individuals participating (local versus global) in the consensus as well as the processes (competitive vs cooperative) involved in reaching consensus:&lt;ref name="Baronchelli (2017)"/&gt;

* Competitive
* Cooperative
* Local
* Global

====Competitive versus cooperative====

The underlying processes of spontaneous consensus can be viewed either as ''cooperation'' among individuals trying to coordinate themselves through their interactions or as ''competition'' between the alternatives or choices to be decided upon.&lt;ref name="Baronchelli (2017)"/&gt; Depending on the dynamics of the individuals involved as well as the context of the alternatives considered for consensus, the process can be wholly cooperative, wholly competitive, or a mix of the two.

====Local versus global====

The distinction between local and global consensus can be viewed in terms of the social structure underlying the network of individuals participating in the consensus making process. ''Local consensus'' occurs when there is agreement between groups of neighboring nodes while ''global consensus'' refers to the state in which most of the population has reached an agreement.&lt;ref name="Baronchelli (2017)"/&gt; How and why consensus is reached is dependent on both the structure of the social network of individuals as well as the presence (or lack) of centralized [[institutions]].

===Equilibrium mechanisms===

There are many mechanisms (social and psychological) that have been identified to underlie the consensus making process.&lt;ref name="Baronchelli (2017)"/&gt; They have been used to both explain the emergence of spontaneous consensus and understand how to facilitate an equilibrium between individuals and can be grouped according to their role in the process.

===Methods and techniques===

Due to the interdisciplinary nature of both the mechanisms as well as the applications of spontaneous consensus, a variety of techniques have been developed to study the emergence and evolution of spontaneous cooperation. Two of the most widely used are [[game theory]] and [[social network analysis]].

====Game theory====

Traditionally [[game theory]] has been used to study [[zero-sum games]] but has been extended to many [[Game Theory#game types|different types of games]]. Relevant to the study of spontaneous consensus are [[Cooperative game theory|cooperative]] and [[non-cooperative game theory|non-cooperative]] games. Since a consensus must be reached without the presence of any external authoritative institution for it to be considered ''spontaneous'', non-cooperative games and [[nash equilibrium]] have been the dominant paradigm for which to study its emergence.

In the context of non-cooperative games, a consensus is a formal [[nash equilibrium]] that all players tend towards through [[Self-enforcing agreement|self-enforcing]] alliances or agreements.

====Social network analysis====

An alternative approach to studying the emergence of spontaneous consensus—that avoids many of the unnatural or overly constrained assumptions of game theoretic models—is the use of network based methods and social network analysis (SNA). These SNA models are theoretically grounded in the communication mechanism&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; of facilitating consensus and describe its emergence through the information propagation processes of the network ([[behavioral contagion]]). Through the spread of influence (and ideas) between agents participating in the consensus, local and global consensus can emerge if the agents in the network achieve a shared equilibrium state. Leveraging this model of consensus, researchers have shown that local peer influence can be used to reach a global consensus and cooperation across the entire network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mani |first1=Ankur |last2=Rahwan |first2=Iyad |last3=Pentland |first3=Alex |date=2013 |title=Inducing Peer Pressure to Promote Cooperation |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/srep01735 |journal=Scientific Reports |volume=3 |issue=1735 |pages=1735 |doi=10.1038/srep01735 |pmid=23619166 |pmc=3636514 |bibcode=2013NatSR...3E1735M }}&lt;/ref&gt; While this model of consensus and cooperation has been shown to be successful in certain contexts, research suggest that communication and social influence cannot be fully captured by simple contagion models&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Alshamsi |first1=Aamena |last2=Pianesi |first2=Fabio |last3=Lepri |first3=Bruno |last4=Pentland |first4=Alex |last5=Rahwan |first5=Iyad |date=2015 |title=Beyond Contagion: Reality Mining Reveals Complex Patterns of Social Influence |journal=PLOS ONE |volume=10 |issue=8 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0135740 |pmid=26313449 |pmc=4551670 |page=e0135740|arxiv=1507.04192 |bibcode=2015PLoSO..1035740A }}&lt;/ref&gt; and as such a pure contagion based model of consensus may have limits.

===Pilotless aircraft===
[[Image:VT Searching.png|thumb|right|200px|International Aerial Robotics Competition]]
The [[International Aerial Robotics Competition]] is a long-running event begun in 1991 to advance the state of the art in fully autonomous air vehicles.  This competition is restricted to university teams (although industry and governmental sponsorship of teams is allowed).  Key to this event is the creation of flying robots which must complete complex missions without any human intervention.  Successful entries are able to interpret their environment and make real-time decisions based only on a high-level mission directive (e.g., "find a particular target inside a building having certain characteristics which is among a group of buildings 3 kilometers from the aerial robot launch point").  In 2000, a $30,000 prize was awarded during the 3rd Mission (search and rescue), and in 2008, $80,000 in prize money was awarded at the conclusion of the 4th Mission (urban reconnaissance).

===Driverless cars===
[[Image:desertToCity.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Darpa Grand Challenge]]
The [[DARPA Grand Challenge]] is a series of competitions to promote [[driverless car]] technology, aimed at a congressional mandate stating that by 2015 one-third of the operational ground combat vehicles of the US Armed Forces should be unmanned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.darpa.mil/grandchallenge04/sponsor_toolkit/congress_lang.pdf Congressional Mandate] DARPA&lt;/ref&gt; While the first race had no winner, the second awarded a $2 million prize for the autonomous navigation of a hundred-mile trail, using [[GPS]], computers and a sophisticated array of sensors. In November 2007, DARPA introduced the [[DARPA Urban Challenge]], a sixty-mile urban area race requiring vehicles to navigate through traffic. In November 2010 the US Armed Forces extended the competition with the $1.6 million prize [[Multi Autonomous Ground-robotic International Challenge]] to consider cooperation between multiple vehicles in a simulated-combat situation.

[[Roborace]] will be a global motorsport championship with [[Autonomous car|autonomously driving]], [[Electric vehicle|electrically powered]] vehicles. The series will be run as a support series during the [[Formula E]] championship for electric vehicles.&lt;ref name="announcement"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiaformulae.com/en/news/2015/november/formula-e-kinetik-announce-roborace-a-global-driverless-championship.aspx|title=Formula E &amp; Kinetik announce driverless support series|publisher=fiaformulae.com|date=2015-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; This will be the first global championship for driverless cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2015/11/28/formula-e-roborace/|title=Formula E is planning the first racing series for driverless cars|publisher=engadget.com|date=2015-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The General Video Game AI Competition (GVGAI&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gvgai.net General Video Game AI Competition]&lt;/ref&gt;) poses the problem of creating artificial intelligence that can play a wide, and in principle unlimited, range of games. Concretely, it tackles the problem of devising an algorithm that is able to play any game it is given, even if the game is not known a priori. Additionally, the contests poses the challenge of creating level and rule generators for any game is given. This area of study can be seen as an approximation of General Artificial Intelligence, with very little room for game dependent heuristics. The competition runs yearly in different tracks: single player planning&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diego-perez.net/papers/GVGAI2014Competition.pdf Single Player Planning GVGAI]&lt;/ref&gt;, two-player planning&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diego-perez.net/papers/GVGAI20162PCompetition.pdf Two-Player Planning GVGAI]&lt;/ref&gt;, single player learning&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liujialin.tech/publications/GVGAISingleLearning_manual.pdf Single Player Learning GVGAI]&lt;/ref&gt;, level&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diego-perez.net/papers/GVGLG.pdf Level Generation GVGAI]&lt;/ref&gt; and rule&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diego-perez.net/papers/GVGRuleGeneration.pdf Rule Generation GVGAI]&lt;/ref&gt; generation, and each track prizes ranging from 200 to 500 US dollars for winners and runner-ups.

'''Croatian art of the 20th century''', that is [[visual arts]] within the boundaries of today's Croatia, can be divided into [[modern art]] up to the [[Second World War]], and [[contemporary art]] afterwards.

Modern art in Croatia began with the [[Secession (art)|Secession]] ideas spreading from [[Vienna]] and [[Munich]], and [[post-Impressionism]] from Paris. Young artists would study the latest trends and integrate them into their own work. Many strove to bring a native cultural identity into their art, for example themes of national history and legends, and some of the artwork following the [[First World War]] contained a strong political message against the ruling [[Austro-Hungarian]] state. A change was noticeable in 1919 with a move to flatter forms, and signs of [[cubism]] and [[expressionism]] were evident. In the 1920s, the [[Croatian art of the 20th century#Earth Group|Earth Group]] sought to reflect reality and social issues in their art, a movement that also saw the development of [[Hlebine School|naive art]]. By the 1930s there was a return to more simple, classical styles.

Following the [[Second World War]], artists everywhere were searching for meaning and identity, leading to [[abstract expressionism]] in the U.S. and art [[informel]] in Europe. In the new Yugoslavia, the communist [[socialist realism]] style never took hold, but [[bauhaus]] ideas led to [[geometric abstraction]] in paintings and simplified spaces in architecture. In the 1960s, non-conventional forms of visual expression took hold along with a more analytical approach to art, and a move towards new media, such as photography, video, computer art, performance art and installations, focusing more on the artists' process. Art of the 1970s was more conceptual, [[figurative art|figurative]] and [[expressionist]]. However, the 1980s brought a return to more traditional painting and images.

==Modern Art==

The term [[Modern Art]] in [[Europe]] covers roughly the period from the 1860s to the [[Second World War]], and denotes a move away from [[academic art]] with its [[classical mythology]] themes and stylised landscapes. In Croatia, the change was marked by the Croatia salon (''Hrvatski salon'') exhibit of 1898 in the new [[Art Pavilion in Zagreb]].&lt;ref name="lexicon-moderna"/&gt; One of the prime movers of that exhibition, and in the construction of the Art Pavilion itself was the artist [[Vlaho Bukovac]]. Together with [[Bela Čikoš Sesija]], [[Oton Iveković]], [[Ivan Tišov]], [[Robert Frangeš-Mihanović]], [[Rudolf Valdec]] and [[Robert Auer]] he established a breakaway Croatian Society of Artists, who were to become known as the Zagreb Colourful School (''Zagrebačka šarena škola'').&lt;ref name="kucabukovac"/&gt;

This set the scene in the beginning years of the 20th century, for young Croatian artists studying in [[Munich]] and [[Vienna]], bringing back the ideas  of the new [[Secession (art)|Secessionist]] movements.&lt;ref name="mvpei"/&gt; [[Impressionism]] and [[post-Impressionism]] ideas spreading from [[Paris]] would also influence the new generation of artists. In [[sculpture]] and in [[painting]], new ideas of individual artistic expression were taking hold, leading to a new direction of [[Art of Croatia|art in Croatia]].&lt;ref name="mvpei"/&gt;

The [[Academy of Fine Arts, Zagreb|Academy of Fine Arts in Zagreb]] was established in 1907, teaching a new generation of Croatian artists modern techniques and ideas.&lt;ref name="mvpei"/&gt;

===Munich Circle===
[[File:1910, Miroslav Kraljevic, Autoportret sa psom, ulje, 110x85,5, Moderna galerija Zagreb.jpg|thumb|175px|right|Miroslav Kraljević self-portrait with dog]]
Munich Circle (''Münchenski krug'') is the term given by art historians to a group of Croatian painters at the beginning of the 20th century at the start of Croatian Modernism. The painters were [[Josip Račić]], [[Miroslav Kraljević]], [[Vladimir Becić]], and [[Oskar Herman]]. Together they attended the [[Academy of Fine Arts, Munich|Academy of Fine Arts in Munich]], and were at the time known by their classmates as "''Die Kroatische Schule''" (The Croatian School). Račić and Herman had previously studied with [[Anton Ažbe]] at his famous private school in [[Munich]], who insisted on studying the model, plasticity and drawing clear, clean volumes.&lt;ref name="msu-mo"/&gt; The Munich painters achieved strong tonal forms in their work by studying the classical painting of Spanish and French masters. Their joint identity of style, with concise artistic expression, without literary, historical or moralistic framework, puts them in direct contact with French [[impressionism]], particularly with [[Manet]] and [[Cézanne]] as role models. Each of them separately has influenced Croatian Modernism, and together they form an important category in Croatian art. The term "Munich Circle" was coined in the 1950s.&lt;ref name="msu-mo"/&gt;

===Medulić Society===
[[File:Ivo Kerdić Matko.JPG|thumb|right|200px|The work of Ivo Kerdić in Mirogoj cemetery, Zagreb]]
In 1908, a breakaway group of young [[Dalmatia]]n artists in [[Split, Croatia|Split]], founded the Medulić Society. Led by the artist [[Emanuel Vidović]],&lt;ref name="culturenet-early20thc"/&gt; they  used themes from national legends, poetry and history in their art. Exhibitions were held in [[Split, Croatia|Split]] (1908), [[Ljubljana]] (1909), [[Zagreb]] (1910), Rome (1911),&lt;ref name="culturenet-early20thc"/&gt; [[Belgrade]] (1912) and Split (1919).&lt;ref name="lexicon-medulic"/&gt; The Medulić group had an ideological orientation and an underlying political message. Its aim was not simply to develop a national artistic style, but rather to increase political awareness of the south Slavic identity, and promote the idea of independence from [[Austria-Hungary]].&lt;ref name="culturenet-early20thc"/&gt;

The Medulić Society's best known representative was the sculptor [[Ivan Meštrović]], who by then was already receiving international recognition for his work. Within Croatia, his best known work includes the powerful “[[Well of Life (sculpture)|Well of Life]]”, and statues of [[Grgur Ninski]], and Bishop [[Strossmayer]]. Other sculptors in the group include [[Toma Rosandić]], [[Ivo Kerdić]] (best known for medallions),&lt;ref name="kerdic"/&gt; and [[Branislav Dešković]] (known for animal sculptures). Painters in the group included [[Mirko Rački]] best known for his powerful illustrations of [[Dante]] and his posters, [[Tomislav Krizman]]&lt;ref name="lexicon-krizman"/&gt; and [[Jerolim Miše]].&lt;ref name="mvpei"/&gt;

Two strong images from the time are "The Austro-Hungarian Monarchy" by [[Mirko Rački]] (1916) and "Black Flag" by [[Ljubo Babić]] (1919), both portraying the disintegration of the Austro-Hungarian state. Rački used the secessionist decorative style in a powerful statement: a soldier stands to attention against an empty grey field, while behind him sways a black and yellow snake (the colours of the Austrian flag). In Babic's painting, the subject is the funeral of [[Emperor Francis Joseph]] portrayed with a large elongated black flag hanging like a guillotine over a company of people dressed in gay, sumptuous colours.&lt;ref name="culturenet-early20thc"/&gt;

===Spring Salon===
During 1916-28, the Spring salon exhibits in Zagreb brought together painters, sculptures and graphical artists.&lt;ref name="lexicon-proljetnisalon"/&gt; At the first exhibit in the Ulrich Gallery (1916), artists included [[Ljubo Babić]], [[Jerolim Miše]], [[Tomislav Krizman]], [[Zlatko Šulentić]], and sculptors [[Ferdo Ćus]], [[Hinko Juhn]] and [[Joza Turkalj]]. During the [[First World War]], many artists went abroad, and the salon became the only organized art-related activity at the time. The paintings exhibited showed strong use of form, and restricted colour palettes. The move to flatter forms, in the manner of [[Cézanne]], came in the 1919 Spring Salon exhibition,&lt;ref name="ican-matecevic"/&gt; with the next generation of artists such as the Prague Four (''Praška četvorka'') [[Vilko Gecan]], [[Milivoj Uzelac]], [[Marijan Trepše]],&lt;ref name="trepse"/&gt; and [[Vladimir Varlaj]]. [[Expressionism]], [[cubism]] and [[secession (art)|secession]]ism ideas spread,&lt;ref name="mvpei"/&gt; and new directions also came from [[Đuro Tiljak]] who had studied with [[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]],&lt;ref name="posta-tiljak"/&gt; while [[Marino Tartaglia]] bought back the ideas of the [[Futurists]] from [[Rome]] and [[Florence]].&lt;ref name="ican-matecevic"/&gt; By the 1920s, elements of [[neoclassicism]] were creeping in, with its simpler forms.

===Zenit===
The incoming ideas from the rest of Europe were balanced by artists who wanted to integrate the new artistic directions with their native cultural identity. The journal Zenit (Zenith), was an [[avant-garde]] review of new arts and culture that played a key role in this movement.&lt;ref name="jstor-artjournal49-1"/&gt; Founded in 1921 by the poet and critic [[Ljubomir Micić]], despite criticism and controversy, Zenit continued for 6 years to promote the cause for international modernism consistent with a Yugoslav cultural identity.&lt;ref name="jstor-artjournal49-1"/&gt;

One of contributors to Zenit was the architect and artist [[Josip Seissel]], who under the pseudonym of [[Jo Klek]] is considered to be the first in Croatia (1922) to produce [[abstract art|abstract]] paintings: geometric collages with linguistic motifs and [[Surrealist]] compositions.&lt;ref name="joklek"/&gt;

=== 1930s Classicism and Expressionism ===
By the 1930s, the sculptor [[Ivan Meštrović]], whose work was by then well-known internationally, moved into [[Classicism]] and encouraged a new "Mediterranean tradition" in his students' art.&lt;ref name="ican-matecevic" /&gt;
Other artists of time were [[Sergej Glumac]] and [[Vinko Foretić]]&lt;ref name="ican-matecevic" /&gt; Sculptor [[Frano Kršinić]] created motifs of motherhood and music in marble, while [[Marin Studin]] created large works in wood, bronze and stone.&lt;ref name="mvpei" /&gt; [[Cubist]] influences can be found in works of [[Vlado Gecan]], [[Sonja Kovačević Taljević]], and [[surrealism]] in the works of [[Krsto Hegedušić]], [[Vanja Radauš]], and [[Anto Motika]]. On the island of [[Brač]], [[Ignjat Job]] painted colourful landscapes in a personal  [[Expressionism|Expressionist]] style.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

== Naïve Art ==
[[Naïve art|Naïve]], or [[primitive art]] is a distinct segment of the art of the 20th century. In Croatia, naïve art was at first connected with the works of peasants and working men, ordinary men and women, of whom the most successful, over the course of time, became professional artists. Naïve art assumes the work of artists who are more or less self-taught, painters and sculptors with no formal art training, but who have achieved their own creative style and a high level of art. An identifiably individual style and poetic nature distinguishes the Naïve from other "amateur" painters and sculptors, and from the general self-taught artist. The view of a Naïve artist will usually display unusual proportions and perspective, and certain illogicalities of form and space. Such characteristics are the expression of a free creative imagination, in a similar way to other 20th-century art movements such as [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]], [[Expressionism]], [[Cubism]], and [[Surrealism]].

In Croatia, Naïve art is also seen as a democratic movement, as the movement proves anyone can create worthwhile art regardless of formal training. Within these art forms various the emotive qualities of works are often more visible than any reigning form of logic or reason. Common themes include: "the joy of life," "forgotten nature," "lost childhood," and "wonder at the world." However, Naïve art does not only reflect positive aspects of life, and dark and tragic themes can also be found within the genre.

Naïve art first appeared in Croatia at the beginning of the 1930s when the [[Zagreb Art Pavilion]] showcased an exhibition of the artists' association entitled Country (''Zemlja'') on 13 September 1931. Of the artists exhibited, two particularly stood out: [[Ivan Generalić]], who showed three drawings and nine watercolors, and [[Franjo Mraz]], who exhibited three watercolors. The artists sought to show that talent does not only reside in certain social classes or privilege and started the association with naïve art and paintings of villages or by artists from the countryside rather than cities. Themes in Croatian naïve art branched out in the 1950s from villages to "personal classics," which included architectural monuments and objects and opened a period known as "modern primitive art."&lt;ref&gt;Crnkovic, Hrvatski muzej naivne umjetnosti, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Earth Group===
[[File:Antun Augustinčić Vajda.JPG|thumb|200px|right|Sculpture by Antun Augustinčić in Mirogoj cemetery, Zagreb]]
The [[Earth Group]] (''Grupa Zemlja'') were Croatian artists, [[architect]]s and intellectuals active in Zagreb from 1929 to 1935. The group was [[Marxist]] in orientation&lt;ref name="grove"/&gt; and was partly modelled on "[[Neue Sachlichkeit]]",&lt;ref name="ican-matecevic"/&gt; leading to more stylized forms, and the emergence of [[Naive painting]]. The group included the painters [[Krsto Hegedušić]], [[Edo Kovačević]], [[Omer Mujadžić]], [[Kamilo Ružička]], [[Ivan Tabaković]], and [[Oton Postružnik]], the sculptors [[Antun Augustinčić]], [[Frano Kršinić]], and the architect [[Drago Ibler]]. The Earth group searched for answers to social issues.  Their program emphasised the importance of independent creative expression, and opposed the uncritical copying of foreign styles. Rather than producing art for art's sake, they felt it ought to reflect the reality of life and the needs of the modern community. Activities at the group's exhibitions were increasingly provocative to the government of the day, and in 1935 the group was banned.&lt;ref name="ican-matecevic"/&gt;

===Hlebine School===
The Hlebine School is the term applied to a group of [[naive art|naive]] painters working in or around the village of [[Hlebine]], near the Hungarian border, from about 1930. The school developed from the encouragement given by [[Krsto Hegedušić]] to the young painter [[Ivan Generalić]], whom he met in 1930. Generalić and his friends  [[Franjo Mraz]] (also a native of Hlebine) and  [[Mirko Virius]] (from the nearby village of [[Đelekovec]]) formed the nucleus of the group.&lt;ref name="hlebine"/&gt; In 1931, they were invited to exhibit with the Earth group, which brought public recognition&lt;ref name="mvpei"/&gt; and naive art became a popular form of artistic expression in Croatia, making a strong social statement about the harshness of rural life.&lt;ref name="hmnu"/&gt; Generalić was the first master of the Hlebine School, and the first to develop a distinctive personal style, achieving a high standard in his art.&lt;ref name="hmnu-vodic"/&gt;

After the [[Second World War]], the next generation of Hlebine painters tended to focus more on stylized depictions of country life taken from imagination.&lt;ref name="hmnu"/&gt; Generalić continued to be the dominant figure, and encouraged younger artists, including his son [[Josip Generalić]].&lt;ref name="hlebine"/&gt; By the 1950s the school had become well-known internationally, and showed their work at leading exhibitions such as the [[São Paulo Art Biennial]] in 1955.&lt;ref name="hlebine"/&gt; The [[Croatian Museum of Naive Art]] in Zagreb has a comprehensive display of the works of the Hlebine School and other naive artists.&lt;ref name="hmnu"/&gt;

Some of the best known naive artists are   [[Dragan Gaži]],  [[Ivan Generalić]],  [[Josip Generalić]],  [[Krsto Hegedušić]],  [[Mijo Kovačić]], [[Ivan Lacković-Croata]],  [[Franjo Mraz]],  [[Ivan Večenaj]] and [[Mirko Virius]].&lt;ref name="hmnu"/&gt;

==Contemporary Art==
[[File:Edo Murtić Šeferov.JPG|thumb|175px|right|Mosaic by Edo Murtic at Mirogoj, Zagreb]]
During the Second World War, many artists left the country, while others joined the partisans and worked on applied art such as posters and prints supporting the war effort. In the years immediately following the war, the new communist regime in Yugoslavia brought in the Soviet model of [[socialist realism]] and refusal to participate in exhibitions became a popular means of resistance among artists.&lt;ref name="ican-matecevic"/&gt; However, after [[Tito–Stalin split|Tito's break with Stalin]] and the [[Soviet Union]] in 1948 there was a return to more artistic freedom.

Identifying the characteristics of [[contemporary art|contemporary]] or [[postmodern art]] within Croatia can be hard to specify. Some common features are geometrizing and symbolic-metaphoric paintings, sculptures and installations. Some of the best known contemporary artists are painters [[Julije Knifer]], [[Edo Murtić]], [[Oton Gliha]], and sculptor [[Ivan Kožarić]].&lt;ref name="ican-matecevic"/&gt;

===EXAT 51===
EXAT 51 (the name stands for ''Experimental Atelier'') was a group of artists and architects (1951–56) whose program was [[geometric abstraction]] in painting, new ways of handling of space in architecture, and  the abolition of the distinction between fine and applied arts.&lt;ref name="ican-matecevic"/&gt; Their ideas owed much to the Russian [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivist]] [[avant-garde]] and the German [[Bauhaus]] experience, and Exat wanted to involve artists in the shaping of the environment with an experimental and creative approach.&lt;ref name="msu-exat51"/&gt; Members of the group included architects [[Bernardo Bernardi]], [[Zdravko Bregovac]], [[Zvonimir Radić]], [[Božidar Rašica]], [[Vjenceslav Richter]], [[Vladimir Zarahović]], and painters [[Vlado Kristl]], [[Ivan Picelj]], [[Božidar Rašica]], and [[Aleksandar Srnec]].{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

Exat's first manifesto in 1951 was fiercely attacked by the traditional art establishment. However, an exhibit of paintings by the group in 1952 in Zagreb was well attended, and in that same year, they participated in the VII [[Salon des Réalités Nouvelles]] in Paris. In 1953, an exhibition of paintings was held in the Society of Croatian Architects and there the group issued a second manifesto in response to their critics. Other exhibits followed in Belgrade (1953), Rijeka (1954,1956), Dubrovnik (1956) and finally in Belgrade (1956).&lt;ref name="msu-exat51"/&gt; Under their influence, Croatian artists moved to more creative and personal forms of expression, to [[surrealism]] and [[lyrical abstraction]].&lt;ref name="ican-matecevic"/&gt;

EXAT 51 was instrumental in setting up the [[Zagreb Triennial]] of Applied Arts, and in establishing a Studio for Industrial Design in 1955. The forerunner of the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Zagreb]] was founded in 1954 as a direct result of their efforts.&lt;ref name="msu-exat51"/&gt;

===Gorgona Group===
[[File:A.G. Matos (Zagreb).jpg|thumb|175px|Statue of the writer A.G. Matos by [[Ivan Kožarić]], Zagreb, 1978]]
[[Gorgona Group|Gorgona]] was a group of artists active in Zagreb between 1959 and 1966, that advocated non-conventional forms of visual art expression. It included the painters [[Josip Vaništa]], [[Julije Knifer]],  [[Marijan Jevšovar]], [[Đuro Seder]], sculptor [[Ivan Kožarić]], art theoreticians and critics [[Radoslav Putar]], [[Matko Meštrović]], [[Dimitrije Bašičević]] (Mangelos), and architect Miljenko Horvat. Individually they were significant representatives of their own artistic fields, and together they had a major impact on the direction of contemporary art in Croatia.&lt;ref name="ican-matecevic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="msu-gorgona"/&gt; Besides working in more traditional techniques, they pioneered radical forms of artistic expression related to [[existentialism]], neo-[[dadaism]] and proto-[[conceptualism]]. Their anti-magazine Gorgona (11 issues published 1961-1966) was simply designed, each edition intended to showcase the work and views of a single artist and was in itself a printed work of art.&lt;ref name="kontakt-gorgona"/&gt; The group was preoccupied by the absurd, sent people invitations  for events that never took place, placed ads for the sale of trivial objects, planned unfeasible projects, and even went so far as to exclude the audience to have the whole place for themselves.&lt;ref name="ican-matecevic"/&gt; The Gorgona publication, and the group's activities raised interest in international art circles - and they had frequent contact with such artists as [[Dieter Roth]], [[Victor Vasarely]], [[Piero Manzoni]], [[Lucio Fontana]] and [[Robert Rauschenberg]].&lt;ref name="msu-gorgona"/&gt;

===New Tendencies===
[[File:Julije Knifer Meandar 1961-1962.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Meandar by Julije Knifer]]
During the period 1961-1973, five international exhibitions were organized under the title New Tendencies. They continued the  development of ideas raised by Exat 51 during the 1950s, and formed part of the broader European post-[[informel]] art movement in the 1960s and 70s.&lt;ref name="msu-newtendencies"/&gt; They were the initiative of art historians and critics [[Dimitrije Bašičević]], [[Božo Bek]], [[Boris Kelemen]], [[Radoslav Putar]], [[Matko Meštrović]] and the artists [[Ivan Picelj]], [[Vjenceslav Richter]], [[Julije Knifer]], [[Aleksandar Srnec]],  later by a group of younger artists: [[Juraj Dobrović]], [[Miroslav Šutej]], [[Mladen Galić]], [[Ljerka Šibenik]] and [[Ante Kuduz]].&lt;ref name="ican-matecevic"/&gt;

The exhibitions focused mainly on neo-[[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]], presenting artistic achievements in a wide variety of media, such as [[computer graphics]], [[conceptual art]], [[performance art]]&lt;ref name="mvpei"/&gt; and [[environmental art]], as well as an examination of the theory and practice of connecting art with society. The exhibitions were held in a number of museums and galleries across Zagreb presenting the latest work from internationally known artists.&lt;ref name="ican-matecevic"/&gt;

At the first exhibition in 1961, a common theme was the investigation of the relationship between structure and surface, and the beginnings of programmed and [[kinetic art]], a topic that was to be developed further in the following exhibition of 1963. Experiments in visual perception gave a scientific dimension, and by the third exhibition in 1965, artists were examining the relations between cybernetics and art, and events included a symposium on the topic. The 1968/69 exhibition and colloquium dealt further with ideas of information theory and aesthetics, called "Computers &amp; Visual Research". Two new sections appeared at the  exhibition of 1973 - one on conceptual art, and another entitled "Canvas". There was also a symposium on "The Rational and the Irrational in Contemporary Art". A 6th New Tendencies exhibition was planned, but never took place. An international symposium was held in 1978, along with an exhibit reviewing the artistic changes of 1966-1978.&lt;ref name="msu-newtendencies"/&gt;

Among the most significant works are the sculptures of [[Vojin Bakić]], the reliefs, paintings and graphic books of [[Juraj Dobrović]], and the paintings, sculptures, and mobile graphics of [[Miroslav Šutej]].&lt;ref name="msu-newtendencies"/&gt;

===New Media===
Between the years 1966 and 1974, the visual arts scene in Croatia expanded, as in the rest of the world, to include [[new media art]].&lt;ref name="msu-nap"/&gt; [[Minimal art]], [[Pop-art]] and the geometric forms of New Tendencies combined in a new generation of artists characterized by the free spirit of 1968 and ideas about changing the world. They used mass media as a means to express their individual observations and views. Within Croatia, the movement was known as "new art practice",&lt;ref name="msu-nap"/&gt; stressing the importance of the artist's part in the process. The very notion of art was called into question, along with its function. Analyzing the concepts of culture, society, politics and economics led to new media as forms of expression such as [[photography]], [[video art|video]], [[performance art]], spatial interventions, and [[installation art]]. The works were most frequently [[conceptual art|conceptual]] or [[environmental art|environmental]], and emphasis shifted from aesthetic to ethical principles.&lt;ref name="msu-nap"/&gt; By the mid-seventies disillusionment had set in, groups broke up, and some artists left the country.&lt;ref name="ican-matecevic"/&gt;

Among the artists who made most impression in the "new art practice" with individual exhibitions or group actions and urban interventions were [[Željko Borčić]], [[Boris Bućan]], [[Vlasta Delimar]], [[Slavomir Drinković]], [[Braco Dimitrijević]], [[Ladislav Galeta]], [[Tomislav Gotovac]], [[Sanja Iveković]], [[Dean Jokanović]], [[Jagoda Kaloper]], [[Željko Kipke]], [[Dalibor Martinis]], [[Marijan Molnar]], [[Goran Petercol]], [[Ante Rašić]], [[Josip Stošić]], [[Davor Tomičić]], [[Goran Trbuljak]], [[Gorki Žuvela]], the Group of Six Artists ([[Vlado Martek]], [[Željko Jerman]], [[Boris Demur]], [[Mladen Stilinović]], [[Sven Stilinović]], [[Fedor Vučemilović]]), and the Group Flow ([[Vladimir Gudac]], [[Dubravko Budić]], [[Davor Lončarić]], [[Ivan Šimunović]], [[Gustav Zechel]], [[Darko Zubčević]]).&lt;ref name="msu-nap"/&gt;

===Biafra Group===
Biafra (1970–1978) was a group of Croatian artists that rebelled against the artistic, social and cultural conventions of the day, and engaged with real problems through their art. Individual members ranged in style from [[pop-art]] and [[minimalism]] to new figuration.&lt;ref name="kultura-biafra"/&gt; The sculptors of the group used new materials in their work, such as polyester, plastic, jute, aluminum, and glass wool, while the painters engaged with imaginative, expressive, rich colors. The content of their art was [[expressionist]], clear and direct. Exhibitions and activities were organized on the streets, presenting their ideas directly to the public. The group originally consisted of the young sculptors [[Branko Bunić]], [[Stjepan Gračan]], [[Ratko Petrić]] and [[Miro Vuco]]. Membership expanded over the years to include [[Ivan Lesiak]], [[Zlatko Kauzlarić Atač]], [[Rudolf Labaš]], [[Vlado Jakelić]], [[Stanko Jančić]], [[Ratko Janjić-Jobo]], [[Đurđica Zanoški-Gudlin]], [[Emil Robert Tanay]].&lt;ref name="kultura-biafra"/&gt;

===New Image===
At the Art Pavilion in 1981, the Youth Salon showed the work of 12 young painters who presented a return to painting and images. The trend became known as New Image (''Nova Slika''), and it was also evident at the Gallery of Contemporary Art's exhibition of 'Italian Trans-Avantgarde', showing the works of Italian and Yugoslav artists. New image brought new ways of expression and a new sensitivity towards intimacy and symbolism.&lt;ref name="ican-matecevic"/&gt; The traces of new image can be found in the late 1970s in Zagreb, and in major exhibitions in New York, London, the [[Venice Biennale]] (1980), the Biennale of young people in Paris 1980. Individual artists: [[Nina Ivančić]], [[Star Fio]], [[Đuro Seder]]

===1980s and Beyond===
[[File:Đuro Seder - Unutarnji razgovor.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Inner Dialogue (''Unutarnji razgovor'') by Đuro Seder, 1991]]
The 1980s brought a rejection of  restrictions, and more varied individual approaches to art and explorations of painting and sculpture appeared.&lt;ref name="ican-matecevic"/&gt; Some concentrated on the meaning and content of the work, while for others the narrative was more important and in conceptual art the medium increasingly defined the work. The [[avant-garde]] trends of the previous decades were giving way to a reintroduction of  more traditional media in a more personal style, but at the same time, there was a more refined sense of conceptualism - leading to more materialized forms.

Several of the older Croatian artists had already turned again towards painting and more traditional media during the 1970s. For example, the work of [[Ferdinand Kulmer]] and [[Đuro Seder]] brought significant changes to Croatian painting, and the sculptor [[Ivan Kožarić]] reviewed his work in relation to his artistic past. At the same time [[Dimitrije Bašičević]] organized the "Confrontations" exhibition which juxtaposed avant-garde and traditional approaches to art and compared their value and significance.&lt;ref name="ican-matecevic"/&gt;

The 1990s was again a time of war, as Croatia gained its independence from the former Yugoslavia. [[Edo Murtić]]'s "War" cycle stands as powerful, poignant statement,&lt;ref name="min-kulture"/&gt; while his large scale paintings of near abstract landscapes, such as his "Montraker" cycle of the 1990s point the way to the future.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2983">The '''culture of the [[Cayman Islands]]''' has been influenced by Afro-Caribbeans of [[Jamaica]], colonists of [[Great Britain]], and more recent immigrants from the [[United States]]. In the 21st century, approximately 113 nationalities make up the residents on the three islands comprising the country. The total population of the Cayman Islands consists of slightly more than 55,000 people spread throughout the island group, with the majority of the people found on Grand Cayman. Roughly 20,000 are native Caymanian, with the remainder born elsewhere in the world.

In the past, most of the people of the Cayman Islands got their livelihood from the sea through fishing, turtle harvesting, and as merchant seamen. Cayman Sea Salt and Cayman Logwood products are now locally made and exported.

==Religion==

The influences of [[United States|American]] and [[European culture]] are most evident in the [[religion]] of the Cayman Islands, where Christianity is the most practiced religion. Within the island group, Christian denominations include [[Anglican]], [[Baptist]], [[Catholicism]], [[Church of God (Cleveland, Tennessee)|Church of God]], [[Presbyterian]], and [[United Church in Jamaica and the Cayman Islands|United Church]], among others. Because religion is an important aspect of the culture of the Cayman Islands, most of the local businesses as well as the harbors and ports are closed on Sundays. The same establishments are closed on [[Christmas]] days. The Cayman Islands also hosts a growing Jewish community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishcayman.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language==
British English is the most commonly spoken language in the Cayman Islands, albeit with a distinctive [[Cayman Creole|Caymanian dialect]].  [[Jamaican patois]] is also commonly spoken in the Cayman Islands, and younger Caymanian generations had adopted certain Jamaican terms and expressions. 

==Cuisine==
{{British cuisine}}
The food of the Cayman Islands includes traditional Afro-Caribbean fare such as [[cassava]], johnny cake, bread fruit, [[Plantain (cooking)|plantain]], and meat pie.  Jamaican cuisine has also been an influence in the Cayman Islands, and [[Jamaican jerk spice|jerk]] seasoning has become popular for use on meat dishes such as chicken, fish and pork. [[Curry]] is also used frequently in rice, chicken, and fish dishes.  Traditional Caymanian fare includes dishes made from turtle meat, [[conch]], goat, and fish such as [[grouper]] and [[Mutton Snapper|snapper]], with locally made Cayman Sea Salt.

{{wikinews|Program Ecumenical Hellenism starts second decade of action}}
The '''Ecumenical Hellenism program''' ({{lang-el|Πρόγραμμα Οικουμενικός Ελληνισμός}}), is a non-profit, [[non-governmental]] company. It is the result of the cooperation between the [[Athens]]-based publishing house ''Greek National Line'' (Ελληνική Εθνική Γραμμή) and the [[Karipion Melathron|Institute for National and Religious Studies]] of [[Thessaloniki]].

The program started its function in 1996, as a result of the initiative of the businessman Stavros Panousopoulos and of the [[Aristotle University of Thessaloniki]] Professor, [[Athanasios Angelopoulos]]. The aim of the '''Ecumenical Hellenism''' is to promote Greek interests abroad as well as to publish editions regarding [[Greek culture]] and [[Orthodoxy]]. The program mainly operates within the [[Greek diaspora]].

During its function, the program organised missions all over the world and operated under the patronage of the [[President of Greece|President of the Hellenic Republic]] as well as under the blessing of the [[Ecumenical Patriarch]] and of the [[Church of Greece]].

The '''Faith and Globalisation Initiative''' ('''FGI''') is an international group of universities created in 2008 by former [[British prime minister]] [[Tony Blair]] and his [[Tony Blair Faith Foundation|Faith Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://faithandglobalization.yale.edu/ |title=Introduction to Faith and Globalisation Initiative |publisher=Yale University=21 Jan 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090928130909/http://faithandglobalization.yale.edu/ |archivedate=28 September 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Faith and Globalisation Initiative is "bringing together some of the world’s leading research Universities to form a global network focusing on the emerging field of faith and globalisation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tonyblairfaithfoundation.org/index.php/faith-and-globalisation/entry/the-faith-and-globalisation-initiative/ |title=Faith and Globalisation Initiative |publisher=Tony Blair Faith Foundation=21 Jan 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008151638/http://www.tonyblairfaithfoundation.org/index.php/faith-and-globalisation/entry/the-faith-and-globalisation-initiative/ |archivedate=8 October 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and key objectives==
In 2008 Yale University was the first university the [[Tony Blair Faith Foundation|Foundation]] started working with and in 10 months it expanded the network to include the National University of Singapore, Durham University and McGill University. Two years later the Foundation developed an associate university programme which seeks to foster the study of faith and globalisation in a broad range of higher education institutions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tonyblairfaithfoundation.org/index.php/faith-and-globalisation/entry/associate-universities ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008151655/http://www.tonyblairfaithfoundation.org/index.php/faith-and-globalisation/entry/associate-universities |date=8 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The institutions were selected on the basis of their ability to contribute to the Initiative, but also to ensure that they have a geographic and cultural spread that lends multiple perspectives to the discipline.

Key objectives of the FGI are the following:
* Develop multi-disciplinary teaching courses on Faith and Globalisation
* Advance knowledge in the field of Faith and Globalisation
* Disseminate university research related to Faith and Globalisation
* Engage policy-makers and the general public on the topic of Faith and Globalisation
* Support the implementation and development of the Foundation's Face to Faith and Faiths Act projects.

==Universities==

{{Listen|type=music|filename=Fanfares of President of the Czech Republic.ogg|title="Fanfares of the President by Bedřich Smetana"}}

A '''fanfare''' (or '''fanfarade''' or '''flourish''') is a short [[music]]al flourish that is typically played by [[trumpet]]s or other [[brass instrument]]s, often accompanied by [[percussion]] {{harv|Tarr|2001}}. It is a "brief [[improvisation|improvised]] [[introduction (music)|introduction]] to an instrumental performance" {{harv|Griffiths|2004}}&lt;!--unpaginated--&gt;. A fanfare has also been defined as "a musical announcement played on brass instruments before the arrival of an important person", such as heralding the entrance of a monarch {{harv|Lloyd|1968|loc=172}}. Historically, fanfares were usually played by trumpet players, as the trumpet was associated with royalty {{harv|Lloyd|1968|loc=172}}. Bugles are also mentioned {{harv|Davidson|1907}}. The [[melody]] notes of a fanfare are often based around the major triad, often using "[h]eroic dotted rhythms" {{harv|Lloyd|1968|loc=172}}.

By extension, the term may also designate a short, prominent passage for brass instruments in an orchestral composition. Fanfares are widely used in [[opera]] orchestral parts, notably in [[Wagner]]'s ''[[Tannhauser]]'' and ''[[Lohengrin]]'' and in [[Beethoven]]'s ''[[Fidelio]]''. In ''Fidelio'', the dramatic use of the fanfare is heightened by having the trumpet player perform [[Offstage trumpet|offstage]], which creates a muted effect.

==Etymology==
The word has been traced to a 15th-century Spanish root, ''fanfa'' ("vaunting"). Though the word may be onomatopoeic, it is also possible that it is derived from the Arabic word ''anfár'' ("trumpets"). The word is first found in 1546 in French, and in English in 1605, but it was not until the 19th century that it acquired its present meaning of a brief ceremonial flourish for brass {{harv|Tarr|2001}}. Indeed, an alternative term for the fanfare is "flourish", as in the "[[Ruffles and Flourishes]]" played by military bands in the US to announce the arrival of the President, a general, or other high-ranking dignitary {{harv|Randel|2003}}. "In the England of Shakespeare's time", fanfares "were often known as flourishes and sometimes as "tuckets" (a word related to [[toccata]]) {{harv|Lloyd|1968|loc=172}}.

==History==
In French usage, ''fanfare'' also may refer to a hunting signal (given either on "starting" a stag, or after the kill when the hounds are given their share of the animal). In both France and Italy, ''fanfare'' was the name given in the 19th century to a military or civilian [[brass band]] {{harv|Tarr|2001}}. In French, this usage continues to the present, and distinguishes the all-brass band from bands of mixed brass and woodwind, which is called ''Harmonie'' {{harv|Kennedy|2006}}. Fanfares have been imitated in [[art music]] as early as the 14th century. Examples in opera include a fanfare for the governor's arrival in [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s ''[[Fidelio]]'', act 2. In the 20th century, well-known composed fanfares include [[Aaron Copland]]'s ''[[Fanfare for the Common Man]]'' (1942), for brass and percussion, and [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s ''[[Fanfare for a New Theatre]]'' (1964), for two trumpets ({{harvnb|Baines and Bellingham|2002}}; {{harvnb|Randel|2003}}).

Copland's Fanfare is one of a series of 18 commissioned by [[Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra]] conductor [[Eugene Aynsley Goossens|Eugene Goossens]] in 1942–43, each to open a concert. Each was to salute an aspect of the war effort; the U.S. had entered [[World War II]] the previous year. The only one of these fanfares to become well known is Copland's; the others are rarely if ever performed or recorded. The set, with the date of the concert at which each was performed, is {{harv|Anon.|n.d.}}:

[[File:Tourist Gaiters.jpg|thumb|Hiking gaiters]]

'''Gaiters''' are garments worn over the shoe and lower [[Trousers| pants]] leg, and used primarily as [[personal protective equipment]];  similar garments used primarily for display are [[Spat (footwear)| spats]].
Originally, gaiters were made of [[leather]]. Today, gaiters for [[walking]] are commonly made of plasticized synthetic cloth such as [[polyester]].  Gaiters for use on horseback continue to be made of leather.

==Terminology==
In army parlance, a gaiter covers leg and bootlacing; a legging covers only the leg.  In [[RAF]] parlance, gaiter includes legging.  The [[National Army (USA)|American Army]] during [[World War I]]&lt;ref name = "WWI"&gt;{{Citation | last = Henry | first = Mark | title = The US Army of World War I | publisher = Osprey | place = Oxford | year = 2003}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[World War II]] had leggings, which were gaiters.  Above the knee spatterdashes were cotton or canvas, as were many gaiters of varying lengths thereafter. Leather gaiters were rare in military, though sometimes a calf-length [[cotton]] gaiter had leather kneecaps added.  Leggings, however, were very often made of leather, but also [[canvas]].

==On foot==

[[File:US Navy 030708-N-5862D-127 Members of the U.S. Navy Ceremonial Guard stand in formation next to the Lone Sailor statue at the U.S. Navy Memorial.jpg|thumb|[[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] [[honor guard#United States|Ceremonial Guard]] wearing white canvas [[leggings#Military use|leggings]], as the part of the [[Uniforms of the United States Navy|Enlisted Full Dress Whites or Blue]]]]

Gaiters are a type of protective clothing for a person's [[ankle]]s and legs below the knee. Gaiters are worn when [[walking]], [[hiking]], [[running]] (especially [[orienteering]] and [[rogaining]]) outdoors amongst dense underbrush or in [[snow]], with or without [[snowshoe]]s. Heavy gaiters are often worn when using [[crampon]]s, to protect the leg and ankle from the spikes of the opposite foot. Gaiters strap over the [[hiking boot]] and around the person's leg to provide protection from branches and thorns and to prevent mud, snow, etc. from entering the top of the boot. Gaiters may also be worn as protection against snake bites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Nark |first1=Jason |date=20 June 2018 |title=Venomous passion: Pennsylvania's snake hunters head to the hills |url=http://www.philly.com/philly/news/rattlesnake-hunt-roundup-rural-pennsylvania-venomous-copperhead-20180620.html |accessdate=22 June 2018 |work=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaiters are similar to [[puttee]]s, a part of numerous military uniforms.  Gaiters known as ''jambieres'' (derived from the French word ''jambe'' for legs, hence leggings) were part of the uniform of [[Zouave]] infantry regiments.

==On horseback==
[[File:Huaso-leg.jpg|thumb|upright|Over-the-knee gaiters worn by a Chilean rodeo rider]]

During the 19th century gaiters for riding typically were known as ''riding gaiters'', distinguishing them from the other gaiters that were in general use.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}  Today, [[Chaps#Half chaps|half chaps]] are a type of gaiter worn by [[Equestrianism|equestrian]]s.  Most forms fit over the calf. These are intended to protect the rider's leg from wear by the stirrup leathers and other saddle parts.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}  Modern styles usually have a zipper or [[hook and loop fastener]]s on the outside of the leg.

==In the Anglican church==
Gaiters formed a part of the everyday [[clerical clothing]] of [[bishop]]s and [[archdeacon]]s of the [[Church of England]] until the middle part of the twentieth century.  They were also worn by some cathedral [[Dean (Christianity)|dean]]s.  They were made of black cotton, wool, or silk, and buttoned up the sides, reaching to just below the knee where they would join with black breeches.  Gaiters would be worn with a clerical [[apron]], a type of short [[cassock]] reaching to just above the knee.  The purpose of this vesture was originally practical, since archdeacons and bishops were presumed to be mobile, riding horses to various parts of a [[diocese]] or archdeaconry.  In latter years, the clothing took on a more symbolic dimension.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://anglicansonline.org/special/gaiters/ | publisher = Anglicans Online | title = Through the Years with Gaiters}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Gemini Man 01.png|thumb|right|Partial shot from the opening sequence, showing [[Ben Murphy]] as Sam Casey and the countdown digital watch that served as his DNA stabilizer.]]

'''''Gemini Man''''' is an [[United States|American]] [[action-adventure]] [[Drama (genre)|drama]] series that aired on [[NBC]] in 1976. The third television series based on the [[H. G. Wells]] science fiction novel, ''[[The Invisible Man]]'', ''Gemini Man'' was created to replace the previous season's [[The Invisible Man (1975 TV series)|''The Invisible Man'']], utilizing simpler and less expensive special effects.

==Plot==
The series starred [[Ben Murphy]] as laid-back denim-clad motorcycle-riding [[secret agent]] Sam Casey who, while diving to retrieve a fallen [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] spy satellite, was exposed to radiation in an underwater explosion, which rendered him invisible. The agency he worked for, a high-tech government [[think tank]] called Intersect ("International Security Techniques"), found a way to return him to visibility and control his new power by the use of a special wristwatch referred to as a "[[DNA]] stabilizer," which was invented by scientist Abby Lawrence (Katherine Crawford). Pressing a button on the digital watch would make him vanish, clothes and all, which was a helpful tool in his line of work, but he could only do this for 15 minutes per day or else he would die.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/shows/gemini-man/|title='Gemini Man'|website=tv.com|accessdate=September 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A pilot of the series aired on May 10, 1976, and the series began airing on September 23 of that year. Although 11 episodes were produced, only five were aired in the [[United States]] before the cancellation of the show, although the entire series was seen in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] with somewhat greater success that led to a [[record album]] and hardcover [[annual publication|annual]] based on the show. [[Richard Dysart]] played Casey's boss, Leonard Driscoll, in the pilot and [[William Sylvester]] played Driscoll during the series.

==Cast==
* [[Ben Murphy]] as Sam Casey
* [[Katherine Crawford]] as Abby Lawrence
* [[William Sylvester]] as Leonard Driscoll
* [[Quinn K. Redeker]] as Brighton

==Episodes==
The two-hour pilot episode of the series, ''The Gemini Man'' (aka ''Code Name: Minus One''), originally aired on May 10, 1976.

# Smithereens (September 23, 1976)
# Minotaur (September 30, 1976)
# Sam Casey, Sam Casey (October 7, 1976)
# Night Train to Dallas (October 14, 1976)

# Buffalo Bill Rides Again (Unaired, but used as part of ''Riding With Death'')
# Return of the Lion (Unaired)

===Television movie===
Two episodes, "Smithereens" and the unaired "Buffalo Bill Rides Again", were re-edited into one 90-minute television movie titled ''Riding With Death'', which was released in 1981.

''Riding with Death'' used scenes from ''[[Colossus: The Forbin Project]]'' as [[establishing shot]]s for sweeping computer room scenes. The "Guardian" logo ("Guardian" was the [[USSR|Russian]] version of "Colossus") appears in at least one segment. Though not immediately verifiable, at least one segment uses the "Colossus" speaker/microphone.

The film dealt clumsily with the dropping of Katherine Crawford from the cast by the latter episode, the length of time between filming (William Sylvester had grown a thick bushy mustache in the interim), and the appearance of an arch-villain in the second "half" who did not exist in the opening of the series (save for a clumsy overdub referring to the villain's elusiveness in the final minutes of the first segment). Both parts feature singer [[Jim Stafford]] as a trucker named "Buffalo Bill" who befriends and helps Sam.

In 1997, ''Riding With Death'' was featured in an episode of movie-mocking television show ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]''. Mike Nelson and his robot friends highlighted the thin connection between the two halves of the "movie", and the general incoherence of the plot.

== Home media ==
The complete TV series was released as a region-free DVD in the French territory in November 2013 by Elephant Films with two language tracks, French and English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdfr.com/dvd/f65444-nouvel-homme-invisible.html|title=Le Nouvel homme invisible (1976) - DVD Gemini Man|website=dvdfr.com|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The episodes are uncut.

{{Aliyah}}
The '''Hebraization of surnames''' (also '''Hebraicization''')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=Hebraize|title=Hebraize—Define Hebraize at Dictionary.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/hebraize|title=the definition of Hebraize|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-he-n|עברות}}, ''Ivrut'', "Hebraization") is the act of [[name change|adopting]] a [[Hebrew surname]] in exchange for their [[Kinnui|diaspora names]]. For many [[Jewish diaspora|diaspora Jews]] who [[Aliyah|migrated]] to the [[Land of Israel]], taking a Hebrew [[surname]] was a way to [[Negation of the Diaspora|erase remnants]] of their diaspora experience and to [[Israelization|assimilate]] into a new shared identity as [[Mizrahi Jews]] and [[Palestinian Jews]] (Jewish residents of [[Ottoman Palestine]] and [[Mandatory Palestine]]) and later as [[Israeli Jews]] (Jewish citizens of the independent [[State of Israel]].)

This name-change typically did not apply to [[Mizrahi Jews]] who came from neighboring countries such as Iran, Iraq, and Egypt. Mizrahis usually kept their surnames.

This phenomenon was especially common among [[Ashkenazi Jews]], because many such families only acquired permanent surnames (rather than [[patronym]]s) when surnames were made compulsory by the November 12, 1787 decree by the [[Habsburg]] emperor [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jewishcurrents.org/november-12-jews-acquire-family-names-12794|title=November 12: Jews Acquire Family Names|date=12 November 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By way of contrast, [[Sephardi Jews]] from the Iberian peninsula often had hereditary family names since well before the [[Alhambra Decree|Spanish Expulsion]] (e.g., Cordovero, Abrabanel, Shaltiel, de Leon, Alcalai, Toledano,...) Very few Hebrew surnames existed before Hebraization, such as ''[[Cohen (surname)|Cohen]]'' (priest), ''[[Moss (surname)|Moss]]'' (Moses) and ''[[Levi (surname)|Levi]]'' ([[Levite]]).  In America, names ending with ''-berg'', ''-stein'' or ''-man'' are often thought of as Jewish, but are of [[German language|German]] origin, while suffixes such as ''-sky'' and ''-vitz'' are [[Slavic languages|Slavic]]. Similarly,  a few Hebrew surnames, such as ''[[Katz (name)|Katz]]'', ''[[Bogoraz]]'', ''Ohl'' and ''Pak'' are in fact Hebrew [[Acronym and initialism|acronyms]], even though they sound and are often perceived as being of foreign origin (in these cases, from German, [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Polish language|Polish]] and [[Korean language|Korean]], respectively).

The Hebraization of surnames is a unique phenomenon to the Hebrew language. This process began as early as the days of the [[First Aliyah|First]] and [[Second Aliyah|Second]] ''Aliyot'' and continued after the establishment of the State of Israel. The widespread trend towards Hebraization of surnames in the days of the [[Yishuv]] and immediately after the establishment of the State of Israel was based on the claim that a Hebrew name provided a feeling of belonging to the new state. There was also the wish to distance from the lost and dead past, and from the forced imposition of foreign (e.g. German) names in the previous centuries.&lt;ref name="JAI"/&gt;

This process has not ended: among the thousands of Israelis who currently apply for legal name changes each year, many do it to adopt Hebrew names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4072664,00.html |title=What's in a (monarch's) name?  |publisher=Ynetnews |date=1995-06-20 |accessdate=2014-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===In the Yishuv===
Among the [[Yishuv]] (the first to return to Eretz Yisrael—the [[Land of Israel]]), there was a strong feeling of ''sh'lilat ha'gola'' (Hebrew: {{Hebrew|שלילת הגולה}} "negation of the diaspora/Exile"), which often included the exchange of Diaspora surnames for purely Hebrew ones.&lt;ref name="W"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theochem.weizmann.ac.il/~comartin/israelinames.txt|title=Some preliminary notes on Israeli family names|last=Martin|first=Gershom|at=[[Weizmann Institute of Science]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6G4lwd7Th?url=http://theochem.weizmann.ac.il/~comartin/israelinames.txt|archivedate=2013-04-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the [[Zionist movement]] was not only Aliyah it was also wanting to create an image of an [[Israeli Jews|Israeli Jew]] that would be different than the [[Yiddish]] speaking, ''[[shtetl]]'' living, and perceived weak [[Diaspora Jews]], and these things were a significant part of the people of the [[First Aliyah|First]] and [[Second Aliyah|Second]] ''Aliyot''. Some of the immigrants of the First Aliyah (1882–1903) Hebraized their surnames, and the practice became widespread during the Second Aliyah (1904–1914).&lt;ref name="JAI"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewish-world.org.il/Roots/English/2/InfoPages/IvrotLastName.asp?Language=English&amp;PageLink=&amp;unit=2&amp;session=3&amp;lesson=2&amp;CF=152&amp;CFS=1.3|title=The Hebraization of Surnames |publisher=[[Jewish Agency for Israel]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=forward/&gt; 

====Jewish Agency booklet====
This process started with individuals like [[Eliezer Ben-Yehuda]] (Perelman) and was adopted by the [[New Yishuv]]. Before the founding of the State of Israel, in 1944, the Zionist leadership and the [[Jewish National Council]] proclaimed it the "Year of naturalization and the Hebrew name".&lt;ref name="JAI"/&gt; A special committee under the chairmanship of [[Mordechai Nemzabi]], the [[Jewish Agency]] advisor on matters of civilian defense, published a booklet which contained guidelines on the creation on new Hebrew surnames.&lt;ref name="JAI"/&gt;

;Changing a foreign surname to Hebrew:
#Change of vocalization: ''Leib'' becomes ''Lev''
#Change of consonants: ''Borg'' or ''Brog'' becomes ''Barak''
#Shortening by omitting the ending: ''Rosenberg'' becomes ''Rosen''
#Shortening a name with a Hebrew meaning, by omitting the foreign suffix: ''Yakobovitch'' (''Jacobowitz'', ''Jacobowicz'') becomes ''Ya'akovi''
#Translating the foreign name into Hebrew according to the meaning: ''Abramovich'' (''Abramowicz'', ''Abramowitz'') becomes ''Ben Avraham''
;First names as surnames:
#Name of a father or mother who were murdered during the [[The Holocaust|Shoah]], thus: ''Bat Miriam'', ''Ben Moshe'', ''Devorin''
#Son or daughter who fell in battle: ''Avinoam''
#Brother or sister who were killed or fell: ''Achimeir''
#Beloved or admired [[Tanakh|biblical]] figure: ''[[Saul|Shaul]]'', ''[[David]]i''
;Change of names by names of places, plants or sites in Eretz Yisrael:
#Places or sites: ''[[Hermon]]i'', ''[[Eilat]]'', ''[[Gilead|Gilad]]''
#Plants, especially plants of the [[Land of Israel]]: ''Eshel'' ("orchard", "garden"), ''Rotem'' ("desert [[Broom (shrub)|broom]]")

===After the establishment of Israel===
After the [[Israeli Declaration of Independence]], there was still the attitude that the hebraization of family names should continue, in order to get rid of names with a diaspora sound.&lt;ref name="JAI"/&gt; Hebraization of names became a typical part of the integration process for new immigrants among [[Ashkenazi Jews]], but also among [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardi]] and [[Mizrahi Jews|Mizrahi]] Jewish immigrants from Arab and Muslim lands; Sephardi and Mizrahi children were typically given new Hebrew names in school, often without permission from their parents.&lt;ref name=forward&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forward.com/news/309070/for-israelis-hebrew-names-are-about-autonomy-not-assimilation/|title=For New Israelis, Hebrew Names Are About Autonomy, Not Assimilation|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Ben-Gurion]], the first [[Prime Minister of Israel]], was committed to the use of the Hebrew language (he changed his surname from Grün to Ben-Gurion). He tried to convince as many people to change their surnames into "real" Hebrew ones. Ben-Gurion got [[Herzl Rosenblum]] to sign the Israeli Declaration of Independence as  Herzl Vardi, his [[pen name]] (later changed to his legal name), as Ben-Gurion wanted more Hebrew names on the document. Nine more of the signatories of the document would then go on to Hebraize their name, as well.

Ben-Gurion, in an order to the [[Israel Defense Forces]] soldiers, wrote, "It is desirable that every commanding officer (from Squadron Commander to Chief of Staff) should change his surname, whether German, English, Slavic, French or foreign in general, to a Hebrew surname, in order to be a role model for his soldiers. The Israel Defense Forces must be Hebrew in spirit, vision, and in all internal and external expressions."&lt;ref name="JAI"/&gt;

A binding order of the same issue was issued to the officials of the state in 1950, and particularly to those who represented the State abroad. A "Committee for Hebrew Names" was established to supervise the implementation of the order, whose task was to assist and advise the choice of a Hebrew name.

In addition to pressure from the state, tensions between [[Jewish ethnic groups]] caused some people to Hebraize their names to dis-identify with a "stigmatized" ethnic group or to merge into a "collective Israeli identity" and therefore created a desire to Hebraize.&lt;ref name="W"/&gt;

===Supporters and opponents===
The Hebraization of surnames provoked sharp controversy in the days of the [[Yishuv]] and also after the [[establishment of the State of Israel]].

====Supporters====
Among the most significant supporters was [[Yitzhak Ben Zvi]] (Shimshelevich), leader of the [[Labor (Israel)|Labor movement]], historian and second [[President of the State of Israel]]. He was born in [[Ukraine]] on 24 November 1884. He studied law in Istanbul together with David Ben Gurion. In 1906 he attended the founding conference of the [[Poalei Zion]] and in 1907 he settled in the Land of Israel.&lt;ref name="JAI"/&gt; He belonged to the founders of the [[Ahdut ha-Avodah]] Party, was active in the [[Haganah]], a member of the [[Jewish National Council]], and signed the Israeli Declaration of Independence.&lt;ref name="JAI"/&gt; Ben Zvi died in 1963.

Ben Zvi wrote:
{{quote|text=Our surnames are mostly of foreign origin, which cling to exile [...] even names based on Hebrew first names were damaged and distorted from the original [...] by German and English suffixes, like "son" or "sohn" and the Slavic "in", "ovich", "ovsky" and "shvili". These surnames fill the air and the pages of our newspaper, the posters and announcements in our streets and public squares [...] it is indeed not really clear if the hardship of this inheritance which remained with us as a result of the Middle Ages and subsequent ghettoization should be tolerated...|author=Yitzhak Ben Zvi in ''Collected Writings'', vol. 4, pp. 11–14&lt;ref name="JAI"/&gt;}}

All rabbinic authorities encourage hebraizing first names (VaYikra Rabba 32, and Kor'ei Sh'mo, pp.&amp;nbsp;173–181), and some actively encourage last names, as well (Rabbi Shlomo Aviner (Resp. She'elat Shlomo VIII, 67-68), and even did so themselves: among them: Rabbis Menashe HaKatan (Klein), Maharam Schick, Shlomo Goren (Goronchick), Shaul Yisraeli (Israelite), Moshe Zvi Neria (Menkin), Shlomo Aviner (Langenauer).

====Opponents====
One of the opponents of the Hebraization of surnames was [[Moses Calvary]], a writer and teacher. Born in Germany 1883, he received a traditional, general, and rabbinical education.&lt;ref name="JAI"/&gt; He was a member of [[Ahdut Ha'avodah]], an educator in the [[Meir Shafia]] youth village, principal of the [[Hebrew Gymnasium]] (High School) in [[Jerusalem]], and educator in the "Ahava" youth village in [[Kiryat Bialik]].&lt;ref name="JAI"/&gt;

{{quote|text=Yitzhak Ben Zvi demands we disqualify all the foreign names which are close to us. His assumption was that our immigration to Eretz Yisrael is a revolutionary act, a return to one's origins. Let the memory of the Diaspora therefore be erased so that the crown be returned to ancient times, by wrapping our names in the envelope of our language. I have my doubts if this zealousness is appropriate. Our names are part—a significant part—of our history. Bearers of historical names are still alive and among us; the names of figures who mark our history—names like Sasportas or Benbenisti, Abrabanel or Don Yehia, Rappaport or Eibeschitz—there is no reason to delete the chronicle of our national life. Let us preserve the faith of our fathers also in our revival. Do not betray our memories by radical action; and the text does not only relate to the famous: the variety in our names is a sign of our colorful history, a two-thousand year-old history, whose traces cannot be wiped out light-handedly.|author=Moses Calvary in ''Between Sowing and Harvest'', p. 339&lt;ref name="JAI"/&gt;}}

Some people were emotionally attached to their diaspora last name, for reasons such as it having noble origins ([[Hebrew]]: יִחוּס  ''Yichus''), or for a desire to continue to identify with their [[Jewish ethnic group|ethnic group]].&lt;ref name="W"/&gt; There is story of an Israeli diplomat who told [[David Ben-Gurion]], "I will change my name if you can find me one non-Jew named Lifshitz."&lt;ref name="W"/&gt; Others had names that were entirely Hebrew to begin with.&lt;ref name="W"/&gt;

The disagreement about the Hebraization of surnames continued. Many people preserved their foreign surname, such as first President of Israel [[Chaim Weizmann]], [[Supreme Court of Israel|President of the Supreme Court of Israel]] [[Shimon Agranat]], and others.

===Later===
This trend moderated with time.&lt;ref name="JAI"/&gt; By the time of the wave of immigration from the former [[Soviet Union]] in the 1990s, the practice was waning. The Soviet immigration wave clearly had the effect of weakening the practice of Hebraizing names—as part of the marked general tendency of these immigrants to cling to their specific Russian linguistic and cultural identity. A conspicuous example is the former (2009–2013) Israeli Minister of Tourism, [[Stas Misezhnikov]]. Though an outspoken Israeli nationalist on other issues, Misezhnikov did not feel impelled to change his clearly Slavic surname (nor his equally Slavic first name), and there was no public pressure on him to do so—as there would have been on an Israeli minister during the country's first decades.

However, even today, people continue to Hebraize their surname, especially those serving in the IDF and Israel's diplomatic missions, representing the State of Israel.&lt;ref name="JAI"/&gt; The number of those who do is small but significant; about 15% of American and British immigrants to Israel who come on [[Nefesh B'Nefesh]] flights Hebraize their names on arrival.&lt;ref name=forward/&gt;

There is also a trend of reverting to ancestral, non-Hebrew names to return to one's roots and preserve traditions unique to [[Jewish ethnic group|each ethnic group]].&lt;ref name="JAI"/&gt; There are people who re-adopt the name their family previously abandoned for the sake of "Israeliness", such as Israeli writer [[Yitzhak Orpaz]] who restored his family's original family name of "Averbuch".&lt;ref name="JAI"/&gt;

==Process==
There were several ways people Hebraized their names.

Some names were words that were directly translated from the corresponding Diaspora name.&lt;ref name="W"/&gt;

Others kept their name for several reasons. Sometimes, the reason it was kept was because of its religious nature. For examples, names connected with the [[Kohen]] (priesthood) such as Cohen, Kohn, Kaplan, Sacerdoti, Katz, Azoulai, etc.&lt;ref name="W"/&gt; Other times it indicated Levite descent such as Levi, Levy, Weil ([[anagram]]), and Segal (Hebrew [[acronym]]). Other times it was synagogue or Jewish community functions such as Gabbai, Chazan, or Rabin.&lt;ref name="W"/&gt; Sometimes the surname was already Hebrew (Sarfati).

Others kept their name for its ''yichus'',(meaning that the person descends from something akin to "good stock") which gave the bearer more reason not to Hebraize it.&lt;ref name="W"/&gt; For example, Horowitz (famous rabbinical dynasty), [[Rothschild family|Rothschild]] (famous Jewish banking dynasty), [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] (famous bearer), or Shaltiel (ancient [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic]] family tracing its origins to [[King David]]—and it is [[Shealtiel|already Hebrew]]).&lt;ref name="W"/&gt;

Others kept their name but the name underwent some mutation because they contained sounds that do not exist in Hebrew.&lt;ref name="W"/&gt; Examples include Lando (from "Landau"), and Glober (from "Glauber").&lt;ref name="W"/&gt;

Other "Diaspora" Jewish names are Hebrew to begin with (such as Ashkenazi and Yerushalmi), corruptions of Hebrew words (such as Heifetz (from Chafetz)), Hebrew acronyms (such as Shalit (from "''Sheyihye le'orekh yamim tovim''{{-"}})), or of [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] origin (such as Kahane, or Raban).&lt;ref name="W"/&gt;

Impacts are not easily categorized, having direct and indirect components.&lt;ref name="Mason"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.mu.edu.et/iphc/images/liblary/Heritage/Heritage_Culture_and_Tourism/Tourism_Impacts_Planing__devet.pdf|title=Tourism Impacts, Planning and Management|last1=Mason|first1=Peter|date=2003|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann (Elsevier)|isbn=0 7506 5970X|location=Burlington MA|accessdate=22 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also tourism is often seasonal, and impacts only become apparent after time, with varying effects, and at different stages of development.&lt;ref name="Mason"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Butler 1993"&gt;Pearce, D. G., &amp; Butler, R. W. (1993). ''Tourism Research: Critiques and Challenges''. Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; There are three main categories.
[[File:Mar-del-plata-playa.JPG|thumb|Crowded beach in [[Mar del Plata]] during summer]]

1. Environmental impacts: impacts that affect the [[carrying capacity]] of the area, vegetation, air quality, bodies of water, the [[water table]], wildlife, and natural phenomena.
 
2. Sociocultural impacts: associated with interactions between peoples and culture background, attitudes and behaviors, and their relationships to material goods.&lt;ref name="Mason" /&gt;  The introduction of tourists to sensitive areas can be detrimental, cause a loss of culture, or, alternatively, contribute to the preservation of culture and cultural sites through increased resources.

3. Economic impacts: usually seen as positive, contributing to employment, better services, and social stability. Also it may improve in terms of cultural education which one may have not considered.&lt;ref name="Rollins et al 2016"&gt;Rollins, R., Dearden P. and Fennell, D. (2016) "Tourism, Ecotourism and Protected Areas". In P. Dearden, R. Rollins and M. Needham (ed.), ''Parks and Protected Areas in Canada: Planning and Management'' (4th ed) (p. 391-425) Toronto: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet these impacts can also contribute to high living costs within the community, pushing local business out of the areas, and raising costs for locals &lt;ref name="Rollins et al 2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Muchapondawa 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Muchapondwa, E., &amp; Stage, J.|year=2013|title=The Economic Impacts of Tourism in Botswana, Nimibia and South Africa: is poverty subsiding?|journal=Natural Resources Forum|volume=37|issue=2|pages=80–89|doi=10.1111/1477-8947.12007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental impacts==
{{See also|Environmental impacts of tourism in the Caribbean}}

[[Ecotourism]], [[nature tourism]], [[wildlife tourism]], and [[adventure tourism]] take place in environments such as [[rain forest]]s, high alpine, [[wilderness]], lakes and rivers, coastlines and marine environments, as well as rural villages and coastline resorts. Peoples' desire for more authentic and challenging experiences results in their destinations becoming more remote, to the few remaining pristine and natural environments left on the planet. The positive impact of this can be an increased [[environmental awareness|awareness]] of environmental stewardship.&lt;ref&gt;Moghimehfar, F., &amp; Halpenny, E. A. (2016). "How do people negotiate through their constraints to engage in pro-environmental behavior? A study of front-country campers in Alberta, Canada". ''Tourism Management'', 57, 362-372.&lt;/ref&gt; The negative impact can be a destruction of the very experience that people are seeking. There are direct and indirect impacts, immediate and long-term impacts, and there are impacts that are both proximal and distal to the tourist destination. These impacts can be separated into three categories: facility impacts, tourist activities, and the transit effect.

=== Facility impacts ===
Facility impacts occur when a regional area evolves from "exploration" to "involvement" and then into the "development" stage of the tourist area life cycle.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, R. W. (1980). "The concept of a tourist area cycle of evolution: implications for management of resources". ''The Canadian Geographer/Le Géographe canadien'', 24(1), 5-12.&lt;/ref&gt; During the latter phase there can be both direct and indirect environmental impacts through the construction of [[superstructure]] such as hotels, restaurants, and shops, and [[infrastructure]] such as roads and power supply. As the destination develops, more tourists seek out the experience. Their impacts increase accordingly. The requirement for water for washing, [[waste disposal]], and drinking increases. Rivers can be altered, excessively extracted, and polluted by the demands of tourists. [[Noise pollution]] has the capacity to disturb wildlife and alter behavior, and [[light pollution]] can disrupt the feeding and [[reproductive behaviour]] of many creatures. When power is supplied by diesel or gasoline generators there is additional noise and pollution. General [[waste]] and garbage are also a result of the facilities. As more tourists arrive there is an increase in food and beverages consumed, which in turn creates [[waste plastic]] and [[non-biodegradable]] products.

=== Tourist activities ===
[[File:Turtle riding, Great Barrier Reef (7687773596).jpg|right|thumb|Turtle riding was a popular tourist activity in the 1920s and 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://anmm.wordpress.com/2013/08/10/the-sport-of-turtle-riding-and-the-greatest-liar-on-earth/|title=The sport of turtle riding and 'the Greatest Liar on Earth'|work=[[Australian National Maritime Museum]]|date=2013-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
For many tourists the main reason for their vacation is to engage in various types of physical activities, and enjoy interacting with nature in a way that they would not ordinarily be able to do. These activities, such as [[hiking]], [[trekking]], [[kayaking]], [[bird watching]], wildlife [[safari]]s, [[surfing]], [[snorkelling]], and [[scuba-diving]] all affect the local ecology.
[[File:Get Kenya Tours &amp; Safari Packages.jpg|thumb|Example of a Safari tour in [[Kenya]]]]

There are a range of impacts from hiking, trekking, and [[camping]] that directly affect the activity area. The most obvious is the erosion and compaction of the trail itself. The daily use of the trail by hikers the trail wears the trail down and compacts it. If there are any obstacles such as fallen trees or puddles of mud, then the trail becomes widened or informal trails are created to bypass the obstacle.&lt;ref&gt;Marion, J.L. (1998). "Recreation Ecology Research Findings: Implications for Wilderness and Park Managers". ''Proceedings of the National Outdoor Ethics Conference'', April 18–21, 1996, St. Louis, MO. Gaithersburg, MD: Izaak Walton League of America. pp. 188-196.&lt;/ref&gt; There are a number of other direct impacts on the treaded area, such as damage or removal of [[vegetation]], loss of vegetation height, reduction in foliage cover, exposure of tree root systems, migration of trampled vegetation, and introduction of [[non-native species]].&lt;ref&gt;Marion, J. L., &amp; Leung, Y. F. (2001). "Trail Resource Impacts and an Examination of Alternative Assessment Techniques". ''Journal of Park and Recreation Administration'', 19(3), 17-37.&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as the direct impacts, there are indirect impacts on the trails, such as a change in [[soil porosity]], changes to microflora composition, problems with seed dispersion and germination, and degradation of soil nutrient composition.&lt;ref&gt;Hammitt, W. E., Cole, D. N., &amp; Monz, C. A. (2015). ''Wildland Recreation: Ecology and Management''. John Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt; As many hikers and trekkers take multi-day trips, a large number will camp overnight either in formal or random campgrounds. There are similar impacts on campgrounds such as soil compaction, erosion and composition, loss of vegetation and foliage, plus the additional issues of [[campfires]] for cooking and warmth. Informal trails are created around the campsite in order to collect firewood and water, and trees and saplings can be trampled, damaged, or cut-down for fuel. The heat of campfires may damage tree-root systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Marion, J. L., &amp; Cole, D. N.|year=1996|title=Spatial and temporal variation in soil and vegetation impacts on campsites|journal=Ecological Applications|volume=6|issue=2|pages=520–530|doi=10.2307/2269388 |jstor=2269388|hdl=10919/46861}}&lt;/ref&gt; In formal campgrounds, tent pad areas are normally devoid of any vegetation while random camping can damage sensitive plants and grasses during a single overnight stay.

As with most recreation activities, including hiking and camping, there will be waste generated, food scraps, and human waste. This can cause human-wildlife interactions, such as the habituation of wildlife to human contact and unusual food sources. This can have a detrimental effect on the wildlife and pose dangers for the human. Provision for deposit, collection, and removal of all waste will also have a direct impact on the local environment.

Tourism can act as a vector in the spread of non-native species. With tourism comes an increase and concentration of human activity in specific localized regions of the landscape especially protected wildernesses and parks. Because of the increase in human visitation from many different geographical regions, non-native species are observed at a higher propagation rate in these areas. Typical recreation activities such as hiking, biking, and off-road driving can act as habitat disturbances which may increase the spread of aggressive invasive species, harming the natural ecosystem. Nature-based tourism (i.e., wildlife viewing and outdoor recreation) are thought to be increasing and often happen in more pristine habitats. With the disturbance from human activities, open niches may become available giving opportunity for aggressive non-native species to become established and take advantage of new resource availability. This can have dire consequences on local flora and fauna as invasives tend to be particularly successful in colonizing disturbed areas where the local biotic communities have been affected and potentially harmed.

Examples of invasive species spread by tourism:
-Bigheaded ant (Pheidole megacephala): Is one of the worst invasives and classified under the “worlds 100 worst” invasive species. Originally found in the Galapagos islands in 2007 within ship cargo for tourist supplies. Ants can be spread with the movement of people from one island to another.   
-Cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum): Spread fast, don’t allow native species to grow, can cause forest fires to spread rapidly. Can be carried by people through shoes and gear, pets and other animals can spread the seeds through their travel as well. 
-Zebra Mussels (Dreissena polymorpha): These are believed to have come from the Caspian Sea in Europe in a ships ballast water. They are spread by uncleansed boats from one body of water to another as tourists move to different locations.  

There are ways to decrease the spread of non-native species such as taking care in removing seeds from shoes and pants after hiking or biking. Thoroughly cleaning boats when moving from one body of water to another and creating designated pathway management plans are other ways in which one can decrease the impacts of invasive species on local habitats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schaeffer |first1=S.

Another activity that can have severe direct and indirect impacts on the environment is [[wildlife viewing]]. This happens in a range of formats, on land and in the ocean. Wildlife safaris in African countries such as [[Kenya]], [[Botswana]], and [[Tanzania]] have been popular for many years. Their focus are the [[big five game]] megafauna: the [[African lion]], [[African elephant]], [[African leopard]], [[cape buffalo]], and [[rhinoceros]]. As with every human-wildlife interaction, there is a change in the natural interaction of the species. The mere presence of humans can increase the heart rate and [[stress hormones]] of even the largest animal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2193/2006-015 |title=Stress Response of Working African Elephants to Transportation and Safari Adventures |journal=Journal of Wildlife Management |volume=71 |issue=4 |pages=1257–1260 |year=2007 |last1=Millspaugh |first1=Joshua J. |last2=Burke |first2=Tarryne |last3=Van Dyk |first3=GUS |last4=Slotow |first4=ROB |last5=Washburn |first5=Brian E. |last6=Woods |first6=Rami J. |url=https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1721&amp;context=icwdm_usdanwrc }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other changes in behavior have been recognized. For example, [[baboons]] and [[hyenas]] have learnt to track tourist [[safari]] vehicles to lead them to [[cheetah]] kills, which they then steal.&lt;ref&gt;Roe, D., Leader-Williams, N., &amp; Dalal-Clayton, D. B. (1997). "Take only photographs, leave only footprints: the environmental impacts of wildlife tourism", (No. 10). Iied.&lt;/ref&gt; This direct impact of can severely damage the delicate balance of the [[food webs]] and [[keystone species]].

There is a small but significant number of tourists who pay considerable sums of money in order to [[Trophy hunting|trophy hunt]] [[lion]]s, [[rhino]], [[leopard]]s, and even [[giraffes]]. It has been argued that there is a positive and negative, direct and indirect, environmental impact caused by [[trophy hunting]]. There is a continued discussion at federal and international government level as to the ethics of funding conservation efforts through hunting activities.&lt;ref&gt;Ripple, W. J., Newsome, T. M., &amp; Kerley, G. I. (2016). "Does Trophy Hunting Support Biodiversity? A Response to Di Minin, et al.". ''Trends in Ecology and Evolution''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another tourism destination activity is [[scuba diving]]. There are many negative direct environmental impacts caused by [[recreational diving]]. The most apparent is the damage caused by poorly skilled divers standing on the reef itself or by accidentally hitting the fragile coral with their fins. Studies have shown that "naïve" divers who engage in [[underwater photography]] are considerably more likely to accidentally damage the reef.&lt;ref&gt;Sorice, M. G., Oh, C. O., &amp; Ditton, R. B. (2007). "Managing scuba divers to meet ecological goals for coral reef conservation". ''AMBIO: A Journal of the Human Environment'', 36(4), 316-322.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lloret|first1=Javier|last2=Marín|first2=Arnaldo|last3=Marín-Guirao|first3=Lázaro|last4=Francisca Carreño|first4=M.|title=An alternative approach for managing scuba diving in small marine protected areas|journal=Aquatic Conservation: Marine and Freshwater Ecosystems|date=2006|volume=16|issue=6|pages=579–591|doi=10.1002/aqc.734|language=en|issn=1052-7613}}&lt;/ref&gt;As the cost of underwater photography equipment has declined and its availability increased, it is inevitable that there will be an increase of direct damage to [[reefs]] by divers. Other direct impacts include over-fishing for "marine curios", sedimentation, and in-fill.&lt;ref&gt;Hawkins, J. P., &amp; Roberts, C. M. (1994). "The growth of coastal tourism in the Red Sea: present and future effects on coral reefs". ''Ambio'', 23(8), 503-508.&lt;/ref&gt; There is also direct environmental impact due to disturbed and altered species behaviour from fish feeding, as well as import of invasive species and pollution caused by dive-boats. There are also indirect impacts such as shoreline construction of superstructure and infrastructure.

=== Transit effects ===
{{see|Environmental impact of transport}}
Since 2009 there has been a steady yearly increase in the number of tourist arrivals worldwide of approximately 4.4 percent. In 2015 there were 1.186 billion tourist arrivals worldwide, of which 54 percent arrived [[air travel|by air]] (640 million), 39 percent (462 million) by motor vehicle, 5 percent [[Ship transport|by water]] (59 million), and 2 percent by [[rail travel|rail]] (23.7 million).&lt;ref&gt;World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) [http://mkt.unwto.org/publication/unwto-tourism-highlights-2016-edition Tourism Highlights], 2016 Edition [internet]. Accessed 28 November 2016&lt;/ref&gt; A seven-hour flight on a Boeing 747 produces 220 tonnes of [[carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]], which is the equivalent of driving an average size family saloon car for a year, or the energy requirement of an average family home for nearly 17 years.&lt;ref&gt;You Sustain [internet] available from www.yousustain.com 2016. accessed 26 November 2016&lt;/ref&gt; With the ever-increasing number of tourist arrivals, there is an ever-increasing quantity of global [[greenhouse gas]]ses (GHG) being produced by the [[tourism industry]]. In 2015 it is estimated that 5 percent of global GHG emissions was attributable to air travel alone.

As more eco-tourists seek remote, pristine, undeveloped regions, and practise low-impact, "[[leave no trace]]" adventure vacations, their GHG contributions have increased exponentially. As a result of the accumulation of GHGs the annual average global temperature is rising each year. New records were set in 2014, 2015 and it is predicted that 2016 will yet again exceed the previous highest average global temperature.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenzweig, C., Karoly, D., Vicarelli, M., Neofotis, P., Wu, Q., Casassa, G., ... &amp; Tryjanowski, P. (2008). "Attributing physical and biological impacts to anthropogenic climate change". ''Nature'', 453(7193), 353-357.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 2016. [internet]available from http://ipcc.ch accessed 28 November 2016&lt;/ref&gt; It is causing the oceans to warm and causing increased frequency of abnormal weather events such as floods and hurricanes. The increase in the amount of CO&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; dissolved into the oceans is changing its chemical composition, leading to [[Ocean acidification|acidification]] of the oceans, which in turn has led to [[coral bleaching|bleaching]] of [[coral reef]]s worldwide.

In 2016 it was determined that the world's largest coral reef, the [[Great Barrier Reef]], is so badly affected by bleaching that only 10 percent remained unspoiled and the remaining 90 percent has varying degrees of degradation&lt;ref&gt;Coral Coalition (2016 )Great Barrier Reef bleaching [internet] available from www.coralcoe.org.au accessed on 26 November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; A recently discovered issue in the [[Pacific Northwest]] caused by acidification, is the decreased survival of [[pteropod]]s, a key source of food for [[salmon]].  These microscopic invertebrates, known as sea butterflies, are unable to form their outer shells and die.&lt;ref&gt;Orr, J. C., Fabry, V. J., Aumont, O., Bopp, L., Doney, S. C., Feely, R. A., ... &amp; Key, R. M. (2005). "Anthropogenic [[ocean acidification]] over the twenty-first century and its impact on calcifying organisms". ''Nature'', 437(7059), 681-686.&lt;/ref&gt; These tiny creatures make up a significant portion of the salmon diet. Without this nutrition available to the salmon, they may not grow to maturity to return to their spawning grounds to reproduce and provide food for [[bears]]. Bears [[nutrient cycle|cycle nutrients]] through the forest, where tourists come to view or hunt the bears. Thus the [[food web]] is disturbed. [[Anthropogenic climate change]] has both a direct and indirect impact on tourism.

== Sociocultural impacts of tourism ==
An inherent aspect of tourism is the seeking of [[wikt:authenticity|authenticity]], the desire to experience a different cultural setting in its natural environment.&lt;ref name="Fernandes"&gt;([http://www.cabi.org/cabebooks/FullTextPDF/2013/20133092981.pdf Fernandes]){{Dead link|date=August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fagence"&gt;(Fagence, http://www.cabi.org/cabebooks/FullTextPDF/2003/20033017728.pdf){{Dead link|date=August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although cultural tourism provides opportunities for understanding and education, there are serious impacts that arise as a result. It is not only the volume of tourism at work, but the types of [[social interaction]]s that occur between tourist and host. There are three broad effects at the local level: the commodification of culture, the demonstration effect, and the acculturation of another culture.

===Commodification of culture===
[[Commodification]] of culture refers to the use of a cultural traditions and artifacts in order to sell and profit for the local economy. With the rise of [[tourism]], authors argue that commodification is inevitable.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shepard|first=Robert|date=August 2002|title=Commodification, culture and tourism|url=|journal=Tourist Studies|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are both positive and negative sociocultural impacts of commodification on a culture. One positive is the creation of business and jobs for local craftsmen, who are able to sell their goods to tourists. [[Rural tourism]] is seen as a “cure” for poverty and leads to the improvement of transportation and development of telecommunications in an area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://english.gov.cn/news/top_news/2017/03/06/content_281475586651838.htm|title=Tourism seen as cure for poverty in central, west regions|website=english.gov.cn|access-date=2018-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the tourist, commodification creates an interest for traditional arts and social practices.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, critics of commodification believe that tourists are not interested in cultural beliefs and traditions of the locals, but are rather obsessed with owning a part of it. The argument that by monetizing cultural artifacts locals lose the value to their culture also exists. It then leads to the belief that tours are no longer authentic experiences. However, development economists will argue that culture can be utilized just as any other natural resource.

Researchers look at the impact of tourists on a culture and in short, many argue that the contact with the secular West leads to the destruction of pre-tourist cultures.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In addition, the “development cure”, the idea that increasing tourism will spur economic change while strengthening local culture, is claimed to lead to new diseases, such as “[[Addiction|drug addiction]], [[crime]], [[pollution]], [[prostitution]], and a decline in social stability” as well as growth of capitalist values and a [[Consumer Culture|consumer culture]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Demonstration effect===
The [[demonstration effect]] was introduced to tourism when researchers were looking into the effects of social influences from [[tourism]] on local communities. The demonstration effect argues that local inhabitants copy the behavioral patterns of tourists.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fisher|first=David|title=The Demonstration Effect Revisited|journal=Annals of Tourism Research|volume=31|issue=2|pages=428–446|doi=10.1016/j.annals.2004.01.001|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a number of [[social]], [[Economy|economic]] and [[behavior]]al reasons as to why the demonstration effect comes into play. One economic and social reason is that locals copy the consumption patterns of those higher up the social scale in order to improve their [[social status]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Tourism has also been accused of affecting social behavior of the younger members of a host community, who may imitate what tourists do, impacting traditional value systems.

==== Criticisms of the demonstration effect ====
There are many criticisms to the demonstration effect in tourism. Firstly, tourism is seen as only one aspect of change in a society. Local people will also see examples of foreign lifestyles and consumption in [[Advertising|advertisements]], [[magazine]]s, on [[television]], and in [[film]]s, and therefore tourism is not the only influence on local culture.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In addition, the demonstration effect implies that a culture is “weak” and needs to be protected by outside influences. In many cases, the demonstrative effect is seen as a negative consequence, but it is argued that “all cultures are in a continual process of change”,  therefore tourism should not be considered destructive.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Community participation ===
[[Public participation|Community participation]] refers to the collaboration between community members for the purposes of achieving common goals, improving their local community and pursuing individual benefits.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jaafar|first=Mastura|last2=Rasoolimanesh|first2=S Mostafa|last3=Ismail|first3=Safura|title=Perceived sociocultural impacts of tourism and community participation: A case study of Langkawi Island|journal=Tourism and Hospitality Research|language=en-US|volume=17|issue=2|pages=123–134|doi=10.1177/1467358415610373|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local community members are actively involved in tourism, rather than passively benefiting from it. Community participation strengthens communities and help to create a sense of belonging, trust and credibility among members.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; By involving local community members, tourism can become more authentic. The community and the tourists both benefit from community participation, as it boosts their respect for the traditional lifestyle and values of the destination community. Most destination community members are also the ones most impacted by tourism, therefore there is an importance in their involvement in tourism planning. Some researchers will argue that some of the negative impacts of tourism might be avoided and the positive impacts maximized through community participation in the planning process.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Acculturation===
[[Acculturation]] is the process of modifying an existing [[culture]] through borrowing from the more dominant of cultures. Typically in tourism, the community being acculturated is the destination community, which then experiences dramatic shifts in social structure and world view. Societies adapt to acculturation in one of two ways. Innovation diffusion is when the community adopts practices that are developed by another group; whereas cultural adaptation is less adoption of a new culture and more the process of changing when the existing culture is changed.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=KASTAMU|first=MATATIZO PETER|title=Tourism as Acculturation Process and a Modern Leisure Activity|url=https://www.academia.edu/14883309|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acculturation is often seen as a method of modernizing a community and there are many opposing views to the concept of modernization. One argument against modernization is that it contributes to the “homogenization of cultural differences and the decline of traditional societies”.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This means that communities will advertise their modernity to attract tourists, and will disregard their traditional customs and values. On the other hand, others argue that acculturation and modernization will help traditional communities adjust in a modern world. The idea being that teaching people to adapt will save the community from future extinction.

=== Positive socio-cultural impacts===

There are number of benefits for the host community as a result of tourism. This includes economic benefits such as opportunities for local businesses which allows for increased [[trade]] among the increased number of visitors and then develops a variety of local businesses. In addition, tourism also brings employment opportunities, enhances the economy of the region, and creates revenue for the local government. Tourists also use [[public service]]s, creating funding for public services, such as health, the police and the fire department, as well as increasing the demand for [[public transport]]. Other public facilities, such as parks and benches are also well kept by the community for the tourists, improving the overall [[aesthetics]] of the host community. On a more social level, tourism leads to intercultural interaction. Tourists often engage and learn from the locals. Tourism can also increase pride in locals. They want to show off their community that tourists have chosen to visit. The increase in people also leads to creating more social venues and experiences where locals and tourists can interact in. [[Entertainment]] and [[recreation]]al facilities will allow for more opportunity to socialize and engage with each other.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Deery|first=Margaret|last2=Jago|first2=Leo|last3=Fredline|first3=Liz|title=Rethinking social impacts of tourism research: A new research agenda|journal=Tourism Management|volume=33|issue=1|pages=64–73|doi=10.1016/j.tourman.2011.01.026|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tourism can be beneficial for the host community as it provides the financial means and the incentive to preserve cultural histories, [[local heritage]] sites, and customs. It stimulates interest in local crafts, traditional activities, songs, dance, and [[oral histories]]. It also opens up the community to the wider world, new ideas, new experiences, and new ways of thinking.&lt;ref name="Ryan"&gt;Ryan, C. (2003). [https://books.google.com/books?id=OifwDs6PcM4C&amp;pg=PR7 Recreational tourism: Demand and impacts] (Vol. 11). Channel View Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="Ryan"/&gt;

=== Negative sociocultural impacts ===
There can be negative effects from cultural interactions.&lt;ref&gt;Long, V. H. (1999). "Techniques for socially [[sustainable tourism]] development: lessons from Mexico". ''Department of Geography Publication Series'', University of Waterloo, 52, 193-212.&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of economic disadvantages, local communities need to be able to fund the tourist demands, which leads to an increase of taxes. The overall price of living increases in tourist destinations in terms of rent and rates, as well as property values going up. This can be problematic for locals looking to buy property or others on a fixed income.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In addition, to balance out tourist destinations, the number of locals to tourists must be relatively equal. This can be more problematic for tourists as their access could be denied. Other negative sociocultural impacts are differences in social and moral values among the local host community and the visiting tourist. Outside of affecting the relationship between tourist and local, it can also cause friction between groups of the local population. In addition, it can cause drifts in the dynamics between the old and new generations. Tourism has also correlated to the rise of delinquent behaviors in local host communities. [[Crime]] rates have been seen to rise with the increase of tourists. Crimes are typically those of rowdy behavior, [[alcohol]] and illegal [[drug user|drug use]], and loud noise. In addition, [[gambling]] and [[prostitution]] is increased due to tourists looking for a “good time”.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Tourism has also caused more disruption in host communities. Crowding of locals and tourists may create a vibrant ambiance, it also causes frustration and leads to the withdrawal of local residents in many places. Increased tourists also results in increased traffic which can hinder daily life of the local residents.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Economic impacts ==
Global tourism in 2014 contributed 3.7 percent (US$2.5 billion) to the world's [[Gross domestic product|GDP]], with its total contribution rising to almost 10 percent of world GDP.&lt;ref name="Turner 2015"&gt;Turner, R. (2015). ''Travel and Tourism: Economic Impact 2015 World'' (pp. 1-20). London: WTO.&lt;/ref&gt; The GDP increase comes from the over one billion international tourists worldwide, a number that has been growing by 5 percent annually since 2012.&lt;ref name="Muchapondwa 2013"&gt;Muchapondwa, E., &amp; Stage, J. (2013). "The economic impacts of tourism in Botswana, Namibia and South Africa: Is poverty subsiding?", ''Natural Resources Forum'', 37(2), 80-89.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Norjana et al., 2014"&gt;Norjanah, Mohd B., Jaafar Mastura, and Mohamad Diana. (2014) "Perceptions of Local Communities on the Economic Impacts of Tourism Development in Langkawi, Malaysia". ''SHS Web of Conferences'', vol. 12, 2014, p. 01100&lt;/ref&gt; Visits and boosts to GDP are expected to continue to rise in the near future as falling oil prices contribute to reduced living costs and increased available income for households, as well as reduced costs for air travel.

Tourism can be divided into subcategories into which impacts fall: spending from visitors on tourism experiences like beach holidays and theme parks (domestic and international), spending on leisure items like bicycles, business spending, and capital investment.&lt;ref name="Turner 2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Zhang et al"&gt;Zhang, J., Madsen, B., &amp; Jensen-Butler, C. (2007). "Regional economic impacts of tourism: The case of Denmark". ''Regional Studies'', 41(6), 839-854.&lt;/ref&gt;

The economic contribution of tourism is felt in both direct and indirect ways, where direct economic impacts are created when commodities like the following are sold: accommodation and entertainment, food and beverages services, and retail opportunities.  Residents, visitors, businesses, and various levels of governments (municipal to federal) all influence direct tourism impacts through their spending in or near a given tourism area.&lt;ref name="Turner 2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Muchapondwa 2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Goeldner and Ritchie 2007"&gt;Goeldner, C. R., &amp; Ritchie, J. B. (2007). ''Tourism Principles, Practices, Philosophies''. John Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt; The key component of direct economic impacts of tourism is that they occur within a country's borders and are implemented by "residents and non-residents for business and leisure purposes".&lt;ref name="Turner 2015"/&gt;

In contrast, indirect economic impacts of tourism can be found in investment spending surrounding a tourism offering from private and governmental interests. This investment may not explicitly be related to tourism, but benefits the tourist and local [[Project stakeholder|stakeholders]] all the same.&lt;ref name="Turner 2015"/&gt;  Indirect impacts of tourism are exemplified by the purchase and sale of intermediary items like additional supplies for restaurants during the high tourism season, or widened sidewalks in busy downtown centres.&lt;ref name="Muchapondwa 2013" /&gt; Indirect economic impacts (the supply chain, investment, and government collective) account for 50.7 percent of the total GDP contribution from travel and tourism in 2014.&lt;ref name="Turner 2015"/&gt;

Induced spending, the re-circulation of a tourist dollar within a community, is another way that tourism indirectly has an impact on a community.&lt;ref name="Rollins et al"&gt;Rollins, R., Dearden, P. and Fennell, D. (2016). "Tourism, ecotourism and protected areas". In P. Dearden, R. Rollins and M. Needham (eds.), ''Parks and protected areas in Canada: Planning and management'' (4th ed) (pp. 391 - 425). Toronto: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a foreign tourist injects money into the local economy when he spends a dollar on a souvenir made by a local at the tourism destination. That individual goes on to spend that dollar on lunch from a local vendor, and that vendor goes on to spend it locally.&lt;ref name="Mason"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wagner 1997"&gt;Wagner, J. E. (1997). "Estimating the economic impacts of tourism". ''Annals of Tourism Research'', 24(3), 592-608.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Positive and negative economic impacts of tourism ===
There are both positive and negative effects on communities related to the economic impacts of tourism in their communities.&lt;ref name="Rollins et al"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wagner 1997"/&gt;  A positive impact can refer to the increase in jobs, a higher quality of life for locals, and an increase in wealth of an area. Tourism also has the advantage of rebuilding and restoring historic sites and encouraging the revitalization of cultures.&lt;ref name="Wyllie"&gt;Robert W. Wyllie. 2000. ''Tourism and Society; A guide to problems and issues''. Venture Publishing. State College, Pennsylvania. Chapters 01-03&lt;/ref&gt; A positive impact is to increase or to make better either for the [[tourist]], the host community and residence and/or the tourist destination. Positive impacts are related more to the materialistic well-being, rather than to the happiness of a host community or tourist.&lt;ref&gt;Kyungmi K. (2002) Doctor of Philosophy in Hospitality and Tourism and Management: [https://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/bitstream/handle/10919/29954/Title_and_Text.pdf?sequence=1 The Effects of Tourism Impacts upon Quality of Life of Residents in the community], Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University. Retrieved from: November 28, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[tourist]] destination enjoys positive impacts, if there have been improvements to the natural environment such as protection, [[national parks]], or man-made [[infrastructure]], waste-treatment plants. Tourism provides the economic stimulus to allow for diversification of employment and income potential, and develop resources within the community. Improvements in infrastructure and services can benefit both the locals and the tourists.&lt;ref name="Fernandes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fagence" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mason"/&gt; Whereas, [[heritage tourism]] focuses on local history or historical events that occurred in the area, and tends to promote education.&lt;ref&gt;Pigram, J. J. (1993). "Planning for Tourism in Rural Areas: Bridging the Policy Implementation Gap". ''Tourism Research: Critiques and Challenges. Routledge, London, 156-174.&lt;/ref&gt; Positive impacts begin when there is an increase in job opportunities for locals as the tourism industry becomes more developed. There is also an increase in average income that spreads throughout the community when tourism is capitalized on.&lt;ref name="Rollins et al"/&gt; In addition, the local [[economy]] is stimulated and diversified, goods are manufactured more locally, and new markets open for local business owners to expand to.&lt;ref name="Rollins et al"/&gt; Unfortunately, these benefits are not universal nor invulnerable. While more employment may be available, tourism-related jobs are often seasonal and low-paying.&lt;ref name="Rollins et al"/&gt; Prices are known to fluctuate throughout the year. They rise in the high tourist season to take advantage of more tourist dollars, but have the side effect of pricing goods above the economic reach of local residents, effectively starving them out of a place that was once their home.&lt;ref name="Muchapondwa 2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rollins et al"/&gt;

Negative impacts are the effects, that are caused in most cases, at the [[tourist]] destination site with detrimental impacts to the [[social]] and [[cultural]] area, as well as the natural environment. As the [[population]] increases so do the impacts, [[resources]] become unsustainable and exhausted, the carrying capacity for [[tourists]] in a destination site may become depleted.&lt;ref name="Nelson"&gt;J.G Nelson, R. Butler, G. Wall. (1999). "Tourism and Sustainable Development; A Civic Approach". ''Heritage Resource Centre Joint Publication'', Number 2. ''University of Waterloo and Department of Geography Publication Series'', Number 52. University of Waterloo&lt;/ref&gt; Often, when negative impacts occur, it is too late to impose restrictions and [[regulations]]. Tourist destinations seem to discover that many of the negative impacts are found in the development stage of the tourism area life cycle (TALC).&lt;ref name="Nelson" /&gt;

Additionally, the economics of tourism have been shown to push out local tourism business owners in favour of strangers to the region.&lt;ref name="Rollins et al"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mason"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wagner 1997"/&gt; Foreign ownership creates leakage (revenues leaving the host community for another nation or multinational business) which strips away the opportunity for locals to make meaningful profits.&lt;ref name="Rollins et al"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tyrrell"&gt;Tyrrell, T. J., &amp; Johnston, R. J. (2006). "The Economic Impacts of Tourism: A Special Issue". ''Journal of Travel Research'', 45(1), 3-7.&lt;/ref&gt; Foreign companies are also known to hire non-resident seasonal workers because they can pay those individuals lower wages, which further contributes to economic leakage. Tourism can raise property values near the tourism area, effectively pushing out locals and encouraging businesses to migrate inwards to encourage and take advantage of more tourist spending.&lt;ref name="Rollins et al"/&gt;

=== Employment ===
[[Employment]], and both its availability and exclusivity, are subsets of economic impacts of tourism.&lt;ref name="Tyrrell"/&gt; [[Travel]] and [[tourism]] create 10.7 percent of the total available jobs worldwide, in both the direct and indirect tourism sectors.&lt;ref name="Turner 2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tyrrell"/&gt; Direct tourism jobs, those that provide the visitor with their tourism experience include, but are not limited to: accommodation (building, cleaning, managing), food and drink services, entertainment, manufacturing, and shopping&lt;ref name="Rollins et al"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wagner 1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tyrrell"/&gt; Indirect tourism employment opportunities include the manufacturing of aircraft, boats, and other transportation, as well as the construction of additional [[superstructure]] and [[infrastructure]] necessary to accommodate these travel products (airports, harbours, etc.)&lt;ref name="Tyrrell"/&gt;

===Tourism Satellite Account (TSA)===
The [[World Travel and Tourism Council]] (WTTC) tourism satellite account (TSA) is a system of measurement recognized by the United Nations to define the extent of an economic sector that is not so easily defined as industries like [[forest industry|forestry]] or [[oil and gas industry|oil and gas]] &lt;ref name="Tyrrell"/&gt; Tourism does not fit neatly into a statistical model; because it is not so much dependent on the physical movement of products and services, as it is on the position of the [[consumer]].&lt;ref name="Tyrrell"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Buhalis"/&gt; Therefore, TSAs were designed to standardize these many offerings for an international scale to facilitate better understanding of current tourism circumstances locally and abroad.&lt;ref name="Tyrrell"/&gt; The standardization includes concepts, classifications, and definitions, and is meant to enable researchers, industry professionals, and the average tourism business owner to view international comparisons.&lt;ref name="Tyrrell"/&gt;
Before TSAs were widely implemented, a gap existed in the available knowledge about tourism as an economic driver for GDP, employment, investment, and industry consumption; indicators were primarily approximations and therefore lacking in scientific and analytical viewpoints.&lt;ref name="Goeldner and Ritchie 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tyrrell"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Buhalis"&gt;Buhalis, D., &amp; Costa, C. (2006). ''Tourism Management Dynamics: Trends, Management, and Tools''. Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; This gap meant missed opportunities for development, as tourism stakeholders were unable to understand where they might be able to better establish themselves in the tourism economy. For example, a TSA can measure tax revenues related to tourism, which is a key contributor to the level of enthusiasm any level of government might have towards potential tourism investment.&lt;ref name="Tyrrell"/&gt; In addition, Tyrrell and Johnston &lt;ref name="Tyrrell"/&gt; suggest that stakeholders in tourism benefit from the TSA because it:
* provides credible data on the impact of tourism and the associated employment
* is a framework for organizing statistical data on tourism
* is an international standard endorsed by the UN Statistical Commission
* is an instrument for designing economic policies related to tourism development
* provides data on tourism's impact on a nation's balance of payments
* provides information on tourism human resource characteristics

Through collection of more qualitative data and translating it into a more concise and effective form for tourism providers, TSAs are able to fill the previous knowledge gap.&lt;ref name="Buhalis"/&gt; Information delivered and measured by a TSA includes tax revenues, economic impact on national balances, human resources, employment, and "tourism's contribution to gross domestic product".&lt;ref name="Tyrrell"/&gt;

=== Projections for 2020 ===
Predictions for the extent to which impacts of tourism will impact the [[world economy|world's economic system]] appear to agree that the number of international tourist arrivals will reach approximately 1.6 billion by the year 2020.&lt;ref name="Muchapondwa 2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tyrrell"/&gt; Of those tourists, 1.18 billion are expected to be intra-regional, and 377 million to be long-haul.&lt;ref name="Tyrrell"/&gt; Of these travelers, arrivals in [[developing countries]] are expected to continue growing from the recorded 47% of total arrivals recorded in 2011 as access to these more remote locations becomes easier&lt;ref name="Muchapondwa 2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Norjana et al., 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Zhang et al" /&gt;
Direct contributions of travel and tourism to the world economy and [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] are expected to rise from 3.09 percent in 2015 to 3.3 percent in 2025, with most impacts found in the investment and supply chain sectors.&lt;ref name="Turner 2015"/&gt; [[employment rate|Employment]] is anticipated to rise parallel to GDP contributions; reaching 3.9 percent of world employment in 2025 (up from 3.6 percent in 2015).&lt;ref name="Turner 2015"/&gt; Direct tourism employment in 2025 will be an estimated 3.9 percent of total world employment (up from approximately 3.6 percent in 2015), while indirect tourism employment will be at approximately 4.5 percent (up from 3.6 percent in 2015).&lt;ref name="Turner 2015"/&gt;

'''''In the Tall Grass''''' is a novella written by [[Stephen King]] and his son [[Joe Hill (writer)|Joe Hill]]. It was originally published in two parts in the June/July and August 2012 issues of ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' magazine. This is King and Hill's second collaboration since ''[[Throttle (novella)|Throttle]]'', published in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.esquire.com/features/june-july-2012-contents&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.esquire.com/features/august-2012-contents&lt;/ref&gt; On October 9, 2012, ''In the Tall Grass'' was released in [[e-book]] and [[audiobook]] formats, the latter read by [[Stephen Lang (actor)|Stephen Lang]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/dp/1442359889/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot summary==
Cal and Becky Demuth are inseparable siblings (being called Irish-[[twins]] by their parents, although they are 19 months apart). Becky finds out during her [[sophomore]] year of college that she is [[pregnant]], leading the twins' parents to suggest she go live with her aunt and uncle until the baby is born. Since it is [[spring break]], Cal decides to accompany her on her cross-country trip. They stop at numerous tourist locations along the way, including the [[biggest ball of twine]].

After driving for about three days, they stop at a field of tall grass after they hear a little boy named Tobin calling for help. The twins stand outside the field, listening to Tobin screaming for help, and his mother Natalie yelling at him to stop yelling, saying that "he will hear you". Cal thinks he hears Tobin just a few feet inside the field. Cal walks into it to rescue the boy, Natalie's cries having mysteriously gone silent. At first, Tobin's voice sounds so close, Cal dives for him, only to end up lying in a puddle of gritty water. Tobin's voice now sounds about twenty feet away.

Becky, scared of being left alone, calls 911 as she follows Cal into the field, but the signal is cut off when she is just a few feet in. While trudging along looking for Tobin (and Becky), Cal stumbles across a [[golden retriever]]'s dead body, having died of dehydration. An hour and a half of cat-and-mouse calling, running, and chasing later, none of the three have located each other.

Becky continues to call for Cal and Tobin, but has no luck and recites [[limericks]] to comfort herself, as she is dehydrated and tired. She spies someone ahead, and a man steps out of the grass in front of her. He introduces himself as Ross, saying that he is the father of Tobin and the husband of Natalie. He begs Becky to follow him, saying that she will be safe with him. Despite not trusting Ross, she follows him anyway. He lures her to a stamped-down circle of grass, where Becky finds Natalie's bloody, dismembered body. Ross explains that he found "the rock" and that "the dancing men have shown him the secrets of the tall grass". He then attacks her, trying to kill the baby, but Becky stabs him to death with her house key.

Cal, now severely dehydrated and exhausted in his attempts to look for Becky, feverishly drinks the gritty water that the long grass grows in. Now half-crazed, he attempts to burn down the field, but the grass is so wet that none of his [[matches]] burn for more than a few seconds. He then finally runs into Tobin, who is eating a dead, rotting [[crow]]. Tobin explains that the rotting dog was his, and that "the tall grass doesn't move dead things." Tobin leads Cal into a clearing in the middle of the grass, where a large rock (with strange drawings of dancing men and words written all over it) stands  in the middle of it. Tobin says that the rock will help Cal find Becky like the rock helped Tobin and Ross find each other. Cal, despite his fear of the rock and the strange, seemingly-moving drawings, gives in and touches it.

Meanwhile, Becky gives [[premature birth]]. Cal and Tobin then appear and wrap the baby in a shirt. Becky then passes out to "slurping sounds." When she wakes up, her baby is nowhere in sight. Cal and Tobin drag a half-conscious Becky to the rock and throw her on it.

An unspecified amount of time later, an [[RV]] full of [[hippies]] pulls into a parking lot across the street to have a [[barbeque]] and smoke [[marijuana]]. They hear Tobin's calls for help, and the whole group walks into the tall grass to help.

== Film adaptation ==
{{Main|In the Tall Grass (film)}}
Director [[Vincenzo Natali]] wanted to do a film adaption of ''In The Tall Grass'' as early as 2015 when he announced:&lt;blockquote&gt;"Who would think that grass could be frightening?

They have transformed an otherwise innocuous Kansas field into a stage for some of the most disturbing horror fiction I have ever read." &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/in-the-tall-grass-movie-netflix/|title=Stephen King Adaption 'In The Tall Grass' Headed to Netflix|last=Evangelista|first=Chris|date=May 8, 2018|website=Slash Film|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=May 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;but the project failed to start. Then in May 2018 the video streaming site [[Netflix]] announced that it has purchased the film rights with Vincenzo Natali as director, who also wrote the adapted screenplay.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4885">[[File:Breton dialectes.svg|thumb|[[Lower Brittany]] (in various colours) and [[Upper Brittany]] in grey]]

The '''language boundary in Brittany''' is the [[language border]] between the part of [[Brittany]] where [[Breton language|Breton]] (a [[Celtic language]]) is spoken and the area in Brittany where [[Gallo language|Gallo]] (a [[Romance language]]) is spoken. The existence of this linguistic border led to differentiate the Celtic-speaking [[Lower Brittany]] (West) from the Romance-speaking [[Upper Brittany]] (East).

The farthest eastern extension of the Breton language was in the ninth century, when the linguistic border was located near [[Nantes]] and [[Rennes]]. Breton declined inexorably in favor of the Gallo gradually moving westward along a [[Binic]]-[[Guérande]] line. The border can now be traced along a line from [[Plouha]] to [[Rhuys]]. The linguistic unification of France, completed after [[World War II]], made somewhat obsolete the linguistic aspect of the distinction between Upper and Lower Brittany, although many people still consider it valid in terms of [[toponymy]], culture and identity.&lt;ref&gt;Fañch Broudic, À la recherche de la frontière. La limite linguistique entre Haute et Basse-Bretagne aux xixe et xxe siècles, Brest, Ar Skol Vrezoneg, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

==History ==
[[File:Dialectes Breton.png|thumb|right|Decline of the Breton language from the 10th to the 20th century.]]
[[File:Distribution relative des brittophones en 2004.png|thumb|Percentage of Breton-speaking people as of 2004, according to the [[Ofis Publik ar Brezhoneg|Office de la langue bretonne]]. Dark red represents 25-30%, white represents 0-2%.]]

Place-names are one form of evidence for the linguistic boundary during the [[Early Middle Ages]], suggesting that it was much farther to the east than it is now, near [[Nantes]] and [[Rennes]]. For example, [[Pleugueneuc]], in [[Ille-et-Vilaine]], combines the Breton element ''plou'' (parish) with the name 'Guehenoc'.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Jackson, ''[http://www.reference-global.com/doi/abs/10.1515/zcph.1961.28.1.272 Linguistic Geography and the History of the Breton Language]'' (1961), online at reference-global.com&lt;/ref&gt;

The distinction of two Brittanys was made at least as early as the 15th century, when the names used were ''Britannia gallicana'' (Gallic Brittany) and ''Britannia britonizans'' (Brittonic Brittany).&lt;ref name=cc&gt;John T. Koch (ed.), ''Celtic Culture: a historical encyclopedia'', Volumes 1-5 (2006), p. 244&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, it appears that Lower Brittany had a separate [[tax|fiscal]] status. Since then, the boundary between them has changed slowly as a result of the long retreat of the Breton language.&lt;ref&gt;Hervé Abalain, ''Histoire de la langue bretonne'' (1995), p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the ''[[Ancien Régime|ancien régime]]'', the boundary between the two was generally in line with the province's division into nine [[episcopal see|bishoprics]], with those of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Rennes|Rennes]], [[Ancient Diocese of Dol|Dol]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Nantes|Nantes]], [[Ancient Diocese of Saint-Malo|St Malo]] and [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Saint-Brieuc|St Brieuc]] considered to form Upper Brittany, while [[Ancient Diocese of Tréguier|Tréguier]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Vannes|Vannes]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Quimper|Quimper]] and [[Diocese of Saint-Pol-de-Léon|Saint-Pol-de-Léon]] formed Lower Brittany.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica'', Volume 4 (1894), p. 320&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1588, the [[historian]] [[Bertrand d'Argentré]] defined the boundary as running from the outskirts of [[Binic]] southwards to [[Guérande]], leaving the towns of [[Loudéac]], [[Josselin]], and [[Malestroit]] in Upper Brittany. In 1886, [[Paul Sébillot]] noted that the boundary was deeper into what had been Breton territory, the line then running from [[Plouha]] on the north coast to [[Batz-sur-Mer]] in the south, on the [[Bay of Biscay]].

The boundary between 'Upper' and 'Lower' Brittany is now a purely imaginary line and has no administrative or other status. However, having been based on linguistic areas, the boundary does correspond very roughly to administrative borders. The town of [[Ploërmel]] is one point where the two meet.

In area, Upper Brittany now takes in something over half of the 35,000 square kilometres of the whole of Brittany, but it has some 2.5 million people, compared with Lower Brittany's 1.6 million. In the early 20th century, about 60% of the population had lived in the Breton-speaking areas.&lt;ref&gt;Helen Kelly-Holmes, Minority language broadcasting: Breton and Irish (2001), p.32 [https://books.google.com/books?id=5cI4wWJjTisC&amp;pg=PA32&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a '''list of the highest-grossing media franchises'''. This includes [[media franchise]]s that started as a [[book]], [[film]], [[video game]], [[comic book]] or [[Television program|television series]] and have expanded to other forms of [[Media (communication)|media]]. This list covers every aspect of a particular franchise, such as [[box office]], sales from [[merchandise]], [[home video|home entertainment]], and revenue from video games, among other things, if such information is available.

The list includes the total revenue figure and the revenue breakdown. For franchises where a total revenue figure is not known to have been reported, an estimate is given based on combined revenue from different media. For franchises where a reported figure is not up-to-date, an updated estimate is given based on available data.

'''Mansaf''' ({{lang-ar|&lt;big&gt;منسف&lt;/big&gt;}}) is a traditional [[Arab cuisine|Arab dish]] made of [[Lamb and mutton|lamb]] cooked in a sauce of fermented dried yogurt and served with [[rice]] or [[bulgur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kinghussein.gov.jo/facts3.html|work=kinghussein.gov.jo|publisher=kinghussein.gov.jo|accessdate=2016-04-19|date=2010-02-04|title=Jordanian cuisine}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

It is the [[national dish]] of [[Jordan]], and can also be found in [[State of Palestine|Palestine]], [[Iraq]], Southern [[Syria]] and [[Saudi Arabia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Alan Davidson|author2=Tom Jaine|title=The Oxford companion to food|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bmQjAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=23 July 2012|year=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-280681-9|page=424}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name of the dish comes from the term "large tray" or "large dish".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ghillie Basan|title=Middle Eastern Kitchen|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-7wnpIi3VRwC&amp;pg=PA70|accessdate=23 July 2012|date=30 September 2007|publisher=Hippocrene Books|isbn=978-0-7818-1190-3|pages=70–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The original pastoralist Bedouin mansaf underwent significant changes in the 20th century. The dish is said to originally have been made with simply meat (camel or lamb), meat broth or [[ghee]] (clarified butter) and bread.&lt;ref name="Massad1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Joseph Andoni Massad]]|title=Identifying the nation: the juridical and military bases of Jordanian national identity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hsQwAQAAIAAJ|year=1998|publisher=Columbia University|page=233}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the popularization of rice in northern Jordan in the 1920s, rice gradually was introduced into the dish, at first mixed with bulgur, and later on its own, until the dish reached its modern incarnation of being based on white rice. Similarly, the jamid sauce is a recent development, as the Bedouins did not historically feature jamid in their cooked dishes until their modern sedentarization.&lt;ref name="Massad1"/&gt;

==Preparation==
===Jameed===
[[File:Jameed.JPG|thumb|right|[[Al-Karak]] in Jordan is known to produce the highest quality of jameed.]]
{{See also|Jameed}}

[[Jameed]] is a hard dry [[yogurt]] that is prepared by the boiling of sheep or [[goat's milk]], which is then left to dry and ferment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zG1H75z0EYYC|title=Food Cultures of the World Encyclopedia [4 volumes]: [Four Volumes]|last=Albala|first=Ken|date=2011-05-25|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9780313376276|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mixture is later kept in a fine woven [[cheesecloth]] to make a thick [[yogurt]]. [[Salt]] is added daily to thicken the yogurt even more for a few days, which then becomes very dense and is shaped into round balls. The city of [[Al-Karak]] in Jordan has a reputation for producing the highest quality of jameed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sonia Uvezian|title=Recipes and remembrances from an Eastern Mediterranean kitchen: a culinary journey through Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E2sgAQAAMAAJ|accessdate=23 July 2012|year=2001|publisher=Siamanto Press|isbn=978-0-9709716-8-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cooking===
A jameed broth is prepared and the pieces of lamb are cooked in it. The dish is served on a large platter with a layer of [[flatbread]] ([[Markook shrek|markook]] or shrak) topped with rice and then meat, garnished with [[almonds]] and [[pine nuts]], and then the creamy jameed sauce is poured on top of the dish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://addustour.com/15373/%C2%AB%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AC%D9%85%D9%8A%D8%AF+%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%83%D8%B1%D9%83%D9%8A%C2%BB+..+%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AE%D9%84%D8%B7%D8%A9+%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%A9+%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%AA%D8%B4%D8%A7%D8%B1+%D8%B4%D9%87%D8%B1%D8%A9+%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%86%D8%B3%D9%81+%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D8%B1%D8%AF%D9%86%D9%8A.html|language=Arabic|accessdate=2016-04-19|date=2009-04-28|publisher=Ad Dustour|work=Ad Dustour|title=«الجميد الكركي» .. الخلطة السرية لانتشار شهرة المنسف الأردني}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture and tradition==
[[File:Préparation du mansaf-Jordanie (6).jpg|right|thumb|Woman in Petra preparing mansaf with lamb and chicken]]

Mansaf is associated with a traditional Jordanian culture based on an agro-pastoral lifestyle in which meat and yogurt are readily available. Mansaf is served on special occasions such as weddings, births and graduations, or to honor a guest, and on major holidays such as [[Eid ul-Fitr]], [[Eid ul-Adha]], [[Christmas]], [[Easter]] and Jordan's Independence Day. It is traditionally eaten collectively from a large platter in the [[Bedouin]] and rural style, standing around the platter with the left hand behind the back and using the right hand instead of utensils.&lt;ref&gt;''The cultural history of Jordan during the Mamluk period 1250–1517'', [[Yousef Ghawanmeh]] &lt;/ref&gt;

Since mansaf was originally popular among Bedouins, much of the traditions that they used with the dish still exist today. The tray containing mansaf is placed on a table where people gather around it while standing. Mansaf should be eaten with the use of a person's right hand only while the left is behind the person's back. The hand is used to create balls of rice and then the ball is placed in the mouth through the use of three fingers. It is frowned upon to blow on the ball of rice, no matter how hot. Many of these traditions are still used; however, it can also be eaten with spoons and plates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.alaraby.co.uk/miscellaneous/2016/2/13/%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%86%D8%B3%D9%81-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D8%B1%D8%AF%D9%86%D9%8A-%D8%AD%D8%A7%D8%B6%D8%B1-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D8%B9%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%B3-%D9%88%D8%B3%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%AF%D9%82-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%B2%D8%A7%D8%A1|title=المنسف الأردني.. حاضر في الأعراس وسرادق العزاء|accessdate=2016-04-19|date=2016-02-13|publisher=Al Araby|work=Al Araby|language=Arabic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jordan's national dish===
Though mansaf is frequently referred to as Jordan's "national dish", Massad states that mansaf is not a truly "traditional" dish, but is rather a more recent dish which was developed during the [[Mandatory Palestine|Hashemite-Mandatory]] era of the early 20th century, and then promulgated as a "national" dish following [[Independence of Jordan|independence]]. Massad notes that the current form of mansaf differs from the independence-era and Mandate-era recipes, but is portrayed by the state as a dish that is both national and a Bedouin tradition,&lt;ref name="Massad1"&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph Andoni Massad |title=Colonial Effects: The Making of National Identity in Jordan |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZiZFx42ZylAC&amp;pg=PA316 |accessdate=23 July 2012 |year=2001 |publisher=Columbia University Press |isbn=978-0-231-12323-5 |pages=316–}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite it also historically being a dish of the peasants and Bedouins of the neighboring regions of Palestine and Syria.&lt;ref name="Massad"&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph Massad|title=Identifying the nation: the juridical and military bases of Jordanian national identity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hsQwAQAAIAAJ| accessdate=23 July 2012|year=1998|publisher=Columbia University|page=233}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Heacock2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Roger Heacock|title=Temps et espaces en Palestine: flux et résistances identitaires|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F6UvAQAAIAAJ|year=2008|publisher=Institut français du Proche-Orient|isbn=978-2-35159-074-4|page=289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regions and variants==
[[File:Préparation du mansaf-Jordanie (8).jpg|thumb|right|A variant of mansaf topped with parsley]] 
The inhabitants of [[Al-Salt]] and [[Al-Karak]] are reputed to make the best mansaf in Jordan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sonia Uvezian|title=Recipes and remembrances from an Eastern Mediterranean kitchen: a culinary journey through Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E2sgAQAAMAAJ|accessdate=23 July 2012|year=2001|publisher=Siamanto Press|isbn=978-0-9709716-8-5|quote=The best mansafs are reputedly found in the towns of al-Salt and al-Karak.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other variants of the dish also exist and are adapted to the regional tastes and circumstances. These include fish mansaf, found in the south around the port city of [[Aqaba]]. An urban, less ceremonial adaptation of mansaf using non-dried yogurt is called ''shakreyyeh''. It is sometimes cooked with poultry instead of lamb and is common in the northern part of Jordan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.addustour.com/16335/%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%86%D8%B3%D9%81..%20%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%AF%20%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B7%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%85%20%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%B1%D8%A8%D9%8A.html|language=Arabic|title=المنسف.. سيد الطعام العربي|accessdate=2016-04-20|date=2011-12-16|work=Ad Dustour|publisher=Ad Dustour}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''medium of instruction''' (plural: usually '''mediums of instruction''', but the archaic '''media of instruction''' is still used by some) is a [[language]] used in teaching. It may or may not be the [[official language]] of the country or territory. If the [[first language]] of students is different from the official language, it may be used as the medium of instruction for part or all of schooling. [[Bilingual education|Bilingual or multilingual education]] may involve the use of more than one language of instruction. UNESCO considers that "providing education in a child's [[mother tongue]]  is indeed a critical issue".&lt;ref&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0015/001540/154007e.pdf Results of the 7th consultation of member states on the implementation of the Convention and Recommendation against discrimination in education. Para. 41]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In different countries and regions==

===Africa===
* In [[Tanzania]], [[Swahili language|Swahili]] is used in [[primary school]]s and adult education, whereas English is used in [[secondary school]]s and [[university|universities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tanzania.go.tz/learn_kiswahili.html |title=Kiswahili |accessdate=2001-04-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010417124135/http://www.tanzania.go.tz/learn_kiswahili.html |archivedate=April 17, 2001 |df= }} Tanzania National Website&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Zimbabwe]], use of English, Shona and Ndebele is established in education until the fourth grade; from the fourth grade, English is the medium of instruction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcp.org/zimbabwe.php?aid=519 5.1.9 Language laws] // Zimbabwe. International Database of Cultural Policies&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[South Africa]], students are taught primarily in their home language from Grade Zero (Reception Year) up to Grade 3. From Grade 4 onwards, [[English language|English]] is the default language of learning and teaching, except for a minority of schools in which [[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]] is used. The national curriculum requires that all students study at least two official languages as separate subjects, one of which must be studied at home language level and the other at least at first additional language level. The most common home language among the school population is [[isiZulu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.education.gov.za/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=LlfRGMZxPRg%3D&amp;tabid=422&amp;mid=1261 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120912013214/http://www.education.gov.za/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=LlfRGMZxPRg%3D&amp;tabid=422&amp;mid=1261 |archivedate=2012-09-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the francophone states of Africa, education has typically been in French only.
* In [[Ethiopia]], [[English language|English]] is the medium of instruction in secondary schools and universities

===Western Hemisphere===

====Brazil====
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}
Every public school uses [[Brazilian Portuguese]] as the medium of instruction, but no law prohibits the use of other languages in private schools. Many schools use other European languages (mainly because of the country's European heritage) such as English, German, Italian or French. Public schools also have mandatory English and Spanish but only once or twice a week.

====Canada====
{{further|Languages of Canada|Education in Canada|Official bilingualism in Canada|Language policies of Canada's provinces and territories}}
*In [[Canada]], almost all public schools use either English or French as the medium of instruction; French is standard in the province of [[Quebec]] (a few cities also offering English-language schools) and, along with English, in [[New Brunswick]]. The official language not used as the primary medium of instruction is taught as a mandatory subject in primary school and becomes optional for most secondary school students. Many [[state school|public]] and [[private school]] systems in English jurisdictions also offer [[French immersion]]. In parts of Canada such as the [[Northwest Territories]] and [[Nunavut]], some [[Languages of Canada#Aboriginal languages|aboriginal languages]], such as [[Inuinnaqtun]] and [[Tłı̨chǫ language|Tłı̨chǫ]], are also used in local school systems. [[Heritage language]]s ([[immigrant language|immigrant]] or [[diaspora language]]s) are as also common across Canada in public and private schools.

'''Michael Aubrey "Mike" Edwards''' (born Liverpool, England, 1957) is a writer and activist who has worked in various positions in foundations, think-tanks and international development institutions and who has written widely on [[civil society]], philanthropy and social transformation.  He has been a Distinguished Senior Fellow at [[Demos (U.S. think tank)|Demos]] in New York and has worked in senior management positions for [[Oxfam]] (as Regional Director for Southern Africa), [[Voluntary Service Overseas]] (as Head of Development Education), [[Save the Children]] (as Director of Research, Evaluation and Advocacy), the [[World Bank]] (as a Senior Civil Society Specialist) and the [[Ford Foundation]] (as director of its Governance and Civil Society Program). He also co-founded the Seasons Fund for Social Transformation&lt;ref&gt;''[https://web.archive.org/web/20140819211358/http://www.seasonsfund.org/ Seasons Fund for Social Transformation]'' ([[Internet Archive]])&lt;/ref&gt; which made grants to organizations that link their work for social justice with spiritual principles and contemplative practices before it closed in 2010. His writings examine the global role of civil society and its institutions, the purpose and impact of philanthropy and the not-for-profit sector, the role of business in solving social problems, and the links between personal and social transformation.&lt;ref&gt;[{{cite web |url=http://www.futurepositive.org/Edwards.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100204205655/http://www.futurepositive.org/Edwards.html |archivedate=2010-02-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bwpi.manchester.ac.uk/aboutus/staff/mikeedwards-profile.html Edwards' biography] at the [[Brooks World Poverty Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brettonwoodsproject.org/art-15650 "Changes at Bank NGO Unit"], [[The Bretton Woods Project]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==NGOs and civil society==

After completing his undergraduate education at Oxford University and his PhD in geography at University College London (UCL), Edwards left academia to join the NGO sector. He first came to prominence in the 1980s during his work with Oxfam when he criticized the “Irrelevance of Development Studies” in an article that sparked many years of debate about the extractive nature of social science research, a theme that he has continued to pursue ever since.&lt;ref&gt;Third World Quarterly 1989; 11: 116-35&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s he and David Hulme from [[Manchester University]] turned their attention to [[non-governmental organization]]s (NGOs) and hosted a series of influential conferences on scaling-up their impact, strengthening their performance and accountability, assessing the costs and benefits of closer ties between NGOs, governments and international donor agencies, and exploring how NGOs could adapt to globalization and the increasing diversity of the “North” and the “South.” More recently he has been critical of trends in the NGO sector towards growth and bureaucracy, which he argues may dilute their commitment to radical social change. These views are summarized in a piece entitled "[https://www.opendemocracy.net/transformation/michael-edwards/what-s-to-be-done-with-oxfam What's to be done with Oxfam?]" which appeared on openDemocracy in 2016.

In the 2000s Edwards began to write about civil society more broadly than NGOs, and published an influential introductory text called “Civil Society” which was updated in 2009 and again in 2014 to take account of changing developments in the field.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Edwards: ''[http://futurepositive.org/civil-society-the-3rd-edition-is-out-at-last/ Civil Society – the 3rd edition is out at last!]'' June 3, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; By disaggregating the concept of civil society into theories of associational life, the good society and the public sphere and then analyzing the links that exist between them, Edwards’ work has helped to clarify the confusion that has surrounded these ideas. His conceptual framework has been used by many others including [http://www.carnegieuktrust.org.uk/carnegieuktrust/wp-content/uploads/sites/64/2016/02/pub1455011711.pdf The Carnegie Inquiry into the Future of Civil Society in the UK and Ireland] and the [http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780195398571.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780195398571 Oxford Handbook of Civil Society] that was published in 2011.

==Philanthropy and the role of business in society== 

In 1997 Edwards left the NGO sector to join the World Bank, and then moved to the [https://www.fordfound.org/ Ford Foundation] in 1999 where for nine years he directed the Governance and Civil Society Program. Just before leaving the Foundation in 2008 he wrote a controversial pamphlet for Demos and the Young Foundation called “Just Another Emperor: The Myths and Realities of Philanthrocapitalism,” which challenged the trend to introduce business thinking into philanthropy and the not-for-profit sector, later expanded into a book called ''Small Change: Why Business Won’t Save the World''. Since then Edwards has continued to oppose this trend in his writing, arguing that "business should become more like civil society, not the other way around."&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, M. (2010) Small Change: Why business won't save the world. San Francisco: Berrett-Koehler.&lt;/ref&gt;

Edwards has also pushed back against closer ties between philanthropic foundations and the corporate sector, arguing that they need to be separate in order for foundations to retain their independence.

==Personal change and social transformation==

The final theme in Edwards’ work is the need to connect personal with social transformation, taking up ideas that were developed by [[Gandhi]] in India (“we must be the change we want to see in the world”) and by [[Martin Luther King]] and the [[Civil Rights Movement]] ("building the beloved community” through “the love that does justice”). Writing with colleagues such as Gita Sen&lt;ref&gt;Michael Edwards &amp; Gita Sen ''NGOs, Social Change and the Transformation of Human Relationships: A 21st-Century Civic Agenda.'' [[Third World Quarterly]], Vol. 21, No. 4, NGO Futures: Beyond Aid (Aug., 2000), pp. 605-616 ([http://www.futurepositive.org/docs/social.pdf PDF])&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Stephen G. Post]], Edwards is a member of an emerging movement for social and spiritual change called “spiritual activism.”  

In recognition of this work, Edwards received the [[Gandhi, King, Ikeda Award]] from [[Morehouse College]] in 2011 at a ceremony held at the [[Coady International Institute]] in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.coady.stfx.ca/coady/media/111003/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 Edwards launched a new section of the web-magazine [[openDemocracy]] called "Transformation" "to tell the stories of those who are exploring boundary-breaking solutions in politics, economics and social activism by bringing personal and social change together into one integrated process."&lt;ref&gt;openDemocracy: ''[http://www.opendemocracy.net/transformation Transformation]&lt;/ref&gt; He introduced this project in an article that explores the relationships between love and social justice in the modern world,&lt;ref&gt;Michael Edwards: ''[http://www.opendemocracy.net/transformation/michael-edwards/welcome-to-transformation-0 Welcome to Transformation].''

'''Museum Night''' ({{lang-hr|Noć muzeja}}) is an annual event in [[Croatia]]. During one night in the year (usually on the last Friday in January), the entrance fee to most of the [[museums in Croatia]] is waived. Museum Night was first held in December 2005, with only six museums from [[Zagreb]] area participating, drawing 10,000 visitors. The event evolved to include museums in the rest of Croatia in the following years, with over 200 museums participating. In 2014, there were 360,000 museum-goers during the Museum Night, with 800 performances held.&lt;ref name="index 2014 museum night"&gt;{{cite web|title=Započela "Noć muzeja": Više od 800 različitih programa u stotinjak hrvatskih gradova|url=http://www.index.hr/black/clanak/zapocela-noc-muzeja-vise-od-800-razlicitih-programa-u-stotinjak-hrvatskih-gradova/725041.aspx|website=[[Index.hr]]|accessdate=6 August 2015|date=31 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="museum night about us"&gt;{{cite web|title=O nama|url=http://nocmuzeja.hr/o-nama/|publisher=Noć muzeja (Museum Night)|accessdate=6 August 2015|language=hr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16716">'''Only Unity Saves the Serb''' ({{lang-sr|само слога Србина спасава}}/''samo sloga Srbina spasava'') is a popular motto and [[slogan]] in [[Serbia]] and among [[Serbs]], often used as a rallying call against foreign domination and during times of national crisis. The phrase is an interpretation of what is taken to be four [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] letters for "[[S]]" (written С) on the '''[[Serbian cross]]''', itself originally a [[Byzantine heraldry|Byzantine symbol]]. Popular tradition attributes the motto to [[Saint Sava]], the founder of the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]].

==Origin==
 [[File:Byzantine imperial flag, 14th century, square.svg|200px|thumb|right|The "tetragrammatic cross", emblem of the [[Palaiologos]] dynasty from the mid-13th century]]

===Serbian cross===
 {{main article|Serbian cross}}
The Serbian cross is based on the [[Palaiologos dynasty|Palaiologos]] symbol, a cross with four β for the motto "King of Kings, Ruling Over Kings" (''Basileus Basileōn, Basileuōn Basileuontōn'').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Meyer|2006|p=203}}, {{harvnb|Atlagić|1997|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Middle Ages, both the "Greek style", with closed fire-steels (β - [[B]]), and the "Serbian syle", with open fire-steels (C - [[S]]), were used in Serbia.{{sfn|Atlagić|1997|p=3}} It has been argued that the Serbian cross was used as a national symbol already in the 14th century.{{sfn|Atlagić|1997|pp=4–5}} The symbol was used in the [[Illyrian Armorials]] for Serbia. The Serbian cross reappeared during the [[First Serbian Uprising]] against the [[Ottoman Empire]], from 1804 to 1813, and has since been used in state insignia. It served as a reference to the medieval Serbian Empire and professed the part which Serbs played in defending Christendom against the Ottoman Empire in the 14th century.{{sfn|Meyer|2006|p=204}}

===Legend===
According to legend, the origin of the C-shaped [[Serbian cross]] lies with [[Saint Sava]], the first Archbishop of the [[Autocephaly|autocephalous]] Serbian Church and the [[patron saint]] of [[Serbs]], who based his design on the Byzantine original.{{sfn|Falina|2013|p=243}} The phrase "Only Unity Saves the Serbs" is traditionally attributed to him. He is said to have uttered it to urge the Serbian people to declare national autonomy and resist domination by the [[Roman Catholic Church]].{{sfn|Merrill|2001|p=161}}

The motto represents the "idea of betrayal", one of the main themes in the [[Kosovo Myth]] – the antithesis of [[Miloš Obilić]]'s heroism embodied in the figure of [[Vuk Branković]], which legend holds fled the battlefield, the moral of the story being that discord and betrayal among the Serbs had doomed the nation to fall. The slogan became a catch phrase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Šuber|first=Daniel|title=Myth, collective trauma and war in Serbia: a cultural-hermeneutical appraisal|year=2006|journal=Anthropology Matters|volume=8|issue=1|url=http://anthropologymatters.com/index.php/anth_matters/article/view/74/144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use==
===Origin and early use===
 [[File:Montenegrin cap.jpg|thumb|100px|The four C acronym on the [[Montenegrin cap]].]]
The popular interpretation of the four "C" as 'Само Слога Србина Спасава' on the Serbian coat of arms dates to the 19th century, created due to nationalistic and political reasons. [[Jovan Sterija Popović]] in his dramatic historical allegory ''San Kraljevića Marka'' (1847) was the first to state that the firesteels were four "C" letters to be read that way, which "pious patriotic souls have already took for sure" as said by Đorđe Petrović in the ''Srbadija'' magazine for 1881.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=SANU|title=Posebna izdanja|volume=295|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IA_0ouM0CKYC|publisher=SANU|year=1957|p=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Author Biljana Vankovska argues that the first interpretation of the acronym CCCC was "Serbia Alone Saved Herself" (''Sama Srbija sebe spasila''), which then changed to "Only Unity Saves the Serbs" (''Samo sloga Srbe spasava''), reflecting the growing Serb fear of internal enemies.{{when|date=November 2016}}{{sfn|Vankovska|2000|pp=6–7}}{{sfn|MacDonald|2002|pp=70–71}} In the poem ''Jeka od gusala'' ("echoes of [[gusle]]s", 1860), general and writer Jovan Dragašević (1836–1915) wrote "Only concord saves the Serb, so it is written for the Serb on the coat of arms" (Само Слога Србина Спасава, тако Србу пише и на грбу).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Radojčić|first=Stevan|title="Кронографија" Јована Драгашевића|year=2016|editor=Dimitrijević, M.

Štampar|pages=105–106}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same phrase as earlier used by Dragašević was used in the poem ''Smrt svetog Save'' ("Death of St. Sava", 1882) by [[Milorad Šimić]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Šimić|first=Milorad|year=1882|title=Смрт светог Саве|editor=Ognjanović, I.|journal=Јавор|location=Novi Sad|url=https://archive.org/stream/javor03unkngoog#page/n15/mode/2up|pp=9–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase is found in written on towels and engraved on ''[[gusle]]'' dating to the 1880s and 1890s.&lt;ref name="Вјера"&gt;{{cite book|author=Медић Вјера|title=Писмо и традиција: натписи на етнографским предметима|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mWiODgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA28|publisher=Etnografski muzej u Beogradu|pages=28–|id=GGKEY:S5LX19GAHTW}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Narodni muzički instrumenti|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7i44AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA88|year=1987|publisher=Etnografski muzej|pages=88–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allegedly, the motto ''Samo sloga Srbina spasava'' was acronymed on the [[Montenegrin cap]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barjaktarović|first=Mirko|title=Порекло и време настајања "црногорске" ношње|editor=Zečević, S.|journal=Гласник Етнографског музеја у Београду|volume=43|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7YR2BgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA133|publisher=Etnografski muzej u Beogradu|pages=133–|id=GGKEY:3EJL1KKYG38}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used, acronymed, in [[Egg decorating in Slavic culture|Easter egg decorating]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bulletin du Musée ethnographique de Beograd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FWYNAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA62|year=1956|publisher=Muzej|p=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase was used in songs of the Serbian [[Sokol]] movement.&lt;ref name="Rašić1930"&gt;{{cite book|author=Vojislav V. Rašić|title=Sokolijada: zbirka sokolskih pesama za deklamovanje radi podizanja sokolskog viteškog duha|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l4o-wm9qzfAC|year=1930|publisher=Štampa "Gundulić"|pp=93, 136}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Vladan Đorđević]]'s ''Car Dušan: Mladi kralj'' (1919), in the introduction, it is said "Because only unity saves, not only the Serb, but the Croat and Slovene, Orthodox, Catholics and Muslims".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Car Dušan: Mladi kralj|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ra4Dmaep1DwC|year=1919|publisher=Naklada Hrvatskog štamparskog zavoda|p=xx|quote=&lt;!--Јер само слога спасава, не само Србина, него Хрвата и Словенца, православне, католике и муслимане. Опростимо све једни другима, предајмо забораву ту ружну прошлост, јер смо иста кост и иста крв.--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary===
During World War II, the Main Staff of [[Chetnik]] Detachments in Bosnia and Herzegovina used it as an appeal in their struggle.&lt;ref name="Stanišić2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mihailo Stanišić|title=Projekti "Velika Srbija"|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nVYtAQAAIAAJ|year=2000|publisher=Službeni list SRJ|p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The acronym began appearing in Serbian nationalist [[graffiti]] during the 1980s.{{sfn|Sell|2002|p=73}} In 1989, Serbian President [[Slobodan Milošević]] delivered his infamous [[Gazimestan speech]] before a large, stone Orthodox cross bearing the acronym.{{sfn|Sells|1998|pp=86–87}} In the early 1990s, as [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] began to [[Breakup of Yugoslavia|disintegrate]], Milošević's propaganda apparatus adopted the phrase "Only Unity Saves the Serbs".{{sfn|Sell|2002|p=73}} The acronym form of the phrase was featured with the Serbian cross on the insignia of the [[Army of the Republic of Serb Krajina]] during the [[Croatian War]] and on the insignia of the [[Army of Republika Srpska]] during the [[Bosnian War]].{{sfn|Meyer|2006|p=204}} The Serbian cross with the CCCC acronym was also used as a wing and fuselage marking on aircraft used by the [[Republika Srpska Air Force]].{{sfn|Elliott|Cochrane|1998|p=20}} The phrase was often scrawled on the walls of abandoned houses in towns captured by Serb forces, usually followed alongside the acronym JNA (for [[Yugoslav People's Army]]) and the names of individual soldiers.{{sfn|Rieff|1996|p=97}} In the immediate aftermath of the [[Yugoslav Wars]], license plates throughout the Republika Srpska featured the acronym. These were replaced several years later, following the introduction of nationwide license plates.{{sfn|Oliver|2005|p=154}}

Serbian singer-songwriter [[Bora Đorđević]] adapted the motto as the title to his song ''Samo sloga Srbina spasava'', written during the 1999 [[NATO bombing of Yugoslavia]].{{sfn|Vidić–Rasmussen|2007|p=65}}

In 2010, on the anniversary of the [[Battle of Loznica]], [[Irinej, Serbian Patriarch|Patriarch Irinej]] said that only unity could save the Serb people, and [[wiktionary:nonunity|nonunity]] could ruin it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Irinej: Samo sloga Srbina spasava|publisher=Vesti online|url=http://www.vesti-online.com/Vesti/Srbija/87303/Irinej-Samo-sloga-Srbina-spasava}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Slovenian politician and [[European Parliament|EP]] member [[Jelko Kacin]] congratulated that [[Kosovo Serb]] representatives had united despite political differences, in a delegation to the EP, with the words "Bravo, Serbs, only unity saves the Serbs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Кацин: Само слога Србе спашава|publisher=RTV|url=http://rtv.rs/sr_ci/politika/kacin-samo-sloga-srbe-spasava_380795.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An international conference of Serbian Orthodox youth with the name has been held in 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Međunarodna konferencija srpske pravoslavne omladine u I.Sarajevu|publisher=RTRS|url=http://lat.rtrs.rs/vijesti/vijest.php?id=145839}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2016&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Konferencija "Samo sloga Srbina spašava"|publisher=Pale info|url=http://www.paleinfo.com/konferencija-samo-sloga-srbina-spasava/}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Republika Srpska]].

[[File:Pompon.jpg|thumb|right|A pair of [[cheerleading]] pom-poms]]
A '''pom-pom''' &amp;ndash; also spelled '''pom-pon''', '''pompom''' or '''pompon''' &amp;ndash; is a decorative ball or tuft of fibrous material.

The term may refer to large tufts used by [[Cheerleading|cheerleaders]], or a small, tighter ball attached to the top of a hat, also known as a [[Knit cap#British bobble hat|bobble]] or [[Pom-pon#Toorie|toorie]].

Pom-poms may come in many colors, sizes, and varieties and are made from a wide array of materials, including [[wool]], [[cotton]], [[paper]], [[plastic]], [[thread (yarn)|thread]], [[glitter]] and occasionally [[feather]]s. Pom-poms are shaken by [[Cheerleader|cheerleaders]], pom or [[dance|dance teams]], and sports fans during [[spectator sport]]s.

==Spelling and etymology==
*''[[Webster's Third New International Dictionary]]'' (1961) gives the spelling as "pompon."
*The ''[[New Oxford American Dictionary]]'' (third edition, 2010) gives the spelling as "pom-pom."
*The ''[[American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]]'' (5th edition, 2011) gives the spelling as "pompom" or "pompon."
*''Webster's New World College Dictionary'' (fourth edition) gives the spelling as "pompom."

''Pom-pom'' is derived from the French word ''pompon'', which refers to a small decorative ball made of fabric or feathers. It also means an "ornamental round tuft" and originally refers to its use on a hat, or an "ornamental tuft; tuft-like flower head."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=pompom&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sports and cheerleading==
[[File:YouthCheerleadingPompons.jpg|thumb|right|Cheerleaders using pom-poms during an [[American football]] [[halftime show]]]]

Cheerleaders use pom-poms at sports events for six reasons:

*to attract the attention of the spectators
*to accentuate movements
*to add "sparkle" to a cheer, chant, or dance routine
*to distract the opposing team
*to spell out team's name or "go" 
*to use semaphore

Most often, pom-poms are used in pairs (one in each hand), but this may vary with the particular requirements of the [[choreography]] of a dance or cheer.

Cheerleading pom-poms come in a variety of shapes, styles, colors, color combinations, and sizes. Shiny metallic pom-poms have become very popular in recent years.

[[File:Sports-Fest1.jpg|thumb|right|A group performance using pom-poms]]

Pom-poms are also waved by sports fans, primarily at college and high school sports events in the United States, Cheap, light-weight ''faux'' pom-poms in team colors are sometimes given or sold to spectators at such events.

Many schools and universities have dance teams in addition to their cheerleading groups. The dance teams may also use pom-poms occasionally, but many high school dance teams are now referred to as "Poms" squads. These squads are similar to drill teams, but usually have several routines that they strictly use pom-poms. Pom-poms have also come to be included in dance competitions in the United States. In many states, "Pom" or "Open Pom" is considered its own style of dance during competitions. For this style dancers use pom-poms and moves that are specifically choreographed to include pom-poms, but usually incorporate hip-hop and jazz choreography as well. When judging a routine in the Pom or Open Pom category, judges typically look for clean, sharp movements and complete synchronization of the team. These dances occasionally use different colored pom-poms and outfits to convey a theme and the dance team will create pictures from their pom-poms that relate to this theme.

==Clothing==
[[File:Shako-p1000580.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Shako]] dating from the [[Bourbon Restoration]] with a red company pompon]]
Small pom-poms may be used to adorn [[hat]]s (such as [[Tam o' Shanter (cap)|Tam o' Shanters]] and some styles of the [[tuque]]), [[sock]]s, fringed [[dress]]es, and other kinds of clothing.

Pom-poms form a conspicuous part of the uniform of French naval personnel, being sewn onto the crown of their round [[cap]]. Belgian sailors wear a light blue version.

Traditional Italian wedding shoes have small pom-poms, as do some Turkish dancing shoes.

===Roman Catholic clergy===

[[Roman Catholic clergy]] wear the [[biretta]]. The colour of its pom-pom denotes the wearer's rank. Priests wear a black biretta with a black pom. Protonotaries and domestic prelates (now prelates of honour) have a scarlet pom on their black birettas, and Papal Chamberlains (now Chaplains to His Holiness) wear a Roman purple pom on their black birettas.

Bishops and archbishops wear a Roman purple biretta with matching pom. The scarlet birettas of the cardinals have no pom, only a red loop. There is no papal biretta.

Some religious orders and congregations have unique birettas, such as the Norbertines who wear a white biretta with a white pom. Some St. Francis fathers wear a  brown biretta with a black pom. Other orders may wear a black biretta with a white, green, or blue pom, or the black biretta of the secular priesthood.

[[File:Balmoral bonnet black.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Balmoral bonnet]] with a red toorie]]

===Toorie===&lt;!--This section name is linked from [[Glengarry]], [[Balmoral bonnet]] and [[Tam o' Shanter]].--&gt;

In reference to [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[Highland dress]] and Scottish military uniforms, the small pom-pom on the crown of such hats as the [[Balmoral bonnet|Balmoral]], the [[Glengarry]], and the [[Tam o' Shanter (cap)|Tam o' Shanter]] is called a "toorie."

The toorie is generally made of yarn and is traditionally red on both Balmorals and Glengarries (although specific units have used other colours). It has evolved into the smaller pom-pom found on older-style [[Flat cap|golf caps]] and the button atop [[baseball cap]]s.

Scots refer to any such hat decoration as a toorie, irrespective of the headgear.

==Flogger==
[[File:Richmond Cheer Squad Rd 21 2006 closeup.jpg|thumb|Fans at Australian rules football matches wave floggers behind the goals to signify that a goal was scored.]]

In [[Australia]], the term "flogger" is sometimes used rather than "pom-pom". Floggers are very large, heavy pom-poms in the team's colours. They sometimes require more than one person to lift them, and they are waved about when a goal is scored.

Floggers are an important part of [[Australian rules football culture]] and cheer-squads.

==Toys and bicycles==
[[File:Pom poms multiple colours.jpg|thumb|Pile of pom-poms used for children's crafts.]]
Pom-poms are sometimes used as children's toys. They are a common feature at the ends of the handlebars of children's [[tricycle]]s and [[bicycle]]s. They are also used in children's artistic crafts to add texture and color.

'''Project 211''' ({{zh|c=211工程|p=211 gōngchéng}}) is a project of [[National Key Universities]] and [[higher education in China|colleges]] initiated in 1995 by the [[Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China]], with the intent of raising the research standards of high-level universities and cultivating strategies for [[socio-economic development]]. During the first phase of the project, from 1996 to 2000, approximately [[US$]]2.2 billion was distributed.&lt;ref name="aper1"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Li Lixu| title=China’s Higher Education Reform 1998-2003: A Summary| journal=Asia Pacific Education Review| year=2004| volume=V| issue=1| url=http://eri.snu.ac.kr/aper/pdf/Vol%205%20No%201%20July%202004%20PDF/02.Li%20Lixu.pdf| pages=14–22| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100623215250/http://eri.snu.ac.kr/aper/pdf/Vol%205%20No%201%20July%202004%20PDF/02.Li%20Lixu.pdf| archivedate=2010-06-23| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

China today has 116 institutions of higher education (about 6 percent) designated as 211 Project institutions for having met certain scientific, technical, and [[human resources]] standards and offer advanced degree programs). Project 211 schools take on the responsibility of training four-fifths of doctoral students, two-thirds of graduate students, half of students from abroad and one-third of undergraduates. They offer 85% of the state's key subjects, hold 96 percent of the state's key laboratories, and consume 70% of scientific research funding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.people.com.cn/90001/6381319.html Over 10 billion yuan to be invested in "211 Project" - People's Daily Online&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080428031138/http://english.people.com.cn/90001/6381319.html |date=2008-04-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name for the project comes from an abbreviation of the slogan "面向'''21'''世纪，办好'''1'''00所高校 (For the '''21'''st century, to manage '''1'''00 universities successfully)". 100 was approximate number of participating universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.moe.edu.cn/publicfiles/business/htmlfiles/moe/moe_1985/200804/9084.html|title="211工程"大事记|last=|first=|date=|website=Ministry of Education, PRC|language=Chinese|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161122070739/http://www.moe.edu.cn/publicfiles/business/htmlfiles/moe/moe_1985/200804/9084.html|archive-date=2016-11-22|dead-url=no|access-date=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2014, Project 211 was less mentioned and gradually succeeded by a new project called [[plan 111]] (Program of Introducing Talents of Discipline to Universities).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.sina.com.cn/c/2014-11-14/133531144878.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-09-09 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170909191001/http://news.sina.com.cn/c/2014-11-14/133531144878.shtml |archivedate=2017-09-09 |df= }} 南京有高校称“211建设”已暂停&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cisile.com.cn/cnt_117.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-09-09 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170909190926/http://www.cisile.com.cn/cnt_117.html |archivedate=2017-09-09 |df= }} 985、211取消后 仅88所高校入选“111计划”（名单）&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2017, a related plan called the [[Double First Class University Plan]] was announced.&lt;ref name="people.cn"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://en.people.cn/n3/2017/0921/c90000-9272101.html |title=China to develop 42 world-class universities | work=People's Daily |date= 21 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="China Daily"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/opinion/2017-09/25/content_32446664.htm |title=双一流大学 (shuāngyīliú dàxué): Double top university plan |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170925043627/http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/opinion/2017-09/25/content_32446664.htm |archivedate=2017-09-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was unclear whether this plan represents a new way of ranking universities in China,&lt;ref name="people.cn"/&gt; or replaces Project 211 and [[Project 985]]&lt;ref name="China Daily" /&gt;

The '''Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs''' is an [[international organization]] that brings together scholars and public figures to work toward reducing the danger of [[armed conflict]] and to seek solutions to [[global security]] threats. It was founded in 1957 by [[Joseph Rotblat]] and [[Bertrand Russell]] in [[Pugwash, Nova Scotia]], Canada, following the release of the [[Russell–Einstein Manifesto]] in 1955.

Rotblat and the Pugwash Conference jointly won the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1995 for their efforts on [[nuclear disarmament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
  |title=The Nobel Peace Prize 1995

  |publisher=[[Nobel Prize]]
}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note" &gt;Russell's exclusion is explained because the Nobel Prizes are never awarded posthumously.&lt;/ref&gt; [[International Student/Young Pugwash]] groups have existed since founder [[Cyrus Eaton]]'s death in 1979.

==Origin of the Pugwash Conferences==
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2011}}
The Russell–Einstein Manifesto, released July 9, 1955, called for a conference for scientists to assess the dangers of [[weapons of mass destruction]] (then only considered to be [[nuclear weapons]]). [[Cyrus Eaton]], an industrialist and philanthropist, offered on July 13 to finance and host the conference in the town of his birth, [[Pugwash, Nova Scotia]]. This was not taken up at the time because a meeting was planned for India, at the invitation of Prime Minister [[Jawaharlal Nehru]]. With the outbreak of the [[Suez Crisis]] the Indian conference was postponed. [[Aristotle Onassis]] offered to finance a meeting in [[Monaco]] instead, but this was rejected. Eaton's former invitation was taken up.

The first conference was held at what became known as Thinkers' Lodge&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thinkerslodge.org/ Thinkers' Lodge.org]&lt;/ref&gt; in July 1957 in Pugwash, Nova Scotia. Twenty-two scientists attended the first conference:
* seven from the United States ([[David F. Cavers]], [[Paul M. Doty]], [[Hermann J. Muller]], [[Eugene Rabinowitch]], [[Walter Selove]], [[Leó Szilárd]], [[Victor Frederick Weisskopf|Victor F. Weisskopf]])
* three from the [[Soviet Union]] (Alexander M. Kuzin ([[:ru:Кузин, Александр Михайлович|Александр М. Кузин]]), [[Dmitri Skobeltsyn|Dmitri V. Skobeltsyn]], Alexander V. Topchiev ([[:ru:Топчиев, Александр Васильевич|Александр В. Топчиев]]))
* three from Japan ([[Iwao Ogawa]], [[Shinichiro Tomonaga]], [[Hideki Yukawa]])
* two from the [[United Kingdom|UK]] ([[Cecil Frank Powell|Cecil F. Powell]], [[Joseph Rotblat]])
* two from Canada ([[Brock Chisholm]], [[John S. Foster]])
* one each from Australia ([[Mark Oliphant|Mark L. E. Oliphant]]), Austria ([[Hans Thirring]]), China ([[Zhou Peiyuan|Zhou Pei-Yuan]]), France ([[Antoine M. B. Lacassagne]]) and [[Poland]] ([[Marian Danysz]]).
Cyrus Eaton, [[Eric Burhop]], Ruth Adams, Anne Kinder Jones, and Vladimir Pavlichenko also were present. Many others were unable to attend, including co-founder [[Bertrand Russell]], for health reasons.

Pugwash's "main objective is the elimination of all weapons of mass destruction (nuclear, chemical and biological) and of war as a social institution to settle international disputes. To that extent, peaceful resolution of conflicts through dialogue and mutual understanding is an essential part of Pugwash activities, that is particularly relevant when and where nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction are deployed or could be used."&lt;ref name="Pugwash, Eleventh Quinquennium"&gt;{{Cite web

"The various Pugwash activities (general conferences, workshops, study groups, consultations and special projects) provide a channel of communication between scientists, scholars, and individuals experienced in government, diplomacy, and the military for in-depth discussion and analysis of the problems and opportunities at the intersection of science and world affairs.  To ensure a free and frank exchange of views, conducive to the emergence of original ideas and an effective communication between different or antagonistic governments, countries and groups, Pugwash meetings as a rule are held in private.  This is the main modus operandi of Pugwash.  In addition to influencing governments by the transmission of the results of these discussions and meetings, Pugwash also may seek to make an impact on the scientific community and on public opinion through the holding of special types of meetings and through its publications."&lt;ref name="Pugwash, Eleventh Quinquennium" /&gt;

Officers include the president and secretary-general. Formal governance is provided by the Pugwash Council, which serves for five years. There is also an executive committee that assists the secretary-general. [[Jayantha Dhanapala]] is the current president. Paolo Cotta-Ramusino is the current Secretary General.

The four Pugwash offices, in [[Rome]] (international secretariat), [[London]], [[Geneva]], and [[Washington D.C.]], provide support for Pugwash activities and serve as liaisons to the [[United Nations]] and other international organizations.

There are approximately fifty national Pugwash groups, organized as independent entities and often supported or administered by national academies of science.

The [[International Student/Young Pugwash]] groups works with, but are independent from, the international Pugwash group.

Ramsey|Norman Ramsey]], [[Francis Perrin]], [[Robert R. Wilson]]]]Pugwash's first fifteen years coincided with the [[Berlin Crisis of 1961|Berlin Crisis]], the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]], the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia]], and the [[Vietnam War]]. Pugwash played a useful role in opening communication channels during a time of otherwise-strained official and unofficial relations. It provided background work to the [[Partial Test Ban Treaty]] (1963), the [[Non-Proliferation Treaty]] (1968), the [[Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty]] (1972), the [[Biological Weapons Convention]] (1972), and the [[Chemical Weapons Convention]] (1993). Former [[US Secretary of Defense]] Robert McNamara has credited a backchannel Pugwash initiative (code named PENNSYLVANIA) with laying the groundwork for the negotiations that ended the Vietnam War.&lt;ref&gt;McNamara, "Conversations with History," interview with Harry Kreisler, http://conversations.berkeley.edu/content/robert-s-mcnamara {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120521225738/http://conversations.berkeley.edu/content/robert-s-mcnamara# |date=2012-05-21 }}.  See also Robert McNamara (et al), "Argument Without End: In Search of Answers to the Vietnam Tragedy," Public Affairs,1999, pp. 292–312.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] admitted the influence of the organisation on him when he was leader of the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name='wittner'&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.comeclean.org.uk/articles.php? articleID=47 |title=Better Active Today than Radioactive Tomorrow |last=von Hippel |first=Frank |work=FAS Public Interest Report |publisher=The Journal of the Federation of American Scientists.

During the [[Cold War]], it was claimed that the Pugwash Conference became a [[front organization|front conference]] for the Soviet Union, whose agents often managed to weaken Pugwash critique of USSR and instead concentrate on blaming the United States and the West.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Felix Staar, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Hvv7U15xCtMC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Foreign policies of the Soviet Union]'', Hoover Press, 1991, {{ISBN|0-8179-9102-6}}, p.86-87&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1980, the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence received a report that the Pugwash Conference was used by Soviet delegates to promote Soviet propaganda. Joseph Rotblat said in his 1998 Bertrand Russell Peace Lecture that there were a few participants in the conferences from the Soviet Union "who were obviously sent to push the party line, but the majority were genuine scientists and behaved as such".&lt;ref&gt;[http://digitalcommons.mcmaster.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1199&amp;context=russelljournal Rotblat, Joseph, "Russell and the Pugwash Movement", ''The 1998 Bertrand Russell Peace Lectures'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the end of the Cold War, the traditional Pugwash focus on decreasing the salience of nuclear weapons and promoting a world free of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction addresses the following issue areas:&lt;ref&gt;For recent meetings and topics, see www.pugwash.org&lt;/ref&gt;

*Nuclear stability, nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation: 1. Traditional Nuclear Disarmament, US-Russia nuclear disarmament, nuclear weapons in Europe; 2. Nuclear weapons and nuclear proliferation in the Middle East, Israeli nuclear weapons, Iranian nuclear program, proposal for a Middle Eastern zone free of weapons of mass destruction, Arab attitudes towards nuclear weapons and nuclear proliferation; 3. India and Pakistan nuclear relations, the effects of US India nuclear deal; 4. North Korea.
*Regional security in regions where nuclear weapons exist or risks of nuclear proliferation are significant:  1. Middle East—general issues, the impact of the Palestinian problem and its relevance in the Arab world, the consequences of the so-called Arab spring and the growth of the Islamic movements and parties, Arab-Iranian, Arab-Israeli and Iran-Israeli relations; 2. South-Central Asia—traditional antagonism between India and Pakistan, the role of terrorist attacks in the worsening of such antagonism, US-Pakistani relations in general. The role of radical movements in Pakistan, reconciliation and peace in Afghanistan, talking to the Taliban (is it possible and how should be done?), Pakistani-Afghan relations.

The Pugwash movement has also been concerned with environmental issues and as a result of its 1988 meeting in Dagomys it issued the Dagomys Declaration on Environmental Degradation (https://pugwash.org/1988/09/03/dagomys-declaration-of-the-pugwash-council/).

==Nobel Peace Prize==
In 1995, fifty years after the bombing of [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]] and [[Hiroshima]], and forty years after the signing of the Russell–Einstein Manifesto, the Pugwash Conferences and Joseph Rotblat were awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] jointly

{{quote|for their efforts to diminish the part played by nuclear arms in international politics and, in the longer run, to eliminate such arms.}}

The Norwegian Nobel committee hoped that awarding the prize to Rotblat and Pugwash would

{{quote|encourage world leaders to intensify their efforts to rid the world of nuclear weapons.}}

In his acceptance speech, Rotblat quoted a key phrase from the Manifesto:

{{quote|Remember your humanity.}}

==International Foundation for Science==
From the 1965 Pugwash conference came a recommendation to establish the International Foundation for Science "in order to address the stultifying conditions under which younger faculty members in the universities of developing countries were attempting to do research".&lt;ref name=IFS&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ifs.se/about-ifs/ |title=About IFS |publisher=International Foundation for Science |accessdate=7 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization gives grants to early-career scientists in low-income countries for work on local water resources and biology.&lt;ref name=IFS/&gt;

==Pugwash Presidents==
&lt;ref&gt;Pugwash Presidency Background Note, Pugwash Conferences, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Bertrand Russell|Earl (Bertrand) Russell]], 1950 Nobel Prize in Literature, a founder of the movement, was its natural head in its initial years. The formal office of the presidency was established at the Quinquennial Conference in Ronneby, in 1967. The president's role was to "preside over the Annual Pugwash Conferences and, in addition, between Conferences, to offer his counsel and advice to the members of the Continuing Committee and the Secretary-General, and thereby assist them in the execution of the activities of the Movement."
*[[John Cockcroft|Sir John Cockcroft]], joint recipient of the 1951 Nobel Prize in Physics for pioneering work on the transmutation of atomic nuclei by artificially accelerated atomic particles, was elected as the first president in 1967, though he died suddenly ten days later.
*[[Howard Florey|Lord Florey]], who shared the 1945 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for extraction of penicillin, was then invited to become president, though he also died within weeks. At that point the Continuing Committee decided to have a rotating presidency for a term of one year, to have that office held by a distinguished person in the country where the annual conference would be held each year.
*[[Francis Perrin]] (1968), had worked with Frederic Joliot's team to establish in 1939 the possibility of nuclear chain reactions and nuclear energy production.
*[http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Mikhail+Millionshchikov Mikhail Millionshchikov] (1969), an eminent physicist who later became Speaker of the Russian Parliament.
*[[Eugene Rabinowitch]] (1970), American biophysicist who worked on the Manhattan Project and was co-author with Leo Szilard of the Franck Report and co-founder in 1945 of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists. In September 1970, the Continuing Committee switched back to the initial idea of a permanent office of president, with a five-year term.
*[[Hannes Alfvén]] (1970–1975), recipient of the 1970 Nobel in Physics for work on his theory of magnetohydrodynamics.
*[[Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin]] (1976–1988), recipient of the 1964 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] for her determinations by X-ray techniques of the structures of important biochemical substances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-28801302 |title=Thatcher and Hodgkin: How chemistry overcame politics |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |first=Adam |last=Ganz |date=19 August 2014 |accessdate=19 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Sir Joseph Rotblat]] (1988–1997), physicist, one of the founders of the Pugwash Movement, co-recipient of the 1995 Nobel Peace Prize.
*[[Sir Michael Atiyah]] (1997–2002), a mathematician, was awarded the 1966 Fields Medal, for his work in developing K-theory.
*[[M. S. Swaminathan|Prof. M.S. Swaminathan]] (2002–2007), agricultural scientist, one of the pioneers of the Green Revolution and recipient of the World Food Prize and the UNESCO Gandhi Prize.

'''''Radical Society''': A Review of Culture and Politics'' was a quarterly [[left-wing]] political and cultural [[magazine]] published in the [[United States]] by Radical Society, Ltd. The [[editor-in-chief]] was Timothy Don. It was established in 1970 as ''Socialist Revolution'', was renamed as ''Socialist Review'' in 1978, and obtained its final title at the end of 2002.

== History ==
''Socialist Revolution'', under its founding editor [[James Weinstein (author)|James Weinstein]], began with a revolutionary perspective which was, however, very critical of the existing [[Marxist]] left (including the [[New Communist Movement]] as well as established organizations), which it saw as undemocratic both in its way of operating and in its political aspirations. In the 1970s and early 1980s, the magazine was strongly associated with the [[New American Movement]] and its politics in this period developed in a similar direction towards a more [[Social Democratic]] perspective. In the course of this development the magazine was renamed ''Socialist Review'' in 1978, meanwhile absorbing the short-lived ''Marxist Perspectives''. 

Among the magazine's editors have been Eli Zaretsky, David Plotke, Jeffrey Escoffier, Leslie Kauffman, and David Trend.

Because the magazine had been founded in San Francisco with an editorial collective that included many [[University of California at Berkeley]] graduate students, it showed an openness to theory that was not universally shared by magazines on the left in the 1970s. As some of the original collective graduated and got teaching jobs in the Boston area, a second editorial collective was founded in nearby [[Somerville, Massachusetts|Somerville]] (and later a short-lived New York collective also came into existence for similar reasons). As the members of the Boston collective began to get tenure, the nature of the two main editorial collectives began to diverge, with the Boston Collective attracting junior faculty, while the Bay Area collective continued well into the 1980s to be composed primarily of graduate students and community activists. The Boston Collective was notable for the quality of its economic analysis, while the West Coast Collective was active in producing articles out of the various [[identity politics|identity movements]] of the 1980s, always with an eye toward theory. During this period, a careful reader could tell exactly which collective was responsible for which articles in the magazine, but to most observers it meant that ''Socialist Review'' reflected the diversity of positions available on the left. 

''Socialist Review'' came to be strongly associated with [[postmodern]] [[critical theory]] and evolved into a magazine with a strong cultural element. In 1991, ''Unfinished Business: 20 Years of Socialist Review'', containing a collection of 20 articles was published. 

In 2002 the magazine's name was changed again, to ''Radical Society: A Review of Culture and Politics''. From 2002 to 2003 it was published by [[Routledge]]. {{As of|2006}}, an independent publisher, Radical Society Ltd., took over publishing and relaunched its website, making past issues available online. 

As of the end of 2006, the [[editor-in-chief]] of ''Radical Society'' was Timothy Don. The magazine has since ceased publication.

A substantial archive of Socialist Review's editorial correspondence, manuscripts, and records  was acquired by the Paley Library of [[Temple University]] in the 1990s. It is housed in the library's Contemporary Culture Collection.&lt;ref&gt;http://library.temple.edu/collections/scrc/socialist-review-records&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purpose and mission ==
In the first issue or ''Radical Society'', the editors wrote that the inspirations for the journal were "both old and new--from ''[[The Masses]]'' and [[Emma Goldman]]'s ''[[Mother Earth (magazine)|Mother Earth]]'' to the [[Harlem Renaissance]] and the [[Paris Commune]], from the end of the [[cold war]] to the beginnings of a new [[global justice movement]]".&lt;ref&gt;"From the Editor," ''Radical Society'', 29, 1, April 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3735">A '''running gag''', or '''running joke''', is a [[literary device]] that takes the form of an amusing [[joke]] or a [[comedy|comical]] reference and appears repeatedly throughout a work of [[literature]] or other form of [[storytelling]]. Though they are similar, [[catchphrase]]s are not considered running gags.&lt;ref name="byron" /&gt;&lt;ref name="beaver" /&gt;

Running gags can begin with an instance of [[unintentional humor]] that is repeated in variations as the joke grows familiar and [[audience]]s anticipate reappearances of the gag. The humor in a running gag may derive entirely from how often it is repeated, however the underlying statement or situation will always require some form of [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/jocularity jocularity]. Therefore, a statement which is merely trivial in nature will not turn into a running gag simply by being repeated over and over again. A running gag may also derive its humor from the (in)appropriateness of the situation in which the gag occurs, or setting up the audience to expect another occurrence of the joke and then substituting something else (''bait and switch''). Running gags are found mostly in [[Situation comedy|television shows]],&lt;ref name="morganrussell" /&gt; but also appear in other places, such as [[video game]]s, [[film]]s, [[book]]s, and [[comic strip]]s.

A running gag can be verbal or visual and may "convey social values by echoing belligerent speakers with a barrage of caricatured threats."&lt;ref name="Brunvand719"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brunvand|first=Jan Harold|authorlink=Jan Harold Brunvand|title=American Folklore : An Encyclopedia Garland Reference Library of the Humanities ; Vol. 1551|publisher=New York Garland, 1998 |isbn=978-0-8153-3350-0 |page= 719; 812}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a character may present others with a proposition that is so ridiculous or outrageous it is likely to be self-mocking to the point where the original request has little or no chance of actually being carried out and results in a humorous effect.&lt;ref name="Brunvand719"/&gt; Occasionally, the characters themselves may be aware of the running gag and make humorous mention of it.

'''Serge Lutens''' (born 14 March 1942 in [[Lille]], France) is a French photographer, filmmaker, [[hair stylist]], [[perfumer|perfume creator]] and fashion designer.

==Career==

At fourteen, Lutens was taken on as an apprentice by a hair salon in Lille, a period which he described as crucial to his appreciation of beauty in three dimensions.&lt;ref name="wm2"&gt;{{cite magazine |author=Norah Nona |date=January 2008 |title=Icon of Beauty – Serge Lutens |magazine=Wound |volume=1 |issue=2 |location=London |pages=159 |issn=1755-800X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lutens started to experiment with makeup and photography, using friends to pose as models.

In 1962 Lutens moved to Paris, where ''[[Vogue magazine|Vogue]]'' hired him to create makeup, hair and jewellery.
Throughout the 1960s he collaborated with photographers such as [[Richard Avedon]], [[Bob Richardson (photographer)|Bob Richardson]] and [[Irving Penn]].

In 1967 [[Christian Dior]] commissioned Lutens to create a makeup line.

in 1973, Serge Lutens' series of photographs (inspired by the artists [[Claude Monet]], [[Georges-Pierre Seurat]], [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Amedeo Modigliani]]) was shown at the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]] in New York.

In 1974 he made a short movie: "Les Stars" and "Suaire" in 1976. Both were shown at the [[Cannes Film Festival]].

Throughout the 1980s he shot various advertising campaigns and films and designed makeup and packaging. These works won him two 'Lions d’Or' at the [[Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival|International Advertising Film Festival]].

In 2000, Lutens launched his own brand "Parfums-Beaute Serge Lutens".

For four consecutive years, 2001 to 2004, Lutens was awarded the "[[FiFi Awards|Fifi Award]]" for Best Original Concept.

In 2014, Lutens unveiled Section d’or – a radical collection that sets no limits or price to artistry.

In 2015, Lutens presented his vision of Russian supremacy through the design of the new Serge Lutens boutique in Moscow.

Lutens currently lives in [[Marrakech]], Morocco.

'''Squidward Q. Tentacles''' is a fictional character voiced by actor [[Rodger Bumpass]] in the American [[animated series|animated television series]] ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]''. Squidward was created and designed by marine biologist and animator [[Stephen Hillenburg]]. He first appeared on television in the series' pilot episode "[[Help Wanted (SpongeBob SquarePants)|Help Wanted]]" on May 1, 1999.

Although his name has the word "squid" in it and he has six arms, Squidward is an [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] octopus.{{efn|name=Squidward is octopus}} He lives in a [[moai]] between [[SpongeBob SquarePants (character)|SpongeBob SquarePants]]' and [[Patrick Star]]'s houses. The character is portrayed as ill-tempered, manipulative, pretentious, cynical and incredibly hostile, and he strongly despises his neighbors for their constant annoying, noisy behavior. However, the pair are unaware of Squidward's antipathy towards them and see him as a friend. Squidward works as a cashier at the [[Krusty Krab]] restaurant, a job that he is apathetic towards.

The character's critical reception from professionals and fans has been positive. Squidward has appeared in many ''SpongeBob SquarePants'' publications, toys, and other merchandise. He appears in the 2004 full-length feature film ''[[The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie]]'' and [[The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water|its sequel]], which was released in 2015.

==Role in ''SpongeBob SquarePants''==
[[File:131 - Valparaiso - Moai - Janvier 2010.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Squidward lives in a [[moai]], like those of Easter Island.]]
Squidward is depicted as a bitter, very unfortunate, desperate, somewhat depressed, curt, arrogant, occasionally selfish, turquoise octopus. He lives in the underwater city of Bikini Bottom in a moai situated between SpongeBob SquarePants' pineapple house and Patrick Star's rock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Opposite Day|series=SpongeBob SquarePants|season=1|number=64b|network=Nickelodeon|airdate=September 11, 1999|credits=Writers: Chuck Klein, [[Jay Lender]], [[Mr. Lawrence]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Squidward detests his neighbors for their perpetual laughter and boisterous behavior, though SpongeBob and Patrick are oblivious to Squidward's animosity towards them and regard him as a friend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Good Neighbors|series=SpongeBob SquarePants|season=4|number=64b|network=Nickelodeon|airdate=May 20, 2005|credits=Writers: Mike Bell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Squidward lives in a constant state of self-pity and misery; he is unhappy with his [[wikt:humdrum|humdrum]] lifestyle and yearns for celebrity status, wealth, hair, and a glamorous and distinguished career as a musician or painter with a passion for art and playing the [[clarinet]].&lt;ref name="Tiki"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Enchanted Tiki Dreams|series=SpongeBob SquarePants|season=7|number=145b|network=Nickelodeon|airdate=June 19, 2010|credits=Writers: [[Aaron Springer]], Sean Charmatz, Richard Pursel}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he is left to endure the lowly status as a fast-food [[cashier]] at the [[Krusty Krab]] restaurant. Squidward resents his job and is irritated by his greedy employer [[Mr. Krabs]] and by having his own resented neighbor SpongeBob as a colleague.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Greasy Buffoons|series=SpongeBob SquarePants|season=7|number=130a|network=Nickelodeon|airdate=November 27, 2009|credits=Writers: [[Aaron Springer]], Derek Iversen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Squidward longs for peace but his wishes remain unsatisfied.&lt;ref name="Tiki"/&gt; He believes he is talented and deserves a higher social status, but despite having a love for music, Squidward has no talent for playing the clarinet.&lt;ref&gt;During two episodes, Snooze You Lose and Krusty Katering, it was revealed that Squidward puts no effort at playing the clarinet by the following:
* The Crowd, or judge, being disturbed by his awful clarinet sounds
* Whenever he plays at the orchestra, the members just walk away.   &lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==

===Creation and design===
[[Stephen Hillenburg]] first became fascinated with the ocean and began developing his artistic abilities as a child. During college, he majored in [[marine biology]] and minored in art. After graduating in 1984, he joined the [[Ocean Institute]], an ocean education organization, where he had the idea to create a comic book titled ''The Intertidal Zone'', which led to the creation of ''SpongeBob SquarePants''.&lt;ref name="Ocean Institute"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ocean-institute.org/|title=Welcome to the Ocean Institute|work=ocean-institute.org|accessdate=December 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HillenburgInt&gt;{{cite video |people=[[Thomas F.

[[File:Squidward.jpg|thumb|270px|Early rough sketches of Squidward from creator Stephen Hillenburg's series bible.]]
Several years after studying experimental animation at the [[California Institute of the Arts]],&lt;ref name="Banks, p. 9"/&gt; Hillenburg met [[Joe Murray (animator)|Joe Murray]], creator of ''[[Rocko's Modern Life]]'', at an animation festival.

Hillenburg used some character designs from his comic book. He designed "SpongeBob's grumpy next door neighbor" as an octopus because the species' large head; octopuses, he said, "have such a large bulbous head and Squidward thinks he's an intellectual so of course, he's gonna have a large bulbous head."&lt;ref name="Case"&gt;Hillenburg, Stephen. (March 1, 2005). ''The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie'' (''The Case of the Sponge "Bob"'') (DVD). Paramount Home Entertainment/Nickelodeon.&lt;/ref&gt; Hillenburg drew Squidward with six tentacles because "it was really just simpler for animation to draw him with six legs instead of eight".&lt;ref name="Case"/&gt; Show writer and storyboard artist [[Vincent Waller]] said: &lt;blockquote&gt;Squidward is hard to draw{{mdash}}he has a very odd-shaped head. Fortunately, his emotions are pretty even, but to get a whole lot of big emoting out of him is a challenge. His nose splits everything in half, so it's always like, 'OK, how am I going to work this and still make it read?'&lt;ref name=WallerHA&gt;{{cite news | author = Waller, Vincent | title = The Oral History of ''SpongeBob SquarePants'' | work = [[Hogan's Alley (magazine)|Hogan's Alley]] #17 | year = 2010 | accessdate = September 21, 2012|url=http://cartoonician.com/the-oral-history-of-spongebob-squarepants/|publisher=Bull Moose Publishing Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Hillenburg thought of making jokes with Squidward ejecting [[Cephalopod ink|ink]] but retired it because, according to him, "it always looks like he's pooping his pants".&lt;ref name="Case"/&gt; However, it occurs in ''[[The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water]]'' and the [[SpongeBob SquarePants (season 6)|sixth season]] episode, "Giant Squidward".

Conflicting statements from Hillenburg and Nickelodeon's official website have led to some doubt over whether the character is an octopus or a squid.&lt;ref name="First Season"&gt;''SpongeBob SquarePants: The Complete First Season''{{mdash}}Disc 1 (''Introduction'') (DVD). November 28, 2003. Paramount Home Entertainment/Nickelodeon.&lt;/ref&gt; Hillenburg named him Squidward because the name Octoward{{mdash}}in the words of Squidward's voice actor [[Rodger Bumpass]]{{mdash}}"just didn't work".&lt;ref name="AbsorbingTales1"&gt;Bumpass, Rodger. (March 1, 2005). ''The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie'' (''The Absorbing Tale Behind The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie'') (DVD). Paramount Home Entertainment/Nickelodeon.&lt;/ref&gt; The sound of Squidward's footsteps is produced by rubbing [[hot water bottle]]s. The footsteps, and those of the rest of the main characters, are recorded by the show's [[Foley (filmmaking)|foley]] crew. Sound designer Jeff Hutchins said that footstep sounds "[help] tell which character it is and what surface they're stepping on".&lt;ref name=HutchinsHA&gt;{{cite news | author = Hutchins, Jeff | title = The Oral History of ''SpongeBob SquarePants'' | work = [[Hogan's Alley (magazine)|Hogan's Alley]] #17 | year = 2010 | accessdate = September 21, 2012|url=http://cartoonician.com/the-oral-history-of-spongebob-squarepants/|publisher=Bull Moose Publishing Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bumpass inspired the idea of having Squidward ride a [[recumbent bicycle]]; Bumpass owns one of these bicycles, which he rides around [[Burbank, California]].&lt;ref name=KennyHA/&gt; Bumpass described it as his "little inside joke".&lt;ref name="AbsorbingTales1"/&gt;

===Voice===
[[File:Jack Benny - 1964.jpg|thumb|180px|Squidward's voice has been compared to that of American comic actor [[Jack Benny]].]]
Squidward's voice is provided by actor Rodger Bumpass, who voices several other ''SpongeBob SquarePants'' characters, including Squidward's mother. While creating the show and writing [[Help Wanted (SpongeBob SquarePants)|its pilot episode]] in 1997, Hillenburg and the show's then-creative director [[Derek Drymon]] were also conducting voice auditions.&lt;ref name=DrymonHA&gt;{{cite news | author = Drymon, Derek | title = The Oral History of ''SpongeBob SquarePants'' | work = [[Hogan's Alley (magazine)|Hogan's Alley]] #17 | year = 2010 | accessdate = September 21, 2012|url=http://cartoonician.com/the-oral-history-of-spongebob-squarepants/|publisher=Bull Moose Publishing Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mr. Lawrence]], who had worked with Hillenburg and Drymon on ''Rocko's Modern Life'', was Hillenburg's first choice for the role. Hillenburg had invited Lawrence to audition for all the show's characters.&lt;ref name=MrLawrenceInt&gt;{{cite video |people=[[Thomas F.

According to Bumpass, Squidward was "a very nasally, monotone kind of guy". He said the character became interesting to perform because of "his sarcasm, and then his frustration, and then his apoplexy, and so he became a wide spectrum of emotions".&lt;ref name=Bumpass&gt;{{cite web|last=Reardon|first=Samantha|title=Rodger Bumpass is Squidward Tentacles|url=http://georgiastatesignal.com/rodger-bumpass-is-squidward-tentacles/|work=[[The Signal (college newspaper)|The Signal]]|accessdate=March 28, 2014|date=September 8, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140328111302/http://georgiastatesignal.com/rodger-bumpass-is-squidward-tentacles/|archivedate=March 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tom Kenny]], the voice of SpongeBob, describes Bumpass recording his lines in the studio, saying, "I love watching Rodger&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;He's right next to me". According to Kenny, when Bumpass "goes apoplectic" as Squidward while recording, his head turns red, "and you're afraid he's going to have an embolism".&lt;ref name=KennyHA&gt;{{cite news | author = Kenny, Tom | title = The Oral History of ''SpongeBob SquarePants'' | work = [[Hogan's Alley (magazine)|Hogan's Alley]] #17 | year = 2010 | accessdate = September 21, 2012|url=http://cartoonician.com/the-oral-history-of-spongebob-squarepants/|publisher=Bull Moose Publishing Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several of the show's crew praise Bumpass for his performance and similitude to the character. Kenny called Bumpass "brilliant" and said, "[he] is sort of like Squidward".&lt;ref name=KennyHA/&gt; Staff writer [[Kent Osborne]] said, "I remember thinking about how much Rodger talks and acts like Squidward. That's why it's such a good voice—he's so connected to it".&lt;ref name=OsborneHA&gt;{{cite news | author = Osborne, Kent | title = The Oral History of ''SpongeBob SquarePants'' | work = [[Hogan's Alley (magazine)|Hogan's Alley]] #17 | year = 2010 | accessdate = September 21, 2012|url=http://cartoonician.com/the-oral-history-of-spongebob-squarepants/|publisher=Bull Moose Publishing Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Bumpass said, "I'm not him and he's not me, but what I'm required to do for him and what I am enabled to do for him is what makes it like me. It fits my particular talents and skills very well. So in that respect, yeah, he is me, but I am not the cranky, sarcastic, underachieving kind of guy that he is. He's easy to fall in, I will say that."&lt;ref name=Bumpass/&gt;

Squidward's voice has been compared to that of [[Jack Benny]]'s. Kenny said, "To me, there's something just so funny about that Jack-Benny-loyal-to-nobody character that Rodger Bumpass does such a great job of playing [...] Squidward".&lt;ref name="AbsorbingTales2"&gt;Kenny, Tom. (March 1, 2005). ''The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie'' (''The Absorbing Tale Behind The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie'') (DVD). Paramount Home Entertainment/Nickelodeon.&lt;/ref&gt; Arthur Brown, author of ''Everything I Need to Know, I Learned from Cartoons!'', said that Squidward "sounds a lot like Jack Benny".&lt;ref name="learned"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brown|first=Arthur|title=Everything I Need to Know, I Learned from Cartoons!|publisher=Arthur Brown|year=2008|page=85|isbn=978-1-4357-3248-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X-oi8LiETHIC&amp;pg=PA85&amp;dq=SpongeBob&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bumpass repudiated the relationship, saying "Jack Benny, no. Although he does have this observational sarcasm he occasionally brought out."&lt;ref name=Bumpass/&gt;

==Reception==
Squidward has received positive reception from critics and fans. SpongeBob's voice actor [[Tom Kenny]] named Squidward his favorite character on the show. He said, "He has an extra dimension where SpongeBob and Patrick's capacity of play mystifies him, but he's also jealous of it. When he tries to participate, he just fails utterly because he doesn't believe in it."&lt;ref name=KennyHA/&gt; Staff writer Casey Alexander said, "Squidward is the character I relate to the most. In an exaggerated way, he's the most human character. If I knew a human like SpongeBob, I probably would react to him like Squidward does".&lt;ref name=AlexanderHA&gt;{{cite news | author = Alexander, Casey | title = The Oral History of ''SpongeBob SquarePants'' | work = [[Hogan's Alley (magazine)|Hogan's Alley]] #17 | year = 2010 | accessdate = September 21, 2012|url=http://cartoonician.com/the-oral-history-of-spongebob-squarepants/|publisher=Bull Moose Publishing Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt; American singer [[Pharrell Williams]], who says he is a fan of the show, said that "Squidward is my favorite, though. If he was a human, I would hang out with him."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chang|first=Bee-Shyuan|title=Dropping in on Oscar|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/26/fashion/for-pharrell-williams-music-and-fashion-go-hand-in-glove.html?_r=0|work=The New York Times|accessdate=April 25, 2014|date=February 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bill Treadway of [[DVD Verdict]] said that Squidward is "a cross between [[Bert (Sesame Street)|Bert]] [of ''[[Sesame Street]]''], [[Woody Allen]], and [[Roger Addison]] [of ''[[Mister Ed|Mr. Ed]]'']&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;but he has some heart, if you can find it".

O. Scott]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' said, in his review of ''[[The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie]]'', that Squidward is one of his favorite secondary characters on the show, along with [[Sandy Cheeks]] and [[Mrs. Puff]]. He wrote, "I was sorry to see [them] pushed to the margins".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Scott|first1=A.

Millman further wrote, "Hmmm, Squidward is one gay squid, I think."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Millman|first1=Joyce|title=''SpongeBob SquarePants'': The Cartoon World of a Joyful Sponge|url=http://events.nytimes.com/2001/07/08/learning/wod.html|accessdate=June 5, 2014|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|date=July 8, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"[[Band Geeks]]", a second season episode that focuses on Squidward, is often considered by many critics and fans alike as one of the show's best episodes.&lt;ref&gt;For a sampling of the reviews, read the following:

In his review, Cavna said, "Squidward's mix of artistic aspiration in the face of goading, humiliation and unrelenting sub-mediocrity made this a kids' episode that adults can experience on a whole 'nother level."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cavna|first1=Michael|title=The Top Five ''SpongeBob'' Episodes: We Pick 'Em|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/comic-riffs/2009/07/the_top_five_spongebob_episode.html|accessdate=June 5, 2014|work=[[The Washington Post]]|publisher=Nash Holdings LLC|date=July 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On a less positive note, Squidward was listed among [[Common Sense Media]]'s "10 Worst TV Role Models of 2012". Author Sierra Filucci said that the character's selfishness is his "worst offense", called Squidward "the mean and nasty cashier at the Krusty Krab" and said that "[he] is nice only when he wants something".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Filucci|first=Sierra|title=10 Worst TV Role Models of 2012|url=https://www.commonsensemedia.org/blog/10-worst-tv-role-models-of-2012|publisher=[[Common Sense Media]]|accessdate=April 25, 2014|date=October 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[39th Daytime Emmy Awards]] in 2012, Bumpass was nominated for his vocal performance as Squidward in the Outstanding Performer in the Animated Program category{{mdash}}the first cast member to be nominated in this category.

The episode "[[The Sponge Who Could Fly]]" was adapted in 2009 as a stage musical at the [[Liverpool Empire Theatre]], and later in South Africa. Actor Charles Brunton originated the role of Squidward, later recalling that he loved the character, and the "fun [of] trying to re-create a well established cartoon character into a live performance on stage." Brunton prepared for the role by buying nine DVDs of the series, acting out Squidward's part in each episode, in his bedroom. He said, "it took ages to perfect the voice and the way he used his arms".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview with Charles Brunton from Love Never Dies|url=http://www.lastminutetheatretickets.com/londonwestend/interview-with-love-never-dies-star-charles-brunton/|publisher=LastMinuteTheatreTickets.com|accessdate=April 26, 2014|date=May 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brunton's performance and the musical were well received by most critics.

'''''The Autobiography of Malcolm X''''' was published in 1965, the result of a collaboration between human rights activist [[Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X]] and journalist [[Alex Haley]]. Haley [[Collaborative writing|coauthored]] the autobiography based on a series of in-depth interviews he conducted between 1963 and Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X's 1965 assassination. The ''Autobiography'' is a [[Religious conversion|spiritual conversion narrative]] that outlines Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X's philosophy of [[black pride]], [[black nationalism]], and [[pan-Africanism]]. After the leader was killed, Haley wrote the book's epilogue.{{Cref|a}} He described their collaborative process and the events at the end of Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X's life.

While Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X and scholars contemporary to the book's publication regarded Haley as the book's [[ghostwriter]], modern scholars tend to regard him as an essential collaborator. They say he intentionally muted his authorial voice to create the effect of Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X speaking directly to readers. Haley influenced some of Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X's literary choices. For example, Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X left the [[Nation of Islam]] during the period when he was working on the book with Haley. Rather than rewriting earlier chapters as a [[polemic]] against the Nation which Malcolm X had rejected, Haley persuaded him to favor a style of "suspense and drama". According to [[Manning Marable]], "Haley was particularly worried about what he viewed as Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X's [[anti-Semitism]]" and he rewrote material to eliminate it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/ccbh/pdfs/Souls.Rediscovering_Malcolms_Life.pdf |first=Manning |last=Marable |title=Rediscovering Malcolm's Life: A Historian's Adventures in Living History |journal=Souls |volume=7 |issue=1 |doi=10.1080/10999940590910023 |page=33 |year=2005 |accessdate=February 25, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the ''Autobiography'' was published, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reviewer described it as a "brilliant, painful, important book". In 1967, historian [[John William Ward (professor)|John William Ward]] wrote that it would become a classic American autobiography. In 1998, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' named ''The Autobiography of Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X'' as one of ten "required reading" nonfiction books. [[James Baldwin]] and [[Arnold Perl]] adapted the book as a film; their screenplay provided the source material for [[Spike Lee]]'s 1992 film ''[[Malcolm X (1992 film)|Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X]]''.

==Summary==
Published posthumously, ''The Autobiography of Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X'' is an account of the life of [[Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X]], born Malcolm Little (1925–1965), who became a human rights activist. Beginning with his mother's pregnancy, the book describes Malcolm's childhood in [[Michigan]], the death of his father under questionable circumstances, and his mother's deteriorating mental health that resulted in her [[Involuntary commitment|commitment]] to a [[psychiatric hospital]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dyson|1996|pp=4–5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Little's young adulthood in Boston and New York City is covered, as well as his involvement in [[organized crime]].

==Genre==
The ''Autobiography'' is a [[Religious conversion|spiritual conversion narrative]] that outlines Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X's philosophy of [[black pride]], [[black nationalism]], and [[pan-Africanism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stone|1982|pp= 250, 262–3}}; [[Robin Kelley|Kelley, Robin D. G.]], "The Riddle of the Zoot: Malcolm Little and Black Cultural Politics During World War II", in {{Harvnb|Wood|1992|p=157}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Literary critic [[Arnold Rampersad]] and Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X biographer [[Michael Eric Dyson]] agree that the narrative of the ''Autobiography'' resembles the [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustinian]] approach to [[Confessional writing|confessional narrative]]. Augustine's ''[[Confessions (St. Augustine)|Confessions]]'' and ''The Autobiography of Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X'' both relate the early [[Hedonism|hedonistic]] lives of their subjects, document deep philosophical change for spiritual reasons, and describe later disillusionment with religious groups their subjects had once revered.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arnold Rampersad|Rampersad, Arnold]], "The Color of His Eyes: Bruce Perry's ''Malcolm'' and Malcolm's Malcolm", in {{Harvnb|Wood|1992|p=122}}; {{Harvnb|Dyson|1996|p=135}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Haley and autobiographical scholar Albert E. Stone compare the narrative to the [[Icarus|Icarus myth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|X|Haley|1965|p=271}}; {{Harvnb|Stone|1982|p=250}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Author Paul John Eakin and writer Alex Gillespie suggest that part of the ''Autobiography''{{'}}s rhetorical power comes from "the vision of a man whose swiftly unfolding career had outstripped the possibilities of the traditional autobiography he had meant to write",&lt;ref&gt;Eakin, Paul John, "Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X and the Limits of Autobiography", in {{Harvnb|Andrews|1992|pp=152–61}}.&lt;/ref&gt; thus destroying "the illusion of the finished and unified personality".&lt;ref&gt;Gillespie, Alex, "Autobiography and Identity", in {{Harvnb|Terrill|2010|pp=34, 37}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to functioning as a spiritual conversion narrative, ''The Autobiography of Malcolm X'' also reflects generic elements from other distinctly American literary forms, from the Puritan conversion narrative of Jonathan Edwards and the secular self-analyses of Benjamin Franklin, to the African American slave narratives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Norton Anthology of African American Literature, Vol. 2|last = Gates, Jr.|first = Henry Louis|publisher = W.W.

Considering this, the editors of the ''Norton Anthology of African American Literature'' assert that, "Malcolm's ''Autobiography'' takes pains to interrogate the very models through which his persona achieves gradual self-understanding...his story's inner logic defines his life as a quest for an authentic mode of being, a quest that demands a constant openness to new ideas requiring fresh kinds of expression."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Norton Anthology of African American Literature|last = Gates, Jr.|first = Henry Louis|publisher = W.W.

[[File:Malcolm-x.jpg|right|thumb|upright= .85 |Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X waiting for a press conference to begin on March 26, 1964]]
Haley [[Collaborative writing|coauthored]] ''The Autobiography of Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X'', and also performed the basic functions of a [[ghostwriter]] and biographical [[amanuensis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stone|1982|pp= 24, 233, 247, 262–264}}.&lt;/ref&gt; writing, compiling, and editing&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gallen|1995|pp=243–244}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Autobiography'' based on more than 50 in-depth interviews he conducted with Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X between 1963 and his subject's 1965 assassination.&lt;ref&gt;Wideman, "Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X", in {{Harvnb|Wood|1992|pp=103–110}}; Rampersad, "The Color of His Eyes", in {{Harvnb|Wood|1992|pp=119, 127–128}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The two first met in 1959, when Haley wrote an article about the Nation of Islam for ''[[Reader's Digest]]'', and again when Haley interviewed Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X for ''[[Playboy]]'' in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|X|Haley|1965|p=391}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963 the [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] publishing company asked Haley to write a book about the life of Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X. American writer and literary critic [[Harold Bloom]] writes, "When Haley approached Malcolm with the idea, Malcolm gave him a startled look ..."&lt;ref name="Bloom page 12"/&gt; Haley recalls, "It was one of the few times I have ever seen him uncertain."&lt;ref name="Bloom page 12"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bloom|2008|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X was granted permission from Elijah Muhammad, he and Haley commenced work on the ''Autobiography'', a process which began as two-and three-hour interview sessions at Haley's studio in Greenwich Village.&lt;ref name="Bloom page 12"/&gt; Bloom writes, "Malcolm was critical of Haley's middle-class status, as well as his Christian beliefs and twenty years of service in the U.S. Military."&lt;ref name="Bloom page 12"/&gt;

When work on the ''Autobiography'' began in early 1963, Haley grew frustrated with Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X's tendency to speak only about Elijah Muhammad and the Nation of Islam. Haley reminded him that the book was supposed to be about Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X, not Muhammad or the Nation of Islam, a comment which angered Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X. Haley eventually shifted the focus of the interviews toward the life of his subject when he asked Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X about his mother:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|X|Haley|1965|p=392}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I said, 'Mr. Malcolm, could you tell me something about your mother?' And I will never, ever forget how he stopped almost as if he was suspended like a marionette. And he said, 'I remember the kind of dresses she used to wear. They were old and faded and gray.' And then he walked some more. And he said, 'I remember how she was always bent over the stove, trying to stretch what little we had.' And that was the beginning, that night, of his walk. And he walked that floor until just about daybreak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/eyesontheprize/about/pt_201.html |title=The Time Has Come (1964–1966) |work=[[Eyes on the Prize|Eyes on the Prize: America's Civil Rights Movement 1954–1985]], [[American Experience]] |publisher=[[PBS]] |accessdate=March 7, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100423154235/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/eyesontheprize/about/pt_201.html |archivedate=April 23, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Though Haley is ostensibly a ghostwriter on the ''Autobiography'', modern scholars tend to treat him as an essential and core collaborator who acted as an invisible figure in the composition of the work.&lt;ref&gt;Leak, Jeffery B., "Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X and black masculinity in process", in {{Harvnb|Terrill|2010|pp=52–55}}; Wideman, "Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X", in {{Harvnb|Wood|1992|pp=104–110, 119}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He minimized his own voice, and signed a contract to limit his authorial discretion in favor of producing what looked like verbatim copy.&lt;ref&gt;Wideman, "Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X", in {{Harvnb|Wood|1992|pp=103–116}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X biographer [[Manning Marable]] considers this view of Haley as simply a ghostwriter as a deliberate narrative construction of black scholars of the day who wanted to see the book as a singular creation of a dynamic leader and martyr.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Marable|Aidi|2009|pp=299–316}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marable argues that a critical analysis of the ''Autobiography'', or the full relationship between Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X and Haley, does not support this view; he describes it instead as a collaboration.&lt;ref name="Marable 2009 310–311"&gt;{{Harvnb|Marable|Aidi|2009|pp=310–311}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Haley's contribution to the work is notable, and several scholars discuss how it should be characterized.&lt;ref&gt;Terrill, Robert E., "Introduction" in, {{Harvnb|Terrill|2010|pp=3–4}}, Gillespie, "Autobiography and Identity", in {{Harvnb|Terrill|2010|pp= 26–36}}; Norman, Brian, "Bringing Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X to Hollywood", in {{Harvnb|Terrill|2010| pp=43}}; Leak, "Malcolm X and black masculinity in process", in {{Harvnb|Terrill|2010|pp=52–55 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a view shared by Eakin, Stone and Dyson, [[psychobiography|psychobiographical]] writer [[Eugene Victor Wolfenstein]] writes that Haley performed the duties of a quasi-[[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] [[Sigmund Freud|Freudian]] psychiatrist and spiritual confessor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wolfenstein|1993|pp= 37–39, 285, 289–294, 297, 369}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also Eakin, "Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X and the Limits of Autobiography", in {{Harvnb|Andrews|1992|pp=156–159}}; {{Harvnb|Dyson|1996|pp=52–55}}; {{Harvnb|Stone|1982|p=263}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Gillespie suggests, and Wolfenstein agrees, that the act of self-narration was itself a transformative process that spurred significant introspection and personal change in the life of its subject.&lt;ref&gt;Gillespie, "Autobiography and identity", in {{Harvnb|Terrill|2010|pp=34–37}}; {{Harvnb|Wolfenstein|1993|pp=289–294}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Haley exercised discretion over content,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Marable|Aidi|2009|pp=305–312}}.&lt;/ref&gt; guided Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X in critical stylistic and rhetorical choices,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dyson|1996|pp=23, 31}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and compiled the work.&lt;ref name="Wood 1992 103–105, 119"&gt;Wideman, "Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X", in {{Harvnb|Wood|1992|pp=103–105}}; Rampersad, "The Color of His Eyes", in {{Harvnb|Wood|1992|p=119}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the epilogue to the ''Autobiography'', Haley describes an agreement he made with Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X, who demanded that: "Nothing can be in this book's manuscript that I didn't say and nothing can be left out that I want in it."&lt;ref name="AMXpage394"&gt;{{Harvnb|X|Haley|1965|p=394}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As such, Haley wrote an addendum to the contract specifically referring to the book as an "as told to" account.&lt;ref name="AMXpage394"/&gt; In the agreement, Haley gained an "important concession": "I asked for—and he gave—his permission that at the end of the book I could write comments of my own about him which would not be subject to his review."&lt;ref name="AMXpage394"/&gt; These comments became the epilogue to the ''Autobiography'', which Haley wrote after the death of his subject.&lt;ref name="Wood 1992 104"&gt;Wideman, "Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X", in {{Harvnb|Wood|1992|p=104}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Narrative presentation===
In "Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X: The Art of Autobiography", writer and professor [[John Edgar Wideman]] examines in detail the narrative landscapes found in biography. Wideman suggests that as a writer, Haley was attempting to satisfy "multiple allegiances": to his subject, to his publisher, to his "editor's agenda", and to himself.&lt;ref name="WOOD103to105"&gt;Wideman, "Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X", in {{Harvnb|Wood|1992|pp=103–105}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Haley was an important contributor to the ''Autobiography''{{'}}s popular appeal, writes Wideman.&lt;ref&gt;Wideman, "Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X", in {{Harvnb|Wood|1992|pp=104–105}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Wideman expounds upon the "inevitable compromise" of biographers,&lt;ref name="WOOD103to105"/&gt; and argues that in order to allow readers to insert themselves into the broader socio-psychological narrative, neither coauthor's voice is as strong as it could have been.&lt;ref&gt;Wideman, "Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X", in {{Harvnb|Wood|1992|pp=106–111}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Wideman details some of the specific pitfalls Haley encountered while coauthoring the ''Autobiography'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;
You are serving many masters, and inevitably you are compromised. The man speaks and you listen but you do not take notes, the first compromise and perhaps betrayal. You may attempt through various stylistic conventions and devices to reconstitute for the reader your experience of hearing face to face the man's words. The sound of the man's narration may be represented by vocabulary, syntax, imagery, graphic devices of various sorts—quotation marks, punctuation, line breaks, visual patterning of white space and black space, markers that encode print analogs to speech—vernacular interjections, parentheses, ellipses, asterisks, footnotes, italics, dashes&amp;nbsp;....&lt;ref name="WOOD103to105"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the body of the ''Autobiography'', Wideman writes, Haley's authorial agency is seemingly absent: "Haley does so much with so little fuss ... an approach that appears so rudimentary in fact conceals sophisticated choices, quiet mastery of a medium".&lt;ref name="Wood 1992 104"/&gt; Wideman argues that Haley wrote the body of the ''Autobiography'' in a manner of Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X's choosing and the epilogue as an extension of the biography itself, his subject having given him [[Blank cheque|carte blanche]] for the chapter. Haley's voice in the body of the book is a tactic, Wideman writes, producing a text nominally written by Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X but seemingly written by no author.&lt;ref name="WOOD103to105"/&gt; The subsumption of Haley's own voice in the narrative allows the reader to feel as though the voice of Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X is speaking directly and continuously, a stylistic tactic that, in Wideman's view, was a matter of Haley's authorial choice: "Haley grants Malcolm the tyrannical authority of an author, a disembodied speaker whose implied presence blends into the reader's imagining of the tale being told."&lt;ref&gt;Wideman, "Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X", in {{Harvnb|Wood|1992|pp=103–105, 106–108}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In "Two Create One: The Act of Collaboration in Recent Black Autobiography: Ossie Guffy, Nate Shaw, and Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X", Stone argues that Haley played an "essential role" in "recovering the historical identity" of Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stone|1982|p=261}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Stone also reminds the reader that collaboration is a cooperative endeavor, requiring more than Haley's prose alone can provide, "convincing and coherent" as it may be:&lt;ref name="Stone 1982 263"&gt;{{Harvnb|Stone|1982|p=263}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Though a writer's skill and imagination have combined words and voice into a more or less convincing and coherent narrative, the actual writer [Haley] has no large fund of memories to draw upon: the subject's [Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X] memory and imagination are the original sources of the arranged story and have also come into play critically as the text takes final shape. Thus ''where'' material comes from, and ''what'' has been done to it are separable and of equal significance in collaborations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stone|1982|p=262}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In Stone's estimation, supported by Wideman, the source of autobiographical material and the efforts made to shape them into a workable narrative are distinct, and of equal value in a critical assessment of the collaboration that produced the ''Autobiography''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stone|1982|pp=262–263}}; Wideman, "Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X", in {{Harvnb|Wood|1992|pp=101–116}}.&lt;/ref&gt; While Haley's skills as writer have significant influence on the narrative's shape, Stone writes, they require a "subject possessed of a powerful memory and imagination" to produce a workable narrative.&lt;ref name="Stone 1982 263"/&gt;

===Collaboration between Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X and Haley===
The collaboration between Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X and Haley took on many dimensions; editing, revising and composing the ''Autobiography'' was a power struggle between two men with sometimes competing ideas of the final shape for the book. Haley "took pains to show how Malcolm dominated their relationship and tried to control the composition of the book", writes Rampersad.&lt;ref name="WOOD119"/&gt; Rampersad also writes that Haley was aware that memory is selective and that autobiographies are "almost by definition projects in fiction", and that it was his responsibility as biographer to select material based on his authorial discretion.&lt;ref name="WOOD119"/&gt; The narrative shape crafted by Haley and Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X is the result of a life account "distorted and diminished" by the "process of selection",  Rampersad suggests, yet the narrative's shape may in actuality be more revealing than the narrative itself.&lt;ref name="Wood 1992 118–119"/&gt; In the epilogue Haley describes the process used to edit the manuscript, giving specific examples of how Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X controlled the language.&lt;ref name="X 1965 414"&gt;{{Harvnb|X|Haley|1965|p=414}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

While Haley ultimately deferred to Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X's specific choice of words when composing the manuscript,&lt;ref name="X 1965 414"/&gt; Wideman writes, "the nature of writing biography or autobiography ... means that Haley's promise to Malcolm, his intent to be a 'dispassionate chronicler', is a matter of disguising, not removing, his authorial presence."&lt;ref name="WOOD103to105"/&gt; Haley played an important role in persuading Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X not to re-edit the book as a polemic against Elijah Muhammad and the Nation of Islam at a time when Haley already had most of the material needed to complete the book, and asserted his authorial agency when the ''Autobiography''{{'}}s "fractured construction",&lt;ref&gt;Wood, "Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X and the New Blackness", in {{Harvnb|Wood|1992|p=12}}.&lt;/ref&gt; caused by Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X's rift with Elijah Muhammad and the Nation of Islam, "overturned the design"&lt;ref name="Andrews 1992 152"/&gt; of the manuscript and created a narrative crisis.&lt;ref&gt;Eakin, "Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X and the Limits of Autobiography", in {{Harvnb|Andrews|1992|pp=156–158}}; Terrill, "Introduction", in {{Harvnb|Terrill|2010|p=3}};{{Harvnb|X|Haley|1965|p=406}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Autobiography''{{'}}s epilogue, Haley describes the incident:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I sent Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X some rough chapters to read. I was appalled when they were soon returned, red-inked in many places where he had told of his almost father-and-son relationship with Elijah Muhammad. Telephoning Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X, I reminded him of his previous decisions, and I stressed that if those chapters contained such telegraphing to readers of what was to lie ahead, then the book would automatically be robbed of some of its building suspense and drama. Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X said, gruffly, 'Whose book is this?' I told him 'yours, of course,' and that I only made the objection in my position as a writer. But late that night Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X telephoned. 'I'm sorry. You're right. I was upset about something. Forget what I wanted changed, let what you already had stand.' I never again gave him chapters to review unless I was with him. Several times I would covertly watch him frown and wince as he read, but he never again asked for any change in what he had originally said.&lt;ref name="X 1965 414"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Alex haley US coast guard.png|left|thumb|upright=0.44 |Haley in the United States Coast Guard, 1939]]

Haley's warning to avoid "telegraphing to readers" and his advice about "building suspense and drama" demonstrate his efforts to influence the narrative's content and assert his authorial agency while ultimately deferring final discretion to Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X.&lt;ref name="X 1965 414"/&gt; In the above passage Haley asserts his authorial presence, reminding his subject that as a writer he has concerns about narrative direction and focus, but presenting himself in such a way as to give no doubt that he deferred final approval to his subject.&lt;ref&gt;Eakin, "Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X and the Limits of Autobiography", in {{Harvnb|Andrews|1992|pp=157–158}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the words of Eakin, "Because this complex vision of his existence is clearly not that of the early sections of the ''Autobiography'', Alex Haley and Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X were forced to confront the consequences of this discontinuity in perspective for the narrative, already a year old."&lt;ref&gt;Eakin, "Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X and the Limits of Autobiography", in {{Harvnb|Andrews|1992|p=157}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X, after giving the matter some thought, later accepted Haley's suggestion.&lt;ref&gt;Dillard, Angela D., "Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X and African American conservatism", in {{Harvnb|Terrill|2010|p=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Marable argues that Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X was his own best revisionist, he also points out that Haley's collaborative role in shaping the ''Autobiography'' was notable. Haley influenced the narrative's direction and tone while remaining faithful to his subject's syntax and diction. Marable writes that Haley worked "hundreds of sentences into paragraphs", and organized them into "subject areas".&lt;ref name="Marable 2009 310–311"/&gt; Author William L. Andrews writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[T]he narrative evolved out of Haley's interviews with Malcolm, but Malcolm had read Haley's typescript, and had made interlineated notes and often stipulated substantive changes, at least in the earlier parts of the text. As the work progressed, however, according to Haley, Malcolm yielded more and more to the authority of his ghostwriter, partly because Haley never let Malcolm read the manuscript unless he was present to defend it, partly because in his last months Malcolm had less and less opportunity to reflect on the text of his life because he was so busy living it, and partly because Malcolm had eventually resigned himself to letting Haley's ideas about effective storytelling take precedence over his own desire to denounce straightaway those whom he had once revered.&lt;ref name="GREETHAM45"&gt;Andrews, William L., "Editing 'Minority' Texts", in {{Harvnb|Greetham|1997|p=45}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:MartinLutherKingMalcolmX-3.jpg|thumb|upright=.98 |right|Martin Luther King, Jr. and Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X meeting before a press conference after the Senate debate on the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]. This was the only time the two men ever met and their meeting lasted only one minute.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cone|1991|p=2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Andrews suggests that Haley's role expanded because the book's subject became less available to micro-manage the manuscript, and "Malcolm had eventually resigned himself" to allowing "Haley's ideas about effective storytelling" to shape the narrative.&lt;ref name="GREETHAM45"/&gt;

Marable studied the ''Autobiography'' manuscript "raw materials" archived by Haley's biographer, Anne Romaine, and described a critical element of the collaboration, Haley's writing tactic to capture the voice of his subject accurately, a disjoint system of data mining that included notes on scrap paper, in-depth interviews, and long "free style" discussions. Marable writes, "Malcolm also had a habit of scribbling notes to himself as he spoke." Haley would secretly "pocket these sketchy notes" and reassemble them in a [[sub rosa]] attempt to integrate Malcolm X's "subconscious reflections" into the "workable narrative".&lt;ref name="Marable 2009 310–311"/&gt; This is an example of Haley asserting authorial agency during the writing of the ''Autobiography'', indicating that their relationship was fraught with minor power struggles. Wideman and Rampersad agree with Marable's description of Haley's book-writing process.&lt;ref name="Wood 1992 103–105, 119"/&gt;

The timing of the collaboration meant that Haley occupied an advantageous position to document the multiple conversion experiences of Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X and his challenge was to form them, however incongruent, into a cohesive workable narrative. Dyson suggests that "profound personal, intellectual, and ideological changes ... led him to order events of his life to support a mythology of metamorphosis and transformation".&lt;ref name="Dyson 1996 134"/&gt; Marable addresses the confounding factors of the publisher and Haley's authorial influence, passages that support the argument that while Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X may have considered Haley a ghostwriter, he acted in actuality as a coauthor, at times without Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X's direct knowledge or expressed consent:&lt;ref name="MARABLE312"&gt;{{Harvnb|Marable|Aidi|2009|p=312}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Although Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X retained final approval of their hybrid text, he was not privy to the actual editorial processes superimposed from Haley's side. The Library of Congress held the answers. This collection includes the papers of Doubleday's then-executive editor, Kenneth McCormick, who had worked closely with Haley for several years as the Autobiography had been constructed. As in the Romaine papers, I found more evidence of Haley's sometimes-weekly private commentary with McCormick about the laborious process of composing the book. They also revealed how several attorneys retained by Doubleday closely monitored and vetted entire sections of the controversial text in 1964, demanding numerous name changes, the reworking and deletion of blocks of paragraphs, and so forth. In late 1963, Haley was particularly worried about what he viewed as Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X's anti-Semitism. He therefore rewrote material to eliminate a number of negative statements about Jews in the book manuscript, with the explicit covert goal of 'getting them past Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X,' without his coauthor's knowledge or consent. Thus, the censorship of Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X had begun well ''prior'' to his assassination.&lt;ref name="MARABLE312"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Marable says the resulting text was stylistically and ideologically distinct from what Marable believes Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X would have written without Haley's influence, and it also differs from what may have actually been said in the interviews between Haley and Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X.&lt;ref name="MARABLE312"/&gt;

===Myth-making===
In ''Making Malcolm: The Myth and Meaning of Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X'', Dyson criticizes historians and biographers of the time for re-purposing the ''Autobiography'' as a transcendent narrative by a "mythological" Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X without being critical enough of the underlying ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dyson|1996|pp=3, 23, 29–31, 33–36, 46–50, 152}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Further, because much of the available biographical studies of Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X have been written by white authors, Dyson suggests their ability to "interpret black experience" is suspect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dyson|1996|pp=59–61}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Autobiography of Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X'', Dyson says, reflects both Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X's goal of narrating his life story for public consumption and Haley's political ideologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dyson|1996|p=31}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Dyson writes, "''The Autobiography of Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X'' ... has been criticized for avoiding or distorting certain facts. Indeed, the autobiography is as much a testament to Haley's ingenuity in shaping the manuscript as it is a record of Malcolm's attempt to tell his story."&lt;ref name="Dyson 1996 134"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dyson|1996|p=134}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Malcolm X NYWTS 2a.jpg|left|thumb|upright= 0.77|Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X, March 12, 1964]]
Rampersad suggests that Haley understood autobiographies as "almost fiction".&lt;ref name="WOOD119"&gt;Rampersad, "The Color of His Eyes", in {{Harvnb|Wood|1992|p=119}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In "The Color of His Eyes: Bruce Perry's ''Malcolm'' and Malcolm's Malcolm", Rampersad criticizes Perry's biography, ''Malcolm: The Life of a Man Who Changed Black America'', and makes the general point that the writing of the ''Autobiography'' is part of the narrative of blackness in the 20th century and consequently should "not be held utterly beyond inquiry".&lt;ref&gt;[[Cornel West|West, Cornel]], "Malcolm X and Black Rage", in {{Harvnb|Wood|1992|pp=48–58}}; Rampersad, "The Color of His Eyes", in {{Harvnb|Wood|1992|p=119}}.&lt;/ref&gt; To Rampersad, the ''Autobiography'' is about psychology, ideology, a conversion narrative, and the myth-making process.&lt;ref&gt;Rampersad, "The Color of His Eyes", in {{Harvnb|Wood|1992|pp=117–133}}.&lt;/ref&gt; "Malcolm inscribed in it the terms of his understanding of the form even as the unstable, even treacherous form concealed and distorted particular aspects of his quest. But there is no Malcolm untouched by doubt or fiction. Malcolm's Malcolm is in itself a fabrication; the 'truth' about him is impossible to know."&lt;ref&gt;Rampersad, "The Color of His Eyes", in {{Harvnb|Wood|1992|p=120}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Rampersad suggests that since his 1965 assassination, Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X has "become the desires of his admirers, who have reshaped memory, historical record and the autobiography according to their wishes, which is to say, according to their needs as they perceive them."&lt;ref&gt;Rampersad, "The Color of His Eyes", in {{Harvnb|Wood|1992|p=118}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Further, Rampersad says, many admirers of Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X perceive "accomplished and admirable" figures like [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], and [[W. E. B. Du&amp;nbsp;Bois]] inadequate to fully express black humanity as it struggles with oppression, "while Malcolm is seen as the apotheosis of black individual greatness ... he is a perfect hero—his wisdom is surpassing, his courage definitive, his sacrifice messianic".&lt;ref name="Wood 1992 118–119"&gt;Rampersad, "The Color of His Eyes", in {{Harvnb|Wood|1992|pp=118–119}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Rampersad suggests that devotees have helped shape the myth of Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X.

Author Joe Wood writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[T]he autobiography iconizes Malcolm twice, not once. Its second Malcolm—the El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz finale—is a mask with no distinct ideology, it is not particularly Islamic, not particularly nationalist, not particularly humanist. Like any well crafted icon or story, the mask is evidence of its subject's humanity, of Malcolm's strong human spirit. But both masks hide as much character as they show. The first mask served a nationalism Malcolm had rejected before the book was finished; the second is mostly empty and available.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, Joe, "Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X and the New Blackness", in {{Harvnb|Wood|1992|p=13}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

To Eakin, a significant portion of the ''Autobiography'' involves Haley and Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X shaping the fiction of the completed self.&lt;ref&gt;Eakin, "Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X and the Limits of Autobiography", in {{Harvnb|Andrews|1992|pp=151–162}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Stone writes that Haley's description of the ''Autobiography''{{'}}s composition makes clear that this fiction is "especially misleading in the case of Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X"; both Haley and the ''Autobiography'' itself are "out of phase" with its subject's "life and identity".&lt;ref name="Andrews 1992 152"&gt;Eakin, "Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X and the Limits of Autobiography", in {{Harvnb|Andrews|1992|p=152}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dyson writes, "[[Louis Lomax|[Louis] Lomax]] says that Malcolm became a 'lukewarm [[Racial integration|integrationist]]'. [Peter] Goldman suggests that Malcolm was 'improvising', that he embraced and discarded ideological options as he went along. [[Albert Cleage|[Albert] Cleage]] and [Oba] T'Shaka hold that he remained a revolutionary black nationalist. And [[James Hal Cone|[James Hal] Cone]] asserts that he became an internationalist with a humanist bent."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dyson|1996|p=65}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Marable writes that Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X was a "committed internationalist" and "black nationalist" at the end of his life, not an "integrationist", noting, "what I find in my own research is greater continuity than discontinuity".&lt;ref name="MMAG"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.democracynow.org/2007/5/21/manning_marable_on_malcolm_x_a |title=Manning Marable on 'Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X: A Life of Reinvention' |last=Goodman |first=Amy |authorlink=Amy Goodman |date=May 21, 2007 |publisher=[[Democracy Now!]] |accessdate= March 7, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marable, in "Rediscovering Malcolm's Life: A Historian's Adventures in Living History", critically analyzes the collaboration that produced the ''Autobiography''. Marable argues autobiographical "memoirs" are "inherently biased", representing the subject as he would appear with certain facts privileged, others deliberately omitted. Autobiographical narratives self-censor, reorder event chronology, and alter names. According to Marable, "nearly everyone writing about Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X" has failed to critically and objectively analyze and research the subject properly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Marable|Aidi|2009|pp=305–310}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Marable suggests that most historians have assumed that the ''Autobiography'' is veritable truth, devoid of any ideological influence or stylistic embellishment by Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X or Haley. Further, Marable believes the "most talented revisionist of Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X, was Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X",&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Marable|Aidi|2009|p=306}}.&lt;/ref&gt; who actively fashioned and reinvented his public image and verbiage so as to increase favor with diverse groups of people in various situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stone|1982|p=259}}; {{Harvnb|Andrews|1992|pp=151–161}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Haley writes that during the last months of Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X's life "uncertainty and confusion" about his views were widespread in Harlem, his base of operations.&lt;ref name="Andrews 1992 152"/&gt; In an interview four days before his death Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X said, "I'm man enough to tell you that I can't put my finger on exactly what my philosophy is now, but I'm flexible."&lt;ref name="Andrews 1992 152"/&gt; Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X had not yet formulated a cohesive Black ideology at the time of his assassination&lt;ref&gt;Gillespie, "Autobiography and identity", in {{Harvnb|Terrill|2010|p=34}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and, Dyson writes, was "experiencing a radical shift" in his core "personal and political understandings".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dyson|1996|pp=21–22, 65–72}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy and influence==
Eliot Fremont-Smith, reviewing ''The Autobiography of Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X'' for ''The New York Times'' in 1965, described it as "extraordinary" and said it is a "brilliant, painful, important book".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1965/11/05/archives/an-eloquent-testament.html |title=An Eloquent Testament |last=Fremont-Smith |first=Eliot |date=November 5, 1965 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=June 1, 2010 }} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, historian [[John William Ward (professor)|John William Ward]] wrote that the book "will surely become one of the classics in American autobiography".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1967/02/26/archives/nine-expert-witnesses-american-history.html |title=Nine Expert Witnesses |last=Ward |first=John William |authorlink=John William Ward (professor) |date=February 26, 1967 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=June 1, 2010 }} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bayard Rustin]] argued the book suffered from a lack of critical analysis, which he attributed to Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X's expectation that Haley be a "chronicler, not an interpreter."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rustin|first=Bayard|title=Making His Mark|newspaper=New York Herald Tribune Book Week|date=November 14, 1965}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Newsweek]]'' also highlighted the limited insight and criticism in ''The Autobiography'' but praised it for [[Black Arts Movement|power]] and poignance.&lt;ref&gt;Reprinted in {{harv|Book Review Digest|1996|p=828}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, [[Truman J.

Considering the literary impact of Malcolm X's ''Autobiography'', we may note the tremendous influence of the book, as well as its subject generally, on the development of the [[Black Arts Movement]]. Indeed, it was the day after Malcolm's assassination that the poet and playwright, [[Amiri Baraka]], established the Black Arts Repertory Theater, which would serve to catalyze the aesthetic progression of the movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://harvardpress.typepad.com/hup_publicity/2012/04/a-literary-history-of-the-autobiography-of-malcolm-x.html|title = A Literary History of The Autobiography of Malcolm X|date = 20 April 2012|accessdate = 2 November 2015|website = Harvard University Press Blog|publisher = Harvard University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writers and thinkers associated with the Black Arts movement found in the ''Autobiography'' an aesthetic embodiment of his profoundly influential qualities, namely, "the vibrancy of his public voice, the clarity of his analyses of oppression's hidden history and inner logic, the fearlessness of his opposition to white supremacy, and the unconstrained ardor of his advocacy for revolution 'by any means necessary.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Norton Anthology of African American Literature, Vol. 2|last = Gates, Jr.|first = Henry Louis|publisher = W.W.

[[bell hooks]] writes "When I was a young college student in the early seventies, the book I read which revolutionized my thinking about race and politics was ''The Autobiography of Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X''."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bradley|1992|p=34}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Bradley (novelist)|David Bradley]] adds:

&lt;blockquote&gt;She [hooks] is not alone. Ask any middle-aged socially conscious intellectual to list the books that influenced his or her youthful thinking, and he or she will most likely mention ''The Autobiography of Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X''.

Some will say that ... they picked it up—by accident, or maybe by assignment, or because a friend pressed it on them—and that they approached the reading of it without great expectations, but somehow that book ... took hold of them.

'''''The Industries of the Future''''' is a 2016 non-fiction book written by [[Alec Ross (government official)|Alec Ross]], an American technology policy expert and the former Senior Advisor for Innovation to [[Hillary Clinton|Secretary of State Hillary Clinton]] during her time as [[Secretary of state|Secretary of State]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/04/05/AR2009040501732.html|title=Diplomatic Efforts Get Tech Support|last=Kang|first=Cecilia|date=2009-04-06|work=The Washington Post|access-date=2018-06-06|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ross is also a [[Fellow|senior fellow]] at [[Columbia University]], a former night-shift janitor, and a Baltimore teacher.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/alec-ross-the-industries-of-the-future-2016-4|title=Former State Department adviser says 6 forces will change the way we live and work over the next 20 years|work=Business Insider|access-date=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/politics/bs-md-alec-ross-profile-20180521-story.html|title=Democrat Alec Ross, tech expert and author, says as Maryland governor he'll focus on 'what's next'|last=Wood|first=Pamela|date=May 24, 2018|work=The Baltimore Sun|access-date=2018-06-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ross launched a campaign for the Governor of Maryland in 2017.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The book explores the forces that will change the world in robotics, genetics, digital currency, coding and big data.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Overview ==
The Industries of the Future by Senior Policy Advisor [[Alec Ross (government official)|Alec Ross]] explores the geopolitical, cultural and generational changes that will be driven by the key industries over the next twenty years. Ross is a Distinguished Visiting Fellow at [[Johns Hopkins University]]&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://alecross.com/about/|title=Alec Ross - Leading Expert on Innovation|website=Alec Ross {{!}} Technology Policy Expert, Innovator and Author|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was the Senior Advisor for Innovation to [[Hillary Clinton|Secretary of State Hillary Clinton]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Citation|last=Talks at Google|title=Alec Ross: "The Industries of the Future" {{!}} Talks at Google|date=2016-04-12|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMmM2Jtkhxc|accessdate=2016-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his time as Senior Advisor for Innovation he visited forty-one countries looking at the technological advances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wnyc.org/story/global-economy-come/?hootPostID=d6814599a4be899c06782c2a3f764f5e|title=A Road Map for the Future|website=WNYC|access-date=2016-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has been a guest lecturer at a number of institutions including the [[United Nations]], [[University of Oxford]], [[Harvard Law School]], and [[Stanford Graduate School of Business|Stanford Business School]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Ross started his career as a teacher through Teach for America and in 2000 he co-founded a technology-focused nonprofit organization called [[One Economy Corporation|One Economy]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The book explores several industries including robotics, genetics, coding and big data. Ross explores how advances in robotics and life sciences will change the way we live—robots, artificial intelligence and machine learning will have impact on our lives. According to Ross, dramatic advances in life sciences will increase our life expectancy—but not all will benefit from such changes. Ross spends time exploring "Code" and how the codefication of money and also weapons (computer security) will both benefit and potentially disrupt our international economies. Ross also looks at how data will be "the raw material of the information age."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Industries of the Future|last=Ross|first=Alec|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|year=2016|isbn=9781476753652|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ross also focuses on globalization and geopolitical economics. He explores how competitiveness and how societies, families and individuals will need to thrive.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Ross gives attention to the importance of women stating that "the states and societies that do the most for women are those that will be best positioned to compete and succeed in the industries of the future."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The book also touches on how to prepare children for "success in a world of increasing change and competition."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Ross discusses the shift of robotics from being manual and repetitive to cognitive and non-repetitive.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://searchcio.techtarget.com/feature/Alec-Ross-on-how-cognitive-robots-will-change-the-world|title=Alec Ross on how cognitive robots will change the world|website=SearchCIO|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; He believes that breakthroughs in [[mathematical model]]ing and [[cloud robotics]] ([[machine learning]] and [[Artificial intelligence|Artificial Intelligence]]) make robotics acceptable.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In the book Ross describes how other cultures have different reactions to robotics and he uses Japan's use of robotics in elder-care as an example.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He also expects that less developed countries may be able to leapfrog technologies in robotics much like they did with cell and mobile technologies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

According to Ross, the last trillion dollar industry was created out of computer code; the next trillion dollar industry will be created out of genome code.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/videos/tv/2016/02/16/exp-gps-0214-alec-ross-interview.cnn|title=Ross on the future of work - CNN Video|website=CNN|access-date=2016-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dawn-nakagawa/alec-ross--genetic-code_b_9146928.html|title=The Next Trillion-Dollar Industry Could Be Built on Genetic Code|date=2016-02-04|website=The Huffington Post|access-date=2016-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the book Ross describes how [[genome]] code is already being used to fix humans from curing [[cancer]] to hacking the brain to growing organs. He also describes the difference between the [[United States]] investment in genome research with that of [[China]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Ross then turns to the "code-ification" of money, markets and trust. He describes the transition from cash to mobile and online banking. He also discusses the sharing economy from eBay to AirBnB and then gives an overview of BitCoin and blockchain technology.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Ross also focuses on [[Computer security|cybersecurity]] and the weaponization of code with a focus on a move from cold war to "code war." Ross states that he expects the total market size of the cyberindustry to reach $175 billion by the end of 2017.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Development history ==
Alec Ross has said that he intended to give a balanced point of view with the book that it is neither a [[Utopia]]n or [[Dystopia]]n vision of the future which is why he opened the book with the struggles he witnessed growing up in West Virginia.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; On writing the book Ross said that he knows his parents would have wanted a book like this in the sixties that would describe what globalization would do and he wished that he had a book like this when he graduated from college that would have explored the Internet and digitization on the economy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The editors for the book were Jonathan Karp and Jonathan Cox of [[Simon &amp; Schuster]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Reviews and reception ==
''The Industries of the Future'' has received mainly positive reviews from the likes of ''[[Forbes]]'', ''New York Journal of Books'', and ''[[Financial Times]]''. ''Forbes'' contributor Peter Decherney said the book "reads like a portable [[TED (conference)|TED conference]] at which you've been seated next to the smartest guy in the room."&lt;ref name="Decherney"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/peterdecherney/2016/01/30/a-bad-time-to-be-a-control-freak-alec-ross-forecasts-the-industries-of-the-future/#575ae045209c|title=Searching for the Next Silicon Valley: Alec Ross Forecasts the Industries of the Future|last=Decherney|first=Peter|website=Forbes|access-date=2016-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was also listed on the Forbes list—''16 New Books for Leaders to Begin in 2016''.&lt;ref name="Decherney"/&gt; [[Tara Sonenshine|Tara D. Sonenshine]] in the ''New York Journal of Books'' called the book a good place to start "if you want to know how to survive and thrive in the fast-paced world of today and how to anticipate the opportunities  of tomorrow's information age." Sonenshine also called out the book for focusing on women and multiculturalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nyjournalofbooks.com/book-review/industries-future|title=a book review by Tara Sonenshine: The Industries of the Future|website=www.nyjournalofbooks.com|access-date=2016-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an article titled "Is predicting the future futile or necessary?" by Stephen Cave in the ''Financial Times'' is more critical, saying that Ross focuses on industries with already considerable coverage and investment but Cave points out that "rarely can the future be predicted by extending current trajectories."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/5815c14a-b2e7-11e5-b147-e5e5bba42e51.html|title=Is predicting the future futile or necessary?|last=Cave|first=Stephen|date=2016-01-08|newspaper=Financial Times|issn=0307-1766|access-date=2016-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a poetic, rather than realistic, depiction of what Jarman felt was the loss of traditional [[English culture]] in the 1980s and his anger about [[Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher]]'s England.&lt;ref name="Bezanson"/&gt; (including the formation of [[Section 28|Section 28 Local Government Act]].&lt;ref name="Scovell"/&gt;) Declaring it a [[homophobic]] and repressive [[totalitarian]] state.&lt;ref name="Kuc"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kuc |first1=Kamila |title=Last of England, The (1987) |url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/490045/index.html |publisher=screenonline.org.uk |accessdate=14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, Jarman was also diagnosed with [[AIDS]] and had just finished his 'masterpiece', ''[[Caravaggio (1986 film)|Caravaggio]]'', so the film is a confluence of angry imagination.&lt;ref name="Scovell"/&gt;
It is named after a [[The Last of England (painting)|painting]] by the artist [[Ford Madox Brown]]. The painting and the film, share themes of escape and the changing of place.&lt;ref name="Scovell"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Scovell |first1=Adam |title=In Profile: Derek Jarman’s The Last of England (1988) |url=http://www.thedoublenegative.co.uk/2014/11/in-profile-derek-jarmans-the-last-of-england-1988/ |date=7 November 2014 |publisher=thedoublenegative.co.uk |accessdate=14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He uses a shaky hand-held camera to cause anxiety and paranoia, and the ever-present melancholy is expressed in the extracts from poems, including [[T.S. Eliot]]'s ''[[The Hollow Men]]'' and [[Allen Ginsberg]]'s ''Howl'', which are monotonously read by narrator Nigel Terry.&lt;ref name="Kuc"/&gt;

In one of the film’s most famous scenes, is of Tilda Swinton, dressed not unlike the woman from Brown’s painting, as a [[bride]] mourning her executed husband,&lt;ref name="Kuc"/&gt; screaming and letting out a primal cry whilst rubbish burns around her and it was shot near the director’s home on the beach of [[Dungeness (headland)|Dungeness, Kent]].&lt;ref name="Scovell"/&gt;

Other images in the film, are counterpointed by [[Bach]] violin sonatas and 1980s disco. Skulls, fire and ashes embody death and destruction, while scenes of sex on a Union Jack flag and 'Spring' [[masturbating]] show a disregard for social conventions and suggest a country in a state of chaos and sordid decadence.&lt;ref name="Kuc"/&gt;

==Reviews==
On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], it has an average score of 68%, based on 3 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=THE LAST OF ENGLAND (1987) |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_last_of_england |publisher=rottentomatoes.com |accessdate=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'What proof do you need the world's curling up like an autumn leaf?' is ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'' magazine's review.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Last of England |url=https://www.timeout.com/london/film/the-last-of-england |publisher=timeout.com |accessdate=14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Terrible" is David Bezanson's review, "Impressionistic" doesn't have to mean "bad" and "It's graphic and disorienting, yet also totally trite".&lt;ref name="Bezanson"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bezanson |first1=David |title=The Last of England Review |url=http://www.contactmusic.net/film/review/thelastofengland |publisher=contactmusic.net |accessdate=14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Book==
Jarman wrote a book to accompany the film,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jarman, |first1=Derek |last2=Hirst |first2=David L. |title=The Last of England |date=1 January 1987 |publisher=Constable &amp; Robinson |isbn=0094680809 |url=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1425757.The_Last_of_England}}&lt;/ref&gt; which deals more explicitly with the relationship he had with his father, who was a [[Lancaster bomber]] pilot in the [[Second World War]]. Jarman used the impact of his father's despair, depression and violence on his own artistic vision. The depression that his father suffered is attributed to the high number of fatalities that bomber crews experienced and the [[carpet bombing|carpet-bombing]] of civilians. 

The book and to a lesser extent the film are very much in the tradition of [[Roland Barthes]] ''Camera Lucida'', [[Susan Sontag]]'s ''On Photography'', [[Jeanette Winterson]]'s 'Art Objects' and to a lesser extent [[John Berger]]'s ''Ways of Seeing'' in that he has used the deeply familiar and personal as a vehicle for dialogue about art and contemporary culture.

'''''The Mind in the Cave: Consciousness and the Origins of Art''''' is a 2002 study of Upper Palaeolithic European [[rock art]] written by the archaeologist [[David Lewis-Williams]], then a professor at the [[University of the Witwatersrand]] in [[Johannesburg]], [[South Africa]].

==Background==
Lewis-Williams first published some of the ideas that would form the basis for his argument in ''The Mind in the Cave'' in a 1988 [[academic paper]] co-written with Thomas Dowson entitled "The Signs of All Times: Entoptic Phenomena in Upper Palaeolithic Art" Fellow archaeologist Robert J. Wallis would later characterise this as "one of the most controversial papers" in rock art research.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wal04|Wallis 2004]]. p. 357&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
{{Expand section|date=November 2012}}
Lewis-Williams opens ''The Mind in the Cave'' with a preface, in which he outlines the [[methodology]] that he is working with, and emphasises his position that "we do not have to explain everything to explain something".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lew02|Lewis-Williams]]. pp. 1&amp;ndash;11.&lt;/ref&gt; what he calls "Three Caves: Three Time-Bytes", brief page-long narratives set in the Upper Palaeolithic sites of the [[Trois Frères|Volp Caves]], the [[Niaux Cave]] and [[Chauvet Cave]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lew02|Lewis-Williams 2005]]. pp. 12&amp;ndash;17.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first chapter, entitled "Discovering Human Antiquity", Lewis-Williams explores the early scholarly understanding of Upper Palaeolithic art, stemming from the increased interest in the origins of the human species sparked by the publication of [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[On the Origin of Species]]''. He proceeds to discuss early attempts to analyse both portable and parietal art, and the early belief that cave paintings were forgeries, being too sophisticated to have been produced by "primitive" humans, before scholars eventually came to accept their authenticity. Finally, he notes the developments in [[radiocarbon dating]], which enabled far more accurate dating of archaeological sites, allowing scholars to appreciate the exact antiquity of the Upper Palaeolithic.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lew02|Lewis-Williams 2005]]. pp. 18&amp;ndash;40.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapter two, "Seeking Answers", proceeds to examine the various different interpretative approaches that scholars have taken to the Upper Palaeolithic cave art of Europe. Noting the problems innate with using the term "[[art]]", he nevertheless believes it can still be used in this context with caution. From there, he looks at the early claims that rejected symbolic-religious explanations, instead adopting an "art for art's sake" approach, and then its fall from academic credibility. He then discusses the claims that the artworks did have symbolic meanings, being either [[totemism|totemic]] or representative of [[sympathetic magic]], both arguments made from ethnographic parallels with modern hunter-gatherer communities such as those of Australia. Lewis-Williams goes on to discuss [[structuralism|structuralist]] interpretations of the artworks, such as those first advocated by [[Giambattista Vico]] and [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], and later reformulated by the likes of [[Max Raphael]], [[Annette Laming-Emperaire]] and [[André Leroi-Gourhan]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lew02|Lewis-Williams 2005]]. pp. 41&amp;ndash;68.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and recognition==
Archaeologist Robert J. Wallis reviewed ''The Mind in the Cave'' for the ''Journal for the Academic Study of Magic''. Proclaiming it to be "a timely introduction" to a shamanistic interpretation of Upper Palaeolithic rock art, Wallis believed that Lewis-Davidson puts forward "a compelling case" for the nature of such cave paintings. Although he had some reservations, he noted that the book established the shamanistic interpretation as being the "forefront" of rock art research. He ended his review by mentioning the manner in which Lewis-Williams ended the book by emphasising that there is no reason for contemporary people to be shamans; himself a [[Neoshamanism|Neoshaman]], Wallis noted that Lewis-Williams might be concerned that "his work will inspire neo-Shamanism rather than rational materialism", but proceeded to express his opinion that even if it did so, it would "be none the worse for that."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wal04|Wallis 2004]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wider recognition===
Writing in his opening paper, "Agency, Intellect and the Archaeological Agenda", published in the academic anthology ''[[Signals of Belief in Early England|Signals of Belief in Early England: Anglo-Saxon Paganism Revisited]]'' (2010), the archaeologist [[Martin Carver]] praised Lewis-Williams' book, describing it as "stimulating" and remarking that it had "redefined the world of early spirituality for archaeologists". Considering Lewis-Williams' case to be "persuasive", Carver felt that the theories contained within it could be used to shine light on the world of [[Anglo-Saxon paganism]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Car10|Carver 2010]]. p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2895">In [[mathematics]], a '''Weyl sequence''' is a sequence from the [[equidistribution theorem]] proven by [[Hermann Weyl]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weyl|first=H.| author-link=Hermann Weyl |title=Über die Gleichverteilung von Zahlen mod. Eins |trans-title=On the uniform distribution of numbers modulo one |language=de |journal=Mathematische Annalen |date=September 1916 |volume=77|pages=313–352 | doi = 10.1007/BF01475864 | issue = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sequence of all multiples of an irrational ''α'',
::0, ''α'', 2''α'', 3''α'', 4''α'', ...
:is [[Continuous uniform distribution|equidistributed]] modulo 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1=L. | last1=Kuipers | first2=H. | last2=Niederreiter |author2-link = Harald Niederreiter | title=Uniform Distribution of Sequences | publisher=Dover Publications | year=2006 | origyear=1974 | isbn=0-486-45019-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other words, the sequence of the fractional parts of each term will be uniformly distributed in the interval&amp;nbsp;[0,&amp;nbsp;1).

== In computing ==
In [[computing]], an integer version of this sequence is often used to generate a [[discrete uniform distribution]] rather than a continuous one.   Instead of using an irrational number, which cannot be calculated on a digital computer, the ratio of two integers is used in its place.  An integer ''k'' is chosen, [[relatively prime]] to an integer modulus ''m''.  In the common case that ''m'' is a power of 2, this amounts to requiring that ''k'' is odd.&lt;!-- It's not technically required that 0 &lt; k &lt; m, since only the residue class of k matters.--&gt;

The sequence of all multiples of such an integer integer&amp;nbsp;''k'',
::0, ''k'', 2''k'', 3''k'', 4''k'', …                           
: is equidistributed modulo ''m''.

That is, the sequence of the remainders of each term when divided by ''m'' will be uniformly distributed in the interval {{nowrap begin}}[0, ''m''&lt;/sup&gt;{{nowrap end}}).

The term appears to originate with [[George Marsaglia]]’s paper [http://www.jstatsoft.org/v08/i14/paper "Xorshift RNGs"].&lt;ref name="marsaglia"&gt;{{cite journal
| first=George | last=Marsaglia | authorlink=George Marsaglia |
| title=Xorshift RNGs
| journal=[[Journal of Statistical Software]]
| volume=8 | issue=14
| date=July 2003
| url=http://www.jstatsoft.org/v08/i14/paper | doi=10.18637/jss.v008.i14}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The following C code generates what Marsaglia calls a "Weyl sequence":
::d += 362437;
In this case, the odd integer is 362437, and the results are computed modulo {{nowrap|1=''m'' = 2&lt;sup&gt;''32''&lt;/sup&gt;}} because d is a 32-bit quantity. The results are equidistributed modulo 2&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt;.

'''"Win with the Lion"''' (Ukrainian: ''Перемагай з Левом'') is an annual [[tourism]] conference held in [[Lviv]], [[Ukraine]], each autumn. The conference is mainly organized by the [[non-governmental organization]]s [[Etnovyr (organization)|Etnovyr]] and Dik-Art.

==2009 conference==

The first "Win with the Lion" conference took place on 29 October 2009, in Lviv, Ukraine. The main aim of the program was to present the historical and tourist potential of the city and prepare it for the arrival of the [[2012 UEFA European Football Championship]]. There were presentations by domestic and foreign tourism experts, round table discussions about branding and tourist products, workshops, and discussions about whether Lviv should join the international association [[European Cities Marketing]]. The conference was organized by Lviv City Council in association with representatives of the city's tourism industry.

Foreign experts that were invited to the 2009 conference include: Dieter Hardt-Stremayr, President of European Cities Marketing; John Heeley, Professor at the [[University of Nottingham]], and founder of Best Destination Marketing; Adam Mikolajczyk, executive director of Brief for Poland; Ossian Stiernstrand, of Göteborg &amp; Co; Wolfgang J.Kraus, Vienna Tourist Board; and Brigitte Weiss, Vienna Tourist Board.

==2010 conference==
The second conference was held on 15–17 November 2010, and its topic was: "Tourism: Cooperation as a key to success and victory".

The main emphasis of this conference was placed on marketing and branding - the process of city brand formation. Leading experts presented their vision of tourism development in Lviv, and shared their own experiences of European cities. Another subject discussed was the working out of new ideas for further cooperation between business and government to optimize the development of the tourism sphere in Ukraine. Experts acknowledged that Lviv is heading in the right direction on the issue of branding and has a great tourism potential. This year's conference was marked by the fact that European Cities Marketing presented a certificate of membership to the city of Lviv, making it the only city in Ukraine to join the organization.

Overall, the conference was attended by over 200 people from all over Ukraine - Lviv, [[Kiev]], [[Uzhgorod]], [[Zhytomyr]], [[Chernigiv]], and other cities.

==2011 conference==

The third "Win with the Lion" conference was held on 24–25 November 2011. Its topic was: "The world travel trends: Surf's Up!". This year's speakers included experts from [[Vienna]], [[Graz]], [[Berlin]], [[London]], [[Kraków]], [[Moscow]], and [[Istanbul]].

Various presentations during the conference explored how Vienna, Graz, and Berlin managed to become successful tourist cities, and how to create an interesting competitive tourism product. Special attention was devoted to cooperation between business and government in urban tourism, and how [[tourist information centre]]s should be working. Among the speakers were: John Heeley, Interim Chief Executive Officer of European Cities Marketing; Susanne Höller, Graz Tourismus &amp; Stadtmarketing Gmbh Austria; Gabriela Schweinberger, Berlin Tourism Marketing GmbH Germany; Katrin Heintschel, Vienna Tourist Board; Christian Gessl, [[Federal Economic Chamber of Austria]]; Hans-Ulrich Trosien, from Germany; Jerzy Gajewski, Municipality of Kraków; Olga Tikhonova, founder of Delicious Istanbul; Andreas Zins, Department of Tourism and Hospitality Management, [[MODUL University Vienna]]; Nick Greenfield, European Tour Operators Association; Ruslan Ashymkanov, Trout &amp; Partners.

== 2012 conference ==
The third conference was held on 21–22 November 2012, and its topic was: "The meetings and events industry – Ukraine, are you ready to benefit?". Meetings industry leaders made presentations on new trends and challenges that should be considered by new destinations. The Tourist Information Workshop, which proved popular in 2011, continued this year in cooperation with GIZ organizers, inviting newly established tourist information centres from all over Ukraine to gain knowledge and share best practices from European experts, including: Paola Casubolo, CEO of Lovingenova; Gabriela Schweinberger, international business coach and consultant; Freya Sackx, Ghent Tourist Information Centre; Lev Kuznetso, Deputy Director of St. Petersburg Marketing Agency; and Olena Holysheva, Head of Lviv Tourist Information Centre.

Other speakers at the 2012 conference included: Ignacio de Delàs, Turisme de Barcelona; Roger Pride, Cardiff and Co; Beata Palis, Krakow Convention Bureau; Paul Kennedy, Director of Kennedy Integrated Solutions; Elisabeth Hansa, owner of International Consultancy and Business Development; and Tom Hulton, International Relations IMEX Group. Delegates also heard a seminar on the topic of "How Ukraine can stay on the map in 2013", delivered by the European Tour Operators Association and moderated by Nick Greenfield, the Head of Tour Operator Relations.

{{Dablink|Known in India and the United States as '''Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone'''}}
[[File:David Heyman1.jpg|thumb|upright|David Heyman has produced every film in the Wizarding World.]]
[[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]], a seemingly ordinary eleven-year-old boy, is actually a [[Wizard (fantasy)|wizard]] and survivor of [[Lord Voldemort]]'s attempted rise to power. Harry is rescued from his unkind [[Muggle]] relatives and takes his place at [[Hogwarts|Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], where he and his friends [[Ron Weasley]] and [[Hermione Granger]] become entangled in the mystery of the [[Philosopher's Stone]], which is being kept within the school.

In October 1998, [[Warner Bros.]] purchased the film rights to the first four novels of the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' fantasy series by [[J. K. Rowling]] for a seven-figure sum,&lt;ref name="HPFilmRights" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;after a pitch from producer [[David Heyman]].&lt;ref name="HeymanPitch" /&gt; Warner Bros. took particular notice of Rowling's wishes and thoughts about the films when drafting her contract. One of her principal stipulations was that they be shot in Britain with an all-British cast,&lt;ref name="BritishCast" /&gt; which has been generally adhered to. On 8 August 2000, the virtually unknown [[Daniel Radcliffe]] and newcomers [[Rupert Grint]] and [[Emma Watson]] were selected to play Harry Potter, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger.&lt;ref name="TrioCast" /&gt; [[Chris Columbus (filmmaker)|Chris Columbus]] was hired to direct the film adaptation of&amp;nbsp;''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]],''&lt;ref name="Columbus" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;with [[Steve Kloves]] selected to write the screenplay.&lt;ref name="KlovesScreenplay" /&gt; Filming began on 29 September 2000 at [[Warner Bros.

Because of time constraints, the date was put back, and ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film)|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]'' was released in the United Kingdom and the United States on 16 November 2001.&lt;ref name="HP1Release" /&gt;

===Critical and public response===
All the films have been a success commercially and the majority a success critically, making the franchise one of the major Hollywood "tent-poles" akin to ''[[James Bond in film|James Bond]]'', ''[[Star Wars]]'', ''[[Indiana Jones (franchise)|Indiana Jones]]'', and ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean (film series)|Pirates of the Caribbean]]''. The ''Harry Potter'' series is noted by audiences for growing visually [[dark fantasy|darker]] and more mature as each film was released.&lt;ref name="ColumbusDark" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TimeDarker" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ReutersDark" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DarkMoody" /&gt;
