In [[radio]] equipment, '''Automatic Frequency Control''' (AFC), also called '''Automatic Fine Tuning''' (AFT), is a method or circuit to automatically keep a [[resonant circuit]] [[Tuner (electronics)|tuned]] to the [[frequency]] of an incoming [[radio signal]].  It is primarily used in [[radio receiver]]s to keep the receiver tuned to the frequency of the desired station.  

In [[radio communication]], AFC is needed because, after the [[bandpass]] frequency of a receiver is tuned to the frequency of a [[transmitter]], the two frequencies may drift apart, interrupting the reception.  This can be caused by a poorly controlled transmitter frequency, but the most common cause is drift of the center bandpass frequency of the receiver, due to thermal or mechanical drift in the values of the electronic components.
 
Assuming that a receiver is nearly tuned to the desired frequency, the AFC [[electrical network|circuit]] in the receiver develops an error [[voltage]] proportional to the degree to which the receiver is mistuned. This error voltage is then [[Feedback|fed back]] to the tuning circuit in such a way that the tuning error is reduced. In most [[frequency modulation]] (FM) detectors, an error voltage of this type is easily available.  See [[Negative feedback]].

AFC was mainly used in radios and television sets around the mid-20th century. In the 1970s, receivers began to be designed using [[frequency synthesizer]] circuits, which synthesized the receiver's input frequency from a [[crystal oscillator]] using the vibrations of an ultra-stable [[crystal oscillator|quartz crystal]]. These maintained sufficiently stable frequencies that AFC's were no longer needed.

''Saccharomyces exiguus'' (also known as ''S. minor'') is a wild yeast found on plants, fruits, and grains that is occasionally used for baking; however, in general it is not used in a pure form but comes from being propagated in a [[sourdough]] starter.

==History==
[[Image:Compressed fresh yeast - 1.jpg|right|thumb|A block of compressed fresh yeast in its wrapper]]
It is not known when yeast was first used to bake bread; the earliest definite records come from Ancient Egypt.&lt;ref name="Egypt"&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A2791820 "The History of Bread Yeast"]. [[BBC]]. Retrieved December 24, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers speculate that a mixture of flour meal and water was left longer than usual on a warm day and the yeasts that occur in natural contaminants of the flour caused it to ferment before baking. The resulting bread would have been lighter and tastier than the previous hard [[flatbread]]s. It is generally assumed that the earliest forms of leavening were likely very similar to modern sourdough; the leavening action of yeast would have been discovered from its action on flatbread doughs, and would have been either cultivated separately or transferred from batch to batch by means of previously mixed ("old") dough. Also, the development of leavened bread seems to have developed in close proximity to the development of [[beer]] brewing, and [[barm]] from the beer fermentation process can also be used in bread making.

Without an understanding of [[microbiology]], early bakers would have had little ability to directly control yeast cultures, but still kept locally interesting cultures by reusing doughs and starters to leaven later batches. However, it became possible to isolate and propagate favored yeast strains in the same manner as was done in the beer industry, and it eventually became practical to propagate yeast in a slurry with a composition similar to beer [[wort (brewing)|wort]], usually including [[malt#Uses|malted barley]] and wheat flour. Such cultures (sometimes referred to in old American cookery as "emptins", from their origins as the dregs of beer or cider fermentation) would become the ancestors of modern baker's yeast, as, in general, they were carefully maintained to avoid what would later be discovered to be bacterial contamination, including using preservatives such as [[hops]] as well as boiling the growth medium.

In the 19th century, bread bakers obtained their yeast from beer brewers, and this led to sweet-fermented breads such as the Imperial "[[Kaiser roll|Kaiser-Semmel]]" roll,&lt;ref name="urlReport on Vienna bread, page 86 - Google Books"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6jRDAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Report+on+Vienna+bread&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=sweet&amp;f=false |title=Report on Vienna bread - Google Books |author=Eben Norton Horsford |page=86 |publisher=Washington: Government Printing Office |year=1875 |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which in general lacked the sourness created by the acidification typical of ''[[Lactobacillus]]''. However, beer brewers slowly switched from top-fermenting to bottom-fermenting yeast (both S. cerevisiae) and this created a shortage of yeast for making bread, so the [[Vienna bread|Vienna Process]] was developed in 1846.&lt;ref name="isbn0-521-77917-0"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Kristiansen, B. |author2=Ratledge, Colin |title=Basic biotechnology |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |year=2001 |page=378 |isbn=0-521-77917-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the innovation is often popularly credited for using steam in baking ovens, leading to a different crust characteristic, it is notable for including procedures for high milling of grains (see Vienna grits&lt;ref name="urlReport on Vienna bread, page 31-32 - Google Books"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6jRDAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Report+on+Vienna+bread&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=sweet&amp;f=false |title=Report on Vienna bread - Google Books |author=Eben Norton Horsford |pages=31–32 |publisher=Washington: Government Printing Office |year=1875 |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;), cracking them incrementally instead of mashing them with one pass; as well as better processes for growing and harvesting top-fermenting yeasts, known as press-yeast.

Refinements in microbiology following the work of [[Louis Pasteur]] led to more advanced methods of culturing pure strains. In 1879, Great Britain introduced specialized growing vats for the production of ''S. cerevisiae'', and in the United States around the turn of the century centrifuges were used for concentrating the yeast,&lt;ref name="isbn0-521-32749-0"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Marx, Jean  |author2=Litchfield, John H.  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=A Revolution in biotechnology |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |year=1989 |page=71 |isbn=0-521-32749-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  making modern commercial yeast possible, and turning yeast production into a major industrial endeavor. The slurry yeast made by small bakers and grocery shops became cream yeast, a suspension of live yeast cells in growth medium, and then compressed yeast, the fresh cake yeast that became the standard leaven for bread bakers in much of the Westernized world during the early 20th century.

During [[World War II]], [[Fleischmann's Yeast|Fleischmann's]] developed a [[Wiktionary:granulate|granulated]] active dry yeast for the United States armed forces, which did not require refrigeration and had a longer shelf-life and better temperature tolerance than fresh yeast; it is still the standard yeast for US military recipes. The company created yeast that would rise twice as fast, cutting down on baking time. [[Lesaffre]] would later create instant yeast in 1973, which has gained considerable use and market share at the expense of both fresh and dry yeast in their various applications.

[[Image:Dry yeast.jpg|thumb|right|Active dried yeast, a granulated form in which yeast is commercially sold]]

Baker's yeast is available in a number of different forms, the main differences being the moisture contents.&lt;ref name="isbn0-387-38563-0"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Young, Linda |author2=Cauvain, Stanley P. |title=Technology of Breadmaking |publisher=Springer |location=Berlin |year=2007 |page=77 |isbn=0-387-38563-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though each version has certain advantages over the others, the choice of which form to use is largely a question of the requirements of the recipe at hand and the training of the cook preparing it. Dry yeast forms are good choices for longer-term storage, often lasting more than a year at room temperatures without significant loss of viability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=EBBUTT LI |title=The relationship between activity and cell-wall permeability in dried baker's yeast |journal=J. Gen. Microbiol. |volume=25 |issue= 1|pages=87–95 |date=May 1961 |pmid=13725540 |doi=10.1099/00221287-25-1-87 |url=http://mic.sgmjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/25/1/87}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, with occasional allowances for liquid content and temperature, the different forms of commercial yeast are considered interchangeable.

*'''Cream yeast''' is the closest form to the yeast slurries of the 19th century, in essence being a suspension of yeast cells in liquid, siphoned off from the growth medium. Its primary use is in industrial bakeries with special high-volume dispensing and mixing equipment, and it is not readily available to small bakeries or home cooks.&lt;ref name="Reinhart, Peter 2001 61"&gt;{{cite book |author=Reinhart, Peter |title=The bread baker's apprentice: mastering the art of extraordinary bread |publisher=Ten Speed Press |location=Berkeley, Calif |year=2001 |page=61 |isbn=1-58008-268-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Compressed yeast''' is, in essence, cream yeast with most of the liquid removed. It is a soft solid, beige in color, and best known in the consumer form as small, foil-wrapped cubes of '''cake yeast'''. It is also available in larger-block form for bulk usage.&lt;ref name=Gisslen_2008&gt;{{cite book |author=Gisslen, Wayne |title=Professional baking |publisher=John Wiley |location=New York |year=2008 |isbn=0-471-78349-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is highly perishable; though formerly widely available for the consumer market, it has become less common in supermarkets in some countries due to its poor keeping properties, having been superseded in some such markets by active dry and instant yeast. It is still widely available for commercial use, and is somewhat more tolerant of low temperatures than other forms of commercial yeast; however, even there, instant yeast has made significant market inroads.
*'''Active dry yeast''' is the form of yeast most commonly available to non-commercial bakers in the United States. It consists of coarse oblong granules of yeast, with live yeast cells encapsulated in a thick jacket of dry, dead cells with some growth medium. Under most conditions, active dry yeast must first be [[Proofing (baking technique)|proofed]] or rehydrated. It can be stored at room temperature for a year, or frozen for more than a decade, which means that it has better keeping qualities than other forms, but it is generally considered more sensitive than other forms to thermal shock when actually used in recipes.
[[Image:20100911 165854 YeastGrain.jpg|thumb|right|A single grain of active dry yeast.&amp;nbsp;The numbered ticks on the scale are 230 [[micrometer|µm]] apart]]
*'''Instant yeast''' appears similar to active dry yeast, but has smaller granules with substantially higher percentages of live cells per comparable unit volumes.&lt;ref name="Reinhart, Peter 2001 61"/&gt; It is more perishable than active dry yeast but also does not require rehydration, and can usually be added directly to all but the driest doughs. In general, instant yeast has a small amount of [[ascorbic acid]] added as a preservative. Some producers provide specific variants for doughs with high sugar contents, and such yeasts are more generally known as '''osmotolerant''' yeasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Panchal, Chandra J. |title=Yeast strain selection |publisher=M. Dekker |location=New York |year=1990 |pages=140–182 |isbn=0-8247-8276-3 |accessdate=2011-04-24 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MQxWjhzbTvsC&amp;pg=PA155#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Rapid-rise yeast''' is a variety of dried yeast (usually a form of instant yeast) that is of a smaller granular size, thus it dissolves faster in dough, and it provides greater carbon dioxide output to allow faster rising.&lt;ref name="isbn0-07-048703-0"&gt;{{cite book |author=Kay Pastorius |title=Cruising Cuisine: Fresh Food from the Galley |publisher=International Marine/Ragged Mountain Press |location= |year=1997 |page=184 |isbn=0-07-048703-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is considerable debate as to the value of such a product; while most baking experts believe it reduces the flavor potential of the finished product, ''[[Cook's Illustrated]]'' magazine, among others, feels that, at least for direct-rise recipes, it makes little difference. Rapid-rise yeast is often marketed specifically for use in [[bread machine]]s.
*'''Deactivated yeast''' is dead yeast which has no leavening value and is not interchangeable with other yeast types. Typically used for pizza and pan bread doughs, it is used at a rate of 0.1% of the flour weight, though manufacturer specifications may vary. It is a powerful reducing agent used to increase the extensibility of a dough.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sfbi.com/pdfs/NewsF03.pdf |title=San Francisco Baking Institute Newsletter |format=pdf |year=2003 |accessdate=2015-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For most commercial uses, yeast of any form is packaged in bulk (blocks or freezer bags for fresh yeast; vacuum-packed brick bags for dry or instant); however, yeast for home use is often packaged in pre-measured doses, either small squares for compressed yeast or sealed packets for dry or instant. For active dry and instant yeast, in general a single dose (reckoned for the average bread recipe of between 500 g and 1000 g of dough) is about 2.5 [[teaspoon|tsp]] (~12 mL) or about {{convert|7|g|oz|frac=4|abbr=on}}, though comparatively lesser amounts are used when the yeast is used in a [[pre-ferment]]. In general, a yeast flavor in the baked bread is not noticeable when the [[baker percentage|bakers' percent]] of added yeast is less than 2.5%.&lt;ref name="p475isbn1-85573-553-9"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f3Ua43ujjUoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=isbn:1855735539&amp;pg=475#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |author=Cauvain, Stanley P. |title=Bread making: improving quality |publisher=CRC Press |location=Boca Raton |year=2003 |page=475 |isbn=1-85573-553-9 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in research==

===Model organism===
Because it is readily available and easy to culture, baker's yeast has long been used in chemical, biological, and genetic research as a [[model organism]]. In 1996, after 6 years of work, ''S. cerevisiae'' became the first [[eukaryote]] to have its entire [[genome]] [[Full genome sequencing|sequenced]]. It has over 12 million [[base pair]]s and around 6000 [[gene]]s. Since then, it has remained in the forefront of genetic research. For example, most of our knowledge of the [[cell division cycle]] was worked out from experiments with yeast.

===Organic synthesis===
[[File:BY-reduction of carbonyls.svg|thumb|Reduction of a carbonyl to a hydroxyl with baker's yeast.]]
Baker's yeast contains [[enzyme]]s that can [[reducing agent|reduce]] a [[carbonyl]] group into a [[hydroxyl]] group in fairly high yield, thus making it useful for [[biotransformation]]s in [[organic synthesis|organic syntheses]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Csuk|first=Rene.|last2=Glaenzer|first2=Brigitte I.|date=1991-01-01|title=Baker's yeast mediated transformations in organic chemistry|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/cr00001a004|journal=Chemical Reviews|volume=91|issue=1|pages=49–97|doi=10.1021/cr00001a004|issn=0009-2665}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is known to reduce [[organometallic]] carbonyl compounds in very high yield.&lt;ref name=Handbookofreagents&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Paquette|first1=Leo A.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xxYjJgupBSMC&amp;pg=PA45&amp;lpg=PA45#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |title=Handbook of Reagents for Organic Synthesis: Chiral Reagents for Asymmetric Synthesis|publisher=Wiley |location=New York |year=1999|page=45|edition=1st|isbn=9780470856253}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baker's yeast can also be used to produce [[ethanol]] via [[Brewing#Fermenting|fermentation]] for use in chemical synthesis, although doing so in some places requires permits.

== Industrial production ==
The baking industry relies on industrial production of its ingredients, including baking yeasts. Much effort has been put into developing and marketing yeasts that will perform reliably in mass production. Since the end of the nineteenth century, baker's yeast has been produced by companies that specialize in its production.

The main ingredients for industrial production are yeast cultures, [[Sugarcane|cane]] and [[beet]]; but a number of minerals, nitrogen and vitamins are also needed.&lt;ref name=EFIG&gt;{{cite publication|url=https://www3.epa.gov/ttnchie1/ap42/ch09/final/c9s13-4.pdf|title=9.13.4 Yeast Production|author=EFIG|publisher=EPA|date=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fermentation happens in several phases, which vary depending on the manufacturer:&lt;ref name=EFIG/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lallemand.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Prod-Proc-11.pdf|title=Lallemand production process|date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* pure cultures in a laboratory flask for 2 to 4 days, then batch fermentations for 13 to 24 hours (anaerobic);
* intermediate and stock fermentation with gradual feeding and constant aeration;
* pitch and trade fermentation with large air supplies for up to 15 hours;
* filtration, blending, extrusion and cutting, drying.
The yeast grows from hundreds kg in the intermediate and stock fermentor to tens of thousands kg in the trade fermentor, where most yeast is produced.&lt;ref name=EFIG/&gt; The earlier stages produce more ethanol and other alcohols, while in the final stages ethanol production is suppressed up to 95 % by controlling the amount of oxygen and sugar, in order to increase the yeast production instead.&lt;ref name=EFIG/&gt;

The industry is highly concentrated, with 5 companies holding up to 80 % of the worldwide market for dry yeast as of 2006. While dry yeast is exported over long distances and mostly sold in the developing countries, industrial customers often prefer to supply fresh yeast from local facilities, with a single wholesaler having up to 90 % of liquid yeast market in UK in 2006.&lt;ref name=LesaffreEC&gt;{{cite publication|url=http://ec.europa.eu/competition/mergers/cases/decisions/m5020_20080711_20212_en.pdf|title= Case No COMP/M.5020 - LESAFFRE / GBI UK|author= European Commission|date=2008-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In USA companies like [[Lesaffre|Lesaffre Group]], AB Vista, [[DSM (company)|DSM]], GB Plange and [[AB Mauri]], produced hundreds of thousands of metric tons of yeast in 2012.

A '''bolometer''' is a device for measuring the power of incident [[electromagnetic radiation]] via the heating of a material with a temperature-dependent [[electrical resistance]]. It was invented in 1878 by the American astronomer [[Samuel Pierpont Langley]].&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bolometers bolometers – Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Principle of operation ==
[[File:Bolometer conceptual schematic.svg|thumb|alt=Conceptual schematic of a bolometer.|'''Conceptual schematic of a bolometer'''. Power, ''P'', from an incident signal is absorbed by the bolometer and heats up a thermal mass with [[heat capacity]], ''C'', and temperature, ''T''. The thermal mass is connected to a reservoir of constant temperature through a link with [[thermal conductivity|thermal conductance]], ''G''. The temperature increase is Δ''T'' = ''P''/''G''. The change in temperature is read out with a resistive thermometer. The intrinsic thermal time constant is τ = ''C''/''G''.]]

A bolometer consists of an absorptive element, such as a thin layer of metal, connected to a thermal reservoir (a body of constant temperature) through a thermal link. The result is that any radiation impinging on the absorptive element raises its temperature above that of the reservoir – the greater the absorbed power, the higher the temperature. The intrinsic thermal time constant, which sets the speed of the detector, is equal to the ratio of the [[heat capacity]] of the absorptive element to the [[thermal conductivity|thermal conductance]] between the absorptive element and the reservoir.&lt;ref name=Richards&gt;P. L. Richards, "Bolometers for infrared and millimeter waves," ''Journal of Applied Physics'' '''76''', 1–36 (1994), {{doi|10.1063/1.357128}}&lt;/ref&gt; The temperature change can be measured directly with an attached resistive [[thermometer]], or the resistance of the absorptive element itself can be used as a thermometer. Metal bolometers usually work without cooling. They are produced from thin foils or metal films. Today, most bolometers use [[semiconductor]] or [[superconductor]] absorptive elements rather than metals. These devices can be operated at [[Cryogenic particle detectors|cryogenic]] temperatures, enabling significantly greater sensitivity.

Bolometers are directly sensitive to the energy left inside the absorber.  For this reason they can be used not only for ionizing particles and [[photon]]s, but also for non-ionizing particles, any sort of [[radiation]], and even to search for unknown forms of mass or energy (like [[dark matter]]); this lack of discrimination can also be a shortcoming. The most sensitive bolometers are very slow to reset (i.e., return to thermal equilibrium with the environment). On the other hand, compared to more conventional particle detectors, they are extremely efficient in energy resolution and in sensitivity. They are also known as thermal detectors.

== Langley's bolometer ==

The first bolometer used by Langley consisted of two [[platinum]] strips covered with [[lampblack]]. One strip was shielded from radiation and one exposed to it. The strips formed two branches of a [[Wheatstone bridge]] which was fitted with a sensitive [[galvanometer]] and connected to a battery. Electromagnetic radiation falling on the exposed strip would heat it and change its resistance. By 1880, Langley's bolometer was refined enough to detect thermal radiation from a cow a quarter of a mile away.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hao.ucar.edu/education/bios/langley.php Samuel P. Langley Biography]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091106184818/http://www.hao.ucar.edu/education/bios/langley.php |date=2009-11-06 }} High Altitude Observatory, University Corporation for Atmospheric Research&lt;/ref&gt; This radiant-heat detector is sensitive to differences in temperature of one hundred-thousandth of a degree Celsius (0.00001 C).&lt;ref&gt;[http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/Langley/langley_2.php NASA Earth Observatory]&lt;/ref&gt; This instrument enabled him to thermally detect across a broad spectrum, noting all the chief [[Fraunhofer line]]s. He also discovered new atomic and molecular absorption lines in the invisible [[infrared]] portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. [[Nikola Tesla]] personally asked Dr. Langley if he could use his bolometer for his power transmission experiments in 1892. Thanks to that first use, he succeeded in making the first demonstration between West Point and his laboratory on Houston Street.&lt;ref&gt;

 | quote=I suppose I had hundreds of devices, but the first device that I used, and it was very successful, was an improvement on the bolometer. I met Professor Langley in 1892 at the Royal Institution. He said to me, after I had delivered a lecture, that they were all proud of me. I spoke to him of the bolometer, and remarked that it was a beautiful instrument. I then said, "Professor Langley, I have a suggestion for making an improvement in the bolometer, if you will embody it in the principle." I explained to him how the bolometer could be improved. Professor Langley was very much interested and wrote in his notebook what I suggested. I used what I have termed a small-mass resistance, but of much smaller mass than in the bolometer of Langley, and of much smaller mass than that of any of the devices which have been recorded in patents issued since. Those are clumsy things. I used masses that were not a millionth of the smallest mass described in any of the patents, or in the publications. With such an instrument, I operated, for instance, in West Point—I received signals from my laboratory on Houston Street in West Point.
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications in astronomy ==

While bolometers can be used to measure radiation of any frequency, for most [[wavelength]] ranges there are other methods of detection that are more sensitive. For [[submillimeter astronomy|sub-millimeter wavelengths]] (from around 200&amp;nbsp;µm to 1&amp;nbsp;mm wavelength, also known as the far-[[infrared]] or [[Terahertz radiation|terahertz]]), bolometers are among the most sensitive available detectors, and are therefore used for [[astronomy]] at these wavelengths. To achieve the best sensitivity, they must be cooled to a fraction of a degree above [[absolute zero]] (typically from 50&amp;nbsp;[[kelvin|millikelvins]] to 300&amp;nbsp;mK). Notable examples of bolometers employed in submillimeter astronomy include the [[Herschel Space Observatory]], the [[James Clerk Maxwell Telescope]], and the [[Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy]] (SOFIA).

== Applications in particle physics ==

The term bolometer is also used in [[particle physics]] to designate an unconventional [[particle detector]]. They use the same principle described above. The bolometers are sensitive not only to light but to every form of energy.
The operating principle is similar to that of a [[calorimeter]] in [[thermodynamics]]. However, the approximations, [[cryogenics|ultra low temperature]], and the different purpose of the device make the operational use rather different. In the [[jargon]] of high energy physics, these devices are not called calorimeters since this term is already used for a different type of detector (see [[Calorimeter (particle physics)|Calorimeter]]). Their use as particle detectors was proposed from the beginning of the 20th century, but the first regular, though pioneering, use was only in the 1980s because of the difficulty associated with cooling and operating a system at [[cryogenic|cryogenic temperature]]. They can still be considered to be at the developmental stage.

==Microbolometers==
{{main|Microbolometer}}

A [[microbolometer]] is a specific type of bolometer used as a detector in a [[thermal camera]]. It is a grid of [[vanadium(V) oxide|vanadium oxide]] or [[amorphous silicon]] heat sensors atop a corresponding grid of [[silicon]]. [[Infrared]] [[radiation]] from a specific range of [[wavelength]]s strikes the vanadium oxide or amorphous silicon, and changes its [[electrical resistance]]. This resistance change is measured and processed into temperatures which can be represented graphically. The microbolometer grid is commonly found in three sizes, a 640×480 array, a 320×240 array (384×288 amorphous silicon) or less expensive 160×120 array. Different arrays provide the same resolution with larger array providing a wider [[field of view]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} Larger, 1024×768 arrays were announced in 2008.

==Hot electron bolometer==
The hot electron bolometer (HEB) operates at [[cryogenic]] temperatures, typically within a few degrees of [[absolute zero]]. At these very low temperatures, the [[electron]] system in a metal is weakly coupled to the [[phonon]] system. Power coupled to the electron system drives it out of thermal equilibrium with the phonon system, creating hot electrons.&lt;ref&gt;F.C. Wellstood, C. Urbina and J. Clarke, "Hot-electron effects in metals," ''Physical Review B'' '''49''', 5942–5955 (1994), {{doi|10.1103/PhysRevB.49.5942}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phonons in the metal are typically well-coupled to substrate phonons and act as a thermal reservoir. In describing the performance of the HEB, the relevant [[heat capacity]] is the electronic heat capacity and the relevant [[thermal conductivity|thermal conductance]] is the electron-phonon thermal conductance.

If the [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] of the absorbing element depends on the electron temperature, then the resistance can be used as a thermometer of the electron system. This is the case for both [[Semiconductor|semiconducting]] and [[Superconductor|superconducting]] materials at low temperature. If the absorbing element does not have a temperature-dependent resistance, as is typical of normal (non-superconducting) metals at very low temperature, then an attached resistive thermometer can be used to measure the electron temperature.&lt;ref name=Richards/&gt;

==Microwave measurement==
A bolometer can be used to measure power at [[microwave]] frequencies. In this application, a resistive element is exposed to microwave power. A dc bias current is applied to the resistor to raise its temperature via [[Joule heating]], such that the resistance is [[Impedance matching|matched]] to the waveguide characteristic impedance. After applying microwave power, the bias current is reduced to return the bolometer to its resistance in the absence of microwave power. The change in the dc power is then equal to the absorbed microwave power. To reject the effect of ambient temperature changes, the active (measuring) element is in a [[Wheatstone bridge|bridge circuit]] with an identical element not exposed to microwaves; variations in temperature common to both elements do not affect the accuracy of the reading. The average response time of the bolometer allows convenient measurement of the power of a pulsed source.&lt;ref&gt;Kai Chang (ed), ''Encyclopedia of RF and Microwave Engineering'', (Wiley 2005) {{ISBN|0-471-27053-9}} pages 2736–2739&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''brushcutter''' (also called a '''brushsaw''' or '''clearing saw''') is a powered [[garden tool|garden]] or agricultural tool used to trim weeds, small trees, and other foliage not accessible by a [[lawn mower]] or [[rotary mower]]. Various blades or trimmer heads can be attached to the machine for specific applications.

It consists of:
* A power unit held close to the body.
* A pole through which the power is transmitted.
* A rotary cutting head at the opposite end of the pole to the power unit.

==Power units==
There are three main types of power unit:
* [[Small engine|Gas engines]], either two or four stroke, are used on the more powerful units.
* Electric motors connected to [[mains power]] by a power cord.
* Cordless electric motors powered by rechargeable batteries.

==Shaft==
There are three types of shaft:
* Basic consumer units use a curved shaft, similar to a basic [[line trimmer]].
* More professional units use a straight shaft with a gearbox at the cutting head end.
* Top of the line units use a straight "split" shaft with a disconnection point partway along the shaft, allowing the cutting head to be replaced by other accessories such as [[pole pruner]]s, [[cultivator]]s, [[edger]]s and [[hedge trimmer]]s.

[[File:Stihl FS350.jpg|thumb|centre|400px|Bike handlebar style brushcutter ready for transport. To use, the handlebars are rotated and the red blade guard removed.]]

Handles vary on brush cutters depending on weight and size of the unit. Larger, more powerful saws employ bike handles (two handlebars on either side of the shaft), and smaller units use a D-shaped handle mounted on the shaft. Heavier saws usually require harnesses for safety and reduced fatigue. The shaft on units requiring a harness has multiple slots for the harness to attach for balance of the entire unit.

==Cutting head==

Cutting heads include circular saw blades (chisel tooth or scratcher tooth), brush knives, grass blades, etc. Most brushcutters also allow other heads to be fitted, including bump feed and fixed line heads such as those used on [[line trimmer]]s or modified saw blades such as a beaver blade which resembles a [[chainsaw]]. Deflectors are attached on the cutting side of the machine to prevent injury to the operator from debris thrown by the cutting head.

Plastic or metal flails can be used for cutting stems too large for a line head but not requiring a blade. Following an incident in the UK in which when a metal chain link thrown from an [[Aftermarket (automotive)|aftermarket]] flail killed a bystander, all flail heads are now banned in the EU.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/safetybulletins/brush-cutters.htm|title=Use of chain flail/non standard cutting attachments on brush cutters|website=www.hse.gov.uk|access-date=2016-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cumbria-17346121|title=Anthony Robinson death: Firm fined over strimmer accident|publisher=BBC News|access-date=2016-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Butterfield dial''' is a portable [[horizontal sundial]] designed to be folded flat and used in latitudes between 35° and 60°. A Butterfield dial was named after the English [[gnomonist]], '''Michael Butterfield''' who was active in Paris around 1690.

==Description==
They were constructed with a hinged gnomon, whose angle could be adjusted for the [[latitude]]; the latitude was indicated by the beak of a bird. The gnomon was held in place by a rivet which was displayed by the birds eye, and thumbscrew. 
The dial plate would have three [[London dial#Definitions|chapter ring]]s for 44°, 48° and 52° which would be sufficiently accurate to be used between 35° and 60° (roughly between [[Gibraltar]] to the [[Shetland Isles]]). There would also be a [[magnetic compass|compass]] and a [[plumb bob]].

==Michael Butterfield==
Michael Butterfield (1635-1724) was a British clockmaker who moved to Paris about 1663. He worked at the royal court was appointed engineer to the [[King Louis XIV]]. He opened a shop selling precision instruments in 1677 in rue Neuve-des-Fossés, in [[Saint-Germain-des-Prés|Saint-Germain]]. He sold all types of sundial, but dominated the market for the small travelling dial with the adjustable gnomonwith bird motif and three chapter rings. This type of dial became fashionable and called the Butterfield dial. This type of dial was known before Butterfield manufactured them, for instance Roch Blondeau and Timothee Collet, and other instrument makers in Paris and beyond, continued to make them particularly after his death. Among his international clients was the Russian Czar Peter the Great who visited his shop in 1717 and ordered a great quantity of gilt copper dials.&lt;ref name=Donzey&gt;{{cite web |last1=Donzey |first1=Jean-Patrick |title=Compass Museum - Sundial compasses |url=http://compassmuseum.com/sundials/sundials.htm |website=compassmuseum.com |accessdate=6 September 2018 |language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other manufacturers==
Nicolas Bion (1652-1735), in his 1709 book, *[[The Construction and Principal Uses of Mathematical Instruments]] on page 322 and plate 26, gives a clear description of the construction and usage of such dials.
&lt;ref&gt;[https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k857654v.image Traité de la construction et des principaux usages des instrumens des mathématique, Nicolas Bion, 1709, Paris].&lt;/ref&gt; He had premises in  Quai de l'Horloge du Palais, Paris. Examples of his Butterfield style dials occur in auction house catalogues and have been reproduced as museum momentos.&lt;ref name=Donzey/&gt;

{{Modulation techniques}}
'''Constellation shaping''' is an energy efficiency enhancement scheme for [[digital data|digital]] signal [[modulation]] that improves upon the [[amplitude and phase-shift keying]] (APSK) and the conventional [[quadrature amplitude modulation]] (QAM)) modulation schemes by transmitting low-energy signals more frequently than high-energy ones.

"Constellation" is a pattern of the possible signal combinations; in a static constellation, all of the combinations are used equally. In the real world, however, the transmission media (channel) distorts the signal unevenly; some combinations require lower energy and resist channel noise more than others.

A "shaped constellation" transmission sends some signal combinations more often and others less frequently to optimize the signal quality at the destination or to maintain the same quality using less transmission energy.

== Probabilistic constellation shaping ==
Probabilistic (and adaptive) constellation shaping changes the shaping parameters based on predefined terms. This allows a significant capacity increase (e.g. 15–43% on 16-QAM channel). This technique gathered more interest in September 2016 when [[Nokia Bell Labs]] demonstrated  working 1&amp;nbsp;[[Data rate units#Terabit per second|Tbit/s]] data transmission channels between German cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tum.de/en/about-tum/news/press-releases/short/article/33398/ |title=Optical fiber transmits one terabit per second |publisher=Technical University of Munich |date=2016-09-16 |accessdate=2016-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2016, Alcatel-Lucent and Nokia Bell Labs claimed to have achieved 65&amp;nbsp;Tbit/s transmission over a 6,600&amp;nbsp;km (4,100&amp;nbsp;mile) single mode fiber in laboratory trials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newatlas.com/record-fiber-optic-transmission-alcatel-nokia/45889 |title=Nokia's super-fast subsea data cable torpedos the competition |last=Jeffrey |first=Colin |date=October 13, 2016 |website=newatlas.com|publisher= |access-date=2016-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''current conveyor''' is an abstraction for a three terminal [[Analogue electronics|analogue]] [[electronic device]]. It is a form of [[electronic amplifier]] with unity [[Gain (electronics)|gain]]. There are three versions of generations of the [[Idealization (science philosophy)|idealised]] device, CCI, CCII and CCIII.&lt;ref name="Beevao"&gt;{{cite web|last=Beèváø |first=Daniel |title=Novel Generations of Inverting Current Conveyor Using Universal Current Conveyor |url=http://technologyinterface.nmsu.edu/3_4/3_4f.html |publisher=The Technology Interface |accessdate=3 July 2012 |author2=Kamil Vrba |pages=Vol 3, No 4 |year=2000 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828192504/http://technologyinterface.nmsu.edu/3_4/3_4f.html |archivedate=28 August 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; When configured with other circuit elements, real current conveyors can perform many analogue [[signal processing]] functions, in a similar manner to the way [[op-amp]]s and the ideal concept of the op-amp are used.&lt;ref name="Sedra1990"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sedra |first1=Adel |title=Current Conveyor Theory and Practice |url=http://www.ece.mcgill.ca/~grober4/ROBERTS/PUBLICATIONS/BOOK_CHAPTERS/Current_Conveyor_90.html |work=Advances in Analog Integrated Circuit Design, C.

==History==
When [[Adel_Sedra|Sedra]] and [[Kenneth_C._Smith|Smith]] first introduced the current conveyor in 1968,&lt;ref name="Beevao"/&gt; it was not clear what the benefits of the concept would be. The idea of the op-amp had been well known since the 1940s and [[integrated circuit]] manufacturers were better able to capitalise on this widespread knowledge within the [[electronics industry]]. Monolithic current conveyor implementations were not introduced and the op-amp became widely implemented.&lt;ref name="Sedra1990"/&gt; Since the early 2000s, implementations of the current conveyor concept, especially within larger [[VLSI]] projects such as mobile phones, have proved worthwhile.&lt;ref name="Michal"&gt;{{cite web|last=Michal|first=Vratislav|title=Single Active Element PID Controllers|url=http://www.postreh.com/vmichal/papers/PID-Radio.pdf|accessdate=3 July 2012|author2=Christophe PRÉMONT |author3=Gaël PILLONNET |author4=Nacer ABOUCHI }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advantages ==
Current conveyors can provide better [[gain-bandwidth product]]s than comparable op-amps, under both [[Small-signal model|small]] and [[Large-signal model|large signal]] conditions. In [[instrumentation amplifier]]s, their gain does not depend on the matching of pairs of external components, only on the absolute value of a single circuit element.&lt;ref name="Sedra1990"/&gt;

== First generation (CCI) ==
The CCI is a three-terminal device with the [[Terminal (electronics)|terminals]] designated ''X'', ''Y'', and ''Z''. The potential at ''X'' equals whatever voltage is applied to ''Y''. Whatever current flows into ''Y'' also flows into ''X'', and is mirrored at ''Z'' with a high [[output impedance]], as a variable [[Current source|constant current source]]. In sub-type CCI+, current into ''Y'' produces current into ''Z''; in a CCI-, current into ''Y'' results in an equivalent current flowing ''out'' of ''Z''.&lt;ref name="Sedra1990"/&gt;

== Second generation (CCII) ==
In a more versatile later design, no current flows through terminal ''Y''. The ideal CCII can be seen as an ideal transistor, with perfected characteristics. No current flows into the [[Field-effect transistor|gate]] or [[Transistor|base]] which is represented by ''Y''. There is no base-emitter or gate-source voltage drop, so the emitter or source voltage (at ''X'') follows the voltage at ''Y''. The gate or base has an infinite input impedance (''Y''), while the emitter or source has a zero input impedance (''X''). Any current out of the emitter or source (''X'') is reflected at the collector or drain (''Z'') as a current in, but with an [[Current source|infinite output impedance]]. Because of this reversal of sense between ''X'' and ''Z'' currents, this ideal bipolar or field-effect transistor represents a CCII−. If current flowing out of ''X'' resulted in the same high-impedance current flowing ''out'' of ''Z'', it would be a CCII+.&lt;ref name="Sedra1990"/&gt;

== Third generation (CCIII) ==
The third configuration of the current conveyor is similar to the CCI except that the current in ''X'' is reversed, so in a CCIII whatever current flows into ''Y'' also flows out of ''X''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Koli|first=Kimmo|title=Cmos Current Amplifiers: Speed Versus Nonlinearity|year=2002|publisher=Springer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZW9n83RnOOEC|author2=Kari A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4146">:''Not to be confused with [[Data-driven design]].''
In [[computing]], '''data-oriented design''' is a [[program optimization]] approach motivated by [[cache coherency]], used in [[video game]] development (usually in the programming languages [[C (programming language)|C]] or [[C++]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Data-oriented design|url=http://www.dice.se/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Introduction_to_Data-Oriented_Design.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The approach is to focus on the data layout, separating and sorting [[field (computing)|fields]] according to when they are needed, and to think about transformations of data. Proponents include Mike Acton&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CppCon 2014: Mike Acton "Data-Oriented Design and C++"|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rX0ItVEVjHc}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Scott Meyers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=code::dive conference 2014 - Scott Meyers: Cpu Caches and Why You Care|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDIkqP4JbkE}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

== Motives ==
These methods became especially popular during the [[seventh generation of video game consoles]] that included [[PlayStation 3]] (PS3) and [[Xbox 360]], when the hazards of [[cache misses]] became especially pronounced, due to their use of [[in-order processor]]s with high clock speeds and deep [[Pipeline (computing)|pipelines]] (some of the software issues were similar to those encountered on the [[Itanium]], requiring [[loop unrolling]] for upfront scheduling). In modern systems (even with [[out of order execution]]), [[main memory]] is as many as hundreds of [[clock cycle]]s away from the [[processing element]]s; consequently [[locality of reference]] issues dominate performance, requiring improvement of [[memory access pattern]]s to fix. [[Game console]]s often have relatively weak [[central processing unit]]s (CPUs) to devote more power and [[transistor budget]] to the [[graphics processing unit]]s (GPUs). Thus, it is critical that CPU side code is efficient to avoid [[Von Neumann architecture#Von Neumann bottleneck|Von Neumann bottlenecking]].

== Contrast with object-orientation ==
The claim is that traditional [[object-oriented programming]] (OOP) design principles result in poor data locality, more so if runtime polymorphism ([[dynamic dispatch]]) is used (which is especially problematic on some processors&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What's wrong with Object-Oriented Design? Where's the harm in it?|url=http://www.dataorienteddesign.com/dodmain/node17.html}}describes the problems with virtual function calls, e.g., i-cache misses&lt;/ref&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Data-oriented design - why you might be shooting yourself in the foot with OOP|url=http://gamesfromwithin.com/data-oriented-design}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although OOP does superficially seem to ''organise code around data'', the practice is quite different. OOP is actually about organising [[source code]] around [[data type]]s, rather than physically grouping individual fields and arrays in a format efficient for access by specific functions. It also often hides layout details under [[abstraction layer]]s, while a data-oriented programmer wants to consider this first and foremost.

== Other languages ==
The experimental programming language [[Jonathan Blow#JAI language|JAI]] being developed by [[Jonathan Blow]] has explicit support for data-oriented design, while eschewing the traditional OOP paradigm. This is facilitated by being able to transparently move fields between [[Record (computer science)|records]] without extensive source code changes to functions using them (or without extensive [[boilerplate code]] to enable this), and by adding direct support for ''[[AOS and SOA#Structure of arrays|structure of arrays]]'' (SoA) data layout.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Data-oriented demo:SOA,composition|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHqFrNyLlpA}}Demonstration of data-oriented and SOA features in the JAI language, also explaining the motives.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10443">In [[Very-large-scale integration|VLSI]] [[semiconductor]] manufacturing, the process of '''Design Closure''' is a part of the development workflow by which an [[integrated circuit]] design is modified from its initial description to meet a growing list of design constraints and objectives.

Every step in the IC design (such as [[static timing analysis]], [[Placement (EDA)|placement]], [[Routing (EDA)|routing]], and so on) is already complex and often forms its own field of study.  This article, however, looks at the overall design closure process, which takes a chip from its initial design state to the final form in which all of its design constraints are met.

== Introduction ==
Every chip starts off as someone’s idea of a good thing: "If we can make a part that performs function X, we will all be rich!" Once the concept is established, someone from marketing says "To make this chip profitably, it must cost $C and run at frequency F." Someone from manufacturing says "To meet this chip’s targets, it must have a yield of Y%." Someone from packaging says “It must fit in the P package and dissipate no more than W watts.” Eventually, the team generates an extensive list of all the constraints and objectives they must meet to manufacture a product that can be sold profitably. The management then forms a design team, which consists of chip architects, logic designers, functional verification engineers, physical designers, and timing engineers, and assigns them to create a chip to the specifications.

=== Constraints vs Objectives ===
The distinction between constraints and objectives is straightforward: a constraint is a design target that must be met for the design to be successful.&lt;ref&gt;Ralph, P., and Wand, Y. A Proposal for a Formal Definition of the Design Concept. In, Lyytinen, K., Loucopoulos, P., [[John Mylopoulos|Mylopoulos, J.]], and Robinson, W., (eds.), Design Requirements Engineering: A Ten-Year Perspective: Springer-Verlag, 2009, pp. 103-136&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a chip may be required to run at a specific frequency so it can interface with other components in a system. In contrast, an objective is a design target where more
(or less) is better. For example, yield is generally an objective, which is maximized to lower manufacturing cost. For the purposes of design closure, the distinction between constraints and objectives is not important; this article uses the words interchangeably.

== Evolution of the Design Closure Flow ==
Designing a chip used to be a much simpler task. In the early days of VLSI, a chip consisted of a few thousand logic circuits that performed a simple function at speeds of a few MHz. Design closure was simple: if all of the necessary circuits and wires "fit", the chip would perform the desired function.

Modern design closure has grown orders of magnitude more complex. Modern logic chips can have tens to hundreds of millions of logic elements switching at speeds of several
GHz. This improvement has been driven by [[Moore’s law]] of scaling of technology, and has introduced many new design considerations. As a result, a modern VLSI designer must consider the performance of a chip against a list of dozens of design constraints and objectives including performance, power, [[signal integrity]], reliability, and yield.  In response to this growing list of constraints, the design closure flow has evolved from a simple linear list of tasks to a very complex, highly iterative flow such as the following simplified ASIC design flow:

== Reference ASIC Design Flow ==
*Concept phase: Functional objectives and architecture of a chip are developed.
*Logic design: Architecture is implemented in a register transfer level (RTL) language, then simulated to verify that it performs the desired functions. This includes [[functional verification]].
*Floorplanning: The RTL of the chip is assigned to gross regions of the chip, input/output (I/O) pins are assigned and large objects (arrays, cores, etc.) are placed.
*[[Logic synthesis]]:  The RTL is mapped into a gate-level netlist in the target technology of the chip.
*[[Design for Testability]]: The test structures like scan chains are inserted.
*[[Placement (EDA)|Placement]]:  The gates in the netlist are assigned to nonoverlapping locations on the chip.
*Logic/placement refinement: Iterative logical and placement transformations to close performance and power constraints.
*[[Clock Distribution Networks|Clock insertion]]: Balanced buffered clock trees are introduced into the design.
*[[Routing (EDA)|Routing]]: The wires that connect the gates in the netlist are added.
*Postwiring optimization:  Remaining performance, noise, and yield violations are removed.
*[[Design for manufacturability (IC)|Design for manufacturability]]: The design is modified, where possible, to make it as easy as possible to produce.
*[[Signoff (EDA)|Signoff checks]]: Since errors are expensive, time consuming and hard to spot, extensive error checking is the rule, [[Formal equivalence checking|making sure the mapping to logic was done correctly]], and [[Design rule checking|checking that the manufacturing rules were followed faithfully]].
*[[Tape-out|Tapeout]] and mask generation: the design data is turned into [[photomask]]s in [[mask data preparation]].

== Evolution of design constraints ==
The purpose of the flow is to take a design from concept phase to working chip. The complexity of the flow is a direct result of the addition and evolution of the list of design closure constraints. To understand this evolution it is important to understand the life cycle of a design constraint. In general, design constraints influence the design flow via the following five-stage evolution:
*Early warnings: Before chip issues begin occurring, academics and industry visionaries make dire predictions about the future impact of some new technology effect.
*Hardware problems: Sporadic hardware failures start showing up in the field due to the new effect. Postmanufacturing redesign and hardware re-spins are required to get the chip to function.
*Trial and error: Constraints on the effect are formulated and used to drive postdesign checking. Violations of the constraint are fixed manually.
*Find and repair: Large number of violations of the constraint drives the creation of automatic postdesign analysis and repair flows.
*Predict and prevent: Constraint checking moves earlier in the flow using predictive estimations of the effect. These drive optimizations to prevent violations of the constraint.

A good example of this evolution can be found in the [[signal integrity]] constraint. In the mid-1990s (180&amp;nbsp;nm
node), industry visionaries were describing the impending dangers of coupling noise long before chips were
failing. By the mid-late 1990s, noise problems were cropping up in advanced microprocessor designs.
By 2000, automated noise analysis tools were available and were used to guide manual fix-up. The total
number of noise problems identified by the analysis tools identified by the flow quickly became too many
to correct manually. In response, CAD companies developed the noise avoidance flows that are currently in
use in the industry.

At any point in time, the constraints in the design flow are at different stages of their life cycle. At the
time of this writing, for example, performance optimization is the most mature and is well into the fifth
phase with the widespread use of timing-driven design flows. Power- and defect-oriented yield optimization
is well into the fourth phase; power supply integrity, a type of noise constraint, is in the third phase;
circuit-limited yield optimization is in the second phase, etc. A list of the first-phase impending constraint
crises can always be found in the [[International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors]] (ITRS) 15-year-outlook technology roadmaps.

As a constraint matures in the design flow, it tends to work its way from the end of the flow to the beginning.
As it does this, it also tends to increase in complexity and in the degree that it contends with other constraints.
Constraints tend to move up in the flow due to one of the basic paradoxes of design: accuracy vs.
influence. Specifically, the earlier in a design flow a constraint is addressed, the more flexibility there is to
address the constraint. Ironically, the earlier one is in a design flow, the more difficult it is to predict compliance.
For example, an architectural decision to pipeline a logic function can have a far greater impact on
total chip performance than any amount of postrouting fix-up. At the same time, accurately predicting the
performance impact of such a change before the chip logic is synthesized, let alone placed or routed, is very
difficult. This paradox has shaped the evolution of the design closure flow in several ways. First, it requires
that the design flow is no longer composed of a linear set of discrete steps. In the early stages of VLSI it was
sufficient to break the design into discrete stages, i.e., first do logic synthesis, then do placement, then do
routing. As the number and complexity of design closure constraints has increased, the linear design flow
has broken down. In the past if there were too many timing constraint violations left after routing, it was
necessary to loop back, modify the tool settings slightly, and reexecute the previous placement steps. If the
constraints were still not met, it was necessary to reach further back in the flow and modify the chip logic
and repeat the synthesis and placement steps. This type of looping is both time consuming and unable to
guarantee convergence i.e., it is possible to loop back in the flow to correct one constraint violation only to
find that the correction induced another unrelated violation.

A '''domed city''' is a hypothetical structure that encloses a large [[urban area]] under a single roof. In most descriptions, the dome is airtight and [[pressurized]], creating a habitat that can be controlled for air temperature, composition and quality, typically due to an external atmosphere (or lack thereof) that is inimical to habitation for one or more reasons. Domed cities have been a fixture of [[science fiction]] and [[futurology]] since the early 20th century, and may be situated on Earth, a moon or other planet.

==Origin==
It is not clear exactly when the concept of a domed city first appeared. The phrase "domed city" had come into use by the 19th century in a different sense, meaning a [[skyline]] with [[dome]]-topped buildings. One catalog of early science fiction mentions the 1881 [[socialism|socialist]] and [[white supremacist]] fantasy ''[[Three Hundred Years Hence (1881 novel)|Three Hundred Years Hence]]'' by British author [[William Delisle Hay]]. Hay's book describes a future civilization where most of humanity lives in glass-domed cities beneath the sea, allowing the surface of the earth to be used primarily for [[agriculture]]. Several examples from the early 20th century are also listed.&lt;ref name="bleiler"&gt;{{cite book|first=Everett F.|last=Bleiler|year=1990|title=Science Fiction: The Early Years}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In fiction==
Authors used domed cities in response to many problems, sometimes to the benefit of the people living in them and sometimes not. The problems of [[air pollution]] and other environmental destruction are a common motive, particularly in stories of the middle to late 20th century. As in the [[Pure (Baggott novel)|''Pure'' trilogy]] of books by [[Julianna Baggott]]. In some works, the domed city represents the last stand of a human race that is either dead or dying.&lt;ref name="yanarella"&gt;{{cite book|first=Ernest J.|last=Yanarella|year=2001|title=The Cross, the Plow and the Skyline}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1976 film ''[[Logan's Run (1976 film)|Logan's Run]]'' shows both of these themes. The characters have a comfortable life within a domed city, but the city also serves to control the populace and to ensure that humanity never again outgrows its means.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Myriam|last=Díaz-Diocaretz|year=2006|title=The Matrix in Theory and Practice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The domed city in fiction has been interpreted as a symbolic [[womb]] that both nourishes and protects humanity. Where other science fiction stories emphasize the vast expanse of the universe, the domed city places limits on its inhabitants, with the subtext that chaos will ensue if they interact with the world outside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Frederick A.|last=Kreuziger|year=1986|title=The Religion of Science Fiction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some works cities are getting "domed" to quarantine its inhabitants.

==Engineering proposals==
During the 1960s and 1970s, the domed city concept was widely discussed outside the confines of science fiction. In 1960, visionary engineer [[Buckminster Fuller]] described a 3&amp;nbsp;km [[geodesic dome]] spanning [[Midtown Manhattan]] that would regulate weather and reduce air pollution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/online/2008/06/09/slideshow_080609_fuller?slide=7#slide=7 Weird Science] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723013547/http://www.newyorker.com/online/2008/06/09/slideshow_080609_fuller?slide=7 |date=2011-07-23 }} The New Yorker on Fuller dome over Manhattan&lt;/ref&gt; A domed city was proposed in 1979 for [[Winooski, Vermont]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,912572,00.html|title=Environment: A Dome for Winooski?|date=10 December 1979|work=TIME.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2010 for [[Houston]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dsc.discovery.com/tv/mega-engineering/explore/houston-dome.html Discovery Channel: A Dome over Houston] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100722040300/http://dsc.discovery.com/tv/mega-engineering/explore/houston-dome.html |date=July 22, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to test whether an artificial [[closed ecological system]] was feasible, [[Biosphere 2]] (a complex of interconnected domes and glass pyramids) was constructed in the late 1980s. Its original experiment housed eight people and remains the largest such system attempted to date.

In 2010, a domed city known as Eco-city 2020 of 100,000 was proposed for the [[Mir mine]] in Siberia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2010-11/17/russia-domed-city-siberia |title=Russia plans domed city in Siberian mine |first=Duncan |last=Geere |date=17 November 2010 |work=[[Wired UK]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the [[Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum|ruler]] of [[Dubai]] announced plans for a climate-controlled domed city covering an area of 48 million square feet (4.5 square kilometers).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rt.com/news/172340-dubai-climate-controlled-city|title=World's first climate-controlled domed city to be built in Dubai (PHOTOS)|work=RT International}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Efaktura logo.png|right|thumb]]
'''eFaktura''' is a Norwegian [[electronic billing]] system issued by [[Nets Branch Norway AS]] (Nets). The system involves both business-to-customer (B2C) systems, branded as eFaktura, and [[business-to-business]] (B2B) branded as '''eFaktura B2B'''. The system is built upon the [[bankgiro]] system used for [[online banking]].

Use of eFaktura require the customer to use an online banking system from a Norwegian bank. Because all banks are connected to BBS, there is no discrimination between customers of different banks. Any company or organisation can sign an eFaktura agreement with their bank (though usually for a typically five-digit [[Norwegian krone|NOK]] startup fee) and send electronic bills to any client as long as they have a Norwegian online banking account. There is no requirement for the two to use the same bank. The ordinary eFaktura includes a specification of the bill, and the entire bill or [[invoice]] can be seen in the online banking system, and printed if so desired. eFaktura was launched in 2000.

For companies the eFaktura B2B has been developed. Companies using electronic billing need to be able to import the invoice directly into the [[accounting software]] of the company. Nets offers services to send out paper bills to any company not able to receive electronic billing. eFaktura B2B was launched in 2006.

{{Seriesbox aircraft propulsion}}

An '''electric aircraft''' is an aircraft powered by [[electric motor]]s. Electricity may be supplied by a variety of methods including [[electric battery|batteries]], ground [[power cable]]s, [[solar cell]]s, [[ultracapacitors]], [[fuel cell]]s and [[power beaming]].&lt;ref name="Power Beaming"&gt;[http://www.dfrc.nasa.gov/gallery/Photo/Power-Beaming/index.html Power Beaming] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130217082723/http://www.dfrc.nasa.gov/gallery/Photo/Power-Beaming/index.html |date=February 17, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Model aircraft#Electric power|Electrically powered model aircraft]] have been flown since the 1970s, with one unconfirmed report as early as 1957.&lt;ref name="Noth"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popsci.com/infographic-timeline-present-and-future-electric-flight|title=Infographic: A Timeline Of The Present And Future Of Electric Flight|author=|date=|work=Popular Science|accessdate=7 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have since developed into small battery-powered [[unmanned aerial vehicle]]s or drones, which in the twenty-first century have become widely used for many purposes.

Although manned flights in a tethered helicopter go back to 1917 and in airships to the previous century, the first manned free flight by an electrically powered aeroplane was not made until 1973 and most manned electric aircraft today are still only experimental demonstrators.&lt;ref name=JAWA74/&gt; Between 2015 and 2016, [[Solar Impulse 2]] completed a circumnavigation of the Earth.&lt;ref name=Batrawy/&gt;

==Design==
All electric aircraft to date have been powered by [[electric motor]]s driving thrust-generating [[propeller]]s or lift-generating [[rotorcraft|rotor]]s. Some of the propeller-driven types have been [[airship]]s.

Mechanisms for storing and supplying the necessary electricity vary considerably, and each has distinct advantages and disadvantages. Mechanisms used include:
*[[electric battery|Batteries]] can retain a significant electrical charge, although their weight still limits the range achievable.
*[[Power cable]]s connect to a ground-based supply.
*[[Solar cell]]s convert sunlight directly into electricity.
*[[Ultracapacitor]]s can store a limited amount of energy for short bursts of high-power use
*[[Fuel cell]]s are similar to batteries but draw their reactants from an external source.
*[[Microwave]] energy has been [[Power beaming|beamed]] from a ground-based source.

===Batteries===
[[Electric battery|Batteries]] are the most common [[energy carrier]] component of electric aircraft, due to their relatively high capacity. Batteries were the earliest source of electricity, first powering airships in the nineteenth century. These early batteries were very heavy and it was not until the arrival of technologies such as nickel-cadmium (NiCad) rechargeable types in the second half of the twentieth century, that batteries became a practicable power source. Modern battery types include lithium-based and a number of other less widely used technologies. Such batteries remain a popular power source today, although they still have limited life between charges and hence limited range.

Batteries are also often used for temporary storage of electricity generated by another source.

===Power cables===
An electrical [[power cable]] may be connected to a ground-based supply, such as an electric generator. At low altitudes this can avoid carrying heavy batteries and was used by the experimental [[Petróczy-Kármán-Žurovec|Petróczy-Kármán-Žurovec PKZ-1]] observation helicopter of 1917. However such a craft must remain tethered to a ground facility, and the higher it flies, the heavier the weight of cable it must lift with it.

===Solar cells===
A [[solar cell]] converts sunlight directly into electricity, either for direct power or temporary storage. The power output of solar cells is small, even when many are connected together, which limits their use and is also expensive. However their use of freely available sunlight makes them attractive for high-altitude, long-endurance applications.

For endurance flights, keeping the craft in the air all night typically requires a backup storage system, which supplies power during the hours of darkness and recharges during the day.

===Ultracapacitors===
An [[ultracapacitor]] can store a limited amount of energy for short bursts of high-power use, such as when taking off, but due to its relatively small storage ability it is not suitable as a primary power source. Its advantage over a small battery is the ability to charge and discharge much faster with higher peak currents.

===Fuel cells===
A [[fuel cell]] uses the reaction between two fluids such as [[hydrogen]] and [[oxygen]] to create electricity. Unlike a battery, the fluids are not stored in the battery but are drawn in from outside. This offers the prospect of much greater range than batteries and experimental examples have flown, but the technology has yet to reach production.

===Microwaves===
[[Power beaming]] of electromagnetic energy such as [[microwave]]s, like a power cable, requires a ground-based power source. However, compared to a power cable, power beaming carries much less weight penalty as altitude increases. The technology has been demonstrated on small models but awaits practical development.&lt;ref name="Power Beaming"/&gt;

==History==

===Pioneers===
The use of electricity for aircraft propulsion was first experimented with during the development of the [[airship]] which took place in the latter part of the nineteenth century. On 8 October 1883, [[Gaston Tissandier]] flew the first electrically-powered airship.&lt;ref name=Tissandier1886/&gt;{{rp|292}} The following year, [[Charles Renard]] and [[Arthur Krebs]] flew [[La France (airship)|La France]] with a more powerful motor.&lt;ref name=Tissandier1886&gt;{{cite book |url= http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k2155076 |title= La Navigation aérienne |at= L'aviation et la direction des aérostats |author= Gaston Tissandier |year= 1886 |language= French |publisher= Hachette}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|306}} Even with the lifting capacity of an airship, the heavy accumulators needed to store the electricity severely limited the speed and range of such early airships.

For a tethered device such as an air observation platform, it is possible to run the power up the tether. In an attempt to create a more practical solution than the clumsy balloons then in use, the Austro-Hungarian [[Petróczy-Kármán-Žurovec]] PKZ-1 electric-powered helicopter was flown in 1917. It had a specially-designed {{cvt|190|hp|kW}} continuous-rated electric motor made by [[Austro-Daimler]] and received its power up a cable from a ground-based DC generator. However electric motors were not yet powerful enough for such applications and the motor burned out after only a few flights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |author= Grosz, P. |title= Helicopter pioneers of World War I |magazine= [[Air Enthusiast]] |issue= 6 |year= 1978 |pages= 154–159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1909, an electric [[Free flight (model aircraft)|free flight]] model was claimed to have been flown eight minutes, but this claim was disputed by the builder of the first recorded electric [[Radio-Controlled model aircraft]] flight in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Dave Day |title= Electric Flight |chapter= History of Electric Flight |publisher= Argus Books |year= 1983 |chapter-url= http://www.windyurtnowski.com/DaveDay/hist.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Power density for electric flight is problematic even for small models.

In 1964, [[William C. Brown]] at [[Raytheon]] flew a [[model helicopter]] that received all of the power needed for flight by [[microwave power transmission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title= Microwave power transmission: a brief history |magazine= [[Popular Science]] |date= January 1988 |author= Arthur Fisher |issue= 232 |page= 65 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=dQEAAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First prototypes===
Success in a full-sized aeroplane would not be achieved until [[Nickel-cadmium battery|Nickel-cadmium]] (NiCad) batteries were developed, having a much higher storage-to-weight ratio than older technologies. In 1973, [[Fred Militky]] and [[Heino Brditschka]] converted a [[Brditschka HB-3]] [[motor glider]] to an electric aircraft, the [[Militky MB-E1]]. It flew for just 14 minutes to become the first manned electric aircraft to fly under its own power.&lt;ref name=JAWA74&gt;{{cite book |title= Jane's All the World's Aircraft 1974–75|last= Taylor |first= John W R |edition= |year=1974|publisher=Jane's Yearbooks |location= London|isbn=0 354 00502 2|page=573 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1973/1973%20-%202937.html|title=fuel cost – flight international – fuel price – 1973 – 2937 – Flight Archive|work=flightglobal.com|accessdate=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Developed almost in parallel with NiCad technology, solar cells were also slowly becoming a practicable power source. Following a successful model test in 1974, the world’s first official flight in a solar-powered, man-carrying aircraft took place on April 29, 1979. The [[Mauro Solar Riser]] used photovoltaic cells to deliver 350 watts at 30 volts. These charged a small battery, which in turn powered the motor. The battery alone was capable of powering the motor for 3 to 5 minutes, following a 1.5-hour charge, enabling it to reach a gliding altitude.&lt;ref name="EAAMuseum"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.airventuremuseum.org/collection/aircraft/UFM-Mauro%20Solar%20Riser.asp|title = UFM/MAURO SOLAR RISER|accessdate = 2008-06-27|last = Experimental Aircraft Association, Inc.|authorlink = |year = 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the direction of Freddie To, an architect and member of the [[Kremer prize]] committee, the [[Solar-Powered Aircraft Developments Solar One|Solar One]] was designed by David Williams and produced by Solar-Powered Aircraft Developments. A motor-glider type aircraft originally built as a pedal-powered airplane to attempt the Channel crossing, the airplane proved too heavy to be successfully powered by human power and was then converted to solar power,&lt;ref name="astroflight"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.astroflight.com/pdfs/SolarHistory.pdf|title = AIAA paper 84-1429|accessdate = 2011-03-04|last = AIAA/SAE/ASME 20th Joint Propulsion Conference|authorlink = |year = 1984|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110707180738/http://www.astroflight.com/pdfs/SolarHistory.pdf|archivedate = 2011-07-07|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; using an electric motor driven by batteries that were charged before flight by a solar cell array on the wing.&lt;ref name="propdesigner"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://library.propdesigner.co.uk/solar_challenger.pdf|title = Solar Challenger|accessdate = 2011-03-04|last = Solar Challenger|authorlink = |year = 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; The maiden flight of Solar One took place at [[Lasham Airfield]], Hampshire, on June 13, 1979.&lt;ref name="flightglobal"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1979/1979%20-%202438.html|title = UK‘s first solar aircraft takes off|accessdate = 2011-03-04|last = Flightglobal Archive|authorlink = |year = 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following successful [[human-powered flight]], a relaunched [[Kremer prize]] allowed the crew to store energy before takeoff.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flightglobal.com/FlightPDFArchive/1985/1985%20-%200745.PDF ''Flight'', 16 March 1985]&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s several such designs stored electricity generated by pedalling, including the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] [[MIT Monarch|Monarch]] and the [[Aerovironment]] Bionic Bat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/6.1985-1447 Bionic Bat – Stored energy human powered aircraft] M.

[[File:Pathfinder Plus solar aircraft over Hawaii.jpg|thumb|The [[NASA Pathfinder Plus]] electric-powered [[unmanned aerial vehicle]]]]

[[NASA Pathfinder|NASA's Pathfinder, Pathfinder Plus]], [[NASA Centurion|Centurion]], and [[NASA Helios|Helios]] were a series of solar and fuel cell system–powered [[unmanned aerial vehicle]]s (UAVs) developed by [[AeroVironment]], Inc. from 1983 until 2003 under [[NASA]]'s [[Environmental Research Aircraft and Sensor Technology]] program.&lt;ref name=heliosfact&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/news/FactSheets/FS-068-DFRC.html|title=NASA Armstrong Fact Sheet: Helios Prototype|work=NASA|accessdate=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=goebel12&gt;[http://www.vectorsite.net/twuav_12.html Goebel, Greg, "The Prehistory of Endurance UAVs", ''Unmanned Aerial Vehicles'', chapter 12.

On July 7, 1997, Pathfinder raised the altitude record for solar–powered aircraft to {{convert|71530|ft|m}}, which was also the record for propeller–driven aircraft.&lt;ref name=heliosfact/&gt;

On August 6, 1998, Pathfinder Plus raised the national altitude record to {{convert|80201|ft|m}} for solar-powered and propeller-driven aircraft.&lt;ref name=heliosfact/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naa.aero/html/records/search_resultsguest.cfm?recordNumber=1855|title=Page Not Found|work=naa.aero|accessdate=8 December 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120212230625/http://www.naa.aero/html/records/search_resultsguest.cfm?recordNumber=1855|archivedate=12 February 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Industry experts expects a 50+ seat hybrid-electric airliner to debut in commercial operation by 2032 for routes like London-Paris.&lt;ref name=AvWeek24aug2018&gt;{{cite news |url= http://aviationweek.com/future-aerospace/aerospace-sector-could-see-overhaul-electric-propulsion |title= Aerospace Sector Could See Overhaul From Electric Propulsion |date= Aug 24, 2018 |author=Michael Bruno |work= Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The potential of electric and hybrid-electric propulsion remains limited for [[general aviation]], according to [[Textron Aviation]], as the [[specific energy]] of [[electricity storage]] is still 2% of [[aviation fuel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/ebace-cessna-short-circuits-talk-of-electric-powere-448953/ |title= Cessna short-circuits talk of electric-powered aircraft |date= 28 May 2018 |author= Stephen Trimble  |work= Flightglobal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
An hybrid configuration is needed for airliners: [[lithium-ion batteries]] including packaging and accessories gives 160 Wh/kg while aviation fuel gives 12,500 Wh/kg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://spectrum.ieee.org/aerospace/aviation/hybrid-electric-airliners-will-cut-emissionsand-noise |date= 1 Jun 2018 |title= Hybrid Electric Airliners Will Cut Emissions—and Noise |author= Philip E.

As electric machines and converters are more efficient, their shaft power available is closer to 145 Wh/kg of battery while a [[gas turbine]] gives 6,545 Wh/kg of fuel: a {{#expr:6545/145round0}}:1 ratio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://leehamnews.com/2017/06/30/bjorns-corner-electric-aircraft/ |title= Bjorn’s Corner: Electric aircraft |author= Bjorn Fehrm |date= June 30, 2017 |work= Leeham}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pipistrel Panthera aircraft.JPG|thumb|[[Pipistrel Panthera]]]]
The [[European Union|EU]] funded the [[Hypstair]] program with €6.55 million over three years till 2016 for a [[technology readiness level|TRL]] of 4: a [[Pipistrel Panthera]] mockup received a [[serial hybrid]]-electric powertrain, ground testing a 200-kW motor driven by batteries only, by a 100-kW generator-only and by both combined.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=AvWeek7aug2018/&gt;--&gt;
It is followed by [[Modular Hybrid Electric Propulsion Architecture|Mahepa]] project from 2017, EU-funded over four years with €9 million under the [[Horizon 2020]] research program to reduce aviation [[carbon emissions]] by 70% in 2050, till TRL 6 before entering product development.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=AvWeek7aug2018/&gt;--&gt;
The Panthera drivetrain will be divided in modules: [[electric motor]] [[thrust]] generator and [[internal combustion]] [[power generator]] in the nose, [[human-machine interface]] and [[computing]], fuel and batteries in the wing.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=AvWeek7aug2018/&gt;--&gt;
Ground testing is planned for 2019 before flight tests in 2020.&lt;ref name=AvWeek7aug2018/&gt;

[[File:Pipistrel Taurus G4 take-off at 2011 Green Flight Challenge.jpg|thumb|The [[Pipistrel Taurus G4]] taking off from the [[Sonoma County Airport]] in California]]
The dual-fuselage, four-seat, battery-powered [[Pipistrel Taurus G4]] received a [[Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt|DLR]] [[hydrogen fuel cell]] powertrain to fly as the HY4 in September 2016, with [[hydrogen tank]]s and batteries in the fuselages, fuel cells and motor in the central [[nacelle]].&lt;!--&lt;ref name=AvWeek7aug2018/&gt;--&gt;
Partners are German motor and inverter developer [[Compact Dynamics]], [[Ulm University]], [[TU Delft]], [[Politecnico di Milano]] and [[University of Maribor]].&lt;!--&lt;ref name=AvWeek7aug2018/&gt;--&gt;
Ground and flight tests should follow those of the Panthera a couple of months later.&lt;ref name=AvWeek7aug2018/&gt;

Along their [[ground handling]], scaling to 19- and 70-seat airliners will be studied in two configurations: more of the same size modules for electric [[distributed propulsion]], or larger sized modules extrapolating the flight-test results, powering twin propellers.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=AvWeek7aug2018/&gt;--&gt;
Flights will test system behavior, measure performance and [[reliability engineering|reliability]], and evaluate failure modes.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=AvWeek7aug2018/&gt;--&gt;
A [[failure rate]] of one per 10 million hours is targeted, as low as in airliners, with very reliable components or with [[Redundancy (engineering)|redundancy]].&lt;ref name=AvWeek7aug2018&gt;{{cite news |url= http://aviationweek.com/future-aerospace/european-project-benchmark-hybrid-electric-propulsion |title= European Project To Benchmark Hybrid-Electric Propulsion |date= Aug 7, 2018 |author= Graham Warwick |work= Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ion wind===
In November 2018, [[MIT]] engineers flew the first plane with no moving parts, propelled by [[ion wind]] thrust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.mit.edu/2018/first-ionic-wind-plane-no-moving-parts-1121 |title= MIT engineers fly first-ever plane with no moving parts |author= Jennifer Chu |work= MIT News|date= November 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
Currently, battery-powered electric aircraft have much more limited payload, range and endurance than those powered by internal combustion engines.  However, pilot training is an area that emphasises short flights. Several companies make, or have demonstrated, light aircraft suitable for initial flight training. The [[Airbus E-Fan]] was aimed at flight training but the project was cancelled. [[Pipistrel]] makes light sport electric aircraft such as the [[Pipistrel WATTsUP]]. A prototype of the [[Aero Electric Sun Flyer]]. The advantage of electric aircraft for flight training is the lower cost of electrical energy compared to aviation fuel. Noise and exhaust emissions are also reduced compared with combustion engines.

==Electric rotorcraft==
Although the Austro-Hungarian [[Petróczy-Kármán-Žurovec]] team flew an experimental tethered military observation helicopter in 1917, the use of electric power for rotor-borne flight was not exploited until modern times.

===Unmanned===
Lightweight components have enabled the development, for recreational purposes among others, of small, cheap radio-controlled [[unmanned aerial vehicle]]s, often called drones, notably the widespread [[quadcopter]].

===Manned===
[[File:Hover-2011-08-29-SD-LG.png|thumb|Solution F/Chretien helicopter]]

The [[Solution F/Chretien Helicopter]] the world's first man-carrying, free-flying electric helicopter was developed by [[Pascal Chretien]]. The concept was taken from the conceptual [[computer-aided design]] model on September 10, 2010 to the first testing at 30% power on March 1, 2011—less than six months. The aircraft first flew August 4 to 12, 2011. All development was conducted in Venelles, France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idtechex.com/events/presentations/challenges-of-aircraft-hybridization-003998.asp |title=Challenges of Aircraft Hybridization |publisher=IDTechEx |accessdate=2013-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://vtol.org/store/product/vertiflite-marchapril-2012-6058.cfm |title=Vertiflite, March/April 2012 – AHS Online Store |publisher=Vtol.org |accessdate=2013-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2016, Philippe Antoine, AQUINEA and ENAC, Ecole Nationale Supérieure de l'Aviation Civile, successfully flew the first full electric conventional helicopter called Volta in Castelnaudary Airfield, France. Volta demonstrated a 15-minute hovering flight in December 2016. The helicopter is powered by two PMSM motors delivering together 80&amp;nbsp;kW and a 22kWh Lithium battery. Volta is officially registered by DGAC, the French Airworthiness Authority, and is authorized for flying in the French civilian airspace.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

In September 2016, [[Martine Rothblatt]] and Tier1 Engineering successfully tested an electric-powered helicopter. The five minute flight reached an altitude of 400 feet with a peak speed of 80 knots. The [[Robinson R44]] helicopter was modified with two three-phase permanent magnet synchronous [[YASA Motors]], weighing 100&amp;nbsp;lb, plus 11 [[Brammo]] [[Lithium polymer batteries]] weighing 1100&amp;nbsp;lb and a digital cockpit display.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Grady | first = Mary | work = AVweb.com | title = First Flight For Battery-Powered Helicopter | date = October 17, 2016 | url = http://www.avweb.com/avwebflash/news/First-Flight-For-Battery-Powered-Helicopter-227134-1.html | accessdate = October 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= Bradley Zint |title= Costa Mesa firm tests first manned battery-powered chopper |newspaper= [[LA Times]] |date= October 7, 2016 |url= http://www.latimes.com/socal/daily-pilot/news/tn-dpt-me-tier-one-helicopter-20161007-story.html |accessdate= October 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2016/10/31/electric-helicopter-test-flight/ |title=Watch the World's First Manned Battery-Powered Helicopter Fly |date=October 31, 2016 |work=Fortune |accessdate= November 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It later flew for 20 minutes in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://electrek.co/2016/10/05/first-battery-powered-manned-helicopter/ |title=The first battery-powered manned helicopter: 20 minutes flight time with 1100 lbs battery pack|date=5 October 2016|work= [[Electrek]] |accessdate=6 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube|-05wY41ht1s}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Projects===

The [[Sikorsky Firefly]] S-300 was a project to flight test an electric rotorcraft, but the project was put on hold due to battery limitations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sikorsky.com/About+Sikorsky/News/Press+Details?pressvcmid=02a0d808a6d1a210VgnVCM1000004f62529fRCRD Project Firefly]&lt;/ref&gt; The world's first large-scale all-electric [[tilt-rotor]] was the [[AgustaWestland Project Zero]] [[unmanned aerial vehicle]] technology demonstrator, which performed unmanned tethered fights on ground power in June 2011, less than six months after the company gave the official go-ahead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://vtol.org/publications/vertiflite-magazine/project-zero |title=AHS – Sample Vertiflite article: Project Zero |publisher=Vtol.org |date=2013-03-04 |accessdate=2013-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''electromagnetic oscillograph''' is an [[oscillograph]] which measures variations of electric current by having it go through a magnetic coil. Variations in current induce momentum in the coil, which can be directly measured.

The electromagnetic oscillograph was invented by [[William Duddell]]. 

Some models utilise a mirror which reflects a beam of light, allowing measurement of minute movements of the coil. Other were fitted with a hand, possibly fitted with a pen to record values.

[[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] '''Elmer Ellsworth Kirkpatrick, Jr.,''' was a [[United States Army]] [[Quartermaster Corps (United States Army)|Quartermaster Corps]] and [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]] officer who worked on the [[Alaska Highway]], the [[Canol]] project, and the [[Manhattan Project]] during [[World War II]].

A 1929 graduate of the [[United States Military Academy]] at [[West Point]], Kirkpatrick was involved in numerous construction projects in the United States and Panama. He went to Washington, D.C., in October 1940 to work in the office of the [[Quartermaster General of the United States Army|Quartermaster General]], where he worked to prepare the necessary accommodation and training facilities for the vast army that would be created to fight [[World War II]]. After duty in Alaska, he joined the Manhattan Project, and was responsible for the development of the base facilities used for the [[atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]].

After the war he was Chief of Staff of the [[Armed Forces Special Weapons Project]], and the head of the Construction Division of the [[Far East Command (United States)|Far East Command]] in Japan.

==Early life==
Elmer Ellsworth Kirkpatrick, Jr., was born in [[Yukon, Oklahoma]] on 17 August 1905,&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kirkpatrickfamilyarchive.com/family-2/family-members/elmer-ellsworth-kirkpatrick-jr/ |title=Elmer Ellsworth Kirkpatrick, Jr. |publisher=Kirkpatrick Family Archive |accessdate=9 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the second of four sons of Elmer Ellsworth Kirkpatrick, Sr., a dentist, and his wife Helene Claudia née Spencer. Kirkpatrick and his brothers had a younger sister, Mary Elizabeth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kirkpatrickfamilyarchive.com/family-2/family-members/dr-elmer-e-kirkpatrick/ |title=Dr, Elmer E. Kirkpatrick |publisher=Kirkpatrick Family Archive |accessdate=9 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kirkpatrick was educated at McKinley Elementary and Central High School in Oklahoma City. He joined the [[Reserve Officer Training Corps]] in his freshman year, and rose to the rank of [[corporal]] in the 189th Field Artillery Battery of the [[Oklahoma National Guard]]. After graduation he spent a year at the [[Marion Military Institute]].&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt;

==Early career==
[[File:Hot Springs Rehabilitation Center.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The former Army and Navy Hospital in [[Hot Springs, Arkansas]]]]
On 1 July 1925, Kirkpatrick entered the [[United States Military Academy]] at [[West Point]],{{sfn|Cullum|1930|p=2170}} following in the footsteps of his older brother Lewis Spencer Kirkpatrick,&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt; who had graduated with the class of 1924.{{sfn|Cullum|1930|p=1871}} Lewis later died as a prisoner of the Japanese on 27 April 1943.{{sfn|Cullum|1950|p=454}} He graduated 169th in his class of 299 on 13 June 1929, and was commissioned as a [[second lieutenant]] in the [[Quartermaster Corps (United States Army)|Quartermaster Corps]].{{sfn|Cullum|1930|p=2170}}

Two days later he married Edith Luise Koelsch.&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt; His first posting was to [[Fort Sam Houston]], Texas, as an assistant to the Constructing Quartermaster,{{sfn|Cullum|1930|p=2170}} where his first child, a daughter called Patricia, was born in 1930.&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt; On 9 June 1931, he entered [[Carnegie Institute of Technology]],{{sfn|Cullum|1930|p=2170}} from which he graduated with a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in civil engineering the following year.{{sfn|Cullum|1940|p=808}}

Kirkpatrick was posted to [[Hot Springs, Arkansas]] in July 1932 as assistant to the Constructing Quartermaster building the Army and Navy Hospital there. He was then sent to [[Harrodsburg, Kentucky]], as assistant to the Constructing Quartermaster in June 1933, where he was engaged in building the Pioneer Memorial Monument there. In November 1933 he returned to West Point as assistant to the Constructing Quartermaster . After five years as a second lieutenant, he was promoted to [[first lieutenant]] on 1 November 1934.{{sfn|Cullum|1940|p=808}}&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt;

After attending the Quartermaster School in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], from September 1936 to June 1937, Kirkpatrick was  assigned to [[Fort Monmouth, New Jersey]], as Post Quartermaster, and then to [[Fort DuPont]], Delaware, as Constructing Quartermaster in June 1938.{{sfn|Cullum|1940|p=808}} His son William Terry was born in Washington, D.C. later that year.&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt; He was promoted to [[Captain (United States O-3)|captain]] on 13 June 1939.{{sfn|Cullum|1940|p=808}}

Kirkpatrick 's first overseas posting came in August 1939, when he was sent to the [[Panama Canal Department]] as Assistant Constructing Quartermaster. There, he supervised works at [[Fort Davis, Panama|Fort Davis]], [[Fort Randolph (Panama)|Fort Randolph]], [[France Field]], and the new anti-aircraft artillery positions on [[Gatun Lake]].{{sfn|Cullum|1940|p=808}}

==World War II==
Kirkpatrick went to Washington, D.C., in October 1940 to work in the office of the [[Quartermaster General of the United States Army|Quartermaster General]].{{sfn|Cullum|1950|p=615}} At this point, the US Army was about to embark on a national mobilization, and it was the task of the Construction Division of the Quartermaster Corps to prepare the necessary accommodation and training facilities for the vast army that would be created to fight [[World War II]], which was already raging in Europe.{{sfn|Fine|Remington|1972|pp=241–243}}

The enormous construction program had been dogged by bottlenecks, shortages, delays, spiralling costs, and poor living conditions at the construction sites. Newspapers began publishing accounts charging the Construction Division with incompetence, ineptitude, and inefficiency.{{sfn|Fine|Remington|1972|pp=241–243}} Between 1 July 1940 and 10 December 1941, the Construction Division let contracts worth $1,676,293,000.{{sfn|Fine|Remington|1972|pp=430–431}} He was promoted to [[major]] on 10 October 1942 and [[Lieutenant Colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]] on 1 February 1942. On 19 February, he was transferred to the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]].{{sfn|Cullum|1950|p=615}}

In October 1942, Kirkpatrick became District Engineer of the Milwaukee District.{{sfn|Cullum|1950|p=615}} As such he was responsible for the management of $150 million of construction of airfields, cantonments, and other facilities in Michigan, including a new [[Allis-Chalmers Manufacturing Company]] factory.&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt; In March 1943 he became Chief of Staff of the Northwest Service Command, with its headquarters at [[Whitehorse, Yukon]]. This was responsible for the maintenance of the [[Alaska Highway]], and for the [[Canol]] project.&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt; He was promoted to the rank of [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]] on 21 April 1943.{{sfn|Cullum|1950|p=615}} For his service, he was awarded the [[Legion of Merit]].{{sfn|Cullum|1950|p=615}}

Kirkpatrick returned to Washington, D.C., in September 1944, where he became a special assistant to the Director of the [[Manhattan Project]], [[Major General (United States)|Major General]] [[Leslie R. Groves, Jr.]] He was sent to the Pacific island of [[Tinian]] as liaison to the [[Twentieth Air Force]].{{sfn|Cullum|1950|p=615}} On Tinian he was responsible for base development in support of [[Project Alberta]] and the [[509th Composite Group]], and was alternate to [[Brigadier General (United States)|Brigadier General]] Thomas F. Farrell, Groves's deputy for Operations. The facilities would be used for operations including the [[atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]].{{sfn|Campbell|2005|p=156}} For his services to the Manhattan Project he was awarded a second [[Legion of Merit]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://projects.militarytimes.com/citations-medals-awards/recipient.php?recipientid=98058 |title=Valor awards for Elmer E. Kirkpatrick |publisher=Military Review |accessdate=10 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Commendation Ribbon]].{{sfn|Cullum|1950|p=615}}

==Later life==
After the war, Kirkpatrick was posted to [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]], as Deputy District Engineer of the Manhattan District. He was reduced to his permanent rank of major on 13 June 1946. After the Manhattan District was dissolved he was posted back to West Point in March 1947 as Assistant Chief of Staff, Logistics (G-4). There he was promoted to lieutenant colonel again on 1 July 1948. He returned to Washington, D.C., in July 1949 as Chief of Staff of the [[Armed Forces Special Weapons Project]].{{sfn|Cullum|1950|p=615}}

Kirkpatrick subsequently served in Japan as head of the Construction Division of the [[Far East Command (United States)|Far East Command]] and [[United States Army Forces in the Far East]], and as Chief of the Japan Construction Agency. He then became District Engineer in [[Jacksonville, Florida]], where he was responsible for the construction of the initial facilities at [[Cape Canaveral]] for the space program,. This was followed by duty as District Engineer of the Southern District of the Mediterranean Division, with its headquarters in [[Livorno, Italy]]. He retired from the Army on 1 November 1958 with the rank of colonel.&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt; He was awarded a third Legion of Merit.&lt;ref name="West Point"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.westpointaog.org/NetCommunity/Document.Doc?id=2442 |title=Kirkpatrick bio |publisher=West Point Association of Graduates |accessdate=10 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kirkpatrick moved to [[Jacksonville, Florida]], where he became an Assistant Professor in the College of Architecture and the [[University of Florida]] in [[Gainesville, Florida]]. He retired from this in 1965.&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt;  His son Terry graduated from West Point with the class of 1961 and served with the engineers in the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref name="West Point"/&gt; His wife died in 1982 and he  married Virginia Wright in 1986. After he died in Jacksonville on 26 March 1990, he was cremated and half of his ashes were scattered into the waters of Melrose Bay, Florida, while the other half were interred with his first wife's in [[West Point Cemetery]].&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt;

An '''Energy Neutral Design''' is a Design of any type (Website, Multi-media, Architecture, Art, Music, Entertainment, etc.) that has the environment and low energy consumption practices in mind during all stages of planning and production.

Energy neutral design can also refer to environmentally powered electronics, where devices absorb or harvest energy from the immediate surroundings and transform it to the electricity they require for their operation.  One example of this is the [[Batteryless_radio]].  More recently wireless sensor networks and internet of things devices have featured energy neutral designs where light, heat, motion or other forms of energy are converted to electricity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1990">The '''fill factor''' of an [[image sensor]] array is the ratio of a pixel's light sensitive area to its total area.  
For pixels without [[microlens]]es, the fill factor is the ratio of [[photodiode]] area to total pixel area,&lt;ref&gt;

but the use of microlenses increases the ''effective fill factor'', often to nearly 100%, by converging light from the whole  pixel area into the photodiode.&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1701">'''Fishing rod tapers''' describe how much a [[fishing rod]] bends or flexes under pressure.  Different tapers are used for different fishing scenarios as well as for personal preference.  

==Action==
The action of a taper is described by the flex of the tip of a rod when pressure is applied [[perpendicular]] to the rod.  Only a section of the rod starting at the tip of the rod should bend while the remainder of the rod should stay rigid.

Variations can be described in three main categories, fast, medium, or slow with variations in between each.  A rod with a fast taper will only flex the top 20 percent. Medium fast and medium tapers will flex approximately 30 to 60 percent of the rod respectively. If the rod has a slow taper, almost the entire rod or blank will bend or flex under pressure.

==Usage==
Rod taper is important for several reasons. The feel for the lure being used and the fish being caught dictate the appropriate taper use.

A fast action tip will be used when fishing [[Jig (fishing)|jig]] type lures.  The angler can feel and therefore control what the lure is doing quite easily.  Since only the very tip of the rod bends, when a fish strikes the angler has ample rod shaft and backbone to set the hook correctly.

In contrast to fast tapers, the slow flex rods offer the angler advantages when fighting large fish with light [[fishing line]].  This additional flex allows the rod to absorb the force of the fish as opposed to the line.  This is often the angler who likes to fish split shot rigs or Lindy rigs for [[walleye]].

They are best described as directionally "off tone" wavy lines or patterns. The reason for this is that the Injection speed is set too slow (the [[plastic]] has cooled down too much during injection, injection speeds must be set as fast as you can get away with at all times).

{{more citations needed|date=December 2012}}
'''Garden Organic''', formerly known as the '''Henry Doubleday Research Association''' (HDRA), is a UK organic growing charity dedicated to researching and promoting [[organic gardening]], [[organic farming|farming]] and [[organic food|food]]. The charity maintains the '''Heritage Seed Library''' to preserve vegetable seeds from [[heritage cultivar]]s and make them available to growers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gardenorganic.org.uk/hsl/hsl.php|title=Garden Organic's Heritage Seed Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Henry Doubleday Research Association was founded in 1954 to research and promote [[organic gardening]], [[organic farming|farming]], and [[organic food|food]]. The charity adopted the working name "Garden Organic" in 2005 and is now the UK’s leading organic growing charity. "Henry Doubleday Research Association" remains the legal name under which it is [[Charitable organization|registered as a charity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{EW charity|298104|THE HENRY DOUBLEDAY RESEARCH ASSOCIATION}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was founded by [[horticulturist]] and freelance [[journalist]] [[Lawrence D Hills]] and named after [[Henry Doubleday (1810-1902)|Henry Doubleday]], an [[Essex]]-based [[Quaker]] [[smallholder]] who had a particular interest in the properties of [[comfrey]]. The organisation was first based at [[Bocking, Essex|Bocking]] near [[Braintree, Essex|Braintree]] in Essex, hence the name of Bocking 14, a variety of [[comfrey]] bred by Hills for its useful properties. A sister organisation was also formed in Australia, the Henry Doubleday Research Association of Australia Inc.

Jackie and Alan Gear took over management of the charity in 1976, and in 1985 the organisation relocated to its present {{convert|22|acre|m2|adj=on}} headquarters site at [[Ryton-on-Dunsmore]] near [[Coventry]] in the [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands]]. The Gears retired in 2004, when Dr. Susan Kay-Williams became the chief executive and the charity changed its working name to Garden Organic. Dr. Kay-Williams left in the summer of 2007 and the charity appointed Myles Bremner, former Director of Fundraising at children’s charity, NCH. Myles Bremner left in the summer of 2013 and was replaced by James Campbell, former acting chief development officer of the Earthwatch Institute.

In the autumn of 2017 Garden Organic announced that it was considering options for the future of its Ryton site, with full or partial sale among the possibilities. Some members expressed concern over the way the charity was handling the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Garden Organic in Ryton goes up for sale|url=https://www.hortweek.com/garden-organic-ryton-goes-sale/parks-and-gardens/article/1455428|work=Horticulture Week|date=24 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sandford|first1=Elis|title=Organic Gardens where ashes spread listed for sale|url=https://www.coventrytelegraph.net/news/organic-gardens-ashes-spread-listed-14238589|work=Coventry Telegraph|date=2 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Services==
The organisation has over 20,000 members. It has trained over 600 Master Composter volunteers from around the UK to spread the home [[composting]] message&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A National Scheme  for Help and Advice|url=http://www.carryoncomposting.com/142941473|website=Carry on Composting|accessdate=4 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and runs research and international development programmes that help commercial growers across the UK and overseas adopt organic methods.

In 2010 with funding from the Big Lottery Fund’s Local Food Scheme, Sheepdrove Trust and local authorities in four areas — Warwickshire, North London, South London and Norfolk — the Charity set up a Master Gardener Programme.   The Charity's Master Gardeners Programme trains and supports mentors and community growing initiatives around the Country working with Local Authorities, Housing Associations and NHS Health providers to support networks of Master Gardeners and volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Garden Organic’s Master Gardener Programme wins national award  {{!}} Norfolk Master Gardeners|url=http://norfolk.mastergardeners.org.uk/2013/11/26/garden-organics-master-gardener-programme-wins-national-award/|work=norfolk.mastergardeners.org.uk|date=26 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The Programme has expanded to other areas in the UK and is currently working with G4S in supporting a Master Gardener Programme for offenders in prisons HMP Rye Hill and Onsley.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, G.; Bos, E.; Brady, Geraldine; Kneafsey, Moya; Glynn, M.

It used to actively campaign on issues vital to both people and the environment including health, sustainability, and climate change, and helps children in over 15% of the UK's schools learn about food and organic growing through its free education programme, Garden Organic for Schools&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=How to green your school|url=https://theecologist.org/2010/feb/10/how-green-your-school|work=The Ecologist|date=10 February 2010|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and through its work on the Food for Life Partnership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Green fingers grow green minds|url=https://theecologist.org/2013/aug/29/green-fingers-grow-green-minds|work=The Ecologist|date=29 August 2013|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facilities==
The charity's headquarters are at its Ryton site in [[Warwickshire]]. Here the organisation not only leads its charitable delivery activities, but also runs over 30 individual gardens in {{convert|10|acre|m2}} of landscaped grounds open to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=10 wildlife-friendly gardens to visit|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/gardening/gardens-to-visit/10-wildlife-friendly-gardens-visit/ryton-organic-garden/|work=The Telegraph|date=9 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site is also home to The Organic Way, extensive conference and educational facilities, a vegetarian/vegan restaurant, a small shop with organic seeds and the charity’s Heritage [[Seed library|Seed Library]], which conserves over 800 endangered varieties of rare [[vegetable]] seeds under threat from extinction.

As well as Ryton Gardens, the charity has run the walled kitchen gardens at [[Audley End]], [[Essex]] in association with [[English Heritage]]. Audley End is a [[Jacobean architecture|Jacobean]] stately home owned by English Heritage and in 1999 Garden Organic restored its walled kitchen garden using organic methods.   The Gardens continue to be managed by English Heritage under the guidance of Garden Organic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Audley End, (E.H.) - Walled Kitchen Gardens Network|url=http://www.walledgardens.net/garden-finder/audley-end-e-h/|website=Walled Kitchen Gardens Network|accessdate=4 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Yalding Organic Gardens|demonstration garden]] in [[Yalding]], [[Kent]], showing organic growing techniques in fourteen individual gardens was closed in 2007 after 12 years' development because of financial unviability. The site then came under a sequence of several owners and since 2016 has become a venue for weddings and other events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yalding Organic Gardens|url=https://www.gardenarena.co.uk/gardens/england/kent/maidstone/south-east-england/yalding-organic-gardens/|website=Essential British Gardens|accessdate=4 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Financing and membership==
The charity relies on funds from its supporters and members to carry out its work and, in return, offers a six-monthly magazine, members-only web pages and information sheets, as well as access to the charity’s dedicated team of advisors who answer more than 5,000 organic gardening queries every year. In addition, members gain unlimited free admission to the two demonstration gardens together with the [[Royal Horticultural Society]] gardens at Wisley, Harlow Carr, Rosemoor and Hyde Hall, plus over 20 other gardens across the UK.

Garden Organic’s patron is HRH [[The Prince of Wales]]. The organisation's President is Professor Tim Lang and Vice Presidents are [[Raymond Blanc]], [[Thelma Barlow]] and [[Susan Hampshire]]. The charity reaches more than three million beneficiaries across the world.

'''''Headway''''' is a measurement of the distance or time between vehicles in a transit system. The ''minimum headway'' is the shortest such distance or time achievable by a system without a reduction in the speed of vehicles. The precise definition varies depending on the application, but it is most commonly measured as the distance from the tip of one vehicle to the tip of the next one behind it. It can be expressed as the distance between vehicles, or as time it will take for the trailing vehicle to cover that distance. A "shorter" headway signifies closer spacing between the vehicles. [[Freight]] [[trains]] might have headways measured in parts of an hour, [[rapid transit|metro systems]] operate with headways on the order of 1 to 5 minutes, and vehicles on a [[freeway]] can have as little as 2 seconds headway between them.

Headway is a key input in calculating the overall [[route capacity]] of any transit system. A system that requires large headways has more empty space than passenger capacity, which lowers the total number of passengers or cargo quantity being transported for a given length of line (railroad or highway, for instance). In this case, the capacity has to be improved through the use of larger vehicles. On the other end of the scale, a system with short headways, like cars on a freeway, can offer relatively large capacities even though the vehicles carry few passengers.

The term is most often applied to [[rail transport]] and [[bus transport]], where low headways are often needed to move large numbers of people in mass transit railways and [[bus rapid transit]] systems. A lower headway requires more infrastructure, making lower headways expensive to achieve. Modern large cities require passenger rail systems with tremendous capacity, and low headways allow passenger demand to be met in all but the busiest cities. Newer signalling systems and [[Moving block signalling|moving block]] controls have significantly reduced headways in modern systems compared to the same lines only a few years ago. In principle, automated [[personal rapid transit]] systems and [[Platoon (automobile)|automobile platoons]] could reduce headways to as little as fractions of a second.

==Description==

===Different measures===
There are a number of different ways to measure and express the same concept, the distance between vehicles. The differences are largely due to historical development in different countries or fields.

The term developed from railway use, where the distance between the trains was very great compared to the length of the train itself. Measuring headway from the front of one train to the front of the next was simple and consistent with timetable scheduling of trains, but constraining tip-to-tip headway does not always ensure safety. In the case of a metro system, train lengths are uniformly short and the headway allowed for stopping is much longer, so tip-to-tip headway may be used with a minor safety factor. Where vehicle size varies and may be longer than their stopping distances or spacing, as with freight trains and highway applications, tip-to-tail measurements are more common.

The units of measure also vary. The most common terminology is to use the time of passing from one vehicle to the next, which closely mirrors the way the headways were measured in the past. A timer is started when one train passes a point, and then measures time until the next one passes, giving the tip-to-tip time. This same measure can also be expressed in terms of vehicles-per-hour, which is used on the [[Moscow Metro]] for instance.&lt;ref&gt;The Metro normally states their best headway as 142 trains per hour, but their [http://engl.mosmetro.ru/pages/page_0.php?id_page=2 english page] uses the more familiar units.&lt;/ref&gt; Distance measurements are somewhat common in non-train applications, like vehicles on a road, but time measurements are common here as well.

===Railway examples===
Train movements in most rail systems are tightly controlled by [[railway signalling]] systems, or [[signalling block system]]. In many railways drivers are given instructions on speeds, and routes through the rail network. Trains ([[rollingstock]]) can only accelerate and decelerate relatively slowly, so stopping from anything but low speeds requires several hundred metres or even more. The track distance required to stop is often much longer than the range of the driver's vision. If the track ahead is obstructed, for example a train is at stop there, then the train behind it will probably see it far too late to avoid a collision. 

Signalling systems serve to provide drivers with information on the state of the track ahead, so that a collision may be avoided. A side effect of this important safety function is that the headway of any rail system is effectively determined by the structure of the signalling system, and particularly the spacing between signals and the amount of information that can be provided in the signal. Rail system headways can be calculated from the signalling system. In practice there are a variety of different methods of keeping trains apart, some which are manual such as train order working or systems involving telegraphs, and others which rely entirely on signalling infrastructure to regulate train movements. Manual systems of working trains are common in area with low numbers of train movements (such as 1 per day), and headways are more often discussed in the context of non-manual systems. [[Automatic block signalling]] is probably the most relevant to the calculation of headways.

For automatic block signalling (ABS), the headway is measured in minutes, and calculated from the time from the passage of a train to when the signalling system returns to full clear (proceed). It is not normally measured tip to tip. An ABS system divides the track into blocks, into which only one train can enter at a time. Commonly trains are kept two to three block sections apart, depending on how the signalling system is designed, and so the size of the block will often determine the headway.

To have visual contact as a method to avoid collision (such as during [[Shunting (rail)|shunting]]) is done only at low speeds, like 40&amp;nbsp;km/h. A key safety factor of train operations is to space the trains out by at least this distance, the "brick-wall stop" criterion.&lt;ref&gt;Parkinson and Fisher, pg 17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For a links to a variety of sources on the brick-wall stop in public transit planning, see Richard Gronning, [http://faculty.washington.edu/jbs/itrans/brickwall-stops.doc "Brick-Wall Stops and PRT"], June 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In order to signal the trains in time to allow them to stop, the railways placed workmen on the lines who timed the passing of a train, and then signalled any following trains if a certain elapsed time had not passed. This is why train headways are normally measured as tip-to-tip times, because the clock was reset as the engine passed the workman.

As remote signalling systems were invented, the workmen were replaced with signal towers at set locations along the track. This broke the track into a series of "blocks" between the towers. Trains were not allowed to enter a block until the signal said it was clear, thereby guaranteeing a minimum of one block's headway between the trains. This had the side-effect of limiting the maximum speed of the trains to the speed where they could stop in the distance of one block. This was an important consideration for the [[Advanced Passenger Train]] in the [[United Kingdom]], where the block sizes limited speeds and demanded a new braking system be developed.&lt;ref&gt;Leonard Hugh Williams, "Advanced Passenger Train: A Promise Unfulfilled", Ian Allan, 1985, {{ISBN|0-7110-1474-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:3 aspect headway.jpg|550px|center|thumb|An example of headway on a railway system with multiple blocks. Train B can only enter a block with a green or yellow "aspect" (light), and must reduce speed in the yellow blocks to the point where they can stop within the sighting distance.]]

There is no perfect block size for the block-control approach; some considerations favour a shorter block size, some a longer.  Longer blocks have the advantages that they use as few signals as possible, signals being expensive and points of failure, and that they give the trains more time to stop and thus allow for higher speeds. On the other hand, spreading the signals out over greater distances increases the headway, and thus reduces the overall capacity of the line. These needs have to be balanced on a case-by-case basis.&lt;ref&gt;Parkinson and Fisher, pg 18-19&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other examples===
In the case of automobile traffic, the key consideration in braking performance is the user's reaction time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Van Winsum|first1=W.|last2=Brouwer|first2=W.|title=Time Headway in Car following and Operational Performance during Unexpected Braking|journal=Perceptual and Motor Skills|date=1997|volume=84|issue=3 supplement|pages=1247–1257|doi=10.2466/pms.1997.84.3c.1247}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the train case, the stopping distance is generally much shorter than the spotting distance. That means that the driver will be matching their speed to the vehicle in front before they reach it, eliminating the "brick-wall" effect.

Widely used numbers are that a car traveling at 60&amp;nbsp;mph will require about 225&amp;nbsp;feet to stop, a distance it will cover just under 6 seconds. Nevertheless, highway travel often occurs with considerable safety with tip-to-tail headways on the order of 2 seconds. That's because the user's reaction time is about 1.5 seconds so 2 seconds allows for a slight overlap that makes up for any difference in braking performance between the two cars.

Various [[personal rapid transit]] systems in the 1970s considerably reduced the headways compared to earlier rail systems. Under computer control, reaction times can be reduced to fractions of a second. Whether traditional headway regulations should apply to PRT and car train technology is debatable. In the case of the [[Cabinentaxi]] system developed in [[Germany]], headways were set to 1.9 seconds because the developers were forced to adhere to the brick-wall criterion. In experiments, they demonstrated headways on the order of half of a second.&lt;ref&gt;Carnegie, Appendix 1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Low-headway systems===
Headway spacing is selected by various safety criteria, but the basic concept remains the same - leave enough time for the vehicle to safely stop behind the vehicle in front of it. The "safely stop" criterion has a non-obvious solution, however; if a vehicle follows immediately behind the one in front, the vehicle in front simply cannot stop quickly enough to damage the vehicle behind it. An example would be a conventional train, where the vehicles are held together and have only a few millimetres of "play" in the couplings. Even when the locomotive applies emergency braking, the cars following do not suffer any damage because they quickly close the gap in the couplings before the speed difference can build up.

There have been many experiments with automated driving systems that follow this logic and greatly decrease headways to tenths or hundredths of a second in order to improve safety. Today, modern [[Communication-based train control|CBTC]] railway signalling systems are able to significantly reduce headway between trains in the operation. Using automated "car follower" [[cruise control]] systems, vehicles can be formed into [[flocks]] that approximate the capacity of conventional trains. These systems were first employed as part of personal rapid transit research, but later using conventional cars with autopilot-like systems.

==Headway and route capacity==
Route capacity is defined by three figures; the number of passengers (or weight of cargo) per vehicle, the maximum safe speed of the vehicles, and the number of vehicles per unit time. Since the headway factors into two of the three inputs, it is a primary consideration in capacity calculations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/trafficanalysistools/tat_vol3/sect5.htm "Traffic Analysis Toolbox"], US Department of Transit, FHWA-HRT-04-040&lt;/ref&gt; The headway, in turn, is defined by the braking performance, or some external factor based on it, like block sizes. Following the methods in Anderson:&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, pg. 47-48&lt;/ref&gt;

===Minimum safe headway===
The minimum safe headway measured tip-to-tail is defined by the braking performance:

&lt;math&gt;T_{min} =  t_r + \frac{kV}{2} \left(\frac{1}{a_f} - \frac{1}{a_l} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

where:
* &lt;math&gt;T_{min}&lt;/math&gt; is the minimum safe headway, in seconds
* &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is the speed of the vehicles
* &lt;math&gt;t_r&lt;/math&gt; is the reaction time, the maximum time it takes for a following vehicle to detect a malfunction in the leader, and to fully apply the emergency brakes.
* &lt;math&gt;a_f&lt;/math&gt; is the minimum braking deceleration of the follower.
* &lt;math&gt;a_l&lt;/math&gt; is the maximum braking deceleration of the leader. For brick-wall considerations, &lt;math&gt;a_l&lt;/math&gt; is infinite and this consideration is eliminated.
* &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is an arbitrary safety factor, greater than or equal to 1.

The tip-to-tip headway is simply the tip-to-tail headway plus the length of the vehicle, expressed in time:

&lt;math&gt;T_{tot} = \frac{L}{V} + t_r + \frac{kV}{2} \left(\frac{1}{a_f} - \frac{1}{a_l} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

where:
* &lt;math&gt;T_{tot}&lt;/math&gt; time for vehicle and headway to pass a point
* &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is the vehicle length

===Capacity===
The vehicular capacity of a single lane of vehicles is simply the inverse of the tip-to-tip headway. This is most often expressed in vehicles-per-hour:

&lt;math&gt;n_{veh} = \frac{3600}{T_{min}}&lt;/math&gt;

where:
* &lt;math&gt;n_{veh}&lt;/math&gt; is the number of vehicles per hour
* &lt;math&gt;T_{min}&lt;/math&gt; is the minimum safe headway, in seconds

The passenger capacity of the lane is simply the product of vehicle capacity and the passenger capacity of the vehicles:

&lt;math&gt;n_{pas} = P \frac{3600}{T_{min}}&lt;/math&gt;

where:
* &lt;math&gt;n_{pas}&lt;/math&gt; is the number of passengers per hour
* &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is the maximum passenger capacity per vehicle
* &lt;math&gt;T_{min}&lt;/math&gt; is the minimum safe headway, in seconds

===Examples===
Consider these examples:

1) freeway traffic, per lane: 100&amp;nbsp;km/h (~28&amp;nbsp;m/s) speeds, 4 passengers per vehicle, 4 meter vehicle length, 2.5&amp;nbsp;m/s braking (1/4 ''gee''), 2 second reaction time, brick-wall stop, &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; of 1.5;

: &lt;math&gt;T_{tot} = \frac{4}{28} + 2 + \frac{1.5 \times 28}{2} \left(\frac{1}{2.5} \right)&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;n_{pas} = {P}\times \frac{3600}{T_{tot}}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;T_{tot}&lt;/math&gt; = 10.5 seconds ; &lt;math&gt;n_{pas}&lt;/math&gt; = 7,200 passengers per hour if 4 people per car and 2 seconds headway is assumed, or 342 passengers per hour if 1 person per car and 10,5 seconds headway is assumed.

The headway used in reality is much less than 10.5 seconds, since the brick-wall principle is not used on freeways. In reality, 1.5 persons per car and 2 seconds headway can be assumed, giving 1800 cars or 2700 passengers per lane and hour.

For comparison, the [[Marin County, California]] (near [[San Francisco]]) states that peak flow on the three-lane [[Highway 101]] is about 7,200 ''vehicles'' per hour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.co.marin.ca.us/depts/pw/main/HWY101.pdf "How a Freeway Breaks Down"], Marin County Public Works&lt;/ref&gt; This is about the same number of passengers per lane.

Notwithstanding these formulas it is widely known that reducing headway increases risk of collision in standard private automobile settings and is often referred to as [[tailgating]].

2) metro system, per line: 40&amp;nbsp;km/h (~11&amp;nbsp;m/s) speeds, 1000 passengers, 100 meter vehicle length, 0.5&amp;nbsp;m/s braking, 2 second reaction time, brick-wall stop, &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; of 1.5;

: &lt;math&gt;T_{tot} = \frac{100}{11} + 2 + \frac{1.5 \times 11}{2} \left(\frac{1}{0.5} \right)&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;n_{pas} = {1000}\times \frac{3600}{T_{tot}}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;T_{tot}&lt;/math&gt; = 28 seconds ; &lt;math&gt;n_{pas}&lt;/math&gt; = 130,000 passengers per hour

Note that most signalling systems used on metros place an artificial limit on headway that is not dependent on braking performance. Also the time needed for station stops limits the headway. Using a typical figure of 2 minutes (120 seconds):

: &lt;math&gt;n_{pas} = {1000}\times \frac{3600}{120}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;n_{pas}&lt;/math&gt; = 30,000 passengers per hour

Since the headway of a metro is constrained by signalling considerations, not vehicle performance, reductions in headway through improved signalling have a direct impact on passenger capacity. For this reason, the [[London Underground]] system has spent a considerable amount of money on upgrading the SSR Network,&lt;ref name="SSR"&gt;Bombardier to Deliver Major London Underground Signalling.[http://www.bombardier.com/en/transportation/media-centre/press-releases/details?docID=0901260d80181411] Press release, Bombardier Transportation Media Center, 2011. Accessed June 2011&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jubilee line|Jubilee]] and [[Central line (London Underground)|Central]] lines with new [[Communication-based train control|CBTC]] signalling to reduce the headway from about 3 minutes to 1, while preparing for the [[2012 Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;railway-technology.com, [http://www.railway-technology.com/projects/london-olympics/ "London Olympics Transport Upgrade"]&lt;/ref&gt;

3) automated [[personal rapid transit]] system, 30&amp;nbsp;km/h (~8&amp;nbsp;m/s) speeds, 3 passengers, 3 meter vehicle length, 2.5&amp;nbsp;m/s braking (1/4 ''gee''), 0.01 second reaction time, brake-failure on lead vehicle for 1&amp;nbsp;m/s slowing, bot 2.5,&amp;nbsp;m/s if lead vehicle breaks. &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; of 1.1;

: &lt;math&gt;T_{tot} = \frac{3}{8} + 0.01 + \frac{1.1 \times 8}{2} \left(\frac{1}{2.5} - \frac{1}{2.5} \right)&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;n_{pas} = {3}\times \frac{3600}{0.385}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;T_{tot}&lt;/math&gt; = 3 seconds ;  &lt;math&gt;n_{pas}&lt;/math&gt; = 28,000 passengers per hour

This number is similar to the ones proposed by the [[Cabinentaxi]] system, although they predicted that actual use would be much lower.&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.washington.edu/jbs/itrans/big/Cabintaxi%20PRT-GRT%20Study.pdf "Communications on research ained at improving transport conditions in cities, towns and other built-up areas"], ''Forschung Stadtverkehr'', Issue 25 (1979)&lt;/ref&gt; Although PRTs have less passenger seating and speeds, their shorter headways dramatically improve passenger capacity. However, these systems are often constrained by brick-wall considerations for legal reasons, which limits their performance to a car-like 2 seconds. In this case:

: &lt;math&gt;n_{pas} = {3}\times \frac{3600}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;n_{pas}&lt;/math&gt; = 5,400 passengers per hour

==Headways and ridership==
Headways have an enormous impact on [[ridership]] levels above a certain critical waiting time. Following Boyle, the effect of changes in headway are directly proportional to changes in ridership by a simple conversion factor of 1.5. That is, if a headway is reduced from 12 to 10 minutes, the average rider wait time will decrease by 1 minute, the overall trip time by the same one minute, so the ridership increase will be on the order of 1 x 1.5 + 1 or about 2.5%.&lt;ref&gt;Boyle, pg. 13&lt;/ref&gt; Also see Ceder for an extensive discussion.&lt;ref&gt;Ceder, pg. 537-542&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''high efficiency glandless circulating pump''' is a component of a heating and air conditioning system that allows the system to perform with increased efficiency while significantly reducing the system's electrical usage. 

==Description==
It is primarily composed of an [[Brushless DC electric motor|electronically commutated synchronous motor]] (ECM) with a [[Permanent magnet synchronous generator|permanent magnet rotor]].&lt;ref&gt;(Rubik M., et al.(2005). Instalacje, gazowe, ogrzewcze, wentylacyjne i wodno-kanalizacyjne w budownictwie. Wydawnictwo Forum Sp. z o.o., Poznań; Chapter 5.14 Rubik M.: Pompy obiegowe w instalacjach c.o. i c.w.u.)(Polish language).&lt;/ref&gt; The ECM is a motor that converts a direct current (DC) from an electrical source into an alternating current (AC) which is sent to the motor itself, allowing for increased efficiency over standard AC motors. The permanent magnet rotor consists of an iron core, surrounded by multiple magnetic rare earth metals, and finally a metal sleeve that evenly spaces the magnets around the core, which helps to drive the motor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stark|first=William|title=Permanent Magnet Rotor|url=http://www.google.com/patents?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;vid=USPAT5563463&amp;id=y9UAAAAAEBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;dq=permanent+magnet+rotor+&amp;printsec=abstract#v=onepage&amp;q=permanent%20magnet%20rotor&amp;f=false|work=United States Patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; By utilizing multiple small improvements in pump-design technology such as a double pump in parallel system and variable controls, these pumps are able to run at about a 50% to 70% increased efficiency with up to an 80% decrease in electricity consumption over the previous standard design.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|title = Circulating Pumps|year = 2013|publisher = Wilo|pages = 10-14|url = http://www.majo.rs/page_files/page_97/A1-Glandless%20Pumps%20-%202009.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This pump has recently become the new standard in both commercial and residential buildings across the [[European Union]] due to a recent ordinance by the [[European Ecodesign Directive|European ErP (Eco-Design) Directive]]. The ErP directive began enforcing this new standard of regulation of these pumps January 1st, 2013 and will become even stricter on efficiency standards on August 1st, 2015 in order to meet the EU's goal of a 50% total reduction in the pump's energy usage by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=HIGH EFFICIENCY PUMPS A MUST FROM JANUARY 2013|journal=Builders Merchants Journal|date=January 2013|url=http://www.buildersmerchantsjournal.net/products/product.asp?id=1199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pump design ==
=== Primary factors ===
[[File:Pump diagram.PNG|thumb|Diagram of the different components that make up a standard high efficiency glandless circulating pump.]]
The primary design factors of a high efficiency glandless circulating pump include an electronically commutated synchronous motor, a permanent magnet rotor, and canned rotor technology. An electronically commutated synchronous motor is used to convert the energy current from a DC energy source into an AC current which is supplied to the drive motor. It utilizes the [[magnetomotive force]] which is generated by surface currents placed on the surfaces of the stator and rotor and the permanent magnets to generate the electric current which is in output to the drive motor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gottkehaskamp, Hartmann|first=Raimund, Alexander|title=Analytical Calculation Model of an Electronically Commutated Synchronous Motor Including Parasitic Effects|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?reload=true&amp;arnumber=6624080&amp;tag=1|publisher=IEEE}}&lt;/ref&gt; The canned rotor technology eliminates the need for a shaft seal that many conventional pumps must use through its unique design. Whereas standard pumps with shaft seals have multiple chambers with different rotating parts in each, canned rotor technology allows all of the rotating parts within the pump to exist in a single chamber. This increases the overall efficiency since the liquid used to lubricate the shaft bearings is also used to cool the motor.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The electronic components of the motor are attached outside this system by means of an encapsulated motor cartridge, which is an independent metal compartment used solely for housing the electronic components.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Secondary factors ===
Many minor factors of the pump's design including its double pump system and control options give it additional efficiency without sacrificing any of its performance. By using a double pump system together with variable and automatic control, the pump is able to decrease its energy consumption while increasing efficiency and reliability.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Using the pump's variable controls allows the pump to base its amount of energy consumption on how much it is actually performing, cutting down on usage during non-peak hours and extending the pump's life span.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book|title = OEM High Efficiency Circulation Pumps|year = 2013|publisher = Wilo|url = http://wilointec.com/cps/rde/xbcr/intec-en/Stratos_PARA_for_geothermal_energy_system.pdf|pages = 8-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The automatic controls allow the pump to follow a set schedule of how much energy to consume during specific hours, which allows building owners to cut down even further on electricity costs. By dividing the output into a double pump in parallel design, the system is able to greatly adapt to partial load conditions. This accounts for a significant increase in reliability and the 50% to 70% efficiency increase that these high efficiency pumps achieve.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Implementation ==
These types of pumps are used primarily in heating and air conditioning systems within both residential and commercial buildings such as offices and apartment complexes. The pump is the central component of these systems and accounts for most of the electricity usage within the system, making its design key to an increase in efficiency and decrease in energy consumption. Although the pump can be installed both inside and outside of buildings, many precautions must be taken in order to protect the pump from unfavorable weather conditions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These pumps are fairly simple to integrate into systems that follow the old standard since each pump is able to increase its efficiency by changing its design internally, meaning it will still fit into older systems without any problems requiring special adapters.

== Necessity ==
High efficiency glandless circulating pumps have become the industry standard when developing and maintaining buildings within the European Union due to recent changes to the carbon emissions goals. Commercial and residential buildings now have to be outfitted with these pumps in order to decrease electricity usage and, in the long run, decrease the amount of pollutants produced.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This new standard, referred to as the [[European Union energy label|energy efficiency index (EEI)]], will set the bare minimum efficiency level at 0.27, and set the efficiency grading scale from this base value.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The EU has also scheduled the efficiency scale to be revised again by August 1st, 2015 to set the minimum efficiency to 0.23. Various companies such as [[Wilo SE|Wilo]] have successfully developed pumps that have been projected to save up to 80% in electricity usage, meeting both of the new grading scale minimums set this year and in 2015.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Wilo high-efficiency glandless circulating pumps. |url=http://www.buildingtalk.com/plant-equipment-and-hire-/pumps-compressors-and-generators-/wilo-high-efficiency-glandless-circulating-pumps/403631.article |publisher=Building Talk |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113042620/http://www.buildingtalk.com/plant-equipment-and-hire-/pumps-compressors-and-generators-/wilo-high-efficiency-glandless-circulating-pumps/403631.article |archivedate=2013-11-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pump designs are still being revised to continually try to achieve higher efficiency standards and lower the impact on the environment in order to meet the goal of up to a 50% reduction in both CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions and electricity usage across the EU by 2020.

The '''history of printing in Poland''' began in the late 15th century, when following the creation of the [[Gutenberg Bible]] in 1455, printers from Western Europe spread the new craft abroad.

The Polish capital at the time was in [[Kraków]], where scholars, artists and merchants from Western Europe had already been present. Other cities which were part of the [[Kingdom of Poland (1385–1569)|Polish kingdom]] followed later. Cities of northern Polish province of [[Royal Prussia]],&lt;ref name="Stone"/&gt; like the [[Hanseatic League]] city of [[Danzig]] (Gdańsk), had established printing houses early on.

The first printing shop was possibly opened in Kraków by [[Augsburg]]-based [[Günther Zainer]] in 1465. In 1491, [[Schweipolt Fiol]] printed the first book in [[Cyrillic]] script.

The next recorded printing shop was a Dutch one known by the name ''Typographus Sermonum Papae Leonis I.'' that might have been established in 1473 on Polish territory, but its exact location has yet to be determined.&lt;ref name="Wieslaw Wydra 88"&gt;Wieslaw Wydra, "Die ersten in polnischer Sprache gedruckten Texte, 1475–1520", ''[[Gutenberg-Jahrbuch]]'', Vol. 62 (1987), pp.88–94 (88)&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest known print from Poland is considered to be the [[Almanach cracoviense ad annum 1474]] (Cracovian Almanac for the Year 1474)&lt;ref name="Wieslaw Wydra 88"/&gt; which is a single-sheet astronomical [[wall calendar]] for the year 1474 printed and published in 1473&lt;ref name=history2volumes&gt;{{en icon}} {{cite book | last=Davies|first=Norman| editor = | title = God's Playground: A History of Poland in Two Volumes |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b912JnKpYTkC |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=b912JnKpYTkC&amp;pg=PA118&amp;dq=%22Golden+Age%22+author:%22norman+davies%22&amp;sig=S0kmJEBWyWAXLdK7gGMzmSaZw-M| year = 2005 | publisher=Oxford University Press | location = Oxford  | isbn=0-19-925339-0 | pages = 118 | chapter=Anjou: The Hungarian Connection|volume=Vol. I| quote =}}&lt;/ref&gt;  by [[Kasper Straube]]. The only surviving copy of ''Almanach cracoviense'' measures 37&amp;nbsp;cm by 26.2&amp;nbsp;cm, and is in the collections of the [[Jagiellonian University]].

The first text in Polish language was printed in [[Breslau]] (Wrocław) in 1475.&lt;ref name="Stone"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Stone |first1=Daniel Z. |title=The Polish-Lithuanian state 1386-1795 |date=2001 |publisher=[[University of Washington Press]] |pages=30, 102|isbn=978-0295980935}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Old Prints Department - History of the collection |url=https://www.bu.uni.wroc.pl/en/departments/sand-island/old-prints-department-history-of-collection |website=bu.uni.wroc.pl |publisher=[[University of Wrocław|Wroclaw University Library]] |accessdate=12 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first book printed in Polish was ''[[Historyja umęczenia Pana naszego Jezusa Chrystusa]]'', published in 1508 by [[Johann Haller]]'s publishing house.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://krakowcityofliterature.com/city-of-literature/the-history-of-literature-in-krakow/|title=The history of literature in Krakow|last=|first=|date=|website=krakowcityofliterature.com|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-12-19}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For a long time, the first print written in [[Polish language]] was believed to be ''Hortulus Animae polonice'', a Polish version of [[Hortulus Animae]] written by [[Biernat of Lublin]], printed and published in 1513 by [[Florian Ungler]] in Kraków. The last known copy was lost during World War II.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} 

One of the first commercial printers in [[Poland]] is considered to be Johann Haller&lt;ref name=history2volumes/&gt; who worked in Kraków in the early 16th century (since 1505) who in 1509 printed [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] ''Theophilacti Scolastici Simocatti Epistole morales, rurales at amatoriae, interpretatione latina''.

Other well known early printers in Poland are:
* [[Hieronymus Vietor]] from [[Silesia]] who worked in [[Vienna]] and Kraków
* Printers from the [[Scharffenberg family]],
* [[Florian Ungler]]

In the late 16th century there were 7 printing shops in Kraków, and in 1610 10 printing shops. A decline started in around 1615. Due to this fact in 1650 there remained only 3 secular printing shops, accompanied by a few ecclesial ones.

Only one printing shop is recorded in [[Warszawa]] in 1707, owned by the [[Piarists]]. This situation improved during the realm of the last [[List of Polish monarchs|Polish king]], [[Stanisław August Poniatowski]], that marked political and cultural revival in Poland. Unfortunately his attempts to reform the state led to the [[Partitions of Poland]] carried out by [[Prussia]], Austria and [[Russia]].

A '''Lazy Susan''' is a turntable (rotating [[tray]]) placed on a [[table (furniture)|table]] or [[countertop]] to aid in distributing [[food]]. Lazy Susans may be made from a variety of materials but are usually [[glass]], [[wood]], or [[plastic]]. They are usually circular and placed in the center of a circular table to share dishes easily among diners. Owing to the nature of [[Chinese cuisine]], especially [[dim sum]], they are common at formal Chinese restaurants both on the [[mainland China|mainland]] and [[American Chinese cuisine|abroad]]. In Chinese, they are simply known as {{lang|zh|餐桌转盘}} ([[pinyin|p]]&amp;nbsp;''cānzhuō zhuànpán'') or "dinner-table turntables".

== History ==
It is likely that the explanation of the term ''Lazy Susan'' has been lost to history.&lt;ref name=quim&gt;[[Quinion, Michael]].

Accessed 11 Aug 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; {{ndash}} advertised in a 1917 ''[[Vanity Fair (American magazine 1913–1936)|Vanity Fair]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[Vanity Fair (American magazine 1913–1936)|Vanity Fair]]'', Vol. 9, No. 6.

Part of the mystery arises from the variety of devices that were grouped under the term ''dumb waiter'' (today written ''[[dumbwaiter]]''). An early 18th-century [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] article in ''[[The Gentleman's Magazine|The&amp;nbsp;Gentleman's Magazine]]'' describes how silent machines had replaced garrulous servants at some tables&lt;ref&gt;''Weekly Register'', No. 105. 15 Apr 1732. Op. cit. ''The Gentleman's Magazine: Or, Monthly Intelligencer'', "[https://books.google.com/books?id=X0UdAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA701 p. 701]". F. Jefferies (London), Apr. 1732. Accessed 11 Aug 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; and, by the 1750s, [[Christopher Smart]] was praising the "foreign" but discreet devices in verse.&lt;ref&gt;[[Smart, Christopher]]. ''[[Smart's Fables|Fables]]'': "[[s:Mrs. Abigail and the Dumb Waiter|Mrs. Abigail and the Dumb Waiter: Fable XV]]". 1755.&lt;/ref&gt; It is, however, almost certain that the devices under discussion were wheeled [[serving tray]]s similar to those introduced by [[Thomas Jefferson]] to the United States from [[Kingdom of France|France]],&lt;ref name=tj&gt;Monticello.org. "Rooms &amp; Furnishings: [http://www.monticello.org/site/house-and-gardens/dumbwaiters Dumbwaiters]". Accessed 11 Aug 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; where they were known as ''étagères''.&lt;ref name=tj/&gt; At some point during or before the 3rd quarter of the 18th century, the name dumb waiter also began to be applied to rotating trays.&lt;ref name=quim/&gt; (Jefferson never had a Lazy Susan at [[Monticello]] but he did construct a box-shaped rotating book stand and, as part of serving "in the French style", employed a revolving dining-room door whose reverse side supported a number of shelves.&lt;ref&gt;Monticello.org. "[http://www.monticello.org/site/jefferson/design-and-decor-convenience Design and Decor Convenience]". Accessed 11 Aug 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;) Finally, by the 1840s, Americans were applying the term to [[dumbwaiter (elevator)|small elevators carrying food between floors]] as well.&lt;ref name=quim/&gt; The success of [[George W. Cannon]]'s 1887 [[dumbwaiter (elevator)|mechanical dumbwaiter]] then popularized this usage, replacing the previous meanings of "dumbwaiter."

The Lazy Susan was initially uncommon enough in the United States for the [[utopia]]nist [[Oneida Community]] to be credited with its invention. They employed the devices as part of their practice of [[communalism]], making food easily and equally available to residents and visitors at meals.&lt;ref&gt;Popik, Barry. ''The Big Apple''. "[http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/lazy_susan/ Lazy Susan]". 6 Sept 2009&lt;/ref&gt; An American [[patent]] was issued in 1891 to Elizabeth Howell for "certain new and useful Improvements in Self-Waiting Tables". Howell's device ran more smoothly and did not permit [[bread crumbs]] to fall into the space between the Lazy Susan and the table.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Howell|first=Elizabeth|title=Patent No. 464,073|year=1891|publisher=United States Patent Office|location=Maryville, Missouri|url=http://www.google.com/patents?id=lRViAAAAEBAJ&amp;printsec=abstract&amp;zoom=4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite various [[folk etymology|folk etymologies]] linking the name to Jefferson and [[Thomas Edison|Edison]]'s daughters, the earliest use of these "serviettes" or "butler's assistants"&lt;ref&gt;''The Unpopular Review'', p. 73. Jan.&amp;ndash;Mar. 1919. Op. cit. Popik (2009).&lt;/ref&gt; being called a ''lazy Susan'' dates to the 1903 ''[[Boston Journal]]'':&lt;blockquote&gt;John B. Laurie, as the resuscitator of "Lazy Susan", seems destined to leap into fortune as an individual worker. "Lazy Susan" is a step toward solving the ever-vexing servant problem. She can be seen, but not heard, nor can she hear,&lt;!--sic--&gt; she simply minds her business and carries out your orders in a jiffy.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Laurie was a Scottish carpenter who made his "Lazy Susan" to the design of a [[Hingham, Massachusetts|Hingham]]-area lady; finishing the device too late for her to present it as a gift, Laurie received an abusive tirade and then, asked for the price, "told her it wasn’t for sale, though of course it is".&lt;ref&gt;''Boston Journal'', p. 3. "Hingham Indian Maidens Revive Ancient Arts: Lazy Susan, Dumb Waitress". 8 Nov. 1903. Op. cit. Popik (2009).&lt;/ref&gt; The name was repeated in a 1911 ''Idaho Statesman'' article {{ndash}} which describes it as "a cousin to the &lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;curate's assistant&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;, as the English muffin stand is called"&lt;ref&gt;''Idaho Statesman'', p. 5. "An Ideal Servant: 'Lazy Susan' Works Hard and Never Talks Back" 30 Oct. 1911. Op. cit. Popik (2009).&lt;/ref&gt; {{ndash}} and again in the 1912 ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'', which calls the "silver" Lazy Susan "the characteristic feature of the self-serving dinner table".&lt;ref&gt;''Christian Science Monitor''. "Giving an Automatic Dinner". 25 Sept. 1912. Op. cit. Quinion (2010).&lt;/ref&gt; By the next year, the ''Lima Daily News'' described an Ohioan "inaugurat[ing] ... the 'Lazy Susan' method of serving".&lt;ref&gt;''Lima Daily News''. 31 Dec. 1913. Op. cit. Quinion (2010).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henry Ford]] used an enormous one on his camping trips in the 1920s to avoid bringing a full contingent of servants along with his guests.&lt;ref name=LAT/&gt; In 1933, the term was added to the [[Webster's Dictionary]].&lt;ref&gt;''Orlando Sentinel''. "[http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1996-06-01/business/9605290796_1_lazy-susan-susan-story-adaptation A Turn Through History With The Lazy Susan]". Accessed 15 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unusually, the 1916 ''[[American Cookery]]'' describes the device as a [[German Empire|German]] invention:
&lt;blockquote&gt;There is a table arrangement used much in Germany, which has now found its way to America, though it is still by no means common. The German ''frau'' calls it "Lazy Susan", but it is entirely different from our product used for salt and pepper shakers. Its only point of similarity is the swivel upon which it turns. The one which joys my heart is of mahogany, and it turns automatically at the slightest touch. It contains seven china dishes, six of which are trapezoids, the center one being octagonal. The trapezoids fit about the center octagon, forming a perfect whole.&lt;ref&gt;''American Cookery'', p. 105. Aug.&amp;ndash;Sept. 1916. Op. cit. Popik (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By 1918, ''Century Magazine'' was already describing the Lazy Susan as out of fashion,&lt;ref&gt;''Century Magazine'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=UnkJzhnXgn8C&amp;pg=PA396&amp;dq=%22lazy+susan%22 p. 396]. Jan. 1918. Accessed 11 Aug 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; but beginning in the 1950s its popularity soared once again after the redesign and reintroduction of the Lazy Susan by George Hall, an engineer, soy-sauce manufacturer, and partner in popular San Francisco-area Chinese restaurants ([[Johnny Kan]]'s and Ming's of Palo Alto), and the rotating tray became ubiquitous in Chinese restaurants, and was used in homes around the globe.&lt;ref&gt;Smithsonian Magazine, http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/lazy-susan-classic-centerpiece-chinese-resturants-neither-classic-nor-chinese-180949844/&lt;/ref&gt; The decline in America's [[domestic worker|domestic service]] sector after [[World War I]] and its collapse following [[World War II]],&lt;ref&gt;Graff, Daniel.

Accessed 11 Aug 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; combined with the post-war [[Baby Boom]], led to a great demand for them in US households across the country in the 1950s and '60s. This popularity has had the effect, however, of making them seem [[kitsch]] in subsequent decades.&lt;ref name=LAT&gt;Levine, Bettijane. ''The Los Angeles Times''. ''L.A. at Home''.

==Other uses==
A Lazy Susan may be employed as a cake turntable for [[cake decorating]].

Smaller Lazy Susans are used for [[spice rack]]s and rotating [[TV]] or [[computer monitor|monitor]] platforms.

By [[analogy]], the term "Lazy Susan" is sometimes applied to [[Cabinet (furniture)|cabinet]]s (especially corner cabinets) whose circular shelves rotate around a vertical axle to allow easy access to a greater area of space. Such corner cabinets cut out a quarter of the circle to permit two "doors" to be mounted at [[right angle]]s to one another. These are especially common in [[Kitchen cabinet|kitchen cabinets]].

The term is also infrequently used for the much-older [[turntable]]s employed in [[pottery wheel]]s and related tasks like sculpture, modeling, repair work, etc.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Navy. Safety Center. "[http://safetycenter.navy.mil/success/stories/101-150/134-Lazy_Susan_FRC_East.pdf Fleet Readiness Center (FRC) East Uses Lazy Susan Design to Prevent Work Related Musculoskeletal Disorders] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090822015428/http://safetycenter.navy.mil/success/stories/101-150/134-Lazy_Susan_FRC_East.pdf |date=2009-08-22 }}".&lt;/ref&gt;

A Lazy Susan can be placed under a game-board, such as [[Scrabble]], improving usability of editions that lack a built-in turntable.

'''Lift-off''' process in [[microtechnology|microstructuring technology]] is a method of creating structures (patterning) of a target material on the surface of a substrate (e.g. [[Wafer (electronics)|wafer]]) using a sacrificial material (e.g., [[Photoresist]]).
It is an additive technique as opposed to more traditional subtracting technique like [[Etching (microfabrication)|etching]].
The scale of the structures can vary from the [[nanoscale]] up to the centimeter scale or further, but are typically of [[Micrometre|micrometric dimensions]].

== Process ==
[[Image:Lift-off (microtechnology) process.svg|right|thumb|
Lift-off process steps:

I. Preparation of the substrate &lt;br /&gt;
II. Deposition of the sacrificial stencil layer &lt;br /&gt;
III. Patterning the sacrificial layer (ex. etching), creating an inverse pattern &lt;br /&gt;
IV. Deposition of the target material &lt;br /&gt;
V. Washing out the sacrificial layer together with the target material on its surface &lt;br /&gt;
VI. Final pattern

Layers: &lt;br /&gt;
1) Substrate &lt;br /&gt;
2) Sacrificial layer &lt;br /&gt;
3) Target material]]

An inverse pattern is first created in the sacrificial stencil layer (ex. [[photoresist]]), deposited on the surface of the substrate. This is done by etching openings through the layer so that the target material can reach the surface of the substrate in those regions, where the final pattern is to be created. The target material is deposited over the whole area of the wafer, reaching the surface of the substrate in the etched regions and staying on the top of the sacrificial layer in the regions, where it was not previously etched. When the sacrificial layer is washed away (photoresist in a [[solvent]]), the material on the top is lifted-off and washed together with the sacrificial layer below. After the lift-off, the target material remains only in the regions where it had a direct contact with the substrate.

* Substrate is prepared
* Sacrificial layer is deposited and an inverse pattern is created (ex. [[photoresist]] is exposed and developed. Depending on the resist various methods can be used, such as [[Extreme ultraviolet lithography]] - EUVL or [[Electron beam lithography]] - EBL. The photoresist is removed in the areas, where the target material is to be located, creating an inverse pattern.)
* Target material (usually a thin metal layer) is deposited (on the whole surface of the wafer). This layer covers the remaining resist as well as parts of the wafer that were cleaned of the resist in the previous developing step.
* The rest of the sacrificial material (ex. photoresist) is washed out together with parts of the target material covering it, only the material that was in the "holes" having direct contact with the underlying layer (substrate/wafer) stays

== Advantages ==
Lift-off is applied in cases where a direct etching of structural material would have undesirable effects on the layer below. Lift-off is a cheap alternative to etching in a research context, which permits a slower turn-around time. Finally, lifting off a material is an option if there is no access to an etching tool with the appropriate gases.

== Disadvantages ==
There are 3 major problems with lift-off:
;Retention
:This is the worst problem for liftoff processes. If this problem occurs, unwanted parts of the metal layer will remain on the wafer. This can be caused by different situations. The resist below the parts that should have been lifted off could not have dissolved properly. Also, it is possible that the metal has adhered so well to the parts that should remain that it prevents lift-off.
;Ears
:When the metal is deposited, and it covers the sidewalls of the resist, "ears" can be formed. These are made of the metal along the sidewall which will be standing upwards from the surface. Also, it is possible that these ears will fall over on the surface, causing an unwanted shape on the substrate.
If the ears remain on the surface, the risk remains that these ears will go through different layers put on top of the wafer and they might cause unwanted connections.
;Redeposition
:During the liftoff process it is possible that particles of metal will become reattached to the surface, at a random location. It is very difficult to remove these particles after the wafer has dried.

== Use ==
Lift-off process is used mostly to create metallic interconnections. &lt;br&gt;
There are several types of lift-off processes, and what can be achieved depends highly on the actual process being used. Very fine structures have been used using [[Electron beam lithography|EBL]], for instance. The lift-off process can also involve multiple layers of different types of resist. This can for instance be used to create shapes that will prevent side walls of the resist being covered in the metal deposition stage.

[[Image:Feeder mice.jpg|250px|thumb|"Pinkie" [[mouse|mice]] for sale as live food for [[reptile]]s]]
'''Live food''' is [[life|living]] [[food]] for [[carnivore|carnivorous]] or [[omnivore|omnivorous]] [[animal]]s kept in [[captivity (animal)|captivity]]; in other words, small animals such as [[insect]]s or [[mouse|mice]] fed to larger carnivorous or omnivorous species kept in either in a [[zoo]] or as [[pet]]. 

Live food is commonly used as feed for a variety of species of exotic pets and zoo animals, ranging from [[alligator]]s to various [[snake]]s, [[frog]]s and [[lizard]]s, but also including other, non-[[reptile]], non-[[amphibian]] carnivores and omnivores (for instance, [[pet skunk|skunks]], which are omnivorous [[mammal]]s, can be technically be fed a limited amount of live food, though this is not known to be a common practice). Common live food ranges from [[cricket (insect)|cricket]]s (used as an inexpensive form of feed for carnivorous and omnivorous reptiles such as [[bearded dragon]]s and commonly available in [[pet store]]s for this reason), [[waxworm]]s, [[mealworms]] and to a lesser extent [[cockroach]]es and [[locust]]s, to small [[bird]]s and [[mammal]]s such as mice or [[chicken]]s. 

==Variety of live food ==
Live foods commonly available are [[cricket (insect)|crickets]] (both ''[[Gryllus bimaculatus]]'' and ''[[Acheta domesticus]]'' commonly), [[waxworm]]s (''[[Galleria mellonella]]''), [[mealworm]]s (''[[Tenebrio molitor]]''), [[Zophobas morio|Superworm]]s (''[[Zophobas morio]]'') and [[locusts]] (a number of species are seen commonly). There are however many more species used such as [[butter worm]]s, [[phoenix worms]], a variety of cockroach species, [[silkworms]] and more. [[Insect]] species are most commonly used to feed small [[reptile]]s and [[amphibian]]s.

Another common form of live food, most commonly used to feed [[snake]]s, is small [[rodent]]s. The most commonly known small rodent used for live food is likely the [[mouse]]; many pet stores which carry snakes or cater to snake owners also carry "feeder mice" for this reason (see ''[[Fancy mouse]]''). It is also common to feed reptiles freshly killed or frozen/thawed rodents as most reptiles will readily accept them.

Creatures that are the most common choices for live foods, ranging from feeder mice to crickets and mealworms, generally are bred and raised in captivity themselves, and can often be found both through local pet stores and from [[wholesaler]]s or "farms" that breed them specifically for live food sales.

==Animals commonly fed live food==
Animals that are commonly fed live food include [[bearded dragon]]&lt;ref&gt;https://buddygenius.com/bearded-dragon-eat/&lt;/ref&gt; and other lizards, various types of [[snake]], turtles, and carnivorous fish, though other animals, such as [[skunk]]s (which are sometimes kept [[pet skunk|as pets]]), being omnivorous, can also eat some live food, though it is unknown how common this is in practice.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4106">In [[telecommunications]], a '''mode scrambler''' '''mode mixer''' is a device for inducing [[mode coupling]] in an [[optical fiber]], or a device that, itself, exhibits a uniform output intensity profile independent of the input mode volume or modal excitation condition. Mode scramblers are used to provide a [[modal distribution]] that is independent of the [[optical source]] for purposes of laboratory, manufacturing, or field measurements or tests. Mode scramblers are primarily used to improve reproducibility of multimode fiber bandwidth measurements.

If multimode fiber bandwidth is measured using a laser diode directly coupled to its input, the resulting measurement can vary by as much as an order of magnitude. This measurement variability is due to the combination of differences in laser output characteristics (emitted mode power distribution) and the differential mode delay of the fiber. Differential mode delay is the difference in the time delays amongst the fiber's propagating modes caused by imperfections or nonideality of the fiber refractive index profile.

The primary purpose of a mode scrambler is to create a uniform, [[overfill]]ed launch condition that can be easily reproduced on multiple measurement systems, so that measurement systems have essentially the same launch conditions and can measure approximately the same bandwidth despite having different laser sources. These were used for this purpose in the first U.S. NIST round-robins on multimode fiber.&lt;ref name="nist"&gt;http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/sp958-lide/297-299.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The overfilled launch (OFL) was created to reduce measurement variability, and improve concatenation estimates for multimode fibers, used at that time for telecom 'long haul' (e.g., 7–10 km 850 nm or 20–30 km 1300 nm) systems.&lt;ref name="nist"/&gt;

When the telecom industry converted to near-exclusive use of single-mode fiber ca. 1984, multimode fiber was re-purposed for use in LANs, such as Fiber Distributed Date Interface (FDDI), then under development.  The output modal power distribution of a mode scrambler is similar to the surface-emitters used in those first LAN transmitters, but this was fortuitous coincidence.  On average, but not in every case, the OFL bandwidth measured using a mode scrambler is lower than that produced by excitation of a partial mode volume (restricted mode launch or RML), such as occurs with directly coupled laser diodes.

There are two common types of mode scramblers: the "Step-Graded-Step" (S-G-S) and the "step index with bends". The S-G-S mode scrambler is actually an assembly, a fusion-spliced concatenation of a step-index profile, a graded-index profile and another step-index profile fiber. &lt;ref&gt;https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/d2/08/c7/9eb780e387fdbb/US4229067.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, each segment is approximately 1 meter long, and may use segments of unconventional size to produce the distribution required according to core size of fiber to be tested.  Unconventional fiber size was not an issue, as they were developed by fiber manufacturers, but some test equipment has difficulty complying with revised qualification standards, and now use "Step Index with Bends" mode scramblers, which can be adjusted to purpose. Step Index with Bend mode scramblers are created simply by routing a specially designed step-index multimode fiber through a series of small radius bends, or by compressing fiber against surfaces with specific roughness.  The implementations are simple, but generally less reproducible, and require care to avoid over-stressing the fiber.

A mode scrambler can be characterized and qualified by measuring its near-field and far-field distributions, as well as by measuring one of these distributions while restricting the other. Guidelines for constructing a mode scrambler and qualifying its output can be found in the ANSI/TIA/EIA-455-54 fiber optic test procedure ('''FOTP''').

A '''motorized tricycle''', '''motor trike''', or '''three-wheeled motorcycle''' is a [[three-wheeled]] vehicle based on the same technology as a bicycle or motorcycle, and powered by an [[electric motor]], [[motorcycle engine|motorcycle]], scooter or car engine.
[[File:tricycle.yellow.arp.jpg|thumb|360px|Motorized trike in [[Bristol]], England]]

==Classification==
Depending on the design of the vehicle, a motorized trike may be categorized as a motorcycle,  [[motor scooter]], or simply the three-wheeled counterpart to a [[Motorized bicycle|motorized]] or [[electric bicycle]]. The main difference between a motorcycle trike and a scooter trike is that motorcycles are sat on in a "saddle"-style seating (as with a horse), with the legs apart, and motorcycles have manual transmissions. Scooters have a "step-through" seating style, in which the driver sits on a more chair-like seat, with the legs together; as well, scooters have automatic transmissions. Laypersons often associate the engine size as a dividing line between motorcycles and scooters,{{cn|date=May 2018}} since a typical scooter has a small 50 cc engine, but scooter engines can also be as large as 650cc as used in the [[Suzuki Burgman]].

Motorcycles with sidecars are not usually considered tricycles. It can be harder to categorize three-wheeled automobiles. While some early prototype automobiles were [[steam tricycle]]s, three-wheeled cars such as the [[Morgan 3-Wheeler]] are often classified as cars rather than motorcycles. Generally, the motorcycle classification will require passengers to sit behind the driver, whereas in the car classification, at least one passenger is able to sit abreast to the driver.

==Motorcycle tricycles==
[[File:Reverse-trike-tim-shockley-st-louis-hondahoot2007.jpg|thumb|Reverse trike]]
[[File: Campagna T-Rex 14-R rear left.jpg|thumb|T-Rex motorized reverse trike]]
{{see also|Electric trike}}
A motorized tricycle's wheels may be arranged in either configuration: delta or tadpole. A delta trike has one wheel in front and two in back, and the tadpole trike has two wheels in front and one in back.  Occasionally, rear wheel steering is used, although this increases the turning circle and can affect handling (the geometry is similar to a regular trike operating in reverse, but with a steering damper added).  

Tadpoles are more stable under braking and more likely to slide instead of roll; front braking hard on a delta requires the vehicle to steer almost straight to avoid tipping.  The balance of friction patches and rolling resistance also means that tadpoles tend to oversteer and deltas understeer.

Motor trikes are attractive for those with mobility or balance problems.

Under some local regulations, while riding a three-wheeled vehicle, it may be possible to carry multiple passengers with a motorcycle driving license, to ride a motorcycle-style vehicle with a car license, or to avoid motorcycle helmet use regulations.

These machines are generally custom-built.  A common arrangement is to fit [[Chopper (motorcycle)|chopper]]-style ("ape hanger") front forks to a [[VW Beetle]] [[Volkswagen air-cooled engine|engine]] and transaxle, popular because it is largely self-contained on a single [[subframe]]. Similarly, the engine, transmission and rear wheel may be taken from a large motorcycle as a single unit, and used in the construction of a tadpole trike.

Mass-manufactured motor tricycles include the [[Piaggio MP3]]; the [[Piaggio]] [[Piaggio Ape|Ape]] (Italian for ''Bee'') delivery trike (delta); the [[Harley-Davidson Tri Glide Ultra Classic]]; the [[Bombardier Recreational Products]] [[BRP Can-Am Spyder Roadster|Can-Am Spyder]] (tadpole); the [[Polaris Industries|Polaris]] [[Polaris Slingshot|Slingshot]] (tadpole); the [[T-Rex (automobile)|T-Rex]] reverse trike; trikes used by municipal authorities in the USA; and, historically, vehicles such as the [[Scammell]] Scarab railway dray, a common sight around post-war British railway stations.

==Motorized freight trikes==

In Asian and Southeast Asian countries, motorized trikes are used as small freight trucks and commercial vehicles. Nicknamed "three-wheelers" or "tuk-tuks" in popular parlance, they are a motorized version of the traditional [[pulled rickshaw]] or [[cycle rickshaw]]. While they are mostly used as taxis for hire, they are also used for commercial and freight deliveries. They are particularly popular in cities where [[traffic congestion]] is a problem.

They usually have a sheet-metal body or open frame that rests on three wheels, a canvas roof with drop-down sides, a small cabin in the front of the vehicle for the driver, an air-cooled scooter version of a [[Two-stroke cycle|two-stroke engine]], with [[Motorcycle handlebar|handlebar]] controls instead of a [[steering wheel]].
The smaller motorized trikes are used as delivery vehicles for lighter loads. The larger trikes, with more powerful engines, have larger cargo bays, and they can carry freight within a city.

===China===
[[File:Qufu - Gogobike - P1060307.JPG|thumb|Light motor tricycles for sale in [[Shandong, China]]]]
Motorized three-wheel freight vehicles are a common sight throughout China. They come in various sizes, from open saddle-style trikes to 'three-wheel trucks' with a fully closed cabin.

===Philippines===
{{main|Motorized tricycle (Philippines)}}
In the Philippines, a "motorbike and sidecar" is called a tricycle. They are commonly used as a [[public utility vehicle]] and for personal transportation.

===India===
Since 2012, electric tricycles known as e-rickshaws have become popular, replacing other commercial transports. For vehicles other than [[electric rickshaw]]s, various locally made configurations are used in India. They fall under the category of [[Jugaad]] and serve as both passenger and commercial vehicles. The motorized versions are popular for their low cost, because they are put together from salvaged motorcycles and often do not require the operator to have a drivers license.

'''NextGenPower''' is an integrated project which aims to demonstrate new alloys and coatings in boiler, turbine and interconnecting pipework.  The concept of NextGenPower is to perform innovative demonstrations that will significantly contribute to the [[European Union|EU]] target to increase the efficiency in existing and new build pulverized coal power plants.

==Background==
[[Carbon Capture and Storage]] (CCS) is envisaged to be the main transition technology to comply with the CO2 reduction targets set by the [[European Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nextgenpower.eu/images/Documents/nextgenpower_brochure.pdf  NextGenPower Brochure]&lt;/ref&gt; However, CCS has the drawback that the electrical efficiency of the coal-fired power plant will drop significantly. The efficiency loss caused by CCS in coal-fired power plants will range from 4 to 12% points, depending on the CCS technology chosen.
To overcome this drawback, one has to increase the plant efficiency or the share of [[biomass]] co-firing. Both options are limited due to the quality of the current available coatings and materials. Live steam temperatures well in excess of 700°C are necessary to compensate the efficiency loss caused by CCS and to achieve a net efficiency of 45%.
NextGenPower aims to develop and demonstrate coatings and materials that can be applied in ultra-supercritical (in excess of 700˚C) conditions.

==Summary==
The NextGenPower project was due to start on 1 May 2010 and have a duration of 48 months.  The budget is €10.3million, with an EU contribution making up €6million of the budget.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nextgenpower.eu/  NextGenPower]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objectives==
The following scientific and technological objectives have been defined for NextGenPower, leading to the following project activities:
*Demonstrating the application of precipitation hardened [[Nickel]]-alloys for [[pulverized coal-fired boiler]]s having allowable levels of creep and fatigue evolving from high temperatures envisaged with USC
*Demonstrating the application of cost-effective fireside coatings, compatible with affordable and available tube alloys, for coal-fired boilers capable of withstanding the corrosive conditions envisaged with USC and the environment of biomass co-firing under different conditions
*Demonstrating the application of cost-effective steam side coatings/protective layers to extend the life of boiler tube and interconnecting pipe work, and to facilitate the use of cheaper alternative materials without compromising component life or reliability
*Demonstrating the application of Ni-alloys for interconnecting pipe work between boiler and [[steam turbine]] withstanding high temperatures envisaged with USC and to explore alternative design options to allow for the use of cheaper, more available materials than Ni-alloys
*Demonstrating the capability to [[castings|cast]], [[forging|forge]] and [[welding|weld]] Ni-alloys for critical steam turbine components

==Sub-projects==
There are also four sub-projects which will be focused on throughout the course of the NextGenPower project.

===Sub Project 1 – boiler===
NextGenPower aims at overcoming fireside corrosion and steamside [[oxidation]] in high temperature parts through the application of suitable coatings. The main goal for Sub Project 1 is to demonstrate the benefits and limitations of materials and coatings for the fireside under biomass co-firing conditions as well as for the boiler and main steam pipework under USC and current steam conditions.

===Sub Project 2 - steam turbine===
The main goals for Sub Project 2 are to select the best candidate alloys for the HP and ID steam turbines operating at high steam temperatures (≥720˚C).   A number of nickel-base alloys have been developed whose properties have  been proven at the laboratory scale and for small-scale components. The main uncertainty in the application of these alloys for steam turbine applications is the ability to manufacture, weld and inspect large components. The performance in service presents a much smaller risk since there is confidence that the mechanical behaviour can be modelled on the basis of the material properties. This philosophy follows the approach applied in the development, demonstration and exploitation of materials technology for 700-720˚C steam turbines in other projects ([[AD700]], [[AD700#Phase 3 - COMTES 700|COMTES]], EON 50plus) where the first commercial steam turbine will enter service without prior operation in a test loop. Following alloy selection, full-scale steam turbine casings and rotor forgings will be manufactured and materials properties demonstrated through implementation of a mechanical testing programme. Full-scale demonstration of the welding technology and the NDE capability required for welded rotor and casing manufacture will also be carried out.

===Sub Project 3 – integration===
Sub Project 3 provides a framework for the testing and demonstration work in the overall project.  It will review the expected operating parameters required for NGP plants, with and without CO2 capture technologies, and with and without biomass co-firing. The aim is to evaluate a series of NextGenPower plants with CCS systems in terms of their power generation efficiencies and CO2 emissions per unit of electricity generated.

===Sub Project 4 – dissemination===
The main goal for Sub Project 4 is to ensure that the generic results and results from topical activities are actively disseminated. It promotes results and approaches and encourages the duplication in other, thereby contributing to EU objectives of the CO2 reduction, efficiency improvement and security of energy supply. Another objective is to facilitate the sharing of policies, approaches and knowledge between the participants.

'''''Now the Chips are Down''''' is a 1978 [[television documentary]] about the importance and influence of [[microprocessor]]s within the British economy. It was aired by the [[BBC]] as part of its ''[[Horizon (BBC TV series)|Horizon]]'' series.

The programme was instrumental in raising general awareness within the UK about microprocessors.

== Synopsis ==
The documentary is a report on the "applications and implications"&lt;ref name="bufvc" /&gt; of [[microprocessor]]s to [[employment]] within the British economy.&lt;ref name="MitterRowbotham2004" /&gt;

== Production ==

The documentary was produced by [[BBC Television]] as part of its 1978 ''[[Horizon (BBC TV series)|Horizon]]'' series.&lt;ref name="bufvc" /&gt; It was narrated by British radio and television presenter [[Paul Vaughan]].&lt;ref name="bufvc" /&gt;

== Reception ==

Science historian [[Robert M. Young (academic)|Robert M. Young]] wrote in 1981 that the programme played an "important part" in raising awareness about microprocessors within government and the general public.&lt;ref name="University1981" /&gt;

=== Consequences ===

Britain's lagging place in the worldwide technology race was widely acknowledged after the documentary was screened.&lt;ref name="Forester1987" /&gt; The UK government launched the [[Microelectronics Education Programme]] in 1981, with a budget of more than {{nowrap|£10 million}}.&lt;ref name="Forester1987" /&gt; This included nationwide discounts on computers to schools and colleges, and was followed by government backing of the BBC's [[BBC Computer Literacy Project|Computer Literacy Project]].&lt;ref name="Forester1987" /&gt; Funding for related education schemes continued until 1988.&lt;ref name="Forester1987" /&gt;

The European [http://www.itea-office.org/ ITEA ''2''] research project '''OSAMI''' ('''O'''pen '''S'''ource '''AM'''bient '''I'''ntelligence) targets [[Open Source|open source]] common foundations for a dynamic [[Service-oriented architecture|service-oriented]] platform which is able to personalize itself in large diversity of cooperating [[Software Intensive Systems]] (SIS).

According to the vision of this project the relationship between humans, computers and electronic devices has evolved rapidly, defining technology eras with shifts in the related information technology (IT) business leadership. From the one-to-many relationship – computer versus human users – in the enterprise during the mainframe era in the 1960s, computers moved to the family environment with the personal computer (PC) in the 1980s. With the mobile phone, they established a personal one-to-one relationship ten years later.

The emergence of [[Ambient intelligence|Ambient Intelligence]] is consequence of moving to a one-to-many relationship with phone complements, WiFi routers, gaming consoles, MP3 players, set-top boxes (STBs), TVs and infrastructures with impressive computing and storage capabilities. This environment is an enabler for a new concept of global and transversal platform that will exploit the real potential of the network affecting all business areas.

In this convergence process, the [[Ambient intelligence|Ambient Intelligence]] can be defined as an automated service provider embedding the devices. The [[Ambient intelligence|Ambient Intelligence]] platform will be able to personalise itself dynamically in devices according to the context (i.e. physical containers, user needs and environment). The consortium shares the vision of this platform emerging from a community process. The software infrastructure is progressively embedding users in a virtual world. In the long term, everyone will contribute as individual and community playing service-provider and consumer roles. This interaction will lead the evolution of the platform.

The global ITEA OSAMI project consists of a number of networked national sub-projects focussing on different areas from common technology foundations.

The '''Philippine Science High School System''' is a specialized public high school system in the [[Philippines]] that operates as an attached agency of the Philippine [[Department of Science and Technology (Philippines)|Department of Science and Technology]]. PSHS is considered as the top science high school in the Philippines and is viewed to be among the best in the ASEAN region by 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rappler.com/science-nature/society-culture/68344-philippine-science-high-school-changing-times A 'Pisay' for changing times], Rappler&lt;/ref&gt;

The PSHS System offers scholarships to Filipino students who are gifted in the sciences and mathematics. Admission to the PSHS is by competitive examination, and only [[Philippines|Filipino]] citizens are eligible to attend. Graduates of the PSHS are bound by law to major in the pure and applied sciences, mathematics, or engineering on entering college. The system is known to have a very challenging curriculum which produces the best professionals in the country.

PSHS is known for its active participation in national and international science, technology, and mathematics competitions such as Sipnayan, Kapnayan, MATHirang MATHibay, Metrobank-MTAP-DepEd Math Challenge, Philippine Mathematics, Physics, and Chemistry Olympiads, [[Australian Mathematics Competition]] and Australian Chemistry Quiz. Through private funding, students successfully reap awards in international competitions such as the Taiwan International Science and Engineering Fair, [[Intel International Science and Engineering Fair]], [[International Math Olympiad]], International Junior Science Olympiad, International Earth Science Olympiad, International Olympiad on Astronomy and Astrophysics, and [[International Physics Olympiad]].

A movie was released in 2007 in honor of Philippine Science High School. ''Pisay'' got national&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cinemalaya.org/fnl_archives_2007.htm Cinemalaya Archives 2007] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720153406/http://www.cinemalaya.org/fnl_archives_2007.htm |date=July 20, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and international recognition as it was sent to the [[Toronto International Film Festival]]. ''Pisay'' was directed by an alumnus of the school, Auraeus Solito, and was nominated for Best Documentary Feature Film at the 2008 [[Asia Pacific Screen Awards]].

==Campuses and system organization==

===Campuses===
For 24 years, the PSHS was a single campus on Agham Road, Diliman, Quezon City where the top 240 examinees in the National Competitive Examination held yearly were accepted as government scholars. All campuses have at most 30 students in each class. However, regional campuses only have three classes in contrast to the main campus which has eight classes per batch. Currently, PSHS has 15 regional campuses in addition to the main campus.

===System organization===
The Board of Trustees (BOT) is the highest policy making body of the PSHS System. The Executive Committee (ExeCom), composed of the directors of different PSHS campuses, is a collegial body that recommends policies and guidelines for the consideration of the BOT. The Executive Committee is chaired by the Executive Director, who coordinates the implementation of these policies and guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pshs.edu.ph/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=28&amp;Itemid=42 System Organization] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100309183819/http://www.pshs.edu.ph/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=28&amp;Itemid=42 |date=March 9, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; PSHS campuses are headed by directors who are members of the ExeCom.

==History==
The Philippine Science High School was established through Republic Act 3661, authored by Congressman [[Virgilio Afable]], and signed into law in 1963 by President [[Diosdado Macapagal]]. This charter mandates the PSHS “to offer on a free scholarship basis a secondary course with emphasis on subjects pertaining to service with the end in view of preparing its students for a science career”. The school started operations in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pshs.edu.ph/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=13&amp;Itemid=29 The History of PSHS System] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100309183814/http://www.pshs.edu.ph/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=13&amp;Itemid=29 |date=March 9, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

National scientist Dr. Gregorio Velasquez led the PSHS through its first three years. The campus started in a small rented GSIS-owned property along the Quezon Memorial Circle. In 1970 PSHS started building on a 75,000 square metre lot along Agham Road in Diliman, Quezon City.

By the end of the 1980s, PSHS started to spread across the nation. The first regional campuses were built, starting with the Mindanao Campus (now Southern Mindanao Campus), in Davao City, in 1988.

The PSHS System Law (R.A. 8496) was signed by President [[Fidel V. Ramos]] in 1997 that established the PSHS System and unified all the existing campuses into a single system of governance and management. Thus, the PSHS continues fulfilling its mandate “to offer, on a free scholarship basis, a secondary course with special emphasis on subjects pertaining to the sciences, with the end view of preparing its students for a science career”.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6943">A '''Position Sensitive Device''' and/or '''Position Sensitive Detector''' (PSD) is an '''optical position sensor''' (OPS), that can measure a position of a light spot in one or two-dimensions on a sensor surface.

== Principles ==
PSDs can be divided into two classes which work according to different principles: In the first class, the sensors have an [[isotropic]] sensor surface that supplies continuous position data. The second class has discrete sensors in an raster-like structure on the sensor surface that supply local discrete data.

=== Isotropic Sensors ===
[[Image:Position Sensitive Device EN.svg|thumb|Design of a PSD using a [[PIN diode]]]]
The technical term PSD was first used in a 1957 publication by J.T. Wallmark for ''lateral [[photoelectric effect]] '' used for local measurements. On a laminar semiconductor, a so-called [[PIN diode]] is exposed to a tiny spot of light. This exposure causes a change in local resistance and thus electron flow in four electrodes. From the currents &lt;math&gt;I_a&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;I_b&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;I_c&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;I_d&lt;/math&gt; in the electrodes, the location of the light spot is computed using the following equations.
:&lt;math&gt;
x = k_x \cdot \frac{I_b - I_d}{I_b + I_d} 
&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;
y = k_y \cdot \frac{I_a - I_c}{I_a + I_c} 
&lt;/math&gt;

The &lt;math&gt;k_x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k_y&lt;/math&gt; are simple scaling factors, which permit transformation into coordinates.
 
An advantage of this process is the continuous measurement of the light spot position with measuring rates up to over 100&amp;nbsp;kHz.  The dependence of local measurement on form and size of the light spot as well as the nonlinear connection are a disadvantage that can be partly compensated by special electrode shapes. 

==== 2-D tetra-lateral Position Sensitive Device (PSD) ====
[[File:2D Position Sensitive Device.png|thumb|right|2-D tetra-lateral position sensitive device (PSD)]]

A 2-D tetra-lateral PSD is capable of providing continuous
position measurement of the incident light spot in 2-D. It consists of a single square [[PIN diode]] with a resistive layer. When there is an incident light on the active area of the sensor, photocurrents are generated and collected from four electrodes placed along each side of the square near the boundary. The incident light position can be estimated based on currents collected from the electrodes: 

:&lt;math&gt;
x = k_x \cdot \frac{I_4 - I_3}{I_4+ I_3} 
&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;
y = k_y \cdot \frac{I_2 - I_1}{I_2 + I_1} 
&lt;/math&gt;
 
The 2-D tetra-lateral PSD has the advantages of fast response, much lower dark current, easy bias application and lower fabrication cost. Its measurement accuracy and resolution is independent of the spot shape and size unlike the quadrant detector which could be easily changed by air turbulence. However, it suffers from the nonlinearity problem. While the position estimate is approximately linear with respect to the real position when the spot is in the center area of the PSD, the relationship becomes nonlinear when the light spot is away from the center. This seriously limits its applications and there are urgent demands for linearity improvement in many applications. 

To reduce the nonlinearity of 2-D PSD, a new set of formulae have been proposed to estimate the incident light position (Song Cui, Yeng Chai Soh：''Linearity indices and linearity improvement of 2-D tetra-lateral position sensitive detector.'' IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices， Vol. 57, No. 9, pp. 2310-2316, 2010):

:&lt;math&gt;
x = k_{x1} \cdot \frac{I_4 - I_3}{I_0 - 1.02(I_2-I_1)} \cdot \frac{0.7(I_2+I_1) + I_0}{I_0 + 1.02(I_2-I_1)}  
&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;
y = k_{y1} \cdot \frac{I_2 - I_1}{I_0 - 1.02(I_4-I_3)} \cdot \frac{0.7(I_4+I_3) + I_0}{I_0 + 1.02(I_4-I_3)}  
&lt;/math&gt;
where :&lt;math&gt; I_0 = I_1 +I_2 + I_3 + I_4 &lt;/math&gt;, and :&lt;math&gt; k_{x1}, k_{y1}&lt;/math&gt; are new scale factors.

[[File:The position response of 2-D Position Sensitive Device.jpg|thumb|The position response of 2-D tetra-lateral PSD obtained by formulae proposed in S. Cui's paper]]

The position estimation results obtained by this set of formulae are simulated below. We assume the light spot is moving in steps in both directions and we plot position estimates on a 2-D plane. Thus a regular grid pattern should be obtained if the estimated position is perfectly linear with the true position. The performance is much better than the previous formulae. Detailed simulations and experiment results can be found in S. Cui's paper.

=== Discrete Sensors ===

==== Serial Processing ====
The most common sensor applications with a sampling rate of less than 1000&amp;nbsp;Hz are [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] or [[CMOS]] cameras. The sensor is partitioned into individual [[pixels]] whose exposure value can be read out sequentially. The position of the light spot can be computed with the methods of [[photogrammetry]] directly from the brightness distribution.

==== Parallel Processing ====
[[Image:Digital Position Sensitive Device.svg|thumb|Design of a discrete PSD from Massari with parallel processing. The yellow circle is the illuminated spot.]]
For faster applications, matrix sensors with parallel processing were developed. Both line by line and in columns, the density of light of each pixel is compared with a global threshold value. The results of comparison become lines and columns with logical OR links. From all columns and all lines the one element that is brighter than a given threshold value is the average value of the coordinates computed of the light spot.

In the USA the Director for Test Systems Engineering and Evaluation (DTSE&amp;E) commissioned in 1995 a one-year study to assess the effectiveness of the use of M&amp;S in weapon systems acquisition and support processes.&lt;ref&gt;"Modeling and Simulation in Manufacturing and Defense Acquisition: Pathways to Success", {{ISBN|0-309-08666-3}}, {{ISBN|978-0-309-08666-0}}, [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]], 2002 [http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=10425#toc]&lt;/ref&gt;

The DTSE&amp;E study developed an approach to acquisition which was named '''simulation-based acquisition''' ('''SBA''').

DTSE&amp;E was disestablished  by the US [[Secretary of Defense]] on 7 June 1999; some functions were transferred to the [[Director, Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&amp;E)]].&lt;ref&gt;"Federal Funds for Research and Development, Detailed Historical Tables: Fiscal Years 1951–2002", [[National Science Foundation]], August 2003 [https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/nsf03325/pdf/appendix.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''stICQ''' is an ICQ client for mobile phones with symbian OS.

StICQ has been written by Russian programmer Sergey Taldykin. StICQ is a native [[Symbian]] application (.SIS) for instant messaging over Internet for the [[ICQ]] network (using the [[OSCAR protocol]]).

It supports all main statuses including "Not Available", "Invisible" etc., contact search using ICQ UID, black lists, multi-user support, sound announcements and even SMS sending using default ICQ server.

It is featured by small size, low memory usage and relatively stable work.

One of the key features of the client is its ability to suspend outcoming data until [[GPRS]] coverage is available. It also suspend the status of the user, while all other mobile clients ([[Jimm]], for instance) usually report connection problem and drop user out.

Currently, stICQ does not support [[smiley]] pictures but have a unique feature of quick [[emoticon]] input using the call button (special plugin required).

Notable, stICQ supports the yellow "Ready to chat" extended status while "Depressive", as well as "At home", "At work" etc. are displayed as "Offline". This caused to call stICQ an "anti-depressive ICQ".

The source code has been sold to the development team of [[Quiet Internet Pager]] messenger. 1.01 version QiP for Symbian has been released recently.

StICQ is free for download, as are wide variety of [[modding|mods]] changing status icons and menu text.

==Keypad shortcuts==
* Pressing [[asterisk]] in a contact list window allows you to maximize the program window. It will also affect  message windows.
* Pressing the '''Green Button''' allows you to insert the smiley templates. To do that you should download and install the templates file (stICQ.tpl).

==Known Bugs==
* StICQ is known to drop out when receiving large amounts of text in one message. Thus you should aware your interlocutor of sending messages that exceeds 10-15 phone display lines.
* When using StICQ with a [[T9 (predictive text)|T9]] dictionary, you should press any cursor key to get rid of "Previous" command for right button after sending a message, or, otherwise, program will crash.
* StICQ doesn't send your contact list to the server, so any changes in StICQ's list won't affect your main contact list.

Zaif is a [[cryptocurrency exchange]] that handles currencies including [[Bitcoin]], [[Bitcoin Cash]] and [[Monacoin]]. As of September 2018, it was ranked as the 35th largest cryptocurrency exchange by turnover,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-19/tech-bureau-says-6-7b-yen-in-cryptocurrency-lost-in-zaif-hack|title=Hackers Steal $60 Million From Japanese Crypto Exchange Zaif|last=Reidy|first=Gearoid|date=2018-09-19|website=www.bloomberg.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was one of sixteen cryptocurrency exchanges licensed and regulated by the Japanese [[Financial Services Agency]] (FSA).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Bitcoin-evolution/Japanese-cryptocurrency-exchange-Zaif-hacked-for-60m2|title=Japanese cryptocurrency exchange Zaif hacked for $60m|last=Yuda|first=Masayuki|date=2018-09-30|website=Nikkei Asian Review|language=en-GB|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FSA issued business improvement orders to the exchange in March and June 2018.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://cointelegraph.com/news/operator-of-hacked-crypto-exchange-zaif-gets-third-warning-from-japans-watchdog|title=Operator of Hacked Crypto Exchange Zaif Gets Third Warning From Japan's Watchdog|last=Huillet|first=Marie|date=2018-09-25|work=Cointelegraph|access-date=2018-09-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 14, 2018, the exchange was [[Cryptocurrency and security|hacked]] and the equivalent of $60 million in cryptocurrency was stolen. The hackers reportedly gained access to "hot wallets" through which the exchange held funds for immediate transactions. Tech Bureau said that it did not notice the breach until Monday, September 17, and that the breach was then promptly reported to police and the FSA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2018/09/20/business/%C2%A56-7-billion-digital-currencies-stolen-osaka-based-exchange-tech-bureau/|title=¥6.7 billion in digital money stolen from Osaka firm|last=Nagata|first=Kazuaki|date=2018-09-20|work=The Japan Times Online|access-date=2018-09-20|language=en-US|issn=0447-5763}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hack resulted in a suspension of withdrawals and deposits, and a bailout agreement with Fisco, a Japanese company that injected 5 billion yen in financial support to Tech Bureau.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The FSA issued a third business improvement order to the exchange following the incident, and were reportedly considering suspending or cancelling its license.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In [[computer science]], '''temporal isolation''' is the capability of a set of processes running on the same system to run without interferences concerning their temporal constraints among each other.

Specifically, there is temporal isolation among processes whenever the ability for each process to respect its own timing constraints (e.g. terminating a computation within a [[time limit|specified time]]) does not depend on the temporal behavior of other unrelated processes running on the same system, thus sharing with it a set of resources such as the CPU, disk, network, etc.

[[Operating systems]] able to provide such guarantees to running processes are suitable for hosting [[Real-time computing|real-time]] applications.

'''Tessellated roof''' is a [[Framing (construction)|frame]] and a self-supporting [[structural system]] in [[architecture]]. A simple ridged roof may inside be a tessellated system. The interlinking shapes are replicated across the moulded surface using [[curvilinear coordinates]], a specific technique with rigid interlinking beams, having characteristics similar to woven [[Textile|fabric]]. A tessellated roof is one of the most flexible framed systems to design. The measurements and precision are complex and commonly part of a [[computer-aided design]] process of production. It is used in a [[Honeycomb (geometry)|honeycomb geometry]] form, in the biomes of the [[Eden Project]].

It can be fabricated to fit a wide range of situations. The size of the repeated geometric shape used can be customised, with a multitude of the same shape throughout the structure. An even and equal load is shared by the interlocking structural integrity of the frame as a whole. The use of a tessellated roof for [[Public space|public area]]s is an increasingly implemented architectural feature of modern public buildings, covering [[walkway]]s and over [[Shopping mall|retail centers]]. A transparent roof being for shelter from the weather, has an advantage during daylight with electricity for artificial lighting in solid roof buildings being a financial cost.

A modern tessellated roof for roofing public areas is a variation of a [[greenhouse]] or glass roof in different shapes and sized. The roof can be held aloft with [[column]]s, that may have branches to support and connect to the roof latticework, which stabilise the roof to create a strong structure. The material of the roof in-between or covering the tessellated frame may be a light [[composite material|composite]], [[toughened glass]] or [[insulated glazing]]. There are roofed boulevards with columns that can form a colonnade. Some tessellated roof shapes connect to the ground in place of conventional [[rain gutter]]s, for example the [[FieraMilano]], or it can be supported entirely by the surrounding buildings. A tessellated roof can convert previous outdoor space into a dry public area; some examples of this method are [[Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II]] and many other [[Shopping mall|shopping complexes]] or the [[Queen Elizabeth II Great Court]] at the [[British Museum]] in [[London]] by Norman Foster.

'''Timothy Rowe''' is the founder and CEO of [[Cambridge Innovation Center]] (CIC), founder of [[Venture Café]], partner of New Atlantic Ventures, Chair of [[LabCentral]], and Chair of MassRobotics. Previously, Tim has served as a lecturer at the [[MIT Sloan School of Management]], a manager with the [[Boston Consulting Group]], and an analyst with the [[Mitsubishi Research Institute]].

He was one of the major supporters of the Kendall Square Association, a group designed to nurture innovation in the area around the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In 212, he helped create their "Walk of Fame" to help make the contributions of innovators more obvious to the walking public. The group installed plaques on the sidewalks modeled after the stars along Hollywood Boulevard. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2013/09/28/longer-walking-entrepreneur-walk/MVb2YW0Nj8uL1t9x9Msy7H/story.html|title=No longer walking the [entrepreneur] walk - The Boston Globe|work=BostonGlobe.com|access-date=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cambridge Innovation Center ==
Tim contacted MIT for their smallest space to lease, eventually signing a lease for a 3,000-square-foot office. The space was too large for just him and his wife, so they invited friends to stay with them. Tim, his wife Amy, and his friends begin starting companies and began using the offices for their new companies. It was during this time that Tim came up with the idea to create a shared work environment, which became the Cambridge Innovation Center (CIC).&lt;ref name="techrev-kendall"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/540471/the-mayor-of-kendall-square/|title=The Mayor of Kendall Square|work=MIT Technology Review|date=18 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="boston-timstory"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.boston.com/news/innovation/2014/01/17/in-his-own-words-tim-rowe-tells-the-cambridge-innovation-center-startup-story|title=In his own words: Tim Rowe tells the Cambridge Innovation Center startup story|work=Boston.com|first=Callum |last=Borchers |date= January 17, 2014|accessdate=23 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ivy-timstory"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://magazine.ivy.com/2015/04/tim-rowe-cic/|title=5 GAME-CHANGING CREATIVITY HACKS	|work=Ivy|first=Tim |last=Rowe |date= April 8, 2015|accessdate=25 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rowe is a connector who is driven to bring people together to apply their talents to solving problems.. When [[Joi Ito]] came to Boston to run the [[MIT Media Lab]], Tim brought Joi to CIC with [[Rich Miner]].&lt;ref name="bostonglobe-conduit"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2014/12/10/networking-tim-rowe/MhgQLQprjuGaY7AXlULwoI/story.html|title=A conduit to those navigating the city’s innovation scene	|work=Ivy|first= Janelle |last= Nanos |date= December 10, 2014|accessdate=25 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;In 2014, he was named Entrepreneur of the Year. 

CIC is the "largest space for startups." CIC currently has shared innovation spaces with the Cambridge Space, and spaces in [[Boston, Massachusetts]]; [[Miami, Florida]]; [[St. Louis, Missouri]]; [[Rotterdam, Netherlands]]; and soon [[Philadelphia, Philadelphia]].&lt;ref name="disrupt-japan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cic-locations"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cic.com/locations/|title=CIC Locations	|work=CIC Locations|accessdate=25 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Wide-Field Imager for Solar Probe''' ('''WISPR''') is an imaging instrument of the ''[[Parker Solar Probe]]'' mission to the [[Sun]], launched in August 2018.&lt;ref name="svs12927"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/12927 |title=Looking at the Corona with WISPR on Parker Solar Probe |publisher=NASA/Goddard Media Studios |date=16 April 2018 |access-date=14 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Imaging targets include visible light images of the [[corona]], [[solar wind]], shocks, solar ejecta, etc.&lt;ref name="svs12927" /&gt; Development of WISPR was led by the  [[U.S. Naval Research Laboratory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.navy.mil/submit/display.asp?story_id=106691 |title=NRL's Sun Imaging Telescopes Fly on NASA Parker Solar Probe |publisher=U.S. Navy |date=10 August 2018 |access-date=14 September 2018 |id=NNS180810-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Parker Solar Probe'' with WISPR on board was launched by a [[Delta IV Heavy]] on 12 August 2018 from [[Cape Canaveral]], Florida.&lt;ref name=launch&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://parkersolarprobe.jhuapl.edu/News-Center/Show-Article.php?articleID=94 |title=Parker Solar Probe Launches on Historic Journey to Touch the Sun |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory |last1=Brown |first1=Geoffrey |last2=Brown |first2=Dwayne |last3=Fox |first3=Karen |date=12 August 2018 |access-date=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; WISPR is intended take advantage of the spacecraft's proximity to the Sun by taking [[coronagraph]]-style images of the solar corona and features like coronal streamers, plumes, and [[Coronal mass ejection|mass ejections]].&lt;ref name="nrl20180810"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.navy.mil/submit/display.asp?story_id=106691 |title=NRL's Sun Imaging Telescopes Fly on NASA Parker Solar Probe |publisher=U.S. Navy/Naval Research Laboratory |date=10 August 2018 |accessdate=7 October 2018 |id=NNS180810-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the goals is to better understand the structure of the solar corona near the Sun.&lt;ref name="nrl20180810"/&gt;

WISPR is designed to study the [[electron density]] and velocity structure of the corona.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.nrl.navy.mil/ssd/branches/7680/WISPR |title=Wide-Field Imager for Solar Probe Plus (WISPR) |publisher=U.S. Navy/Naval Research Laboratory |access-date=14 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The instrument field of view is planned to extend from 13 to 108 degrees away from the Sun, and does not directly image the Sun; the area of interest is a very wide field extending away from the Sun.&lt;ref name="svs12927" /&gt;

WISPR includes two separate telescopes, each with a [[Radiation hardening|radiation-hardened]] [[CMOS]] imager with resolution of 2,000×2,000 pixels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.sri.com/work/projects/wide-field-imager-solar-probe-wispr |title=Wide-Field Imager for Solar Probe (WISPR) |publisher=SRI International |access-date=14 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CMOS sensors are an [[active pixel sensor]] type of detector.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/parker-solar-probe-instruments |title=Parker Solar Probe Instruments |publisher=NASA |editor-last=Garner |editor-first=Rob |date=12 July 2018 |access-date=7 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
