The term animalier was first used by the French press and [[Salon (Paris)|salon]] jurors, often as a derogatory term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gallery|first1=The Bronze|title=Les Animaliers - The 19th century French movement of Bronze Sculpture|url=http://bronze-gallery.com/info/info.cfm?infoID=9|website=bronze-gallery.com|accessdate=21 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Paris salon thought animal subjects too common for fine art, but with the opening of the new [[Jardin des Plantes|Paris Jardin des Plantes]] zoo and the [[Ménagerie du Jardin des plantes]], interest in animal art increased.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iub.edu/~iuam/online_modules/metz/collection.html&lt;/ref&gt; The Dukes of [[Duke of Orléans|Orleans]], [[Duke of Luynes|Luynes]], [[Duke of Montpensier|Montpensier]], and [[Duke of Nemours|Nemours]] were soon to become Barye's patrons.

It has been observed that "many animal sculptures were modeled in plaster for exhibition and cast later in bronze editions. The size and variety of an edition depended on the popularity of the piece at exhibition, and many Barye, Mêne, and Fratin pieces were so popular that they were cast in very large editions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Metz Collection|url=http://www.iub.edu/~iuam/online_modules/metz/collection.html|website=www.iub.edu|accessdate=28 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Animalier artists ==
[[File:Rembrandt bugatti zoo antwerpen 1910.jpg|thumb|left|Rembrandt Bugatti at the zoo in Antwerp, Belgium]]Artists of the animalier movement were referred to as ''[[les animaliers]]''. Important artists of the animalier movement included [[Antoine-Louis Barye]] (1796–1875), [[Rembrandt Bugatti]] (1884–1916), [[George Stubbs]] (1724–1806), [[Alfred Dedreux]] (1810–1860), [[Christopher Fratin]] (1801–1864),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bronze-gallery.com/sculptors/artist.cfm?sculptorID=21

== Animalier reproductions ==
Many beautiful [[replicas]] are made of animalier sculpture, which may be cast or molded in any size and of any material. The most desirable of these are exact in detail and made from the same material, such as [[cast iron]], [[spelter]], or [[cast bronze]], as used in the artist's original sculpture. Most of the original animalier sculptors used the traditional [[lost wax]] process of casting prevalent at the time. Alexandre Guionnet&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Auguste Cain.

Modern reproductions of the original sculptures frequently use [[patinated]] [[verdigris]] cast bronze or iron, or [[Resin casting|bonded marble resin]] (pulverized reconstituted marble combined with resin glue), as well as various other materials and techniques, such as a composite of [[Capiz]] [[placuna placenta]] oyster shells, also known as window oyster shells, which come primarily from the [[Philippines]] (where they are known as ''kapiz'').{{clear}}

The '''Asmat''' are an [[ethnic group]] of [[New Guinea]], residing in the [[Papua (province)|Papua]] province of [[Indonesia]]. The Asmat inhabit a region on the island's southwestern coast bordering the [[Arafura Sea]], with lands totaling approximately 18,000&amp;nbsp;km² (7,336&amp;nbsp;mi²) and consisting of mangrove, tidal swamp, freshwater swamp, and lowland [[rainforest]].

The land of Asmat is located both within and adjacent to [[Lorentz National Park]] and [[World Heritage Site]], the largest protected area in the Asia-Pacific region. The total Asmat population is estimated to be around 70,000 as of 2004.&lt;ref name="met"/&gt; The term "Asmat" is used to refer both to the people and the region they inhabit.

The Asmat have one of the most well-known [[wood carving|woodcarving]] traditions in the [[Pacific]], and their art is sought by collectors worldwide.

==Culture and subsistence==
The natural environment has been a major factor affecting the Asmat, as their [[culture]] and way of life are heavily dependent on the rich natural resources found in their forests, rivers, and seas. The Asmat mainly subsist on starch from the [[sago|sago palm]] (''[[Metroxylon sagu]]''), supplemented by grubs of the sago beetle (''[[Rhynchophorus ferrugineus]]''), [[crustacean]]s, fish, forest game, and other items gathered from their forests and waters.

Materials for canoes, dwellings, and woodcarvings are also all gathered locally, and thus their culture and [[biodiversity]] are intertwined. Due to the daily flooding which occurs in many parts of their land, Asmat dwellings have typically been built two or more meters above the ground, raised on wooden posts. In some inland regions, the Asmat have lived in [[tree house]]s, sometimes as high as 25 meters from the ground. The Asmat have traditionally placed great emphasis on the [[ancestor worship|veneration of ancestors]], particularly those who were accomplished warriors.

[[File:Asmat Shields (UBC).JPG|left|upright|thumb|Asmat Shields.]]
Asmat art consists of elaborate stylized [[wood carving]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s such as the [[bisj pole]] and is designed to honour ancestors. Many Asmat artifacts have been collected by the world's museums, among the most notable of which are those found in the [[Michael C. Rockefeller]] Collection at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York City and the [[Tropenmuseum]] in Amsterdam. Asmat art is widely collected in major Western museums despite the difficulty in visiting the remote region to collect work;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stanley |first=Nick |date=2011 |title= Buyers, Connoisseurs and Others: Collecting Asmat Art |journal= The Asia Pacific Journal of Anthropology |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=348-362 |doi= 10.1080/14442213.2011.586356 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the "exceptionally expressive" art "caused a sensation in art-collecting circles" which led to large-scale collecting expeditions in the post-[[WWII]] era, according to art scholar and ethnology Dirk A.M. Smidt.&lt;ref name="Smidt2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dirk A.M. Smidt|title=Asmat Art: Woodcarvings of Southwest New Guinea|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vEPRAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT24|date=13 November 2012|publisher=Tuttle Publishing|isbn=978-1-4629-0964-3|pages=24–}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most comprehensive collections of Asmat Art can be found in the [[American Museum of Asmat Art]] at the [[University of St. Thomas (Minnesota)|University of St. Thomas]] in [[St. Paul, Minnesota]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://art.stthomas.edu/asmat/about-the-museum| title=About the Museum| accessdate=21 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, many Asmat men practiced [[polygyny]] by marrying more than one woman. In many cases, men were expected to [[levirate marriage|marry a male relative's wife]] when that relative dies, lest the widow and orphans be left without a source of protection or economic support. Schneebaum reported&lt;ref name=SCHN&gt;{{cite book| title=Where the Spirits Dwell| last=Schneebaum| first=Tobias| publisher=Grove Press| year=1988| isbn=0-8021-0019-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; that many Asmat men had long-term ritual sexual/friendship relationships (''mbai'') with other men, although the prevalence of this practice has been disputed by others. In the ''mbai'' system, male partners were also known to share their wives in a practice called ''papitsj''.&lt;ref name="SCHN"/&gt; It is probable that missionary influence in the last several decades has reduced the occurrence of both ''mbai'' and ''papitsj''.

[[Headhunting]] raids were an important element of Asmat culture until missionaries suppressed the practice, which, according to some accounts, persisted into the 1990s.  The death of an adult, even by disease, was believed to be caused by an enemy, and relatives sought to take a head in an endless cycle of revenge and propitiation of ancestors. Heads were thought necessary for the rituals in which boys were initiated into manhood. [[Cannibalism]] was a subsidiary feature of the rituals that followed the taking of heads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zegwaard|first=Gerard|title=Headhunting practices of the Asmat of Netherlands New Guinea|journal=American Anthropologist|date=1959|volume=61|pages=1020–1042|doi=10.1525/aa.1959.61.6.02a00080}}&lt;/ref&gt;,&lt;ref name="agbo"&gt;Njideka Agbo [https://guardian.ng/life/asmat-the-tribe-where-cannibalism-makes-you-a-real-man/ Asmat: The Tribe Where Cannibalism Makes You A Real Man] 22 February 2018  Guardian Newspapers &lt;/ref&gt;

==Language and ethnic sub-groups==
Linguistic classification of the native language(s) of the Asmat people is somewhat problematic, but is generally characterized as being a group of closely related languages or dialects (most mutually intelligible to some degree), known as the Asmat family, which is a sub-family of the [[Trans–New Guinea languages|Trans–New Guinea language]] phylum. However, some ethnic groups who speak languages in the Asmat language family, such as the [[Kamoro language|Kamoro]] and [[Sempan language|Sempan]] peoples who live adjacent to the Asmat, are ethnically distinct from Asmat.

Asmat may be thought of as an umbrella term for twelve different ethnic sub-groups with shared linguistic and cultural affinities and sense of shared identity. These twelve Asmat groups include Joirat, Emari Ducur, Bismam, Becembub, Simai, Kenekap, Unir Siran, Unir Epmak, Safan, Aramatak, Bras, and Yupmakcain. Further complicating the issue, these groups speak approximately five dialects (Casuarina Coast Asmat, Yaosakor Asmat, Central Asmat, North Asmat, Citak). However, at some important level these groups share a sense of identity and would likely refer to themselves as "Asmat".

==History==
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Papoea' s op de Lorentzrivier TMnr 10009529.jpg|thumb|Asmat on the [[Lorentz River]], photographed during the third South New Guinea expedition in 1912-13.]]
The Asmat's first encounter with European people was with the Dutch, in 1623. However, until the 1950s, their remote and harsh location almost entirely isolated the Asmat from other peoples. It was not until the mid-20th century that they came into regular contact with outsiders. The Asmat were documented [[headhunting|headhunters]] and [[cannibalism|cannibals]], and as a consequence were left largely undisturbed until the mid-20th century.

The first apparent sighting of the Asmat people by explorers was from the deck of a ship led by a Dutch trader, [[Jan Carstensz]] in the year 1623. [[James Cook|Captain James Cook]] and his crew were the first to actually land in Asmat on September 3, 1770 (near what is now the village of Pirimapun). According to the journals of Captain Cook, a small party from the [[HM Bark Endeavour]] encountered a group of Asmat warriors; sensing a threat, the explorers quickly retreated.

In 1826, another Dutch explorer, Kolff, anchored in approximately the same area as that visited by Cook. When the Asmat warriors again frightened the visitors with loud noises and bursts of white powder, Kolff's crew also rapidly withdrew. The [[Netherlands|Dutch]], who gained sovereignty over the western half of the island in 1793, did not begin exploring the region until the early 1900s, when they established a government post in [[Merauke]] in the southeast corner of the territory.

From there, several exploratory excursions with the goal of reaching the central mountain range passed through the Asmat area and gathered small numbers of zoological specimens and artifacts. These artifacts were taken to Europe where they generated much interest, and probably influenced modernist and [[surrealism|surrealist]] Western artists such as [[Henri Matisse]], [[Marc Chagall]] and [[Pablo Picasso]].

=== Start of significant contact with the outside world ===
The first colonial post was established in the Asmat area in Agats in 1938. This small outpost was closed in 1942 due to the onset of [[World War II]]. After the war, Father G. Zegwaard, a Dutch Missionary, began patrols into Asmat from the [[Mimika]] area to the west. In 1953, Zegwaard re-established the post in Agats, which was to become the government headquarters and the base for Roman Catholic missionaries.

It was not until [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] [[missionary|missionaries]] established the post in 1953 that significant interaction with the Asmat people began. Catholic missionaries, many with degrees in [[anthropology]], were partially successful in persuading some of the Asmat to stop [[cannibalism]] and headhunting, while encouraging the continuation of other important cultural cycles and festivals such as shield and [[Bisj Pole|bisj]] ceremonies, which were incorporated into an adapted Catholic liturgy.

Asmat was the launching point for an arduous joint French-Dutch expedition from the south to north coast of New Guinea in 1958 and 1959, which was documented by the team and resulted in a book and documentary film, ''[[The Sky Above, The Mud Below]]'', which won an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] in [[34th Academy Awards|1962]].

In November 1961, the 23-year-old [[Michael Rockefeller]], son of the then-[[Governor of New York|Governor]] of [[New York (state)|New York]] [[Nelson Rockefeller]] and member of one of the wealthiest families in the [[United States]], disappeared in Asmat when his boat overturned while on an art collecting expedition. His disappearance, followed by an intensive and ultimately unsuccessful search by the Dutch authorities, was the source of much speculation as to Mr. Rockefeller's fate. Recently, author Carl Hoffman in his book "Savage Harvest," presented evidence that Rockefeller was killed and eaten by people from [[Otsjanep]] village.&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl Hoffman]] ''Savage Harvest: A Tale of Cannibals, Colonialism, and Michael Rockefeller's Tragic Quest for Primitive Art'' 336 pages Publisher: William Morrow; March 18, 2014 {{ISBN|0062116150}},{{ISBN|978-0062116154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, the [[Indonesia|Indonesian government]] took over administration of western New Guinea. After a short period under the new Indonesian administration from 1964 to 1968 in which Asmat cultural ceremonies were officially discouraged, local Bishop [[Alphonse August Sowada]] was instrumental in facilitating the revitalization of woodcarving and other festivals, which remain strong today. The church, along with [[Tobias Schneebaum]] and Ursula Konrad, established the [[Asmat Museum of Culture and Progress]] (AMCP) in the local town of [[Agats]] in 1973, to maintain local pride in Asmat cultural traditions. Each year in early October, the church sponsors a woodcarving competition and auction to recognize outstanding carvers.

=== Present day ===
[[File:Asmat Longhouse.jpg|thumb|Asmat men inside their longhouse during a bisj pole completion ceremony, 2015.]]
Even today, the Asmat are relatively isolated and their most important cultural traditions are still strong, though their interaction with the outside world has been increasing over the last decades. Many Asmat have received higher education in other parts of Indonesia and some in [[Europe]]. The Asmat seek to find ways to incorporate new technology and beneficial services such as health, communications, and education, while preserving their cultural traditions.

The biodiversity of their area has been under some pressure from outside logging and fishing, although this has faced significant and not unsuccessful resistance. In the year 2000, the Asmat formed [[Lembaga Musyawarah Adat Asmat]] (LMAA), a civil society organization that represents and articulates their interests and aspirations.

LMAA has been working with [[Indo-Pacific Conservation Alliance]] since 1999, and has established separate traditional sub-councils, or Forum Adat Rumpun (FAR) to implement joint activities. In 2004, the Asmat region became a separate governmental administrative unit or [[Regency (Indonesia)|Kabupaten]], and elected Mr. Yufen Biakai, former director of the AMCP and current Chairman of LMAA, as its Bupati (head of local government).

==History==
In his ''Die Mediterranen in Wales'' (1935), [[Egon Freiherr von Eickstedt]] coined the term "Atlantid" to denote a phenotype he stated was common in the [[British Isles]]. According to [[Bertil Lundman]], it is synonymous with [[Joseph Deniker|Joseph Deniker's]] earlier postulated "North-Occidental" or "North-Western" race, and also [[Jan Czekanowski|Czekanowski's]] "Northern-Western" subracial taxonomy.&lt;ref&gt;Lundman, 1943, p. 134; 1977, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1940s Lundman adopted the term "North-Atlantid" to cover these earlier terminologies, and further popularised it in ''The Races and Peoples of Europe'' (1977).

The Atlantid or North-Atlantid, as described by Eickstedt and Lundman, is recognised as having a pigmentation between the [[Nordic race|Nordic]] and Atlanto-Mediterranid stock of the [[Mediterranean race|Mediterranean]].&lt;ref&gt;Eickstedt, 1935; Lundman, 1946, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; While the pigmentation of the eyes is light, the hair in contrast is dark brown.&lt;ref&gt;Lundman, 1977, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; The Atlantid is essentially a "Nordic-Mediterranean" blend, a term appearing in the literature of  [[Earnest Hooton]], but can differ in its exact gradient of pigmentation. Although usually recognised as intermediate between Nordic and Mediterranean, Deniker discussed what he saw occasionally as stronger Nordic or Mediterranean gradients.&lt;ref&gt;Deniker, 1900, p. 328; 343.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography and origin==

Lundman notes that the North-Atlantid phenotype is mainly found across [[British Isles]], but also in some other North Sea coastal areas. There are two theories on the origin of the Atlantid phenotype, according to Lundman's theory the North-Atlantid came about through only a partial northern depigmentation:

{{quote|"...To be sure the North-Atlantid race is a native race, but more southerly accentuated and more pigmented. This is a result of a less cold, but damper climate and contact with the more pigmented European races."}}

The '''Atoni''' (also known as the '''Atoin Meto''' or '''Dawan''') people are an ethnic group on [[Timor]], in [[Indonesia]]n [[West Timor]] and the [[East Timor]]ese [[enclave]] of [[Oecussi-Ambeno]]. They number around 844,030. Their language is [[Uab Meto language|Uab Meto]].

The Atoni live in villages consisting of 50 to 60 people, each village is surrounded with stone fence or shrubs, with fields and cattle cages on the periphery. The houses usually form a circular cluster, or following the road after the introduction of a road.

==Spatial symbolism==
According to ethnographer Clarke Cunningham, their culture is notable for its spatial symbolism, associated with a gender dichotomy. Male-female principle is important, as with the duality of sun-earth, light-dark, open-close, dry season-wet season, outer-inner, central-periphery, secular-sacral, right-left, and so on. This in turn affects the spatial configuration of an Atoni house.

The right side of the house (facing the door) is always male, whereas the left is female. The center of the house (and the attic) is male, while the periphery of the house is female. The interior of the house is female, the terrace is male. The house is female and the yard is male. This principle conceived the Atoni house as a microcosmos. The house also expresses social order.

A more elaborate house is called ''Ume Atoni'' (''Atoni'' means "male"). The house is dominantly male in quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Geoffrey Hull, Jorge da Conceição Teme &amp; Francisco do Amaral|title=Baikenu Language Manual: For the Oecussi-Ambeno Enclave (East Timor)|year=2001|publisher=Sebastião Aparício da Silva Project|isbn=18-640-8706-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Atoni entertains their guest in a communal house called ''Lopo''. A ''Lopo'' is always located in front of a house and is oriented to the road.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Christoffel Kana|editor=Rifai Abu|title=Arsitektur Tradisional Daerah Nusa Tenggara Timur|year=1986|publisher=Direktorat Jenderal Kebudayaan|oclc=16471325}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, each cardinal direction is associated with a gender, as are different parts of a house. Sex and gender do not always line up, as an important lord is called a "female-man," and is accordingly always a man, but performs stereotypically female duties.&lt;ref name="symbol"&gt;{{cite book |title="The Symbolic Classification Of The Atoni Of Timor" - James J.

==Eponyms==
A species of [[skink]], ''[[Eremiascincus|Eremiascincus antoniorum]]'', which is [[Endemism|endemic]] to Timor, is named in honor of the Antoni people.&lt;ref&gt;Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011).

'''Brazilians''' (''brasileiros'' in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], {{IPA-pt|bɾaziˈlejɾus|IPA}})&lt;ref&gt;Some regional pronunciations include {{IPA-pt|bɾaziˈleɪ̯ɾʊs|}} in São Paulo and much of Southern Brazil, and {{IPA-pt|bɾɐziˈleⁱɾuⁱʃ|}} in Rio de Janeiro.&lt;/ref&gt; are citizens of [[Brazil]]. A Brazilian can also be a person born abroad to a Brazilian parent or [[legal guardian]] as well as a persons who acquired [[Brazilian nationality law|Brazilian citizenship]]. Brazil is a [[multiethnic society]], which means that it is home to people of many different ethnic origins. As a result, majority of Brazilians do not equate their [[nationality]] with their ethnicity, usually embracing and espousing both simultaneously.

In the period after the colonization of the Brazilian territory by [[Portugal]], during much of the XVI century, the word "Brazilian" was given to the Portuguese merchants of [[Brazilwood]], designating exclusively the name of such profession, since the inhabitants of the land were, in most of them, [[Native Brazilian|indigenous]] or Portuguese born in Portugal, or in the territory now called Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z3qpHh7cBYkC&amp;pg=PA93&amp;dq=%22brasileiro%22+s+comerciantes+de+pau-brasil,&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=4#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false|title=Um defunto estrambótico: análise e interpretação das Memórias póstumas de Brás Cubas|first=Valentim|last=Facioli|date=25 February 2018|publisher=EdUSP|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, long before the [[independence of Brazil]], in 1822, both in Brazil and in [[Portugal]], it was already common to attribute the Brazilian [[Demonym|gentile]] to a person, usually of clear Portuguese descent, resident or whose family resided in the [[State of Brazil]] (1530-1815), belonging to the [[Portuguese Empire]]. During the lifetime of the [[United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves]] (1815-1822), however, there was confusion about the nomenclature.

==Definition==
{{Main|Brazilian nationality law}}
According to the [[Constitution of Brazil]], a Brazilian citizen is:

* Anyone born in Brazil, even if to foreign born parents. However, if the foreign parents were at the service of a foreign State (such as foreign [[diplomacy|diplomats]]), the child is not Brazilian;
* Anyone born abroad to a Brazilian father or a Brazilian mother, with registration of birth in a Brazilian Embassy or Consulate. Also, a person born abroad to a Brazilian father or a Brazilian mother who was not registered but who, after turning 18 years old, went to live in Brazil;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Constituição da República Federativa do Brasil, Artigo 12, I.&lt;/ref&gt;
* A foreigner living in Brazil who applied for and was accepted as a Brazilian citizen.

According to the Constitution, all people who hold Brazilian citizenship are equal, regardless of race, ethnicity, gender or religion.

A foreigner can apply for Brazilian citizenship after living for four uninterrupted years in Brazil and being able to speak Portuguese. A native person from an official Portuguese language country ([[Portugal]], [[Angola]], [[Mozambique]], [[Cape Verde]], [[São Tomé and Príncipe]], [[Guinea Bissau]] and [[East Timor]]) can request the [[Brazilian nationality law|Brazilian nationality]] after only 1 uninterrupted year living in Brazil. A foreign born person who holds Brazilian citizenship has exactly the same [[rights]] and duties of the Brazilian citizen by birth, but cannot occupy some special public positions such as the Presidency of the Republic, Vice-presidency of the Republic, Minister (Secretary) of Defense, Presidency (Speaker) of the Senate, Presidency (Speaker) of the House of Representatives, Officer of the Armed Forces and Diplomat.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Brazilians are mostly [[Kinship|descendants]] of  [[Portuguese Brazilians|Portuguese settlers]], [[Immigration to Brazil|post-colonial]] immigrant groups, [[Afro-Brazilian|Enslaved Africans]] and [[Indigenous peoples in Brazil|Brazil's indigenous peoples]]. Along with other immigrants of who arrived in Brazil, from the 1820s well into the 1970s, most of the settlers were [[Portuguese Brazilian|Portuguese]], [[Italian Brazilian|Italians]], [[Spanish immigration to Brazil|Spaniards]], [[Arab Brazilians|Arabs]] and [[German-Brazilian|Germans]], with significantly large numbers of [[Japanese Brazilian|Japanese]], [[Armenian Brazilians|Armenians]], [[Romani people in Brazil|Gypsies]], [[Greek Brazilians|Greeks]], [[Polish Brazilian|Poles]], [[Ukrainian Brazilian|Ukrainians]] and [[Arab Brazilians|Levantine Arabs]].&lt;ref name=j1/&gt;

===The colonization period (1500 to 1822)===
The three principal groups were Native Brazilians, European colonizers and African labor.

* Brazil was inhabited by an estimated 2.4 million [[Indigenous peoples in Brazil|Amerindians]] before the first settlers arrived in the 16th century. They had been living there since the [[Pleistocene]] and still exist in many different tribes and ethnicities, amounting to the hundreds, giving them varying features, shapes and shades. There are different estimates for the Indigenous population around 1498, when the cohort commanded by [[Duarte Pacheco Pereira]] first set foot in Brazilian territory, followed by [[Pedro Álvares Cabral]] and [[Amerigo Vespucci]] in 1500 and 1502, with figures revolving between 2.4 million and 3.1 million. What is more accurate is that about three quarters of them died from contracted diseases brought by colonizers (the [[flu]], [[smallpox]], [[measles]], [[scarlet fever]] and [[tuberculosis]]) and conflicts (besides the numerous deaths in different tribal groups by forging alliances with the Portuguese, French and Dutch to fight each other, ending in genocide, the abortion rate also increased among Indigenous women after the arrival of the colonizers), while the remaining were pushed to the Amazon Basin, sometimes migrating beyond the borders with Hispanic provinces. It is also important to mention that a strong assimilation by miscegenation with local populations occurred, where Natives living under Jesuit protection and having a monastic life decided to leave for the life in towns. The European diseases spread quickly along the indigenous trade routes, and whole tribes were likely annihilated without ever coming in direct contact with Europeans. Today, 517,000 Indigenous people live in reservations and 160 thousand speak assorted Native languages, whereas millions of Brazilians have at least some degree of Amerindian ancestry due to the mentioned interracial encounters.
* The country was officially discovered by Portugal in 1500 and received about 724,000 [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] colonizers, mostly males, who settled there until the end of Colonial Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibge.gov.br/ibgeteen/povoamento/portugueses.html |title=IBGE teen |publisher=[[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics]] |accessdate=2011-12-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130224012534/http://www.ibge.gov.br/ibgeteen/povoamento/portugueses.html |archivedate=2013-02-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; But other sources even claim that the given numbers of total entrances were clearly surpassed. The Jesuits asked the Portuguese Crown to ship [[orphaned]] women under royal wardship for marriage with the settlers; they were known as ''[[Órfãs d'El-Rei]]'' (modern ''órfãs do rei'', "orphans of the king").{{sfnp|Telfer|1932|p=184}}{{sfnp|Bethell|1984|p=47}}&lt;ref name="ensinarhistoria"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ensinarhistoriajoelza.com.br/desmundo-o-brasil-do-sec-xvi/|title=Desmundo de Alain Fresnot, o Brasil no século XVI|publisher=ensinarhistoria|accessdate=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.companhiadasletras.com.br/detalhe.php?codigo=10637|title=Desmundo by Ana Miranda (1996)|publisher=companhiadasletras.com.br|accessdate=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Daughters of noblemen who died overseas administrating captaincies in the colonies or in battle for the king would marry settlers of higher rank. Bahia's port in the Northeast received one of the first groups of orphans in 1551.{{sfnp|Bethell|1984|p=47}}
Portugal remained the only significant, but not an exclusive source of European immigration to Brazil until the early 19th century.
* These other people came from different nationalities - but the by far most mentioned are the Dutch. Hence, under the rule of [[Dutch Brazil]] in the northeastern part of the country, from 1630 to 1654, a comparatively small but still notable number of Dutch settlers ([[Dutch Brazilian]]) and some [[Jews|Jewish People]] arrived, the latter seeking religious freedom. These Jews founded the first Synagogue in the Americas, named [[Kahal Zur Israel Synagogue]] in the city of [[Recife]].

It is estimated that more than 20,000 [[Dutch people|Dutch]] entered [[Brazil]], however, both groups had been forced out of the country after the rule's end. The remaining families mostly fled to remote parts of the interior of Northeastern Brazil (mainly in the states of Pernambuco, but also Paraíba, Rio Grande do Norte, Ceará and others) or changed their names to Portuguese ones. The proven excess of Y-chromosomes of the haplogroup 2 in northeasterners probably results from the high  miscegenation of Dutch settlers with the local population.

The Jews who mostly left Brazil took off to what was then named [[New Amsterdam]], today New York City, and founded the oldest Jewish congregation in the US, the [[Congregation Shearith Israel]]. The ones who stayed, converted into Christianity and were then known as [[New Christian]]s or [[Marranos]], who sometimes practiced [[Crypto-Judaism]]. Even if the Jewish population under Dutch Brazil not surpassed a few thousand individuals, a considerably higher number of New Christians, in the past simply absorbed as [[Portuguese People|Portuguese]] colonizers, arrived in Colonial Brazil - especially in the first centuries after 1500. They entered Brazil fleeing from the Inquisition or were deported by the Kingdom of Portugal and also Spain, latter being known as [[Degredado]]s, someone who was sentenced or forced to exile. This also included [[Romani People]] from the Iberian Peninsula, what partially explains the curiously high numbers for a western country. Brazil has the second largest Gypsy population in the Americas after the US, having also received Roma people from Central and Eastern Europe, as well as the Baltic countries during the 20th century.

* As a result of the [[Atlantic slave trade]] from the mid-16th century until 1855, an estimated 3.6 million [[List of ethnic groups of Africa|African people]], also from many different countries and ethnicities were brought to Brazil, giving the country the Americas' largest population with some African ancestry. Many of the slaves suffered under severe conditions and the mortality rates were pretty high, what led to the foundation of [[Quilombola]] communities throughout the country. A small number of the slaves in the state of Bahia were actually Muslims; they produced a revolt in the city of Salvador that was quickly tamed by the army.

In 1808, the [[Transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil|Portuguese court moved to Brazil]], bringing thousands of Portuguese again and afterwards opened its seaports to other nations starting from 1820. This caused the biggest wave of immigration which the country has seen until then.

===The Great Immigration (1820 until the 1970s)===
[[File:Europeans_and_Arabs_in_Brazil.jpg|thumb|Some of the main immigrant groups]]
In this period, [[Immigration to Brazil|people]] from all over the world officially entered Brazil, the vast majority of them Europeans.

Between 1820 and the 1950s, Brazil received around '''5,686,133'''  European immigrants, including a thriving Jewish population.&lt;ref name="Brazil - Modern-Day Community"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Brazil.html#4 |title=Brazil - Modern-Day Community |publisher=www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/ |year=2013 |accessdate=2013-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brasil500anos.ibge.gov.br/territorio-brasileiro-e-povoamento/judeus/judeus-no-brasil-vida-social-politica-e-cultural|title=Judeus no Brasil.

1) Back then, nearly '''70 %''' of those immigrants originated from '''Southern Europe'''.

* A second wave of '''[[Portuguese Brazilian|Portuguese]]''' people arrived (here: [[Postcolonialism]]), this time with more than '''1,8 million''' immigrants.

Portuguese people have been present since the discovery of the country, and therefore it is difficult to estimate a more accurate number of descendants. Millions of White Brazilians descend from recent Portuguese immigration from between the 1870s and 1975. In addition, many multiracial Brazilians partially descend from Portuguese people, caused by the high intermarriage rates. Most of them came from the [[Provinces of Portugal|historical provinces]] of Minho, Trás-os-Montes, Beira, Estremadura (North and Central Portugal). Northeastern Brazil traditionally received the first waves of immigrants, but during the Great Immigration, the Southeast received the biggest influx. São Paulo (state) received the most, followed by Rio de Janeiro (city), which is considered the largest Portuguese city outside of Lisbon. The second former capital of Brazil once also was the capital of Portugal, the only European capital outside of Europe. The accent in the city of [[Rio de Janeiro]] subsequently reminds the 19th century innovations that took place in the European variety of the language, while the prosody of the rest of the country, besides some local varieties, has rather conservative phonetics rooted in the 1600s. Other states with significant numbers were [[Minas Gerais]], [[Pará]], [[Rio Grande do Sul]], [[Pernambuco]] and [[Bahia]]. Nowadays, they naturally live throughout Brazil and compose the majority of White and also Multiracial Brazilians in many states.

*Furthermore, around '''1,6 million''' '''[[Italian Brazilian|Italians]]''' were responsible for a massive immigration wave, consequently composing the biggest European follow-up group the country has received after its colonizers.

Today, millions of [[Italian-Brazilians]] make Brazil their home, as they usually brought the whole family and had high birth rates. Regarding the total numbers, this probably represents the biggest Italian diaspora outside of Italy. Contrary to other countries, more than half of the Italians immigrated from the North, mostly composed by people from [[Veneto]] and [[Lombardy]], followed by people from Central Italy. The state of São Paulo had the strongest and a more diverse influx, with many also coming from [[South Italy]], especially to the eponymic capital. [[Italians]] mostly went to [[São Paulo (state)]], which received half of the overall immigrants. The others mainly went to the states of southern Brazil, where they also composed the biggest European immigrant group. Other notable influxes occurred in two other southeastern states, here [[Minas Gerais]] and [[Espírito Santo]] and the Central-West region, mainly to [[Mato Grosso do Sul]] and Goiás. Comparatively small numbers went to [[Pernambuco]] and Bahia, both in the Northeast. Nowadays the descendants mostly live in mentioned areas, but the sheer amount and internal migrations made the Italilan diaspora spread out and nowadays they are scattered all over Brazil.

*'''[[Brazilians of Spanish descent|Spaniards]]''' also arrived in rather high numbers, with around '''700,000''' immigrants mainly from [[Andalusia]] and [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]].

Several million Brazilians have Spanish ancestry. Most Spaniards settled in the past century, where they chiefly headed to [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]], then [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]] and [[Minas Gerais]]. Most notably from [[Andalusia]] (South), others from the provinces of [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], [[Castile and León]] and [[Catalonia]] (North and East Spain) followed. Galicians were also present throughout Colonial Brazil, as the province shares borders and linguistic ties with Portugal, and once was part of the country. [[Spanish Brazilian]]s in the other states mainly have origins in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], which arrived in earlier occasions. Many of them went to the first capital [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]] and its state Bahia, but also Pernambuco (Northeast), Pará (North), [[Espírito Santo]] (Southeast), and [[Rio Grande do Sul]] (South).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Marília D.

'''Note:''' Brazil is also home to other Southern European populations, mainly [[Greek Brazilian|Greeks]] (around 150,000 descendants), but they are by far the smallest groups with origins in South Europe.

- Western Europeans were very present, as around '''240,000''' '''[[German Brazilians|Germans]]''' settled, '''198,000''' '''[[Austrian Brazilians|Austrian]]''' and '''52,000''' '''[[Swiss Brazilians|Swiss]]'''; [[Luxembourg Brazilian|Luxembourgers]] and [[Volga Germans]] were also documented, but in comparatively low numbers.

- European Jews of Ashkenazi origin, more precisely around '''48,000''' people from several countries, chose Brazil as their destination. '''[[History of the Jews in Brazil|Ashkenazi Jews]]''' were first documented during Imperial times, when the liberal second emperor of Brazil welcomed a few thousands of families facing persecution in Europe during the 1870s and 1880s.&lt;ref name="jewishvirtuallibrary.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Brazil.html|title=Brazil Virtual Jewish History Tour|website=www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org|first = Alden|last = Oreck|publisher = American-Israeli Cooperative Enterprise}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two heavier influxes took place during the 20th century. The earliest right after the Great War and the second inrush between the 1930s and 1950s.&lt;ref name="MSZ" /&gt;&lt;ref name="jewishvirtuallibrary.org"/&gt;
Brazil has also seen an influx from North African Jews of Sephardic origin coming from mainly Morocco and Egypt, which were counted extra.

*'''Asians''':

- Western Asians, more specifically from the '''[[Levant]]''' region, equally arrived in large numbers, chiefly '''[[Lebanese Brazilians|Lebanese]]''' and [[Syrian Brazilians|Syrians]], both surpassing '''200,000''' entrances throughout the 20th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.washingtontimes.com/news/2005/jul/11/20050711-092503-1255r/?page=all|title=Arab roots grow deep in Brazil's rich melting pot|publisher=Washington Times|accessdate=17 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brasil500anos.ibge.gov.br/territorio-brasileiro-e-povoamento/arabes/origem-e-destino-dos-imigrantes|title=Origem e destino dos imigrantes do Levante|publisher=ibge|accessdate=2016-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; with mentionable numbers of [[Armenian Brazilian|Armenian]], Georgian and some [[Iranian people|Iranian]] immigrants from the [[Caucasus]] region.

- East Asians, the majority composed of '''[[Japanese diaspora|Japanese]]''' immigrants, also arrived in formidable numbers, where the first ship landed in 1908, surpassing '''250,000''' immigrants.&lt;ref name="Abril"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gonzalez"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://lens.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/25/japanese-brazilians-straddling-two-cultures/?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss|title=Japanese-Brazilians: Straddling Two Cultures|last=Gonzalez|first=David|date=September 25, 2013|work=Lens Blog|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=September 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=japantimes&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20080115i1.html |title=Japan, Brazil mark a century of settlement, family ties &lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt; The Japan Times Online |date=2008-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="japao100.com.br"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IBGE traça perfil dos imigrantes"&gt;[http://madeinjapan.uol.com.br/2008/06/21/ibge-traca-perfil-dos-imigrantes/ IBGE traça perfil dos imigrantes] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121119132009/http://madeinjapan.uol.com.br/2008/06/21/ibge-traca-perfil-dos-imigrantes/ |date=November 19, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; But '''[[Chinese Brazilians|Chinese]]''' and '''[[Korean Brazilians|Koreans]]''' also have traditions of immigrating to Brazil, especially after the 1950s, with around 200,000 and 100,000 immigrants respectively.

*'''Americans:'''

- North Americans also formed the melting pot that is Brazil, with the country being one of the few which received [[Americans in Brazil|US-Americans]] who fled the American Civil War, settling in Southeastern and Southern Brazil during the [[Reconstruction Era|American reconstruction period]]. In addition, smaller numbers of North Americans immigrated after 1808.&lt;ref name="The Lost Colony of the Confederacy"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TSHA"/&gt; The descendants of those '''[[Confederate colonies]]''' are culturally known as the '''''[[Confederados]]''''' sub-group, especially in the countryside of São Paulo, where they founded towns and their presence was stronger&lt;ref name="The Lost Colony of the Confederacy"/&gt; - Brazilians of US-American descent can be found throughout the country, resulting from other periods and the dispersion of the Confederados descendants, who are nowadays mostly mixed with other groups and sometimes mistaken for descendants of British immigrants. Ethnically the Confederados were mostly English-Welsh, Scottish, Irish, German and Scandinavian.&lt;ref name="Eugene C. Harter 1985, p. 74"&gt;Eugene C. Harter. "The Lost Colony of the Confederacy". Texas A&amp;M University Press, 1985, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;

- South Americans were strongly represented by Argentines since the 18th century and always had a strong community in the country. They still form one of the largest South American immigrant groups in Brazil, nowadays only surpassed by Bolivians (see modern times). Uruguayan citizens after the country's independence from the [[Empire of Brazil]] were also noticeable throughout the 19th and 20th centuries.

*'''Africans:'''

- North African regions, historically distinguished from [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], also sent immigrants. This time they mainly came from Egypt, with around '''10,000''' people, than the [[Maghreb]] region, especially Morocco (mostly Jews who went to Northern Brazil). Therefore, a stronger influx from other cultures occurred, contrary to Colonial Brazil, where most Africans were forced labor work brought from the Black populations.

- Other Africa-born people mainly include Dutch South-Africans ([[Afrikaner|Boeren or Afrikaners]]) and people from the former Portuguese Empire, mainly Angola (during the Great Immigration, but especially after the Civil Wars post-independence). Here people of several ethnicities immigrated (mainly Africans of European descent, but also Blacks and Coloured people).

'''Note:''' Dozen other immigrant groups form sizable communities with some varying number of descendants (5,000 to + 30 million). '''Only in this period''', the port of [[Santos, São Paulo]], which was widely known as the most important entrance of immigrants in Brazil, received people from '''more than 60 different countries'''. Other important ports, which occasionally received other immigrant groups as the before mentioned, were the ones in the cities of Rio de Janeiro, Porto Alegre, Vitória, Recife etc.&lt;ref name=j1/&gt;

===Modern times (1970 to now)===

Not to be compared with the great immigration before, a still ongoing influx from Africa (Angola, Senegal) and South America and the Caribbean (Bolivia, Paraguay, Chile, Uruguay, Haiti, Suriname) is happening since the late 60's. Asian immigrants (from Palestine, China, South Korea, returning Japanese Brazilians, [[Indo people|Dutch Indonesians]], Afghans and immigrants from Vietnam, Iran, Pakistan, the Philippines and others) as well as from Europe (Portugal due to ties, young qualified professionals from Western Europe, especially after 2008, Northern Europeans who seek warmer weather and some Eastern Europeans) are thriving in varying numbers.

After 1975 large groups of [[Dutch Surinamese|Dutch Surinamese or Boeroes]] immigrated to Brazil due to the independence in Suriname. Most of them settled in the countryside of São Paulo and Paraná where there are thriving [[Dutch Brazilians|Dutch Brazilian]] colonies.

'''Current foreign population'''

In 2011, the country was home to 1.5 million [[foreign born]] people, more than twice as of 2009.

The numbers still could be higher, as there are many undocumented people in Brazil as well. For both, the documented and undocumented, most of the foreigners come from [[Portugal]], [[Bolivia]], China, [[Paraguay]], [[Angola]], Spain, [[Argentina]], Japan and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brasil.gov.br/noticias/arquivos/2011/11/1o/economia-brasileira-atrai-estrangeiros-e-imigracao-aumenta-50-em-seis-meses|title=Economia brasileira atrai estrangeiros e imigração aumenta 50% em seis meses|work=Portal Brasil|accessdate=29 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The major work visas concessions were granted for citizens of the United States and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bv.fapesp.br/namidia/noticia/39946/procuram-estrangeiros/ Brazil has 689,000 people from around the world in 2009]. Bv.fapesp.br. Retrieved on 2012-05-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lusitanian immigration never ceased throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. Portuguese people in diaspora settled in Brazil especially during the 1970s coming from former Portuguese colonies like [[Macau]] or Angola after its independence. 
An additional figure of '''1.2 million Portuguese''' arrived between 1951 and 1975 to settle mostly in the Southeast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dn.pt/portugal/interior/estudo-descobre-3119-milhoes-de-portugueses-pelo-mundo--1192698.html?id=1192698 |title=Estudo descobre 31 milhões de portugueses pelo mundo|publisher=dn.pt|accessdate=7 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Nowadays, Lusitanians constitute the biggest group of foreigners living in the country, with over 690,000 Portuguese nationals currently living in Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.observatorioemigracao.secomunidades.pt/np4/2454.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-08-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303190314/http://www.observatorioemigracao.secomunidades.pt/np4/2454.html |archivedate=2016-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The vast majority arrived in the last decade.

Today, people of more than 220 nationalities have communities in Brazil, 40 of them more than 10,000 people.

'''Refugees'''

In 2014, Brazil was home to 5,208 [[refugee]]s from 79 different [[nationalities]]. The three largest refugee ancestries were [[Syria]]n (1,626), [[Colombian people|Colombian]] (1,154) and [[Angola]]n (1062). In addition to these numbers, there are several thousand people who had entered the country and are still waiting for the government to acknowledge their refugee status, as 1,830 people from [[Bangladesh]]&lt;ref name="Mundo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://g1.globo.com/mundo/noticia/2014/04/brasil-tem-hoje-52-mil-refugiados-de-79-nacionalidades-diferentes.html|title=G1 - Brasil tem hoje 5,2 mil refugiados de 79 nacionalidades - notícias em Mundo|work=Mundo|accessdate=29 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2013 alone and other 1,021 people from Syria and 799 people from [[Senegal]], for example.&lt;ref name="Mundo"/&gt;

Brazil is today home to 4.5 thousand Afghans and was a destination for [[Vietnamese boat people]] in the past.

'''Note:''' The ethnic composition of Brazilians is not uniform across the country.

*Due to its large influx of [[European ethnic groups|European]] immigrants in the 19th and 20th centuries, [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]],  and the [[Southern Brazil|Southern Region]] have a '''White''' majority (mostly Europeans of Italian, Portuguese, German, Austrian, Swiss, Slavic, Dutch and Spanish ancestry).&lt;ref name="sidra.ibge.gov.br"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sidra.ibge.gov.br/bda/tabela/protabl.asp?c=262&amp;i=P&amp;nome=on&amp;notarodape=on&amp;tab=262&amp;unit=0&amp;pov=1&amp;opc1=1&amp;poc2=1&amp;OpcTipoNivt=1&amp;opn1=0&amp;nivt=0&amp;orc86=3&amp;poc1=1&amp;orp=6&amp;qtu3=27&amp;opv=1&amp;poc86=1&amp;sec1=0&amp;opc2=1&amp;pop=1&amp;opn2=0&amp;orv=2&amp;orc2=5&amp;qtu2=5&amp;sev=1000093&amp;opc86=1&amp;sec2=0&amp;opp=1&amp;opn3=1&amp;sec86=2776&amp;ascendente=on&amp;sep=17795&amp;orn=1&amp;qtu7=9&amp;orc1=4&amp;qtu1=1&amp;cabec=on&amp;pon=1&amp;OpcCara=44&amp;proc=1&amp;opn7=0&amp;decm=99|title=Sistema IBGE de Recuperação Automática - SIDRA|work=ibge.gov.br}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.genealogienetz.de/reg/WELT/brasil.html Genealogy: German migration to Brazil].

The '''majority''' there is composed of '''Pardo (mixed) people''', who are of a brownish or darker phenotype with light to dark features, followed by Whites (mostly Europeans and also with admixtures) and then by people with mostly African blood - Bahia and Maranhão have the biggest Black African populations in Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;Phillip Wagner [https://web.archive.org/web/20090419063828/http://www.iei.net/~pwagner/brazarticles/April2002.html Sugar and Blood]. Brazzil Magazine, April 2002&lt;/ref&gt; The individual appearance of Pardo people varies extremely, but generally all types and colours of hairs, eyes and skin are involved (usually not the extremes as extremely white or extremely black). But in fact, minorities in the White and Black populations consider themselves as Pardo. Moreover, some people in the Roma, Sephardic,   Arab and Asian population classify themselves as Pardo, due to miscegenation with other races.
*[[Northern Brazil]], largely covered by the [[Amazon Rainforest]], is also mostly '''Pardo''', due to a stronger [[Amerindian]] influence.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050315162129/http://www.socioambiental.org/pib/english/source/xi.shtm Sources :: Indigenous Peoples in Brazil – ISA]. socioambiental.org&lt;/ref&gt;
*The two remaining [[Southeastern Brazil|South Eastern states]] and the [[Central-West Region, Brazil|Central-Western]] Brazil have a more '''balanced''' ratio among different racial groups (around 50% White, 43% Pardo, 5% Black, 1% Asian/Amerindian).

The [[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics]] (IBGE) classifies the Brazilian population in five categories: ''brancos'' ([[Whites|white]]), ''negros'' ([[Black people|black]]), ''[[pardo]]s'' ([[Brown people|brown or mixed]]), ''amarelos'' ([[Asian people|Asian/yellow]]) and ''índios'' ([[Indigenous peoples in Brazil|Amerindian]]), based on [[Human skin color|skin color]] or [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]]. The last detailed census (PNAD) found Brazil to be made up of c. 91 million white people ([[White Brazilian]]), 79 million multiracial people ([[Pardo]]), 14 million black people ([[Afro-Brazilian]]), 2-4 million Asian people ([[Asian Brazilian]]) and 807,900 indigenous ([[Amerindian]]) people.

[[File:Concentração.jpg|thumb|Young Brazilians]]
In the 2005 detailed census, for the first time in two decades, the number of White Brazilians did not exceed 50% of the population. On the other side, the number of ''pardos'' (multiracial) people increased and all the others remained almost the same. According to the IBGE, this trend is mainly because of the revaluation of the identity of historically discriminated ethnic groups.

Brazil is said to be among the most miscegenated countries in the world, as since the country was discovered and during the colonial period intermarriage between races was never illegal and common. Those of full ancestry are usually the Brazilians who can trace back their ethnicity to more recent immigration from the monarchical period in the 19th century until the Republican 20th and 21st centuries. Still, many Brazilians can not trace back their real origin easily. For instance, European family names which were difficult to pronounce were commonly changed to easier Portuguese surnames. In basic terms, it could be said that half of Brazilians are descendants of populations from the colonial era and the other half made of modern immigration. Brazil is a true melting pot of Europeans, Asians, Africans and Indigenous people, who either are in the single group or a mixture of various different backgrounds and races.

===White coloured people===
{{Main|White Brazilian|Immigration to Brazil}}

'''Whites''' constitute the majority of Brazil's population regarding the total numbers within a single racial group, having the most numerous population in the [[Southern Hemisphere]].

The country has the second largest [[White Brazilian|White population]] in the Americas, with around 89.9 million people.

And White Brazilians make up the '''third''' largest [[White people|White population]] in the world, after the United States and Russia, also counting in total numbers.&lt;ref name="ibge.gov.br 2010"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibge.gov.br/english/estatistica/populacao/censo2010/caracteristicas_da_populacao/tabelas_pdf/tab3.pdf|date=8 November 2011|title=Censo Demográfi co 2010 Características da população e dos domicílios Resultados do universo|accessdate=2014-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2075.html|title=CIA data from The World Factbook's Field Listing :: Ethnic groups and Field Listing :: Population|publisher=cia.gov|accessdate=9 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://convergencia.uaemex.mx/rev38/38pdf/LIZCANO.pdf |title=Composición Étnica de las Tres Áreas Culturales del Continente Americano al Comienzo del Siglo XXI |work=Convergencia |author=Fran cisco Lizcano Fernández |date=May 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140224061845/http://convergencia.uaemex.mx/rev38/38pdf/LIZCANO.pdf# |archivedate=2014-02-24 |deadurl=yes |access-date=2016-05-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority came from the Great Immigration period, which was the large European influx after steps had been taken for "whitening policies" during the [[Empire of Brazil|Monarchy]] and [[First Brazilian Republic|Early Republican]] periods. Those policies also sought labor and also were made in order to avoid the foreign invasion threat of sparsely populated areas in the South. Various other groups derive from [[Colonial Brazil|colonial times]] and post-war decades.

There are people of European descent distributed throughout the entire territory of Brazil, however, Southeast and South Brazil have the largest White populations. Whereas the Southeast region has the largest absolute numbers, '''79.8%''' of the population in the three southernmost states has European or Caucasian phenotype.
The state of '''[[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]]''' in [[Southern Brazil]] has the highest percentage, being almost '''90% European'''. '''[[São Paulo]]''' in the [[Southeast Brazil|Southeast]] has the fourth highest rate, but is the state with the most Whites in '''absolute numbers of 30 million [[White Latin American|Whites]]''', mainly from Europe, also having largest Levantine Arab and Jewish populations.

===Mixed (multiracial) people===
{{Main|Pardo Brazilian}}
'''Multiracials''' constitute the second largest group of Brazil, with around 84,7 million people. The term ''Pardo'' or mixed race Brazilian is a rather complex one. Multiracial Brazilians appear in hundreds of different shades, colours and backgrounds. They are typically a mixture of colonial and post-colonial [[Ethnic groups in Europe|Europeans]] with descendants of [[African slaves]] and the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas]]. Some individuals may also descend from Maghreb people, Jews, Middle Eastern and Egyptian people, or a more recent ancestry from East or South Asia. Skin colours can vary from light to dark. The '''''caboclo''''' or '''''mestiço''''' population, those who are a miscegenation of Native and European, revolves around 43 million people. Genetic studies conducted by the geneticist Sergio D.J. Pena of the Federal University of Minas Gerais have shown that the '''[[Caboclo]]''' population is made of individuals whose DNA ranges from 70% to 90% European (mostly Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch, French or Italian 1500s to 1700s male settlers) with the remaining percentage spanning different Indigenous markers. Similar DNA tests showed that people self-classified as '''[[Mulatto]]''' or White and Black mix, span from 62% to 85% European (mostly descendants of Portuguese, Dutch and French settlers during the colonial period in the Northeast). The '''Pardo category''' in Brazil also includes 800 thousand '''[[Gypsies]]''' or '''[[Roma people]]''', most of them coming from Portugal but also different countries in Eastern Europe and the Baltics. '''[[Eurasia]]ns''' can also be classified as Pardo. The majority of them consisting of '''[[Hafu|Ainoko]]''' or '''[[Hafu]]''', individuals who are a miscegenation between Japanese and European.

Recent research has suggested that Asians from the early [[Portuguese Eastern Empire]], known as [[Luso-Asians]] first came to Brazil during the sixteenth century as seamen known as [[Lascars]], or as servants, slaves and [[concubines]] accompanying the governors, merchants and clergy who has served in Portuguese Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Cliff Pereira, in Van Tilburg, H., Tripati, S., Walker Vadillo, V., Fahy, B., and Kimura, J. (eds.), [http://www.themua.org/collections/items/show/1607 “East in the West : Investigating the Asian presence and influence in Brazil from the 16th to 18th centuries.”] The MUA Collection.&lt;/ref&gt; This first presence of Asians was limited to [[Northeast Brazil]], especially [[Bahia]], but others were brought as cultivators, textile workers and miners to [[Pará]] and other parts of the Northeast.

The largest populations with Pardo individuals are found in northern and northeastern Brazil, with many inhabiting the states of [[Mato Grosso]], [[Goiás]], [[Espírito Santo]], [[Minas Gerais]], [[Rio de Janeiro (state)]], [[São Paulo (state)]] and [[Paraná (state)]], as well as the Federal District. While the occurrence of Pardos is not uniform across the country, there are states with more people of mixed background than others. It also can happen that Pardos constitute significant numbers within single regions in states.

===Black coloured people===
{{Main|Afro-Brazilian}}
'''Blacks''' constitute the third largest ethnic group of Brazil with around 14,5 million citizens or 7,6 % of the population. These are people who have origins in any of the black populations of Africa. In the country, these are generally used for Brazilians with at least partial [[Sub-Saharan African]] ancestry. Most African Brazilians are the direct descendants of captive Africans who survived the slavery era within the boundaries of the present Brazil, but also with considerable European and Amerindian ancestry. Afro-Brazilians might not directly be compared to Pardo-Brazilians. The number of African genes is substantially higher in Afro-Brazilians, therefore their skin colour is darker compared to mixed-race Brazilians.
Brazil, followed by the US, has the largest '''[[African diaspora]]''' in the Americas.

Today most Blacks are either Catholic or Evangelical. Smaller groups are Irreligious including Atheists and a number of African tradition sects can be found especially in Bahia, notably [[Candomblé]] and [[Umbanda]]. The latter being a syncretism of Roman Catholicism, African traditions, [[Spiritism]] and Indigenous beliefs. A minority of Blacks follows [[Kardecism]], which is a blend of Christianism and [[Spiritualism]] founded in France.

Most Blacks can be found in Bahia and Maranhão states after the colonial period influx, as well as in the northern region of Minas Gerais thanks to the Diamond and Gold Rush period and parts of Rio de Janeiro due to slavery in the former royal court after its transfer.

===Yellow coloured people===
{{Main|Asian Brazilian}}
{{See also|Japanese Brazilian|Chinese Brazilian|Korean Brazilian}}
'''Asians''', in common parlance referred to East-Asians, constitute the fourth largest ethnic group of Brazil with '''2.2 million''' people, what may not include mixed East Asians. The largest East-Asian ethnic group in the country are the [[Japanese Brazilian|Japanese]]. 
Brazil has the largest population of Japanese people outside Japan, being in percentage or absolute numbers. The number of Japanese Brazilians revolves around '''1.8 million''' descendants and the Japanese community also comprises '''57 thousand Japanese nationals'''.&lt;ref name="Gonzalez"/&gt;&lt;ref name=japantimes/&gt;&lt;ref name="japao100.com.br"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IBGE traça perfil dos imigrantes"/&gt; According to Ethnologue over '''400 thousand people speak Japanese''' in Brazil.

The others are mainly Chinese, Taiwanese and South Korean. Due to the recent immigration of Chinese citizens to Brazil the number of these people is constantly on the rise.

South Asians also left descendants in Brazil, mostly East Indians, Vietnamese, Indonesians and Bengali. However, there is a current stronger influx of Bengalis (between 5 and 10,000) nowadays, most of them refugees. Moreover, South Asians might not be included into the category of people with "yellow" skin colour, as they are physically different from Eastern Asian populations and therefore more likely to fit into the Pardo category.

There are large groups of East Asian Catholics as well as non-religious Asians. 
[[Buddhism in Brazil]] is also very common among non-Asians, especially Whites, with Japanese Buddhism being among the most usual and oldest forms. 
[[Shinto]] practices involving life style and funerals are very common in Nipponese families of São Paulo and Paraná states. Shinto-derived [[Japanese New Religions]] are very popular throughout the nation. The largest Nipponese new religions are [[Seicho-no-Ie]], [[Tenrikyo]], [[PL Kyodan|Perfect Liberty Kyodan]] and [[Church of World Messianity]].  
[[Korean Confucianism]] and Chinese Confucianism are especially found in São Paulo capital.

===Indigenous people===
{{Main|Native Brazilian}}
'''Indigenous people''' constitute the fifth largest ethnic group of Brazil, with around '''800,000''' individuals. It is the oldest ethnic group in the country, mainly located in the surroundings of the Amazon basin inside the [[Amazon Forest]] but also in various reservations throughout the five geographical regions. Compared to the total population of the country the number might seem small, but millions of Brazilians actually have some Indigenous ancestry. This happened mainly because of the miscegenation of indigenous tribes with colonial settlers.

Around '''180 Native or autoctone languages are spoken in Brazil''' by 160 thousand people, many of them have threatened status. Most Natives can communicate in Portuguese and tribes in reservations have their mother tongue and Portuguese taught at schools. Today 517 thousand people live in Indigenous reservations.

== Genetic studies ==
Genetic studies have shown the Brazilian population as a whole to have European, African and Native Americans components.

===Autosomal studies===
A 2015 autosomal genetic study, which also analysed data of 25 studies of 38 different Brazilian populations concluded that: European ancestry accounts for 62% of the heritage of the population, followed by the African (21%) and the Native American (17%). The European contribution is highest in Southern Brazil (77%), the African highest in Northeast Brazil (27%) and the Native American is the highest in Northern Brazil (32%).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/ajhb.22714|pmid=25820814|title=Meta-analysis of Brazilian genetic admixture and comparison with other Latin America countrieBold text|journal=American Journal of Human Biology|volume=27|issue=5|pages=674–80|year=2015|last1=Rodrigues De Moura|first1=Ronald|last2=Coelho|first2=Antonio Victor Campos|last3=De Queiroz Balbino|first3=Valdir|last4=Crovella|first4=Sergio|last5=Brandão|first5=Lucas André Cavalcanti}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An autosomal study from 2013, with nearly 1300 samples from all of the Brazilian regions, found a pred. degree of European ancestry combined with African and Native American contributions, in varying degrees. 'Following an increasing North to South gradient, European ancestry was the most prevalent in all urban populations (with values up to 74%). The populations in the North consisted of a significant proportion of Native American ancestry that was about two times higher than the African contribution. Conversely, in the Northeast, Center-West and Southeast, African ancestry was the second most prevalent. At an intrapopulation level, all urban
populations were highly admixed, and most of the variation in ancestry proportions was observed between individuals within each population rather than among population'.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0075145|pmid=24073242|title=Revisiting the Genetic Ancestry of Brazilians Using Autosomal AIM-Indels|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=8|issue=9|pages=e75145|year=2013|last1=Saloum De Neves Manta|first1=Fernanda|last2=Pereira|first2=Rui|last3=Vianna|first3=Romulo|last4=Rodolfo Beuttenmüller De Araújo|first4=Alfredo|last5=Leite Góes Gitaí|first5=Daniel|last6=Aparecida Da Silva|first6=Dayse|last7=De Vargas Wolfgramm|first7=Eldamária|last8=Da Mota Pontes|first8=Isabel|last9=Ivan Aguiar|first9=José|last10=Ozório Moraes|first10=Milton|last11=Fagundes De Carvalho|first11=Elizeu|last12=Gusmão|first12=Leonor|pmc=3779230|bibcode=2013PLoSO...875145S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An autosomal [[DNA]] study (2011), with nearly 1000 samples from every major race group ("whites", "pardos" and "blacks", according to their respective proportions) all over the country found out a major European contribution, followed by a high African contribution and an important Native American component.&lt;ref name="plosone1"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0017063 |title=The Genomic Ancestry of Individuals from Different Geographical Regions of Brazil Is More Uniform Than Expected|year=2011|last1=Pena|first1=Sérgio D.

According to an [[Autosome|autosomal]] DNA study from 2010, "a new portrayal of each [[ethnicity]] contribution to the DNA of Brazilians, obtained with samples from the five regions of the country, has indicated that, on average, European ancestors are responsible for nearly 80% of the genetic heritage of the population. The variation between the regions is small, with the possible exception of the South, where the European contribution reaches nearly 90%. The results, published by the scientific magazine ''[[American Journal of Human Biology]]'' by a team of the [[Universidade Católica de Brasília|Catholic University of Brasília]], show that, in Brazil, physical indicators such as skin colour, colour of the eyes and colour of the hair have little to do with the genetic ancestry of each person, which has been shown in previous studies (regardless of census classification).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/ciencia/ult306u633465.shtml DNA de brasileiro é 80% europeu, indica estudo]. .folha.uol.com.br (1970-01-01). Retrieved on 2012-05-19.&lt;/ref&gt; "Ancestry informative SNPs can be useful to estimate individual and population biogeographical ancestry. Brazilian population is characterized by a genetic background of three parental populations (European, African, and Brazilian Native Amerindians) with a wide degree and diverse patterns of admixture. In this work we analyzed the information content of 28 ancestry-informative SNPs into multiplexed panels using three parental population sources (African, Amerindian, and European) to infer the genetic admixture in an urban sample of the five Brazilian geopolitical regions. The SNPs assigned apart the parental populations from each other and thus can be applied for ancestry estimation in a three hybrid admixed population. Data was used to infer genetic ancestry in Brazilians with an admixture model. Pairwise estimates of F(st) among the five Brazilian geopolitical regions suggested little genetic differentiation only between the South and the remaining regions. Estimates of ancestry results are consistent with the heterogeneous genetic profile of Brazilian population, with a major contribution of European ancestry (0.771) followed by African (0.143) and Amerindian contributions (0.085). The described multiplexed SNP panels can be useful tool for bioanthropological studies but it can be mainly valuable to control for spurious results in genetic association studies in admixed populations".&lt;ref name="wiley1" /&gt; It is important to note that "the samples came from free of charge paternity test takers, thus as the researchers made it explicit: "the paternity tests were free of charge, the population samples involved people of variable socioeconomic strata, although ''likely to be leaning slightly
towards the ‘‘pardo’’ group''".&lt;ref name="wiley1"/&gt;

According to another autosomal DNA study from 2008, by the University of Brasília (UnB), European ancestry dominates in the whole of Brazil (in all regions), accounting for 65.90% of ancestry of the population, followed by the African contribution (24.80%) and the Native American (9.3%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://repositorio.unb.br/bitstream/10482/5542/1/2008_NeideMOGodinho.pdf|title=the impact of migrations in the constitution of Latin American populations|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2014 autosomal DNA study, which analysed data from 1594 samples from all of the Brazilian regions, found that Brazilians show widespread European ancestry with the highest levels being observed in the south. African ancestry is also widespread (except for the south) and reaches its highest values in the East of the country. Native American ancestry is highest in the north-west (Amazonia). In conclusion, European ancestry accounts for 82% of the heritage of the population, followed by the African (9%) and the Native American (9%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1004572|pmid=25254375|title=Admixture in Latin America: Geographic Structure, Phenotypic Diversity and Self-Perception of Ancestry Based on 7,342 Individuals|journal=PLoS Genetics|volume=10|issue=9|pages=e1004572|year=2014|last1=Ruiz-Linares|first1=Andrés|last2=Adhikari|first2=Kaustubh|last3=Acuña-Alonzo|first3=Victor|last4=Quinto-Sanchez|first4=Mirsha|last5=Jaramillo|first5=Claudia|last6=Arias|first6=William|last7=Fuentes|first7=Macarena|last8=Pizarro|first8=María|last9=Everardo|first9=Paola|last10=De Avila|first10=Francisco|last11=Gómez-Valdés|first11=Jorge|last12=León-Mimila|first12=Paola|last13=Hunemeier|first13=Tábita|last14=Ramallo|first14=Virginia|last15=Silva De Cerqueira|first15=Caio C.|last16=Burley|first16=Mari-Wyn|last17=Konca|first17=Esra|last18=De Oliveira|first18=Marcelo Zagonel|last19=Veronez|first19=Mauricio Roberto|last20=Rubio-Codina|first20=Marta|last21=Attanasio|first21=Orazio|last22=Gibbon|first22=Sahra|last23=Ray|first23=Nicolas|last24=Gallo|first24=Carla|last25=Poletti|first25=Giovanni|last26=Rosique|first26=Javier|last27=Schuler-Faccini|first27=Lavinia|last28=Salzano|first28=Francisco M.|last29=Bortolini|first29=Maria-Cátira|last30=Canizales-Quinteros|first30=Samuel|display-authors=29|pmc=4177621}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===MtDna and y DNA studies===

Haplogroup frequencies do not determine phenotype nor admixture. They are very general genetic snapshots, primarily useful in examining past population group migratory patterns. Only autosomal DNA testing can reveal admixture structures, since it analyses millions of alleles from both maternal and paternal sides. Contrary to yDNA or mtDNA, which are focused on one single lineage (paternal or maternal) the autosomal DNA studies profile the whole ancestry of a given individual, being more accurate in describing the complex patterns of ancestry in a given place. According to a genetic study in 2000 who analysed 247 samples (mainly identified as "white" in Brazil) who came from four of the five major geographic regions of the country, the [[Mitochondrial DNA|mtDNA]] pool (maternal lineages) of present-day Brazilians clearly reflects the imprints of the early Portuguese colonization process (involving directional mating), as well as the recent immigrant waves (from Europe) of the last century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1086/303004|title=The Ancestry of Brazilian mtDNA Lineages|year=2000|last1=Alvessilva|first1=J|last2=Dasilvasantos|first2=M|last3=Guimaraes|first3=P|last4=Ferreira|first4=A|last5=Bandelt|first5=H|last6=Pena|first6=S|last7=Prado|first7=V|journal=The American Journal of Human Genetics|volume=67|issue=2|pages=444–61|pmid=10873790|pmc=1287189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a study in 2001, the vast majority of [[Human Y-chromosome DNA haplogroup|Y chromosomes]] (male lineages) in white Brazilian males, regardless of their regional source, is of European origin (&gt;90% contribution), with a very low frequency of sub-Saharan African chromosomes and a complete absence of Amerindian contributions. These results configure a picture of strong directional mating in Brazil involving European males, on one side, and European, African and Amerindian females, on the other.&lt;ref name=j1&gt;{{cite journal| pmc=1234928|pmid=11090340|title= The Phylogeography of Brazilian Y-Chromosome Lineages | doi=10.1086/316931|volume=68|issue=1|date=January 2001|journal=Am.

In a study from 2016, the authors investigated a set of 41 Y-SNPs in 1217 unrelated males from the five Brazilian geopolitical regions. A total of 22 different haplogroups were detected in the whole Brazilian sample, revealing the three major continental origins of the current population, namely from America, Europe and Africa. The genetic differences observed among regions were, however, consistent with the colonization history of the country. The sample from the Northern region presented the highest Native American ancestry (8.4%), whereas the more pronounced African contribution could be observed in the Northeastern population (15.1%). The Central-Western and Southern samples showed the higher European contributions (95.7% and 93.6%, respectively). The Southeastern region presented significant European (86.1%) and African (12.0%) contributions. Portugal was estimated to be the main source of the male European lineages to Central-West, Southeast and South Brazil. The North and the Northeast showed the highest contribution from France and Italy, respectively. The highest migration rate from Lebanon was to the Central-Weast, whereas a significant migration from Germany was observed to the Central East, Southeast and South.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0152573|title=Male Lineages in Brazil: Intercontinental Admixture and Stratification of the European Background, Resque et al.

In the Brazilian "white" and "pardos" the autosomal ancestry (the sum of the ancestors of a given individual) tends to be in most cases predominantly European, with often a non European mtDNA (which points to a non European ancestor somewhere down the maternal line), which is explained by the women marrying newly arrived colonists, during the formation of the Brazilian people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laboratoriogene.com.br/?area=genealogiaAncestralidadeDiferenca |title=Laboratório GENE – Núcleo de Genética Médica |publisher=Laboratoriogene.com.br|accessdate=2011-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16142">The '''California Legislative LGBT Caucus''' is an American political organization formed in June 2002 and composed of openly [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]] and [[transgender]] members of the [[California State Legislature]].&lt;ref name=laird&gt;{{cite web|url=http://democrats.assembly.ca.gov/members/a27/press/a272006051.htm |title=California Legislative LGBT Caucus Elects Laird Chair |accessdate=2008-06-04 |publisher=California State Assembly |date=2006-12-05 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080613061500/http://democrats.assembly.ca.gov/members/a27/press/a272006051.htm |archivedate=2008-06-13 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The caucus currently has eight members, which is a record held over three non-consecutive sessions.

This group is contrasted to other '''LGBT Equality Caucuses''' in that the California caucus consists entirely of LGBT legislators while other LGBT Equality Caucuses consist of all orientations. Both, however, promote the promulgation of LGBT-affirming laws within the legislature.

==Role==
The caucus was established to champion legislation that advances equality and the rights of LGBT Californians. Its members have introduced and passed numerous measures related to gay rights, including [[Same-sex marriage in California|two same-sex marriage bills]] (both vetoed by the governor), bills prohibiting discrimination in state government, tackling orientation-based bullying in schools and adequately funding [[HIV/AIDS]] treatment.&lt;ref name=laird/&gt; In December 2008, in the wake of the passage of [[California Proposition 8 (2008)|Proposition 8]], members of the LGBT Caucus pushed a resolution expressing the legislature's opinion that the proposition was unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sacbee.com/capitolandcalifornia/story/1444069.html |title=California Legislature's gay caucus introduces anti-Prop. 8 resolution |accessdate=2008-12-31 |work=[[Sacramento Bee]] |date=2008-12-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216023532/http://www.sacbee.com/capitolandcalifornia/story/1444069.html |archivedate=December 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the caucus sponsors an annual LGBT Pride Exhibit every June and presents the LGBT Pride Recognition Awards to outstanding Californians. In 2006, several [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] legislators boycotted the awards ceremony, walking off the Assembly floor as the awards were presented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.news10.net/storyfull2.aspx?storyid=19346 |title=GOP Lawmakers Walk Out Over Gay Recognition |accessdate=2008-06-04 |work=[[News10]] |date=2006-08-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20070616104223/http://www.news10.net/storyfull2.aspx?storyid=19346 |archivedate=2007-06-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://ebar.com/news/article.php?sec=news&amp;article=4012 |title= Over GOP objections, Assembly proclaims Pride |accessdate=2009-06-28 |work=[[Bay Area Reporter]] |date=2009-06-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This boycott stalled the ceremony for several years until 2009 when it was resurrected.  In each year since, many Republicans have boycotted the ceremony.

==Members==
[[File:CA LGBT legislators.png|thumb|400px|Number of openly LGBT California state legislators by session]]
17 openly [[LGBT]] people have served in the legislature and been members of the caucus – all gay or lesbian and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]]. Eight of them are current office holders.

In addition, there has been one gay member of the legislature who, despite being open about his sexual orientation, was not a member of the caucus.

There have also been members of the legislature who, though not open about their sexuality at the time they served in public office, subsequently declared themselves gay or lesbian.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11740">'''Calle Jonsson''' (born 9 June 1983) is a [[Swedes|Swedish]] citizen born in [[Långträsk]], [[Piteå]] who was arrested in July 2001 on the [[Greece|Greek]] island of [[Kos]], accused of attempted murder. His case is one of Sweden's most known and reported criminal cases in modern times.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.svd.se/nyheter/inrikes/ny-rattegang-mot-calle-jonsson-familjen-begar-hjalp-hos-justitieministern_287835.svd Ny rättegång mot Calle Jonsson - familjen begär hjälp hos justitieministern] [[Svenska Dagbladet]], 4 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

== Detention and first trial ==
Jonsson was arrested on the island of Kos on 26 July 2001, accused of attacking Christoforos Serdaris—a waiter from [[Thessaloniki]], Greece—while on holiday.&lt;ref name=notguilty/&gt;&lt;ref name=light/&gt;  Serdaris lost consciousness after he had been stabbed five times in the thigh, and three times in the chest and abdomen.&lt;ref name=pointed/&gt; Jonsson denied all charges against him from the time he was arrested.&lt;ref name=notguilty/&gt; He was in custody until February 2002 when he was released on bail and returned to Sweden.&lt;ref name=notguilty/&gt; In November 2003, a Swedish court ruled that he must return to Greece to face trial.&lt;ref name=pointed/&gt; Jonsson's family told the newspaper ''[[Aftonbladet]]'' that Serdaris had sought a payoff of {{Currency|160000|SEK}}, and began the legal proceedings when the family refused to pay.&lt;ref name=tried&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.thelocal.se/621/20041113/ | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070420104010/http://www.thelocal.se/621/20041113/ | archivedate = 2007-04-20 | title = Swedish knife suspect to be tried in Greece | date = 13 November 2004 | newspaper = The Local | accessdate = 10 July 2011 | publisher = The Local Europe | location = Stockholm }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jonsson decided not to attend the trial, as he said he did not trust the Greek justice system.

In the autumn 2004 Greece decided to have Jonsson extradited to the country via a [[European arrest warrant]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dn.se/nyheter/sverige/nya-anklagelser-mot-calle-jonsson-1.808011 Nya anklagelser mot Calle Jonsson] [[Dagens Nyheter]] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326021850/http://www.dn.se/nyheter/sverige/nya-anklagelser-mot-calle-jonsson-1.808011 |date=March 26, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Swedish Supreme Court granted the request in November 2004.&lt;ref name=notguilty/&gt;  The request marked the first time Sweden was compelled to extradite a citizen under a 2004 law requiring [[European Union]] member states to trust each other's legal systems.&lt;ref name=tried/&gt;  An earlier extradition attempt had failed when Greece's parliament did not ratify the European arrest warrant legislation.&lt;ref name=couldface&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.thelocal.se/512/20041014/ | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070420104010/http://www.thelocal.se/512/20041014/ | archivedate = 2007-04-20 | title = Knife attack suspect could face Greek trial | date = 14 October 2004 | newspaper = The Local | accessdate = 10 July 2011 | publisher = The Local Europe | location = Stockholm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jonsson was handed over to the Greek courts in January 2005 after he had appealed the ruling to all Swedish authorities.  During the trial held on the isle of [[Rhodes]], the prosecution described a fight between Jonsson and Serdaris.&lt;ref name=notguilty/&gt;&lt;ref name=light&gt;{{cite news| url = http://www.thelocal.se/1252/20050408/| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121008065248/http://www.thelocal.se/1252/20050408/| archivedate = 2012-10-08 | title = Greek stabbing: 'Give Swede a light sentence' | newspaper = The Local | date = 8 April 2005 | accessdate = 10 July 2011 | publisher = The Local Europe | location = Stockholm }}&lt;/ref&gt; Serdaris claimed that Jonsson had attacked him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/article279009.ab Därför friades Calle Jonsson] [[Aftonbladet]], 13 April 2005&lt;/ref&gt; [[DNA]] evidence showed that Serdaris's blood was on the shirt Jonsson was wearing at the time of the alleged attack.  Jonsson claimed that the Greek police had smeared his shirt with Serdaris's blood in an attempt to frame him.&lt;ref name=light/&gt;  Greek police did not examine the crime scene.&lt;ref name=light/&gt;  According to Jonsson's attorney, [[Leif Silbersky]], the Greek police had placed Jonsson's clothes in the same drawer as Serdaris's clothes, causing DNA contamination.&lt;ref name=notguilty/&gt;  The clothing was held in Kos after the attack but was not analyzed before the trial; in fact, the clothes were not moved from Kos to the courtroom in Rhodes until the prosecutor requested an adjournment to have them brought in.&lt;ref name=pointed&gt;{{cite news  | url = http://www.thelocal.se/1228/20050405/  | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121008065317/http://www.thelocal.se/1228/20050405/  | archivedate = 2012-10-08 | title = Swedish knife suspect pointed out in Greek court | date = 5 April 2005 | newspaper = The Local | accessdate = 10 July 2011 | publisher = The Local Europe | location = Stockholm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Silbersky also pointed out that Serdaris did not identify Jonsson as his attacker at the time of the incident.&lt;ref name=pointed/&gt; When Serdaris was first shown Jonsson, Serdaris said that Jonsson could not be the person who attacked him.&lt;ref name=tried/&gt;

Georgios Economou, the prosecutor, said that Jonsson was found lying under Sedaris, which could have indicated Jonsson stabbed him in self-defense, according to Economou.&lt;ref name=light/&gt;  Economou also noted Jonsson's youth and lack of fluency in Greek. Accordingly, Economou recommended a mild sentence.&lt;ref name=light/&gt; Jonsson faced a maximum prison sentence of 20 years, which, per the terms of his extradition agreement, would have been served in a Swedish prison.&lt;ref name=tried/&gt;

On 12 April 2005, the jury unanimously found Jonsson not guilty.&lt;ref name=notguilty&gt;{{cite news | title = Kos knife attack: Swede found not guilty | date = 12 April 2005 | newspaper = The Local | accessdate = 10 July 2011 | publisher = The Local Europe | location = Stockholm | url = http://www.thelocal.se/1270/20050412/ | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121008065229/http://www.thelocal.se/1270/20050412/ | archivedate = 2012-10-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was released immediately.&lt;ref name=notguilty/&gt;  Serdaris's lawyer announced plans to appeal.&lt;ref name=notguilty/&gt;

==Retrial==
In November 2006, the Greek [[Court of Cassation (Greece)|Court of Cassation]] ruled that Jonsson must be retried.&lt;ref name=retrial&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.thelocal.se/5657/20061130/ | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061202070518/http://www.thelocal.se/5657/20061130/ | archivedate = 2006-12-02 | title = Retrial ordered for Calle Jonsson | date = 30 November 2006 | newspaper = The Local | accessdate = 10 July 2011 | publisher = The Local Europe | location = Stockholm }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ruling stated, "We wonder how the t-shirt came into contact with the stabbed person's shoes and trousers."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dn.se/nyheter/sverige/rattegangen-mot-calle-jonsson-tas-om-1.679789 Rättegången mot Calle Jonsson tas om] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090413160937/http://www.dn.se/nyheter/sverige/rattegangen-mot-calle-jonsson-tas-om-1.679789 |date=April 13, 2009 }} Dagens Nyheter&lt;/ref&gt;  The Swedish Foreign Ministry described the court's order as "extremely surprising".&lt;ref name=retrial/&gt;

The trial was supposed to begin on 19 November 2007 but was postponed when Jonsson failed to appear.&lt;ref name=postponed&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.thelocal.se/9139/20071119/ | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071120023703/http://www.thelocal.se/9139/20071119/ | archivedate = 2007-11-20 | title = Calle Jonsson retrial postponed | date = 19 November 2007 | newspaper = The Local | accessdate = 10 July 2011 | publisher = The Local Europe | location = Stockholm }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Jonsson's lawyer Silbersky had advised him not to attend; if he had appeared voluntarily and were found guilty, he would have served his sentence in a Greek jail.&lt;ref name=postponed/&gt; If the Greek authorities were forced to issue a European arrest warrant for him, he would have the option to serve his sentence in a Swedish prison.&lt;ref name=postponed/&gt;  A strike by lawyers in Greece also contributed to the postponement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dn.se/nyheter/varlden/rattegangen-mot-calle-jonsson-uppskjuten-1.719276 Rättegången mot Calle Jonsson uppskjuten] Dagens Nyheter {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090330033429/http://www.dn.se/nyheter/varlden/rattegangen-mot-calle-jonsson-uppskjuten-1.719276 |date=March 30, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2009, Greek officials charged Jonsson and his parents with perjury, false statement, and aggravated defamation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.nsd.se/nyheter/artikel.aspx?ArticleId=4560773 | title = Nya anklagelser mot Calle Jonsson Norrländska Socialdemokraten | date = 9 April 2009 |trans-title=New charges against Calle Jonsson | language = Swedish | newspaper = Norrländska Socialdemokraten | accessdate = 10 July 2011 | last = Spetth | first = Stina }}&lt;/ref&gt; Silbersky called the charges "absolutely ridiculous", saying that the case had become a matter of prestige for the Greek officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://stockholm.expressen.se/nyheter/1.1479960/calles-mamma-jag-ar-livradd | title = Calles mamma: "Jag är livrädd" |trans-title=Calle's mother: 'I'm terrified' | language = Swedish | date = 26 February 2009 | last = Berg | first = Ida Thell | last2 = Thunborg | first2 = Peter | newspaper = Expressen | publisher = Kvällstidningen Expressen }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
Parallels to Jonsson's case were drawn with the case of "Swedish Anna", a Swedish woman vacationing in Greece who reported being raped to the Greek police. The case was closed before it went to trial, and Anna was prosecuted by the Greek justice system for defamation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.svd.se/nyheter/inrikes/paverkar-inte-greklands-turism_6099509.svd |title='Våldtäkt stigmatiserat i Grekland' |trans-title='Rape stigmatized in Greece' |newspaper=Svenska Dagbladet |publisher=Kena K.

{{Communication}}
'''Communication''' (from Latin ''commūnicāre'', meaning "to share"&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|communication|accessdate=2013-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is the act of conveying [[meaning (semiotics)|meanings]] from one [[Subject (philosophy)|entity]] or [[Organization|group]] to another through the use of mutually understood [[sign]]s, symbols,  and [[Semiosis|semiotic]] rules.

The main steps inherent to all [[models of communication|communication]] are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://math.harvard.edu/~ctm/home/text/others/shannon/entropy/entropy.pdf |format=PDF |title=A Mathematical Theory of Communication |author=C.E. Shannon |website=Math.harvard.edu |accessdate=2017-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# [[Transmission (telecommunications)|Transmission]] of the encoded message as a sequence of signals using a specific [[Communication channel|channel]] or [[Media (communication)|medium]].

The [[science|scientific study]] of communication can be divided into:
* [[Information theory]] which studies the quantification, storage, and communication of information in general;
* [[Communication studies]] which concerns human communication;
* [[Biosemiotics]] which examines communication in and between living organisms in general.

The channel of communication can be [[visual]], [[sound|auditory]], [[Somatosensory system|tactile]] (such as in [[Braille]]) and [[Haptic communication|haptic]], [[olfactory]], [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic]], or [[biochemistry|biochemical]].

Human communication is unique for its extensive use of [[language|abstract language]]. Development of [[civilization]] has been closely linked with [[History of telecommunication|progress]] in [[telecommunication]].

==Non-verbal==
{{Main|Nonverbal communication}}
[[Nonverbal communication]] describes the processes of conveying a type of information in the form of non-linguistic representations. Examples of nonverbal communication include [[haptic communication]], [[Chronemics|chronemic communication]], [[gestures]], [[body language]], [[facial expressions]], [[eye contact]], and how one dresses. Nonverbal communication also relates to the intent of a message. Examples of intent are voluntary, intentional movements like shaking a hand or winking, as well as involuntary, such as sweating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Types of Body Language|url = http://www.simplybodylanguage.com/types-of-body-language.html|website = Simplybodylanguage.com|access-date = 2016-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speech also contains nonverbal elements known as [[paralanguage]], e.g. [[rhythm (linguistics)|rhythm]], [[intonation (linguistics)|intonation]], [[tempo of speech|tempo]], and [[Stress (linguistics)|stress]]. It affects communication most at the subconscious level and establishes trust. Likewise, written texts include nonverbal elements such as handwriting style, the spatial arrangement of words and the use of [[emoticons]] to convey emotion.

Nonverbal communication demonstrates one of [[Paul Watzlawick|Paul Wazlawick's]] laws: you cannot not communicate. Once proximity has formed awareness, living creatures begin interpreting any signals received.&lt;ref&gt;Wazlawick, Paul (1970's) opus&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the functions of nonverbal communication in humans are to complement and illustrate, to reinforce and emphasize, to replace and substitute, to control and regulate, and to contradict the denovative message.

Nonverbal cues are heavily relied on to express communication and to interpret others' communication and can replace or substitute verbal messages. However, non-verbal communication is ambiguous. When verbal messages contradict non-verbal messages, observation of non-verbal behaviour is relied on to judge another's attitudes and feelings, rather than assuming the truth of the verbal message alone.

There are several reasons as to why non-verbal communication plays a vital role in communication:

"Non-verbal communication is omnipresent." &lt;ref&gt;(Burgoon, J., Guerrero, L., Floyd, K., (2010). Nonverbal Communication, Taylor &amp; Francis. p. 3 )&lt;/ref&gt; They are included in every single communication act. To have total communication, all non-verbal channels such as the body, face, voice, appearance, touch, distance, timing, and other environmental forces must be engaged during face-to-face interaction. Written communication can also have non-verbal attributes. E-mails and web chats allow an individual's the option to change text font colours, stationary, emoticons, and capitalization in order to capture non-verbal cues into a verbal medium.

"Non-verbal behaviours are multifunctional." &lt;ref name="Burgoon et al., p. 4"&gt;(Burgoon et al., p. 4)&lt;/ref&gt; Many different non-verbal channels are engaged at the same time in communication acts and allow the chance for simultaneous messages to be sent and received.

"Non-verbal behaviours may form a universal language system." &lt;ref name="Burgoon et al., p. 4"/&gt; Smiling, crying, pointing, caressing, and glaring are non-verbal behaviours that are used and understood by people regardless of nationality. Such non-verbal signals allow the most basic form of communication when verbal communication is not effective due to language barriers.

==Verbal==
[[Verbal communication]] is the spoken or written conveyance of a message. Human [[language]] can be defined as a [[system]] of [[symbol]]s (sometimes known as [[lexeme]]s) and the [[grammar]]s ([[wikt:rule|rules]]) by which the symbols are manipulated. The word "language" also refers to common properties of languages. [[Language acquisition|Language learning]] normally occurs most intensively during human childhood. Most of the thousands of human languages use patterns of [[sound]] or [[gesture]] for symbols which enable communication with others around them. Languages tend to share certain properties, although there are exceptions. There is [[language or dialect|no defined line]] between a language and a [[dialect]]. [[Constructed language]]s such as [[Esperanto]], [[programming language]]s, and various mathematical formalism is not necessarily restricted to the properties shared by human languages.

As previously mentioned, language can be characterized as symbolic. Charles Ogden and I.A Richards developed The Triangle of Meaning model to explain the symbol (the relationship between a word), the referent (the thing it describes), and the meaning (the thought associated with the word and the thing).

The properties of language are governed by rules. Language follows phonological rules (sounds that appear in a language), syntactic rules (arrangement of words and punctuation in a sentence), semantic rules (the agreed upon meaning of words), and pragmatic rules (meaning derived upon context).

The meanings that are attached to words can be literal, or otherwise known as denotative; relating to the topic being discussed, or, the meanings take context and relationships into account, otherwise known as connotative; relating to the feelings, history, and power dynamics of the communicators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ferguson |first=Sherry Devereaux |last2=Lennox-Terrion |first2=Jenepher |last3=Ahmed |first3=Rukhsana |last4=Jaya |first4=Peruvemba |year=2014 |title=Communication in Everyday Life: Personal and Professional Contexts |url=https://books.google.es/books?id=HZFXngEACAAJ |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=Canada |pages=464 |isbn=9780195449280}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrary to popular belief, [[signed languages]] of the world (e.g., [[American Sign Language]]) are considered to be verbal communication because their sign vocabulary, grammar, and other linguistic structures abide by all the necessary classifications as spoken languages. There are however, nonverbal elements to signed languages, such as the speed, intensity, and size of signs that are made. A signer might sign "yes" in response to a question, or they might sign a sarcastic-large slow yes to convey a different nonverbal meaning. The sign yes is the verbal message while the other movements add nonverbal meaning to the message.

==Written communication and its historical development==
Over time the forms of and ideas about communication have evolved through the continuing progression of technology. Advances include communications psychology and media psychology, an emerging field of study.

The progression of written communication can be divided into three "information communication revolutions":&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Xin Li|title=Complexity Theory – the Holy Grail of 21st Century|url=http://www.csee.wvu.edu/~xinl/complexity.html|publisher=Lane Dept of CSEE, West Virginia University|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130815234045/http://www.csee.wvu.edu/~xinl/complexity.html|archivedate=2013-08-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Written communication first emerged through the use of pictographs. The [[pictogram]]s were made in stone, hence written communication was not yet mobile. Pictograms began to develop standardized and simplified forms.
# The next step occurred when writing began to appear on [[paper]], papyrus, clay, wax, and other media with commonly shared writing systems, leading to adaptable [[alphabet]]s. Communication became mobile.
# The final stage is characterized by the transfer of information through controlled waves of [[electromagnetic radiation]] (i.e., radio, microwave, infrared) and other [[Signal (electrical engineering)|electronic signals]].

Communication is thus a process by which meaning is assigned and conveyed in an attempt to create shared understanding. Gregory Bateson called it "the replication of tautologies in the universe.&lt;ref&gt;Bateson, Gregory (1960) Steps to an Ecology of Mind&lt;/ref&gt; This process, which requires a vast repertoire of skills in [[interpersonal]] processing, listening, observing, speaking, questioning, analyzing, gestures, and evaluating enables [[collaboration]] and [[cooperation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=communication| work=The office of superintendent of Public Instruction| location=Washington}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business==
{{Main|Business communication}}
Business communication is used for a wide variety of activities including, but not limited to: strategic communications planning, media relations, public relations (which can include social media, broadcast and written communications, and more), brand management, reputation management, speech-writing, customer-client relations, and internal/employee communications.

Companies with limited resources may choose to engage in only a few of these activities, while larger organizations may employ a full spectrum of communications. Since it is difficult to develop such a broad range of skills, communications professionals often specialize in one or two of these areas but usually have at least a working knowledge of most of them. By far, the most important qualifications communications professionals can possess are excellent writing ability, good 'people' skills, and the capacity to think critically and strategically.

==Political==
Communication is one of the most relevant tools in political strategies, including persuasion and [[propaganda]]. In mass media research and online media research, the effort of the strategist is that of getting a precise decoding, avoiding "message reactance", that is, message refusal. The reaction to a message is referred also in terms of approach to a message, as follows:
* In "radical reading" the audience rejects the meanings, values, and viewpoints built into the text by its makers. Effect: message refusal.
* In "dominant reading", the audience accepts the meanings, values, and viewpoints built into the text by its makers. Effect: message acceptance.
* In "subordinate reading" the audience accepts, by and large, the meanings, values, and worldview built into the text by its makers. Effect: obey to the message.&lt;ref&gt;Danesi, Marcel (2009), Dictionary of Media and Communications. M.E.Sharpe, Armonk, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;
Holistic approaches are used by communication campaign leaders and communication strategists in order to examine all the options, "actors" and channels that can generate change in the [[semiotic]] landscape, that is, change in [[perceptions]], change in [[credibility]], change in the "[[memetic]] background", change in the image of movements, of candidates, players and managers as perceived by key influencers that can have a role in generating the desired "end-state".

The modern political communication field is highly influenced by the framework and practices of "information operations" doctrines that derive their nature from strategic and military studies. According to this view, what is really relevant is the concept of acting on the Information  Environment. The information environment is the aggregate of individuals, organizations, and systems that collect, process, disseminate, or act on information. This environment consists of three interrelated dimensions, which continuously interact with individuals, organizations, and systems. These dimensions are known as physical, informational, and cognitive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, U.S. Army (2012). Information Operations. Joint Publication 3-13. Joint Doctrine Support Division, 116 Lake View Parkway, Suffolk, VA.|url=http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/new_pubs/jp3_13.pdf|format=PDF|website=Dtic.mil|accessdate=2017-05-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170504054720/http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/new_pubs/jp3_13.pdf|archive-date=2017-05-04|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
Family communication is the study of the communication perspective in a broadly defined family, with intimacy and trusting relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, L.H., &amp; West, R.L. (2013). ''Perspectives on family communication''. Boston: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; The main goal of family communication is to understand the interactions of family and the pattern of behaviors of family members in different circumstances. Open and honest communication creates an atmosphere that allows family members to express their differences as well as love and admiration for one another. It also helps to understand the feelings of one another.

Family communication study looks at topics such as family rules, family roles or family dialectics and how those factors could affect the communication between family members. Researchers develop theories to understand communication behaviors. Family communication study also digs deep into certain time periods of family life such as marriage, parenthood or divorce and how communication stands in those situations. It is important for family members to understand communication as a trusted way which leads to a well constructed family.

==Interpersonal==
In simple terms, [[interpersonal communication]] is the communication between one person and another (or others). It is often referred to as face-to-face communication between two (or more) people. Both verbal and nonverbal communication, or [[body language]], play a part in how one person understands another. In verbal interpersonal communication there are two types of messages being sent: a content message and a relational message. Content messages are messages about the topic at hand and relational messages are messages about the relationship itself.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Interpersonal Communication Seventh Edition|last=Trenholm|first=Sarah|last2=Jensen|first2=Arthur|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2013|isbn=|location=New York|pages=360–361}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that relational messages come across in ''how'' one says something and it demonstrates a person's feelings, whether positive or negative, towards the individual they are talking to, indicating not only how they feel about the topic at hand, but also how they feel about their relationship with the other individual.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

There are many different aspects of [[interpersonal communication]] including:
* Audiovisual Perception of Communication Problems.&lt;ref&gt;Barkhuysen, P., Krahmer, E., Swerts, M., (2004) Audiovisual Perception of Communication Problems, ISCA Archive http://www.isca-speech.org/archive&lt;/ref&gt; The concept follows the idea that our words change what form they take based on the stress level or urgency of the situation. It also explores the concept that stuttering during speech shows the audience that there is a problem or that the situation is more stressful.
* The Attachment Theory.&lt;ref&gt;Bretherton, I., (1992) The Origins of Attachment Theory: John Bowlby and Mary Ainsworth, Developmental Psychology, 28, 759-775&lt;/ref&gt; This is the combined work of John Bowlby and Mary Ainsworth (Ainsworth &amp; Bowlby, 1991) This theory follows the relationships that builds between a mother and child, and the impact it has on their relationships with others.
* Emotional Intelligence and Triggers.&lt;ref&gt;Mazza, J., Emotional Triggers, MABC, CPC&lt;/ref&gt; Emotional Intelligence focuses on the ability to monitor ones own emotions as well as those of others. Emotional Triggers focus on events or people that tend to set off intense, emotional reactions within individuals.
* Attribution Theory.&lt;ref&gt;Bertram, M., (2004) How the Mind Explains Behavior: Folk Explanations, Meaning, and Social Interaction, MIT Press, {{ISBN|978-0-262-13445-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the study of how individuals explain what causes different events and behaviors.
* The Power of Words (Verbal communications).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://2012books.lardbucket.org/books/a-primer-on-communication-studies/s05-listening.html |title=Listening |website=2012books.lardbucket.org |date= |accessdate=2017-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Verbal communication focuses heavily on the power of words, and how those words are said. It takes into consideration tone, volume, and choice of words.
* Nonverbal Communication. It focuses heavily on the setting that the words are conveyed in, as well as the physical tone of the words.
* Ethics in Personal Relations.&lt;ref&gt;Lipthrott, D., What IS Relationship? What is Ethical Partnership?&lt;/ref&gt; It is about a space of mutual responsibility between two individuals, it's about giving and receiving in a relationship. This theory is explored by Dawn J. Lipthrott in the article What IS Relationship? What is Ethical Partnership?
* Deception in Communication.&lt;ref&gt;Hearn, J., (2006) Interpersonal Deception Theory: Ten Lessons for Negotiators&lt;/ref&gt; This concept goes into that everyone lies, and how this can impact relationships. This theory is explored by James Hearn in his article Interpersonal Deception Theory: Ten Lessons for Negotiators
* Conflict in Couples.&lt;ref&gt;Lenhart, A., Duggan, M., (2014) Couples, the Internet, and Social Media&lt;/ref&gt; This focuses on the impact that social media has on relationships, as well as how to communicate through conflict. This theory is explored by Amanda Lenhart and Maeve Duggan in their paper Couples, the Internet, and Social Media

==Barriers to effectiveness==
Barriers to effective communication can retard or distort the message or intention of the message being conveyed. This may result in failure of the communication process or cause an effect that is undesirable. These include filtering, selective perception, information overload, emotions, language, silence, communication apprehension, gender differences and political correctness&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, S., Judge, T., Millett, B., &amp; Boyle, M. (2011). Organisational Behaviour. 6th ed. Pearson, French's Forest, NSW pp. 315–317.&lt;/ref&gt;

This also includes a lack of expressing "knowledge-appropriate" communication, which occurs when a person uses ambiguous or complex legal words, medical jargon, or descriptions of a situation or environment that is not understood by the recipient.
* '''Physical barriers''' – Physical barriers are often due to the nature of the environment. An example of this is the natural barrier which exists if staff is located in different buildings or on different sites. Likewise, poor or outdated equipment, particularly the failure of management to introduce new technology, may also cause problems. Staff shortages are another factor which frequently causes communication difficulties for an organization.
* '''System design''' – [[System design]] faults refer to problems with the structures or systems in place in an organization. Examples might include an organizational structure which is unclear and therefore makes it confusing to know whom to communicate with. Other examples could be inefficient or inappropriate information systems, a lack of supervision or training, and a lack of clarity in roles and responsibilities which can lead to staff being uncertain about what is expected of them.
* '''Attitudinal barriers'''– Attitudinal barriers come about as a result of problems with staff in an organization. These may be brought about, for example, by such factors as poor management, lack of consultation with employees, personality conflicts which can result in people delaying or refusing to communicate, the personal attitudes of individual employees which may be due to lack of motivation or dissatisfaction at work, brought about by insufficient training to enable them to carry out particular tasks, or simply resistance to change due to entrenched attitudes and ideas.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}
* '''Ambiguity of words/phrases''' – Words sounding the same but having different meaning can convey a different meaning altogether. Hence the communicator must ensure that the receiver receives the same meaning. It is better if such words are avoided by using alternatives whenever possible.
* '''Individual linguistic ability''' – The use of [[jargon]], difficult or inappropriate words in communication can prevent the recipients from understanding the message. Poorly explained or misunderstood messages can also result in confusion. However, research in communication has shown that confusion can lend [[legitimation|legitimacy]] to research when persuasion fails.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pmhut.com/what-should-be-included-in-a-project-plan What Should Be Included in a Project Plan]. Retrieved December 18, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://qbox.wharton.upenn.edu/documents/mktg/research/Bafflegab%20Pays.pdf |title=Bafflegab Pays |author=J.

* '''Physiological barriers''' – These may result from individuals' personal discomfort, caused—for example—by ill health, poor eyesight or hearing difficulties.
* '''Bypassing''' – These happens when the communicators (sender and the receiver) do not attach the same symbolic meanings to their words. It is when the sender is expressing a thought or a word but the receiver takes it in a different meaning. For example- ASAP, Rest room
* '''Technological multi-tasking and absorbency''' – With a rapid increase in technologically-driven communication in the past several decades, individuals are increasingly faced with condensed communication in the form of e-mail, text, and social updates. This has, in turn, led to a notable change in the way younger generations communicate and perceive their own self-efficacy to communicate and connect with others. With the ever-constant presence of another "world" in one's pocket, individuals are multi-tasking both physically and cognitively as constant reminders of something else happening somewhere else bombard them. Though perhaps too new of an advancement to yet see long-term effects, this is a notion currently explored by such figures as Sherry Turkle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Technology can sometimes hinder communication, TR staffers observe - The Collegian|url = http://collegian.tccd.edu/?p=3851|website = The Collegian|accessdate = 2016-01-11|language = en-US|date = 2012-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Fear of being criticized''' – This is a major factor that prevents good communication. If we exercise simple practices to improve our communication skill, we can become effective communicators. For example, read an article from the newspaper or collect some news from the television and present it in front of the mirror. This will not only boost your confidence but also improve your language and vocabulary.
* '''Gender barriers''' – Most communicators whether aware or not, often have a set agenda. This is very notable among the different genders. For example, many women are found to be more critical in addressing conflict. It's also been noted that men are more than likely to withdraw from conflict when in comparison to women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bailey|first=Sandra|year=2009|title=Couple Relationships: Communication and Conflict Resolution|url=http://store.msuextension.org/publications/HomeHealthandFamily/MT200917HR.pdf|journal=MSU Extension|volume=17|page=2|via=George Mason University Libraries}}&lt;/ref&gt; This breakdown and comparison not only shows that there are many factors to communication between two specific genders but also room for improvement as well as established guidelines for all.

===Cultural aspects===
Cultural differences exist within countries (tribal/regional differences, dialects etc.), between religious groups and in organisations or at an organisational level – where companies, teams and units may have different expectations, norms and idiolects. Families and family groups may also experience the effect of cultural barriers to communication within and between different family members or groups. For example: words, colours and symbols have different meanings in different cultures. In most parts of the world, nodding your head means agreement, shaking your head means no, except in some parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Nageshwar Rao, Rajendra P. Das, ''Communication skills,'' Himalaya Publishing House, 9789350516669, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;

Communication to a great extent is influenced by culture and [[Cultural variations in adoption|cultural variables]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://expertscolumn.com/content/communication-and-cognitive-components-culture |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-09-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130718080147/http://expertscolumn.com/content/communication-and-cognitive-components-culture |archivedate=2013-07-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beyondintractability.org/bi-essay/cross-cultural-communication |title=Incorrect Link to Beyond Intractability Essay |publisher=Beyond Intractability |date=2017-04-18 |accessdate=2017-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.studymode.com/essays/Important-Components-Of-Cross-Cultural-Communication-595745.html |title=Important Components of Cross-Cultural Communication Essay |website=Studymode.com |date= |accessdate=2017-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ijdesign.org/ojs/index.php/IJDesign/article/view/313/155 |title=Portable Document Format (PDF) |website=Ijdesign.org |date= |accessdate=2017-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Understanding ''cultural aspects of communication'' refers to having knowledge of different cultures in order to communicate effectively with cross culture people. Cultural aspects of communication are of great relevance in today's world which is now a [[Global village (term)|global village]], thanks to [[globalisation]]. Cultural aspects of communication are the cultural differences which influences communication across borders. Impact of cultural differences on communication components are explained below:

# [[Verbal communication]] refers to form of communication which uses spoken and written words for expressing and transferring views and ideas. Language is the most important tool of verbal communication and it is the area where cultural difference play its role. All countries have different [[language]]s and to have a better understanding of different culture it is required to have knowledge of languages of different countries.
# [[Non verbal communication]] is a very wide concept and it includes all the other forms of communication which do not uses written or spoken words. Non verbal communication takes following forms:
#* [[Paralinguistics]] are the voice involved in communication other than actual language and involves [[Tone (linguistics)|tones]], [[pitch (music)|pitch]], vocal cues etc. It also include sounds from throat and all these are greatly influenced by cultural differences across borders.
#* [[Proxemics]] deals with the concept of [[space]] element in communication. Proxemics explains four zones of spaces namely intimate personal, social and public. This concept differs with different culture as the permissible space vary in different countries.
#* [[Artifactics]] studies about the [[nonverbal communication|non verbal signals]] or communication which emerges from personal accessories such as dresses or fashion accessories worn and it varies with culture as people of different countries follow different dressing codes.
#* [[Chronemics]] deal with the time aspects of communication and also include importance given to the time. Some issues explaining this concept are pauses, silences and response lag during an [[interaction]]. This aspect of communication is also influenced by [[cultural difference]]s as it is well known that there is a great difference in the value given by different cultures to time.
#* [[Kinesics]] mainly deals with the [[body language]]s such as [[Neutral spine|postures]], [[gesture]]s, [[head nod]]s, leg movements etc. In different countries, the same gestures and postures are used to convey different messages. Sometimes even a particular kinesic indicating something good in a country may have a negative meaning in any other culture.

So in order to have an effective communication across the world it is desirable to have a knowledge of cultural variables effecting communication.

According to Michael Walsh and [[Ghil'ad Zuckermann]], Western conversational interaction is typically "dyadic", between two particular people, where eye contact is important and the speaker controls the interaction; and "contained" in a relatively short, defined time frame. However, traditional Aboriginal conversational interaction is "communal", broadcast to many people, eye contact is not important, the listener controls the interaction; and "continuous", spread over a longer, indefinite time frame.&lt;ref name=Engaging&gt;{{citation|url=https://arts.adelaide.edu.au/linguistics/guide.pdf |title=Engaging – A Guide to Interacting Respectfully and Reciprocally with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander People, and their Arts Practices and Intellectual Property |author=[[Ghil'ad Zuckermann|Zuckermann, Ghil'ad]] et al |publisher=Australian Government: Indigenous Culture Support |year=2015 |p=12 |accessdate=25 June 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160330114112/http://arts.adelaide.edu.au/linguistics/guide.pdf |archivedate=30 March 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://digitalcollections.anu.edu.au/handle/1885/47329|publisher=Australian National University, North Australia Research Unit|author=Walsh, Michael|year=1997|title=Cross cultural communication problems in Aboriginal Australia|pp=7–9|accessdate=25 June 2016|isbn=9780731528745}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nonhuman==
{{See also|Biocommunication (science)|Interspecies communication|Biosemiotics}}
Every [[information exchange]] between living organisms — i.e. transmission of [[Signalling theory|signals]] that involve a living sender and [[Receiver (information theory)|receiver]] can be considered a form of communication; and even primitive creatures such as corals are competent to communicate. Nonhuman communication also include [[cell signaling]], [[Cellular communication (biology)|cellular communication]], and chemical transmissions between primitive organisms like [[bacteria]] and within the [[plant]] and [[fungi|fungal]] kingdoms.

===Animals===
The broad field of [[animal communication]] encompasses most of the issues in [[ethology]]. [[Animal communication]] can be defined as any [[behavior]] of one animal that affects the current or future behavior of another animal. The study of animal communication, called ''zoo semiotics'' (distinguishable from [[anthroposemiotics]], the study of human communication) has played an important part in the development of [[ethology]], [[sociobiology]], and the study of [[animal cognition]]. Animal communication, and indeed the understanding of the animal world in general, is a rapidly growing field, and even in the 21st century so far, a great share of prior understanding related to diverse fields such as personal symbolic [[name]] use, [[emotion in animals|animal emotions]], [[animal culture]] and [[animal learning|learning]], and even [[animal sexuality|sexual conduct]], long thought to be well understood, has been revolutionized.

===Plants and fungi===
Communication is observed within the plant organism, i.e. within [[plant cells]] and between plant cells, between plants of the same or related species, and between plants and non-plant organisms, especially in the [[rhizosphere|root zone]]. [[Plant root]]s communicate with [[rhizome]] [[bacteria]], [[fungi]], and insects within the [[soil]]. Recent research has shown that most of the microorganism plant communication processes are [[neuron]]-like.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Baluska |first1=F. |last2=Marcuso |first2=Stefano |last3=Volkmann |first3=Dieter |title=Communication in plants: neuronal aspects of plant life |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IH9N4SKWTokC&amp;pg=PA19 |page=19 |year=2006 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis US |isbn=978-3-540-28475-8 |quote=...the emergence of plant neurobiology as the most recent area of plant sciences.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plants also communicate via [[volatile oil|volatiles]] when exposed to [[herbivory]] attack behavior, thus warning neighboring plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Rapid Changes in Tree Leaf Chemistry Induced by Damage: Evidence for Communication Between Plants |authors=Ian T. Baldwin, Jack C. Schultz |journal=Science |year=1983 |doi=10.1126/science.221.4607.277 |volume=221 |issue=4607 |pages=277–279 |pmid=17815197}}&lt;/ref&gt; In parallel they produce other volatiles to attract [[parasitism|parasites]] which attack these herbivores.

Fungi communicate to coordinate and organize their growth and development such as the formation of [[nobelium|Marcelia]] and [[fruiting body|fruiting bodies]]. Fungi communicate with their own and related species as well as with non fungal organisms in a great variety of symbiotic interactions, especially with bacteria, [[unicellular]] eukaryote, plants and insects through biochemicals of biotic origin. The biochemicals trigger the fungal organism to react in a specific manner, while if the same chemical molecules are not part of biotic messages, they do not trigger the fungal organism to react. This implies that fungal organisms can differentiate between molecules taking part in biotic messages and similar molecules being irrelevant in the situation. So far five different primary signalling molecules are known to coordinate different behavioral patterns such as [[filamentation]], [[mating]], growth, and [[pathogenicity]]. Behavioral coordination and production of signaling substances is achieved through interpretation processes that enables the organism to differ between self or non-self, a biotic indicator, biotic message from similar, related, or non-related species, and even filter out "noise", i.e. similar molecules without biotic content.&lt;ref&gt;Witzany, G (ed) (2012). Biocommunication of Fungi. Springer. {{ISBN|978-94-007-4263-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bacteria quorum sensing===
Communication is not a tool used only by humans, plants and animals, but it is also used by microorganisms like bacteria. The process is called [[quorum sensing]]. Through quorum sensing, bacteria are able to sense the density of cells, and regulate gene expression accordingly. This can be seen in both gram positive and gram negative bacteria.
This was first observed by Fuqua ''et al.'' in marine microorganisms like ''[[Vibrio harveyi|V. harveyi]]'' and ''[[Vibrio fischeri|V. fischeri]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Anand, Sandhya. ''[http://www.biotecharticles.com/Biology-Article/Quorum-Sensing-Communication-Plan-For-Microbes-517.html Quorum Sensing- Communication Plan For Microbes]''.

==Models==
{{Main|Models of communication}}

[[File:Linear comm model.svg|Linear Communication Model|thumb|upright=1.25]]

The first major model for communication was introduced by [[Claude Shannon]] and [[Warren Weaver]] for Bell Laboratories in 1949&lt;ref&gt;Shannon, C.E., &amp; Weaver, W. (1949). ''The mathematical theory of communication''. Urbana, Illinois: [[University of Illinois Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; The original model was designed to mirror the functioning of radio and telephone technologies. Their initial model consisted of three primary parts: sender, channel, and receiver. The sender was the part of a telephone a person spoke into, the channel was the telephone itself, and the receiver was the part of the phone where one could hear the other person. Shannon and Weaver also recognized that often there is static that interferes with one listening to a telephone [[conversation]], which they deemed noise.

In a simple model, often referred to as the transmission model or standard view of communication, information or content (e.g. a message in [[natural language]]) is sent in some form (as [[spoken language]]) from an emitter (''emisor'' in the picture)/ sender/ [[encoder]] to a destination/ receiver/ decoder. This common conception of communication simply views communication as a means of sending and receiving information. The strengths of this model are simplicity, generality, and quantifiability. Claude Shannon and Warren Weaver structured this model based on the following elements:
# An information source, which produces a message.
# A transmitter, which encodes the message into signals
# A channel, to which signals are adapted for transmission
# A noise source, which distorts the signal while it propagates through the channel
# A receiver, which 'decodes' (reconstructs) the message from the signal.
# A destination, where the message arrives.

Shannon and Weaver argued that there were three levels of problems for communication within this theory.
:The technical problem: how accurately can the message be transmitted?
:The semantic problem: how precisely is the meaning 'conveyed'?
:The effectiveness problem: how effectively does the received meaning affect behavior?

[[Daniel Chandler]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel Chandler]], "The Transmission Model of Communication", [http://www.aber.ac.uk/media/Documents/short/trans.html Aber.ac.uk] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106130649/http://www.aber.ac.uk/media/Documents/short/trans.html |date=January 6, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; critiques the transmission model by stating:
:It assumes communicators are isolated individuals.
:No allowance for differing purposes.
:No allowance for differing interpretations.
:No allowance for unequal power relations.
:No allowance for situational contexts.

In 1960, David Berlo expanded on Shannon and Weaver's (1949) linear model of communication and created the SMCR Model of Communication.&lt;ref&gt;Berlo, D.K. (1960).'' The process of communication''. New York: Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston.&lt;/ref&gt; The Sender-Message-Channel-Receiver Model of communication separated the model into clear parts and has been expanded upon by other scholars.

Communication is usually described along a few major dimensions: Message (what type of things are communicated), source / emisor / sender / [[encoder]] (by whom), form (in which form), channel (through which [[media (communication)|medium]]), destination / receiver / target / decoder (to whom), and Receiver. Wilbur Schram (1954) also indicated that we should also examine the impact that a message has (both desired and undesired) on the target of the message.&lt;ref&gt;Schramm, W. (1954). How communication works. In W. Schramm (Ed.), ''The process and effects of communication'' (pp. 3–26). Urbana, Illinois: University of Illinois Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Between parties, communication includes acts that confer knowledge and experiences, give advice and commands, and ask questions. These acts may take many forms, in one of the various manners of communication. The form depends on the abilities of the group communicating. Together, communication content and form make [[message]]s that are sent towards a destination. The target can be oneself, another [[Interpersonal Communication|person]] or being, another entity (such as a corporation or group of beings).

Communication can be seen as processes of [[information transmission]] with three levels of [[semiotic]] rules:
# [[Pragmatics|Pragmatic]] (concerned with the relations between signs/expressions and their users)
# [[Semantic]] (study of relationships between signs and symbols and what they represent) and
# [[Syntactic]] (formal properties of signs and symbols).

Therefore, communication is [[Interpersonal relationship|social interaction]] where at least two interacting agents share a common set of signs and a common set of [[semiotic]] rules. This commonly held rule in some sense ignores [[semiotics|autocommunication]], including [[intrapersonal communication]] via [[diary|diaries]] or self-talk, both secondary phenomena that followed the primary acquisition of communicative competences within social interactions.

In light of these weaknesses, Barnlund (2008) proposed a transactional model of communication.&lt;ref&gt;Barnlund, D.C. (2008). A transactional model of communication. In. C.D. Mortensen (Eds.), ''Communication theory'' (2nd ed., pp. 47–57). New Brunswick, New Jersey: Transaction.&lt;/ref&gt; The basic premise of the transactional model of communication is that individuals are simultaneously engaging in the sending and receiving of messages.

In a slightly more complex form a sender and a receiver are linked [[wikt:reciprocal|reciprocally]]. This second attitude of communication, referred to as the constitutive model or constructionist view, focuses on how an individual communicates as the determining factor of the way the message will be interpreted. Communication is viewed as a conduit; a passage in which information travels from one individual to another and this information becomes separate from the communication itself. A particular instance of communication is called a [[speech act]]. The sender's personal filters and the receiver's personal filters may vary depending upon different regional traditions, cultures, or gender; which may alter the intended meaning of message contents. In the presence of "[[noise|communication noise]]" on the transmission channel (air, in this case), reception and decoding of content may be faulty, and thus the speech act may not achieve the desired effect. One problem with this encode-transmit-receive-decode model is that the processes of encoding and decoding imply that the sender and receiver each possess something that functions as a [[codebook]], and that these two code books are, at the very least, similar if not identical. Although something like code books is implied by the model, they are nowhere represented in the model, which creates many conceptual difficulties.

Theories of [[coregulation]] describe communication as a creative and dynamic continuous process, rather than a discrete exchange of information. Canadian media scholar [[Harold Innis]] had the theory that people use different types of media to communicate and which one they choose to use will offer different possibilities for the shape and durability of society.&lt;ref name="Wark1997"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Wark|first=McKenzie|year=1997|title=The Virtual Republic|publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin, St Leonards|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=August 2017}} His famous example of this is using [[ancient Egypt]] and looking at the ways they built themselves out of media with very different properties stone and papyrus. Papyrus is what he called '[[General semantics|Space Binding]]'. it made possible the transmission of written orders across space, empires and enables the waging of distant military campaigns and colonial administration. The other is stone and '[[General semantics|Time Binding]]', through the construction of temples and the pyramids can sustain their authority generation to generation, through this media they can change and shape communication in their society.&lt;ref name="Wark1997"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=August 2017}}

==Noise==
In any communication model, noise is interference with the decoding of messages sent over a channel by an encoder. There are many examples of noise:
* '''Environmental noise.''' Noise that physically disrupts communication, such as standing next to loud speakers at a party, or the noise from a construction site next to a classroom making it difficult to hear the professor.
* '''Physiological-impairment noise.''' Physical maladies that prevent effective communication, such as actual [[deafness]] or [[blindness]] preventing messages from being received as they were intended.
* '''Semantic noise.''' Different interpretations of the meanings of certain words. For example, the word "weed" can be interpreted as an [[Weed|undesirable plant in a yard]], or as a euphemism for [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]].
* '''Syntactical noise.''' Mistakes in grammar can disrupt communication, such as abrupt changes in [[Grammatical tense|verb tense]] during a sentence.
* '''Organizational noise.''' Poorly structured communication can prevent the receiver from accurate interpretation. For example, unclear and badly stated directions can make the receiver even more lost.
* '''Cultural noise.''' Stereotypical assumptions can cause misunderstandings, such as unintentionally offending a non-Christian person by wishing them a "Merry Christmas".
* '''Psychological noise.''' Certain attitudes can also make communication difficult. For instance, great anger or sadness may cause someone to lose focus on the present moment. Disorders such as [[autism]] may also severely hamper effective communication.&lt;ref&gt;Roy M. Berko, et al., Communicating. 11th ed. (Boston, MA: Pearson Education, Inc., 2010) 9–12&lt;/ref&gt;
To face communication noise, redundancy and acknowledgement must often be used. Acknowledgements are messages from the addressee informing the originator that his/her communication has been received and is understood.&lt;ref&gt;North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Nato Standardization Agency AAP-6 – Glossary of terms and definitions, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; Message repetition and feedback about message received are necessary in the presence of noise to reduce the probability of misunderstanding.
The act of disambiguation regards the attempt of reducing noise and wrong interpretations, when the semantic value or meaning of a sign can be subject to noise, or in presence of multiple meanings, which makes the sense-making difficult. Disambiguation attempts to decrease the likelihood of misunderstanding. This is also a fundamental skill in communication processes activated by counselors, psychotherapists, interpreters, and in coaching sessions based on colloquium. In Information Technology, the disambiguation process and the automatic disambiguation of meanings of words and sentences has also been an interest and concern since the earliest days of computer treatment of language.&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Ide, Jean Véronis. ''Word Sense Disambiguation: The State of the Art", Computational Linguistics, 24(1), 1998, pp. 1–40.&lt;/ref&gt;

==As academic discipline==
{{Main|Communication studies}}
The academic discipline that deals with processes of human communication is communication studies. The discipline encompasses a range of topics, from face-to-face conversation to mass media outlets such as television broadcasting. Communication studies also examines how messages are interpreted through the political, cultural, economic, semiotic, hermeneutic, and social dimensions of their contexts. [[Statistics]], as a quantitative approach to communication science, has also been incorporated into research on communication science in order to help substantiate claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Statistical Methods for Communication Science |url=https://books.google.es/books?id=YQ5Yb3z5H1UC&amp;printsec=frontcover |last=Hayes |first=Andrew F. |publisher=[[Taylor &amp; Francis]] |date=31 May 2005 |isbn=9781410613707 |pages=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Deindustrialization''' or '''deindustrialisation''' is a process of [[social]] and [[economic]] change caused by the removal or reduction of [[industrial capacity]] or activity in a country or region, especially [[heavy industry]] or manufacturing industry. It is the opposite of [[industrialisation|industrialization]].

== Interpretations ==
There are different interpretations of what deindustrialization is. Cairncross{{sfn|Cairncross|1982}} and Lever{{sfn|Lever|1991}} offer four possible definitions of deindustrialization:
# A straightforward long-term decline in the output of manufactured goods or in [[employment]] in the [[manufacturing sector]]. 
# A shift from manufacturing to the [[service sector]]s, so that manufacturing has a lower share of total employment. Such a shift may occur even if manufacturing employment is growing in absolute terms
# That manufactured goods comprise a declining share of external [[trade]], so that there is a progressive failure to achieve a sufficient surplus of [[exports]] over [[imports]] to maintain an economy in external balance
# A continuing state of [[balance of trade]] deficit (as described in the third definition above) that accumulates to the extent that a country or region is unable to pay for necessary imports to sustain further production of goods, thus initiating a further downward spiral of economic decline.

==Explanations==
Theories that predict or explain deindustrialization have a long intellectual lineage. [[Robert Rowthorn|Rowthorn]]{{sfn|Rowthorn|1992}} argues that [[Marx]]'s theory of declining (industrial) profit may be regarded as one of the earliest. This theory argues that technological innovation enables more efficient means of production, resulting in increased physical productivity, i.e., a greater output of use value per unit of capital invested. In parallel, however, technological innovations replace people with machinery, and the organic composition of capital increases. Assuming only labor can produce new additional value, this greater physical output embodies a smaller value and surplus value. The average rate of industrial profit therefore declines in the longer term.

Rowthorn and Wells{{sfn|Rowthorn|Wells|1987}} distinguish between deindustrialization explanations that see it as a positive process of, for example, maturity of the economy, and those that associate deindustrialization with negative factors like bad economic performance. They suggest deindustrialization may be both an effect and a cause of poor economic performance.

Pitelis and Antonakis{{sfn|Pitelis|Antonakis|2003}} suggest that, to the extent that manufacturing is characterized by higher productivity, this leads, all other things being equal, to a reduction in relative cost of manufacturing products, thus a reduction in the relative share of manufacturing (provided manufacturing and services are characterized by relatively inelastic demand). Moreover, to the extent that manufacturing firms downsize through, e.g., outsourcing, contracting out, etc., this reduces manufacturing share without negatively influencing the economy. Indeed, it potentially has positive effects, provided such actions increase firm productivity and performance.

[[George Reisman]]{{sfn|Reisman|2002}} identified [[inflation]] as a contributor to deindustrialization. In his analysis, the process of [[fiat money]] inflation distorts the economic calculations necessary to operate [[capital intensity|capital-intensive]] manufacturing enterprises, and makes the investments necessary for sustaining the operations of such enterprises unprofitable.

Institutional arrangements have also contributed to deindustrialization such as [[economic restructuring]]. With breakthroughs in transportation, communication and information technology, a globalized economy that encouraged [[foreign direct investment]], capital mobility and labor migration, and new [[economic theory]]'s emphasis on specialized [[factor endowment]]s, manufacturing moved to lower-cost sites and in its place service sector and financial agglomerations concentrated in urban areas.{{sfn|Bluestone|Harrison|1982}}{{sfn|Logan|Swanstrom|1990}}

The term '''de-industrialization crisis''' has been used to describe the decline of labor-intensive industry in a number of countries and the flight of jobs away from cities. One example is labor-intensive [[manufacturing]]. After free-trade agreements were instituted with less developed nations in the 1980s and 1990s, labor-intensive manufacturers relocated production facilities to [[third world countries]] with much lower wages and lower standards. In addition, technological inventions that required less manual labor, such as [[industrial robot]]s, eliminated many manufacturing jobs.

This article is about the '''demographics of [[Djibouti]]''', including [[population density]], [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]], education level, health, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects of the population.

==Ethnic groups==
{{main article|Djiboutian}}
[[File:Ethno-Demography of Djibouti.png|thumb|left|Main ethnic groups in Djibouti.]]
Djibouti is a [[multiethnic]] country. As of {{UN_Population|Year}}, it has a population of around {{UN_Population|Djibouti}} inhabitants{{UN_Population|ref}}. Djibouti's population grew rapidly during the latter half of the 20th century, increasing from about 62,000 in 1950 to 889,000 by 2010.&lt;ref name="WPP 2010"/&gt;

The two largest ethnic groups are the [[Somalis|Somali]] (60%) and the [[Afar people|Afar]] (35%). The [[Somali clan]] component is mainly composed of the [[Issa (clan)|Issas]], a sub-clan of the larger [[Dir (clan)|Dir]]. The remaining 5% of Djibouti's population primarily consists of [[Arab]]s, [[Ethiopia]]ns and [[Europe]]ans ([[French people|French]] and [[Italian people|Italians]]). Approximately 76% of local residents are [[Urban area|urban]] dwellers; the remainder are [[Pastoralism|pastoralists]].&lt;ref name="CIADJ"/&gt;

==Languages==
{{main article|Languages of Djibouti}}
{{double image|right|A Somali man.jpeg|150|An Afar nomad.jpg|150|A [[Somalis|Somali]] man in a traditional [[Taqiyah (cap)|taqiyah]].|An [[Afar people|Afar]] man in nomadic attire.}}
Djibouti is a [[multilingual]] nation.&lt;ref name="CIADJ"/&gt; The majority of local residents speak [[Somali language|Somali]] (524,000 speakers) and [[Afar language|Afar]] (306,000 speakers) as a first language. These idioms are the [[mother tongue]]s of the Somali and Afar ethnic groups, respectively. Both languages belong to the larger [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]] family. There are three official languages in Djibouti: [[Somali language|Somali]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[French language|French]].&lt;ref name="ethnologue.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Djibouti - Languages|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/country/DJ/languages|publisher=Ethnologue|accessdate=6 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arabic is of religious importance. In formal settings, it consists of [[Modern Standard Arabic]]. Colloquially, about 59,000 local residents speak the [[Ta'izzi-Adeni Arabic]] dialect, also known as ''Djibouti Arabic''. French serves as a statutory national language. It was inherited from the colonial period, and is the primary language of instruction. Around 17,000 Djiboutians speak it as a first language. Immigrant languages include [[Omani Arabic]] (38,900 speakers), [[Amharic language|Amharic]] (1,400 speakers), [[Greek language|Greek]] (1,000 speakers) and [[Hindi language|Hindi]] (600 speakers).&lt;ref name="ethnologue.com"/&gt;

According to {{UN_Population|source}}, the total population was {{UN_Population|Djibouti}} in {{UN_Population|Year}} compared to 62,000 in 1950. The proportion of children below the age of 15 in 2010 was 35.8%, 60.9% was between 15 and 65 years of age, while 3.3% was 65 years or older.&lt;ref name="WPP 2010"&gt;[http://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/index.htm Population Division of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs of the United Nations Secretariat, World Population Prospects: The 2010 Revision]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Afghanistan ethnic groups 2005.jpg|thumb|270px|CIA map showing the territory of the settlement of '''ethnic groups and subgroups in Afghanistan''' (2005)]]
[[Afghanistan]] is a multiethnic and mostly-tribal society. The population of the country is divided into the following [[Ethnolinguistics|ethnolinguistic]] groups: [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]], [[Tajik people|Tajik]], [[Hazara people|Hazara]], [[Uzbek people|Uzbek]], [[Aimaq people|Aymāq]], [[Turkmen people|Turkmen]], [[Baloch people|Baloch]], [[Pashayi people|Pashai]], [[Nuristani people|Nuristani]], [[Gurjar people|Gujjar]], [[History of Arabs in Afghanistan|Arab]], [[Brahui people|Brahui]], [[Pamiri people|Pamiri]] and a few others. The [[Afghan National Anthem]] and the [[Constitution of Afghanistan|Afghan Constitution]] mention a total of 14 ethnic groups.&lt;ref name="AO"&gt;{{cite web |title=Article Four of the Constitution of Afghanistan |url=http://www.afghan-web.com/politics/current_constitution.html#preamble |quote=The nation of Afghanistan is {{sic|comprised|hide=y| of}} the following ethnic groups: Pashtun, Tajik, Hazara, Uzbak, Turkman, Baluch, Pashai, Nuristani, Aymaq, Arab, Qirghiz, Qizilbash, Gujur, Brahwui and others. |accessdate=2017-05-23 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131028065437/http://www.afghan-web.com/politics/current_constitution.html#preamble |archivedate=2013-10-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==National identity==
{{Further information|Afghan|Afghan (ethnonym)|Name of Afghanistan}}
The term "[[Afghan (ethnonym)|Afghan]]" is synonymous with the ethnonym "[[Pashtun people|Pashtun]]" and has been mentioned as early as the 3rd century, referring to the tribes inhabiting the lands south of the [[Hindu Kush]] around the [[Sulaiman Mountains]]. It became prominent during the [[Khalji dynasty|Khalji]], [[Lodi dynasty|Lodi]], and [[Sur Empire|Suri]] dynasties of [[Northern India]]. The name became the national identity of Afghanistan in modern times.&lt;ref name="Kieffer"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/afgan-in-current-political-usage-any-citizen-of-afghanistan-whatever-his-ethnic-tribal-or-religious-affiliation |title=Afghan |first=Ch. M. |last=Kieffer |publisher=[[Encyclopædia Iranica]] |quote=From a more limited, ethnological point of view, “Afḡān” is the term by which the Persian-speakers of Afghanistan (and the non-Paṧtō-speaking ethnic groups generally) designate the Paṧtūn. The equation Afghans = Paṧtūn has been propagated all the more, both in and beyond Afghanistan, because the Paṧtūn tribal confederation is by far the most important in the country, numerically and politically. |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131116233835/http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/afgan-in-current-political-usage-any-citizen-of-afghanistan-whatever-his-ethnic-tribal-or-religious-affiliation |archivedate=2013-11-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being of various ethnic groups, in a research poll that was conducted in 2009, 72% of the population labelled their identity as Afghan first, before ethnicity.&lt;ref name="ABCBBCARD"/&gt;

While national [[culture of Afghanistan]] is not uniform, at the same time, the various ethnic groups have no clear boundaries between each other and there is much overlap.&lt;ref name=LOC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/afghanistan/53.htm|title=Afghanistan - Non-Muslims|author=|date=|website=countrystudies.us|accessdate=27 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161103013037/http://countrystudies.us/afghanistan/53.htm|archivedate=3 November 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, ethnic groups are not racially homogenous. Even though all ethnic groups in Afghanistan share a very similar culture, there are certain traditions and celebrations that each ethnic group has adopted from each other. For example, [[nowruz]] is the Persian New Year, which was originally celebrated by the Persians has now been adopted by some of the other groups. The [[attan]] which was originally a dance performed by Pashtuns, is now the national dance of Afghanistan.

There are conflicting theories about the origin of the Pashtun people, both among historians and the Pashtun themselves. A variety of ancient groups with [[eponym]]s similar to ''Pukhtun'' have been hypothesized as possible ancestors of modern Pashtuns. The Greek historian [[Herodotus]] mentioned a people called ''[[Pakthas#Herodotus records Pactyans|Pactyans]]'', living in the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]]'s [[Arachosia]] [[Satrap]] as early as the [[1st millennium BC]].&lt;ref name="Heredotus"&gt;[http://www.piney.com/Heredotus7.html Chapter 7] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061216012652/http://piney.com/Heredotus7.html |date=2006-12-16 }} of ''The History of Herodotus'' (trans. [[George Rawlinson]]; originally written 440&amp;nbsp;BC) (retrieved 10 January 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 3rd century AD and onward they are mostly referred to by the [[ethnonym]] ''"[[Afghan (ethnonym)|Afghan]]"'', a name believed to be given to them by neighboring Persian people.&lt;ref name="Habibi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alamahabibi.com/English%20Articles/Afghan_and_Afghanistan.htm|title=Afghan and Afghanistan|work=[[Abdul Hai Habibi]]|publisher=alamahabibi.com|year=1969|accessdate=2010-10-24|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707103517/http://www.alamahabibi.com/English%20Articles/Afghan_and_Afghanistan.htm|archivedate=2011-07-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some believe that ethnic ''Afghan'' is an adaptation of the Prakrit ethnonym ''[[Avagana]]'', attested in the 6th century CE.&lt;ref name="Kieffer"/&gt; It was used to refer to a common legendary ancestor known as ''"[[Afghana]]"'', propagated to be grandson of [[Saul|King Saul of Israel]].&lt;ref name=Brit-Pashtun&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/445546/Pashtun |title=Pashtun |publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |accessdate=2011-03-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131030170021/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/445546/Pashtun |archivedate=2013-10-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to scholars such as [[Vladimir Fedorovich Minorsky|V. Minorsky]] and others, the name ''Afghan'' appears in the 982 CE [[Hudud ul-'alam|Hudud-al-Alam]] geography book. [[Abu Rayhan Biruni|Al-Biruni]] referred to a group of Afghans in the 11th century as various tribes living on the western frontier mountains of [[History of India|Ancient India]] and Persia, which would be the area between the Hindu Kush mountains in Afghanistan and the Indus River in what is now Pakistan. According to other sources, some Pashtuns may be the [[Lost tribes of Israel]] who converted to Islam during the [[Muslim conquests|Arab Empire]]. Since the 13th century, some Pashtun tribes conquered areas outside their traditional Pashtun homeland by pushing deeper into [[South Asia]], often forming kingdoms such as the [[Delhi Sultanate]].&lt;ref name=Brit-Pashtun/&gt;

The modern Afghan national identity developed in the mid 18th century under the rule of Ahmad Shah Durrani, who united all the tribes and formed the [[Durrani Empire|last Afghan empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/af.html |title=Afghanistan |publisher=[[CIA World Factbook]] |accessdate=2011-03-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170920072213/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/af.html |archivedate=2017-09-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pashtuns are the traditional rulers of Afghanistan since the rise of the [[Hotaki dynasty]] in 1709 or more specifically when the [[Durrani Empire]] was created in 1747. They practice [[Sunni Islam]] and follow the [[Hanafi]] [[Islamic schools and branches|school of thought]]. The [[Cabinet of Afghanistan|Karzai administration]], which is led by [[Hamid Karzai]], is dominated by Pashtun ministers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scis.org/SA_L2_A4_teacher_resource_2_10_p115.pdf |title=Afghan Government 2009 |work=Central Intelligence Agency |date=September 28, 2009 |publisher=[[Southern Center for International Studies]] |accessdate=2011-03-21 }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Afghan presidential election, 2014|2014, Afghan presidential election]], all of the eleven candidates were Pashtuns.

Some notable Pashtuns of Afghanistan include: [[Hamid Karzai]], [[Ashraf Ghani]], [[Nazo Tokhi]], [[Wazir Akbar Khan|Akbar Khan]], [[Malalai of Maiwand]], [[Abdul Ahad Momand]], [[Zalmay Khalilzad]], the [[Afghan Girl]], [[Hedayat Amin Arsala]], [[Abdul Rahim Wardak]], [[Sher Mohammad Karimi]], [[Abdul Salam Azimi]], [[Zalmai Rassoul]], [[Omar Zakhilwal]], [[Ghulam Farooq Wardak]], [[Anwar ul-Haq Ahady]], [[Daud Shah Saba]], [[Mohammad Gulab Mangal]], [[Gul Agha Sherzai]], [[Asadullah Khalid]], [[Mohammad Hanif Atmar]], [[Mohammad Ishaq Aloko]], [[Mohammed Omar]], [[Gulbuddin Hekmatyar]], [[Ahmad Zahir]], [[Nashenas]], [[Ubaidullah Jan]], [[Naghma]], [[Farhad Darya|Farhad Darya Nasher]],  [[Suhaila Seddiqi]], [[Shukria Barakzai]], [[Fauzia Gailani]], the [[Hotaki dynasty|Hotakis]], [[Durrani Empire|Durranis]], [[Tarzi]]s, Gailanis, [[Nasher clan|Nashers]], and [[Karzai (surname)|Karzai]]s.

They were only able to rule and at the same time legitimize their rule as second- or even as immediate sub-rulers with some significant influence on the foreigners – with the exception of the short 10-month rule of [[Habibullah Kalakani]] in 1929.&lt;ref name=Newell&gt;Richard S.

Publisher: University of California Press&lt;/ref&gt; The total number of Tajiks in Afghanistan was around 4.3 million in 1995,&lt;ref name="LoC"/&gt; and the [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] explains that by the early 21st century they constituted about [[Descriptive statistics|one-fifth]] of the population.&lt;ref name="Perry"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Brit-Tajik&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/581024/Tajik |title=Tajik |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |quote=There were about 5,000,000 in Afghanistan, where they constituted about one-fifth of the population. |accessdate=November 6, 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111125205057/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/581024/Tajik |archivedate=November 25, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others live in rural areas, particularly in [[Badakhshan Province|Badakhshan]], and engage in agriculture. The ethnic Tajiks are the closest rivals to Pashtuns for political power and prestige in Afghanistan. At the same time, they often engage in business partnerships and marriage contracts with each other. The [[Northern Alliance]] which opposed the Taliban government was dominated by Tajiks. Some notable Tajiks from Afghanistan include: [[Habibullah Kalakani]], [[Burhanuddin Rabbani]], [[Ahmad Shah Massoud]], [[Ahmad Zia Massoud]], [[Mohammed Fahim]], [[Yunus Qanuni]], [[Ismail Khan]], [[Bismillah Khan Mohammadi]], [[Atta Muhammad Nur]], [[Amrullah Saleh]], [[Wasef Bakhtari]], [[Abdul Latif Pedram]], [[Massouda Jalal]], [[Baz Mohammad Ahmadi]], [[Mohammed Daud Daud]], [[Abdul Basir Salangi]], and [[Fawzia Koofi]].

The Hazaras seem to have partial [[Turco-Mongol]] origins with admixture from surrounding indigenous, [[Iranian peoples|Iranian-speaking]] groups. Linguistically the Hazara speak a dialect of Persian, known as [[Hazaragi]], and sometimes their variant is interspersed with [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] and [[Mongolic languages|Mongolic]] words. It is commonly believed that the Hazara are descendants of [[Genghis Khan]]'s army, which invaded Afghanistan during the 12th century. Proponents of this view hold that many of the Mongol soldiers and their family members settled in the area and remained there after the [[Mongol empire]] dissolved in the 13th century, converting to Islam and adopting local customs. Most of the Hazaras practice [[Shia Islam]], while most of the other Afghans are [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]]. Hazaras living in Afghanistan were estimated in 1995 at about one million&lt;ref name="LoC"/&gt; and now they are between 6 &lt;ref name=Brit-Hazara&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/257908/Hazara |title=Hazara |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=November 6, 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111117204819/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/257908/Hazara |archivedate=November 17, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; to 7 million.

[[File:Rashid Dostom.jpg|thumb|250px|left|[[Abdul Rashid Dostum]] politician and the leader of Uzbeks in Afghanistan]]
[[File:Uzbek people from Afghanistan.jpg|thumb|[[Uzbeks]] of Afghanistan]]
The [[Uzbek people|Uzbeks]] are the main Turkic people of Afghanistan whose native territory is in the northern regions of the country. Most likely the Uzbeks migrated with a wave of Turkic invaders and intermingled with local Iranian tribes over time to become the ethnic group they are today. By the 16th century the Uzbeks had settled throughout Central Asia and reached Afghanistan following the conquests of [[Muhammad Shaybani]]. The Uzbeks of Afghanistan are Sunni Muslims and fluent in [[Uzbek language|Uzbek]].&lt;ref name="Dupree"&gt;{{cite web |work=[[Louis Dupree (professor)|L.

Some notable Uzbeks of Afghanistan include: [[Abdul Rashid Dostum]], [[Husn Banu Ghazanfar]], [[Abdul Rauf Ibrahimi]], [[Muhammad Yunus Nawandish]], [[Sherkhan Farnood]], [[Abdul Malik Pahlawan]] and [[Rasul Pahlawan]].

===Aimaq===
{{Further information|Aymāq}}
''Aimaq'', meaning "tribe" in [[Turkic languages|Turkic]]-[[Mongolic languages|Mongolic]] (''Oymaq''), is not an ethnic denomination, but differentiates semi-nomadic herders and agricultural tribal groups of various ethnic origins including the Tajik, Hazara and Baluch, that were formed in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. They live among non-tribal people in the western areas of Badghis, Ghor and Herat provinces. They are Sunni Muslims, speak [[Aimaq dialect]] of the [[Persian language|Persian]] close to [[Dari language|Dari]], and refer to themselves with tribal designations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+af0042)|title=Library of Congress, Aimaq|author=|date=|website=loc.gov|accessdate=27 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170811104522/http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd%2Fcstdy%3A%40field%28DOCID+af0042%29|archivedate=11 August 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Population estimates vary widely, from less than 500,000 to around 800,000.

===Turkmen===
{{Further information|Turkmen people}}
The [[Turkmen people|Turkmen]] are the smaller Turkic group. They are Sunni Muslims, and their origins are very similar to that of the Uzbeks. Unlike the Uzbeks, however, the Turkmen are traditionally a nomadic people (though they were forced to abandon this way of life in Turkmenistan itself under Soviet rule).&lt;ref name="Dupree"/&gt; In the 1990s their number was put at around 200,000.&lt;ref name="LoC"/&gt;

===Baloch===
{{Further information|Baloch people|Brahui people}}
[[File:Men in Zaranj-cropped.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Baloch people|Baloch]] of [[Nimruz Province]], Afghanistan]]
The [[Baloch people]] are speakers of [[Baloch language|Balochi]] who are mostly found in and around the [[Balochistan, Afghanistan|Balochistan]] region of Afghanistan. In the 1990s their number figure was put at 100,000 but they are around 200,000 today.&lt;ref name="LoC"/&gt; They are most likely an offshoot of the [[Kurds]] and reached Afghanistan sometimes between 1000 and 1300 BCE.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} Mainly pastoral and desert dwellers, the Baloch are also Sunni Muslim. [[Abdul Karim Brahui]] [[List of governors of Nimruz|Governor of Nimruz Province]], is Baloch.

===Nuristani===

{{Further information|Nuristani people}}
[[File:Young Pashai man with flowers in his hair.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Pashai people|Pashai]] boy]]
The Nuristani are an [[Indo-Iranians|Indo-Iranian]] people, representing a third independent branch of the Aryan peoples (Indo-Aryan, Iranian and Nuristani), who live in isolated regions of northeastern Afghanistan as well as across the border in the district of [[Chitral]] in Pakistan. They speak a variety of [[Nuristani languages]]. Better known historically as the Kafirs of what was once known as Kafiristan (land of pagans), they converted to [[Islam]] during the rule of [[Amir Abdur Rahman]] and their country was renamed "[[Nuristan]]", meaning "Land of Light" (as in the light of Islam).{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} A small unconquered portion of [[Kafiristan]] inhabited by the [[Kalash people]] who still practice their pre-Islamic religion still exists across the border in highlands of [[Chitral]], northwestern [[Pakistan]]. Many Nuristanis believe that they are the descendants of [[Alexander the Great]]'s ancient [[Greeks]], but there is a lack of genetic evidence for this and they are more than likely an isolated pocket of early Aryan invaders.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} Physically, the Nuristani are of the Mediterranean sub-stock with about one-third [[recessive]] [[blond]]ism.&lt;ref name="Dupree"/&gt; They follow Sunni Islam like most of the other Afghans. The population in the 1990s was estimated at 125,000 by some; the Nuristani prefer a figure of 300,000.&lt;ref name="LoC"/&gt;

===Smaller groups===
Smaller groups include the [[Moghol people|Moghol]], [[Pashai people|Pashai]], [[Pamiri people|Pamiri]], [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]], [[History of Arabs in Afghanistan|Arab]]s, [[Punjabis in Afghanistan|Punjabis]] and [[Gujjar]].

The '''Silvermaster File'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://ultra-secret.info/CSR/Holdings/Silvermaster/Silvermaster.htm FBI Silvermaster file 65-56402] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120802154514/http://ultra-secret.info/CSR/Holdings/Silvermaster/Silvermaster.htm |date=2012-08-02 }} [https://web.archive.org/web/20110726014919/http://www.education-research.org/CSR/Holdings/Silvermaster/Silvermaster.htm archived link]&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[United States]]' [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] is a 162-volume compendium of some 26,000 pages of documents relating to the Bureau's investigation of [[Communism|Communist]] penetration of the [[U.S. federal government]] during the [[Cold War]].

Beginning in 1945 with the allegations of defecting Soviet courier [[Elizabeth Bentley]] ([[Venona]] cover names “Myrna”;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nsa.gov/venona/releases/23_Sep_1944_R3_m4_p2.gif 1353 KGB New York to Moscow, 23 Sept. 1944, p. 2]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Umnitsa'', “Clever Girl”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nsa.gov/venona/releases/13_May_1944_R3_p1.gif 687 KGB New York to Moscow, 13 May 1944, p.1]&lt;/ref&gt;), the file is also known as the Bentley file or Gregory file ("Gregory" was the FBI code name for Bentley).

The file takes its name from [[Nathan Gregory Silvermaster]] (Venona cover names Pel,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nsa.gov/venona/releases/29-30_Jun_1943_p2.gif 1017 KGB New York to Moscow, 29-30 June 1943, p. 2]&lt;/ref&gt; Pal, "Paul";&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nsa.gov/venona/releases/09_Jun_1943_m3_p2.gif 888 KGB New York to Moscow, 9th June 1943, p. 2]&lt;/ref&gt; "Robert"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nsa.gov/venona/releases/19_Dec_1944_R3_m1_p1.gif 1787 KGB New York to Moscow, 19 December 1944, p.1]&lt;/ref&gt;) of the [[War Production Board]], whom Bentley named as head of an underground Communist network known as the Silvermaster Group.&lt;ref&gt;FBI Report, [http://ultra-secret.info/PDFs/NKVD.pdf ''Underground Soviet Espionage Organization (NKVD) in Agencies of the United States Government'']{{dead link|date=June 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}, October 21, 1946 ([http://ultra-secret.info/PDFs/Silvermaster082.pdf FBI Silvermaster file, Volume 82)] {{webarchive|url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20080227074841/http://ultra-secret.info/PDFs/Silvermaster082.pdf |date=2008-02-27 }}, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Among the people named in the file in connection with this group are President Franklin Roosevelt's Administrative Assistant [[Lauchlin Currie]]&lt;ref&gt;FBI Report, [http://ultra-secret.info/PDFs/NKVD.pdf ''Underground Soviet Espionage Organization (NKVD) in Agencies of the United States Government'']{{dead link|date=June 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}, October 21, 1946 ([http://ultra-secret.info/PDFs/Silvermaster082.pdf FBI Silvermaster file, Volume 82)] {{webarchive|url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20080227074841/http://ultra-secret.info/PDFs/Silvermaster082.pdf |date=2008-02-27 }}, 52&lt;/ref&gt; (Venona cover name "Page")&lt;ref name="Hanyok00043"&gt;Robert J.

(Like several others identified by Bentley, Hiss had been identified independently by another defecting Soviet courier, [[Whittaker Chambers]], to Assistant Secretary of State Adolf Berle in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.johnearlhaynes.org/page100.html Berle’s notes on his meeting with Whittaker Chambers, September 2, 1939]&lt;/ref&gt;) Among dozens of others named by Bentley in this file in connection with this network is [[Duncan Lee]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://ultra-secret.info/PDFs/NKVD.pdf FBI Report]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; (Venona cover name “Koch”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nsa.gov/venona/releases/08_Jun_1943_m7_p1.gif 800 KGB New York to Moscow, June 8, 1943, p. 1]&lt;/ref&gt;), confidential assistant to [[William J. Donovan|William Donovan]], founder and director of the [[Office of Strategic Services]] (OSS), wartime predecessor of the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]].

==Prosecutions==
Original plans for Bentley to serve as a double agent and gather sufficient evidence to prosecute the Soviet agents identified in the Silvermaster files were ruined when her identity was inadvertently leaked and the USSR quickly shut down its operations in order to avoid embarrassing and damaging prosecutions. The Silvermaster file in combination with other secret proofs such as the Venona intercepts gave US intelligence the identity of many Soviet agents without the practical means to secure convictions. Also, the statute of limitations for an espionage prosecution was quite short.  This was a significant part of the backstory of [[McCarthyism]]. Bentley's double agent career would have enabled the US to expose the spies without compromising Venona and losing that as an ongoing intelligence source.&lt;ref&gt;In a hand written note in the margin Hoover writes, "in view of all the 'gabbing' done by the Dept to the Press there is little which can be expected from &lt;u&gt;any&lt;/u&gt; action now."

Since the beginning of the 20th century, groups of people (usually circles of young friends) moved to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]/Israel together. The term "gar'in" originally referred to these groups who came from all across the world. [[aliyah|Immigrating]] in a group provided the support necessary for survival. Many of these groups founded their own [[kibbutz]]im. The phenomemon of these groups has been ongoing since before Israel [[Declaration of Independence (Israel)|was established]] in 1948.

A variation of the original Gar'in groups still exist today. Whilst it is rare for gar'in to move to Israel together and form a community, the groups provide support for people interested in moving to Israel. They also provide forums for social-networking, information gathering, and encouragement.

The pre-military program [[Garin Tzabar]] facilitates and encourages the immigration of young Jews to Israel and supports them throughout their military service by placing them on Kibbutzim around the country.

The '''history of organizations''' describes the general history of the rise of the [[organization]].

==Early history==

Since earliest times humanity has endeavoured to develop the most appropriate systems of organization to meet the challenges of a particular era. Inevitably the systems of organization that developed were reflections of the wider values, tradition and general organization of society at that time, moulded by the necessity of withstanding threat and seeking to innovate whilst maximising benefits from existing resources. Human development has continually necessitated a corollary of human and organizational development designed to maximize effectiveness. This progression is indicative of a civilizing process that has continually asked humanity to reassess its relationship with itself and to increasingly value the welfare of both the individual and wider society as a whole.&lt;ref name=Pinker2011&gt;Pinker, S. 2011.  The Better Angels of Our Nature: A History of Violence and Humanity. London. Penguin.&lt;/ref&gt; The symbiotic relationship between strategic leadership and organizational structure necessary to success can be traced back to the beginnings of western civilization. Indeed, the very term ''strategic'' owes its etymology to the ancient Greek words for 'army' or a 'large body' and a 'leader'. In ancient Greece the '[[Strategikos]]' was the leader of the army.&lt;ref name=Adair2002&gt;Adair, J., 2002. Inspiring Leadership. London. Thorogood.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Industrial Revolutions==
{{main|Industrial Revolution}}
In 1776 the political economist [[Adam Smith]] wrote on how specialization can boost human productivity enormously.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, A. (1776). An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations.&lt;/ref&gt; By specializing, people can use their talents, or acquire skill. And they can employ labour-saving machinery to boost production.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.adamsmith.org/wealth-of-nations. (n.d.). Retrieved October 2013, 2013, from www.adamsmith.org.&lt;/ref&gt; Smith's view was borne out by the effects of mass industrialization in the late 18th century which caused great change in how people worked and how work was organized. On this topic [[Lynda Gratton]], the [[organizational theory|organizational theorist]], describes the "fundamental and irreversible shift which changed the experiences of every worker." She states that prior to the Industrial Revolution, work was an "artisan activity engaged largely in the home, using long held and meticulously developed craft skills." According to Gratton these skills "began to be transformed as the manufacturing sector was developed and began to transcend the limits of artisanal production".&lt;ref name=Gratton2011&gt;Gratton, L. (2011). The Shift-The future of work is already here. London: Collins&lt;/ref&gt;

The late 18th and early 19th century was a period where the artisan and the agricultural worker gave way to the burgeoning factory units that were beginning to emerge. The enclosure of vast tracts of commonage in the countryside facilitated a move from pastoral farming to grazing – forcing many from the land, often in dire circumstances. This growing trend of migration from the rural to the urban witnessed the growth of the metropolis, and the industrialized city. The growth of a mass society meant that the relationship with work was altered, it now became much more time centred and precise – a standardized approach was in the process of being developed.&lt;ref name=RB2001&gt;Russell, B., 2001. ''Freedom and Organisation 1814&amp;ndash;1914''. 2nd ed. London. Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Eric2003&gt;Hobsbawn, Eric. 2003a. ''The Age of Revolution 1789–1848''. London, Abacus.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alongside the migration of workers to the new factories largely situated around energy sources and communication networks – [[coal]] deposits and canals etc.&lt;ref name=RB2001 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Eric2003 /&gt; this period witnessed the emergence of global corporations situated in key centres such as London and Paris, as trade followed the flag in a wave of [[colonization]]. The shift from coal to oil as the primary energy source for industry coupled with the decolonization of empires in the 20th century would witness shifting paradigms in the power relationships between major states. The issue of empire is important in the sense that economic advantages accrued through imperialism were a cornerstone in the advent of modernity, and the enforced homogeneity achieved through Empire coupled with the technological improvements in transport and technology that it funded made the world a lot smaller and lot more similar.&lt;ref&gt;Hobsbawn, Eric. 2003b. The Age of Empire 1875 – 1914. London, Abacus.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James, Lawrence. 2004. The Rise and Fall of the British Empire. 3rd ed. London, Abacus.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson, Niall. 2004. Empire How Britain Made the Modern World. London, Penguin.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst recognising the significant impacts that the Industrial Revolution had, Gratton states that the "real revolution" in people's working lives began in the mid-to-late-19th century when British scientists drove a culture of innovation with the ideas of organisational and technological restructuring based on changes in the energy that powered industry. Joel Mokyr &lt;ref&gt;Mokyr, J. (1998, August ). http://faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu/~jmokyr/castronovo.pdf.  Retrieved October 20th, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; puts a timeframe of 1870-1914 on this "Second Industrial Revolution", the concept introduced by Patrick Geddes in his work Cities in Evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Geddes, P. (1949). Cities in Evolution. Williams &amp; Norgate.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Gratton: "Work became more regimented, more specialised. The workplace and the work schedule became more compartmentalised and hierarchical." Gratton states that this was 'the embryonic stages of Fordism – the rise of the engineer as the organiser of economic activity, and the decline of the artisan.&lt;ref name=Gratton2011 /&gt;

==Fordism==

[[Fordism]], named after Henry Ford, is "a model of economic expansion and technological progress based on mass production: the manufacture of standardized products in huge volumes using special purpose machinery and unskilled labor".&lt;ref&gt;Tolliday, S. &amp;. (1987). The Automobile Industry and its Workers: Between Fordism and Flexibility. New York: St.Martin's Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The major advantages of this approach was that it cut down on the manpower necessary for the factory to operate, not to mention that it deskilled the labour itself, cutting down on costs of production.&lt;ref&gt;Burrows, R., Gilbert, N., &amp; Pollert, A. (1992). Fordism and Flexibility: Divisions and Change. New York: St. Martin's Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Gratton, "in this second Industrial Revolution, engineers redesigned factories to make employees fit into the production line. By doing so workers lost their autonomy, becoming simply as interchangeable as the parts they created".&lt;ref name=Gratton2011 /&gt;

Whilst Fordism emerged in the United States, it was preceded in Europe by Taylorism.&lt;ref&gt;Maier, C. S. (1970). Between Taylorism and Technocracy: European Ideologies and the Vision of Industrial Productivity in the 1920s. Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;  Taylor's main objective was to improve economic efficiency, especially labor productivity. He analyzed how specific jobs might be done more efficiently. He broke down manual tasks into a series of components that could be measured. Peter Drucker who, during the 20th century was known as the 'father of modern management' said that Taylor was "the first man in history who did not take work for granted, but looked at it and studied it. His approach to work is still the basic foundation."&lt;ref&gt;Gurus – Frederick Winslow Taylor. (2009, February 6th). The Economist.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-Fordism==

Production methods based on Fordism are no longer the primary method of industrial production. There are three main driving forces behind the emergence of '[[Post-Fordism]].' They are the rising of new technologies, internationalization and the paradigm shift from Fordism to post-Fordism. Post Fordism is based on flexible production, rising incomes for polyvalent skilled workers and the service class and increased profits based on technological and other innovations. Also post-Fordism accumulation will be more oriented to worldwide demand, not so much on demand within a state. Post-Fordism is more demand than supply-driven. As a labour process, post-Fordism can be defined as a flexible production process based on flexible systems and an appropriately flexible workforce.&lt;ref&gt;Jessop, B. (n.d.). http://www.cddc.vt.edu/digitalfordism/fordism_materials/jessop3.htm.  Retrieved October 19th, 2013, from Center for Digital Discourse and Culture, Virginia Tech.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modernity==

The birth of modernity as it has been termed in the late 19th early 20th century presaged a period of incredible industrial, technical and intellectual advancement that was to completely alter mankind's relationship with and perception of time and space. Many of the technologies that we take for granted today can be seen as developments from scientific and technical breakthroughs achieved in the period between 1890 and 1920. The birth of the railroad (which dates back to the early 19th century), and later the automobile, was to lead to seismic changes in the manner and means in which the organization of the various units of human enterprise were to be restructured, from warfare to commerce. Mankind's new outer relationship with time would be best captured by the birth of the railroad &lt;ref&gt;Rodrigues C., Garrat, C., 2001. Introducing Modernism. London. Icon.&lt;/ref&gt; and our inner relationship with time through the development of modernist literature, with its stream of consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;Walder, Denis. 2004. Literature in the Modern World: Critical Essays and Documents. 2nd ed. Oxford. OUP.&lt;/ref&gt; The parallel growth of industrial capitalism would lead to the identification of time as money. The speed of travel would see the subsuming of local time-zones into railway times. The [[American Civil War]] is regarded as the first modern conflict, as notwithstanding the massive casualties and periods of trench warfare, the mass movement of men and munitions by rail provided the genesis for the logistical capability that would contribute to the mechanization of warfare inevitability leading to the slaughter of World War I.

==World War II==

[[World War II]] represents something of a tipping point in terms of its impact on the development of industrial organization and leadership. Just as the conflict precipitated incredible technological advancements in areas such as radar, computing and the development of the jet engine so it was for leadership models, particularly in the areas of communications and efficiency. The primary models and experience of leadership and organizational structure for the post war leaders of the business world were from the military in WWII, with the majority of Post War managers drawing on their military training as a model for organizational development.&lt;ref name=Adair2002 /&gt;

==Post war management &amp; organizational development==

[[Frederick Winslow Taylor]]'s 1911 ''The Principles of Scientific Management'' paved the way for the recognition of management as a scientific subject, with the MIT [[Sloan School of Management]] opening in 1914. However, organizational theorists such as [[Charles Handy]] and [[Henry Mintzberg]] both decry the lack of leadership and management training in the post WWII period. Handy in particular records how in his early career as an executive he was forced to rely on his formal academic training in Roman and Greek Classics as grounding for his management training.&lt;ref&gt;Handy, C., 2007. MYSELF and other more important matters. London. Arrow.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mintzberg, H., https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NRWtd_SiU8. Retrieved 26 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt; It would not be until some-time after WWII that the education of executives would be addressed in a critical manner. This would in time give birth to the management guru, with major implications for the science and theory of management and organizational development.&lt;ref name=Adair2002 /&gt;

==Social, technical, environmental &amp; political forces as modern shapers==

The growth of 'gentle commerce' interspersed with political and social thought processes to the degree that by the late 20th century, in a globalized interdependent economy, cooperation between nation states and trading blocs is the norm (notwithstanding the obvious aberrations of the rule); thankfully humanity has advanced beyond Clausewitz' dictum that decreed war as no more than politics in another manifestation &lt;ref&gt;Clausewitz, C., 1993. On War. London. Everyman.&lt;/ref&gt; to the degree that it is no longer acceptable for Democracies to use force to achieve political aims.&lt;ref name=Pinker2011 /&gt;

Against this developing socio-political backdrop, organizations have continued to evolve. The contemporary zeitgeist suggests the developed world is primarily governed by social democracies, is hugely interdependent whilst engulfed in a tidal wave of endemic technological innovation and advances that will carry it into uncharted waters. All this alongside a growing sense of awareness of a global environmental threat, diminishing supplies of carbon fuels coupled in all too many instances with an existential crisis, that asks what is it all about?

==Contemporary organisational innovation==

A prime example of progression from the antiquated hierarchical structures with its layers of middle management staffed by gate keepers congesting the flow of communications can be found in the 2008 Presidential Campaign conducted by [[Barack Obama]]. Obama's team harnessed the potential of social media to create a flat structure. Local activists were communicated with directly from campaign headquarters. Individuals became leaders in their own domain. They were able to access campaign material, and register supporters immediately upon accessing material provided online via the campaign website.

This innovative form of campaign allowed Obama to raise $750 million, primarily from small donors, along with registering one and half million volunteer campaign workers in twenty seven thousand campaign groups. However, following the appointment of [[Jim Messina (political staffer)|Jim Messina]] as the campaign manager for the 2012 Presidential campaign the 2008 strategy was declared antiquated – indeed [[Steven Spielberg]] reportedly advised Messina to blow up the 2008 campaign it was so out of date.

In a future where any task that can be described as predictable or repetitive will invariably be delegated to forms of artificial intelligence, the old hierarchical command and control systems will become largely redundant. Success will be premised on speed and innovation, on the ability of organizations to synthesize real time information and perform strategic pivots that will allow immediate access to new opportunities. The 2012 Presidential election presaged how this may look in practice. Whilst the campaign remained grassroots oriented, continuing to harness social media, the engine behind the effort was a metrics driven campaign. The sheer magnitude of the data organizing effort was staggering, but all within one single comprehensive database.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-06-14/obamas-ceo-jim-messina-has-a-president-to-sell. Retrieved 26 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Obama&gt;http://www.fastcompany.com/3002973/5-ways-obama-campaign-was-run-lean-startup. Retrieved 26 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In what was the largest political campaign in US political history, the technical staff utilized consumer data along with demographic information to devise a more accurate model of the electorate – in small slices. By taking cognizance of the 'Long Tail' of human preferences,&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, C., 2009b. ''The Longer Tail''. 2nd ed. London. Random House.&lt;/ref&gt; analysts were able to develop micro campaigns that targeted key demographic groupings that many had predicted would not vote due to the impact of the economic downturn and high unemployment that underscored the administration's failure to deliver a quality of prose in government that had been promised by the poetry of the campaign. By identifying who the voter actually was through data mining and attaching a support score of 1–100 for each individual voter, the campaign team were able to build a macro picture of the election by breaking it down in its component parts.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.technologyreview.com/featuredstory/509026/how-obamas-team-used-big-data-to-rally-voters/ Retrieved 27 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The campaign itself became an evolutionary process designed to react to 'just in time information' that allowed the campaign to pivot in a new strategic direction to meet identified demand.&lt;ref name=Obama /&gt; This development from rigid hierarchical structures to an infrastructure deliberately designed to support innovative, but empirical evidenced decision making, represents the future of organizational development. Steve Jobs spoke of the need for future organizations to be run by ideas not hierarchies.&lt;ref&gt;Jobs, Steve. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jZi2waofq8. Retrieved 27 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The Government of [[Kenya]] does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of [[human trafficking]]. In 2008 it was reported that Kenya's anti-trafficking efforts improved markedly over the reporting period, particularly through greater investigations of suspected trafficking cases.&lt;ref name=dos&gt;"Kenya". [https://www.state.gov/g/tip/rls/tiprpt/2008/105388.htm ''Trafficking in Persons Report 2008'']. [[U.S. Department of State]] (4 June 2008). ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].''&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. State Department's [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]] placed the country in [[Trafficking in Persons Report#Ranking System|"Tier 2"]]  in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/2017/271117.htm|title=Trafficking in Persons Report 2017: Tier Placements|website=www.state.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their efforts remain uncoordinated and lack strong oversight, creating an environment conducive to trafficking.

==Prosecution==
The government failed to punish acts of trafficking during the reporting period, but demonstrated significantly increased law enforcement activity throughout the reporting period. Kenya does not prohibit all forms of trafficking, though it criminalises the [[trafficking of children]] and adults for [[sexual slavery|sexual exploitation]] through its Sexual Offenses Act, enacted in July 2006, which prescribes penalties that are sufficiently stringent and commensurate with those for rape; however, the law is not yet widely used by prosecutors. The Employment Act of 2007 outlaws forced labour and contains additional statutes relevant to labour trafficking. In September 2007, relevant government agencies provided comments on a draft comprehensive human trafficking bill to the [[Attorney General]]’s office, which continues to work with NGOs to further refine the bill. Police opened investigations into a number of significant cases during the reporting period, including the suspected trafficking of children by two school teachers in [[Kirinyaga District]]. In October 2007, police in [[Malindi]] arrested an [[Italia]]n national on suspicion of human trafficking, facilitating [[child prostitution]], and drug trafficking. Upon the conclusion of a separate police investigation, two women were charged with child [[:wikt:defilement|defilement]] and child prostitution after luring a 14-year-old girl to their home and forcing her into prostitution. Two children trafficked to [[Tanzania]] for forced labour were rescued by Kenyan officials and placed in a children's home; the investigation is ongoing as police believe the perpetrators are harbouring an additional 40 children and six adults in forced labour. Six people in [[Bomet District]] and [[Nandi District]] of [[Rift Valley Province]] were charged with the sale and trafficking of children. The [[Police Commissioner]] worked with [[Interpol (organization)|Interpol]] to investigate the suspected trafficking of a Kenyan girl to the [[Netherlands]] and four children to Ireland. The [[Ministry of Home Affairs (Kenya)|Ministry of Home Affairs]] began, for the first time, collecting information on trafficking cases from the police, media, foreign governments, and [[UNODC]]. Corruption among law enforcement authorities and other public officials hampered efforts to bring traffickers to justice. Some anti-trafficking activists made credible claims that, in certain areas, police officials were complicit in trafficking activities.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

In 2010 Kenya passed the Counter-trafficking in persons act which criminalizes human trafficking.&lt;ref&gt;http://kenyalaw.org/kl/fileadmin/pdfdownloads/Acts/Counter-TraffickinginPersonsAct_No8of2010.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; However, the act has been poorly implemented and has had little impact on curbing human trafficking.&lt;ref&gt;Regional Mixed Migration Secretariat {{cite web |url=http://www.regionalmms.org/fileadmin/content/rmms_publications/series_booklettwo.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-09-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140924040742/http://www.regionalmms.org/fileadmin/content/rmms_publications/series_booklettwo.pdf |archivedate=24 September 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protection==
The government made efforts during the reporting period to improve protective services provided to trafficking victims. Kenyan officials removed 14 children from situations of trafficking in [[Nandi District|Nandi]] and placed them in a [[children's home]]. The government referred two additional trafficking victims to [[International Organization for Migration|IOM]] for assistance during the reporting period, and ensured the well-being of a number of other victims. City Council Social Services Departments in [[Nairobi]], [[Mombasa]], and [[Kisumu]] operated shelters to rehabilitate street children vulnerable to forced labour and commercial sexual exploitation; the government provided services to children exploited in the commercial sex industry at these facilities. In partnership with an NGO, the Ministry of Home Affairs provided and refurbished a building to house a toll-free hotline that enables children and adults to report cases of child trafficking, labour, and abuse. Staff members were hired and trained to serve as counselors and refer callers to government and NGO service providers. In June 2007, the Department of Home Affairs’ Children's Services Unit hired an additional 180 Chief Children's Officers; during the reporting period, several children's officers posted throughout the country were involved in trafficking investigations and provided counselling and follow-up to child trafficking victims. Fifteen newly appointed Kenyan ambassadors received a first-ever briefing on human trafficking at Kenya's [[Foreign Service Institute]]; preparations are underway for a comprehensive briefing from the Ministries of Labor and Home Affairs and IOM for mid-grade and junior officers on their responsibilities in assisting Kenyan victims abroad. The government encourages victims’ assistance in the investigation and prosecution of trafficking crimes, and ensures that they are not inappropriately incarcerated or otherwise penalised for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of being trafficked. The government does not, however, provide legal alternatives to the removal of victims to countries where they would face hardship or retribution.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

==Prevention==
The Government of Kenya made significant progress in publicly highlighting the dangers of human trafficking and taking steps to combat it during the reporting period. On numerous occasions, senior government officials, including the [[Vice President of Kenya|Vice-President]], spoke publicly about trafficking and attended many awareness-raising events, including the [[Day of the African Child]] in June. The Kenyan media, especially the government-owned [[Kenya Broadcasting Corporation]], regularly reported cases of suspected human trafficking. In July 2007, the government established the National Steering Committee to Combat Human Trafficking under the leadership of the Ministry of Home Affairs. Its Sub-Committee appointed to draft a national action plan received two days of training from IOM, after which it convened three drafting sessions and presented an initial outline of the plan in October. Officers from the Ministries of Youth and Labor received anti-trafficking training at IOM workshops in November and December 2007. In July 2007, the [[Malindi District]] Commission established and chaired a district-level committee on child sex tourism. In June 2007, a German national was arrested and charged with sexually exploiting two trafficked children from [[Nyanza Province|Nyanza]] at Likoni Children's Home. There were no reports of the Kenyan government's efforts to provide anti-trafficking training for its troops before deployment on international peacekeeping missions.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt; Non-governmental organizations such as [[Awareness Against Human Trafficking (HAART)]] are working on ending human trafficking in Kenya.

Institutional investors, notably [[North American]] and [[Europe]]an [[development finance institution]]s, [[pension fund]]s and [[Financial endowment|endowment]]s have played a leading role in the development of impact investing.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://amnt.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/G20-Nations-Shifting-the-Trillions__RAF__Q3-2017.pdf |work=Revue Analyse Financière |location=Paris |title=G20 Nations Shifting the Trillions: Impact Investing, Green Infrastructure and Inclusive Growth |first=M. Nicolas J. |last=Firzli |date=7 July 2017 |accessdate=7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Under [[Pope Francis]], the [[Catholic Church]] has witnessed an increased interest in impact investing.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21726719-some-worry-it-might-sully-its-charitable-aims-catholic-church-dabbles The Catholic church dabbles with impact investing Some Worry], ''[[The Economist]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Historically, regulation—and to a lesser extent, [[philanthropy]]—was an attempt to minimize the negative social consequences ([[Unintended Consequences|unintended consequences]], [[Externality|externalities]]) of business activities.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}} However, a [[Socially responsible investing#History|history]] of individual investors using [[socially responsible investing]] to express their values exists, and such investing behavior is usually defined by the avoidance of investments in specific companies or activities with negative effects.&lt;ref name="HAYATusman"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hayat|first1=Usman|title=Impact investing: making money the charitable way|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/894847e6-22a9-11e2-8edf-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3AN2qP1H0|accessdate=14 August 2014|publisher=Financial Times|date=4 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his paper "The Nature of Returns: A Social Capital Markets Inquiry into Elements of Investment and The Blended Value Proposition", Jed Emerson first introduced the concept of [[blended value]], relating it to the pursuit of maximized social, environmental, and financial returns on capital investments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Emerson |first1=Jed |title=The Nature of Returns: A Social Capital Markets Inquiry into Elements of Investment and The BVP |date=2000 |url=http://www.blendedvalue.org/wp-content/uploads/2004/02/pdf-nature-of-returns.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Antony Bugg-Levine and Jed Emerson co-authored the first book on impact investing, ''Impact Investing: Transforming How We Make Money While Making a Difference''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Emerson |first1=Jed |last2=Bugg-Levine |first2=Antony |title=Impact Investing: Transforming How We Make Money While Making a Difference |date=2011 |isbn=978-0-470-90721-4 |url=https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Impact+Investing%3A+Transforming+How+We+Make+Money+While+Making+a+Difference-p-9780470907214}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, Emerson has produced a large body of work detailing the diverse investment vehicles available to maximize the social, environmental, and financial value of investments, &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Emerson |first1=Jed |title=The Investors' Toolkit: Generating Multiple Returns Through A Unified Investment Strategy |date=2004 |url=http://www.blendedvalue.org/wp-content/uploads/2004/02/pdf-investors-toolkit.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as work related to the construction of an impact investment portfolio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Emerson |first1=Jed |last2=Smalling |first2=Lindsay |title=Construction of an Impact Portfolio: Total Portfolio Management for Multiple Returns |journal=ImpactAssets |date=2015 |url=http://www.blendedvalue.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Total-Portfolio-Management-15.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Simultaneously, approaches such as [[pollution prevention]], [[corporate social responsibility]], and [[triple bottom line]] began as measurements of non-financial effects, both inside and outside of corporations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bugg-Levine|first1=Anthony|title=Impact Investing: Transforming How We Make Money While Making a Difference|date=2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=0470907215|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, Baruch Lev, of the [[NYU]] [[Stern School of Business]], collated thinking about [[intangible assets]] in a book of the same name, which furthered thinking about the non-financial effects of corporate production.&lt;ref&gt;[http://raw.rutgers.edu/docs/intangibles/Papers/Intangible%20Assets%20Concepts%20and%20Measurements.pdf Transcript from Intangible assets by Baruch Lev]&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, around 2007, the term "impact investing" emerged.&lt;ref name="STATE"&gt;{{cite news|title=The State and Future of Impact Investing|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/rahimkanani/2012/02/23/the-state-and-future-of-impact-investing/|accessdate=14 August 2014|publisher=Forbes|date=2012-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; A commitment to measuring social and environmental performance, with the same rigor as that applied to financial performance, is a critical component of impact investing.&lt;ref name="FORBESP"&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/phildemuth/2014/04/22/is-impact-investing-just-bad-economics/ Is 'Impact Investing' Just Bad Economics?], ''Forbes'', April 22, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The industry ===
The number of funds engaged in impact investing grew quickly over a five-year period and a 2009 report from research firm the [[Monitor Group]] estimated that the impact investing industry could grow from around US$50 billion in assets to $500 billion in assets within the subsequent decade.&lt;ref name="Monitor09"&gt;{{cite web|title=Investing for Environmental and Social Impact|url=http://www.monitorinstitute.com/downloads/what-we-think/impact-investing/Impact_Investing.pdf|work=Monitor Institute|publisher=Monitor Institute|accessdate=15 December 2013|author=Jessica Freireich and Katherine Fulton|format=PDF|date=January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such capital may be deployed using a range of investment instruments, including equity, debt, real assets,  loan guarantees, and others.&lt;ref name="Monitor09"/&gt; The growth of impact investing is partly attributed to the criticism of traditional forms of philanthropy and [[international development]], which have been characterized as unsustainable and driven by the goals—or whims—of the corresponding donors.&lt;ref name="PARTNERS"&gt;{{cite web|title=Impact investing for sustainable development|url=http://www.partnersglobal.org/news/impact-investing-for-sustainable-development|website=Partners Global|publisher=Partners Global|accessdate=2015-04-16|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150615194851/http://www.partnersglobal.org/news/impact-investing-for-sustainable-development|archivedate=2015-06-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently impact investing is still only a small market when compared to the global equity market, estimated at US$61 trillion (market capitalization of domestic listed companies) by the World Bank in 2015.&lt;ref name="THEGIIN"&gt;[https://thegiin.org/impact-investing/need-to-know/]&lt;/ref&gt; Impact investors managed USD 114 billion in impact investing assets, a figure that serves as a best-available 'floor' for the size of the impact investing market, according to GIIN's 2017 ''Annual Impact Investor Survey''. The largest sectors by asset allocation were microfinance, energy, housing, and financial services.&lt;ref name="FORBESMORATA"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/janetnovack/2017/04/21/why-impact-investing-may-flourish-in-the-age-of-donald-trump/#4ba5cf59a3c6|title=why-impact-investing-may-flourish-in-the-age-of-donald-trump|last=Morata|first=Ed|date=21 April 2017|website=Forbes|archive-url=why-impact-investing-may-flourish-in-the-age-of-donald-trump|archivedate=21 April 2017|dead-url=|accessdate=17 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="THEGIIN"/&gt;

Many [[development finance institution]]s, such as the British [[Commonwealth Development Corporation]] or Norwegian [[Norfund]], can also be considered impact investors, because they allocate a portion of their portfolio to investments that deliver financial as well as social or environmental benefits.&lt;ref name="INVESTO"&gt;{{cite web|title=Impact investing how it works|url=http://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/060915/impact-investing-how-it-works-and-how-invest.asp|website=Investopedia|accessdate=14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Impact investing is distinguished from [[crowdfunding]] sites, such as [[Indiegogo]] or [[Kickstarter]], because impact investments are typically debt or equity investments over US$1,000—with longer-than-traditional [[venture capital]] payment times—and an "exit strategy" (traditionally an [[Initial public offering|initial public offering (IPO)]] or buyout in the for-profit [[Startup company|startup]] sector) may be non-existent. Although some social enterprises are nonprofits, impact investing typically involves for-profit, social- or environmental-mission-driven businesses.

Organizations receiving impact investment capital may be set up legally as a for-profit, not-for profit, [[B Corporation]], [[L3C|Low-profit Limited Liability Company]], [[Community Interest Company]], or other designations that may vary by country. In much of Europe, these are known as '[[social enterprise]]s'.&lt;ref name="FTbob"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sherwood|first1=Bob|title=Social enterprise start-ups blossom|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/1d2b3ed2-aa2e-11e0-94a6-00144feabdc0.html|accessdate=8 October 2014|publisher=Financial Times|date=4 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==  Institutional Impact Investing ==

=== Institutional investors ===
Impact investments occur across asset classes and investment amounts. Among the best-known mechanism is private equity or venture capital. "[[Social venture capital]]", or "patient capital", impact investments are structured similarly to those in the rest of the venture capital community. Investors may take an active role mentoring or leading the growth of the company,&lt;ref name="NASDAQ"&gt;{{cite web|title=Wealthy Attracted To Impact Investing|url=http://www.nasdaq.com/article/wealthy-attracted-to-impact-investing-cm23388|work=NASDAQ|publisher=NASDAQ|accessdate=15 December 2013|author=Financial Advisor Magazine|date=2 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; similar to the way a venture capital firm assists in the growth of an early-stage company. Hedge funds and private equity funds may also pursue impact investing strategies.&lt;ref name="EST"&gt;Lemke, Lins, Hoenig and Rube, ''Hedge Funds and Other Private Funds'', §6:43 (Thomson West, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

Impact investment "accelerators" also exist for seed- and growth-stage social enterprises. Similar to seed-stage accelerators for traditional startups, impact investment accelerators provide smaller amounts of capital than Series A financings or larger impact investment deals.&lt;ref name="PIONEERGAP"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Baird|first1=Ross|title=Bridging the "Pioneer Gap": The Role of Accelerators in Launching High-Impact Enterprises|url=http://www.aspeninstitute.org/sites/default/files/content/docs/ande/Bridging%20the%20Pioneer%20Gap%20The%20Role%20of%20Accelerators%20in%20Launching%20High%20Impact%20Enterprises%20.pdf|accessdate=8 October 2014|publisher=Aspen Institute|date=1 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most "impact investment accelerators" are nonprofits, raising grants from donors to pay for business development services; however, commercially orientated accelerators providing investment readiness and capital-raising advisory services are emerging.

Large corporations are also emerging as powerful mechanisms for impact investing. Companies that seek to create shared value through developing new products/services, or positively impacting their operations, are beginning to employ impact investments through their value chain, particularly their supply chain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Unpacking the Impact in Impact Investing|url=http://www.ssireview.org/articles/entry/unpacking_the_impact_in_impact_investing|publisher=SSIR|accessdate=14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Impact investing can help organizations become self-sufficient by enabling them to carry out their projects and initiatives without having to rely heavily on donations and state subsidies. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Impact Investing?|url=http://esg.adec-innovations.com/about-us/faqs/what-is-impact-investing/|publisher=ADEC Innovations ESG Solutions|accessdate=28 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Increased supranational and pension cooperation ===
Governments and national and international public institutions including [[development finance institution]]s have sought to leverage their impact-oriented policies by encouraging [[pension fund]]s and other large asset owners to co-invest with them in impact-informed assets and projects, notably in the [[Global South]]. [[World Pensions &amp; Investments Forum|World Pensions Council]] and other US and European experts have welcome this course of action, insisting nonetheless that: &lt;blockquote&gt;”Governments and international institutions need to do more if they truly seek to ‘unlock’ private sector capital in a meaningful way. They have to ask themselves the following questions: what are the concrete legal, regulatory, financial and [[fiduciary]] concerns facing pension fund [[board members]]? How can we improve emerging industry standards for impact measurement and help pension trustees steer more long-term capital towards valuable economic endeavors at home and abroad, while, simultaneously, ensuring fair [[risk-adjusted return on capital|risk-adjusted returns]] for future pensioners?”&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Mission investing by foundations ===
Mission investments are investments made by foundations and other mission-based organizations to further their philanthropic goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Berliner|first1=Peter|title=About Mission Investing|url=https://www.missioninvestors.org/node/7|publisher=Mission Investors Exchange|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jed Emerson has published viewpoints in favor of this strategy, asserting that foundations' endowments should be invested in alignment with the mission of the foundation, rather than solely to maximize financial return.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Emerson |first1=Jed |title=Where Money Meets Mission: Breaking Down the Firewall Between Foundation Investments and Programming |journal=Stanford Social Innovation Review |date=2003 |url=http://www.blendedvalue.org/wp-content/uploads/2004/02/pdf-money-meets-mission.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mission investments include any type of investment that is intended and designed to generate both a measurable social or environmental benefit and a financial return:
* Program-related investments (PRIs) or other concessionary (below-market rate) investments are primarily made to achieve programmatic rather than financial objectives. This category includes grant support, equity (stock), subordinated loans, senior loans, below-market cash deposits and loan guarantees. For private foundations, PRIs count towards the required 5 percent annual payout.
* Market-rate investments (MRIs) expected to generate a market-rate financial return on investment comparable to an ordinary investment of a similar type and risk profile. They are designed to have a positive impact while contributing to the foundation’s long-term financial stability and growth. This category includes market-rate cash deposits, fixed income (bond), private equity and public equity (stocks).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Berliner|first1=Peter|last2=Spruill|first2=Vikki|title=The Many Forms of Impact Investing|journal=Community Foundation Field Guide to Impact Investing|date=September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact investing by individuals ==
Impact investing historically took place through mechanisms aimed at institutional investors. However, there are ways for individuals to participate in providing early stage or growth funding to such ventures.

=== Exchange-traded funds ===

[[Exchange-traded fund]]s like the SPDR Gender Diversity ETF ({{NYSE Arca | SHE}}) from [[State Street Global Advisors|State Street]] are publicly traded and hence available to anyone with a stock brokerage account. [[MSCI]] offers 11 environmental, social and governance index ETFs, including popular low-carbon and sustainability indexes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/05/your-money/in-fledgling-exchange-traded-fund-striking-a-blow-for-women.html|title=In Fledgling Exchange-Traded Fund, Striking a Blow for Women|last=Sullivan|first=Paul|date=2016-03-04|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Syndicate or pooled investing ===

Groups of [[angel investor]]s focused on impact, where individuals invest as a syndicate also exist. Examples include Investors' Circle in the US,&lt;ref name="UPWARD"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Field|first1=Anne|title=Investors' Circle Continues Its Upward Spiral|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/annefield/2013/01/04/investors-circle-continues-its-upward-spiral/|accessdate=8 October 2014|publisher=Forbes|date=1 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clearly Social Angels in the United Kingdom&lt;ref name="FTnorma"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cohen|first1=Norma|title=Making good and doing good|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/47af39ba-90b9-11e2-862b-00144feabdc0.html|accessdate=8 October 2014|publisher=The Financial Times|date=2013-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Toniic in Europe.&lt;ref name="KEYTRENDS"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Say|first1=My|title=5 Key Trends In Impact Investing|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/groupthink/2013/05/02/5-key-trends-in-impact-investing/|accessdate=8 October 2014|publisher=Forbes|date=5 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Digital microfinance platforms ===

Web-based investing platforms, which offer lower-cost investing services, also exists. As equity deals can be prohibitively expensive for small-scale transactions, microfinance loans, rather than equity investment, are prevalent in these platforms. [[MyC4]], founded in 2006, allows retail investors to loan to small businesses in African countries via local intermediaries. [[Microplace]] was an early United States provider of such services which ceased taking on new loans in 2014, stating that its results "haven't scaled to the widespread social impact we aspire to achieve".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Future of Microplace|url=https://www.microplace.com/|website=Microplace|accessdate=1 October 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906141227/https://www.microplace.com/|archivedate=6 September 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Impact investing in Asia ===

Impact Investing in Asia is a burgeoning sector with many funds currently in play.  However, many funds suffer from finding robust levels of investment opportunities for their pipeline given their ability to hedge internal requirements and risks and a potential inability to exit the various investments that they are invested in.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

The most extreme form of such violence may be termed ''battering'', ''intimate terrorism'', ''coercive controlling violence'', or simply ''[[coercive control]]'', in which one person is violent and controlling; this is generally perpetrated by men against women, and is the most likely of the types to require medical services and the use of a [[women's shelter]].&lt;ref name="Regan"&gt;{{cite book|author=Pamela Regan|title=Close Relationships|publisher=[[Routledge]]|isbn=1136851607|year=2011|pages=456–460|accessdate=March 1, 2016|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MZCsAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT456}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Emery"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert E.

The most common but less injurious form of intimate partner violence is ''situational couple violence'' (also known as ''situational violence''), which is conducted by individuals of both genders nearly equally,&lt;ref name="Emery"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Anglin &amp; Homeier"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Howe p. 370"/&gt; and is more likely to occur among younger couples, including adolescents (see [[teen dating violence]]) and those of college age.&lt;ref name="Howe p. 370"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bowen"&gt;{{cite book|authors=Erica Bowen, Kate Walker|title=The Psychology of Violence in Adolescent Romantic Relationships|publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]|isbn=1137321407|year=2015|pages=107–108|accessdate=March 1, 2016|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6TsTBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT107}}&lt;/ref&gt; A last form of violence, in which both partners in the relationship engage in controlling and violent behavior, is called ''mutual violent control''.

==Background==
[[File:Maltraitance fait aux femmes.jpg|thumb|Physical violence against a woman in [[Benin]].]]
Intimate partner violence occurs between two people in an intimate relationship. It may occur between heterosexual or homosexual couples and victims can be male or female. Couples may be dating, cohabiting or married and violence can occur in or outside of the home.&lt;ref name="Howe p. 370"/&gt;

Studies in the 1990s showed that both men and women could be abusers or victims of domestic violence.{{refn|Gelles 1980, 1989; McNeely and Mann 1990; Shupe, Stacey, and Hazelwood 1987; Straus 1973; Straus, Gelles, and Steinmetz 1980; Steinmetz 1977/1978.|group=nb}} Women are more likely to act violently in retaliation or self-defense and tend to engage in less severe forms of violence than men whereas men are more likely to commit long-term cycles of abuse than women. 

The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) defines intimate partner violence as "any behaviour within an intimate relationship that causes physical, psychological or sexual harm to those in the relationship".&lt;ref name="who.int"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Krug | first1 = Etienne G. | last2 = Dahlberg | first2 = Linda L. | last3 = Mercy | first3 = James A. | last4 = Zwi | first4 = Anthony B. | last5 = Lozano | first5 = Rafael | title = World report on violence and health | publisher = [[World Health Organization]] | location = Geneva, Switzerland | year = 2002 | url = http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/world_report/en/full_en.pdf | isbn = 9789240681804 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The WHO also adds controlling behaviors as a form of abuse.&lt;ref name="apps.who.int"&gt;{{cite book | last = WHO | author-link = World Health Organization | title = Understanding and addressing intimate partner violence | publisher = [[World Health Organization]] | location = Geneva, Switzerland | url = http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/77432/1/WHO_RHR_12.36_eng.pdf | id = WHO/RHR/12.36 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a study conducted in 2010, 30% of women globally aged 15 and older have experienced physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Devries|first=K.M.|date=2013|title=The Global Prevalence of Intimate Partner Violence Against Women.|url=|journal=Science|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Screening tools===
The [[U.S. Preventive Services Task Force]] (USPSTF) as of 2018 recommends screening women of reproductive age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Draft Recommendation Statement: Intimate Partner Violence, Elder Abuse, and Abuse of Vulnerable Adults: Screening  - US Preventive Services Task Force|url=https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/draft-recommendation-statement/intimate-partner-violence-and-abuse-of-elderly-and-vulnerable-adults-screening1|website=www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org|accessdate=26 April 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The HITS is a four-item scale rated on a 5-point Likert scale from 1 (never) to 5 (frequently). This tool was Initially developed and tested among family physicians and family practice offices, and since then has been evaluated in diverse outpatient settings. Internal reliability and concurrent validity are acceptable. Generally, sensitivity of this measure has found to be lower among men than among women.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The WAST is an eight-item measure (there is a short form of the WAST that consists of the first two items only). It was originally developed for family physicians, but subsequently has been tested in the emergency department. It has been found to have good internal reliability and acceptable concurrent validity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The PVS is a three-item measure scored on a yes/no scale, with positive responses to any question denoting abuse. It was developed as a brief instrument for the emergency department.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The AAS is a five-item measure scored on a yes/no scale, with positive responses to any question denoting abuse. It was created to detect abuse perpetrated against pregnant women. The screening tool has been tested predominantly with young, poor women. It has acceptable test retest reliability.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rabin|first=Rebecca F.|last2=Jennings|first2=Jacky M.|last3=Campbell|first3=Jacquelyn C.|last4=Bair-Merritt|first4=Megan H.|date=2009-05-01|title=Intimate Partner Violence Screening Tools: A Systematic Review|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0749379709000907|journal=American Journal of Preventive Medicine|volume=36|issue=5|pages=439–445.e4|doi=10.1016/j.amepre.2009.01.024|pmc=2688958}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intimate terrorism===

Intimate terrorism, or coercive controlling violence (CCV), occurs when one partner in a relationship, typically a man, uses [[Abusive power and control|coercive control and power]] over the other partner,&lt;ref name="Anglin &amp; Homeier"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Flood 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bogat 2016"/&gt; using threats, [[intimidation]], and [[Isolation to facilitate abuse|isolation]].

Violent resistance (VR), a form of [[self-defense]], is violence perpetrated by victims against their partners who have exerted intimate terrorism against them.&lt;ref name="Nicolson p. 40" /&gt;  Within relationships of intimate terrorism and violent resistance, 96% of the violent resisters are women.&lt;ref name="Howe p. 370" /&gt; VR can occur as an instinctive reaction in response to an initial attack or a defense mechanism after prolonged instances of violence.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Michael P.|date=July 2011|title=Gender and types of intimate partner violence: A response to an anti-feminist literature review|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.avb.2011.04.006|journal=Aggression and Violent Behavior|volume=16|issue=4|pages=289–296|doi=10.1016/j.avb.2011.04.006|issn=1359-1789}}&lt;/ref&gt; This form of resistance can sometimes become fatal if the victim feels as though their only way out is to kill their partner. &lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

===Situational couple violence===
{{See also|Teen dating violence}}
Situational couple violence, also called common couple violence, is not connected to general control behavior, but arises in a single argument where one or both partners physically lash out at the other.&lt;ref name="Howe p. 370" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nicolson p. 40" /&gt; This is the most common form of intimate partner violence, particularly in the western world and among young couples, and involves members of both sexes nearly equally. Among college students, Johnson found it to be perpetrated about 44% of the time by women and 56% of the time by men.&lt;ref name="Howe p. 370" /&gt;

Johnson states that situational couple violence involves a relationship dynamic "in which conflict occasionally gets 'out of hand,' leading usually to 'minor' forms of violence, and rarely escalating into serious or life-threatening forms of violence."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Johnson | first = Michael P. | author-link = Michael P. Johnson | title = Patriarchal terrorism and common couple violence: two forms of violence against women | journal = [[Journal of Marriage and Family]] | volume = 57 | issue = 2 | pages = 283–294 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] for the National Council on Family Relations | doi = 10.2307/353683 | jstor = 353683 | date = May 1995 | url= https://dx.doi.org/10.2307/353683 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://www.personal.psu.edu/mpj/1995%20JMF.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In situational couple violence, acts of violence by men and women occur at fairly equal rates, with rare occurrences of injury, and are not committed in an attempt to control a partner.&lt;ref name="olson"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Olson | first = Loreen N. | title = Exploring "common couple violence" in heterosexual romantic relationships | journal = Western Journal of Communication | volume = 66 | issue = 1 | pages = 104–128 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/10570310209374727 | date = March 2002 | url= https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10570310209374727 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is estimated that approximately 50% of couples experience situational couple violence in their relationships.&lt;ref name="olson"/&gt;

Situational couple violence involves:

* Mode: Mildly aggressive behavior such as throwing objects, ranging to more aggressive behaviors such as pushing, slapping, biting, hitting, scratching, or hair pulling.
* Frequency: Less frequent than partner terrorism, occurring once in a while during an argument or disagreement.
* Severity: Milder than intimate terrorism, very rarely escalates to more severe abuse, generally does not include injuries that were serious or that caused one partner to be admitted to a hospital.
* Mutuality: Violence may be equally expressed by either partner in the relationship.
* Intent: Occurs out of anger or frustration rather than as a means of gaining control and power over the other partner.

===Mutual violent control===
Mutual violent control (MVC) is rare type of intimate partner violence occurring when both partners act in a violent manner, battling for control.&lt;ref name="Nicolson p. 40" /&gt;

=== Reciprocal and non-reciprocal ===
The CDC divides domestic violence into two types: reciprocal, in which both partners are violent, and non-reciprocal violence, in which one partner is violent.&lt;ref name="Straus_Dom"/&gt;&lt;ref name="10.2105/AJPH.2005.079020"/&gt; Of the four types, situational couple violence and mutual violent control are reciprocal, while intimate terrorism is non-reciprocal. Violent resistance on its own is non-reciprocal, but is reciprocal when in response to intimate terrorism.

In the 1970s and 1980s, studies using large, nationally representative samples resulted in findings indicating that women were as violent as men in intimate relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Archer|first=John|title=Sex differences in aggression between heterosexual partners: A meta-analytic review.|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0033-2909.126.5.651|journal=Psychological Bulletin|language=en|volume=126|issue=5|pages=651–680|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.126.5.651}}&lt;/ref&gt; This information diverged significantly from shelter, hospital, and police data, initiating a long-standing debate, termed "the gender symmetry debate".

Researchers such as [[Michael Kimmel|Michael S Kimmel]] have criticized CTS methodology in assessing relations between gender and domestic violence. Kimmel argued that the CTS excluded two important facets in gender violence: conflict-motivated aggression and control motivated aggression.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The first facet is a form of family conflict (such as an argument) while the latter is using violence as a tool for control. Kimmel also argued that the CTS failed to assess for the severity of the injury, sexual assaults and abuse from ex-partners or spouses.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Women generally suffer more severe and long-lasting forms of partner abuse than men, and men generally have more opportunities to leave an abusive partner than women do.{{refn|name=Wallace &amp; Robertson 2016}} Researchers have found different outcomes in men and women in response to such abuse. A 2012 review from the journal ''[[Psychology of Violence]]'' found that women suffered from over-proportionate numbers of injuries, fear, and [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|posttraumatic stress]] as a result of partner violence.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Caldwell|first=Jennifer E.|date=January 2012|title=Gender differences in intimate partner violence outcomes|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/a0026296|journal=[[Psychology of Violence]]|publisher=[[American Psychological Association]] via [[PsycINFO|PsycNET]]|volume=2|issue=1|pages=42–45|doi=10.1037/a0026296|postscript=.|ref=harv}} [http://people.cas.sc.edu/swansc/1.swan_web_articles/2012_CaldwellSwan_GenderDiffIPVOutcomes.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; The review also found that 70% of female victims felt frightened as a result of violence perpetrated by their partners whereas 85% of male victims expressed "no fear" in response to such violence.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Lastly, IPV correlated with relationship satisfaction for women but it did not do so for men.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

According to government statistics from the [[United States Department of Justice|US Department of Justice]], male perpetrators constituted 96% of federal prosecution on domestic violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/fvs02.pdf|title=Family violence statistics including statistics on strangers and acquaintances|last=Durose|first=Matthew R|date=2005|website=bjs.gov|publisher=US Department of Justice|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another report by the [[United States Department of Justice|US department of Justice]] on non-fatal domestic violence from 2003–2012 found that 76% of domestic violence was committed against women and 24% was committed against men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/ndv0312.pdf|title=Nonfatal Domestic Violence, 2003–2012|last=Truman|first=Jennifer L|date=2014|website=bjs.gov|publisher=US Department of Justice|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]], the percentage of victims killed by their spouses or ex-spouses was 77.4% for women and 22.6% for men in selected countries across Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unodc.org/documents/congress/background-information/Crime_Statistics/Global_Study_on_Homicide_2011.pdf|title=Global study on homicide|last=Gibbons|first=Jonathan|date=2011|website=unodc.org|publisher=United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (Vienna)|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Globally, men's perpetration of intimate partner violence against women often stems from conceptions of masculinity and patriarchy.

=== Gender symmetry ===
{{See also|Domestic violence against men#Gender symmetry}}The theory that women perpetrate intimate partner violence (IPV) at roughly the same rate as men has been termed "gender symmetry." The earliest empirical evidence of gender symmetry was presented in the 1975 U.S. National Family Violence Survey carried out by [[Murray A. Straus]] and [[Richard James Gelles|Richard J. Gelles]] on a nationally representative sample of 2,146 "intact families." The survey found 11.6% of men and 12% of women had experienced some kind of IPV in the last twelve months, while 4.6% of men and 3.8% of women had experienced "severe" IPV.&lt;ref name="National"&gt;{{citation|title=Intimate violence: the causes and consequences of abuse in the American family|url=http://pubpages.unh.edu/~mas2/Straus-Intimate%20Partner%20Violence-Book.pdf|year=1988|ref=harv|postscript=.|last1=Gelles|last2=Straus|first1=Richard J.|first2=Murray A.|page=104|contribution=How violent are American families?|location=New York|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|isbn=9780671682965|editor-last1=Gelles|editor-first1=Richard J.|editor-last2=Straus|editor-first2=Murray A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thirty years"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Straus|first=Murray A.|date=June 2010|title=Thirty years of denying the evidence on gender symmetry in partner violence: implications for prevention and treatment|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/springer/vav/1991/00000006/00000002/art00003|journal=Partner Abuse|publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]|volume=1|issue=3|pages=332–362|doi=10.1891/1946-6560.1.3.332|postscript=.|ref=harv}} [http://pubpages.unh.edu/~mas2/V71-Straus_Thirty-Years-Denying-Evidence-PV_10.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|333}}

A 2013 review examined studies from five [[continents]] and the correlation between a country's level of gender inequality and rates of domestic violence. The authors found that when partner abuse is defined broadly to include emotional abuse, any kind of hitting, and who hits first, partner abuse is relatively even. They also stated if one examines who is physically harmed and how seriously, expresses more fear, and experiences subsequent psychological problems, domestic violence is significantly gendered toward women as victims.&lt;ref name="Eugenio"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Esquivel-Santovena |first1=Esteban Eugenio | last2=Lambert | first2=Teri | last3=Hamel | first3=John | title = Partner abuse worldwide | journal = Partner Abuse | volume = 4 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–8 | doi = 10.1891/1946-6560.4.1.e14 |url =http://domesticviolenceresearch.org/pdf/PASK.Tables14.Revised.pdf| date = January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sexual violence ==
{{Main article|Sexual violence by intimate partners}}
Sexual violence by intimate partners varies by country and can reach as high as 25% of the women having been subject to forced sex. In some countries forced sex, or marital rape, often occurs with other forms of domestic violence, particularly physical abuse.

==Treatment==

===Individual treatment===

Due to the high prevalence and devastating consequences of IPV, approaches to decrease and prevent violence from re-occurring is of upmost importance. Initial police response and arrest is not always enough to protect victims from recurrence of abuse; thus, many states have mandated participation in batterer intervention programs (BIPs) for men who have been charged with assault against an intimate partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zarling|first=Amie|last2=Bannon|first2=Sarah|last3=Berta|first3=Meg|title=Evaluation of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy for Domestic Violence Offenders.|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/vio0000097|journal=Psychology of Violence|language=en|doi=10.1037/vio0000097}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these BIPs are based on the Duluth Model and incorporate some cognitive behavioral techniques.

The Duluth model is one of the most common current interventions for IPV. It represents a psycho-educational approach that was developed by paraprofessionals from information gathered from interviewing battered women in shelters and using principles from feminist and sociological frameworks.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=pBjZSdZ1LsEC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR7&amp;dq=).+Education+groups+for+men+who+batter:+The+Duluth+model&amp;ots=fQnu6Ou9XE&amp;sig=Y5ubS5ovAdoGA4jN4KpnzzqGbRY#v=onepage&amp;q=).%20Education%20groups%20for%20men%20who%20batter:%20The%20Duluth%20model&amp;f=false|title=Education Groups for Men Who Batter: The Duluth Model|last=Pence|first=Ellen|last2=Paymar|first2=Michael|date=1993-04-06|publisher=Springer Publishing Company|isbn=9780826179913|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the main components used in the Duluth Model is the 'power and control wheel,' which conceptualizes IPV as one form of abuse to maintain male privilege. Using the 'power and control wheel,' the goal of treatment is to achieve behaviors that fall on the 'equality wheel' by re-educate men and by replacing maladaptive attitudes held by men.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

[[Cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT) techniques focus on modifying faulty or problematic cognitions, beliefs, and emotions to prevent future violent behavior and include skills training such as anger management, assertiveness, and relaxation techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Feminist perspectives on wife abuse|last=Adams|first=David|publisher=Sage Publications|year=1988|isbn=|location=|pages=176–199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, the addition of Duluth and CBT approaches results in a 5% reduction in IPV.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Babcock|first=Julia C|last2=Green|first2=Charles E|last3=Robie|first3=Chet|title=Does batterers' treatment work? A meta-analytic review of domestic violence treatment|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpr.2002.07.001|journal=Clinical Psychology Review|volume=23|issue=8|pages=1023–1053|doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2002.07.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This low reduction rate might be explained, at least in part, by the high prevalence of bidirectional violence&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; as well as client-treatment matching versus “one-size-fits-all” approaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cornell|first=Dewey G.|last2=Warren|first2=Janet|last3=Hawk|first3=Gary|last4=Stafford|first4=Ed|last5=Oram|first5=Guy|last6=Pine|first6=Denise|title=Psychopathy in instrumental and reactive violent offenders.|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0022-006X.64.4.783|journal=Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology|volume=64|issue=4|pages=783–790|doi=10.1037/0022-006x.64.4.783}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Achieving change through values-based behavior (ACTV) is a newly developed Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)-based program. Developed by domestic violence researcher Amie Zarling and colleagues at Iowa State University, the aim of ACTV is teach abusers "situational awareness"—to recognize and tolerate uncomfortable feelings – so that they can stop themselves from exploding into rage.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2017/10/21/558623534/iowa-tries-a-new-domestic-violence-intervention-mindfulness|title=Iowa Tries A New Domestic Violence Intervention: Mindfulness|work=NPR.org|access-date=2017-11-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initial evidence of the ACTV program has shown high promise: Using a sample 3,474 men who were arrested for domestic assault and court-mandated to a BIP (either ACTV or Duluth/CBT), Zarling and colleagues showed that compared with Duluth/CBT participants, significantly fewer ACTV participants acquired any new charges, domestic assault charges, or violent charges. ACTV participants also acquired significantly fewer charges on average in the 1 year after treatment than Duluth/CBT participants.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

===Conjoint treatment===

Some estimates show that as many as 50% of couples who experience IPV engage in some form of reciprocal violence.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Nevertheless, most services address offenders and survivors separately. In addition, many couples who have experienced IPV decide to stay together. These couples may present to couples or family therapy. In fact, 37-58% of couples who seek regular outpatient treatment have experienced physical assault in the past year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Prevalence of partner aggression in representative and clinic samples.|last=Jose O'Leary|first=|publisher=APA|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=15–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these cases, clinicians are faced with the decision as to whether they should accept or refuse to treat these couples. Although the use of conjoint treatment for IPV is controversial as it may present a danger to victims and potentially escalate abuse, it may be useful to others, such as couples experiencing situational couple violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stith|first=Sandra M.|last2=McCollum|first2=Eric E.|date=2011-07-01|title=Conjoint treatment of couples who have experienced intimate partner violence|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359178911000644|journal=Aggression and Violent Behavior|series=Current Controversies on the Role of Gender in Partner Violence|volume=16|issue=4|pages=312–318|doi=10.1016/j.avb.2011.04.012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars and practitioners in the field call for tailoring of interventions to various sub-types of violence and individuals served.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McCollum|first=Eric E.|last2=Stith|first2=Sandra M.|date=2007-06-25|title=Conjoint Couple's Treatment for Intimate Partner Violence|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1300/J398v06n01_07|journal=Journal of Couple &amp; Relationship Therapy|volume=6|issue=1-2|pages=71–82|doi=10.1300/J398v06n01_07|issn=1533-2691}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Behavioral couple's therapy (BCT) is cognitive-behavioral approach, typically delivered to outpatients in 15-20 sessions over several months. Research suggests that BCT can be effective in reducing IPV when used to treat co-occurring addictions, which is important work because IPV and substance abuse and misuse frequently co-occur.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Domestic conflict containment program (DCCP) is a highly structured skills-based program whose goal is to teach couples conflict containment skills.

Physical aggression couples treatment (PACT) is a modification of DCCP, which includes additional psychoeducational components designed to improve relationship quality, including such things as communication skills, fair fighting tactics, and dealing with gender differences, sex, and jealousy.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

The primary goal of domestic violence focused couples treatment (DVFCT) is to end violence with the additional goal of helping couples improve the quality of their relationships. It is designed to be conducted over 18 weeks and can be delivered in either individual or multi-couple group format.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stith, S. M., McCollum, E. E., Rosen, K. H., Locke, L., &amp; Goldberg, P. (2005). Domestic violence focused couples treatment. ''Handbook of clinical family therapy'', 406-430.

The '''Judicial Complaints Reviewer''' is not a Scottish [[public ombudsman]], as the role does not carry ombudsman powers of redress. The JCR is responsible for reviewing the handling of complaints against the [[judiciary of Scotland]] by the [[Judicial Office for Scotland]]. The post was established in 2011 as a result of the [[Judiciary and Courts (Scotland) Act 2008]]. The Reviewer is appointed by the [[Cabinet Secretary for Justice]], with the approval of the [[Lord President of the Court of Session]]. The Reviewer's services are open to those who have complained about the conduct of a member of the judiciary, and also to members of the judiciary who have been the subject of a complaint.

The first Judicial Complaints Reviewer was Moi Ali, 2011-2014 and the second was Gillian Thompson; who was appointed on 1 September 2014. The third reviewer takes up the role on 1st September 2017.

==Remit and jurisdiction==
Complaints about the conduct, both within and outwith the [[courts of Scotland]], of [[Judiciary of Scotland|judicial officer holders]] in Scotland are made to the Lord President through the Judicial Office for Scotland. However, the Judicial Office does not consider complaints about judicial decisions which are dealt with through [[appeal]]s.&lt;ref name="complaints"&gt;{{cite web|title=Complaints About Court Judiciary - You and the Judiciary - Judiciary of Scotland|url=http://www.scotland-judiciary.org.uk/15/0/Complaints|website=www.scotland-judiciary.org.uk|format=PDF|publisher=Judicial Office for Scotland|accessdate=4 April 2017|date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The office of the Judicial Complaints Reviewer was established by Section 30 of the [[Judiciary and Courts (Scotland) Act 2008]]&lt;ref name="act2008s30"&gt;{{cite web|title=Judiciary and Courts (Scotland) Act 2008 (Section 30)|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2008/6/section/30|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|publisher=The National Archives|accessdate=4 April 2017|language=en|date=29 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Reviewer's role is to review how complaints regarding members of [[judiciary of Scotland|the judiciary]] have been handled by the [[Judicial Office for Scotland]] in accordance with the complaint rules laid down by the Lord President. As of May 2017, complaints should be handled in line with Complaints About the Judiciary (Scotland) Rules 2017.&lt;ref name="rules2017"&gt;{{cite web|title=Complaints About the Judiciary (Scotland) Rules 2017|url=http://www.scotland-judiciary.org.uk/Upload/Documents/ComplaintsabouttheJudiciaryScotlandRules2017_1.pdf|website=scotland-judiciary.org.uk|publisher=Judicial Office for Scotland|accessdate=4 April 2017|date=31 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She cannot change the outcome of the investigation, overturn a decision, or initiate redress. However, where she finds a fault in the process she passes a referral to the Lord President who then makes decision.&lt;ref name="howcomplain"&gt;{{cite web|title=How to complain|url=http://www.judicialcomplaintsreviewer.org.uk/how-complain|website=www.judicialcomplaintsreviewer.org.uk|publisher=Judicial Complaints Reviewer|accessdate=4 April 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Karamanlides''' ({{lang-el|Καραμανλήδες}}; {{lang-tr|Karamanlılar}}), or simply '''Karamanlis''' are a [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek-Orthodox]], [[Turkish language|Turkish-speaking]] people native to the [[Karaman Province|Karaman]] and [[Cappadocia]] regions of [[Anatolia]]. Today, a majority of the population live within [[Greece]], though there is a notable diaspora in [[Western Europe]] and [[North America]].

==Etymology==

Karamanlides were [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople|Greek-Orthodox]] Christians in [[Geography of Turkey#Regions|Central Anatolia]] who spoke Turkish as their primary language. The term is geographical, derived from the 13th century Beylik of [[Karamanids|Karaman]]. This was the first Turkish kingdom to use Turkish as its [[official language]] and originally the term would only refer to the inhabitants of the town of [[Karaman]] or from the [[Karaman Province|region of Karaman]].

==Language==
[[File:Sille Agia Eleni Inscription.jpg|thumb|left|200px|An inscription in Karamanli Turkish on the entrance of the former Greek Orthodox church of Agia Eleni in [[Sille (village)|Sille]], near [[Konya]].]]
{{main|Karamanli Turkish}}
Historically, the Karamanlides spoke [[Karamanli Turkish]]. Its vocabulary drew overwhelmingly from Turkic words with many Greek loan words. The language should not be confused with [[Cappadocian Greek]], which was spoken in the same region during the same timeframe, but is derived from the Greek language.  While the official Ottoman Turkish was written in the [[Arabic script]], the Karamanlides used the [[Greek alphabet]] for writing its form of Turkish. Such texts are called '''Karamanlidika''' (Καραμανλήδικα / Καραμανλήδεια γραφή) or '''Karamanli Turkish''' today. Karamanli Turkish had its own literary tradition and produced numerous published works in print in the 19th century, some of them published by Evangelinos Misailidis, by the Anatoli or Misailidis publishing house (Misailidis 1986, p.&amp;nbsp;134).

Karamanli writers and speakers were expelled from Turkey as part of the [[Greek-Turkish population exchange]] of 1923. Some speakers preserved their language in the diaspora. The writing form stopped being used immediately after the Turkish state adopted the Latin alphabet.

A fragment of a manuscript written in Karamanli was also found in the [[Cairo Geniza]].&lt;ref&gt;Julia Krivoruchko Karamanli – a new language variety in the Genizah: T-S AS 215.255 http://www.lib.cam.ac.uk/Taylor-Schechter/fotm/july-2012/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
Academic disputes over the origins of the Karamanlides have led to the formation of two major theories.

According to one theory the Karamanlides descended from (religiously converted) Turkish soldiers ([[Turcopole]]s) that Byzantine emperors settled in Anatolia.&lt;ref name=Vryonis305&gt;Vryonis, Speros. ''Studies on Byzantium, Seljuks, and Ottomans: Reprinted Studies''. Undena Publications, 1981, {{ISBN|0-89003-071-5}}, p. 305. "The origins of the Karamanlides have long been disputed, there being two basic theories on the subject. According to one, they are the remnants of the Greek-speaking Byzantine population which, though it remained Orthodox, was linguistically Turkified. The second theory holds that they were originally Turkish soldiers which the Byzantine emperors had settled in Anatolia in large numbers and who retained their language and Christian religion after the Turkish conquests..."&lt;/ref&gt;

According to another theory the Karamanlides are the direct descendants of Byzantine Greeks. Despite their adoption of the Turkish language, they maintained their Greek Orthodox faith.&lt;ref name=Vryonis305/&gt; Linguists{{cn|date=July 2017}} were able to travel through Karamanli-speaking regions of Cappadocia and document the few remaining{{dubious|date=July 2017}} Greek words that mostly elderly residents could remember.&lt;ref name="Dawkins, R.M 1916"&gt;Dawkins, R.M. 1916.

[[Image:Karamanlides homeland.png|thumb|250px|right|The range of the ancestral homeland of the Karamanlides.]]
According to another theory held by İbrahim Tatarlı, the Karamanlides descend from [[Anatolian beyliks|beyliks]] of [[Bulgars|Bulgar Turks]] shifting to another form of [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] and preserving their [[Christianity|Christian]] religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tatarlı|first1=İbrahim|title=Bulgaristan'da Türk halk kültürü ve edebiyatının bazı ana sorunları, Türk varlığı|chapter=YÜZYILLARDA BULGAR BOYLARI VE BEYLİKLERİ, ONLARIN ANADOLU SELÇUKLULARI İMPARATORLUĞU VE KARAMAN BEYLİĞİ İLE İLİŞKİLERİ|date=2003|page=88-102|url=https://books.google.bg/books?id=8iJkAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=karaman+bulgar+Necip+As%C4%B1m&amp;dq=karaman+bulgar+Necip+As%C4%B1m&amp;hl=bg&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi5j8GMrYTeAhWhiIsKHclbDSkQ6AEIJjAA|quote=Belki de Türk dili kullanan, fakat dinleri Ortodoks hristiyanlık olan "Karamanlı" olarak nitelendirilen oymaklar da Türk Bulgarlarındandır.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A similar theory of Necib Asım holds that Karamanlides descend from [[Anatolian beyliks|beyliks]] of [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] [[Bulgarians]] who shifted from [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] to Turkish.&lt;ref&gt;Asım, Necib, “Anadolu'da Bulgarlar,” İkdam, no. 8842 (25 Safar 1340/oct. 28, 1921), p.4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Венедикова|first1=Катерина|title=Българите в Мала Азия: От древността до наши дни|url=http://ziezi.tripod.com/anadol/venedikova.htm|date=1998|publisher=University of Michigan|isbn=9789548638128|quote=Особено ценни са бележките на Неджип Асъм във втората половина от статията за езика, религията и произхода на тези българи.

К.В.) и говорят турски език, са остатъци, продължение от онези българи. Асъм подчертава нещо много важно, което не е писано от други изследвачи, нито пък става ясно от текста на "История на Караман", като изключим името на кралицата на българите от Бейшехир до Коня, Катерина, в приложението към разширения турски вариант на летописа, което говори за християнски произход: езикът на тези българи е славянски, а тяхната религия - християнска.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those theories refer to some states ([[Anatolian beyliks]] and [[Khan (title)|khanates]]), attested frequently as Bulgarian between 1098-1517 and seated in [[Ermenek]], and the [[Bulgar Dagh]] mountains.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ziezi.tripod.com/anadol/venedikova.htm Венедикова, Катерина (1998).

Alongside the Slavic-Turkic idiom, a mixed Greek-Turkish idiom [[Cappadocian Greek]] was spoken in [[Karaman Eyalet|Karaman]], which were all smaller communities than the [[Karamanli Turkish]] speakers. 

It seems that, although with notable exceptions, the Karamanlides did not manifest the Greek national identity of the time, preferring instead to call themselves [[Rûm|''Rum'']], "Romans" "Christians", or "Christians of Anatolia".&lt;ref&gt;Mackridge, Peter. ''Language and National Identity in Greece, 1766-1976'', Oxford, 2009, {{ISBN|0-199-59905-X}}, p.65.&lt;/ref&gt; There were also prominent members of the community, such as [[Papa Eftim I]], who believed that the Karamanlis originally were of Turkish descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beyaztarih.com/makale/anadolunun-ortodoks-toplulugu-karamanlilar|title=Anadolu'nun Ortodoks Topluluğu: Karamanlılar|website=beyaztarih.com|accessdate=28 December 2017|language=Turkish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Karamanlides were enrolled in Bulgarian schools and had [[Bulgarians|Bulgarian]] identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mateeva |first1=Vanya |title=Gagauzite--oshte edin pogled |publisher=Akademichno izd-vo "Marin Drinov" |isbn=9789544309909 |page=35, 36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Population==
Many Karamanlides were forced to leave their homes during the [[Population exchange between Greece and Turkey|1923 population exchange between Greece and Turkey]]. Early estimates placed the number of Orthodox Christians expelled from central and southern Anatolia at around 100,000.&lt;ref&gt;Blanchard, Raoul. "The Exchange of Populations Between Greece and Turkey." ''Geographical Review'', 15.3 (1925): 449-56.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Karamanlides were numbered at around 400,000 at the time of the exchange.&lt;ref&gt;Pavlowitch, Stevan K. ''A History of the Balkans, 1804-1945''. Longman, 1999, {{ISBN|0-582-04585-1}}, p. 36. "The karamanlides were Turkish-speaking Greeks or Turkish-speaking Orthodox Christians who lived mainly in Asia Minor. They numbered some 400,000 at the time of the 1923 exchange of populations between Greece and Turkey."&lt;/ref&gt;

The former premier of Greece,  named [[Konstantinos Karamanlis|Karamanlis]],  has his roots in  Karaman.

==Culture==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2009}}
The distinct culture that developed among the Karamanlides blended elements of Orthodox Christianity with an Ottoman-Turkish flavor that characterized their willingness to accept and immerse themselves in foreign customs. From the 14th to the 19th centuries, they enjoyed an explosion in literary refinement. Karamanli authors were especially productive in philosophy, religious writings, novels, and historical texts. Lyrical poetry in the late 19th century describes their indifference to both Greek and Turkish governments, and the confusion they felt as a Turkish-speaking people with a Greek ethos.

'''Krahn''' is an [[ethnic group]] of [[Liberia]] and [[Ivory Coast]]. This group belongs to the [[Kru language]] family and its people are sometimes referred to as the '''Wee''', '''Guéré''', '''Sapo''', or '''Wobe'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last =Library of Congress|author-link =Library of Congress|title =Krahn (African people)|year =2004|url =http://id.loc.gov/authorities/subjects/sh2003010694|accessdate =16 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is likely that Western contact with the Kru language is the primary reason for the development of these different names.&lt;ref name="Who Are the Kran"&gt;{{cite journal|last =Holsoe|first =Svend E.|authorlink =|author2=Lauer, Joseph J. |title =Who Are the Kran/Guere and the Gio/Yacouba?

== History ==

The Krahn arrived in the area known as Liberia previously known as the "Grain Coast" as part of early sixteenth century migrations from the north-east  and what is now the [[Ivory Coast]].&lt;ref name="MRG"&gt;{{Citation|last =Minority Rights Group International|author-link =Minority Rights Group International|title =Liberia Overview|year =2005|url = http://www.minorityrights.org/5235/liberia/liberia-overview.html|accessdate =17 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This migration occurred due to pressure on local populations resulting from an emigration of Western Sudan tribes after the decline of medieval empires, as well as an increase in regional tribal wars.&lt;ref name="Liberia Past and Present"&gt;{{Citation
|last =van der Kraaij|first =Fred P.M.|author-link =|title =The Open Door Policy of Liberia – An Economic History of Modern Liberia|place =Bremen|publisher =Im Selbstverlag des Museums|year =1983|pages =1–5|url =http://www.liberiapastandpresent.org/Peppercoastbefore1822.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this timeframe, the African slave trade was becoming more prominent within Liberia. Although some Kru tribes faced capture by Westerners, it was more common for the Krahn and other coastal peoples in Liberia to serve as local traders, brokering deals within the Western slave market. The Kru were so opposed to slavery within their own tribe members that many committed suicide rather than face enslavement.&lt;ref name="Liberia Past and Present" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

=== Liberian Civil Wars ===

During the late 1970s Liberia faced a heated civil war in which opposition to the [[Americo-Liberian]] and [[William R. Tolbert Jr.|Tolbert]] government, led to a military coup, organized in part by indigenous tribal members. The culmination of this coup came on April 12, 1980 when Krahn leader, [[Samuel Doe|Master Sergeant Samuel Kanyon Doe]] seized power, becoming the first native leader and Head of State.&lt;ref name="Mackinlay&amp;Alao"&gt;{{cite journal|last =Mackinlay|first =John|authorlink =|author2=Alao, Abiodun |title = Liberia 1994: ECOMOG and UNOMIL Response to a Complex Emergency|journal =Occasional Paper Series 2|publisher =United Nations University|location =Tokyo, Japan|year =1995|url = http://archive.unu.edu/unupress/ops2.html|accessdate =17 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; With a Krahn leader serving as a key political figure, the once disparaged and "uncivilized" Krahn were now given a place of honor within Liberia’s governing body.&lt;ref name="MRG" /&gt; This rise in status led to many Krahn speakers moving from coastal and inland areas to the capital, [[Monrovia]]. In time, Doe began showing favoritism to the Krahn, particularly to those from his own tribal group. These measures included appointing members of the Krahn’s  ethnic kin in Ivory Coast, known more commonly as the Wee, to the Executive Mansion Guard, as well as taking steps to prevent non-Krahn individuals from reaching key government positions.&lt;ref name="MRG" /&gt;

By 1985 Doe’s fierce response to his opposition created a large contingent of “anti-Doe” supporters.&lt;ref name="Mackinlay&amp;Alao"/&gt; In December 1989, exiles and local recruits began organizing military groups, resulting in another civil war, this time against Doe and his Krahn supporters. As this war progressed, the [[National Patriotic Front of Liberia]] (NPFL) began attacking Krahn civilians in [[Nimba County|Nimba]] and [[Grand Gedeh County|Grand Gedeh]] Counties, destroying entire communities as they moved through the country.&lt;ref name="MRG" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mackinlay&amp;Alao"/&gt; By mid-1990, the war had escalated, prompting foreign intervention. Unfortunately for Doe, this intervention was not to play in his favor, culminating in his kidnapping and execution by opposition forces. Following the removal of the [[Samuel Doe|Doe]] regime, and the continuation of the [[civil war]], Krahn refugees began fleeing from Liberia to Ivory Coast, some taking the Krahn language with them. It was during this time that the sarpo, who are a member of the Krahn Speaking Group, begin to call themselves Sarpo because of fear, but Sarpo is one of the krahn Speaking group.&lt;ref name="Mackinlay&amp;Alao" /&gt;

Although Doe was removed from power in 1990, the civil war did not officially reach its end until 1996, at which time [[Charles Taylor (Liberian politician)|Charles Taylor]] ran for presidency, winning the [[Liberian general election, 1997|1997 general election]] amidst much controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/07/world/in-ruined-liberia-its-despoiler-sits-pretty.html | work=The New York Times | first=Norimitsu | last=Onishi | title=In Ruined Liberia, Its Despoiler Sits Pretty | date=7 December 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; This presidency was not well received by all groups however, and the Krahn were among the ethnic groups targeted by Taylor because of their affiliation with Doe's regime and rebel groups such as [[United Liberation Movement of Liberia for Democracy|ULIMO]] that were opposed to him. In 1998, Taylor attempted to murder one of his political opponents, the former [[warlord]] [[Roosevelt Johnson]], causing [[1998 Monrovia clashes|clashes]] in Monrovia during and after which hundreds of Krahn were massacred, and hundreds more fled the country. This event was one of the factors that led to the [[Second Liberian Civil War]]'s outbreak.{{sfn|Dwyer|2015|pp=112-114}}{{sfn|Lidow|2016|p=108}} In 2003, members of the Krahn tribe founded a rebel group, the [[Movement for Democracy in Liberia]] (MODEL), as a means of fighting against Taylor. With the end of the second civil war, the group disbanded as part of the peace agreement.&lt;ref name="MRG" /&gt;

=== Recent history ===
Today Liberia’s government is far more stable, which has in turn allowed the Krahn to resettle throughout the nation. Present day Krahn are typically found within Nimba, and the Grand Gedeh and [[Sinoe County|Sinoe]] Counties, as well as Ivory Coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last =Lewis|first =Paul M. (Ed.)|author-link =|title =2009. Ethnologue: Languages of the World |place =Dallas, TX|publisher =SIL International|year =2009|edition = 16th|url =http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=liberia| accessdate =16 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Culture ==

The Krahn in Liberia were originally hunters, farmers, and fishermen, traditionally focusing on rice and cassava production. The land in this region has faced developmental setbacks and as a result, many of the younger Krahn generations have migrated to areas such as Monrovia.&lt;ref name="MRG" /&gt; The Wee in Ivory Coast also traditionally became hunters, farmers, and fishermen, but they tended to focus more heavily on crops such as "rice, yams, taro, [[manioc]], maize, and bananas."&lt;ref name="ALA"&gt;{{Citation|last =University of Iowa|author-link =University of Iowa|title =We Information|year =1998|url = http://www.uiowa.edu/~africart/toc/people/We.html|accessdate =17 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the Krahn in Liberia, the Wee traditions of hunting and farming have faced some difficulties, and in more recent years many have instead begun laboring in diamond camps and on rubber plantations.&lt;ref name="ALA" /&gt;

=== Early political structures ===
[[File:Face mask by Wee people.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A Wee face mask designed to look like a leopard. On display at the Indianapolis Museum of Art|[[Face mask (We people)]] on exhibit at the [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]].'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last =The Indianapolis Museum of Art|first =|author-link =Indianapolis Museum of Art|title =Face Mask|year =2012|url =http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/face-mask--46| accessdate =11 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Early Krahn political organization was traditionally decentralized in both Liberia and Ivory Coast.&lt;ref name="MRG" /&gt; The tribes often lacked a central governing power, instead turning to a village "headman" who rose to a position of social esteem through skill, hard work, and luck in hunting and farming. These individuals often formed councils consisting of young warriors for protection and village elders to serve as consultants in village affairs. This governing group would broker trades with neighboring tribes, as well as make important decisions for the tribe members.&lt;ref name="ALA" /&gt; Within these tribal groups, it was not uncommon for [[Face mask (We people)|ceremonial face masks]] to serve dual roles in rituals and politics. These masks were often modeled after fearsome animals and were utilized in community mediations. They may also have been a means of implementing social control in the years prior to adoption of Western laws during the [[Africa#Colonialism and the .22Scramble for Africa.22|colonial period]].&lt;ref name="Odyssey Online"&gt;{{Citation|last =Michael C.

=== Religion ===

Many Krahn believe that objects have spirits or souls ([[animism]]). An example of this is seen in several Kru artifacts found in 1979 near [[Maryland County]], Liberia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.liberiapastandpresent.org/culture2.htm |title=Ritual object or 'Kru money'? |work=Liberia Past and Present |accessdate=19 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although scholars are not certain of their origins and intended use, some sources believe that the Kru saw these objects as living entities typically found in small bodies of water such as rivers and creeks. Called 'tien','nitien' or 'Dwin,' these artifacts would have been viewed as water spirits or 'Gods of water.'&lt;ref name="Siegmann"&gt;{{cite web
 |author=van der Kraaij, Fred P.M. |title=Ritual object or 'Kru money'? |website=Liberia Past and Present |url=http://www.liberiapastandpresent.org/culture2.htm |access-date=17 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, it is believed that powers associated with these beings included healing, fertility, and the ability to end conflict and create new villages. The Kru also thought that a town or village could gain protection from one of these water guardians if they were caught in the water and carried into town.&lt;ref name="Siegmann" /&gt;

[[File:KrahnMask.jpg|thumb|alt=A wood carved, Krahn face mask on display at the National Museum of African Art |[[KrahnMask|Mask from the Krahn peoples]] currently on exhibit at the [[National Museum of African Art]] in [[Washington, DC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last =National Museum of African Art|first =|author-link =National Museum of African Art|title =Krahn Mask|year =2008|url =https://www.flickr.com/photos/nostri-imago/2922765203/| accessdate =17 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]According to the Wee of Ivory Coast, it is also believed that the natural world is made up of spirits, referred to as “bush spirits.”&lt;ref name="ALA" /&gt; These spirits are part of the world untouched by man, and the Wee believe that keeping these spirits appeased is vital to the health of the tribe. Whenever new land requires cultivating for fields or expansion, or when tribesmen needed to venture outside the village, it becomes necessary to make offerings to the spirits, with such endeavors being surrounded by an air of danger. It is further believed that the bush spirits take corporeal form in order to interact with the villagers and participate in ceremonies.&lt;ref name="ALA" /&gt; The Wee feel that the bush spirits can communicate with humans through dreams, often demanding ceremonial masks be created in their honor in either male or female forms. These masks then serve a variety of functions ranging from ritual ceremonies, forms of entertainment, and focal points in moral stories to judicial and political controls. Typically, female masks are viewed as less imposing and more beautiful than male masks and are in turn used more for ritual and entertainment purposes, while the male masks are often more ferocious-looking and serve roles in sociopolitical issues. That said, all Wee masks are believed to deflect sorcery attacks, and many undergo shifts in their primary function during their lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last =Curnow|first =K.|author-link =|title =African Art|year =n.d.|url =http://www.oberlin.edu/amam/IvoryCoast.htm| accessdate =17 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language==

Krahn is one of the [[Kru language]]s which belongs to the [[Niger–Congo languages|Niger–Congo language family]]. Although many Kru-speaking tribes have adopted English as their second language, recent studies have shown that Kru is still spoken by many Liberians. Within the Kru language there are several subcategories, with Eastern and Western Kru offering the first significant division of tribal language breakdowns. This [[Kru languages#Subgroups and associated languages|Kru language chart]] clearly shows that Krahn falls under the Western Kru, [[Guere language|Wee]] subgroup. Some scholars further denote a difference between Eastern and Western Krahn, with Eastern variations typically spoken in northeast Liberia and Western Krahn spoken throughout Grand Gedeh County and Ivory Coast. As of 1993, there were approximately 47,000 Eastern Krahn speakers within Liberia, with an additional 47,800 Western Krahn speakers in Liberia and 12,200 in Ivory Coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last =Grimes|first =Barbara F.|author-link =|title =Ethnologue|publisher =Summer Institute of Linguistics, Inc|year =1996|edition =13th|url =http://www.christusrex.org/www3/ethno/Libe.html| accessdate =17 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Paliyas belonging to Mistris of Kutch at Dhaneti.jpg|thumb|''[[Paliya]]''s belonging to war heroes of Mistris of Kutch, standing at [[Dhaneti]] dating back to 1178 AD]]

The community is believed to be from [[Kota, Rajasthan|Kota]]&lt;ref name=ks/&gt; and first entered into Saurashtra and founded 36 villages in the area, while others moved further into Kutch. Around 1177–78 AD ([[Vikram Samvant|VS]] 1234), a major group migrated to Kutch from Saurashtra&lt;ref name=ks/&gt; under the leadership of Patel Ganga Maru. They settled in the village of [[Dhaneti]].&lt;ref name=D&gt;Kumar Ganti Itihass (History of Kumar Gnati) Published in year 1896.&lt;/ref&gt; There are several [[Paliya|Paria]]s of the community, located near village pond of Dhaneti, standing as memorials of the war that was fought in 1178 AD. The community members still go once every year to offer [[Puja (Hinduism)|pooja]] and their respects to their fore-fathers.&lt;ref name=dh&gt;{{cite news|title=ધાણેટી ખાતે કચ્છ ગુ.ક્ષ. સમાજ...(Pooja held at Dhaneti by Kutch Gurjar Kshatriya for their Shurapura &amp; Dada)|url=http://www.kutchmitradaily.com/article.aspx?site_id=3&amp;news_id=17476|accessdate=9 July 2013|newspaper=Kutch Mitra Daily|date=23 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This group, later, made their distinct identity not only by building historical forts, palaces, temples and architects in Kutch but also all over British India, primarily in the fields of railways and coal mining.&lt;ref name=Shambles&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.expressindia.com/news/ie/daily/20010312/ina12017.html |title=In the shambles of Pride of Kutch lies priceless art |publisher=Expressindia.com |date=2001-03-12 |accessdate=2013-09-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121220074425/http://www.expressindia.com/news/ie/daily/20010312/ina12017.html |archivedate=20 December 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kutch Gurjar Kshatriyas left Dhaneti and went on to establish eighteen villages in Kutch&lt;ref name=ks/&gt; which were granted to them by the King: [[Anjar, India|Anjar]], [[Sinugra]], [[Khambhra]], [[Nagalpar]], [[Khedoi]], [[Madhapar]], [[Hajapar]], [[Kukma]], [[Galpadar]], [[Reha]], [[Vidi]], [[Jambudi]], [[Devaliya]], [[Lovaria]], [[Nagor]], [[Meghpar(Anjar)|Meghpar]], [[Chandiya]] and [[Kumbharia]].&lt;ref name=PP/&gt;

Over the centuries, they have been known or identified by names like Mistri, Mistry, Mistris of Kutch, Kutchi Contractor, Kadia, Kadia Kshatriyas, [[Gurjar Kshatriya Kadia]], Kumar Gnati, Kutch Gurjar Kshatirya, Kutch Gurjar Kshatriya Samaj, KGK Samaj, Kgk community, etc.&lt;ref name=M/&gt;

==Culture==
They are a Hindu community. Some are followers of [[Swaminarayan]] and [[Pranami]] sect of Hinduism, They are vegetarian in diet and avoid consumption of alcohol. The staple food is [[khichdi]], vegetables, pulses and [[Butter milk|butter-milk]].&lt;ref name=gj1/&gt;

The community consists of clans like [[Rathod]], [[Chauhan]], [[Yadav]], [[Chawda]], [[Jethwa]], [[Padhiar]], [[Yadav]], [[Chudasama]], [[Parmar]], [[Taunk]], Khodiyar, [[Solanki (clan)|Solanki]], [[Sarvaiya|Sawaria]], Vaghela, Vegad, Varu, [[Maru (surname)|Maru]], [[Bhalsod]], etc., who enjoy same status. However, most of people prefer to pre-fix Mistri to their name.&lt;ref name=gj1/&gt;

The community  are an [[endogamy|endogamous]] community who practice the principle of clan [[exogamy]]. [[Dowry]] is generally not asked for, neither practice of [[bride price]] is there in community. Divorce is generally not encouraged; however, divorce can be claimed in certain cases.&lt;ref name=gj1/&gt;

Betrothal ceremony generally precedes marriage, which is held usually within one year of engagement and marriage is observed as per Hindu rites by [[Saptapadi|taking seven circumambulation of fire]].&lt;ref name=gj1/&gt;

Widow remarriage (''ghargenu'') is allowed, where the women is usually married outside husband's family.&lt;ref name=gj1/&gt;&lt;ref name=nm&gt;Article on Widow Re-marriage (custom of Ghar-gharana) prevalent in Samaj by Nanji Mulji Chauhan of [[Kurnool]]. (Samaj Sandesh: 1996 August Page 12)&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Kutch==
[[File:Chabutro Sinugra.jpg|thumb|A [[Chabutro]] built by Seth Khora Ramji Chawda in year 1900 standing at village Sinugra, shows the unique architect and skill of Mistris of Kutch. Such huge Chabutra are rare to be found in whole of India]]
The Kutch Gurjar Kshatriyas were master craftsmen, architects and contractors and have played a major role in erection and construction of the majority of forts, palaces and architecture of Kutch. It was because of this they came to be known as Mistri in Kutch.&lt;ref name=ks/&gt;

==Indian railways==
{{main|Kutch Gurjar Kshatriyas contributions to the Indian railways}}

It was during 1850 to 1930 AD that the KGK migrated outside Kutch and were involved in the construction of major rail-bridges and the laying down of railway tracks in almost all major rail routes of undivided British India doing the "Railway Thekedari" ([[Railway]] [[Contractors]] also ''Thikadari'') and as [[Contractors|Thekedar]] (or Thikadar) in [[Irrigation]] projects and Forest Department and Public Works Department.&lt;ref name="RR"&gt;[http://kgksamaj.org/about Shri K. G. Kshatriya Samaj is a small Gujarat based community of around 50,000 people. The K.G.K. community is known for its commitment to hard work and initially made its presence felt as a contractors in Railways, Road, Forest and Construction.]&lt;/ref&gt; They have also done major roadway, road bridges, canal works, irrigation dams and barrage work throughout [[British India]] from 1850 to 1980. The communities largest contribution is in the building of the early railway lines and bridges throughout British India. Their works in Railway construction span from 1850 to 1980 for more than one and a quarter of century.

==Docks, dams and canals in British India==

The KGK contributed to the building of docks, dams, barrages and irrigation canals between 1850 and 1980,{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} and they in the eighteenth century had been among the communities who built the first [[Bombay Port Trust|ports of Bombay]] and [[Hornby Vellard]]. Other docks were developed in Bombay during 1870–1895 (Prince's Docks built in 1885 and Victoria Docks built in 1891&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Thomas Gatten, TNN 13 December 2008, 04.29am IST |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2008-12-13/mumbai/27945763_1_victoria-docks-port-cities-harbour |title=Prince's and Victoria docks in state of decay |publisher=Articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;) in which many Mistris of Kutch and Kadia Kshatriyas of Saurahstra worked.

In 1883 the Mandvi Port Docks and a bridge over the [[Rukmavati River]] at [[Mandvi]] were built by Vishram Karman Chawda of [[Chandiya]]. It is the longest stone bridge of its kind in India.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

==Mining==

===Coal mining===

In the regions of British India known as [[Bengal]], [[Bihar]] and [[Orissa, India|Orissa]], the Kutch Gurjar Kshatriyas pioneered Indian involvement in coal mining from 1894. They broke the previous monopolies held by British and other Europeans, establishing many collieries at locations such as [[Jharia Khas|Khas Jharia]], [[Jamadoba]], [[Baliari|Balihari]], [[Tisra]], [[Katras]]garh, [[Kailudih]], Kusunda, [[Gobindpur, Jharkhand|Govindpur]], [[Sijua]], [[Sijhua]], [[Loyabad]], [[Dhaunsar|Dhansar]], [[Bhuli, India|Bhuli]], [[Bermo]], [[Mugma]], [[Chas]]nala-[[Bokaro Steel City|Bokaro]], [[Bhagatdih|Bugatdih]], [[Chhotaputki|Putki]], [[Chirkunda]], [[Bhowrah]], [[Sahnidih|Sinidih]], [[Kenduadih|Kendwadih]], and [[Dumka]].&lt;ref name=Y&gt;''Diary of Golden Days at Jharia&amp;nbsp;– A Memoir and History of Gurjar Kashtriya Samaj of Kutch in Coalfields of Jharia''&amp;nbsp;– written by Natwarlal Devram Jethwa of Calcutta (1998).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=U-P9Us_wFsHIrQeb7oCIDw&amp;id=rbNHAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=gujarati+dhanbad+coal+railway&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=expert+contractor|title=Census of India, 1981: Bihar.

[[Seth Khora Ramji Chawda]] of Sinugra was the first Indian to break the British monopoly in the Jharia Coalfields.&lt;ref name=Y/&gt;&lt;ref name=K&gt;Encyclopedia of Bengal, Bihar and Orissa by British Authority (1920)&lt;/ref&gt; Natwarlal Devram Jethwa says that {{quote|The East Indian Railway in 1894-95 extended its line from [[Barakar]] to [[Dhanbad]] via [[Katras]] and [[Jharia]]. Messrs.

The location of his three collieries named [[Jeenagora]], Khas Jherria, Gareria is mentioned also in 1917 Gazetteers of Bengal, Assam, Bihar and Orissa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/bengalassambehar00playuoft/bengalassambehar00playuoft_djvu.txt |title=Gazetteers of Bengal, Assam, Bihar and Orissa 1917 Khora Ramji Colliries |publisher=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Other Indian communities followed the example of the KGK in the Dhanbad-Jharia-Bokaro fields after the 1930s. These included the [[Punjabi people|Punjabis]], [[Kutchi people|Kutchis]], [[Marwaris]], [[Gujarati people|Gujaratis]], [[Bengali people|Bengali]]s and [[Hindustani people|Hindustani]]s. Encyclopaedia of Bengal, Bihar and Orissa -1920 mentions:- "Out of 92 collieries belonging to [[Gujarati people|Gujarati]]s in [[Jharia]] Coalfields Area during 1920s - 50 belonged to [[Mistri|Mistris of Kutch]] with Seth Khora Ramji as Head of them all." Seth Khora Ramji of Sinugra was also honored by King of Kutch by giving him a ''[[Turban|Paghdi]]''.&lt;ref name=Y/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=4T97TMuXDsLQcZSR0KgG&amp;ct=result&amp;id=CbmyAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=khora+ramji+jharia&amp;q=khora+ramji+#search_anchor |title=Khora Ramji Mines capsized in 1938 |publisher=Books.google.co.in |date= |accessdate=2013-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_BcsAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=khora+ramji&amp;dq=khora+ramji&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=RN3PTLaqCYqgvQOy-vCJBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwBA |title=Jharia Coalfields: Khora Ramji, Narayan Chowra, etc |publisher=Books.google.co.in |date= |accessdate=2013-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''India at a Glance: A comprehensive reference book on India'' by T.

==Downturn in fortunes==
The majority of the once-prosperous KGK community living in Kutch and Saurashtra today are devoid of agricultural land and have been included in the list of Socially and Educationally Backward Class community in Gujarat. Those who migrated from the state cannot take advantage of this reservation.&lt;ref name=gjs/&gt;&lt;ref name=M/&gt;

==Present status==

===Distribution in India===
KGK community members are found throughout India, notably near to the major rail routes and junctions associated with the work of their forebears.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} Communities exist in the states of Gujarat, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Rajasthan, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Bihar, Orissa and West Bengal.&lt;ref name=PP&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chawra.com/kgk/samiti.htm |title=Pradeshik Samiti and Ghatak of KGK |publisher=Chawra.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social organization and activities in present times===
KGK associations exist today in various Indian states,&lt;ref&gt;Rethinking Indian culture: challenges and responses by Sitakant Mahapatra, Harish Chandra Das, Abhiram Biswal, Institute of Oriental and Orissan Studies - 2001- Page 32&lt;/ref&gt; and there are meetings and events organised at local, state and national level. These include match-making events, called ''Sagpan-Sanmmelan'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.indiainfo.com/article/100222082002_c-83-129754/879875.html Kutch Gurjar Kshatriya Samaj, Pune: Sagpan Sanmelean Press Report dated 22 February 2009] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110617023643/http://news.indiainfo.com/article/100222082002_c-83-129754/879875.html |date=17 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the traditional dispute resolution by elected community elders continues with the ''[[Panch]]''. There is an annual gathering in Kutch, their native state and their national President is elected every three years by way of voting.&lt;ref name=e/&gt;&lt;ref name=gj1/&gt;

They also have a woman's wing called ''Mahila Mandal'' at state and national level. Every three years a woman president is also elected by ladies of the community. The woman's wing works independently and in co-operation with the president of the community. The national level women's body of Kutch Gurjar Kshatriyas is called ''Akhil Bharatiya Kutch Gurjar Kshatriya samaj Mahila Mandal''.&lt;ref&gt;Indian Anthropologist - Volumes - 1966- 26-28 - Page 44&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Trading Community of India: An Anthropological Study of Ethnicity by Nilakantha Panigrahi, Premananda Panda, Premanatha Panda (anthropologist.)- 2000 - Page 188&lt;/ref&gt; The woman president of this wing then appoints her working committee members. The ''Mahila Mandal'' was founded in 1976 and first ''Mahila Mandal'' ''Pramukh'' or President of Women's Wing of Kutch Gurjar Kshatriyas was elected.&lt;ref name=e/&gt; In 1996 the community elected a woman to be ''Mahasabha Pramukh'', or President of the community.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

Similarly, they also have a youth wing at state and national organizational levels called All India Kutch Gurjar Kshatriya Samaj ''Yuva Mahamandal''. The young generation helps in organizing major national and state level events and the youths also organize a sports event every three years called ''Kutchyad'',&lt;ref name=ky/&gt; taking cue and inspiration from the [[Asian Games|Asiad]] of [[1982 Asian Games]]. The event also coincides with Dance, Music and match-making event.&lt;ref name=ky&gt;{{cite news|title=જબલપુરમાં કચ્છ ગુર્જર ક્ષત્રિય સમાજની ક્રિકેટ ટીમ ચેમ્પિયન..

Every year a mass-marriage event is also held called ''Samuh-Lagna'' where the marriages of financially weak families or couples are held with blessings and financial co-operation of the whole community. The first such event by the community was held on 10 May 1966, with six marriages at [[Dhanbad]] and later on a larger scale in 1972 at [[Raipur]]. It continues to be held every year since then at different locations in India.&lt;ref name=db/&gt;

===Religious customs and beliefs in present days===
Community members are still carrying forward the religious customs and beliefs embedded in them since many centuries ago and continue to follow Hindu religious customs. They are still followers of different sects of Hinduism.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

The newly wed couple come at least once to bow to their [[Kuldevta|Kuldevi]] at the temples which are located in the eighteen villages in Kutch founded by their ancestors. The newly weds also go and offer their respects at the ''[[Hero stone|Parias]]'' of their ''[[Sati (practice)|Sati]]s'' and ''[[Shurapura]]s'' located in Kutch.&lt;ref name=dh/&gt;

There is a custom to offer special prayers and [[Puja (Hinduism)|pooja]] called ''Kar'' to their Kuldevis whenever a boy is born in the family.  {{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

===Present day identity===
Other than being referred to as the Kutch Gurjar Kshatriya, the terms "KGK Community" or "Kgk Samaj" are more often used acronyms for the community in present-day India at a national level. "Mistri", which was mostly used during the last century and before is nowadays only used in Kutch and Gujarat. However, the Other Backward Class Certificate as per the ''[[Bakshi Panch]]'' report are given in the name of the Mistri only.&lt;ref name=gjs/&gt;&lt;ref name=M/&gt;

[[Albania]] is an ethnically homogeneous country, where the overwhelming majority of the population speaks [[Albanian language|Albanian]], which is also the official language. It has two distinct dialects: [[Tosk]], spoken in the south, and [[Gheg]], spoken in the north. However many [[Albanians]] speak [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[English language|English]] amongst other languages too, due to the high numbers of Albanian diaspora and Albanian communities throughout the Balkans.

Albania is one of the most polyglot nations in Europe.&lt;ref name="Gloyer"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gloyer|first=Gillian|title=Albania: the Bradt travel guide|year=2008|publisher=Bradt Travel Guides|location=Chalfont St. Peter|isbn=9781841622460|edition=3rd|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Albanians at home, in the region and around the world speak more than two languages. [[Italian language|Italian]] is widely spoken throughout Albania. [[Greek language|Greek]], the language of the Greek minority of the south, is also very widespread in that region. Nowadays, knowledge of [[English language|English]] is growing very rapidly, especially among the youth. Various languages are spoken by ethnic minorities: [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]], etc.

The Article 14 of the [[Albanian Constitution]] states that ''"The official language in the Republic of Albania is Albanian."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Constitution of the Republic of Albania |url=http://www.km.gov.al/skedaret/1231927768-Constitution%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Albania.pdf |publisher=Republic of Albania Council of Ministers |accessdate=12 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120808194737/http://www.km.gov.al/skedaret/1231927768-Constitution%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Albania.pdf |archivedate= 8 August 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
According to the 2011 population census, 2,765,610, 98.767% of the population declared [[Albanian language|Albanian]] as their mother tongue ("mother tongue is defined as the first or main language spoken at home during childhood").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://census.al/Resources/Data/Census2011/Instat_print%20.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-06-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112022139/http://census.al/Resources/Data/Census2011/Instat_print%20.pdf |archivedate=2012-01-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dialects===
Standard Albanian is based in the [[Tosk]] dialect, spoken in the south. [[Gheg]] is spoken in the north and also by [[Kosovo Albanians]]. The traditional border between the two dialects is the [[Shkumbin]] River. Although they are somewhat different, they are mutually intelligible.&lt;ref name="Baker"&gt;{{cite book|last=Baker|first=Colin|title=Encyclopedia of bilingualism and bilingual education|year=1998|publisher=Multilingual Matters|location=Clevedon|isbn=9781853593628|author2=Jones, Sylvia Prys |page=412}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Baker"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dana|first=Leo Paul|title=Economies of the Eastern Mediterranean region : economic miracles in the making|year=2001|publisher=World Scientific|location=Singapore [u.a.]|isbn=9789810244743|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable varieties, all of which are sub-dialects of Tosk, include  [[Cham Albanian dialect|Cham]],  [[Arbereshe language|Arbereshe]] spoken in Italy and [[Arvanitic]] in Southern Greece.

[[Greek language|Greek]] is the largest minority language of Albania and first largest foreign language.

In addition, many Albanians have knowledge of Greek, mainly due to past immigration to Greece. Greek is co-official in numerous municipalities and regions in Southern Albania.

[[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]] is mostly spoken and understood in northern Albania, near the border of former Yugoslavian countries of Serbia and Montenegro.&lt;ref name="Gloyer"/&gt; The television phenomenon of Italian also happened to Serbo-Croatian, but to a lesser extent.&lt;ref name="Hemming"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hemming|first=Andreas|title=Albania: family, society and culture in the 20th century|year=2010|publisher=LIT|location=Münster|isbn=9783643501448|page=183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foreign languages==
The most-widely foreign languages spoken in Albania are English, Italian and Greek.

A new study carried out by [[Eurostat]], the statistical agency of the [[European Union]], analyzed the demography of the adult population 25-64 of several european countries as of 2016. The results of the Adult Education Survey, released in May 2018, showed that the 39.9 % of the 25-64 years old is able to use at least one foreign language. The main foreign language known is English with 40.0%, followed by Italian with 27.8% and Greek with 22.9 %. The English speakers were mostly young people, the knowledge of Italian is stable in every age group, while there is a decrease of the speakers of Greek in the youngest group. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.instat.gov.al/media/4028/adult-education-survey-2017.pdf|title=Press release of the Adult Education Survey|last=|first=|date=10 May 2018|work=Albanian Institute of Statistics|access-date=23 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italian===
[[Italian language|Italian]] is by far the best-known foreign language in Albania and used to have official status when the country was a protectorate of Italy.&lt;ref name="Gloyer"/&gt;  Most Italian-speakers have not learnt the language in classrooms or from books, but rather by watching Italian television.&lt;ref name="Hemming"/&gt; During the late [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania|communist regime]], Albanians living in the towns along the [[Adriatic Sea]] coast had access to Italian television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pardo-de-Santayana|first=Manuel|title=Ethnobotany in the new Europe : people, health, and wild plant resources|year=2010|publisher=Berghahn Books|location=New York|isbn=9781845454562|edition=1. publ.|author2=Pieroni, Andrea |author3=Puri, Rajindra K. |page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many Albanians "grew skilled at rewiring their TVs to overcome [the] Albanian government's attempt to block Italian channels".&lt;ref name="McAdam"&gt;{{cite book|last=McAdam|first=Marika|title=Western Balkans|year=2009|publisher=Lonely Planet|location=Footscray, Vic.|isbn=9781741047295|edition=2nd |author2=Jayne d' Arcy |author3=Chris Deliso |author4=Peter Dragicevic|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large number of middle-aged and younger people grew up with the language and know it very well.&lt;ref name="Gloyer"/&gt;

Among the elderly, Italian is also common as the language was used in the educational system in the 1930s, after [[Zog of Albania|King Zog]] released a decree requiring all Albanian schools to teach Italian in 1933.{{sfn|Rista-Dema|2006|p=14}}

Albania also is home to 19,000 ethnic Italians, who have aided the growth of the language in the country.

===English===
[[English language|English]] is mostly popular among the younger generations of Albanians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vorhees|first=Mara|title=Eastern Europe.|year=2009|publisher=Lonely Planet|location=Footscray, Vic.|isbn=9781741048544|edition=10th|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Albania Company Laws and Regulations Handbook|year=2008|publisher=Int'l Business Publications|isbn=9781433069338|author=IBP USA Staff, International Business Publications, USA|page=228}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1990s it is the most-taught foreign language in the Albanian educational system. As of 2006, more than 65% of Albanian children could speak fluent or semi-fluent English.{{sfn|Rista-Dema|2006|p=16}}

The language came to Albania in 1921, when the Albanian Vocational School started to teach English with the sponsorship of the [[American Red Cross]]. The school operated until 1933.{{sfn|Rista-Dema|2006|p=14}} The [[Principality of Albania|Albanian Government at the time]] decided to make English the country's second language.{{sfn|Rista-Dema|2006|p=12}} Russian became the major language taught in schools after the Communists took control over the country. After the [[Soviet-Albanian Split]] in the 1960s, English came to compete with Russian.{{sfn|Rista-Dema|2006|p=14}} A 2006 book by Mimoza Rista-Dema, a Ph.D. in Linguistics at [[Indiana University]], describes the teaching of English during the communist era:
{{cquote|Although English was taught at schools, it was considered the language of Western imperialism and as a result, elements of its culture and civilization were offered to English learners selectively.{{sfn|Rista-Dema|2006|p=15}}}}

===Other===
French [[lycées]] in [[Korçë]] and [[Gjirokastër]] operated during the communist era, because long-time leader of [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania|Communist Albania]], [[Enver Hoxha]] studied in the [[University of Montpellier]] in France and upon his rise to power allowed their activity. Albania is a member of [[la Francophonie]]. Most French-speakers in Albania can be found in these two towns and surrounding areas, but also elsewhere in the country.&lt;ref name="Gloyer"/&gt; According to La Francophonie, Albania is home to 300,000 French speakers.

[[Russian language|Russian]] began to be taught in schools and universities in the 1950s, when it was ''[[lingua franca]]'' of the [[Eastern Bloc]] countries, part of which was Albania.{{sfn|Rista-Dema|2006|p=14}} It continued until the [[Soviet–Albanian split]] in early 1961. Many who learnt in at the time, have forgotten most of it due to lack of usage.&lt;ref name="Gloyer"/&gt;

After the ideological controversies with the USSR, [[Socialist People's Republic of Albania#Albania and China|Albania and China became closer]]. A number of Albanians studied in China and learnt Chinese there. After the [[Fall of communism in Albania|collapse of communism in Albania]] in 1991, many young Albanians also traveled to China for education and learned the language.&lt;ref name="Gloyer"/&gt;

[[Burkina Faso]] is a [[multilingual]] country. An estimated 70 languages are spoken there, of which about 66 are [[indigenous language|indigenous]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=BF Lewis, M. Paul (ed.), 2009. Ethnologue: Languages of the World, Sixteenth edition. Dallas, Tex.: SIL International.] (Page on "Languages of Burkina Faso.")&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mossi language]] ({{lang-mos|Mòoré}}) is spoken by about 40% of the population, mainly in the central region around the capital, Ouagadougou. [[French language|French]] is the official language. English is also widely spoken.

In the west, [[Mande languages]] are widely spoken, the most predominant being [[Dyula language|Dyula]] (also spelled Jula or Dioula), others including [[Bobo language|Bobo]], [[Samo language (Burkina)|Samo]], and [[Marka language|Marka]]. The [[Fula language]] ({{lang-ff|fulfulde}}, {{lang-fr|peul}}) is widespread, particularly in the north. The [[Gourmanché language]] is spoken in the east, while the [[Bissa language]] is spoken in the south.&lt;ref name="dict"/&gt;

Education for the deaf in Burkina uses [[American Sign Language]], which was introduced by the deaf American missionary [[Andrew Foster (educator)|Andrew Foster]]. The [[Burkina Sign Language]] is used in Ouagadougou.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Diane|last=Brentari |title=Sign Languages |year=2010 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|page=406|isbn=1139487396}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==French language==
The [[official language]] is [[French language|French]], which was introduced when France colonized Burkina Faso in 1919. French is the principal language of administrative, political and judicial institutions, public services, and the press. It is the only language for laws, administration and courts. French is the language of instruction in the nation's schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kone|first1=Aame|title=Politics of Language: The Struggle for Power in Schools in Mali and Burkina Faso|journal=International Education|date=2010|volume=39|issue=2|page=7|url=http://trace.tennessee.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1171&amp;context=internationaleducation|accessdate=24 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, fewer than 15 percent of the population uses French on a day-to-day basis.&lt;ref name=kone9/&gt; Despite this low percentage, there is a high amount of support in keeping French as the language of instruction because it provides children a pathway to social mobility and assures continued economic support for education.&lt;ref&gt;Kone 2010, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, according to a 1998 report, “Burkinabe saw no interest in sending their children to school to learn a language that they already spoke at home”.&lt;ref&gt;Kone 2010, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

French is one of 13 languages used on the radio.&lt;ref name="baker"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baker|first1=Colin|last2=Jones|first2=Sylvia|title=Encyclopedia of Bilingualism and Bilingual Education|date=1998|publisher=Multilingual Matters|isbn=1853593621|page=356}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==National languages==
The [[Mossi language]], also known as Móorè, is the most widely spoken language in the country, with 48 percent of Burkinabes being speakers as of 2008.&lt;ref name=kone9&gt;Kone 2010, page 9&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dyula language|Dyula]] and [[Fulfulde]] are also recognized as national languages. This has caused consternation with speakers of the other languages, who have protested it as an injustice.&lt;ref name=kone10&gt;Kone 2010, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

The country's name was taken from words in two of the most widely spoken languages, with ‘Burkina’ meaning ‘men of integrity’ in Mossi and ‘Faso’ meaning ‘father’s house’ in Dyula.

Fulfulde is the [[lingua franca]] in many parts of Burkina Faso.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fulfude, Moore &amp; Dioula|url=http://www.nalrc.indiana.edu/brochures/Ffulfude_Burkina-Faso.pdf|website=National African Language Resource Center|publisher=[[Indiana University]]|accessdate=24 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is widely spoken in the north and east of the country as a first language, with 8.36 percent of the population able to speak it.&lt;ref name="dict"/&gt;&lt;ref name=census&gt;[http://www.burkinafaso-cotedazur.org/documents/documents/demographie/Tableau-langues-2006%20.pdf Language census form] Burkina Faso Government&lt;/ref&gt; Dyula is also a lingua franca and is widely used as a trading language.&lt;ref name="dict"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rupley|first1=Lawrence|last2=Bangali|first2=Lamissa|last3=Diamitani|first3=Boureima|title=Historical Dictionary of Burkina Faso|date=2013|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=0810867702|page=123}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, 4.4% of the population were able to speak Dyula.&lt;ref name=census/&gt;

Most of the languages that are spoken belong to either the [[Mande languages|Mande]] or [[Gur languages|Gur]] branches. In rural areas of Burkina Faso, one's native language is typically used for common activities.&lt;ref name="dict"/&gt; In large towns, most people are multilingual.&lt;ref name="baker"/&gt; Although not recognized as a national language, [[Gourmanché language|Gourmanché]] is spoken by 5.51% of the population.

{{Lebanese people}}

'''Lebanese Canadians''' are [[Canadians]] of [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] origin. According to the [[Canada 2011 Census|2011 Census]] there were 190,275 [[Canadians]] who claimed [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]] ancestry, having an increase compared to those in the 2006 Census,&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; making them by far the largest group of people with [[Arabic language|Arabic-speaking]] roots.

Lebanese immigration began in 1882.The first Lebanese immigrant to Canada was Abraham Bounadere (Ibrahim Abu Nadir) from [[Zahlé]] in Lebanon. He came and settled in Montreal. Because of situations within [[Lebanon]] and restrictive [[Canada|Canadian]] laws these immigrants were 90% [[Christianity in Lebanon|Christian]]. These [[immigrants]] were mostly economic migrants seeking greater prosperity in the [[New World]].

In more recent years this pattern has changed, and large numbers of Lebanese [[Islam in Lebanon|Muslim]]s and [[Druze in Lebanon|Druze]] have come to Canada. [[Immigration]] laws were liberalized after the [[Second World War]], and immigration steadily increased in the 1950s and 1960s.

The greatest influx of Lebanese was during the [[Lebanese Civil War]] (1975-1990), and this period saw a number of Lebanon's wealthiest and best educated move to Canada to flee the violence in their homeland. [[Canada]] and [[Australia]] were the only [[Western world|western countries]] to set up special programs to enable Lebanese to more easily emigrate. Canada set up an office in [[Cyprus]] to process Lebanese refugees.

Many Lebanese speak [[French language|French]] and preferred to settle in [[francophone]] [[Montreal]] rather than [[English Canadian|anglophone]] [[Toronto]] and [[Vancouver]], British Columbia. About half the Lebanese-Canadian community is located in and around Montreal, and most Lebanese-Canadian organizations, especially religious ones, are based in that city.

Lebanese Canadians account for a larger share of the population of [[Ottawa]] than that of any other census metropolitan area across the country, constituting over 2% of the total population of the [[National Capital Region (Canada)|National Capital Region]]. Canadians of Lebanese origin also made up more than 1% of the total populations of both [[Montreal]] and [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]], while the figure was close to 1% in both Calgary and Edmonton. In [[Toronto]], people of Lebanese origin made up less than a half a per cent of the total population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/89-621-x/89-621-x2007015-eng.htm|title=The Lebanese Community in Canada|author=|date=|website=www.statcan.gc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also substantial Lebanese populations in [[Vancouver]], [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]], [[London, Ontario|London]], [[Edmonton]], [[Fredericton]] and [[Charlottetown]].

Media reported that as many as 50,000 of Lebanese-Canadians were in Lebanon during the summer of 2006, with about half this number permanently residing there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/middleeast-crisis/canada-lebanon.html ''Canada and Lebanon, a special tie''] from ''[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]]'' 1 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  During [[2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict]] the large number of Canadians led rise to a major effort to evacuate them from the war zone. It also led some pundits to accuse some of those holding Canadian citizenship of being ''[[Canadians of convenience]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="85852">This article contains a list of freedom indices produced by several [[non-governmental organization]]s that publish and maintain assessments of the state of [[Freedom (political)|freedom]] in the world, according to their own various definitions of the term, and rank countries as being free, partly free, or using various measures of freedom, including civil liberties, political rights and economic rights.

==Prominent indices==
The indices and their origins.
*[[Canada]]
** The '''[[Economic Freedom of the World Index]]''' is a report published by Canada-based [[Fraser Institute]] in conjunction with the Economic Freedom Network, a group of independent research and educational institutes in 90 nations and territories worldwide. It is a numeric index, and its results are not currently included in the table below.
*[[Canada]], [[United States]], [[Germany]]
** The '''Human Freedom Index''' presents the state of human freedom in the world based on a broad measure that encompasses personal, civil, and economic freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cato.org/human-freedom-index |title=Human Freedom Index|website=www.cato.org/human-freedom-index|accessdate= September 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The index presents a broad measure of human freedom, understood as the absence of coercive constraint. It uses 79 distinct indicators of personal and economic freedom. The index covers the following areas: Rule of Law, Security and Safety, Movement, Religion, Association, Assembly, Civil Society, Expression, Relationships, Size of Government, Legal System and Property Rights, Access to Sound Money, Freedom to Trade Internationally, and Regulation of Credit, Labor, and Business. The Human Freedom Index was created in 2015, covering 152 countries for years 2008–2012. The Human Freedom Index 2016 was published in November 2016, covering 159 countries for years 2008–2015. The report is co-published by the [[Cato Institute]], the [[Fraser Institute]], and the Liberales Institut at the [[Friedrich Naumann Foundation for Freedom]]. Co-authors of the report are Ian Vásquez and Tanja Porčnik.
** The '''[[Index of Freedom in the World]]''' was a predecessor to the '''Human Freedom Index'''. It measured classical [[civil liberties]] and was published in 2013 by Canada's [[Fraser Institute]], Germany's Liberales Institute, and the U.S. [[Cato Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/09/world-freedom-index-2013_n_2440620.html |title=World Freedom Index 2013: Canadian Fraser Institute Ranks Countries |author=Craggs, Ryan |work=Huffington Post|date= January 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not currently included in the table below.
*[[France]]
** '''[[Worldwide Press Freedom Index]]''', is published each year since 2002 (except that 2011 was combined with 2012) by France-based [[Reporters Without Borders]]. Countries are assessed as having a ''good situation'', a ''satisfactory situation'', ''noticeable problems'', a ''difficult situation'', or a ''very serious situation''.&lt;ref name=RWBPFIndex&gt;[http://index.rsf.org/#!/ "Press Freedom Index 2018"], Reporters Without Borders, April 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Spain]]
** The '''[[World Index of Moral Freedom]]''' was first published on April 2, 2016 by the Foundation for the Advancement of Liberty, based in [[Madrid]], [[Spain]]. This index ranks 160 countries by five categories of indicators: religious freedom, bioethical freedom, drugs freedom, sexuality freedom and family and gender freedom. The index aims at establishing the degree of individual freedom or state control on decisions pertaining to the great moral debates of our time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fundalib.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/World-Index-of-Moral-Freedom-web.pdf World Index of Moral Freedom 2016], published by the Foundation for the Advancement of Liberty&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Sweden]]
** '''MaxRange''', developed by Max Rånge, and maintained by Mikael Sandberg and Max Rånge, political scientists at [[Halmstad University, Sweden]], is a data set defining a country's level of democracy and institutional structure (regime-type) on a 1000-point graded scale. Values are sorted based on level of democracy and political accountability. MaxRange defines the value corresponding to all states every month from 1789 to the present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hh.se/english/schoolofeducationhumanitiesandsocialsciences/research/maxrange.65441985_en.html |title=MaxRange: Analyzing political regimes and democratization processes|publisher= School of Education, Humanities and Social Sciences, Halmstad University |location=Sweden|date= April 30, 2015|accessdate= May 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[UK]]
** The '''[[Democracy Index]]''', published by the U.K.-based [[Economist Intelligence Unit]], is an assessment of countries' democracy. Countries are rated to be either ''Full Democracies'', ''Flawed Democracies'', ''Hybrid Regimes'', or ''Authoritarian regimes''. Full democracies, flawed democracies, and hybrid regimes are considered to be democracies, and the authoritarian nations are considered to be dictatorial. The index is based on 60 indicators grouped in five different categories measuring pluralism, civil liberties, and political culture.&lt;ref name=DI&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.eiu.com/public/topical_report.aspx?campaignid=DemocracyIndex12  |title=Democracy index 2012: Democracy at a standstill |publisher=Economist Intelligence Unit |date=14 March 2013 |accessdate=24 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[US]]
** The '''[[CIRI Human Rights Data Project]]''' measures a range of human, civil, women's, and workers' rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humanrightsdata.org/ |title=CIRI Human Rights Data Project|website=humanrightsdat.org|accessdate= October 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was created in 1994 and is now hosted by the [[University of Connecticut]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://today.uconn.edu/blog/2010/12/annual-international-human-rights-ratings-announced/| author= Michael Kirk| title=Annual International Human Rights Ratings Announced| publisher=University of Connecticut| date=December 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its 2011 report, the U.S. was ranked 38th in overall human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://humanrightsdata.blogspot.jp/| title=Human Rights in 2011: The CIRI Report| publisher=CIRI Human Rights Data Project| date=August 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** '''[[Freedom in the World]]''', published each year since 1972 by the U.S.-based [[Freedom House]], ranks countries by political rights and [[civil liberties]] that are derived in large measure from the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].  Countries are assessed as ''free'', ''partly free'', or ''unfree''.&lt;ref name=FreedomInTheWorld/&gt;
** [[Freedom of the Press (report)|'''Freedom of the Press''']] is a report published each year since 1980 by [[Freedom House]].
** The '''[[Index of Economic Freedom]]''' is an annual report published by [[The Wall Street Journal]] and the U.S.-based [[Heritage Foundation]].  Countries are assessed as ''free'', ''mostly free'', ''moderately free'', ''mostly unfree'', and ''repressed''.&lt;ref name=IEF&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heritage.org/index/ranking |title=Country Rankings|work=2018 Index of Economic Freedom|author=Heritage Foundation|date= 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** The U.S.-based '''[[Polity data series]]''' is a widely used data series in [[political science]] research. It contains coded annual information on regime authority characteristics and transitions for all independent states with total populations greater than 500,000 and covers the years 1800–2006. Polity's conclusions about a state's level of democracy are based on an evaluation of that state's elections for competitiveness, openness, and level of participation. Data from this series is not currently included in the table below. The Polity work is sponsored by the [[Political Instability Task Force]] (PITF) which is funded by the U.S. [[Central Intelligence Agency]]; however, the views expressed in the reports are the authors' alone and do not represent the views of the U.S. Government.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

'''Occupy Buffer Zone''' (OBZ) was a [[Protest|protest movement]] that began on October 15, 2011 by [[Greek Cypriots|Greek Cypriot]] and [[Turkish Cypriots|Turkish Cypriot]] activists, in the [[Ledra Street|Ledra/Lokmacı]] checkpoint, in [[Nicosia]], [[Republic of Cyprus|Cyprus]].&lt;ref name="hurriyetdailynews1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/default.aspx?pageid=438&amp;n=youths-occupy-buffer-zone-in-bid-to-reunify-cyprus-2011-11-29 |title=Youths occupy buffer zone in bid to reunify Cyprus |publisher=[[Hurriyet Daily News]] |date=2011-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement began with a weekly occupation of the checkpoint, which is located in the [[United Nations Buffer Zone in Cyprus|buffer zone]] that divides the island's territory and capital into the self-declared [[Northern Cyprus|Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]] and the [[Republic of Cyprus]] since the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus]] in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Nov 15 |url=http://stream.aljazeera.com/story/cypriots-occupybufferzone-0021865 |title=Cypriots #OccupyBufferZone &amp;#124; The Stream - Al Jazeera English |publisher=[[Aljazeera]] |date=2004-04-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130408031105/http://stream.aljazeera.com/story/cypriots-occupybufferzone-0021865 |archivedate=April 8, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 19 of 2011 the occupation of the buffer zone became permanent.&lt;ref name="hurriyetdailynews1"/&gt;

Influenced by the global [[Occupy Movement]], Occupy Buffer Zone aimed to protest and publicise the problems of the global economic and political system, as well as to raise awareness of how "the [[Cyprus Problem]] is but one of the many symptoms of an unhealthy global system".&lt;ref name="wordpress1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://occupythebufferzone.wordpress.com/about/obz/ |title=Occupy Buffer Zone « OCCUPY THE BUFFER ZONE |publisher=[[WordPress]] |work=Occupy the Buffer Zone |date= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130724030705/http://occupythebufferzone.wordpress.com/about/obz/ |archivedate=July 24, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement emphasised the connection between the development of the Cyprus problem and the economic and political interests associated with the international economic and political [[status quo]].

==Occupy Buffer Zone's general statement==
The following text is the movement's general statement that was distributed to passers by in the buffer zone.

"This is an inclusive movement functioning within some principal umbrella concepts for which we initially united, these are:

-The [[reunification of Cyprus]].

-To raise awareness of how the Cyprus Problem is but one of the many symptoms of an unhealthy global system.

It is important to elaborate on the intended inclusiveness of the last point.

We have occupied the space of the buffer zone to express with our presence our mutual desire for reunification and to stand in solidarity with the wave of unrest which has come as a response to the failings of the global systemic paradigm. We want to promote understanding of the local problem within this global context and in this way show how the Cyprus Problem is but one of the many symptoms of an unhealthy system. In this way, we have reclaimed the space of the buffer zone to create events (screenings, talks etc.) and media of these events, which relate to the system as a whole and its numerous and diverse consequences.
Opinions expressed in this manner are not necessarily of the entire group, only the umbrella points of reunification and solidarity with the global movement can be assumed to be."&lt;ref name="wordpress1"/&gt;

==Development==
The movement began on  15 October 2011 with a weekly occupation of the buffer zone in Ledra/Lokmacı street in Nicosia. Greek and Turkish Cypriot activists had gathered in [[Eleftheria Square]] in Nicosia as a response to the global call for a protest on the [[15 October 2011 global protests|15th of October]]. Through discussion they decided to move the occupation from the Eleftheria Square to the buffer zone located in the Ledra/Lokmacı street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theoccupiedtimes.co.uk/?p=2636 |title=Occupy Buffer Zone |publisher=[[The Occupied Times]] |date= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120410034542/http://theoccupiedtimes.co.uk/?p=2636 |archivedate=April 10, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The buffer zone was occupied subsequently on the 22nd and the 29th of October and the 5th of November.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theoccupiedtimes.co.uk/?p=2636 |title=Occupy Buffer Zone |publisher=The Occupied Times |date= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120410034542/http://theoccupiedtimes.co.uk/?p=2636 |archivedate=April 10, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
On the 19th of November activists set up [[tents]] and made camp in the buffer zone for the night.&lt;ref name="hurriyetdailynews1"/&gt; The decision was then taken that the occupation would become permanent.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;
On 1 January 2012 the activists further occupied the abandoned buildings that were located in the buffer zone. The buildings have been used by the movement for its [[cultural]] and [[political]] activities, such as hosting and developing various [[Academic conference|workshops]] and the movement's [[General assembly (Occupy movement)|General Assemblies]].
The [[United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus|United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP)]] asked the activists to leave the buffer zone on 14 January 2012 claiming that the occupation did not meet United Nations' regulation for activities in the buffer zone,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.cyprus-mail.com/cyprus/un-asks-occupy-protesters-vacate-ledra-street-site/20120114 |title=UN asks Occupy protesters to vacate Ledra Street site |publisher=[[Cyprus Mail]] |date=2012-01-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120417233335/http://www.cyprus-mail.com/cyprus/un-asks-occupy-protesters-vacate-ledra-street-site/20120114 |archivedate=April 17, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but it did not employ any forceful methods for the evacuation of the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.cyprus-mail.com/cyprus/un-denies-evacuation-threat/20120115 |title=UN denies evacuation threat |publisher=Cyprus Mail |date=2012-01-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313184320/http://www.cyprus-mail.com/cyprus/un-denies-evacuation-threat/20120115 |archivedate=March 13, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
After the Police raid on 6 April 2012, the movement's activities and organisation began to fade. By June 2012, the occupation of the buffer zone was essentially over.

On 6 April 2012, a strong [[Cyprus Police|police]] force from the [[Republic of Cyprus]] gathered in the area occupied by the activists and raided the occupied buildings at around 10:15pm. The operation included the anti-terrorist department and the anti-drug department of the police force.&lt;ref name="cyprus-mail1"&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.cyprus-mail.com/cyprus/tensions-high-after-police-raid/20120408 |title=Tensions high after police raid |publisher=Cyprus Mail |date=2012-04-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120409131952/http://www.cyprus-mail.com/cyprus/tensions-high-after-police-raid/20120408 |archivedate=April 9, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.cyprusedirectory.com/cyprusguide/cyprus.aspx?ID=24851 |title = Police raid on peace movement nets one gramme of cannabis |publisher = Cyprus e Directory  |accessdate= 25 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Policemen, equipped with [[guns]], [[helmets]] and [[Baton (law enforcement)|batons]] smashed the door and entered the building.&lt;ref name="politis-news1"&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.politis-news.com/cgibin/hweb?-A=217887&amp;-V=articles |title=ΠΟΛΙΤΗΣ ONLINE - Γκαγκστερική επιχείρηση (video) |publisher=Politis-news |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A sequence of screaming and sounds of smashing and breaking followed.&lt;ref name="politis-news1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cyprus-mail2"&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.cyprus-mail.com/police-raid/police-raid-peace-movement-nets-one-gramme-cannabis/20120407 |title=Police raid on peace movement nets one gramme of cannabis |publisher=Cyprus Mail |date=2012-04-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120611044721/http://www.cyprus-mail.com/police-raid/police-raid-peace-movement-nets-one-gramme-cannabis/20120407 |archivedate=June 11, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The police reported that it made 28 arrests, including 11 minors and that it had confiscated 1 gram of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]].&lt;ref name="cyprus-mail1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cyprus-mail2"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2888">'''Usmani''' or '''Osmani''' or '''Othmani''' or '''Uthmani''' ({{Lang-ar|عثمانی}}) is a large community ({{lang-ur|Biradari}}), found mainly in [[South Asia]]. The word '''Usmani''' or '''Osman''' (one and the same thing) is a surname.  Osmani are found throughout [[South Asia]], and have spread across [[Afghanistan]], [[Pakistan]], [[India]] and [[Bangladesh]].

==Osmani==
The Osmani are a [[Urdu]] speaking community, and many are found among the [[Sindhi people|Sindhi]]s of Pakistan. They are of Arab origin and descendants of third Islamic Caliph Usman Dhul Noorayn (famously known as [[Uthman ibn Affan]]). The word ''usmani'' derived from Usman Dhul Noorayn, companion, son-in-law of Muhammad and the third caliph of Islam.  One of the sub-continent's well known personalities Maulana [[Shabir Ahmed Usmani]] (Sheikh ul Islam) belongs to this origin. They claim that they came in India with [[sufi]] [[fakir]] Khwaja Muinuddin Chisti .

==Turk Usmani==
They claim to have Turk ancestry and are found mainly in North-West India and Pakistan.They include the descendants of [[Karlugh Turks]] who came with Taimur in 1398-1399.They live in Hazara region and Kashmir regions of Pakistan.

==Usmani of Bilgram==
Ale Usman of Bilgram, a historical town in Awadh region in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh are the direct decedents of son-in-law of Muhammad and third Islamic Caliph Usman a through his grand son Abdullah Akbar bin Amr Bin Usman  and from maternal side to the fourth Islamic Caliph and son-in-law of Muhammad, Ali through her grand daughter Fatimah Sughra bint Husain. they came to India from a small town of Kazroon (Ghazroon) in the Fars province of modern-day Iran. They first migrated to Herat in Afghanistan and from there they came to India with the army of Mahmood Ghaznavi in eleventh century AD. After conquering Bilgram in 1018 AD Qazi Yusuf Ghazrooni served as the first Qazi of Bilgram appointed by Mahmood Ghaznavi. Ale Usman of Bilgram holds the title of Qazi-ul- Bilgram since that time barring brief interregnum where another esteemed faction of Farshori Sheikhs of Bilgram held the position of Qazi.

{{Template: English language}}
'''Pakistani English''' or '''Paklish''' is the group of [[English language]] varieties spoken and written in [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref&gt;McArthur, Tom, 1998. [http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O29-PAKISTANIENGLISH.html "Pakistani English."] in ''Concise Oxford Companion to the English Language''. Retrieved on 2009-06-06.&lt;/ref&gt; It was first so recognised and designated in the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref name="Hashmi1978, 1987"&gt;{{cite book| last =Hashmi| first =Alamgir| title =''Preface''. Pakistani Literature: The Contemporary English Writers| origyear =1978| year =1987| publisher =World University Service / Gulmohar Press| location =New York / Islamabad}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pakistani English (PE) is slightly different in respect to vocabulary, syntax, accent, spellings of some words and other features.

==History==
Although [[British rule in India]] lasted for almost two hundred years, the areas which lie in what is now Pakistan were amongst the last to be annexed: [[Sindh]] in 1843, [[Punjab]] (which initially included the [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|North-West Frontier Province]]) in 1849, and parts of [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Baluchistan]], including Quetta and the outer regions in 1879, while the rest of the Baluchistan region became a [[princely state]] within the [[British Indian Empire]]. As a result, English had less time to become part of local culture though it did become part of elite culture as it was used in elite schools and in higher education, as in the rest of British India.&lt;ref name="Rahman2002"&gt;{{cite book| last =Rahman| first =Tariq| title =Language, Ideology and Power: Language-learning among the Muslims of Pakistan and North India|year =2002| publisher =Oxford University Press| location =Karachi}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The colonial policies which made English a marker of elite status and the language of power—being used in such domains of power as the civil service, the officer corps of the armed forces, the higher judiciary, universities, prestigious newspapers, radio and entertainment—was due to British policies&lt;ref name="Rahman1996"&gt;{{cite book| last =Rahman| first =Tariq| title =Language and Politics in Pakistan| year =1996| publisher =Oxford University Press| location =Karachi}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|22–58}} and the continuation of these policies by [[Pakistani Government|Pakistani government]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s.&lt;ref name="Rahman2002"/&gt;{{rp|288–323}} In 1947 upon Pakistan's establishment, English became the de facto [[official language]], a position which was formalised in the [[Constitution of Pakistan]] of 1973. Together with [[Urdu]], the two languages are concurrently the official [[Languages of Pakistan|languages of the country]]. English language continues as the language of power and is also the language with the maximum [[cultural capital]] of any language used in Pakistan.&lt;ref name="Rahman2007"&gt;{{cite book| last =Rahman| first =Tariq| title =Language Policy, Culture, and Identity in Asian Contexts| editor1-last =Tsui| editor1-first =Amy B.| editor2-last =Tollefson| editor2-first =James W.| year =2007| publisher =Lawrence Erlbaum| location =Mahwah, New Jersey| pages =219–239| chapter =The Role of English in Pakistan}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It remains much in demand in higher education in [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref name="Mansoor2005"&gt;{{cite book| last =Mansoor| first =Sabiha| title =Language Planning in Higher Education: A Case Study of Pakistan| year =2005| publisher =Oxford University Press| location =Karachi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship with Indian English==
{{See also|Indian English}}
Pakistani English (PE) shares many similarities with [[Indian English]], but since the [[independence of Pakistan]], there have been some very obvious differences. Rahman argues that PE is an [[language transfer|interference variety]] of English created by the use of the features of Urdu, Punjabi, Pashto, Sindhi and other languages spoken in Pakistan. He further divides PE into Anglicised English, which is very similar to the speech and writing of the speakers of British Standard English (BSE),  [[acrolect]] PE, which is used by Pakistanis educated in English-medium schools, mesolectal PE, which is used by ordinary, Urdu-educated Pakistanis and [[basilect]] PE, which is used by people of little formal education, such as guides and waiters.&lt;ref name="Rahman1990"&gt;{{cite book| last =Rahman| first =Tariq| title =Pakistani English: The linguistic description of a non-native variety of English| year =1990| publisher =National Institute of Pakistan Studies| location =Islamabad}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Words and expressions of PE have been noted by a number of scholars,&lt;ref name="Baumgardner"&gt;{{cite journal | last =Baumgardner| first =Robert | title =Utilising Pakistani Newspaper English to Teach Grammar | journal =World Englishes | volume =6 | issue =3 | pages =241–252 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-971x.1987.tb00204.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; including unique idioms and colloquial expressions as well as accents.&lt;ref name="Ecom"&gt;[http://www.ecommercetimes.com/story/37750.html Pakistan Now a Hot Spot for IT Outsourcing]&lt;/ref&gt; Foreign companies find accent neutralisation easier&lt;ref name="Ecom"/&gt; in Pakistan than in India. However, like Indian English, Pakistani English has preserved many phrases that are now considered antiquated in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.guardian.co.uk/print/0,3858,4464765-110738,00.html How the Woosters captured Delhi – Shashi Tharoor]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in Pakistan==
Urdu and English are Pakistan's official languages. All government documents, many street signs, many shop signs, business contracts and other activities use English. The language of the courts is also English.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.supremecourt.gov.pk//judgment.htm A judgment of the Supreme Court.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120231122/http://www.supremecourt.gov.pk//judgment.htm |date=20 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

English is taught to all school-level Pakistani students, and in many cases the medium of instruction is also in English. Although there are also many schools that teach in the local languages, there is a huge emphasis on English as a second language especially in standardised testing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.multilingual-matters.net/jmmd/018/0145/jmmd0180145.pdf Multilingual-matters.net]&lt;/ref&gt; At college and university level, all instructions are typically in English.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uelowermall.edu.pk/pdfs/research_paper_02.pdf UElowermall.edu.pk] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910040106/http://www.uelowermall.edu.pk/pdfs/research_paper_02.pdf |date=10 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pakistan boasts a large English language press and (more recently) media. All of Pakistan's major dailies are published in or have an edition in English, while [[DAWN News]] was a major English Language News Channel, before 15 May 2010 when it switched to its language to [[Urdu]], [[Express 24/7]] was another important English news channel, now defunct. [[Code-switching]] (the concurrent use of more than one language, or language variety, in conversation) is common in Pakistan and almost all conversations in whatever language have a significant English component.
The language of pleading in all courts of Pakistan is also English.

==Literature==
{{main|Pakistani English literature}}

==Grammar==
The role of English within the complex multilingual society of Pakistan is far from straightforward: it is used across the country by speakers with various degrees of proficiency; the grammar and phraseology may mimic that of the speaker's first language. While Pakistani speakers of English use idioms peculiar to their homeland (often literal translations of words and phrases from their native languages), this is far less common in proficient speakers, and grammar tends to be quite close to that of [[Standard English]] but exhibiting some features of [[American English]].

==Phonology==
Pakistani English phonology follows that of [[British English]]. It may be [[rhotic and non-rhotic accents|rhotic or non-rhotic]]. Rahman provides a broad introduction to the phonology of Pakistani English.&lt;ref name="Rahman1990"/&gt;{{rp|21–40}}

==Influences==
Pakistani English is heavily influenced by Pakistan's languages as well as the English of other nations. Many words or terms from Urdu, such as 'cummerbund', have entered the global language and are also found in Pakistan. In addition the area which is now Pakistan was home to the largest garrisons of the British Indian Army (such as Rawalpindi and Peshawar) and this, combined with the post-partition influence of the [[Pakistan Military]], has ensured that many military terms have entered the local jargon.&lt;ref name="Rahman1990"/&gt;{{rp|76–78}}

The type of English taught (and preferred) is [[British English]]. The heavy influence and penetration of American culture through television, films and other media has brought in great influences of American English.

===Vocabulary and colloquialisms===
Pakistani English contains many unique terms,{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} as well as terms which are utilised somewhat differently in Pakistan.{{dubious|date=December 2011}}. For instance, "chips" is used for [[potato chip]]s as well as for [[French fries]] and "lemon" is used for both lime and lemon.&lt;ref name="Rahman1990"/&gt;{{rp|69–71}}
* "''Uncle / Aunty''" – Respectful way of addressing anyone who is significantly older than oneself: "Uncle, please give way".
* Use of ''double'' and ''triple'' for numbers occurring twice or three times in succession, especially for a phone number: for example, a phone number 2233344 would be pronounced as ”double two, triple three, double four”; however the phone number 2222555 would  be pronounced as ”double two, double two, triple five”.
* ''Shopper'' means a shopping bag, rather than a person who is shopping, the latter is referred to as a customer.
* ''Petrol Pump'' — This term used to refer to a gas station.
* ''Opening/closing an object'' refers to turning something on or off; this is due to the verbs for to open and to close being the same as the verbs for to turn on and to turn off in [[Urdu]] and other Pakistani languages.
* ''Light Gone'' — This refers to the electric power outage from the electric supply company.
* ''Number''&amp;nbsp;— Often used in place of "marks" in an exam (used as both singular and plural without ''s'' while speaking in mixed English-Urdu).
* ''His/her meter has turned'' or ''-is high'' means that the person has lost his/her temper. Usually used for a sudden outburst, one which is construed as unreasonable.
* ''Got no lift'' — received no attention or assistance from someone.
* ''In-Charge'' — a casual as well as formal title given to unit, group or division heads.
* ''Same to same'' — an expression to indicate something is exactly the same to some other thing.
* ''On parade'' — being at work or at a set activity. Usually (though not always) in the context of starting something for the first time. For example, ''I have been hired by the company, on parade from next Monday''.
* ''Out of station'' — out of town
* ''Become a direct Sergeant'' — be promoted out of turn/ given responsibility and authority very early. Often in the context that a person is out of his/her depth. For example, ''no wonder that team has failed so badly, leader was a direct Sergeant''. Usually "Sergeant" is replaced by "Havildar" the equivalent rank in the [[Pakistan Army]]. Also used for upwardly mobile, ambitious or [[nouveau riche]].
* ''Miss'' is used to address or refer to female teachers, whatever their marital status, e.g. ''Yes, I have done my homework, Miss.'' Less commonly used to refer to women colleagues or subordinates.
* ''Madam'' is used to address and refer to females in positions of authority, usually a superior, e.g. ''Madam has ordered me to get the figures for last years sales.''Can also be used as a noun, e.g. ''She is the madam of that department'' meaning she is the head of the department, without it being derogatory.
* ''Sir'' is used for a male superior, often combined with their name or used as a noun. E.g. ''Is Sir in?'' or ''Sir Raza wants to see you in his office as soon as possible''.
* ''Well left'' — avoided artfully, often a tricky situation; from [[cricket]], the term "well left" is applied when a batsman chose not to play a potentially dangerous delivery, e.g. ''I well left that offer, it could have caused many problems.''
* ''Threw/Received a googly'' — an unexpected situation arose, a person was surprised, often unpleasantly, e.g. ''had just settled down and then got the googly about the transfer''. From [[googly]], a delivery in cricket.
* ''Yorker'' — a sudden, dangerous and potentially devastating situation; similar use to [[googly]], but usually has a certain amount of danger attached to it. ''My mother's heart attack while we were hiking in the mountains hit like a [[yorker]], we were far from any medical help''. Also used in a similar manner; ''[[Bouncer (cricket)|bouncer]]''. All three terms are derived from actual [[cricket]] deliveries, cricket being a popular sport in the country.
* ''Hit [[middle stump]]'' — did an action in such a manner that there is little room for further action, or a decisive blow, e.g. ''Really hit middle stump last year on that contract''. Also derived from cricket.
* ''Master Sahib'', contracted to ''Ma'Sahib'' — used to refer to a master craftsman. The term is now however used more frequently to refer to tailors and carpenters.
* ''Drinking a cigarette/cigar'' — smoking a cigarette. This is due to the verbs for smoking being the same as the verbs for drinking in [[Urdu]] and other Pakistani languages.
* ''Elder'' – used as a comparative adjective in the sense of ''older''. For example, "I am elder to you", instead of "I am older than you."
* ''Even'' – ''as well/also/too'': "Even I didn't know how to do it." This usage of ''even'' is borrowed from native grammatical structure.
* ''Graduation'' – completion of a bachelor's degree (as in the UK): "I did my graduation at Presidency College" ("I earned my [[bachelor's degree]] at Presidency College"), whereas in the United States it refers to completion of Highschool, Master's or PhD as well.{{dubious|date=December 2011}}
* ''Paining'' – ''hurting'' would be correct in Standard American and British: "My head is paining."
* ''Shirtings and suitings'' – the process of making such garments; a suffix in names of shops specialising in men's formal/business wear.
* ''Timings'' – hours of operation; scheduled time, such as ''office timings'' or ''train timings'', as opposed to the standard usage such as "The timing of his ball delivery is very good."
* ''[[Gentry]]'' – generalised term for social class&amp;nbsp;— not specifically 'high social class'. The use of 'good', 'bad', 'high' and 'low' prefixed to 'gentry' is common.
* ''[[mutton]]'' – [[goat meat]] instead of [[Lamb (food)|sheep meat]].

Words unique to (i.e. not generally well known outside [[South Asia]]) and/or popular in Pakistan include those in the following by no means exhaustive list:
* ''batchmate'' or ''batch-mate'' (not classmate, but a schoolmate of the same grade)
* ''compass box'' for a box holding mathematical instruments like compasses, divider, scale, protractor etc.; also widely referred to as a "geometry box"
* ''cousin-brother'' (male [[Cousin chart|first cousin]]) &amp; ''cousin-sister'' (female first cousin)

* ''flyover'' (overpass or an over-bridge over a section of road or train tracks)
* ''godown'' (warehouse)
* ''godman'' somewhat pejorative word for a person who claims to be divine or who claims to have supernatural powers
* ''gully'' to mean a narrow lane or alley (from the Hindi word "gali" meaning the same).
* ''long-cut'' (the opposite of ”short-cut”, in other words, taking the longest route).
* ''mugging/cramming'' or ''mugging up'' (memorising, usually referring to learning "by rote," as used in British English and having nothing to do with street crime, that the expression might also mean in British/American English).
* ''nose-screw'' (woman's nose-ring)
* ''[[wikt:prepone|prepone]]'' (The "opposite" of postpone, that is to change a meeting to be earlier). Many dictionaries have added this word.

===Numbering system===
The [[Indian Numbering System|Pakistani numbering system]] is preferred for digit grouping. When written in words, or when spoken, numbers less than 100,000 are expressed just as they are in Standard English. Numbers including and beyond 100,000 are expressed in a subset of the Pakistani numbering system. Thus, the following scale is used:

{| class="wikitable" border="1"
! In digits (Standard English) !! In digits (Pakistani English) !! In words (Standard English) !! In words (Pakistani English)
|-
| colspan="2" | 10 || colspan="2" | ten
|-
| colspan="2" | 100 || colspan="2" | one hundred
|-
| colspan="2" | 1,000 || colspan="2" | one thousand
|-
| colspan="2" | 10,000 || colspan="2" | ten thousand
|-
| 100,000 || 1,00,000 || one hundred thousand || one [[Lakh|lac/lakh]] (from lākh {{nq|لاکھ}})
|-
| 1,000,000 || 10,00,000 || one million || ten [[Lakh|lac/lakh]] (from lākh {{nq|لاکھ}})
|-
| 10,000,000 || 1,00,00,000 || ten million || one [[crore]] (from karoṛ {{nq|کروڑ}})
|-
| 1,000,000,000 || 1,00,00,00,000 || one billion || one {{not a typo|arab}} (from {{not a typo|arab}} {{nq|ارب}})
|-
| 100,000,000,000 || 1,00,00,00,00,000 || one hundred billion || one kharab (from kharab {{nq|کھرب}})
|}

Larger numbers are generally expressed as multiples of the above.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bsl.co.in/india/news/investors-lose-rs-44-lakh-crore-in-four-days/416306/ "Investors lose Rs 4.4 lakh crore in four days"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316003619/http://bsl.co.in/india/news/investors-lose-rs-44-lakh-crore-in-four-days/416306/ |date=16 March 2012 }}, Business Standard&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://smartinvestor.in/market/story-31563-storydet-Corporate_chiefs_getting_crores_in_salaries_100_and_counting.htm "Back Corporate chiefs getting crores in salaries: 100 and counting!"], SmartInvestor.in&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medical terms===
Often the cause of undesirable confusion.
* ''Viral Fever'': [[Influenza]]
* ''Sugar'': Diabetes
* ''Jaundice'': Acute Hepatitis. While standard medical terminology uses jaundice for a symptom (yellow discolouration of skin), in Pakistan the term is used to refer to the illness in which this symptom is most common.
* ''[[Allopathy]]'', used by homeopaths to refer to conventional medicine.

===Food===
* ''[[Brinjal]]'': [[aubergines]] / [[eggplant]]
* ''[[Capsicum]]'': called chili pepper, red or green pepper, or sweet pepper in the UK; capsicum in Australia, New Zealand, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and India; [[bell pepper]] in the US, Canada, and the Bahamas; and paprika in some other countries.
* ''Curds'': [[Yogurt]]
* ''Sooji'': [[Semolina]]
* ''Pulses'', ''[[dal]]'': [[pulses]], e.g. [[lentils]]
* ''Karahi'', ''[[kadai]]'': wok
* ''[[Sago]]'': [[tapioca]], Yuca in US
* ''Ladyfinger, bhindi'': [[okra]]
* ''Sabzi'': greens, green vegetables

[[File:Piccadilly Circus in Pea-Soup.jpg|thumbnail|right|Piccadilly Circus in Pea-Soup Fog, 1952, by John Hampton.]]
'''Pea soup fog''', or a '''pea souper''', also known as '''black fog''', '''killer fog''' or [[smog]] is a very thick and often yellowish, greenish, or blackish fog caused by [[air pollution]] that contains [[soot]] [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulates]] and the poisonous gas [[sulphur dioxide]]. This very thick smog occurs in cities and is derived from the smoke given off by the burning of [[soft coal]] for home heating and in industrial processes. Smog of this intensity is often lethal to vulnerable people such as the elderly, the very young and those with [[respiratory failure|respiratory problems]]. The result of these phenomena was commonly known as a '''London particular''' or '''London fog'''; in a reversal of the idiom, "London particular" became the name for a thick [[Pea soup|pea and ham soup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DiN8mA7CcaYC&amp;pg=PA101 |date=2004-10-01 |title=The London Companion |isbn=978-1-86105-799-0 |author=Jo Swinnerton |postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical observations==
From as early as the 1200s,&lt;ref&gt;P. Brimblecombe, "Industrial air pollution in thirteenth century Britain", Weather 30:388(1975).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Brimblecombe (1976) "Attitudes and Responses Towards Air Pollution in Medieval England", Journal of the Air Pollution Control Association, 26:10, 941-945, DOI: 10.1080/00022470.1976.10470341&lt;/ref&gt; air pollution became increasingly prevalent, and a predominant perception in the 13th century was that sea-coal smoke would affect one's health.&lt;ref&gt;Calendar of Close Rolls, 35 Ed. 1. m6d&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Calendar of Patent Rolls, 13 Ed. 1.ml8d.&lt;/ref&gt; From the mid-1600s, in U.K. cities, especially [[London]], the incidence of ill-health was attributed to coal smoke from both domestic and industrial [[chimney]]s  combining with the mists and fogs of the [[Thames Valley]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Citation   | title=Natural and political observations mentioned in a following index, and made upon the bills of mortality [microform] / by John Graunt ... ; with reference to the government, religion, trade, growth, ayre, diseases, and the several changes of the said city   | author1=Graunt, John, 1620-1674   | author2=Petty, William, Sir, 1623-1687   | year=1662   | publisher=Printed by Tho. Roycroft for John Martin, James Allestry, and Tho. Dicas   | language=English }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Luke Howard]], a pioneer in [[urban climate]] studies, published ''The Climate of London'' in 1818–20, in which he uses the term 'city fog' and describes the [[heat island]] effect which concentrated the accumulation of smog over the city.&lt;ref&gt;Landsberg, Helmut Erich (1981). ''The urban climate''. Academic Press, New York, p.3.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1880 Francis Albert Rollo Russell, son of the former [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Prime Minister Lord John Russell]], published a leaflet that blamed home hearth, rather than factory, smoke for damaging the city’s important buildings, depriving vegetation of sunlight, and increasing the expense and effort of laundering clothes. Furthermore, he charged the ‘perpetually present’ sulphurous smoke with increasing bronchitis and other respiratory diseases. More than 2,000 Londoners had ‘literally choked to death’, he wrote, on account of ‘a want of carefulness in preventing smoke in our domestic fires’ which emitted coal smoke from ‘more than a million chimneys’ that when combined with the prolonged fogs of late January and early February 1880, fatally aggravated pre-existing lung conditions and was ‘more fatal than the slaughter of many a great battle’.&lt;ref&gt;F. A. R. Russell, ''London Fogs''. London: Edward Stanford, 1880, pp. 4, 11, 27&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B. Luckin, "Demographic, Social and Cultural Parameters of Environmental Crisis: The Great London Smoke Fogs in the Late 19th and Early 20th Centuries", in C. Bernhardt and G. Massard-Guilbaud (eds) ''The Modern Demon: Pollution in Urban and Industrial European Societies''. Clermont-Ferrand: Blaise-Pascal University Press, 2002; pp. 219–38&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B. Luckin, "Pollution in the City", in M. Daunton (ed.) ''The Cambridge Urban History of Britain, Volume III 1840–1950''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000, pp. 207–28.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most lethal incidence of this smog in London [[Great Smog of London|occurred in 1952]] and resulted in the [[Clean Air Act 1956]] and [[Clean Air Act 1968]], both now repealed and consolidated into the [[Clean Air Act 1993]] which were effective in largely removing sulphur dioxide and coal smoke, the causes of pea soup fog, though these have been replaced by less visible pollutants that derive from vehicles in urban areas.&lt;ref&gt;Brimblecombe, P. (2006). "The clean air act after 50 years". ''Weather'', 61(11), 311-314.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins of the term ==
Reference to the sources of smog, along with the earliest extant use of "pea-soup" as a descriptor, is found in a report by [[John Sartain]] published in 1820 on life as a young artist, recounting what it was like to; &lt;blockquote&gt;"...slink home through a fog as thick and as yellow as the pea-soup of the eating house; return to your painting room [...] having opened your window at going out, to find the stink of the paint rendered worse, if possible, by the entrance of the fog, which, being a compound from the effusions of gas pipes, tan yards, chimneys, dyers, blanket scourers, breweries, sugar bakers, and soap boilers, may easily be imagined not to improve the smell of a painting room!" &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;John Sartain (1820). ''Annals of the fine arts''. London, Sherwood, Neely, and Jones, digitised by Moore College of Art, Philadelphia, p.80&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An 1871 ''[[New York Times]]'' article refers to "London, particularly, where the population are periodically submerged in a fog of the consistency of pea soup..." The fogs caused large numbers of deaths from respiratory problems.&lt;ref name="Imperial_2001"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/pls/portallive/docs/1/7294722.PDF |format=PDF |publisher=[[Imperial College]] Centre for Energy Policy and Technology |title=External Cost and Environmental Policy in the UK and the EU |date=June 2001 |isbn=1-903144-02-7 |page=18 |author=Fouquet, Roger|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

from; "[[s:Ballad of Gresham College|Ballad of Gresham College]]". Original text.&lt;/ref&gt; published in 1661, blaming coal, a "subterrany fuel" that had "a kind of virulent or arsenical vapour arising from it" for killing many. He proposed the relocation of industry out of the city and the planting of massive gardens of "[[wikt:odiferous|odiferous]] flowers" to "tinge the air" and thus mask the pollution.

===Clean Air Act===
The worst recorded instance was the [[Great Smog of London|Great Smog of 1952]], when 4,000 deaths were reported in the city over a couple of days, and a subsequent 8,000 related deaths, leading to the passage of the [[Clean Air Act 1956]], which banned the use of coal for domestic fires in some urban areas.&lt;ref name="Imperial_2001" /&gt; The overall death toll from that incident is now believed to be around 12,000.&lt;ref name="EHP_112_1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bell | first1 = Michelle L. | author2 = Michelle L.

==Cultural references==
In Chapter XXXIV of [[Thomas Love Peacock]]'s [[Melincourt (novel)|''Melincourt'']] (1817), the Reverend Mr. Portpipe tells his visitors that he has "good ale and a few bottles of London Particular." A footnote by David Garnett, editor of the 1948 edition, explains that this is "a Madeira wine imported for the London market and hence, from its colour, a London fog."

A first mention in fiction of 'pea-soup' as a description of fog appears in 1834; 'On the occasion of which now I am to speak, there was any thing but gaiety and mirth. It was a wretched morning; there fell a mizzling rain through the peas-soup atmosphere of London, which chilled every living thing, while a sort of smoky misty, foggy vapour, hovering over the ground, made "darkness only visible"', from Theodore Edward Hook (1834). ''Maxwell a novel''. London R. Bentley, p.&amp;nbsp;10

A second appears in 1839; "It was not, therefore, until he had left Italy, that Lord Cheveley felt his utter wretchedness and desolation: and London in December was not calculated to lessen it, as it only presents a pea-soup fog, which renders the necessary and natural process of respiration, almost what Dr. Johnson's idea of fine music ought to be, impossible!", in Lytton, Rosina Bulwer Lytton Baroness (1839). ''Chevely ; or, The man of honour''. E. Bull, London, Volume 2, page 106.

In Chapter 3 of [[Charles Dickens]]'s ''[[Bleak House]]'' (1852), when Esther arrives in London, she asks of the person meeting her "whether there was a great fire anywhere? For the streets were so full of dense brown smoke that scarcely anything was to be seen. 'O, dear no, miss,' he said. 'This is a London particular.'  I had never heard of such a thing.  'A fog, miss,' said the young gentleman."

The London satirical journal '[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]' (1860) outlines some venture capital schemes; "Besides a plan just set for making champagne out of cucumbers, a scheme has been devised for the extraction of pea-soup from London fog. When the foreigner remembers that our fogs are now so frequent that the clear blue sky in England is never clearly seen, he may form a faint conception of the work which is cut out for this Company of Soup Makers. The fog will daily furnish a lot of raw material, which English ingenuity will soon cook into a soup." Various &amp; Lemon, Mark [Editor] 'Facts for Foreigners', ''Punch, or the London Charivari'', Volume XXXVIII, February 18, 1860. p.&amp;nbsp;71

The [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] ''[[Sherlock Holmes]]'' stories describe London fogs, but contrary to popular impression the phrase "pea-soup" is not used; ''[[A Study in Scarlet]]'' (1887) mentions that "a dun-coloured veil hung over the house-tops."; ''[[The Adventure of the Bruce-Partington Plans]]'' (1912) describes "a dense yellow fog" that has settled down over London, and later notes "a greasy, heavy brown swirl still drifting past us and condensing in oily drops on the windowpane"; while in ''[[The Sign of the Four|The Sign of Four]]'' (1890), Holmes soliloquises; "What else is there to live for? Stand at the window here. Was ever such a dreary, dismal, unprofitable world? See how the yellow fog swirls down the street and drifts across the dun-coloured houses.", and, later; "...the day had been a dreary one, and a dense drizzly fog lay low upon the great city. Mud-coloured clouds hung over the muddy streets."

In the phrase "pea-soup fog," the implied comparison may have been to ''yellow'' pea soup:  "...the yellow fog hung so thick and heavy in the streets of London that the lamps were lighted" ([[Frances Hodgson Burnett]], ''[[A Little Princess]]'', 1892); "The yellow fog that rubs its back upon the window-panes," ([[T. S. Eliot]], ''[[The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock]]'', 1917); "London had been reeking in a green-yellow fog" ([[Winston Churchill]], ''A Traveller in War-Time'', 1918); "the brown fog of a winter dawn" ([[T. S. Eliot]], ''[[The Waste Land]]'', 1922); "a faint yellow fog" ([[Stella Benson]], ''This is the End''). Inez Haynes Irwin, writing in ''The Californiacs'' (1921), praises what was then the superior quality of California fog, saying it is "Not distilled from pea soup like the London fogs; moist air-gauzes rather, pearl-touched and glimmering."

''[[A Foggy Day]]'', originally titled ''A Foggy Day (In London Town)'', is a song composed by George and Ira Gershwin to set the mood for the 1937 film ''[[A Damsel in Distress (1937 film)|A Damsel in Distress]]''.

The fog plays a role in [[Michael Crichton|Michael Crichton's]] 1975 novel ''The Great Train Robbery'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Crichton, Michael | title=The Great Train Robbery | publication-date=1975 | publisher=Cape | isbn=978-0-224-01189-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;"On the evening of January 9th, a characteristic London “pea-soup” fog, heavily mixed with soot, blanketed the town. Clean Willy Williams, easing down Tooley Street, one eye to the façade of London Bridge Station, was not sure he liked the fog. It made his movements on the ground less noticeable, but it was so dense that he could not see the second story of the terminus building, and he was worried about access to the roof." (p.124).

In the animated television Christmas feature ''[[Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (TV special)|Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer]]'' (1964), the characters Rudolph, Hermey and Yukon Cornelius are travelling through a thick fog when the following exchange takes place: Yukon Cornelius: "This fog's as thick as peanut butter!" Hermey: "You mean pea soup." Yukon Cornelius: "You eat what you like, and I'll eat what I like!"

The second chapter of the book ''[[The Woman in Black]]'' (1983) by [[Susan Hill]] is titled "A London Particular" and mentions the thick, dense fog of London, which Arthur Kipps witnesses on his journey to work at his solicitors' office.

Sections of London Below in [[Neil Gaiman]]'s 1996 novel ''[[Neverwhere (novel)|Neverwhere]]'' are still affected by "pea soupers", remnants of the thick fog in London's past that got trapped in London Below and remained.

In the book ''[[Un Lun Dun]]'' (2007) by [[China Miéville]], the London Fog takes on the role of villain: the "Smog" of UnLondon. The Clean Air Act is misheard as the ''Klinneract''.

In "Act of God", Season 1, Episode 4 of the Netflix series ''[[The Crown (TV series)|The Crown]]'', the events of the 1952 fog-deaths and their political ramifications take up the whole of the episode.

''The Democratic Republic of the Congo'' is a country located in central Africa.

== Poverty ==
The [[Democratic Republic of Congo]](DRC) has one of the highest incidences of [[poverty]] in the world. And unfortunately it is still going on. DRC is #1 out of 11 top poor countries in the world (2014) At a rate of 71.34, its incidence of poverty is “extremely high”, even in comparison with other [[central Africa]]n countries. However, this poverty is not evenly distributed. The [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] estimates that poverty is more prevalent in [[Rural poverty|rural areas]] (75.72%) than in [[Urban poverty|urban areas]] (61.49%), while the provinces of [[Province of Équateur|Équateur]], [[Bandundu (province)|Bandundu]] and [[Sud-Kivu]] have a poverty incidence of over 85% compared to [[Kinshasa]]’s 42%.&lt;ref&gt;International Monetary Fund, “Democratic Republic of Congo: Poverty Reduction Paper,” ''IMF Country Report'', September (2007): 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Poverty in the Democratic Republic of the Congo|The DRC’s high incidence of poverty]] is partly attributable to the [[ethnic conflict]] that spilled over from neighboring [[Rwanda]] and an ongoing [[civil war]] between government troops and rebel groups in Eastern Congo. The sustained levels of [[violence]] have caused massive infrastructural damage, [[internal displacement]], and loss of property and lives. In 2007, the [[International Rescue Committee]] estimated that 5.4 million people had died from the war and that another 1,250 continue to die each day from [[war]]-related causes.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson,Simon.  “The Deadliest War in the World.” ''Time Magazine'', 28 May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kristof,Nicholas D. “Orphaned, Raped, Ignored.” ''The New York Times'', 30 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to reduce the levels of poverty in the country, the government embarked on IMF recommended reforms to improve its [[Macroeconomics|macroeconomic environment]], initiate policies to support [[economic growth]] as well as improve its provision of basic [[social services]]. While the results have been mixed, the IMF notes in its 2010 report that Congo’s [[economic governance]] has improved, over 22,000&amp;nbsp;km of roads have been completed and “significant progress” have been made in increasing [[primary school]] enrollment from 64.1% in 2004 to 84.3% in 2008 and reducing [[infant mortality]].&lt;ref&gt;International Monetary Fund, "Democratic Republic of Congo: Poverty Reduction Paper – Progress Report", ''IMF Country Report'', October (2010): 7-11.&lt;/ref&gt;



{{Main|Sexual violence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo}}
[[Sexual violence]] has characterised much of the violence perpetuated in Congo. Used as a tactic of war, the daily violations of women and children by armed groups have created a climate of [[fear]] and a reputation for the DRC as world’s “worst place to be a woman or a child”.&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Watch, “Soldiers Who Rape, Commanders Who Condone”, ''Human Rights Watch'', July (2009): 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Women from ages “six to eighty” have become victims and one statistic suggests that over 200,000 women may have been victimized over the past decade, while another notes that in some regions, as many as 40 women are [[rape]]d every day.&lt;ref&gt;Seymour,Lisa Ann. ''Collective Rape: The Continued Victimisation of Women in the International System''. Master's Thesis, Kent State University, 2010, 86-89.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, despite the massive scale of [[violence against women]] committed, the level of assistance that victims can expect in the form of [[medical care]] or post-traumatic counseling service is minimal{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=April 2014}} to the point of non-existence, especially if one considers that only three practicing [[gynecologist]]s serve [[North Kivu]], a province of over 800,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;Hartill, Lane. “Rape in Congo: Grim Statistics, Tender Lives.” Catholic Relief Services, {{cite web |url=http://crs.org/democratic-republic-of-congo/rape-counseling/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101215143132/http://crs.org/democratic-republic-of-congo/rape-counseling/ |archivedate=2010-12-15 |df= }} (accessed 20 February 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of the rape shelters in the DRC are operated by foreign or international [[non-governmental organization]]s. But despite this intervention by the international community, supply has been insufficient to meet demand.&lt;ref&gt;Bosmans,Marleen. “Challenges in Aid to Rape Victims: the Case of the Democratic Republic of Congo.” ''Essex Human Rights Review'', Vol. 4, no. 1 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to [[psychological trauma|psychological]] and [[Trauma (medicine)|physical trauma]], rape victims bear socio-economic costs. For instance, the families of raped women are only paid a [[dowry]] price of two goats, if at all, as compared to the typical price of 20 goats. Consequently, raped women are often abandoned by their husbands whilst raped girls have difficulty marrying.&lt;ref&gt;Kristof 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, in the context of the DRC’s [[Patriarchy|patriarchal society]], where women are dependent on men – first their fathers and later husbands – for economic support, their status as rape victims inevitably affects their economic well-being.

{{linguistics}}

In [[linguistics]], '''syntax''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɪ|n|t|æ|k|s}}{{refn|{{OxfordDictionaries.com|accessdate=2016-01-22|syntax}}}}{{refn|{{MerriamWebsterDictionary|=2016-01-22|syntax}}}}) is the set of rules, principles, and processes that govern the structure of [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentences]] in a given [[Natural language|language]], usually including [[word order]]. The term ''syntax'' is also used  to refer to the study of such principles and processes.&lt;ref name="Chomsky def"&gt;{{cite book |last=Chomsky |first=Noam |year=2002 |origyear=1957 |title= Syntactic Structures |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=SNeHkMXHcd8C&amp;pg=PA11&amp;dq=%22syntax+is%22 11]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of many syntacticians is to discover the [[Universal grammar|syntactic rules]] common to all languages.

In mathematics, ''syntax'' refers to the rules governing the notation of mathematical systems, such as [[formal language]]s used in [[logic]]. (See [[Syntax (logic)|logical syntax]].)

== Etymology ==
The word ''syntax'' comes from [[Ancient Greek]]: {{wikt-lang|grc|σύνταξις}} "coordination", which consists of {{lang|grc|σύν}} ''syn'', "together", and {{lang|grc|τάξις}} ''táxis'', "an ordering".

==Sequencing of subject, verb, and object==

A basic feature of a language's syntax is the sequence in which the [[subject (grammar)|subject]] (S), [[verb]] (V), and [[object (grammar)|object]] (O) usually appear in sentences. Over 85% of languages usually place the subject first, either in the sequence [[subject-verb-object|SVO]] or the sequence [[subject-object-verb|SOV]]. The other possible sequences are [[verb-subject-object|VSO]], [[verb-object-subject|VOS]], [[object-verb-subject|OVS]], and [[object-subject-verb|OSV]], the last three of which are rare.

== Early history ==
Works on [[grammar]] were written long before modern syntax came about; in [[Ancient India|Ancient]] [[India]], the ''Aṣṭādhyāyī'' of [[Pāṇini]] (c. 4th century BC) is often cited as an example of a premodern work that approaches the sophistication of a modern syntactic theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fortson IV |first=Benjamin W. |title=Indo-European Language and Culture: An Introduction |publisher=Blackwell |year=2004 |isbn=978-1405188968 |page=186 |quote=[The ''Aṣṭādhyāyī''] is a highly precise and thorough description of the structure of Sanskrit somewhat resembling modern generative grammar...[it] remained the most advanced linguistic analysis of any kind until the twentieth century.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the West, the school of thought that came to be known as "traditional grammar" began with the work of [[Dionysius Thrax]].

For centuries, work in syntax was dominated by a framework known as {{lang|fr|grammaire générale}}, first expounded in 1660 by [[Antoine Arnauld]] in a book of the same title. This system took as its basic premise the assumption that language is a direct reflection of thought processes and therefore there is a single, most natural way to express a thought.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

However, in the 19th century, with the development of [[historical-comparative linguistics]], linguists began to realize the sheer diversity of human language and to question fundamental assumptions about the relationship between language and logic. It became apparent that there was no such thing as the most natural way to express a thought, and therefore [[logic]] could no longer be relied upon as a basis for studying the structure of language.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

The [[Port-Royal-des-Champs|Port-Royal grammar]] modeled the study of syntax upon that of logic. (Indeed, large parts of the [[Port-Royal Logic]] were copied or adapted from the ''Grammaire générale''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Arnauld |first=Antoine |title=La logique |year=1683 |edition=5th |location=Paris |publisher=G. Desprez |url=http://visualiseur.bnf.fr/Visualiseur?Destination=Gallica&amp;O=NUMM-57444 |quote={{lang|fr|Nous avons emprunté...ce que nous avons dit...d'un petit Livre...sous le titre de Grammaire générale.}} |pages=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Syntactic categories were identified with logical ones, and all sentences were analyzed in terms of "subject – copula – predicate". Initially, this view was adopted even by the early comparative linguists such as [[Franz Bopp]].

The central role of syntax within [[theoretical linguistics]] became clear only in the 20th century, which could reasonably be called the "century of syntactic theory" as far as linguistics is concerned. (For a detailed and critical survey of the history of syntax in the last two centuries, see the monumental work by Giorgio Graffi (2001)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Giorgio |first=Graffi |year= 2001 |url= https://books.google.com/books/about/200_Years_of_Syntax.html?id=mydolrE-PPkC |title= 200 Years of Syntax: A Critical Survey |format=googlebook preview |publisher=John Benjamins Publishing |isbn=9789027284570  }}&lt;/ref&gt;.)

== Theories ==
There are a number of theoretical approaches to the discipline of syntax. One school of thought, founded in the works of [[Derek Bickerton]],&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite book |title=Language and Species |author=Bickerton, Derek |year=1990 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=0-226-04610-9}} and, for more recent advances, {{cite book |title=Biological foundations and origin of syntax |editor1=Derek Bickerton |editor2=Eörs Szathmáry |year=2009 |publisher=[[MIT Press]] |isbn=978-0-262-01356-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; sees syntax as a branch of biology, since it conceives of syntax as the study of linguistic knowledge as embodied in the human [[mind]]. Other linguists (e.g., [[Gerald Gazdar]]) take a more [[Philosophy of mathematics#Platonism|Platonistic]] view, since they regard syntax to be the study of an abstract [[formal system]].&lt;ref&gt;Ted Briscoe, 2 May 2001, [http://www.informatics.susx.ac.uk/research/nlp/gazdar/briscoe/gpsg.html#SECTION00040000000000000000 Interview with Gerald Gazdar] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051122163306/http://www.informatics.susx.ac.uk/research/nlp/gazdar/briscoe/gpsg.html |date=2005-11-22 }}. Retrieved 2008-06-04.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet others (e.g., [[Joseph Greenberg]]) consider syntax a taxonomical device to reach broad generalizations across languages.

=== Generative grammar ===
{{Main|Generative grammar}}
The hypothesis of generative grammar is that language is a structure of the human mind. The goal of generative grammar is to make a complete model of this inner language (known as ''[[i-language]]''). This model could be used to describe all human language and to predict the [[grammaticality]] of any given utterance (that is, to predict whether the utterance would sound correct to native speakers of the language). This approach to language was pioneered by [[Noam Chomsky]]. Most generative theories (although not all of them) assume that syntax is based upon the constituent structure of sentences. Generative grammars are among the theories that focus primarily on the form of a sentence, rather than its communicative function.

Among the many generative theories of linguistics, the Chomskyan theories are:
* [[Transformational grammar]] (TG) (Original theory of generative syntax laid out by Chomsky in ''Syntactic Structures'' in 1957)&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, Noam. 1957. ''Syntactic Structures''. The Hague/Paris: Mouton, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Government and binding theory]] (GB) (revised theory in the tradition of TG developed mainly by Chomsky in the 1970s and 1980s)&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, Noam (1981/1993). Lectures on Government and Binding: The Pisa Lectures. Mouton de Gruyter.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Minimalist program]] (MP) (a reworking of the theory out of the GB framework published by Chomsky in 1995)&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, Noam (1995). The Minimalist Program. MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other theories that find their origin in the generative paradigm are:
* [[Arc pair grammar]]
* [[Generalized phrase structure grammar]] (GPSG; now largely out of date)
* [[Generative semantics]] (superseded by Semantic Syntax &lt;ref&gt;Seuren, P. A. M. 2018. ''Semantic Syntax''. Revised edition. Leiden: Brill&lt;/ref&gt;)
* [[Head-driven phrase structure grammar]] (HPSG)
* [[Lexical functional grammar]] (LFG)
* [[Nanosyntax]]&lt;!--Commenting out until explained: the link seems to be about something unrelated. HPSG and LFG also fall into the category of [[unification]] grammars.--&gt;
* [[Relational grammar]] (RG) (now largely out of date)

=== Dependency grammar ===
{{Main|Dependency grammar}}
[[Dependency grammar]] is an approach to sentence structure where syntactic units are arranged according to the dependency relation, as opposed to the constituency relation of [[phrase structure grammar]]s. Dependencies are directed links between words. The (finite) verb is seen as the root of all clause structure and all the other words in the clause are either directly or indirectly dependent on this root. Some prominent dependency-based theories of syntax are:

* [[Recursive categorical syntax]], or Algebraic syntax
* [[Functional generative description]]
* [[Meaning–text theory]]
* [[Operator grammar]]
* [[Word grammar]]

[[Lucien Tesnière]] (1893–1954) is widely seen as the father of modern dependency-based theories of syntax and grammar. He argued vehemently against the binary division of the clause into [[subject (grammar)|subject]] and [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]] that is associated with the grammars of his day (S → NP VP) and which remains at the core of most phrase structure grammars. In the place of this division, he positioned the verb as the root of all clause structure.&lt;ref&gt;Concerning Tesnière's rejection of the binary division of the clause into subject and predicate and in favor of the verb as the root of all structure, see Tesnière (1969:103–105).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Categorial grammar ===
{{Main|Categorial grammar}}
[[Categorial grammar]] is an approach that attributes the syntactic structure not to rules of grammar, but to the properties of the [[syntactic categories]] themselves. For example, rather than asserting that sentences are constructed by a rule that combines a noun phrase (NP) and a verb phrase (VP) (e.g., the [[phrase structure rule]] S → NP VP), in categorial grammar, such principles are embedded in the category of the [[head (linguistics)|head]] word itself. So the syntactic category for an [[intransitive]] verb is a complex formula representing the fact that the verb acts as a [[function word]] requiring an NP as an input and produces a sentence level structure as an output. This complex category is notated as (NP\S) instead of V. NP\S is read as "a category that searches to the left (indicated by \) for an NP (the element on the left) and outputs a sentence (the element on the right)." The category of [[transitive verb]] is defined as an element that requires two NPs (its subject and its direct object) to form a sentence. This is notated as (NP/(NP\S)) which means "a category that searches to the right (indicated by /) for an NP (the object), and generates a function (equivalent to the VP) which is (NP\S), which in turn represents a function that searches to the left for an NP and produces a sentence."

[[Tree-adjoining grammar]] is a categorial grammar that adds in partial [[tree structure]]s to the categories.

=== Stochastic/probabilistic grammars/network theories ===
Theoretical approaches to syntax that are based upon [[probability theory]] are known as [[stochastic grammar]]s. One common implementation of such an approach makes use of a [[neural network]] or [[connectionism]].

=== Functionalist grammars ===
{{main|Functional theories of grammar}}
Functionalist theories, although focused upon form, are driven by explanation based upon the function of a sentence (i.e., its communicative function). Some typical functionalist theories include:
* [[Cognitive grammar]]
* [[Construction grammar]] (CxG)
* [[Emergent grammar]]
* [[Functional discourse grammar]] (Dik)
* [[Prague linguistic circle]]
* [[Role and reference grammar]] (RRG)
* [[Systemic functional grammar]]

{{Nationalism sidebar |Types}}

'''Territorial nationalism''' describes a form of [[nationalism]] based on the belief that all inhabitants of a particular [[territory]] should share a common [[national identity]], regardless of their ethnic, linguistic, religious, cultural and other differences. Depending on the political or administrative status of a particular territory, ''territorial nationalism'' can be manifested on two basic levels, as territorial nationalism of distinctive [[sovereign states]], or territorial nationalism of distinctive sub-sovereign [[administrative regions|regions]] (''regional nationalism'').&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/20244600/Cosmopolitaniam_Nation-States_and_Minority_Nationalism_A_Critical_Review_of_Recent_Literature Will Kymlicka and Christine Straehle, "Cosmopolitaniam, Nation-States, and Minority Nationalism: A Critical Review of Recent Literature", European Journal of Philosophy, vol. 7/1 (1999), pp. 65–88]&lt;/ref&gt;

Within sovereign [[nation states]], territorial nationalism is manifested as a belief that all inhabitants of that [[nation]] owe allegiance to their country of birth or adoption.&lt;ref name=NorthAfrica&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1BmPsVvbbdQC&amp;pg=PA22 Middle East and North Africa: Challenge to Western Security] by Peter Duignan and L.H. Gann, [[Hoover Institution Press]], 1981, {{ISBN|978-0-8179-7392-6}} (p. 22)&lt;/ref&gt; According to territorial nationalism every individual must belong to a nation, but can choose which one to join.&lt;ref name="Populist Challenge"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=NTWZKZwo5MoC&amp;pg=PA133 The Populist Challenge: Political Protest and Ethno-Nationalist Mobilization in France] by [[Jens Rydgren]], [[Berghahn Books]], 2004, {{ISBN|1571816917}}&lt;/ref&gt; A sacred quality is sought in this nation and in the popular memories it evokes.&lt;ref name=ternat&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=9_vuJusOJkMC&amp;pg=PA62&amp;dq=%22territorial+nationalism%22&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22territorial%20nationalism%22&amp;f=false Encyclopaedia of Nationalism] by Athena S. Leoussi and Anthony D. Smith, [[Transaction Publishers]], 2001, {{ISBN|978-0-7658-0002-2}}, (p. 62)&lt;/ref&gt; Citizenship is idealized by a territorial nationalist.&lt;ref name=ternat/&gt; A criterion of a territorial nationalism is the establishment of a mass, public culture based on common values and traditions of the population.&lt;ref name="Populist Challenge"/&gt;&lt;ref name=ternat/&gt; [[Legal equality]] is essential for territorial nationalism.&lt;ref name="Populist Challenge"/&gt;

Because [[citizenship]] rather than ethnicity is idealized by territorial nationalism, it is argued by [[Athena S. Leoussi]] and [[Anthony D. Smith]] (in 2001) that the [[French Revolution]] was a territorial nationalistic uprising.&lt;ref name=ternat/&gt;

Territorial nationalism is also connected to the concepts of ''[[Lebensraum]]'', [[forced expulsion]], [[ethnic cleansing]] and sometimes even [[genocide]] when one nation claims a certain imaginary territory and wants to get rid of other nations living on it. These territorial aspirations are part of the goal of an ethnically pure nation-state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Geographic Aspects of Genocide: A Comparison of Bosnia and Rwanda|author=William B. Wood|journal=Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers| volume= 26|issue= 1 |year=2001|pages= 57–75|jstor=623145}}&lt;/ref&gt; This also sometimes leads to [[irredentism]], since some nationalists demand that the state and nation are incomplete if an entire nation is not included into one single state, and thus aims to include members of its nations from a neighboring country. This thus often leads to [[ethnic conflict]]. [[Thomas Ambrosio]] argues: "If the leader of state A sends material support and/or actual troops into state B in the hopes of detaching state A's diaspora from state B, this would clearly be an indication of ethno-territorial nationalism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0hLzXEO-fAQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Irredentism:+Ethnic+Conflict+and+International+Politics&amp;hl=hr&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=snippet&amp;q=territorial%20nationalism&amp;f=false |title=Irredentism: Ethnic Conflict and International Politics| ref=Ambrosio2001|first=Thomas |last=Ambrosio|publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]]|year= 2001| pages=18, 19 |isbn=9780275972608}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Territorial nationalism in Europe ==

In Western Europe national identity tends to be more based on where a person is born than in [[Central Europe|Central]] and Eastern Europe.&lt;ref name=Storey&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=X2AuCIw_eAgC&amp;pg=PA66 Territory: The Claiming of Space] by [[David Storey (historian)|David Storey]], [[Prentice Hall]], 2003, {{ISBN|978-0-582-32790-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars have argued this might be explained by the fact that states in the later two emerged from [[Empire|imperial states]].&lt;ref name=Stalini&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=OcrukduMxHUC&amp;pg=PA31 Changing Europe: Identities, Nations and Citizens] by [[David Dunkerley (historian)|]], [[Lesley Hodgson]], [[Stanislaw Konopacki]], and [[Tony Spybey]], [[Routledge]], 2002, {{ISBN|978-0-415-26777-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[communist regimes]] in the [[Eastern Bloc]] actively suppressed what they described as "[[bourgeois nationalism]]"&lt;ref name=Stalini/&gt; and considered nationalism a [[bourgeois]] ideology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3404100886.html Khiterer, V. (2004) 'Nationalism in the Soviet Union'], in ''Encyclopedia of Russian History'', Macmillan Reference USA&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Soviet Union]] this led to [[Russification]] and other attempts to replace the other [[Demographics of the Soviet Union#Ethnic groups|cultures of the Soviet Union]] with the [[Russian culture]],&lt;ref name=Stalini/&gt; even while, at the same time the Soviet Union promoted certain forms of nationalism that it considered compatible with Soviet interests.&lt;ref&gt;The Revenge of the Past: Nationalism, Revolution, and the Collapse of the Soviet Union by [[Ronald Grigor Suny]], [[Stanford University Press]], 1993, {{ISBN|0804722471}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yugoslavia]] was different from the other European Communist states, where [[Yugoslavism]] was promoted.&lt;ref name=Stalini/&gt;

== Territorial nationalism in the Middle East ==

Although territorial nationalism is in contrast with the universality of [[Islam]],&lt;ref name=Kenneth&gt;[http://archives.colstate.edu/GAH/1982/1982/pgs1-11.pdf The emergence of territorial nationalism in the contemporary Arab Middle East] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060922161848/http://archives.colstate.edu/GAH/1982/1982/pgs1-11.pdf |date=22 September 2006 }} by [[Kenneth W.

==Territorial nationalism in Africa==
In Africa, the prime examples of territorial nationalism are the overlapping [[irredentist]] concepts of [[Greater Morocco]] and [[Greater Mauritania]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bundesheer.at/pdf_pool/publikationen/hasa03.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; While Mauritania has since relinquished any claims to territories outside its internationally recognized borders, Morocco continues to occupy lands south of Morocco, referred to as its "[[Southern Provinces]]".

== Territorial nationalism in North America ==

Just as in [[Western Europe]], national identity tends to be more based on where a person is born than [[ethnicity]].&lt;ref name=Storey/&gt;

The '''Topoke people''' (sometimes incorrectly called ''Eso people'') are an ethnic group that live in the [[Isangi Territory]] south of the [[Congo River]], downstream from [[Kisangani]] in [[Tshopo District]] of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
They speak the [[Poke language]] (also called Puki, Tofoke, Topoke or Tovoke), in the [[Soko–Kele languages]] group of [[Bantu languages]].{{sfn|Ethnologue}}

==Location==

The Topoke are one of the three main ethnic groups in the Isangi territory. The other two are the [[Lokele people|Lokele]] and [[Turumbu people|Turumbu]].
Their main territory is between 0° and 2° South, 23° and 25° East. The heart of the territory is in the angle formed by the Congo and  [[Lomami River|Lomami]] rivers. [[Ilambi]] is one of their communities.
Another group of Topoke people is located in the [[Yalikandja]]-[[Yanonge]] sector.
This group, commonly known as the "Topoke of Likolo" is due to population movements caused by the penetration of Arab slavers into the region.{{sfn|Boingaoli|1993}}

The Topoke may have originated to the north of the Congo River, in the [[Ubangi River|Ubangi]]-[[Uele River|Uele]] basin. They would have abandoned this territory when threatened by the [[Baboa people|Baboa]] and [[Zande people|Zande]] people. During their march to the south, they would have first settled on the right bank of the Congo River around the lower [[Aruwimi River|Aruwimi]]. From there they crossed the river to settle in their current territory, having driven the original [[Bangando people|Bangando]] and [[Bambole people|Bambole]] inhabitants further south.{{sfn|Boingaoli|1993}}
There are cultural affinities between the Topoke and the [[Mongandu people|Mongandu]] and Bambole peoples.{{sfn|Burgess|1982}}

According to the 1984 Census, the Topoke accounted for 52.38% (128,613 out of 245,548 total inhabitants) of the population of the Isangi area.{{sfn|Boingaoli|1993}}

==Pre-colonial culture==

Music and dance played important roles in Topoke culture, and music in particular reached a high level of sophistication.{{sfn|The Topoke People 1959}}
The Topoke people had a long tradition of large regional markets, where purchases could be made on credit or by using iron javelins as currency.
Non-payment of debts periodically led to fighting, in which the javelins were used as weapons.{{sfn|Heritage Auction 2007|p=204}}
The lances were called ''ndoa'' by some Topoke, the Lokele word for marriage.
Thirty of them would buy a male slave, while forty or more would be needed for a female.{{sfn|Hunt|1999|p=37}}
The Topoke were polygynous, and it was common for an important visitor to be offered female companionship as well as food and shelter. This practice persisted well into the colonial era.{{sfn|Likaka|2009|p=115}}
However, sometimes sexual abuse of Topoke women by colonial administrators led to retaliation such as poisoning attempts by their husbands.{{sfn|Likaka|2009|pp=116-117}}

==Colonial era and later==

The [[Lomami Company]] was formed in 1898 and in 1899 started forcing the local people to harvest rubber.
In 1905 two white officers of the Company were killed by warriors of [[Yaboila]].
Mr. Pimpurnaux, former District Commissioner of Aruwimi, led punitive expeditions.{{sfn|Boingaoli|1993}}
One of the Topoke men accused of the murder was hung at [[Basoko]] in November 1905.{{sfn|Hunt|1999|p=57}}
Some Topoke families in the Mongo block at [[Bondombe]], in the [[Tshuapa River|Tshuapa]] basin on the equator, are descended from  Topoke who fled the 1905 expeditions.{{sfn|Boingaoli|1993}}
Resistance to work as rubber harvesters was widespread, with the men retreating to hiding places in the marshes to avoid being forcibly recruited for work that they equated with slavery during the period of Arab occupation.{{sfn|Likaka|2009|p=91}}

The Topoke were relatively isolated from missionary activity and wage earning until the 1930s.
After [[World War II]] they began to move to [[Kisangani]] to work as unskilled laborers, but were at a disadvantage compared to more established urban groups. However, by 1975 many had become businessmen, intellectuals and university students.{{sfn|MacGaffey|1987|p=85}}

'''Traci Elizabeth Lords''' (born '''Nora Louise Kuzma'''; May 7, 1968) is an American actress, singer, model, writer, producer, and director. During the mid 1980s, she was one of the most sought-after pornographic actresses in the adult entertainment industry. When law enforcement discovered that pornographers were distributing and selling images and films taken of her when she was a minor, it led to prosecutions and court cases that changed the pornography industry in the United States, in addition to bans on all but one of her adult films.

After her departure from pornography at age eighteen, Lords enrolled at the [[Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute|Lee Strasberg Theater Institute]] where she studied [[method acting]] with the intention of becoming a mainstream actress. She made her screen debut at age 19 in a leading role in the 1988 remake of the 1957 science fiction film ''[[Not of This Earth (1988 film)|Not of This Earth]]''. Lords followed with the role of Wanda Woodward in [[John Waters]]' teen comedy, ''[[Cry-Baby]]'' (1990).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/work/careers/what-happens-when-pornstars-change-jobs/news-story/bd1b505881317454aa45ae00221df2f1|title=What happens when porn stars change jobs}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her other acting credits include the television series ''[[MacGyver (1985 TV series)|MacGyver]]'', ''[[Married... with Children]]'', ''[[Tales from the Crypt (TV series)|Tales from the Crypt]]'', ''[[Roseanne]]'', ''[[Melrose Place]]'', ''[[Profiler (TV series)|Profiler]]'', ''[[First Wave (TV series)|First Wave]]'', ''[[Gilmore Girls]]'' and ''[[Will &amp; Grace]]''. She also appeared in films such as ''[[Skinner (film)|Skinner]]'' (1993)'', [[Virtuosity]]'' (1995), ''[[Blade (film)|Blade]]'' (1998), ''[[Zack and Miri Make a Porno]]'' (2008) and most recently ''[[Excision (film)|Excision]]'' (2012), which earned her a [[Fangoria#Fangoria Chainsaw Awards|Fangoria Chainsaw Award for Best Supporting Actress]] as well as a Fright Meter Award and a CinEuphoria Award.

Lords also pursued music in addition to her film career. After her song "Love Never Dies" was featured on the soundtrack to the film ''[[Pet Sematary Two]]'' (1992), she was signed to [[Radioactive Records]] and subsequently released her debut studio album, ''[[1000 Fires]]'' (1995) to generally positive reviews. Despite the poor sales of the album, the lead single "[[Control (Traci Lords song)|Control]]" had moderate commercial success. It peaked at number two on the [[Hot Dance Club Songs|''Billboard'' Hot Dance Club Songs]] chart and was included on the soundtrack to the film ''[[Mortal Kombat (film)|Mortal Kombat]]'' (1995), which was eventually certified [[RIAA certification|double platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). In 2003, Lords published her autobiography, ''[[Traci Lords: Underneath It All]]'', which received positive reviews from critics and debuted at number 31 on [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''The New York Times'' Best Seller list]]. She is currently starring in the popular comedy series [[Swedish Dicks]] on [[Pop (U.S. TV network)|Pop]]. The hit comedy also stars [[Peter Stormare]] and [[Keanu Reeves]].

== Life and career ==

=== 1968–83: Early life ===
[[File:Traci Lords HS Yearbook.jpeg|thumb|right|upright|Lords as a freshman in high school, 1983]]

Lords was born Nora Louise Kuzma on May 7, 1968, in [[Steubenville, Ohio]],  to Louis and Patricia Kuzma.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lords|2003|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gq&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jordan|first=Pat|date=April 1990|title=Traci Lords With Her Clothes On|url=http://www.bronxbanterblog.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/1120_001-2.pdf|journal=[[GQ]]|pages=250–304|access-date=March 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father's parents were [[Jewish]] immigrants from [[Ukraine]], while her mother was of [[Irish people|Irish]] ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lords|2003|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Louis was employed as a steelworker. Kuzma has one elder sister, Lorraine, and two younger sisters, Rachel and Grace. Her parents divorced when she was seven years old and Kuzma moved with her mother and three sisters to her great-grandmother's house.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lords|2003|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following their divorce, her father got partial [[Child custody|custody]]. Around that same time, her mother enrolled at [[Ohio University]] and landed a part-time job.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lords|2003|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=left|quote=I never wanted to be like my mother. You know, kids at sixteen, a husband who drinks and beats you.

I just wanted to piss my mother off.|source=—Lords about her teenage years&lt;ref name=gq/&gt;}}

When she was twelve, Kuzma moved with her mother and sisters to Redondo Beach, California, along with her mother's new boyfriend. She didn't see her father for many years after. In September 1982, she began attending the [[Redondo Union High School]] in [[Redondo Beach, California]].&lt;ref name=krajicek&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/criminal_mind/sexual_assault/traci_lords/index.html|title=Traci Lords|last=Krajicek|first=David|date=May 26, 2005|website=[[Crime Library]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210000122/http://www.crimelibrary.com/criminal_mind/sexual_assault/traci_lords/index.html|archive-date=February 10, 2015|access-date=March 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; During her early school years, Kuzma developed a rebellious attitude. She was angry at her mother and found a father figure in her mother's boyfriend. Roger Hayes, as she calls him in her [[Traci Lords: Underneath It All|autobiography]], was a [[cocaine|drug abuser]] and molested Kuzma in her sleep.&lt;ref name=datelinenbc&gt;{{cite episode|title=Secrets &amp; Lies|series=[[Dateline NBC]]|first=Josh|last=Mankiewicz|network=[[NBC]]|date=July 11, 2003|season=15|number=78|transcript=Transcript of the original source|transcript-url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/3080023/ns/dateline_nbc-newsmakers/t/traci-lords/#.VuhDD0dX2So}}&lt;/ref&gt; After her mother broke up with him due to his drug use, she began dating his friend. Kuzma refused to follow them to a new place and was left with her older sister Lorraine. Her mother and two younger sisters eventually found a new apartment.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lords|2003|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1984–86: Pornography career ===
At age 13, Kuzma became pregnant by her high school boyfriend. Afraid of her mother's reaction, she went to Hayes for help. He arranged for her to have an [[abortion]] without her mother's knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lords|2003|p=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jung|2010|p=182}}&lt;/ref&gt; Looking for a job to get some money, she was introduced to his friend and started working for her as a babysitter. The woman offered to improve Kuzma's job opportunities by helping her get a fake [[driver's license]]. She provided Kuzma with a new [[birth certificate]] on condition that if she were ever caught she would say that she had stolen the phony identification.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lords|2003|p=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kuzma now had a new driver's license with the name Kristie Elizabeth Nussman that stated she was 22 rather than 15 years old. She was now able to line up a few job interviews. In February 1984, Kuzma answered a newspaper advertisement for [[Jim South]]'s World Modeling Talent Agency. Posing as her stepfather, Hayes drove her to the agency.&lt;ref name=krajicek/&gt; After signing a contract, she began working as a nude model and appeared in magazines such as ''[[Velvet (magazine)|Velvet]]'', ''[[Juggs]]'', and ''[[Club (magazine)|Club]]''. During August, when she was selected to model for ''[[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]]'' magazine's 15th-anniversary issue, Kuzma was asked to choose a [[stage name]]. She chose Traci—one of the popular names she had longed for growing up—and Lords, after the actor [[Jack Lord]], since she was a fan of the television series ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'', in which he portrayed the character of Steve McGarrett. Some of her schoolmates recognized her in the ''Velvet'' magazine pictorial.  Lords subsequently quit high school at age 15 and entered the sex industry, where formal education was irrelevant. The September 1984 issue, which featured Lords in a nude centerfold – she earned $5,000 for the shoot – became the best-selling issue in the history of ''Penthouse'', partly because it also featured a nude pictorial of [[Vanessa L. Williams|Vanessa Williams]] (appearing with [[George Burns]] on the cover photograph), who had won the Miss America Pageant the previous year.  Lords' article stated that she was 22 years of age, was a virgin until nineteen, and had studied interior design at El Camino College.

Lords made the first of her many illegal movies during October 1984, when she appeared in ''[[What Gets Me Hot!]]'' alongside [[Tom Byron]], who later became her boyfriend off-screen.&lt;ref name=skinflicks&gt;Jennings, David. (2000). [https://books.google.com/books?id=3VCVm7sc5JsC ''Skinflicks: The Inside Story of the X-Rated Video Industry'']. [[AuthorHouse]]. {{ISBN|978-1587211843}}. Google Book Search. Retrieved on March 14, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; She first appeared only in a non-sex role but was later replaced with a hardcore scene. In her next movie, ''Those Young Girls'', she appeared in a sex role alongside [[Harry Reems]] and [[Ginger Lynn]]. After appearing at age 16 with [[John Leslie (director)|John Leslie]] (an actor 23 years her senior) in the porno parody of the movie ''[[Splash (film)|Splash]]'', ''[[Talk Dirty to Me Part III]]'' (which won the [[AVN Award]] for the best movie), Lords was hailed as the "Princess of Porn" (she had appeared in a torrid sex scene with Leslie at the end of the film).  She became one of the highest-paid porn actresses of that time, earning more than $1,000 a day. Besides her work in porn, she also appeared in the music video for "[[Gimme Gimme Good Lovin']]" by the heavy metal band [[Helix (band)|Helix]]. Lords continued making more movies until the autumn of 1985 when she tried to quit the industry at age 17 (she returned a few months later). Afterward, she met Stuart Dell, who became her boyfriend, manager, and business partner. They formed the Traci Lords Company.  Dell and Lords made a distribution deal with Sy Adler, an industry veteran who ran Vantage International, that they would produce three movies for the company. During March, the first TLC feature, ''[[Traci Takes Tokyo]]'', was released. The second, ''Beverly Hills Copulator'', was released afterward, and the third movie, ''Screamer'', (Eddie Dzial) was shelved.&lt;ref name=skinflicks/&gt;&lt;ref name=popfiction&gt;[http://popfiction.com/handsoftime/html/she/traci.HTML "The Traci Lords Story"].

During late May 1986 (around three weeks after Lords' 18th birthday), authorities discovered she had been underage when she appeared in the porn movies. She had lied to law enforcement, photographers, producers, directors, co-workers, and the general public for two years. The owners of her movie agency and X-Citement Video, Inc. were arrested. (See ''[[United States v. X-Citement Video]]''.) She was taken into [[protective custody]] and hired high-profile lawyer [[Leslie Abramson]]. On July 10, [[district attorney]]'s investigators searched Lords' [[Redondo Beach, California|Redondo Beach]] home as well as the Sun Valley offices of Vantage International Productions (a major producer of adult movies) and the [[Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles|Sherman Oaks]] offices of modeling agent Jim South. South and other industry officials said that Lords, who was seeking employment, provided a California driver's license, a U.S. passport, and a birth certificate, which stated that her name was Kristie Nussman and gave a birth date of November 17, 1962. Leslie Jay, a spokeswoman for'' Penthouse'' publisher [[Bob Guccione]], also said Lords showed identification indicating that she was older than 18 before the illicit photos for the September 1984 issue were taken (she was actually fifteen years of age in the photographs).&lt;ref name=palermo&gt;Palermo, Dave.

Two adults who knew Lords, but who requested anonymity, said they saw her picture in the adult magazine ''Velvet'' during July 1984, and telephoned the district attorney's office to inform authorities that she was underage, but that an investigator told them, "There isn't anything we can do about it."&lt;ref&gt;Soble, Ronald L. and Feldman, Paul.

On July 17, 1986, [[video rental shop]]s and [[adult movie theater]]s in the USA were ordered to withdraw from their shelves all [[Hardcore pornography|hardcore]] material featuring Lords, because the videos were classified as [[child pornography]]. John Weston, attorney of the [[Adult Film Association of America]], said distributors should withdraw any movie made before May 1986, featuring Lords "in sexual conduct, no matter how briefly". The withdrawal of Lords' movies from the market cost the industry millions of dollars.&lt;ref name=palermo/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kolson, Ann.

While most of her movies were permanently removed from distribution in the United States, several were re-edited to remove Lords' scenes entirely (such as ''[[Kinky Business]]'' and ''[[New Wave Hookers]]''), or in a few cases, had new footage filmed with a different actress playing her part (as in ''[[Talk Dirty to Me Part III]]''). The only movie legally available in the United States was ''[[Traci, I Love You]]'', filmed in Cannes, France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://people.com/celebrity/traci-cleans-up/feed/ |title=Traci Cleans Up |author=&lt;!--staff--&gt; |date=November 27, 1998 |work=People |accessdate=December 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; only two days after her 18th birthday.&lt;ref name=popfiction/&gt; She sold her rights to ''Traci, I Love You'' during early 1987 for over $100,000. This action resulted in claims that she herself had tipped off the authorities to gain immunity from prosecution while being the only one to profit from the movie. Lords denies this notion in her autobiography and says she was reluctant to sell the rights, since at that time she was trying to become a mainstream actress, and wanted no older movies still available. "Traci, I Love You" was the last porn film that featured Traci Lords. Lords was offered enormous sums of money to continue in porn, but she declined the requests.{{citation needed|date=November 2017|reason=vague, needs support}}

=== 1987–91: Transition to mainstream, ''Not of This Earth'' and ''Cry-Baby'' ===
After spending several months in therapy, Lords decided to concentrate on acting. She enrolled at the [[Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute]], where she studied [[method acting]] for three months. After leaving the school, Lords placed an advertisement in [[The Hollywood Reporter]] looking for representation. She was contacted by Fred Westheimer and although the agency declined to officially represent her, he decided to send her out on a few auditions. As a result, she was offered a guest role in an episode of the television series ''[[Wiseguy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Broeske|first=Pat H.|date=March 20, 1988|title=Traci Does TV|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-03-20/entertainment/ca-2391_1_traci-lords|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=March 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterwards, she met the director [[Jim Wynorski]], who was directing the remake of [[Roger Corman]]'s 1957 sci-fi classic ''[[Not of This Earth (1957 film)|Not of This Earth]]''. He immediately cast Lords into the lead role of Nadine Story, and ''[[Not of This Earth (1988 film)|Not of This Earth]]'' (1988) became her first mainstream film debut since her departure from the adult film industry. Although the film failed at the box office, it did well in video sales, and, based on that success, Lords was offered to appear in Wynorski's next film, ''The Haunting of Morella'' (1989). However, Lords turned down the offer due to the requirement of having a nude scene, since she was trying to establish herself as a serious actress.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McCarty|1995|p=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also signed with a modeling agency under her birth name Nora Kuzma and appeared on two covers of [[Joe Weider]]'s magazine ''[[Muscle &amp; Fitness]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Broeske|first=Pat H.|date=January 31, 1988|title=A Model of Fitness|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-01-31/entertainment/ca-39403_1_traci-lords|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=March 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around that time, Lords became a spokesperson for Children of the Night, an organization for runaways and abused children, and was planning to release a book titled ''Out of the Blue: The Traci Lords Story''.&lt;ref name=orangecoast&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weinberg|first=Marc|date=July 1988|title=The Return of Traci Lords|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7mAEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA192|journal=[[Orange Coast Magazine]]|pages=192–195|access-date=March 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1988, Lords enrolled in another acting class and again began looking for an agent. In December, she mass-mailed her resume to various agents and arranged a meeting with Don Gerler. Lords auditioned for the part of [[Breathless Mahoney]] in the film ''[[Dick Tracy (1990 film)|Dick Tracy]]'' (1990), but the role went to [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|series=Into the Night|first=Rick|last=Dees|network=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]|date=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1989, [[John Waters]] auditioned her for his teenage comedy musical ''[[Cry-Baby]]'' (1990).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dougherty|first=Margot|date=September 11, 1989|title=What Hath John Waters Wrought?

The film was a critical and commercial success, and her portrayal of the rebellious teenager Wanda Woodward established her as a legitimate actress.

An extended version was reissued in 1993 under the title ''Traci Lords: Advanced Jazzthetics''.

In 1991, Lords starred in the thriller ''[[Raw Nerve (1991 film)|Raw Nerve]]'' and the action crime film ''A Time to Die''. Lords appeared in such popular TV shows as Roseanne, Married with Children, MCGuyer and Hercules.

The producer of the soundtrack, [[Gary Kurfirst]], signed Lords to his company [[Radioactive Records]]. She was later featured on the songs "[[Little Baby Nothing]]" by [[Manic Street Preachers]] and "[[Acid Eaters|Somebody to Love]]" by [[Ramones]].

=== 2003–06: ''Underneath It All''===
[[File:Traci Lords DragonCon 2006.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Lords at the [[Dragon Con]], 2006]]

Her autobiography, ''[[Traci Lords: Underneath It All]]'', was published during July 2003 by [[HarperCollins]]. In the book, Lords chronicled her childhood, career and brief time in the x-rated industry.  The book received positive reviews from critics and was a commercial success making [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''The New York Times'' Best Seller list]]. It was criticized by pornographers, who claim they were the victims. In the book, Lords revealed that she received about  $35,000 as total compensation for all her porno movies, including the $5,000 for her underage appearance in ''[[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]]''. Lords continued to use the now-famous stage name that she had given herself as a minor and ultimately made it her legal name. She explained, "I chose to stop running from it. Instead, I won it, legally changing my name to Traci Elizabeth Lords. That's who I was, and that's who I was going to be." In her interview with [[Oprah Winfrey]] she stated: "I found you can run, but you cannot hide."

During 2003, it was announced that Lords was working on new music and had recorded a cover version of [[Missing Persons (band)|Missing Persons]]' song "[[Spring Session M|Walking In L.A.]]".

I never thought it would be on something called ''Zack and Miri Make a Porno''. What? So I went and I read the script at his house and I was prepared to say no. I thought I have the perfect out.

In 2009, Lords appeared in the direct-to-DVD science fiction movie, ''[[Princess of Mars]]'', alongside [[Antonio Sabàto, Jr.]] She was disappointed by the final project. "Somewhere in my heart of hearts, I was worried that it might be a crummy movie. The production was just too careless. But I believed the voices of those around me who said 'No, it'll be artistic, no it'll be creative. You'll look beautiful. We have a very limited budget but honest, you'll be proud.'  They were wrong, it was very bad. At least that was what I was told. After watching the first two minutes I had to turn it off and hide under the covers."&lt;ref&gt;Lords, Traci.

The '''United States Children's Bureau''' is a federal agency organized under the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]]' [[Administration for Children and Families]].  Today, the bureau's operations involve improving [[child abuse]] prevention, [[foster care]], and [[adoption]]. Historically, its work was much broader, as shown by the 1912 act which created and funded it:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The said bureau shall investigate and report to [the Department of Commerce and Labor] upon all matters pertaining to the welfare of children and child life among all classes of our people, and shall especially investigate the questions of [[infant mortality]], the birth-rate, orphanage, [[juvenile court]]s, desertion, dangerous occupations, accidents and diseases of children, [[child labor|employment]], legislation affecting children in the several states and territories.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uscode.house.gov/statviewer.htm?volume=37&amp;page=79 Apr. 9, 1912, ch. 73, §2, 37 Stat. 79]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During the height of its influence, the Bureau was directed, managed, and staffed almost entirely by women—a rarity for any federal agency in the early 20th century. It was most influential in bringing the methods of [[Reform movement#United States: 1840s - 1930s|reform-oriented]] [[Social surveys|social research]] and the ideas of [[maternalist reform]]ers to bear on federal government policy.

[[New Deal]] legislation, including the [[Fair Labor Standards Act]] and [[Aid to Dependent Children]] programs, incorporated many reforms that the Children's Bureau and its network of [[General Federation of Women's Clubs|grassroots women's organizations]] had supported for years. By the time the Children's Bureau was folded into the Social Security Administration in 1946,&lt;ref name="ssa.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ssa.gov/history/childb1.html|title=Social Security|website=ssa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; it began to assume more of its modern role.&lt;ref&gt;Kriste Lindenmeyer, ''"A right to childhood": the U.S. Children's Bureau and child welfare, 1912-46'' (University of Illinois Press, 1997), [https://books.google.com/books?id=RRSqbUBRK2EC&amp;pg=PA30#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 30.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Creation===
Most accounts of the Children's Bureau's origins point to two women, [[Lillian Wald]] and [[Florence Kelley]], who began to discuss the idea around 1903. Their proposal (with colleagues) to President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] in 1905 reflected the [[Progressive Era]]'s generally heightened concern for social welfare issues, as well as the influence of the [[Settlement movement]], of which both women were members.&lt;ref&gt;Kriste Lindenmeyer, "A right to childhood": The U.S. Children's Bureau and child welfare, 1912-46 (University of Illinois Press, 1997), 9.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Also in 1905, the recently formed [[National Child Labor Committee]] (NCLC) agreed to make the establishment of a federal children's bureau its primary legislative goal. The NCLC's effort was supported by women's groups such as the [[National Consumers League]], the [[General Federation of Women's Clubs]], the [[National Congress of Mothers]], and the [[Daughters of the American Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Children's Bureau, U. S. Department of Health and Human Services|title=The Children's Bureau Legacy: Ensuring the Right to Childhood'' (Washington, DC: Author, 2013)|page=16|format=PDF|url=https://cb100.acf.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/cb_ebook/cb_ebook.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposal also was endorsed by attendees of the first [[White House Conference on Children and Youth]] in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;Lindenmeyer, 20-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

The bill establishing the Children's Bureau was passed in 1912 following a lengthy legislative effort, and it was signed by President [[William Howard Taft]] on April 9 of that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uscode.house.gov/statviewer.htm?volume=37&amp;page=79|title=Public Law 62-116}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Children's Bureau became the first national government office in the world that focused solely on the well-being of children and their mothers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RRSqbUBRK2EC&amp;pg=PA2#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=A Right to Childhood|website=google.com|isbn=9780252065774|last1=Lindenmeyer|first1=Kriste|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taft appointed [[Julia Lathrop]] as the first head of the Bureau. Lathrop, a noted [[maternalist reform]]er also active in the Settlement Movement, was the first woman ever to head a government agency in the United States.&lt;ref name=Ladd-Taylor&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Ladd-Taylor | first1 = Molly | title = Mother-Work: Women, Child Welfare, and the State, 1890-1930 | publisher = University of Illinois Press | year = 1995 | location = Urbana and Chicago | isbn = 978-0-252-06482-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At its founding, the bureau was part of the Department of Commerce and Labor; when the two departments' functions were separated in 1913, it became part of the Department of Labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title42-section192&amp;num=0&amp;edition=prelim|title=Mar. 4, 1913, ch. 141, §§3, 6, 37 Stat. 737 , 738}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1912–1920===

The Children's Bureau's first efforts focused on decreasing [[infant mortality]] by determining ''how many'' babies were dying, through expanded [[birth registration]] efforts, and understanding ''why'' so many babies died before their first birthday. The Bureau completed birth registration campaigns and conducted infant mortality studies in 10 cities between 1914 and 1921. These studies revealed strong connections between poverty and infant deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cb100.acf.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/cb_ebook/cb_ebook.pdf|title=The Children's Bureau Legacy: Ensuring the Right to Childhood|format=PDF|pages= 32–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bureau's commitment to fighting infant mortality resonated with the proliferation of "baby-saving" campaigns throughout the country at this time. The Bureau endorsed activities such as prenatal care, infant health clinics, visiting nurses, public sanitation, certified milk stations, and education of mothers.&lt;ref&gt;Lindenmeyer, 49-50.&lt;/ref&gt; It proclaimed a "Children's Year" beginning April 6, 1918, to protect children from shortages of milk, food, and public health nurses during [[World War I]]. As part of this effort, volunteers weighed and measured millions of children, resulting in the publication of the nation's first age, height, and weight standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cb100.acf.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/cb_ebook/cb_ebook.pdf|title=The Children's Bureau Legacy: Ensuring the Right to Childhood|format=PDF|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its first few years, the Children's Bureau published several pamphlets about prenatal, infant, and child care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mchlibrary.info/history/childrensbureau.html#parents|title=Children's Bureau Brochures and Booklets for Parents}}&lt;/ref&gt; These booklets were soon in high demand. By 1929, the Bureau estimated that the information in its pamphlets had benefited one-half of all U.S. babies.&lt;ref&gt;Molly Ladd-Taylor, ''Raising a Baby the Government Way: Mothers' Letters to the Children's Bureau, 1915-1932,'' (New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press, 1986), 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1914 [[Emma Octavia Lundberg]] became the first Director of the Social Services Division of the Children's Bureau.&lt;ref name="columbia.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://findingaids.cul.columbia.edu/ead//nnc-rb/ldpd_4079053#history|title=Columbia University Libraries Finding Aids: Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Child labor]] became a focus of the Children's Bureau's efforts beginning around 1915. Between 1915 and 1930, the Bureau published 31 studies examining children's working conditions by visiting child laborers in their homes and workplaces. These studies helped to reveal the prevalence and nature of child labor in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cb100.acf.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/cb_ebook/cb_ebook.pdf|title=The Children's Bureau Legacy: Ensuring the Right to Childhood|format=PDF|pages=39–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1916, Congress passed the [[Keating-Owen Act]], which discouraged child labor. Congress assigned the Children's Bureau the responsibilities of administering and enforcing this law. Chief Lathrop hired noted child-labor reformer [[Grace Abbott]] to lead the Bureau's newly created Child Labor Division in April 1917; however, the law was short-lived. The [[Supreme Court of the United States]] ruled it unconstitutional in June 1918.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cb100.acf.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/cb_ebook/cb_ebook.pdf|title=The Children's Bureau Legacy: Ensuring the Right to Childhood|format=PDF|pages= 40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1921–1929===

In August 1921, Lathrop stepped down as Chief, and [[Grace Abbott]] was appointed to succeed her.&lt;ref&gt;Lindenmeyer, 90-91.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Children's Bureau played a major role in the passage and administration of the [[Sheppard–Towner Act]]. This law, passed in 1921, authorized the first federal grants-in-aid for state-level children's health programs. Projects in most states included some or all of the following:

* [[Midwife]] training programs, licensing, and enforcement
* Parent education through traveling health demonstrations, health centers, home visits, correspondence courses, and classes
* Establishment of standards and licensing procedures for maternity homes
* Data collection on maternal and infant mortality

The program ended in 1929, having helped an estimated 4 million infants and preschool children and approximately 700,000 pregnant women.&lt;ref&gt;Lindenmeyer, 104.&lt;/ref&gt;

Maternal and infant care and child labor were the Bureau's primary focus during its first two decades. However, other topics of research included [[juvenile delinquency]], mother's aid, [[illegitimacy]], [[foster care]], and children's diseases.&lt;ref&gt;Lindenmeyer, 139.&lt;/ref&gt; Notably:

* In 1923, a Children's Bureau-appointed committee established the first-ever standards for effective [[juvenile court]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Dorothy E. |last=Bradbury|title=Four Decades of Action for Children: A History of the Children's Bureau|location=Washington, DC: Children's Bureau|year= 1956|page=19|url=https://www.ssa.gov/history/pdf/child1.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= U.S. Dept. of Labor, Children's Bureau, Juvenile-Court Standards|location=Washington, DC|publisher= U.S. Government Printing Office|year= 1923|url=https://archive.org/details/juvenilecourtsta00comm|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A 1926 bulletin summarizing the history and current state of mothers' aid legislation helped lay the groundwork for the [[Aid to Dependent Children]] provisions in the 1935 [[Social Security Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Emma Octavia Lundberg]]|title=Public Aid to Mothers With Dependent Children: Extent and Fundamental Principles|location=Washington, DC |website=Children's Bureau|year= 1926|url=https://archive.org/details/publicaidtomothe01lund|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cb100.acf.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/cb_ebook/cb_ebook.pdf|title=The Children's Bureau Legacy: Ensuring the Right to Childhood|format=PDF|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The 1920s saw an increased focus on state and county child welfare services. The Bureau published ''Foster-Home Care for Dependent Children'' in 1923.&lt;ref&gt;Bradbury, 33–34, 36.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Children's Bureau conducted a study of [[rickets]], in partnership with the [[Yale School of Medicine]] and the New Haven, Connecticut, Department of Health, that demonstrated the effectiveness of simple prevention methods.&lt;ref&gt;Bradbury, 26–27.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1930–1939===

During the early years of the [[Great Depression]], under President [[Herbert Hoover]], the Children's Bureau helped with government efforts to document families' needs and local relief efforts.&lt;ref&gt;Bradbury, 29-31.&lt;/ref&gt; When Congress established the [[Federal Emergency Relief Administration]] (FERA) in May 1933, the Children's Bureau helped to collect data for the agency to determine how the appropriations would be spent. The Bureau also worked with the FERA to establish the Child Health Recovery Program, providing emergency food and medical care to children in need.&lt;ref&gt;Lindenmeyer, 177-178.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1934, Katherine Lenroot succeeded Abbott as Chief of the Bureau. She held this position until 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Robyn Muncy|title=Creating a Female Dominion in American Reform, 1890-1935|website=Oxford University Press|year=1994|page=151|url=http://findingaids.cul.columbia.edu/ead//nnc-rb/ldpd_4079053}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lenroot, [[Martha May Eliot]], and Grace Abbott worked together to create the child-focused sections of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s Social Security bill:&lt;ref&gt;Lindenmeyer, 179-183.&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Aid to Dependent Children]] provided federal matching grants for local and state mothers' aid programs.
* Maternal and Child Health Care funded clinics, professional education, and medical care for needy children.
* Crippled Children's Services created federal matching grants to help children with physical disabilities.
* Child Welfare Services provided state grants to address the needs of dependent and neglected children.

When the Social Security Act was signed in 1935, the Children's Bureau was granted authority to administer the last three of these programs. (Aid to Dependent Children was administered by the newly established [[Social Security Board]].) The Bureau grew from distributing $337,371 in 1930 to dispensing nearly $11 million in grants by the end of the decade; its staff grew from 143 to more than 400.&lt;ref&gt;Lindenmeyer, 193-194.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the meantime, the Children's Bureau remained active in the campaign against child labor. In 1933, the [[National Industrial Recovery Act]] (NIRA) opened the door for the Bureau to establish industry-specific child labor codes and the first federal minimum age for full-time employment. The NIRA was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in May 1935. Many of its provisions, however, were recreated in the [[Fair Labor Standards Act]] passed three years later.&lt;ref&gt;Lindenmeyer, 196-198.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1940–1956===
Throughout [[World War II]], the Children's Bureau continued to promote the well-being of U.S. children through activities such as developing standards for [[day care]] for children of working mothers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=U.S. Dept. of Labor, Children's Bureau|title=Standards for Day Care of Children of Working Mothers: Report of the Subcommittee on Standards and Services for Day Care Authorized by the Children's Bureau Conference on Day Care of Children of Working Mothers|location=Washington, DC: U.S. Government Printing Office|year= 1942|url=https://archive.org/details/standardsfordayc00unit|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a campaign to focus attention on children's physical and emotional needs during the war.&lt;ref&gt;Lindenmeyer, 223.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the Bureau worked with the U.S. Committee for the Care of European Children to maintain a central register of unaccompanied [[refugee]] children arriving in the United States, to oversee their placement with agencies and foster families, and to establish standards for their care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cb100.acf.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/cb_ebook/cb_ebook.pdf|title=The Children's Bureau Legacy: Ensuring the Right to Childhood|format=PDF|pages=84–85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Children's Bureau's wartime Emergency Maternity and Infant Care (EMIC) program provided for medical, hospital, and nursing care for wives and babies of men in the four lowest pay grades of the Armed Forces. At the time, EMIC was the largest federally funded medical care program ever undertaken in the United States, serving approximately 1.5 million women and babies between 1943 and 1949.&lt;ref&gt;Bradbury, 65-68.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946, the Children's Bureau was folded into the Social Security Administration&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?hl=false&amp;edition=prelim&amp;req=granuleid%3AUSC-prelim-title5a-node83-leaf91&amp;num=0&amp;saved=%7CZ3JhbnVsZWlkOlVTQy1wcmVsaW0tdGl0bGU1YS1ub2RlODMtbGVhZjky%7C%7C%7C0%7Cfalse%7Cprelim|title=Reorganization Plan No. 2 OF 1946, 11 F.R. 7873, 60 Stat. 1095}}&lt;/ref&gt; as part of a massive postwar reorganization of the federal government. In this reorganization, the Bureau lost authority over all labor-related programs. On September 4, 1951, [[Martha May Eliot]] became the Bureau's fourth Chief.

In 1952, the Bureau formed the Special Juvenile Delinquency Project with foundations and other private partners interested in improving the prevention and treatment of delinquency. The Project sponsored public meetings and collaborated on a series of practice guides and professional standards. When the project ended in 1955, the Bureau's work in this area continued through a newly created Division of Juvenile Delinquency Service.&lt;ref&gt;Bradbury, 78–79 and 88–90.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Children's Bureau's [[grant-in-aid]] programs grew significantly in the decade following World War II:

* In maternal and child health, a growing emphasis was placed on preventing [[premature births]] and preserving these fragile infants' health.
* Bureau-funded programs helped to develop treatment options to keep children with disabilities within their own families, schools, and communities. The Crippled Children's Program expanded its reach to help children with [[hearing loss]], [[cerebral palsy]], [[cleft palate]], [[burn]]s, [[epilepsy]], [[congenital heart defect]]s, and other disabilities. 
* Beginning in 1946, federal child welfare funds began to support children in foster care. At the same time, a growing emphasis was placed on providing services, including homemaker services, to help keep families together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cb100.acf.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/cb_ebook/cb_ebook.pdf|title=The Children's Bureau Legacy: Ensuring the Right to Childhood|format=PDF|pages=101–103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1957–1968===

President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] named Katherine Oettinger the fifth Chief of the Children's Bureau on May 17, 1957.&lt;ref&gt;Bradbury, 96.&lt;/ref&gt; Oettinger's tenure as Chief (1957–1968) reflected a growing emphasis on preserving and strengthening families. Under her direction, the Bureau also advocated for greater protection for all parties in an adoption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cb100.acf.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/cb_ebook/cb_ebook.pdf|title=The Children's Bureau Legacy: Ensuring the Right to Childhood|format=PDF|page= 108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was during this period that the Bureau's first research and demonstration grants in child welfare were authorized. Early topics included methods for meeting the needs of disadvantaged preschool children and their families (a precursor to the [[Head Start Program]]), selection of foster parents, and the well-being of adopted children and their families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hearth.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=hearth;idno=4761305_135_004|title=Home Economics Archive: Research, Tradition, History|website=cornell.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1962, amendments to the Social Security Act authorized the Children's Bureau to make its first child welfare training grants to institutions of higher education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hearth.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=hearth;idno=4761305_137_004|title=Home Economics Archive: Research, Tradition, History|website=cornell.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The focus on maternal and infant health programs continued throughout the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cb100.acf.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/cb_ebook/cb_ebook.pdf|title=The Children's Bureau Legacy: Ensuring the Right to Childhood|format=PDF|page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Children's Bureau provided early national leadership in the diagnosis and treatment of [[phenylketonuria]] (PKU) to prevent mental retardation.&lt;ref name="cornell.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hearth.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=hearth;idno=4761305_136_005|title=Home Economics Archive: Research, Tradition, History|website=cornell.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other special health care projects during this period included [[prosthetics]] research, epilepsy treatment, and dissemination of [[vaccines]] for [[polio]] and other childhood diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cb100.acf.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/cb_ebook/cb_ebook.pdf|format=PDF|title=The Children's Bureau Legacy: Ensuring the Right to Childhood|page=111|publisher=cb100.acf.hhs.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Children's Bureau also contributed to a growing awareness of [[child abuse]], or "battered child syndrome" as it was called in the early 1960s. The Bureau held meetings with experts and drafted a model statute that states could use to require doctors and hospitals to report suspected abuse.&lt;ref name="cornell.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hearth.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=hearth;idno=4761305_135_005|title=Home Economics Archive: Research, Tradition, History|website=cornell.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; All states enacted some form of this law by the end of 1967. The Bureau also funded grants to research causes of child abuse and effective prevention methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://cb100.acf.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/cb_ebook/cb_ebook.pdf|format=PDF|title=The Children's Bureau Legacy: Ensuring the Right to Childhood|page=120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1963, the Children's Bureau was moved from the Social Security Administration to the newly created Welfare Administration, reflecting a growing emphasis on coordination between child welfare services and the ADC program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hearth.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=hearth;idno=4761305_136_002|title=Home Economics Archive: Research, Tradition, History|website=cornell.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In keeping with President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]'s priorities, the Bureau's work on juvenile delinquency began to evolve into a focus on prevention and positive youth development. A Youth Services Unit was created in 1966 to encourage more proactive services to help youth transition successfully into adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;http://hearth.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx-?c=hearth;idno=4761305_139_007&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the Children's Bureau continued to study ways to improve the effectiveness of juvenile court systems. In 1967, the Bureau released a revised version of its ''Standards for Juvenile and Family Courts''. These standards, emphasizing the importance of [[due process]] for youth offenders, were cited in the groundbreaking ''[[in re Gault]]'' decision that year.&lt;ref&gt;Children's Bureau, "The Children's Bureau's Job Today" (1969)&lt;/ref&gt;

===1969–1979===

On September 17, 1969, the Children's Bureau was moved to a new Office of Child Development (OCD) within the [[Department of Health, Education, and Welfare]]'s Office of the Secretary. At that time, many of the Bureau's responsibilities were assigned to other areas of the federal government. All health programs, including maternal and child health services, crippled children's services, maternity and infant care projects, and health research, were permanently relocated to the [[Public Health Service]] within the Health Services and Mental Health Administration. Today, these programs still exist within the [[Maternal and Child Health Bureau]], [[Health Resources and Services Administration]], [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]]. The Children's Bureau continued to administer research but was no longer responsible for any direct service programs, including those related to juvenile delinquency, child welfare, or families in the [[AFDC]] program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hearth.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=hearth;idno=4761305_142_006|title=Home Economics Archive: Research, Tradition, History|website=cornell.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; This reorganization essentially narrowed the Bureau's focus to three areas: increasing the number of foster families, helping to find permanent families for children waiting for adoption, and preventing and addressing child abuse and neglect.

In response to rising numbers of children in foster care, Children's Bureau grants during the 1970s investigated in-home services to strengthen families, family-centered casework, permanency planning, family reunification, the needs of children living with relatives, and how to remove barriers to adoption for children with special needs. The Bureau also examined the impact of workforce issues on the foster care system and supported a growing foster parents' movement through conferences and grants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cb100.acf.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/cb_ebook/cb_ebook.pdf|title=The Children's Bureau Legacy: Ensuring the Right to Childhood|format=PDF|pages= 131–132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In adoption policy, the Children's Bureau's focus shifted from finding children for families to finding parents for children. Increased attention was paid to the growing number of hard-to-place children, including those from minority groups, older children, children with disabilities, and sibling groups. The Bureau supported exploration of nontraditional adoption arrangmeents, such as cross-cultural, transracial, single-parent, and subsidized adoption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cb100.acf.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/cb_ebook/cb_ebook.pdf|title=The Children's Bureau Legacy: Ensuring the Right to Childhood|format=PDF|page= 133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Passage of the [[Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act]] (CAPTA) of 1974 created a [[National Center on Child Abuse and Neglect]] (NCCAN) within the Children's Bureau. NCCAN centralized and coordinated the Bureau's growing focus on more effective child abuse prevention, research, state reporting laws, and systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cb100.acf.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/cb_ebook/cb_ebook.pdf|title=The Children's Bureau Legacy: Ensuring the Right to Childhood|format=PDF|pages= 144–146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980–1992===

President [[Jimmy Carter]] signed the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act on June 17, 1980. This landmark law assigned the Children's Bureau additional responsibilities, including reporting to Congress on foster care placements, collecting and publishing data on foster care and adoption, and conducting regular audits of state child welfare programs.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara A. Pine, "Child Welfare Reform and the Political Process," ''Social Service Review 60'', no. 3 (1986).&lt;/ref&gt;

During President [[Ronald Reagan]]'s administration, there was a continued emphasis on family-based services, special needs adoption, and child abuse prevention. Some notable examples of the Bureau's projects during the 1980s include proclamations of the first National Child Abuse Prevention Month and National Adoption Week, establishment of a [[Child Welfare Information Gateway|National Adoption Information Clearinghouse]], and creation of the Children's Justice Act program to help states improve their handling of child abuse cases, with a particular emphasis on [[child sexual abuse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cb100.acf.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/cb_ebook/cb_ebook.pdf|title=The Children's Bureau Legacy: Ensuring the Right to Childhood|format=PDF|pages=164–166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both of the Children's Bureau's present-day data collection systems, the Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System (AFCARS) and the National Child Abuse and Neglect Data System (NCANDS), were developed during this period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cb100.acf.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/cb_ebook/cb_ebook.pdf|title=The Children's Bureau Legacy: Ensuring the Right to Childhood|format=PDF|pages=169–170}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enhanced data collection resulted in a deeper understanding of the families and children affected by child abuse and neglect, foster care, and adoption. This led to legislative and policy changes during the late 1980s and early 1990s, including the establishment of a federal program to support independent living services for youth aging out of the foster care system without permanent families. In response to the [[HIV]] and [[crack epidemic|crack cocaine epidemics]], Congress created the Abandoned Infants Assistance program in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cb100.acf.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/cb_ebook/cb_ebook.pdf|title=The Children's Bureau Legacy: Ensuring the Right to Childhood|format=PDF|pages=171–172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 15, 1991, today's [[Administration for Children and Families]] was created within the Department of Health and Human Services, encompassing ACYF and the Children's Bureau. The same year, NCCAN was moved out from within the Children's Bureau and became a separate entity within ACYF.&lt;ref&gt;''Implementation of the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act of 1988 by the National Center on Child Abuse and Neglect, Testimony Before the Subcommittee on Select Education, Committee on Education and Labor, House of Representatives'' (May 9, 1991) (statement by Joseph F. Delfico, Director of Income Security Issues, Human Resources Division), 3; and follow-up testimony on February 27, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chiefs during this period included:
* John Calhoun (1980–81)
* Clarence E. Hodges (1981–84)
* Dodie Truman Livingston (1984–89)
* Wade Horn (1989–93)&lt;ref&gt;https://cb100.acf.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/cb_ebook/cb_ebook.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===1993–present===

President [[Bill Clinton]] signed the Family Preservation and Support Services Program Act on August 10, 1993, as part of the [[Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993]] (P.L. 103-66). The [[family preservation]] program, administered by the Children's Bureau, authorized services to help families in crisis (such as [[respite care]] and intensive in-home assistance), as well as other forms of [[family support]] and family reunification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Children's Bureau|title=ACYF-PI-94-01|url=http://www.acf.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/cb/pi9401.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; P.L. 103-66 also established the [[Court Improvement Project|Court Improvement Program]], through which the Children's Bureau provides grants to improve state courts' handling of child welfare cases, and provided additional funds for states to improve their child welfare data collection systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cb100.acf.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/cb_ebook/cb_ebook.pdf|title=The Children's Bureau Legacy: Ensuring the Right to Childhood|format=PDF|page=187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Growing awareness of the problem of child abuse and neglect, and particularly child deaths, resulted in many enhancements to prevention, investigation, and prosecution efforts. In 1996, the Children's Bureau created a new program, the Community-Based Family Resource and Support grants, to encourage public and private child abuse prevention and treatment programs to work together more effectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Children's Bureau|title=ACYF-CB-PI-02-04|url=http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/cb/laws_policies/policy/pi/2002/pi0204.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, the Children's Bureau convened an Adoption Program Network to provide input on a new National Adoption Strategic Plan. Around the same time, President Clinton encouraged HHS to develop a plan for doubling the number of adoptions and permanent placements from foster care during the next five years. HHS responded by issuing a report, with the Bureau's assistance, that outlined a series of policy- and practice-related steps toward achieving this goal. These recommendations became the framework for the [[Adoption and Safe Families Act]] (ASFA, P.L. 105-89), signed by President Clinton on November 19, 1997. The Children's Bureau was tasked with helping states bring their laws and policies into compliance with this new federal law, which focused on timely permanence, child well-being, and increased accountability of child welfare systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cb100.acf.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/cb_ebook/cb_ebook.pdf|title=The Children's Bureau Legacy: Ensuring the Right to Childhood|format=PDF|pages= 195–198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ASFA also required HHS to establish outcome measures to track State performance in protecting children. These measures were used in a series of annual reports on national outcomes for child welfare services, first published in 2000. The [[Child and Family Services Review]]s (CFSRs), federal reviews of state child welfare systems based on these outcome measures, began in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cb100.acf.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/cb_ebook/cb_ebook.pdf|title=The Children's Bureau Legacy: Ensuring the Right to Childhood|format=PDF|pages= 200–201}}&lt;/ref&gt; Findings from the first round of CFSRs provided more detailed information about states' strengths and needs, enabling the Bureau to create technical assistance and data collection systems more directly focused on areas of greatest need. Some examples include:

* Creation of topical Quality Improvement Centers (QICs) and Regional Implementation Centers, and increasing coordination among its network of National Resource Centers and Clearinghouses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/cb/assistance|title=Training &amp; Technical Assistance|website=hhs.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Creation of a data collection system to track state independent living services for youth (the National Youth in Transition Database, NYTD, established in October 2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/cb/research-data-technology/reporting-systems/nytd|title=NYTD|website=hhs.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Launch of AdoptUSKids, a comprehensive program to increase adoption opportunities for children in foster care. It includes a national photolisting website, training and technical assistance to states and tribes, and a national recruitment campaign, among other elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://adoptuskids.org/|title=AdoptUSKids|website=adoptuskids.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the first Presidential Proclamation for Child Abuse Prevention Month, OCAN launched a yearlong National Child Abuse Prevention Initiative. Since then, support for child abuse prevention efforts has continued to expand, due in part to growing evidence that home visitation programs can effectively reduce maltreatment and improve outcomes for pregnant mothers and families with young children.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.childwelfare.gov/preventing/preventionmonth/history.cfm&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, another child abuse prevention initiative kicked off at the Bureau's first Network for Action meeting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cbexpress.acf.hhs.gov/index.cfm?event=website.viewArticles&amp;issueid=130&amp;articleID=3297|title=Children's Bureau Express|website=hhs.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recent Children's Bureau initiatives have included the following:

* Since 2000, the Children's Bureau has sponsored conferences and funded discretionary grants on the child welfare staffing crisis. It launched the National Child Welfare Workforce Institute in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cbexpress.acf.hhs.gov/index.cfm?event=website.viewArticles&amp;issueid=101&amp;articleID=2479|title=Children's Bureau Express|website=hhs.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2009, the Bureau funded a new National Resource Center for In-Home Services to support promising practices that can help children remain safely in their homes when their families are involved (or at risk of involvement) with the child welfare system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cbexpress.acf.hhs.gov/index.cfm?event=website.viewArticles&amp;issueid=122&amp;articleID=3044|title=Children's Bureau Express|website=hhs.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Bureau held its first Child Welfare Evaluation Summit in 2009 to explore and promote effective approaches for evaluating child welfare systems, projects, and programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cbexpress.acf.hhs.gov/index.cfm?event=website.viewArticles&amp;issueid=107&amp;articleID=2650|title=Children's Bureau Express|website=hhs.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2010, the Children's Bureau awarded funding to implement the President's Initiative to Reduce Long-Term Foster Care, which seeks to improve outcomes for groups of children who face the greatest barriers to permanency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cb100.acf.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/cb_ebook/cb_ebook.pdf|title=The Children's Bureau Legacy: Ensuring the Right to Childhood|format=PDF|page=219}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2011, the Bureau sponsored a national meeting in partnership with the U.S. Department of Education to improve educational stability and outcomes for children in foster care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cb100.acf.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/cb_ebook/cb_ebook.pdf|title=The Children's Bureau Legacy: Ensuring the Right to Childhood|format=PDF|page=218}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Centennial===

On April 9, 2012, the Children's Bureau marked its 100th anniversary with a ceremony at the [[Hubert H. Humphrey Building]] in Washington, DC. HHS Secretary [[Kathleen Sebelius]], Acting Assistant Secretary for Children and Families [[George Sheldon (politician)|George Sheldon]], and Acting Associate Commissioner Joe Bock were among the speakers at the event. Former ACYF Commissioner Carol Wilson Spigner (Carol Williams) was given a Children's Bureau Centennial Award for her "extraordinary vision and leadership in the field of child welfare services."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cb100.acf.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/cb_ebook/cb_ebook.pdf|title=The Children's Bureau Legacy: Ensuring the Right to Childhood|format=PDF|page= 220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==

In its early years, the Children's Bureau published voluminously on many topics related to children's health and well-being, and it distributed its publications very widely. A full bibliography is impossible here, but an [http://openlibrary.org/authors/OL18005A/United_States._Children%27s_Bureau.?sort=old#editions OpenLibrary search by author] gives some sense of the range of topics.

Some of the Bureau's significant recent publications include the following:
* [https://www.childwelfare.gov/pubs/usermanual.cfm Child Abuse and Neglect User Manual Series] (guides for professionals interested in preventing, identifying, and responding to child maltreatment)
* [http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/cb/research-data-technology/statistics-research/child-maltreatment Child Maltreatment reports] (annual reports of national statistics regarding reports of child abuse and neglect)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2537">'''Vertrokken onbekend waarheen''' (VOW) is a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] term meaning "''left town, destination unknown''", used in [[resident registration]]s for a person who does not live at his registered address in the Netherlands anymore, while it is unknown where he lives now, not even in which country. In most cases the person has not registered that he left; in some cases he did, without specifying a destination. Some have left the country, others still live in the country without being registered. 
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbs.nl/nl-NL/menu/methoden/toelichtingen/alfabet/v/vertrokken-onbekend-waarheen-vow.htm Vertrokken onbekend waarheen (VOW)] on the website of the [[Centraal Bureau voor de Statistiek]]&lt;/ref&gt; Such people are also referred to as ''spookburgers'', or "phantom citizens".

The reasons may include neglect, but also tax evasion and/or avoiding arrest for a crime. The downside for the person is that he cannot get benefits such as (for a Dutch person) getting a passport, and for anyone still living in the country, being allowed to work and to send his children to school, getting social security, etc.

According to a 2011 report by the Dutch Bureau of Statistics, the number of VOWs in the Netherlands has been steadily increasing since 1996, which is not surprising, because those who leave the country and do not return, often remain out-of-sight indefinitely.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbs.nl/NR/rdonlyres/C14F9107-3AB7-42B2-B8C4-799AE3531B0C/0/111122vertrokkenonbekendwaarheenwebversie.pdf 2011 VOW report], {{ISSN|1877-3028}}&lt;/ref&gt; VOWs are mostly male and under the age of 45.

During the [[second world war]] many VOWs referred to Jewish people who left their official address to live somewhere else without registration, to avoid [[deportation]]. This included people who were forced to leave their town and to start living in Amsterdam (from where they would be deported later). In the city of [[Haarlem]] in 1942, 121 Jewish people were registered as "VOW" of the 925 members of the registered local Jewish community, and by the end of the war the total number of Jewish VOWs was estimated to be between 750–1000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wo2kennemerland.nl/Overhalen/vow.htm ''Vertrokken Onbekend Waarheen, De Haarlemse joden in de Tweede Wereldoorlog''], by J.J.

[[File:Francesco Porzio, Monumento alla difesa di Casale, Piazza Castello, Casale Monferrato (Ian Spackman 199xC n25).jpg|thumb|200px|Bronze of a young female warrior in [[Lombards|Lombard]] costume. Francesco Porzio, ''Monumento alla difesa di Casale'', 1897]]

A '''virago''' is a woman who demonstrates exemplary and heroic qualities. The word comes from the Latin word ''virāgō'' (([[genitive case|genitive]] virāginis) meaning variously 'a man-like, vigorous, heroic maiden, a female warrior, heroine..'&lt;ref&gt;{{L&amp;S|virago|virāgō|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; from ''vir'' meaning 'man' (cf. [[virile]] and [[virtue]]) to which the suffix ''-āgō '' is added, a suffix that creates a new noun of the [[Third declension|third declension]] with feminine [[grammatical gender]].

The word ''virago'' has almost always had an association with cultural [[gender role|gender transgression]]. A virago, of whatever excellence, was still identified by her gender. There are recorded instances of viragos (such as [[Joan of Arc]]) fighting battles, wearing men's clothing, or receiving the [[tonsure]].&lt;ref&gt;Jane Tibbetts Schulenburg. ''Forgetful of their sex: female sanctity and society, ca. 500-1100''. University Of Chicago Press, 2001. Page 50. {{ISBN|978-0-226-74054-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''virago'' could also be used disparagingly, to imply that a virago was not excellent or heroic, but was instead violating cultural norms. Thus ''virago'' joined [[pejorative]]s such as ''[[termagant]]'',&lt;ref name=MWdict&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/virago| title=Virago| accessdate=2011-11-25| publisher=Merriam-Webster Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''mannish'', ''amazonian'' and ''[[Shrew (archetype)|shrew]]'' to demean women who acted aggressively or like men.

==History==
Historically, the concept of a virago reaches back into antiquity where [[Hellenistic philosophy]] asserted that elite and exceptionally heroic men had ''[[virtus (virtue)|virtus]]'' ({{lang-el|ἀνδρεία|andreia}}). ''Virtus'' (once again linked to ''vir'', the brave man abiding by society's highest values and ethics as opposed to ''homo'', human being) defined the traits of excellence for a man in ancient Rome (and Greece), including valor and heroism, but also morality and physical strength. Women and non-elite or unheroic men (slaves, servants, craftsmen, merchants) were considered a lesser category, and believed to be less excellent in [[Mos maiorum|Roman morality]]. A woman, however, if exceptional enough could earn the title ''virago''. In doing so, she surpassed the expectations for what was believed possible for her [[gender]], and embodied masculine-like aggression&lt;ref&gt;Virginia Blanton. ''Signs of devotion: the cult of St. Æthelthryth in medieval England, 695-1615'' Pennsylvania State Univ Pr (Trd) (April 30, 2007). Page 168. {{ISBN|978-0-271-02984-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and/or excellence. Virago, then, was a title of respect and admiration. In [[Christianity]], a [[nun]] or holy woman who had become equal in divinity to male [[monks]] through practiced [[celibacy]], exemplary religious practice and devotion, and intact [[virginity]], was considered to have surpassed the limitations of her femaleness and was called ''virago''.&lt;ref&gt;Newman, Barbara. ''From Virile Woman to Woman Christ: Studies in Medieval Religion and Literature''. University of Pennsylvania Press, 1995. Page 5. {{ISBN|978-0-8122-1545-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Laurence Lux-Sterritt. Redefining Female Religious Life: French Ursulines And English Ladies in Seventeenth-Century Catholicism. Ashgate Pub Co (January 30, 2006). Page 61. {{ISBN|978-0-7546-3716-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Firmicus Maternus describes virago as women who take on a man's character and desire intercourse with women like men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Love Between Women: early Christian responses to female homoeroticism|last=Brooten|first=Bernadette|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|year=1996|isbn=978-0-226-07591-4|location=Chicago|pages=135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Standard modern dictionaries define ''virago'' as either, in order of definition, (1) a "loud overbearing woman"; a "shrew".&lt;ref&gt;{Merriam-Webster's Third New International Dictionary of the English Language Unabridged, Copyright (c) 1993 Merriam-Webster, Incorporated, first definition of "virago"}&lt;/ref&gt; or (2) a woman of "great stature, strength, and courage"&lt;ref  name=MWdict /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.answers.com/topic/virago&lt;/ref&gt; Thus virago continues to be associated with both the naming of a woman who has either (1) a domineering, abrasive and spiteful manner, or (2) has risen above cultural and [[sexism|gender stereotypes]] to embody a [[virility|virile]] heroism; for example, the [[British Royal Navy]] christened at least four warships ''[[HMS Virago|Virago]]''.

==Vulgate Bible==
The [[Vulgate]] Bible, translated by [[Jerome]] and others in the 4th century C.E., was an early Latin translation of the Hebrew Bible [[Hebrew Bible|Old Testament]]. In Genesis 2:23, Jerome uses the words ''Vir'' for man and ''Virago'' for "woman" attempting to reproduce a pun on "male" and "female" (''ish'' and ''ishah'') that existed in the Hebrew text.&lt;ref&gt;Saint Jerome, Robert Hayward. ''Saint Jerome's Hebrew questions on Genesis.'' Oxford University Press, USA (August 10, 1995) Page 113. {{ISBN|978-0-19-826350-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Helen Kraus. ''Gender Issues in Ancient and Reformation Translations of Genesis 1-4.'' Oxford University Press, USA (December 17, 2011). Page 182. {{ISBN|978-0-19-960078-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vulgate reads:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Dixitque Adam hoc nunc os ex ossibus meis et caro de carne mea haec vocabitur '''virago''' quoniam de viro sumpta est.''
&lt;br&gt;
"And Adam said: This now is bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called woman, because she was taken out of man."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Middle English poem ''[[Cursor Mundi]]'' retains the Latin name for the woman in its otherwise Middle English account of the creation:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Quen sco was broght be-for adam, '''Virago''' he gaf her to nam; þar for hight sco '''virago''', ffor maked of the man was sco.'' (lines 631–34)
&lt;br&gt;
"When she was brought before Adam, Virago was the name he gave to her; Therefore she is called Virago, For she was made out of the man."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:WH40K battle 8one6.jpg|right|thumb|260px|A game of ''Warhammer 40,000''.]]

'''''Warhammer 40,000''''' is a [[Miniature wargaming|miniature wargame]] that simulates terrestrial battles between futuristic armies. It is one of the most popular miniature wargames in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://icv2.com/articles/markets/view/41010/top-5-non-collectible-miniature-games-spring-2018 |title=Top 5 Non-Collectible Miniature Games - Spring 2018 |website=icv2.com |date=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://icv2.com/articles/markets/view/39858/top-5-non-collectible-miniature-games-fall-2017 |title=Top 5 Non-Collectible Miniature Games - Fall 2017 |website=icv2.com |date=9 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As in other miniature wargames, players use [[Miniature model (gaming)|miniature models]] made of plastic or metal to represent warriors and fighting vehicles. The playing field is a tabletop model of a battlefield, comprising miniature models of buildings, hills, trees, and other landmarks. Players take turns to play through 4 basic game phases. The movement phase where a player can elect to move some or all of his models a set distance measured using tape measures, the psychic phase where any units with psychic ability can attempt to manifest their psychic powers, the shooting phase where the players roll a series of dice to resolve the outcome of any shots fired and the assault phase where the outcome of any physical or hand to hand attacks are determined by dicertain rolls. Once these 4 phases have been resolved then the second player takes his part of the turn and repeats the process. Usually a game of warhammer 40,000 consists of five turns. Depending on the size of game this can take anything from just a single hour to several days. 

Whereas some other miniature wargames are recreations of historical warfare, ''Warhammer 40,000'' has a fictional theme; a blend of science-fiction and [[fantasy]]. The models in the game are a mixture futuristic warriors, aliens, and supernatural monsters, with battles taking place on alien worlds. ''Warhammer 40,000'' is set in the distant future, where a stagnant human civilization is beset by hostile aliens and malevolent supernatural creatures.

''Warhammer 40,000'' was developed by [[Rick Priestley]] as a science-fiction version of ''[[Warhammer Fantasy Battle]]''. The first edition of the rulebook was published in October 1987. The latest edition is the eighth, which was published in June 2017.

''Warhammer 40,000'' has spawned a number of spin-off tabletop games. These include ''[[Battlefleet Gothic]]'', which simulates spaceship combat, and ''[[Space Hulk]]'', which simulates indoors combat. It has also spawned a large number of computer games, such as the ''[[Dawn of War]]'' series.

==Materials==
The rulebooks and models required to play the game are copyrighted and sold exclusively by Games Workshop and its subsidiaries. These and other materials (dice, measuring tools, glue, paints, etc.) all make ''Warhammer 40,000'' expensive as far as gaming hobbies go. A new player can expect to spend at least $500 to assemble enough materials for a "proper" game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Playing field===
[[File:Topaketa errunikoak 2011 0010 (cropped).jpg|right|thumb|250px|Distances between models on the playing field must be measured with tools, as there is no grid.]]
''Warhammer 40,000'' is meant to be played on a tabletop. In contrast to board games, ''Warhammer 40,000'' does not have a fixed playing field. Players are expected to construct their own custom-made playing field using modular terrain models. Games Workshop sells a variety of proprietary terrain models, but players often use generic or homemade ones too. The table can be of any size so long as the players can reach every part of it (the core rulebook recommends a width of four feet&lt;ref&gt;''Warhammer 40,000'' (core rulebook, 8th edition), p 214&lt;/ref&gt;). Unlike certain other miniature wargames (such as ''[[Battletech]]''), ''Warhammer 40,000'' does not use a grid system.  Players must use measuring tape and templates to measure distances. Distances are measured in inches.

===Miniature models===
Games Workshop sells a large variety of plastic and resin models for ''Warhammer 40,000''. Games Workshop doesn't sell ready-to-play models. Rather, it sells boxes of model parts. Players are expected to assemble and paint the miniatures themselves. Games Workshop also sells glue, tools, and acrylic paints for this purpose.

Each miniature model represents an individual warrior or vehicle. In the rulebooks, there is an entry for every type of model in the game that describes its capabilities. For instance, a model of a [[Space Marines (Warhammer 40,000)|Tactical Space Marine]] has a "Move characteristic" of 6 inches, a "Toughness characteristic" of 4, and is armed with a "boltgun" with a range of 24 inches.

===Scale===
Officially, ''Warhammer 40,000'' doesn't have a fixed scale, but the models approximate to a scale ratio of 1:60 (ie 1 inch represents 60 inches).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dakkadakka.com/wiki/en/Scale_Model_Kits_for_40K Scale Model Kits for 40K] - www.dakkadakka.com&lt;/ref&gt;  For instance, a Land Raider tank model is 17cm long but conceptually 10.3m long. A [[Space Marines (Warhammer 40,000)|Space Marine]] model is about 34mm tall.

==Gameplay==
''Note: The overview here references the 8th edition of the core rulebook, published June 2017''
===Assembling armies===
Models are classified into "factions". In a matched game, a player can only use warrior models that are all loyal to a common faction, such as "Imperium" or "Chaos".&lt;ref&gt;''Warhammer 40,000'' (core rulebook, 8th ed.), p 214&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, a player cannot, for example, use a mixture of Eldar and Ork models. Each faction has its own strengths and weaknesses due to the warriors and weapons it has access to. For instance, the Tau faction favors ranged combat because its melee warriors are weak.

The players must agree as to what "points limit" they will play at, which roughly determines how big and powerful their respective armies will be. Each model has a "point value" which roughly corresponds to how powerful the model is, e.g. a [[Space Marines (Warhammer 40,000)|Tactical Space Marine]] is valued at 13 points, whereas a Land Raider tank is valued at 239 points.&lt;ref&gt;''Warhammer 40,000: Index: Imperium 1'' (8th ed.), p 202&lt;/ref&gt; The sum of the point values of a player's models must not exceed his agreed limit. 1,000 points is a common points limit.

At the start of a game, each player places his models in starting zones at opposite ends of the playing field.

===Moving &amp; attacking===
At the start of his turn, a player moves each model in his army by hand across the field. A model can be moved no farther than its listed "Move characteristic".  For instance, a model of a Space Marine can be moved no farther than six inches per turn. If a model cannot fly, it must go around obstacles such as walls and trees.

Models are grouped into "units". They move, attack, and suffer damage as a unit. All models in a unit must stay close to each other; each model in a unit must finish a turn within two inches horizontally and six inches vertically of another model from the unit.

After moving, each unit can attack any enemy unit within range and line-of-fire of whatever weapons and psychic powers its models have.  For instance, a unit of [[Space Marines (Warhammer 40,000)|Space Marines]] armed with boltguns can shoot any enemy unit within 24 inches. The attacking player rolls dice to determine how much imaginary damage his models inflicted on the enemy unit. The attacking player cannot target individual models within an enemy unit; if an enemy unit suffers damage, the enemy player decides which models in the unit suffered injury.&lt;ref&gt;''Warhammer 40,000'' (core rulebook, 8th ed.), p 181&lt;/ref&gt; If a model suffers more injury than its "Wound characteristic" permits, it dies. A dead model of an infantry is removed from the playing field. Disabled vehicles are left on the field (and turned upside down), and serve as obstacles for surviving models.

===Victory conditions===
Victory depends on what kind of "mission" the players choose for their game. It might involve exterminating the enemy, or holding a location on the field for a certain length of time, or retaining possession of a "relic" for a certain length of time.

==Fictional setting==
{{See also|Warhammer 40,000 species}}
''Warhammer 40,000'' is set mostly in the 41st millennium (roughly 38,000 years in the future). Although ''Warhammer 40,000'' is mostly a science-fiction setting, it also adapts a number of tropes from fantasy fiction, such as magic, supernatural beings, daemonic possession, and races such as the Orks and Elves. "Psykers" fill the role of wizards in this setting.

The setting of ''Warhammer 40,000'' is violent and pessimistic. It depicts a future where human scientific and social progress have ceased, and human civilization is close to being destroyed due to warfare with hostile alien races and occult forces. It is a setting where the supernatural is usually malevolent. There are no heavenly beings in the cosmos, only daemons and dark gods, and the cults dedicated to them are growing larger and more powerful.

The source of magic in the setting is a parallel dimension of psychic energy known as "the Warp".  All living creatures have a psychic link to this place, but certain individuals called "psykers" have an especially strong link and can tap its energy to work magic. Humans and some alien races use psykers to circumvent the normal laws of physics, permitting faster-than-light travel and communication. But this power comes at a price: the Warp is full of daemons who use psykers as entrances into realspace. Because of this, psykers must be trained to control their psychic powers and resist Warp predators. Those who fail this training are executed for the safety of all. Those who pass their training are pressed into life-long servitude to the state.

===Influences===
[[Rick Priestley]] cites [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], [[H. P. Lovecraft]], ''[[Dune (franchise)|Dune]]'', ''[[Paradise Lost]]'', and ''[[2000 AD (comics)|2000 AD]]'' as major influences on the setting. Priestley felt that ''Warhammer''{{'}}s concept of Chaos, as detailed by his colleague Bryan Ansell in the supplement ''Realms of Chaos'', was too simplistic and too similar to the works of [[Michael Moorcock]], so he developed it further, taking inspiration from ''[[Paradise Lost]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cardboardsandwich.com/features/blood-dice-and-darkness-how-warhammer-defined-gaming-for-a-generation/ |title=Blood, dice and darkness: how Warhammer defined gaming for a generation |author=Owen Duffy |date=11 December 2015 |quote=“Bryan’s idea of Chaos was very much derived from [science fiction and fantasy author] Michael Moorcock,” he said. “I always thought it was a little too close for comfort, it looked like we were just copying.”&lt;br/&gt;“But I’d always had this sense of Chaos existing as described in Paradise Lost. I’d tried to bring elements of that into the background and gradually change it from a description of demons into a kind of force out of which came realities, a kind of literal primal chaos.”&lt;br/&gt;“Unless you’ve read ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' you don’t get it. The whole Horus Heresy is just a parody of the fall of Lucifer as described by Milton.” |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160518214819/http://cardboardsandwich.com/features/blood-dice-and-darkness-how-warhammer-defined-gaming-for-a-generation/ |archivedate=18 May 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The story of the Emperor's favored sons succumbing to the temptations of Chaos deliberately parallels the fall of Satan in ''Paradise Lost''. The religious themes are primarily inspired by the early history of Christianity and Catholicism.

The Imperium of Man is a critique of organized religion and authoritarian thinking:
{{quote|To me the background to 40K was always intended to be ironic. [...] The fact that the Space Marines were lauded as heroes within Games Workshop always amused me, because they're brutal, but they're also completely self-deceiving. The whole idea of the Emperor is that you don't know whether he's alive or dead. The whole Imperium might be running on superstition. There's no guarantee that the Emperor is anything other than a corpse with a residual mental ability to direct spacecraft. It's got some parallels with religious beliefs and principles, and I think a lot of that got missed and overwritten.|Rick Priestley, in a December 2015 interview with ''Unplugged Games''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cardboardsandwich.com/features/blood-dice-and-darkness-how-warhammer-defined-gaming-for-a-generation/ |title=Blood, dice and darkness: how Warhammer defined gaming for a generation |author=Owen Duffy |date=11 December 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160518214819/http://cardboardsandwich.com/features/blood-dice-and-darkness-how-warhammer-defined-gaming-for-a-generation/ |archivedate=18 May 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;|source=}}

==Factions==
The myriad models available for play in ''Warhammer 40,000'' are divided into "factions."  Under typical circumstances, a player can only use units from the same faction within a single army. For instance, an army cannot include both Ork and Eldar models because Orks and Eldar are enemies in the setting.

===Imperium===
The Imperium of Man is a human empire that spans a majority of the galaxy and has existed for over 10,000 years. The Imperium is mired in a prolonged cultural dark age; although it has access to advanced technology, scientific progress has ceased and these technologies typically date back thousands of years. Imperial society is deeply superstitious, centered on the worship of the Emperor of Mankind, its founder and nominal ruler. Those who do not worship the Emperor, including alien species and human followers of Chaos, are mercilessly persecuted as heretics - with the exception of Mars's Machine Cult, which in the Imperium's early days forged an alliance with Earth and later syncrethized with the Imperial Cult. The irony of the Imperial religion is that the Emperor is not a god but an extremely powerful yet mortal psyker, who himself made severe attempts to establish an atheistic society; furthermore, since the early years of the Imperium, the Emperor survives in an unresponsive state in a life-support machine known as the "Golden Throne", so he rules in name only. However, some speculate the sheer amount of worship from his trillions of followers has caused him to truly ascend to something of a godhood, but this remains unclear.

Of all the factions, the Imperium has the largest catalog of models, which gives Imperial players great flexibility in designing their army.

===Chaos===
Within the parallel dimension known as the Warp dwell the [[Chaos (Warhammer)|Chaos Gods]], who are monomaniacal and depraved entities formed from the emotions and souls of mortals. The Chaos Gods have the ability to twist the minds of mortals, amplifying certain emotional traits and inspiring reverence, like a supernatural form of brainwashing. Worshippers of Chaos (most of whom depicted in the game are human) tend to be insane, violent, and depraved, and they often exhibit grotesque physical mutations such as extra mouths or limbs replaced with tentacles.

Like the Imperium, the forces of Chaos have access to a large variety of models, meaning a Chaos army can be designed for any style of play.

===Eldar===
The [[Eldar (Warhammer 40,000)|Eldar]] are derived from the Elves of ''Warhammer Fantasy''. They are an ancient species of aliens who view humans and other non-Eldar species as vermin. In the distant past, they ruled an empire that dominated the galaxy, but it was destroyed in a magical cataclysm, along with most of the population. The surviving Eldar are divided into the ascetic inhabitants (known simply as "Eldar") of the Craftworlds, massive spacecraft scattered across the galaxy, and the [[Drukhari (Warhammer 40,000)|Dark Eldar]], or Drukhari, a race of sadistic space pirates who inhabit a massive port city hidden within the Warp.

Eldar infantry tend to be highly specialized and relatively frail "glass cannons." Because of their lack of staying power, Eldar armies can suffer severe losses after a bad tactical decision or even unlucky dice rolls, while successful gameplay can involve outnumbered Eldar units which outmaneuver the opponent and kill entire squads before they have a chance to retaliate.

===Tyranids===
The [[Tyranids]] are a mysterious alien race from another galaxy. They migrate from planet to planet, devouring all life in their path. Tyranids are linked by a psychic hive mind in the Warp; individual Tyranid creatures become feral when separated from it. Their technology is entirely biological: their ships and weapons are living components of their bodies.

Tyranids have a preference for melee combat; their infantry units tend to be fast and hard-hitting but frail. They also have low point values, meaning Tyranid armies in the game are typically fairly large. Tyranids have the most powerful counter-measures against enemies with psychic powers: many Tyranid units possess the "Shadow in the Warp" trait, which makes it harder for nearby enemy psykers to use their psychic powers.&lt;ref&gt;''Warhammer 40,000: Index: Xenos 2'' p 85&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tau===
The [[T'au Empire|Tau]], or T'au, are a progressive race of blue-skinned aliens inhabiting a small but growing empire located on the fringes of the Imperium of Man. The Tau Empire is the only faction in the setting that actively integrates alien species into their society; they seek to subjugate all other races for the benefit of all, under an ideology termed "the Greater Good." Though the Tau may appear self-righteous, they and their subjects do enjoy a better quality of life than Imperial citizens, and with the absence of the bigoted tendencies of many other factions, many Imperial worlds have willingly defected to the Tau Empire. 

Tau armies have a strong preference for ranged combat. The Tau do not have any psykers nor units that specialize in countering psykers, which makes them somewhat more vulnerable to psychic attacks. Most Tau vehicles are classified as flyers, skimmers, or jet pack infantry, meaning they can move swiftly over difficult terrain.

===Necrons===
The [[Necrons]] are an ancient race of skeleton-like robots. Millions of years ago, they were flesh-and-blood beings, and they transferred their minds into robot bodies to achieve immortality. However, the process was flawed, and most Necrons became mindless automatons. They are waking up from millions of years of hibernation in underground vaults, and seek to rebuild their old empire.

Necron infantry are characterized by strong ranged firepower, tough armor, and slow movement. They are known primarily for their trademark "gauss" and "reanimation" abilities. As robots made of "living metal," many Necron units possess the ability to reassemble themselves after being slain and fight on. As machines, Necrons possess maximum leadership across all units but are also relatively slow moving outside of some transports. Necrons do not have any psykers, which makes them vulnerable to psychic attacks.

===Orks===
The [[Ork (Warhammer 40,000)|Orks]] are green-skinned genetically-engineered aliens modeled after traditional [[orc]]s of high fantasy. Their culture revolves around war for its own sake, periodically erupting into massive crusades against Imperial planets or other species. However, gains from these wars are often negated due to the general instability of Ork states - it is heavily hinted that, if the Orks ever joined together as one force, they would be even more powerful than the Imperium. They even appear to be mostly impossible to exterminate: upon death, they release plantlike spores that allow them to reproduce, not unlike mushrooms.

In the tabletop game, Ork infantry units are typically slow-moving, tough, and numerous. They have a preference for melee combat, as their ranged units are weak. Thematically, their psyker units, known as  "Weirdboyz," can pose as much of a threat to their own units as the enemy.

==History==
In 1982, [[Rick Priestley]] joined Citadel Miniatures, a subsidiary of Games Workshop that produced miniature figurines for use in ''[[Dungeons and Dragons]]''. [[Bryan Ansell]] (the manager of Citadel) asked Priestley to develop a medieval-fantasy miniature wargame that would be given away for free to customers so as to encourage them to buy more miniatures (''Dungeons and Dragons'', at the time, did not require players to use miniature figurines).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://juegosydados.com/2016/08/26/interview-with-rick-priestley/ |title=Interview with Rick Priestley |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=26 August 2016 |website=juegosydados.com |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result was ''[[Warhammer Fantasy Battle]]'', which was released in 1983 to great success. 

Since before working for Games Workshop, [[Rick Priestley]] had been developing a miniature wargame/RPG hybrid called "Rogue Trader", which mixed science-fiction with classic fantasy elements. Priestley showed his bosses his outline for "Rogue Trader", but they were hesitant because they thought that a science-fiction game wouldn't sell well. His bosses floated the idea of selling cheap kits with which players could convert their ''Warhammer Fantasy'' models into science-fiction models &amp;mdash; e.g. by replacing swords with laser-pistols &amp;mdash; but as time passed, their enthusiasm for "Rogue Trader" grew, and they finally agreed to produce a dedicated line of models for it.

Sometime before "Rogue Trader" was released, Games Workshop signed a contract with [[2000 AD (comics)|2000 AD]] to develop a board game based on ''[[Rogue Trooper]]''.  So as not to confuse customers, Games Workshop renamed Priestley's game "Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader" and marketed it as a spin-off of ''Warhammer Fantasy Battle''. ''Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader'' was released in October 1987.

==Rulebook editions==
===''Rogue Trader'' (1987)===
{{Main|Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader}}
[[File:Rogue trader cover.jpg|upright|thumb|266px|''Rogue Trader'' – the first edition of ''Warhammer 40,000'']]
The first edition of the game, ''[[Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader]]'', was published in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Rogue Trader|first=Rick|last=Priestley|year=1987 |origyear=1992|publisher=Games Workshop|location=Eastwood|isbn=1-872372-27-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Game designer [[Rick Priestley]] created the original rules set (based on the contemporary [[Warhammer Fantasy Battle#Second edition|second edition of ''Warhammer Fantasy Battle'']]) alongside the ''Warhammer 40,000'' gameworld. The gameplay of ''Rogue Trader'' was heavily oriented toward [[Role-playing game|role-playing]] rather than strict wargaming. This original version came as a very detailed, though rather jumbled, rulebook, which made it most suitable for fighting small [[skirmisher|skirmishes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authorlink = [[Jervis Johnson]], Gav Thorpe |date=June 2008|title = The High Lords Speak|journal = [[White Dwarf (magazine)|White Dwarf]] ([[UK]] edition)|issue = 343|pages = 35–36| publisher = [[Games Workshop]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the composition of the units was determined randomly, by rolling [[dice]]. A few elements of the setting (bolters, lasguns, frag grenades, Terminator armour) can be seen in a set of earlier wargaming rules called ''[[Laserburn]]'' (produced by the now defunct company Tabletop Games) written by Bryan Ansell. These rules were later expanded by both Ansell and Richard Halliwell (both of whom ended up working for Games Workshop), although the rules were not a precursor to ''Rogue Trader''.&lt;ref&gt;White Dwarf (June, 2008) pp. 34–35&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, supplemental material was continually published in ''White Dwarf'' magazine, which provided rules for new units and models. Eventually, ''White Dwarf'' provided proper "army lists" that could be used to create larger and more coherent forces than were possible in the main rulebook. These articles were from time to time released in expansion books along with new rules, background materials and illustrations. All in all ten books were released for the original edition of ''Warhammer 40,000'': "Chapter Approved – Book of the Astronomican", "Compendium", "Warhammer 40,000 Compilation", "Waaagh – Orks", two [[Realm of Chaos (Warhammer)|"Realm of Chaos"]] ("Slaves to Darkness" and "The Lost and the Damned"), "'Ere we Go", "Freebooterz", "Battle Manual", and "Vehicle Manual". The "Battle Manual" changed and codified the combat rules and provided updated stats for most of the weapons in the game. The "Vehicle Manual" contained a new system for vehicle management on the tabletop which was intended to supersede the clunky rules given in the base hardback manual and in the red softback compendium, it had an inventive target location system which used acetate crosshairs to simulate weapon hits on the vehicle silhouettes with different armour values for different locations (such as tracks, engine compartment, ammo store, and so on). "Waaagh – Orks" was an introductory manual to Orkish culture and physiology. It contained no rules, but background material. Other Ork-themed books instead were replete with army lists for major Ork clans and also for greenskin pirate and mercenary outfits. The "Realm of Chaos" books were hefty hardback tomes, which included rules for Chaos in ''Warhammer 40,000'', ''Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay'' and ''Warhammer Fantasy Battle'' (3rd edition).

===Second edition (1993)===
The second edition of ''Warhammer 40,000'' was published in late 1993. This new course for the game was forged under the direction of editor [[Andy Chambers]]. The second edition came in a boxed set that included [[Space Marines (Warhammer 40,000)|Space Marine]] and [[Ork (Warhammer 40,000)|Ork]] miniatures, scenery, dice, and the main rules. An expansion box set titled ''Dark Millennium'' was later released, which included rules for psychic powers. Another trait of the game was the attention given to "special characters" representing specific individuals from the background, who had access to equipment and abilities beyond those of others; the earlier edition only had three generic "heroic" profiles for each army: "champion", "minor hero" and "major hero".

===Third edition (1998)===

The third edition of the game was released in 1998 and, like the second edition, concentrated on streamlining the rules for larger battles.&lt;ref name="Priestley 1998"&gt;{{cite book | title = Warhammer 40,000 |first=Rick| last=Priestley |edition=3rd|year=1998|publisher=Games Workshop |location = Nottingham | isbn = 1-84154-000-5 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Third-edition rules were notably simpler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rpg.net/news+reviews/reviews/rev_1577.html|title=Warhammer 40K, 3rd edition|last=Driver|first=Jason|work=RPGnet|publisher=Skotos Tech|accessdate=2008-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rulebook was available alone, or as a boxed set with miniatures of Space Marines and the newly introduced [[Dark Eldar]]. The system of army ''[[Codex (Warhammer 40,000)|'codexes']]''&lt;!--DO not change the word "codexes" to "codices". We are aware it is not proper English, but we are using the word which GW uses for the books, hence the quotes.--&gt; continued in third edition.

Towards the end of the third edition, four new army codexes were introduced: the xeno (that is, alien) races of the Necron and the Tau and two armies of the [[Inquisition (Warhammer 40,000)|Inquisition]]: the Ordo Malleus (called Daemonhunters), and the Ordo Hereticus (called Witchhunters); elements of the latter two armies had appeared before in supplementary material (such as ''Realm of Chaos'' and ''Codex: Sisters of Battle''). At the end of the third edition, these armies were re-released with all-new artwork and army lists. The release of the Tau coincided with a rise in popularity for the game in the United States.&lt;ref name="FT 2002"&gt;{{cite news|url= http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=143827561&amp;sid=2&amp;Fmt=3&amp;clientId=11148&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=PQD |title=Games Workshop runs rings around its rivals |last=Guthrie| first=Jonathon| date=July 31, 2002|work=[[Financial Times]] |pages=20| accessdate=2008-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fourth edition (2004)===
The fourth edition of ''Warhammer 40,000'' was released in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Warhammer 40,000|first=Andy|last=Chambers |author2=Priestley, Rick |author3=Haines, Pete|edition=4th|year=2004|publisher=Games Workshop|location=Nottingham|isbn=1-84154-468-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; This edition did not feature as many major changes as prior editions, and was "backwards compatible" with each army's third-edition codex. The fourth edition was released in three forms: the first was a standalone hardcover version, with additional information on painting, scenery building, and background information about the ''Warhammer 40,000'' universe. The second was a boxed set, called ''Battle for Macragge'', which included a compact softcover version of the rules, scenery, dice, templates, and [[Space Marines (Warhammer 40,000)|Space Marines]] and [[Tyranids|Tyranid]] miniatures. The third was a limited collector's edition.  ''Battle for Macragge'' was a 'game in a box', targeted primarily at beginners. ''Battle for Macragge'' was based on the Tyranid invasion of the Ultramarines' homeworld, Macragge. An expansion to this was released called ''The Battle Rages On!'', which featured new scenarios and units, like the ''[[Tyranid Warrior]]''.

===Fifth edition (2008)===

The fifth edition of Warhammer 40,000 was released on July 12, 2008. While there are some differences between the fourth and fifth editions, the general rule set shares numerous similarities. Codex books designed prior to the fifth edition are still compatible with only some changes to how those armies function.&lt;ref name="White Dwarf July 2008"&gt;{{cite journal |title=in the Pipeline|publisher=[[White Dwarf (magazine)|White Dwarf (UK)]] [editor Mark Latham] |issue=343 |date=July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The replacement for the previous edition's ''Battle for Macragge'' starter set is called ''Assault on Black Reach'', which features a pocket-sized rulebook (containing the full ruleset but omitting the background and hobby sections of the full-sized rulebook), and starter Ork and Space Marine armies. Each army contains a HQ choice, either an Ork Warboss or a Space Marine Captain.

New additions to the rules include the ability for infantry models to "Go to Ground" when under fire, providing additional protection at the cost of mobility and shooting as they dive for cover. Actual line of sight is needed to fire at enemy models. Also introduced is the ability to run, whereby units may forgo shooting to cover more ground. In addition, cover has been changed so that it is now easier for a unit to get a cover save. Damage to vehicles has been simplified and significantly reduced, and tanks may now ram other vehicles.&lt;ref name="White Dwarf July 2008" /&gt; Some of these rules are modeled after rules that existed in the Second Edition, but were removed in the Third. Likewise, 5th edition codexes have seen a return of many units previously cut out in the previous edition for having unwieldy rules. These units have largely been brought back with most of their old rules streamlined for the new edition. Fifth edition releases focused largely on Space Marine forces, including the abolishment of the Daemonhunters in favour of an army composed of Grey Knights, a special chapter of Space Marines, which, in previous editions, had provided the elite choices of the Daemonhunter's army list. Another major change was the shift from metal figures to [[Resin]] kits.

===Sixth edition (2012)===
Sixth edition was released on June 23, 2012. Changes to this edition include the adoption of an optional Psychic Power card system similar to that of the game's sister product ''Warhammer Fantasy Battle'' as well as the inclusion of full rules for flying vehicles and monsters and a major reworking of the manner in which damage is resolved against vehicles. It also includes expanded rules for greater interaction with scenery and more dynamic close-combat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Games Workshop|url=http://www.games-workshop.com/gws/catalog/productDetail.jsp?catId=cat440160a&amp;prodId=prod1620012a}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to updating existing rules and adding new ones, 6th Edition introduced several other large changes: the Alliance system, in which players can bring units from other armies to work with their own, with varying levels of trust; the choice to take one fortification as part of your force; and Warlord traits, which will allow a player's Commander to gain a categorically randomized trait that can aid their forces in different situations. Replacing the "Assault on Black Reach" box set is the "Dark Vengeance" box set which includes Dark Angels and Chaos Space Marine models. Some of the early release box sets of Dark Vengeance contained a limited edition Interrogator-Chaplain for the Dark Angels.

===Seventh edition (2014)===
Announced in ''White Dwarf'' issue 15, pre-orders for May 17 and release date of May 24, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harden|first=Dan|title=White Dwarf, the herald of things to come…|url=http://www.games-workshop.com/en-GB/What's-New-Today-from-the-White-Dwarf-Team/2014/05/01/White-Dwarf-the-herald-of-things-to-come|publisher=Games Workshop|accessdate=11 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 7th edition saw several major changes to the game, including a dedicated Psychic Phase, as well as the way Psychic powers worked overall,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDDcX8a-9uA&amp;list=PLEaPE4sLDA7uq91iOuAUyP2mrBaSOAsv-&amp;index=5|title=NEW!

Tactical Objectives would give the players alternate ways to score Victory Points, and thus win games. These objectives could change at different points during the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RE4H93c7U5Y&amp;list=PLEaPE4sLDA7uq91iOuAUyP2mrBaSOAsv-&amp;index=6|title=NEW!

As well as these additions, the 7th edition provided a new way to organize Army lists. Players could play as either Battle-Forged, making a list in the same way as 6th edition, or Unbound, which allowed the player to use any models they desired, disregarding the Force Organization Chart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JnMByJVUow&amp;list=PLEaPE4sLDA7uq91iOuAUyP2mrBaSOAsv-&amp;index=4|title=NEW!

Additionally, Lord of War units, which are powerful units previously only allowed in large-scale ("Apocalypse") games, are now included in the standard rulebook, and are a normal part of the Force Organization Chart.

===Eighth edition (2017)===
[[File:Warhammer_40,000_rulebook_8th_edition.jpg|right|thumb|266px|Core rulebook, 8th edition.]]
Announced on April 22, 2017&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.warhammer-community.com/2017/04/22/breaking-news/|title=Breaking News! – Warhammer Community|access-date=2017-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;, pre-orders for June 3&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.warhammer-community.com/2017/06/03/dark-imperium-pre-orders/|title=Dark Imperium Pre-orders – Warhammer Community|access-date=2017-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and release date of June 17, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.warhammer-community.com/2017/06/17/new-edition-now-available-read-the-rules-get-the-t-shirtgw-homepage-post-1/|title=New Edition Now Available – Read the Rules, Get the T-Shirt! – Warhammer Community|access-date=2017-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 8th edition was a major revision of the previous edition to the game, making it easier for new players to enter the hobby and start playing. In this respect, the game introduced the Three Ways to Play concept: Open, Matched, and Narrative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.warhammer-community.com/2017/04/24/new-warhammer-40000-three-ways-to-play/|title=New Warhammer 40,000: Three Ways to Play – Warhammer Community|access-date=2017-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The core ruleset was simplified down to 14 pages, as a free PDF booklet available on the Games Workshop website.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.games-workshop.com/en-US/Warhammer-40000-Rules|title=Rules {{!}} Games Workshop Webstore|website=www.games-workshop.com|language=en|access-date=2017-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The more complex rules still remain in the game mechanic, found in the updated hardcover Rulebook. The setting behind 8th Edition has also been updated, with the Galaxy having been split in half by the forces of Chaos&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.warhammer-community.com/2017/04/23/new-warhammer-40000-the-galaxy-mapgw-homepage-post-1/|title=New Warhammer 40,000: The Galaxy Map – Warhammer Community|access-date=2017-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Primarch]] Roboute Guilliman returning to lead the Imperium as the Lord Commander, beginning with reclaiming devastated worlds through the Indomitus Crusade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/989984121|title=DARK IMPERIUM.|last=GUY.|first=HALEY,|date=2018|publisher=GAMES WORKSHOP LTD|isbn=9781784966645|location=[S.l.]|oclc=989984121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 8th Edition also introduced a new box set called "Dark Imperium", which featured a new faction, the Primaris Space Marines, as well as introducing new characters and rules to The Death Guard.

==Supplements and expansions==
There are many variations to the rules and army lists that are available for use, typically with an opponent's consent.&lt;ref&gt;Priestley, Rick; et al. (1998) pp. 270-272&lt;/ref&gt; These rules are found in the Games Workshop publication [[White Dwarf (magazine)|''White Dwarf'']], on the Games Workshop website, or in the Forge World ''[[Imperial Armour]]'' publications.

The rules of ''Warhammer 40,000'' are designed for games between 500 and 2500 points, with the limits of a compositional framework called the Force Organisation Chart making games with larger point values difficult to play. In response to player comments, the ''Apocalypse'' rules expansion was introduced to allow 3000+ point games to be played. Players might field an entire 1000-man Chapter of [[Space Marines (Warhammer 40,000)|Space Marines]] rather than the smaller detachment of around 30–40 typically employed in a standard game. Apocalypse also contains rules for using larger war machines such as Titans. 

''Cities of Death'' (the revamp of ''Codex Battlezone: Cityfight'') introduces rules for [[urban warfare]] and [[guerrilla warfare]], and so-called "stratagems", including traps and fortifications. It also has sections on modeling city terrain and provides examples of armies and army lists modeled around the theme of urban combat. This work was updated to 7th Edition with the release of Shield of Baal: Leviathan.&lt;ref name=CoD&gt;{{Cite book | author=Hoare, Andy | title=Cities of Death| publisher=Games Workshop | location= Nottingham | isbn=1-84154-749-2 | pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Planetstrike'', released 2009, sets rules allowing players to represent the early stages of a planetary invasion. It introduces new game dynamics, such as dividing the players into an attacker and a defender, each having various tactical benefits tailored to their role; for example, the attacker may deep strike all infantry, jump infantry and monstrous creatures onto the battlefield, while the defender may set up all the terrain on the battlefield.

''Planetary Empires'', released August 2009, allows players to coordinate full-scale campaigns containing multiple battles, each using standard rules or approved supplements such as ''Planetstrike'', ''Cities of Death'' or ''Apocalypse''. Progress through the campaign is tracked using hexagonal tiles to represent the current control of territories within the campaign. The structure is similar to ''Warhammer Fantasy's Mighty Empires''.

''Battle Missions'', released March 2010, this expansion contains a series of 'missions' with specific objectives, each 'race' has three specific missions which can be played, these missions are determined by a dice roll and are usually chosen from the two armies being used. They still use the standard rules from the ''Warhammer 40,000'' rule book.

''Spearhead'', released May 2010, allows players to play games with a greater emphasis on armoured and mechanized forces. The most notable change to the game is the inclusion of special "Spearhead Formations;" and greater flexibility in force organization. "Spearhead Formations" represent a new and altogether optional addition to the force organization system standard to ''Warhammer 40,000''. Players now have the ability to use all, part or none of the standard force organization. ''Spearhead'' also includes new deployment options and game scenarios. This expansion is being released jointly through the Games Workshop website, as a free download, and through the company's monthly hobby magazine ''White Dwarf''.

''Death from the Skies'', released February 2013, contains rules for playing games with an emphasis on aircraft. There are specific rules for each race's aircraft, as well as playable missions. A notable inclusion in this release is "warlord traits" for each race that deal specifically with aircraft. This supplement still uses the same rules as the ''Warhammer 40,000'' rulebook. Got updated to 7th Edition with ''Shield of Baal: Leviathan''.

''Stronghold Assault'', released in December 2013, is a 48-page expansion that contains more rules for fortifications in the game, as well as rules for more fortifications that listed in the main 6th Edition Rulebook.

''Escalation'', released December 2013, contains rules for playing games with super heavy vehicles, normally restricted to Apocalypse events, in normal events.

==Spin-off games, novels and others==
Games Workshop has expanded the ''Warhammer 40,000'' universe over the years to include several spin-off games and fictional works. This expansion began in 1987, when Games Workshop asked Scott Rohan to write the first series of "literary tie-ins". This eventually led to the creation of [[Black Library]], the publishing arm of Games Workshop, in 1997. The books published relate centrally to the backstory in the ''Warhammer'' universe. Black Library also publishes ''Warhammer 40,000'' [[graphic novel]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Baxter |first=Stephen |year=2006 |title=Freedom in an Owned World:Warhammer Fiction and the Interzone Generation |journal=Vector: the Critical Journal of the British Science Fiction Association |publisher=The British Science Fiction Association |volume=229 |url=http://www.vectormagazine.co.uk/article.asp?articleID=42 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6C34T196w?url=http://www.vectormagazine.co.uk/article.asp?articleID=42 |archivedate=2012-11-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several popular miniature game spin-offs were also created, including ''[[Space Crusade]]'', ''[[Space Hulk]]'', ''Kill Team'', ''[[Battlefleet Gothic]]'', ''[[Epic (game)|Epic 40,000]]'', ''[[Inquisitor (game)|Inquisitor]]'', ''[[Gorkamorka]]'', ''[[Necromunda]]'' and ''Assassinorum: Execution Force''. A [[collectible card game]], ''[[Dark Millennium]]'', was launched in October 2005 by Games Workshop subsidiary, [[Sabertooth Games]]. The story behind the card game begins at the end of the [[Horus Heresy (fictional event)|Horus Heresy]] arc in the game storyline and contains four factions: the Imperium, Orks, Eldar and Chaos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kaufeld|first=John|author2=Smith, Jeremy |title=Trading Card Games For Dummies|publisher=For Dummies|year=2006|pages=186|isbn=978-0-471-75416-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The album [[Realm of Chaos (album)|''Realms of Chaos: Slaves to Darkness'']] by British [[death metal]] band [[Bolt Thrower]] features lyrics as well as artwork based on the ''Warhammer'' and ''Warhammer 40,000'' brands, with the album's title design being identical to that of the eponymous Games Workshop books.

===Novels===
{{Main|List of Warhammer 40,000 novels}}

Following the 1987 initial release of Games Workshop's ''Warhammer 40,000'' wargame the company began publishing background literature that expands previous material, adds new material, and describes the universe, its characters, and its events in detail. Since 1997 the bulk of background literature has been published by the affiliated imprint [[Black Library]].

The increasing number of fiction works by an expanding list of authors is published in several formats and media, including audio, digital and print. Most of the works, which include full-length novels, novellas, short stories, graphic novels, and audio dramas, are parts of named book series. In 2018, a line of novels for readers aged 8 to 12 was announced, which led to some confusion among fans given the ultra-violent and [[grimdark]] nature of the setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hall|first1=Charlie|title=Warhammer 40,000 is launching a line of young adult fiction and fans are confused|url=https://www.polygon.com/2018/5/22/17380300/warhammer-40000-young-adult-fiction-black-library|accessdate=23 May 2018|work=Polygon|date=22 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Video games===
{{Main|List of Games Workshop video games}}
Games Workshop first licensed [[Electronic Arts]] to produce ''Warhammer 40,000'' video-games, and EA published two games based on [[Space Hulk]] in 1993 and 1995. Games Workshop then passed the license to [[Strategic Simulations]], which published three games in the late 1990s.  After Strategic Simulations went defunct in 1994, Games Workshop then gave the license to [[THQ]], and between 2003 and 2011 THQ published 13 games, which include the ''[[Dawn of War]]'' series. After 2011, Games Workshop changed its licensing strategy: instead of an exclusive license to a single publisher, it now broadly licenses a variety of publishers.&lt;ref&gt;Extra Credits (June 2016).

===Board Games and Roleplaying Games===

Although there were plans to create a full-fledged Warhammer 40,000 "pen and paper" [[role-playing game]] from the beginning,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Edwards| first = Darren | authorlink =  | title = Interview with Rick Priestley  | journal = Making Movies | issue = 3 | pages = 17 | publisher = | year = 1988 | url = | doi = | id = | accessdate =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; these did not come to fruition for many years, until an official ''Warhammer 40,000'' role-playing game was published only in 2008, with the release of ''[[Warhammer 40,000 Roleplay|Dark Heresy]]'' by [[Black Industries]], a GW subsidiary.  This system was later licensed to [[Fantasy Flight Games]] for continued support and expansion.

Formerly Games Workshop licensed a number of ''Warhammer 40K'' themed products to [[Fantasy Flight Games]]. Fantasy Flight Games specializes in board, card and role-play games. Included in the licensed product were:
* ''[[Horus Heresy (2010 board game)|Horus Heresy]]'' – a board game focusing on the final battle of the [[Horus Heresy (fictional event)|Horus Heresy]] the battle for the Emperor's Palace; this game is a re-imagining of a game by the same name created by Jervis Johnson in the 1990s.
* ''Space Hulk: Death Angel'' – a game with a merge of board and card game mechanics, based on the popular "Space Hulk" board game, featuring Space Marines against Genestealers.
* ''Space Hulk: Death Angel, The Card Game'' – the card game version of ''Space Hulk''.  Players cooperate as Space Marines in order to clear out the infestation of Genestealers on a derelict spaceship.
* ''[[Warhammer 40,000: Conquest]]'' – a [[Living Card Game]] where players control various factions of the ''Warhammer 40,000'' setting in order to rule the sector.
* ''Forbidden Stars'' – a board game that pits 4 popular ''Warhammer 40,000'' races against one another to control objectives and secure the sector for themselves.
* ''Relic'' – an adaptation of the board game ''[[Talisman (board game)|Talisman]]'' to the ''Warhammer: 40,000'' setting.
* ''[[Dark Heresy (role-playing game)|Dark Heresy]]'' – a pen and paper role-playing game where players may assume the roles of a cell of Inquisitorial acolytes, or assume a different and equally small-scale scenario following the game's rules. The recommended scenarios and ruleset present a good balance between investigation and combat encounters.
* ''[[Rogue Trader (role-playing game)|Rogue Trader]]'' – a pen and paper role-playing game sharing many of its core mechanics with ''Dark Heresy'', where players assume the roles of Explorers, whose rank and escalated privileges allow for travelling outside of Imperium's borders. Due to extensive expansions upon ''Rogue Trader'', campaigns can be largely different and alternated by game masters. Its most significant difference from any of the other ''Warhammer 40,000 Roleplay'' titles is that it contains rules for capital spaceship design and space combat. 
* ''[[Deathwatch (role-playing game)|Deathwatch]]'' – a pen and paper role-playing game, also sharing many of its core mechanics with ''Dark Heresy'' and ''Rogue Trader'', it allows players to role-play the Space Marines of the Adeptus Astartes, who are the gene-enhanced superhuman elite combat units of the Imperium of Man. In light of this, its ruleset heavily emphasizes combat against difficult or numerically superior enemies, rather than negotiation and investigation, compared to ''Dark Heresy'' or ''Rogue Trader''.
* ''[[Black Crusade (role-playing game)|Black Crusade]]'' – a pen and paper role-playing game, also sharing many of its core mechanics with ''Dark Heresy'', ''Rogue Trader'', and ''Deathwatch'', ''Black Crusade'' allows players to role-play Chaos-corrupted characters. This installment will be concluded with supplements. It is notably different in that it allows much more free-form character development, with experience costs being determined by affiliation with a Chaos God.
* ''Only War'' – The newest installment of FFG's pen and paper Warhammer 40,000 role-play, ''Only War'' puts players in the boots of the Imperial Guard, the foot soldiers of the Imperium of Man. Despite the human-level capabilities of the characters, it also emphasizes combat over interaction, much like Deathwatch.

===Film===
{{Main|Ultramarines: A Warhammer 40,000 Movie}}

On December 13, 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scifimoviepage.com/upcoming/previews/ultramarines.html|title=Ultramarines: A Warhammer 40,000 Movie (2010) - Preview - Sci-Fi Movie Page|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ultramarines: A Warhammer 40,000 Movie'' was released directly to DVD.

There are light-skinned or '''White Angolans''' mostly '''Angolans of European descent''' most significantly from [[Portugal]]. This population also includes [[White Brazilians]] of European Ancestry. Additional white Angolans emigrated from [[Eastern Europe]] when the country was a [[People's Republic of Angola|communist republic]], in particular Russians and Poles. For a long time a significant community of [[Afrikaners]] lived in southern Angola, but most left in and after 1975.

Currently, Whites are a minority ethnic group in Angola, accounting for 1% of the country's population.&lt;ref name=cia&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bc.html |title=CIA - The World Factbook -- Angola |accessdate=2014-01-31 |publisher=CIA | archiveurl= https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ao.html| archivedate= 28 January 2014 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The White population usually speaks [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].&lt;ref name=economist&gt;{{cite web|title=Flight from Angola|url=http://www.economist.com/node/12079340|publisher=economist.com|accessdate=21 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=thisisafrica&gt;{{cite web|last=Ahrens|first=Lula|title=Race relations in Angola|url=http://www.thisisafrica.me/opinion/detail/19594/race-relations-in-angola|publisher=thisisafrica.me|accessdate=21 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mixedindifferentshades&gt;{{cite web|title=Angola|url=http://www.mixedindifferentshades.net/africa/angola.html|publisher=mixedindifferentshades.net|accessdate=21 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Zuruahá''' (also called '''Suruaha''', '''Suruwaha''', '''Zuruaha''', '''Índios do Coxodoá''' &lt;ref&gt;[http://pib.socioambiental.org/pt/povo/zuruaha/984 Zuruahã]&lt;/ref&gt;) is an [[Arawan languages|Arawan language]] spoken in [[Brazil]] by about 130 people.

Zuruahá is mentioned in Kaufman (1994) from personal communication from [[Dan Everett]]. He made first contact with the community (a 3-day hike from Dení territory in [[Amazonas (Brazilian state)|Amazonas]] state) in 1980. The language had not been studied as of 1994, but seems most similar to [[Deni language|Deni]].
