The following is an overview of '''1930 in film''', including significant events, a list of films released and notable births and deaths.

==Events==
* March 10: Release of ''[[Goodbye Argentina]]'' (''Adiós Argentina''), the first Argentine film with a (musical) soundtrack. [[Ada Cornaro]] has her first starring role and [[Libertad Lamarque]] makes her film debut. 
* April 6: [[William Fox (producer)|William Fox]] sells his interest in [[Fox Film]] for $18 million and Harley L. Clarke becomes president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[The Film Daily]]|title=Fox Controversy is Settled|date=April 7, 1930|page=1|url=https://archive.org/stream/filmdailyvolume55152newy#page/853/mode/1up|accessdate=May 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|title=The Fox Reorganization|date=April 9, 1930|page=3|url=https://archive.org/stream/variety98-1930-04#page/n81/mode/1up|accessdate=May 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* September 3: [[The Hollywood Reporter]] is first published.
* September 19: ''[[The Love Parade]]'' receives a record six [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations.
* November 1: ''[[The Big Trail]]'' featuring a young [[John Wayne]] in his first starring role is released in both [[35mm]] and a very early form of [[70mm]] film. It is the first large scale big-budget film of the sound era, costing over $2 million. The film is praised for its aesthetic quality and realism that will not become commonplace until many decades later. However, due to the new film format and the film's release during the [[Great Depression]], the film will go on to become a financial failure at the box office.
* November 15: [[Howard Hughes]] epic film [[Hell's Angels (film)|''Hell's Angels'']] is released and features [[Jean Harlow]] in her first major role as well as some impressive aerial sequences. The film is a huge success and would go on to gross $8 million and launch Harlow as one of the 1930s' biggest stars.

'''''Antônia''''' is a 2006 Brazilian drama [[musical film]] which tells the story of Antônia, an [[Afro-Brazilian]] [[hip-hop music|hip-hop]] [[girl group]] formed by four young women living on a ''[[favela]]'' of [[São Paulo]]. On their way to the mainstream success, they have to face with the [[violence]] near their homes and the ''[[sexism]]'' of the musical business. The film was directed by [[Tata Amaral]] and stars [[Negra Li]], [[Cindy Mendes]], [[Leilah Moreno]] and [[Quelynah]] as the members of the group.

It was shot in [[Santo André]], [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]].&lt;ref name=abc/&gt; The film had its European premiere January 26, 2007 at the 36th [[Rotterdam International Film Festival]], in the section "Cinema of the World: Time &amp; Tide". It was released commercially in the [[United States]] on September 21, 2007, in [[New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]]; [[Newark, New Jersey]], and [[Los Angeles, California]].

The movie, spun off from a 2006 short by Amaral, in turn spun off a [[television series]] from [[02 Filmes]] and [[Rede Globo]] in the filmmaker's native Brazil, starring the same actors in the same roles.&lt;ref name="bo"&gt;[http://www.boxoffice.com/moviedetail.aspx?movieid=5118 ''Box Office'' (Sept. 21, 2007): Review by Tim Cogshell]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
On Vila Brasilândia, a ''[[favela]]'' (shanty town) of São Paulo, four [[Afro-Brazilian]] girls battle to fulfill their dream of making a living off their music. Friends since the childhood, Preta (Negra Li), Bárbarah (Leilah Moreno), Mayah (Quelynah&lt;ref name="bo" /&gt;) and Lena (Cindy Mendes, a.k.a. Maria Madalena,&lt;ref name="bo" /&gt; as Cindy) quit singing the [[backing vocals]] for a male [[rap music|rap]] group and form Antônia, their own group. Discovered by the smooth-talking manager Marcelo Diamante (Thaíde), they begin to sing rap, [[Música popular brasileira|MPB]], [[pop music|pop]] and [[soul music|soul]] in bars and in middle-class parties.

Preta is the deep-voiced mother of a young daughter, Emília (Nathalye Cris). Mayah is the most sexually provocative though single and the high-voiced Lena lives alone with her boyfriend. Bárbarah is the sister of Duda (Chico Santo), an athletic young man with whom she frequently practices [[martial arts]]. Duda's exposed [[homosexuality]] brings a rising action into the story in which his gay partner is killed by a gang and Duda himself injured. Duda, however, recovers; despite this sudden crisis, the future begins to look bright again as the band Antônia begins to take flight.

Just when the dream of the quartet seems to becoming true, their hopes are dashed by daily events, such as [[poverty]], male oppression, and further street violence, which threaten the group and place the young women's friendship in jeopardy.

The conflict begins when Mayah flirts with Preta's estranged husband Ermano (Fernando Macário), and Preta forces Mayah out of the group, deciding to raise Emília by herself with the help of her parents. Next, Lena reveals that she is pregnant and must quit the group after her boyfriend, who originally wanted an abortion, puts pressure on her to do so if they are to raise the child. Bárbarah, meanwhile, is walking home one night with Preta when she is confronted and harassed by a young member of the same gang who attacked her brother; she defends herself using martial arts, throwing him heavily to the ground and resulting in his hospitalization. The boy dies in the hospital and Bárbarah is arrested and imprisoned for [[manslaughter]].

Preta, who struggles with her own personal troubles and the strain of raising her child alone, is the final member of Antônia left. At last unable to feel any desire to continue the group or rise to fame (as Marcelo encourages) if her friends cannot be with her, she goes to Mayah's house to apologize and reconcile. They, along with Lena, visit a grateful, teary-eyed Bárbarah in prison; they decide to spend their time with her writing a song about their experiences.

The scene changes to some point in the future in which all four members of Antônia are back together, singing onstage a liberation-themed song, ''Antônia''.

[[Burkina Faso]] is a small, landlocked country north of [[Ghana]] and south of [[Mali]] and [[Niger]]. Economically, it is one of the four or five poorest countries in the world. Culturally, it is extremely rich. In part this is because so few people from Burkina have become Muslim or Christian.&lt;ref&gt;Roy, Christopher D. "Countries of Africa: Burkina Faso," Art and Life in Africa, {{cite web|url=http://www.uiowa.edu/~africart/toc/countries.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140115211048/http://www.uiowa.edu/~africart/toc/countries.html |archivedate=2014-01-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the ancient artistic traditions for which Africa is so well known have been preserved in Burkina Faso because so many people continue to honor the ancestral spirits, and the spirits of nature. In great part they honor the spirits through the use of masks and carved figures. Many of the countries to the north of Burkina Faso had become predominantly Muslim, while many of the countries to the south of Burkina Faso are heavily Christian. In contrast many of the people of Burkina Faso continue to offer prayers and sacrifices to the spirits of nature and to the spirits of their ancestors. The result is that they continue to use the sorts of art that we see in museums in Europe and America.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

One of the principal obstacles to understanding the art of Burkina Faso, including that of the Bwa, has been a confusion between the styles of the Bwa, "[[gurunsi]]", and [[Mossi people|Mossi]], and a confusion of the [[Bwa people]] with their neighbors to the west the [[Bobo people]]. This confusion was the result of the use by French colonial officers of Jula interpreters at the turn of the century. These interpreters considered the two peoples to be the same and so referred to the Bobo as "Bobo-Fing" and to the Bwa as "Bobo-Oule."  In fact, these two peoples are not related at all. Their languages are quite different, their social systems are quite different, and certainly their art is quite different. In terms of artistic styles the confusion stems from the fact that the Bwa, "gurunsi'" and Mossi make masks that are covered with red white and black geometric graphic patterns. This is simply the style of the Voltaic or Gur peoples, and also includes the [[Dogon people|Dogon]] and other peoples who speak [[Voltaic languages]].&lt;ref name="uiowa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uiowa.edu/~africart/Bobo_Bwa/index.htm |title=Art &amp;amp; Life in Africa - The University of Iowa Museum of Art |publisher=uiowa.edu |accessdate=2014-04-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130630060732/http://www.uiowa.edu/~africart/Bobo_Bwa/index.htm |archivedate=2013-06-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mossi Masks==
[[File:Wan-pesego Mask by Mossi people, late 19th or early 20th century.jpg|thumb|Mossi Mask, late 19th or early 20th century. [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]
Masks occupy an important position in the religious life of the [[Nyonyose]], the ancient farmers and spiritual segment of society among the [[Mossi people]]. The Nakomse (chief class) do not use masks. The use of masks in initiations and funerals is quite typical of all the Voltaic or Gur-speaking peoples, including the Nyonyose, Lela, Winiama, Nouna, Bwaba, and Dogon. Masks appear at burials to observe on behalf of the ancestors that proper burial procedures were carried out. They then appear at several funeral or memorial services held at regular intervals over the years after an elder has died. Masks attend to honor the deceased and to verify that the spirit of the deceased merits admission into the world of ancestors. Without a proper funeral the spirit remains near the home and causes trouble for his/her descendants. Masks are often carved of the wood of ''[[Ceiba pentandra]]'', the faux kapokier. They are carved in three major styles that correspond to the styles of the ancient people who were conquered in 1500 by the invading Nakomse and integrated into a new Mossi society: In the north masks are vertical planks with a round concave or convex face.[[File:Mossi mask.jpg|thumb|A mask at a funeral in the village of Kirsi in 1976.  A black plastic child's doll has been added to the horns to create a karan wemba, to honor a female ancestor.]] In the southwest masks represent animals such as antelope, bush buffalo, and various strange creatures, are painted red, white and black. In the east, around Boulsa [3], masks have tall posts above the face to which fiber is attached, . Female masks have two pairs of round mirrors for eyes, [[File:Mossi Zegedeguin 1977 041.jpg|thumb|Two female Mossi masks of the eastern style at a year-end ceremony in the village of Zegedeguin.]] and small masks, representing Yali, "the child" have two vertical horns. All Nyonyose masks are worn with thick costumes made of the fiber of the wild hemp, ''[[Hibiscus cannabinus]]'', In the old days only the northern Nyonyose in Yatenga and Kaya, and the eastern people around Boulsa allowed their masks to be photographed. The people in the southwest forbade photography because it did not conform to the "yaaba soore", the path of the ancestors. Mask characters include Balinga, the Fulani woman, katre, the hyena, nyaka, the small antelope, Wan pelega, the large antelope, and many others. Now, however, masks from all three areas appear at annual public festivals such festivals as [[SIAO]] (Fr. Salon international de l’Artisanat de Ouagadougou), Week of the Culture, and the Atypical Nights of Koudougou (Les Nuits Atypiques de Koudougou). Each Nyonyose family has its own mask, and they are charged with protecting the masks to this day. Masks are very sacred, and are a link to the spirits of ancestors and of nature.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Roy, Christopher D., "Art of the Upper Volta Rivers," 1987, Paris, Chaffin.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bwa==
The Bwa people live in central Burkina Faso. in years past they have been associated erroneously with the Bobo. In fact they are not related to the Bobo and all, and their languages and culture are quite different. The Bwa people speak a language in the voltaic family of languages, while the Bobo speak a language in the Mande family. The confusion was caused in the past by the inability of the French to distinguish between the two people through their Jula interpreters.

The Bwa people are very similar to other peoples in Burkina Faso in their lack of centralized political authority. Traditionally they have no chiefs. In contrast the Mossi people who live just to the east, have a strong system of chiefs and kings. the result is that while the Mossi are conservative and resistant to change, the Bwa are open-minded and receptive to change.

The Bwa produce several different kinds of masks, including leaf masks dedicated to the god named Dwo, [[File:Leaf masks, Bwa village of Boni, 2006.jpg|thumb|Leaf masks, Bwa village of Boni, 2006]] and wooden masks dedicated to the god Lanle.[[File:Bwa masks, village of Dossi, 1985 2.jpg|thumb|right|Bwa masks, village of Dossi, 1985]] The style of the Bwa is well-known to collectors and scholars around the world. These are wooden masks that represent animals, or tall broad plank masks that represent the spirit Lanle. They are covered with red white and black graphic patterns that represent the religious laws that people in the villages must obey if they are to receive God's blessings. These well-known patterns are not decorative, they are graphic patterns in a system of writing that can be read by anyone in the community who has been initiated. They include black-and-white checkerboards, that look like a target, zig-zag patterns that represent the path of the ancestors, X patterns, and crescents.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

Masks are used in a variety of different contexts. They appear at funerals of senior elders both male and female. They appear at initiation's when young men and women are taught the meanings of the masks and the importance of the spirits and enter adult village society. They even appear on market days when their performances attract visitors to the local market, where they are likely to spend more cash, plus helping the economy of the community.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

==Winiama==
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Een Nunuma of Winiama maskerdanser TMnr 20031577.jpg|thumb|A [[Winiama]] [[African tribal masks|masked]] dancer.]]
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Een Nunuma of Winiama maskerdanser TMnr 20031569.jpg|thumb|A masked Winiama dancer.]]
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Nunuma of Winiama maskerdansers TMnr 20031580.jpg|thumb|left|Two [[Winiama]] [[African tribal masks|masked]] dancers.]]
The region southwest of the Mossi Plateau is occupied by a number of autochthonous farmer groups that are referred to collectively by the Mossi, and in most studies, as gurunsi. The singular, gurunga, indicates that the word is of Moré origin (a word of the Moré "-ga, -se" class). The peoples that comprise the so-called gurunsi peoples include the Nuna, Nunuma, Léla, Winiama, Sisala, Kaséna, Nankana, and Kusasé who share similar Gur languages. The Léla speak Lélé, the Nuna speak Nuni, the Winiama speak Winien, and the Kaséna speak Kasem. Most peoples in the area consider gurunsi a pejorative form of address, and much prefer to be called by their ethnic name. For this reason I have used the name gurunsiin italics and only as a convenient "handle". I have used the name Nunuma to refer to the Nuna peoples northwest of the Black Volta, and Nuna for those southeast of the river, because these peoples are closely related but produce masks that differ slightly in style. This distinction may or may not be valid historically and ethnographically. [[File:Bwa masks, village of Dossi, 1985.jpg|thumb|Bush buffalo mask of the Ivo family, village of Ouri, 1985]] 

The major producers of masks are the Léla, Nunuma, and Winiama in the north, and the Nuna in the south. The Sisala also once used masks, but they have virtually disappeared. The Léla, Nunuma, Winiama and Nuna have influenced the styles, use and meaning of masks among their Bwa and Mossi neighbors. Masks carved of wood represent bush spirits, or spirits that take animal forms. These animal forms may be more naturalistic among the Nunuma and Nuna or more stylized among the Léla and Winiama. The animals that occur most frequently are the antelope, buffalo, bush pig, hornbill, hyena, and the serpent. Some masks represent spirits that have no recognizable animal form. Whatever type is represented, masks have large round eyes surrounded by concentric circles, a short snout for animal masks, or a large, protuberant mouth for supernatural spirits. They are covered with geometric patterns painted red, white, and black, repainted every year, except among the Winiama. Some masks are surmounted by a tall plank.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Masks represent protective spirits that can take animal forms or can appear as strange beings. These spirits watch over a family, clan or community, and, if the rules for their propitiation are followed correctly, provide for the fertility, health, and prosperity of the owners. Thus the masks provide for the continuity of life in the gurunsi world. Almost any unusual event can justify consultations with a diviner and the carving of a mask to represent the spirit that is responsible. When the owner of a mask dies the mask may be passed on to his son, or it may be retired to the lineage spirit house where it slowly decays. Years later a diviner may prescribe a new mask in the same form, and the old mask is taken to the local smith who produces a replacement. Then, such old masks often are sold on the antiquities market. Masks appear at numerous events throughout the dry season. They dance to drive evil forces away from the community. They participate in the funerals of male and female elders. Every three, five, or seven years, the most sacred masks of the community participate, including young men's initiations and every seven years in sacrifices to ensure the well-being of the village. Masks may appear for special reasons throughout the year. Entertainment masks appear on almost every market day to dance for the crowds of visitors. The sacred wankr masks do not appear at such popular, public performances.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Lobi==
The Lobi people live in southwestern Burkina Faso and northern Ivory Coast and Ghana. They are extremely resistant to any sort of centralized political authority. Instead their communities are based on the laws of God. The central character in every Lobi community is the religious specialist named the Thildar.[[File:Lobi artist with a carved stool, 1984.jpg|thumb|Lobi artist with a carved stool, 1984]] This diviner is responsible for communication with the spirits that govern the community and protect members of each family from accidents, disease, violence, and all of the multiple threats people encounter in the harsh environment of West Africa.

The Lobi represent the nature spirits whom they called Thil with figures that can be carved of wood, modeled from clay, or cast in brass. [[File:Shrine in a Lobi home, village of Dako, Burkina Faso.jpg|thumb|right|Shrine in a Lobi home, village of Dako, Burkina Faso]] These figures are called Boteba, and are usually housed in a dark shrine in the most remote space in the back of the family home. Larger clay figures may be kept outside, where because of the material from which they are made they are safe from theft. Brass figures are often worn on the body by members of the family.

Each of these figures displays different gestures or poses, some of them may have two or even three heads, some female figures carry an infant under one arm. These unique features represent the particular talent or power of the spiritual being that they embody. A figure with two heads is twice as quick to recognize threat and to deal with it. A figure with an infant has the power to bring fertility to the women of the family. A figure holding one arm up blocks the entrance of malevolent spirits to the family home.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

==Bobo==
In much of the literature on African art the group that lives in the area of Bobo-Dioulasso is called Bobo-Fing. These people call themselves Bobo. They speak a [[Mandé language]]. The Bobo number about 110,000 people, with the great majority in Burkina Faso, although the area occupied by the Bobo extends north into Mali. The Bobo are far from homogeneous. They are an ancient amalgamation of several peoples who have assembled around a number of core clans that do not preserve any oral traditions of immigration into the area. Their language and culture are more closely related to those of their Mandé neighbors to the north, the Bamana and Minianka, than to their Voltaic neighbors thegurunsi and Mossi, but they should be thought of as a southern extension of the Mandé people, that live in what is now Burkina Faso, rather than an intrusive Mandé group that has recently penetrated the region. Although over 41% of Bobo lineages claim a foreign origin, they also claim to be autochthonous.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Bobo creator God is called Wuro. He cannot be described and is not represented by sculpture. Bobo [[cosmogonic myths]], wuro da fere, describe the creation of the world by Wuro and the ordering of his creations, which are placed in basic opposing pairs: man/spirits, male/female, village/bush, domesticated/wild, culture/nature, safety/danger, cold/hot, farmer/blacksmith. The balances between forces as they were created by Wuro are precarious, and it is easy for man, through the simplest daily acts, to pollute his world and throw the forces out of balance. Even farming, in which crops are gathered in the bush and brought into the village, can unbalance the precarious equilibrium between culture/nature, village/bush. The following summary describes the relationship between Wuro, man, and the smith.

The Bobo use masks in three major contexts: masks appear at harvest time in annual rites called birewa dâga. Masks participate in the male initiation, named yele dâga, which is their major function. Finally, they participate in the burial (syebi) and the funeral rites (syekwe) of people who have been killed by Dwo, or of the elder priests of Dwo. This is a secondary function, and not all masks of all Bobo clans attend these rites. Masks seem to participate in funerals much more frequently in the Syankoma area in the south, near Bobo-Dioulasso, than in the north.[[File:Southern_Bobo_antelope_mask.jpg|thumb|right|An antelope mask performs at a funeral in the southern Bobo village of Dofigso, Spring, 1985]] Leaf masks representing the initial and universal form of Dwo serve to integrate the individual into human society and to link the community of man with the natural world; fiber masks fix the individual in a social grouping, dedicated to one of the later forms of Dwo. These masks are important agents of socialization. The significance of these lessons is impressed on each new generation in the major institution of initiation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The different levels of knowledge are explained to Bobo boys in several steps spread out over a period of fifteen years. Masks play an essential role in initiation because they reestablish and reinforce the cosmic order created by Wuro, and restore the balance and the rhythms of the natural world and of the community. Each of the new steps in the initiation is punctuated by important ceremonies when the initiates dance with several types of masks.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Indonesia===

]]
Communism alongside [[Marxism-Leninism]] were officially banned in [[Indonesia]] following the aftermath of [[30 September Movement|30 September coup attempt]] and the subsequent [[Indonesian mass killings of 1965-1966|anti-communist killings]],  by adoption of ''TAP MPRS'' no. 25/1966 in 1966 and ''Undang Undang'' no. 27/1999 in 1999, which are still in force. The law does not explicitly declare a ban on symbols of Communism, but [[Indonesian police]] frequently use the law to arrest people displaying it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.detik.com/berita/3206373/ini-penjelasan-kapolri-soal-lambang-palu-arit-yang-dilarang-di-indonesia Police chief explanation on banned hammer and sickle symbol in Indonesia] (in Indonesian)&lt;/ref&gt; Some of its violators were people with no knowledge of symbols of Communism, in which cases the authorities frequently freed them with only minor punishment or small fine applied.&lt;ref&gt;[http://regional.kompas.com/read/2016/07/10/19380351/pakai.kaus.bergambar.palu.arit.seorang.petani.ditangkap.polisi Farmer arrested after wearing shirt with hammer and sickle] (in Indonesian)&lt;/ref&gt; However, displaying such symbols in an attempt to intentionally propagate Communist or Marxist-Leninist ideas are an extremely severe offence, even considered as [[treason]] against the country and could be punished by up to 20 years of prison.&lt;ref&gt;[http://m.hukumonline.com/pusatdata/detail/lt50768a41ad5ab/node/657/tap-mprs-no-xxv_mprs_1966-tahun-1966-pembubaran-partai-komunis-indonesia,-pernyataan-sebagai-organisasi-terlarang-diseluruh-wilayah-negara-republik-indonesia-bagi-partai-komunis-indonesia-dan-larangan-setiap-kegiatan-untuk-menyebarkan-atau-mengembangkan-faham-atau-ajaran-komunis_marxisme-leninisme Explanations on banning communism and Marxism-Leninism in Indonesia] (in Indonesian)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wirantaprawira.de/law/criminal/security/index.html Undang Undang no.27/1999, laws on Communism and Marxism-Leninism] (Indonesian)&lt;/ref&gt; This makes Indonesia a country with a very strict [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]] policy compared to other countries that also practiced anti-communism.

Other [[socialist]] and [[left-wing]] related symbols, while not officially prohibited by law (as [[democratic socialism]] itself remained acceptable in the country) are still widely condemned by the Indonesian people and considered as being closely related to Communism in general. These include the [[red star]], the [[socialist heraldry]], the [[red flag (politics)|red flag]], and anthems or slogans such as ''[[The Internationale]]'' and "[[Workers of the world, unite!]]". Despite this, ''The Internationale'' was still remained in use during [[International Labour Day]].

In addition, since the [[Transition to the New Order|New Order regime]] was established in 1967, the [[hammer and sickle]] has become [[social stigma|stigmatized]] in the country, which itself is very similar to how [[Nazi symbolism]] is treated in the West in general. As such, displaying the symbol in public, even without any political intentions, is still regarded as highly offensive. Because of this, Indonesians are usually prone to report those who displayed the symbol in public to the authorities.

Indonesia is the first country in the world to introduce a ban on Communist symbols, not including the [[Axis powers|Axis countries]] during [[World War II]].

In April 2017, Indonesian police detained a [[Malaysians|Malaysian]] tourist at a hotel in [[Mataram (city)|Mataram]] for wearing a T-shirt with an image of the hammer and sickle symbol. The tourist was not aware that Communist symbols were banned in Indonesia. The police seized the T-shirt and released the tourist after giving him a warning.&lt;ref name="Malaysian detained in Indonesia for wearing T-shirt with communist symbol"&gt;{{cite|title = Malaysian detained in Indonesia for wearing T-shirt with communist symbol|url = http://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/malaysian-detained-in-indonesia-for-wearing-t-shirt-with-communist-symbol|publisher = The Straits Times|date = 14 April 2017|accessdate = 17 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2018, a Russian tourist was confronted by locals and reported to the police in [[Bali]] for flying a Soviet [[Banner of Victory]] to commemorate [[Victory Day]].

===United States===
During the [[First Red Scare|Red Scare of 1919–20]] in the [[United States]], many states passed laws forbidding the display of [[red flag (politics)|red flag]]s, including [[Minnesota]], [[South Dakota]], [[Oklahoma]],&lt;ref&gt;Zechariah Chafee, Jr., ''Freedom of Speech'' (NY: Harcourt, Brace and Howe, 1920), 180ff., Appendix V&lt;/ref&gt; and [[California]].  In ''[[Stromberg v. California]]'', the United States Supreme Court held that such laws are unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;''Stromberg v. California'', 283 U.S. 359 (1931).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moldova===
In 2009, such a ban was proposed in [[Moldova]] by parliamentarian Oleg Serebryan,&lt;ref name=pola/&gt; and the law came into effect in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/law/foreign-news/article/moldova-ban-on-use-of-communist-symbols/|title=Moldova: Ban on Use of Communist Symbols - Global Legal Monitor|date=28 November 2012|website=www.loc.gov|accessdate=17 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Constitutional Court of Moldova found it unconstitutional.&lt;ref name=khpg/&gt;  

=== Ukraine ===
In 2015 the Verkhovna Rada passed a [[Ukrainian decommunization laws|law banning communist and nazi symbols]].  Earlier, in 2012, the city of [[Lviv]] in [[Western Ukraine]] banned the public display of Communist symbols.&lt;ref name="runei" /&gt; On December 2015, all communist parties were officially banned in Ukraine.

=== Estonia ===
On November 30, 2006, [[Estonia]]n government signed the draft law to ban politically motivated display of Soviet and Nazi symbols in public places.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rferl.org/a/1073110.html|title=Estonia Proposes Ban On Soviet, Nazi Symbols|website=RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty|accessdate=17 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 24, 2007 it was passed in the first reading by the parliament. The bill specifies those symbols: the flags, coats of arms, other attributes, and slogans of the USSR, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Germany's [[Nazi Party]], and its SS organization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jamestown.org/single/?tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=32427&amp;no_cache=1#.VrGgU_krKM8 "Moscow stung by Estonian ban on totalitarianism's symbols"], ''Eurasia Daily Monitor'', Vol. 4, Issue 19, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; However, it eventually failed the parliamentary committee on the grounds of [[freedom of speech]]. {{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

=== Lithuania ===
[[Lithuania]] banned Soviet and Nazi symbols in 2008 (Article 188&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; of the Code of Administrative Offences) under the threat of a fine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/low/europe/7459976.stm | work=BBC News | title=Lithuanian ban on Soviet symbols | date=2008-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Article 5 of the Law on Meetings prohibits meetings involving Nazist and Soviet imagery.&lt;ref&gt;Joint amicus curiae brief, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2015, the laws were in effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baltictimes.com/audi_featuring_soviet_symbols_banned_from_entering_lithuania/|title=Audi featuring Soviet symbols banned from entering Lithuania|website=www.baltictimes.com|accessdate=17 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Latvia ===
In June 2014, the [[Latvia]]n parliament approved a ban on the display of Soviet and Nazi symbols at all public events. The ban involves flags, anthems, uniforms, Nazi ''[[hakenkreuz]]'' and the Soviet [[hammer and sickle]].&lt;ref name="Latvia Bans Soviet, Nazi Symbols"&gt;{{citation|title = Latvia Bans Soviet, Nazi Symbols|url = http://en.ria.ru/russia/20130621/181788657/Latvia-Bans-Soviet-Nazi-Symbols.html|publisher = RIA Novosti|date = 21 Jun 2013|accessdate = 14 Sep 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Georgia ===
In [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] a ban was introduced in 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/law/foreign-news/article/georgia-ban-on-soviet-symbols-proposed/|title=Georgia: Ban on Soviet Symbols Proposed - Global Legal Monitor|date=8 December 2010|website=www.loc.gov|accessdate=17 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it failed to define the applicable sanctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dfwatch.net/georgia-to-enforce-ban-on-communist-symbols-44753-23804|title=Georgia to enforce ban on communist symbols|date=31 October 2013|publisher=|accessdate=17 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, there was a proposal to amend the ban,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-europe-27272993/communist-symbols-to-be-banned-in-georgia|title=Communist symbols to be banned in Georgia|date=4 May 2014|publisher=|accessdate=17 August 2017|via=www.bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; however as of 2015, the law remained inactive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gcssi.org/wp2/?p=5618|title="Decommunization of Georgia: causes, excuses and permanent interference."|publisher=|accessdate=17 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Czech Republic===
In 1991, in [[Czechoslovakia]] the criminal code was amended with w § 260 which banned propaganda of movements which restricted human rights and freedoms, citing Nazism and Communism. Later the specific mentions of these were removed citing their lack of clear legal definition. However the law itself was recognized as constitutional.&lt;ref name=khpg/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislationline.org/documents/id/17873 "Joint amicus curiae brief for the Constitutional Court of Moldova on the compatibility with European standards"], p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2005, there was a petition in the [[Czech Republic]] to ban the promotion of Communism and in 2007, there was a proposed amendment to the law to ban Communist symbols. Both attempts failed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.expats.cz/prague/article/politics/communists-in-czech-politics/|title=Communists in Czech Politics|publisher=|accessdate=17 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Joint amicus curiae brief, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Poland ===
In 2009, in [[Poland]]&lt;ref name=pola&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rt.com/politics/poland-bans-communist-symbols/|title=New Polish law equates Communist and Nazi symbols|publisher=|accessdate=17 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; § 2 to 4 were added to Article 256, which ban "fascist, communist or other totalitarian symbols" unless used "as part of artistic, educational, collecting or academic activity." On July 19, 2011, the [[Constitutional Tribunal of Poland]] found this ban unconstitutional due to the violation of [[freedom of expression]].&lt;ref&gt;Joint amicus curiae brief, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2017, Poland updated its "[[decommunization]]" legislation to include Soviet propaganda monuments, prompting negative reactions from the Russian government.&lt;ref name="Russia warns Poland not to touch Soviet WW2 memorials"&gt;{{cite|title = Russia warns Poland not to touch Soviet WW2 memorials|url = https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-40775355|publisher = BBC News|date = 31 July 2017|accessdate = 2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hungary ===
[[Hungary]] had a law (Article 269/B of the Criminal Code (2000)) that banned the use of symbols of fascist and communist dictatorships.&lt;ref name=khpg&gt;{{cite web|url=http://khpg.org/en/index.php?id=1430564974|title=Analysis of the Law on Prohibiting Communist Symbols - Human Rights in Ukraine|publisher=|accessdate=17 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hungarian Criminal Code 269 / B. § 1993&lt;/ref&gt; The same year the Constitutional Court upheld the law when it was challenged, claiming that the involved restriction of the [[freedom of expression]] was justified.&lt;ref&gt;Joint amicus curiae brief, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2008 the [[European Court of Human Rights]] considered the challenge of Attila Vajnai who was charged with a misdemeanor for use of the [[red star]] and declared the Hungarian law to be in violation of the freedom of expression. The Court recognized the gross violations by the Nazi and Communist regimes; however, it noted that modern Hungary is a stable democracy with negligible chance of dictatorship, therefore restrictions on the freedom of expression have no justification in the country in the form of a "clear, pressing and specific social need".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politics.hu/20080709/european-court-overturns-hungarian-prohibition-on-communist-star/|title=European court overturns Hungarian prohibition on "communist" star|publisher=|accessdate=17 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually the law was annulled in 2013 by the Constitutional Court, citing the lack of precise definition and the European Court of Human Rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/emergingeurope/2013/02/20/hungary-court-annuls-ban-on-fascist-communist-symbols/|title=Hungary Court Annuls Ban on Fascist, Communist Symbols|first=Veronika|last=Gulyas|date=20 February 2013|publisher=|accessdate=17 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2017, Prime Minister [[Viktor Orbán]] introduced a draft law that outlaws merchandise featuring symbols like the Nazi swastika or the communist five-pointed red star, including the one used by the Dutch brewing company [[Heineken International|Heineken]].&lt;ref name="Hungary threatens to ban Heineken's red star as 'communist'"&gt;{{cite|title = Hungary threatens to ban Heineken's red star as 'communist'|url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/24/hungary-threatens-to-ban-heineken-star-logo-as-communist|publisher = The Guardian|date = 24 March 2017|accessdate = 29 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Romania ===
[[Romania]]n Law 51/1991, Art.3 considers the following as threats to national security: "initiating, organizing, committing or supporting in any way totalitarian or extremist actions of a communist, fascist, legionary or of any other racist, antisemitic, revisionist, separatist nature that can endanger in any way the unity and territorial integrity of Romania, and inciting actions that can endanger the rule of law". However, symbols are not mentioned in the Law.

=== Bulgaria ===
In [[Bulgaria]], lawmakers have voted on 24 November 2016 to make the public display of communist symbols illegal. The law, known as the "Criminal Nature of the Communist Regime", requires that signs and items created during the Communist regime glorifying the former Communist party and its leaders be removed from public places. A ban is introduced on putting such signs in public places.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bta.bg/en/c/DF/id/1466614|title=Parliament Passes Amendments to Act Declaring the Criminal Nature of the Communist Regime in Bulgaria|publisher=|accessdate=7 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.euscoop.com/en/2017/9/7/protests-for-removal-of-soviet-monument|title=New protests for the removal of the statue of the Soviet Army in Sofia|publisher=|accessdate=7 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.calvertjournal.com/news/show/7304/bulgaria-bans-public-display-of-communist-symbols|title=Bulgaria bans public display of communist symbols|publisher=|accessdate=7 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mongolia ===
In 2012, [[Mongolia]] has removed the last statue of [[Vladimir Lenin]] in its capital, [[Ulaanbaatar]]. No law on decommunization in the country will be planned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-19940437|title=Mongolian capital removes Lenin|date=14 October 2012|publisher=|accessdate=7 October 2018|via=www.bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Croatia===
The use of fascist and communist symbols is currently under review in [[Croatia]], one of the discussions being the banning of the [[red star]], a symbol used by the [[Yugoslav People's Army]] during the [[Croatian War of Independence]].&lt;ref name="Croatia to Review Use of Fascist, Communist Symbols"&gt;{{cite|title = Croatia to Review Use of Fascist, Communist Symbols|url = http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/croatian-govt-forms-dealing-with-past-council-03-02-2017|publisher = Balkan Insight|author = Sven Milekic|date = 2 March 2017|accessdate = 8 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Albania===
[[Albania]]'s Institute for Communist Crimes (ICC) proposed a ban on [[Cinema of Albania|communist-era films]], sparking negative reactions from the public.&lt;ref name="Proposed Ban on Albanian Communist Films Sparks Backlash"&gt;{{cite|title = Proposed Ban on Albanian Communist Films Sparks Backlash|url = http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/initiative-to-ban-albanian-communist-movies-couse-backlash-03-15-2017#sthash.CjsDtU7P.dpuf|publisher = Balkan Insight|author = Fatjona Mejdini|date = 16 March 2017|accessdate = 1 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
The [[Flag of East Germany]] was outlawed as an unconstitutional and criminal symbol in West Germany and West Berlin, where it was referred to as the {{lang|de|Spalterflagge}} (secessionist flag) until the late 1960s, when the ban was lifted.

===South Korea===
Similarly, the [[flag of North Korea]] is prohibited in [[South Korea]] as an unconstitutional symbol though some exceptions exist.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-games-asian-northkorea-flag/seoul-reminds-citizens-of-north-korea-flag-ban-idUSKBN0H708Z20140912&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aroundtherings.com/site/A__62654/Title__South-Korea-Makes-Olympic-Exception-for-North-Korean-Flag/292/Articles|title=South Korea Makes Olympic Exception for North Korean Flag|website=aroundtherings.com|accessdate=7 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==European Union==
In January 2005, [[Vytautas Landsbergis]], backed by  Member of the [[European Parliament]] from Hungary, [[Jozsef Szajer]], urged a ban on the Communist symbols in the [[European Union]], in addition to [[Nazi symbols]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baltictimes.com/news/articles/11858/|title=Estonian MEP supports ban of communist symbols|website=www.baltictimes.com|accessdate=17 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2005, the [[European Commission]] rejected calls for a proposed Europe-wide ban on Nazi symbols to be extended to cover Communist Party symbols as well. However this rejection did not rule out the individual states having their own laws in this respect.&lt;ref&gt;JOINT AMICUS CURIAE BRIEF, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4248425.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Europe - EU rejects Communist symbol ban|website=news.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=17 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2013, a group of MEPs including Landsbergis addressed a letter to the President of the European Parliament, in which they requested a ban of symbols of totalitarian regimes.

'''''Body Awareness''''' is a one-act play by [[Annie Baker]]. The play premiered [[Off-Broadway]] in 2008.

==Background==
This play marked the [[Off-Broadway]] debut for Annie Baker.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Kenneth. [http://www.playbill.com/news/article/118319-Bakers-Body-Awareness-With-Clem-Friedman-McCann-Williams-Opens-at-Atlantic-Stage-2 "Baker's 'Body Awareness', With Clem, Friedman, McCann, Williams, Opens at Atlantic Stage 2"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419200714/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/118319-Bakers-Body-Awareness-With-Clem-Friedman-McCann-Williams-Opens-at-Atlantic-Stage-2 |date=April 19, 2014 }} playbill.com, June 4, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The play takes place at Shirley State College in Shirley, Vermont, which "evokes Amherst, Mass., where Ms. Baker... grew up, or Keene State College in New Hampshire, where her mother teaches now." Baker said, "My goal for the play is to not judge anyone, to get at that point where everyone is equally right and equally wrong, so the humor comes from that... I wanted to write a play about issues that wasn’t an 'issue play'."&lt;ref&gt;McGee, Celia.

The play was developed at the 2007 Bay Area Playwrights Festival, San Francisco, California, part of the Playwrights Foundation, and with the support of Atlantic Stage 2.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, Annie.

==Plot synopsis==
The play is set in the fictional small town of Shirley, [[Vermont]]. Phyllis is a professor of psychology, and has organized a campus Body Awareness Week, whose topics range from a dance troupe of refugee [[Palestinians|Palestinian]] children to an eating disorder seminar. She lives with her partner Joyce, a high school social studies teacher, and Joyce's 21-year-old son Jared, from a prior marriage. Jared shows several symptoms of [[Asperger's syndrome]], but he refuses to see a therapist for treatment. Their houseguest is a middle-aged photographer named Frank Bonitatibus, whose artistic photos of nude women offend Phyllis. Frank's presence exacerbates the already existing tension between the three of them, and when Joyce agrees to pose for one of Frank's pictures, this threatens her relationship with Phyllis. Meanwhile, Jared, a self-described [[autodidact]] who works at [[McDonald's]] until he successfully tries to get fired because he hates his co-workers, asks Frank for advice on how to attract women.

[http://www.sfgate.com/performance/article/Body-Awareness-review-Tap-to-lesbian-funny-bone-3002518.php# "''Body Awareness'' review: Tap to lesbian funny bone"] sfgate, December 18, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
[[Charles Isherwood]], in his review for ''[[The New York Times]]'', wrote: "...low-key, engaging new comedy by Annie Baker, a young playwright with a probing, understated voice, making her Off Broadway debut. 'Body Awareness,' which opened Wednesday night at the Atlantic Stage 2, is not exactly a dazzler. It announces its everyday quality almost proudly, as the characters mark the passage of time by writing the days of the week on a chalkboard at the back of the stage. But its quiet rewards steal up on you... Ms. Baker’s generosity of heart, embodied most touchingly in the character of Joyce, and in Ms. Williams’s sensitive performance, invites you to overlook the occasional misstep."&lt;ref name=times/&gt;

In reviewing the 2010 Boston production, the ''ArtsFuse'' reviewer wrote: "Annie Baker’s characters strip themselves down to their raw emotions: this is a play where characters don’t remove their clothes but the walls they’ve built to protect their inner selves. Essentially, the body awareness the script explores is not a matter of a healthy self image but a more nurturing awareness of the bodies and souls around us."&lt;ref name=mendes/&gt;

The reviewer of the 2012 California production for the ''sfgate'' called the play "hilarious" and noted the "...smart, provocative dialogue and even more pointed silences..."&lt;ref name=sfgate/&gt;

In a review of a 2012 production at [[Theatre J]], Washington, D.C. in ''The Washington Post'', Nelson Pressley wrote: "The result in the easygoing 'Body Awareness' is indeed very funny, skewering everything from the professor’s pretensions to the blunt sex talk Frank delivers to Jared... Baker’s dialogue is tart and personable, with just enough unexpected twists in the characterizations to keep you leaning forward... Baker is fast becoming one of the country’s more popular playwrights... and it may be because she has a lovely ability to comically mock types and trends while exposing the raw seams in her characters."&lt;ref&gt;Pressley, Nelson.

'''''control(human, data, sound)''''' is a technology [[performance art|performance]] created by [[Bob van Luijt]] and performed in December 2014. During the performance a dancer wears a "[[Wearable technology|Brain Sense Wearable]]" that sends it's [[Optical character recognition|OCR]] data to a [[Node.js]] application that contains a music composition.&lt;ref&gt;[https://github.com/kubrickology/Brain-Music  Github, ''control(human, data, sound) source'', November 20, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;. In 2015 the work was selected as an awards Finalist for [[Three_Rivers_Arts_Festival|CREATE]] 2015 in Pittsburgh, USA, in the category art+technology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nextpittsburgh.com/events/create-2015-pittsburghs-art-technology-festival/|title=Create 2015|date=2015|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://renateroze.com/films/my-latest-co-produced-project-controlhuman-data-sound/|title=Weblog about CHDS|date=2015|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Background==
The project is an abstraction of the interaction between a human and his/her data.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radio6.nl/mijkeencolive/uitzending/324932 'interview about control(human, data, sound) with Bob van Luijt at NTR (Dutch)'', December 26, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bnr.nl/radio/bnr-digitaal/409079-1501/uitzending-21-januari-gevaren-van-ai-en-muziek-downloaden-uit-het-brein  'interview about control(human, data, sound) with Bob van Luijt at BNR News Radio (Dutch)'', January 21, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; As Bob van Luijt states on chds.io:&lt;ref&gt;[http://chds.io  ''CHDS.io'', December, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; "A human being is able to contextualize data, and it’s the context that gives data its value. But a computer merely observes my data, based on algorithms that try to give context. That context makes sense sometimes, but often it doesn’t make sense at all. In the meantime, the data just sits there as a source of information, without any meaning."

==Reception==
''control(human, data, sound)'' was selected by a jury for exhibition at the following international art and design events:
Venice Art Week - Borders &amp; Disorders, March 13–20, 2015&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lucacurci.com/artexpo/opening-borders-disorders-venice.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lucacurci.com/artexpo/liquid-rooms-venice-feedback.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and Berlin DMY International Design Festival, June 11–14, 2015 &lt;ref&gt;http://dmy2015.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Dīvān-e Kabīr''''' or '''''Dīvān-e Šams-e Tabrīzī''''' ''(The Works of [[Shams Tabrizi|Šams Tabrīzī]])'' ({{Lang-fa|دیوان شمس تبریزی}}) or '''''Dīvān-e Šams''''' is one of [[Mawlānā Jalāl-ad-Dīn Muhammad Balkhī]]'s masterpieces. A collection of lyric poems that contains more than 40,000 verses, it is written in the [[New Persian]] language and is considered one of the greatest works of [[Persian literature]]. 

''Dīvān-e Kabīr'' ("the great divan") contains poems in several different styles of Eastern-Islamic poetry (e.g. odes, eulogies, quatrains, etc.). It contains 44,282 lines (according to Foruzanfar's edition,&lt;ref&gt;Furuzanfar, Badi-uz-zaman. ''Kulliyat-e Shams'', 8 vols., Tehran: Amir Kabir Press, 1957–66. Critical edition of the collected odes, qutrains and other poems of Rumi with glossary and notes.&lt;/ref&gt; which is based on the oldest manuscripts available): 3,229 odes, or ghazals (total lines = 34,662); 44 tarji-bands (total lines = 1698); and 1,983 quatrains (total lines = 7932).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dar-al-masnavi.org/about_divan.html|title=About the Divan|work=dar-al-masnavi.org|accessdate=24 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although most of the poems are in [[New Persian]], there are also some in [[Arabic language|Arabic]], and a small number of mixed Persian/Greek and Persian/Turkish poems. ''Dīvān-e Šams-e Tabrīzī'' is named in honour of Rumi's spiritual teacher and friend [[Shams Tabrizi]].

The following are Greek verses in the poetry of [[Rumi|Mawlana Jalal ad-Din Rumi]] (1207-1273), and his son, [[Sultan Walad]] (1226-1312). The works have been difficult to edit, because of the absence of vowel pointing in most of the verses, and the confusion of scribes unfamiliar with Greek; different editions of the verses vary greatly&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.opoudjis.net/Play/rumiwalad.html|title=Untitled Document|website=www.opoudjis.net|access-date=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6749">'''[[Quebec]]''' has a rich history of [[folklore]], second only to that of the indigenous peoples.

==Folk tales==
Folktales were told by ''Raconteurs'', who could tell tales lasting several hours, or even tell a story over the course of several evenings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Canadian Folk-Life and Folk-Lore |last= Greenough |first=William P. |year=1897 |publisher= George H. Richmond| location= New York, NY.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christian beliefs and [[superstitions]] are present in most Quebec folklore. La [[chasse-galerie]] (the flying canoe) is a well-known folktale about a group of lumberjacks who make a pact with the devil. Demons, witches, and werewolves were common folk motifs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Haase|first=Donald|title=The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Folktales and Fairy Tales: A-F|date=2008|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=9780313334429|page=378}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tales themselves were referred to by the name ''contes''. The traditional ''conte'' form of story-telling has been adapted to the modern novel by writers such as [[Roch Carrier]] and [[Joseph Jean Jacques Ferron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=New|first=William H.|title=Encyclopedia of Literature in Canada|date=2002|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=9780802007612|pages=354–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some folktales are classified under the traditional genre ''Märchen'' ([[fairy tale]]s).

''The Devil at the Dance'' is an example in which the Devil was used to reinforce Christian ideals.  It is the story of a young couple in love. The girl's parents, who are [[Heretics]], refuse the young man as a suitor after discovering he is Christian. When the daughter protests, her mother announces that she would rather have the Devil himself courting her daughter than the young Christian. The following Sunday afternoon, a stranger comes to call: the Devil himself. The three of them-mother, father and daughter-are converted by a priest, and the young couple are then married.&lt;ref name="Chiasson"&gt;{{cite book |title=Les Légendes des îles de la Madeleine |last= Chiasson |first=Père Anselme |year=1969 |publisher= Éditions des Aboiteaux |location= Moncton, N.-B.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are various versions of this tale: One paints the young girl as being very disobedient and flirtatious. Although her parents warn her of the evils of selfishness, her actions do not change. Thus, the Devil was able to enter her home because of her Unchristian behavior. She is saved once again by the Priest, and converts to Christianity.  Another version has the tale happening in a remote village in [[New Brunswick]], but with the same basic storyline. Clearly, the tale evolved depending on what message the storyteller was trying to portray. Regardless of the version, the vast influence of the [[Catholic Church]] is clearly noticeable.

===Lumberjack heroes===
A number of lumberjack heroes were made famous through stories told by itinerant lumberjacks throughout Central Canada and the northern United States. These lumberjack heroes were of French-Canadian origin, and became the basis for many [[Paul Bunyan]] stories. They include tales about [[Joseph Montferrand]] ("Joe Muffreau" or "[[Big Joe Mufferaw]]"), [[Julius Neville]], [[Louis Cyr]], and [[Napoleon La Rue]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Edmonds|first=Michael|title=Out of the Northwoods: The Many Lives of Paul Bunyan, With More Than 100 Logging Camp Tales|date=2010|publisher=Wisconsin Historical Society|isbn=9780870204715|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Superstitions==
Other aspects of [[Quebec]] folklore include superstitions surrounding objects, events, and dreams. In essence, these stem from the belief in both [[Left-Hand Path and Right-Hand Path|White Magic]] and [[Black Magic]], where the former is seen to be beneficial and seeks to bring about positive outcomes, and the latter being essentially malicious, sinister, and all-around [[evil]] (sometimes also called [[witchcraft]]).&lt;ref name="Magic"&gt;{{cite book |title=Magie et Sorcellerie Populaires au Québec |last=DesRuisseaux |first=Pierre |year=1976 |publisher= Triptyque |location=Montreal, Quebec}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Christianity had slowly chipped away at most forms of magic, the populace still held on to its various superstitions for generations. Where religion provides Quebec with a societal structure, these beliefs sought to predict the future, to help alleviate fear of the unknown.&lt;ref name="Magic"/&gt;

Listed below are objects along with a brief description of the superstition associated with them.&lt;ref name="Magic"/&gt;

* Age: A woman, regardless of marital status, will experience an important event during the year following her 31st birthday.
* Bonhomme sept-heures: This man is said to kidnap children who are out of bed after seven o'clock at night. He hides underneath balconies and, equipped with a mask and a bag in which to dispose the children, enters a home after the clock strikes seven.
* Freckles: Having freckles on your arms is a sign of sensuality.
* Hairbrush: If a young woman drops her hairbrush, she'll lose her fiancé.
* Needle:
** If you lose your needle, you will also lose your horse.
** If you drop a needle and it sticks itself into the ground, then someone is thinking ill of you.
* Stars: Count nine stars nine nights in a row, and the last star will point towards your future husband.

==Research into Quebec folklore==
Interest in researching and classifying folklore began during the late 19th century. [[Marius Barbeau]] established himself as one of Canada's foremost folklorists during the early 20th century. [[Luc Lacourcière]] founded the Folklore Archives at [[Laval University]] in [[Quebec City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Linteau|first=Paul-André|title=Quebec Since 1930|date=1991|publisher=James Lorimer &amp; Co.|isbn=9781550282962|page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Laval University offers an academic folklore studies program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Forum Mondial UNESCO-OMPI Sur la Protection Du Folklore|date=1998|publisher=Unesco, World Intellectual Property Organization|isbn=9789280507553|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Folklore Studies Association of Canada]] has also done extensive work related to preserving Quebec folklore.

The [[Association Québécoise des Loisirs Folkloriques]], based in Montreal, runs a number of programs for the public year-round, as well as publishing literature and recordings of folklore. The [[Canadian Museum of History]] in [[Gatineau]], the [[McCord Museum]] in Montreal, and the [[Musée Québécois de culture populaire]] in [[Trois-Rivières]] have extensive holdings related to Quebec folklore and folk artifacts.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7064">'''Francois Dufrene''' ('''François Dufrêne''') (born Paris, September 21, 1930 - died Paris, December 12, 1982) was a French [[Nouveau réalisme|Nouveau realist]] visual artist, [[Lettrist]] and [[Ultra-Lettrist]] [[poet]]. He is primarily known as a pioneer in [[sound poetry]] and for his use of [[décollage]] within [[Nouveau réalisme]].

==Lettrist, Ultra-Lettrist and Nouveau réalisme movements==
Dufrene, along with [[Gil J Wolman]] and [[Brion Gysin]], was one of the stalwarts of the experimental [[poetry]] in France. Dufrene's abstract poetry has led many to regard him as a member of the first generation [[Sound poetry|sound poets]] - following in the footsteps of [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]], [[Richard Huelsenbeck]], [[Hugo Ball]], [[Tristan Tzara]], [[Kurt Schwitters]] and [[Antonin Artaud]] (among others).

Francois Dufrene joined [[Isidore Isou]] and the [[Lettrisme|Lettrist movement]] in 1946 and continued to participate until 1964. Dufrene's talent was evident in the fact that he was already a member of the [[Lettrist]] Group at only 16 years old.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dufrene.net/] François Dufrene bio&lt;/ref&gt;

Dufrene then created a [[phonetic]] poetry which breaks the structures of language he called [[Ultra-Lettrist]]. The Ultra-Lettrist movement was an art form developed by Dufrene along with Jean-Louis Brau and [[Gil J Wolman]] in the 1950s, when they split from Isidore Isou's Lettrism. Dufrene explored vocal possibilities of [[concrete music]], a form of expression based on spontaneity directly recorded to tape, exploiting the [[noise music]] of sound, meaning and [[nonsense]].

Dufrene became friends with [[Yves Klein]] in 1950 and with [[Raymond Hains]] and [[Jacques Villeglé]] in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dufrene.net/] François Dufrene bio&lt;/ref&gt; In 1957 he discovered décollage and in 1960 - with [[Pierre Restany]], [[Yves Klein]], [[Jean Tinguely]], [[Arman]], Hains and Villeglé - and helped found the art group known as [[Nouveau réalisme]]. He is considered one of the important artists in that [[Neo-Dada]] art movement.

==Crirythme performances==
Dufrene earned fame for his performances called ''Crirythmes'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://ubumexico.centro.org.mx/sound/poesia_sonora/Poesia-Sonora_11_Francois-Dufrene.mp3] audio file of ''Crirythme'' on [[Ubuweb]]&lt;/ref&gt; which was in a vocal style of [[sound art]] different from those of his contemporaries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.art-contemporain.eu.org/base/chronologie/1223.html] Main exhibitions&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Crirythme'' work inspired generations of experimental poets, such as [[Henri Chopin]], [[Bernard Heidsieck]], [[Ake Hodell]], [[Charles Amirkhanian]], [[Bob Cobbing]], [[Gregory Whitehead]], [[bpNichol]], [[Tracie Morris]], [[Clive Fencott]], [[Ada Verdun Howell]], [[Mitch Corber]] and [[Jaap Blonk]].

==Film without a screen==
Dufrene is the author of a film called ''Tambours du jugement premier'' (''Drums of the first judgment'') (1952), a fantasy film presented on the sidelines of the Cannes Film Festival the same year. In 1973 it was presented at the Atelier de Création (France Culture), in 1981 as part of the exhibition ''Paris-Paris'' at the [[Centre Georges Pompidou]], and in 1982 at ''Thirty Years of Experimental Cinema in France'' also at the Centre Georges Pompidou.

''Tambours du jugement premier'' is a "film" without screen, projector or film, which eliminates not only the dictatorship of the image over the word, but abandons the projected image altogether, because it’s no longer a matter of perceiving it passively, but rather one of imagining or recreating it. Originally however, Dufrene had indeed anticipated a visual part of the film, never taken to fruition, which was not even complete when the [[Screenplay|script]] was published. The weight of the work lay clearly in its [[soundtrack]], which is all that the initial project finally became. It could therefore be considered a piece of [[sound art]] rather than a [[film]] in the conventional sense.

The first presentation of ''Tambours du jugement premier'' as an ''imaginary film without screen or film'' took place in [[Cannes]] in 1952, at the Alexandre III cinema. The scant resources it required enabled the imaginary film to be improvised. The voices were situated in the four corners of the hall and while the performers recited the texts, the house lights flashed on and off and the [[stage curtain]] opened and closed repeatedly. Dufrene’s ''Tambours du jugement premier'' is a play on the exhaustion of [[cinematographic]] medium, situating itself as a film beyond [[Movie projector|film projection]] machinery. The frustration of the public’s expectations - and its invitation to the viewer’s imagination - is what creates a rupture and liberation from the impositions of the standard image.

The soundtrack for ''Tambours du jugement premier'' contains an important phonetic work which includes almost all of the compositions and scores that Dufrene had produced up to that time in the form of lettrist poems and sung aphorisms as experimental [[sound poetry]]. The compositions renounced any type of discursive content and consisted in improvisations recorded on a [[tape recorder]], employing all the possible capabilities of voice and body.

'''Goodspeed Musicals''' is a non-profit organization dedicated to the preservation and advancement of musical theater and the creation of new works, located in [[East Haddam, Connecticut]]. A distinctive feature of the view from the [[Connecticut River]], the Goodspeed Opera House is the birthplace of some of the world's most famous musicals, including ''[[Annie (musical)|Annie]]'', ''[[Man of La Mancha]]'' and ''[[Shenandoah (musical)|Shenandoah]]''.

== Goodspeed Opera House ==
The Opera House was originally built by a local merchant and banker, William Goodspeed.  Construction began in 1876 and finished in 1877. Despite the name, it was not in fact an [[opera house]], but rather a venue for presenting plays. Its first play, ''Charles II'', opened on October 24, 1877.  After William Goodspeed's death, the opera house fell into disrepair, facing a series of less glamorous uses—from a militia base during [[World War I]] to a [[general store]] and a Department of Transportation storage facility.

The building is unique for a theater.  The theater itself is actually located on the top two floors of the building making for interesting and sometimes difficult scenery and show load-ins.  Scenery is loaded-in from the dock area up a vacant elevator shaft that is now outfitted with a winch system to haul the scenery up to the stage level.  Much care has to be taken in order to get the scenery up the shaft without scratching or ruining the scenery.  One story told around Goodspeed is that while loading in the scenery for Annie's original pre-Broadway run, a strong gust of wind took a large piece of scenery out of the hands of the loaders and blew it into the Connecticut River.

== Goodspeed Musicals ==

Goodspeed Musicals was formed in 1959 by a group of concerned citizens after the state of Connecticut had condemned the building. The state agreed to sell the building to the group for one dollar, provided they acquire enough funding to restore and maintain it. The restoration project took nearly four years, and the Goodspeed Opera House was rededicated on June 8, 1963.  The first performance in the new opera house was ''[[Oh, Lady! Lady!]]'' Under the direction of [[Michael P. Price]] since 1968, Goodspeed Musicals has sent 19 productions to Broadway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/people/Goodspeed-Opera-House/#.U7LoUbGzmYk|title=Goodspeed Opera House Theatre Credits|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Goodspeed productions have won more than a dozen [[Tony Award]]s, while Goodspeed Musicals itself has won two special Tonys, one for outstanding contributions to American Musicals and the other for outstanding achievement by a regional theatre.

In 1984, Goodspeed Musicals added a second performance venue—the [[Norma Terris Theatre]]—in nearby [[Chester, Connecticut]].  While the main stage presents a mixture of revivals and new musicals as part of its 3 production season, The Norma Terris also presents three new musicals each season.  Several original plays debuted there or at the opera house before going on to [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] and winning [[Tony Award]]s.

In addition to the two theaters, Goodspeed Musicals pursues its mission through the Max Showalter Center for Education in Musical Theatre, which offers internships and new writers' residency programs, as well as the Scherer Library of Musical Theatre, which houses the largest musical theatre research facility in the United States. Goodspeed Musicals has also built state-of-the-art production facilities including scenery shops, costume shops and a large costume storage facility.

Critic fellows from the [[Eugene O'Neill Theater Center]] in Waterford, CT travel to the Goodspeed each summer to practice reviewing full productions.

Tours of many of the Goodspeed facilities can be scheduled in advance for a small fee.  Tickets to the opera house or theatre productions should be ordered in advance as most performances in the relatively small theater sell-out quickly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctvisit.com/tours/goodspeed-opera-house-tour/summary/2236 |title=Visit CT |work=Visit CT |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714194527/http://www.ctvisit.com/tours/goodspeed-opera-house-tour/summary/2236 |archivedate=2014-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gordon''', or "Whipped Peter" ([[floruit|fl.]] 1863), was an [[Slavery in the United States|enslaved]] African American who escaped from a Louisiana [[Plantations in the American South|plantation]] in March 1863, gaining freedom when he reached the [[Union Army|Union]] camp near [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]]. He became known as the subject of photographs documenting the extensive scarring of his back from whippings received in slavery. [[Abolitionism in the United States|Abolitionists]] distributed these [[carte de visite]] photographs of Gordon throughout the United States and internationally to show the abuses of slavery.&lt;ref&gt;"The Scourged Slave's Back", ''The Liberator'' (Boston, Massachusetts). September 4, 1863. p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1863 these images appeared in an article about Gordon published in ''[[Harper's Weekly]],'' the most widely read journal during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;Heidler 2002&lt;/ref&gt;  The pictures of Gordon's [[scourge]]d back provided [[Union (American Civil War)|Northerners]] with visual evidence of brutal treatment of slaves and inspired many [[Free negro|free blacks]] to enlist in the [[Union Army]].&lt;ref&gt;Goodyear III, Frank H. "Photography changes the way we record and respond to social issues". Smithsonian Institution&lt;/ref&gt; Gordon joined the [[United States Colored Troops]] soon after their founding, and served as a soldier in the war.&lt;ref&gt;Rymer, Eric. "Ten days from today I left the plantation". Historylink101&lt;/ref&gt;

==Escape==
Gordon escaped in March 1863 from the {{convert|3000|acre|km2|0|adj=on}} plantation of John and Bridget Lyons, who owned him and nearly forty other slaves at the time of the [[1860 United States Census|1860 census]].&lt;ref&gt;Abruzzo, Margaret (March 29, 2011). ''Polemical Pain: Slavery, Cruelty, and the Rise of Humanitarianism.'' JHU Press, p. 309.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Population schedules of the eighth census of the United States, 1860, Louisiana&lt;/ref&gt; The Lyons plantation was located along the west bank of the [[Atchafalaya River]] in [[St. Landry Parish, Louisiana|St. Landry Parish]], between present-day [[Melville, Louisiana|Melville]] and [[Krotz Springs, Louisiana]].&lt;ref&gt;Lyons Shaw, Adonica. "Captain John Lyons of St Landry Parish"&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to mask his scent from the [[bloodhound]]s that were chasing him, Gordon took onions from his plantation, which he carried in his pockets. After crossing each creek or swamp, he rubbed his body with these onions in order to throw the dogs off his scent. He fled over {{convert|40|mi}}&lt;ref&gt;"Civil War CDV of African American Contraband, Baton Rouge, La.". Cowan's Auctions.&lt;/ref&gt; over the course of ten days before reaching [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] soldiers of the [[XIX Corps (Union Army)|XIX Corps]] who were stationed in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]].&lt;ref&gt;"A Typical Negro," ''Harper's Weekly'': 429. July 4, 1863.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrival at Union camp==
[[File:Scourged back by McPherson &amp; Oliver, 1863, retouched.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Photographers of the American Civil War|McPherson and Oliver]]'s photograph of Gordon's scarred back]]
Upon arrival at the Union camp, Gordon underwent a medical examination on April 2, 1863, which revealed severe [[Keloid|keloid scars]] from several whippings. Itinerant photographers William D. McPherson and his partner Mr. Oliver, who were in camp at the time, produced [[carte de visite]] photos of Gordon showing his back.&lt;ref&gt;Shumard, Ann. "Bound for Freedom's Light". Civil War Trust&lt;/ref&gt;

During the examination, Gordon is quoted as saying,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Ten days from to-day I left the plantation. Overseer Artayou Carrier whipped me. I was two months in bed sore from the whipping. My master come after I was whipped; he discharged the overseer.&lt;ref&gt;"Scars of slavery". The National Archives&lt;/ref&gt;  My master was not present. I don't remember the whipping.  I was two months in bed sore from the whipping and my sense began to come – I was sort of crazy.  I tried to shoot everybody.  They said so, I did not know.  I did not know that I had attempted to shoot everyone; they told me so.  I burned up all my clothes; but I don't remember that.  I never was this way (crazy) before.  I don't know what make me come that way (crazy).  My master come after I was whipped; saw me in bed; he discharged the overseer.  They told me I attempted to shoot my wife the first one; I did not shoot any one; I did not harm any one.  My master's Capt. JOHN LYON,&lt;ref&gt;Lyons Shaw, Adonica. "Captain John Lyons of St Landry Parish"&lt;/ref&gt; cotton planter, on [[Atchafalaya Basin|Atchafalya]], near [[Washington, Louisiana]].  Whipped two months before Christmas."&lt;ref&gt;Rymer, Eric. "Ten days from today I left the plantation". Historylink101&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Service in Union Army==
Gordon joined the [[Union Army]] as a guide three months after the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] allowed for the enrollment of [[freedman|freed slave]]s into the military forces. On one expedition, he was taken prisoner by the [[Confederate States Army|Confederates]]; they tied him up, beat him, and left him for dead. He survived and once more escaped to Union lines.&lt;ref&gt;"A Typical Negro," ''Harper's Weekly:'' 429. July 4, 1863.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gordon soon afterwards enlisted in a [[United States Colored Troops|U.S. Colored Troops]] Civil War unit. He was said to have fought bravely as a [[sergeant#United States|sergeant]] in the ''[[United States Colored Troops#Corps d.27Afrique|Corps d'Afrique]]'' during the [[Siege of Port Hudson]] in May 1863.&lt;ref&gt;"A Picture for the Times". ''The Liberator'' (Boston). July 3, 1863. p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first time that African-American soldiers played a leading role in an assault.&lt;ref&gt;Shumard, Ann. "Bound for Freedom's Light". Civil War Trust&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
''[[The Atlantic]]'''s editor-in-chief [[James Bennet (journalist)|James Bennet]] in 2011 noted, "Part of the incredible power of this image I think is the dignity of that man. He's posing. His expression is almost indifferent. I just find that remarkable. He's basically saying, 'This is a fact.'"&lt;ref&gt;Norris, Michele (December 5, 2011). "'The Atlantic' Remembers Its Civil War Stories," [[NPR]]&lt;/ref&gt;

"I have found a large number of the four hundred [[Contraband (American Civil War)|contrabands]] examined by me to be badly lacerated as the specimen represented in the enclosed photograph." -- J.W. Mercer, Asst. Surgeon 47th Massachusetts Volunteers, report to Colonel L.B. Marsh, [[Camp Parapet]], Louisiana, 4 August 1863

|quote   = There has lately come to us, from Baton Rouge, the photograph of a former slave—now, thanks to the Union army, a freeman.  It represents him in a sitting posture, his stalwart body bared to the waist, his fine head and intelligent face in profile, his left arm bent, resting upon his hip, and his naked back exposed to full view.  Upon that back, horrible to contemplate! is a testimony against slavery more eloquent than any words.  Scarred, gouged, gathered in great ridges, knotted, furrowed, the poor tortured flesh stands out a hideous record of the slave-driver's lash.  Months have elapsed since the martyrdom was undergone, and the wounds have healed, but as long as the flesh lasts will this fearful impress remain.  It is a touching picture, an appeal so mute and powerful that none but hardened natures can look upon it unmoved.  However much men may depict false images, the sun will not lie.  From such evidence as this there is no escape, and to see is to believe.  Many, therefore, desired a copy of the photograph, and from the original numerous copies have been taken.

The surgeon of the [[1st Louisiana Native Guard (United States)|First Louisiana regiment, (colored,)]] writing to his brother in the city, encloses this photograph, with these words: –

&lt;blockquote&gt;I send you the picture of a slave as he appears after a whipping.  I have seen, during the period I have been inspecting men for my own and other regiments, ''hundreds of such sights''—so they are not new to me; but it may be new to you.  If you know of any one who talks about the ''humane manner'' in which the slaves are treated, please show them this picture.  It is a lecture in itself.|source = {{cite news|title= —Picture of a Slave|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/824572/the_liberator/?|work=[[The Liberator (anti-slavery newspaper)|The Liberator]]|date=12 June 1863|location=Boston, Massachusetts|page=2}}}}

{{quote box |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center |width = 75% |align=center
|quote  = We received from Baton Rouge the photographic likeness of a slave's naked back, lacerated by the whip ...  We look on the picture with amazement that cannot find words for utterance.  Amazement at the cruelty which could perpetrate such an outrage as this; at the brutal folly, the stupid ignorance, that could permit such a piece of infatuation; at the absence not only of humane feeling, but of economical prudence of common sense, of ordinary intelligence, displayed in such frantic thoughtlessness.  Among what sort of people are such things possible? ... This card-photograph should be multiplied by the hundred thousand, and scattered over the states.  It tells the story in a way that even [[Harriet Beecher Stowe|Mrs. Stowe]] cannot approach; because it tells the story to the eye.  If seeing is believing — and it is in the immense majority of cases — seeing this card would be equivalent to believing things of the slave states which Northern men and women would move heaven and earth to abolish!

'''''Hotel Lobby''''' is an [[oil painting]] on [[canvas]] by American [[Realist visual arts|realist]] painter [[Edward Hopper]]; it is held in the collection of the [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]] (IMA), in [[Indianapolis, Indiana]], United States.&lt;ref name="HotelLobby"&gt;{{cite web | author= | year=2010 | title=Hotel Lobby | work=Collections | publisher =[[Indianapolis Museum of Art]] | url=http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/hotel-lobby-hopper-edward | accessdate = 14 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==

The painting depicts two women and a man in the lobby of a hotel. On the right is a woman with blond hair and a blue dress, sitting with her legs crossed and reading a book. To the left sits an older woman with a red dress, a coat and a hat. A man stands next to her, facing forward, with a suit on and an overcoat draped over his right arm. On the left wall, above the woman, is a framed landscape painting. A clerk behind the reception desk is barely visible in the shadows.&lt;ref name="HotelLobby"/&gt;

==Context==

''Hotel Lobby'' is a signature piece in Hopper's work, displaying his classic themes of [[wiktionary:alienation|alienation]] and [[wiktionary:brevity|brevity]].&lt;ref name="HotelLobby"/&gt; The Hoppers traveled frequently, staying in many motels and hotels throughout his career. This is one of two works in his catalog that depicts a hotel, the other being ''Hotel Window'' (1955). The older couple are believed to represent Hopper and his wife, at that date in their 60s.&lt;ref name="Warkel"&gt;{{cite book |last=Warkel |first=Harriet G. |coauthors= |title=Paper to Paint: Edward Hopper's ''Hotel Lobby'' |publisher=[[Indianapolis Museum of Art]] |year=2009 |month= |isbn=978-0-936260-84-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hotel guests have been described as being "both traveling and suspended in time,"&lt;ref name="HotelLobby"/&gt; reflecting a stoic and dramatic feeling, reminiscent of the [[film noir]] movies Hopper might have seen and the complex structure and feeling of works by [[Edgar Degas]]. 
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Hotel Lobby by Edward Hopper Detail 2.JPG| thumb| Light detail]] --&gt;
The painting utilizes harsh light and rigid lines to create a "carefully constructed" uncomfortable environment. The elevated and [[theatrical]] [[wikt:vantage point|vantage point]] of the painting may be derived from Hopper's love of [[Broadway theatre]] which he often watched from the balcony.&lt;ref name="HotelLobby"/&gt;

===Sketches===

Before he created the ''Hotel Lobby'' Hopper drew ten studies of the work, which are in the collection of the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]], as a gift for his wife, Josephine.&lt;ref name="Warkel"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ArtistPanel"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Meyerowitz |first1=Joel |last2=Segal |first2=George |last3=Bailey |first3=William |last4=Levin |first4=Gail |year=1981 |title=Artists' Panel |journal=[[Art Journal (CAA)|Art Journal]] |volume=41 |issue=2 |pages=151–153 |publisher=[[College Art Association]] |doi= |jstor=776464 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IndianapolisMonth1"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |year=2008 |title=Indianapolis Museum of Art |journal=[[Indianapolis Monthly]] |volume= |issue=September |pages=170 |publisher=[[Emmis Communications]] |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nine of the ten studies are described as:

*Study one was believed to have been executed while Hopper in a hotel lobby observed two seated figures separated by a lamp and table. That wall features a curtained opening, a registration desk and a painting on the wall with the stairwell and railing on the left.
*Study two lacks the table and lamp and includes a second painting, which is separated from the other by a wall sconce, and one figure.
*Study three depicts the stairwell being moved into the background. A figure believed to be male stands in the open doorway to the left of the stairs while a woman sits to the left of the doorway with an empty chair, a painting on the wall and a tiled floor.
*Study four is more refined and has greater detail. The stairs are now removed with three people on the left: two seated figures next to a standing man. The rear doorway has a curtain, columns are on the reception desk, the ceiling appears to be beamed, a second painting is on the wall and a stripe is added to the floor.
*Study five is double sided. One side appears to be an abandoned diagram of a room. The reverse side shows the room with a more detailed revolving door and a return to a single, framed painting on the wall. The reception desk columns are more detailed, and the stripe on the floor is darkened.
*Study six is missing the seated figure from the left with only three remaining and in more detail. The figures and the elevator are in their final locations.
*Study seven shows the fourth figure reappearing by the couple. The ceiling, desk, revolving door, curtained doorway and elevator all have greater detail. The couple also appears to be having a conversation.
*Study eight was created to further detail the older woman's clothing and hands, showing her with a gold [[glove]].
*Study nine is a partial sketch of the younger woman who is reading, which shares the page with sketch eight, in greater detail. Until this sketch the other seated figure was a man.&lt;ref name="Warkel"/&gt;

The coat the older woman wears is based on a [[fur coat]] owned by Hopper's wife, a coat she often wore to openings and a rare find in the Hopper's frugal household.

The red dress that the older woman wears (that Jo, in her journal, describes as "coral") signifies anger and extroversion, while the blue dress worn by the younger woman shows youth and distance. Throughout Hopper's sketches the clerk does not appear until the final painting. Under X-ray it can be seen that Hopper did little to change the canvas once he began work. Most alterations were made in the position of the young woman's head and in outlines of some areas in dark blue paint. A partial underdrawing was found but little detail remains.

Hopper was known to model for himself for figures, as in ''Nighthawks'', leading some to believe he may have modeled for the male figure in ''Hotel Lobby''.

One of the few paintings by Hopper to lack windows, ''Hotel Lobby'' utilizes light from the revolving door and an unseen area from between the ceiling beams.&lt;ref name="Warkel"/&gt;

==Reception==

In 1945 Hopper was awarded the [[Logan Medal of the Arts]] and a $500 [[honorarium]] for ''Hotel Lobby''.&lt;ref name="Levin"&gt;{{cite book |last=Levin |first=Gail |coauthors= |title=Edward Hopper: An intimate biography |publisher=[[University of California Press]] |year=1998 |month= |isbn=0-520-21475-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ArtInstitute1"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Levin |first1=Gail |last2=Hopper |first2=Edward |year=1996 |title=Edward Hopper's "Nighthawks", Surrealism, and the War |journal=Art Institute of Chicago Museum Studies |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=195 |publisher=[[Art Institute of Chicago]] |doi= |jstor=4104321 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting was chosen by a jury composed of [[Juliana Force]], then director of the [[Whitney Museum of American Art|Whitney Museum]], and artists [[Raphael Soyer]] and [[Reginald Marsh (artist)|Reginald Marsh]].&lt;ref name="ArtInstitute1"/&gt; In regards to the painting, Chicago critic [[Clarence Joseph Bulliet|C.J. Bulliet]] stated that "Mr. Hopper is getting a little lazy about the excellent formula he has hit. ''Hotel Lobby'' is typical Hopper, but Hopper that has lost something of its kick."&lt;ref name="Levin"/&gt; The artwork has been compared to Hopper's earlier work ''Summer Interior'' (1909), a work that helped to create Hopper's signature style; an intimate setting, simple lines and geometry, flat color usage and moody light. A shadowy figure and a sensual woman each make another visit in ''Hotel Lobby'' as seen in ''Summer Interior''.&lt;ref name="Warkel"/&gt;

==Ownership and exhibition history==
The painting was in the collection of Henry Hope from [[Bloomington, Indiana]].&lt;ref name="HotelLobby"/&gt;

From June until December 2006 the Whitney Museum, which has the largest holding of Hopper's works in the world, displayed ''Hotel Lobby'' alongside their own works and key loans such as ''[[Nighthawks]]'' (1942) and ''New York Movie'' (1939).&lt;ref name="Whitney"&gt;{{cite web | author= | year=2011 | title=Edward Hopper | work=Exhibitions | publisher=Whitney Museum of American Art | url=http://whitney.org/Exhibitions/EdwardHopper | accessdate=14 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vogel"&gt;{{cite news |title=Hoppers Come and Go In a Whitney Show |author=Carol Vogel |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=6 October 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ronnen"&gt;{{cite news |title=Tiroche sale opens tomorrow |author=Meir Ronnen |newspaper=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |date=7 July 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Hotel Lobby'' is currently on display in the Indianapolis Museum of Art's [[American scene painting|American Scene]] Gallery.&lt;ref name="HotelLobby"/&gt; In 2008 the IMA exhibited the work alongside the ten studies on loan from the Whitney in ''Edward Hopper: Paper to Paint'', which ran until January 2009.&lt;ref name="IndianapolisMonth1"/&gt;

===Publications===

In 1996 ''Hotel Lobby'' was used as the paperback cover for the book ''Hotel Paradise'' by [[Martha Grimes]].&lt;ref name="Grimes"&gt;{{cite book |last=Grimes |first=Martha |coauthors= |title=Hotel Paradise |publisher=[[Random House]] |year=1996 |month= |isbn=978-0-345-39425-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting also appears in ''City Limits: Crime, consumer culture and the urban experience'' by [[Keith Hayward]].&lt;ref name="Hayward"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hayward |first=Keith |coauthors= |title=City limits: Crime, consumer culture and the urban experience |publisher=[[Psychology Press]] |year=2004 |month= |isbn=1-904385-03-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Iași National Theatre''' ([[Romanian language|Romanian]]: Teatrul Național Vasile Alecsandri) in [[Iași]], [[Romania]], is the oldest national theatre and one of the most prestigious theatrical institutions in Romania. In 1956, it was given the name of the renowned Romanian playwright and poet [[Vasile Alecsandri]].

==History==
[[File:TNI 1846.jpg|thumb|left|The old building of the National Theatre, 1846]]
One of the first theatrical performance in Romanian language, was organized by [[Gheorghe Asachi]], and held in the capital of [[Moldavia]], Jassy/Iași, on 27 September 1816.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-0mJ7blUGtQC&amp;pg=PA166&amp;lpg=PA166&amp;dq=first+theatrical+performance+in+Romanian&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=tiSaCCg2J7&amp;sig=-4Md-LKCHVTN2O_rilvV5Ta-m9c&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=NZAvTK8chJY468DZ1AE&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=first%20theatrical%20performance%20in%20Romanian&amp;f=false History of the literary cultures of East-Central Europe]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1834, a Romanian production took place in Iași on the stage of the Théâtre de varieté, built in 1832 for the French Fouraux troupe. 

The National Theatre was founded on 15 May 1840, as the ''Great Theatre of Moldavia'', when the Romanian language troupe, led by [[Costache Caragiale|Costache Caragiali]], was united with the French troupe, under a single direction of [[Vasile Alecsandri]] and the management of Costache Caragiali.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=8qMTPAPFGXUC&amp;pg=PA933&amp;lpg=PA933&amp;dq=first+first+theatre+performance+Romanian&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=uK_HV7btXh&amp;sig=64VSDq6lqoxuIc1EYzH9dt2xN_c&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=nn8vTITwL8j_OcuDiIEC&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=first%20first%20theatre%20performance%20Romanian&amp;f=false The Cambridge guide to theatre]&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 December 1846, a new audience hall was inaugurated in the former mansion of [[List of rulers of Moldavia|Prince]] [[Mihail Sturdza]], on the [[Seven hills of Iași|Hill of Copou]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.teatrulnationaliasi.ro/pages/theatre History]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Building==
On the night of 17/18 February 1888, the theatre building was destroyed by the fire.

The efforts to build the new theatre edifice culminated in 1894 when a contract was signed with the Viennese architects [[Ferdinand Fellner|Ferdinand Fellner and Hermann Helmer]], who designed several theatres and palaces across Europe, including the theatres in: [[Cluj-Napoca]], [[Oradea]], [[Timișoara]] and [[Chernivtsi]] (Romanian: Cernăuți). 
[[File:Teatrul Naţional Interior.jpg|thumb|left|The main auditorium]]
For the building work, a contract was signed with a Bucharest company, and the power station was built by a company from Berlin. The Theatre’s power station also supplied with electricity the 12 electric-arc lamps lighting the Theatre Square, marking the beginning of electrification in the city of Iași. The works to building took two years, and on 1 and 2 December 1896, the inauguration festivities took place with [[Alexander Flechtenmacher|Flechtenmacher]]'s ''National Overture'', the vaudevilles ''Muza de la Burdujeni'' (''The Muse from Burdujeni'') by [[Costache Negruzzi]] and ''Cinel-cinel'' (''The Riddle'') by Vasile Alecsandri, as well as the verse comedy ''Poetul romantic'' (''The Romantic Poet'') by [[Matei Millo]].

Nowadays, the building also hosts the [[Iași Romanian National Opera]].

The Iași National Theatre building is listed in the [[National Register of Historic Monuments in Romania|National Register of Historic Monuments]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://patrimoniu.gov.ro/images/LMI/LMI-2010_IS.pdf The Romanian Register of Historical Monuments in Iași County]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Architecture===
With a [[Neoclassic style|Neoclassic]] exterior and a richly decorated interior in [[Rococo]] and [[Baroque]] styles, the building is considered one of the most elegant in Romania.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.romaniatourism.com/iasi.html IASI - City Highlights] at romaniatourism.com&lt;/ref&gt;

The main auditorium is organised in stalls, boxes and a balcony. The curtain painted by the Viennese M. Lenz, presents in the middle, an allegory of life with its three stages and, to the right side, the allegory of [[Greater Romania|Romanian Unification]]. The left-hand side, painted by Lenz’s apprentice, differs from the rest of the curtain in style and colouring.

The ceiling and the iron curtain were painted by Alexander Goltz. The iron curtain, which completely separates the scene from the hall, shows ornaments placed symmetrically, while the ceiling has as a narrative basis the Archetypal Story, shown in paradisiacal allegories, with nymphs and cupids framed in rococo stucco.&lt;ref&gt;[https://sites.google.com/site/teatrulnationaliasi/home/istoric The main theatre building]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1,418 electric lights and the chandelier with 109 Venetian crystal lamps light up a playhouse with a unique architectural personality.

== About ==
Industry of the Ordinary document their projects at their website, where their manifesto states, "Through sculpture, text, photography, video, sound and performance, Industry of the Ordinary are dedicated to an exploration and celebration of the customary, the everyday, and the usual. Their emphasis is on challenging pejorative notions of the ordinary and, in doing so, moving beyond the quotidian."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Industry of the Ordinary|title=Manifesto|url=http://www.industryoftheordinary.com/html/manifesto.html|accessdate=16 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Industry of the Ordinary formed in 2003. IOTO's work appears in diverse forms, including performances tailored for specific exhibitions and performance art openings, artist-driven interventions on the streets of cities throughout the US and internationally, and public works commissioned by the [[Nebraska State Historical Society]],&lt;ref name=Heartney /&gt; the City of Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs and Special Events (DCASE)&lt;ref name=DCASE&gt;{{cite web|last=Gatziolis|first=Cindy|title=Seeking the Art of the Ordinary|url=http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/dca/provdrs/attractions_eventsandexhibitions/news/2012/aug/seeking_the_art_oftheordinary.html|publisher=City of Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs and Special Events|accessdate=19 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and the Billboard Art Project,&lt;ref name=Billboards&gt;{{cite web|last=Billboard Art Project|title=Baton Rouge, LA Participating Artists|url=http://billboardartproject.org/cities/baton_rouge.html|accessdate=19 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; among others.

== Themes ==
Industry of the Ordinary's work deals with themes of faith, freedom, politics, youth culture, celebrity, competitive sports, sex and drinking.&lt;ref name="Catalog Interview"&gt;{{cite book|last=MacKenzie|first=Duncan|title=Industry of the Ordinary: Sic Transit Gloria Mundi 2003-2013|year=2012|publisher=Chicago Cultural Center|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0-9852964-0-7|pages=176–183|authorlink=Feeling Ordinary}}&lt;/ref&gt; They often employ collaborative strategies, as in their piece ''39 Verbs'', for which they commissioned fellow arts professionals to create 39 works inspired by arbitrarily assigned verbs taken from their previous works' titles.&lt;ref name="39 Verbs"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ruiz|first=Steve|title=Minireview: Industry of the Ordinary @ Packer Schopf|url=http://chicagoartreview.wordpress.com/2009/11/14/minireview-industry-of-the-ordinary-packer-schopf/|publisher=Chicago Art Review|accessdate=19 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This emphasis on collaboration subverts traditional conceptions of art creation as highly individualistic, calling into question the elitism of the institutional art world. Works like ''Celebrity and the Peculiar,'' an installation of oxygen tents suffused by humidifiers with various celebrity perfumes, question popular culture's obsession with notoriety and our individual attempts to identify with celebrities.&lt;ref name="Celebrity and the Peculiar"&gt;{{cite book|last=Molon|first=Dominic|title=Industry of the Ordinary: Sic Transit Gloria Mundi 2003-2013|year=2012|publisher=Chicago Cultural Center|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0-9852964-0-7|pages=81–83|authorlink=The Stifling Smell of Success}}&lt;/ref&gt; IOTO's preoccupation with public interaction and stated intention that their work be completed by the creative interpretation and engagement of the audience has led some critics to categorize their work within the umbrella of [[Relational Aesthetics]].&lt;ref name="Newcity Review"&gt;{{cite web|last=Stabler|first=Bert|title=Review: Industry of the Ordinary/Chicago Cultural Center|url=http://art.newcity.com/2012/08/28/review-industry-of-the-ordinarychicago-cultural-center/|publisher=Newcity|accessdate=19 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their work has also been linked to the [[Situationist International]] and [[Fluxus]] movements. Their public interventions, usually ephemeral and existing afterwards only in the form of documentary photographs, videos, or text, has also been compared to the [[Happenings]] of the 1960s. One piece, ''Re-Work (for Allan Kaprow, [[Marina Abramović]] and [[Philip-Lorca diCorcia]]),'' re-imagines [[Allan Kaprow]]'s delegated performance, ''Work''. In his original, Kaprow hired professional house painters to paint and re-paint the hallway of a gallery space. For their ''Re-Work'' at the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles]], IOTO hired two sex workers to perform the same task while wearing their "professional" attire. Just as Kaprow's piece questioned the distinction of artist by contracting out the actual art-making process, IOTO's piece questions our assumptions about the nature of, and our subsequent judgements of, certain types of labor.&lt;ref name=Heartney /&gt;

== ''Sic Transit Gloria Mundi'' ==
Industry of the Ordinary's mid-career retrospective, ''Sic Transit Gloria Mundi'', was shown at the [[Chicago Cultural Center]] from August 2012 to February 2013. It was an exhibition of many of their works to that point, as well as several new pieces and a series of commissioned performances and installations which occurred throughout the run of the show. One of the elements of the show, the ''Portrait Project'', consisted of 71 portraits of Industry of the Ordinary, commissioned from 71 different artists in various media. Another piece, ''Everyone'', was a projected, scrolling, crowd-sourced list attempting to name every professional artist in Chicago.&lt;ref name=WBEZ /&gt; The show was well received, being accorded one of the spots on [[Newcity]]'s Top Five Chicago Art Exhibitions of 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Foumberg|first=Jason|title=Newcity's Top 5 of Everything 2012: Art|url=http://art.newcity.com/2012/12/20/newcitys-top-5-of-everything-2012-art/|publisher=Newcity|accessdate=19 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Intellectual property]] (IP) refers to creations of the mind, such as [[Invention|inventions]]; literary and artistic works; designs; and symbols, names and images used in commerce.

IP is protected in law by, for example, [[Patent|patents]], [[copyright]] and [[Trademark|trademarks]], which enable people to earn recognition or financial benefit from what they invent or create. By striking the right balance between the interests of innovators and the wider public interest, the IP system aims to foster an environment in which creativity and innovation can flourish.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Types of intellectual property typically include: 
* Copyright
* Patents
* Trademarks
* [[Industrial design|Industrial designs]]
* [[Geographical indication|Geographical indications]]

In today’s highly competitive [[consumer electronics]] industry, given the nature of the products and the quality of the market, Patents and Industrial designs are arguably becoming the most concerned types of intellectual property.

== The necessity of protecting intellectual property in consumer electronics industry ==
First, patents and industrial designs have a strong presence in the consumer electronics industry. As evidenced by the steady stream of novel high-tech offerings and the rate at which the latest gadgets become ‘‘[[Obsolescence|obsolete]],’’ companies in the electrical industry invest millions in [[research and development]] to meet the immense demand for new, useful technologies, and to help bring to market the next wave of cutting-edge products for consumers. The fruits of this research and development - which gives rise to the technologies themselves or to a key component of a particular products’ functionality - are typically protected through patents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Second, the consequence of leaking patents and industrial designs could be devastating. One of the examples is the series of ongoing lawsuits between [[Apple Inc. v. Samsung Electronics Co.|Apple and Samsung]] regarding the design of smartphones and tablet computers. 

== Practice in developing a company’s IP protection measures ==
On strategic level, a common practice is to develop an effective IP protection strategy. The following steps is commonly used in establishing such strategy:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

* the first step is to identify the [[Strategic management|corporate strategy]] and determine the best means for aligning the corporate strategy with the IP strategy
* in order to properly identify IP [[Asset|assets]], it is critical that a thorough IP audit be performed by personnel within the corporation who are knowledgeable or familiar with the company’s IP or the company’s technology plan.
* determining whether the identified IP assets are core assets
* properly allocating corporate resources to core and non-core IP assets
* setting up a program for periodic review of IP assets
On operational level, and given that the development phase usually involves developing various [[Prototype|prototypes]] and [[Blueprint|blueprints]] and sometimes have to work with third party vendors under circumstances, establishing a secrecy program throughout the whole project team would be beneficial in mitigating the leak risk. The following is a list of key questions need to be asked in the development phase of such secrecy program.
* Identify the external and internal parties and understand the roles and responsibilities
* Consider legal options on the table prior to engaging. For internal team/staff, [[Non-disclosure agreement|NDA]] is the minimum requirement. For external party, [[master service agreement]] (MSA) along with vendor obligation and [[Penalty clause|penalty clauses]] is a favorable option.
* Enforcing ongoing secrecy protection program. The elements that could put into the program include the statement of security responsibilities for vendors, the right to perform IP compliance and security compliance vendor assessment at the company’s discretion.
* Establishing Information security requirements.
* Conduct IP protection and secrecy awareness training to all required person.
* Determine leak investigation capacity

==Summary==
Krakauer describes the events leading up to his eventual decision to participate in an Everest expedition in May 1996, despite having mostly given up mountain-climbing years before. The 1996 expedition season recorded 8 deaths, including that of Krakauer's guide Andy Harris. This was the third-highest recorded number of deaths on the mountain in a single day; the [[April 2015 Nepal earthquake]] caused the most at 21.

Krakauer, a journalist for the adventure magazine ''[[Outside (magazine)|Outside]]'', initially said his intentions to climb Everest were purely professional. The original magazine story was to have Krakauer climb only to [[Everest Base Camp|base camp]], and report on the commercialization of the mountain. However, the idea of Everest reawakened his childhood desire to climb the mountain. Krakauer asked his editor to put off the story for a year so that he could train for a climb to the summit. From there, the book moves between events that take place on the mountain, and the unfolding tragedy, which takes place during the push to the summit. In the book, Krakauer alleges that essential safety methods adopted over the years by experienced guides on Everest are sometimes compromised by the competition between rival guiding agencies, in order to get their clients to the summit.

==Controversy==
Krakauer's recounting of certain aspects of the ill-fated climb has generated criticism, both from some of the climb's participants and from renowned mountaineers such as [[Galen Rowell]].  Much of the disputed material centers on Krakauer's accounting of the actions of Russian climber and guide [[Anatoli Boukreev]].  An experienced high-altitude climber and guide for Scott Fischer, Boukreev descended the summit prior to his clients, ostensibly out of concern for their safety and in preparation for potential rescue efforts. Boukreev later mounted repeated solo rescue efforts, saving several lives. In his book, Krakauer acknowledged Boukreev's heroism in saving two climbers' lives, but questions his judgment,  his decision to descend before clients, not using supplementary oxygen, his choices of gear on the mountain, and his interaction with clients. Boukreev provides a rebuttal to these allegations in his book, ''[[The Climb (book)|The Climb]]''.

[[Galen Rowell]] criticized Krakauer's account, citing numerous inconsistencies in his narrative while observing that Krakauer was sleeping in his tent while Boukreev was rescuing other climbers.  Rowell argued that Boukreev's actions were nothing short of heroic, and his judgment prescient: "[Boukreev] foresaw problems with clients nearing camp, noted five other guides on the peak [Everest], and positioned himself to be rested and hydrated enough to respond to an emergency. His heroism was not a fluke."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Climbing to Disaster|url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB864852385619851000|newspaper = Wall Street Journal|access-date = 2015-09-06|issn = 0099-9660|first = Galen|last = Rowell|date = 29 May 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The account has also been criticized for not informing the reader that the team members were receiving accurate daily weather forecasts and knew about the storm in advance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ratcliffe MBE|first=Graham|title=A Day to Die For|year=2011|publisher=Mainstream Publishing|location=UK|isbn=9781845966386|url=http://adaytodiefor.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Krakauer's 1999 paperback edition of ''Into Thin Air'', he addresses some of the criticism in a lengthy postscript.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Krakauer|first=Jon|title=Into Thin Air|year=1999|publisher=Turtleback|location=USA|isbn=9780613663618|url=https://www.amazon.com/Turtleback-School-Library-Binding-Edition/dp/0613663616/ref=tmm_hrd_title_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1373839576&amp;sr=1-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: This book puts forward evidence that detailed weather forecasts were being received by several groups well in advance of their teams' summit attempts. These forecasts highlighted clearly the oncoming strong storm that struck the mountain on 10th/11th May causing the tragedy. While most of Ratcliffe's comments are directed towards the two expedition leaders for ignoring the forecasts and continuing on the summit attempts, thereby exposing clients to such high risk, he also makes clear that in his view, Krakauer and many others' description of the storm as "sudden and unexpected" is wholly inaccurate. Furthermore, Ratcliffe suggests that Krakauer, by not mentioning the forecasts, did not produce an accurate or adequately researched account.

[[File:Gibson ES-175.png|thumb|175px|right|Hollowbody electric guitars are quite common in jazz; the [[Gibson ES-175]] is a classic example. It has been in production continuously since 1949.]]

The term '''''jazz guitar''''' may refer to either a type of guitar or to the variety of guitar playing styles used in the various genres which are commonly termed "[[jazz]]". The jazz-type [[guitar]] was born as a result of using [[Guitar amplifier|electric amplification]] to increase the volume of conventional acoustic guitars.

Conceived in the early 1930s, the electric guitar became a necessity as jazz musicians sought to amplify their sound to be heard over loud [[big band]]s. When guitarists in big bands only had acoustic guitars, all they could do was play [[chord (music)|chord]]s; they could not play solos because the acoustic guitar is not a loud instrument. Once guitarists switched from [[acoustic guitar]] to [[semi-acoustic guitar]] and began using [[guitar amplifier]]s, it made the guitar much easier to hear, which enabled guitarists to play [[guitar solo]]s. Jazz guitar had an important influence on jazz in the beginning of the twentieth century. Although the earliest guitars used in jazz were [[acoustic guitar|acoustic]] and acoustic guitars are still sometimes used in jazz, most jazz guitarists since the 1940s have performed on an electrically amplified guitar or [[electric guitar]].

Traditionally, jazz electric guitarists use an [[archtop guitar|archtop]] with a relatively broad hollow sound-box, violin-style [[f-holes]], a "[[bridge (instrument)|floating bridge]]", and a [[Pick up (music technology)|magnetic pickup]]. [[Solid body]] guitars, mass-produced since the early 1950s, are also used.

Jazz guitar playing styles include "[[comping]]" with jazz chord voicings (and in some cases [[walking bass]] lines) and "blowing" ([[improvising]]) over jazz chord progressions with jazz-style [[Musical phrasing|phrasing]] and ornaments.  Comping refers to playing chords underneath a song's melody or another musician's solo improvisations.  When jazz guitar players improvise, they may use the scales, modes, and arpeggios associated with the chords in a tune's chord progression and elements of the tune's melody.

==History==

===1900–mid-1930s===
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}The stringed, chord-playing rhythm can be heard in groups which included military band-style instruments such as brass, saxes, clarinets, and drums, such as early jazz groups. As the acoustic guitar became a more popular instrument in the early 20th century, guitar-makers began building louder guitars which would be useful in a wider range of settings.

The Gibson L5, an acoustic [[archtop guitar]] which was first produced in 1923, was an early “jazz”-style guitar which was used by early jazz guitarists such as [[Eddie Lang]]. By the 1930s, the guitar began to displace the banjo as the primary chordal rhythm instrument in jazz music, because the guitar could be used to voice chords of greater harmonic complexity, and it had a somewhat more muted tone  that blended well with the [[upright bass]], which, by this time, had almost completely replaced the tuba as the dominant bass instrument in jazz music.

===Late 1930s-1960s===
During the late 1930s and through the 1940s—the heyday of [[big band]] jazz and [[swing music]]—the guitar was an important [[rhythm section]] instrument. Some guitarists, such as [[Freddie Green]] of [[Count Basie]]’s band, developed a guitar-specific style of accompaniment. Few of the big bands, however, featured amplified guitar solos, which were done instead in the small combo context. The most important jazz guitar soloists of this period included the Manouche virtuoso [[Django Reinhardt]], [[Oscar Moore]] who was featured with [[Nat “King” Cole]]’s trio, and [[Charlie Christian]] of [[Benny Goodman]]'s band and sextet, who was a major influence despite his early death at 25.

[[File:Duke Ellington - Hurricane Ballroom - rhythm section.jpg|thumb|[[Duke Ellington]]'s [[big band]] had a rhythm section that included a jazz guitarist, a double bass player, and a drummer (not visible).]]

It was not until the large-scale emergence of small combo jazz in the post-WWII period that the guitar took off as a versatile instrument, which was used both in the rhythm section and as a featured melodic instrument and solo improviser. In the hands of [[George Barnes (musician)|George Barnes]], [[Kenny Burrell]], [[Herb Ellis]], [[Barney Kessel]], [[Jimmy Raney]], and [[Tal Farlow]], who had absorbed the language of [[bebop]], the guitar began to be seen as a “serious” jazz instrument. Improved electric guitars such as Gibson’s [[Gibson ES-175|ES-175]] (released in 1949), gave players a larger variety of tonal options. In the 1940s through the 1960s, players such as [[Wes Montgomery]], [[Joe Pass]], and [[Jim Hall (musician)|Jim Hall]] laid the foundation of what is now known as "jazz guitar" playing.

===1970s===

[[File:John McLaughlin 1 fcm.jpg|thumb|Jazz fusion pioneer [[John McLaughlin (musician)|John McLaughlin]] at a festival in Limburgerhof, Germany, 2008]]
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}As [[jazz-rock fusion]] emerged in the early 1970s, many players switched to the more rock-oriented [[solid body guitars]]. Other jazz guitarists, like [[Grant Green]] and [[Wes Montgomery]], turned to applying their skills to  pop-oriented styles that fused jazz with soul and R&amp;B, such as [[soul jazz]]-styled [[organ trio]]s. Younger jazz musicians rode the surge of electric popular genres such as blues, rock, and funk to reach new audiences. Guitarists in the fusion realm fused the post-bop harmonic and melodic language of musicians such as [[John Coltrane]], [[McCoy Tyner]], [[Ornette Coleman]], and [[Miles Davis]] with a hard-edged (and usually very loud) rock tone created by guitarists such as Cream's [[Eric Clapton]] who had redefined the sound of the guitar for those unfamiliar with the black blues players of Chicago and, before that, the Delta region of the Mississippi upon whom his style was based. With [[John Mayall]]'s Bluesbreakers, Clapton turned up the volume on a sound already pioneered by Buddy Guy, Freddie King, B.B. King and others that was fluid, with heavy finger vibratos, string bending, and speed through powerful Marshall amplifiers.

Fusion players such as [[John McLaughlin (musician)|John McLaughlin]] adopted the fluid, powerful sound of rock guitarists such as Clapton and Jimi Hendrix. McLaughlin was a master innovator, incorporating hard jazz with the new sounds of Clapton, Hendrix, Beck and others. McLaughlin later formed the Mahavishnu Orchestra, an historically important fusion band that played to sold out venues in the early 1970s and as a result, produced an endless progeny of fusion guitarist. Guitarists such as [[Pat Martino]], [[Al Di Meola]], [[Larry Coryell]], [[John Abercrombie (guitarist)|John Abercrombie]],  [[John Scofield]] and [[Mike Stern]] (the latter two both alumni of the Miles Davis band) fashioned a new language for the guitar which introduced jazz to a new generation of fans. Like the rock-blues icons that preceded them, fusion guitarists usually played their solid body instruments through stadium rock-style amplification, and signal processing "effects" such as simulated distortion, wah-wah, octave splitters, compression, and flange pedals. They also simply turned up to full volume in order to create natural overdrive such as the blues rock players.

===1980s–2000s===
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}By the early 1980s, the radical experiments of early 1970s-era fusion gave way to a more radio-friendly sounds of [[smooth jazz]]. Guitarist [[Pat Metheny]] mixed the sounds of blues, country, and “world” music, along with rock and jazz, playing both a flat-top acoustic guitar and an electric guitar with a softer, more mellow tone which was sweetened with a shimmering effect known as “[[chorus effect|chorusing]]". During the 1980s, a neo-traditional school of jazz sought to reconnect with the past. In keeping with such an aesthetic, young guitarists of this era sought a clean and round tone, and they often played traditional hollow-body arch-top guitars without electronic effects, frequently through [[vacuum tube amplifier]]s.

As players such as [[Bobby Broom]], [[Peter Bernstein (guitarist)|Peter Bernstein]], [[Howard Alden]], [[Russell Malone]], and [[Mark Whitfield]] revived the sounds of traditional jazz guitar, there was also a resurgence of archtop luthierie (guitar-making). By the early 1990s many small independent luthiers began making archtop guitars. In the 2000s, jazz guitar playing continues to change. Some guitarists incorporate a Latin jazz influence, [[acid jazz]]-style dance club music uses samples from [[Wes Montgomery]], and guitarists such as [[Bill Frisell]] continue to defy categorization.

==Types of guitars==

===Archtop guitars===
{{Main|Archtop guitar}}
[[File:Guitard Epiphone 03.jpg|thumb|right |150 px| A hollow-bodied Epiphone guitar with violin-style "F" holes.]] While jazz can be played on any type of guitar, from an acoustic instrument to a solid-bodied [[electric guitar]]  such as a Fender Stratocaster, the full-depth archtop guitar has become known as the prototypical "jazz guitar." Archtop guitars are [[steel-string acoustic guitar]]s with a big soundbox, arched top, violin-style [[f-hole]]s, a "[[tremolo arm#Fender floating bridge|floating bridge]]" and [[magnetic pickup|magnetic]] or [[piezoelectric pickup]]s. Early makers of jazz guitars included [[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibson]], [[Epiphone]], D'Angelico and Stromberg. The electric guitar is plugged into a [[guitar amplifier]] to make it sound loud enough for performance. Guitar amplifiers have equalizer controls that allow the guitarist to change the tone of the instrument, by emphasizing or de-emphasizing certain frequency bands. The use of [[reverberation|reverb effects]], which are often included in guitar amplifiers, has long been part of the jazz guitar sound. Particularly since the 1970s [[jazz fusion]] era, some jazz guitarists have also used [[effects unit|effects pedals]] such as [[distortion (music)|overdrive pedals]], [[chorus effect|chorus pedals]] and [[wah pedal]]s.

The earliest guitars used in jazz were acoustic, later superseded by a typical electric configuration of two [[humbucker|humbucking pickups]]. In the 1990s, there was a resurgence of interest among jazz guitarists in acoustic archtop guitars with floating pickups. The original acoustic archtop guitars were designed to enhance volume: for that reason they were constructed for use with relatively heavy [[guitar string]]s. Even after electrification became the norm, jazz guitarists continued to fit strings of 0.012" gauge or heavier for reasons of tone, and also prefer [[flatwound string]]s. The characteristic arched top can be made of a solid piece of wood that is carved into the arched shape, or a piece of laminated wood (essentially a type of plywood) that is pressed into shape. [[Spruce]] is often used for tops, and [[maple]] for backs. Archtop guitars can be mass-produced, such as the [[Ibanez Artcore series]], or handmade by [[luthier]]s such as [[Robert Benedetto]].

===Other guitars===
* The [[Selmer-Maccaferri guitar]] is strongly associated with [[Django Reinhardt]] and [[gypsy swing]].
* The [[resonator guitar]] was used (but not exclusively) by [[Oscar Aleman]].
* [[Nylon string guitar]]s are associated with [[Latin jazz]], for instance in the work of [[Charlie Byrd]] and [[Laurindo Almeida]].
* [[Flat top guitar|Flat-top]] steel-string guitars (particularly [[Ovation guitar]]s) have been used in the "acoustic [[shred guitar|shredding]]" of [[John McLaughlin (musician)|John McLaughlin]], [[Larry Coryell]] and [[Al Di Meola]].
* Solid-body [[electric guitar]]s have been used in [[Jazz-rock]], for instance by [[Bill Frisell]] and [[Stanley Jordan]]. The [[Telecaster]] in particular has a jazz following, e.g.[[Ed Bickert]] and [[Ted Greene]].
* [[Synthesizer guitar]]s in jazz-rock and avant-garde jazz, e.g. by [[Allan Holdsworth]] and [[Pat Metheny]].
* [[Seven string guitar]]s by [[George van Eps]], [[Lenny Breau]], [[Bucky Pizzarelli]] and [[Howard Alden]].
* [[Eight-string guitar]]s by [[Ralph Patt]].&lt;ref name="Peterson37"&gt;{{harvtxt|Peterson|2002|p=37}}: {{cite journal|title=Tuning in thirds: A new approach to playing leads to a new kind of guitar |first=Jonathon |last=Peterson |location=8222 South Park Avenue, Tacoma WA 98408: USA. |url=http://www.luth.org/backissues/al69-72/al72.htm |journal=American Lutherie: The Quarterly Journal of the Guild of American Luthiers |publisher=The Guild of American Luthiers |issn=1041-7176 |volume=72 |date=Winter 2002 |accessdate=9  October 2012 |pages=36–43 |ref=harv] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111021185726/http://www.luth.org/backissues/al69-72/al72.htm |archivedate=2011-10-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Musical ingredients==

===Rhythm===
Jazz rhythm guitar often consists of very textural, odd-meter playing that includes generous use of exotic, difficult-to-fret chords. In 4/4 timing, it is common to play 2.5 beat intervals such as on the 2 and then the half beat or "and" after 4. Jazz guitarists may play chords "ahead" of the beat, by playing the chord a swung eighth note before the actual chord change. Chords are not generally played in a repetitive rhythmic fashion, like a rock [[rhythm guitar]]ist would play.

===Harmony===
Jazz guitarists use their knowledge of [[harmony]] and jazz theory to create jazz chord "voicings," which emphasize the 3rd and 7th notes of the chord. Some more sophisticated chord voicings also include the 9th, 11th, and 13th notes of the chord. In some modern jazz styles, [[dominant 7th]] chords in a tune may contain altered 9ths (either flattened by a semitone, which is called a "flat 9th", or sharpened by a semitone, which is called a "sharp 9th"); 11ths (sharpened by a semitone, which is called a "sharp 11th"); 13ths (typically flattened by a semitone, which is called a "flat 13th").

Jazz guitarists need to learn about a range of different chords, including [[major 7th]], [[major 6th]], [[minor 7th]], [[minor/major seventh|minor/major 7th]], [[dominant 7th]], [[diminished seventh chord|diminished]], [[half-diminished seventh chord|half-diminished]], and [[augmented chord]]s. As well, they need to learn about chord transformations (e.g., altered chords, such as "alt dominant chords" described above), [[chord substitution]]s, and re-harmonization techniques. Some jazz guitarists use their knowledge of jazz scales and chords to provide a [[walking bass]]-style accompaniment.

Jazz guitarists learn to perform these chords over the range of different [[chord progression]]s used in jazz, such as the ubiquitous ii-V-I progression, the jazz-style [[12 bar blues|blues progression]] (which, in contrast to a blues-style 12 bar progression, may have two or more chord changes per bar) the minor jazz-style blues form, the I-vi-ii-V based "[[rhythm changes]]" progression, and the variety of modulation-rich chord progressions used in jazz ballads, and [[jazz standard]]s. Guitarists may also learn to use the chord types, strumming styles, and [[effects pedal]]s (e.g., [[chorus effect]] or [[Distortion (music)|fuzzbox]]) used in 1970s-era jazz-Latin, jazz-funk, and jazz-rock fusion music.

===Melody===
Jazz guitarists integrate the basic building blocks of scales and arpeggio patterns into balanced rhythmic and melodic phrases that make up a cohesive solo. Jazz guitarists often try to imbue their melodic phrasing with the sense of natural breathing and legato phrasing used by horn players such as saxophone players. As well, a jazz guitarists' solo improvisations have to have a rhythmic drive and "timefeel" that creates a sense of "[[Swing music|swing]]" and "groove." The most experienced jazz guitarists learn to play with different "timefeels" such as playing "ahead of the beat" or "behind the beat," to create or release tension.

Another aspect of the jazz guitar style is the use of stylistically appropriate ornaments, such as grace notes, slides, and muted notes. Each subgenre or era of jazz has different ornaments that are part of the style of that subgenre or era. Jazz guitarists usually learn the appropriate ornamenting styles by listening to prominent recordings from a given style or jazz era.  Some jazz guitarists also borrow ornamentation techniques from other jazz instruments, such as [[Wes Montgomery]]'s borrowing of playing melodies in parallel octaves, which is a jazz piano technique. Jazz guitarists also have to learn how to add in passing tones, use "guide tones" and chord tones from the chord progression to structure their improvisations.

In the 1970s and 1980s, with jazz-rock fusion guitar playing, jazz guitarists incorporated rock [[guitar solo]]ing approaches, such as [[riff]]-based soloing and usage of [[pentatonic]] and [[blues scale]] patterns. Some guitarists used [[Jimi Hendrix]]-influenced distortion and wah-wah effects to get a sustained, heavy tone, or even used rapid-fire [[guitar shredding]] techniques, such as [[tapping]] and [[tremolo bar]] bending. Guitarist [[Al Di Meola]], who started his career with [[Return to Forever]] in 1974, was one of the first guitarists to perform in a "[[shred guitar|shred]]" style, a technique later used in rock and heavy metal playing. Di Meola used alternate-picking to perform very rapid sequences of notes in his solos.

===Improvisation===
When jazz guitar players [[improvisation|improvise]], they use the scales, modes, and arpeggios associated with the chords in a tune's chord progression. The approach to improvising has changed since the earliest eras of jazz guitar. During the Swing era, many soloists improvised "by ear" by embellishing the melody with ornaments and passing notes. However, during the bebop era, the rapid tempo and complicated chord progressions made it increasingly harder to play "by ear." Along with other improvisers, such as saxes and piano players, bebop-era jazz guitarists began to improvise over the chord changes using scales (whole tone scale, chromatic scale, etc.) and arpeggios.&lt;ref&gt;''Jazzology: The Encyclopedia of Jazz Theory for All Musicians'', by Robert Rawlins, Nor Eddine Bahha, Barrett Tagliarino. Hal Leonard Corporation, 2005 {{ISBN|0-634-08678-2}}, {{ISBN|978-0-634-08678-6}}. Page 141&lt;/ref&gt; Jazz guitar players tend to improvise around chord/scale relationships, rather than reworking the melody, possibly due to their familiarity with chords resulting from their comping role. A source of melodic ideas for improvisation is transcribing improvised solos from recordings. This provides jazz guitarists with a source of "licks", melodic phrases and ideas they incorporate either intact or in variations, and is an established way of learning from the previous generations of players.

==Playing styles==

===Big band rhythm===
In jazz [[big band]]s, popular during the 1930s and 1940s, the guitarist is considered an integral part of the rhythm section (guitar, [[drum]]s and [[Double bass|bass]]). They usually played a regular four strums to the bar, although an amount of harmonic improvisation is possible. [[Freddie Green]], guitarist in the [[Count Basie]] orchestra, was a noted exponent of this style. The harmonies are often minimal; for instance, the [[root (chord)|root note]] is often omitted on the assumption that it will be supplied by the bassist.

===Small group comping===
When jazz guitarists play chords underneath a song's melody or another musician's solo improvisations, it is called "[[comping]]", short for "accompanying" {{Citation needed span|text=and for "complementing".|date=April 2010}} The accompanying style in most jazz styles differs from the way chordal instruments accompany in many popular styles of music. In many popular styles of music, such as rock and pop, the [[rhythm guitar]]ist usually performs the chords in rhythmic fashion which sets out the beat or groove of a tune. In contrast, in many modern jazz styles within smaller, the guitarist plays much more sparsely, intermingling periodic chords and delicate voicings into pauses in the melody or solo, and using periods of silence. Jazz guitarists commonly use a wide variety of [[Inversion (music)|inversions]] when comping, rather than only using standard voicings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eden.rutgers.edu/~pfelton/inversions.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930075616/http://eden.rutgers.edu/~pfelton/inversions.html |archivedate=2011-09-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chord-melody and unaccompanied soloing===
In this style, the guitarist aims to render an entire song &amp;mdash; harmony, melody and bass &amp;mdash; in something like the way a [[classical guitar]]ist or [[pianist]] can. Chord roots cannot be left to the bassist in this style. Chords themselves can be used sparsely or more densely, depending on both the individual player and his or her arrangement of a particular piece. In the sparse style, a full chord is often played only at the beginning of a melodic phrase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.jazzguitarlessons.net/chord-melody.html|title=Chord Melody For Jazz Guitar: How-to on Jazz Standards|work=JazzGuitarLessons.net|access-date=2017-05-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The denser chordal textures, in contrast,  approach chord soloing (see below). A third approach is to maintain a steady, busy bass-line, like a New Orleans pianist. Here, no more than two or three notes are played at a time, and the full harmony is indicated by arpeggiation. Exponents of this style often come from a [[Country music|country]], [[Folk music|folk]] or [[ragtime]] background, such as [[Chet Atkins]], although it is also sometimes employed by [[straight-ahead jazz]] practitioners, for instance [[Martin Taylor (guitarist)|Martin Taylor]]. Chord-melody is often played with a [[plectrum]] (see [[Tal Farlow]], [[George Benson]] and others); whereas [[Fingerstyle#Fingerstyle jazz guitar|fingerstyle]], as practised by [[Joe Pass]], [[George van Eps]],  [[Ted Greene]], [[Robert Conti]], [[Lenny Breau]] or [[hybrid picking]] as practised by [[Ed Bickert]], Laszlo Sirsom and others allows for a more complex, [[polyphonic]] approach to unaccompanied soloing.

==="Blowing" or single-note soloing===
[[Charlie Christian]] and [[Django Reinhardt]] are generally held to have initiated the use of the guitar to play melodies and improvisations over other instruments, the former using an early form of amplification, the latter playing forcefully on an acoustic guitar. Over the years, jazz guitarists have been able to solo in standard jazz idioms, such as [[bebop]], [[cool jazz]] and so on, while in also absorbing influences from rock guitarists, such as the use of electronic effects.

===Chord soloing===
Jazz guitarists are not limited to single note improvisation. When working with accompaniment, chord solos are created by improvising chords (harmony) and melody simultaneously, usually in the upper register on strings 1,2,3 and 4. [[Wes Montgomery]] was noted for playing successive choruses in single notes, then octaves and finally a chord solo - this can be heard in his improvisation on the standard [[Lover Man (Oh, Where Can You Be?)]]. When playing without accompaniment, jazz guitarists may create chord solos by playing bass, melody and chords, individually or simultaneously, on any or all strings - such as the work of [[Lenny Breau]], [[Joe Pass]], [[Martin Taylor (guitarist)|Martin Taylor]] and others. This technique can be also be incorporated into unaccompanied soloing: for instance [[Django Reinhardt]]'s ''"improvisations"'', as he called his solo pieces.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24800">The following is a list of the ''rasa'il'' ([[epistles]]) which compose the influential [[Neoplatonic]] [[encyclopedia]], the ''[[Encyclopedia of the Brethren of Purity]]'' composed by the [[Brethren of Purity]] in the tenth century [[Common Era|CE]] in [[Basra, Iraq]].

The following tabulation of the ''rasa'il'' is principally drawn from a work entitled "Notices of some copies of the Arabic work intitled "Rasàyil Ikhwàm al-cafâ"", written by [[Aloys Sprenger]], originally published by the ''[[Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal]]'' (in [[Calcutta]]) in 1848. Doubts have been raised by A. L. Tibawi as to the accuracy of Sprenger's catalogue: "But it is unfortunate that his account is marred by loose translation and too many misreadings of or misprints in the Arabic, and his collection omits the fourteenth tract, merges the eighth with the ninth, and leaves the text of the twelfth and thirteenth confused." &lt;ref name="list-ikhwan-and-their-rasail"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tibawi |first=A. L. |year=1955 |title=Ikhwan as-Safa and their Rasa'il: A Critical Review of a Century and a Half of Research |journal=The Islamic Quarterly |volume=2 |issue= |pages28-46=  |issn=0021-1842}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mathematical Sciences==
&lt;!-- The following is an unholy admixture of Aloys Sprenger's and Godefroid de Callataÿ's listings. I honestly don't know which one is more screwed up; I just hope my interleaving of them isn't even more screwed up. --&gt;
# Numbers, [[arithmetic]], and [[numerology]], especially Pythagorean; a discussion of the importance of the number four
# [[Geometry]] (''jumatriya''). [[Euclid]]'s definitions and how to calculate the area of a triangle
# [[Ptolemaic astronomy]] (''asturunumiya'')
# [[Geography]] (''al-jughrafiya''), especially geography that uses mathematics. The Brethren explain racial characteristics as resulting from varying climates' long-term influence.&lt;ref name="list-shiloah-2"&gt;"However, differences exist between the races and nations of the earth. According to the theory of racial differences, which we also find in the same context in al-Kindi: the particularizing and characterizing signs that distinguish nations and races are not the results of inheritance, but are caused by the place the various groups inhabit, and its climate." page 8 of Shiloah 1978&lt;/ref&gt; The Brethren seem to know of [[Japan]]: "The most eastern country of this climate is the island of Niphon &lt;nowiki&gt;[compare another term for Japan, "Nippon"]&lt;/nowiki&gt;; then comes southern [[China]], then the south of [[Ceylon]], then central [[India]], then subcentral and [[Sindh]], then beyond the [[Persian Gulf]] the south of [[Oman]] then comes the centre of the country of Shir, &lt;!-- Does anyone have any idea what this stands for? I don't. --&gt; then central [[Yemen|Yaman]], then across the [[Red Sea]], central Messynia &lt;!-- Abyssinia, maybe? --&gt;; then across the [[Nile]] is [[Nubia]]....." &lt;ref name="list-aloys"&gt;"Notices of some copies of the Arabic work entitled "Rasàyil Ikhwàm al-cafâ"", written by [[Aloys Sprenger]], originally published by the ''Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal'' (in [[Calcutta]]) in 1848 [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Brethren_of_Sincerity]&lt;/ref&gt; [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Brethren3.png]
# Music (''al-musiqa'') [https://web.archive.org/web/20040225093029/http://www.iis.ac.uk/learning/life_long_learning/rasail_ikhwan/rasail_ikhwan.htm#anchor9] Deals with the subject in unusually many aspects.&lt;ref name="list-shiloah-1"&gt;"When I originally undertook to prepare this text for publication, it very soon became clear to me that this treatise in its range, construction, purpose and richness of thematic material was unique of its kind, both in the Arabic musical literature that preceded and followed it and, perhaps, in the whole of medieval musical literature." page 5 of Shiloah 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; It first lays out the power of music and its uses; it uses the practical purposes of music &lt;ref name="list-shiloah-3"&gt;"If one establishes the measure of time by the regular, harmonious and proportionate succession of motions and silences, the notes resulting will be comparable to the notes produced by the movements of the sphere and the heavenly bodies and in concordance with them. Thus doing, the individual soul that inhabits the world of generation and corruption, will recall the beatitude of the world of the spheres and the felicity of the souls who are there above. It will know and will acquire the conviction that the souls of the celestial world enjoy the best conditions, the sweetest delights and the most lasting felicity, for the notes produced by the movements of the spheres are purer, their melodies sweeter; for these celestial bodies are of a better constitution, of a more beautiful form, of a purer substance, their movements are better ordered and their concordance is more harmonious. When the individual soul that inhabits the world of generation and corruption will have acquired a knowledge of the states of the celestial world, will have had faith in the truth of what we have described, it will manifest an ardent desire to mount upwards and to join there the souls of its own kind, delivered from nations that disappeared in earlier times." page 35 of Shiloah, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; as a defense against various Koranic proscription; another defense is that the restrictions are applicable only to entertainment and pleasure motivated music, analogous to contemporary defenses of poetry). Theologically motivated, it moves on to the abstracted essence of music, which is present in all arts.&lt;ref name="list-shiloah-6"&gt;"This is the art of harmony (''tayif'') which can be defined in terms of proportions. Our intention in this Epistle is not therefore the teaching of the practice of music (''ghinī''); nor of the instrument art (''sinālat al-malāhī''), although the study of this aspect is indispensable, but our purpose is to make known the science of proportions and the modality of harmony, the knowledge of which presides at mastery in all the arts." page 12 of Shiloah 1978&lt;/ref&gt;
# Deals with [[ratio]]s and [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportions]], which are useful in mathematics and also especially in [[musical scale]]s; indeed, Thomas Davidson describes there assertion thus: "The faculty of aesthetic judgement investigates these properties, and so discovers the rules of Art." Eric van Reijn classifies this epistle as dealing with "Mathematics and Geometry".&lt;ref name="list-eric1"&gt;pg. ix of Reijn 1995&lt;/ref&gt;
# The seventh and eighth epistles are the "Classification of the Sciences",&lt;ref name="list-eric1"/&gt; or "On the scientific arts":
* The nine professional sciences are "the educational sciences, intended to help men to a maintenance, and to direct them in their intercourse with others."&lt;ref name="list-studies-in-a-mosque-4"/&gt; They are: reading and writing; grammar and language; [[arithmetic]]; sorcery and alchemy and [[shorthand]]; "Versification and poetry" or "poetry and music";&lt;ref name="list-studies-in-a-mosque-4"&gt;pg 198-199, Lane-Poole 1883&lt;/ref&gt; business and [[agriculture]]; "trades and professions"; selling, buying, and other things of [[commerce]] like breeding [[cattle]];&lt;ref name="list-studies-in-a-mosque-4"/&gt; and finally, biographies and histories.
* The 6 religious sciences "help the soul in its struggle towards the other world."&lt;ref name="list-studies-in-a-mosque-5"&gt;pg 199, Lane-Poole 1883&lt;/ref&gt; They consist of: learning the [[Koran]] (revelation); learning the Koran's commentaries (explanation); of the [[hadith]] and other traditions (tradition); "the knowledge of law and ordinances of God and of legal division" (law); religious obligations and asceticism; and [[oneiromancy]] ("illumination").&lt;ref name="list-studies-in-a-mosque-5"/&gt;
* The given hierarchy of philosophical sciences is complex. It appears to be as follows:
** Mathematical sciences
*** [[Arithmetic]]
*** [[Geometry]]
*** [[Astronomy]]
*** [[Music]]
** [[Logic]]
*** [[Poetry]]
*** [[Rhetoric]]
*** Topica &lt;!-- ? No, I do not know what Aloys meant by this, either. --&gt;
*** Analytica &lt;!-- Ditto. --&gt;
*** Sophistica &lt;!-- Sophistry? --&gt;
** [[Natural philosophy]]
*** "Sciences of the first principles of a body"
**** Matter
**** Shape
**** Time
**** Place
**** Motion &lt;!-- Note that Sprenger's paper says "notion", but there are a number of typos in it, and motion makes more sense than notion. --&gt;
*** "Science of the heavens and of the universe"
**** What the heavens are made of
**** How many bodies there are in the heavens
**** Why those bodies move
**** Whether those bodies can be destroyed like mundane matter
*** "''de generatione et corruptione''"
**** The nature of the four elements
**** The influence of stars on the sublunary world
*** [[Meteorology]]
*** [[Mineralogy]]
*** [[Zoology]]
** Metaphysical sciences
*** [[Theology]]
*** Knowledge of [[angel]]s
*** Knowledge of dead souls
*** Knowledge of [[government]]s
*** "Science of things connected with a future state"
* "On creeds and professions"- a classification of the sciences into three categories of professional, religious, and philosophical sciences. The Brethren write:
:''"Know, my brother, that there are three kinds of sciences with which people are busy, namely: the [[propaedeutics|propaedeutic]] sciences, the religious and conventional sciences, the philosophical and real sciences."''[https://web.archive.org/web/20040225093029/http://www.iis.ac.uk/learning/life_long_learning/rasail_ikhwan/rasail_ikhwan.htm] This chapter deals especially with the practical arts.
:9. "Where one accounts for characters, the causes of their difference and the [various] species of the evils which [strike] them; anecdotes drawn from the educational rules of the Prophets and cream of the morals of the sages." (from Sprenger). "No. 9 examines the differences of Temperament and Character, with the view of enabling the soul to attain the proper mood and develop a perfect character. Here we have a system of Ethics." (from Thomas Davidson).
:10. A summary of [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]]'s ''[[Isagoge]]'' (the Latin name for his ''Introduction to Categories'', sometimes simply ''Introduction'').
:11. A summary of Aristotle's ''[[Categories (Aristotle)|Categories]]'', a portion of his ''Organon''; it tries to encompass all things under the ten categories of Aristotle.
:12. A summary of ''[[De Interpretatione]]'', another subsection of his ''Organon''; an essay defending the usefulness of logic in general is included after its discussion of Aristotle's [[proposition]]s.
:13. A summary of ''[[Prior Analytics]]'', another work included in Aristotle's ''Organon''
:14. A summary of '[[Posterior Analytics]]'', another work included in Aristotle's ''Organon''

==Natural Sciences==
# According to Sprenger and Godefroid de Callataÿ, this ''risala'' is a summary of ''[[Posterior Analytics]]'', the followup to ''Prior Analytics'' in the ''Organum''; for Thomas Davidson and Eric van Reijn, this ''risala'' concerns rather Aristotle's ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]''. Regardless, when the Brethren discuss physics, they employ another hierarchical characterization of the Great Chain of Being:
#* Motion
#** Physical
#*** Generation
#*** Corruption
#*** Augmentation
#*** Diminution
#*** Alteration
#*** Translation
#**** Straight
#**** Circular
#**** Combination
#** Spiritual
# A summary of Aristotle's ''[[de Coelo]]'', with a discussion of astronomy and circumnavigating the [[kaaba]] at [[Mecca]]
# A summary of ''[[On Generation and Corruption]]''. Sprenger says that it "differs widely from Aristotle's work of the same name. It contains a popular explanation of Aristotle's ideas on the subject, interspersed with numerous moral reflections, and other extraneous matters."[http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Brethren6.png]
# On matter, space, motion, and time, according to Aloys Sprenger; Thomas Davidson and Godefroid de Callataÿ list this ''risala'' as being on [[meteorology]], using Aristotle's ''[[Meteorology (Aristotle)|Meteorology]]''; van Reijn simply calls this epistle "The Celestial Bodies".&lt;ref name="list-eric1"/&gt;
# On minerals, which segues into a discussion of souls ascending to heaven
# A discussion of Nature (the metaphysical entity of the Brethren's hierarchy) and its creation of the animals, plants, and minerals
# A discussion of the various kinds of plants, and of a quasi-[[Great chain of being]] view of the natural hierarchy, in which plants are superior to minerals, but inferior to animals, which are themselves inferior to humans, and thence to angels- and all are inferior to the Creator. The Brethren do not see a clear and sharp break between domains, according the [[palm tree]] near-animal status because of its division in male and female sexes.
# "The Generation of Animals."&lt;ref name="list-eric1"/&gt; A discussion and classification of animals. (This was the ''risala'' the Rev. T. Thomason first published an excerpt from).
# "The Composition of the Body." &lt;ref name="list-eric1"/&gt; On man's body, and a hermetic view ("As above, so below") view of man's body as a microcosm related to the macrocosm.
# Ostensibly a summary of the ''[[On Sense and the Sensible]]'' by Aristotle; it lays out theories of neurology and [[sensory perception]] and the effects of astrology on portions of the body.
# [[Embryology]]. Which planets control which month of [[pregnancy]].
# In spirit, a continuation of the ninth, which begins: "Know, O brother, that the knowledge of one's own self is the key to every science and this is threefold; first, man ought to be acquainted with the component part and economy of his own body, and with all those qualities which are independent of the influences of the soul; secondly, he ought to study the soul and its qualities independent of the body, and thirdly he ought to understand their joint action." [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Brethren8.png] The Brethren further go on to lay astrological correspondences with bodily parts and orifices.
# "On the modalities of birth of the particular souls in the natural human bodily systems." [https://web.archive.org/web/20040225093029/http://www.iis.ac.uk/learning/life_long_learning/rasail_ikhwan/rasail_ikhwan.htm]. Davidson offers a clearer gloss: "...shows how the partial soul grows in the human body, and how it may thus, before or after death, become an angel." van Reijn reverses this and the previous one, holding that number 25 is on the embryo and 26 is on "Man as Microcosm".&lt;ref name="list-eric1"/&gt;
# "On the extent of the powers of the human mind to penetrate into the mysteries of the universe" and the mysteries of the Creator.
# On life and death, and how a rational soul is embodied, and why death is not to be feared, since it allows the good to reach Paradise. (van Reijn likewise reverses this and the preceding one).
# Pleasure and pain, in mortal and immortal life.
# "The Diversity of Languages" &lt;ref name="list-eric1"/&gt; On the purposes and functions of language, and also on the cause of differing languages.

==Psychological and Rational Sciences==
# A Pythagorean explanation of creation, a defense that the universe was indeed created in a way deeply concerned with numbers at some point, and that the decimal system- then a still fairly recent innovative introduction from the Hindus - described the universe.
# "On the origins of the ''logos'' (i.e. intellect considered as a [[Substance theory|substance]] and not as a faculty)." Eric van Reijn glosses this epistle as concerning the "Spiritual Creation (according to the Sincere Brethren)." &lt;ref name="list-eric1"/&gt;
# "Man as Macrocosm." &lt;ref name="list-eric1"/&gt; Further discussion of a macrocosmic correlation with a microcosm of man's body.
# "On intellect (as a faculty of the mind), and the object of intellect."
# "On the revolutions and orbits of the stars. The authors enter at some length on the [[sidereal period]], or [[Yuga]]s of the [[Hindu]]s, which became known to the Arabs by a translation of the [[Siddhanta]]."
# Love of the soul for the Creator.
# Resurrection and immortality of the soul; this ''risala'' has especial emphasis on the ascension of the soul, and Davidson says: "In this the whole system laid down in the Cyclopaedia culminates."
# On motion, and on the [[Cosmological argument]]
# On [[Causality|cause and effect]]
# "On the nature of simple and compound bodies." (Or possibly "On definitions and descriptions", which is followed by van Reijn's translation as "Definitions and Classifications";&lt;ref name="list-eric1"/&gt; Davidson: "...treats of Definitions and Determinations, and tries to show the ideal essence of things, simple and compound.")

==Theological Sciences==
# A lengthy epistle discussing the various disputing philosophies and religions. Concludes that all aim at the salvation of humans, but non-Islamic ones miss the mark.
# "The Ascent to God".&lt;ref name="list-eric1"/&gt; A discussion of how to reach the Creator through a virtuous and pious life, and how some were called by Him to aid the rest in seeking him.&lt;ref name="list-eric2"&gt;"Out of His infinite grace He chose a few of his servants and permitted them to draw near to Him, and he revealed some of His hidden secrets to them. They were then sent to summon all men to repent and disclose to the rest of Mankind some of those mysteries, so that they might awaken from their Slumber of Ignorance and live the life of the wise and the blessed, and reach the perfection of Paradise and eternal life." page 11 of Reijn 1995&lt;/ref&gt; The manner of seeking is also described; the only thing pure in man in his soul,&lt;ref name="list-eric3"&gt;"There are only to ways to get there: having a pure Soul and keeping to the Straight Path. By its very nature Man's Soul is always pure. The human body consists of flesh and blood, bones, veins, sinews, skin and the like; dark and heavy substances originating from the earth and subject to change and decay." page 11 of Reijn 1995&lt;/ref&gt; so it is the Soul that one must seek the creator through,&lt;ref name="list-eric4"&gt;"Being 'pure consciousness', the soul directly beholds spiritual realities, even though they are invisible to the human eye, but it beholds the physical world only through the sense. However if the Soul has sunken into a state of ignorance....it will be unable to see God and will be hindered from attaining the blessings of Paradise." page 11 of Reijn 1995&lt;/ref&gt; however slowly must needs be &amp; they will be judged on their progress.&lt;ref name="list-eric4"&gt;"However, some people know and believe that the Revelation is true, others accept it on its own authority without questioning it; others yet again shun theological problems and are reluctant to even discuss them... The souls of all these people have fallen into a slumber of ignorance; only a good and compassionate friend can awaken them", page 14-15. "Only when their Souls have been cleansed and their understanding purified, and when their mental faculties have grown stronger, will the full answer to these questions be revealed to them..." pg 15. "He made man the measure of His creation. Each of us will be his own set of scales, weighing out his own reward or punishment on the Day of Judgement. Man is a microcosm which reflects all creation." pg 16 of Reijn 1995&lt;/ref&gt;
# "The Creed &lt;nowiki&gt;[or Doctrine]&lt;/nowiki&gt; of the Sincere Brethren".&lt;ref name="list-eric1"/&gt; An epistle of stories and [[parable]]s which explain the religious beliefs of the Brethren; death and pain must be spurned for higher and greater things, ignorance must be vanquished, and examples are given from the lives of Jesus,&lt;ref name="list-eric5"&gt;Although the Brethren's beliefs on Jesus sometimes differed from the New Testament's version, they conform to the Qur'anic account, of course. Take pg 29: "In the morning Jesus left his disciples and later appeared among the people, preaching and exhorting them. He was then arrested and taken to the King of the Jews who ordered his crucifixion. But what they crucified was his Humanity." Reijn 1995&lt;/ref&gt; Mohammed, Socrates, Abraham and others to show that they too believed in another greater life, which one must strive to reach.
# "On the social intercourse of the Brethren of Purity; on the mutual assistance which they rendered each other in the spirit of true charity; on their benevolence, affection and kind-heartedness. The object of this treatise is to inculcate unity, and the duty of aiding each other in worldly and spiritual concerns." or more simply, "On Friendship". A chapter discussing the Brethren's organization and habits (i.e. meeting for purposes of education,&lt;ref name="list-eric6"&gt;pg 35: "Know, Brother, that we Brethren should meet one another from time to time at gatherings that exclude outsiders, to discuss our esoteric sciences and to meditate on their secret knowledge...Our Brethren should not scorn any science or book of wisdom, neither should we stick to one "madhhab" in particular. Our "madhhab" comprises all "madhhabs" and all sciences." Reijn 1995&lt;/ref&gt; assist one's comrades&lt;ref name="list-eric7"&gt;pg 37: "We Brethren assist one another against our common foes. Each of us in form support for the others in calamities and misfortune, a protective shield in happiness and adversity, a well-kept treasure for the hour of need, a quiet shelter in distress, a vital bond for those seeking a friend to intercede on their behalf with God, and an inaccessible fortress in which one takes refuge in times of war." Reijn 1995&lt;/ref&gt; etc.), whose title van Reijn gives as "Friendship and Mutual Assistance", which is the source for the popular belief that the Brethren derived their name from a story in the ''[[Kalilah wa-Dimnah]]'' concerned precisely with friendship and mutual assistance. This epistle is largely translated by Sprenger.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1059">A '''mark of distinction''', in [[heraldry]], is a charge showing that the bearer of a shield is not (as defined by the rules or laws of heraldry in most, though not all, countries and situations) descended by blood from the original bearer.  The "mark of distinction" (which is so called as it is supposed to "make distinct" that the bearer is not one of the possible legitimate heirs or heiresses) usually refers to a context of [[illegitimacy]], the illegitimate offspring being regarded as a "stranger in blood" to his natural father.  The mark of distinction may also be applied upon the adoption of a surname and arms of a family from whom the bearer is not descended.

== Plot ==
In the first act, The Robbery, the film opens on the island of [[Sumba]] with Marlina grieving her late husband. A group of seven men, led by the aged Markus, arrive at her house intent on robbing Marlina of her livestock and raping her. They demand to be fed dinner, and she takes the opportunity to poison most of the robbers with chicken soup and decapitate Markus. She burns Markus' musical instrument, a [[jungga]].

In the second act, The Journey, she hitches a ride on the local bus where she encounters the pregnant Novi, on the way to find her jealous husband Umbu before she delivers. They are joined by an old woman with a dowry payment of two horses on the way to her nephew's wedding. Along the way, two of the other robbers (including Franz) discover the deaths and chase after Marlina. They hijack the bus, but Marlina escapes with one of the horses. Along the way, Marlina is haunted by a headless apparition playing the jungga.

In the third act, The Confession, she arrives at the local police station and delivers a report of the robbery, rape, and her self-defense. The police accept the report but insist that they can't proceed for at least a month while they wait for funds to purchase rape test equipment. Marlina bonds with a young girl in a local [[warung]].

In the fourth act, The Birth, Novi finally finds Umbu. He, believing that a [[Breech birth|breech baby]] is a sign of infidelity, hits her and leaves her to be found by Franz, who threatens her into luring Marlina back to the house. The three meet at the house, and Novi's water breaks. She considers killing Franz, but takes pity on him. Franz reunites the head of Markus with his corpse and places him beside Marlina's mummified husband. While Novi cooks chicken soup for him under duress, he rapes Marlina and Novi decapitates him. She then gives birth. Marlina and Novi leave the house in the morning together with the child.

==Reception==
On [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 97% based on 36 reviews, and an [[average rating]] of 7.7/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "Subversive, gorgeously shot, and suitably visceral, ''Marlina the Murderer in Four Acts'' injects timely feminist themes into a neo-western grindhouse framework."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/marlina_the_murderer_in_four_acts |title=Marlina the Murderer in Four Acts (2017) |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher=[[Fandango (company)|Fandango Media]] |accessdate=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film has a weighted average score of 76 out of 100, based on 12 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/marlina-the-murderer-in-four-acts |title=Marlina the Murderer in Four Acts Reviews |work=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=21 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Jakarta Post]]'s'' reviewer Stanley Widianto called the film "one hell of a ride" arguing that its similarities to the "spaghetti western trope" film making style rightfully earns [[:id:Mouly Surya|Surya]]'s third feature film the distinction of being Indonesia's "first satay [[Western Film|Western film]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2017/11/18/marlina-unnerving-and-all-around-glorious.html|title=Marlina Unnerving, and all around glorious|last=Widianto|first=Stanley|date=18 November 2017|work=[[The Jakarta Post]]|access-date=4 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the debut feature of director-editor Jeff Malmberg. It was the inspiration for ''[[Welcome to Marwen]]'', a 2018 drama directed by [[Robert Zemeckis]].&lt;ref name="hollywoodreporter.com"&gt;[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/robert-zemeckis-direct-marwencol-universal-650730]"Robert Zemeckis to Direct 'Marwencol' for Universal"  "The Hollywood Reporter" hollywoodreporter.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="variety.com"&gt;[https://variety.com/2017/film/news/universal-robert-zemeckis-steve-carell-pic-for-november-2018-1202403338/] "Universal Dates Robert Zemeckis-Helmed Steve Carell Pic for November 2018" variety.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
On April 8, 2000, Mark Hogancamp was attacked outside of a bar by five men who beat him nearly to death after he told them he was a cross-dresser.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Green |first=Penelope |date=2011-04-06 |title=In a Tiny Universe, Room to Heal |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/07/garden/07marwencol.html |work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After nine days in a coma and forty days in the hospital, Hogancamp was discharged with brain damage that left him little memory of his previous life. Unable to afford therapy, he creates his own by building a 1/6-scale [[World War II]]-era [[Belgian]] town in his yard and populating it with dolls representing himself, his friends, and even his attackers.  He calls that town "[[Marwencol]]," blending the names "Mark," "Wendy" and "Colleen."

Hogancamp was initially discovered by photographer David Naugle, who documented and shared his story with [[Esopus (magazine)|''Esopus'']] magazine&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.esopusmag.com/archivesubright.php?Id=3199&amp;pID=3014|title=Marwencol on My Mind|last=Hogancamp|first=Mark|date=Fall 2005|website=[[Esopus (magazine)|Esopus]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060511082836/http://www.esopusmag.com/archivesubright.php?Id=3199&amp;pID=3014|archive-date=2006-05-11|dead-url=yes|access-date=|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then his work was shown in a [[New York City|New York]] [[Contemporary art gallery|art gallery]].

'''NeoSon''' is an artistic movement developed in [[Guadalajara]], [[Mexico]], by a group of local artists, [[Tropico Suemba|Josué Pérez]] being  its main exponent. The movement was started in the early 1990s after a two-year tour by Pérez and Carlos "Charly" Garcia (one of the best [[multi-instrumentalist]]s in the country) through 13 countries in [[Latin America]], especially [[Brazil]]. The genesis was prompted by Pérez's perception of the lack of artistic innovation in Mexico experienced from the 1960s on. Although [[Mexican art]] has always had plenty of creative minds and people interested in its promotion, a considerable gap separated the country's artistic scene from those of other countries such as Brazil and [[Argentina]]. This separation was particularly felt after the concert of [[Festival Rock y Ruedas de Avándaro|Avándaro]] (regarded as the Mexican [[Woodstock]]) in 1971,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.normal-records.com/main.php?a=3_Love%20Peace%20Poetry&amp;r=Vol.7%20Mexican Normal Records - Avandaro Festival]&lt;/ref&gt; after which rock music in the country was object of [[political repression|repression]]s by the government, the [[News media|media]] and the conservative part of Mexican society, until approximately 1984.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maph49.galeon.com/avandaro/ingles/avandaro8.html After Avándaro: the black hole of mexican rock]&lt;/ref&gt; The repression caused a collapse in the young musicians' (and artists in general) creative and social objectives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neoson.mex.tl/132531_NeoSon-Manifesto.html NeoSon Manifesto]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''''Ohara-ryū'''''|小原流|}} is a school of ''[[Ikebana]]'', or [[Japan]]ese [[Floral design|floral art]].

== History ==
Unshin Ohara (小原雲心) (1861-1916) started his own Ikebana school in 1895 when Japan opened up its economy to the West and began to import European flowers. The official founding date was in 1912.&lt;ref name="ohararyu.or.jp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohararyu.or.jp/english/history.html|title=History|publisher=Ohara School of Ikebana | access-date =2016-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the purpose of this art form, he developed shallow, circular, ceramic vases, which became known as the ''[[moribana]]'' style.&lt;ref name="ohararyu.or.jp1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohararyu.or.jp/english/his_what.html|title=What is Moribana?|publisher=Ohara School of Ikebana | access-date =2016-10-18
}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Ohara's son Koun (小原光雲) (1880-1938) invented a descriptive teaching method and moved from individual lessons to group classes. For the first time, teaching certificates were awarded to women. Under Houn's guidance, the school grew. Its headquarters were in Tokyo and Kobe, with other centers in New York and Sao Paulo. He developed the typical landscape style, as well as the ''[[rimpa]]'' and ''[[bunjin]]'' floral arrangements. The inspirations for ''rimpa'' came to him from rolling picture scrolls, screens (''[[byōbu]]'') and painted subjects of the 17th century. Chinese poetry became the foundation for ''bunjin'' arrangements. Houn (小原豊雲) (1908-1995) followed as the third headmaster in 1938.&lt;ref name="ohararyu.or.jp"/&gt; 

Houn's son, Natsuki Ohara (小原夏樹) (1949-1992) in turn was appointed as his successor in 1975. In the same year, the small ''moribana'' style, using semi circle ceramic vases, was developed. On the occasion of the 90th anniversary of the Ohara school in 1985, Natsuki created a new style called ''hana-mai'' (dancing flowers) and later the ''Hana-isho'' forms.&lt;ref name="ohararyu.or.jp1"/&gt; He died in 1992 at age 42 after an illness and was posthumously named as fourth headmaster. In 1995, his father Houn died at age 86. Houn's daughter Wakako Ohara (b. 1940 小原稚子) became interim headmistress until April 2010, when Hiroki Ohara (小原宏貴) became the fifth headmaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ikebanahq.org/ohara.php|title=Ohara School|publisher=Ikebana International | access-date =2016-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ikebanabeta.nwcic.com/schools-of-ikebana/ohara/|title=Ohara|publisher=Ikebana International San Francisco Bay Area Chapter #31 | access-date =2016-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ohararyu.or.jp"/&gt; 

Presently 125 chapters are in Japan and 57 chapters more across the world.&lt;ref name="ohararyu.or.jp"/&gt;

'''''Portrait of Gustave Geffroy''''' is a c. 1895 painting by the French [[Post-Impressionist]] artist [[Paul Cézanne]]. It portrays [[Gustave Geffroy]], a French novelist and [[art critic]] noted as one of the earliest historians of [[Impressionism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dictionaryofarthistorians.org/geffroyg.htm |title=Geffroy, Gustave |publisher=Dictionary of Art Historians |accessdate=2011-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1894, Geffroy wrote a sympathetic article in the periodical ''[[Le Journal (Paris)|Le Journal]]'' praising the work of painter [[Paul Cézanne]] who until then had received little praise in critical circles.&lt;ref name=Newton&gt;Newton, 41-42&lt;/ref&gt; Mutual friend [[Claude Monet]] arranged for a meeting between the two in November of that year which ended abruptly due to Cézanne's oft-noted erratic behavior.&lt;ref name=MurphyA&gt;Murphy, 100-01&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, Geffroy continued to write favorably of Cézanne, believing, "He is a great teller of truth. Passionate and candid, silent and subtle, he will go to [[The Louvre]]."&lt;ref name=MurphyB&gt;Murphy, 163-64&lt;/ref&gt; Cézanne expressed thanks in letters to Geffroy in the months following their meeting and, in a display of gratitude (and possible feeling that Geffroy understood him), he elected to paint Geffroy's [[portrait]].&lt;ref name=Newton/&gt;

The painter sent the critic a request in April 1895, after which Geffroy sat for Cézanne daily over a span of three months in the study at his home in [[Paris]].&lt;ref name=MurphyA/&gt; After the three months' time, Cézanne, disappointed with the portrait's results, fled both the painting and Paris itself for his home in [[Aix-en-Provence]]. In a July 6 letter to Monet, he explained, "I am a little upset at the meager result I obtained, especially after so many sittings and successive bursts of enthusiasm and despair."&lt;ref&gt;Wadley, 103&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been speculated that, despite his words of gratitude in the same letter to Monet noting Geffroy's patience over the three-month span, the artist had built up feelings of resentment, even hostility, toward the critic, causing his abandonment of the project for seclusion in Aix.&lt;ref name=Howard&gt;Howard, 135&lt;/ref&gt; Reasons for the breakdown in relations on Cézanne's part have been attributed to everything from politics to artistic principles to religion.&lt;ref name=Newton/&gt;&lt;ref name=Orsay&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/collections/works-in-focus/painting/commentaire_id/gustave-geffroy-10542.html?tx_commentaire_pi1%5BpidLi%5D=509&amp;tx_commentaire_pi1%5Bfrom%5D=841&amp;cHash=ed05bba678 |title=Paul Cézanne: Gustave Geffroy |publisher=Musée d'Orsay |year=2006 |accessdate=2011-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cézanne was unhappy with the painting and it was never finished, yet ''Portrait of Gustave Geffroy'' became a popular retrospective work after his death.&lt;ref name=Orsay/&gt; [[Cubist]] painters were interested in the [[geometry|geometrical]] dimensions of the bookcase and [[perspective (visual)|perspective]] of vast table space in relation to the rest of the pictorial space.&lt;ref name=Orsay/&gt; Geffroy noted that Cézanne painted the entire canvas at once, leaving the face and hands for last; they were ultimately unfinished.&lt;ref name=Howard/&gt;&lt;ref name=Orsay/&gt; The portrait has been described as angular, with the figure of Geffroy centered as a pyramidal or triangular figure, and surrounded by shelves, books and figurines complementing and converging on top of his profile.&lt;ref&gt;Wadley, 59&lt;/ref&gt; The multiple angles of perspective, particularly with the books both in cases and on the table, have been noted for their "zig-zag" effect on the viewer, creating movement within the painting.&lt;ref name=Howard/&gt;

The portrait has been noted as the continuation of a recurring Cézanne theme: people in their natural environment, reserved and unimposing, immersed in their everyday tasks.&lt;ref name=Schapiro&gt;Schapiro, 100&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been compared to the earlier ''Portrait of Duranty'' by [[Edgar Degas]], from which critics have speculated Cézanne drew inspiration.&lt;ref name=Howard/&gt;&lt;ref name=Orsay/&gt;

The painting was donated to the French state in 1969 by the family of collector [[Auguste Pellerin]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nga.gov.au/exhibition/masterpiecesfromparis/Default.cfm?IRN=191186&amp;BioArtistIRN=21796&amp;MnuID=SRCH&amp;ArtistIRN=21796&amp;ViewID=2 |title=Gustave Geffroy 1895-96 |publisher=National Gallery of Australia |year=2009 |accessdate=2011-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is on permanent display at the [[Musée d'Orsay]] in Paris.

'''Project Gutenberg Australia''', abbreviated as '''PGA''', is an [[Internet]] site which was founded in 2001 by Colin Choat. It is a sister site of [[Project Gutenberg]], though there is no formal relationship between the two organizations. The site hosts free [[ebook]]s or [[e-text]]s which are in the [[public domain]] in [[Australia]]. Volunteers have prepared and submitted the ebooks.

To complement the extensive amount of original source material available in the form of ebooks, a great deal of information about the [[History of Australia|history]] and the [[European maritime exploration of Australia|exploration of Australia]] is provided, together with a "Library of Australiana", a list of ebooks available about Australia or written by Australians.

Because of differences between [[Australian copyright law|Australian]] and [[United States copyright law|United States]] (where Project Gutenberg is based) [[copyright law]], Project Gutenberg Australia contains many works not available in Project Gutenberg, including works by [[Margaret Mitchell]], [[George Orwell]], [[Ayn Rand]], [[H. P. Lovecraft]], [[Edgar Wallace]], [[S. S. Van Dine]] and [[Dylan Thomas]].

With the introduction of the [[U.S.-Australia Free Trade Agreement]], works of authors who died after 31 December 1954 will now not enter the public domain in Australia until at least 1 January 2026. However, all such works which were already public domain under Australian law as of the end of 2004 remain in the public domain, and thus continue to be hosted at Project Gutenberg of Australia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gutenberg.net.au/newsandreviews.html Project Gutenberg Australia, News and Reviews], section ''Changes to Australian Copyright Law''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Round-robin''' is a document signed by multiple parties in a circle to make it more difficult to determine the order in which it was signed, thus preventing a ringleader from being identified.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=round+robin Online Etymology Dictionary: Round Robin]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
[[File:Round Robin image.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jessé de Forest]]'s Round Robin from 1621]]
The term dates from the 17th-century [[French language|French]] ''ruban rond'' (''round [[ribbon]]'').&lt;ref name="Bartleby"&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/81/14554.html Brewer, E. Cobham. Dictionary of Phrase &amp; Fable: Round Robin]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OED"&gt;[http://www.phrases.org.uk/bulletin_board/15/messages/643.html Re: Round Robin], Oxford English Dictionary cited at The Phrase Finder, September 29, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; This described the practice of signatories to petitions against authority (usually Government officials petitioning the [[The Crown|Crown]]) appending their names on a document in a non-hierarchical circle or ribbon pattern (and so disguising the order in which they have signed) so that none may be identified as a [[leader|ringleader]].

This practice was adopted by sailors petitioning officers in the [[Royal Navy]] (first recorded 1731).

==Spanish–American War==
{{main|Round-Robin Letter (Spanish–American War)}}
A round robin letter was authored in Cuba after the cessation of hostilities in 1898 by a committee of 10 brigade commanders of the American Army's V Corps including acting brigade commander [[Theodore Roosevelt]] during the [[Spanish–American War]], to accelerate the departure of the American Army back to the United States during the rainy disease-plagued summer season. This letter was leaked to the press and embarrassed the administration of US President [[William McKinley]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10087">The '''set decorator''' is the head of the set decoration department in the film and television industry, responsible for selecting, designing, fabricating, and sourcing the "[[set dressing]]" elements of each set in a [[Feature film|Feature Film]], [[Television]], or New Media episode or [[Advertising|commercial]], in support the story and characters of the script.  The set decorator is responsible for each décor element inside the sets, from practical lighting, technology, art, furniture, drapery, floor coverings, books, collectables, to exterior furnishings such as satellite dishes, Old West water troughs, streetlamps, traffic lights, garden furniture and sculptures.

While the Set Decorator provides all of these elements, the Propmaster provides elements that are handled by the actor. For example: a library is decorated with set dressing such as the furniture, books, desk lamp, blotter, framed photos, personal effects, letter trays, letter opener, papers, paper files. The Propmaster provides the props – the letter the actor is opening and reading, the pen he writes with, and the ink into which he dips his pen.

==Detailed description of the role of the set decorator==
Set Decorators are a Key Department Heads, hired by the [[Film Producer|Producer]] for their creative talent to implement the visual interpretation of the script and its characters; and for technical skills and expertise in project management including budgeting, scheduling and organizing the Set Decoration Department staff.

Working in partnership with the [[Production Designer]], the [[Film Director|Director]], and the [[Film Producer|Producer]], the Set Decorator researches, budgets, designs and presents set decorating concepts for each set in the script.

Creatively, set dressing elements convey mood, style, time period, location, genre, character, and backstory, and shape the visual imagery of the project. Working with concepts from the Production Designer, approved by the Director/ Producer and Studio, along with drawings and illustrations from the Art Department, the Set Decorator budgets, designs, develops floor plans, sources, builds, schedules and eventually supervises the installation of the set dressing in each set, including industrial equipment, lighting fixtures, graphics, furniture, artwork, drapery, decorative accents, florals, floor coverings, and exterior décor to support the story.

Whether on Feature Films, Television shows, Commercials, Webisodes, or emerging media formats, this work of developing, selecting, and providing the dressing elements of the set is under the direct supervision of the Set Decorator.

==The script breakdown==
The Set Decorator begins each project by breaking down the script. This entails analyzing all scenes of the project, dividing them into sets, and detailing requirements. Each set has a creative concept behind it, partially described in the script and further developed by the Set Decorator in consultation with the Producer, Director and Production Designer.

Each set breakdown evolves into a series of lists of set dressing elements, all of which are budgeted, designed built and sourced. The production schedule and production budget delineate how these lists are achieved.

==Design skills and education==
The visual storytelling vocabulary of a Set Decorator includes history of design, art, architecture &amp; interiors, photography and film, as well as geography, anthropology and psychology. The Decorator is knowledgeable about lighting, technical materials, textiles, mechanics of machinery and technology, paint techniques, construction practices, upholstery and drapery, decorating trends, period details, color theory, and is proficient at spatial furniture layouts for film.

This knowledge combines with strong research, design judgment, cultural understanding, and observation skills to create interior and exterior environments rich in character and style to bring the script to visual life.

== Budgeting ==
The Set Decorator creates a materials budget for the film or episode, and a labor budget based on the production schedule and scope of work. Labor costs are calculated to include overtime, fringes and kit rentals. The budget allows for equipping workshops, expendables, 2nd unit requirements, camera tests, and work performed for the Set Decoration department by other departments and specialty vendors.

Budgeting involves projecting costs for prototypes, and educated guesswork. Set Decorators are familiar with pricing structures for each element and labor required to complete the work within production schedules. Set Decoration budgets may be revised several times in the course of preproduction due to shifting circumstances.

Even after the Producer has approved the Set Decoration budget, the estimate is updated as special requests by the Director, script rewrites, or shifts in schedules bring changes during production. Overseeing creative aspects of Set Decoration while staying within the budget and delivering the sets on time are a key skillsets of the Set Decorator. Producers rely on the accuracy of the Set Decorators budget to ensure that the overall production budget remains within its bounds.

== Collaboration ==
The Set Decorator attends concept production meetings, scouts, safety classes, legal clearance briefings, product placement meetings, and ongoing conferences with the [[Production designer|Production Designer]], [[Film Director|Director]], Producers, the Art Department and Accounting.

The Set Decorator maintains communication with fellow Key Department Heads, including the [[Assistant director|Assistant Director]], [[Director of photography|Director of Photography]], Gaffer, Propmaster, Construction Coordinator, Lead Scenic Artist, [[Location manager|Location Manager]], [[Costume designer|Costume Designer]], [[Greensman]], Special Effects Coordinator, [[Key grip|Key Grip]], [[Sound mixer|Sound Mixer]], Visual Effects Producer, and Stunt Coordinator.  This ensures a smooth flow of information to fulfill the visual and technical requirements of the production.

The Set Decorator opens every set ensuring that the Director is satisfied, and makes any changes necessary.

== Scheduling ==
The Set Decorator works with his or her staff to develop a schedule of fabricating and procuring the set dressing elements. Working with the Leadperson, the Dress/Strike schedule is developed, dictated by the shooting schedule. This defines the labor budget for the Set Decoration department.

The Set Decorator schedules and supervises the work of the Assistant Set Decorators, Leadperson, Buyers, Budget Tracker, On-Set Dressers, Property Persons, Drapers and Upholsterers, and all inside and outside manufacturers

== Staffing ==
The Set Decorator selects, acquires, and oversees designs and builds for all the set dressing, He or she supervises the Assistant Decorators and Buyers as they source elements, and gives final approval to all choices.

Once the set dressing is prepared, the Leadperson supervises the transportation of all elements to the sets. After delivery to the stage or location, the Set Decorator directs the Set Dressing crew in the decoration of the set, following Safety Guidelines, [[IATSE]] Union Contracts and industry past practice. The Leadman and Dressing crew work as a team within compressed schedules and side by side with Art Direction, Construction, Locations, Paint, Set Lighting, Grip, and Special Effects. Set maintenance plays a large part for long-term sets for many films and TV shows.

It is the second scene in the chronological sequence on the ceiling, depicting the third and fourth day of the [[Genesis creation narrative|Creation narrative]]. 

On the left side of the painting God is depicted from behind, extending his arm towards a bush, alluding to the plant world. On the right side another image of God points towards the Sun with his right hand and toward the faint Moon with his left. His face expresses the force needed for the creation of the abode of living beings. The abstract patterns of [[drapery]] emphasize the motion of both figures of God.

''The Creation of the Sun, Moon and Planets'' is featured on the postage stamps of Vatican City (issue of 1994) and India (issue of 1975).

'''''The Sly Old Cat''''' is a children's book written and illustrated by [[Beatrix Potter]] in 1906, and first published by Frederick Warne &amp; Co. in 1971, almost thirty years after her death. The story tells of a cat who invites a rat to a tea party with the intention of eating him, but the rat outwits her and leaves the party with a muffin in a paper bag.

The story was written in 1906 for her publisher's daughter, and was intended to be published in 1907 as a panorama book, a long strip of paper with text and illustrations that folded into a wallet. Booksellers objected to the format, because the item was too difficult to keep folded and in its place once customers opened it for examination. The tale was set aside. In 1916, it was again considered for publication but, again, set aside. Potter's eyesight was failing and she did not want to become involved in the labour of developing a book for publication. It was first published in 1971 with Potter's rough sketches. The book was critically well received.

==Plot==
A cat invites a rat to her tea party. She eats her bread and leaves only crumbs for the rat. She drinks her tea and leaves only drops of milk for the rat. The rat believes she will eat him for dessert and wishes he had not come. When the cat raises the milk jug to drink the last of the milk, the rat gives the jug a pat and it slips down over the cat's head. She bangs about the kitchen unable to free herself. The rat sips some tea, puts a muffin in a paper bag, and leaves. Later, he eats the muffin.

==Composition and publication==
Potter wrote the book in 1906 for her publisher's daughter, Nellie Warne. Publication was intended for 1907 as a companion piece to the panorama books, ''[[The Story of A Fierce Bad Rabbit]]'' and ''[[The Story of Miss Moppet]]'', but booksellers objected to the panorama format which was nothing more than a long paper strip of illustrations and text that folded accordion-fashion into a wallet and was tied with a ribbon. It was difficult to keep such a book folded and enclosed in its wallet after curious customers opened it for examination. The story was set aside.&lt;ref name="Taylor130"&gt;Taylor 1987, p. 130&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1916, the story was again considered for publication but in the standard small book format of the Peter Rabbit library rather than the panorama format.&lt;ref name="Lear280"&gt;Lear 2007, p. 280&lt;/ref&gt; The title was announced on an [[endpaper]] as ''The Story of the Sly Old Cat'' but Potter's watercolours were never prepared for printing.  Her eyesight was failing and she did not look forward to the work involved in preparing the book for publication.  She suggested [[Ernest Aris]] for the job, but the book only reached a rough draft stage.  The story was first published in 1971 with Potter's rough sketches.  The book is not included in the standard small format library of 23 Peter Rabbit books.&lt;ref name="MacDonald50"&gt;MacDonald 1986, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical commentary==
''The Sly Old Cat'' is told mainly in monosyllables, and is critically considered "perfect in its fusion of word and picture, and visually reminiscent of [[Randolph Caldecott]] in its rythmic narrative flow."&lt;ref name="Taylor130"/&gt;

== Social ==
'''Wheelchair dancing''' is a popular social and recreational activity, with participants in over 40 countries.&lt;ref name="Rogers-2001"/&gt; The physical benefits of wheelchair dancing include the maintenance of physical balance, flexibility, range of motion, coordination and improved respiratory control. The psychological effects of [[ballroom dancing]] are social interaction and the development of relationships. For social dancers, it is an opportunity to engage in a fun and a friendly event with others. For competitors, it assists in the development of fair play, sportsmanship and communication skills. Wheelchair dancing is an activity that integrates the wheelchair user and able-bodied person.&lt;ref name="Goldberg-2011"/&gt;&lt;!-- this article says more-or-less the same as the above, which is mostly common sense anyway, but was not "the" source for it --&gt;

== Courses ==
In February, 2008 the [[University of Delaware]] Collegiate DanceWheels Program was created to instruct students in wheelchair dancing. This is the first accredited course of its kind in the United States. The program was developed in conjunction with the American DanceWheels Foundation through a grant from the [[Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation]].&lt;ref name="Buck-2008"/&gt;

Princess '''Wijdan Ali''' ({{lang-ar|وجدان علي}}) (born 29 August 1939 in [[Baghdad]], Iraq) is a [[Jordan]]ian artist, art historian, educator and diplomat.&lt;ref name=grove&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=un4WcfEASZwC&amp;pg=PA53 |title=Ali, Wijdan, Princess |encyclopedia=The Grove Encyclopedia of Islamic Art and Architecture |year=2009 |ISBN=019530991X |page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is the ex-wife of Prince 'Ali bin Naif of Jordan. She is best known for her efforts to revive the traditions of Islamic art and her abstract paintings and for her work as an art historian.

==Education and career==
Born, Sharifa Wijdan bint Fawwaz in Baghdad on  29 August 1939 into a noble family, she was raised in Jordan. She was the daughter of architect, Sharif Fawwaz Muhana and his wife, Sharifa Nafi'a bint Jamil Ali. Both her parents could trace their ancestry to the Prophet Mohammed, which allowed her to given the title of ''Sharifa''.&lt;ref&gt;The titles, ''Sharif'' and ''Sharifa'' which roughly translate as ''noble'', are honorific titles given to those who can tace their ancestry to Islamic prophet Mohammed. ''Encyclopedia.com,''[https://www.encyclopedia.com/international/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/wijdan-ali-1939 Online:]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, she joined the Foreign Office of the United Nations in Jordan, shortly after completing her [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in Middle Eastern history from Beirut University College (1961), now the [[Lebanese American University]].&lt;ref&gt;"Princess Wijdan Ali:Interview" ''Nafas Arts Magazine,'' December, 2003, Online: https://universes.art/nafas/articles/2003/princess-wijdan-ali/&lt;/ref&gt; She was the first woman to enter the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Jordan (1962) and also the first woman delegate to represent Jordan at [[United Nations]] meetings&lt;ref name=who/&gt; and the first female diplomat at the [[United Nations General Assembly]].

While working as a diplomat, she was studying art privately and received some of her early arts training from French teacher, Alice Ladoux.&lt;ref&gt;Ibrahim, L., "Journey through Art: Princes Wijdan Ali," ''The Star,'' December 2002, in the Khalid Foundation Press Clippings, [http://thekhalidshomanfoundation.org/main/activit/press_clips/htm/wijdan.html Online:]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966, following her marriage to Prince 'Ali bin Naif the second son of the ruling Hashemite family on Jordan, she resigned from her diplomatic post and began to take art seriously. She then began to study art formally with Jordanian artists, [[Muhanna Al-Dura]] and Armando Bruno.&lt;ref&gt;Hashem Talham, G., ''Historical Dictionary of Women in the Middle East and North Africa,'' Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2013  p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; She received a [[Ph.D.]] in Islamic art from the [[University of London]] in 1993.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;

Wijdan Ali is both a contemporary painter and art historian. Her art explores themes of universal tragedy, especially dramatic events in Arab history, such as the Karbala series, which explores the tragedy that occurred in seventh century Karbala, when the Prophet Mohammed’s grandson, [[Husayn ibn Ali|Hussein]], was martyred.&lt;ref name="mjmes.wordpress.com"&gt;Mavrakis, N., "The Hurufiyah Art Movement in Middle Eastern Art," ''McGill Journal of Middle Eastern Studies Blog,'' [https://mjmes.wordpress.com/2013/03/08/article-5/ Online:]&lt;/ref&gt; She also uses the motif of Islamic calligraphy as a graphic form, which was itself a revival of a traditional art form.&lt;ref&gt;Zuhur, S. (ed), ''Colors of Enchantment: Theater, Dance, Music, and the Visual Arts of the Middle East,'' American University in Cairo Press, 2001, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; Her writing explores the rise and fall of an Islamic aesthetic in Islamic art and the dilution of centuries-long traditions, with the arrival of colonialism in North Africa and the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;Ramadan, K.D., ''Peripheral Insider: Perspectives on Contemporary Internationalism in Visual Culture,'' Museum Tusculanum Press, 2007, p. 49; Palumbo, G., "Omages of Piety or Power?

She is founder of the [[Royal Society of Fine Arts (Jordan)|Royal Society of Fine Arts]] and of the [[Jordan National Gallery of Fine Arts]]. She is also founder and dean of the newly established Faculty of Arts and Design at the [[University of Jordan]].&lt;ref name=soas&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.soas.ac.uk/about/fellows/hrh-princess-wijdan-bint-fawaz-al-hashemi/ |title=HRH Princess Wijdan bint Fawaz Al-Hashemi |publisher=SOAS, University of London}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is also a patron of the arts and has curated a number of exhibitions of Islamic art.&lt;ref&gt;Malt, C., ''Women's Voices In Middle East Museums: Case Studies In Jordan,'' Syracuse University Press, 2005, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
In her art, she develops the traditions of Arabic calligraphy in a modern format and, as such, she forms part of the contemporary school of Arabic calligraphic painting.&lt;ref name=Talhami/&gt; Due to her use of Arabic calligraphy as a graphic form, she has been described as a pioneer of the ''[[Hurufiyya movement|Hurufiyyah Art Movement]]''. &lt;ref name="mjmes.wordpress.com"/&gt; Her work, which has won [[award]]s in [[Belgium]] and [[France]], is found in [[museum]]s and private collections internationally, including the collections of the [[British Museum]], the [[Ashmolean Museum]], the American [[National Museum of Women in the Arts]] and the [[National Art Gallery, Pakistan]].&lt;ref name=soas/&gt; She has participated in the cross cultural cooperation " the Dance of Visions" in Gothenburg Sweden, invited by the Swedish artist [[Ragnhild Lundén]]. Her best known art works are a series of shimmering desert-scapes made during the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Teller, M., ''Jordan,'' Rough Guides,'' 2002, p. 425&lt;/ref&gt;

She is a highly respected historian of Islamic art,&lt;ref&gt;''Who's Who in the Arab World 2007-2008'', Publitec Publications, pp 88-89&lt;/ref&gt; and has authored, edited and contributed to a number of books, including  several devoted to female artists in the Islamic world.&lt;ref&gt;Sinclair, S. (ed), ''Bibliography of Art and Architecture in the Islamic World,'' BRILL,  2012, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3052">'''YoloArts''' (formerly known as the '''Yolo County Arts Council''') is a [[non-profit organization]], founded in 1981 as a recommendation of the [[Yolo County]] Cultural Plan to further the arts and culture of the county.

YoloArts mission is to cultivate and advocate support for all the arts, to participate in advancement of arts education in ours schools and community, and to foster communication among artists, business, education, government, and the residents of Yolo County.

==Programs==
YoloArts is known for its Arts Education and Outreach Programs which include Artists in Schools, ArtMix, Blues in YoloSchools, the Art &amp; Ag Project, Art in Public Places, Artists Workshops, YoloArts Musical Tour and Exhibitions at Gallery 625.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://yoloarts.org/programs-and-services | title=Art Education and Outreach Programs | accessdate=May 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition==
In 2012, [[National Endowment for the Arts]] chairman Rocco Landesman visited YoloArts to learn more about their Art &amp; Ag Project which has local Yolo County Artists interacting with local farmers at their farms to create artwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=WDDB&amp;p_theme=wddb&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;s_dispstring=allfields%28Art%20%2526%20Ag%20Project%29%20AND%20date%282012%29&amp;p_field_date-0=YMD_date&amp;p_params_date-0=date:B,E&amp;p_text_date-0=2012&amp;p_field_advanced-0=&amp;p_text_advanced-0=%28%22Art%22%20%26%20%22Ag%20Project%22%29&amp;xcal_numdocs=20&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;xcal_useweights=no | date=February 22, 2012 |title=Smith: Woodland put on the national map for 'Ag &amp; Art'| agency=The Daily Democrat | accessdate=May 14, 2012 | author=Smith, Jim}}{{registration required|date=May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The artists get regular, and safe, access to the landscapes they wish to paint or photograph. Farmers, in turn, benefit as well, with often publicly displayed art showcasing their land.

“This program has reminded people that the countryside is beautiful and the farmland is beautiful and if we don’t pay attention, it could be gone,” said Esparto resident Claire Haag, whose marriage is an art and ag project in itself — she’s a painter and her husband, James, is a [[walnut]] grower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.davisenterprise.com/local-news/ag-environment/ag-and-art-project-brings-nea-chair-to-yolo-county/ | title=Ag and Art Project brings NEA chair to Yolo | date=February 22, 2012 | agency=The Davis Enterprise | accessdate=May 14, 2012 | author=Ternus-Bellamy, Anne}}&lt;/ref&gt; Locally, the Art and Ag Project is celebrated every fall with an Art Farm Exhibition Gala that features an Art Harvest and Taste of Yolo. There farmers can often be found bidding on the artwork depicting their own land and homes.

'''Yuri Ivanovitch Manin''' ({{lang-ru|Ю́рий Ива́нович Ма́нин}}; born 1937) is a Russian mathematician, known for work in [[algebraic geometry]] and [[diophantine geometry]], and many expository works ranging from [[mathematical logic]] to [[theoretical physics]]. Moreover, Manin was one of the first to propose the idea of a [[quantum computer]] in [[Timeline of quantum computing|1980]] with his book "Computable and Uncomputable".&lt;ref name="manin1980vychislimoe"&gt;{{cite book| author=Manin, Yu. I.| title=Vychislimoe i nevychislimoe|trans-title=Computable and Noncomputable| year=1980| publisher=Sov.Radio| url=http://publ.lib.ru/ARCHIVES/M/MANIN_Yuriy_Ivanovich/Manin_Yu.I._Vychislimoe_i_nevychislimoe.%281980%29.%5Bdjv%5D.zip| pages=13–15| language=Russian| accessdate=2013-03-04| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510173823/http://publ.lib.ru/ARCHIVES/M/MANIN_Yuriy_Ivanovich/Manin_Yu.I._Vychislimoe_i_nevychislimoe.%281980%29.%5Bdjv%5D.zip| archivedate=2013-05-10| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
Manin gained a doctorate in 1960 at the [[Steklov Mathematics Institute]] as a student of [[Igor Shafarevich]]. He is now a Professor at the [[Max-Planck-Institut für Mathematik]] in [[Bonn]], and a professor [[emeritus]] at [[Northwestern University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mpim-bonn.mpg.de/node/99|title=Yuri Manin {{!}} Max Planck Institute for Mathematics|website=www.mpim-bonn.mpg.de|language=en|access-date=2018-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.math.northwestern.edu/people/emeriti/ |title=Emeriti Faculty: Department of Mathematics - Northwestern University |website=www.math.northwestern.edu |language=en |access-date=2018-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manin's early work included papers on the arithmetic and [[formal group]]s of [[abelian varieties]], the [[Mordell conjecture]] in the [[global function field|function field]] case, and [[algebraic differential equation]]s. The [[Gauss–Manin connection]] is a basic ingredient of the study of [[cohomology]] in families of [[algebraic varieties]]. He wrote a book on [[cubic surface]]s and [[cubic form]]s, showing how to apply both classical and contemporary methods of algebraic geometry, as well as [[nonassociative algebra]]. He also indicated the role of the [[Brauer group]], via [[Grothendieck]]'s theory of global [[Azumaya algebra]]s, in accounting for obstructions to the [[Hasse principle]], setting off a generation of further work. He also formulated the [[Manin conjecture]], which predicts the asymptotic behaviour of the number of rational points of bounded height on algebraic varieties. He has further written on [[Yang–Mills theory]], [[quantum information]], and [[mirror symmetry (string theory)|mirror symmetry]].

Manin had over 40 doctoral students, including [[Vladimir Berkovich]], [[Mariusz Wodzicki]], [[Alexander Beilinson]], [[Ivan Cherednik]], [[Alexei Skorobogatov]], [[Vladimir Drinfeld]], [[Mikhail Kapranov]], [[Vyacheslav Shokurov]], [[Arend Bayer]] and [[Victor Kolyvagin]], as well as foreign students including [[Hà Huy Khoái]], now the most senior mathematician in Vietnam.   He was awarded the [[Brouwer Medal]] in 1987, the [[Schock Prize]] in 1999 and the [[Cantor Medal]] in 2002.  In 1994, he was awarded the [[Nemmers Prize in Mathematics]]. In 2010, he received the [[Bolyai Prize]] of the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]].

In 1990 he became foreign member of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.knaw.nl/en/members/foreign-members/4514 |title=Y.I.
