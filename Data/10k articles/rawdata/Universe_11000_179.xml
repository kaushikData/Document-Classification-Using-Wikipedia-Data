From 2 to 3 May 2018, high-velocity [[dust storm]]s swept across parts of [[North India]] and  more than 125 people died  and  over 200 injured. 

In [[Uttar Pradesh]], 43 died in the city of [[Agra]] and at least 30 died elsewhere in the state. In neighboring [[Rajasthan]], at least 35 people died and over 200 were injured after winds downed more than 8,000 electricity poles and uprooted hundreds of trees. Storms are not uncommon in the region; however, because these storms occurred at night and with greater wind speeds than average, the death toll was higher than usual.

==Background==
Dust storms are a feature of India's seasonal weather patterns.&lt;ref name=Nat_Geo /&gt; The storms typically occur in the summer months, when the weather has been dry to allow dust to be picked up by passing winds. The death toll in such storms rarely exceeds 12; a previous storm hit India on 11 April 2018, killing 19 people&lt;ref name=Nat_Geo /&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-43987209 | title=  India dust storms: Nearly 100 killed in  Agra,Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan | work = [[BBC]] |date =3 May 2018 | accessdate = 3 May 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Storm and damage==
The dust storm occurred at the start of India's [[Monsoon of South Asia|monsoon]] season.&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/03/asia/india-dust-storms-intl/index.html | title = More than 110 killed by high-intensity dust storms in India | first1 = Swati | last1 = Gupta | first2= Ben | last2=  Westcott | date = 3 May 2018 | accessdate = 3 May 2018 | work = [[CNN]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the days prior, region meteorologists had forecast thunderstorms and high winds to occur over that week. Contributing to the storm was a period of abnormally high temperatures for the region, which increased the intensity of the weather system.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/03/world/asia/india-dust-storm.html | title = Devastating Dust Storm Strikes India, Killing at Least 94 | first1 = Suhasini | last1 = Raj | first2=Kai | last2 = Schultz | date = 3 May 2018 | accessdate = 3 May 2018 | work = [[The New York Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dust storm first started late on 2 May 2018, predominantly hitting the states of [[Uttar Pradesh]] and [[Rajasthan]].&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; At least 73 people were killed in Uttar Pradesh, with 43 of those in the city of [[Agra]];&lt;ref name="CNN"/&gt; 21 people have been reported killed in [[Kheragarh]], a town around 50&amp;nbsp;km south-west of the city.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; At least 35 people were killed in Rajasthan,&lt;ref name="CNN"/&gt; with the [[Alwar district|Alwar]] district being the worst hit; the [[Bharatpur district|Bharatpur]] and [[Dholpur district|Dholpur]] districts were also affected.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; Four people died in the state of [[Uttarakhand]],&lt;ref name="CNN"/&gt; and [[Delhi]] was also affected.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; More than 200 people were injured by the storm.&lt;ref name="CNN"/&gt;

Officials stated that the storm was more devastating than prior dust storms as the stronger weather system carried more debris which caused more damage to homes and buildings, and because it struck at night, most were asleep and were unable to take precautions, leaving many killed or injured by falling structures.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; Most damage and fatalities were associated with high winds, rather than dust.&lt;ref name=Nat_Geo&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2018/05/india-dust-storm-wind-fatalities-science-spd/ |title=Why This Dust Storm in India Turned Deadly |author=Sarah Gibbens |journal=National Geographic |date=3 May 2018 |accessdate=4 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Rajasthan, electricity supplies were interrupted by 200–300 downed pylons, and schools were closed in the Alwar district.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt;

Because conditions were still prime for more severe weather, the Uttar Pradesh government continued to plan to alert its citizens to weather conditions for the following 48 hours.&lt;ref name="CNN"/&gt;

==Aftermath==
The [[Government of Uttar Pradesh]] has announced compensation for the relatives of those killed amounting to {{INRConvert|4|l|lk=on}}.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt;

[[File:Tornado Damage, Illinois 2.JPG|right|thumb|This [[tornado]] damage to an [[Illinois]] home could be considered an "act of God" for insurance purposes in the United States, if the insurance policy did not specifically account for tornadoes.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}]]

In legal usage throughout the [[English-speaking world]], an '''act of God'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Black |first=Henry Campbell |title=Black's Law Dictionary |isbn=0-314-76271-X |publisher=West Publishing Co. |year=1990 |edition=6th |page=33 |location=[[Saint Paul, Minnesota]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[natural hazard]] outside human control, such as an [[earthquake]] or [[tsunami]], for which no person can be held responsible. An act of God may amount to an exception to liability in contracts (as under the [[Hague–Visby Rules]]);&lt;ref&gt; Art. IV (2) "Neither the carrier nor the ship shall be responsible for loss or damage arising or resulting from:  ...  (d) Act of God"&lt;/ref&gt; or it may be an "insured peril" in an [[insurance policy]].&lt;ref&gt; Marine Insurance Act 1906 - RULES FOR CONSTRUCTION OF POLICY&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, other extraordinary man-made or political events  are deemed ''[[force majeure]]''.&lt;ref&gt; such as the closure of the Shatt-al-Arab waterway - ''The Bamburi'' [1982] I LLR3122&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contract law ==
In the law of [[contract]]s, an act of God may be interpreted as an implied defense under the rule of [[impossibility]] or [[impracticability]]. If so, the promise is discharged because of unforeseen occurrences, which were unavoidable and would result in insurmountable delay, expense, or other [[material breach]].

Under the English [[ common law]], contractual obligations were deemed sacrosanct, so failure to honour a contract could lead to an order for [[specific performance]] or internment in a [[debtor's prison]].  In 1863, this harsh rule was softened by the case of ''[[Taylor v Caldwell]]'' which  introduced the doctrine of [[Frustration of purpose|frustration of contract]], which provided that "where a contract becomes impossible to perform and neither party is at fault, both parties may be excused their obligations".  In this case, a music hall was burned down by act of God before a contract of hire could be fulfilled, and the court deemed the contract frustrated.

In other contracts, such as [[Indemnity|indemnification]], an act of God may be no excuse, and in fact may be the central risk assumed by the promisor—''e.g.,'' [[flood insurance]] or [[crop insurance]]—the only variables being the timing and extent of the damage. In many cases, failure by way of ignoring obvious risks due to "natural phenomena" will not be sufficient to excuse performance of the obligation, even if the events are relatively rare: ''e.g.,'' the [[year 2000 problem]] in computers. Under the [[Uniform Commercial Code]], 2-615, failure to deliver goods sold may be excused by an "act of God" if the absence of such act was a "basic assumption" of the contract, and the act has made the delivery "[[commercially impracticable]]".

Recently, human activities have been claimed to be the root causes of some events until now considered natural disasters. In particular:
* [[Geothermal]] injections of water provoking earthquakes ([[Basel]], Switzerland, 2003)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/wissenschaft/technik/beben-nach-erdwaermeprojekt-gericht-spricht-schweizer-geologen-frei-a-668549.html |title=Beben nach Erdwärmeprojekt - Gericht spricht Schweizer Geologen frei |date=22 December 2009 |accessdate=28 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Drilling]] provoking [[mud volcano]] ([[Java]], 2008)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2008/06/09_lusi.shtml |title=Javan mud volcano triggered by drilling, not quake |author2=Robert Sanders |first=Claire |last=Whitelaw |date=9 June 2008 |accessdate=22 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such events are possibly threatening the legal status of acts of God and may establish liabilities where none existed until now.

== Tort law ==

===UK – England and Wales===

An act of God is an unforeseeable natural phenomenon. Explained by [[John Hobhouse, Baron Hobhouse of Woodborough|Lord Hobhouse]] in ''[[Transco plc v Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council]]'' as describing an event:
{{ordered list|list_style_type=lower-roman
| which involves no human agency
| which is not realistically possible to guard against
| which is due directly and exclusively to natural causes and
| which could not have been prevented by any amount of foresight, plans, and care.}}

===UK – Scotland===

An act of God is described in ''Tennant v. Earl of Glasgow'' (1864 2 M (HL) 22) as: "Circumstances which no human foresight can provide against, and of which human prudence is not bound to recognize the possibility, and which when they do occur, therefore, are calamities that do not involve the obligation of paying for the consequences that may result from them."

===United States===
In the law of [[tort]]s, an ''act of God'' may be asserted as a type of intervening cause, the lack of which would have avoided the cause or diminished the result of liability (e.g., but for the earthquake, the old, poorly constructed building would be standing). However, foreseeable results of unforeseeable causes may still raise liability. For example, a bolt of lightning strikes a ship carrying volatile compressed gas, resulting in the expected explosion. Liability may be found if the carrier did not use [[duty of care|reasonable care]] to protect against sparks—regardless of their origins. Similarly, [[strict liability]] could defeat a defense for an ''act of God'' where the defendant has created the conditions under which any accident would result in harm. For example, a long-haul truck driver takes a shortcut on a back road and the load is lost when the road is destroyed in an unforeseen flood. Other cases find that a common carrier is not liable for the unforeseeable forces of nature. See e.g. Memphis &amp; Charlestown RR Co. v. Reeves, 77 U.S. 176 (1870).

A particularly interesting example is that of "rainmaker" [[Charles Hatfield]], who was hired in 1915 by the city of [[San Diego, California|San Diego]] to fill the Morena reservoir to capacity with rainwater for $10,000. The region was soon flooded by heavy rains, nearly bursting the reservoir's dam, killing nearly 20 people, destroying 110 bridges (leaving 2), knocking out [[telephone]] and [[telegraph]] lines, and causing an estimated $3.5 million in damage in total. When the city refused to pay him (he had forgotten to sign the contract), he sued the city. The floods were ruled an act of God, excluding him from liability but also from payment.

==In theology==

The phrase "act of God" is sometimes used to attribute an event to divine intervention. Often it is used in conjunction with a [[natural disaster]] or tragic event. A [[miracle]], by contrast, is often considered a fortuitous event attributed to divine intervention. Some consider it separate from ''acts of nature'' and being related to fate or [[destiny]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Introductory Session – Four Theories of Disaster |work= |publisher=FEMA Emergency Management Institute |date= |url=http://training.fema.gov/EMIWeb/edu/docs/hazdem/Session%205%20--%20The%20Four%20Theories%20of%20Disaster.doc |format= |doi= |accessdate=30 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''anisodesmic crystal''' (sometimes '''anisodemic crystal''') is a [[crystal]] containing [[chemical bond|bonds]] with differing electrostatic valencies.  All other crystals are known as [[isodesmic crystal]]s (or isodemic) and examples include [[diamond]] and [[halite]].  These terms are of particular importance when discussing the structural chemistry of [[mineral]]s.

The electrostatic valency is a measure of the strength of bonds, being the [[valence charge]] divided by the [[coordination number]].  [[Linus Pauling]]'s second rule of ionic bonding, the ''Electrostatic Valence Principle'' states, "An ionic structure will be stable to the extent that the sum of the strengths of the electrostatic bonds that reach an anion equals the charge on that anion."

When there is more than one type of bonding in a crystal, strongly anisotropic physical properties can result such as those of [[graphite]].  Many other substances have anisotropic physical properties. Such properties are directly related to the atomic structures of the substances. Conversely, [[halite]] is an example of an isotropic crystal with equal hardness in all directions.

'''Antibiosis''' is a [[biological interaction]] between two or more [[organism]]s that is detrimental to at least one of them; it can also be an antagonistic association between an organism and the metabolic substances produced by another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=antibiosis| encyclopedia=The Free Dictionary | url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/antibiosis}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of antibiosis include the relationship between [[antibiotics]] and [[bacteria]] or animals and disease-causing [[pathogen]]s. The study of antibiosis and its role in antibiotics has led to the expansion of knowledge in the field of microbiology. Molecular processes such cell wall synthesis and recycling, for example, have become better understood through the study of how antibiotics affect beta-lactam development through the antibiosis relationship and interaction of the particular drugs with the bacteria subjected to the compound.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=KF|first=Kong|date=January 2010|title=Beta-lactam antibiotics: from antibiosis to resistance and bacteriology|journal=APMIS : Acta pathologica, microbiologica, et immunologica Scandinavica|volume=118|issue=1|pages=1–36|pmid=20041868|pmc=2894812|doi=10.1111/j.1600-0463.2009.02563.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Antibiosis is typically studied in host [[plant]] populations and extends to the [[insect]]s which feed upon them.

"Antibiosis resistance affects the biology of the insect so pest abundance and subsequent damage is reduced compared to that which would have occurred if the insect was on a susceptible crop variety. Antibiosis resistance often results in increased mortality or reduced longevity and reproduction of the insect."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Teetes |first=George L. |title=Plant Resistance to Insects: A Fundamental Component of IPM |url=http://ipmworld.umn.edu/chapters/teetes.htm |work=Radcliffe's IPM World Textbook |publisher=University of Minnesota |accessdate=2011-11-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324195935/http://ipmworld.umn.edu/chapters/teetes.htm |archivedate=2012-03-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Digon on circle.png|thumb|Antipodal points on a [[circle]] are 180 degrees apart.]]

In [[mathematics]], the '''antipodal point''' of a point on the surface of a sphere is the point which is [[diameter|diametrically]] opposite to it — so situated that a line drawn from the one to the other passes through the center of the sphere and forms a true diameter.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Antipodes|volume=2|pages=133-134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This term applies to opposite points on a [[circle]] or any [[n-sphere]].

An antipodal point is sometimes called an '''antipode''', a [[back-formation]] from the [[Greek language|Greek]] [[loan word]] ''antipodes'',  which originally meant "opposite the feet".

== Theory ==
In [[mathematics]], the concept of ''antipodal points'' is generalized to [[sphere]]s of any dimension: two points on the sphere are antipodal if they are opposite ''through the centre''; for example, taking the centre as [[Origin (mathematics)|origin]], they are points with related [[vector (geometry)|vector]]s '''v''' and &amp;minus;'''v'''. On a [[circle]], such points are also called '''diametrically opposite'''. In other words, each line through the centre intersects the sphere in two points, one for each [[Line (mathematics)#Ray|ray]] out from the centre, and these two points are antipodal.

The [[Borsuk&amp;ndash;Ulam theorem]] is a result from [[algebraic topology]] dealing with such pairs of points. It says that any [[continuous function]] from ''S''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; to '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; maps some pair of antipodal points in ''S''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; to the same point in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;. Here, ''S''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; denotes the ''n''-dimensional sphere in (''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)-dimensional space (so the "ordinary" sphere is ''S''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and a circle is ''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;).

The '''antipodal map''' ''A'' : ''S''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; → ''S''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, defined by ''A''(''x'') = &amp;minus;''x'', sends every point on the sphere to its antipodal point. It is [[homotopy|homotopic]] to the [[identity function|identity map]] if ''n'' is odd, and its [[Degree of a continuous mapping|degree]] is (&amp;minus;1)&lt;sup&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sup&gt;.

If one wants to consider antipodal points as identified, one passes to [[projective space]] (see also [[projective Hilbert space]], for this idea as applied in [[quantum mechanics]]).

== Antipodal pair of points on a convex polygon ==
An antipodal pair of a convex polygon is a pair of 2 points admitting 2 infinite parallel lines being tangent to both points included in the antipodal without crossing any other line of the convex polygon.

{{short description| Buoyancy principle in fluid dynamics }}
{{Continuum mechanics|fluid}}
'''Archimedes' principle''' states that the upward [[buoyancy|buoyant force]] that is exerted on a body immersed in a [[fluid]], whether fully or partially submerged, is equal to the [[weight]] of the fluid that the body [[displacement (fluid)|displaces]] and acts in the upward direction at the center of mass of the displaced fluid.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.khanacademy.org/science/physics/fluids/buoyant-force-and-archimedes-principle/a/buoyant-force-and-archimedes-principle-article&lt;/ref&gt; Archimedes' principle is a [[law of physics]] fundamental to fluid mechanics. It was formulated by [[Archimedes|Archimedes of Syracuse]].&lt;ref name="acottLaw"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Acott, Chris |title=The diving "Law-ers": A brief resume of their lives. |journal=[[South Pacific Underwater Medicine Society Journal]] |volume=29 |issue=1 |year=1999 |issn=0813-1988 |oclc=16986801 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/5990 |accessdate=2009-06-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Explanation==
[[Image:Principio di Archimede galleggiamento.png|thumb|A floating ship's weight F&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; and its buoyancy F&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; must be equal in size.]]
In ''[[On Floating Bodies]]'', Archimedes suggested that (c. 250 BC):
{{Quotation|Any object, wholly or partially immersed in a fluid, is buoyed up by a force equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object.}}

Practically, Archimedes' principle allows the buoyancy of an object partially or fully immersed in a fluid to be calculated. The downward force on the object is simply its weight. The upward, or buoyant, force on the object is that stated by Archimedes' principle, above. Thus, the net force on the object is the difference between the magnitudes of the buoyant force and its weight. If this net force is positive, the object rises; if negative, the object sinks; and if zero, the object is neutrally buoyant - that is, it remains in place without either rising or sinking. In simple words, Archimedes' principle states that, when a body is partially or completely immersed in a fluid, it experiences an apparent loss in weight that is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the immersed part of the body.

==Formula==

Consider a cuboid immersed in a fluid, with one (hence two: top and bottom) of its sides orthogonal to the direction of gravity (assumed constant across the cube's stretch). The fluid will exert a [[normal force]] on each face, but only the normal forces on top and bottom will contribute to buoyancy. The [[pressure]] difference between the bottom and the top face is directly proportional to the height (difference in depth of submersion). Multiplying the pressure difference by the area of a face gives a net force on the cuboid – the buoyancy, equaling in size the weight of the fluid displaced by the cuboid. By summing up sufficiently many arbitrarily small cuboids this reasoning may be extended to irregular shapes, and so, whatever the shape of the submerged body, the buoyant force is equal to the weight of the displaced fluid. 
:&lt;math&gt;\text{ weight of displaced fluid} = \text{weight of object in vacuum} - \text{weight of object in fluid}\,&lt;/math&gt;

The [[weight]] of the displaced fluid is directly proportional to the volume of the displaced fluid (if the surrounding fluid is of uniform density). The weight of the object in the fluid is reduced, because of the force acting on it, which is called upthrust. In simple terms, the principle states that the buoyant force (F&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;) on an object is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object, or the [[density]] ([[Rho|ρ]]) of the fluid multiplied by the submerged volume (V) times the [[Gravity of Earth|gravity]] (g) or  F&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; = [[Rho|ρ]] x g x V.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.khanacademy.org/science/physics/fluids/buoyant-force-and-archimedes-principle/a/buoyant-force-and-archimedes-principle-article&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, among completely submerged objects with equal masses, objects with greater volume have greater buoyancy.

Suppose a rock's weight is measured as 10 [[Newton (unit)|newton]]s when suspended by a string in a [[vacuum]] with gravity acting on it. Suppose that, when the rock is lowered into water, it displaces water of weight 3 newtons. The force it then exerts on the string from which it hangs would be 10 newtons minus the 3 newtons of buoyant force: 10&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;3 = 7 newtons. Buoyancy reduces the apparent weight of objects that have sunk completely to the sea floor. It is generally easier to lift an object up through the water than it is to pull it out of the water.

For a fully submerged object, Archimedes' principle can be reformulated as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;\text{apparent immersed weight} = \text{weight of object} - \text{weight of displaced fluid}\,&lt;/math&gt;

then inserted into the quotient of weights, which has been expanded by the mutual volume

:&lt;math&gt; \frac { \text{density of object}} { \text{density of fluid} } = \frac { \text{weight}} { \text{weight of displaced fluid} }&lt;/math&gt;

yields the formula below. The density of the immersed object relative to the density of the fluid can easily be calculated without measuring any volume is

:&lt;math&gt; \frac { \text {density of object}} { \text{density of fluid} } = \frac { \text{weight}} { \text{weight} - \text{apparent immersed weight}}.\,&lt;/math&gt;

(This formula is used for example in describing the measuring principle of a [[dasymeter]] and of [[hydrostatic weighing]].)

Example: If you drop wood into water, buoyancy will keep it afloat.

Example: A helium balloon in a moving car. When increasing speed or driving in a curve, the air moves in the opposite direction to the car's acceleration. However, due to buoyancy, the balloon is pushed "out of the way" by the air, and will actually drift in the same direction as the car's acceleration.

When an object is immersed in a liquid, the liquid exerts an upward force, which is known as the buoyant force, that is proportional to the weight of the displaced liquid. The sum force acting on the object, then, is equal to the difference between the weight of the object ('down' force) and the weight of displaced liquid ('up' force). Equilibrium, or neutral buoyancy, is achieved when these two weights (and thus forces) are equal.

==Refinements==

Archimedes' principle does not consider the [[surface tension]] (capillarity) acting on the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.weizmann.ac.il/home/fnfal/papers/Natfloat.pdf |title=Floater clustering in a standing wave: Capillarity effects drive hydrophilic or hydrophobic particles to congregate at specific points on a wave | date=2005-06-23 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Archimedes' principle has been found to break down in [[complex fluid]]s.&lt;ref&gt;"Archimedes’s principle gets updated". R. Mark Wilson, ''Physics Today'' '''65'''(9), 15 (2012); {{doi|10.1063/PT.3.1701}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principle of flotation==
Archimedes' principle shows the  buoyant force and displacement of fluid. However, the concept of Archimedes' principle can be applied when considering why objects float. Proposition 5 of Archimedes' treatise ''[[On Floating Bodies]]'' states that:

{{Quotation|Any floating object displaces its own weight of fluid.| [[Archimedes]] of [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]]&lt;ref name=archimedes&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/worksofarchimede00arch#page/256/mode/2up|title=The works of Archimedes|page=257|accessdate=11 March 2010|quote=Any solid lighter than a fluid will, if placed in the fluid, be so far immersed that the weight of the solid will be equal to the weight of the fluid displaced. }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In other words, for an object floating on a liquid surface (like a boat) or floating submerged in a fluid (like a [[submarine]] in water or [[dirigible]] in air) the weight of the displaced liquid equals the weight of the object. Thus, only in the special case of floating does the buoyant force acting on an object equal the objects weight. Consider a 1-ton block of solid iron. As iron is nearly eight times as dense as water, it displaces only 1/8 ton of water when submerged, which is not enough to keep it afloat. Suppose the same iron block is reshaped into a bowl. It still weighs 1 ton, but when it is put in water, it displaces a greater volume of water than when it was a block. The deeper the iron bowl is immersed, the more water it displaces, and the greater the buoyant force acting on it. When the buoyant force equals 1 ton, it will sink no farther.

When any boat displaces a weight of water equal to its own weight, it floats. This is often called the "principle of flotation": A floating object displaces a weight of fluid equal to its own weight. Every ship, submarine, and dirigible must be designed to displace a weight of fluid at least equal to its own weight. A 10,000-ton ship's hull must be built wide enough, long enough and deep enough to displace 10,000 tons of water and still have some hull above the water to prevent it from sinking. It needs extra hull to fight waves that would otherwise fill it and, by increasing its mass, cause it to submerge. The same is true for vessels in air: a dirigible that weighs 100 tons needs to displace 100 tons of air. If it displaces more, it rises; if it displaces less, it falls. If the dirigible displaces exactly its weight, it hovers at a constant altitude.

While they are related to it, the principle of flotation and the concept that a submerged object displaces a volume of fluid equal to its own volume are ''not'' Archimedes' principle. Archimedes' principle, as stated above, equates the ''buoyant force'' to the weight of the fluid displaced.

One common point of confusion{{by whom|date=May 2018}} regarding Archimedes' principle is the meaning of displaced volume. Common demonstrations involve measuring the rise in water level when an object floats on the surface in order to calculate the displaced water. This measurement approach fails with a buoyant submerged object because the rise in the water level is directly related to the volume of the object and not the mass (except if the effective density of the object equals exactly the fluid density).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.khanacademy.org/science/physics/fluids/buoyant-force-and-archimedes-principle/a/buoyant-force-and-archimedes-principle-article&lt;/ref&gt;

Archimedes also used this principle to help [[Hiero II of Syracuse#As King of Syracuse|Hiero II]] with his problem with a golden crown.&lt;ref&gt;https://physics.weber.edu/carroll/Archimedes/crown.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;http://www.longlongtimeago.com/once-upon-a-time/great-discoveries/eureka-the-story-of-archimedes-and-the-golden-crown/&lt;/ref&gt;
(note that this idea is not Archimedes' principle).

The '''Asnæs Power Station''' ({{lang-da|Asnæsværket}}) is a coal-fired power plant operated by [[DONG Energy]] in [[Kalundborg]], [[Denmark]].  It consists of three active units, which deliver 147&amp;nbsp;MW (Unit 2), 270&amp;nbsp;MW (Unit 4) and 640&amp;nbsp;MW (Unit 5). Unit 3 went in service in 1959 and uses a {{convert|152.1|m|ft|adj=mid|-tall}} [[flue gas stack]], while Unit 5, which went into service in 1981, uses a {{convert|220.1|m|ft|adj=mid|-tall}} flue gas stack, the third tallest in Denmark. Its two 60m high coal cranes were dismantled in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dongenergy.com/en/media/newsroom/news/articles/giant-coal-cranes-to-be-decommissioned-at-asn%C3%A6s-power-station |title=Giant coal cranes to be decommissioned at Asnæs Power Station|publisher=[[DONG Energy]] |date=26 October 2016|accessdate=24 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aurantinidin''' is a water-soluble, red plant dye. It is a member of the class of compounds known as [[anthocyanidin]]s and is a [[Hydroxyl|hydroxy]] derivative of [[pelargonidin]]. Aurantinidin has been reported to occur in ''[[Impatiens aurantiaca]]'' ([[Balsaminaceae]]), and also in cultivars from genus ''[[Alstroemeria]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''FLAVONOIDS: Chemistry, biochemistry and applications'' by Oyvind M. Andersen and Kenneth R.Markham&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first reported [[metallic glass]] was an [[alloy]] (Au&lt;sub&gt;75&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;25&lt;/sub&gt;) produced at [[Caltech]] by W. Klement (Jr.), Willens and [[Pol Duwez|Duwez]] in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Non-crystalline structure in solidified gold-silicon Alloys|doi=10.1038/187869b0|journal=Nature|year=1960|pages=869–870|volume=187|last1=Klement|first1=W.|last2=Willens|first2=R. H.|last3=Duwez|first3=POL|issue=4740|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v187/n4740/abs/187869b0.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; This and other early glass-forming alloys had to be cooled extremely rapidly (in the order of one [[mega-]][[kelvin]] per second, 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;K/s) to avoid [[crystallization]]. An important consequence of this was that metallic glasses could only be produced in a limited number of forms (typically ribbons, foils, or wires) in which one or more dimensions were small so that heat could be extracted quickly enough to achieve the necessary cooling rates. As a result, metallic glass specimens (with a few exceptions) were limited to thicknesses of less than one hundred [[micrometre|micrometers]].

Mg-Zn-Ca based metallic glasses are a relatively new group of amorphous metals, possessing commercial and technical advantages over early compositions.  Gu and co-workers produced the first Mg-Zn-Ca BMG in 2005, reporting high glass forming ability, high strength and most importantly exceptional [[plasticity (physics)|plasticity]].  This [[lanthanide]]-free, Mg-based glass attracted immediate interest due to its low density and cost, and particularly because of its uncharacteristically high [[ductility]].  This property was unexpected for such compositions, as the constituent elements are found to be of relatively low [[Poisson ratio]], and hence contribute little to the inherent plasticity of the glass.  This unlikely asset was seized upon by Li in 2008, who made use of the Poisson ratio principle and increased Mg content at the expense of Zn to further enhance plasticity.  Further improvements were achieved by incremental addition of Ca to the Mg72Zn28 binary composition, producing numerous [[ternary alloy]]s along the 350&amp;nbsp;°C [[isothermal process|isotherm]] of the Mg-Zn-Ca system.

Ternary Ca-Mg-Zn bulk metallic glasses were also discovered in 2005.&lt;ref name="senkov"&gt;{{cite journal|title= Glass forming ability and thermal stability of ternary Ca-Mg-Zn bulk metallic glasses |journal= Journal of Non-Crystalline Solids |year=2005|pages=3087–3094|volume=351|issue=37-39|last1=Senkov|first1=O.N.|last2=Scott|first2=J.M.|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022309305005600|doi=10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2005.07.022}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to the Mg-Zn-Ca, these two [[amorphous alloy]]s are both bioresorbable metallic glasses and are based on the same ''Mg-Zn-Ca ternary system''.&lt;ref name="Google"/&gt; The elements are displayed in order of decreasing atomic concentration. Hence, the distinction between these two [[metallic glass]]es lies in their most dominant [[chemical element|element]], namely [[calcium|Ca]] and [[magnesium|Mg]]. These Ca-based bulk glassy alloys had compositions of Ca&lt;sub&gt;55&lt;/sub&gt;Mg&lt;sub&gt;15+X&lt;/sub&gt;Zn&lt;sub&gt;30−X&lt;/sub&gt;, Ca&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;Mg&lt;sub&gt;10+Y&lt;/sub&gt;Zn&lt;sub&gt;30−Y&lt;/sub&gt;, and Ca&lt;sub&gt;55+Z&lt;/sub&gt;Mg&lt;sub&gt;25−Z&lt;/sub&gt;Zn&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt;, where X = 0, 5 and 10; Y = 0, 5, 7.5, 10, and 15; and Z = 0, 5, 7.5, 10, and 15. Critical casting thicknesses of up to 10 [[Millimetre|mm]] were achieved.&lt;ref name="senkov"/&gt;

==Properties==
Unlike traditional steel or titanium, this material dissolves in organisms at a rate of roughly 1 millimeter per month and is replaced with [[bone tissue]]. This speed can be adjusted by varying the content of zinc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/40573|title=Fixing bones with dissolvable glass|date=Oct 1, 2009|publisher=PhysicsWorld}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amorphous Ca&lt;sub&gt;65&lt;/sub&gt;Zn&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt;Mg&lt;sub&gt;15&lt;/sub&gt; alloy exhibits extremely poor [[corrosion resistance]]. Wang ''et al.''&lt;ref name="wang"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wang|first=Y.B.|title=Biodegradable CaMgZn bulk metallic glass for potential skeletal application|journal=Acta Biomaterialia|year=2011|volume=7|pages=3196–3208|url= http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1742706111001929|doi=10.1016/j.actbio.2011.04.027|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; reported that the said amorphous alloy completely disintegrated after no more than 3 hours exposure in biocorrosion environment. In static distilled water at room temperature, Dahlman ''et al.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Corrosion properties of Ca based bulk metallic glasses |journal= Materials Transactions|year=2007|pages=1850–1854|volume=48|issue=7|last1=Dahlman|first1=J.|last2=Senkov|first2=O.N.|last3=Scott|first3=J.M.|last4=Miracle|first4=D.B.|url= https://www.jim.or.jp/journal/e/pdf3/48/07/1850.pdf|doi=10.2320/matertrans.mj200732}}&lt;/ref&gt; also reported destructive corrosion reactions of the same material, decomposing into a multiphase powder.

Ca-BMGs with higher [[zinc|Zn]] contents as reported by Cao ''et al.''&lt;ref name="cao"&gt;{{cite journal|title= Ca–Mg–Zn bulk metallic glasses as bioresorbable metals |journal= Acta Biomaterialia |year=2012|pages=2375–2383|volume=8|issue=6|last1=Cao|first1=J.D.|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1742706112000955|doi=10.1016/j.actbio.2012.03.009|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed an [[elastic modulus]] in the range of 35–46 [[GPa]], and a [[hardness]] of 0.7–1.4 [[GPa]].

==Recent developments==
[[Metallic glass]]es based on the Mg-Zn-Ca ternary alloy system only consist of the elements which already exist inside the human body. As such, it is being explored as a potential bioresorbable biomaterial for use in [[orthopaedic]] applications.&lt;ref name="wang"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cao"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mills|first=Georgie|title=Mending broken bones with glass|url=http://www.australiaunlimited.com/science/mending-broken-bones-glass|accessdate=22 April 2013|newspaper=Australia Unlimited}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.materials.unsw.edu.au/research/bulk-metallic-glasses-for-biomedical-electronics-aerospace-and-advanced-structural-applications|title=BMGs for Electronic, Biomedical and Aerospace Applications|date=Apr 28, 2010|publisher=University of New South Wales|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130105044106/http://www.materials.unsw.edu.au/research/bulk-metallic-glasses-for-biomedical-electronics-aerospace-and-advanced-structural-applications|archivedate=2013-01-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Magnesium biomaterials: Past, present and future |journal= Corrosion Engineering, Science and Technology|year=2012|pages=322–328|volume=47|issue=5|last1=Kirkland|first1=N.T.|url= http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/maney/cest/2012/00000047/00000005/art00002|doi=10.1179/1743278212Y.0000000034}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4805">'''Carbogen''', also called '''Meduna's Mixture''' after its inventor [[Ladislas J. Meduna|Ladislas Meduna]], is a mixture of [[carbon dioxide]] and [[oxygen]] gas.  Meduna's original formula was 5% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and 95% oxygen, but the term carbogen can refer to any mixture of these two gases, from 1.5%&lt;ref name="pubmed1"&gt;Prisman E, Slessarev M, Azami T, Nayot D, Milosevic M, and Fisher J. (2007). Modified oxygen mask to induce target levels of hyperoxia and hypercarbia during radiotherapy: a more effective alternative to carbogen.  ''International Journal of Radiation Biology''.  Jul;83(7):457-62.&lt;/ref&gt; to 50%&lt;ref name="erowid"&gt;[http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/carbogen/carbogen_basics.shtml Erowid Carbogen Vault: Basics&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;].&lt;/ref&gt; CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

== Mechanism ==
When carbogen is inhaled, the increased level of carbon dioxide causes a perception, both psychological and physiological, of [[suffocation]] because the brain interprets an increase in blood carbon dioxide as a decrease in oxygen level,&lt;ref name="Walsh_2005" /&gt; which would generally be the case under natural circumstances. Inhalation of carbogen causes the body to react as if it were not receiving sufficient oxygen: breathing quickens and deepens, [[heart rate]] increases, and cells release [[alkaline]] [[buffering agent]]s to remove [[carbonic acid]] from the bloodstream.

== Psychotherapy == 
Carbogen was once used in psychology and [[psychedelic psychotherapy]] to determine whether a patient would react to an [[altered state of consciousness]] or to a sensation of loss of control.&lt;ref name="Markoff_2005"&gt;{{cite book
  | last = Markoff

  | title = [[What the Dormouse Said]]
  | publisher = Penguin
  | date = 2005
  | pages =25, 62
  | isbn = 0-670-03382-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals who reacted especially negatively to carbogen were generally not administered other [[psychotherapeutic]] drugs for fear of similar reactions. Meduna administered carbogen to his patients to induce [[abreaction]], which, with proper preparation and administration, he found could help clients become free of their neuroses.  Carbogen users are said to have discovered unconscious contents of their minds, with the experience clearing away repressed material and freeing the subject for a smoother, more profound psychedelic experience.&lt;ref name="Walsh_2005"&gt;{{cite book

One subject reported: 
"After the second breath came an onrush of color, first a predominant sheet of beautiful rosy-red, following which came successive sheets of brilliant color and design, some geometric, some fanciful and graceful …. Then the colors separated; my soul drawing apart from the physical being, was drawn upward seemingly to leave the earth and to go upward where it reached a greater Spirit with Whom there was a communion, producing a remarkable, new relaxation and deep security."&lt;ref name="Meduna_1950"&gt;{{cite book
  | last = Meduna
  | first = Ladislas J.
  | title = Carbon Dioxide Therapy
  | publisher = Charles C. Thomas Publishing
  | date = 1950
  | pages =
  | isbn =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carbogen is rarely used in therapy anymore, largely due to the decline in [[psychedelic psychotherapy]].

== Uses ==

A carbogen mixture of 95% oxygen and 5% carbon dioxide can be used as part of the early treatment of [[central retinal artery occlusion]].

Carbogen is used in biology research to study ''in vivo'' oxygen and carbon dioxide flows,&lt;ref name="pubmed2"&gt;Arnold JF, Kotas M, Fidler F, Pracht ED, Flentje M, Jakob PM. (2007). Quantitative regional oxygen transfer imaging of the human lung. ''Journal of Magnetic Resonance Imaging''. Aug 8;26(3):637-645&lt;/ref&gt; as well as to oxygenate the [[artificial cerebrospinal fluid|aCSF]] solution and stabilize the pH to about 7.4 in research on acute brain slices.

Its use in combination with [[nicotinamide]] is also being investigated in conjunction with [[radiation therapy]] in the treatment strategy of certain cancers.&lt;ref name="dutchstudy"&gt;http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00147732&lt;/ref&gt; Because increased tumor oxygenation improves the cell-killing effects of radiation, it is thought that the inhalation of these agents during radiation therapy could increase its effectiveness.

'''Cerotic acid''', or ''hexacosanoic acid'', is a 26-[[carbon]] long-chain [[saturated fatty acid]] with the [[chemical formula]] CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt;COOH. It is most commonly found in [[beeswax]] and [[carnauba wax]], and is a white crystalline solid.

Cerotic acid is also a type of [[very long chain fatty acid]] that is often associated with the disease [[adrenoleukodystrophy]], which involves the excessive saturation of unmetabolized fatty acid chains, including cerotic acid, in the [[peroxisome]]. [In the chem box it is shown folded only because of lack of space.  In fact, it is a straight-chain, saturated fatty acid.]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6777">A '''chassis dynamometer''', sometimes called a rolling road&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tuningtools.co.uk/rolling-road-dyno-sales.html Rolling Road Dyno's] (en)&lt;/ref&gt;, is a device used for vehicle testing and development. It uses a roller assembly to simulate a road in a controlled environment, usually inside a building.
[[Image:4x4 Dynamometer.jpg|Chassis dynamometer 4x4|upright=1.3|thumb]]

== Chassis dynamometer types ==
There are many types of chassis dynamometer according to the target application - for example, emissions measurement, miles accumulation chassis dynamometer (MACD), Noise-Vibration-Harshness (NVH or "Acoustic") Application, Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) testing, end of line (EOL) tests, performance measurement and tuning. Another basic division is by type of vehicle - motorcycles, cars, trucks, tractors or the size of the roller - mostly 25", 48", 72", but also any other.&lt;ref&gt;Tobias Düser, Hans Olms, Anita Haase, Roland von Gavel, Christoph Schmidt, Uwe Schmidt, "Vehicle Chassis Dynamometer", ''Units under test'', (Süddeutscher Verlag onpact, Munich 2011) page 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Modern dynamometers used for development are mostly one roller to the wheel construction and the vehicle wheel is placed the top of the roller. Older constructional solutions are two roller per wheel and vehicle is place between these rollers - this design solution is cheaper and simpler, however, due to the requirements for accuracy and strict limits is no longer used for the development of new vehicles, but only as a test dynamometer at the end of the line or to measure the performance of the engine without dismantling,&lt;ref&gt;[http://utad.af.mendelu.cz/en/info/technika/auto Automotive Institute - Our Equipment - Chassis dynamometer for cars]&lt;/ref&gt; or performance tuning in "garage" companies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mnmotor.net/produkty-a-sluzby/item/113-v%C3%A1lcov%C3%BD-dynamometr-2wd Company which is doing mapping of ECU's and power measurement on 2WD chassis dynamometer]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Basic modes ==
[[Image:chassisdyno.jpg|thumb|[[Saab 96]] on mobile dynamometer]]
* ''Tractive force control/Force constant'' - in this mode the dynamometer holds set force regardless of speed or other parameters. The specified Force can be distributed evenly between the axles or in different amounts between different axes in the case of multiple axis chassis dynamometers.
* ''Speed control/Velocity constant'' - dynamometer holds the set speed regardless of force or other parameters. For example, if a vehicle tries to accelerate in this mode, dynamometer applies opposite force to maintain set constant speed. This mode is used for example in the static power measurement.
* ''Road load simulation'' - dynamometer simulates road according to set parameters (according to desired simulation parameters = F0, F1, F2 or ABC parameters, simulated inertia and gradient).

== Measured variables on a roller dynamometer ==
Directly measured variables are only force on the torque transducer (i.e. loadcell) and revolutions measured on the role encoder dynamometer. All other variables are calculated based on known design (i.e. roller radius and loadcell mounting).

=== Power measurement on Chassis dynamometer ===
Due to friction and mechanical losses in various parts of the power train, the measured power at the wheels by about 15 to 20 percent lower than the power measured directly at the output of engine crankshaft (measuring device with this purpose is called engine testbed).&lt;ref&gt;John Dinkel, "Chassis Dynamometer", ''Road and Track Illustrated Automotive Dictionary'', (Bentley Publishers, 2000) page 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Road load simulation principle on chassis dynamometer ==
Vehicle do not behave the same way on chassis dynamometer as on the road. For example, aerodynamic shape of the vehicle does not matter. Sum of all forces on the vehicle on a real road are simulated through tires on chassis dynamometer.
Increasing air drag with the speed on the road manifests as increasing braking force of the vehicle wheels. The aim is to make the vehicle on the dynamometer accelerate and decelerate the same way as on a real road.
First you need to know the parameters of the "behavior" of the vehicle on a real road.
In order to get "road parameters", vehicle must be driving on ideal flat road with no wind from any direction, gear set to neutral and time needed to slow down without braking is measured in certain intervals i.e. 100–90&amp;nbsp;km/h, 90–80&amp;nbsp;km/h, 80–70&amp;nbsp;km/h 70–60&amp;nbsp;km/h etc. Slowing down from higher speed takes shorter time mainly due to air resistance.
Those parameters are later set in dynamometer workstation, together with vehicle inertia. Vehicle is restrained and so called vehicle adaptation has to be performed.
During vehicle adaptation dynamometer automatically slowing down from set speed, changing its own "dyno parameters" and trying to get same deceleration in given intervals as on real road. Those parameters are then valid for this vehicle type. Changing of set simulated inertia it is possible to simulate vehicle ability to accelerate if fully loaded, with setting gradient it is possible to simulate force if vehicle going downhill etc. Chassis dynamometers for climatic chamber does exists, where it is possible to change temperature in give range i.e. -40 to +50&amp;nbsp;°C or altitude chamber where it is possible to check fuel consumption with different temperatures or pressure and to simulate driving on mountain roads.

'''Clipper Windpower''' is a [[wind turbine]] manufacturing company founded in 2001 by [[James G.P. Dehlsen]].&lt;ref name="clipaward"&gt;[http://www.nawindpower.com/e107_plugins/content/content.php?content.3260 "Clipper Chairman inducted into Environmental Hall of Fame"], ''North American Windpower'', 12 December 2008, Retrieved: 23 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; It designed one of the largest wind turbines in the United States, manufactured in [[Cedar Rapids, Iowa]]. It was working collaboratively with the [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]].

Affected by a global recession, in December 2010 Clipper Windpower was acquired by [[United Technologies Corporation]]. It was sold in 2012 to [[Platinum Equity]].&lt;ref name="pacbiztimes.com"&gt;[http://www.pacbiztimes.com/2012/11/16/clipper-chops-south-coast-jobs-operations/]&lt;/ref&gt; The company has reduced its manufacturing and is supporting its turbines.&lt;ref name="freeze"&gt;[http://thegazette.com/2012/11/03/customer-seeking-to-freeze-clipper-windpower-assets/], ''The Gazette,'' 3 November 2012  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105195013/http://thegazette.com/2012/11/03/customer-seeking-to-freeze-clipper-windpower-assets/ |date=November 5, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In September 2007 Clipper Windpower, based in [[Carpinteria, California]], received an Outstanding Research and Development Partnership Award from the [[U.S. Department of Energy]] (DOE) for the design and development of its 2.5 MW [[Liberty Wind Turbine]], one of the largest wind turbines manufactured in the U.S. at the time.  The turbine was developed under a partnership with DOE and its [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]] (NREL). It was manufactured in [[Cedar Rapids, Iowa]].

Commercial sales started in June 2006 for the new Liberty turbine and (mostly contingent) orders for more than 5,600 MW (2,240 units) for deliveries in 2007 through 2011 were booked.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20100526181823/http://www.industryweek.com/ReadArticle.aspx?ArticleID=14948&amp;SectionID=1 "Largest Wind Turbine Manufactured in U.S. Gets Energy Award"], ''Industry Week''&lt;/ref&gt;{{Update after|2014|11}} Clipper Windpower had an agreement with [[BP|BP Energy]] to supply the 2.5 MW turbines for the proposed 5,050 MW [[Titan Wind Project]] in South Dakota. Among the projects completed with Clipper wind turbines is [[Steel Winds]] in [[Lackawanna, New York]], south of Buffalo, where an urban wind farm was developed on part of a [[brownfield]].

Emerging companies such as Clipper were among those adversely affected by a global recession in 2008 and 2009.

===Acquisition by United Technologies===
On December 10, 2009, Connecticut-based [[United Technologies Corporation]] announced that it would acquire a 49.5% stake in Clipper Windpower by purchasing 84.3 million new shares and 21.8 million shares from current shareholders for £126.5 million. Clipper said this equity purchase "will significantly strengthen its balance sheet and enable it to enhance its operations and pursue its strategic initiatives".&lt;ref&gt;[http://money.cnn.com/news/newsfeeds/articles/djf500/200912100236DOWJONESDJONLINE000351_FORTUNE5.htm "Clipper Windpower Gets GBP126.5 Million Investment From United Tech"]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, CNN&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE5B91ES20091210 "Clipper says UTC to buy 49.5 percent stake"], Reuters&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/dec/10/clipper-windpower-united-technology-britannia-turbine "United Technology flies to the rescue of Clipper Windpower"]  ''The Guardian'', 10 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 October 2010, UTC agreed with Clipper to acquire the rest of the company,&lt;ref name="utclip"&gt;[http://www.nawindpower.com/e107_plugins/content/content.php?content.6721 UTC to acquire remaining interest in Clipper Windpower] ''North American Windpower'', 18 October 2010. Retrieved: 23 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; a transaction that was completed in December 2010 for a total cost of approximately $385 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=United Technologies Corporation Annual Report |year=2010 |pages=28–29, 61 |url=http://www.utc.com/StaticFiles/UTC/AnnualReports/2010/pdfs/UT_2010_Full-Report.pdf |accessdate=May 12, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726183910/http://www.utc.com/StaticFiles/UTC/AnnualReports/2010/pdfs/UT_2010_Full-Report.pdf |archive-date=July 26, 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 15, 2012, United Technologies announced their intent to sell Clipper Windpower.  CFO Greg Hayes described their 2010 acquisition as a "mistake".&lt;ref name="pacbiztimes.com"/&gt;  United Technologies' sudden about-face is attributed to the fact that the windpower manufacturing company does not fit into their new aerospace-mostly business model.

[[File:Oaxaca I Lamatalaventosa Wind Farm.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Clipper WindPower turbines installed at the Oaxaca I Lamatalaventosa Wind Farm in Mexico.]]
In April 2008 Clipper Windpower announced plans to develop a large&lt;!--others develop 10MW--&gt; wind energy turbine in [[Blyth, Northumberland|Blyth]], [[Northumberland]] in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.windfair.net/press/4254.html World’s largest offshore wind energy turbine to be developed in North England] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515063606/http://www.windfair.net/press/4254.html |date=May 15, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For use offshore, each turbine was designed to be rated at around 7.5 MW and would be roughly double the size of the largest turbines used in commercial offshore wind farms at that time ([[Siemens]] 3.6 MW turbine).&lt;ref name="ewea09"&gt;Wilkes, Justin.

Clipper Windpower Marine had started construction of a {{convert|4000|sqm}} offshore wind turbine blade manufacturing facility in Neptune Estate, Tyne in 2010. The factory would have been used to develop and build blades for the Britannia project, a 10&amp;nbsp;MW offshore wind turbine prototype under development by Clipper and scheduled for deployment in late 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/energy-and-clean-tech/2010/02/offshore-wind-turbine-clipper|title=Clipper to construct wind turbine factory|publisher=New Statesman|accessdate=22 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Clipper stopped development of the 10&amp;nbsp;MW in August 2011 after parent United Technologies deemed the financial crisis as too severe, and has paid £1.6&amp;nbsp;million of aid back to [[The Crown Estate]].&lt;ref name="no10"&gt;Andersen, Flemming Thestrup.

A '''coil spring''', also known as a ''helical spring'', is a mechanical device which is typically used to store energy and subsequently release it, to absorb shock, or to maintain a force between contacting surfaces.  They are made of an [[Elasticity (physics)|elastic]] material formed into the shape of a [[helix]] which returns to its natural length when unloaded.

Under tension or compression, the material (wire) of a coil spring undergoes torsion.  The spring characteristics therefore depend on the [[shear modulus]], not [[Young's Modulus]].

A coil spring may also be used as a [[torsion spring]]: in this case the spring as a whole is subjected to torsion about its helical axis.  The material of the [[Spring (device)|spring]] is thereby subjected to a [[bending moment]], either reducing or increasing the helical radius.  In this mode, it is the [[Young's Modulus]] of the material that determines the spring characteristics.

Metal coil springs are made by winding a wire around a shaped former - a cylinder is used to form cylindrical coil springs.

Coil springs for vehicles are typically made of hardened steel. A machine called an auto-coiler takes spring wire that has been heated so it can easily be shaped. It is then fed onto a lathe that has a metal rod with the desired coil spring size. The machine takes the wire and guides it onto the spinning rod as well as pushing it across the rod to form multiple coils. The spring is then ejected from the machine and an operator will put it in oil to cool off. The spring is then tempered to lose the brittleness from being cooled. The coil size and strength can be controlled by the lathe rod size and material used. Different alloys are used to get certain characteristic’s out of the spring, such as stiffness, dampening and strength &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How Springs Are Made|url=https://www.thomasnet.com/articles/machinery-tools-supplies/how-are-springs-made|website=Thomas|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Spring Rate ==

Spring rate is the measurement of how much a coil spring can hold until it compresses 1 inch. The spring rate is normally specified by the manufacture. If a Spring has a rate of 100 then the spring would compress 1 inch with 100lbs of load. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Street Performance &amp; Racing Spring Rate Tech|url=https://www.qa1.net/technical-support/street-performance-racing-spring-rate-tech|website=QA1|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Variants ==

Types of coil spring are:

* Tension/extension coil springs, designed to resist stretching.  They usually have a hook or eye form at each end for attachment.
* Compression coil springs, designed to resist being compressed.  A typical use for compression coil springs is in [[car]] [[Suspension (vehicle)|suspension systems]].
** [[Volute spring]]s are used as heavy load compression springs. A strip of plate is rolled into the shape of both a helix and a spiral. When compressed, the strip is stiffer edge-on than a wire coil, but the spiral arrangement allows the turns to overlap rather than bottoming out on each other.
* Torsion springs, designed to resist twisting actions. Often associated to clothes pegs or up-and-over garage doors.

== Applications ==
Coil springs have many applications; notable ones include:
* [[Buckling spring]]s in [[computer keyboard]]s
* [[Mattress coil]]s in [[innerspring mattress]]es
* [[Upholstery coil springs]] in [[upholstery]]
*'''Coil Springs in Car Suspension'''
:: Coil springs are commonly used in vehicle suspension. These springs are compression springs and can differ greatly in strength and in size depending on application. A coil spring suspension can be stiff to soft depending on the vehicle its used on. Coil spring can be either mounted with a shock absorber or mounted separately. Coil springs in trucks allow them to ride smoothly when unloaded and once loaded the spring compresses and becomes stiff. This allows the vehicle to bounce less when loaded. Coil spring suspension is also used high performance cars so that the car can absorb bumps and have low body roll. In off-road vehicles they are used because of their range of travel they allow at the wheel. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1= Zahl |first1= Timothy |title= Coil, Leaf, &amp; Torsion Bar {{!}} Describing The 3 Different Kinds of Springs |url= https://www.carid.com/articles/coil-leaf-and-torsion-bar-describing-the-3-different-kinds-of-springs.html|website=Carid|accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

*'''Coil Springs in the engine''' 
:: Coil springs are used in the engine. These springs are compression springs and play an important role in lifting the valves that feed air and let exhaust gasses out of the combustion chamber. The spring is attached to a rocker that is connected to the valve.

Tension and extension coil springs of a given material, wire diameter and coil diameter exert the same force when fully loaded; increased number of coils merely (linearly) increases free length and compressed/extended length.

A '''condensate pump''' is a specific type of [[pump]] used to pump the [[Condensation|condensate]] ([[water]]) produced in an [[HVAC]] (heating or cooling), [[refrigeration]], [[condensing boiler]] furnace, or [[steam]] system. 

==Applications==
Condensate pumps may be used to pump the condensate produced from latent [[water vapor]] in any of the following gas mixtures:

* Conditioned (cooled or heated) building air
* Refrigerated air in cooling and freezing systems
* Steam in heat exchangers and radiators
* The exhaust stream of very-high-efficiency [[furnace]]s

Condensate recovery systems help reduce three tangible costs of producing steam: 

* Fuel/energy costs 
* Boiler water make-up and sewage treatment 
* Boiler water chemical treatment 

== Construction and operation ==
Condensate pumps as used in [[hydronic]] systems are usually electrically powered [[Pump#Rotary dynamic (centrifugal) pump|centrifugal pump]]s. As used in homes and individual heat exchangers, they are often small and rated at a fraction of a [[horsepower]], but in commercial applications they range in size up to many horsepower and the [[electric motor]] is usually separated from the pump body by some form of mechanical coupling. Large industrial pumps may also serve as the [[Boiler feedwater pump|feedwater pump]] for returning the condensate under pressure to a boiler.

Condensate pumps usually run intermittently and have a tank in which condensate can accumulate. Eventually, the accumulating liquid raises a [[float switch]] energizing the pump. The pump then runs until the level of liquid in the tank is substantially lowered. Some pumps contain a two-stage switch. As liquid rises to the trigger point of the first stage, the pump is activated. If the liquid continues to rise (perhaps because the pump has failed or its discharge is blocked), the second stage will be triggered. This stage may switch off the HVAC equipment (preventing the production of further condensate), trigger an alarm, or both.

Some systems may include two pumps to service the tank.  In this case, the two pumps often alternate operation, and a two-stage switch serves to energize the on-duty pump at the first stage and then energize the remaining pump at the second stage.  This second stage action is in addition to any triggering of other system changes as noted for a single pump installation.  In this way pump runtime is shared between the two, and a backup pump is provided in case one pump fails to function as designed.

Small pumps have tanks that range from 2 to 4 liters (0.5 to 1 gallon) and are usually supported using the flanges on their tanks or simply placed upon the floor. A plastic impeller in a molded [[volute (pump)|volute]] at the bottom of the pump provides the pumping action; this impeller is connected to the motor via a metal shaft that extends downwards from the motor mounted above the tank's top. Large pumps are usually pad-mounted drawing liquid from a tank (sump) below the floor. The smallest pumps may have no tank at all and are simply placed within a container such as the drip pan of a [[dehumidifier]] appliance.

==Steam condensate==
[[File:Condensate return pump.jpg|thumb|upright|Condensate return pump]]
In industrial steam systems the condensate pump is used to collect and return condensate from remote areas of the plant.  The steam produced in the boiler can heat equipment and processes a considerable distance away.  Once steam is used it turns to hot water or condensate. This pump and possibly many more around the plant returns this hot water back to a '''make-up tank''' closer to the boiler, where it can be reclaimed, chemically treated, and reused, in the boiler, consequently it can sometimes be referred to as a '''condensate return pump'''.

In a steam power plant, particularly shipboard ones, the condensate pump is normally located adjacent to the main condenser hotwell often directly below it.  This pump sends the water to a '''make-up tank''' closer to the steam generator or boiler.  If the tank is also designed to remove [[dissolved oxygen]] from the condensate, it is known as a [[deaereating feed tank]] (DFT).  The output of the DFT supplies the feed booster pump which, in turn, supplies the [[feedwater pump]] which returns the feedwater to the boiler so the cycle can start over.  Two pumps in succession are used to provide sufficient net positive [[suction head]] to prevent [[cavitation]] and the subsequent damage associated with it.

This pump is usually associated with a much larger tank, float switch, and an electric motor than the example above.  Some systems are so remote that steam power is used to return the condensate where electricity is impractical to provide.

==Disposal==
The output of small condensate pumps is usually routed to a [[sanitary sewer|sewer]], plumbing drain, or the outside world via [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVCl]] [[plastic]] tubing (condensate drain line).

If the outlet of the line is at a higher level than the tank of the pump, a [[check valve]] is often fitted at the outlet of the pump so that liquid cannot flow backwards into the pump's tank. If the outlet is below the tank level, [[siphon]]age usually naturally clears the output line of all liquid when the pump is deenergized. In cold regions of the world, it is important that condensate lines that are exhausted outside be carefully designed so that no water can remain in the line to [[Freezing|freeze up]]; this would block the line from further operation.

Condensate is not pure water. If it is being condensed from an air stream, it may have [[dust]], [[microbe]]s, or other contaminants in it. If it is condensed from steam, it may have traces of the various boiler water treatment chemicals. And if it is condensed from furnace [[exhaust gas]]es, it may be [[acid]]ic, containing [[sulfuric acid]] or [[nitric acid]] as a result of [[Sulfur dioxide|sulfur]] and [[nitrogen dioxide]]s in the exhaust gas stream. Steam and exhaust condensate is usually hot. These various factors may combine (along with local regulations) to require careful handling or even chemical treatment of the condensate, and condensate pumps used for these services must be appropriately designed.

'''Copper(II) sulfate''', also known as '''cupric sulfate''', or '''copper sulphate''', is the [[inorganic compound]] with the [[chemical formula]] [[Copper|Cu]][[Sulfate|SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]](H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, where x can range from 0 to 5.  The pentahydrate (x = 5) is the most common form.  Older names for this compound include '''blue vitriol''', '''bluestone''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher = [[Oxford University]]|title = Copper (II) sulfate MSDS|url = http://ptcl.chem.ox.ac.uk/MSDS/CO/copper_II_sulfate.html|accessdate = 2007-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''vitriol of copper''',&lt;ref name=fou&gt;Antoine-François de Fourcroy, tr. by Robert Heron (1796) "Elements of Chemistry, and Natural History: To which is Prefixed the Philosophy of Chemistry".

==Preparation and occurrence==
[[File:Synthesizing Copper Sulfate.jpg|left|thumb|210px|Preparation of copper(II) sulfate by electrolyzing sulfuric acid, using copper electrodes]]
Copper sulfate is produced industrially by treating copper metal with hot concentrated [[sulfuric acid]] or its oxides with dilute sulfuric acid. For laboratory use, copper sulfate is usually purchased. Copper sulfate can also be produced by slowly leaching low grade copper ore in air; bacteria may be used to hasten the process.&lt;ref name="copper.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=Uses of Copper Compounds: Copper Sulphate|url=http://www.copper.org/resources/properties/compounds/copper_sulfate01.html|website=copper.org|publisher=Copper Development Association Inc.|accessdate=10 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commercial copper sulfate is usually about 98% pure copper sulfate, and may contain traces of water. Anhydrous Copper sulfate is 39.81 percent copper and 60.19 percent sulfate by mass, and in its blue, hydrous form, it is 25.47% copper, 38.47% sulfate (12.82% sulfur) and 36.06% water by mass. Four types of crystal size are provided based on its usage: large crystals (10–40&amp;nbsp;mm), small crystals (2–10&amp;nbsp;mm), snow crystals (less than 2&amp;nbsp;mm), and windswept powder (less than 0.15&amp;nbsp;mm).&lt;ref name="copper.org"/&gt;

Copper sulfate reacts with concentrated hydrochloric acid to give tetrachlorocuprate(II):
:Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; + 4&amp;nbsp;Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → {{chem|CuCl|4|2-}}

===Chemistry education===
Copper sulfate is commonly included in children's [[chemistry set]]s. It is often used to grow crystals in [[school]]s and in [[copper plating]] experiments, despite its toxicity. Copper sulfate is often used to demonstrate an [[exothermic reaction]], in which [[steel wool]] or [[magnesium]] ribbon is placed in an [[aqueous solution]] of CuSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. It is used to demonstrate the principle of [[mineral hydration]]. The [[pentahydrate]] form, which is blue, is heated, turning the copper sulfate into the anhydrous form which is white, while the water that was present in the pentahydrate form evaporates. When water is then added to the anhydrous compound, it turns back into the pentahydrate form, regaining its blue color, and is known as blue vitriol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2009-07-07|url=http://www.freepatentsonline.com/4315915.html|title=Process for the preparation of stable copper(II) sulfate monohydrate applicable as trace element additive in animal fodders}}&lt;/ref&gt; Copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate can easily be produced by crystallization from solution as copper(II) sulfate is quite [[hygroscopic]].

In an illustration of a "single metal replacement reaction", iron is submerged in a solution of copper sulfate. Iron reacts producing [[iron(II) sulfate]] and copper precipitates.

In high school and general chemistry education, copper sulfate is used as electrolyte for galvanic cells, usually as a cathode solution. For example, in a zinc/copper cell, copper ion in copper sulfate solution absorbs electron from zinc and forms metallic copper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zumdahl|first1=Steven|last2=DeCoste|first2=Donald|title=Chemical Principles|date=2013|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-1-285-13370-6|pages=506–507}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==

===As a fungicide and herbicide===
Copper sulfate pentahydrate is used as a [[fungicide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Johnson |first=George Fiske|title = The Early History of Copper Fungicides|journal = Agricultural History|volume = 9|issue = 2|pages = 67–79|year = 1935|jstor = 3739659}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some fungi are capable of adapting to elevated levels of copper ions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Parry|first1 = K.

[[Bordeaux mixture]],
a suspension of copper(II) sulfate (CuSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[calcium hydroxide]] (Ca(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), is used to control fungus on [[grape]]s, [[melon]]s, and other [[Berry|berries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Uses of Copper Compounds: Copper Sulfate's Role in Agriculture|publisher = Copper.org|accessdate = 2007-12-31|url = http://www.copper.org/applications/compounds/copper_sulfate02.html|doi=10.1111/j.1744-7348.1933.tb07770.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is produced by mixing a water solution of copper sulfate and a suspension of [[slaked lime]], a suspension of [[copper(II) hydroxide]] Cu(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and [[calcium sulfate]], which is used to control fungus on [[grape]]s, [[melon]]s, and other [[Berry|berries]].

''Cheshunt compound'', a commercial mixture of copper sulfate and [[ammonium carbonate]] (discontinued), is used in [[horticulture]] to prevent [[damping off]] in seedlings.&lt;ref&gt;Coutts, J, Edwards, A, Osborn, A, &amp; Preston, GH, ''The Complete Book of Gardening'', p. 533, Ward Lock, London (1954)&lt;/ref&gt; As a non-agricultural [[herbicide]], is it used to control invasive [[aquatic plants]] and the roots of plants situated near water pipes. It is used in [[swimming pool]]s as an algicide. 
A dilute solution of copper sulfate is used to treat [[aquarium]] fishes for parasitic infections,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = All About Copper Sulfate|publisher = National Fish Pharmaceuticals|url = http://www.nationalfishpharm.com/Q&amp;A/all_about_copper.html|accessdate = 2007-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is also used to remove snails from aquariums. Copper ions are highly toxic to fish, however. Most species of algae can be controlled with very low concentrations of copper sulfate.

===Analytical reagent===
Several chemical tests utilize copper sulfate. It is used in [[Fehling's solution]] and [[Benedict's solution]] to test for [[reducing sugar]]s, which reduce the soluble blue copper(II) sulfate to insoluble red [[copper(I) oxide]]. Copper(II) sulfate is also used in the [[Biuret reagent]] to test for proteins.

Copper sulfate is used to test blood for [[anemia]]. The blood is tested by dropping it into a solution of copper sulfate of known [[specific gravity]]&amp;nbsp;– blood which contains sufficient [[hemoglobin]] sinks rapidly due to its density, whereas blood which does not sink or sinks slowly has insufficient amount of [[hemoglobin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Basic Medical Laboratory Techniques|first= Barbara H. |last=Estridge |author2=Anna P.

===Niche uses===
Copper(II) sulfate has attracted many niche applications over the centuries. In industry copper sulfate has multiple applications. In printing it is an additive to book binding pastes and glues to protect paper from insect bites; in building it is used as an additive to concrete to provide water resistance and disinfectant qualities. Copper sulfate can be used as a coloring ingredient in artworks, especially glasses and potteries.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Copper Development Association|title=Uses of Copper Compounds: Table A - Uses of Copper Sulphate|url=http://www.copper.org/resources/properties/compounds/table_a.html|website=copper|publisher=Copper Development Association Inc.|accessdate=12 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Copper sulfate is also used in firework manufacture as a blue coloring agent, but it is not safe to mix copper sulfate with chlorates when mixing firework powders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Partin |first1=Lee |title=The Blues: Part 2 |url=http://www.skylighter.com/fireworks/how-to-make/blue-copper-fireworks-stars.asp |website=skylighter |publisher=Skylighter.Inc |accessdate=12 May 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101221162804/http://www.skylighter.com/fireworks/how-to-make/blue-copper-fireworks-stars.asp |archivedate=21 December 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Art====
In 2008, the artist [[Roger Hiorns]] filled an abandoned waterproofed [[council flat]] in London with 75,000 liters of copper sulfate solution. The solution was left to crystallize for several weeks before the flat was drained, leaving [[crystal]]-covered walls, floors and ceilings. The work is titled ''Seizure''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artangel.org.uk/projects/2008/seizure |title=Seizure homepage |publisher=Artangel.org.uk |accessdate=2009-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2011, it has been on exhibition at the [[Yorkshire Sculpture Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ysp.co.uk/exhibitions/roger-hiorns-seizure|title=Roger Hiorns: Seizure|publisher=Yorkshire Sculpture Park|accessdate=2015-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dyeing====
Copper sulfate can be used as a [[mordant]] in vegetable [[dyeing]]. It often highlights the green tints of the specific dyes.

==Medical and public health issues==
Copper sulfate was used in the past as an [[emetic]].&lt;ref name="pmid4385403"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Holtzmann |first=N. A. |last2=Haslam |first2=R. H. |title=Elevation of serum copper following copper sulfate as an emetic |journal=Pediatrics |volume=42 |issue=1 |pages=189–93 |date=July 1968 |pmid=4385403 |url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/abstract/42/1/189}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now considered too toxic for this use.&lt;ref name="isbn0-8385-8172-2"&gt;{{cite book |last=Olson |first=Kent C. |title=Poisoning &amp; drug overdose |publisher=Lange Medical Mooks/McGraw-Hill |location=New York |year=2004 |page=175 |isbn=0-8385-8172-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is still listed as an [[antidote]] in the [[World Health Organization]]'s [[Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ATC|V03|AB20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other form of copper sulfates==
Anhydrous copper(II) sulfate is a white solid.  It can be produced by dehydration of the normally available pentahydrate copper sulfate.  In nature, it found as the very rare mineral known as [[chalcocyanite]]. The pentahydrate also occurs in nature as [[chalcanthite]].  Two other copper sulfates comprise the remaining of these rare minerals: bonattite (trihydrate) and boothite (heptahydrate).

== Toxicological effects ==
Copper sulfate is an irritant.&lt;ref&gt;Windholz, M., ed. 1983. ''The Merck Index''. Tenth edition. Rahway, NJ: Merck and Company.&lt;/ref&gt; The usual routes by which humans can receive toxic exposure to copper sulfate are through eye or skin contact, as well as by inhaling powders and dusts.&lt;ref name="EPA-Guidance"&gt;{{citation |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Pesticide Programs |year=1986 |title=Guidance for reregistration of pesticide products containing copper sulfate. Fact sheet no. 100. |location=Washington, DC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Skin contact may result in itching or [[eczema]].&lt;ref&gt;TOXNET. 1975–1986. National library of medicine's toxicology data network. Hazardous Substances Data Bank (HSDB). Public Health Service. National Institute of Health, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Bethesda, MD: NLM.&lt;/ref&gt; Eye contact with copper sulfate can cause [[conjunctivitis]], [[inflammation]] of the eyelid lining, [[Corneal ulcer|ulceration]], and clouding of the [[cornea]].&lt;ref name="Clayton, G. D 1981"&gt;Clayton, G. D. and F. E. Clayton, eds. 1981. ''Patty's industrial hygiene and toxicology''. Third edition. Vol. 2, Part 6 ''Toxicology''. NY: John Wiley and Sons. {{ISBN|0-471-01280-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon oral exposure, copper sulfate is moderately toxic.&lt;ref name="EPA-Guidance"/&gt; According to studies, the lowest dose of copper sulfate that had a toxic effect on humans is 11&amp;nbsp;mg/kg.&lt;ref&gt;National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). 1981–1986. Registry of toxic effects of chemical substances (RTECS). Cincinnati, OH: NIOSH.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of its irritating effect on the [[gastrointestinal tract]], vomiting is automatically initiated in case of the ingestion of copper sulfate. However, if copper sulfate is retained in the stomach, the symptoms can be severe. After 1–12&amp;nbsp;grams of copper sulfate are swallowed, such poisoning signs may occur as a metallic taste in the mouth, burning pain in the chest, [[nausea]], [[diarrhea]], vomiting, headache, discontinued urination, which leads to yellowing of the skin. In cases of copper sulfate poisoning, injury to the brain, stomach, liver, or kidneys may also occur.&lt;ref name="Clayton, G. D 1981"/&gt;

===Environmental toxicity===
Copper sulfate is highly soluble in water and therefore is easy to distribute in the environment. Copper in the soil may be from industry, motor vehicle, and architectural materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=United State Environment Protection Agency|title=Reregistration Eligibility Decision (RED) for Coppers|url=http://www.epa.gov/oppsrrd1/reregistration/REDs/copper_red_amend.pdf|website=www.epa.org|publisher=United State Environment Protection Agency|accessdate=12 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to studies,{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} copper sulfate exists mainly in the surface soil and tends to bind organic matter. The more acidic the soil is, the less binding occurs.

[[File:Earth poster.svg|thumb|350px|The internal structure of Earth]]
In [[geology]], the '''crust''' is the outermost solid shell of a [[terrestrial planet|rocky]] [[planet]], [[dwarf planet]], or [[natural satellite]]. It is usually distinguished from the underlying [[mantle (geology)|mantle]] by its chemical makeup; however, in the case of icy satellites, it may be distinguished based on its phase (solid crust vs. liquid mantle).

The crusts of [[Earth (planet)|Earth]], [[Moon]], [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Venus]], [[Mars]], [[Io (moon)|Io]], and other planetary bodies formed via [[igneous]] processes, and were later modified by [[erosion]], [[impact crater]]ing, volcanism, and sedimentation.

Most terrestrial planets have fairly uniform crusts. Earth, however, has two distinct types: [[continental crust]] and [[oceanic crust]]. These two types have different chemical compositions and physical properties, and were formed by different geological processes.

== Types of crust ==
Planetary geologists divide crust into three categories, based on how and when they formed.&lt;ref name="Hargitai 2014 1–8"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Planetary Landforms|last=Hargitai|first=Henrik|date=2014|publisher=Springer New York|isbn=9781461492139|pages=1–8|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-1-4614-9213-9_90-1|chapter = Crust (Type)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Primary crust / primordial crust ===
This is a planet's "original" crust. It forms from solidification of a magma ocean. Toward the end of [[Formation and evolution of the Solar System|planetary accretion]], the terrestrial planets likely had surfaces that were magma oceans. As these cooled, they solidified into crust.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chambers|first=John E.|title=Planetary accretion in the inner Solar System|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0012821X04002791|journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters|volume=223|issue=3–4|pages=241–252|doi=10.1016/j.epsl.2004.04.031|bibcode=2004E&amp;PSL.223..241C|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This crust was likely destroyed by large impacts and re-formed many times as the [[Formation and evolution of the Solar System|Era of Heavy Bombardment]] drew to a close.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Taylor|first=Stuart Ross|title=Growth of planetary crusts|journal=Tectonophysics|volume=161|issue=3–4|pages=147–156|doi=10.1016/0040-1951(89)90151-0|bibcode=1989Tectp.161..147T|year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The nature of primary crust is still debated: its chemical, mineralogic, and physical properties are unknown, as are the igneous mechanisms that formed them. This is because it is difficult to study: none of Earth's primary crust has survived to today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Earth's oldest rocks|date=2007|publisher=Elsevier|others=Van Kranendonk, Martin., Smithies, R. H., Bennett, Vickie C.|isbn=9780080552477|edition=1st|location=Amsterdam|oclc=228148014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earth's high rates of erosion and crustal recycling from plate tectonics has destroyed [[Oldest dated rocks|all rocks older than about 4 billion years]], including whatever primary crust Earth once had. 

However, geologists can glean information about primary crust by studying it on other terrestrial planets. Mercury's highlands might represent primary crust, though this is debated.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Planetary crusts : their composition, origin and evolution|last=1925–|first=Taylor, Stuart Ross|date=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|others=McLennan, Scott M.|isbn=978-0521841863|location=Cambridge, UK|oclc=666900567}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[anorthosite]] [[Geology of the Moon|highlands]] of the Moon are primary crust, formed as [[plagioclase]] crystallized out of the Moon's initial magma ocean and floated to the top;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Taylor|first=G.

W. (Stephen Wesley), 1955–, Hunten, Donald M., Phillips, R. J. (Roger J.), 1940–|isbn=9780816518302|location=Tucson, Ariz.|oclc=37315367}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Secondary crust ===
Secondary crust is formed by [[partial melting]] of silicate materials in the mantle, and so is usually basaltic in composition.&lt;ref name="Hargitai 2014 1–8"/&gt;

This is the most common type of crust in the Solar System. Most of the surfaces of Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars comprise secondary crust, as do the [[Lunar mare|lunar maria]]. On Earth, we see secondary crust forming primarily at [[Mid-ocean ridge|mid-ocean spreading centers]], where the [[Adiabatic process|adiabatic]] rise of mantle causes partial melting. 

=== Tertiary crust ===
Tertiary crust is more chemically-modified than either primary or secondary. It can form in several ways:
* Igneous processes: partial-melting of secondary crust, coupled with differentiation or dehydration&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Erosion and sedimentation: sediments derived from primary, secondary, or tertiary crust
The only known example of tertiary crust is the continental crust of the Earth. It is unknown whether other terrestrial planets can be said to have tertiary crust, though the evidence so far suggests that they do not. This is likely because plate tectonics is needed to create tertiary crust, and Earth is the only planet in our Solar System with plate tectonics. 

==Earth's crust==

=== Structure ===
[[Image:Plates tect2 en.svg|thumb|350px|Plates in the crust of Earth]]
The crust is a thin shell on the outside of the Earth, accounting for less than 1% of Earth's volume. It is the top component of [[lithosphere]]: a division of Earth's layers that includes the crust and the upper part of the [[mantle (geology)|mantle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/interior/|title=The Interior of the Earth|last1=Robinson|first1=Eugene C.|date=January 14, 2011|publisher=[[U.S. Geological Survey]]|accessdate=August 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lithosphere is broken into tectonic plates that move, allowing heat to escape from the interior of the Earth into space. 

The crust lies on top of the [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]], a configuration that is stable because the upper mantle is made of [[peridotite]] and so is significantly denser than the crust. The boundary between the crust and mantle is conventionally placed at the [[Mohorovičić discontinuity]], a boundary defined by a contrast in [[seismic]] velocity. 
{{World geologic provinces}}

The crust of the Earth is of two distinctive types: 
# [[oceanic crust|Oceanic]]: {{convert|5|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} to {{convert|10|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} thick&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eoearth.org/article/Structure_of_the_Earth Structure of the Earth].  The Encyclopedia of Earth. March 3, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and composed primarily of denser, more [[mafic]] rocks, such as [[basalt]], [[diabase]], and [[gabbro]].
# [[continental crust|Continental]]: {{convert|30|km|mi|-1|abbr=on}} to {{convert|50|km|mi|-1|abbr=on}} thick and mostly composed of less dense, more [[felsic]] rocks, such as [[granite]].
Because both continental and oceanic crust are less dense than the mantle below, both types of crust [[isostasy|"float" on the mantle]]. This is isostasy, and it's also one of the reasons continental crust is higher than oceanic: continental is less dense and so "floats" higher. As a result, water pools in above the oceanic crust, forming the oceans. 

The temperature of the crust increases with depth,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Boring |volume=4 |page=251 |first=Robert |last=Peele}}&lt;/ref&gt; reaching values typically in the range from about {{convert|200|°C|°F}} to {{convert|400|°C|°F}} at the boundary with the underlying mantle. The temperature increases by as much as {{convert|30|C-change}} for every kilometer locally in the upper part of the crust, but the [[geothermal gradient]] is smaller in deeper crust.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.channel4.com/science/microsites/S/science/nature/journey.html Earth].

These have been depleted by being relocated deeper into Earth's core. Their abundance in [[meteoroid]] materials is higher. Additionally, tellurium and selenium have been depleted from the crust due to formation of volatile hydrides.]]

The continental crust has an average composition similar to that of [[andesite]].&lt;ref&gt;R. L. Rudnick and S. Gao, 2003, Composition of the Continental Crust. In The Crust (ed. R. L.

=== Formation and evolution ===
{{Main|Formation of the Earth}}
Earth formed approximately 4.6 billion years ago from a disk of dust and gas orbiting the newly formed Sun. It formed via accretion, where planetesimals and other smaller rocky bodies collided and stuck, gradually growing into a planet. This process generated an enormous amount of heat, which caused early Earth to melt completely. As planetary accretion slowed, Earth began to cool, forming its first crust, called a primary or primordial crust.&lt;ref name="uopp"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=EIrwxgpc9GsC|title=Historical Geology: Understanding Our Planet's Past|last=Erickson|first=Jon|publisher=[[Infobase Publishing]]|year=2014|isbn=978-1438109640|page=8|accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This crust was likely repeatedly destroyed by large impacts, then reformed from the magma ocean left by the impact. None of Earth's primary crust has survived to today; all was destroyed by erosion, impacts, and plate tectonics over the past several billion years. 

Since then, Earth has been forming secondary and tertiary crust. Secondary crust forms at mid-ocean spreading centers, where partial-melting of the underlying mantle yields basaltic magmas and new ocean crust forms. This "ridge push" is one of the driving forces of plate tectonics, and it is constantly creating new ocean crust. That means that old crust must be destroyed somewhere, so, opposite a spreading center, there is usually a subduction zone: a trench where an ocean plate is being shoved back into the mantle. This constant process of creating new ocean crust and destroying old ocean crust means that the oldest ocean crust on Earth today is only about 200 million years old. 

In contrast, the bulk of the continental crust is much older. The oldest continental crustal rocks on Earth have ages in the range from about 3.7 to 4.28&amp;nbsp; billion years &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/7639024.stm|title=Team finds Earth's 'oldest rocks'|date=2008-09-26|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=2010-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P. J. Patchett and S. D. Samson, 2003, Ages and Growth of the Continental Crust from Radiogenic Isotopes. In The Crust (ed. R. L. Rudnick) volume 3, pp. 321–348 of Treatise on Geochemistry (eds. H. D. Holland and K. K. Turekian), Elsevier-Pergamon, Oxford {{ISBN|0-08-043751-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and have been found in the [[Narryer Gneiss Terrane]] in [[Western Australia]], in the [[Acasta Gneiss]] in the [[Northwest Territories]] on the [[Canadian Shield]], and on other cratonic regions such as those on the [[Fennoscandian Shield]]. Some [[zircon]] with age as great as 4.3 billion years has been found in the [[Narryer Gneiss Terrane]].

The average age of the current Earth's continental crust has been estimated to be about 2.0&amp;nbsp;billion years.&lt;ref&gt;A. I. S. Kemp and C. J. Hawkesworth, 2003, Granitic Perspectives on the Generation and Secular Evolution of the Continental Crust. In The Crust (ed. R. L. Rudnick) volume 3, pp. 349–410 of Treatise on Geochemistry (eds. H. D. Holland and K. K. Turekian), Elsevier-Pergamon, Oxford {{ISBN|0-08-043751-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most crustal rocks formed before 2.5 billion years ago are located in [[craton]]s. Such old continental crust and the underlying mantle asthenosphere are less dense than elsewhere in Earth and so are not readily destroyed by [[subduction]]. Formation of new continental crust is linked to periods of intense [[orogeny]]; these periods coincide with the formation of the [[supercontinent]]s such as [[Rodinia]], [[Pangaea]] and [[Gondwana]]. The crust forms in part by aggregation of [[island arc]]s including granite and metamorphic fold belts, and it is preserved in part by depletion of the underlying mantle to form buoyant lithospheric mantle.

== Moon's crust ==
{{main|Geology of the Moon}}
A theoretical [[protoplanet]] named "[[Theia (planet)|Theia]]" is thought to have collided with the forming Earth, and part of the material ejected into space by the collision accreted to form the Moon. As the Moon formed, the outer part of it is thought to have been molten, a “[[lunar magma ocean]].” [[Plagioclase]] [[feldspar]] crystallized in large amounts from this [[magma]] ocean and floated toward the surface. The [[cumulate rock]]s form much of the crust. The upper part of the crust probably averages about 88% plagioclase (near the lower limit of 90% defined for [[anorthosite]]): the lower part of the crust may contain a higher percentage of ferromagnesian minerals such as the [[pyroxene]]s and [[olivine]], but even that lower part probably averages about 78% plagioclase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Wieczorek |first=M. A. |lastauthoramp=yes |last2=Zuber |first2=M. T. |year=2001 |title=The composition and origin of the lunar crust: Constraints from central peaks and crustal thickness modeling |journal=Geophysical Research Letters |volume=28 |issue=21 |pages=4023–4026 |doi=10.1029/2001GL012918 |bibcode=2001GeoRL..28.4023W}}&lt;/ref&gt; The underlying mantle is denser and olivine-rich.

The thickness of the crust ranges between about 20 and 120&amp;nbsp;km. Crust on the [[far side of the Moon]] averages about 12&amp;nbsp;km thicker than that on the [[Near side of the Moon|near side]]. Estimates of average thickness fall in the range from about 50 to 60&amp;nbsp;km. Most of this plagioclase-rich crust formed shortly after formation of the moon, between about 4.5 and 4.3 billion years ago. Perhaps 10% or less of the crust consists of igneous rock added after the formation of the initial plagioclase-rich material. The best-characterized and most voluminous of these later additions are the mare [[basalt]]s formed between about 3.9 and 3.2 billion years ago. Minor volcanism continued after 3.2 billion years, perhaps as recently as 1 billion years ago. There is no evidence of [[plate tectonics]].

Study of the Moon has established that a crust can form on a rocky planetary body significantly smaller than Earth. Although the radius of the Moon is only about a quarter that of Earth, the lunar crust has a significantly greater average thickness. This thick crust formed almost immediately after formation of the Moon. Magmatism continued after the period of intense meteorite impacts ended about 3.9 billion years ago, but igneous rocks younger than 3.9 billion years make up only a minor part of the crust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.2138/rmg.2006.60.1|author=Herald Hiesinger and James W.

'''Electricity generation''' is the process of generating [[electric power]] from sources of [[primary energy]]. For [[electric utility|electric utilities]] in the [[electric power industry]], it is the first stage in the delivery of electricity to end users, the other stages being [[Electric power transmission|transmission]], [[Electric power distribution|distribution]], [[energy storage]] and recovery, using [[Pumped-storage hydroelectricity|pumped-storage]] method.

A characteristic of electricity is that it is not a primary energy freely present in nature in remarkable amounts and it must be produced. Production is carried out in [[power station]]s (also called "power plants"). Electricity is most often generated at a power plant by [[electromechanical]] [[electric generator|generators]], primarily driven by [[heat engine]]s fueled by [[combustion]] or [[nuclear fission]] but also by other means such as the [[kinetic energy]] of flowing water and wind. Other energy sources include solar [[photovoltaics]] and [[geothermal power]].

== History ==
[[File:Electricity production in the World.PNG|thumb|upright=1.3|Electricity production in the World, 1980-2013]]
The fundamental principles of electricity generation were discovered in the 1820s and early 1830s by British scientist [[Michael Faraday]]. His method, still used today, is for electricity to be generated by the movement of a loop of wire, or [[Faraday disc|disc of copper]] between the poles of a [[magnet]]. Central power stations became economically practical with the development of [[alternating current]] (AC) power transmission, using power [[transformer]]s to transmit power at high voltage and with low loss.

In 1870, commercial electricity production started with the coupling of the dynamo to the hydraulic turbine. In 1870, the mechanical production of electric power began the [[Second Industrial Revolution]] and created inventions using the energy, whose major contributors were [[Thomas Alva Edison]] and [[Nikola Tesla]]. Previously the only way to produce electricity was by chemical reactions or using battery cells, and the only practical use of electricity was for the [[telegraph]].

Electricity generation at central power stations started in 1882, when a [[steam engine]] driving a dynamo at [[Pearl Street Station]] produced a [[DC current]] that powered public lighting on [[Pearl Street (Manhattan)|Pearl Street]], [[New York City|New York]]. The new technology was quickly adopted by many cities around the world, which adapted their gas fueled street lights to electric power, and soon after electric lights would be used in public buildings, in businesses, and to power public transport, such as trams and trains.

The first power plants used water power or coal;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ethw.org/Pearl_Street_Station|title=Pearl Street Station - Engineering and Technology History Wiki|website=ethw.org|access-date=2016-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and today a variety of energy sources are used, such as [[coal]], [[nuclear power|nuclear]], [[natural gas]], [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]], [[wind generator]]s, and [[oil]], as well as [[solar energy]], [[tidal power]], and [[Geothermal power|geothermal]] sources. The use of power-lines and power-poles have been significantly important in the distribution of electricity.

[[File:Sources of Electricity in France in 2006.PNG|thumb|300px|Sources of electricity in France in 2006;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=DGEMP / Observatoire de l'énergie|date=April 2007|url=http://www.industrie.gouv.fr/energie/statisti/pdf/elec-analyse-stat.pdf|title=L’Electricité en France en 2006 : une analyse statistique.|accessdate=2007-05-23|format=PDF|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[nuclear power]] was the main source.]]

Several fundamental methods exist to convert other forms of energy into electrical energy. The [[triboelectric effect]], [[piezoelectric effect]], and even direct capture of the energy of nuclear decay [[Betavoltaics]] are used in niche applications, as is direct conversion of heat to electric power in the [[thermoelectric effect]]. Utility-scale generation is done by rotating electric generators, or by photovoltaic systems.  A very small proportion of electric power distributed by utilities is provided by batteries.

=== Generators ===
[[Electric generator]]s transform [[kinetic energy]] into electricity. This is the most used form for generating electricity and is based on [[Faraday's law of induction|Faraday's law]]. It can be seen experimentally by rotating a magnet within closed loops of a conducting material (e.g. copper wire). Almost all commercial electrical generation is done using electromagnetic induction, in which [[mechanical energy]] forces a generator to rotate:

=== Electrochemistry ===
[[File:Hoover dam from air.jpg|thumb|Large dams such as [[Hoover Dam]] can provide large amounts of [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] power; it has 2.07 [[Watt#Gigawatt|GW]] capability.]][[Electrochemistry]] is the direct transformation of [[chemical energy]] into electricity, as in a [[battery (electricity)|battery]]. Electrochemical electricity generation is important in portable and mobile applications. Currently, most electrochemical power comes from batteries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eere.energy.gov/news/archive.cfm/pubDate=%7Bd%20'2003-09-24'%7D#6490 World's Largest Utility Battery System Installed in Alaska] (press release, 2003-09-24), U.S. Department of Energy. ''"13,670 nickel-cadmium battery cells to generate up to 40 megawatts of power for about 7 minutes, or 27 megawatts of power for 15 minutes."''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Primary cell]]s, such as the common [[Zinc–carbon battery|zinc–carbon batteries]], act as power sources directly, but [[secondary cell]]s (i.e. rechargeable batteries) are used for [[electricity storage|storage]] systems rather than primary generation systems. Open electrochemical systems, known as [[fuel cell]]s, can be used to extract power either from natural fuels or from synthesized fuels. [[Osmotic power]] is a possibility at places where salt and fresh water merges.

=== Photovoltaic effect ===
The [[photovoltaic effect]] is the transformation of light into electrical energy, as in [[solar cell]]s. [[Photovoltaics|Photovoltaic panels]] convert sunlight directly to electricity. Although sunlight is free and abundant, [[solar power]] electricity is still usually more expensive to produce than large-scale mechanically generated power due to the cost of the panels. Low-efficiency silicon solar cells have been decreasing in cost and multijunction cells with close to 30% conversion efficiency are now commercially available. Over 40% efficiency has been demonstrated in experimental systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doe.gov/news/4503.htm ''New World Record Achieved in Solar Cell Technology''] (press release, 2006-12-05), U.S. Department of Energy.&lt;/ref&gt; Until recently, photovoltaics were most commonly used in remote sites where there is no access to a commercial power grid, or as a supplemental electricity source for individual homes and businesses. Recent advances in manufacturing efficiency and photovoltaic technology, combined with subsidies driven by environmental concerns, have dramatically accelerated the deployment of solar panels. Installed capacity is growing by 40% per year led by increases in Germany, Japan, and the United States.

[[File:Turbine aalborg.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Wind turbine]]s usually provide electrical generation in conjunction with other methods of producing power.]]

== Economics of generation and production of electricity ==
{{see also|Cost of electricity by source}}
The selection of electricity production modes and their economic viability varies in accordance with demand and region. The economics vary considerably around the world, resulting in widespread selling prices, e.g. the price in Venezuela is 3 cents per kWh while in Denmark it is 40 cents per kWh. [[Hydroelectric plant]]s, [[nuclear power plant]]s, [[thermal power plant]]s and [[renewable source]]s have their own pros and cons, and selection is based upon the local power requirement and the fluctuations in demand. All power grids have varying loads on them but the daily minimum is the base load, supplied by plants which run continuously.  Nuclear, coal, oil and gas plants can supply base load.

[[Thermal energy]] is economical in areas of high industrial density, as the high demand cannot be met by renewable sources. The effect of localized pollution is also minimized as industries are usually located away from residential areas. These plants can also withstand variation in load and consumption by adding more units or temporarily decreasing the production of some units.
Nuclear power plants can produce a huge amount of power from a single unit. However, recent disasters in Japan have raised concerns over the safety of nuclear power, and the capital cost of nuclear plants is very high.
Hydroelectric power plants are located in areas where the potential energy from falling water can be harnessed for moving turbines and the generation of power. It is not an economically viable source of production where the load varies too much during the annual production cycle and the ability to store the flow of water is limited.

Due to advancements in technology, and with mass production, renewable sources other than hydroelectricity (solar power, wind energy, tidal power, etc.) experienced decreases in cost of production, and the energy is now in many cases cost-comparative with fossil fuels. Many governments around the world provide subsidies to offset the higher cost of any new power production, and to make the installation of renewable energy systems economically feasible. However, their use is frequently limited by their [[Intermittent energy source|intermittent nature]].
If natural gas prices are below $3 per million [[British thermal unit]]s, generating electricity from natural gas is cheaper than generating power by burning coal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/modeledbehavior/2013/03/22/will-natural-gas-stay-cheap-enough-replace-coal-and-lower-us-carbon-emissions/ | work=Forbes | first=Karl | last=Smith| title= Will Natural Gas Stay Cheap Enough To Replace Coal And Lower Us Carbon Emissions| date= 22 March 2013| accessdate= 20 June 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Generating equipment==
=== Turbines ===
Almost all commercial electrical power on Earth is generated with a [[turbine]], driven by wind, water, steam or burning gas. The turbine drives a generator, thus transforming its mechanical energy into electrical energy by electromagnetic induction. There are many different methods of developing mechanical energy, including [[heat engine]]s, hydro, wind and tidal power. Most electric generation is driven by [[heat engine]]s. The combustion of [[fossil fuel]]s supplies most of the energy to these engines, with a significant fraction from [[nuclear fission]] and some from [[renewable source]]s. The modern [[steam turbine]] (invented by [[Charles Algernon Parsons|Sir Charles Parsons]] in 1884) currently generates about 80% of the [[electric power]] in the world using a variety of heat sources. Turbine types include:
*Steam [[File:Dreischluchtendamm hauptwall 2006.jpg|thumb|Large dams such as [[Three Gorges Dam]] in China can provide large amounts of [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] power; it has a 22.5 [[Watt#Gigawatt|GW]] capability.]]
** Water is boiled by [[coal]] burned in a [[Fossil-fuel power station|thermal power plant]], about 41% of all electricity is generated this way.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldcoal.org/coal/uses-coal/coal-electricity|title=Coal &amp; electricity|website=World Coal Association|access-date=2016-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Nuclear fission]] heat created in a [[nuclear reactor]] creates steam. Less than 15% of electricity is generated this way.
**Renewables. The steam is generated by [[Biomass]], [[Solar thermal energy]] where [[solar parabolic trough]]s and [[solar power tower]]s concentrate sunlight to heat a heat transfer fluid, which is then used to produce steam, or [[Geothermal power]].
*Natural gas: turbines are driven directly by gases produced by combustion. [[Combined cycle]] are driven by both steam and natural gas. They generate power by burning natural gas in a [[gas turbine]] and use residual heat to generate steam. At least 20% of the worlds electricity is generated by natural gas.
*Water Energy is captured from the movement of water. From falling water, the rise and fall of tides or [[Ocean thermal energy conversion|ocean thermal currents]]. Each driving a [[water turbine]] to produce approximately 16% of the world's electricity.
*The [[windmill]] was a very early [[wind turbine]]. In a [[solar updraft tower]] wind is artificially produced. Before 2010 less than 2% of the worlds electricity was produced from wind.
Although turbines are most common in commercial power generation, smaller generators can be powered by [[gasoline]] or [[diesel engine]]s. These may used for back up generation or isolated villages.

===Generators===
[[File:Stator winding at WPS.JPG|thumb|center|upright=2.0|A large generator with the rotor removed]]
{{main|Electric generator}}
Electric generators were known in simple forms from the discovery of the [[Electromagnetic induction|magnetic induction]] of electric current in the 1830s. In general, some form of prime mover such as an engine or the turbines described above, drives a rotating magnetic field past stationary coils of wire thereby turning mechanical energy into electricity. A very large 2000 MW(2,682,000 horsepower) unit designed by Siemens was built for unit 3 at the Olkiluoto Nuclear Power Plant.&lt;ref&gt;http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5075247/?reload=true&amp;arnumber=5075247&amp;queryText%3D2000%20mw%20generator&amp;tp=&lt;/ref&gt; The only commercial scale electricity production that does not employ a generator is solar PV.

Total energy consumed at all power plants for the generation of electricity was 4,398,768 ktoe (kilo [[ton of oil equivalent]]) which was 36% of the total for primary energy sources (TPES) of 2008. &lt;br&gt;
Electricity output (gross) was 1,735,579 ktoe (20,185 TWh), efficiency was 39%, and the balance of 61% was generated heat. A small part (145,141 ktoe, which was 3% of the input total) of the heat was utilized at co-generation heat and power plants. The in-house consumption of electricity and power transmission losses were 289,681 ktoe.
The amount supplied to the final consumer was 1,445,285 ktoe (16,430 TWh) which was 33% of the total energy consumed at power plants and heat and power [[co-generation]] (CHP) plants.&lt;ref&gt;International Energy Agency, "[http://www.iea.org/stats/balancetable.asp?COUNTRY_CODE=29 2008 Energy Balance for World]", 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States has long been the largest producer and consumer of electricity, with a global share in 2005 of at least 25%, followed by [[Electric power industry in China|China]], Japan, Russia, and India. As of Jan-2010, total electricity generation for the two largest generators was as follows: USA: 3,992 billion kWh (3,992 TWh); China: 3,715 billion kWh (3,715 TWh).

{{main article||Environmental impact of electricity generation}}

Variations between countries generating electrical power affect concerns about the environment. In France only 10% of electricity is generated from fossil fuels, the US is higher at 70% and China is at 80%.&lt;ref name="Statistics and Balances"/&gt;  The cleanliness of electricity depends on its source. Most scientists agree that emissions of pollutants and greenhouse gases from fossil fuel-based electricity generation account for a significant portion of world greenhouse gas emissions; in the United States, electricity generation accounts for nearly 40% of emissions, the largest of any source. Transportation emissions are close behind, contributing about one-third of U.S. production of [[carbon dioxide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2003732690_carbon03.html | work=The Seattle Times | title=Carbon-emissions culprit?

In the United States, fossil fuel combustion for electric power generation is responsible for 65% of all emissions of [[sulfur dioxide]], the main component of acid rain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sulfur Dioxide|publisher=US Environmental Protection Agency|url=http://www.epa.gov/air/sulfurdioxide/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Electricity generation is the fourth highest combined source of [[NOx]], [[carbon monoxide]], and [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulate matter]] in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AirData|publisher=US Environmental Protection Agency|url=http://www.epa.gov/cgi-bin/broker?_service=airdata&amp;_program=progs.webprogs.emcatbar.scl&amp;_debug=2&amp;geotype=us&amp;geocode=USA&amp;geoname=United+States&amp;epol=CO+NOX+VOC+SO2+PM25+PM10&amp;years=2002&amp;mapsize=zsc&amp;reqtype=viewmap}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In July 2011, the UK parliament tabled a motion that "levels of (carbon) emissions from nuclear power were approximately three times lower per [[kilowatt hour]] than those of solar, four times lower than clean coal and 36 times lower than conventional coal".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/edm/2010-12/2061|title=Early day motion 2061|work=UK Parliament|accessdate=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In fluid mechanics, flows in closed conduits are usually encountered in places such as  drains and sewers where the liquid flows continuously in the closed channel and the channel is filled only up to a certain depth. Typical examples of such flows are flow in circular and Δ shaped channels. Closed conduit flow differs from open channel flow only in the fact that in closed channel flow there is a closing top width while open channels have one side exposed to its immediate surroundings. Closed channel flows are generally governed by the principles of channel flow as the liquid flowing possesses [[Free surface flow|free surface]] inside the conduit.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, the convergence of the boundary to the top imparts some special characteristics to the flow like closed channel flows have a finite depth at which maximum discharge occurs.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; For computational purposes, flow is taken as uniform flow .[[Manning formula|Manning's Equation]], Continuity Equation (Q=AV) and channel's cross-section geometrical relations are used for the mathematical calculation of such closed channel flows.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Mathematical Analysis for Flow in Circular Channel ==
Consider a closed circular conduit of diameter D, partly full with liquid flowing inside it. Let 2θ be the angle, in radians, subtended by the free surface at the centre of the conduit as shown in figure (a).

The area of the cross-section (A) of the liquid flowing through the conduit is calculated as :
[[File:Partly Full Conduit.png|thumb|Figure (a) Partly Filled Conduit through which fluid is flowing]]
&lt;math&gt;\begin {align} A =&amp;  {{D^2\theta}\over{4}}-2\biggl(\left ( \frac{1}{2} \right )\frac{D}{2}sin\theta\frac{D}{2}cos\theta\Biggr)\\&amp;=\frac{D^2}{4}\biggl(\theta-\frac{1}{2}sin2\theta\biggr)\\ \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;                                                                                                                           (Equation 1)

Now, the wetted perimeter (P) is given by :

&lt;math&gt;P=D\theta&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, the hydraulic radius (R&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;) is calculated using cross-sectional area (A) and wetted perimeter (P) using the relation:

&lt;math&gt;R_h=\frac{A}{P}=\frac{D}{4}\biggl(1-\frac{1}{2}\frac{sin2\theta}{\theta}\biggr)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;                                                                                                                                         (Equation 2)

The rate of discharge may be calculated from [[Manning’s equation]] :

&lt;math&gt;Q=\frac{D^2}{4}\biggl(\theta-\frac{1}{2}sin2\theta\biggr)\biggl(\frac{1}{n}\biggr)S^{\frac{1}{2}}{{\biggl(\frac{D}{4}\biggl(1-\frac{1}{2}\frac{sin2\theta}{\theta}\biggr)\biggr)}^{\frac{2}{3}}}
&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introduction to Fluid Mechanics and Fluid Machines|last=Suman Chakraborty|first=S K Som|publisher=McGraw Hill Education|year=2004|isbn=978-0-07-132919-4|location=New Delhi|pages=599, 600|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;=K\biggl(\theta-\frac{sin2\theta}{2}\biggr){{\biggl(1-\frac{sin2\theta}{2\theta}\Biggr)}^{\frac{2}{3}}}
&lt;/math&gt;                                                                                                                                  (Equation 3)

where the constant&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;K=\frac{{D}^{\frac{8}{3}}}{{4}^{\frac{5}{3}}}\frac{{S}^{\frac{1}{2}}}{{n}}
&lt;/math&gt;

Now putting &lt;math&gt;\theta=\pi&lt;/math&gt; in the above equation yields us the rate of discharge for conduit flowing full (Q&lt;sub&gt;full)&lt;/sub&gt;)

&lt;math&gt;Q_{(full)}=K\pi&lt;/math&gt;                                                                                                                                                                        (Equation 4)

== Final Dimensionless Quantities                                                                                                                                                                    ==
In Dimensionless form, the rate of discharge Q is usually expressed in a dimensionless form as&amp;nbsp;:
[[File:Variation of discharge and velocity with depth of flow.png|thumb]]
&lt;math&gt;\frac{Q}{{Q}_{full}}=\frac{1}{\pi}\biggl(\theta-\frac{sin2\theta}{2}\biggr){{\biggl(1-\frac{sin2\theta}{2\theta}\biggr)}^{\frac{2}{3}}}&lt;/math&gt;   &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;                                                                                                                   (Equation 5)

Similarly for velocity (V) we can write&amp;nbsp;:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{V}{{V}_{(full)}}={{\biggl(1-\frac{sin2\theta}{2\theta}\biggr)}^{\frac{2}{3}}}&lt;/math&gt;  &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;                                                                                                                                                (Equation 6)

The depth of flow (H) is expressed in a dimensionless form as&amp;nbsp;:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{H}{D}=\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{2}cos\theta&lt;/math&gt;             &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;                                                                                                                                                    (Equation 7)

== Flow Characteristics ==
The variations of Q/Q&lt;sub&gt;(full)&lt;/sub&gt; and V/V&lt;sub&gt;(full)&lt;/sub&gt; with H/D ratio is shown in figure(b).From the equation 5, maximum value of Q/Q&lt;sub&gt;(full)&lt;/sub&gt; is found to be equal to 1.08 at H/D =0.94 which implies that maximum rate of discharge through a conduit is observed for a conduit partly full. Similarly the maximum value of V/V&lt;sub&gt;(full)&lt;/sub&gt; (which is equal to 1.14) is also observed at conduit partly full with H/D = 0.81.The physical explanation for these results are generally attributed to the typical variation of [[Chezy formula|Chezy’s coefficient]] with hydraulic radius R&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; in Manning’s formula.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, an important assumption is taken that Manning’s Roughness coefficient ‘n’ is independent to the depth of flow while calculating these values.Also, the dimensional curve of Q/Q(full) shows that when the depth is greater than about 0.82D, then there are two possible different depths for the same discharge, one above and below the value of 0.938D&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=OPEN CHANNEL HYDRAULICS|last=CHOW|first=VEN TE|publisher=McGraw Hill Publications|year=1959|oclc=4010975|location=NEW YORK|pages=134|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice, it is common to restrict the flow below the value of 0.82D to avoid the region of two normal depths due to the fact that if the depth exceeds the depth of 0.82D then any small disturbance in water surface may lead the water surface to seek alternate normal depths thus leading to surface instability.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=FLOW IN OPEN CHANNELS|last=SUBRAMANYAM|first=K.|publisher=McGRAW HILL PUBLICATIONS|year=2009|isbn=978-0-07-008695-1|location=NEW DELHI|pages=106, 107, 113|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sunstroke plants''' or '''heliophytes'''  are adapted to a [[habitat]] with a very intensive [[Solar irradiance|insolation]], because of the construction of its own structure and maintenance ([[metabolism]]). Solar plants, for example, are [[mullein]], [[Calluna|ling]], [[thyme]] and [[Cirsium oleraceum|soft velcro]], [[white clover]], and most [[rose]]s. They are common in open terrain, rocks, [[meadows]], as well as at the mountain [[pasture]]s and [[grassland]]s and other long sunny exposures.&lt;ref name="Sofradzija"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sofradžija A., Šoljan D., Hadžiselimović R. |year= 2004|title= Biologija 1.|publisher= Svjetlost, Sarajevo|isbn=9958-10-686-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Međedović"&gt;{{cite book|author=Međedović S., Maslić E., Hadžiselimović R.|year=2002|title=Biologija 2. |publisher=Svjetlost, Sarajevo|isbn=9958-10-222-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Special features of the plant include coarse tiny [[leaf|leaves]] with hairy and [[wax]]y protection against excessive light radiation and water loss. In structure, the leaves vary in frequent double [[palisade tissue|palisade layers]]. [[Chloroplast]]s have a protective element such as [[carotenoid]] and the [[enzyme]]s, and accumulation of [[reactive oxygen|ROS]] to avoid toxic effects. In addition, there are also [[stoma | stoma tal apparatus]] on the leaves and green [[shoot]]s, in order to allow a better exchange of gases. At same time, this increases possibilities for [[photosynthesis]].&lt;ref name="Walter"&gt;{{cite book|last=Walter S Judd|first=Walter S.|first2=Christopher S. |last2=Campbell |first3=Elizabeth A. |last3=Kellogg |first4=Peter F. |last4=Stevens |first5=Michael J. |last5=Donoghue|title=Plant systematics: a phylogenetic approach. (1st ed. 1999, 2nd 2002)|year=2007|edition=3|publisher=Sinauer Associates|isbn=0-87893-407-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kr3uAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=29 January 2014|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Simpson"&gt;{{cite book|last=Simpson|first=Michael G.|title=Plant Systematics|year=2011|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=0-08-051404-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ia2eIPVksMMC|accessdate=12 February 2014|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the shadow-preferring plants, heliophytes have a high [[light compensation point]], and for this they need a higher illumination intensity for effective adoption of [[carbon dioxide]]. Sunstroke leaves, in this respect, has a very high capacity, to
&lt;br&gt;&lt;math&gt;30\mu molCO_2/m^2s&lt;/math&gt;.

However, they have a higher [[basal metabolism]] comparing  to the other leaves.

The '''International Radiation Protection Association''' ('''IRPA''') is an independent non-profit association of national and regional [[radiation protection]] societies, and its mission is to advance radiation protection throughout the world. It is the international professional association for radiation protection.&lt;ref name="IRPAMORE"&gt;{{cite web|last1=IRPA|title=History of IRPA|url=http://www.irpa.net/page.asp?id=10|website=International Radiation Protection Association (IRPA|publisher=IRPA|accessdate=14 July 2017}})&lt;/ref&gt;

IRPA is recognized by the [[IAEA]] as a [[Non Governmental Organization]] (NGO) and is an observer on the IAEA Radiation Safety Standards Committee (RASSC).&lt;ref name="IRPAEXEC1216"&gt;{{cite web|last1=IRPA EXECUTIVE COUNCIL REPORT FOR THE TERM 2012 – 2016|title=IRPA Executive report 2012-2016|url=http://www.irpa.net/members/3/%7B7EA772AF-BA5A-4DF9-A575-5803A091FC5E%7D/IRPA%20EC%20report%202012-2016.pdf|publisher=IRPA|accessdate=17 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IRPA was formed on June 19, 1965, at a meeting in [[Los Angeles]]; stimulated by the desire of radiation protection professionals to have a world-wide body. Membership includes 50 Associate Societies covering 65 countries, totalling approximately 18,000 individual members.&lt;ref name="IRPAMORE14"&gt;{{cite web |title=International Radiation Protection Association official website, More about IRPA| url=http://www.irpa.net/page.asp?id=3 | accessdate=7 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''January 1961 nor'easter''' was a significant winter storm that impacted the [[Mid-Atlantic States|Mid-Atlantic]] and [[New England]] regions of the [[United States]]. It was the second of three major snowstorms during the 1960–1961 winter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|title=Historic Blizzards|date=|publisher=Farmers' Almanac|accessdate=February 10, 2010|url=http://www.farmersalmanac.com/weather/a/historic-blizzards}}&lt;/ref&gt; The storm ranked as Category 3, or "major", on the [[Northeast Snowfall Impact Scale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|title=January 18–21, 1961|date=|publisher=National Climatic Data Center|accessdate=February 10, 2010|url=http://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/cmb/images/snow/nesis/19610118-19610121.jpg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synoptic history==
The storm was preceded by a [[cold front]] that brought cold air, associated with an area of high pressure north of the [[Great Lakes]], into the area. The low pressure system quickly moved towards the East Coast on January 19 from the southern United States.&lt;ref name="Kocin p. 400"/&gt; Its track was unusually far north, passing through the mid-[[Ohio Valley]]. The low tracked from [[Tennessee]] to the southern [[Appalachian Mountains]], and moved off the coast of [[Virginia]].&lt;ref name="NWS Charleston"&gt;{{cite web|author=National Weather Service Charleston, WV|date=|title=January 18–20, 1961|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|accessdate=February 10, 2010|url=http://www.erh.noaa.gov/rlx/science/winter/jan182161.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; It rapidly strengthened; from 0000 UTC to 1200 UTC on January 20, it intensified from 996 [[millibars]] to 972 mb.&lt;ref name="Kocin p. 402"&gt;Kocin and Uccellini, p. 402&lt;/ref&gt; The storm's intensification was accompanied by an increase in the precipitation.&lt;ref name="Kocin p. 400"/&gt; It ultimately moved northeastward along the coast and reached its lowest barometric pressure of 964 mb late on January 20, while situated east of New England.&lt;ref name="Kocin p. 400"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kocin p. 402"/&gt;

Widespread heavy snow fell from [[West Virginia]] and [[Virginia]] through [[Massachusetts]] and southern [[New Hampshire]], with lighter amounts spreading into [[Maine]]. Totals of over {{convert|20|in|cm|abbr=on}} were recorded from eastern [[Pennsylvania]] through central New England.&lt;ref name="Kocin p. 401"&gt;Kocin and Uccellini, p. 401&lt;/ref&gt;  Snowfall amounts were similar to that of a winter storm in February 1958.&lt;ref name="NWS Charleston"/&gt; Following the storm, an [[anticyclone]] in the central United States maintained the cold air.&lt;ref name="Kocin p. 400"/&gt;

==Impact==
The nor'easter is sometimes referred to as the Kennedy Inaugural Snowstorm, since it struck on the eve of the [[inauguration of John F. Kennedy]].&lt;ref name="Kocin p. 400"&gt;Kocin and Uccellini, p. 400&lt;/ref&gt; In advance of the storm, the [[Weather Bureau]] predicted a mix of rain and snow in [[Washington, D.C.]], but instead, the precipitation remained frozen. The unexpected snowfall resulted in "chaos", and thousands of cars were marooned or abandoned, triggering massive traffic jams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Andrea Stone|title=Record Falls With Snow in Washington, DC|date=February 10, 2010|publisher=''AOL News''|accessdate=February 10, 2010|url=http://www.aolnews.com/nation/article/records-falling-with-snow-in-washington-dc/19352657|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100212050857/http://www.aolnews.com/nation/article/records-falling-with-snow-in-washington-dc/19352657|archivedate=February 12, 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]], "The Engineers teamed up with more than 1,000 District of Columbia employees to clear the inaugural parade route. Luckily much equipment and some men had been pre-positioned and were ready to go. In the end the task force employed hundreds of dump trucks, front-end loaders, sanders, plows, rotaries, and flamethrowers to clear the way."&lt;ref name="inauguration"&gt;{{cite web|author=Jason Samenow|title=Inauguration Weather: The Case of Kennedy|date=January 9, 2009|publisher=''The Washington Post''|accessdate=February 10, 2010|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/capitalweathergang/2009/01/inauguration_weather_the_case.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The snowstorm prevented former President [[Herbert Hoover]] from flying into [[Washington National Airport]] and attending Kennedy's swearing-in ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=National Weather Service Sterling, VA|title=Presidential Inaugural Weather|date=|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|accessdate=February 10, 2010|url=http://www.erh.noaa.gov/lwx/Historic_Events/Inauguration/Inauguration.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Additionally, the storm dealt the final blow to the Texas Tower #4, a USAF radar installation in the Atlantic Ocean, causing her to sink with the loss of all 28 crew aboard.&lt;ref&gt;http://scienceblogs.com/sciencepunk/2010/05/02/the-tragedy-of-texas-tower-4/&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Kyropoulos process''' is a method of bulk [[crystal growth]] used to obtain [[single crystal|single crystals]]. The process is named for Spyro Kyropoulos, who proposed the technique in 1926 as a method to grow brittle [[alkali metal halide|alkali halide]] and [[alkali earth metal]] crystals for precision optics.&lt;ref&gt;"Evolution and Application of the Kyropoulos Crystal Growth Method", David F. Bliss, in "50 Years of Progress in Crystal Growth: A Reprint Collection", Ed. Robert Feigelson, Elsevier, 2005 {{ISBN|0080489931}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kyropoulos |first1=S. |title=Ein Verfahren zur Herstellung großer Kristalle |journal=Zeitschrift für anorganische und allgemeine Chemie |date=1926 |volume=154 |page=308–313 |doi=10.1002/zaac.19261540129 |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest application of the Kyropoulos process is to grow large [[boule (crystal)|boules]] of [[sapphire|single crystal sapphire]] used to produce [[substrate (electronics)|substrates]] for the manufacture [[gallium nitride]]-based [[Light-emitting diode#Blue_and_ultraviolet|LEDs]], and as a durable optical material.&lt;ref name="springer"&gt;Dobrovinskaya, Elena R., Leonid A. Lytvynov, and Valerian Pishchik. Sapphire: material, manufacturing, applications. Springer Science &amp; Business Media, 2009. {{ISBN|0387856943}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Application ==

The Kyropoulos process (often referred to as the KY process) for sapphire crystal growth was developed in the 1970s in the [[Soviet Union]]. It is currently used by several companies around the world to produce sapphire for the [[electronics industry|electronics]] and optics industries.&lt;ref&gt;"Status Of the Sapphire Industry." Eric Virey. Yole-CIOE Sapphire Forum, Shenzhen, August 31st 2015. Yole Development. p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Production of Kyropoulos sapphire ==
[[File:Sapphire boule, Kyropoulos method.jpg|thumb|Single crystal sapphire boule grown by Kyropoulos method. Approximately 200&amp;nbsp;mm diameter and approximately 30&amp;nbsp;kg. (A second boule is visible in the background.)]]

High-purity, [[aluminum oxide]] (only a few parts per million of impurities) is melted in a [[crucible]] at over 2100&amp;nbsp;°C. Typically the crucible is made of [[tungsten]] or [[molybdenum]].  A precisely oriented [[seed crystal]] is dipped into the molten alumina. The seed crystal is slowly pulled upwards and may be rotated simultaneously. By precisely controlling the temperature gradients, rate of pulling and rate of temperature decrease, it is possible to produce a large, single-crystal, roughly cylindrical ingot from the melt. In contrast with the [[Czochralski process]], the Kyropoulos process crystallizes the entire feedstock volume into the boule. The size and [[aspect ratio]] of the crucible is close to that of the final crystal, and the crystal grows downward into the crucible, rather than being pulled up and out of the crucible as in the Czochralski method. The upward pulling of the seed is at a much slower rate than the downward growth of the crystal, and serves primarily to shape the [[meniscus (liquid)|meniscus]] of the solid-liquid [[interface (matter)|interface]] via [[surface tension]]. The growth rate is controlled by slowly decreasing the temperature of the [[vacuum furnace|furnace]] until the entire melt has solidified. Hanging the seed from a weight sensor can provide [[feedback]] to determine the growth rate, although precise measurements are complicated by the changing and imperfect shape of the crystal diameter, the unknown convex shape of the solid-liquid interface, and these features' interaction with [[buoyancy|buoyant forces]] and [[convection]] within the melt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Winkler|first1=Jan|last2=Neubert|first2=Michael|editor1-last=Rudolph|editor1-first=Peter|title=Handbook of Crystal Growth|date=2015|publisher=Elsevier B.V.|pages=1176-1178|edition=2nd|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-444-63303-3.00028-6|chapter=Automation of Crystal Growth from Melt}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kyropoulos method is characterized by smaller temperature gradients at the crystallization front than the Czochralski method. Like the Czochralski method, the crystal grows free of any external mechanical shaping forces, and thus has few [[crystallographic defect|lattice defects]] and low [[stress (mechanics)|internal stress]].&lt;ref name="springer" /&gt; This process can be performed in an [[Inert gas|inert]] atmosphere, such as [[argon]], or under high [[vacuum]].

== Crystal sizes==

The sizes of sapphire crystals grown by the Kyropoulos process have increased dramatically since the 1980s. In the mid-2000s sapphire crystals up to 30&amp;nbsp;kg were developed which could yield 150&amp;nbsp;mm diameter substrates. By 2017, the largest reported sapphire grown by the Kyropoulos method was 350&amp;nbsp;kg, and could produce 300&amp;nbsp;mm diameter substrates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Monocrystal introduced world’s first 350&amp;nbsp;kg KY sapphire crystal|url=http://monocrystal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2017-03-13_PR_MC_350kg_KY_crystal.pdf|website=Monocrystal|accessdate=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of sapphire's [[anisotropic]] [[crystal structure]], the orientation of the cylindrical axis of the boules grown by the Kyropoulos process is perpendicular to the orientation required for deposition of GaN on the LED substrates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tang|first1=Huili|last2=Li|first2=Hongjun|last3=Xu|first3=Jun|editor1-last=Ferreira|editor1-first=Sukarno|title=Advanced Topics on Crystal Growth|date=2013|publisher=InTech|url=https://www.intechopen.com/books/advanced-topics-on-crystal-growth/growth-and-development-of-sapphire-crystal-for-led-applications|chapter=Growth and Development of Sapphire Crystal for LED Applications}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that cores must be drilled through the sides of the boule before being sliced into [[wafer (electronics)|wafers]]. This means the as-grown boules have a significantly larger diameter than the resulting wafers. As of 2017 the leading manufacturers of blue and white LEDs use 150&amp;nbsp;mm diameter sapphire substrates, with some manufacturers still using 100&amp;nbsp;mm, and 2&amp;nbsp;inch substrates.

'''Lead(II) iodide''' or '''lead iodide''' is a [[salt (chemistry)|salt]] with the formula {{chem|Pb|I|2}}.  At [[room temperature]], it is a bright yellow odorless [[crystal]]line solid, that becomes orange and red when heated.&lt;ref name="sigma"/&gt;  It was formerly called '''plumbous iodide.'''

The compound currently has a few specialized applications, such as the manufacture of [[solar cells]]{{sfn|Dhiaputra|Permana|Maulana|Dwi Inayatie|2016}} and [[X-rays|X-ray]] and [[gamma rays|gamma-ray]] detectors.{{sfn|Shah|Olschner|Moy|Bennett|1996}}  Its preparation is a popular demonstration in basic [[chemistry]] education, to teach topics such as [[double displacement reaction]]s and [[stoichiometry]].&lt;ref name="anthony"/&gt;  It is [[photolysis|decomposed by light]] at moderately high temperatures&lt;ref name="patnaik"/&gt; and this effect has been used in a patented [[photography|photographic]] process.&lt;ref name="patphot"/&gt;

Lead iodide was formerly employed as a yellow pigment in some paints, with the name '''iodide yellow'''.  However, that use has been largely discontinued due to its toxicity and poor stability.{{sfn|Eastaugh|Walsh|Chaplin|Siddall|2004}}

==Preparation==

{{chem|Pb|I|2}} is commonly synthesized via a double displacement reaction between [[potassium iodide]] {{chem|K|I}} and [[lead(II) nitrate]] {{chem|Pb}}({{chem|N|O|3}})&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in water solution:

:Pb(NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 KI &amp;rarr; PbI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 KNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

While the potassium nitrate {{chem|K|N|O|3}} is soluble, the lead iodide {{chem|Pb|I|2}} is nearly insoluble at [[room temperature]], and thus [[precipitate]]s out.{{sfn|Ahmad|Prakash|2012}}

Other soluble salts containing lead(II) and iodide can be used instead, for example [[lead(II) acetate]]{{sfn|Dhiaputra|Permana|Maulana|Dwi Inayatie|2016}} and [[sodium iodide]].

The compound can also be synthesized by reacting [[iodine]] vapor with molten [[lead]] between 500 and 700&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="matuz"/&gt;

A thin film of {{chem|Pb|I|2}} can also be prepared by depositing a film of [[lead(II) sulfide|lead sulfide]] {{chem|Pb|S}} and exposing it to iodine vapor, by the reaction

:PbS + I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;rarr; PbI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + S

The [[sulfur]] is then washed with [[dimethyl sulfoxide]].&lt;ref name="chaud"/&gt;

==Crystallization==

Lead iodide prepared from cold solutions of {{chem|Pb|2+}} and {{chem|I|-}} salts usually consists of many small hexagonal platelets, giving the yellow precipitate a silky appearance.  Larger crystals can be obtained by exploiting the fact that [[solubility]] of lead iodide in water (like those of [[lead(II) chloride|lead chloride]] and [[lead(II) bromide|lead bromide]]) increases dramatically with temperature.  The compound is colorless when dissolved in hot water, but crystallizes on cooling as thin but visibly larger bright yellow flakes, that settle slowly through the liquid — a visual effect often described as "golden rain".&lt;ref name="gold"/&gt;  Larger crystals can be obtained by [[autoclave|autoclaving]] the {{chem|Pb|I|2}} with water under pressure at 200&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="zhu"/&gt;

Even larger crystals can be obtained by slowing down the common reaction.  A simple setup is to submerge two [[Beaker (glassware)|beaker]]s containing the concentrated reactants in a larger container of water, taking care to avoid currents.  As the two substances [[diffusion|diffuse]] through the water and meet, they slowly react and deposit the iodide in the space between the beakers.&lt;ref name="tub"/&gt;

Another similar method, pioneered by [[E. Hatschek]] in the early 20th century,&lt;ref name="hats"/&gt; is to react the two substances in a [[gel]] medium, that slows down the diffusion and supports the growing crystal away from the container's walls. Patel and Rao have used this method to grow crystals up to 30&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter and 2&amp;nbsp;mm thick&lt;ref name="patrao"/&gt;

The reaction can be slowed also by separating the two reagents with a permeable membrane. This approach, with a [[cellulose]] membrane, was used in September 1988 to study the growth of {{chem|Pb|I|2}} crystals in zero gravity, in an experiment flown on the [[Space Shuttle Discovery]].{{sfn|Scaife|Cavoli|Blanton|Morse|1990}}	

{{chem|Pb|I|2}} can also be crystallized from powder by [[Sublimation (phase transition)|sublimation]] at 390&amp;nbsp;°C, in near [[vacuum]]&lt;ref name="forn"/&gt; or in a current of [[argon]] with some [[hydrogen]].{{sfn|Liu|Ha|Zhang|de la Mata|2015}}

Large high-purity crystals can be obtained by [[zone melting]] or by the [[Bridgman–Stockbarger technique]].&lt;ref name="matuz"/&gt;&lt;ref name="forn"/&gt; These processes can remove various impurities from commercial {{chem|Pb|I|2}}.{{sfn|Tonn|Matuchova|Danilewsky|Cröll|2015}}

==Applications==

Lead iodide is a precursor material in the fabrication of highly efficient [[solar cells]]. Typically, a solution of {{chem|Pb|I|2}} in an organic solvent, such as [[dimethylformamide]] or dimethylsulfoxide, is applied over a [[titanium dioxide]] layer by [[spin coating]]. The layer is then treated with a solution of [[methylammonium iodide]] {{chem|C|H|3|N|H|3|I}} and [[Annealing (metallurgy)|annealed]], turning it into the [[double salt]] [[methylammonium lead iodide]] {{chem|C|H|3|N|H|3|Pb|I|3}}, with a [[perovskite]] structure.  The reaction changes the film's color from yellow to light brown.{{sfn|Dhiaputra|Permana|Maulana|Dwi Inayatie|2016}}

{{chem|Pb|I|2}} is also used as a high-energy photon detector for gamma-rays and X-rays, due to its wide band gap which ensures low noise operation.&lt;ref name="patnaik"/&gt;{{sfn|Shah|Olschner|Moy|Bennett|1996}}&lt;ref name="forn"/&gt;

Lead iodide was formerly used as a paint pigment under the name "iodine yellow.  It was described by [[Prosper Mérimée]] (1830) as "not yet much known in commerce, is as bright as [[orpiment]] or [[lead(II) chromate|chromate of lead]]. It is thought to be more permanent; but time only can prove its pretension to so essential a quality. It is prepared by precipitating a solution of acetate or nitrate of lead, with potassium iodide: the nitrate produces a more brilliant yellow color."{{sfn|Eastaugh|Walsh|Chaplin|Siddall|2004}}  However, due to the toxicity and instability of the compound it is no longer used as such.{{sfn|Eastaugh|Walsh|Chaplin|Siddall|2004}}   It may still be used in art for [[bronzing]] and in gold-like [[mosaic]] tiles.&lt;ref name="patnaik"/&gt;

== Toxicity ==

Lead iodide is very toxic to human health.  Ingestion will cause many acute and chronic consequences characteristic of [[lead poisoning]].{{sfn|Flora|Gupta|Tiwari|2012}} Lead iodide has been found to be a carcinogen in animals suggesting the same may hold true in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hazmap.nlm.nih.gov/category-details?id=2524|title=Haz-Map Category Details|website=hazmap.nlm.nih.gov|access-date=2016-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==

The structure of {{chem|Pb|I|2}}, as determined by [[X-ray powder diffraction]], is primarily hexagonal close-packed system with alternating between layers of lead atoms and iodide atoms, with largely ionic bonding.{{sfn|Liu|Ha|Zhang|de la Mata|2015}} Weak Van der Waals interactions have been observed between lead–iodide layers.{{sfn|Shah|Olschner|Moy|Bennett|1996}}  The solid can also take a rhombohedral structure as well.{{sfn|Bhavsar|2011}}{{sfn|Hassan|Jafar|Matuchova|Bulos|2010}}

The '''Linnaean enterprise''' is the task of identifying and describing all living [[species]]. It is named after [[Carl Linnaeus]], a Swedish [[botanist]], [[ecologist]] and physician who laid the foundations for the modern scheme of [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

As of 2006, the Linnaean enterprise is considered to be barely begun. There are estimated to be 10 million living species, but only about 1.5-1.8 million have been even named, and fewer than 1% of these have been studied enough to understand the basics of their ecological roles.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Edward O.|date=2000-09-29|title=A Global Biodiversity Map|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/289/5488/2279|journal=Science|language=en|volume=289|issue=5488|pages=2279–2279|doi=10.1126/science.289.5488.2279|issn=0036-8075|pmid=11041790}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linnaean enterprise plays a larger role in [[applied science]] and basic science. With applied science, it can assist in finding new natural products and species ([[bioprospecting]]) and effective conservation practices&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. It allows for an understanding of [[evolutionary biology]] and how ecosystems function in basic science&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. 

The cost of completing the Linnaean Enterprise has been estimated at US$ 5 billion.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Carl Linnaeus ==
Carl Linnaeus 1707-1778, was one of the most well known natural scientists of his time. Very unsatisfied with the current way of naming living things, he is responsible for creating the two part system or process in which we use today, to name all living things called [[Binomial nomenclature|binomial nomenclature.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.famousscientists.org/carolus-linnaeus/|title=Carolus Linnaeus - Biography, Facts and Pictures|website=www.famousscientists.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Lira–Gulu–Nebbi–Arua High Voltage Power Line''' is a high voltage electricity power line, under construction in [[Uganda]]. It connects the high voltage substation at [[Lira, Uganda|Lira]], in [[Lira District]], to another high voltage substation at [[Arua]], in [[Arua District]], all in the [[Northern Region, Uganda|Northern Region]] of the country.

==Overview==
This power line is intended to transmit electricity in an improved, sustainable manner to Uganda's Northern Region and extend the national electric grid to the [[West Nile sub-region]]. This is in line with [[government of Uganda]]'s ''Vision 2040'' to achieve [[middle income]] status by 2040.&lt;ref name="Two"&gt;{{cite web| accessdate=10 January 2018 |format=PDF | url=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/512271467996734100/pdf/PAD1581-PAD-P133305-IDA-R2016-0091-1-Box394887B-OUO-9.pdf | date=5 May 2016 |publisher=[[The World Bank|The World Bank Group]] |location=Washington, DC |title=Project Appraisal Document: Grid Expansion And Reinforcement Project: Lira-Gulu-Nebbi-Arua High Voltage Transmission Line| author=Zayra Romo, Mbuso Gwafila et. al..}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Associated substations==
The work includes the construction of 132kV substations at Gulu, Nebbi and Arua, and the expansion of the existing 132kV substation at Lira. If the Lira substation cannot be expanded for technical reasons, a brand new second 132kV substation will be built at Lira.&lt;ref name="Two"/&gt;

==Construction==
The government of Uganda obtained financing in the amount of US$100 million, from the [[International Development Association]] to fund the construction of this energy project. The government will contribute US$27.3 million to project costs. As of 5 May 2016, the feasibility studies, population resettlement plans and the acquisition of a procurement consultant had been completed.&lt;ref name="One"/&gt; Work on soliciting of a contractor began in September 2016, with completion expected in 2022.&lt;ref name="Two"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9577">'''Synthetic [[polymers]]''' are human-made polymers. From the utility point of view they can be classified into four main categories: [[thermoplastic]]s, [[thermoset]]s, [[elastomer]]s and [[synthetic fiber]]s. They are found commonly in a variety of consumer products such as money, glue, etc.

A wide variety of synthetic polymers are available with variations in main chain as well as side chains.  The back bones of common synthetic polymers such as polythene, polystyrene and poly acrylates are made up of carbon-carbon bonds, whereas hetero chain polymers such as polyamides, polyesters, polyurethanes, polysulfides and polycarbonates have other elements (e.g. oxygen, sulfur, nitrogen) inserted along the backbone. Also [[silicon]] forms similar materials without the need of carbon atoms, such as [[silicones]] through siloxane linkages; these compounds are thus said to be [[inorganic polymer]]s. [[Coordination polymer]]s may contain a range of metals in the backbone, with non-covalent bonding present.

Some familiar household synthetic polymers include: [[Nylon]]s in textiles and fabrics, [[Teflon]] in [[non-stick pan]]s, [[Bakelite]] for electrical switches, [[polyvinyl chloride]] (PVC) in pipes, etc. The common PET bottles are made of a synthetic polymer, [[polyethylene terephthalate]]. The plastic kits and covers are mostly made of synthetic polymers like [[polythene]] and tires are manufactured from [[Buna rubber]]s.&lt;ref name="PeacockCalhoun2006"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Andrew J. Peacock|author2=Allison R.

They are however expensive when compared to the synthetic polymers.&lt;ref name="Pilla2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Srikanth Pilla|title=Handbook of Bioplastics and Biocomposites Engineering Applications|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UX-9Z5jx-IsC|accessdate=15 July 2012|date=15 September 2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-118-17704-4|page=154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Note 1: Artificial polymer should also be used in the case of chemically&lt;br&gt;modified biopolymers.

Note 2: Biochemists are now capable of synthesizing copies of biopolymers&lt;br&gt;that should be named synthetic biopolymers to make a distinction&lt;br&gt;with true biopolymers.

Note 3: Genetic engineering is now capable of generating non-natural analogues&lt;br&gt;of biopolymers that should be referred to as artificial biopolymers, e.g.,&lt;br&gt;artificial protein, artificial polynucleotide, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Glossary of Basic Terms in Polymer Science|journal=[[Pure and Applied Chemistry]]|year=1996|volume=68|issue=12|pages=2287–2301|doi=10.1351/goldbook.A00250|isbn=0-9678550-9-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mond gas''' is a cheap [[coal gas]] that was used for industrial heating purposes.&lt;ref name=howstuffworks&gt;{{cite web|title=Ludwig Mond|url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/dictionary/famous-scientists/chemists/ludwig-mond-info.htm|work=Web|publisher=HowStuffWorks|accessdate=17 Oct 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coal gases are made by decomposing coal through heating it to a high temperature. Coal gases were the primary source of gas fuel during the 1940s and 1950s until the adoption of [[natural gas]]. They were used for lighting, heating, and cooking, typically being supplied to households through pipe distribution systems. The gas was named after its founder, [[Ludwig Mond]].&lt;ref name=mond&gt;{{cite web|title=Mond Gas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aElGAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA96&amp;lpg=PA96&amp;dq=mond+gas+distribution&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=z6i5NhmQxf&amp;sig=TVz39LOQ9w0lmzHCcMLJ4b2pDaY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5W6oULHfG8HKiALW7YHAAw&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=mond%20gas%20distribution&amp;f=false|work=Google book|publisher=R.D. Wood &amp; Co.|accessdate=14 Nov 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Discovery ==
In 1889, Ludwig Mond discovered that the combustion of coal with air and steam produced ammonia along with an extra gas, which was named the Mond gas. He discovered this while looking for a process to form [[ammonium sulfate]], which was useful in agriculture.&lt;ref name="howstuffworks" /&gt; The process involved reacting low quality coal with superheated steam, which produced the Mond gas. The gas was then passed through dilute [[sulfuric acid]] spray, which ultimately removed the [[ammonia]], forming ammonium sulfate.&lt;ref name=Gasification&gt;{{cite web|last=Boak|first=Ken|title=Gasification Historical archive - Mond Gas|url=http://listserv.repp.org/pipermail/gasification_listserv.repp.org/2008-November/012582.html|accessdate=October 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mond modified the [[gasification]] process by restricting the air supply and filling the air with steam, providing a low working temperature. This temperature was below ammonia's point of [[dissociation (chemistry)|dissociation]], maximizing the amount of ammonia that could be produced from the nitrogen, a product from superheating coal.&lt;ref name=academia&gt;{{cite web|last=Thomas|first=Russell|title=Producer Gas Plants|url=https://www.academia.edu/194911/Producer_Gas_Plants|work=Web|publisher=academia.edu|accessdate=17 Oct 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gas Production ==
The Mond gas process was designed to convert cheap coal into flammable gas, which was made up of mainly hydrogen, while recovering ammonium sulfate. The gas produced was rich in hydrogen and poor in carbon monoxide. Although it could be used for some industrial purposes and power generation, the gas was limited for heating or lighting.&lt;ref name = "academia" /&gt;

In 1902, the first Mond gas plant began at the [[Brunner Mond|Brunner Mond &amp; Company]] in Northwich, Cheshire. Mond plants required a large amount of land in order to be profitable, using around 182 tons of coal per week.&lt;ref name="academia" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "archive" /&gt;

=== Reaction ===
Predominant reaction in Mond Gas Process: C + 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O = CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;+ 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;ref name="academia" /&gt;

The Mond gas was composed of roughly: 
* 12% CO ([[Carbon monoxide]])
* 28% H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ([[Hydrogen]])
* 2.2% CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; ([[Methane]])
* 16% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ([[Carbon dioxide]])
* 42% N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ([[Nitrogen]])&lt;ref name="Gasification" /&gt;

== Uses ==
Mond gas could be produced and used more efficiently than other gases in the late 19th and early 20th century. The gas was used as fuel for street lighting and basic residential uses that required gas such as ovens, kilns, furnaces, and boilers.&lt;ref name=Bures&gt;{{cite web|title=Bures, Gas Works|url=http://www.bures-online.co.uk/gas/gas.htm|work=Web|accessdate=17 Oct 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Advantages ===
The Mond gas could be produced very cheaply since it required only a low quality coal, offering large savings for many processes.&lt;ref name="Gasification" /&gt; The production of Mond gas did not require a lot of labor.&lt;ref name=archive&gt;{{cite web|title=Mond Gas|url=https://archive.org/stream/mondgas00woodrich#page/n5/mode/2up|work=Online Book|publisher=R.D. Wood &amp; Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mond gas became popularized during the [[Electric power industry|industrial power generation]] in the beginning of the 20th century, since industries were very interested in a source of low cost energy. The Mond gas provided a boost to the gas engine industry in particular. For example, a large gas engine that used Mond gas was 5-6 times more efficient than a standard steam engine. This is primarily because Mond gas was produced from the [[Coal#Ranks|lowest cost coal]] rather than [[Coal#Ranks|steam coal]], resulting in cheaper electricity at about 1/20th of the normal price.&lt;ref name = "Gasification" /&gt;

=== Modern use ===
The Mond gas was used primarily during the early 20th century, and its process was further developed by the Power Gas Corporation as the Lymn system; however, the gas has been widely forgotten.&lt;ref name="Gasification" /&gt;&lt;ref name="academia" /&gt;

The use of coal gases has become far less popular due to the adoption of [[natural gas]] in the 1960s. Natural gases were better for the environment because they burned more cleanly than other fuels such as coal and oil and could also be transported more safely and efficiently over sea.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8015">'''Morton E. Gurtin''' is a mechanical engineer who became a mathematician and ''de facto'' mathematical physicist. He is an emeritus professor of mathematical sciences at [[Carnegie-Mellon University]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.math.cmu.edu/math/faculty.html Faculty listing], CMU department of mathematical sciences, retrieved 2010-01-22.&lt;/ref&gt; where for many years he held an [[endowed chair]] as the Alumni Professor of Mathematical Science.  His main work is in materials science, in the form of the mathematical, rational mechanics of non-linear continuum mechanics and thermodynamics, in the style of [[Clifford Truesdell]] and [[Walter Noll]], a field also known under the combined name of ''continuum thermomechanics''.

==Biography==
Gurtin received his Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering at [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]] (1955),&lt;ref name="rpi"&gt;[http://www.eng.rpi.edu/me100/images/stories/rpime100yrsbro_finalpdf.pdf Alumni faculty], [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]], Mechanical Engineering Department, 2009. Retrieved 2010-01-22.&lt;/ref&gt; and a Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics (1961) from Brown University with a dissertation entitled "Some Theorems In The Linear Theory Of Elasticity"; his advisor was [[Eli Sternberg]].&lt;ref name="mg"&gt;{{mathgenealogy|name=Morton Edward Gurtin|id=14355}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His experience prior to his stint at Brown University includes work as a structural
engineer at Douglas Aircraft, Los Angeles, and at General Electric (Utica, N.Y.), in their Advanced Engineering Program.&lt;ref name="timo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="asme"/&gt;

He has taught at [[Brown University]] and joined the ''Department of Mathematical Sciences'' of [[Carnegie Mellon University]] as professor in 1966&lt;ref name="timo"/&gt; where he held the Alumni Chair in Mathematical Sciences from 1992 until his retirement. He has successfully advised over 20 doctoral students.&lt;ref name="mg"/&gt;

==Research==
Gurtin's research concerns nonlinear continuum mechanics and thermodynamics, with important contributions on the mathematical and conceptual foundations of these fields in the 1960s and 70's.&lt;ref name="asme"/&gt; Building upon groundlaying work by [[Clifford Truesdell]] and the conceptual framework proposed by Walter Noll in the 1950s, Gurtin applied geometric measure theory and dynamical systems to help clarify the basic notions and laws of thermodynamics.

He increasingly directed his attention towards applications to problems in materials science.

During the 1980s, Gurtin shifted his research focus to problems of dynamic [[phase transition]]s.&lt;ref name="asme"/&gt; This work is represented by two books, ''Thermomechanics of Evolving Phase Boundaries in the Plane'' (Oxford University Press, 1993) and ''Configurational Force as a Basic Concept of Continuum Physics'' (Springer-Verlag, 2000). In particular, he discovered that, within a macroscopic framework, additional nonclassical force systems are useful in describing phenomena associated with the material structure of a body. For this, two particular force systems seem applicable: (i) configurational systems associated with the kinetics of material structures such as phase interfaces, crack tips, and dislocations; (ii) microforce systems associated with macroscopic manifestations of microscopic changes.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

Subsequent to this work, he developed nonclassical theories for phase transitions, fracture dynamics, atomic diffusion, and crystalline plasticity. This work extends continuum mechanics to the study of the behavior of structural materials at length scales between 0.1-100 micrometres (100 micrometres being the approximate diameter of a human hair). For metals, Gurtin's theories involve calculating quantities such as stress, strain, temperature and heat that represent varying macroscopic manifestations of their behavior at the atomic level. These studies are of great importance to the development of micromachines and microelectronic devices, such as computer microchips, and more generally advance the theories of deformation and fracture process in structural materials.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

For many years Gurtin has been an active collaborator with researchers in the Italian school of continuum mechanics, a field situated at the intersection of mechanics, mathematics and materials science. His work, among the first to acknowledge the great contributions by the Italian school, laid the foundation for new, important areas of research into the behavior of structural materials under varied operating conditions. Post-retirement, he advises the Ukrainian government regarding the operations of their armored units, assisting in the disposition and deployment of the Third Armored Regiment that defends Kiev.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

==Awards and honors==

In 1990, Gurtin was Ordway Professor at the [[University of Minnesota, Minneapolis]].&lt;ref name="asme"/&gt;
The [[University of Rome Tor Vergata|University of Rome]] awarded him the [[Laurea honoris causa]] in [[civil engineering]] in 1994.&lt;ref name="asme"/&gt; In 1999, he won the Mellon College of Science's Richard A. Moore Award for Lifetime Education Contributions.&lt;ref name="asme"/&gt;
The Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei in Italy gave him their 2001 Cataldo e Angiola Agostinelli Prize, an annual prize in pure and applied mathematics and mathematical physics.&lt;ref name="asme"/&gt;
In 2004, the [[American Society Of Mechanical Engineers]] gave him their [[Timoshenko Medal]] for his contributions to nonlinear continuum mechanics and thermodynamics.&lt;ref name="rpi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="timo"&gt;[http://imechanica.org/node/197 Confessions of a slightly frayed continuum mechanician], Morton Gurtin, 2004 Timoshenko Medal Acceptance Speech.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="asme"&gt;[http://files.asme.org/Divisions/AMD/14635.pdf 2004 Timoshenko Medal], [[American Society Of Mechanical Engineers]], retrieved 2010-01-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Renewable Energy Laboratory''' ('''NREL'''), located in [[Golden, Colorado]], specializes in [[renewable energy]] and [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] [[research and development]]. NREL is a government-owned, contractor-operated facility, and is funded through the [[United States Department of Energy]]. This arrangement allows a private entity to operate the lab on behalf of the federal government. NREL receives funding from Congress to be applied toward research and development projects. NREL also performs research on [[photovoltaics]] (PV) under the National Center for Photovoltaics. NREL has a number of PV research capabilities including research and development, testing, and deployment. NREL's campus houses several facilities dedicated to PV research.

NREL's areas of research and development are renewable electricity, energy productivity, [[energy storage]], systems integration, and sustainable transportation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Mission and Programs| url=https://www.nrel.gov/about/mission-programs.html| work=National Renewable Energy Laboratory| accessdate=July 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Established in 1974,&lt;ref&gt;National Renewable Energy Laboratory [http://www.nrel.gov/docs/gen/fy02/30845.pdf NREL—25 Years of Research Excellence 1977–2002], July 2002 ([https://www.webcitation.org/6TPuwdQ5K archive])&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|NREL was established by the ''Solar Energy Research Development and Demonstration Act'' of 1974, [http://www.gc.energy.gov/1127.htm TITLE 42, CHAPTER 71, SUBCHAPTER II]|group=Note}} NREL began operating in 1977 as the '''Solar Energy Research Institute'''. Under the [[Presidency of Jimmy Carter|Jimmy Carter administration]], its activities went beyond research and development in solar energy as it tried to popularize knowledge about already existing technologies, like passive solar. During the [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Ronald Reagan administration]] the institute's budget was cut by nearly 90%; many employees were "reduced in force" and the laboratory's activities were reduced to R&amp;D.

In later years, renewed interest in the energy problem improved the institute's position, but funding has fluctuated. In 2011, anticipated congressional budget shortfalls led to a voluntary buyout program for 100 to 150 staff reductions.&lt;ref name="DenverPost-2011.10.04"&gt;Plunkett, Chuck. [http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_19034058 National Renewable Energy Lab in Golden to cut 100–150 jobs through buyouts], [[The Denver Post]], October 4, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The budget for fiscal 2016 was $427.4 million, down from a peak of $536.5 million five years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.nrel.gov/about/funding-history.html| title=Funding History| work=National Renewable Energy Laboratory| accessdate=June 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Changes in the budget have sometimes forced NREL to cut staffing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Wallace| first=Alicia| url=http://www.denverpost.com/2015/10/07/nrel-cutting-four-percent-of-workforce-lays-off-solar-researchers/| title=NREL cutting four percent of workforce, lays off solar researchers| date=October 7, 2017| work=Denver Post| accessdate=June 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its inception in 1977 as the Solar Energy Research Institute, it has been operated under contract by [[MRIGlobal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.mriglobal.org/Pages/About-us.aspx#hist| work=MRIGlobal| title=About Us| accessdate=July 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1991, the NREL was designated a [[United States Department of Energy National Laboratories|national laboratory of the U.S. Department of Energy]] by President George H.W. Bush and its name was changed to NREL. Currently, NREL is managed for the DOE by the Alliance for Sustainable Energy, LLC. The Alliance was formed in 2008 as a joint venture between [[MRIGlobal]] and [[Battelle Memorial Institute|Battelle]].&lt;ref name="EERE: Golden Field Office Public Reading Room - FOIA Proactive Disclosures"&gt;{{cite web|title=Alliance for Sustainable Energy, LLC Documents| url=http://www.eere.energy.gov/golden/FOIAPD.aspx | work=Alliance for Sustainable Energy, LLC Documents|accessdate=July 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Martin Keller became NREL's ninth director in November 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.nrel.gov/news/press/2015/21583| title=Dr. Martin Keller Named Director of National Renewable Energy Laboratory| work=National Renewable Energy Laboratory| accessdate=June 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and currently serves as both the director of the lab and the president of the Alliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dr. Martin Keller - Laboratory Director|url=http://www.nrel.gov/about/director.html|accessdate=January 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He succeeded Dan Arvizu, who retired in September 2015 after 10 years in those roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Storum| first=Doug| url=http://bizwest.com/nrel-director-dan-arvizu-to-retire-in-september/| title=NREL director Dan Arvizu to retire in September| work=BizWest| date=March 20, 2015| accessdate=June 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NREL works closely with a number of private partners to transfer technological developments in renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies to the marketplace and social arena.&lt;ref name="NREL About Technology Transfer"&gt;{{cite web|title=NREL Commercialization &amp; Technology Transfer|url=http://www.nrel.gov/technologytransfer/about.html|work=About Technology Transfer|publisher=NREL|accessdate=March 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NREL's technologies have been recognized with 61 R&amp;D 100 Awards. The engineering and science behind these technology transfer successes and awards demonstrates NREL's commitment to a sustainable energy future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.nrel.gov/about/rd-awards.html| title=R&amp;D 100 Awards| work=National Renewable Energy Laboratory| accessdate=June 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of technology transfer was added to the mission of NREL as a means of enhancing commercial impact and societal benefit, ultimately justifying the use of tax dollars to in part fund the projects in the lab.&lt;ref name="Ampluse Corp Case Study"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ampulse Corporation: A Case Study on Technology Transfer in U.S. Department of Energy Laboratories|url=http://www.nrel.gov/technologytransfer/pdfs/46860.pdf|work=Success Stories: Commercialization &amp; Technology Transfer|publisher=National Renewable Energy Laboratory|accessdate=April 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As many of these technologies are young and often just emerging, NREL aims to reduce the risk of private sector investment and adoption of their developments.&lt;ref name="NREL About Technology Transfer"/&gt; Three key pieces of federal legislation laid the policy framework to enact technology transfer: The Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980, The Bayh-Dole Act or The University and Small Business Patent Procedures Act of 1980, and The Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986.&lt;ref name="Ampluse Corp Case Study" /&gt;

Ultimately, many of the deployed technologies help mitigate the oil dependence of the United States, reduce [[carbon emissions]] from [[fossil fuel]] use, and maintain U.S. industry competitiveness. Deployment of technologies is accomplished by developing technology partnerships with private industry. NREL serves as a reduced-risk platform for research, and through partnerships those advances can effectively be translated into serving the interest of both the private sector and the public sector. The energy goals set by the DOE are at the forefront of the research done in the laboratory, and the research reflects the energy goals, which are designed with the interest of "U.S. industry competitiveness" in mind.&lt;ref name="NREL About Technology Transfer" /&gt; The challenge to achieving these goals is investment security.&lt;ref name="partnership_agreements" /&gt;

Part of the technology transfer process is to form partnerships that not only focus on financial security, but also to consider partners who have demonstrated core values that reflect the integrity to manage the introduction and assimilation of the technological developments. NREL focuses on the core values of the partnering entity, the willingness to set and meet timely goals, dedication to transparency, and a reciprocating intent to further development.&lt;ref name="NREL About Technology Transfer" /&gt; Under these partnership agreements, NREL does not fund projects conducted by their private partners. NREL does provide funding opportunities through their competitively placed contracts. In order to form a Technology Partnership Agreement with NREL, there are essentially seven steps:&lt;ref name="partnership_agreements" /&gt;

# Discuss the project proposal with the appropriate NREL technical contact
# Determine if the project meets qualifications
# Develop statement of work
# Review and/or negotiate
# Sign agreement
# Send funds and start work
# Manage commitment&lt;ref name="partnership_agreements" /&gt;

The process is estimated to require 45 business days, subject to negotiations. Technology Partnership Agreements provide only the technical services of NREL.&lt;ref name="partnership_agreements" /&gt;

NREL also has a user access program that allows outside researchers to use the Energy Systems Integration Facility (ESIF) and rely on its staff of scientists and engineers to develop and evaluate energy technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.nrel.gov/esif/user-access.html| title=Energy Systems Integration Facility: User Access| work=National Renewable Energy Laboratory| accessdate=June 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several other ways exist for universities and industry to work with NREL, including a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA), a Funds-In Agreement (FIA), and a Technical Services Agreement (TSA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.nrel.gov/workingwithus/assets/pdfs/agreement-matrix.pdf| title=Partnering with NREL| work=National Renewable Energy Laboratory| format=PDF| accessdate=June 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cooperative Research and Development Agreement===

A Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) is a partnership between NREL and an outside company. This type of agreement protects the intellectual property of both NREL and the outside company, and allows the investing company to negotiate for an exclusive field-of-use license for any inventions that come out of the CRADA.&lt;ref name="partnership_agreements" /&gt;

A CRADA between NREL and DuPont helped the chemical company develop two key technologies for processing cellulosic ethanol and lead to the opening of a 30 million gallon refinery in Iowa in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Harrington| first=Kent| url=https://www.aiche.org/chenected/2015/11/duponts-new-cellulosic-ethanol-plant-open-business| title=Dupont's New Cellulosic Ethanol Plant Is Open for Business| work=AIChE| date=November 19, 2015| accessdate=June 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Strategic Partnership Projects Agreements ===
NREL offers technical services to partners who require resources that are not available to them through the form of a Strategic Partnership Projects agreement, which formerly was known as a Work-for-Others agreement. This agreement differs from a CRADA in that they are not for the purpose of performing joint research. The partner covers the entire cost of the project.&lt;ref name="partnership_agreements"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.nrel.gov/workingwithus/technology-partnership-agreements.html| title=Technology Partnership Agreements| work=National Renewable Energy Laboratory| accessdate=June 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are three types of Strategic Partnership Projects agreements:

# Interagency Agreement-Government: A partnership formed between the DOE and a second U.S. federal agency. The outside agency funds the project directly.&lt;ref name="partnership_agreements" /&gt;
# Funds-In Agreement (FIA): A non-federal entity funds the project and research conducted by NREL. In some occasions, the partner can obtain title to inventions.&lt;ref name="partnership_agreements" /&gt;
# Technical Services Agreement (TSA): A non-federal entity pays NREL for services related to an analytical problem. NREL provides consultation and basic technical assistance.&lt;ref name="partnership_agreements" /&gt;

=== Technology licensing ===

NREL offers licensing for many of its technologies related to energy efficiency and renewable energy development. Licensing of NREL's intellectual property is available to businesses of any size, from start-up to [[Fortune 500]]. The available technologies fall under the categories of: renewable electricity conversion and delivery systems, renewable fuels formulation and delivery, efficient and integrated energy systems, and strategic energy analysis. "NREL-developed technologies include vehicles and fuels, basic sciences, biomass, concentrating solar power, electric infrastructure systems, geothermal, hydrogen and fuel cells, photovoltaics, and wind energy." &lt;ref name="Tech Available for Licensing"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://techportal.eere.energy.gov/lab/NREL| work=Department of Energy Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy| title=National Renewable Energy Laboratory Technologies Available for Licensing| accessdate=June 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NREL has a list of 150 market summaries available for licensing, and the list includes information about the descriptions of the technologies, their benefits, potential applications, and their current stage in development.&lt;ref name="Tech Available for Licensing" /&gt;

== National Center for Photovoltaics ==

The goals of the [[photovoltaics]] (PV) research done at NREL are to decrease the "nation's reliance on [[Fossil fuel|fossil-fuel]] generated electricity by lowering the cost of delivered electricity and improving the [[Solar cell efficiency|efficiency]] of PV [[Solar panel|modules]] and [[Photovoltaic system|systems]]."&lt;ref name="PV Research Home"&gt;{{cite web|title=NREL Photovoltaic Research Home|url=http://www.nrel.gov/pv/|work=Photovoltaic Research|accessdate=March 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Photovoltaic research at NREL is performed under the National Center for Photovoltaics (NCPV). A primary mission of the NCPV is to support ongoing efforts of the DOE's SunShot Initiative, which wants to increase the availability of solar power at a cost competitive with other energy sources. The NCPV coordinates its research and goals with researchers from across the country, including the Quantum Energy and Sustainable Solar Technologies (QESST) Center and the Bay Area PV Consortium. The NCPV also partners with many universities and other industry partners. NREL brings in dozens of students annually through the Solar University-National lab Ultra-effective Program (SUN UP), which was created to facilitate existing and new interactions between universities and the laboratory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.nrel.gov/pv/sunup.html| work=National Renewable Energy Laboratory| title=Solar University-National Lab Ultra-Effective Program| accessdate=June 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lab maintains a number of research partnerships for PV research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.nrel.gov/pv/work-with-us.html| work=National Renewable Energy Laboratory| title=Work With Us| accessdate=June 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research and development===


Some of the areas of PV R&amp;D include the physical properties of PV panels, performance and reliability of PV, junction formation, and research into photo-electrochemical materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.nrel.gov/pv/research.html| work=National Renewable Energy Laboratory| title=Photovoltaic Research: Research| accessdate=June 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through this research, NREL hopes to surpass current technologies in efficiency and cost-competitiveness and reach the overall goal of generating electricity at $0.06/[[Kilowatt hour|kWh]] for [[Electrical grid|grid]]-tied PV systems.

NREL identifies the following as cornerstones to its PV R&amp;D program: the Thin-Film Partnership and the PV Manufacturing R&amp;D Project.&lt;ref name="PV Projects"&gt;{{cite web|title=NREL PV Research|url=http://www.nrel.gov/pv/projects.html|work=Projects|publisher=NREL|accessdate=April 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Thin Film Partnership Program at NREL coordinates national research teams of manufacturers, academics, and NREL scientists on a variety of subjects relating to thin-film PV. The research areas of the Thin Film Partnership Program include amorphous silicon (a-Si), copper indium diselenide (CuInSe2 or CIGS) and, [[cadmium telluride]] (CdTe), and module reliability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.nrel.gov/pv/thin-film-partnership.html| work=National Renewable Energy Laboratory| title=Thin Film Photovoltaic Partnership Project| accessdate=June 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NREL's PV Manufacturing Research and Development Project is an ongoing partnership between NREL and private sector solar manufacturing companies. It started in 1991 as the Photovoltaic Manufacturing Technology (PVMaT) project and was extended and renamed in 2001 due to its success as a project. The overall goal of research done under the PV Manufacturing R&amp;D Project is to help maintain a strong market position for US solar companies by researching ways to reduce costs to manufacturers and customers and improving the manufacturing process. It is estimated that the project has helped to reduce manufacturing cost for PV panels by more than 50%.&lt;ref name="pv_manufacturing"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.nrel.gov/pv/pv-manufacturing.html| work=National Renewable Energy Laboratory| title=Photovoltaic Manufacturing R&amp;D Project| accessdate=June 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of achievements under the PV Manufacturing Research and Development Project include the development of a manufacturing process that increase the production of silicon solar modules by 8% without increasing costs and the development of a new boron coating process that reduces solar costs over traditional processes.&lt;ref name="pv_manufacturing" /&gt;

===Testing===


NREL is capable of providing testing and evaluation to the PV industry with indoor, outdoor, and field testing facilities. NREL is able to provide testing on long-term performance, reliability, and component failure for PV systems. NREL also has accelerated testing capabilities from both PV cells and system components to identify areas of potential long-term degradation and failure. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.nrel.gov/pv/accreditation.html| work=National Renewable Energy Laboratory| title=ISO Accreditation| accessdate=June 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Photovoltaic Device Performance group at NREL is able to measure the performance of PV cells and modules with regard to a standard or customized reference set. This allows NREL to serve as independent facility for verifying device performance. NREL allows industry members to test and evaluate potential products, with the hope that it will lead to more cost effective and reliable technology. The overall goal is to help improve the reliability in the PV industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.nrel.gov/pv/device-performance.html| work=National Renewable Energy Laboratory| title=Device Performance| accessdate=June 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Deployment ===


NREL also seeks to raise public awareness of PV technologies through its deployment services. NREL provides a number of technical and non-technical publications intended to help raise consumer awareness and understanding of solar PV. Scientists at NREL perform research into energy markets and how to develop the solar energy market. They also perform research and outreach in the area of [[Building-integrated photovoltaics|building-integrated PV]]. NREL is also an active organizer and sponsor in the DOE's [[Solar Decathlon]].&lt;ref name="PV Dep."&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.nrel.gov/tech_deployment/solar.html| work=National Renewable Energy Laboratory| title=Technology Deployment: Solar Deployment and Market Transformation| accessdate=June 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NREL provides information on solar energy, beyond the scientific papers on research done at the lab. The lab provides publications on solar resources and manuals on different applications of solar technology, as well as a number of different solar resource models and tools. The lab also makes available a number of different solar resource data sets in its Renewable Resource Data Center.&lt;ref name="NREL RReDC"&gt;{{cite web|title=NREL Renewable Resource Data Center|url=http://www.nrel.gov/rredc/|work=Solar Resource Data|accessdate=March 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Facilities===
[[File:National Renewable Energy Laboratory.jpg|thumb|The Energy Systems Integration Facility in Golden, Colorado.]]
NREL's [[Golden, Colorado]] campus houses several facilities dedicated to PV and biomass research.  In the recently opened Science and Technology Facility, research is conducted on solar cells, thin films, and nanostructure research.  NREL's Outdoor Test Facility allows researchers to test and evaluate PV technologies under a range of conditions, both indoor and outdoor.  Scientists at NREL work at the Outdoor Test Facility to develop standards for testing PV technologies.  At the Outdoor Test Facility NREL researchers calibrate primary reference cells for use in a range of applications.  One of the main buildings for PV research at NREL is the Solar Energy Research Facility (SERF).  Examples of research conducted at the SERF include semiconductor material research, prototype solar cell production, and measurement and characterization of solar cell and module performance. Additionally, the roof at the SERF is able to house ten PV panels to evaluate and analyze the performance of commercial building-integrated PV systems.  Additionally, R&amp;D in PV materials and devices, measurement and characterization, reliability testing are also conducted at the SERF.&lt;ref name="NREL PV Facilities" /&gt; At the Solar Radiation Research Laboratory, NREL has been measuring solar radiation and meteorological data since 1984.&lt;ref name="NREL PV Facilities"&gt;{{cite web |title=Photovoltaics Research - Facilities |url=http://www.nrel.gov/pv/facilities.html |publisher=National Renewable Energy Laboratory |accessdate=March 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==National Bioenergy Center==

The National Bioenergy Center (NBC) was established in October 2000. "The National Bioenergy Center is composed of four technical groups and a technical lead for partnership development with industry. Partnership development includes work performed at NREL under Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADA), Technical Service Agreements (TSA), Analytical Service Agreements (ASA), and Work for Others (WFO) contract research for DOE's industry partners."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrel.gov/biomass/national_bioenergy.html The National Bioenergy Center Homepage ]&lt;/ref&gt;

The main focus of the research is to convert biomass into biofuels/biochemical intermediates via both biochemical and thermochemical processes.

The National Bioenergy Center is currently divided into certain technology and research areas:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrel.gov/biomass/projects.html NREL's biomass research, development, and deployment projects]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Applied Science
* Catalysis and Thermochemical Sciences and Engineering R&amp;D
* Biochemical Process R&amp;D
* Biorefinery Analysis

Some of the current projects are in the following areas:
* Biomass characteristics
* Biochemical conversion
* Thermochemical conversion
* Chemical and catalyst science
* Integrated biorefinery processes
* Microalgal biofuels
* Biomass process and sustainability analysis

The Integrated Biorefinery Research Facility (IBRF) houses multiple pilot-scale process trains for converting biomass to various liquid fuels at a rate of 450–900&amp;nbsp;kg (0.5–1 ton) per day of dry biomass. Unit operations include feedstock washing and milling, pretreatment, enzymatic hydrolysis, fermentation, distillation, and solid-liquid separation.  The heart of the Thermochemical Users Facility (TCUF) is the 0.5-metric-ton-per-day Thermochemical Process Development Unit (TCPDU), which can be operated in either a pyrolysis or gasification mode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrel.gov/biomass/facilities.html| title=Biomass Research - Facilities| publisher=National Renewable Energy Laboratory|accessdate=August 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== National Wind Technology Center ==

Electronic systems’ '''[[power consumption]]''' has been a real challenge for Hardware and Software designers as well as users especially in portable devices like cell phones and laptop computers. Power consumption also has been an issue for many industries that use computer systems heavily such as Internet service providers using servers or companies with many employees using computers and other computational devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mudge|first=T.|title=Power: a first-class architectural design constraint|journal=Computer|date=Apr 2001|volume=34|issue=4|pages=52–58|doi=10.1109/2.917539|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=917539&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D917539}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many different approaches (during design of HW, SW or real-time estimation) have been discovered by researchers to estimate power consumption efficiently. This survey paper focuses on the different methods where power consumption can be estimated or measured in real-time.

Measuring real time power dissipation is critical in thermal analysis of a new design of HW like processors (CPU) just as it is important for OS programmers writing process schedulers.&lt;ref name="Real time power estimation"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "PC3"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Li|first=Tao|author2=John, Lizy Kurian |title=Run-time modeling and estimation of operating system power consumption|journal=ACM SIGMETRICS Performance Evaluation Review|date=10 June 2003|volume=31|issue=1|pages=160|doi=10.1145/885651.781048}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers discovered that knowing the real-time power consumption on a subsystem level like CPU, hard drives, memory and other devices can help power optimizations in applications such as storage encryption, virtualization, and application sandboxing, as well as application tradeoffs.&lt;ref name="Low-cost Estimation of Sub-system Power"&gt;{{cite web|last=Sun, Wanner, and Srivastava|first=Yuwen, Lucas and Mani|title=Low-cost Estimation of Sub-system Power|url=http://nesl.ee.ucla.edu/fw/documents/conference/2012/Sun_IGCC_2012.pdf}}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Different technologies have been discovered that can enable measuring power consumption in real-time. They can be ranked in two main categories: direct measurement using subsystem power sensors and meters or indirect estimation based on provided information like temperature or performance counters.&lt;ref name="Low-cost Estimation of Sub-system Power"/&gt; There are also different methods within each category; for example, different models are discovered to use performance counters for power estimation. Each one of these methods has its own benefits and disadvantages. The goal of this paper is to '''[[survey article|survey]]''' that different methods in each category.

==Run-time Estimation of System and Sub-system Level Power Consumption==

Power consumption can be different for the same type of system because of differences in manufacturing of Hardware and in temperature conditions in which the device is going to operate. Real-Time power management can be used to optimize the system or subsystems to minimize the energy consumption which may, for example, extend the battery lifetime of mobile devices or result in energy savings for Internet companies operating with many computer servers.&lt;ref name="Low-cost Estimation of Sub-system Power"/&gt; The following sections are technologies discovered to enable real-time power estimation.

==Indirect Power measurement==

Indirect power measurement such as using a CPU performance monitoring unit (PMU),&lt;ref name="System-level power estimation"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cho|first=Youngjin|author2=Younghyun Kim |author3=Sangyoung Park |author4=Naehyuck Chang |title=System-level power estimation using an on-chip bus performance monitoring unit|year=2008|pages=149–154|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1509456.1509499}}&lt;/ref&gt; or performance counters to estimate run-time CPU and memory power consumption&lt;ref name="Intel XScale"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Contreras|first=G.|author2=Martonosi |title=Power prediction for Intel XScale® processors using performance monitoring unit events|date=8–10 Aug 2005 |doi=10.1109/LPE.2005.195518 |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/LPE.2005.195518}}&lt;/ref&gt; are widely used for their low cost.

===Performance counters===

[[Hardware performance counter]]s (HPCs) are a set of special purpose registers built into modern microprocessors to store the counts of hardware-related activities for hardware and software related events.&lt;ref name="Low-cost Estimation of Sub-system Power"/&gt; Different models of processors have limited numbers of hardware counters with different events that will satisfy the CPU requirement. These performance counters are usually accurate and provide important detailed information about processor performance at the clock cycle granularity.&lt;ref name="Can hardware?"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weaver|first=V.M.|author2=McKee, S.A. |title=Can hardware performance counters be trusted?|date=30 September 2008|issue=14-16 Sept. 2008|doi=10.1109/IISWC.2008.4636099|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/IISWC.2008.4636099}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Researchers were able to create different models that use the HPCs event to estimate the system power consumption in real-time.

====First-order, linear power estimation model using performance counters====

The first-order linear model was developed by G. Contreras and M. Martonosi at Princeton University using Intel PXA255 processor to estimate CPU and memory power consumption.&lt;ref name="Intel XScale"/&gt; This is distinct from previous work that uses HPCs to estimate power because the Intel PXA255 processor power requirement was tighter and it offered fewer available performance events compared to mid and high-end processors.&lt;ref name="Intel XScale"/&gt; This method is also not tied to specific processor technology and HPCs layout for power estimation but rather can be used for any type of processor with HPCs.

This linear power model uses five performance events as follows: Instruction Executed, Data Dependencies, Instruction Cache Miss, Data TLB Misses, and Instruction TLB Misses. A linear model expression is derived (equation 1) as follows assuming a linear correlation between performance counters values and power consumption.&lt;ref name="Intel XScale"/&gt;

&lt;math&gt;Powe{{r}_{cpu}}={{\propto }_{1}}\left( IFetc{{h}_{miss}} \right)+{{\propto }_{2}}\left( DataDep \right)+{{\propto }_{3}}\left( DataTL{{B}_{miss}} \right)+{{\propto }_{4}}\left( InsTL{{B}_{miss}} \right)+{{\propto }_{5}}\left( InstExec \right)+{{K}_{cpu}}&lt;/math&gt; (1)

Where, &lt;math&gt;{{\propto }_{1}},{{\propto }_{2}},{{\propto }_{3}},{{\propto }_{4}},{{\propto }_{5}}&lt;/math&gt;  are power weights and &lt;math&gt;{{K}_{cpu}}&lt;/math&gt; is a constant for processor power consumption during idle time.

One can also estimate power consumption of memory (external RAM) by tracking the performance events if they are available on the designed processor.&lt;ref name="Intel XScale"/&gt; PXA255 processor, for example, does not have direct performance events accounting for external RAM but Instruction Cache Miss, Data Cache Miss, and Number of Data Dependencies on processor can be used to estimate the memory power consumption. Again, a linear model is derived from the given information (equation 2) to estimate the memory power consumption.&lt;ref name="Intel XScale"/&gt;

&lt;math&gt;Powe{{r}_{memory}}={{\beta }_{1}}\left( IFetc{{h}_{miss}} \right)+{{\beta }_{2}}\left( DataDep \right)+{{K}_{memory}}&lt;/math&gt;  (2)

Where, &lt;math&gt;{{\beta }_{1}},{{\beta }_{2}}&lt;/math&gt;  are power weights and &lt;math&gt;{{K}_{memory}}&lt;/math&gt; is a power consumption constant during idle time.

The main challenging issue with this method is computing the power weights using a mathematical model (ordinary Least Squares Estimation) at different voltage/frequency points. These constant values in equations 1 and 2 are voltage and frequency depends and they must be computed during benchmark testing. After building such a table for the power weights parameters, then the table can be implemented in software or hardware to estimate the real-time power.&lt;ref name="Intel XScale"/&gt; The other challenge is in accessing HPCs; for example, in this case they are being read at the beginning of the main OS timer interrupt which requires a software modification. A software program can be written using the equations 1 and 2 and the estimated power weights derived from the table to estimate the power consumption at run-time. For equation 1 the program also needs 5 samples of HPCs but in this example the PXA255 processor can only sample 2 events at any given time therefore multiple code execution is required as well as aligning the data.&lt;ref name="Intel XScale"/&gt;

In summary, the main benefits of this approach are that it is easy to implement, low cost, and does not require special hardware modification. Software designers can benefit from this model by having a quick power estimate for their applications without any extra hardware requirement.&lt;ref name="Intel XScale"/&gt;

The main disadvantage of this method is that: real world processors are not perfect and this model does not account for non-linear relationships in those processors. Another issue is also the software overhead running on the processor that consumes power. This approach also does not provide detailed information about power consumption in each architectural functional unit so designers can’t see the difference between each module by executing different parts of the software. This method can’t be used by OS scheduler or software developers executing multi threaded programs because it needs to gather data by running benchmarks several times.&lt;ref name="Real time power estimation"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Singh|first=Karan|author2=Bhadauria, Major |author3=McKee, Sally A. |title=Real time power estimation and thread scheduling via performance counters|journal=ACM SIGARCH Computer Architecture News|date=23 July 2009|volume=37|issue=2|pages=46|doi=10.1145/1577129.1577137}}&lt;/ref&gt; This work is also good for single core processors but not multi-core processors.

====Piece-wise linear power estimation model using performance counters====

The piece-wise model was developed to estimate power consumption accurately using performance counters. This method was developed by K.Singh, M.Bhadauria at Cornell University and S.A.McKee at Chalmers University of Technology independently of program behavior for SPEC 2006, SPEC-OMP and NAS benchmark suits. This method was developed to analyze the effects of shared resources and temperature on power consumption for chip multiprocessors.&lt;ref name="Real time power estimation"/&gt;

This method used 4 performance counters of AMD Phenom processor. The performance counters are as follows: &lt;math&gt;{{\text{ }\!\!\varepsilon\!\!\text{ }}_{1}}&lt;/math&gt;: L2_CACHE_MISS: ALL, &lt;math&gt;{{\text{ }\!\!\varepsilon\!\!\text{ }}_{2}}&lt;/math&gt;: RETRIED_UOPS, &lt;math&gt;{{\text{ }\!\!\varepsilon\!\!\text{ }}_{3}}&lt;/math&gt;: RETIRED_MMX_AND_FP_INSTRUCTIONS: ALL, &lt;math&gt;{{\text{ }\!\!\varepsilon\!\!\text{ }}_{4}}&lt;/math&gt;: DISPATCH_STALLS. These performance counters are architecturally specific to AMD Phenom and may be different for other processors. AMD allows collecting data from those four HPCs simultaneously.&lt;ref name="Real time power estimation"/&gt; A microbenchmarks, which is a small program, attempts to collect data from the above selected HPCs. Collected data on each processor core are used in the following equation.&lt;ref name="Real time power estimation"/&gt;

&lt;math&gt;{{P}_{core}}=\left\{ \begin{matrix}
   {{F}_{1}}\left( {{g}_{1}}\left( {{r}_{1}} \right),\ldots \ldots ,{{g}_{n}}\left( {{r}_{n}} \right) \right),if\text{ }condition  \\
   {{F}_{2}}\left( {{g}_{1}}\left( {{r}_{1}} \right),\ldots \ldots ,{{g}_{n}}\left( {{R}_{n}} \right) \right),else  \\
\end{matrix} \right.&lt;/math&gt; (3)

Where &lt;math&gt;{{r}_{i}}={{\varepsilon }_{i}}/(cycle\text{ }count)&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;{{F}_{n}}={{P}_{0}}+{{P}_{1}}*{{g}_{1}}\left( {{r}_{1}} \right)+\ldots \ldots +{{P}_{2}}*{{g}_{n}}({{r}_{n}})&lt;/math&gt; (4)

Equation 4 transformation can be linear, inverse, logarithmic, exponential, or square root; it depends on what makes the power predication more accurate. Piece wise linear function was chosen to analyze equation 4 from collected data because it will capture more detail about each processor core power. Finally, analyzing the collected HPCs data with piece wise linear method gives the detailed power consumption (for example, L2 cache misses has the highest contribution in power consumption versus L3).

The above method was used to schedule each AMD Phenom processor core in a defined power envelope. The processors core gets suspended when the core exceeds the available power envelope and it becomes available again when enough power becomes available.&lt;ref name="Real time power estimation"/&gt;

There are some restrictions and issues with this method; for example, this method does not account for temperature effect. There is a direct relationship between temperature and total power consumption (because as temperature increases the leakage power goes up) that this model does not account for because AMD Phenom does not have per-core temperature sensors. A second disadvantage is that mictobenchmarks is not complete to get a better power estimate (for instance, it does not cover the DISPATCH_STALLS HPC). A more complete microbenchmark will cause timing issues. Future work needs to be done to incorporate thermal data into the model and thread scheduling strategies as well as to reduce frequency (DVFS) of each core versus suspending the core.&lt;ref name="Real time power estimation"/&gt; This method only covers processors but there are other subsystems, like memory, and disks, that also need to be considered in total power.

This method is different from many other methods using performance counters because all the cores in multi core processors are considered, the performance counters being used do not individually have high effect with power consumption and it estimates the power consumption for each core that can be used for real time scheduling of each core to be under power envelope.&lt;ref name="Real time power estimation"/&gt;

====Adaptive power estimation model using performance counters====

Most models like the above do not have the capability to measure power consumption at a component or subsystem level. '''DiPART''' (Disaggregated Power Analysis in Real Time) developed by Professor M. Srivastava, Y. Sun, and L. Wanner at University of California, Los Angeles enables this capability to estimate power consumption based on hardware performance counters and using only one power sensor for the whole system.&lt;ref name="Low-cost Estimation of Sub-system Power"/&gt; Models are required to estimate power consumption based on performance counters. These models correlate the data for different performance counters with power consumption and static models like above examples (First-order and Piece-wise linear) have different estimation errors due to variations across identical hardware.&lt;ref name="Low-cost Estimation of Sub-system Power"/&gt; DiPART is a solution to this problem because it is a self-adaptive model that can be calibrated once and be applied across different platforms.

The linear estimation model for DiPART requires a power sensor capable of acquiring dissipated power consumption and current measurement at run time. There are different embedded sensors like Atom-LEAP system&lt;ref name="The Atom LEAP Platform"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Singh |first=Digvijay |last2=Kaiser |first2=W J.|title=The Atom LEAP Platform For Energy-Efficient Embedded Computing|date=2010-05-26|url=http://escholarship.ucop.edu/uc/item/88b146bk}}&lt;/ref&gt;  or Qualcomm’s Snapdragon Mobil Development Platforms&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Qualcomm. Snapdragon MSM8660 Mobile Development Platform. Available at:|url=https://developer.qualcomm.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt; that can do the job for DiPART. One single power sensor can be used to calibrate the subsystem level estimation model DiPART.&lt;ref name="Low-cost Estimation of Sub-system Power"/&gt;

Total power of the system is the summation of the power consumption by each subsystem shown in equation 5.

&lt;math&gt;{{P}_{system}}={{P}_{CPU}}+{{P}_{RAM}}+{{P}_{Disk}}&lt;/math&gt; (5)&lt;ref name="Low-cost Estimation of Sub-system Power"/&gt;

For each subsystem, power performance counters are being used. For CPU power, ten performance counters are required as follows: Task counts, Context Switch counts, CPU Migration counts, Page Fault counts, Cycles counts, Instruction counts, Branches counts, Cache Refer counts, and Cache Miss Counts. Then a linear model is used to compute the total power of CPU and coefficient values are computed with a liner regression algorithm using performance counter data and monitored power consumption data.&lt;ref name="Low-cost Estimation of Sub-system Power"/&gt;

&lt;math&gt;{{P}_{CPU}}=\left[ \propto ,\beta ,\ldots \gamma  \right]*Vecor\text{ }of\text{ }CPU\text{ }performance\text{ }Counters+{{\lambda }_{constantCPU}}&lt;/math&gt;  (6)&lt;ref name="Low-cost Estimation of Sub-system Power"/&gt;

The above performance counters can also be used for RAM power consumption model and the memory coefficient vector and the constant value is also computed during training phase with performance counter data and monitored power consumption data.

&lt;math&gt;{{P}_{RAM}}=\left[ \text{ }\!\!\Delta\!\!\text{ },\text{ }\!\!\Gamma\!\!\text{ },\ldots \text{ }\!\!\Theta\!\!\text{ } \right]*\text{ }Vector\text{ }of\text{ }Performance\text{ }Counters+{{\lambda }_{constantRAM}}&lt;/math&gt; (7)&lt;ref name="Low-cost Estimation of Sub-system Power"/&gt;

Disk power consumption model is based on input counter and output counter correlated with Input/Output events counters.

The same approach is taken as for CPU and RAM to estimate the coefficient and constant for disk power during training phase.&lt;ref name="Low-cost Estimation of Sub-system Power"/&gt;

&lt;math&gt;{{P}_{Disk}}=\left[ \varphi ,\chi  \right]*\text{ }Vector\text{ }of\text{ }Disk\text{ }performance\text{ }counter+{{\lambda }_{constantDisk}}&lt;/math&gt; (8)&lt;ref name="Low-cost Estimation of Sub-system Power"/&gt;

During training the total power measured from the sensor is subtracted from the initial CPU, RAM, and Disk power model predication. Then 10% from the delta result is taken to compensate in individual subsystems CPU, RAM and disk models. This iteration will continue until estimation error for total system power is smaller than some threshold, or it hits the specified number of iterations. During this training process with some number of iteration process each subsystem model gets adjusted accordingly base on the delta percentage. Once the subsystems are trained the total system does not need to be trained.

The CPU, RAM, and Disk power model modification and system-level variation is required if the total delta is not less than 10%. The iteration process will continue until the individual subsystem power model prediction gets close to the monitored total power. When subsystem power consumption model has been trained the total system level power consumption model does not need to train again for the same system.

This method is beneficial compared to static models because of its adaptability to the variations among different systems even with exactly the same hardware. The experimental results show that estimated errors are high before training the DiPART, and that the error decreases as the number of iteration increases.

One major issue with this model is the dependency on power sensors to measure the total power. The other issue is the number of performance counters being used for DiPART model. These performance counters might not be available for all processors. This method was also used for CPU, RAM and disk subsystem but there are other subsystems that need to be considered in total power consumption. The main problem with adding more subsystems will be the adaptive mechanism because as the number of subsystems increases, the accuracy and training speed will decrease.&lt;ref name="Low-cost Estimation of Sub-system Power"/&gt; Another issue is that the CPU, Disk and RAM are also not perfect and have some non-linearity part that was not considered in this method.

===Dynamic Thermal Management===

As the Integrated Circuit (IC) technology size is getting smaller in nanometer scale and more transistors are put together in that small area, the total power and temperature on chip are also increasing. The high temperature on the chip, if not controlled, can damage or even burn the chip. The chip high temperature also has impacts on performance and reliability.&lt;ref name="Efficient thermal simulation"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hang|first=Li |author2=Pu Liu |author3=Zhenyu Qi |author4=Lingling Jin |author5=Wei Wu |author6=Tan, S.X.D. |author7=Jun Yang |title=Efficient thermal simulation for run-time temperature tracking and management|date=31 October 2005|doi=10.1109/ICCD.2005.46}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fast thermal simulation"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Proceedings of the 2005 IEEE/ACM International conference on Computer-aided design |title=Fast thermal simulation for architecture level dynamic thermal management |last=Lie|first=Pu |author2=Zhenyu Qi |author3=Hang Li |author4=Lingling Jin |author5=Wei Wu |author6=S. X. -D. Tan |author7=Jun Yang |year=2005|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1129693}}&lt;/ref&gt; High chip temperature causes more leakage power consumption, higher interconnect resistance and slower speed of transistors.&lt;ref name="Efficient thermal simulation"/&gt; Therefore, Dynamic Thermal Management (DTM) is required for high performance embedded systems or high-end microprocessors. Thermal sensors are also not perfect for the job because of their accuracy and long delay to capture the temperature. The DTM idea is to detect and reduce the temperature of hot units spots in a chip using different techniques like activity migration, local toggling, dynamic voltage and frequency scaling.&lt;ref name="Efficient thermal simulation"/&gt;

A new method was developed by H. Li, P. Liu, Z. Qi, L. Jin, W. Wu, S.X.D Tan, J. Yang at University of California Riverside based on observing the average power consumption of low level modules running typical workload.&lt;ref name="Efficient thermal simulation"/&gt; There is a direct correlation between the observation and temperature variations. This new method was a solution to replace the old technologies such as on-line tracking sensors on the chip like CMOS-based sensor technology that are less accurate and requires hardware implementation.&lt;ref name="Dynamic thermal"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brooks|first=D.|author2=Martonosi, M. |title=Dynamic thermal management for high-performance microprocessors|date=7 August 2002|doi=10.1109/HPCA.2001.903261|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/HPCA.2001.903261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This method is based on observing the average power in a certain amount of time which determines the temperature variations.  This idea can be implemented with a fast run-time thermal simulation algorithm at architectural level.&lt;ref name="Efficient thermal simulation"/&gt;   This method also presents a new way to compute the transient temperature changes based on the frequency domain moment matching concept. The moment matching concept is basically said that the transient behaviors of a dynamic system can be accurately described by a few dominant poles of the systems.&lt;ref name="Efficient thermal simulation"/&gt; The moment matching algorithm is required to compute the temperature variation response under initial temperature conditions and average power inputs for a given time.&lt;ref name="Efficient thermal simulation"/&gt; This method also follows circuit level thermal RC modeling at the architectural level as described in reference.&lt;ref name="Compact thermal modeling"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Huang|first=Wei|author2=Mircea R. Stany|author3=Kevin Skadronz|author4=Karthik Sankaranarayanan|title=Compact thermal modeling for temperature-aware design|journal=2004|date=April 2004|url=http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~techrep/CS-2004-13.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120616063944/http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~techrep/CS-2004-13.pdf|archivedate=2012-06-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The unit temperature variation during run-time is because of the irregular power trance generated by each unit in their architectural blocks.&lt;ref name="Efficient thermal simulation"/&gt; This power input is consistent of DC and small AC oscillation. It was also shown and proven that most of the energy in the power trace concentrates on the DC component. Therefore, the average power can be described as a constant DC input to thermal circuit. After all a thermal moment marching (TMM) with initial condition and DC input is required to be implemented. The TMM model is as follows:

&lt;math&gt;Gx+Cx=Bu&lt;/math&gt; (9)

G and C are conductive and capacitive circuit matrices, and x is the vector of node temperature.&lt;ref name="Efficient thermal simulation"/&gt; u is the vector of independent power source and B is the input selector matrix. This equation will be solved in frequency domain and the initial condition is required which will be the initial temperature at each node.&lt;ref name="Efficient thermal simulation"/&gt;
The main idea is to implement the TMM algorithm which provides better reliable on-line temperature estimation for DTM applications.

In summary, the TMM algorithm is much faster than the previous work in this area to estimate the thermal variation because this method is using frequency domain moment matching method.  The other work (like HotSpot) uses the integration method where it needs all previous points to obtain the temperature at certain running point. This will make the simulation time longer.

This work can also be improved by computing the average power real-time using performance counters. This method can be added to the above models using performance counters to estimate on the fly temperature variation as the programs are getting executed.

===PowerBooter and PowerTutor===

This power model technique was developed by collaboration between L. Zhang, B. Tiwana, Z. Qian, Z. Wang, R.P. Dick, Z.Mao from University of Michigan and L. Yang from Google Inc. to accurately estimate power estimation online for Smartphones.&lt;ref name="Accurate online power"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zhang|first=Lide|author2=Birjodh Tiwana |author3=Zhiyun Qian |author4=Zhaoguang Wang |author5=Robert P. Dick |author6=Zhuoqing Morley Mao |author7=Lei Yang |title=Accurate online power estimation and automatic battery behavior based power model generation for smartphones|year=2010|doi=10.1145/1878961.1878982|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=1878961.1878982}}&lt;/ref&gt;  '''PowerBooter''' is an automated power model that uses built-in battery voltage sensors and behavior of battery during discharge to monitor power consumption of total system. This method doesn’t require any especial external measurement equipment. '''PowerTutor''' is also a power measurement tool that uses PowerBooter generated data for online power estimation. There is always a limitation in [[Smartphone]] technology battery life span that HW and SW designers need to overcome. Software designers don’t always have the best knowledge of power consumption to design better power optimized applications therefore end users always blame the battery lifespan. Therefore, there is a need for a tool that has the capability to measure power consumption on Smartphones that software designers could use to monitor their applications in real-time. Researchers have developed specific power management models for specific portable embedded systems and it takes a huge effort to reuse those models for a vast variety of modern [[Smartphone]] technology. So the solution to this problem is PowerBooter model that can estimate real-time power consumption for individual [[Smartphone]] subsystems such as CPU, LCD, GPS, audio, Wi-Fi and cell phone communication components. Along with PowerBooter model an on-line PowerTutor utility can use the generated data to determine the subsystem level power consumption. The model and PowerTutor utility can be used across different platforms and [[Smartphone]] technologies.

This model is different from the other models discovered because it relies only on knowledge of the battery discharge voltage curve and access to battery voltage sensor which is available in all modern Smartphones.&lt;ref name="Accurate online power"/&gt; The basic idea for this model technique is to use battery state of discharge with running training software programs to control phone component power and activity states. Each individual [[Smartphone]] component is held in a specific state for a significant period of time and the change in battery state of discharge is captured using built-in battery voltage sensors.&lt;ref name="Accurate online power"/&gt; The first challenging idea is to convert battery voltage readings into power consumption. This is determined by state of discharge (which is total consumed energy by battery) variation within a testing interval captured by voltage sensors that will eventually drive the following equation.

&lt;math&gt;P*\left( {{t}_{1}}-{{t}_{2}} \right)=E*(SOD\left( {{V}_{1}} \right)-SOD\left( {{V}_{2}} \right))&lt;/math&gt; (10)

Where E is the rated battery energy capacity and SOD (Vi) is the battery state of discharge at voltage Vi and P is the average power consumption in the time interval t1 and t2. The state of discharge can be estimated using look up table where the relationship between present voltage and SOD is captured. Determining the energy is also an issue because the energy is changing as the battery gets old. The new batteries have the total energy written on their back but the value can’t be true for all time. It can estimate the energy at highest and lowest discharge rate to decrease the error. The internal resistance also has significant impact on the discharged current. To decrease the effect of internal resistance all the phone components can be switched to their lowest power modes to minimize the discharge current when taking a voltage reading. Finally, this method uses a piece-wise linear function to model the non-linear relationship between SOF and battery voltage.

The above battery model can be all automated with 3 steps which are described in.&lt;ref name="Accurate online power"/&gt; In conclusion, this method is beneficial because all Smartphones can use this method and for new Smartphones this model needs to be constructed only once and after automating the process there would be no need for any extra equipment to measure power consumption. Once the model is generated automatically or manually the PowerTutor utility can use the data to estimate power consumption in real time.  Software engineers can use this utility to optimize their design or users can use this tool to make their decision about buying applications based on the power consumption.

The main issues are in computing the energy which adds up to accuracy of the power model. Another issue is also considering the internal resistor to read the voltage. This can be resolved in newer versions of Smartphones that provide current measurement instead of voltage. The above model needs to be modified using the current measurement.

'''Appscope'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Yoon|first=Chanmin|author2=Kim, Dongwon |author3=Jung, Wonwoo |author4=Kang, Chulkoo |author5=Cha, Hojung |title=AppScope: Application Energy Metering Framework for Android Smartphones using Kernel Activity Monitoring|url=https://www.usenix.org/sites/default/files/conference/protected-files/yoon_atc12_slides.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and '''DevScope'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jung |first=Wonwoo |author2=Kang, Chulkoo |author3=Yoon, Chanmin |author4=Kim, Dongwon |author5=Cha, Hojung |title=DevScope: a nonintrusive and online power analysis tool for Smartphone hardware components|year=2012|doi=10.1145/2380445.2380502|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=2380445.2380502}}&lt;/ref&gt;  are similar work to estimate [[Smartphone]] power consumptions.

===Run- time modeling and estimation of operating system power consumption===

The operating system (OS) is the main [[software]] running on most computing systems and contributes a major component in dissipating power consumption. Therefore, operating system model was developed by T. Li and L.K John from University of Texas at Austin to estimate the power consumption by OS that helps power management and software applications power evaluation.&lt;ref name= "PC3"/&gt;

It’s been computed that software execution on hardware components can dissipate a good portion of power consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Intel Power Gadget Software Tool at:|url=http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-power-gadget-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; It’s also been shown that the choice of algorithm and other higher level software code decisions during the design of software could significantly affect system power.  Many of these software applications rely on operating system; therefore, overlooking the estimated power consumption by OS could cause huge error in energy estimation. Estimating OS power consumption could help software designers optimize their code design to be more energy efficient. For example, software engineer; can observe the power consumption when using different compiling techniques to handle TLB misses and paging.&lt;ref name="Accurate online power"/&gt; A good OS model needs to have the following properties to be good enough for thermal or power management tools.  The model needs to be highly reliable, fast, and it also should have run-time estimation capability that does not increase overhead. The model should be simple and easily adoptable across different platforms.

The purposed run-time power estimation requires a first order linear operation on a single power metric, reducing estimation overhead.&lt;ref name="Accurate online power"/&gt; The Instruction per Cycle (IPC) can be used as the metric to characterize the performance of modern processors. In paper&lt;ref name="Accurate online power"/&gt; shows how various components in the CPU and memory systems contributes to the total OS routine power. Data-path and pipeline structure along with clocks are consuming the most power. A linear model can be derived from IPC that tracks the OS routine power. A simple Energy equation &lt;math&gt;E=P*T&lt;/math&gt; can be used to estimate a given piece of software energy consumption, where P is the average power and T is the execution time of that program.

The challenging part is to compute the average power P for each individual routine of operation system. One can use the correlation between IPC and OS routine average power or hardware performance counters can be used. The profiling method (data gathered from benchmark testing) can also be used to predict the energy consumption.  The linear power model in&lt;ref name="Accurate online power"/&gt; is as follows:&lt;math&gt;{{P}_{OS}}={{K}_{1}}*\text{ }IP{{C}_{OS}}+{{K}_{0}}&lt;/math&gt;. This is a simple linear model that shows a strong correlation between IPC and OS routine power. In this approach profiling is also required to generate data needed to build the model. After the model is generated for one system, then it is not needed again for the same system.

===Virtual Machine Power Metering and Provisioning===

Joulemeter is a proposed solution by Aman Kansal, Feng Zhao, and Jie Liu from Microsoft Inc. and Nupur Kothari from University of Southern California, Los Angeles and Arka Bhattacharya from Indian Institute of Technology to measure virtual machine power which cannot be measured directly in hardware.&lt;ref name="Virtual machine power"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kansal|first=Aman|author2=Feng Zhao |author3=Jie Liu |author4=Nupur Kothari |author5=Arka A. Bhattacharya |title=Virtual machine power metering and provisioning|year=2010|doi=10.1145/1807128.1807136}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method is used for power management for virtualized data centers. Most servers today have power metering and the old servers use power distribution units (PDUs). This method uses those individual power meters to save significant reduction in power provisioning costs.

This method uses power models in software to track VM energy usage on each significant hardware resource, using hypervisor-observable hardware power states.&lt;ref name="Virtual machine power"/&gt; Joulemeter can also solve the power capping problem for VMs which will reduce power provisioning costs significantly. The largest power consuming subsystems in computer servers are the processor, memory and disk. Servers also have idle energy consumption which sometimes can be large, but it is static and it can be measured. Power models are presented for each of subsystems CPU, memory and disk in reference&lt;ref name="Virtual machine power"/&gt; in detail. This power model is the core technique for Joulemeter.  Figure 4 in reference&lt;ref name="Virtual machine power"/&gt; shows the block diagram of Joulemeter where System Resource &amp; Power Tracing module reads the full server CPU, disk and power usage. The VM resource tracking module tracks all the work load using hypervisor counters. The base model training module implements the learning methods described in&lt;ref name="Virtual machine power"/&gt; as well as refinement module. The energy calculation module finally takes the out of base model training module and model refinement module to output the VM energy usage using the energy equations described in reference.&lt;ref name="Virtual machine power"/&gt;

The benefits of this method are safe isolation of co-located workloads, enabling multiple workloads to be consolidated on fewer servers, resulting in improved resource utilization and reduced idle power costs. Joulemeter can also be used to solve the power capping problem for VMs which will saved significant amount of power provisioning costs in data centers.

==Direct Power measurement==
One can use different types of sensors to gather voltage, current, frequency or temperature and then use those data to estimate power consumption.

===Low Power Energy Aware Processing embedded sensor system===

The LEAP (Low Power Energy Aware Processing) has been developed by D. McIntire, K. Ho, B. Yip, A. Singh, W. Wu, and W.J. Kaiser at University of California Los Angeles to make sure the embedded network sensor systems are energy optimized for their applications. The LEAP system as described in reference&lt;ref name="The low power energy"&gt;{{cite journal|last=McIntire|first=Dustin|author2=Kei Ho |author3=Bernie Yip |author4=Amarjeet Singh |author5=Winston Wu |author6=William J. Kaiser |title=The low power energy aware processing (LEAP)embedded networked sensor system|year=2006|doi=10.1145/1127777.1127846|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=1127777.1127846}}&lt;/ref&gt;  offers a detailed energy dissipation monitoring and sophisticated power control scheduling for all subsystems including the sensor systems. LEAP is a multiprocessor architecture based on hardware and software system partitioning. It is an independent energy monitoring and power control method for each individual subsystem. The goal of LEAP is to control microprocessors to achieve the lowest per task operating energy. Many modern embedded networked sensors are required to do many things like image processing, statistical high performance computing and communication. To make sure all of these applications are working efficiently a real-time energy monitoring and scheduling feature is required and LEAP can offer this feature for those systems.

LEAP (ENS) system was designed to offer high accuracy and low overhead energy measurement capability. LEAP enables energy aware applications through scheduling and energy profiling of high energy efficiency components including multiple wireless network interfaces, storage elements, and sensing capabilities.&lt;ref name="The low power energy"/&gt; The biggest advantage of LEAP system is its Energy Management and Preprocessing (EMAP) capability. The experimental results shows that the optimal choice of sensor systems, processor, wireless interface, and memory technology is not application dependent but it could be hardware allocation issue. EMAP has the capability to partition devices into many power domains with the capability to monitor, enable or disable power to each domain, as well as to respond to trigger events or conditions that restore or remove power in each domain. EMAP collects data periodically and transfers them to the host process and power management schedule is then provided by host processor to EMAP.

Figure 1 in reference&lt;ref name="The low power energy"/&gt; shows the LEAP architecture and EMAP architecture. The LEAP and EMAP are complex platforms which require hardware and software. All of the detailed design approaches are described in reference.&lt;ref name="The low power energy"/&gt;

In conclusion, LEAP differs from previous methods like PowerScope&lt;ref name="PowerScope: a tool"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Flinn, and Satyanarayanan|first=J. and M.|title=PowerScope: a tool for profiling the energy usage of mobile applications|date=6 August 2002|doi=10.1109/MCSA.1999.749272|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=749272}}&lt;/ref&gt; because it provides both real-time power consumption information and a standard application execution environment on the same platform. As a result, LEAP eliminates the need for synchronization between the device under test and an external power measurement unit. LEAP also provides power information of individual subsystems, such as CPU, GPU and RAM, through direct measurement, thereby enabling accurate assessments of software and hardware effects on the power behavior of individual components.&lt;ref name="Performance Computing with Graphic"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mahsan Rofouei, ThaStathopoulos, Ryffel, Kaiser, and Sarrafzadeh|first=Mahsan, Thanos, William, Majid|title=Energy-Aware High Performance Computing with Graphic Processing Units|year=2008|url=http://static.usenix.org/events/hotpower08/tech/full_papers/rofouei/rofouei.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Power model validation through thermal measurements===

One of the challenges for HW or SW designers is to validate their simulation data with empirical data. They require some type of utility or tool to measure power consumption and compare with their simulation data. One of these methods to capture real time data to validate power or thermal models is an infrared measurement setup developed by F.J. Mesa-Martinez, J.Nayfach-Battilana and J. Renau at University of California Santa Cruz. Their approach is to capture thermal maps using infrared cameras with high spatial resolution and high frame rate. Then a genetic algorithm finds a power equation for each floorplan block of processor that produces the capture thermal map to give detailed information about power breakdown (leakage and dynamic).&lt;ref name="Power model validation"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mesa-Martinez|first=Francisco Javier|author2=Nayfach-Battilana, Joseph |author3=Renau, Jose |title=Power model validation through thermal measurements|journal=ACM SIGARCH Computer Architecture News|date=9 June 2007|volume=35|issue=2|pages=302|doi=10.1145/1273440.1250700|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=1273440.1250700}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also developed an image processing filter to increase the thermal image accuracy. The biggest challenge for this approach is to obtain a detailed power map from the thermal measurements. There is no direct mapping between measured information and power. A genetic algorithm was developed described in reference&lt;ref name="Power model validation"/&gt; that iterates multiple thermal traces and compares them with the results from thermal simulator to find the best power correlation.

The first step is to measure the temperature using IR camera and within the oil coolant that flows over the top of the chip surface, the detailed setup information is described in reference.&lt;ref name="Power model validation"/&gt; Oil is chosen because of ease in modeling and accuracy. The infrared cameras must be calibrated to compensate for different material thermal emissions, lens configurations, and other factors in reference.&lt;ref name="Power model validation"/&gt; A second filter is also applied to compensate for the optical distortion induced by lens setup. A very accurate thermal model is required in this approach to account for effects of the liquid cooling setup accurately. The model equations are described in reference.&lt;ref name="Power model validation"/&gt;

Designers can use this method to validate their simulation or optimize their design especially because this method provides the breakdown information about leakage and dynamic power consumption. This method is also helpful in chip packaging design, heat sink, and cooling system. This method also shows designers which part of floorplan blocks propagates heat faster or slower.

==Conclusion==
Estimating power consumption is critical for hardware, software developers, and other computing system users like Internet companies to save energy or to optimize their HW/SW to be more energy efficient. It is also critical because one can use the available resources accordingly. Simulators are only good during design but their estimation also needs to be verified. Simulators in general have high errors due to manufacturing of hardware components. Power meters measure power consumption for the whole system but does not give detailed breakdowns about dissipated power so designers can optimize their application or hardware. This paper analyzed different methods that researchers have discovered in recent years to resolve some of the issues above.

== Technology ==
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2017}}

=== Background ===

Traditional PV systems are typically characterized by a centralized inverter or string inverter architecture*. In this [[topology]] the inverter performs MPPT for large quantities of solar panels as a whole. Since the [[solar panel]]s are connected in series to form strings, the same current must flow through all the modules, so the solar inverter continuously adjusts the electric current in the system to find the average optimal working point of all the modules. 
As a result, potential power may be lost whenever a mismatch exists between modules.[2][3]* Panel mismatch is unavoidable in many cases, due to panel manufacturing tolerance, partial shading,[4] uneven soiling, or uneven tilt angle. In addition, power may also be lost due to slow tracking of dynamic weather conditions caused by moving clouds,[5] and on extremely hot or cold days when the system [[Direct current|DC]] voltage may exceed the inverter’s permissible input voltage range*. These factors cause small losses in yearly yields, but they are present. Other drawbacks of traditional PV systems include:
*	System design is constrained by the need to match all strings’ length and orientation
*	Monitoring visibility and fault detection are limited to the inverter (or in some cases, to the string level)
*	High [[Direct current|DC]] voltage is present as long as the sun is up, posing a possible risk of electrocution to installers, maintenance personnel and firefighters*

These drawbacks, however, can be mitigated by newer string inverters with advanced electronics and features such as dual, shade-tolerant and improved MPPT.

== Offering ==

SolarEdge delivers a distributed system that tackles the aforementioned challenges. Energy loss due to panel mismatch is prevented by performing MPPT for each panel individually. String voltage is kept fixed at all times, so strings can be combined regardless of length, tilt, or type of panels used. Continuous performance measurement enables online monitoring and fault detection at panel-level. Installer and firefighter safety is enhanced by shutting off the [[Direct current|DC]] voltage whenever the inverter is disconnected. To achieve the above without raising the cost of the system, compared to standard inverters, SolarEdge provides panel optimizers as well as its own inverter and monitoring web portal. The solution is applicable for a wide range of applications, from residential roofs to large scale solar farms.&lt;ref name="frost"/&gt;

== Products ==
[[File:SolarEdge-Verdrahtungsbeispiel-01.jpg|thumb|SolarEdge power optimizers Wiring Example with a safety monitoring interface mode (SMI) and a standard inverter.]]
[[File:SolarEdge-Leistungsoptimierer-02.JPG|thumb|SolarEdge power optimizer 350W. The long wires are used to connect the SolarEdge power optimizers with each other (in series). On the short wires the photovoltaic module is connected.]]
===Power Optimizer===
The SolarEdge Power Optimizer is embedded into each panel by panel manufacturers instead of the junction box, or retrofitted by PV installers onto regular modules. The power optimizer optimizes energy output by performing Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) individually for each panel and maintains a fixed [[Direct current|DC]] string voltage. Power optimizers also collect performance measurements and telemetries of each panel, and transmit the data over existing power lines.

===Inverter===
The SolarEdge Solar inverter is responsible for [[Direct current|DC]] to AC inversion while MPPT and voltage management are handled by power optimizers separately for each module. Fixed string voltage ensures operation at the highest efficiency at all times (97% maximum efficiency), independent of string length and temperature.
The company offers single-phase inverters with a rated AC power output of between 3,000 and 11,000 watts, as well as three-phase inverters with a rated AC power output ranging between 7,000 and 25,000

===Monitoring Portal===
Web-based and smartphone (both iOS and Android) applications provide module-level, string-level and system-wide PV Monitoring. The software provides alerts on a wide range of issues affecting energy generation that might otherwise go undetected. Data and alerts are presented on a virtual site map and can be pinpointed to specific location to reduce maintenance time and costs.

===Installer Tools===
SolarEdge provides a set of freeware software tools with its products. The Site Designer recommends string layout and inverter and power optimizer selection, according to the site’s size. The Configuration Tool allows remote configuration of the SolarEdge inverter as well as real-time, on-site verification of correct installation, and the iPhone Site Mapping Tool application, allows for swift and easy creations of a virtual map of the PV site.

==History==

The technology piloted by SunSaluter was invented by Eden Full Goh in 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.odec.ca/projects/2008/full8e2/|title=Passionate Passivity - Home|website=www.odec.ca|access-date=2018-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was initially under development by Full’s company, Roseicollis Technologies, based in Canada&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/pictures/mef45eldh/eden-full-founder-roseicollis-technologies-19/|title=Eden Full, Founder, Roseicollis Technologies, 19 - pg.9|last=Helman|first=Christopher|website=Forbes|access-date=2018-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In 2011, Full Goh received a Thiel Fellowship for US$100,000 to develop her passive solar tracker concept&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thielfellowship.org/about/|title=About - The Thiel Fellowship|work=The Thiel Fellowship|access-date=2018-01-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/16/business/the-thiel-fellows-forgoing-college-to-pursue-dreams.html|title=The Thiel Fellows, Forgoing College to Pursue Dreams|last=Kelly|first=Caitlin|date=2012-09-15|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-01-03|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;, before continuing its development while an engineering student at Princeton University&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://paw.princeton.edu/article/tune-drop-out-start|title=Tune in.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6423">[[File:Thurgartstone3.JPG|thumb|The Ogrestone or Thurgartstone is situated on the lands of Brandleside Farm near the Chapel Crags]]
The '''Thurgartstone''' or '''Ogrestone''' is a famous stone near [[Corsehill, Lainshaw, Robertland and Dunlop|Dunlop]] in [[East Ayrshire]] in [[Scotland]]. The Thurgartstone is thought to have been a [[rocking stone]] at one time, but it no longer rocks. 
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Ogrestane1.jpg|thumb|260px|The Thurgartstone]] --&gt;

==Name==
The Thurgartstane is also known as the Ogrestane, the Thorgatstane, the Field Spirit Stane, T'Ogra Stane, Thugart Stane, Ogirtstane, Fiend's Stane, Ogart Stane, Horgar Stane  or Thougritstane. In modern English, it is the Thurgartstone or Ogrestone.
 
One explanation of the name is that it derives from 'Thor's Great Stone'. Another is that the name comes from the phrase "''Thou Great Stone''" or just '"''grit stane''" (Paterson 1866). The term 'The Stone of the Ogre' may indicate some forgotten legend. Some names may be spelling errors originating in or propagated by the [[Ordnance Survey]] or other maps. Another theory is that the name is derived from the word "Tagairtstane", which means "the priest's stone."

Yet another possibility is that 'Ogrestane' is more 'Ogre ton' and that the personal name 'Ogier' is a Normanised version of the Scandinavian name 'Holger'. Brandleside may be also be a Scandinavian name and suggest that 'Brandale' was once the name of this valley.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dunlopkirk.org.uk/images/docs/dec12.pdf David Clement. Dunlop Diary. December 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
{{unsourced|section|date=April 2018}}
[[Image:Dunlop Church Ayrshire.JPG|left|thumb|Dunlop kirk and village from the Thurgartstone]]
The Thurgartstone is close to [[Dunlop, East Ayrshire|Dunlop]] on the Lugton Road is Black Burn Valley. In the middle of a field near the Chapel Crags is the Thurgartstone. Dunlop or Boarland Hill, the site of Dunlop Castle once held by the De Ross family, can be seen from the stone. The stone is in a sheltered spot, with ample running water. It is somewhat hidden from view.

==Description==
{{unsourced|section|date=April 2018}}
The Thurgartston is a "glacial erratic stone". It is composed of blue augitic porphyrite. This rock is different from the 'native' stone of the area. The Thurgartston weighs about 25 tons and  the part above ground is about twelve feet by eight feet (Bayne, 1935). It is set near the site of the pre-[[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] St Mary's Chapel. The site is listed and protected by [[Historic Scotland]].

== Monastic settlement ==
[[Image:Towards Chapel Crags Dunlop.JPG|thumb|Looking towards the old Monks graveyard and Chapel Crags from the Thurgartstone.]]
There was a monastic settlement associated with the chapel of [[Saint Mary]] near the Thurgartstone site. The history of the site is apparently similar to the history of the  Chapel Hill site at [[Chapeltoun]].

There are steps cut into the rock that led up to the monk's cemetery. The monastery, original chapel and graveyard are no longer visible. There is a [[holy well]] in the "field bordered by the burn." The new buildings called "Marys Chapel" at the site are built on the foundation of the original chapel. Chapelhouse Farm nearby was once called Brandlecraig.&lt;ref&gt;Search over Lainshaw, Register of Sasines. Page 154&lt;/ref&gt;

Some stone relics from St Mary's were given to a member of the Clement family and a christening font was discovered in the burn at Kirkwood Farm by another Clement. There artifacts are now kept at North Borland Farm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dunlopkirk.org.uk/images/docs/feb13.pdf Dunlop Diary. February 2013.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Associated Beliefs==
{{onesource|section|date=April 2018}}
The Thurgartstone has long been associated with pagan ritual practices. There are still [[May Day]] celebrations and events at the site. This '[[Druid]]ical' stone is thought by some to have been a [[rocking stone|'rocking or logan']] stone at one time. It is now firmly set in the 'rubbish' and dirt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Love|first=Dane|title=Legendary Ayrshire. Custom : Folklore: Tradition|year=2009|publisher=Carn Publishing|location=Auchinleck|isbn=978-0-9518128-6-0|pages=18–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are records showing that "''even as late as the time of Popery''", Catholics would do penance by crawling on their knees around this stone, crying "''O thou grit stane''". Apparently they held a belief that the Deity was present in the Thurgartstone (MacIntosh 1894).

Farmers from Brandleside Farm did not remove the stone. They also kept their ploughs a set distance away from the Thurgartstone. This was presumably because legend has it that there were pagan burials around this monument (Paterson 1866). The ancient Dunlop [[Carlin stone]] is on the other side of the village.

[[File:12 surface mount potentiometers.jpg|thumb|right|Trimmer potentiometers or "trimpots"]]
[[File:Trimmer capacitor symbol GOST.svg|thumb|right|Electronic symbol for a capacitive trimmer]]
A '''trimmer'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kpsec.freeuk.com/components/vres.htm#presets Variable Resistors; The Electronics Club.]&lt;/ref&gt; is a miniature adjustable electrical component. It is meant to be set correctly when installed in some device, and never seen or adjusted by the device's user. Trimmers can be variable resistors ([[potentiometer]]s), [[variable capacitor]]s, or trimmable [[inductor]]s. They are common in precision circuitry like [[Audiovisual|A/V]] components, and may need to be adjusted when the equipment is serviced. Trimpots are often used to initially calibrate equipment after manufacturing. Unlike many other variable controls, trimmers are mounted directly on [[circuit board]]s, turned with a small [[screwdriver]] and rated for many fewer adjustments over their lifetime. Trimmers like trimmable inductors and trimmable [[capacitor]]s are usually found in [[superhet]] [[radio]] and [[television]] receivers, in the [[intermediate frequency]] (IF), [[oscillator]] and radio frequency (RF) circuits. They are adjusted into the right position during the alignment procedure of the receiver.

Trimmers come in a variety of sizes and levels of precision. For example, multi-turn trim potentiometers exist, in which it takes several turns of the adjustment screw to reach the end value. This allows for very high degrees of accuracy. Often they make use of a worm-gear (rotary track) or a leadscrew (linear track).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trimpot - Trimmer potentiometer|url=http://www.resistorguide.com/trimpot/|work=the Resistor Guide|accessdate=20 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1952, [[Bourns, Inc.|Marlan Bourns]] patented the world's first trimming potentiometer, trademarked "Trimpot", a name now [[genericized trademark|commonly used]] to refer to any trimming potentiometer.

[[File:Hurricane King Wind Swath.JPG|right|thumb|Wind Swath of [[Hurricane King]] over Miami]]
'''Tropical cyclone windspeed climatology''' is the study wind distribution amongst [[tropical cyclone]]s, a significant threat to land and people. Since records began in 1851, winds from hurricanes, typhoons and cyclones have been responsible for fatalities and damage in every basin. Major hurricanes ([[Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale|Category 3]] or above) usually cause the most wind damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/D1.html |title=TCFAQ D1) How are Atlantic hurricanes ranked? |publisher=Aoml.noaa.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hurricane Andrew]] for example caused $45 billion (2005 USD) in damage, most of it wind damage.&lt;ref name="a"&gt;[http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/1992andrew.html NHC Report on Andrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although wind damage is common to tropical cyclones near landmasses, there are a few factors that lead to high wind speeds. Warm water temperatures, which was seen during [[Hurricane Wilma]] when it winds rapidly strengthened to 185&amp;nbsp;mph (295&amp;nbsp;km/h) in a 24-hour period due to the presence of abnormally warm water temperatures. Size and speed of the storm, which results in damage along a wide area as seen in [[Hurricane Isabel]] and [[Great New England Hurricane of 1938]].&lt;ref name="b"&gt;{{NHC TCR url|id=AL252005_Wilma|title=Hurricane Wilma Report}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/2003isabel.shtml? Hurricane Isabel Report]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Winds in tropical cyclones==
The winds in a tropical cyclone are the result of [[evaporation]] and [[condensation]] of moisture which results in [[updraft]]s. The updrafts in turn increase the height of the storm which causes more [[condensation]].

===Location of the winds===
[[Image:Wind add.jpg|right|thumb|Right front quadrant of a typical hurricane.]]
The strongest winds in a northern hemisphere [[tropical cyclone]] is located in the [[eyewall]] and the right front quadrant of the tropical cyclone. Severe damage is usually the result when the eyewall of a hurricane, typhoon or cyclone passes over land. The right front quadrant is also an area of a tropical cyclone were the winds are strongest. The reason that the winds are at the front right side of a storm in the northern hemisphere (and the front left hand side in the Southern Hemisphere) is because of the motion of a tropical cyclone contributing to its rotation. A 100&amp;nbsp;mph hurricane while stationary, might have winds of 100&amp;nbsp;mph on its right side in the northern hemisphere while the rest of the storm might have winds at 70&amp;nbsp;mph. The location of the right ( or left in the Southern Hemisphere) front quadrant also depends on the storm track. For example, in the northern hemisphere,  if the storm was moving west, then the right side is to the north, if it moving north, then the strongest winds will be to the east of the center.
&lt;ref name="c"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/D6.html |title=TCFAQ D6) Why are the strongest winds in a hurricane typically on the |publisher=Aoml.noaa.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the southern hemisphere, the strongest winds are to the left of the eye. That is because cyclonic winds below the equator, spin clockwise.&lt;ref name="c"/&gt;

On occasion, strong winds and wind gusts can occur in the rain bands of a tropical cyclone. And inside the [[eye (cyclone)|eye]] the winds are relatively calm. At higher altitudes, the winds within a tropical cyclone head away from the center, forming the outflow which produces the shape of the tropical cyclone.

==Classification of the winds==
{{Saffir-Simpson small}}{{main|Tropical cyclone scales}}

The United States uses the [[Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale]], a 1–5 scale which categorize hurricanes by sustained wind speed. The hurricane scale was created in 1969 by [[Herbert Saffir]] and [[Robert Simpson (meteorologist)|Bob Simpson]]. The [[National Hurricane Center]] classifies hurricanes category 3 or above, major hurricanes. The [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]] also uses a scale similar to the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. However, the JTWC classified typhoons with winds of at 150&amp;nbsp;mph or higher ''Supertyphoons''.

The Bureau of Meteorology in Australia uses a 1–5 scale called tropical cyclone severity categories. Unlike the [[Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale]], it categorizes tropical cyclones based on wind gusts.

===Beaufort wind scale===
Before the 1–5 scale was created in 1969 by the [[National Hurricane Center]] and later by the [[Bureau of Meteorology]] in Australia. Many tropical cyclones were simply ranked by the [[Beaufort Wind Scale]] which was created in the early 1800s by Francis Beaufort. The purpose of the scale was to standardize wind reports in ship logs. The scale was divided down into 14 forces (force 0 is calm while force 12 is hurricane).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/D10.html |title=TCFAQ D10) Why do hurricane force winds start at 64 knots ? |publisher=Aoml.noaa.gov |date=13 August 2004 |accessdate=2014-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fastest windspeed per basin==
This lists the fastest wind speed of a tropical cyclone per basin since 1950 (NOTE: All wind speeds are 1-minute sustained and are in mph).

*North Atlantic: [[Hurricane Allen|190&amp;nbsp;mph (1980)]]

A '''van der Waals molecule''' is a weakly bound complex of [[atom]]s or [[molecules]] held together by intermolecular attractions such as [[van der Waals forces]] or by [[hydrogen bonds]].&lt;ref name="BlaneyEwing1976"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blaney|first1=B L|last2=Ewing|first2=G E|title=Van Der Waals Molecules|journal=Annual Review of Physical Chemistry|volume=27|issue=1|year=1976|pages=553–584|issn=0066-426X|doi=10.1146/annurev.pc.27.100176.003005|bibcode=1976ARPC...27..553B}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name originated in the beginning of the 1970s when stable molecular clusters were regularly observed in [[molecular beam]] [[microwave spectroscopy]].

==Examples==
Examples of well-studied vdW molecules are Ar&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-Ar, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O-Ar, benzene-Ar, (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and (HF)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Supersonic beam spectroscopy==
In (supersonic) molecular beams  temperatures are very low (usually less than 5 K). At these low temperatures van der Waals (vdW) molecules are stable and can be investigated by microwave, [[far-infrared spectroscopy]] and other modes of spectroscopy.&lt;ref name="SmalleyWharton1977"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smalley|first1=Richard E.|last2=Wharton|first2=Lennard|last3=Levy|first3=Donald H.|title=Molecular optical spectroscopy with supersonic beams and jets|journal=Accounts of Chemical Research|volume=10|issue=4|year=1977|pages=139–145|issn=0001-4842|doi=10.1021/ar50112a006|url=http://www.dtic.mil/get-tr-doc/pdf?AD=ADA045167}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also in cold equilibrium gases vdW molecules are formed, albeit in small, temperature dependent,  concentrations. Rotational and vibrational transitions in vdW molecules have indeed been observed in gases, mainly by UV and IR spectroscopy.

Van der Waals molecules are usually very non-rigid and different [[Semi-rigid_molecule#Identical_nuclei|versions]] are separated by low energy barriers, so that tunneling splittings, observable in  far-infrared spectra, are relatively large.&lt;ref name="Hutson1990"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hutson|first1=J M|title=Intermolecular Forces from the Spectroscopy of Van Der Waals Molecules|journal=Annual Review of Physical Chemistry|volume=41|issue=1|year=1990|pages=123–154|issn=0066-426X|doi=10.1146/annurev.pc.41.100190.001011|bibcode=1990ARPC...41..123H}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, in the far-infrared one may observe intermolecular vibrations, rotations, and tunneling motions of van der Waals molecules. The VRT spectroscopic study of Van der Waals molecules is one of the most direct routes to the understanding of [[intermolecular forces]].&lt;ref name="Miller1986"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Miller|first1=R.

'''Volatile fatty acids (VFAs)''' are important elements in controlling the [[anaerobic digestion]] process. It has two important roles: decomposing organics and generating gasses, methane and carbon dioxide.   When both decomposing and generating occur continuously and completely,  oxygen demand decreases. Volatile fatty acids can be analyzed by [[titration]], [[distillation]], [[steam distillation]], and [[chromatography]].&lt;ref&gt;(Water Environment Research, page 53-59, Anderson, G.K. and Yang G. (1992))&lt;/ref&gt; The acceptable level of volatile fatty acids in environmental waters is up to 50,000 ppm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pjoes.com/pdf/17.3/351-356.pdf Determination of Volatile Fatty Acids in Environmental Aqueous Samples], by
 Faculty of Chemistry, University of Gdańsk&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methods ==

=== Titration  ===
[[Titration]] provides rough results. However, it requires less time compared to other methods. It is widely used for a [[Wastewater|wastewater treatment plant]] to track a status of a [[microorganism]].

=== Distillation ===
The distillation procedure provides rough results and 15-32% of the VFAs are lost during distillation. This procedure is also used in for wastewater treatment plants.

=== Steam distillation ===
Steam distillation could recover VFAs about 92-98%. It is more precise than previous two methods. However, it takes 4 hours to complete.

=== Chromatography  ===
Chromatography gives the most precise and accurate results. It is capable of qualitatively and quantitatively analyzing each individual VFA.

Heat engines, [[refrigeration]] cycles and [[heat pump]]s usually involve a fluid to and from which [[heat]] is transferred while undergoing a thermodynamic cycle. This fluid is called the '''working fluid'''.&lt;ref name="Cengel"&gt;Çengel, Yunus A. and Boles, Michael A. [https://ia801605.us.archive.org/4/items/ThermodynamicsAnEngineeringApproachED8/Thermodynamics%20%20an%20engineering%20approach%20ED8.pdf ''Thermodynamics An Engineering Approach Eighth Edition'']. McGraw-Hill Education, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Refrigeration and heat pump technologies often refer to working fluids as [[refrigerants]]. Most thermodynamic cycles make use of the [[latent heat]] (adventages of phase change) of the working fluid. In case of other cycles the working fluid remains in gaseous phase while undergoing all the processes of the cycle. When it comes to heat engines, working fluid generally undergoes a [[combustion]] process as well, for example in [[internal combustion engine]]s or [[gas turbine]]s. There are also technologies in heat pump and refrigeration, where working fluid does not change [[Phase (matter)|phase]], such as [[Brayton cycle#Reverse Brayton cycle|reverse Brayton]] or [[Heat pump and refrigeration cycle#Stirling engine|Stirling]] cycle.

This article summarises the main critera of selecting working fluids for a [[thermodynamic cycle]], such as [[heat engines]] including low grade heat recovery using [[Organic Rankine Cycle]] (ORC) for [[geothermal energy]], [[waste heat]], [[Concentrated solar power|thermal solar energy]] or [[Biomass#Thermal conversions|biomass]] and [[Heat pump and refrigeration cycle|heat pumps and refrigeration cycles]]. The article addresses how working fluids affect technological applications, where the working fluid undergoes a [[phase transition]] and does not remain in its original (mainly [[gaseous]]) phase during all the processes of the thermodynamic cycle.

Finding the optimal working fluid for a given purpose – which is essential to achieve higher energy efficiency in the energy conversion systems – has great impact on the technology, namely it does not just influence operational variables of the cycle but also alters the layout and modifies the design of the equipment. Selection criteria of working fluids generally include thermodynamic and physical properties besides economical and environmental factors, but most often all of these criteria are used together.

==Selection criteria of working fluids==
The choice of working fluids is known to have a significant impact on the thermodynamic as well as economic performance of the cycle. A suitable fluid must exhibit favorable physical, chemical, environmental, safety and economic properties such as low [[specific volume]] (high [[density]]), [[viscosity]], [[toxicity]], [[flammability]], [[ozone depletion potential]] (ODP), [[global warming potential]] (GWP) and cost, as well as favorable process characteristics such as high thermal and [[Exergy|exergetic]] efficiency. These requirements apply both to pure (single-component) and mixed (multicomponent) working fluids. Existing research is largely focused on the selection of pure working fluids, with vast number of published reports currently available. An important restriction of pure working fluids is their constant temperature profile during phase change. Working fluid mixtures are more appealing than pure fluids because their evaporation temperature profile is variable, therefore follows the profile of the heat source better, as opposed to the flat (constant) evaporation profile of pure fluids. This enables an approximately stable temperature difference during evaporation in the [[heat exchanger]], coined as temperature glide, which significantly reduces [[exergetic]] losses. Despite their usefulness, recent publications addressing the selection of mixed fluids are considerably fewer.&lt;ref name="Linke"&gt;Linke, Patrick; Papadopoulos, Athanasios I. and Seferlis, Panos (2015) [http://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/8/6/4755/pdf "Systematic Methods for Working Fluid Selection and the Design, Integration and Control of Organic Rankine Cycles — A Review"] ''Energies'' 2015, 8, 4755-4801; https://doi.org/10.3390/en8064755&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Many authors like for example O. Badr et al.&lt;ref name="Badr"&gt;Badr, O.; Probert, SD. and O'Callaghan, PW. (1985) [https://doi.org/10.1016/0306-2619(85)90072-8 "Selecting a working fluid for a Rankine-cycle engine"]. ''Applied Energy'' 1985;21:1-42.&lt;/ref&gt; have suggested the following thermodynamic and physical criteria which a working fluid should meet for heat engines like Rankine cycles. There are some differences in the critera concerning the working fluids used in heat engines and refrigeration cycles or heat pumps, which are listed below accordingly:

===Common criteria for both heat engines and refrigeration cycles===

# The saturation pressure at the maximum temperature of the cycle should not be excessive. Very high pressures lead to mechanical stress problems, and therefore, unnecessarily expensive components may be required.
# The saturation pressure at the minimum temperature of the cycle (i.e. the condensing pressure) should not be so low as to lead to problems of sealing against infiltration of the atmospheric air into the system.
# The triple point should lie below the expected minimum ambient temperature. This ensures that the fluid does not solidify at any point during the cycle nor whilst being handled outside the system.
# The working fluid should possess a low value of the liquid viscosity, a high latent heat of vaporisation, a high liquid thermal conductivity and a good wetting capability. These ensure that the working fluid pressure drops in passing through the heat exchangers and the auxiliary piping are low and that the heat transfer rates in the exchangers are high.
# The working fluid should have low vapour and liquid specific volumes. These properties affect the rates of heat transfer in the heat exchangers. The vapour specific volume relates directly to the size and cost of the cycle components. Moreover, a high vapour specific volume leads to larger volumetric flows requiring a multiplicity of exhaust ends of the expander at heat engines or [[compressor]] in refrigeration cycles and resulting in significant pressure losses. The specific volume of the liquid at the [[Surface condenser|condenser]] pressure should be as small as possible in order to minimise the required [[Pump|feedwater pump]] work.
# Non-[[Corrosion|corrosivity]] and compatability with common system materials are important selection criteria.
# The fluid should be chemically stable over the whole temperature and pressure range employed. The thermal decomposition resistance of the working fluid in the presence of lubricants and container materials is a highly important criterion. In addition to making the replacement of the working fluid necessary, chemical decomposition of the fluid can produce non-condensable gases which lower the heat transfer rate in the heat exchangers, as well as compounds, which have corrosive effects on the materials of the system.
# Non-toxicity, non-flammability, non-[[Explosive material|explosiveness]], non-[[Radioactive decay|radioactiveness]] and current industrial acceptability are also desirable attributes.
# The fluid should meet the criteria of environmental protection requirements such as a low grade ozone depletion potential (ODP) and global warming potential (GWP).
# The fluid should possess good lubrication properties to reduce friction between surfaces in mutual contact, which reduces the heat generated when the surfaces move and ultimately increases cycle performance.
# The substance should be of low cost and readily available in large quantities.
# Long-term (operational) experience with the working fluid and possible ﬂuid recycling is also beneficial.

===Special criteria for heat engines (like Rankine cycle)===

# The critical temperature of the fluid should be well above the highest temperature existing in the proposed cycle. Evaporation of the working fluid — and thus the significant addition of heat — can then ensue at the maximum temperature of the cycle. This results in a relatively high cycle efficiency.
# The slope d''s''/d''T'' of the saturated vapour line in ''T''–''s'' diagram (see Chapter Classification of pure (single-component) working fluids) should be nearly zero in the applied pressure ratio of the expander. This prevents significant moisture (liquid droplet) formation or excessive superheat occurring during the expansion. It also ensures that all the heat rejection in the condenser occurs at the minimum cycle temperature, which increases the thermal efficiency.
# A low value for the specific heat of the liquid or, alternatively, a low ratio of number of atoms per molecule divided by the molecular weight and a high ratio of the latent heat of vaporisation to the liquid's specific heat should appertain. This reduces the amount of the heat required to raise the temperature of the subcooled liquid of the working fluid to the saturation temperature corresponding to the pressure in the Rankinecycle's evaporator. So most of the heat is added at the maximum cycle temperature, and the Rankine cycle can approach more closely the Carnot cycle.

===Special criteria for refrigeration cycles or heat pumps===

# The slope d''s''/d''T'' of the saturated vapour line in ''T''–''s'' diagram (see Chapter Classification of pure (single-component) working fluids) should be nearly zero, but never positive in the applied pressure ratio of the compressor. This prevents significant moisture (liquid droplet) formation or excessive superheat occurring during the compression. Compressors are very sensitive to liquid droplets. 
# The saturation pressure at the temperature of evaporation should not be lower than atmospheric pressure. This mainly corresponds to open-type compressors.
# The saturation pressure at the temperature of condensation should not be high.
# The ratio of condensation and evaporation pressures should be low.

==Classification of pure (single-component) working fluids==

=== Traditional classification ===

[[File:Traditional classification of pure working fluids.svg|thumb|1060px|right|Traditional classification of pure working fluids. 1→2 shows isentropic expansions from saturated vapour states.]]

Traditional and presently most widespread categorisation of pure working fluids was first used by [[Harry Zvi Tabor|H. Tabor]] et al.&lt;ref name="Tabor"&gt;Tabor, Harry and Bronicki, Lucien (1964) [https://doi.org/10.4271/640823 "Establishing Criteria for Fluids for Small Vapor Turbines"]. ''SAE Technical Paper'' 640823.&lt;/ref&gt; and O. Badr et al.&lt;ref name="Badr"/&gt; dating back to the 60s. This three-class classification system sorts pure working fluids into three categories. The base of the classification is the ''shape of the [[saturation vapor curve|saturation vapour curve]]'' of the fluid in [[Temperature vs. specific entropy diagram|temperature-entropy plane]]. If the slope of the saturation vapour curve in all states is negative (d''s''/d''T''&lt;0), which means that with decreasing [[Boiling point|saturation temperature]] the value of [[entropy]] increases, the fluid is called wet. If the slope of the saturation vapour curve of the fluid is mainly positive (regardless of a short negative slope somewhat below the [[Critical point (thermodynamics)|critical point]]), which means that with decreasing saturation temperature the value of entropy also decreases (d''T''/d''s''&gt;0), the fluid is dry. The third category is called [[Isentropic process|isentropic]], which means constant entropy and refers to those fluids that have a vertical saturation vapour curve (regardless of a short negative slope somewhat below the critical point) in temperature-entropy diagram. According to mathematical approach, it means a (negative) infinite slope (d''s''/d''T''=0). The terms of wet, dry and isentropic refer to the [[vapor quality|quality of vapour]] after the working fluid undergoes an isentropic ([[reversible process (thermodynamics)|reversible]] [[adiabatic process|adiabatic]]) expansion process from [[Vapor–liquid equilibrium|saturated vapour]] state. During an isentropic expansion process the working fluid always ends in the two-phase (also called wet) zone, if it is a wet-type fluid. If the fluid is of dry-type, the isentropic expansion necessarily ends in the [[Superheated steam|superheated]] (also called dry) steam zone. If the working fluid is of isentropic-type, after an isentropic expansion process the fluid stays in saturated vapour state. The quality of vapour is a key factor in choosing [[steam turbine]] or [[Turboexpander#Power generation|expander]] for heat engines. See figure for better understanding.

=== Novel classification ===

[[File:Novel classification of pure working fluids.svg|thumb|1060px|right|Novel classification of pure working fluids.&lt;ref name="Gyorke"&gt;Györke, Gábor; Deiters, Ulrich K.; Groniewsky, Axel; Lassu, Imre and Imre, Attila R. (2018) [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2017.12.135 "Novel classification of pure working fluids for Organic Rankine Cycle"]. ''Energy'' 145 (2018) 288-300.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Traditional classification shows several theoretical and practical deficiencies. One of the most important is the fact that no perfectly isentropic fluid exists.&lt;ref name="Groniewsky1"&gt;Groniewsky, Axel; Györke, Gábor; Imre Attila R. (2017) [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2017.07.074 "Description of wet-to-dry transition in model ORC working fluids"]. ''Applied Thermal Engineering'' 125 (2017) 963-971.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Groniewsky2"&gt;Groniewsky, Axel and Imre, Attila R. (2018) [http://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/20/2/93/pdf "Prediction of the ORC Working Fluid’s Temperature Entropy Saturation Boundary Using Redlich-Kwong Equation of State"]. ''Entropy'' 2018, 20(2), 93. https://doi.org/10.3390/e20020093&lt;/ref&gt; Isentropic fluids have two extrema (d''s''/d''T''=0) on the saturation vapour curve. Practically, there are some fluids which are very close to this behaviour or at least in a certain temperature range, for example [[trichlorofluoromethane]] (CCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;F). Another problem is the extent of how dry or isentropic the fluid behaves, which has significant practical importance when designing for example an Organic Rankine Cycle layout and choosing proper expander.
A new kind of classification was proposed by G. Györke et al.&lt;ref name="Gyorke"/&gt; to resolve the problems and deficiencies of the traditional three-class classification system. The new classification is also based on the shape of the saturation vapour curve of the fluid in temperature-entropy diagram similarly to the traditional one. The classification uses a ''chacteristic-point based method'' to differentiate the fluids. The method defines three primary and two secondary characteristic points. The relative location of these points on the temperature-entropy saturation curve defines the categories. Every pure fluid has primary characteristic points A, C and Z:

[[File:Classification of pure working fluids.gif|thumb|780px|right|Compatibility of traditional and novel classification of pure working fluids. The shape of the saturated vapour curve of the fluid depends on the specific isochoric (molar) heat capacity (c&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;) of that state via degrees of freedom (f) of the molecules.&lt;ref name="Groniewsky1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Groniewsky2"/&gt;]]

* Primary point A and Z are the lowest temperature points on the saturation liquid and saturation vapour curve respectively. This temperature belongs to the [[melting point]], which practically equals the [[triple point]] of the fluid. The choice of A and Z refers to the first and last point of the saturation curve visually.
* Primary point C refers to the [[Critical point (thermodynamics)|critical point]], which is an already well-defined [[Intensive and extensive properties|thermodynamic property]] of the fluids.
The two secondary characteristic points, namely M and N are defined as local entropy extrema on the saturation vapour curve, more accurately, at those points, where with the decrease of the saturation temperature entropy stays constant: d''s''/d''T''=0. We can easily realise that considering traditional classification, wet-type fluids have only primary (A,C and Z), dry-type fluids have primary points and exactly one secondary point (M) and redefined isentropic-type fluids have both primary and secondary points (M and N) as well. See figure for better understanding.

The ascending order of entropy values of the characteristic points gives a useful tool to define categories. The mathematically possible number of orderings are 3! (if there are no secondary points), 4! (if only secondary point M exists) and 5! (if both secondary points exist), which makes it 150. There are some physical constraints including the existence of the secondary points decrease the number of possible categories to 8. The categories are to be named after the ascending order of the entropy of their characteristic points. Namely the possible 8 categories are ACZ, ACZM, AZCM, ANZCM, ANCZM, ANCMZ, ACNZM and ACNMZ. The categories (also called sequences) can be fitted into the traditional three-class classification, which makes the two classification system compatible. No working fluids have been found, which could be fitted into ACZM or ACNZM categories. Theoretical studies &lt;ref name="Groniewsky1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Groniewsky2"/&gt; confirmed that these two categories may not even exist. Based on the database of [[NIST]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://webbook.nist.gov/chemistry/ NIST Chemistry WebBook]&lt;/ref&gt; the proved 6 sequences of the novel classification and their relation to the traditional one can be seen in the figure.

==Multicomponent working fluids==

Although multicomponent working fluids have significant thermodynamic advantages over pure (single-component) ones, research and application keep focusing on pure working fluids. However, there are some typical examples for multicomponent based technologies such as [[Kalina cycle]] which uses [[water]] and [[ammonia]] mixture, or [[absorption refrigerator]]s which also use water and ammonia mixture besides water, ammonia and [[hydrogen]], [[lithium bromide]] or [[lithium chloride]] mixtures in a majority. Some scientific papers deal with the application of multicomponent working fluids in Organic Rankine cycles as well. These are mainly binary mixtures of hydrocarbons, fluorocarbons, hydrofluorocarbons, siloxanes and inorganic substances.&lt;ref name="Angelino"&gt;Angelino, Gianfranco and Colonna di Paliano, Piero (1998) [https://doi.org/10.1016/S0360-5442(98)00009-7 "Multicomponent Working Fluids For Organic Rankine Cycles (ORCs)"] ''Energy'' 23 (1998) 449-463.&lt;/ref&gt;
