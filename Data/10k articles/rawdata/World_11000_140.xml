      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4906">'''Account stacking''' is a [[Broadcasting|broadcast]] industry term, which refers to the [[System deployment|deployment]] of subscription [[Direct broadcast satellite|Direct To Home]] (DTH) [[satellite]] receiving equipment at multiple geographical locations under a single customer account. It is often referred to as 2nd address service, subscription sharing or account splitting.
 
Account stacking is sometimes confused with satellite TV [[hacker (computer security)|hacking]] and [[piracy]] but in fact, account stacking utilizes receiving apparatus which is legal in every material respect.
 
A contentious issue exists since the receiving equipment is easily relocated and most DTH satellite providers prefer to charge a subscription fee on a per dwelling basis, much like [[cable-TV]], and not on a per-receiver or per-customer basis.
 
----
'''CRTC - Broadcasting Distribution Regulations'''
 
In Canada, DTH satellite providers are licensed by the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission|CRTC]] as Broadcast Distribution Undertakings, or BDU's for short. The regulations under which they are authorized to provide service are found in the CRTC's Broadcasting Distribution Regulations.
 
1. Under the regulations a "customer" means a person who is liable for payment for programming services that are distributed by a [[licensee]] and that are received directly or indirectly by one or more subscribers. 
 
2. A "subscriber" is a household of one or more persons, whether occupying a single-unit dwelling or a unit in a multiple-unit dwelling, to which service is provided directly or indirectly by a licensee.
 
3. A significant distinction exists between cable TV providers and DTH providers. The 'utility distribution model' used for cable TV does not readily apply to DTH undertakings. Cable TV is provided on a 'per dwelling' basis since it a closed-circuit wire-line service whereas DTH satellite is provided on a 'per customer' basis since the radio waves used for distribution cover a continent-wide area.

4. The CRTC broadcast distribution regulations seem to favour the 'per customer' model and sanction "account stacking".

5. The CRTC has a policy in place to accommodate the marketing and billing practice of “account stacking” under its Broadcast Distribution Regulations. This is discussed in Broadcast Public Notices 2006-133 and 2006-134, which provides that ‘discretionary service' channel providers are to be paid a wholesale affiliation fee on a ‘per dwelling’ basis. Basic service channel providers do not receive affiliation fees and so are not affected by this "Account Stacking" policy.

----
'''Radiocommunication Act (Canada)'''

9. (1) No person shall (c) decode an [[encrypted]] subscription programming signal or encrypted network feed otherwise than under and in accordance with an authorization from the lawful distributor of the signal or feed.

10. (1) Every person who (b) without lawful excuse, manufactures, imports, distributes, leases, offers for sale, sells, installs, modifies, operates or possesses any equipment or device, or any component thereof, under circumstances that give rise to a reasonable inference that the equipment, device or component has been used, or is or was intended to be used, for the purpose of contravening section 9.

Comment:

Section 10(1)(b) of the Radiocommunication Act is not there to convict persons who have obtained the statutory authorization to decode an encrypted subscription-programming signal pursuant to Section 9(1)(c).

Statutory authorization exists when the lawful distributor makes its signal available on payment of a subscription fee or other charge.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3523">The '''African Company of Merchants''' or '''Company of Merchants Trading to Africa''' was a [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] [[Chartered Company]] operating from 1752 to 1821 in the [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]] area of modern [[Ghana]]. This coastal area was dominated by the indigenous [[Fante people]]. It was established by the [[African Company Act 1750]], and in 1752 replaced the [[Royal African Company]]. The latter had been established in 1660.&lt;ref name="Barbary Captive"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Adams|first1=Robert|last2=Adams|first2=Charles|title=The Narrative of Robert Adams, A Barbary Captive: A Critical Edition|date=2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The assets of the Royal African Company were transferred to the new company and consisted primarily of nine trading posts or [[factory (trading post)|factories]]: [[Fort William, Ghana|Fort William]], [[Fort James (Ghana)|Fort James]], [[Fort Sekondi]], [[Fort Winneba]], [[Fort Apollonia]], [[Fort Tantumquery]], [[Fort Metal Cross]], [[Fort Komenda]], and [[Cape Coast Castle]], the last of which was the administrative centre.&lt;ref name="Barbary Captive"/&gt;

==African Committee==
The Company was managed by the African Committee, which was composed of nine committee members, three each from [[London]], [[Liverpool]] and [[Bristol]]. These were elected from the general body of traders from these cities, who paid 40 shillings to be admitted to the company. The company was funded by an annual grant approved by parliament, which covered the costs of the London office and the forts. The Committee had to report to the [[Exchequer]], the [[Admiralty]] and, from 1782, the [[Secretary at War]].&lt;ref name="Barbary Captive"/&gt; [[John Shoolbred]] [[FRSE]] was secretary to the committee for several years.

In 1807, the Imperial government prohibited the African slave trade after 1807, although the Company continued to operate for some years afterwards. In keeping with the ethos of liberal reform, administrative authority over the African Company's territory was transferred to Governor [[Charles MacCarthy (governor)|Charles MacCarthy]] of [[Sierra Leone]], Sierra Leone having been founded as a refuge colony for freed slaves. (Governor McCarthy was subsequently killed in the First [[Anglo-Asante War]].) In 1817, the Company signed a treaty of friendship recognising the [[Asante Empire|Asante]] claims to sovereignty over large areas of the coast, including areas claimed by the Fante. However, after it became public knowledge that Company had failed to suppress the African slave trade within its privately held territory, the British government abolished the Company once and for all in 1821. Slavery as an institution, however, continued to exist throughout the British Empire until 1834.

The '''Amung''' (also known as '''Amungme''', '''Amuy''', '''Damal''' or '''Uhunduni''') people are a group of about 17,700 people living in the highlands of the [[Papua (Indonesia)|Papua]] province of [[Indonesia]]. Their language is called [[Damal language|Damal]].

The traditional beliefs of the Amungme people are [[animistic]]. The Amungme people did not have the idea of "gods" that are separate from nature where spirits and nature are one and the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author =Craig A. James|title=The Religion Virus|year=2010|publisher=John Hunt Publishing|isbn=1-8469-4272-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They practice [[shifting agriculture]], supplementing their livelihood by [[Hunter-gatherer|hunting and gathering]]. The Amungme are very tied to their [[ancestral land]] and consider the surrounding mountains to be sacred.

This has led to friction with the Indonesian government, which is eager to exploit the vast [[mineral]] deposits contained there. Major changes in the Amungme of the highlands and Kamoro of the lowlands lifestyle have been brought about by the [[Grasberg mine]], situated in the heart of Amungme territory and owned by [[Freeport-McMoRan]], the region's largest single employer. Extensive [[gold]] and [[copper]] mining have altered the landscape, and the presence of the mine and its infrastructure has attracted numerous other economic migrants from western Indonesia as well as other Papuans, some of whom have tried to settle on traditional Amungme lands. This has caused land dispute regarding customary land rights between the Amungme people against Freeport Indonesia mining company in [[Timika]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=August Kafiar |author2=Tom Beanal |title=PT. Freeport Indonesia Dan Masyarakat Adat Suku Amungme|year=2000|publisher=Forum Lorentz|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the last 35 years, the Amungme have seen their sacred mountain destroyed by the mine, and watched as their relatives are killed by Indonesian soldiers "defending" it, while the Kamoro have more than 200,000 tons of waste pumped into their rivers each day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author =Jeremy Seabrook|title=Consuming Cultures: Globalization And Local Lives|year=2004|publisher=New Internationalist|isbn=1-9044-5608-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; All these factors have created complex social and political stresses, and led to somewhat frequent protests and/or social conflicts, some of which have been violently suppressed by the Indonesian police or military.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors =Monash University.

{{Life in the Arab League}}
The '''Arab Union''' is a proposed concept of a [[political union]] of the [[Arab world|Arab states]]. The term was first used when the [[British Empire]] promised the [[Arabs]] a united independent state in return for [[Arab Revolt|revolting]] against the [[Ottoman Empire]], whom Britain was [[Middle Eastern theatre of World War I|at war with]]. It never came to fruition following the [[Sykes–Picot Agreement]]. Despite this, many in the Arab world have since called for the creation of a '''pan-Arab state'''. [[President of Egypt|Egyptian President]] [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] made several unsuccessful attempts to unite [[Egypt]] with other Arab countries (including [[Iraq]], [[North Yemen]] and [[Syria]]). Similar attempts were made by other [[Arab leaders]], such as [[Hafez al-Assad]], [[Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr]], [[Faisal I of Iraq]], [[Muammar Gaddafi]], [[Saddam Hussein]], [[Gaafar Nimeiry]] and [[Anwar Sadat]].

In the 2004 [[Arab League]] summit in [[Cairo]], [[President of Yemen|Yemeni President]] [[Ali Abdullah Saleh]] proposed the creation of an Arab Union replacing the Arab League for a stronger political and geographical body, capable of dealing with world issues. However, the proposal failed to reach the League's agenda until the 2009 summit in [[Doha]], when it was decided that it will be looked into and discussed.

'''Burkhart Waldecker'' (born August 19, 1902 in [[Hagen]] – died 1964) was a German explorer who, in 1937, discovered the most southern source of the [[White Nile]] in Burundi.&lt;ref name="travguide"&gt;{{cite book|title=Traveler's Guide to the Belgian Congo and Ruanda-Urundi|date=1956|publisher=Tourist Bureau for the Belgian Congo and Ruanda-Urundi|page=72|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=5T0UAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=Burkhart+Waldecker+white+nile&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X|accessdate=September 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Waldecker came to the area to seek asylum from [[Nazi]] persecution. The true source is near [[Rutovu]], where a pyramid was erected in 1938. Waldecker's name is seen on the plaque, which says in Latin, "Caput Nili," thus ending man's long quest to discover the source. The Nile river has various sources, Waldecker found the [[White Nile]]'s most southern source which is part of the [[Kagera River]], the other being [[Lake Kyoga]] in Uganda further north. The small pipe flowing with the first Nile water appears from the ground below the summit of [[Mount Kikizi]] where the pyramid is found. 

The explorer missionary [[David Livingstone]] tried for many years to find the source of the Nile without success.

{{Politics of Chad}}

The '''Chadian National Union''' ({{lang-fr|Union Nationale Tchadienne}}, UNT) was a radical Muslim political party in [[Chad]].

==History==
The party was founded in 1958 by Issa Dana, Mahamut Outman and [[Abba Siddick]]. Created to lobby the "no" vote to the [[Chadian constitutional referendum, 1958|referendum]] on Chad's entry in the [[French Community]], the party advocated drastic political reforms, to be achieved if necessary through violence. The party was banned in 1962 when the president [[François Tombalbaye]] proclaimed the [[Chadian Progressive Party]] sole legal party. It survived as a clandestine organization under the leadership of [[Ibrahim Abatcha]].

In 1966 the party merged with the General Union of the Children of Chad to form the [[FROLINAT|National Liberation Front of Chad]] (FROLINAT).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.content.eisa.org.za/old-page/chad-defunct-parties Chad: Defunct parties] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150409055303/http://www.content.eisa.org.za/old-page/chad-defunct-parties |date=April 9, 2015 }} EISA&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Det kgl. octr. Søe-Asseurance Compagni was granted a monopoly on [[marine insurance]] in Denmark in 1829. In the middle of the century, its monopoly  was challenged by [[Niels Ryberg]] and other major merchants.&lt;ref name=coneliand&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coneliand.dk/Danmarks%20aeldste%20forretninger/DAEF%20400-499/Side_492_Prip_-_Prov.html|title=De Private Assurandører Aktieselskab. |language=Danish|website=coneliand.dk|accessdate=26 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

De private Assurandeurer wqs founded by a group of private operators on 1 March 1786. Prominent participants in the company included I. Erichsen, [[Niels Brock]], F[[rederik de Coninck]], [[Josef Hambro]], [[A. N. Hansen]] and [[C. F. Tietgen]]. [[Lauritz Nicolai Hvidt]] was part of the management. His son, Eduard Julius Hvist, joined the management in 1831 (alongside J. F. Wessely) and members of the Hvidt family would play central roles in the company for more than a hundred years.

From 1924, De private Assurandeurer was also active in the market for fire insurances.The company was converted into a limited company (''[[aktieselskab]]'') in 1046. The company was based at [[Palægade]] 2. Peter Leth (born 1901) was CEO of the company in 1950.

'''Dinguiraye''' is a small town in northern [[Guinea]], known for its large [[mosque]] which until recently was [[thatched]]. As of 2014 it had a population of 47,250 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geohive.com/cntry/guinea.aspx |title=Guinea |publisher=Institut National de la Statistique, Guinea, accessed via Geohive |accessdate=27 August 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151124030052/http://www.geohive.com/cntry/guinea.aspx |archivedate=24 November 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Mosquée de Dinguiraye.jpg|thumb|left|Mosquée de Dinguiraye ca. 1900]]
The town and its mosque hold special historical importance; [[El Hadj Umar Tall]] founded the [[Toucouleur Empire]] in the city and initially made it his capital. Al-Hadj Umar also built the city's large mosque at this time and the city served as a staging ground for his 1850 jihad.&lt;ref&gt;Histoire d'Afrique: les enjeux de mémoire, Jean-Pierre Chrétien, Jean-Louis Triaud

{{nihongo|'''''Dōshūsei'''''|道州制}} is a proposal to organize Japan into one [[Circuit (administrative division)|circuit]] of [[Hokkaido]] (''dō'') and several new [[Federated state|states]] (''shū'') that are each a combination of several [[Prefectures of Japan|prefectures]]. The states and circuit are proposed to have greater regional autonomy, similar to the [[United Kingdom]]. It was first proposed{{When|date=August 2012}} by the [[Junichiro Koizumi]] administration, but has yet to materialize.

Most of the political parties in 2012 support this reform.

A '''Franco-British Union''' is a concept for a union between the two [[independence|independent]] [[sovereign state]]s of the [[United Kingdom]] and [[France]].  Such a union was proposed during certain crises of the 20th century; it has some historical precedents.

==Historical unions==

===England and France===

{{main|Angevin Empire}}
{{further|Norman conquest of England|Hundred Years War}}
Ties between France and the Kingdom of [[England]] have been intimate since the [[Norman Conquest]], in which the Duke of [[Normandy]], an important French fief, became King of England, while also owing feudal ties to the French crown.

The relationship was never stable, and it only endured as long as the French crown was weak.  From 1066 to 1214, the King of England held extensive fiefs in northern France, adding to Normandy the counties of [[Maine (province)|Maine]], [[Anjou]], and [[Touraine]], and the Duchy of [[Brittany]]. After 1154, the King of England was also Duke of [[Aquitaine]] (or [[Guienne]]), together with [[Poitou]], [[Gascony]], and other southern French fiefs dependent upon Aquitaine. Together with the northern territories, this meant that the King of England controlled more than half of France – the so-called [[Angevin Empire]] – though still nominally as the King of France's [[vassal]]. The centre of gravity of this composite realm was generally south of the English channel; four of the first seven kings after the Norman Conquest were French-born, and all were native speakers of French.  For centuries thereafter the royalty and nobility of England were educated in French as well as English. In certain respects, England became an outlying province of France; English law took the strong impress of local French law, and the English language itself was saturated with French words.

This anomalous situation came to an end with the [[Battle of Bouvines]] in 1214, when King [[Philip II of France|Philip of France]] deposed King [[John, King of England|John of England]] from his northern French fiefs; in the chaos that followed, the heir to the throne of France, later [[Louis VIII of France|Louis VIII]], was offered the throne of England by rebellious English barons from 1216 to 1217 and travelled there to take it. He was proclaimed King of England in St. Paul's Cathedral, where many nobles, including King [[Alexander II of Scotland]], paid him homage. He captured [[Winchester]] and soon controlled over half the kingdom, but after the death of King John his support dwindled and he was forced to make peace, renouncing his claim to the throne. England was ultimately able to retain a reduced [[Guienne]] as a French fief, which was retained and enlarged when war between the two kingdoms resumed in 1337.

From 1340 to 1360, and from 1369 on, the King of England assumed the title of "King of France"; but although England was generally successful in its war with France, no attempt was made to make the title a reality during that period of time.

The situation changed with [[Henry V of England|Henry V]]'s invasion of France in 1415.  By 1420, England controlled northern France (including the capital) for the first time in 200 years. The [[Charles VI of France|King of France]] was forced to disinherit his own son, the  [[Charles VII of France|Dauphin Charles]], in favour of Henry V.  As Henry predeceased the French king by a few months, his son [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]] was proclaimed king of England and of France from 1422 by the English and their allies but the Dauphin retained control over parts of central and southern France and claimed the crown for himself. From 1429 the Dauphin's party, including Joan of Arc, counterattacked and succeeded in crowning him as king.

Fighting between England and France continued for more than twenty years after, but by 1453 the English were expelled from all of France except [[Calais]], which was lost [[Siege of Calais (1558)|in 1558]]. England also briefly held the town of [[Dunkirk]] in 1658–1662. The Kings of England and their successor Kings of Great Britain, purely as a habitual expression and with no associated political claim, continued to use the title "King of France" until 1801; the heads of the [[House of Stuart]], out of power since 1688, used the title until their extinction in 1807.

===Scotland and France===
{{further|Auld Alliance}}
Norman or French culture first gained a foothold in Scotland during the [[Davidian Revolution]], when King [[David I of Scotland|David I]] introduced Continental-style reforms throughout all aspects of Scottish life: social, religious, economic and administrative. He also invited immigrant [[French people|French]] and [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-French]] peoples to Scotland. This effectively created a Franco-Scottish aristocracy, with ties to the French aristocracy as well as many to the Franco-English aristocracy. From the [[Wars of Scottish Independence]], as common enemies of England and its ruling [[House of Plantagenet]], Scotland and France started to enjoy a close diplomatic relationship, the [[Auld Alliance]], from 1295 to 1560. From the [[Late Middle Ages]] and into the [[Early Modern Period]] Scotland and its [[burgh]]s also benefited from close economic and trading links with France in addition to its links to the Low Countries, Scandinavia and the Baltic.

The prospect of dynastic union came in the 15th and 16th centuries, when [[Margaret Stewart, Dauphine of France|Princess Margaret]], eldest daughter of [[James I of Scotland]], married the future [[Louis XI of France]]; and later the King of Scotland, [[James V of Scotland|James V]], married two French brides in succession.  His infant daughter, [[Mary, Queen of Scots|Mary I]], succeeded him on his death in 1542. For many years thereafter the country was ruled under a regency led by her French mother, [[Mary of Guise]], who succeeded in marrying her daughter to the child [[Francis II of France|Dauphin Francis]], who thus took the title of "King of Scots"; when he succeeded as King of France in 1559, France and Scotland were tentatively united in a kind of [[personal union]].  Had Francis survived to have a son with Mary, their child would have become king of both France and Scotland (and, perhaps, later of [[England]] as well); but in fact, Francis died in 1560, and Mary returned to a Scotland heaving with political revolt and religious revolution, which made a continuation of the alliance impossible.

Cordial economic and cultural relations did continue however, although throughout the 17th century, the Scottish establishment became increasingly [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]], often belligerent to [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]], a facet which was somewhat at odds with [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]]'s aggressively Catholic foreign and domestic policy. The relationship was further weakened by the [[Union of the Crowns]] in 1603, which meant from then on that although still independent, executive power in the Scottish government, the Crown, was shared with the Kingdom of England and Scottish foreign policy came into line more with that of England than with France.

==Modern concepts==

===''Entente cordiale'' (1904)===
In April 1904 the United Kingdom and the [[Third French Republic]] signed a series of agreements, known as the ''[[Entente Cordiale]]'', which marked the end of centuries of intermittent conflict between the two powers, and the start of a period of peaceful co-existence. Although French historian [[Fernand Braudel]] (1902–1985) described England and France as a single unit,{{cn|date=June 2016}} nationalist political leaders from both sides were uncomfortable with the idea of such a merging.

===World War II (1940)===
In December 1939, [[Jean Monnet]] of the French Economic Mission in London became the head of the [[Anglo-French Coordinating Committee]], which coordinated joint planning of the two countries' wartime economies. The Frenchman hoped for a postwar [[United States of Europe]] and saw an Anglo-French political union as a step toward his goal. He discussed the idea with [[Neville Chamberlain]], [[Winston Churchill]]'s assistant [[Desmond Morton (civil servant)|Desmond Morton]], and other British officials.{{r|shlaim197407}}

In June 1940, [[French Prime Minister]] [[Paul Reynaud]]'s government faced imminent defeat in the [[Battle of France]]. In March, they and the British had agreed that neither country would seek a [[separate peace]] with [[Nazi Germany]]. The [[French cabinet]] on 15 June voted to ask Germany for the terms of an armistice. Reynaud, who wished to continue the war from [[French North Africa|North Africa]], was forced to submit the proposal to [[Churchill War Ministry|Churchill's War Cabinet]]. He claimed that he would have to resign if the British were to reject the proposal.&lt;ref name="shlaim197407"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shlaim|first=Avi|title = Prelude to Downfall: The British Offer of Union to France, June 1940 | journal = Journal of Contemporary History | date=July 1974 |volume=9 |series=3 |pages=27–63 |jstor= 260024|doi = 10.1177/002200947400900302}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British opposed a French surrender, and in particular the possible loss of the [[French Navy]] to the Germans, and so sought to keep Reynaud in office. On 14 June British diplomat [[Robert Vansittart, 1st Baron Vansittart|Robert Vansittart]] and Morton wrote with Monnet and his deputy [[René Pleven]] a draft "Franco-British Union" proposal. They hoped that such a union would help Reynaud persuade his cabinet to continue the war from North Africa, but Churchill was sceptical when on 15 June the British War Cabinet discussed the proposal and a similar one from [[Secretary of State for India]] [[Leo Amery]]. On the morning of 16 June, the War Cabinet agreed to the French armistice request on the condition that the French fleet sail to British harbors. This disappointed Reynaud, who had hoped to use a British rejection to persuade his cabinet to continue to fight.{{r |shlaim197407}}

Reynaud supporter [[Charles de Gaulle]] had arrived in London earlier that day, however, and Monnet told him about the proposed union.{{r|shlaim197407}} De Gaulle convinced Churchill that "some dramatic move was essential to give Reynaud the support which he needed to keep his Government in the war".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last =Gates|first=Eleanor M.|year=1981|title=End of the Affair: The Collapse of the Anglo-French Alliance, 1939–40 |publisher=George Allen &amp; Unwin|location=London|isbn= 0-04-940063-0|page= 230}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Frenchman then called Reynaud and told him that the British prime minister proposed a union between their countries, an idea which Reynaud immediately supported. De Gaulle, Monnet, Vansittart, and Pleven quickly agreed to a document proclaiming a joint citizenship, [[customs union|foreign trade]], [[single currency|currency]], war cabinet, and military command. Churchill withdrew the armistice approval, and at 3 p.m. the War Cabinet met again to consider the union document. Despite the radical nature of the proposal, Churchill and the ministers recognized the need for a dramatic act to encourage the French and reinforce Reynaud's support within his cabinet before it met again at 5pm.{{r |shlaim197407}}

The final "Declaration of union" approved by the British War Cabinet stated that{{r |shlaim197407}}
{{quote |France and Great Britain shall no longer be two nations, but one Franco-British Union. The constitution of the Union will provide for joint organs of defence, foreign, financial and economic policies. Every citizen of France will enjoy immediately citizenship of Great Britain, every British subject will become a citizen of France.}}

Churchill and De Gaulle called Reynaud to tell him about the document, and they arranged for a joint meeting of the two governments in [[Concarneau]] the next day. The declaration immediately succeeded in its goal of encouraging Reynaud, who saw the union as the only alternative to surrender and who could now cite the British rejection of the armistice.{{r |shlaim197407}}

Other French leaders were less enthusiastic, however. At the 5 p.m. cabinet meeting, many called it a British "last minute plan" to steal [[French colonial empire|its colonies]], and said that "be[ing] a Nazi province" was preferable to becoming a [[British dominion]]. [[Philippe Pétain]], a leader of the pro-armistice group, called union "fusion with a corpse". While [[French President|President]] [[Albert Lebrun]] and some others were supportive, the cabinet's opposition stunned Reynaud. He resigned that evening without taking a formal vote on the union or an armistice, and later called the failure of the union the "greatest disappointment of my political career".{{r |shlaim197407}}

Reynaud had erred, however, by conflating opposition to the union—which a majority of the cabinet almost certainly opposed—with support for an armistice, which it almost certainly did not. If the proposal had been made a few days earlier, instead of the 16th when the French only had hours to decide between armistice and North Africa, Reynaud's cabinet might have considered it more carefully.{{r |shlaim197407}}

Pétain formed a new government that evening, which immediately decided to [[Armistice of 22 June 1940|ask Germany for armistice terms]]. The British cancelled their plans to travel to Concarneau.{{r |shlaim197407}}

===Suez Crisis (1956)===
In September 1956, due to a common foe during the [[Suez Crisis]], an [[Suez Crisis|Anglo-French Task Force]] was created.  French Prime Minister [[Guy Mollet]] proposed a union between the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[French Union]] with [[Elizabeth II]] as [[head of state]] and a common citizenship.  As an alternative, Mollet proposed that France join the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]]. British Prime Minister [[Anthony Eden]] rejected both proposals and France went on to join the [[Treaty of Rome]], which established the [[European Economic Community]] and strengthened the [[Franco-German cooperation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/expat/expatfeedback/4202596/France-offered-to-merge-with-UK-in-1950s.html | location=London | work=The Telegraph | title= France offered to 'merge' with UK in 1950s | first =Laura | last= Clout | date= 5 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/markets/europe/article1293250.ece | location= London | work = The Times | title=S’il vous plat can we be British too | first= Charles | last= Bremner | date= 16 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/jan/16/france.past|title=Incroyable, but true ...

===Frangleterre (2007)===
When the Mollet proposal was first made public in the United Kingdom on 15 January 2007 through an article by Mike Thomson published on the BBC News website,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6261885.stm | title = When Britain and France nearly married | first = Mike | last = Thomson | publisher = BBC | newspaper = News | date = January 15, 2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt; it received rather satirical treatment in the media of both countries, including the name, coined by the [[BBC]], of '''Frangleterre''' (merging "France" with ''Angleterre'', which is the French word for "England"). The UK broadcaster stated that Mollet's proposal originated from newly declassified material, arguing no such archive documents exist in France.

On 16 January 2007, during a [[La Chaîne parlementaire|LCP]] television programme, French journalist Christine Clerc asked former [[Minister of the Interior (France)|French Interior Minister]] [[Charles Pasqua]] ([[Gaullist]]) about Mollet's 1956 proposal.  Pasqua answered, "if his demand had been made official, Mollet would have been brought to trial for [[high treason]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | language = French | url = http://www.lcpan.fr/emission.asp?seriemission=200039_____quest_devenu_le_gaullisme__16-01-2007_211190 | title = Où?

==In fiction==

The [[Lord Darcy (character)|Lord Darcy]] [[alternate history]] stories take place in a world where [[Richard I of England]] lived much longer than in the history we know and managed to unite England and France under his rule; by the 20th Century, '' Anglo-French''  is a common language spoken by the inhabitants on both sides of the Channel, and there is no doubt of their all being a single people.

{{Politics of Gabon}}

'''Parliamentary elections''' were held in [[Gabon]] on 17 December 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://psephos.adam-carr.net/countries/g/gabon/gabon2011.txt Gabonese Republic Legislative Election of 17 December 2011] Adam Carr&lt;/ref&gt; Amidst an opposition boycott, the ruling [[Gabonese Democratic Party]] (PDG) won a landslide victory; official results were announced on 21 December 2011, showing that the PDG won 113 out of 120 seats, the most it had won since the beginning of multiparty politics in the early 1990s. A few other parties won the handful of seats remaining: the [[Rally for Gabon]] (RPG) won three seats, while the [[Circle of Liberal Reformers]] (CLR), the [[Independent Centre Party of Gabon|Independent Centre Party]] (PGCI), [[Social Democratic Party (Gabon)|Social Democratic Party]] (PSD), and the [[Union for the New Republic]] (UPRN) won a single seat each.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipu.org/parline-e/reports/2115_E.htm Last elections] IPU&lt;/ref&gt;

Turnout was 34%, with many opposition supporters choosing to boycott.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-16299172 Gabon's coalition wins landslide victory] BBC News, 27 December 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gordil Airport''' {{airport codes|GDI|FEGL}} is an [[airstrip]] serving [[Gordil]], a village in the [[Vakaga]] prefecture of the [[Central African Republic]]. The airstrip is {{convert|5|km}} southeast of Gordil alongside the RN8 road in the northern part of [[Manovo-Gounda St. Floris National Park]].

The runway is unusable during the rainy season, and aircraft have to do steep departures and landings in order not to disturb the wildlife in the park. The east end of the runway overruns onto the RN8 road.

'''Gorica Bridge''' over the [[Osum]] river is a landmark in the city of [[Berat]], [[Albania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.unesco.org/events/gorica-bridge-speaks|title=The Gorica Bridge Speaks|work=UNESCO|accessdate=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

It is one of the oldest and most popular [[Ottoman empire|Ottoman]] bridges in [[Albania]]. It connects two parts of Berat,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.top-channel.tv/english/artikull.php?id=6712|title=Gorica bridge towards destruction - Top Channel|work=top-channel.tv|accessdate=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; was originally built from wood in 1780 and was rebuilt with stone in the 1920s.&lt;ref name="argophilia.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://argophilia.com/albania/bridge-of-gorica.html|title=Bridge of Gorica (Ura e Goricës)|work=argophilia.com|accessdate=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The seven-arch bridge is 129 metres (423 ft) long and 5.3 metres (17 ft) wide&lt;ref name="argophilia.com"/&gt; and is built about 10 metres (33 ft) above the average water level. The bridge was renovated in year 2015 by Bashkia Berat (the Municipality of Berat).

According to local legend, the original wooden bridge contained a dungeon in which a girl would be [[incarcerate]]d and starved to appease the spirits responsible for the safety of the bridge.

[[Malta]] has been involved with the Internet since the latter's early days.

The [[Internet]] [[country code]] [[top-level domain]] ([[ccTLD]]) for [[Malta]] is '''[[.mt]]''' and is sponsored by [[Network Information Centre Malta|NIC Malta]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nic.org.mt/about/ Network Information Centre Malta]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[.eu]] domain is also used, as it is shared with other European Union member states.

Currently [[Internet access]] is available to businesses and home users in various forms, including dial-up, cable, DSL, and wireless.

==Dial-up==

[[Dial-up Internet access]] was first introduced in Malta in the mid-1990s by various ISPs, including Keyworld, Video On-Line, Global Net, MaltaNet, and Waldonet.

This narrowband service has been almost entirely replaced by the new broadband technologies, and is generally only used as a backup.

==Broadband==

Commercial availability of broadband Internet in [[Malta]], through [[ADSL]] and [[cable Internet]], has existed since 2000, and is accessible from all areas of the island. Broadband connectivity has become very widespread on the island, with many households opting for a broadband connection.

ADSL bandwidth is received mainly through the [[Seabone Network]], [[Interoute]] and [[Telecom Italia]], operated by [[GO (Malta)|GO Plc]] and [[Vodafone Malta|Vodafone Malta Ltd]], whilst there is another connection operated by Melita Plc

The bandwidth is then sold to the various [[ISP]]s which in turn sell it to customers.

December 2005, [[DataStream]] merged with the ISP Maltanet, giving Maltanet a competitive edge over other ISPs. Both DataStream and Maltanet were subsidiaries of Maltacom, the national telephone company, which is now integrated into one company called [[GO (Malta)|GO Plc]] (https://web.archive.org/web/20080629151212/http://www.go.com.mt/).

Cable Internet is offered by only one ISP, Melita Plc. Melita - Internet (formerly branded as OnVol) is a division of the cable and digital television provider, Melita Plc. Melita - Internet also offer standard ADSL connections for businesses.

In Q3 2007 Vodafone launched a fixed WiMAX based offering for Internet access. This increased the competition in Malta. However, since Q2/Q3 of 2011, this has been discontinued due to unsatisfactory results with the reliability of the WiMAX system, and is no longer offered to new customers.

In 2010 Melita (http://www.melita.com) launched the fastest internet service in Malta at 100Mbit/s. Melita also held the highest upload speed at the time with 4Mbit/s, which has today been matched mainly thanks to advances in telephone copper delivered internet through new technologies such as vDSL.

{{History of Burundi|expanded=civil war}}
The '''Itaba massacre''' was, according to [[Amnesty International]], the "[[massacre]] of between 173 and 267 unarmed civilians, many of them women, children and the elderly, who were deliberately and unlawfully killed in the [[Commune of Itaba]], [[Gitega Province]], [[Burundi]] on 9 September 2002".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/afr16/005/2003/en/]  &lt;/ref&gt; The killings were carried out by members of the [[Military of Burundi|armed forces of Burundi]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xaviermissionaries.org/M_Life/NewsArchive/AfricaNews/Bur_ItabaShock.htm]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071116145439/http://www.xaviermissionaries.org/M_Life/NewsArchive/AfricaNews/Bur_ItabaShock.htm |date=November 16, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Burundian authorities blamed the deaths on cross fire between government forces and the [[National Council for the Defense of Democracy – Forces for the Defense of Democracy]] (CNDD-FDD). Human rights groups{{Who|date=October 2014}} have stated that civilians were deliberately targeted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grandslacs.net/doc/2561.pdf|title=Grand Slacs|publisher=Grandslacs.net|accessdate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the [[European Union]] called for an independent inquiry into the killings after criticising the judicial proceedings of a military court which found two officers guilty of failing to obey orders. They were sentenced to four months in prison, and released, having already served that time since their arrest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publicinternationallaw.org/docs/PNW3/PNW.11March_03.htm]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040825175926/http://www.publicinternationallaw.org/docs/PNW3/PNW.11March_03.htm |date=August 25, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

They were one of seven original tribes that made up the [[Kimek confederation]]. They originated from the Central Asian steppes.

The Lanikaz were one of seven original tribes that made up the Kimek confederation, along with the Imur{{sfn|Agajanov|1992|p=69}}/Kimek{{sfn|Kimball|1994}}, Imak{{sfn|Agajanov|1992|p=69}}/Yamak{{sfn|Kimball|1994}}, Tatar, Kipchak, [[Bayandur]] and [[Ajlad]].&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvnb|Agajanov|1992|p=69}} and {{harvnb|Kimball|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kimek tribes originated in the Central Asian steppes, and had migrated to the territory of present-day [[Kazakhstan]].{{sfn|Agajanov|1992|p=69}} The Lanikaz, as part of the Kimek, were mentioned by [[Gardizi]].{{sfn|Bosworth|2017}} Their ethnonym may be derived from ''alan-i-kaz(ar)'' meaning "[[Khazar]] [[Alans]]".{{sfn|Róna-Tas|1997|p=194}}

[[Yury Zuev|Y. Zuev]] calls the spelling "Lanikaz" an 'obviously distorted name of the Kimek tribe in the Gardizi list', and corrects it to '''Laktan''', which Zuev further links to Middle Chinese 駱駝 ''*lɑk̚  dɑ'' "[[Bactrian camel|camel]]". Zuev observes that [[Twenty-Four Histories|Chinese annals]] contain a 'number of messages about congratulatory visits of Kimeks-Laktans to [[Chang'an]], attesting to the political importance of this tribe. They do not contain any other information.' The location of the Kimek Laktan area, before the Kimek's return to the area of [[Irtysh River|Black Irtysh]], in the Chinese annals is described as east from the lake [[Lake Hulun|Külün]] on the northern left bank of the river [[Argun River (Asia)|Argun]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Yury Zuev|Yu.

Membership of the [[United Nations]] [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] is held by the five [[Permanent members of the United Nations Security Council|permanent members]] and ten elected, non-permanent members. Prior to 1966, there were six elected members, while the permanent members have in essence not changed since the creation of the United Nations in 1945, apart from the [[China and the United Nations|representation of China]]. Elected members hold their place on the Council for a two-year term, and half of these places are contested each year. To ensure geographical continuity, a certain number of members is allocated for each of the five [[United Nations Regional Groups|UN regional groupings]].

In addition, one of the non-permanent members of the council is an [[Arab country]], alternately from the African or Asia-Pacific groups. This rule was added to the system in 1967 for it to be applied beginning with 1968.

Each year the [[United Nations General Assembly|UN General Assembly]] elects five new members for a two-year term; these elections always begin in October of the year, and continue until the two-thirds majority for the number of countries for each region has been reached. Re-election is allowed, but the term must not be consecutive.

==Previous and future Security Council composition==
From 1946 to 1965, the security council included six non-permanent members. The regional grouping at that time was:
* [[Latin America]]: 2 members
* [[Commonwealth of Nations]]: 1 member
* [[Eastern Europe]]: 1 member
* [[Middle East]]: 1 member
* [[Western Europe]]: 1 member
There were some exceptions to this grouping: [[Liberia]] took the place of a Western European country in 1961; the [[Ivory Coast]] substituted a member of the Commonwealth in 1964–1965; and the Eastern Europe group included Asian countries from 1956.

As part of a proposed expansion of the Security Council, Brazil, Germany, India and Japan, collectively the ''Group of 4'' or ''[[G4 nations]]'', are seeking permanent representation on this body. [[Italy]] opposed the expansion of the Security Council through the establishment of the group [[Uniting for Consensus]].

== List by number of years as Security Council member ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Japan]] --&gt;
This list contains the 130 United Nations member states so far elected to the United Nations Security Council, including the five permanent members, all listed by number of years each country has so far spent on the UNSC. Of all the members, 6 have so far ceased to exist, leaving the list with 124 modern nations. These, combined with the 69 modern nations that have never been elected to the UNSC to date (see [[List of members of the United Nations Security Council#Non-members|Non-members, below]]), make up the entirety of the [[Member states of the United Nations|193 current members of the UN]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4834">[[File:Malta 1922 One Pound.jpg|thumb|right|Melita depicted on a £1 stamp designed by Edward Caruana Dingli issued on 28 August 1922]]

'''Melita''' is the [[national personification|personification]] of [[Malta]] or the [[Maltese people]]. The name originated from the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] town of [[Melite (ancient city)|Melite]] (Μελίτη, ''Melite'' in [[Ancient Greek]]), which was the ancient capital of Malta which eventually developed into [[Mdina]] or Città Notabile.

The symbolic depiction of a country as a woman called by the Latin name of that country was common in the 19th Century (such as [[Britannia]], [[Germania (personification)|Germania]], [[Hibernia (personification)|Hibernia]] and [[Helvetia]]).

==Stamps==
[[File:Auberge de Provence Ceiling Valletta.JPG|thumb|left|Ceiling painting of Melita at [[Auberge de Provence]]]]
Melita has been portrayed a number of times on Maltese [[Postage stamps and postal history of Malta|postage]] or [[Revenue stamps of Malta|revenue stamps]]. She appeared on 4 February 1899 on a [[Half crown (British coin)|2/6]] stamp designed by an unknown Malta Post Office official. She is shown wearing a helmet and a garment, while holding a sword in one hand and a shield in the other. The flags of Malta and of the Order of Saint John appeared behind her. This stamp was in use for many years until the 1920s. Special printings of this stamp were overprinted for revenue use from 1902 to 1908.

A different version of Melita was used for the 1922 definitive set designed by Edward Caruana Dingli. The design shows Melita wearing a [[Chiton (costume)|garment]] over a [[breastplate]] showing the [[Maltese Cross]], as well as a helmet and sandals. She is holding a [[rudder]] representing the Maltese in control of Malta's destiny. This was done because Malta had just achieved self-government a year before, and the stamps were commemorating this event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Melita Issue of Malta Stamps: 1922-26|url=http://www.bephila.com/articles/melita-issue-of-malta-stamps-1922-26|website=British Empire Philately|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170316113650/http://www.bephila.com/articles/melita-issue-of-malta-stamps-1922-26|archivedate=16 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This design was featured as a [[Stamps on stamps|stamp-on-stamp]] in 2011, and it is considered as one of Malta's most beautiful stamps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Commemorative Stamp Issue - 90th  Anniversary of the Malta Senate and  Legislative Assembly|url=https://www.maltaphilately.com/Content/Images/PDFs/Commemorative%20Stamp%20Issue.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170316025224/https://www.maltaphilately.com/Content/Images/PDFs/Commemorative%20Stamp%20Issue.pdf|archivedate=16 March 2017|publisher=[[MaltaPost]]|date=1 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The shilling values in this set used a different design by Gianni Vella. The Vella design showed two symbolic figures, a man representing Britain, holding a shield with the Union Jack and with his left hand resting on Melita, who is holding an olive branch. The design symbolized the protection and good relations between the two countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bonavia|first1=Carmel|title=Stamps marking Malta’s constitutional development|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20111204/life-features/Stamps-marking-Malta-s-constitutional-development.397019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170316113420/http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20111204/life-features/Stamps-marking-Malta-s-constitutional-development.397019|archivedate=16 March 2017|work=[[Times of Malta]]|date=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Banknotes==
Edward Caruana Dingli's Melita design was reused for the fifth series Maltese banknotes issued by the [[Central Bank of Malta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Maltese Identity|url=http://www.centralbankmalta.org/updates/downloads/pdfs/euro_themese.pdf|publisher=[[Central Bank of Malta]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140918063432/http://centralbankmalta.org:80/|archivedate=18 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This series was issued between 1989 and 2000 and remained in use until 2008 when Malta adopted the [[Euro]].

'''Pacific International Lines''' ('''PIL''') is a [[shipping company]] incorporated in [[Singapore]] in 1967. The founder of PIL is the Chinese entrepreneur [[Chang Yun Chung]].

==Description==
The company originally operated only two ships, but constantly expanded to finally celebrate its first 50 years of history in 2017, and ranking within the first 10 largest container shipping lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://alphaliner.axsmarine.com/PublicTop100/|title=PublicTop100|website=Alphaliner.axsmarine.com|accessdate=5 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fleet is composed of 160 vessels with a capacity of 447,000 TEUs, while waiting for additional 13 new ships to be delivered within end of 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.portcalls.com/pil-takes-delivery-11800teu-box-ships/|title=PIL takes delivery of 11,800-TEU box ships - PortCalls Asia - Asian Shipping and Maritime News|website=Portcalls.com|accessdate=5 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It employs over 18,000 staff globally, regularly serving about 500 ports in nearly 100 countries worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/business/companies-markets/pil-ready-to-move-up-to-become-b-division-player|title=PIL ready to move up to become 'B-division' player|date=16 March 2017|website=Straitstimes.com|accessdate=5 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As forerunner in IT improvements, '''PIL''' has implemented a [[blockchain]] supply platform to share established data with [[DP World]] - [[Port of Singapore]] via [[IBM]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://worldmaritimenews.com/archives/245431/pil-psa-ibm-conclude-blockchain-trial-from-chongqing-to-singapore/|title=PIL, PSA, IBM Conclude Blockchain Trial from Chongqing to Singapore|website=Worldmaritimenews.com|accessdate=5 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 PIL and [[COSCO]] have entered into a mutual chartering agreement, to supply and exchange vessels during shipping demand peak times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hellenicshippingnews.com/cosco-shipping-announces-chartering-agreement-with-pil/|title=Cosco Shipping Announces Chartering Agreement with PIL - Hellenic Shipping News Worldwide|website=Hellenicshippingnews.com|accessdate=5 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2015, PIL partially took over the ownership of Singapore's [[Mariana Express Lines]] (MELL). According to the deal, PIL has assumed the majority shareholding. Since then, MELL has continued to operate under its own brand and pre-existing business, as agreed internally at the time of the purchase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://worldmaritimenews.com/archives/155661/pil-takes-majority-stake-in-mariana-express-lines/|title=PIL Takes Majority Stake in Mariana Express Lines|website=Worldmaritimenews.com|accessdate=5 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hamza Sultan palace''' is located in the Husuli village of [[Lachin]] district, [[Azerbaijan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://karabakhmedia.az/main/7981-qondarma-prezident-saakyan-hemze-sultan-sarayinda-lachindan-son-goruntuler.html karabakhmedia.az]&lt;/ref&gt;

Historical documents provide information that palace was erected in the year of 1761. Although the palace was a large complex, only one palace building has remained till the modern period.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.virtualkarabakh.az/read.php?lang=2&amp;menu=47&amp;id=167#.WVzUVYTyjIU www.virtualkarabakh.az] Karabakh monuments
&lt;/ref&gt;

The doors and windows of the palace had been made of walnut. Oriental architectural traditions had been widely used in the construction of the building.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.virtualkarabakh.az/read.php?lang=2&amp;menu=47&amp;id=167#.WVzUVYTyjIU www.virtualkarabakh.az] Karabakh monuments

'''''Romance de Amour''''' 1加1等于3 is a Chinese drama serial in [[Singapore]] aired in 2003. It has 30 episodes. The title is based on the French "romance d'amour" meaning a ballad or song of love.  Jacelyn Tay sings the theme song of the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = 2003 - 1加1等于3 - 主题曲 ( Romance De Amour ) Mediacorp| url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsYtwRM5EXA|date = 5 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The show stars [[Li Nanxing]], [[Aileen Tan]], [[Jacelyn Tay]], Pan Lingling, [[Lin Meijiao]], [[Rayson Tan]], Huang Shinan, [[Patricia Mok]] and Zhang Wei.

==Story==
''Romance de Amour'' is set against a beauty centre operated by three good friends ([[Aileen Tan]], [[Jacelyn Tay]] and [[Pan Lingling]]). Viewers will get to see how these three good friends get embroiled in various relationship problems and how each reacts to it.

[[Aileen Tan]] plays Kang Li, a beautiful and elegant lady who is successful in her career; however her love life is a mess. She has been involved with a mature, caring and successful man, Huang Weide ([[Li Nanxing]]) for seven years. They also have a daughter aged seven together. However, Weide is married to Xu Fangning ([[Lin Meijiao]]) whose family is powerful and rich. Realizing that Weide will not divorce his wife, Kang Li decides to end the affair for good and starts seeing Zheng Xuelun ([[Qi Yuwu]]). Just when the turmoil surrounding the love triangle finally subsides, Kang Li is diagnosed with cancer, already in its terminal stages. Upon hearing that, Weide gives up everything to stay by Kang Li's side, much to his wife's discontentment. Unable to bear the thought of losing her husband to a dying woman, Fangning plots her revenge.

The other lead in this drama is Qinghui ([[Jacelyn Tay]]), a capable, attractive woman with good business acumen. However, where affairs of the heart are concerned, she has her reservations about men and like Kang Li, she is secretly in love with another man (Huang Weide). On the other hand, Huishi ([[Pan Lingling]]) is the 'family and husband come first' type of woman. She is blessed with 2 children (a girl and a boy) and a caring and loving husband, Qipeng ([[Rayson Tan]]). On a night of drunken merrymaking during a business trip, Qipeng ends up sleeping with Qinghui. Later Huishi finds out about this and all hell breaks loose in her marriage with Qipeng.

One fighting for her life, one fighting to keep her family together and one ends up betraying her friend. How will it turn out for the three friends who were once happily running their beauty centre?

==Nominations==
The show was nominated as Best Drama Serial. Aileen Tan and Jacelyn Tay were both nominated as Best Actress and [[Lin Meijiao]] was nominated as Best Supporting Actress during the [[Star Awards 2003]] but none received an award.&lt;ref&gt;[[Star Awards#Drama .E6.88.8F.E5.89.A7]]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of systems of '''transport in the Comoros'''.  The [[Comoros]] possesses {{convert|880|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} of road, of which {{convert|673|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} are paved.  It has three seaports: [[Fomboni]], [[Moroni, Comoros|Moroni]] and [[Moutsamoudou]], but does not have a merchant marine, and no longer has any railway network.  It has four airports, all with paved runways, one with runways over {{convert|2438|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} long, with the others having runways shorter than {{convert|1523|m|0|abbr=on}}.

The isolation of the Comoros had made air traffic a major means of transportation. One of President Abdallah's accomplishments was to make the Comoros more accessible by air. During his administration, he negotiated agreements to initiate or enhance commercial air links with Tanzania and Madagascar. The Djohar regime reached an agreement in 1990 to link Moroni and Brussels by air. By the early 1990s, commercial flights connected the Comoros with France, Mauritius, Kenya, South Africa, Tanzania, and Madagascar. The national airline was Air Comores. Daily flights linked the three main islands, and air service was also available to Mahoré; each island had airstrips. In 1986 the republic received a grant from the French government's CCCE to renovate and expand [[Prince Said Ibrahim International Airport|Hahaya airport]], near Moroni. Because of the absence of scheduled sea transport between the islands, nearly all interisland passenger traffic is by air.

More than 99% of freight is transported by sea. Both Moroni on Njazidja and Mutsamudu on Nzwani have artificial harbors. There is also a harbor at Fomboni, on Mwali. Despite extensive internationally financed programs to upgrade the harbors at Moroni and Mutsamudu, by the early 1990s only Mutsamudu was operational as a deepwater facility. Its harbor could accommodate vessels of up to eleven meters' draught. At Moroni, ocean-going vessels typically lie offshore and are loaded or unloaded by smaller craft, a costly and sometimes dangerous procedure. Most freight continues to be sent to Kenya, Reunion, or Madagascar for transshipment to the Comoros. Use of Comoran ports is further restricted by the threat of cyclones from December through March. The privately operated Comoran Navigation Company (''Société Comorienne de Navigation'') is based in Moroni, and provides services to Madagascar.

Roads serve the coastal areas, rather than the interior, and the mountainous terrain makes surface travel difficult.
