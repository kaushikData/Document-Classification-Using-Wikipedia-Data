The '''A146''' is an [[Great Britain road numbering scheme|A road]] that connects [[Norwich]] in [[Norfolk]] and [[Lowestoft]] in [[Suffolk]], two of [[East Anglia]]'s largest population centres. It is around {{convert|27|mi|km}} in length and has primary classification along its entire route. It is mainly single carriageway throughout its route, with the exception of a section of dual carriageway on the southern edge of Norwich.

==Route description==
The A146 begins in [[Norwich]] before passing through a mainly rural area on its route to the eastern edge of [[Lowestoft]].

=== Norwich ===
The A146 starts to the south of Norwich city centre as part of the city ring road. It begins at a junction with the [[A140 road|A140]] [[Ipswich]] Road&lt;ref name=bingnorwich&gt;[http://binged.it/1ltsPUE Bing maps - Norwich], Microsoft, 2015. Retrieved 2015-11-17.&lt;/ref&gt; and forms a section of the ring road which is approximately {{convert|1.5|mi|km}} long, running to the east where it reaches a junction with the [[A1054 road|A1054]].&lt;ref name=osmap134&gt;''Landranger Sheet 134 - Norwich &amp; the Broads'', [[Ordnance Survey]] 1:50 000 sheet, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=google&gt;[https://www.google.com/maps/@52.5529231,1.5367183,11z Google maps], Google, 2015. Retrieved 2015-11-17.&lt;/ref&gt; The A146 then runs south-easterly out of the city, a direction it generally continues in for the rest of its route, initially as a section of dual carriageway around {{convert|1|mi|km}} in length, crossing the main [[Great Eastern Main Line|Norwich to London railway line]] and the [[River Yare]] and bypassing the village of [[Trowse]]. The road passes under the [[A47 road|A47]] southern bypass with junctions controlled by traffic lights allowing access to and from the A47 and reaches a junction with the B1332, the former northern terminus of the [[A144 road|A144]].&lt;ref name=osmap134 /&gt;&lt;ref name=oldmap&gt;[http://maps.nls.uk/geo/explore/#zoom=11&amp;lat=52.5601&amp;lon=1.4804&amp;layers=11 Ordnance Survey One-inch to the mile, Seventh Series, 1955-1961], available at the [[National Library of Scotland]]. Retrieved 2015-11-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the construction of the southern bypass the A146 began in the centre of Norwich and ran through Trowse.

=== Norwich to Beccles ===
[[File:The Stockton Stone - Glacial Erratic - geograph.org.uk - 1955643.jpg|thumb|right|The Stockton Stone with the A146 in the background]]
After leaving Norwich the A146 returns to a single carriageway and runs through a rural section towards the town of [[Beccles]] on the [[Norfolk]]-[[Suffolk]] border. It passes through the parish of [[Hellington]] before reaching the village of [[Thurton]] where a {{convert|40|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} speed limit is in force. After passing the grounds of [[Langley School, Loddon|Langley School]] it then bypasses the village of [[Chedgrave]] and the market town of [[Loddon, Norfolk|Loddon]], crossing the [[River Chet]] in the process. The route formerly passed through both of these settlements.&lt;ref name=oldmap /&gt;

The road then passes the edge of the village of [[Hales]] at the junction of the B1136 for [[Great Yarmouth]]. Between Hales and [[Stockton, Norfolk|Stockton]] several old stretches of the route can be seen in what are now laybys. It then reaches the [[A143 road|A143]] at a roundabout with the route to [[Bungay]] going west. The road briefly becomes the A143 for around {{convert|1|mi|km}} before another roundabout on the northern edge of [[Gillingham, Norfolk|Gillingham]] where the A143 continues to the north-east towards Great Yarmouth. A service station and fast food restaurant are located at this junction.&lt;ref name=osmap134 /&gt;

The road then bypasses Gillingham and crosses the [[River Waveney]], passing into Suffolk, before reaching the northern edge of the market town of Beccles at a roundabout with the [[A145 road|A145]].&lt;ref name=osmap134 /&gt; It formerly passed through Gillingham and crossed the Waveney at the narrow Beccles Old Bridge before passing through the town and [[Worlingham]] to the east.&lt;ref name=oldmap /&gt;

=== Beccles to Lowestoft ===
The road passes to the north of Beccles and crosses the [[East Suffolk Line|Lowestoft to Ipswich]] railway line at a level crossing. It passes Beccles Common and to the north of [[Worlingham]], travelling now in a more easterly direction before rejoining its original route near the villages of [[North Cove]] and [[Barnby, Suffolk|Barnby]].&lt;ref name=oldmap /&gt; Both villages are bypassed to the south by the modern road before it reaches the edge of the Lowestoft built up area at [[Carlton Colville]]. A relief road, the A1145, links Carlton Colville with the centre of Lowestoft whilst the A146 continues east.&lt;ref name=osmap134 /&gt;

The road terminates at a junction with the A1117 in [[Oulton Broad]], just to the south of [[Oulton Broad South railway station]].&lt;ref name=binglow&gt;[http://binged.it/1X5HFwh Bing maps - Oulton Broad], Microsoft, 2015. Retrieved 2015-11-17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=osmap134 /&gt; The road previously ended at a junction with the [[A12 road (Great Britain)|A12]] in the centre of Lowestoft.&lt;ref name=oldmap /&gt;

==History==
The A146 formerly started in [[Norwich]] city centre and ran into the centre of [[Lowestoft]].&lt;ref name=oldmap /&gt; A range of improvements, including straightening of bends, have taken place over the years. [[Chedgrave]] and [[Loddon, Norfolk|Loddon]] were bypassed in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=loddonbypass&gt;[http://www.visitoruk.com/Norwich/loddon-C592-V30404.html Loddon], Welcome to Norwich, visitoruk. Retrieved 2015-11-18.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Beccles]], [[Worlingham]] and [[Gillingham, Norfolk|Gillingham]] are also bypassed with the [[River Waveney]] crossed by Beccles New Bridge, replacing a 19th century iron bridge which traffic used to have to cross in Beccles. The completion of the [[A47 road|A47]] Norwich southern bypass in 1992 created the dual carriageway section of the A146 on the edge of the city and bypassed the village of [[Trowse]].&lt;ref name=trowse12&gt;[http://www.broads-authority.gov.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0015/423141/Trowse_with_Newton_Character_Appraisal_2012_small.pdf Trowse with Newton Conservation Area Character Appraisal and Management Plan], [[South Norfolk District Council]], September 2012.

Retrieved 2015-11-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

The A146 historically ran from [[Oulton Broad]] into the centre of Lowestoft along the route of what is today the B1531.&lt;ref name=osmap134 /&gt;&lt;ref name=binglow /&gt;&lt;ref name=osmap1341997&gt;''Landranger Sheet 134 - Norwich &amp; the Broads'', [[Ordnance Survey]] 1:50 000 sheet, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; The route ran to the south of [[Lake Lothing]] and terminated just to the south of the [[bascule bridge]] at a junction with the [[A12 road (England)|A12]] immediately to the south of the entrance to the [[Port of Lowestoft]].&lt;ref name=oldmap /&gt;&lt;ref name=osmap1341997 /&gt;

==Transport links==
The route of the A146 passes near to [[Norwich railway station]] on the [[Great Eastern Main Line]] and both [[Beccles railway station]] and [[Oulton Broad South railway station]] on the [[East Suffolk Line]]. All stations are operated by [[Abellio Greater Anglia]]

The [[First Norfolk &amp; Suffolk]] X2 bus route also follows the road for much of its journey between Norwich and Lowestoft, serving all population centres on the route.&lt;ref name=x2route&gt;[http://www.firstgroup.com/uploads/maps/X2_Map.pdf X2] {{dead link|date=October 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}, First Norfolk &amp; Suffolk.

The '''Afghanistan Meteorological Authority''' is located in [[Kabul]], [[Afghanistan]]. The authority has been led by [[Abdul Qadeer]] since the late 1970s.

== History ==
In 1996, Taliban forces sacked its office because [[weather forecasting]] had been banned as it was considered to be [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Weather forecasting, banned by Taliban, makes a comeback in Afghanistan|last=Perreaux|first=Les|date=February 19, 2004|work=Canadian Press|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Equipment was ruined and over 100 years worth of weather records were destroyed. Because of the ban, [[farm]]ers were eventually harmed because drought information and forecasting could not take place.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} Also, in 1998, an [[Ariana Afghan Airlines]] flight flew into unexpected weather, causing it to crash into a mountain, killing 45 people.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

During the [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan|Soviet occupation of Afghanistan]], the Afghanistan Meteorological Authority had one of the most advanced weather stations available at the time and a staff of 600.

== Recovery ==
In 2003, [[France]] financed the installation of over a dozen simple [[weather station]]s around Afghanistan. The stations provide basic information such as temperature, barometric pressure, and rain fall. Also in 2003, the [[World Meteorological Organization]] in [[Geneva]] provided the Authority with copies of its lost records.

[[Canadians|Canadian]] troops at [[Camp Julien]] assist in collecting data by launching [[weather balloon]]s twice a day. The data is primarily for [[NATO]] and the armies of the [[United States|U.S.]] and [[Germany]], but it is shared with the AMA as well.

{{National Meteorological Organisations}}

Sep 2016... Perhaps Canadian troops launched the weather balloons for upper air soundings in the past.  But, today it is done by contract and NATO meteorologists working together at the Hamid Karzi International Airport on the NATO side of the complex.  NATO has a Combined Meteorological Unit that is staffed by a Romanian Officer in Charge, Czech Republic military, and U.S. and Turkish contractors.  The mission is to provide full services while the Afghans are trained to take over operations, which is in keeping with the NATO Resolute Support mission.  As stated above, the data is available anywhere in the world under the Kabul ICAO identifier which is OAKB.

'''Alignments of random points in the plane''' can be demonstrated by [[statistics]] to be [[counter-intuitively]] easy to find when a large number of [[randomness|random]] points are marked on a bounded flat surface.  This has been put forward as a demonstration that [[ley line]]s and other similar mysterious alignments believed by some to be phenomena of deep significance might exist solely due to chance alone, as opposed to the supernatural or anthropological explanations put forward by their proponents. The topic has also been studied in the fields of [[computer vision]] and [[astronomy]].

A number of studies have examined the mathematics of alignment of random points on the plane.&lt;ref&gt;"Alignments in Two-Dimensional Random Sets of Points"
David G. Kendall and Wilfrid S. Kendall
''Advances in Applied Probability''
Vol. 12, No. 2 (Jun., 1980), pp. 380-424
Published by: Applied Probability Trust

It allows the fact that real-world features are not mathematical points, and that their positions need not line up exactly for them to be considered in alignment. [[Alfred Watkins]], in his classic work on ley lines ''[[The Old Straight Track]]'', used the width of a pencil line on a map as the threshold for the tolerance of what might be regarded as an alignment. For example, using a 1&amp;nbsp;mm pencil line to draw alignments on a 1:50,000 [[Ordnance Survey]] map, the corresponding width on the ground would be 50 m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | isbn = 9780349137070 | title = The Old Straight Track: Its Mounds, Beacons, Moats, Sites and Mark Stones | last1 = Watkins | first1 = Alfred | date = 1988 | publisher = Abacus  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== An estimate of the probability of chance alignments ==
[[Contrary to intuition]], finding alignments between randomly placed points on a landscape gets progressively easier as the geographic area to be considered increases. One way of understanding this phenomenon is to see that the increase in the number of possible [[combination]]s of sets of points in that area overwhelms the decrease in the probability that any given set of points in that area line up.

One definition which expresses the generally accepted meaning of "alignment" is:
:''A set of points, chosen from a given set of landmark points, all of which lie within at least one straight path of a given width''

More precisely, a path of width ''w'' may be defined as the set of all points within a distance of ''w/2'' of a [[straight line]] on a plane, or a [[great circle]] on a sphere, or in general any [[geodesic]] on any other kind of [[manifold]].  Note that, in general, any given set of points that are aligned in this way will contain a large number of infinitesimally different straight paths.  Therefore, only the existence of at least one straight path is necessary to determine whether a set of points is an alignment. For this reason, it is easier to count the sets of points, rather than the paths themselves.
The number of alignments found is very sensitive to the allowed width ''w'', increasing approximately proportionately to ''w''&lt;sup&gt;''k''-2&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''k'' is the number of points in an alignment.

The following is a very approximate order-of-magnitude estimate of the likelihood of alignments, assuming a plane covered with uniformly distributed "significant" points.

Consider a set of ''n'' points in a compact area with approximate diameter ''L'' and area approximately ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Consider a valid line to be one where every point is within distance ''w''/2 of the line (that is, lies on a track of width ''w'', where ''w'' ≪ ''L'').

Consider all the unordered sets of ''k'' points from the ''n'' points, of which there are:

:&lt;math&gt;\binom nk = \frac {n!} {(n-k)!\,k!}&lt;/math&gt;

(see [[factorial]] and [[binomial coefficient]] for notation).

To make a rough estimate of the probability that any given subset of ''k'' points is approximately [[collinearity|collinear]] in the way defined above, let us consider the line between the "leftmost" and "rightmost" two points in that set (for some arbitrary left/right axis: we can choose top and bottom for the exceptional vertical case). These two points are by definition on this line. For each of the remaining ''k''-2 points, the probability that the point is "near enough" to the line is roughly ''w''/''L'', which can be seen by considering the ratio of the area of the line tolerance zone (roughly ''wL'') and the overall area (roughly ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).

So, the expected number of k-point alignments, by this definition, is very roughly:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac {n!} {(n-k)!\,k!} \left({\frac{w}{L}}\right)^{k-2}&lt;/math&gt;

Among other things this can be used to show that, contrary to intuition, the number of k-point lines expected from random chance in a plane covered with points at a given density, for a given line width, increases much more than linearly with the size of the area considered, since the [[combinatorial explosion]] of growth in the number of possible combinations of points more than makes up for the increase in difficulty of any given combination lining up.

A more precise expression for the number of 3-point alignments of maximum width ''w'' and maximum length ''d'' expected by chance among ''n'' points placed randomly on a square of side ''L'' is &lt;ref name=edmunds&gt;Edmunds, M.G. &amp; George, G.H., ''Random Alignment of Quasars'',  Nature, vol. 290, pages 481-483, 1981 April 9&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \mu = \frac {\pi } {3} \frac {w}{L} 
 \left( {\frac {d}{L}} \right)^{3} n \left( n-1 \right) 
 \left( n-2 \right) &lt;/math&gt;

If edge effects (alignments lost over the boundaries of the square) are included, then the expression becomes
:&lt;math&gt; \mu = \frac {\pi } {3} \frac {w}{L} 
 \left( {\frac {d}{L}} \right)^{3} n \left( n-1 \right) 
 \left( n-2 \right) 
 \left( 1 - \frac {3}{\pi } \left( \frac {d}{L} \right) 
 + \frac {3}{5} \left( \frac {4}{\pi } - 1 \right) 
 \left( \frac {d}{L} \right)^{2} \right) &lt;/math&gt;

A generalisation to ''k''-point alignments (ignoring edge effects) is&lt;ref name=george&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engr.mun.ca/~ggeorge/astron/thesis.html |title=Ph.D. Thesis of Glyn George: The Alignment and Clustering of Quasars|first = G.H |last= George | date=2003-08-03|accessdate=2017-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \mu = \frac {\pi n \left( n-1 \right) \left( n-2 \right)  
 \cdots \left( n - \left( k-1 \right) \right) } 
 {k \left( k-2 \right) !} \left( \frac {w}{L} \right)^{k-2} 
 \left( {\frac {d}{L}} \right)^{k}  &lt;/math&gt;
which has roughly similar asymptotic scaling properties as the crude approximation in the previous section, with combinatorial explosion for large ''n'' overwhelming the effects of other variables.

== Computer simulation of alignments ==
[[image:leylines.png|thumb|300px|right|607 4-point alignments of 269 random points]]
[[Computer simulation]]s show that points on a plane tend to form alignments similar to those found by ley hunters in numbers consistent with the order-of-magnitude estimates above, suggesting that ley lines may also be generated by chance.  This phenomenon occurs regardless of whether the points are generated pseudo-randomly by computer, or from data sets of mundane features such as pizza restaurants or telephone booths.

It is easy to find alignments of 4 to 8 points in reasonably small data sets with ''w'' = 50 m.
Choosing large areas or larger values of ''w'' makes it easy to find alignments of 20 or more points.

The '''B4E Business for the Environment Summit''' (commonly abbreviated as '''B4E''' or '''B4E Summit''') is an international platform for dialogue and partnership for the environment.

The acceleration and delivery of such transformative solutions will require a higher level of collaboration between business, government and NGOs than ever seen before. B4E aims to facilitate such collaboration through networking, informed discussion and the creation of innovative partnerships for change.

Issues addressed at the summits include energy, natural resource security, climate change, water management and biodiversity conservation, among others.

Past speakers at previous Summits include international luminaries like [[Ban Ki-moon]], [[Al Gore]], [[Helen Clark]] and [[Goran Persson]], the current Presidents of South Korea, Indonesia and Guyana, business leaders such as [[LG Electronics|Nam Yong]], [[Ben Verwaayen]], [[Jochen Zeitz]], [[Richard Branson|Sir Richard Branson]], Barbara Kux and renowned experts like [[David Suzuki]], [[Janine Benyus]] and [[Amory Lovins]] representing civil society. The Summits also involve international NGOs and agencies like [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]], [[Greenpeace]], the [[Rocky Mountain Institute]], the [[World Food Programme]] and [[United Nations Development Programme|UNDP]] in its inclusive dialogues.

Official outcome declarations from the Summit discussions reflect commitments from stakeholders on the need to embrace innovative solutions for environmental issues and are used to provide input to the [[Cop 16|UN Climate Change Conferences]] and [[United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development|Rio+]].

== History ==
Past B4E Summits were convened for the last five years in Singapore, Paris, Copenhagen during the [[COP 15]], Seoul, Mexico City, Cancún during the [[COP 16]] and Jakarta in partnership with the [[United Nations]], WWF, Global Initiatives and host Governments where the summits took place.

=== B4E Global Summit 2007 &amp; 2008 Singapore ===
The first and second B4E Summits were held in Singapore. The guest of honour at the event was Singapore’s then-Minister for National Development, Mah Bow Tan, and distinguished speakers included [[Achim Steiner]], Georg Kell, [[David Suzuki]], [[Maumoon Abdul Gayoom|H.E. Maumoon Abdul Gayoom]], [[Adam Werbach]] and Zhang Yue.&lt;ref name="B4E Singapore (SMU)"&gt;{{cite web|title=B4E: Caring for the Environment Can be Good for Business|url=http://knowledge.smu.edu.sg/article.cfm?articleid=1158|work=Knowledge@SMU|publisher=Knowledge@SMU|accessdate=20 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== B4E Global Summit 2009 Paris ===
Titled “The Green Imperative: Leadership, Innovation and Technology”, B4E Global Summit 2009 took place in Paris, France.
Notable speakers at the 2009 summit included [[Joseph Alcamo]],&lt;ref name="B4E Paris (Joseph Alcamo)"&gt;{{cite web|title=Green Business: A Key to Protecting Climate|url=http://www.unep.org/pdf/JosephAlcamo_B4E.pdf|work=UNEP|publisher=UNEP|accessdate=22 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity|Pavan Sukdev]] and [[Prince Hassan bin Talal|H.R.H. Prince El Hassan bin Talal]], as well as repeated appearances by [[Achim Steiner]] and Georg Kell.

=== B4E Global Summit 2010 Seoul ===
The B4E Global Summit returned to the Asian continent in 2010, and was held in Seoul, Republic of Korea. With addresses and presentations from [[Lee Myung-bak]], [[Al Gore]], [[Ban Ki-moon]], [[World Wide Fund for Nature|James Leape]] and numerous other dignitaries, international attention from the media, policy makers and industry was drawn to the event.&lt;ref name="B4E Seoul (Korea Times)"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kwon |first=Mee-yoo |title=Business Leaders to Gather in Seoul for B4E Summit |url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2010/04/113_64278.html |accessdate=20 June 2011 |newspaper=The Korea Times |date=15 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121004085854/http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2010/04/113_64278.html |archivedate=4 October 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="B4E Seoul (ecobiz writeup)"&gt;{{cite web|last=Tobias |first=Chris |title=B4E Summit: Energy critical to get right |url=http://www.eco-business.com/features/b4e-summit-energy-critical-get-right/ |work=Eco-Business.com |accessdate=22 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110419013747/http://www.eco-business.com/features/b4e-summit-energy-critical-get-right/ |archivedate=19 April 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== B4E Climate Summit 2010 Cancún ===
The Climate Summit at Cancún saw a greater and growing partnership between the Summit and international organisations such as [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]] and various UN agencies.&lt;ref name="B4E Cancun (Global Compact PDF)"&gt;{{cite web|title=B4E Climate Summit 2010 Statement (UN Global Compact)|url=http://www.unglobalcompact.org/docs/news_events/9.1_news_archives/2010_10_05/B4E_CLIMATE_SUMMIT_2010_Statement.pdf|work=UN Global Compact|publisher=UN Global Compact|accessdate=24 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The outcome statements were favourably viewed upon by industry and non-governmental observers as a feasible avenue for business, government and civil society to gather and discuss business-led targets and solutions for climate change.&lt;ref name="B4E Cancun (NYTimes)"&gt;{{cite news|last=Malkin|first=Elizabeth|title=Businesses Seek Clarity on Climate Goals|url=http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/10/06/businesses-seek-clarity-on-climate-goals/#more-74359|accessdate=21 June 2011|newspaper=NYTimes.com|date=6 October 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110713121007/http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/10/06/businesses-seek-clarity-on-climate-goals/| archivedate= 13 July 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="B4E Cancun (EL)"&gt;{{cite web|title=B4E Panel Discusses Solutions for a Low Carbon Future|url=http://www.environmentalleader.com/2010/10/13/b4e-panel-discusses-solutions-for-a-low-carbon-future/|work=Environmental Leader|accessdate=22 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== B4E Global Summit 2011 Jakarta ===
Recently concluded in Jakarta, Indonesia, the Global Summit in 2011 took ownership of its location in Jakarta to shift focus to forestry and agriculture, in conjunction with the [[International Year of Forests|UN International Year of Forests]]. A steering committee of business, governmental and civil representatives was formed and gathered first in January to engineer focused discussion panels for the actual Summit in April. The Jakarta Summit included notable speakers such as [[Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono]],&lt;ref name="B4E Jakarta (SBY)"&gt;{{cite news|last=Satriastanti |first=Fidelis E. |title=B4E Summit: Adviser Explains What SBY Meant by 'Balls' |url=http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/home/b4e-summit-adviser-explains-what-sby-meant-by-balls/438085 |accessdate=21 June 2011 |newspaper=Jakarta Globe |date=29 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120926193126/http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/home/b4e-summit-adviser-explains-what-sby-meant-by-balls/438085 |archivedate=26 September 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Helen Clark]]&lt;ref name="B4E Jakarta (IISD)"&gt;{{cite web|title=UNDP Administrator Addresses B4E Summit|url=http://climate-l.iisd.org/news/undp-administrator-addresses-b4e-summit/|work=Climate Change Policy &amp; Practice|accessdate=22 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[World Bank|Andrew Steer]].

[[File:JLP 2323-2.jpg|thumb|right|300px|upright=2|alt=bush encroachment at Waterberg Namibia|View of bush encroached land at the Waterberg Plateau Park in Otjozondjupa region, Namibia]]
'''''Bush encroachment''''' is a natural phenomenon characterised by the excessive expansion of bush at the expense of other plant species, especially grasses. Bush encroachment is estimated to affect up to 45 million ha of Namibian land and has severe negative consequences on key [[Ecosystem services]], especially agricultural productivity and groundwater recharge. Agricultural productivity in Namibia has declined by two thirds throughout the past decades, mainly due to the negative impact of bush encroachment. The phenomenon affects both commercial and communal farming in Namibia, mostly the central, eastern and north-eastern regions.&lt;ref name="Economist"&gt;{{cite web
|url=https://economist.com.na/13437/environment/bush-encroachment-must-be-curbed/
|title=Bush encroachment must be curbed
|publisher=Namibia Economist
|accessdate=23 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes ==
Various factors have been found to contribute to the process of bush encroachment. These include the reduction in the frequency of fires as well as overgrazing (e.g. caused by overstocking and fencing of farms). Another frequently cited theory is the state-and-transition model. This model outlines how rainfall and its variability is the key driver of vegetation growth and its composition. Further, climate change has been found to accelerate bush encroachment, as C02 in the air fosters bush growth.

== Bush Control ==
As bush encroachment has been recognised as a major challenge for agricultural productivity as well as a diverse range of ecosystem services, the Namibian government has declared bush control a priority in its fifth National Development Plan (NDP5).

The term Bush Control refers to actions that are targeted at controlling the density and composition of bushes and shrubs in a given area that is affected by bush encroachment. Three different categories of measures can be distinguished:

* Responsive measures (bush thinning): the reduction of bush densities through targeted bush harvesting or other forms of removal. 
* Maintenance measures (aftercare): repeated or continuous measures of maintaining the bush density and composition that has been established through bush thinning.
* Preventative measures (rangeland management practices): application of proven good rangeland management practices to prevent the excessive growth of woody species, e.g. through rotational grazing

Practices of combating bush encroachment, regardless of the exact methodology applied, are often referred to as "de-bushing". Although this term is widely used and also cited in various scientific works, it is disputed. "De-bushing" can easily be misunderstood as the practice of clearing and area of all bush plants, which is not the aim in most efforts to combat bush encroachment. The terms "bush control, "bush thinning" and "selective bush harvesting" are therefore considered more adequate terms.

== Government response ==

=== National Policy and Strategies ===
The [[Government of Namibia]] has recognised bush encroachment as a key challenge for the national economy and food safety. In its current National Development Plan 5, it stipulates that a total of 82.200 ha of land shall be treated against bush encroachment annually, i.e. through the thinning of the bush density by means of selective bush harvesting&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gov.na/documents/10181/14226/NDP+5/5a0620ab-4f8f-4606-a449-ea0c810898cc?version=1.0&lt;/ref&gt;

The Government of Namibia, through the Support to De-bushing Project, pursues a value addition strategy, promoting the sustainable utilisation of bush biomass, which in turn is expected to finance bush harvesting operations.

=== Bush Control and Biomass Utilisation Project (2014-2021) ===
Beginning of 2014, a dedicated project to develop strategies and concepts for countering bush encroachment was launched in cooperation between the governments of Namibia and Germany, initially called Support to De-bushing Project. It is implemented jointly by the Namibian Ministry of Agriculture, Water and Forestry (MAWF) and the German development agency [[Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit]]. Its first implementation phase ended in December 2017 and through bilateral negotiations the project was extended for a second phase, running between 2018 and 2021. The project was re-named to Bush Control and Biomass Utilisation Project to better reflect its strong emphasis on value chain development as trigger for sustainable bush control.

=== De-bushing Advisory Service ===
In early 2016, the De-bushing Advisory Service Namibia was launched. It is a public service institution, mandated with the dissemination of knowledge on the topics of bush encroachment, bush control and biomass utilisation.&lt;ref name="New Era"&gt;{{cite web

The De-bushing Advisory Service provides the following services:

* Technical advise on bush control and biomass utilisation
* Implementation assistance for bush control activities
* Environmental advise on bush thinning
* Strengthening of existing agricultural outreach services
* Research facilitation on bush encroachment
* Linkage between farmers and bush control service providers
* Facilitation of finance opportunities

Services are provided upon inquiry and are public service and therefore not charged.

== Economic Activity ==
Increasingly, the encroacher bush is seen as a resource for an extractive industry. Numerous farmers across the country, but increasingly also corporations from other sectors, harvest the bush with the intention process and sell it to off-takers.

=== Bush Based Products ===
The following products are currently produced from the encroacher bush biomass:
* Charcoal, mainly for export to South Africa and overseas markets (100.000 - 150.000 tonnes per annum)
* Wood chips for energy applications, currently at the [[Ohorongo Cement]] factory and at [[Namibia Breweries Limited]] (estimated 40.000 tonnes per annum)
* Wood briquettes mainly for private households, i.e. barbecuing or water heating
* Bush based animal feed production, on experimental basis on various farms, especially in response to severe fodder shortages during periods of drought
* Flooring/decking material, predominantly using [[Prosopis]]
* Wood carvings

=== Charcoal Production ===
Namibia has a well-established charcoal sector, which currently comprises approximately 600 producers, which employ a total of 5.000-6.000 workers. Currently, most producers are farmers, who venture into charcoal production as a means to combat bush encroachment on their own land. However, increasingly small enterprises also venture into charcoal making. As per national forestry regulations, charcoal can only be produced from encroaching species. In practice, it however proves difficult to ensure full compliance with these regulations, as the charcoal production is highly decentralised and the inspection capacities of the Directorate of Forestry are low.

In August 2016 the Namibia Charcoal Association (NCA) was launched. It is a non-profit entity and the official industry representation, currently representing an estimated two-thirds of all charcoal producers in the country.

=== Namibia Biomass Industry Group ===
Namibia Biomass Industry Group is a non-profit association under Section 21 of the Companies Act (Act 28 of 2004) of Namibia. The core objectives as enlisted in the Articles of Association of N-BiG are as follows:
* Develop market opportunities for biomass from bush encroachment
* Up-scale harvesting and supply capacities
* Address and resolve sector or industry bottlenecks, such as skills shortages and fundamental R&amp;D
* Create an environment for enabling policy and regulatory framework
* Provide administrative support to N-BiG subscribers and members, especially in the incubation phase of becoming a biomass supplier

N-BiG was founded in 2016 and functions as the umbrella representative body of the emerging bush based biomass sector in the country.

===De-bushing Advisory Service Namibia===
The De-bushing Advisory Service Namibia is a public service institution of the [[Government of Namibia]], mandated with the dissemination of knowledge on the topics of bush encroachment, bush control and biomass utilisation. It was initiated in response to the national crisis of accelerating bush encroachment especially on rangeland in vast areas of the country. It was founded in early 2016 and currently is part of the Namibian German bilateral Project on Support to De-bushing, implemented by [[Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit]]. It was created as part of the 4-year bilateral cooperation project between the Namibian and German governments. It serves as a central knowledge and capacity development platform for the topic of bush control, facilitating sustainable large-scale bush control in Namibia. Its services therewith fall into the areas of rangeland management and natural resource management. Bush encroachment impacts Namibia on a large scale. Up to 45 million hectares of farmland in nine of the country’s 14
regions are affected. This equals about one third of Namibia's land area.Bush encroachment has negative impacts on livestock, groundwater recharge, tourism and biodiversity. It lowers the
productivity and livestock capacity of pasture land by up to two thirds.

[[File:Europe topography map en.png|thumb|300px]]

The '''Central European Highlands''', in a broad sense, comprise the high mountains of the [[Alpine Mountains]] and the [[Carpathian Mountains]] systems along with mountainous ranges of medium elevation (between about 1000 and 2000&amp;nbsp;m a.s.l.), e.g. those belonging to the [[Bohemian Massif]], still prevailingly of mountainous character.

Both types of mountains act as ”water towers”. Their high [[elevation]] brings about high [[precipitation]] and low evaporation, and the resulting surplus of water balance feeds large European rivers and other important water sources. Beside the mountains, large areas of [[Central Europe]] are occupied by [[highlands]] or [[peneplain]]s of lower altitude (between 400 and 800&amp;nbsp;m) in which the surplus of annual [[water balance]] is less noticeable.

'''Chris Philo''' [[FAcSS]] (born 1960) is Professor of [[Geography]] at the Department of Geographical and Earth Sciences, the [[University of Glasgow]].

Philo graduated from the [[Sidney Sussex College]] of [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] and became a Research Fellow there. In 1989 he joined the Department of Geography at the [[University of Wales, Lampeter]], holding that post for six years, until 1995. He then joined the [[University of Glasgow]] as a Professor, becoming head of the department in 2002. In 2006 Chris was replaced as Head of Department by Professor Trevor Hoey and was enlisted on the Geography and Environmental Studies RAE Sub-Panel.

Traditionally his interests have been in the historical geographies of 'madness' and [[mental health]] and [[mental health care]] provision.  Later, he dabbled in the emerging, and increasingly significant, sub-discipline of [[animal geographies]].  A devotee of the work of [[Michel Foucault]], his research extended and localised [[Foucault's history of madness]] to England and Wales. Over a decade in the writing his major work was published by a minor press in Wales as ''A Geographical History of Institutional Provision for the Insane from Medieval Times to the 1860s in England and Wales: The Space Reserved for Insanity''. Always a generous collaborator, he has co-edited numerous general anthologies of [[human geography]]. Most recently, he has examined, with [[Eric Laurier]], [[coffee culture|cafe culture]] in [[Glasgow]].

The '''''Concours des villes et villages fleuris''''' ("towns and villages in bloom competition") is a contest organized annually in [[France]] which aims to encourage [[communes of France|communes]] to adopt and implement policies that improve the quality of life of their inhabitants and enhance their attractiveness to visitors through the provision and maintenance of green spaces and the enhancement of their natural environments. Successful communes are awarded the right to display a badge (showing from one to four flowers) on road signs and in other local promotional material. 

The competition was created in 1959 by the French state and it is administered by a distinct national committee since 1972. This committee is still linked to the Ministry of Tourism. All the French communes can take part and there are no application fees. There is not any limitation to the number of awarded communes, so they are not in competition between each other.

The label has experienced a large success since its creation. The number of villages taking part in the contest has increased from 600 at its inception, to 5,300 in 1972, 10,000 in 1993, and 12,000 in 2005.{{cn|date=September 2017}}

The label comprises four awards: one, two, three or four flowers, according to the efforts of the municipality. Each award is given according to strict criteria. The "Fleur d'Or" (''golden flower'') is a special prize awarded to a small number of applicants. Labelled communes display their flowers on road signs at their entrances.

As of 2015, there are some 12,000 awarded cities, towns and villages. They represent a third of all the French communes. 226 of them have 4 flowers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnvvf.fr/les_villes_et_villages_fleuris-47.html |title=Les villes et villages fleuris |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626121128/http://www.cnvvf.fr/les_villes_et_villages_fleuris-47.html |archivedate=2015-06-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Saint-Privé-FR-89-panneau d'agglomération-01.jpg|thumb|Road sign in [[Saint-Privé, Yonne|Saint-Privé]], [[Yonne]] (2 flowers).]]
The ''Concours des villes et villages fleuris'' originates in the various horticultural contests that appeared at the beginning of the 20th century. As tourism was growing, competitions were created for train stations and hotels for them to improve their visual quality. The French Touring Club created the first competition dedicated to villages during the 1920s. Called "Concours des villages coquets" (''cosy villages contest'') it existed until 1939. After the [[Second World War]], the Touring Club created an itinerary of flower-decked roads ("routes fleuries") together with the Horticultural Association and the magazine ''Rustica''. The success of the itinerary led to the creation of the present ''Concours des villes et villages fleuris'' in 1959. The competition passed from the French state to a national committee in 1972. Since 1988, its organisation has been the responsibility of the [[general councils (France)|general councils]] which are the elected assemblies of the [[departments of France|departments]]. The national comity remains the coordinator on a national level.&lt;ref name="Histoire"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnvvf.fr/un_peu_d_histoire-53.html|title=Un peu d'histoire|publisher=Concours des villes et villages fleuris}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principles==
At the beginning, the competition was about the aesthetics of green spaces and floral displays. Nowadays, it focuses more on general planning and how it improves the lives of local residents and the experience of visitors.&lt;ref name="Histoire"/&gt;

Communes that apply for the label are first selected by their [[departments of France|department]] which transmit the application to the [[regions of France|regional council]]. The latter attributes the lowest awards (1, 2 and 3 flowers). The best applications are then submitted to the national committee who can attribute the 4 flowers and extra awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnvvf.fr/la_demarche-30.html|title=La démarche|publisher=Villes et villages fleuris}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boards of examiners are formed on departmental, regional and national levels. Their members are usually municipal councilors, municipal clerks, horticulturists, gardeners, landscape architects, tourist office officials and representatives of various associations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnvvf.fr/le_jury-40.html|title=Le jury|publisher=Villes et villages fleuris}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criteria==
[[File:Bormes 044.jpg|thumb|[[Bormes-les-Mimosas]] (4 flowers).]]
[[File:20110830 Vannes (20).jpg|thumb|Garden in [[Vannes]] (4 flowers).]]
The ''Concours des villes et villages fleuris'' awards its labels according to strict criteria. They help examiners to evaluate the motivation of the local authorities, the development they expect through plants and green spaces, how they communicate to the public about it, how they respect the environment, and so forth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnvvf.fr/les_criteres-54.html|title=Les criteres|publisher=Villes et villages fleuris}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The evaluation grid comprises a number of questions which can be answered by "non existent", "initiated", "realised" and "conforted". The answer to each question determines a level between zero and four flowers. For instance, a question asks if the locality displays flowers and plants all year round; if it is initiated, it can pretend to one or two flowers, if it is realised, to three, and conforted four flowers. The average of all the answers moderated by the general impression of the examiners determine which label the locality is awarded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnvvf.fr/maj/phototheque/photos/pdf/2013-10-grilleevaluation-v-communes.pdf|title=Grille d'évaluation|publisher=Villes et villages fleuris}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International competition==
{{main|Entente Florale}}
The ''Concours des villes et villages fleuris'' has initiated a European competition called ''Entente Florale Europe'' ("Europe Floral Harmony"). It started in 1975 between [[Great Britain]] and [[France]] and has since expanded to include all members of the [[European Union]] and the [[European Free Trade Association|EFTA]]. As of 2015, [[Austria]], [[Belgium]], [[Croatia]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Germany]], [[Hungary]], the [[Republic of Ireland]], [[Italy]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Slovenia]] and the [[United Kingdom]] are full members of the Entente. During this annual competition, each country submits a candidate locality. The best one is awarded a prize.

'''Country codes''' are short alphabetic or numeric [[geography|geographical]] [[code]]s ([[geocode]]s) developed to represent [[country|countries]] and [[dependent area]]s, for use in [[data processing]] and [[communication]]s. Several different systems have been developed to do this.  The term ''country code'' frequently refers to international dialing codes, the [[E.164]] [[list of country calling codes|country calling codes]].

==ISO 3166-1==
{{main article|ISO 3166-1}}

This standard defines for most of the countries and dependent areas in the world:
*a two-letter ([[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]])
*a three-letter ([[ISO 3166-1 alpha-3]]), and
*a three-digit numeric ([[ISO 3166-1 numeric]]) code.

The two-letter codes are used as the basis for some other codes or applications, for example,
*for [[ISO 4217]] [[currency]] codes and
*with deviations, for country code [[top-level domain]] names (ccTLDs) on the Internet: [[list of Internet TLDs]].
For more applications see [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]].

==Other country codes==
*[[European Union]]:
**Before the [[Enlargement of the European Union|2004 EU enlargement]] the EU used the UN Road Traffic Conventions [[List of international license plate codes|license plate codes]]; since then, it uses [[ISO 3166-1]]
**The ''[[Nomenclature des unités territoriales statistiques]]'' (Nomenclature of territorial units for statistics, NUTS) of the [[European Union]], mostly focusing on subdivisions of the EU member states
*[[FIFA]] (Fédération Internationale de Football Association) assigns a three-letter code (dubbed FIFA Trigramme) to each of its member and non-member countries: [[List of FIFA country codes]]
*[[Federal Information Processing Standard]] (FIPS) [[FIPS 10-4|10-4]] defined two-letter codes used by the U.S. government and in the [[CIA World Factbook]]: [[list of FIPS country codes]]. On September 2, 2008, FIPS 10-4 was one of ten standards withdrawn by [[NIST]] as a Federal Information Processing Standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Federal Register |date= Sep 2, 2008 |volume= 73 |issue= 170 |page= 51276 |id= E8-20138 |url= https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2008/09/02/E8-20138/announcing-approval-of-the-withdrawal-of-ten-federal-information-processing-standards-fips |title= Announcing Approval of the Withdrawal of Ten Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

**[[ITU letter codes]] for member-countries,
**[[ITU prefix - amateur and experimental stations]] - The [[International Telecommunications Union]] (ITU) assigns national telecommuncation prefixes for [[amateur radio|amateur]] and experimental radio use, so that operators can be identified by their country of origin. These prefixes are legally administered by the national entity to which prefix ranges are assigned.

*[[North Atlantic Treaty Organisation]] (NATO) used two-letter codes of its own: [[list of NATO country codes]]. They were largely borrowed from the FIPS 10-4 codes mentioned below. In 2003 the eighth edition of the Standardisation Agreement (STANAG) adopted the ISO 3166 three-letter codes with one exception (the code for Macedonia). With the ninth edition, NATO is transitioning to four- and six-letter codes based on ISO 3166 with a few exceptions and additions
*[[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP) also has its own list of [[List of UNDP country codes|trigram country codes]]
* [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO): [[WIPO ST.3]] gives two-letter codes to countries and regional intellectual property organizations
*[[World Meteorological Organization]] (WMO) has its own list of country codes, used in reporting meteorological observations
* UIC (the [[International Union of Railways]]): [[UIC Country Code]]s

The developers of ISO 3166 intended that in time it would replace other coding systems in existence.

==Other codings==
The following can represent countries:
*The initial digits of International Standard Book Numbers ([[ISBN]]) are group identifiers for countries, areas, or language regions.

'''Dinara''' is a [[mountain]] located on the border of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and [[Croatia]]. It has two major [[pyramidal peak|peaks]]: [[Troglav (Bosnia and Herzegovina)|Troglav]] ("Threehead", 1913 m) and the eponymous Dinara (1831 m).&lt;ref name="2013 Yearbook"&gt;''Statistical Yearbook of the Republic of Croatia 2015'', p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; The peak called Dinara is the highest peak of [[Croatia]], is shaped like a human head made of stone, and also has a [[topographic prominence|prominence]] of 728 m.&lt;ref name="pb"&gt;[http://www.peakbagger.com/peak.aspx?pid=10325 "Dinara" on Peakbagger.com] Retrieved 1 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sites.google.com/site/europeaklist/Home/croatia Geography of Croatia on Europeaklist] Gives a topographic prominence of 728 based on an elevation of 1,831 m. Retrieved 1 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==

Its [[Latin]] name is ''Adrian oros'' while the current name is suspected to be derived from the name of an ancient [[Illyria]]n tribe that lived on the eastern slopes of the mountain.

It is best known for the fact that its name is the base for the name of a large mountain chain called the [[Dinaric Alps]] or ''Dinarides''. The Dinarides are known for being composed of [[karst]] &amp;mdash; [[limestone]] rocks &amp;mdash; as is the mountain that named them.

==Extent==

[[File:Dinara central.jpg|thumb|alt=Photograph of the section of the Dinara massif 1500 meters above sea level and up, including the Samograd outcropping, with its foothills and plain, all covered in snow, and a blue sky.|The central Dinara massif as viewed from Suho polje.]]

Dinara itself spans from the Derala [[mountain pass]] (965 m) in the northwest to the Privija pass (1230 m) which is 20&amp;nbsp;km to the southeast, where the [[Kamešnica (mountain)|Kamešnica Mountain]] begins. The Dinara Mountain is up to 10&amp;nbsp;km wide.

==Climate==

Dinara is located only a few dozen kilometers away from the [[Adriatic Sea]], and is part of the [[Dalmatia]]n [[Zagora (Croatia)|hinterland]], but the climate on Dinara is a much colder, [[mountain climate]], making it one of the coldest places in Croatia with average temperatures between 2 and 4&amp;nbsp;°C at the peaks.&lt;ref&gt;''Statistical Yearbook of the Republic of Croatia 2015'', p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; The average precipitation is high, while the number of sunny hours per year ranges between 1,700 and 1,900.&lt;ref&gt;''Statistical Yearbook of the Republic of Croatia 2015'', p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

There are no inhabited areas on the mountain itself and human presence consists mostly of small shacks that belong to the [[herder|herdsmen]] from the nearby valleys such as that of the [[Cetina]] river.

==Tourism==

One of the most fascinating [[massif]]s is on the southwestern slope. It is six kilometers long and up to 1700 meters high, providing an interesting landscape for the travelers on the roads in the valley below to view. The massif does not attract many [[climbing|climbers]], but its Ošljak peak (1706 m) does.

==Flora and fauna==
===Flora===
Native vegetation of the Dinara region comprises a large number of plant communities, or habitat types. According to the data available, in the area of the Dinara mountain there are around 750 plant species, of which more than 110 are strictly protected and 55 are endemics.

The flora consists of mountain grasslands, Scopoli's rockcress (''[[Arabidopsis arenosa]]'', ''[[Arabidopsis halleri]]'' and ''[[Arabidopsis croatica]]'', dinarian mouse ear ''[[Hieracium Pilosella]]'', dalmatian rockbell ''[[Edraianthus dalmaticus]]'', pasque flower ''[[Pulsatilla]]'',  lion's paw ''[[Leonotis leonurus]]'', yellow gentian ''[[Gentiana lutea]]'', common juniper ''[[Juniperus communis]]'' and hairy azalea ''[[Rhododendron]]''.

===Fauna===
====Birds====

In terms of ornithology, the Dinara region, particularly the peaks and the slopes of the Dinara mountain appertaining to it and the habitat around the Upper Cetina, from its source to the Peruća dam, is designated as a Special Protection Area (SPA) according to the EU Directive on the Conservation of Wild Birds.

The bird species include: common pheasant ''[[Phasianus colchicus]]'', common quail ''[[Coturnix coturnix]]'', shore lark ''[[Eremophila alpestris]]'', redshank ''[[Tringa totanus]]'', stone curlew ''[[Burhinus oedicnemus]]'', moustached warbler ''[[Acrocephalus melanopogon]]'', golden eagle ''[[Aquila chrysaetos]]'' and short-toed snake eagle ''[[Circaetus gallicus]]''. Also there is sighting of Eurasian griffon vulture ''[[Gyps fulvus]]'' probably on their flight over to [[Cres]].

====Mammals====
The mammals of the Dinara region are: brown bear [[Ursus arctos]], grey wolf [[Canis lupus]], Eurasian lynx [[Lynx lynx]], wildcat [[Felis silvestris]], red fox [[Vulpes vulpes]], wild boar [[Sus scrofa]], Eurasian badger [[Meles meles]], brown hare [[Lepus europaeus]] and balkan snow vole.
Dinara is host to an [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] species of [[rodent]], the [[Balkan Snow Vole|Balkan snow vole]] (''[[Dinaromys|Dolomys bogdanovi longipedis]]''), known in Croatian  as the {{lang|hr|Dinarski miš}} ("Dinara mouse"). It is an [[endangered species]].

====Insects====

The relatively well-preserved, extensive and diverse habitats of the Dinara and Svilaja mountains and the Upper Cetina provide a refuge to a number of invertebrate species whose natural habitats have been endangered due to specific living conditions they require, while many of them are endemics and placed on the Red List (certain species of caddisflies, dragonflies, stoneflies, orthoptera, etc.).

Invertebrates living in caves and holes make a special group – their biology remains relatively unknown, but they are protected as the cave fauna together with cave vertebrates.

Insects include: dalmatian ringlet [[Proterebia afra dalmata]], rosalia longicorn, longhorn beetle, firebug, hornet, bumblebee, stag beetle and marsh fritillary.

====Herpetology====

The herpetofauna of the Dinara region comprises around 15 species of lizards, snakes and amphibians, some of which are endangered, mostly due to the fact that their natural habitats have been either reduced in extent or suffered degradation.

The herpetofauna comprises: smooth snake, balkan whip snake, nose-horned viper, fire salamander, slow worm, karst meadow viper and alpine newt.

'''Ernst Behm''' (4 January 1830&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; 15 March 1884) was a [[Germany|German]] [[geographer]] and [[statistician]] who was a native of [[Gotha (town)|Gotha]].

Behm studied medicine and sciences at the Universities of [[University of Jena|Jena]], [[University of Berlin|Berlin]] and [[University of Würzburg|Würzburg]]. In 1856 he began work at ''Petermanns Geographischen Mitteilungen'' in [[Gotha]], a [[German language]] journal of [[geography]] founded by [[August Heinrich Petermann]] (1822-1878).

In 1866 he became editor of ''Geographische Jahrbuch'' (Geographic Annals), and from 1872, with [[Hermann Wagner (geographer)|Hermann Wagner]] (1840&amp;ndash;1929), edited the geographical/statistical review, ''Die Bevölkerung der Erde''. Starting in 1876 he headed the editorial staff of the statistical section of the ''Gothaischen Hofkalenders'', and in 1878, following the death of Petermann, he became editor of ''Petermanns Geographischen Mitteilungen''.

In 1872 Behm published an article (''Beweise für die Identität des Lualaba mit dem Congo''), which scientifically demonstrated that the [[Lualaba River|Lualaba]] was a [[headstream]] of the [[Congo River]]. This claim was later confirmed as factual by explorer [[Henry Morton Stanley]] in 1877.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5416">The '''geology of the [[Dominican Republic]]''' is part of the broader '''geology of [[Hispaniola]]''' with rocks formed from multiple island arcs, colliding with North America.

==Geologic History, Stratigraphy &amp; Tectonics==
The oldest rocks on the island formed beginning in the early [[Cretaceous]] through island arc plutonism. Before the [[Aptian]], the island was uplifted, particularly in the east, likely due to the collision of a volcanic island arc. In total, Hispaniola is formed from 11 distinct small island arcs. From the [[Albian]] to the [[Campanian]], plutonism, metamorphism and volcanism began simultaneously, taking place underwater on the largely submerged landmass. In the Campanian a second arc collision took place.
[[Picrite]] from the Duarte Complex in central Hispaniola has been inferred as Galapagos hotspot-type island plateau rocks.&lt;ref name="uchicago"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Is the Lower Duarte Igneous Complex (Hispaniola) a Remnant of the Caribbean Plume-Generated Oceanic Plateau? &amp;#124; The Journal of Geology: Vol 105, No 1|journal=The Journal of Geology|volume=105|pages=111–120|doi=10.1086/606151|year = 1997|last1 = Lapierre|first1 = Henriette|last2=Dupuis|first2=Vincent|last3=De Lépinay|first3=Bernard Mercier|last4=Tardy|first4=Marc|last5=Ruíz|first5=Joaquín|last6=Maury|first6=René C.|last7=Hernandez|first7=Jean|last8=Loubet|first8=Michel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cordillera Central in the middle of the island has obducted [[peridotite]] from the mid-Cretaceous on top of a [[mylonite]] and [[phyllonite]] [[schist]] shear zone in the Maimon Formation. Deformation appears in rocks north, as far as the volcanic and sedimentary Los Ranchos Formation. They are unconformably overlain by [[Albian]]-[[Cenomanian]] limestones.&lt;ref name="geoscienceworld"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article-abstract/24/12/1143/189703|title=Thrust emplacement of the Hispaniola peridotite belt: Orogenic expression of the mid-Cretaceous Caribbean arc polarity reversal? &amp;#124; Geology|journal=Geology|volume=24|issue=12|pages=1143|accessdate=2018-11-11|doi=10.1130/0091-7613(1996)024&lt;1143:TEOTHP&gt;2.3.CO;2|year=1996|last1=Draper|first1=Grenville|last2=Gutiérrez|first2=Gabriel|last3=Lewis|first3=John F.|hdl=10366/19389}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cenozoic (66 million years ago-present)===
Into the [[Paleogene]] at the start of the [[Cenozoic]], volcanism, metamorphism and plutonism continued underwater until the [[Eocene]], still largely below water. However, by the middle Eocene, the amalgamated island arcs collided with the southern margin of the North American Plate at the Florida-Bahama Platform, leading to the formation of extensive carbonates and the end of volcanism and plutonism. The island arc rocks became exposed above the water line and began to erode as an east-west strike-slip fault emerged.
From the [[Miocene]] to recent times, oblique strike-slip faults formed along the sutures between old island arcs as the island compressed against North America and oceanic plateau terranes. Nine large fault bounded mountain ranges formed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=dUICAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=geology+of+hispaniola#v=onepage&amp;q=geology%20of%20hispaniola&amp;f=falseM | title=Geologic and Tectonic Development of the North America-Caribbean Plate Boundary in Hispaniola| isbn=9780813722627| last1=Mann| first1=Paul| last2=Draper| first2=Grenville| last3=Lewis| first3=John F.| year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the Dominican Republic, the central Cordillera Septentrional spans the strike-slip fault boundary between the North American and Caribbean plates. Faults and folds from the [[Paleocene]] to the [[Pliocene]] in marine sedimentary rocks indicate its history of uplift, beginning in [[Eocene]] pelagic carbonates. Transpression in the Miocene-Pliocene created an [[anticline]] in shallow marine carbonates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=dUICAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA265&amp;dq=geology+of+dominican+republic#v=onepage&amp;q=geology%20of%20dominican%20republic&amp;f=false | title=Geologic and Tectonic Development of the North America-Caribbean Plate Boundary in Hispaniola| isbn=9780813722627| last1=Mann| first1=Paul| last2=Draper| first2=Grenville| last3=Lewis| first3=John F.| year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Natural resource geology==
The large Pueblo Viejo oxide gold deposit formed due to gold, quartz and pyrophyllite weathering in a small basin within the Los Ranchos Formation. At its basin, the formation has conglomerate, ascending to sandstone and carbonaceous sandstone with plant fossils indicating proximity to land.

There are four [[Governorate]]s in Bahrain; the [[Capital Governorate, Bahrain|Capital]], [[Northern Governorate|Northern]], [[Southern Governorate|Southern]] and [[Muharraq Governorate|Muharraq]]. There had previously been five until September 2014, when the [[Central Governorate, Bahrain|Central Governorate]] was abolished. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gulf-daily-news.com/NewsDetails.aspx?storyid=386389|title=The Gulf Daily News|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The first [[municipality]] in Bahrain was the 8-member Manama municipality which was established in July 1919.&lt;ref name=MMAUP&gt;{{Cite web|title=History of Municipalities |url=http://websrv.municipality.gov.bh/mun/pages/History_en.jsp |publisher=Ministry of Municipalities Affairs and Urban Planning – Kingdom of Bahrain |accessdate=5 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121213042316/http://websrv.municipality.gov.bh/mun/pages/History_en.jsp |archivedate=13 December 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Members of the municipality were elected annually; the municipality was said to have been the first municipality to be established in the [[Arab world]].&lt;ref name=MMAUP/&gt; The municipality was in charge of cleaning roads and renting buildings to tenants and shops. By 1929, it undertook road expansions as well as opening markets and [[slaughterhouse]]s.&lt;ref name=MMAUP/&gt; In 1958, the municipality started [[water purification]] projects.&lt;ref name=MMAUP/&gt; In 1960, Bahrain comprised four municipalities including ''Manama'', ''Hidd'', ''Al Muharraq'', and ''Riffa''.&lt;ref name=Statoids&gt;{{Cite web|title=Governorates of Bahrain|url=http://www.statoids.com/ubh.html|publisher=Statoids|accessdate=5 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Over the next 30 years, the 4 municipalities were divided into 12 municipalities as settlements such as [[Hamad Town]] and [[Isa Town]] grew.&lt;ref name=Statoids/&gt; These municipalities were administered from Manama under a central municipal council whose members are appointed by the king.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Bahrain Government |url=http://www.un.int/bahrain/government.html |publisher=Permanent Mission of the Kingdom of Bahrain to the United Nations |accessdate=5 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120603152143/http://www.un.int/bahrain/government.html |archivedate=3 June 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
After September 22nd, 2014, [[Bahrain]] was split into four [[governorate]]s. These governorates are:

The first municipal elections to be held in Bahrain after independence in 1971, was in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Three Polls, Three Different Approaches |url=http://www.theestimate.com/public/051702.html |publisher=The Estimate |accessdate=5 July 2012 |date=17 May 2002 |archivedate=3 October 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6B90vbRba?url=http://www.theestimate.com/public/051702.html |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most recent was in 2014.

==Constituencies==
[[File:Constituencies in Bahrain governorates.png|thumb|left|A map of the constituencies in Bahrain (2002-2014)]]
A specific number of adjacent [[city blocks]] are grouped together to form an area (listed as area 1, area 2 etc.). Each of these areas forms a [[constituency]] in the country's [[electoral district|electorate]]. Every four years, elections are held in these constituencies, with each constituency electing its own [[Member of Parliament|MP]]. The most recent election was in the [[Bahraini parliamentary by-election, 2011|Bahraini parliamentary by-election in 2011]].

Each governorate also has its own municipality council, with separate elections for them.

Most of [[Kuwait]]'s oil is located in the '''Great Burgan''' area (reserves of approximately 70 billion barrels) and is considered to be the world's second largest [[oil field]].  These three fields together pump 31' and 33' range crude into 14 [[tank farms]].

'''Great Burgan''' comprises the [[Burgan field|Burgan]], [[Al-Maqwa]], and [[Al Ahmadi, Kuwait|Al-Ahmadi]] fields located south of [[Kuwait City]].

The Burgan field is known to be pressurized by seawater intrusion.  While this had been speculated upon for decades, definitive proof was made evident in the 1991-92 period when the Iraqi Army used demolition explosives to break open scores of wells and set them on fire.  The wells kept producing oil until capped, demonstrating to the world that natural pressure was causing the oil to flow to the surface, and pressure in nearby Saudi Arabian fields declined until the Burgan wells were capped.  If the wells were productive under artificial lift the fires would have self extinguished from lack of fresh oil when the pumps were shut off.

In 2006 and again in 2007 the national oil company of Kuwait has stated that Burgan is producing at its best possible rate.  If true this demonstrates that Kuwait has reached [[Peak Oil|peak production]] and can not increase its production in the future.

'''Halagigie Point''' is the westernmost point on the island of [[Niue]] in [[Polynesia]]. It lies to the southwest of the capital, [[Alofi]], between the two large bays of [[Alofi Bay]] (to the north) and [[Avatele Bay]] (to the south).

'''House with griffins''' ({{lang-az|Qrifonlu ev}}) is a two-storey mansion erected according to the order of B. Lazerev in 1894–1896, based on the project of the architect Iohann Wilhelmovich Edel , located at 20 Yusif Mammadaliyev Street, [[Baku]].&lt;ref name="Fiqarov103"&gt;S.S.Fetullayev-Figarov, 2013, page. 103&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
This mansion, located on the Old Phone (now Yusif Mammadaliyev) Street, is believed to belong to the Lazarev family for the first time. After a while, the well-known merchant Akopov moved to this building and founded the ‘Münch und Weiss’ Trade Cooperation on the first floor of the building.
During the existence of the [[Democratic Republic of Azerbaijan]], here was the [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] diplomatic representation (at that time Georgia's Ambassador to Azerbaijan was N. Alshibay).&lt;ref name="press"&gt;{{cite book|url= http://axc.preslib.az/ru_a8.html|title=Diplomatic representation of ADR|publisher=2014 President library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Soviet]] times, many rich [[Baku]] residents lived here. Once, the House united into the main building of the nearby Institute of Theater, but after the demolition of the building, there was a great space here, and over time, this place turned into swamp.
After gaining independence, there was a [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] embassy in the building, but for some reason the embassy was moved to another location.&lt;ref name="ourb"&gt;{{cite book|url= http://www.ourbaku.com/index.php5/%D0%98%D0%BD%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B5_%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%81%D1%81%D0%B8%D0%B8_%D0%B2_%D0%91%D0%B0%D0%BA%D1%83_%D0%B2_%D0%BF%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BE%D0%B4_%D0%90%D0%94%D0%A0|title=Foreign missions in Baku during ADR|publisher=Our Baku}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Architectural features==
The mansion-type house was built by architect Iohann Wilhelmovich Edel in 1894–1896. The building was generally adapted to the architectural structure of Yusif Mammadaliyev Street, but differs from surrounding buildings due to its classic forms, architectural elements. 
The top of the house was decorated with [[griffin]]s and that's why it is called ‘House with Griffins’.&lt;ref name="Fiqarov125"&gt;S.S.Fetullayev-Figarov – Architectural encyclopedia of Baku, page. 125&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a '''list''' of '''museum collections''' pertaining to the '''Muisca'''. Most of the [[Muisca people|Muisca]] artefacts are housed in the [[Gold Museum, Bogotá]], the museum with the most [[gold]]en objects in the world. Other findings are in the [[Archaeology Museum, Sogamoso|Archaeology Museum]] in [[Sogamoso]] and in the [[Archeological Museum of Pasca|Archaeology Museum]] of [[Pasca]]. Few artefacts are on display outside [[Colombia]]. Most of the objects outside Colombia are ''[[tunjo]]s''; small offer pieces part of the [[Muisca religion]].

==First millennium==
[[Image:Hermitage St Helier Jersey.jpg|thumb|right|130px|The Hermitage of [[Saint Helier]]]]
Although there are indications that missionary efforts created small places of Christian worship in various places in the islands before 450 A.D.&lt;ref name="CIC"&gt;{{cite book |last=McCormack |first=John |title=Channel Island Churches |publisher=Phillimore &amp; Co Ltd 1886 |ISBN=0850335418}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|29}} the first proper evidence of Christianity is recorded as coming to the Islands around 520 A.D. when [[Samson of Dol]] visited [[Guernsey]] and in 
540 A.D. when [[Helier]] arrived in [[Jersey]], living as a hermit until he was killed by pirates.&lt;ref name=JD41/&gt;{{rp|65}}

The "pirates" grew in strength. In 911 A.D., a group of "pirates", or [[Vikings]] led by [[Rollo]] besieged [[Paris]] and [[Chartres]]. After a victory near Chartres on 26 August, [[Charles the Simple]] decided to negotiate with Rollo, resulting in the [[Treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte]]. For the Vikings' loyalty, they were granted all the land between the river [[Epte]] and the sea, as well as [[Brittany]], which at the time was an independent country which France had unsuccessfully tried to conquer. Rollo also agreed to be baptised and to marry Charles' daughter, [[Gisela of France|Gisela]].  The land would become known as "Normandy", the land of the North Men and included "Les Îles d'la Manche" or the Channel Islands. Religion was strengthened with the arrival and conversion of the [[Normans]] to Christianity, in the 10th Century.&lt;ref name=JerCom/&gt;

==Second millennium==

There were many churches built by the Normans in the 11th and 12th centuries, many on top of previous chapels which were themselves alongside pagan places of worship,&lt;ref name=CIC/&gt;{{rp|53–55}} the islands being divided up into parishes in the 11th Century and land areas granted by endowment to French-based religious centres, [[Mont Saint Michel Abbey]] received four and [[Marmoutier Abbey, Tours]] six from Guernsey, [[Cerisy-la-Forêt]] acquired two in Jersey, but most other Jersey parishes were scattered amongst other people and institutions.&lt;ref name=CIC/&gt;{{rp|53}}

The Islands embraced the French Calvinist form of [[Protestantism]] during the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] [[Catholic Church in Jersey|Roman Catholicism]] continued until orders were received to remove all signs of Catholicism in 1547. A brief return to Catholicism saw the three women turned into [[Guernsey Martyrs|martyrs]] before another turn, back to the Protestant faith and a fear of France and Catholics.&lt;ref name="Black"&gt;{{cite book |first=Henry |last=Wimbush |title=The Channel islands |publisher=AC Black 1924}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|95}} Methodism took a stronghold at the end of the 18th Century.&lt;ref name="JerCom"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.jersey.com/english/sightsandactivities/walking/routes/Pages/default.aspx?itemid=27eb2436-18ab-4a9a-8ed6-cb096ca3ae5a&amp;start=1 |title=Religion in Jersey |publisher=Jersey.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Little Chapel op Guernsey.JPG|thumb|150px| Little Chapel, Guernsey]]
The [[Little Chapel]] in [[Guernsey]] has been said that it "is the smallest functioning chapel in Europe, if not the world", and&lt;ref name="RL"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/article-2061853/Guernsey-holidays-Rula-Lenska-finds-Channel-Islands-world-away.html | title=An actress calls: Rula Lenska hops over to Guernsey but finds it a world away | work=Mail Online | date=15 November 2011 | accessdate=30 June 2013 | author=Lenska, Rula}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mail Online"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/article-610080/A-royal-family-affair-Guernsey.html | title=A royal family affair on Guernsey | work=Mail Online | date=2 July 2008 | accessdate=30 June 2013 | author=Bond, Jennie}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is "believed to be the world’s smallest [[consecrated]] church."&lt;ref name="Express"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.express.co.uk/life-style/travel/348925/Warm-to-a-taste-of-the-Gallic-in-Guernsey | title=Warm to a taste of the Gallic in Guernsey | work=Express | date=29 September 2012 | accessdate=30 June 2013 | author=Kelly, Fergus}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Size"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.premierholidays.co.uk/channel_islands_and_the_isle_of_man/guernsey/guernsey_destination_guide | title=Guernsey Destination Guide | publisher=Premier Holidays | accessdate=30 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At least three churches in Guernsey have pre history carved stones, the most famous being La Gran'mère du Chimquière.&lt;ref name="MGGM"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.megalithicguernsey.co.uk/la-granmere-du-chimquiere/ |title=La Gran’mère du Chimquière |publisher=Megalithic Guernsey}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Jersey, at [[La Hougue Bie]] a 12th Century chapel was built on a [[Neolithic]] ritual site which was in use around 3500&amp;nbsp;BC. In [[Western Europe]], it is one of the largest and best preserved [[passage graves]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Statements in Stone: Monuments and Society in Neolithic Europe|author= Mark Patton|year= 1993|publisher=Routledge (UK)|url=https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0415067294&amp;id=169_3pCX9EUC&amp;pg=PA96&amp;lpg=PA96&amp;ots=b-yvovCtRv&amp;dq=%22La+Hougue+Bie%22&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;output=html&amp;sig=Y9S5BAodEkc7S_J6iCqQxotYSng|isbn=0415067294}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several churches, including Castel Church, Guernsey, have been built using materials dating back to the [[Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.twcenter.net/forums/showthread.php?346611-Guernsey-the-Roman-Empire-s-trading-post |title=Guernsey the Roman Empire's trading post |publisher=Total War Centre}}&lt;/ref&gt; St Saviour Church in Guernsey has a number of tunnels running underneath, built by the [[Organisation Todt]] for [[Nazi Germany]] in the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-09-10/news/mn-2588_1_guernsey-women |title=Wartime Nazi Tunnels on Guernsey Posing Problem |publisher=Los Angeles Times |date=10 September 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The historic toleration of religious minorities has led to many persecuted minorities seeking refuge in the Islands, such as Huguenots from 1548.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.genealogyforum.com/gfaol/resource/Huguenot/hug0006.htm |title=HUGUENOT &amp; PROTESTANT REFORMED CHRONOLOGY |publisher=genealogyforum}}&lt;/ref&gt; The influx of the Protestant refugees led to [[Calvinism]] becoming the main religion, forcing a break from the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Coutances]] in 1568 to the [[Bishop of Winchester]]. Religion became strictly enforced with physical punishments (whippings, stocks, imprisonment) and torture to get confessions for [[Channel Islands Witch Trials]] for 100 years, ending only with the [[Act of Uniformity 1662]] of [[Charles II of England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Girard |first=Peter |title=More of Peter Girard's Guernsey: A Second Miscellany of Guernsey's History and Its People |publisher=Guernsey Press |ISBN=978-0902550421 |date=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|153}} In the [[Channel Islands in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms|English Civil War]] Guernsey, with stronger puritanical sympathies supported Parliament whereas Jersey was happy to restore episcopalian constitutions, siding with the Royalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=S. Elliott |last=Hoskins |title=Charles the Second in the Channel Islands |publisher=Richard Bentley 1854}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A famous refugee Guernsey in 1855 was [[Victor Hugo]] who increasingly expressed anti-Catholic and [[anti-clerical]] views. Hugo counted 740 attacks on a book he wrote whilst in Guernsey, ''[[Les Misérables]]'' in the Catholic press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Robb|first=Graham|title=Victor Hugo|year=1997|publisher=Picador|location=London|pages=32|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kU9LloPylhQC&amp;pg=PA32&amp;lpg=PA32}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last major act of non-toleration goes back to 1556, with the [[Guernsey Martyrs]] who died for their Protestant faith. The Island's toleration has left a rich legacy of churches, chapels and places of worship.

The maintenance of Parish churches was, before the Reformation, the responsibility of the Catholic church. To avoid the English Crown taking over responsibility as successor, [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] in 1677 instructed the Guernsey churchwardens to raise monies from the parishioners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Darryl |last=Ogier |title=The Government and Law of Guernsey |publisher= States of Guernsey |ISBN=978-0-9549775-1-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1893 a religious census was undertaken in Guernsey showing around 50% of the population attended:&lt;ref name="Crossan"&gt;{{cite book |last=Crossan |first=Rose-Marie |title=Guernsey 1814-1914: Migration and Modernisation |publisher=Boydell Press |ISBN=978-1843833208}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|194}}

'''[[International Call Prefix]]: 00 then Carrier Code'''&lt;br&gt;
'''[[Trunk Prefix]]: 0 then Carrier Code'''

This page contains a list of '''[[area code]]s in [[Brazil]]''' for telephone dialing. The area codes are distributed geographically, citing the main cities in each area.

Local phone numbers in Brazil observe an eight-digit pattern (''nnnn-nnnn'') for [[landline]]s and nine digits (''nnnnn-nnnn'') for [[mobile phone]]s. Mobile numbers share the same geographic area codes as landlines, but the first digit differentiates them. Landline numbers start with digits ''2'' through ''5''. Initial digits ''6'' through ''9'' are reserved for mobile numbers, but as of 2017 all mobile numbers in Brazil start with the digit ''9''. (There is an exception for some [[iDEN]] mobile lines operated by [[NII Holdings|Nextel]], which are eight digits long and start with ''7''.)

Area codes have two digits, and are often notated between parentheses: ''(aa) nnnn-nnnn''. For [[long-distance call]]s '''within''' Brazil, a zero (''0'') must be dialed first, then a carrier selection code (for example, ''21'' for [[Embratel]] and ''41'' for [[TIM Brasil]]), then the two-digit area code, then the local number. For example, to call the number ''2222-2222'' in [[Fortaleza]] (area code ''85'') using [[Oi (telecommunications)|Oi]] (selection code ''31'') as the chosen carrier, one would dial '''0 31 85 2222 2222'''.

For [[international call]]s '''to''' Brazil, the international access code used in the calling country must be dialed (for example, ''011'' from the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], ''00'' from [[Europe]] and most other countries, or the actual "+" sign from some mobile networks), then Brazil's country code '''55''', then the two-digit area code, then the local eight- or nine-digit number. For example, to call the number ''3333-3333'' in [[Rio de Janeiro]] (area code ''21'') from Europe, one would dial '''00 55 21 3333 3333'''.

==Exceptions==

In a few exceptional cases, some area codes span state borders to cater for tightly integrated interstate communities:

*The village of Maringá (not to be confused with the [[Maringá|homonymous large city]] in the State of [[Paraná (state)|Paraná]]) straddles the [[Minas Gerais]]-[[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]] border, and both sides use the Rio de Janeiro area code '''24'''. The rest of the municipality of [[Bocaina de Minas]], where the Minas Gerais part of the village is located, uses the proper regional area code '''32'''.

*Two border cities in the State of [[Paraná (state)|Paraná]] are contiguous with larger cities in [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]] and use area codes from the latter state: [[Rio Negro, Paraná|Rio Negro]] (contiguous with [[Mafra, Santa Catarina|Mafra]]) uses area code '''47''', and [[Barracão, Paraná|Barracão]] (contiguous with [[Dionísio Cerqueira]]) uses area code '''49'''.

*Conversely, the border city of [[Porto União]] in the State of [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]] is contiguous with the larger [[Paraná (state)|Paraná]] city of [[União da Vitória]] and uses the latter state's area code '''42'''.

*Area code '''61''' primarily serves the [[Federal District (Brazil)|Federal District]] (comprising the national capital city, [[Brasília]]), but it also serves some surrounding municipalities in the State of  [[Goiás]], such as [[Formosa, Goiás|Formosa]], [[Valparaíso de Goiás]] and [[Luziânia]]. Formerly, area code 61 was even larger and used to include northwestern [[Minas Gerais]] ([[Unaí]], [[Paracatu, Minas Gerais|Paracatu]]), now in that state's area code '''38'''.

*The city of [[Alto Parnaíba]], in the State of [[Maranhão]], is conurbated with [[Santa Filomena, Piauí|Santa Filomena]], State of [[Piauí]], and uses the latter state's area code '''89''' for landlines. Most local mobile phones, though, use Southern Maranhão area code '''99'''.

      <comment>Interesting [user:PamD]; i have attached two refs for the moment (TheMountainGuide is also I think a download of DoBIH and I would suspect from the sime time I downloaded; Peakbagger lists two peaks at 119, one being MB at 600m). Hoever, DoBIH is the best source, and perhaps have decided to downgrade MB back to sub 600.  Let me try and chase this up with DoBIH to see what it happening. The problem with prominences !</comment>

{{see also|List of mountains of the British Isles by height}}

The '''mountains and hills of the British Isles''', are categorised into '''lists''' based on [[elevation]] (or "height"), [[topographic prominence|prominence]] (or "relative height", or "drop"), and other criteria (e.g. [[topographic isolation|isolation]]). These lists are used for [[peak bagging]], whereby [[hillwalking|hillwalkers]] attempt to reach all the summits on a list, the oldest and best-known, being the 282 {{slink|#Munros}} in Scotland, which amongst other criteria, must be above {{convert|3000|ft|1}}.

[[File:Scafell massif.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|[[Scafell Pike]] in the [[Lake District]] in [[Cumbria]].  Scafell Pike is the highest mountain in [[England]], and the 257th highest mountain in the British Isles on the Simms classification, the 138th highest mountain on the Marilyn classification, and the 46th highest mountain on the P600 classification.  Scafell Pike has the 13th greatest "relative height" (or prominence) in the British Isles.  It is also classed as a Marilyn, a HuMP, a Furth, a Hewitt, a Nuttall, a Wainright, a Birkett, and a County Top.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hill-bagging.co.uk/mountaindetails.php?qu=CoU&amp;rf=2359|title=Scafell Pike|publisher=HillBagging|access-date=8 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

A height above 2,000 ft, or more latterly 600 m, is considered necessary to be a "mountain" in the British Isles, and apart from the Munros (who favour isolation), all lists require a prominence of at least {{convert|15|m|sigfig=4}}.  A prominence of between {{convert|15-30|m|sigfig=4}} (e.g. some {{slink|#Nuttalls}} and {{slink|#Vandeleur-Lynams}}), does not meet the [[UIAA]] definition of an "independent" [[summit|peak]].  Most lists consider a prominence between {{convert|30-150|m|sigfig=4}} as a "top", and not a mountain (e.g. many {{slink|#Hewitts}} and {{slink|#Simms}}).  A popular designation are the {{slink|#Marilyns}}, with a prominence above {{convert|150|m|sigfig=4}}. Prominences above {{convert|600|m|sigfig=4}}, are the {{slink|#P600 (the "Majors")}}, the international classification of a "major" mountain.

==General concepts==

===Elevation===

There is no worldwide consensus on the definition of "mountain", but in Great Britain and Ireland it is often taken to be any summit at least 2,000 feet (or 610 metres) high (also called [[elevation]]).&lt;ref name="Nuttall 2008"&gt;{{cite book

[http://www.ucd.ie/gsi/pdf/34-1/hills.pdf] (pdf)&lt;/ref&gt; The UK government defines ''mountain'' as land over {{convert|600|m|sigfig=4}} for the purposes of freedom of access.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/37/pdfs/ukpga_20000037_en.pdf ''Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000''], Part 1, Chapter 1, Section 1(2).

* [[List of P600 mountains in the British Isles]], a ranking by height and prominence on the P600 classification (any height, prominence over 600 m)

===Prominence===

In addition, all British Isles definitions, with the exception of definitions that rely on {{slink|#Isolation}}, include a minimum [[topographical prominence]] requirement (also called relative height, or drop, or re-ascent, between neighbouring peaks), which is typically {{convert|30-600|m|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="G4AW"/&gt; The lowest minimum prominence is {{convert|15|m|sigfig=4}}, the Nuttalls and Vandeleur-Lynams, however most definitions do not consider prominences below {{convert|30|m|sigfig=4}}.  Many definitions use the term '''Tops''' to refer to the sub-class of peaks that do not meet a {{convert|150|m|sigfig=4}} prominence threshold for the main definition, but have a prominence of between {{convert|30-150|m|sigfig=4}}.  Some definitions ignore height completely and just focus purely on prominence (e.g.  P600s, Marilyns, and HuMPs).

Prominence requirements are even strongly debated regarding [[UIAA]] classification of major Himalayan mountains.&lt;ref name="bbc1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-24571309|title=Nepal mountain peak expansion bid stalls|publisher=BBC News|date=18 October 2013|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.markhorrell.com/blog/2014/a-funny-name-for-a-mountain/|title=A funny name for a mountain|publisher=Mark Horrell|date=4 June 2014|quote=I explained how these five ridgetops couldn’t possibly be classified as 8000m peaks in their own right because each of them requires less than 135 metres of re-ascent between their respective parent peaks, Kangchenjunga and Lhotse (known as topographic prominence). It seems that where logic and common sense fail the NMA feels that flattery may work instead. }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, regarding classification of [[summit]]s, the UIAA stated that for a "peak" to be independent (e.g. not a sub-peak of a mountain), it needed a prominence over 30 m, and in addition, a "mountain" had to have a prominence over 300 m.&lt;ref name="uiaa"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theuiaa.org/mountaineering/mountain-classification/|title=MOUNTAIN CLASSIFICATION|publisher=[[UIAA]]|date=March 1994|quote=Topographic criterium: for each summit, the level difference between it and the highest adjacent pass or notch should be at least 30 m (calculated as average of the summits at the limit of acceptability).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the single measurement of elevation, prominence requires the detailed measurement of all contours around the peak, and is therefore subject to change and revision over time, and thus tables based on prominence are subject to revision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rhb.org.uk/marhofn/marhofn316/marhofn31618.htm|date=March 2016|title=Surveying and mapping standards|author=Alan Dawson|publisher=The Relative Hills of Britain (rhb.org.uk)}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some definitions use an [[imperial measurement]] for height, but a metric measurement for the topological prominence (e.g. Murdos, Hewitts and Nuttals).

* [[List of mountains of the British Isles by height]], a ranking by height and prominence on the Simms classification (height over 600m, prominence over 30 m)
* [[List of Marilyns in the British Isles]], a ranking by height and prominence on the Marilyn  classification (any height, prominence over 150 m)
* [[List of P600 mountains in the British Isles]], a ranking by height and prominence on the P600 classification (any height, prominence over 600 m)

===Isolation===

No definition of a British Isles mountain or hill uses an explicit ''quantitative'' metric of [[topographic isolation]] (e.g. distance to the next point of equal height), however, the concept of isolation is embedded in the ''qualitative'' definition of a Scottish [[Munro]], from the [[Scottish Mountaineering Club]] requirement of "sufficient separation" (instead of prominence).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.smc.org.uk/hills/hill-lists#Munros|title=Munros|publisher=[[Scottish Mountaineering Club]]|date=2018|quote=The list of distinct Scottish peaks of 3000ft (914.4m) and over, of "sufficient separation" from their neighbouring peaks. The list that was originally drawn up by Sir H.T. Munro in the Scottish Mountaineering Club Journal in 1891 was unfinished at the time of his death. Munro did not write down a precise definition of what he meant by "sufficient separation", though the character of a mountain did enter into it. Through regular use these hills have become known as the Munros.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural===

Mountains in [[Scotland]] are frequently referred to as "hills" no matter what their height, as reflected in names such as the ''[[Cuillin]] Hills'' and the ''[[Torridon Hills]]''.

===''Database of British and Irish Hills'' {{anchor|Database of British and Irish Hills}}===

===P600 (the "Majors")===

(any height, prominence 600 m)

[[Image:BenNevis2005.jpg|right|thumb|[[Ben Nevis]], the highest mountain in the British Isles, which also has the greatest [[topographic prominence]].]]

The '''P600s''' are mountains in the British Isles that have a [[topographical prominence]] of at least {{convert|600|m|0|abbr=off}}, regardless of absolute height or other merits.  The list was also developed by Alan Dawson in 2004 (creator of the Marilyn list), and refined in 2004 and 2006.&lt;ref name="p600"/&gt;  Dawson initially used a 2,000 ft metric (or 610 m, the P610s), and called his list the "Majors", as it is one of the shortest of the noted lists of mountains in the British Islands, and one of the most testing requirements.  The term "Major" is often used by others when listing the P600 peaks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mountainsofscotland.co.uk/Maps/mapp600.htm|title=P600 MAP|publisher=MountainsofScotland|date=2018|quote=A list of British and Irish hills with at least 600m of prominence, also known as the Major Mountains of Britain &amp; Ireland.

By lowering the cutoff to 600 meters (in order to be consistent with upcoming lists for Europe), we now reach a total of 119 mountains, including 93 for Great Britain, 1 on Man, and 25 in Ireland.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, since 2006, Welsh peak [[Moel Siabod]]'s prominence was recalculated to 600 metres, and the list of P600s was expanded to 120.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.themountainguide.co.uk/wales/moel-siabod.htm|title=Moel Siabod|publisher=TheMountainGuide|access-date=2 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peakbagger.com/list.aspx?lid=4340|title=Britain and Ireland Peaks with 600 meters of Prominence|publisher=PeakBagger.com|access-date=2 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British Isle P600s, contain 54 of the 282 Scottish Munros, and 10 of the 34 Non-Scottish Munros, which are also called {{slink|#Furths}}; these 64 British Isles mountains meet the designation of being above {{convert|3000|ft|0|abbr=off}} in height, and {{convert|600|m|0|abbr=off}} in prominence (e.g. "Super-Majors").

===Marilyns===

(any height, prominence 150 m)

[[File:Pillar and Rock.jpg|thumb|[[Pillar (mountain)|Pillar]], an English [[Marilyn (hill)|Marilyn]]]]

The '''Marilyns''' are mountains and hills in the British Isles that have a [[topographical prominence]] of at least {{convert|150|m|ft|abbr=off}}, regardless of absolute height or other merits. As at October 2018, there were 1,552 Marilyns in Great Britain:&lt;ref name="dibh"/&gt; 1,219 in Scotland, 175 in England, and 158 in Wales ([[Black Mountain, Wales|Black Mountain]], on the [[England-Wales border]], is counted as being in Wales).  There are 454 Marilyns in Ireland (389 in the Republic of Ireland and 66 in Northern Ireland), and 5 on the [[Isle of Man]], bringing the total for the British Isles to 2,011. The list was first compiled in 1992 by Alan Dawson.&lt;ref name="rhb"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dobih"/&gt; The name was coined as an ironic contrast to the designation ''Munro'', which is homophonous with [[Marilyn Monroe|''(Marilyn) Monroe'']].  The Marilyns are one of the most popular lists for peak baggers.

=== HuMPs {{Anchor|Humps}} ===
(any height, prominence 100 m)

The Marilyns were expanded in 2007 by the '''HuMPs''' ('''H'''undred and '''u'''pwards '''M'''etre '''P'''rominence) which reduces the [[Topographic prominence|prominence]] requirement to {{convert|100|m|abbr=on}}.  Therefore, all British Isles Marilyns are British Isles HuMPS (but not vice versa).&lt;ref name="hb"/&gt; The list was compiled by Mark Jackson from a number of sources and published online in 2010 in ''More Relative Hills of Britain''.&lt;ref name="Jackson"&gt;{{cite web|last=Jackson|first=Mark|title=More Relative Hills of Britain|url=http://www.rhb.org.uk/humps/humps_1_1_0c.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012150300/http://www.rhb.org.uk/humps/humps_1_1_0c.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=12 October 2013|work=Relative Hills of Britain|accessdate=9 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are 2,986 HuMPs in the British Isles: 2,168 in Scotland, 833 in Ireland, 444 in England, 366 in Wales and 11 in the Channel Islands.&lt;ref name="hb"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hill-bagging.co.uk/HuMPs.php|title=The HuMPS|publisher=HillBaggingUK|quote=The Humps:  Humps are hills of any height with a drop of 100 metres or more on all sides  The name Hump stands for HUndred Metre Prominence.

=== Simms ===
(height 600 m, prominence 30 m)

A '''Simm''' is a mountain the British Isles that is over {{convert|600|m|abbr=on|0}} high and has a prominence of at least {{convert|30|m|abbr=on}}. The word comes from '''Si'''x-hundred '''M'''etre '''M'''ountain.&lt;ref name="si"/&gt; There are currently 2,754 recorded Simms in the British Isles, including 2,188 Scottish Simms, 192 English Simms, 149 Welsh Simms, 1 Isle of Man Simm, and 224 Irish Simms.{{efn|name="mv"}}&lt;ref name="si"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hill-bagging.co.uk/Simms.php?ct=EWM|title=The SIMMs|publisher=HillBaggingUK|quote=The Simms:  A Simm is a hill in England, Wales or Scotland over 600m high with a drop of at least 30 metres all-round.

A '''Sub-Simm''' is a hill which just fails (by up to 10m) to qualify on the drop rule, i.e. over 600m with 20-29m drop.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By definition, all Simms are also [[TuMP]]s (see below) and most, if not all, are mountains, depending on whether 600 metres or 2,000 feet (610 m) (e.g. a {{slink|#Hewitts}}), is used as the criterion.  The idea of the Simm was introduced by Alan Dawson in June 2010, who noted that a Simm was the "broadest credible definition of what could be objectively conceived as a mountain in Britain".&lt;ref name="dobih"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hills-database.co.uk/database_notes.html#list_of_lists|title=Background to the lists|publisher=Database of British and Irish Hills|date=2 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  {{As of |October 2018}}, 6,414 people had registered themselves as having climbed all 282 Scottish Munros,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.smc.org.uk/hills/completionists|title=Compleators|publisher=[[Scottish Mountaineering Club]]|author=Clerk of the List|date=October 2018|quote=The SMC hold a record of Munros, Corbetts, Grahams and Donalds compleators.}}&lt;/ref&gt; over 270 people had registeted climbing all 1,552 Marilyns of Great Britain,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rhb.org.uk/marilyns/marhof.htm|title=The Marilyn Hall of Fame (Marhof)|publisher=The Relative Hills of Britain (rhb.org.uk)|date=31 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; while only 2 people had registered completion of the 2,529 Simms of Great Britain, and no one had yet declared completion of all 2,754 Simms of the British Isles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rhb.org.uk/simms/simmhof.htm|title=Simm Hall of Fame|date=6 July 2017|publisher=The Relative Hills of Britain (rhb.org.uk)|quote=A Simm is a hill in Britain that is at least 600 metres high and has a drop of at least 30 metres on all sides.

(any height, prominence 30 m)

In 2010, Mark Jackson further expanded the HuMPS and compiled the '''TuMPs''' ('''T'''hirty and '''u'''wpards '''M'''etre '''P'''rominence), a list of all hills in Britain having a prominence above {{convert|30|m|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Jackson"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rhb.org.uk/marhofn/marhofn255/Marhofn255.pdf ''Marilyn Hall of Fame News''], May 2012, p.30.

For the lower Tumps, the accuracy of the data on this site is not necessarily as dependable nor subject to as much scrutiny as those above 500m.  For lower lying hills it can be much more difficult to identify the actual summit, so some grid references given may be more an indication of the general area of the summit. There is also a greater likelihood of encountering access problems when trying to bag lower Tumps, so please be considerate of land ownership and usage.}}&lt;/ref&gt; approximately half of that number that did not appear in previously researched lists were researched by Mark Jackson between 2006 and 2009. Since 2012 the list has been published and maintained by the editors of The Database of British and Irish Hills.&lt;ref name=dibh/&gt;

===Munros===
(height 3,000 ft, other SMC criteria)

{{Main article|Munro}}

[[File:BenHopefromLochEriboll.jpg|right|thumb|[[Ben Hope]], in the [[Flow Country]], is the most northerly [[List of Munros|Munro]]]]

The '''Munros''' are mountains in Scotland over {{convert|3000|ft|sigfig=4}}. The list was originally compiled by Sir [[Hugh Munro]] in 1891, and is modified from time to time by the [[Scottish Mountaineering Club]] (SMC).&lt;ref name="munros"&gt;{{cite book| last=Bearhop | first=D.A. | year=1997 | title=Munro's Tables | isbn=0-907521-53-3 | publisher=Scottish Mountaineering Club &amp; Trust}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike most other lists, the Munros do not depend on a rigid [[topographic prominence|prominence]] criterion for entry; instead, those that satisfy the subjective measure of being a "separate mountain" are regarded as ''Munros'', while subsidiary summits are given the status of '''Munro Tops'''.   There are 282 Munros, and 227 further Munro Tops, totalling 509 summits, all of them in the [[Scottish Highlands]].

'''Real Munro''' is used to describe Munros with a prominence over {{convert|150|m}} (the Marilyn prominence threshold),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/galleries/most-beautiful-impressive-best-munros-to-climb/|title=Magnificent munros: 17 Scottish mountains to bag in your lifetime|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|date=13 April 2017|quote=Of the 282, 200 are said to have a summit prominence of over 150 metres and are therefore known as "real munros", but that's for another day.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and there are 202 Real Munros in Scotland.  Of the 282 Scottish Munros, 54 meet the {{convert|600|m|sigfig=4}} in prominence to be P600s.

===Murdos===
(height 3,000&amp;nbsp;ft, prominence 30 m)
[[File:Aonach beag.jpg|thumb|[[Aonach Beag]], in the [[Highlands]], one of the "mini" Murdos]]

The '''Murdos''' apply objective criteria to the [[Munro]]s and their associated tops. They comprise all the summits in Scotland over {{convert|3000|ft|sigfig=4}} with a [[topographic prominence|prominence]] of at least {{convert|30|m}}. There are currently 442 Murdos,&lt;ref name="dibh"/&gt; compared to 282 Munros, or 509 Munros plus Munro Tops. Alan Dawson first compiled the list in 1995.&lt;ref name="murdos"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Murdos | last=Dawson | first=Alan | url=http://bubl.ac.uk/org/tacit/tables/murdos/ | isbn=0-9522680-3-5 | publisher=TACit Press | location=Cambuskenneth, Stirling | year=1995 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615012227/http://bubl.ac.uk/org/tacit/tables/murdos/ | archivedate=2006-06-15 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

All Murdos are also Munro Tops, but many Munro Tops fail to qualify as Murdos because of insufficient relative height. Before 1997 there were seven Murdos that were ''not'' Munro Tops, some with quite substantial relative heights.&lt;ref&gt;Murdos designated new Munro Tops in 1997, {{cite web |url=http://bubl.ac.uk/org/tacit/tables/murdos/sevensum.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070708005137/http://bubl.ac.uk/org/tacit/tables/murdos/sevensum.html |archivedate=2007-07-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  All seven were included in the 1997 edition of Munro's Tables, plus two non-Murdos: Little Pap on Lochnagar and Knight's Peak on Sgurr nan Gillean (deleted in September 2013 after surveying showed it to be below 3000 feet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Survey of Knight's Peak |url=http://www.hills-database.co.uk/downloads.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Little Pap has an estimated drop of only 22 metres&lt;ref name=dibh&gt;{{cite web |title=Database of British and Irish Hills |url=http://www.hills-database.co.uk/downloads.html |accessdate=18 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the reason for its re-introduction to the list, following its removal in the 1981 edition of Munro's Tables,&lt;ref&gt;The Munros and Tops 1891–1997, http://www.hills-database.co.uk/downloads.html#munrotab&lt;/ref&gt; is unclear.

They were later named Grahams after the late Fiona Torbet (née Graham) who had compiled a similar list around the same time. Dawson continues to maintain the list, which {{as of|October 2018}}  contained 219 hills distributed as follows: Highlands south of the Great Glen 87, Highlands north of the Great Glen 84, Central and Southern Scotland 23, Skye 10, Mull 7, Harris 3, Jura 2, Arran 1, Rum 1, South Uist 1. The number of Grahams was reduced from 224, following surveys in 2014 that showed Corwharn, Ben Aslak and Ladylea Hill to be below {{convert|609.6|m|ft|abbr=off}} high.&lt;ref name="dibh"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| year=2015 | title=The Grahams and the Donalds | isbn=978-1-907233-19-7 | publisher=Scottish Mountaineering Trust}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[List of Graham mountains in Scotland]]

Dawson in 2004 published a list of '''Graham Tops''' covering every mountain in Scotland with between {{convert|2000|and|2500|ft|sigfig=4}} of height and between 
{{convert|30|and|150|m|sigfig=4}} of relative height. There are currently 995 of them, including the 219 Grahams.&lt;ref name="dibh"/&gt;

===Donalds===
(height 2,000&amp;nbsp;ft, prominence mostly over 100&amp;nbsp;ft, Scottish lowlands)

[[File:Rhinns-of-Kells-from-Craignaw.jpg|thumb|[[Corserine]], the highest point of the Rhinns of Kells range, is a Marilyn, a Donald, and a Corbett]]

The '''Donalds''' are mountains in the [[Scottish Lowlands]] over {{convert|2,000|ft|m|abbr=on}}, amongst other criteria. The list was compiled by Percy Donald in  1935 and is maintained by the SMC.&lt;ref name="munros"/&gt;  Whether a high point is a Donald is determined by a complicated formula which also contains qualitative elements around "sufficient topographical interest".&lt;ref name="smc"/&gt; The formula necessitates the splitting of Donalds into '''Donald Hills''' and '''Donald Tops'''.  In general, all Donald Hills have a prominence over {{convert|100|ft|1}}, but the prominence of Donald Tops can range from {{convert|16-220|ft|1}}.  Donalds can be Corbetts or Grahams and the SMC state that: "Percy Donald's original Tables are seen as a complete entity, unlike the Munros, Corbetts and Grahams."&lt;ref name="smc"/&gt;  There are 140 Donalds, comprising 89 Donald Hills and 51 Donald Tops.&lt;ref name="smc"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.smc.org.uk/hills/hill-lists#Donalds|title=Donalds|publisher=[[Scottish Mountaineering Club]]|date=2018|quote=There are currently 89 Donald Hills and a further 51 Donald Tops.

* [[List of Donald mountains in Scotland]]

Given the complexity of the Donald classification, the simpler '''New Donalds''' were introduced by Alan Dawson in his 1995 book, ''The Grahams and the New Donalds'', with an explicit prominence threshold of {{convert|30|m|1|abbr=on}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rhb.org.uk/tables/grahams1999.htm|title=Review: The Grahams and the New Donalds|publisher=The Relative Hills of Britain|author=Alan Dawson|date=May 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; there are 118 New Donalds, and while all Donald Hills are New Donalds, 22 Donald Tops are not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hill-bagging.co.uk/Donalds.php|title=The New Donalds|publisher=HillBaggingUK|date=2018|quote=The New Donalds are an attempt to rationalize the qualifying criteria, being "hills in Central or Southern Scotland at least 2000 feet high (610m) with a drop of at least 30 metres (98 feet) all round".

'''Furths''' are mountains in Great Britain and Ireland [[wikt:furth|furth]] of (i.e. "outside") Scotland that would otherwise qualify as Munros or Munro Tops.  They are sometimes referred to as the Irish, English or Welsh Munros. There are 34 furths; 15 in Wales, 13 in Ireland and 6 in England. The highest is [[Snowdon]]. Of these 34 SMC identified Furths, 33 have a prominence above {{convert|30|m|abbr=on}} (e.g. the Murdo Furths), 14 have a prominence above {{convert|150|m|abbr=on}} (e.g. the Real Munro Furths), and 10 have a prominence above {{convert|600|m|abbr=on}} (e.g. the P600 Furths).

The list addresses one of the criticisms of the Nuttalls by requiring hills to have a relative height of {{convert|30|m}}, thus excluding the 125 least prominent Nuttalls from the list.

The [[DoBIH]] however uses the ''Harvey Tables'' which list the prominence for both at 30 m, and thus the DoBIH class them as Irish Hewitts and Simms, giving 209 Irish Hewitts and 224 Irish Simms on the DoBIH tables.}} 180 in England and 135 in Wales. Since their publication in 1997, Birks Fell in England and Mynydd Graig Goch have been added and Black Mountain deemed to be in Wales only.  There is no Scottish equivalent of a Hewitt (e.g. Murdos meet the criteria for mountains over 3,000 ft, but Corbetts and Grahams have higher prominence thresholds).  Hewitts are a sub-class of the newer 2010 British Isles classification, the {{slink|#Simms}}, or "metric Hewitt", with a {{convert|600|m|1}} height threshold, and a {{convert|30|m|1}} prominence threshold.

===Nuttalls===
(height 2,000&amp;nbsp;ft, prominence 15 m)
[[File:Skiddaw and Little Man.JPG|thumb|[[Skiddaw]], an English Nuttall]]
The '''Nuttalls''' are mountains in England and Wales only (e.g. not Ireland) over {{convert|2000|ft|m|0}} with a relative height of at least {{convert|15|m}}. There were 444 Nuttalls in the original list (254 in England and 190 in Wales), compiled by [http://www.nuttalls.com/ John and Anne Nuttall] and published in 1989-90 in two volumes, ''The Mountains of England &amp; Wales''.&lt;ref name="Nuttall 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

By including high points that rise by as little as {{convert|15|m}} above their surroundings, the list of Nuttalls is sometimes criticised for including too many insignificant minor tops. The Hewitts (see above) are one attempt to avoid this.  Some Nuttalls would therefore not be considered peaks or mountains under UIAA definitions.&lt;ref name="uiaa"/&gt;

===Wainwrights===
(subjective listing, Lake District NP)

The '''Wainwrights''' are mountains or hills (locally known as ''[[fells]]'') in the English [[Lake District National Park]] that have a chapter in one of [[Alfred Wainwright]]'s ''[[Pictorial Guides to the Lakeland Fells]]''. There are 214 Wainwrights in the seven guides. There are no qualifications for inclusion other than Wainwright's choice. The lowest is [[Castle Crag]] in Borrowdale, at {{convert|951|ft|m}}. A further 116 summits were included in the supplementary guide, ''[[The Outlying Fells of Lakeland]]'', and are known as the '''Wainwright Outlying Fells'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hill-bagging.co.uk/Wainwrights.php|title=Wainwrights and Wainwright Outlying Fells|publisher=HillBaggingUK|date=2018|quote=The Wainwrights: The Wainwrights are a list of hills appearing in the seven volumes of Alfred Wainwright's Pictorial Guides to the Lakeland Fells; the list is subjective - some of the hills are not summits at all - just prominent points at the end of a ridge or spur from a higher mountain.&lt;br&gt;The [Wainwright] Outlying Fells: Wainwright produced an additional volume entitled The Outlying Fells of Lakelands.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Birketts''' are all the fell tops over {{convert|1000|ft|1}} within the boundaries of the [[Lake District National Park]]. Height and location, but not prominence, are the criteria. The list was devised by [[Bill Birkett]] as the basis for his 1994 book ''Complete Lakeland Fells''.&lt;ref&gt;Bill Birkett, ''Complete Lakeland Fells'', London: HarperCollins / Premier Books (1994), {{ISBN|0583-32209-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are 541 of these tops, and they include 209 of the 214 Wainwrights, and 59 of the 116 Wainwright Outlying Fells.&lt;ref name="boh"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hills-database.co.uk/|title=Birketts|publisher=[[Database of British and Irish Hills]]|date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 5 Wainwrights that are not Birketts are: [[Armboth Fell]], [[Baystones]], [[Castle Crag]] (which, at {{convert|951|ft|m}}, is Wainwright's only sub-1,000&amp;nbsp;ft summit), [[Graystones]] and [[Mungrisdale Common]].

===Vandeleur-Lynams===

(height 600 m, prominence 15 m)

The '''Vandeleur-Lynam''' is the Irish equivalent of a Nuttall, except that the definition is fully metric, with a height requirement of {{convert|600|m|0}}, and prominence requirement of {{convert|15|m|0}}.&lt;ref name="collins"&gt;Mountainviews, (2013), "A Guide to Ireland's Mountain Summits: The Vandeleur-Lynams &amp; the Arderins", Collins Books, Cork, {{ISBN|978-1-84889-164-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As with the Nuttalls, Vandeleur-Lynams do not meet the UIAA requirements for a "peak" or "mountain".&lt;ref name="uiaa"/&gt;  In 1952, Irish climber Joss Lynam produced a list of 2,000 ft Irish summits with 50 ft drop with assistance from Rev CRP Vandeleur.  Lynam updated a version of this list and published it in a reprint of "Mountaineering in Ireland" by Claude Wall, printed in 1976.

The '''Arderins''' are mountains in Ireland above {{convert|500|m|0|abbr=on}}, with a prominence over {{convert|30|m|0|abbr=on}}.  The list was drawn up in 2002 by the Irish ''MountainViews'' publisher Simon Stewart from an early listing of the Myrddyn Deweys with hills from the Vandeleur-Lynams which meet the higher prominence criterion. The name, Arderins, was used in 2009, comes from the 527 m hill, [[Arderin]], which is the County Top for [[County Laois]] and [[County Offaly]] in Ireland, and translates as "Height of Ireland".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hill-bagging.co.uk/Arderins.php|title=The Arderins|publisher=HillBagging.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Arderins were published in the 2013 book, "A Guide to Ireland's Mountain Summits: The Vandeleur-Lynams &amp; the Arderins".&lt;ref name="collins"/&gt;  According to the MountainViews Online Database, Ireland has 407 Arderins,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mountainviews.ie/lists/arderin/|title=Arderins: Irish mountains of 500+m with a prominence of 30m|publisher=MountainViews.ie|date=October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; of which 207 are over 2,000 ft and classed as Hewitts, and the 222 are over 600 m and classed as Simms.{{efn|name="mv"}}

In addition, Mountainviews uses the term '''Arderin Begs''' for the additional class of peaks over {{convert|500|m|0|abbr=on}} in height, and with a prominence between {{convert|15-30|m|0|abbr=on}}.

===MountainViews===

(height 500 m, prominence 100 m)

In 2013, Simon Stewart, publisher of Irish mountain database ''[[List of mountains in Ireland#MountainViews Online Database|MountainViews Online Database]]'', published: "A Guide to Ireland's Mountain Summits: The Vandeleur-Lynams &amp; the Arderins".&lt;ref name="collins"/&gt; In the book, Stewart proposed a new classification of an Irish mountain, being one with a  height above {{convert|500|m|0|abbr=on}}, and a prominence over {{convert|100|m|0|abbr=on}}.  Stewart identified 222 Irish peaks as meeting his new classification.

[[File:Poplar muskeg.JPG|thumb|right|[[Populus|Poplar]] growing on muskeg]]

'''Muskeg''' ({{lang-cr|maskek}}; {{lang-fr|fondrière de mousse}}, lit. ''moss bog'') is an [[Soil pH|acidic soil]] type common in [[Arctic]] and [[boreal ecosystem|boreal]] areas, although it is found in other northern climates as well. Muskeg is approximately synonymous with [[bogland]], but "muskeg" is the standard term in Western Canada and Alaska, while 'bog' is common elsewhere. The term became common in these areas because it is of [[Cree language|Cree]] origin; ''maskek'' (ᒪᐢᑫᐠ) meaning low-lying marsh.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.creedictionary.com/search/?q=muskeg&amp;scope=3|title=Maskek|author=Cree Dictionary|accessdate=2009-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Large tracts of this soil existing in Siberia may be called muskeg or bogland interchangeably. 

Muskeg consists of dead plants in various states of [[decomposition]] (as [[peat]]), ranging from fairly intact sphagnum [[moss]], to sedge peat, to highly decomposed [[humus]]. Pieces of [[wood]] can make up five to fifteen percent of the peat [[soil]]. Muskeg tends to have a [[water table]] near the surface. The [[sphagnum]] moss forming it can hold fifteen to thirty times its own weight in water, allowing the spongy wet muskeg to form on sloping ground. Muskeg patches are ideal habitats for [[beaver]]s, [[pitcher plant]]s, [[agaricales|agaric mushrooms]] and a variety of other organisms.

==Composition==

Muskeg forms because [[permafrost]], [[clay]] or [[bedrock]] prevents water drainage. The water from rain and snow collects, forming permanently waterlogged vegetation and stagnant pools. Muskeg is wet, acidic, and relatively infertile, which prevents large trees from growing, although stunted [[Pinus contorta|shore pine]], [[Populus sect. Aigeiros|cottonwood]], some species of [[willow]], and [[Picea mariana|black spruce]] are typically found in these habitats.&lt;ref&gt;C. Michael Hogan. 2008&lt;/ref&gt; It needs two conditions to develop: abundant rain and cool summers. A dead plant that falls on dry soil is normally attacked by [[bacteria]] and [[fungus|fungi]] and quickly rots. If the same plant lands in water or on saturated soil, it decomposes differently. Less oxygen is available under water, so aerobic bacteria and fungi fail to colonize the submerged debris effectively. In addition, cool temperatures retard bacterial and fungal growth. This causes slow decomposition, and thus the plant debris gradually accumulates to form [[peat]] and eventually muskeg. Depending on the underlying [[topography]] of the land, muskeg can reach depths greater than 30 metres (100&amp;nbsp;ft).

==Description==

Although at first glance muskeg resembles a [[plain]] covered with short grasses, a closer look reveals a bizarre and almost unearthly landscape. Small stands of stunted and often dead trees, which vaguely resemble [[Bonsai tree]]s, grow where land protrudes above the [[water table]], with small pools of water stained dark red scattered about. Its grassland appearance invites the unwary to walk on it, but even the most solid muskeg is spongy and waterlogged. Traveling through muskeg is a strange and dangerous experience for the unaccustomed. Muskeg can grow atop bodies of water, especially small ponds and streams. Because of the water beneath, the muskeg surface sometimes ripples underfoot. Thinner patches allow large animals to fall through, becoming trapped under the muskeg and drowning. [[Moose]] are at a special disadvantage in muskeg due to their long legs, minimal hoof area, and great weight. Hunters and hikers may occasionally encounter young moose in muskeg-covered ponds submerged up to their torsos or necks, having been unaware of the unstable ground.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

==Surface strength==

[[File:muskeg D6 caterpillar.jpg|thumb|right|Heavy equipment breaking through thawing muskeg in [[Wabasca oil field]], Alberta.]]

Muskeg can be a significant impediment to transportation. During the 1870s, muskeg in [[Northern Ontario]] was reported to have swallowed a [[railroad]] [[Locomotive|engine]] whole when a track was laid on muskeg instead of clearing down to [[bedrock]].{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Many other instances have been reported of heavy construction equipment vanishing into muskeg in the [[Spring (season)|spring]] as the frozen muskeg beneath the vehicle thawed. Construction in muskeg-laden areas sometimes requires the complete removal of the soil and filling with gravel. If the muskeg is not completely cleared to bedrock, its high water content will cause buckling and distortion from winter freezing, much like [[permafrost]].

One method of working atop muskeg is to place large logs on the ground, covered with a thick layer of [[clay]] or other stable material. This is commonly called a [[corduroy road]]. To increase the effectiveness of the corduroy, prevent [[erosion]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infratrans.gov.ab.ca/686.htm Government of Alberta: Geotechnical and Erosion Control&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071221080438/http://www.infratrans.gov.ab.ca/686.htm |date=2007-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and allow removal of material with less disturbance to the muskeg, a [[geotextile]] fabric is sometimes placed down before the logs.  However temporary winter access roads on muskeg ([[ice road]]), created by clearing the insulating snow and allowing the muskeg to freeze, are more commonly used as they are cheaper to construct and easier to decommission. Water is often sprayed on these roads to thicken the ice allowing heavy trucks and equipment to safely access remote sites in the winter {{citation needed|date=June 2016}}.

== In fiction ==
In [[Jack London]]'s short story, "Love of Life," the starving protagonist eats muskeg berries along the trail.  "A muskeg berry is a bit of seed enclosed in a bit of water.  In the mouth the water melts away and the seed chews sharp and bitter.  The man knew there was no nourishment in the berries, but he chewed them patiently with a hope greater than knowledge and defying experience."
And in [[Hadley Mentzer]]'s inspiration speech "Freedom of spech, freedom of muskegs," she made to say "Muskegs are not bad. Drinking the soup from their waters is one of the heathiest things that this town does."
Also, in [[Rick Riordan]]'s young adult novel "The son of Neptune", one of the protagonists accidentally gets swallowed by muskeg soil as a trap laid by the Earth goddess [[Gaia]].

'''Newtown''', is a district in the [[Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago]]. Over the years Newtown has evolved into a fairly well developed business area with large residences being converted into business places or being torn down with the intention to build a more business like location.

==Churches within the Newtown area: St. Patrick's R.C. Church and St. Crispin's Anglican Church==

One of the older buildings which has retained most of its historical look is the St. Patrick's R.C. Church.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.trinidadexpress.com/news/St-Patricks-Church-still-needs-help-256102541.html&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, renovations to the roof and other areas were completed with funds raised by the parishioners over a number of years. This church boasts of several stained glass windows and is styled in a similar manner to the St. Crispin's Anglican Church which is located a few streets away in close proximity to the Siegert Square. Both churches have antique baptismal fonts at the back of the church.

==Schools within the Newtown area==

Newtown is one of the areas which had at least one primary school for boys and one for girls, which is the Newtown Boys and Newtown Girls. Known for success in academics and Music Festival competitions, these schools are located on either side of the St. Patrick's R.C. Church with access from Maraval Road.

There are also private secondary schools and Government run schools located in close proximity to Maraval Road and Tragarete Road, such as Wood Brook Secondary School  and St. Cecelia's Private Secondary School.

Over the years a branch of a tertiary educational institute, SBCS, has offered its services from two locations on Picton Street.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sbcs.edu.tt/campuses/port-of-spain-campus/&lt;/ref&gt;

The Paradajz is located across the easternmost tip of Ada Huja and right in front of the banks of the neighborhood of [[Višnjica, Serbia|Višnjica]], approximately at the Danube's {{convert|1163|km|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="plovidba"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plovidba.info/forum/saveti-i-uputstva/ono-sto-znamo-i-ne-znamo-o-dunavu/|author=|title= Ono što znamo i ne znamo o Dunavu|date=20 August 2009|publisher=|language=Serbian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==

The island began to form around 1986, due to the [[alluvial]] silt brought by the Danube. Until 2011 it grew to an area of {{convert|2|ha|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Politika"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.politika.rs/sr/clanak/193290/Oaza-na-ostrvu-samoniklog-paradajza|author=Dimitrije Bukvić|title= Oaza na ostrvu samoniklog paradajza|date=4 October 2011|publisher= [[Politika]]|language=Serbian}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the island expanded, it formed a canal in front of Višnjica. Canal is named "Karlica" and is today considered the better access path to Ada Huja's bay of Rukavac where the Višnjica Marina is located.&lt;ref name="plovidba"/&gt; The island was originally round but by 2017 it got elongated and grew into the almost perfectly symmetrical eye shape. 

Name of the island, Paradajz, means tomato in Serbian language. One theory is that it got the name thanks to its original round shape. Another one claims that the name originates from the tomatoes which began to grow wild on the island.&lt;ref name="Politika"/&gt;

==Wildlife==

Paradajz is heavily forested. In 2012, planting of the [[common osier]] began on the island in order to clean and filter the waters on the shore.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = | first = | author = Dimitrije Bukvić | title = Odmor u prirodi za 50 dinara| newspaper = [[Politika]] | pages =  | language = Serbian | date = 10 March 2012 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human interaction==

Belgraders began to visit the island from 2006. First major work on Paradajz was done in 2011, when in the period of six months the island was cleaned from the waste brought constantly to the shores by the Danube. The overgrowth was partially cleared and small green zones are created. Using only wooden material from the island, wooden amphitheater and a [[futsal]] court were built. Dry and cleared wood was grinded into the sawdust which was used for the creation of a {{convert|2|km|abbr=on}} long [[trim trail]] which circles around the island.&lt;ref name="Politika"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = | first = | author = Dimitrije Bukvić | title = Niče ostrvo Paradajz| newspaper = [[Politika]] | pages =  | language = Serbian | date = 1 September 2011 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest terraces (T1) are higher standing than the younger terraces (T3). The present floodplain (T4) will soon become the youngest terrace surface as the river incises.]]
[[Terrace (geology)|Terrace]]s can be formed in many ways and in several geologic and environmental settings. By studying the size, shape, and age of terraces, one can determine the geologic processes that formed them.  When terraces have the same age and/or shape over a region, it is often indicative that a large-scale geologic or environmental mechanism is responsible. [[Tectonic uplift]] and [[climate change]] are viewed as dominant mechanisms that can shape the earth’s surface through [[erosion]]. River terraces can be influenced by one or both of these forcing mechanisms and therefore can be used to study variation in tectonics, climate, and erosion, and how these processes interact.

==River terrace formation==
[[File:Rio Grande White Rock Overlook Park View 2006 09 05.jpg|450px|thumbnail|right|The Rio Grande, flowing down through the Rio Grande Rift for the last several million years. The last stage of incision by the river is thought to be driven by the Milankovitch [[Eccentricity(orbit)|eccentricity]] cycle. Increased precipitation and sediment supply drove incision of the high standing terraces, beginning at ~800ka.&lt;ref name="Leeder"&gt;Leeder, M.R., and Mack, G.M., 2002, Basin-fill incision, Rio Grande and Gulf of Corinth rifts: Convergent response to climatic and tectonic drivers, in, Nichols, G., Williams, E., and Paola, C., eds., Sedimentary Processes, Environments and Basins: A tribute to Peter Friend: International Association of Sedimentologists Special Publication No. 38, p. 9-27.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Long-lived river ([[fluvial]]) systems can produce a series of [[terrace (geology)|terrace]] surfaces over the course of their geologic lifetime.  When rivers [[Aggradation|flood]], sediment deposits in sheets across the [[floodplain]] and build up over time.  Later, during a time of river erosion, this sediment is cut into, or [[River incision|incised]], by the river and flushed downstream.  The previous floodplain is therefore abandoned and becomes a river terrace.  A river terrace is composed of an abandoned surface, or tread, and the incised surface, or riser.&lt;ref name="Easterbrook"&gt;Easterbrook, D.J., 1999, Surface Processes and Landforms: New York, New York, Prentice Hall, 546 p.&lt;/ref&gt;   If you can date the age of the terrace tread, one can get an estimate of the age of abandonment of that surface, and the age of incision.  A simple calculation of h&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;  can give the average rate of incision(r&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;), where h&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = height of river terrace from river and t&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = age of surface.&lt;ref name="Blum"&gt;Blum, M.D., and Tornqvist, T. E., 2000, Fluvial responses to climate and sea-level change: a review and look forward: Sedimentology, 47, p. 2-48.&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note that these rates of incision assume a constant rate of incision over the entire height and time.

===Age of terraces===

====Time of incision versus time of aggradation====
The ages of incision and flooding ([[aggradation]]) can have different interpretations for each fluvial system, where each region may respond independently to external variation. Many variables control the behavior of the river and whether it erodes or floods.  Changes in the steepness of the stream gradient, the [[Sediment flux|amount of sediment]] contained in the river, and the [[Discharge (hydrology)|total amount of water]] flowing through the system, all influence how a river behaves.  There is a delicate equilibrium that controls a river system, which, when disturbed, causes flooding and incising events to occur and produce terracing.&lt;ref name="Blum" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Schumm"&gt;Schumm, S., 1979, The fluvial system: Blackburn Press, 338 p.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dating of these abandoned terrace surfaces (treads) is possible using a variety of [[Geochronology|geochronologic]] techniques.  The type of technique used, however, is dependent on the composition and age of the terraces.  Currently used techniques are [[magnetostratigraphy]], low temperature [[thermochronology]], [[cosmogenic nuclide]]s, [[Carbon-14|radiocarbon]], [[Thermoluminescence dating|thermoluminescence]], [[optically stimulated luminescence]], and [[Uranium–thorium dating|U-Th disequilibria]]. Additionally, if there is a succession of preserved fossils, [[biostratigraphy]] can be used.

====Scale of observation====
Scale of observation is always a factor when evaluating tectonic and climatic forcing.  At a glimpse in geologic time, one of these forcing mechanisms may look to be the dominant process.  Observations made on long geologic times scales (≥10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;[[annum]]) typically reveal much about slower, larger-magnitude geologic processes such as tectonism&lt;ref name="Einsele"&gt;Einsele, G., Ricken, W., Sielacher, A., 1991, Cycles and events in stratigraphy: basic concepts and terms, in Einsele, G., Ricken, W., and Sielacher, A., eds., Cycles and events in Stratigraphy, New York, Springer-Verlag, pp 1-19.&lt;/ref&gt; from a regional to even global scale.  Evaluation on geologically short time scales (10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;-10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; [[annum|a]]) can reveal much about the relatively shorter climatic cycles,&lt;ref name="Einsele"/&gt; local to regional erosion, and how they could drive terrace development. Regional periods of terrace formation likely mark a time of when stream erosion was much greater than sediment accumulation.  River erosion can be driven by tectonic uplift, climate, or potentially both mechanisms.  It is difficult in many areas, however, to decisively pinpoint whether tectonism or climate change can individually drive tectonic uplift, enhanced erosion, and therefore terrace formation.  In many cases, simplifying the geologic issue to tectonic-driven vs. climate-driven is a mistake because tectonic-climate interactions occur together in a positive feedback cycle.

==Climate and terraces==
[[File:Marine Terrace diagram(plain svg).svg|300px|thumbnail|right|A schematic diagram of the morphology of coastal/marine terraces. Periodic uplift will force old shorelines up, which create the terrace treads.  Wave erosion on these old shorelines will produce the scarp, or terrace riser.]]
[[File:Himalayas landsat 7.png|400px|thumbnail|right|A satellite image of the Himalayas and the rainshadow effect. Development of the Himalayan front and [[Monsoon of Indian subcontinent|South Asian Monsoon]] is thought to be driven by tectonic-climatic interactions.]]

Rivers in continental interiors that have not experienced tectonic activity in the geological recent history likely record climatic changes through terracing.  Terraces record natural, periodic variations driven by cycles such as the [[Milankovitch cycles|Milankovitch cycle]].  These cycles can describe how the Earth's orbit and rotational wobble vary over time. The Milankovitch cycles, along with [[solar forcing]], have been determined to drive periodic environmental change on a global scale, namely between [[glacial]] and [[interglacial]] environments. Each river system will respond to these climate variations on a regional scale. In addition, the regional environment will determine how change in sediment and precipitation will drive river incision and aggradation.  Terraces along the river will record the cyclic changes, where glacial and interglacial time periods are associated with either incision or aggradation.

==Tectonic uplift and terraces==
In contrast, coastal marine terraces can be preserved only by tectonism or a progressive lowering of sea level. The seismically active coastline of southern California, USA,&lt;ref name="Lajoie"&gt;Lajoie, K.R.,  1986, Coastal Tectonics, in Active Tectonics: studies in geophysics: Washington, D.C., National Academy Press, 266 p.&lt;/ref&gt; for example, can be considered an [[emergent coastline]], where tectonism due to transpression provides uplift of shorelines formed during periods of relatively high sea level.  Subsequent wave erosion along uplifted portions of the coastline produces an inset wave cut platform and terrace riser below the abandoned marine terrace surface that formed initially at sea level.  Uplift can therefore lead to a sequence of marine terraces at a few distinct elevations along the coast. Although these surfaces formed at  sea level maxima during interglacial periods, the landforms are preserved solely due to tectonic uplift.

==Tectonic–climatic interactions and terraces==
Tectonic uplift and climatic factors interact as a [[Climate change feedback|positive feedback system]], where each forcing mechanism drives the other. One of the greatest examples of this feedback between [[Tectonic–climatic interactions|tectonic and climatic interactions]] may be preserved in the [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] front and in the development of the [[Rain shadow|rain shadow effect]] and the [[Monsoon of South Asia|Asian Monsoon]].

The Himalayas act as an [[orographic]] barrier that can impede [[atmospheric circulation]] and moving air masses. When these air masses try to move up and over the Himalaya, they are forced up against the barrier. The mass condenses as it rises, releasing moisture, which results in [[Orographic precipitation|precipitation]] on that flank of the mountains. As the air mass moves over the mountain, it gradually becomes drier until it descends on the other side of the barrier with little moisture left. This effect is known the "[[Rain shadow| rain shadow effect]]. In the Himalaya, this barrier effect is so great that it was an important environmental factor in developing the Asian Monsoon.&lt;ref name="Zhisheng"&gt;Zisheng, A., Kutzbach, J. E., Prell, W. L., and Porter, S. C., 2001, "Evolution of Asian monsoons and phased uplift of the Himalayan–Tibetan plateau since Late Miocene times": ''Nature'', 411, p. 62-66&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clift and Plumb, 2008"&gt;Clift, P. D., and Plumb, R. A., ''The Asian Monsoon: Causes, history and effects'': Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 270 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clift et al. 2010"&gt;Clift, P. D., Tada, R., and Zheng, H., ''Monsoon evolution and tectonics-climate linkages in Asian:an introduction'': Geological Society of London Special Publications, 342, p. 1–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tectonic uplift during the creation of high mountainous regions can produce incredible surface elevations and therefore exposure of rocks to wind and water. High precipitation can drive enhanced erosion of the exposed rocks and lead to rapid [[denudation]] of sediment from the mountains. Buoyancy of the crust, or [[isostasy]], will then drive further tectonic uplift, in order to achieve equilibrium, as sediment is continuously stripped from the top.&lt;ref name="Pinter and Brandon"&gt;Pinter, N., and Brandon, M. T., 1997, "How erosion builds mountains": ''Scientific American'', 1997, p. 74–79.&lt;/ref&gt;  Enhanced uplift will then create higher topography, drive increased precipitation which will concentrate erosion, and further uplift.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2446">The [[Russian Empire]] began its interest of the [[Pacific Northwest]] in the 18th century, initially curious if there was a land connection between the [[Eurasia]]n and [[North America]]n Continents. Two expeditions were led by [[Vitus Bering]], with the findings proving the separation of two continents through the [[Bering Sea]]. Being the first European nation to chart much of what comprises the modern [[United States of America|American]] state of [[Alaska]], many locations retain Russian place names. The discovery of sizable fur bearing populations by Bering drew the attention of [[promyshlenniki]] previously engaged in the [[Siberian fur trade]]. Based out of the [[Siberia]]n ports of [[Okhotsk]] or [[Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky|Petropavlovsk]], fur trappers sailed and reported the location of land formations like the [[Aleutian Islands]], [[Kodiak Island]] and portions of the Alaskan mainland. Relations with [[Native Alaskan]]s was often terse due to the uncontrolled actions of particular promyshlenniki who killed and raped Indigenous on islands they trapped furs.&lt;ref&gt;Makarova, Raisa A. ''Russians on the Pacific 1743-1799.'' ed. Richard A. Pierce and Alton S. Donnelly. Kingston, ON: Limestone Press, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the mid century the creation of companies was required to shoulder the increasing operational costs. [[Grigory Shelikhov]] was prominent amongst these rising merchants, creating Russian settlements on Kodiak Island and later perpetrating the deaths of many [[Alutiiq]]s in the [[Awa'uq Massacre]]. With the [[Ukase of 1799]] the Russian Empire gave the [[Shelikhov-Golikov Company|United American Company]] (the successor to Shelikhov's organization) a [[monopoly]] among Russian fur companies over North America to the 55° N latitude. The newly formed [[Russian-American Company]] (RAC) was expected to additionally create new colonies to strengthen the Russian claims to the region. The RAC funded in part or wholly expeditions of the [[Imperial Russian Navy]] like the [[First Russian circumnavigation]]. The [[Russo-American Treaty of 1824]] and the [[Russo-British Treaty of 1825]] formalised the claims of [[Russian America]], essentially the borders of Alaska.

The '''Saint Lawrence River''' ({{lang-fr|Fleuve Saint-Laurent}}; [[Tuscarora language|Tuscarora]]: ''Kahnawáʼkye'';&lt;ref&gt;Rudes, B. ''Tuscarora English Dictionary'' Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mohawk language|Mohawk]]: ''Kaniatarowanenneh'', meaning "big waterway") is a large [[river]] in the middle latitudes of [[North America]]. The Saint Lawrence River flows in a roughly north-easterly direction, connecting the [[Great Lakes]] with the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and forming the [[outflow (hydrology)|primary drainage outflow]] of the [[Great Lakes Basin]]. It traverses the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian provinces]] of [[Quebec]] and [[Ontario]], and is part of the [[Canada–United States border|international boundary]] between Ontario, Canada, and the [[U.S. state]] of [[New York (state)|New York]]. This river also provides the basis of the commercial [[Saint Lawrence Seaway]].

==Geography==

The Saint Lawrence River begins at the outflow of [[Lake Ontario]] and flows adjacent to [[Gananoque, Ontario|Gananoque]], [[Brockville]], [[Morristown, New York|Morristown]], [[Ogdensburg, New York|Ogdensburg]], [[Massena (village), New York|Massena]], [[Cornwall, Ontario|Cornwall]], [[Montreal]], [[Trois-Rivières]], and [[Quebec City]] before draining into the [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence]], the largest [[estuary]] in the world.&lt;ref name="HuffPo"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Arkus|first1=Mike|title=Down the St. Lawrence, the World’s Largest Estuary: Canadian Odyssey on the Looney Front - Part 21|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mike-arkus/down-the-st-lawrence-the_b_5665013.html|accessdate=12 February 2017|work=Huffington Post|date=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The estuary begins at the eastern tip of [[Île d'Orléans]], just downstream from Quebec City.&lt;ref name="BenkeCushing2005"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Benke|first1=Arthur C.|last2=Cushing|first2=Colbert E.|title=Rivers of North America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=faOU1wkiYFIC&amp;pg=PA989|accessdate=21 March 2011|year=2005|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-12-088253-3|pages=989–990}}&lt;/ref&gt; The river becomes tidal around Quebec City.&lt;ref name="Dawson2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dawson|first=Samuel Edward|title=The Saint Lawrence: Its Basin and Border-lands|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r-LZjcqnPtEC&amp;pg=PR36|accessdate=21 March 2011|date=October 2007|publisher=Heritage Books|isbn=978-0-7884-2252-2|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Saint Lawrence River runs {{convert|3058|km|mi|sigfig=4|lk=on}} from the farthest headwater to the mouth and {{convert|1197|km|mi|1|abbr=on}} from the outflow of Lake Ontario. These numbers include the estuary; without the estuary the length from Lake Ontario is ca. 500 km (ca. 300 mi). The farthest headwater is the [[North River (Minnesota)|North River]] in the [[Mesabi Range]] at [[Hibbing]], Minnesota. Its drainage area, which includes the Great Lakes, the world's largest system of freshwater lakes, is {{convert|1344200|km2|sqmi|1|sigfig=5}}, of which {{convert|839200|km2|sqmi|1|abbr=on|sigfig=4}} is in Canada and {{convert|505000|km2|sqmi|1|abbr=on|sigfig=4}} is in the United States. The basin covers parts of [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]] in Canada, parts of [[Illinois]], [[Indiana]], [[Minnesota]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Ohio]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[Vermont]], and [[Wisconsin]], and nearly the entirety of the state of [[Michigan]] in the United States. The average discharge below the [[Saguenay River]] is {{convert|16800|m3/s|cuft/s}}. At Quebec City, it is {{convert|12101|m3/s|cuft/s|abbr=on}}. The average discharge at the river's source, the outflow of Lake Ontario, is {{convert|7410|m3/s|cuft/s|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="BenkeCushing2005"/&gt;

The Saint Lawrence River includes [[Lake Saint-Louis]] south of [[Montreal]], [[Lake Saint Francis (Canada)|Lake Saint Francis]] at [[Salaberry-de-Valleyfield]] and [[Lac Saint-Pierre]] east of Montreal. It encompasses four [[archipelago]]es: the [[Thousand Islands]] chain near [[Alexandria Bay, New York]] and [[Kingston, Ontario]]; the [[Hochelaga Archipelago]], including the [[Island of Montreal]] and [[Île Jésus]] ([[Laval, Quebec|Laval]]); the Lake St.&amp;nbsp;Pierre Archipelago (classified biosphere world reserve by the UNESCO in 2000)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pleinairalacarte.com/qc/monteregie/lac-saint-pierre-et-son-archipel.html Lac Saint-Pierre et son archipel]. Pleinairalacarte.com (2008-11-07). Retrieved on 2013-07-12.&lt;/ref&gt; and the smaller [[Mingan Archipelago]]. Other islands include Île d'Orléans near Quebec City and [[Anticosti Island]] north of the [[Gaspé Peninsula|Gaspé]]. It is the second longest river in Canada.

[[Lake Champlain]] and the [[Ottawa River|Ottawa]], [[Richelieu River|Richelieu]], [[Saint-Maurice River|Saint-Maurice]], [[Saint-Francois River|Saint-François]] and Saguenay rivers drain into the Saint Lawrence.

The Saint Lawrence River is in a seismically active zone where [[fault (geology)|fault]] reactivation is believed to occur along late [[Proterozoic]] to early [[Paleozoic]] normal faults related to the opening of [[Iapetus Ocean]]. The faults in the area are [[rift]]-related and comprise the [[Saint Lawrence rift system]].

According to the United States Geological Survey, the Saint Lawrence Valley is a [[Physiographic regions of the world|physiographic province]] of the larger [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachian]] division, containing the [[Champlain Valley|Champlain]] and Northern physiographic section.&lt;ref name="USGS-Water"&gt;{{cite web | title = Physiographic divisions of the conterminous U.S. | publisher = U.S. Geological Survey | url = http://water.usgs.gov/GIS/metadata/usgswrd/XML/physio.xml | accessdate = 2007-12-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in Canada, where most of the valley is, it is instead considered part of a distinct [[Saint Lawrence Lowlands]] physiographic division, and not part of the Appalachian division at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Physiographic Regions of Canada|url=http://ftp.geogratis.gc.ca/pub/nrcan_rncan/raster/atlas_6_ed/reference/eng/physiographic_eng.pdf|website=Natural Resources Canada|publisher=Natural Resources Canada|accessdate=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Norse colonization of the Americas|Norse explored]] the Gulf of Saint Lawrence in the 11th century and were followed by fifteenth and early sixteenth century European mariners, such as [[John Cabot]], and the brothers [[Gaspar Corte Real|Gaspar]] and [[Miguel Corte-Real]]. The first European explorer known to have sailed up the Saint Lawrence River itself was [[Jacques Cartier]]. At that time, the land along the river was inhabited by the [[St. Lawrence Iroquoians]]; at the time of Cartier's second voyage in 1535. Because Cartier arrived in the estuary on [[Lawrence of Rome|Saint Lawrence]]'s feast day, he named it the ''Gulf of Saint Lawrence''.&lt;ref&gt;

The Saint Lawrence River is partly within the U.S. and as such is that country's sixth oldest surviving European place-name.&lt;ref&gt;The Spanish names [[Florida]], [[Dry Tortugas]], [[Cape Canaveral]], [[Appalachia]]n, and [[California]] appeared earlier.....From Spanish historian [[Antonio de Herrera y Tordesillas]]'s accounts, published in 1601 -- {{cite book |title=Names on the Land: A Historical Account of Place-Naming in the United States |last= Stewart|first=George |authorlink=George R. Stewart|year=1945 |publisher= Random House|location=New York |pages= 11–17, 29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest regular Europeans in the area were the [[History of the Basque people#Modern Period|Basques]], who came to the St Lawrence Gulf and River in pursuit of whales from the early 16th century. The [[History of Basque whaling|Basque whalers]] and fishermen traded with indigenous Americans and set up settlements, leaving vestiges all over the coast of eastern Canada and deep into the Saint Lawrence River. Basque commercial and fishing activity reached its peak before the ''[[Armada Invencible]]'''s disaster (1588), when the Spanish Basque whaling fleet was confiscated by King [[Philip II of Spain]] and largely destroyed. Initially, the whaling galleons from [[Labourd]] were not affected by the Spanish defeat.

Until the early 17th century, the French used the name ''Rivière du Canada'' to designate the Saint Lawrence upstream to Montreal and the Ottawa River after Montreal. The Saint Lawrence River served as the main route for European exploration of the North American interior, first pioneered by French explorer [[Samuel de Champlain]].

Control of the river was crucial to [[Great Britain in the Seven Years War|British strategy to capture New France]] in the [[Seven Years' War]]. Having [[Siege of Louisbourg (1758)|captured Louisbourg]] in 1758, the British sailed up to Quebec the following year thanks to charts drawn up by [[James Cook]]. British troops were ferried via the Saint Lawrence to attack the city from the west, which they successfully did at the [[Battle of the Plains of Abraham]]. The river was used again by the British [[Battle of Neuville|to defeat]] the French siege of Quebec under the [[Chevalier de Lévis]] in 1760.

Because of the virtually impassable [[Lachine Rapids]], the Saint Lawrence was once continuously navigable only as far as Montreal. Opened in 1825, the [[Lachine Canal]] was the first to allow ships to pass the rapids. An extensive system of canals and locks, known as the [[Saint Lawrence Seaway]], was officially opened on 26 June 1959 by [[Elizabeth II]] (representing Canada) and President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] (representing the United States). The Seaway now permits ocean-going vessels to pass all the way to [[Lake Superior]].

During the [[World War II|Second World War]], the [[Battle of the St. Lawrence]] involved submarine and anti-submarine actions throughout the lower Saint Lawrence River and the entire [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence]], [[Strait of Belle Isle]] and [[Cabot Strait]] from May to October 1942, September 1943, and again in October and November 1944. During this time, German [[U-boat]]s sank several merchant marine ships and three Canadian warships.

In the late 1970s, the river was the subject of a successful ecological campaign (called "Save the River"), originally responding to planned development by the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]]. The campaign was organized, among others, by [[Abbie Hoffman]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

==Sources==

The source of the North River in the [[Mesabi Range]] in [[Minnesota]] (Seven Beaver Lake) is considered to be the source of the Saint Lawrence River. Because it crosses so many lakes, the water system frequently changes its name. From source to mouth, the names are:

==Works==
The Saint Lawrence River is at the heart of many Quebec novels ([[Anne Hébert]]'s ''[[Kamouraska (novel)|Kamouraska]]'', [[Réjean Ducharme]]'s ''[[L'avalée des avalés]]''), poems (in works of [[Pierre Morency]], [[Bernard Pozier]]), and songs ([[Leonard Cohen]]'s "[[Suzanne (Leonard Cohen song)|Suzanne]]", Michel Rivard's "L'oubli", [[Joe Dassin]]'s "[[Dans les yeux d'Émilie]]"), and [[André Gagnon]]'s "Le Saint-Laurent"). The river was the setting for the Canadian television drama series [[Seaway (TV series)|Seaway]]. The river has also been portrayed in paintings, notably by the [[Group of Seven (artists)|Group of Seven]]. In addition, the river is the namesake of [[Saint-Laurent Herald]] at the [[Canadian Heraldic Authority]].

In 1980 [[Jacques Cousteau]] traveled to Canada to make two films on the Saint Lawrence River and the [[Great Lakes]], ''[[Cries from the Deep]]'' and ''St. Lawrence: Stairway to the Sea''.&lt;ref name="Canada"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.nfb.ca/2009/10/23/jacques-cousteau-in-canada/|title=When Cousteau Came to Canada|last=Ohayon|first=Albert|year=2009|work=NFB.ca|publisher=National Film Board of Canada|accessdate=2009-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Musician [[David Usher]] released the song "St. Lawrence River" on his ''[[Little Songs (David Usher album)|Little Songs]]'' album in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.ca/Little-Songs-Usher-David/dp/B000065Q67/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1410971002&amp;sr=8-5&amp;keywords=little+songs&lt;/ref&gt;

The novel and film [[Black Robe]] is set primarily on the St. Lawrence River during the 17th century.

'''Scrub Island''' is an {{convert|8|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} island lying off the eastern tip of the main island of [[Anguilla]], a [[British Overseas Territory]] in the [[Caribbean]]. It is easily reached by boat. Privately owned, the remains of an abandoned air field still exist. There are several abandoned houses on the island, mainly due to damage from hurricanes. There is no electricity or plumbing.

==Fauna==
The island has been identified as an [[Important Bird Area]] by [[BirdLife International]], mainly because  of its nesting [[seabird]]s.  These are [[laughing gull]]s as well as [[royal tern|royal]], [[roseate tern|roseate]] and [[least tern]]s.  Resident landbirds include [[Caribbean elaenia]]s and [[pearly-eyed thrasher]]s.  The island's five species of reptiles comprise the [[Anguilla Bank ameiva]], ''[[Anguilla Bank anole|Anolis gingivinus]]'', [[Sphaerodactylus parvus|little dwarf gecko]], [[Sphaerodactylus sputator|island dwarf gecko]] and the [[endangered species|endangered]] [[leeward island racer]].  [[Green turtle|Green]] and [[leatherback turtle]]s have been recorded.  [[Feral goat]]s and [[rat]]s are present.&lt;ref name=bli&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.birdlife.org |title= Scrub Island|accessdate=2012-11-23 |work= BirdLife data zone: Important Bird Areas |first= |last= |publisher= BirdLife International |date= 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Whale]]s are commonly seen west of Scrub, along the southern coastline.

The '''Taipei–Keelung metropolitan area''' ({{zh||t=臺北基隆都會區|p=Táiběi-Jīlóng Dūhùiqū}}) also commonly known as '''Greater Taipei Area''' ({{zh|t=大臺北地區|p=Dà Táiběi Dìqū}}) is the largest [[metropolitan area]] in [[Taiwan]]. It was recognized officially until 2010, and included [[Taipei]], Taipei County (now [[New Taipei]]), and [[Keelung]].

==Definition==
The official definition of the Taipei–Keelung metropolitan area by the government until 2010 was Taipei, Taipei County and Keelung.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4300">In [[Norse mythology|Norse]] legend, '''Valland''' is the name the part of Europe which is inhabited by [[Celts|Celtic]] and [[Italic peoples|Romance]] peoples.&lt;ref&gt;[http://runeberg.org/svetym/1174.html The entry ''Valnöt'' in ''Svensk etymologisk ordbok'' by Elof Hellquist (1922).]&lt;/ref&gt; The element ''Val-'' is derived from *''[[Walhaz]]'', a Proto-Germanic word traditionally translated as "foreigner", usually applied to the Celtic and Italic inhabitants of Europe.

==Mythological context==
In the genealogy section of ''[[Flateyjarbók]]'', there are two kings of Valland named Auði and [[Kjárr]], who may have been a late reflection of [[Julius Caesar]] and the [[Roman Emperor]]s in [[Norse mythology]]:&lt;ref name="carlaz"&gt;[http://www.carlaz.com/phd/cea_phd_chap2.pdf Anderson, Carl Edlund. (1999). ''Formation and Resolution of Ideological Contrast in the Early History of Scandinavia''. Ph.D. thesis, University of Cambridge, Department of Anglo-Saxon, Norse &amp; Celtic (Faculty of English). p. 44.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070307030753/http://www.carlaz.com/phd/cea_phd_chap2.pdf |date=2007-03-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

|
Auði ruled Valland and was the father of Fróði, the father of Kjár, the father of [[Alruna|Ölrún]].&lt;ref&gt;Translation provided by Wikipedia editors.&lt;/ref&gt;
|
|}

Kjárr and his daughter [[Alruna|Ölrún]] also appear in the ''[[Völundarkviða]]'', where she is a [[Valkyrie]] who marries the hero [[Agilaz|Egil]]:

Two of them were daughters of King Hlothver, Hlathguth the Swan-White and Hervor the All-Wise, and the third was Olrun, daughter of Kjar from Valland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/poe/poe17.htm Henry A. Bellows' translation of ''The Lay of Völund''.]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is mentioned in [[Illuga saga Gríðarfóstra]] that Hringr, the king of Denmark and son of Sköld dagsson, was married to Sigrid, who was the daughter of Vilhálm - or William - king of Valland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legendary and historical context==
In the ''[[Heimskringla]]'' by [[Snorri Sturluson]], Valland is mentioned several times as the [[Old Norse]] name for [[Gaul]]. It was the country where [[Rollo]] carved out [[Normandy]]:
:Rolf Ganger went afterwards over sea to the West to the Hebrides, or Sudreys; and at last farther west to Valland, where he plundered and subdued for himself a great earldom, which he peopled with Northmen, from which that land is called Normandy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.northvegr.org/lore/heim/003_05.php Harald Harfager's Saga at Northvegr.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Hrómundar saga Gripssonar]]'', the hero Hrómund slays an undead witch-king named Þráinn who had been the king of Valland.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6569">'''Omeyocan''' is the highest of thirteen heavens in [[Aztec mythology]], the dwelling place of [[Ometeotl]], the dual god comprising [[Ometecuhtli]] and [[Tonacacihuatl|Omecihuatl]].{{sfn|Agustín Robelo}}

==Etymology==
In Nahuatl, ōmeyōcān means "the place of duality." The word is composed of '''ōme''' ('two') and '''-yō''' (suffix for abstractions), which gives  '''ōmeyōtl''' or duality; and '''-cān''' (place).{{sfn|Dictionnaire}}
 
==Description==
Multiple Nahuatl sources, notably the ''[[Florentine Codex]]'', name the highest level of heaven Ōmeyōcān or "place of duality" (Sahagún specifically terms it "in ōmeyōcān in chiucnāuhnepaniuhcān" or "the place of duality, above the nine-tired heavens)."{{sfn|Sahagún book 6}}  In the ''[[Histoyre du Mechique]]'', Franciscan priest André Thevet translated a Nahuatl source reporting that in this layer of heaven there existed "a god named Ometecuhtli, which means two-gods, and one of them was a goddess."{{sfn|Garibay}} According to the ''[[Codex Ríos]]'', the ''[[History of the Mexicans as Told by Their Paintings]]'', the ''Histoyre du Mechique'', and the ''Florentine Codex'', the goddess of fertility and creation [[Tonacacihuatl|Tōnacācihuātl]] and her counterpart [[Tonacatecuhtli|Tōnacātēcuhtli]] resided in Ōmeyōcān, creating human souls and sending them to earth.{{sfn|Garibay}}{{sfn|Miller &amp; Taube}}{{sfn|Sahagún book 6}} Sahagún clarifies that their names are epithets of Ōmetēcuhtli (literally "two-lord") and Ōmecihuātl ("two-lady"), giving as an alternate name of Ōmeyōcān "in tōnacātēcuhtli īchān" ("the mansion of Tōnacātēcuhtli").{{sfn|Sahagún book 6}} 

There is some evidence that these two gods were considered aspects of a single being, as when a singer in ''[[Cantares Mexicanos]]'' asks where he can go given that "ōme ihcac yehhuān Dios" ("they, God, stand double").{{sfn|Bierhorst 1}} The ''History of the Mexicans as Told by Their Paintings'' reports of the two that "se criaron [sic] y estuvieron siempre en el treceno cielo, de cuyo principio no se supo jamás, sino de su estada y creación, que fue en el treceno cielo" (''they created themselves and had always been in the thirteenth heaven; nothing was ever known of their beginning, just their dwelling and creation, which were in the thirteenth heaven'').{{sfn|Garibay}} In the [[Florentine Codex]], Sahagún relates that Aztec midwives would tell newborns after bathing them, "You were created in the place of duality, the place above the nine heavens. Your mother and father—Ōmetēcuhtli and Ōmecihuātl, the heavenly lady—formed you, created you."{{sfn|Sahagún book 6}}

A song from the ''[[Historia Tolteca-Chichimeca]]'' mentions "ay ōmeteōtl ya tēyōcoyani," literally "two-god, creator of humanity."{{sfn|Kirchhoff et al.}} Many scholars (most notably [[Miguel León-Portilla]]) interpret this name "Ōmeteōtl" as "Dual God" or "Lord of the Duality," seeing it as a fusion of Ōmetēcuhtli and Ōmecihuātl, existing primordially in Ōmeyōcān. León-Portilla further argues that Ometeotl was the supreme [[creator deity]] of the Aztecs, and that the Aztecs envisioned this deity as a mystical entity with a dual nature akin to the European concept of the [[trinity]].{{sfn|León-Portilla}}
