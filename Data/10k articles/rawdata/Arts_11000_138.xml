'''Angelo Vergecio''' ({{lang-el|Άγγελος Βεργέκιος}}, {{lang-fr|Ange Vergèce}}; 1505–1569) was a [[Greeks|Greek]] copyist from [[Crete]] active in [[Venice]] and [[France]]. He became a royal scribe for [[Francis I of France]] and his successors, was responsible for copying over fifty Greek manuscripts, and played a role in the dissemination of Greek among the humanist circles in France. His handwriting formed the basis of the ''[[grecs du roi]]'' typeface designed by [[Claude Garamond]].

&lt;!--  Commented out: [[File:MagrittePipe.jpg|thumb|300px|''[[The Treachery Of Images]]'' (1928-29) by [[René Magritte]] depicts a pipe along with text stating "This is not a pipe."]] --&gt;

'''Anti-genre''' is a [[self-descriptive word|self-descriptive]] label attributed to any artistic style devoid of [[genre]].  This lack of genre-status can either be the result of:&lt;br /&gt;
(1) an active attempt to evade categorization (transcend all genres), &lt;br /&gt;
(2) conscious negation of the [[ethos]] of its medium (unlearning of history),&lt;br /&gt;
(3) an active and conscious negation of itself.

The anti-genre is not simply an assault on tradition (previous artistic styles), for every anti-thesis in history would then fall under this title. (see [[Anti-genre#Hard versus Soft|Hard versus Soft]] section)  The anti-genre, rather implies a more direct and [[Nihilism|nihilistic]] attack on the foundations of its medium.  The anti-genre is in a perpetual state of evasion both from external [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]], but also from itself.

The artistic movement known as [[Dada]] is likely the best example of the anti-genre, although the Dada manifestos of [[Hugo Ball]] and [[Tristan Tzara]] never use the term 'anti-genre' to describe Dada,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
DADA DOES NOT MEAN ANYTHING.  Every man must shout: there is great destructive, negative work to be done. To sweep, to clean.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.391.org/manifestos/19180323tristantzara_dadamanifesto.htm Tzara, Tristan (1918) ''dada Manifesto.'', Paris, France]&lt;/ref&gt;
 Dada means nothing...   Thought is produced in the mouth.&lt;ref&gt;Londré, p.396, 397; Richter, p.35&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The [[etymology]] of the term anti-genre borrows its [[semantic]] form from the terms [[wikt:anti-|anti-]] meaning ''against'' and ''genre'', (French "kind," related to the English "gender")

==Examples in Music==

The best example of the anti-genre in music is [[John Cage]]'s 1952 composition [[4′33″]], in which the entire performance consists of four and a half minutes of utter silence.  The musicians are instructed not to play their instruments.  All the audience can hear is the sound of themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Cage, John (1961) ''Silence: Lectures and Writings'', Wesleyan University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

In this famous and controversial piece, John Cage presents silence as the [[antithesis]] of music.  Thus, the absence of all audible content becomes music's anti-genre.  There are, however other examples.

If [[music]] is the artistic arrangement of sound, then the non-artistic arrangement of sound might be a suitable candidate for musical-negation.  Non-music becomes noise, rather than artful melody and rhythm.  Examples of [[noise music]] range from guitar-based feedback recordings and live performances ([[The Melvins]], [[Nine Inch Nails]], [[Jimi Hendrix]]) to the screeching sounds of [[Screamo]], [[Grindcore]], [[industrial music]] or contemporary dance electronic styles like [[Gabber]], Terrorcore, [[Breakcore]], [[Glitch (music)|Glitch]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;See Wikipedia - [[List of hardcore genres]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, the entire ethos of the [[Punk subculture]] was based on nihilism, which by its very nature seeks category annihilation.

==Examples in Literature==
[[File:Nietzsche.jpg|thumb|left|[[Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche]].]]
The anti-genre, in literature, comes into being in particular during the mid to late 19th century.  Both [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]]'s 1864 novel [[Notes from Underground]], with his introduction of the anti-hero (referred to as the Underground Man) as well as [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s [[The Antichrist (book)|The Antichrist]] published in 1895, represent early works in the tradition.

For Dostoyevsky's underground man, all the virtues of the traditional protagonist (the hero) are turned upside down.  Rather than courageous he is weak and complains of both physical pain as well as deeper (more existential) angst.  Rather than altruism and chivalry he feels vengeance and spite towards others.  Dostoyevsky's underground man introduces to western literature the [[archetype]] of the [[anti-hero]].  His early work also attacks the [[positivists]] of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] era, thereby strengthening the case against [[utopian]] optimism.  The introduction of the anti-hero combined with his [[dystopian]] proposal, represent more of a soft anti-genre status rather than the more technical definition of the term.

For Nietzsche, the task of overcoming history required a grand declaration of war.&lt;ref&gt;Tanner, Michael.  Introduction to, ''Twilight of the Idols/The Anti-Christ''.  London: Penguin Books, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;  His enemies were many:    In the last sane year of his life he was able to complete two final texts, [[Twilight of the Idols]] and [[The Anti-Christ]].

More technical examples of the anti-genre in literature might include [[meta-fiction]] or [[aleatoricism]], but there is lack of contemporary scholarship on the topic to resolve this matter definitively.

==Paradox of the Anti-Genre==
Is the anti-genre itself a genre?

This poses a problem.  For, if it is a genre, then it does not exist but if it is not a genre then no discussion of it as a coherent entity can take place.  The anti-genre therefore suffers from an identity crisis.  Of course, nothing would make the anti-genre more happy than to deny its own existence.

By referencing a negation of itself in its own definition, ''anti-genre'' achieves a contradictory truth status (both true and false at the same time).  This happens any time that the definition of the word in question (or interpretation of the sentence in question) is a denial of its own meaning.  For example,

           The statement in this box is false.

When it is true (that it is false) it becomes a negation of itself.  It cannot be both true and false at the same time.  The anti-genre suffers from this same type of self-annihilation.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

But, although this might pose a problem for a symbolic logician or software engineer, it poses no problem for the anti-artist.  The goal of the artist working in their respective anti-genre is to evade genre-classification.  Thus, the inability of their category to hold down a definition becomes an asset rather than a liability.

==Examples in Computer Science==
The most technical description of the paradox of the anti-genre can be found in computer science.  In computer programming an [[infinite loop]] is often an un-intended result ([[software bug|bug]]) of circular self-reference in the program code.

For example, the Dada artist's eternal maxim declares,&lt;blockquote&gt;
Dada had only one rule: Never follow any rules.&lt;ref&gt;http://arthistory.about.com/cs/arthistory10one/a/dada.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

If we (hypothetically) run this maxim through a [[recursion (computer science)|recursive]] computer algorithm, it would cause program error.  For, if Dada does not obey this rule then Dada would be free to follow any rules (a direct refutation of this maxim), but if it obeys this maxim then there is at least one rule which it is following (a contradiction).  In the language of computer programming this is fatal (it prevents an exit condition from being met) but for the artist this might be the ultimate goal of his/her art.

==Hard versus Soft==
The technical definition of anti-genre (hard version) is not merely art that insults its predecessors.  The hard version is more active in its flight from meaning.  It is self-consciously involved in the process of not just breaking with tradition but undoing the entire framework that distinguishes the different genre categories in that medium.   Silence in place of music and the blank canvas in place of paint, are two obvious examples of this.

The soft version however, is a little harder to nail down.  The definition of a soft anti-genre might include art intentionally dispensing with conventions of its medium or violently breaking with tradition by [[subversion]], vandalism-art, irrationality, self-defeat or other strategies in a rebellious spirit.

The problem with this lighter version of anti-genre is that all artistic movements by definition represent a decisive break with the traditions that came before them.  If not, then they would merely be continuous with their predecessors.  This is known as the process of [[dialectic]]. First, a thesis is proposed.  Then the thesis is rejected by the [[anti-thesis]].  This rejection is eventually accepted by the community and a synthesis of thesis and anti-thesis come together to create the new proposal ready for rejection.  And so the cycle continues.

It is important to emphasize the hard and soft distinction however because there is a tendency in postmodernity to associate negative/rebellious attitudes in artistic movements with formal categories like anti-genre, despite the fact that the anti-genre, in its hard version, has a much more technical definition.

==The End of History==
What is the logical conclusion of an artistic movement that is essentially suicidal? (see [[Anti-genre#Paradox of the Anti-Genre|Paradox of the Anti-genre]] section)

After annihilating everything in their path, every artistic style and movement that had come before them, every political attitude and social value, the DaDa artist eventually had nothing left to consume and so retired to a life of seclusion and chess.

Likewise, and for all of his proselytizing (calling for a complete transvaluation of all human values), Nietzsche ended his life deep inside a state of mental illness.
And so it is not uncommon to hear writers lament that the only cure for history is a good psychiatrist and a lot of prescription medicine.

'''''Arons saga Hjörleifssonar''''' (standardised Old Norse spelling: ''Arons saga Hjǫrleifssonar'') recounts the life of Aron Hjörleifsson (c. 1200–55), an important contemporary of [[Sturla Sighvatsson]] and Bishop [[Guðmundr Arason]]. The saga has been dated to around 1340, though it survives first in a fifteenth-century vellum fragment (AM 551d beta 4to), with the earliest complete texts being the paper manuscripts AM 212 fol., AM 426 fol., and AM 399 4to (known as the Codex Resenianus).&lt;ref&gt;Joanna A. Skórzewska, ''Constructing a Cult: The Life and Veneration of Guðmundr Arason (1161–1237) in the Icelandic Written Sources'', The Northern World, 51 (Leiden: Brill, 2011), p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

The saga portrays Aron as a supporter of Bishop Guðmundr, and as in turn receiving the benefits of Guðmundr's numinous assistance. It seems to have been written in the wake of the attempts to have Guðmundr canonised around 1320. It claims that Aron was one of the most famous warriors of his time, becoming an outlaw at the hands of Sturla Sighvatsson, travelling as a pilgrim to Jerusalem, and ending his life at the court of [[Haakon IV of Norway]].&lt;ref&gt;Joanna A. Skórzewska, ''Constructing a Cult: The Life and Veneration of Guðmundr Arason (1161–1237) in the Icelandic Written Sources'', The Northern World, 51 (Leiden: Brill, 2011), p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Arons saga'' is not part of the compilation of sagas about Aron's time known as ''[[Sturlunga saga]]'', but stands alongside ''Sturlunga saga'' as an important depiction of events at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Joanna A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2912">'''ArtStars*''' is a YouTube show hosted by Nadja Sayej that focuses on comedic conversations in the art world. It was founded in 2009 in Toronto with video artist Jeremy Bailey and video editor Ryan Edwards. The show has been called "a gonzo skewering of sanctified art pretense".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/2010/01/31/young_artists_thriving_with_online_talk_shows.html|title=Young artists thriving with online talk shows|work=The Star|access-date=2018-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As one of the first vlogs in the [[art world]], the episodes have been described as [[Gonzo journalism|gonzo]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://temporaryartreview.com/living-in-a-red-dot-hell-nadja-sayej-aka-snowe-white-and-art-criticism-on-your-ipod/|title=Living in a Red Dot Hell: Nadja Sayej aka Snowe White and Art Criticism on Your iPod|website=Temporary Art Review|access-date=2018-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and satirical&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.artinamericamagazine.com/news-features/news/artstars/|title=Center Stage in Toronto|work=Art in America|access-date=2018-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; for crashing gallery openings&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://this.org/2010/04/19/nadja-sayej-krzysztof-pospieszynski-artstars/|title=THIS  →  Listen to This #010: Nadja Sayej and Krzysztof Pospieszynski of ArtStars*|website=this.org|access-date=2018-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and interviewing "art stars, their groupies and the people who go to galleries just for the booze".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dirty-mag.com/v2/?p=4478|title=NADJA SAYEJ: VIDEO BLOG QUEEN TAKING THE ART WORLD BY AMBUSH|website=Dirty Magazine|access-date=2018-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The interview style and commentary in the show "punctures pretension, deflate egos and delight lovers of lively criticism".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.artslant.com/ny/articles/show/28158-binterview-with-nadja-sayej-of-artstarsb|title=Interview with Nadja Sayej of ArtStars*|website=ArtSlant|access-date=2018-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It follows the tradition of reporting on the art scene, similar to the [[GalleryBeat TV]] cable access TV show in New York City in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/15/arts/design/15kino.html|title=Paul H-O, Gallery Gadfly, Revives His Act|last=Kino|first=Carol|date=2009-11-11|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-05-21|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show has been noted for making the art world more accessible.

Episodes include interviews with noteworthy artists [[John Waters]], [[Ai Weiwei]], [[Robert Crumb]], [[Marina Abramović]], [[Peaches (musician)|Peaches]], and [[Julian Schnabel]].

'''The Art Institute of Pittsburgh''' ('''AIP''') is a nonprofit educational institution owned and operated by Dream Center Education Holdings (DCEH), LLC.&lt;ref name="artinstitutes.edu" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.post-gazette.com/business/career-workplace/2017/10/18/EDMC-completes-sale-of-schools-to-Dream-Center-Art-Institute/stories/201710180113 |title=EDMC completes sale of schools to Dream Center |author= |date= |website=post-gazette.com |accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is located in [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]], and emphasizes [[design education]] and career preparation for the [[Creative industries|creative job market]]. It was founded in 1921.

According to the National Center for Education Statistics, the Art Institute of Pittsburgh has a 32% graduation rate and a 20% [[student loan default]] rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nces.ed.gov/collegenavigator/?q=art+institute&amp;s=PA&amp;id=210960 |title=College Navigator – The Art Institute of Pittsburgh |author= |date= |website=nces.ed.gov |accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Founded in 1921, the school began as a profit-based independent school of art and illustration, producing a number of notable [[artist]]s including [[watercolorist]] [[Frank Webb (watercolorist)|Frank Webb]], animation producer and director [[Rick Schneider-Calabash]], and the late science fiction illustrator [[Frank Kelly Freas]].  The Institute now specializes primarily in [[design]] disciplines and [[culinary arts]]. In 1968, [[Education Management Corporation]] (EDMC) acquired The Art Institute of Pittsburgh, and created additional schools the [[The Art Institutes|Art Institute]] system.

In 2008, it briefly became one of the largest arts colleges in the United States (factoring online enrollment). However, in 2010 enrollment began to drop, in part due to the falsification of records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Van Osdul |first1=Paul |title=Whistle-blower accuses EDMC of falsifying records to get taxpayer money |url=http://www.wtae.com/investigations/Whistle-blower-accuses-EDMC-of-falsifying-records-to-get-taxpayer-money/18535232#!boUCmz |website=[[WTAE-TV|wtae.com]] |accessdate=28 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whistleblowers within the company sued the Institute due to practices at the online division,  and were later joined by the United States Department of Justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hechinger |first=John |title=U.S. Joins Whistleblower Suit Against Education Management |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-05-02/u-s-joins-whistleblower-suit-against-education-management.html |publisher=Bloomberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Since the 2009 public offering of EDMC, and the subsequent majority position by Goldman Sachs, emphasis throughout the EDMC system shifted increasingly toward shareholder profits with cost-cutting measures&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Deitch |first=Charlie |title=EDMC layoffs hit Art Institutes nationwide |url=http://www.pghcitypaper.com/Blogh/archives/2012/08/23/edmc-layoffs-hit-art-institutes-nationwide |publisher=[[Pittsburgh City Paper]] |accessdate=26 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in larger classes, fewer student services, and a standardized curriculum throughout the system.  This standardization removed the need for resident experts and curriculum developers at the individual colleges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Halperin |first=David |title=EDMC Professors and Students Speak: How Lobbyists &amp; Goldman Sachs Ruined For-Profit Education |url=http://www.republicreport.org/2012/edmc-lobbyists-goldman-sachs-ruined-for-profit-education/ |publisher=Republic Report |accessdate=26 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Enrollment in the online division and EDMC's other online programs ballooned from 7,900 in 2007 to 42,300 in 2012, due in large part to practices that devoted more per-student expenditures to marketing ($4,158) than on education ($3,460).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Deitch |first1=Charlie |title=EDMC reports revenues, enrollment down on heels of more layoffs |url=http://www.pghcitypaper.com/SlagHeap/archives/2012/08/09/edmc-reports-revenues-enrollment-down-on-heels-of-more-layoffs |website=pghcitypaper.com |accessdate=27 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, however, dramatic drops in enrollment have led to massive layoffs in the online division.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Deitch |first1=Charlie |title=EDMC insiders report layoffs underway |url=http://www.pghcitypaper.com/SlagHeap/archives/2012/01/26/edmc-insiders-report-layoffs-underway |website=pghcitypaper.com |accessdate=27 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, [[PayScale|Payscale.com]] found that the institute provided the worst return on tuition of all institutes of higher learning surveyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/susanadams/2013/08/09/the-25-colleges-with-the-worst-return-on-investment/ |title=The 25 Colleges With The Worst Return On Investment |first=Susan |last=Adams |date= |website=forbes.com |accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to disclosures the college is required to provide to the Department of Education, the overall graduation rates fell to 39% in 2012, while graduation rates among [[Pell grant]] recipients were still lower at 27%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Graduation/completion rates – The Art Institute of Pittsburgh |url=http://www.artinstitutes.edu/pdf/student-consumer-information/graduation-rate-pittsburgh.pdf65397613,d.cWc&amp;cad=rja |publisher=The Art Institute of Pittsburgh |accessdate=26 April 2014}}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The graduation rate fell substantially further in 2014 from 39% to 24%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Graduation Rates: The Art Institute of Pittsburgh |url=https://content.edmc.edu/assets/pdf/AI/Student-Consumer-Information/Graduation-Rates/graduation-rate-pittsburgh.pdf |website=www.artinstitutes.edu |publisher=EDMC Corporation |accessdate=6 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; New owners took control of EDMC in 2015, as EDMC entered into a debt-for-equity swap with its current owners, giving up the majority of their stock to creditors with whom they broke loan covenants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Allen |first1=Lisa |title=Education Management Cuts Deal to Trim Over $1B in Debt |url=http://www.thestreet.com/story/12859801/1/education-management-cuts-deal-to-trim-over-1b-in-debt.html?puc=yahoo&amp;cm_ven=YAHOO |website=The Street |accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Location ==
On March 27, 2017, The Art Institute of Pittsburgh moved to 1400 Penn Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA 15222.  During its growth phase it relocated several times, expanding and broadening the curriculum, but then later reduced offerings during its contraction period. The school purchased a [[historic landmark]] building at 420 [[Boulevard of the Allies]] in 2000, but sold the same to a Chicago developer in 2014. The Art Institute then moved to a more industrial building in the [[Strip District, Pittsburgh|Strip District]] of Pittsburgh, or "the Strip."

'''Artel of Artists''' ({{Lang-ru|«Арте́ль худо́жников»}}) was a [[cooperative]] association (''[[artel]]'') and a [[commune (intentional community)|commune]] of democratically-minded artists headed by [[Ivan Kramskoi]]. It was established in 1863 after some of its future organisers had been expelled from the [[Imperial Academy of Arts|St.&amp;nbsp;Petersburg Academy of Arts]] because of the "revolt of fourteen".  In rebellion against the Academy's annual competition, the students refused to paint an exam picture on the given topic.

A number of members of the Artel later became ''[[Peredvizhniki|Peredvizhniks]]''.

'''''Beowulf: A Translation and Commentary''''' is a prose translation of the early medieval epic poem ''[[Beowulf]]'' from [[Old English]] to modern English language. Translated by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] from 1920 to 1926, it was edited by Tolkien's son [[Christopher Tolkien|Christopher]] and published posthumously in May 2014 by [[HarperCollins]].

In the poem, [[Beowulf (hero)|Beowulf]], a hero of the [[Geats]] in Scandinavia, comes to the aid of [[Hroðgar]], the king of the [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]], whose [[mead hall]] [[Heorot]] has been under attack by a monster known as [[Grendel]].  After Beowulf slays him, [[Grendel's mother]] attacks the hall and is then also defeated. Victorious, Beowulf goes home to [[Geatland]] in Sweden and later becomes king of the Geats. After fifty years have passed, Beowulf defeats a [[dragon]], but is fatally wounded in the battle. After his death, his attendants bury him in a [[tumulus]], a burial mound, in Geatland.

The translation is followed by a commentary on the poem that became the base for Tolkien's acclaimed 1936 lecture "[[Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics|''Beowulf'': The Monsters and the Critics]]".&lt;ref name="BBC 2014-03-20"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-26662761 |title=JRR Tolkien's Beowulf translation to be published |work=[[BBC News]] |date=20 March 2014 |accessdate=8 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the book includes the previously unpublished "[[Sellic Spell]]" and two versions of "The Lay of ''Beowulf''". The former is a fantasy piece on Beowulf's biographical background while the latter is a poem on the ''Beowulf'' theme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-544-44278-8 |title=Beowulf: A Translation and Commentary  |work=[[Publishers Weekly]] |date=26 May 2014 |accessdate=8 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
{{main article|Beowulf}}

Beowulf, a prince of the Geats, and his followers set out to help king Hroðgar of the Danes in his fight against the monster Grendel. Because Grendel hates music and noise he frequently attacks Hroðgar's mead hall [[Heorot]] killing the king's men in their sleep. While Beowulf cannot kill Grendel directly in their first encounter, he still wounds him fatally. Afterwards he has to face Grendel's mother who has come to avenge her son. Beowulf follows her to a cavern beneath a lake where he slays her with a magical sword. There he also finds the dying Grendel and decapitates him.

Beowulf returns home to become king of the Geats. After some 50 years, a dragon whose treasure had been stolen from his hoard in a burial mound begins to terrorize Geatland. Beowulf, now in his eighties, tries to fight the dragon but cannot succeed. He follows the dragon to his lair where Beowulf's young relative [[Wiglaf]] joins him in the fight. Eventually, Beowulf slays the dragon but is mortally wounded. In the end, his followers bury their king in a mound by the sea.

==Reception==
Tolkien's translation of ''Beowulf'' has been compared to [[Seamus Heaney]]'s translation from 2000. [[Joan Acocella]] writes that since Tolkien was not a professional poet like Heaney, he had to make compromises in translating the original Old English epic. According to Acocella, Heaney's focus on rhyme and [[alliteration]] makes him occasionally lose details from the original that remain in Tolkien's prose version.&lt;ref name=Acocella&gt;{{cite journal|title=Slaying Monsters: Tolkien's 'Beowulf' |url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2014/06/02/140602crbo_books_acocella?currentPage=all|first=Joan |last=Acocella |authorlink=Joan Acocella |work=[[The New Yorker]] |date=2 June 2014 |accessdate=8 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tolkien's version stays closer to the details and rhythm of the original and also very close to the original sense of the poem, which has been attributed to Tolkien's scholarly knowledge of Old English, whereas Heaney, on the other hand, succeeded in producing a translation suited for the modern reader, more so than Tolkien's.&lt;ref name=Acocella/&gt;&lt;ref name=Worall&gt;{{cite news|title=Tolkien's Beowulf: a 'great gift' |first=Patrick |last=Worrall |work=[[Channel 4]] |date=22 May 2014 |accessdate=8 June 2014 |url=http://www.channel4.com/news/tolkiens-beowulf-a-great-gift}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The publication also caused some controversy among scholars. ''Beowulf'' expert and University of Kentucky professor [[Kevin Kiernan]], called it a "travesty", and criticism was also offered by [[Harvard University|Harvard]] professor Daniel Donoghue.&lt;ref name="hwaet"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/londoners-diary/hwt-a-new-academic-spat-over-tolkien-9409559.html|title=Hwæt? a new academic spat over Tolkien|date=21 May 2014|work=[[London Evening Standard]]|accessdate=8 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for ''[[Business Insider]]'', Kiernan cites J. R. R. Tolkien himself who disliked his own translation. According to Kiernan, any prose translation of Beowulf will neglect the "poetic majesty" of the original.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why Tolkien Hated His Translation Of Beowulf |first=Kevin |last=Kiernan |authorlink=Kevin Kiernan |work=[[Business Insider]] |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/beowulf-is-so-hard-to-translate-even-jrr-tolkien-hated-his-version-2014-6 |date=2 June 2014 |accessdate=8 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[University of Birmingham]] lecturer Philippa Semper instead called the translation "captivating" and "a great gift to anyone interested in Beowulf or Tolkien."&lt;ref name=Worall/&gt;

Writing in the ''[[New York Times]]'', [[Ethan Gilsdorf]] comments that Tolkien had been skeptical about putting ''Beowulf'' into modern English, and had written in his 1940 essay ''[[On Translating Beowulf]]'' that turning the poem "into 'plain prose' could be an 'abuse'."&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gilsdorf|first1=Ethan|authorlink=Ethan Gilsdorf|title=Waving His Wand at ‘Beowulf’|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/19/books/jrr-tolkiens-translation-of-beowulf-is-published.html?_r=1|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=2 December 2014|date=18 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gilsdorf continues, "But he did it anyway"; Tolkien remarking that the result "was 'hardly to my liking'."&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

==Background and legacy==
J. R. R. Tolkien specialized in English [[philology]] at university and in 1915 graduated with [[Old Norse]] as special subject. In 1920, he became Reader in English Language at the [[University of Leeds]], where he claimed credit for raising the number of students of [[linguistics]] from five to twenty. He gave courses in Old English [[heroic verse]], [[history of English]], various [[Old English]] and [[Middle English]] texts, Old and Middle English philology, introductory [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] philology, [[Gothic language|Gothic]], [[Old Icelandic]], and [[Middle Welsh language|Medieval Welsh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carpenter|1981|loc=letter No. 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having read ''Beowulf'' earlier, he began a translation of the poem which he finished in 1926 but never published. Acocella writes that Tolkien may not have had the time to pursue a publication when he moved to [[Oxford]] and began to write his novel ''[[The Hobbit]]''. Tolkien's biographer [[Humphrey Carpenter]] argues also that Tolkien was too much of a perfectionist to publish his translation.&lt;ref name=Acocella/&gt;

Ten years later, however, Tolkien drew upon this work when he gave a lecture "[[Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics|''Beowulf'': The Monster and the Critics]]". According to this lecture, the true theme of ''Beowulf'', namely death and defeat, was being neglected in favour of archaeological and philological disputes on how much of the poem was fictive or true.&lt;ref name=Acocella/&gt;

===Influences on ''The Hobbit''===
Tolkien described ''Beowulf'' as one of the "most valued sources" for ''[[The Hobbit]]''.&lt;ref name=Letter25&gt;{{harvnb|Carpenter|1981|loc=letter No. 25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain descriptions in ''The Hobbit'' seem to have been lifted straight out of ''Beowulf'' with some minor rewording, such as when each dragon stretches out its neck to sniff for intruders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Faraci | first=Mary | editor-first=Jane | editor-last=Chance | title=Tolkien the Medievalist | publisher=Routledge |year=2002 | pages=58–59 | chapter='I wish to speak' (Tolkien's voice in his Beowulf essay) | isbn=0-415-28944-0 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=sNTI0WTNmw4C}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, Tolkien's descriptions of the lair as accessed through a secret passage mirror those in ''Beowulf''. Other specific plot elements and features in ''The Hobbit'' that show similarities to ''Beowulf'' include the title ''thief'' as [[Bilbo Baggins]] is called by [[Gollum]] and later also by Smaug, and Smaug's personality which leads to the destruction of Lake-town.&lt;ref&gt;{{ME-ref|Solopova|p. 37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tolkien refines parts of ''Beowulf''{{'s}} plot that he appears to have found less than satisfactorily described, such as details about the cup-thief and the dragon's intellect and personality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Purtill | first=Richard L. |authorlink=Richard Purtill | title=Lord of the Elves and Eldils | publisher=Ignatius Press |year=2006 |pages=53–55 | isbn=1-58617-084-8 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=cbcuwO3bwfgC}}&lt;/ref&gt; By his naming his sword "[[Sting (Middle-earth)|Sting]]" one can see Bilbo's acceptance of the kinds of cultural and linguistic practices found in ''Beowulf'', signifying his entrance into the ancient world in which he found himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = McDonald | first = R. Andrew | first2 = K. S. | last2 = Whetter | year = 2006 | title = 'In the hilt is fame': resonances of medieval swords and sword-lore in J. R. R.

As Tolkien wrote, "The episode of the theft arose naturally (and almost inevitably) from the circumstances. It is difficult to think of any other way of conducting the story at this point. I fancy the author of ''Beowulf'' would say much the same."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carpenter|1981|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Creative Technology Ltd.''' is a Singapore-based global company headquartered in [[Jurong East]], [[Singapore]]. The principal activities of the company and its subsidiaries consist of the design, manufacture and distribution of digitized sound and video boards, computers and related multimedia, and personal digital entertainment products.

It also partners with mainboard manufacturers and laptop brands to embed its Sound Blaster technology on their products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.creative.com/oem/partner/pt_sc.asp|title=Creative OEM Partners|author=(C) Creative Labs 1999-2015|publisher=|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{Overly detailed|date=October 2015|section=yes}}
The firm began as a computer repair shop, where [[Sim Wong Hoo]] developed an add-on memory board for the [[Apple II family|Apple II]] computer. Later, they started creating customized PCs adapted in [[Chinese language|Chinese]]. A part of this design included enhanced audio capabilities, so that the device could produce speech and melodies. The success of this audio interface led to the development of a standalone [[sound card]].

In 1987, they released a 12-voice sound generator sound card for the [[IBM Personal Computer|IBM PC]] architecture, the Creative Music System (C/MS), featuring two [[Philips SAA1099]] chips. Sim personally went from Singapore to [[Silicon Valley]] and managed to get [[RadioShack]]'s [[Tandy Corporation|Tandy]] division to market the product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/technology/2004-06-28-sim_x.htm|title=Creative's name describes CEO|publisher=USA Today|date=2004-06-28|accessdate=2008-03-31|last=Graham|first=Jefferson}}&lt;/ref&gt; The card was, however, unsuccessful and lost to [[AdLib]]. Learning from this, Creative produced the first [[Sound Blaster]], which included the prior CM/S hardware but also incorporated the [[Yamaha YM3812]] chip (also known as OPL2) that was found on the AdLib card, as well as adding a component for playing and recording digital samples. The firm used aggressive marketing strategies, from calling the card a "stereo" component (only the C/MS chips were capable of stereo, not the complete product) to calling the sound producing micro-controller a "DSP" (for "digital sound processor"), hoping to associate the product with a [[digital signal processor]] (the DSP could encode/decode ADPCM realtime, but otherwise had no other DSP-like qualities).

The firm's [[Sound Blaster]] [[sound card]] was among the first dedicated audio processing cards to be made widely available to the general consumer. The card soon became a [[de facto]] standard for sound cards in PCs for many years, mostly by the fact that it was the first to bundle what is now considered to be a part of a sound card system: digital audio, on-board music synthesizer, MIDI interface and a joystick port. This continued until the 2000s when OEM PCs began to be built with sound boards integrated directly onto the motherboard, and the Sound Blaster found itself reduced to a niche product.

Monaural Sound Blaster cards were introduced in 1989, and stereo cards followed in 1992 (Sound Blaster Pro). Wavetable MIDI was added with the 16-bit [[Sound Blaster AWE32]] and [[Sound Blaster AWE64|AWE64]] with 32 and 64 voices.

Ed Esber, former CEO of Ashton Tate, joined Creative Technologies America's subsidiary Creative Labs as CEO in 1993. Esber reported to the company's founder and CEO Sim Wong Hoo, and was brought in to help professionalize the management of the company following its [[Initial Public Offering]] and ongoing rapid growth. At the time of Esber's hire, Creative's global revenues were approximately US$50 million.

Esber brought in a team of US executives, including Rich Buchanan (graphics), Gail Pomerantz (marketing), and Rich Sorkin (sound products, and later communications, OEM and business development).&lt;ref&gt;http://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/text/Oral_History/Esber_Edward/Esber_Edward.oral_history.2004.102657944.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This group played key roles in reversing a brutal market share decline caused by intense competition from Mediavision at the high end and Aztech at the low end. Sorkin, in particular, dramatically strengthened the company's brand position through crisp licensing and an aggressive defense of Creative's intellectual property positions while working to shorten product development cycles.

As a result, by 1996, Creative's revenues reached their highest level ever, US$1.6 billion and Creative was well positioned to take advantage of the internet era, with pioneering investments in [[VOIP]] and media streaming.

At the same time, Esber and the original founders of the company had differences of opinion on the strategy and positioning of the company. Esber exited in 1995, followed quickly by Buchanan, who subsequently led several important graphics and media hardware platform companies, and Pomerantz. Sorkin was continuously promoted following Esber's departure, ultimately to General Manager of Audio and Communications Products and Executive Vice-President of Business Development and Corporate Investments. However, Sorkin eventually left as well, in 1996, to run internet pioneer [[Zip2]], founded by [[Elon Musk]] and later acquired by [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]].

After peaking in 1996, Creative Technology revenues subsequently declined substantially following the departure of the American leadership team and unsuccessful ventures into the CD-ROM market. The firm was forced to write off nearly US$100 million in inventory when the market collapsed due to a flood of cheaper alternatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/ASIANOW/asiaweek/technology/2000/0929/acom.cover.html|title=Asiaweek.com - Technology - Creative's Genius - 9/29/2000|publisher=|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The firm had maintained a strong foothold in the [[Extended Industry Standard Architecture|EISA]] PC audio market until July 14, 1997 when [[Aureal Semiconductor]] entered the soundcard market with their very competitive [[Peripheral Component Interconnect|PCI]] AU8820 Vortex 3D sound technology. The firm at the time was in development of their own in house PCI audio cards but were finding little success adopting to the PCI standard. In January 1998 in order to quickly facilitate a working PCI audio technology, the firm made the acquisition of [[Ensoniq]] for US$77 million. On March 5, 1998 the firm sued Aureal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aureal.com/cgi-bin/pub/display.pl?template=press_aur_detail.htm&amp;serial=76|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19990829025202/http://www.aureal.com/cgi-bin/pub/display.pl?template=press_aur_detail.htm&amp;serial=76|dead-url=yes|archive-date=29 August 1999|title=Internet Archive Wayback Machine|date=29 August 1999|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; with patent infringement claims over a MIDI caching technology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dspwiki.com/index.php?title=Creative_Labs_v._Aureal|title=Creative Labs v.

Aureal filed a counterclaim&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/1999/04/01/writs_fly_as_aureal_countersues/|title=Writs fly as Aureal countersues Creative Technologies|publisher=|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; stating the firm was intentionally interfering with its business prospects, had defamed them, commercially disparaged, engaged in [[unfair competition]] with intent to slow down Aureals sales and acted fraudulently. The suit had come only days after Aureal gained a fair market with the AU8820 Vortex1.

In August 1998 the [[Sound Blaster Live!]] was the firm's first sound card developed for the [[Peripheral Component Interconnect|PCI]] bus in order to compete with upcoming Aureal AU8830 Vortex2 sound chip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Aureal+Welcomes+Creative+Labs+to+Competitive+Marketplace.-a053377442|title=Aureal Welcomes Creative Labs to Competitive Marketplace.|publisher=|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aureal at this time were making fliers comparing their new AU8830 chips to the now shipping [[Sound Blaster Live!]]. The specifications within these fliers comparing the AU8830 to the [[Sound Blaster Live!]] EMU10K1 chip sparked another flurry of lawsuits against Aureal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Creative+Files+False+Advertising+and+Other+Claims+Against+Aureal.-a053046886|title=Creative Files False Advertising and Other Claims Against Aureal.|publisher=|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; this time claiming Aureal had falsely advertised the [[Sound Blaster Live!]]'s capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/207084396/A3D30prm|title=A3D30prm|publisher=|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1999 after numerous lawsuits, Aureal won a favorable ruling but went bankrupt as a result of legal costs and their investors pulling out. Their assets were acquired by Creative through the [[bankruptcy court]] in September 2000 for US$32 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alive.singnet.com.sg/features/aureal-creative.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010054918/http://alive.singnet.com.sg/features/aureal-creative.htm|title=ALive!|archivedate=10 October 2007|publisher=|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The firm had in effect removed their only major direct competitor in the 3D gaming audio market, excluding their later acquisition of [[Sensaura]].

In April 1999, the firm launched the [[Creative NOMAD|NOMAD]] line of [[digital audio player]]s that would later introduce the [[Creative MuVo|MuVo]] and [[Creative ZEN|ZEN]] series of [[portable media player]]s. In November 2004, the firm announced a $100 million marketing campaign to promote their digital audio products, including the [[Creative Zen|ZEN]] range of MP3 players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith |first=Tony |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/11/18/creative_vs_apple/ |title=The Register "Creative declares war on iPod", 18 November 2004 |publisher=Theregister.co.uk |date=2004-11-18 |accessdate=2010-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The firm applied for {{US patent|6928433}} on January 5, 2001 and was awarded the patent on August 9, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.creative.com/corporate/pressroom/?id=12175|title=Press Relations|publisher=|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ZEN Patent was awarded to the firm for the invention of user interface for portable media players. This opened the way for potential legal action against Apple's iPod and the other competing players.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} The firm took legal actions against Apple in May 2006. In August, 2006, Creative and Apple entered into a broad settlement,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.creative.com/corporate/pressroom/?id=12585|title=Press Relations|publisher=|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Apple paying Creative $100 million for the license to use the Zen patent. The firm then joined the "Made for iPod" program.

On March 22, 2005, ''[[The Inquirer]]'' reported that Creative Labs had agreed to settle in a [[class action lawsuit]] about the way its [[Audigy]] and Extigy soundcards were marketed. The firm offered customers who purchased the cards up to a $62.50 reduction on the cost of their next purchase of its products, while the lawyers involved in filing the dispute against Creative received a payment of approximately $470,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Simon|last=Burns|title=Creative Labs owes you $62|date=2005-03-22|publisher=The Inquirer|url=http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/1024547/creative-labs-owes-usd62|accessdate=2010-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Creative voluntarily delisted itself from [[NASDAQ]], where it had the symbol of CREAF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://creative.com/corporate/pressroom/releases/welcome.asp?pid=12796|title=Creative Technology Announces Completion of Its Voluntary Delisting from Nasdaq - Company's Sole Exchange Listing Now On the SGX-ST|date=2007-09-04|accessdate=2008-01-01|publisher=Creative|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204214306/http://www.creative.com/corporate/pressroom/releases/welcome.asp?pid=12796|archivedate=2008-12-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its stocks are now solely on the [[Singapore Exchange]] (SGX-ST).

In early 2008, Creative Labs' technical support center, located in Stillwater, Oklahoma, laid off several technical support staff, furthering ongoing concerns surrounding Creative's financial situation. Later that year, the company faced a public-relations backlash when it demanded that a user named "Daniel_K" cease distributing modified versions of drivers for Windows Vista which restored functionality that had been available in drivers for Windows XP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Joel|last=Hruska|title=Creative irate after modder spruces up Vista X-Fi drivers|date=2008-03-31|publisher=Ars Technica|url=https://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20080331-creative-irate-after-modder-spruces-up-vista-x-fi-drivers.html|accessdate =2018-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In January 2009, the firm generated internet buzz with a mysterious website&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zii.com|title=Zii|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115202044/http://www.zii.com/|archivedate=2009-01-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; promising a "stem cell-like" processor which would give a 100-fold increase in supercomputing power over current technology, as well as advances in consumer 3D graphics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2008/12/26/creatives-zii-stemcell-computing-is-not-likely-to-be-awesome |title=Creative's Zii "Stemcell Computing" is not likely to be awesome |publisher=Engadget.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Consumer Electronics Show|CES]] 2009, it was revealed to be the ZMS-05 processor from [[ZiiLABS]], a subsidiary formed from the combining of [[3DLabs]] and Creative's Personal Digital Entertainment division.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2009/01/08/creative-unveils-zii |title=Creative unveils Zii |publisher=Engadget.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2012, the firm announced it has entered into an agreement with [[Intel Corporation]] for Intel to license technology and patents from ZiiLABS Inc. Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of Creative, and acquire engineering resources and assets related to its UK branch as a part of a $50 million deal. [[ZiiLABS]] (still wholly owned by Creative) continues to retain all ownership of its StemCell media processor technologies and patents, and will continue to supply and support its ZMS series of chips to its customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.creative.com/corporate/pressroom/releases/welcome.asp?pid=13300 |title=Creative to license technology and patents to Intel as part of a us$50 million deal |publisher=Creative Technology Ltd |date= |accessdate=2012-11-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121129222355/http://www.creative.com/corporate/pressroom/releases/welcome.asp?pid=13300 |archivedate=2012-11-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sound Blaster===
{{main|Sound Blaster}}
[[File:Sound Blaster Omni Surround 5.1.jpg|thumb|Sound Blaster Omni Surround 5.1]]
Creative Sound Blaster is one of the most recognized names in the PC audio market. In 1987, the ''Creative Music System'' was released as the first audio device from the firm. In 1988, the firm took the Creative Music System and marketed it at [[RadioShack]] as ''Game Blaster''. The Sound Blaster 1.0 released within the following year assisted by full compatibility with the then market leader [[Ad Lib, Inc.]]'s sound card, allowed the firm to achieve competitive control of the PC audio market by 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcper.com/category/tags/ad-lib|title=Another Video About the Early Days of PC Audio}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ad Lib, Inc. went bankrupt in 1992. Creative Techologies' audio revenue grew from US$40 million per year to nearly $1 billion following the launch of the Sound Blaster 16 and related products during the mid-1990s. Rich Sorkin was General Manager of the global business during this time, responsible for product planning, product management, marketing and OEM sales.

The current{{when|date=October 2015}} line-up of Sound Blaster sound cards includes a feature SBX Pro Studio that restores the highs and lows of compressed audio files, enhancing the detail and clarity. SBX Pro Studio also contains settings that allow the user to improve their audio bass and virtual surround.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.creative.com/audiomadeclever/what-is-sbx-pro-studio|title=Audio Made Clever :: What is SBX Pro Studio?|work=Audio Made Clever|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Creative X-Fi Sonic Carrier ===

The Creative X-Fi Sonic Carrier, launched in January 2016, consists of a long main unit and a subwoofer that houses 17 drivers in an 11.2.4 speaker configuration. This allows it to produce incredibly powerful and precise audio. It is one of the first few speaker designs to incorporate [[Dolby Atmos]] surround processing, and also features Creative's EAX 15.2 Dimensional Audio to extract, enhance and upscale natural, enveloping sound from legacy material.

The audio and video engine of the X-Fi Sonic Carrier are powered by 7 processors with a total of 14 cores. It supports both local and streaming video content at up to 4K 60fps, as well as 15.2 channels of high resolution audio playback.

It also comes with 3 distinct wireless technologies that allow multi-room Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and a zero-latency speaker-to-speaker link to up to 4 subwoofer units.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.creative.com/corporate/pressroom/?id=13494|title=Press Relations|website=www.creative.com|access-date=2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4256">'''Diemoth (Diemudus, Diemut, Diemud, Diemuth, Diemod, Diemudis)''' (born about 1060; died 30 March, probably in 1130) was the name of a [[recluse]] at [[Wessobrunn Abbey]] in [[Upper Bavaria]], [[Germany]]. ("Diemoth" is the [[Middle High German]] word for "humility" or "modesty").&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04785c.htm|title=Diemoth}}&lt;/ref&gt; She worked on 45 manuscripts from 1075 to 1130.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=[[Dictionary of Women Artists]]: Artists, J-Z|last=Gaze|first=Delia|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=1997|isbn=9781884964213|location=New York|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and works==
Little is known about Diemoth's private life. Most of the available information is based on a sixteenth-century biographer. Much of this must be considered embellished legend rather than fact. According to the traditional version, she was born of a noble [[Bavaria]]n or [[Swabia]]n family, and while still a child entered the [[Order of St. Benedict|Benedictine]] [[nunnery]] connected with the Benedictine monastery of [[Wessobrunn]]. This is almost certainly not true, since the Wessobrunn monastery was male-only until at least CE 1100. The monks would not have taken it upon themselves to educate one single young girl. Thus it is much more likely that Diemoth entered the Wessobrunn monastery as an adult. Her proficient handwriting shows evidence of professional training, so that it is likely Diemoth did not come to Wessobrunn until after an active career as a professional scribe. Her knowledge of Latin indicates that she was educated at an ecclesiastical institute, probably a double monastery elsewhere in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Beach |first= Alison I. |authorlink= |coauthors= | title= Women as Scribes. Book Production and Monastic Reform in Twelfth-Century Bavaria. |series= Cambridge studies in palaeography and codicology, vol. 10. |publisher= Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press  |date= 2004 |isbn= 978-0-521-79243-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diemoth had herself enclosed in a cell adjoining the church, where she spent the remainder of her life in prayer and in transcribing valuable books. On account of her exceptionally beautiful handwriting she was styled "the beautiful scribe". She copied about forty-five volumes,&lt;ref&gt;The titles are given by Becker in his "Catalogi bibliothecarum antiqui" (Bonn 1885), pp. 155-136.&lt;/ref&gt; of which the most important are: the [[Bible]]; the ''[[Moralia]]'' and other works of Saint [[Gregory the Great]]; seven works of [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]]; four of [[Saint Jerome]]; two of [[Origen]]; and about fifteen liturgical works.

Diemoth was a great friend of the Blessed [[Herkula]] with whom she exchanged numerous letters while the latter was a recluse at the neighbouring monastery of [[Epfach]]. The letters were long preserved at the monastery of [[Bernried]] where Herluka spent the last years of her life, but they unhappily fell prey to the ravages of the forces of [[Sweden]] during the [[Thirty Years War]]. A few of Diemoth's manuscripts are still preserved at the [[Bayerische Staatsbibliothek]] in [[Munich]], where they were taken after the secularisation of Wessobrunn in 1803.

Diemoth was buried in the basilica of Our Lady at Wessobrunn, beside the bodies of Abbot [[Thiento]] and his six companions, who suffered martyrdom at the hands of the [[Hungarians]] in 955. In 1709 her remains were transferred to the abbey church of St. Peter. She is sometimes referred to as "Blessed," though she has never received public veneration and was never formally beatified.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4191">'''Donald Gladstone Rodney''' (18 May 1961 – 4 March 1998) was a British artist. He was a leading figure in [[United Kingdom|Britain]]'s [[BLK Art Group]] of the 1980s and became recognised as "one of the most innovative and versatile artists of his generation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/exhibition/donald-rodney-display/biography-and-timeline|title=Donald Rodney Display - Biography|accessdate=22 October 2007|year=2004|publisher=Tate Britain}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rodney's work appropriated images from the mass media, art and popular culture to explore issues of [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial identity]] and [[racism]].

==Early life and career==
Rodney was born and raised in [[Birmingham]], [[England]]. He completed a pre-degree course at [[Bournville School of Art]] and went on to complete an [[honours degree]] in [[Fine Art]] at [[Trent Polytechnic]] in [[Nottingham]], graduating in the mid 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iniva.org/autoicon/DR/bio.htm|title=Donald Rodney biography|last=Chambers|first=Eddie|date=December 1999|publisher=[[Iniva]]|accessdate=12 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; There, he met [[Keith Piper (artist)|Keith Piper]], also from Birmingham. Piper was to influence Rodney's work towards more political themes. The works of Rodney and Piper, alongside [[Eddie Chambers (writer and artist)|Eddie Chambers]], Marlene Smith and [[Claudette Johnson]] became recognised as a distinct movement within British art, whose attachments were to social and political narratives.

==Death and legacy==
Rodney suffered from [[sickle-cell anaemia]], a debilitating disease that grew steadily worse during his life.&lt;ref name="Latimer"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/29130/donald-rodney/|title=Donald Rodney|last=Latimer|first=Quinn|date=1 November 2008|publisher=[[Artinfo]]|accessdate=12 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to an interest in discarded hospital X-rays and other medical themes that began to inform his work. Rodney used X-rays as a metaphor to represent the "disease" of [[apartheid]] and racial discrimination in society.&lt;ref&gt;Tanya Barson, [http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/rodney-in-the-house-of-my-father-p78529/text-summary "Donald Rodney | In the House of My Father 1996–7"], Tate, February 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, Rodney succumbed to the disease&lt;ref name="Latimer"/&gt; and died on 4 March.

After his death, Rodney’s work was shown in the prestigious British art show ''5''. He was also included in the show ''Give and Take, Works Presented to Museums by the Contemporary Art Society'' held at the [[Harris Museum]] and the [[Jerwood Gallery]] (2000).

In 2003 Rodney's papers were donated to the Tate Archive.

The exhibition ''Donald Rodney - In Retrospect'' took place at [[Iniva]], [[London]], 30 October–29 November 2008.&lt;ref name=Iniva&gt;Iniva, [http://www.iniva.org/programme/projects/donald-rodney-in-retrospect/ "Donald Rodney In Retrospect"] Iniva, 2017 .&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Duke of York's Theatre''' is a [[West End Theatre]] in St Martin's Lane, in the [[City of Westminster]], London.  It was built for [[Frank Wyatt (singer)|Frank Wyatt]] and his wife, [[Violet Melnotte]], who retained ownership of the theatre until her death in 1935. It opened on 10 September 1892 as the '''Trafalgar Square Theatre''', with ''[[Frédéric Toulmouche|The Wedding Eve]]''. The theatre, designed by the architect [[Walter Emden]] became known as the '''Trafalgar Theatre''' in 1894 and the following year became the Duke of York's to honour the future [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/whowaswho/M/MelnotteViolet.htm ''Violet Melnotte (1855–1935)'' D'Oyly Carte, Who Was Who (Boise State University)] accessed 11 Oct 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the earliest [[Edwardian musical comedy|musical comedies]], ''[[Go-Bang]]'', was a success at the theatre in 1894.  In 1900, [[Jerome K. Jerome]]'s ''Miss Hobbs'' was staged as well as [[David Belasco]]'s ''[[Madame Butterfly]]'', which was seen by [[Giacomo Puccini|Puccini]], who later turned it into the famous opera. This was also the theatre where [[J. M. Barrie]]'s ''[[Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up]]'' debuted on 27 December 1904.  Many famous British actors have appeared here, including [[Basil Rathbone]], who played Alfred de Musset in ''Madame Sand'' in June 1920, returning in November 1932 as the Unknown Gentleman in ''Tonight or Never''.

The theatre was [[listed building|Grade II listed]] by [[English Heritage]] in September 1960.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?pid=2&amp;id=426958 English Heritage listing details] accessed 28 Apr 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1970s the freehold of the theatre was purchased by [[Capital Radio]] and it closed in 1979 for refurbishment. It reopened in February 1980 and the first production under the patronage of Capital was ''Rose'', starring [[Glenda Jackson]].  In 1991 comedian [[Pat Condell]] performed sketches at the theatre which were later released on DVD.&lt;ref name="barfbite"&gt;{{cite web

The [[Ambassador Theatre Group]] bought the theatre in 1992; this coincided with the successful [[Royal Court Theatre|Royal Court]] production of [[Ariel Dorfman]]'s ''[[Death and the Maiden (play)|Death and the Maiden]]''. A host of successes followed including the 21st anniversary performance of Richard O'Brien's ''[[The Rocky Horror Show]]'' and the Royal Court Classics Season in 1995.

The theatre is the London headquarters of the Ambassador Theatre Group, as well as the producing offices of their subsidiary [[Sonia Friedman|Sonia Friedman Productions]], whose revival of ''[[In Celebration (play)|In Celebration]]'' starring [[Orlando Bloom]] played until 15 September 2007.

'''Michael Edward''' “'''Ed'''” '''Ross''' (October 27, 1965 – July 30, 2016) was an American [[tintype]] photographer and lawyer. His photography work spanned 27 years. His last six years were devoted exclusively to wet-plate photography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hakala|first1=Kate|title=Meet One Photographer Who is Reviving the Extraordinary Art of Tintypes|url=http://www.nerve.com/art/meet-one-photographer-who-is-reviving-the-extraordinary-art-of-tintypes|website=Nerve.com|accessdate=2016-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; His focus as an artist was primarily on [[Portrait photography|nude portraits]] and [[landscape photography]].{{fact|date=December 2018}}

==History==
Ross was born in [[Ukiah, California]] to Bill and Dorothy Ross and raised in [[Davis, California]]. He attended Jesuit High School in [[UC San Diego]], studied at the [[London School of Economics]], and the [[UC Hastings]] School of Law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Member Detail|url=http://members.calbar.ca.gov/fal/Member/Detail/173048|publisher=The State Bar of California}}&lt;/ref&gt; He worked as senior legal counsel for the [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] computer company in [[Cupertino, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Michael Edward Ross - Obituary|url=http://www.davisenterprise.com/obits/michael-edward-ross/|website=davisenterprise.com|accessdate=2016-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Photography==
Ross had taken photographs for 27 years, and during the last eight years of his life used the [[Collodion process]] or wet-plates for his work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hakala|first1=Kate|title=Meet One Photographer Who is Reviving the Extraordinary Art of Tintypes|url=http://www.nerve.com/art/meet-one-photographer-who-is-reviving-the-extraordinary-art-of-tintypes|website=Nerve.com|accessdate=2016-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ross worked with three different cameras: a half-plate box-style camera made by Ty Guillory, an {{convert|8|×|10|in}} bellows-style camera made by Black Art Woodcraft, and a {{convert|16|×|20|in}} Chamonix. He used 'period' lenses, manufactured between 1850 and 1900, by Dallmeyer, Voigtlander, and Ross.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jane|first1=Katherine|title=The Quite Delightful Project|url=https://quitedelightfulproject.com/journal/ed-ross-interview-2/|website=quitedelightfulproject.com|accessdate=2014-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NUDES AND PORTRAITS BY ED ROSS|url=http://www.juxtapoz.com/news/erotica/nudes-and-portraits-by-ed-ross/|website=juxtapoz.com|accessdate=2014-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2013}}

A '''flashback''' (sometimes called an '''analepsis''') is an interjected [[scene (fiction)|scene]] that takes the narrative back in time from the current point in the [[Plot (narrative)|story]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Pavis, Shantz | year= 1998 | title = Dictionary of the Theatre: Terms, Concepts, and Analysis | publisher = University of Toronto Press | page = 151 | isbn= 0802081630}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flashbacks are often used to recount events that happened before the story's primary sequence of events to fill in crucial [[backstory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Kenny | year = 2004 | title = Teaching Tv Production in a Digital World: Integrating Media Literacy | publisher = Libraries Unltd Incorporated | page = 163 | isbn= 1591581990}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the opposite direction, a [[flashforward]] (or prolepsis) reveals events that will occur in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/flash-forward|title=flash-forward|author=|date=|website=thefreedictionary.com|accessdate=2 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Both flashback and flashforward are used to cohere a story, develop a character, or add structure to the narrative. In literature, '''internal analepsis''' is a flashback to an earlier point in the narrative; '''external analepsis''' is a flashback to a time before the narrative started.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Jung | year = 2010 | title = Narrating Violence in Post-9/11 Action Cinema: Terrorist Narratives, Cinematic Narration, and Referentiality | publisher = VS Verlag für Sozialwissenschaften | page = 67 | isbn= 3531926020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In film, flashbacks depict the subjective experience of a character by showing a memory of a previous event and they are often used to "resolve an enigma".&lt;ref&gt;Hayward, Susan. "Flashback" in ''Cinema Studies: The Key Concepts'' (Third Edition). Routledge, 2006. p. 153-160 &lt;/ref&gt; Flashbacks are important in [[film noir]] and [[melodrama]] films. &lt;ref&gt;Hayward, Susan. "Flashback" in ''Cinema Studies: The Key Concepts'' (Third Edition). Routledge, 2006. p. 153-160 &lt;/ref&gt; In movies and television, several camera techniques, editing approaches and special effects have evolved to alert the viewer that the action shown is a flashback or flashforward; for example, the edges of the picture may be deliberately blurred, photography may be jarring or choppy, or unusual coloration or sepia tone, or [[monochrome]] when most of the story is in full color, may be used. The scene may fade or dissolve, often with the camera focused on the face of the character and there is typically a voice-over by a narrator (who is often, but not always, the character who is experiencing the memory).&lt;ref&gt;Hayward, Susan. "Flashback" in ''Cinema Studies: The Key Concepts'' (Third Edition). Routledge, 2006. p. 153-160 &lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable examples==

===Literature===
An early example of analepsis is in the ''[[Ramayana]]'' and ''[[Mahabharata]]'', where the main story is narrated through a [[frame story]] set at a later time. Another ancient example occurs in the ''[[Odyssey]]'', in which the tale of Odysseus' wanderings is told in flashback by Odysseus to a listener. Another early use of this device in a [[Crime fiction|murder mystery]] was in "[[The Three Apples]]", an ''[[One Thousand and One Nights|Arabian Nights]]'' tale. The story begins with the discovery of a young woman's dead body. After the murderer later reveals himself, he narrates his reasons for the murder in a series of flashbacks leading up to the discovery of her dead body at the beginning of the story.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Story-Telling Techniques in the Arabian Nights|first=David|last=Pinault|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|year=1992|isbn=90-04-09530-6|page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flashbacks are also employed in several other ''Arabian Nights'' tales such as "[[Sinbad the Sailor]]" and "[[The City of Brass]]".

Analepsis was used extensively by author [[Ford Madox Ford]], and by poet, author, historian and mythologist [[Robert Graves]]. The 1927 book ''[[The Bridge of San Luis Rey]]'' by [[Thornton Wilder]] is the progenitor of the modern disaster epic in literature and film-making, where a single disaster intertwines the victims, whose lives are then explored by means of flashbacks of events leading up to the disaster. Analepsis is also used in ''[[Night (novel)|Night]]'' by [[Elie Wiesel]]. If flashbacks are extensive and in chronological order, one can say that these form the present of the story, while the rest of the story consists of flash forwards. If flashbacks are presented in non-chronological order, the time at which the story takes place can be ambiguous: An example of such an occurrence is in ''[[Slaughterhouse-Five]]'' where the narrative jumps back and forth in time, so there is no actual present time line. ''[[Os Lusíadas]]'' is a story about voyage of [[Vasco da Gama]] to [[India]] and back. The narration starts when they were arriving [[Africa]] but it quickly flashes back to the beginning of the story which is when they were leaving [[Portugal]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Os Lusíadas]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series employs a magical device called a [[Magical objects in Harry Potter#Pensieve|Pensieve]], which changes the nature of flashbacks from a mere narrative device to an event directly experienced by the characters, which are thus able to provide commentary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PensieveFlashback|title=Pensieve Flashback - TV Tropes|author=|date=|website=tvtropes.org|accessdate=2 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171027011816/http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PensieveFlashback|archivedate=27 October 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film===
The creator of the flashback technique in cinema was ''[[Histoire d'un crime (film)|Histoire d’un crime]]'' directed by [[Ferdinand Zecca]] in 1901. &lt;ref&gt;Turim, Maureen. ''Flashbacks in Film: Memory &amp; History By Maureen Turim''. p.24&lt;/ref&gt; Flashbacks were first employed during the sound era in [[Rouben Mamoulian]]'s 1931 film ''[[City Streets (1931 film)|City Streets]]'', but were rare until about 1939 when, in [[William Wyler]]'s ''[[Wuthering Heights (1939 film)|Wuthering Heights]]'' as in [[Emily Brontë]]'s original novel, the housekeeper Ellen narrates the main story to overnight visitor Mr. Lockwood, who has witnessed Heathcliff's frantic pursuit of what is apparently a ghost. More famously, also in 1939, [[Marcel Carné]]'s movie ''[[Le Jour Se Lève]]'' is told almost entirely through flashback: the story starts with the murder of a man in a hotel. While the murderer, played by [[Jean Gabin]], is surrounded by the police, several flashbacks tell the story of why he killed the man at the beginning of the movie.

One of the most famous examples of a flashback is in the [[Orson Welles]]' film ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' (1941). The protagonist, Charles Foster Kane, dies at the beginning, uttering the word ''Rosebud''. The remainder of the film is framed by a reporter's interviewing Kane's friends and associates, in a futile effort to discover what the word meant to Kane. As the interviews proceed, pieces of Kane's life unfold in flashback, but Welles' use of such unconventional flashbacks was thought to have been influenced by [[William K. Howard]]'s ''[[The Power and the Glory (1933 film)|The Power and the Glory]]''. Hitchcock used a flashback in ''[[Marnie (film)|Marnie]]'' (1956) to reveal the enigma that led to psychological disturbances for the female lead; as with Welles' film, he delayed the flashback until the end of the movie.&lt;ref&gt;Hayward, Susan. "Flashback" in ''Cinema Studies: The Key Concepts'' (Third Edition). Routledge, 2006. p. 153-160 &lt;/ref&gt;

Though usually used to clarify plot or backstory, flashbacks can also act as an [[unreliable narrator]]. [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Stage Fright (1950 film)|Stage Fright]]'' from 1950 notoriously featured a flashback that did not tell the truth but dramatized a lie from a witness. The multiple and contradictory staged reconstructions of a crime in [[Errol Morris]]'s 1988 documentary ''[[The Thin Blue Line (1988 film)|The Thin Blue Line]]'' are presented as flashbacks based on divergent testimony. [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s 1950 ''[[Rashomon]]'' does this in the most celebrated fictional use of contested multiple testimonies.

Sometimes a flashback is inserted into a film even though there was none in the original source from which the film was adapted. The 1956 film version of [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]]'s stage musical ''[[Carousel (musical)|Carousel]]'' used a flashback device which somewhat takes the impact away from a very dramatic plot development later in the film. This was done because the plot of ''Carousel'' was then considered unusually strong for a film musical. In film version of ''[[Camelot (film)|Camelot]]'' (1967), according to [[Alan Jay Lerner]], a flashback was added not to soften the blow of a later plot development but because the stage show had been criticized for shifting too abruptly in tone from near-comedy to tragedy.

In [[Billy Wilder]]'s [[film noir]] ''[[Double Indemnity (film)|Double Indemnity]]'' (1944), a flashback from the main character is used to provide a confession to his fraudulent and criminal activities.&lt;ref&gt;Hayward, Susan. "Flashback" in ''Cinema Studies: The Key Concepts'' (Third Edition). Routledge, 2006. p. 153-160 &lt;/ref&gt;

A good example of both flashback and [[flashforward]] is the first scene of ''[[La Jetée]]'' (1962). As we learn a few minutes later, what we are seeing in that scene is a flashback to the past, since the present of the film's [[diegesis]] is a time directly following [[World War III]]. However, as we learn at the very end of the film, that scene also doubles as a prolepsis, since the dying man the boy is seeing is, in fact, himself. In other words, he is proleptically seeing his own death. We thus have an analepsis and prolepsis in the very same scene.

Occasionally, a story may contain a flashback within a flashback, with the earliest known example appearing in [[Jacques Feyder]]'s ''[[L'Atlantide (1921 film)|L'Atlantide]]''. ''[[Little Annie Rooney (1925 film)|Little Annie Rooney]]'' (1925) contains a flashback scene in a Chinese laundry, with a flashback within that flashback in the corner of the screen.  In [[John Ford]]'s ''[[The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance]]'' (1962), the main action of the film is told in flashback, with the scene of Liberty Valance's murder occurring as a flashback within that flashback. Other examples that contains flashbacks within flashbacks are the 1968 [[Cinema of Japan|Japanese film]] ''Lone Wolf Isazo''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Lone Stalker A.K.A. Lone Wolf Isazo|publisher=[[Japan Society (New York)|Japan Society]]|url=http://www.japansociety.org/event_detail?eid=134fbb96|accessdate=2011-03-16|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101061943/http://www.japansociety.org/event_detail?eid=134fbb96|archivedate=1 January 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2004's ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (2004 film)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'', where almost the entire film (set in 1870) is told as a flashback from 1919 (in [[black-and-white]]) and contains other flashbacks; for example, Madame Giry rescuing the Phantom from a freak show. An extremely convoluted story may contain flashbacks within flashbacks within flashbacks, as in ''[[Six Degrees of Separation (film)|Six Degrees of Separation]]'', ''[[Passage to Marseille]]'', and ''[[The Locket]]''. This technique is a hallmark of [[Kannada]] movie director [[Upendra (actor)|Upendra]] whose futuristic flick ''[[Super (2010 Indian film)|Super]]'' (2010) is set in 2030 and contains multiple flashbacks ranging from 2010 to 2015 depicting a [[Utopian and dystopian fiction|utopian]] India.

[[Satyajit Ray]] experimented with flashbacks in ''[[Pratidwandi|The Adversary]]'' (Pratidwandi, 1972), pioneering the technique of [[Negative (photography)|photo-negative]] flashbacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=First Light: Satyajit Ray From the Apu Trilogy to the Calcutta Trilogy|author=Nick Pinkerton|date=14 April 2009|publisher=''[[The Village Voice]]''|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2009-04-15/film/first-light-satyajit-ray-from-the-apu-trilogy-to-the-calcutta-trilogy|accessdate=2009-07-09|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090625154630/http://www.villagevoice.com/2009-04-15/film/first-light-satyajit-ray-from-the-apu-trilogy-to-the-calcutta-trilogy|archivedate=25 June 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Quentin Tarantino]] makes extensive use of the flashback and flashforward in many of his films.  In ''[[Reservoir Dogs]]'' (1992), for example, scenes of the story present are intercut with various flashbacks to give each character's backstory and motivation additional context.  In ''[[Pulp Fiction]]'' (1994), which uses a highly [[nonlinear storytelling|nonlinear]] narrative, traditional flashback is also used in the sequence titled "The Gold Watch".  Other films, such as his two-part ''[[Kill Bill]]'' (Part I 2003, Part II 2004), also feature a narrative that bounces between present time and flashbacks.

===Television===
The television series [[Quantico (TV series)]], ''[[Kung Fu (TV series) | Kung Fu]]'', ''[[Psych]]'', ''[[How I Met Your Mother]]'', ''[[Grounded for Life]]'', ''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]],'' and ''[[I Didn't Do It (TV series)|I Didn't Do It]]'' use flashbacks in every episode. Flashbacks were also a predominant feature of the television shows ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'', ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'' and ''[[Orange Is the New Black]]''.  Many detective shows routinely use flashback in the last act to reveal the culprit's plot, e.g. ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]'', ''[[Banacek]],'' ''[[Columbo]].''

'''Freydoon Rassouli''' is an Iranian-Born, American abstract [[surrealist]] and [[visionary]] artist and author.

==Life==

Inspired and encouraged by his Sufi mystic uncle, Rassouli began [[painting]] and learning the poetry of [[Hafez|Hafiz]] and [[Rumi]] from early age. He studied with [[Persian miniature]] painters at the same time as he was learning European classical and [[Impressionism|Impressionist]] painting techniques. At fifteen, he won the title of "best student artist in Iran" and was awarded a government grant to study painting in Europe.

Rassouli migrated to the [[United States]] in 1963,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rassouli|url=
http://www.livingwellmagazine.net/home/art/278-rassouli.html|first=Lauren Ashley|last=Golt|work=Living Well Magazine|accessdate=October 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he studied painting and [[architecture]] at the [[University of New Mexico]], and was honored with the Leadership Award from the [[Institute of International Education]]. Rassouli started his professional career as an architect, but later on became a full-time artist,&lt;ref name="pw"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pathwayswithin.com/FullView.php?Issue=305&amp;Story=45|date=Summer 2003|first=Leslie|last=Palacio|accessdate=October 14, 2009|title=A Conversation With Rassouli|work=Pathways Within}}&lt;/ref&gt; writer and inspirational speaker. Within the past thirty years, Rassouli has exhibited in the United States, Europe and Asia. He has also written three books, and co-authored six books and three card decks. He guides others in retreats, shares his approach to creativity through public talks and in media interviews. Rassouli is presently living in Southern California.

Rassouli's public artworks include the ''Angel of Unity'', a {{convert|45|x|120|foot}} mural on a wall at the corner of Washington Blvd. and the Pacific Coast in [[Venice, Los Angeles, California|Venice, California]]. Another of his murals is ''Creation'', located in [[downtown Los Angeles]]. It is {{convert|82|x|16|ft}}.  Rassouli's images also appear in the books ''Jung: A Journey of Transformation Exploring His Life and Experiencing His Ideas''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and ''Language of Souls'',&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; along with many magazines and book covers.&lt;ref name="pw" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

[[File:Ojo de dios anaroza.jpg|thumb|360px|God's eye or Ojo de Dios on Quemado Mountain, [[San Luis Potosi]], [[Mexico]]]]
A '''God's eye''' (in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], '''''Ojo de Dios''''') is a spiritual and votive object made by weaving a design out of yarn upon a wooden cross. Often several colors are used. They are commonly found in [[Mexican people|Mexican]] and [[Mexican Americans|Mexican American]] communities, among both Indigenous and Catholic peoples.

''Ojos de Dios'' are common in the [[Pueblos]] of [[New Mexico]]. Often they reflect a confidence in all-seeing Providence. The spiritual eye of the ''Ojos de Dios'' is thought by some believers to have the power to see and understand things unknown to the physical eye.  During Spanish colonial times in New Mexico, from the 16th to the 19th centuries, ''Ojos de Dios'' (God's Eye) were placed where people worked, or where they walked along a trail (Major, 2012).

In other parts of the Americas, artisans weave complicated or variegated versions of the traditional ''Ojos de Dios'', selling them as decorations or religious objects. There has also been a huge increase in the use of Ojos de Dios as an easy and fun craft for children.

The Ojo de Dios or God's eye is a ritual tool that was believed to protect those while they pray, magical object, and an ancient cultural symbol evoking the weaving motif and its spiritual associations for the [[Huichol people|Huichol]] and [[Tepehuan]] Indians of western [[Mexico]]. The Huichol call their God's Eyes '''Sikuli''', which means "the power to see and understand things unknown."{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} When a child is born, the central eye is woven by the father, then one eye is added for every year of the child's life until the child reaches the age of five.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} Original Tepehuan Crosses are extremely rare to come by. There are many that are being made for the tourist market, but they do not carry the same traditional and spiritual significance.

==Nierika, Nieli’ka==
[[File:God's eyes.jpg|thumb|''Ojo de dios'' made from [[chopstick]]s and yarn]]

In the traditional Huichol ranchos, the ''nieli'ka'' or ''nierika'' is an important ritual artifact. Negrín states that one of the principal meanings of "''nierika''" is that of "a metaphysical vision, an aspect of a god or a collective ancestor,"&lt;ref name=n3&gt;Negrín 2003&lt;/ref&gt; and is the same term the [[Tepehuán people]] use to refer to deities. Negrín quotes Lumholtz as stating that for the Huichol and Tepehuan "a ''nierika'' means a picture, an appearance, or a sacred representation."&lt;ref name=n3/&gt; The term ''nierika'' is etymologically rooted in the verb ''nieriya'', "to see".  ''Nierika'' are found in Huichol and Tepehuans' most sacred places: house shrines (''xiriki''), springs, caves and temples. Some Natives of northwest Mexico and throughout the southwest U.S. have had visions during [[peyote]] ceremonies in which they received guidance from Gods who appeared before them in many shapes, though the eyes of the God were so intense and overwhelming that many Natives could only see the eye of the God. To show others the vision they had, they made the ''God's eye'' - woven on sticks with handspun yarn, colored with various types of berries, flowers, and other materials to capture the essence of their vision.

Negrín states that: "The [[votive]] ''nierika'' is generally a round offering, symbolizing an ancestor and prayer offerings sanctified by the blood of a sacrificed animal."&lt;ref name=n3/&gt; ''Nierika'' as a ritual object may be attached to votive arrows with bamboo and yarn, or wood-and-wax-embedded objects.  Similarly, Lumholtz states that the ''nierika'' "evokes an [[ancestor]], thanks it with blood offerings, and invokes its favors."  The ''nierika'' may take different forms and fabrication may differ greatly:  a small round or square tablet with a hole in the center covered on one or both sides with a mixture of [[beeswax]] and pine resin into which threads of yarn are pressed; when the image is not round, it may be considered a resting mat for the ancestors, or a prayer mat or itari.

Negrín states the elaborate interwoven ''nierika'' that Lumholtz called ''namma'' (which is close to the pronunciation of [[Namkha]]) from which originated the detailed and now prized yarn paintings of the commercial art world, are now rarely if ever seen.&lt;ref name="n3"/&gt;  ''Namma'' were generally rectangular or square in shape, with yarn woven onto a grid of bamboo sticks.  These God’s Eyes are also called by the Spanish term ''ojo de dios''. One understanding of the ''ojo de dios'' according to Harvey is of a: "wand" (the eye) through which the eye of god will see the supplicant. Harvey states that: "The cross of the ''ojo de dios'' is that of the legendary four directions: earth, fire, water, and air."&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, 1973:  9-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra''' ('''GSO'''; {{lang-sv|Göteborgs Symfoniker}}) is a Swedish [[symphony orchestra]] based in [[Gothenburg]].  The GSO is resident at the [[Gothenburg Concert Hall]] at [[Götaplatsen]].  The orchestra received the title of the '''National Orchestra of Sweden''' ({{lang-sv|Sveriges Nationalorkester}}) in 1997. 

The GSO was founded in 1905, with Heinrich Hammer as its first principal conductor.  The composer [[Wilhelm Stenhammar]] was the orchestra's second principal conductor, from 1907 to 1922.  In addition to Stenhammar conducting his own works, [[Jean Sibelius]] and [[Carl Nielsen]] made regular guest-conducting appearances with the GSO.  The orchestra's fortunes waxed and waned in subsequent years, until the advent of [[Neeme Järvi]] as principal conductor, from 1982 to 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Tim Ashley | title=North stars | url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2001/jul/27/arts.highereducation | work=The Guardian | date=2001-07-27 | accessdate=2016-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the GSO has a broad repertoire, it has a special affinity for the works of the Nordic Late Romantic composers, such as [[Jean Sibelius]] and [[Edvard Grieg]].  During Järvi's tenure as principal conductor, the longest tenure of any principal conductor in the GSO's history, its reputation on the world stage was greatly increased, including sponsorships from [[Volvo]] and a recording contract with [[Deutsche Grammophon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Andrew Clements | title=Sibelius: The Symphonies, Gothenburg SO/ Jarvi(Deutsche Grammophon, four SACDs) | url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2005/sep/09/classicalmusicandopera.shopping2 | work=The Guardian | date=2005-09-09 | accessdate=2012-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Järvi currently holds the title of Principal Conductor Emeritus (''Chefdirigent Emeritus'') with the GSO.

[[Gustavo Dudamel]] was principal conductor of the GSO from 2007 to 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Reed Johnson | title=Conductor Gustavo Dudamel is riding a wave of Dudamania | url=http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-et-dudamel23-2008nov23,0,1947651.story | work=Los Angeles Times | date=2008-11-23 | accessdate=2008-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.gso.se/?pageid=8216 | title=Dudamel förnyar kontrakt med Göteborgs Symfoniker till 2012 | publisher=Göteborgs Symfoniker | date=30 September 2009 | accessdate=2009-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and now has the title of ''hedersdirigent'' (honorary conductor) of the GSO.  Past principal guest conductors of the GSO have included [[Christian Zacharias]].  [[Kent Nagano]] became principal guest conductor and artistic advisor of the GSO as of the 2013-2014 season, with an initial contract of 3 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Malin Clausson | title=Nagano tar över efter Dudamel | url=http://www.gp.se/kulturnoje/1.1049887-nagano-tar-over-efter-dudamel | work=Göteborgs-Posten | date=2012-08-30 | accessdate=2012-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In August 2014, [[Santtu-Matias Rouvali]] first guest-conducted the GSO.  In May 2016, the GSO announced the  appointment of Rouvali as its next chief conductor, effective with the 2017-2018 season, with an initial contract of 4 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.harrisonparrott.com/news/gothenburg-symphony-appoints-santtu-matias-rouvali-chief-conductor | title=Gothenburg Symphony appoints Santtu-Matias Rouvali as Chief Conductor | publisher=Harrison Parrott | date=25 May 2016 | accessdate=2016-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author= | title=31-årig dirigent ska leda symfonikerna i Goteborg | url=http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=478&amp;artikel=6439998 | work=Sverige-Radio | date=2016-05-25 | accessdate=2016-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5052">'''Hermína Týrlová''' (11 December 1900 in [[Příbram|Březové Hory]] – 3 May 1993 in [[Zlín]]) was a prominent [[Czech people|Czech]] [[animator]], [[screen writer]], and [[film director]]. She was often called ''the mother of Czech animation''. Over the course of her career, she produced over 60 animated children's short films using puppets and the technique of [[stop motion]] animation.

== Biography and Career ==
Born in [[Příbram|Březové Hory]] in Central [[Bohemia]], Hermína Týrlová learned puppet-making skills from her father, who was a woodworker and made small wood figurines. As a teenager, she moved to Prague to make a living acting, singing, and dancing in [[vaudeville]]. She also began writing and illustrating children's magazines. In 1925, she joined Studio AB, where she met her future husband, Karel Dodal. The studio produced animated films for advertising companies such as ''Elektrajournal'' and ''IRE-Film.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.radio.cz/fr/rubrique/celebres/hermina-tyrlova|title=Radio Prague - Hermina Tyrlova|website=www.radio.cz|access-date=2016-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dodal and Týrlová produced 5 animated advertising films together,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.radio.cz/es/rubrica/personalidades/hermina-tyrlova-pionera-del-cine-animado-checo|title=Radio Praga - Hermína Týrlová, pionera del cine animado checo|website=www.radio.cz|access-date=2016-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1935, they co-directed the first commercial Czech puppet animation film, ''Tajemství Lucerny'' ("The Lantern's Secret"'').''

Following the 1939 [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia]], Karel Dodal took exile in the [[United States]] and then [[Argentina]]. Týrlová chose to remain in Czechoslovakia. In 1941, she moved to [[Zlín]] in eastern [[Moravia]] to work with Ladislav Kolda at Bata Studios, where she remained for the rest of her life.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1944, she released the short film ''Ferda Mravenec'' ("Fernando the Ant"), which achieved worldwide popularity. The original puppet for the main character is on display in the Toy Museum in [[Figueres|Figueres, Spain]]. In 1947, she co-directed ''Vzpoura Hracek'' ("Revolt of the Toys") with Frantisek Sadek,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Hermina Tyrlova|title=Vzpoura Hracek (Revolution in Toyland)|date=1946-01-01|url=https://archive.org/details/VzpouraHracekrevolutionInToyland1946|accessdate=2016-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; which combined stop-motion animation with live action footage.

She continued to write and direct animated films until 1986, and she died in [[Zlín]] on May 3, 1993 at the age of 92.

The [[Hugo Award]]s are presented every year by the World Science Fiction Society for the best [[science fiction]] or [[fantasy]] works and achievements of the previous year. The award is named after [[Hugo Gernsback]], the founder of the pioneering science fiction magazine ''[[Amazing Stories]]'', and was once officially known as the Science Fiction Achievement Award.&lt;ref name="LocusHugoinfo"/&gt; The award has been described as "a fine showcase for speculative fiction" and "the best known literary award for science fiction writing".&lt;ref name="GuardianHugo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LitroHugo"/&gt; The '''Hugo Award for Best Fan Artist''' is given each year for artists of works related to science fiction or fantasy which appeared in low- or non-paying publications such as [[semiprozine]]s or [[fanzine]]s. A [[Hugo Award for Best Professional Artist|Hugo Award for professional artists]] is also given. The fan award was first presented in 1967 and has been awarded annually. Beginning in 1996, Retrospective Hugo Awards, or "Retro Hugos", have been available to be awarded for years 50, 75, or 100 years prior in which no awards were given.&lt;ref name="thafaq"/&gt; To date, Retro Hugo awards have been awarded for 1939, 1941, 1943, 1946, 1951, and 1954, although only the 1946 and 1951 Retro Hugos received sufficient nominations for the Fan Artist Hugo to make the ballot.&lt;ref name="Hugo54"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LocusRetroHugoinfo"/&gt;

Hugo Award nominees and winners are chosen by supporting or attending members of the annual [[Worldcon|World Science Fiction Convention]], or Worldcon, and the presentation evening constitutes its central event. The selection process is defined in the World Science Fiction Society Constitution as [[instant-runoff voting]] with six nominees, except in the case of a tie. The works on the ballot are those six most-nominated by members that year, with no limit on the number of works that can be nominated.&lt;ref name="thafaq"/&gt; Initial nominations are made by members in January through March, while voting on the ballot of six nominations is performed roughly in April through July, subject to change depending on when that year's Worldcon is held.&lt;ref name="thaabout"/&gt; Prior to 2017, the final ballot was five works; it was changed that year to six, with each initial nominator limited to five nominations.&lt;ref name="2017change"/&gt; Worldcons are generally held near [[Labor Day]] and in a different city around the world each year.&lt;ref name="LocusHugoinfo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="worldcon"/&gt;

[[File:BradFoster.jpg|right|thumb|[[Brad W. Foster]] has received the largest number of awards, with 8 wins out of 27 nominations.]]
During the 54 nomination years, 70 artists have been nominated; 28 of these have won, including co-winners and Retro Hugos. [[Brad W. Foster]] has received the largest number of awards, with 8 wins out of 27 nominations. [[William Rotsler]] and [[Tim Kirk]] have won five awards, from twenty-three and eight nominations respectively. The only other artists to win more than twice are [[Teddy Harvia]], with four out of twenty nominations, [[Alexis A. Gilliland]], with four out of eight, and [[Frank Wu (artist)|Frank Wu]], also with four out of eight.

=== Retro Hugos ===
Beginning with the [[54th World Science Fiction Convention|1996 Worldcon]], the World Science Fiction Society created the concept of "Retro Hugos", in which the Hugo award could be retroactively awarded for 50, 75, or 100 years prior. Retro Hugos may only be awarded for years in which a Worldcon was hosted, but no awards were originally given.&lt;ref name="thafaq"/&gt; Retro Hugos have been awarded six times, for 1939, 1941, 1943, 1946, 1951, and 1954.&lt;ref name="LocusRetroHugoinfo"/&gt; Only the 1946 and 1951 Retro Hugos received enough nominations for the Fan Artist Hugo to make the ballot.&lt;ref name="Hugo39"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hugo54"/&gt;

It is a subsidiary of [[Ingram Industries]].&lt;ref name="urlIngram Industries - Company Description - Hoovers"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hoovers.com/ingram-industries/--ID__40233--/free-co-factsheet.xhtml |title=Ingram Industries - Company Description - Hoover's |work= |accessdate=2009-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company's daily activities are handled by Shawn Morin who serves as CEO.  [[John R. Ingram (businessman)|John R. Ingram]] serves as chairman of Ingram Content Group. He also serves as the Vice Chairman of [[Ingram Industries]].

The Ingram Content Group was formed in 2009 as Ingram Lightning Group merged with Ingram Digital Group. Ingram Content Group’s operating units are Ingram Book Company, Ingram International Inc., Ingram Library Services Inc., Ingram Publisher Services Inc., Ingram Periodicals Inc., Ingram Digital, Lightning Source Inc., Spring Arbor Distributors Inc., and Tennessee Book Company LLC.

During 1999 and 2000, Ingram Industries negotiated a sale to Barnes &amp; Noble which was ultimately withdrawn after pressure from [[independent bookstore]]s and the American Booksellers Association.

In June 2014, the company in conjunction with [[Hachette Book Group USA]], and [[Perseus Books Group]], announced a three-way deal whereby Hachette would buy Perseus and then sell that company's client services businesses to Ingram. Financial details of the deal were not disclosed.&lt;ref name="HachettePerseus"&gt;{{cite news|title=Perseus Books Group being acquired by Hachette|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/publisher-news/article/63029-hbg-buying-perseus-ingram-to-get-distribution-biz.html|accessdate=20 September 2014|publisher=''Publishers Weekly''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 4, 2016, John Ingram stepped down as CEO, being replaced by Shawn Morin.&lt;ref&gt;Shawn Morin Named CEO and President of Ingram Content Group Inc. http://www.ingramcontent.com/news/shawn-morin-named-ceo-and-president-of-ingram-content-group-inc&lt;/ref&gt;

==Services==
The company has the industry's largest active book inventory with access to 7.5 million titles. The markets they serve include booksellers, librarians, educators and specialty retailers. Ingram employs approximately 3,000 people worldwide.

Ingram Content Group is used heavily throughout the United States as a major distributor for independent book stores. Ingram has warehouses in Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and Indiana. They also operate a print on demand business under the [[Lightning Source]] brand with facilities in Tennessee, Pennsylvania, Ohio, California, United Kingdom, France and Australia. The company also provides full service distribution including sales and marketing services via its Ingram Publisher Services division.

In addition to print distribution, Ingram also provides digital content services and distribution through CoreSource, [https://www.vitalsource.com VitalSource], and MyiLibrary.

In 2015, Ingram purchased Aer.io which allows websites, in USA only, to sell books from the Ingram catalog.{{cn|date=August 2017}}

'''Iona''' ({{lang-gd|Ì Chaluim Chille}}, sometimes simply ''Ì'') is a small island in the [[Inner Hebrides]] off the [[Ross of Mull]] on the western coast of [[Scotland]]. It is mainly known for [[Iona Abbey]], though there are other buildings on the island. [[Iona Abbey]] was a centre of [[Hiberno-Scottish mission|Gaelic monasticism]] for three centuries&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt; and is today known for its relative tranquility and natural environment.&lt;ref&gt;Murray (1966) p 81&lt;/ref&gt; It is a tourist destination and a place for [[Retreat (spiritual)|spiritual retreats]]. Its modern [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]] name means "Iona of (Saint) [[Columba]]" (formerly anglicised "Icolmkill").

==Etymology==
The [[Hebrides]] have been occupied by the speakers of several languages since the [[Iron Age]], and as a result many of the names of these islands have more than one possible meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Haswell-Smith (2004) p. xiii&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless few, if any, can have accumulated so many different names over the centuries as the island now known in English as "Iona".

The earliest forms of the name enabled place-name scholar [[William J. Watson]] to show that the name originally meant something like "yew-place".&lt;ref&gt;Watson, ''Celtic Place-Names'', pp. 87&amp;ndash;90&lt;/ref&gt;  The element ''Ivo-'', denoting "[[Taxus baccata|yew]]", occurs in [[Ogham]] inscriptions (''Iva-cattos'' [genitive], ''Iva-geni'' [genitive]) and in Gaulish names (''Ivo-rix'', ''Ivo-magus'') and may form the basis of early Gaelic names like ''Eogan'' (ogham: ''Ivo-genos'').&lt;ref&gt;Watson, ''Celtic Place-Names'', pp. 87&amp;ndash;88.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="fn"&gt;The name of the Gaulish god ''Ivavos'' is of similar origin, associated with the healing-well of [[Évaux-les-Bains|Evaux]] in France.&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that the name is related to the mythological figure, ''Fer hÍ mac Eogabail'', foster-son of [[Manannan]], the forename meaning "man of the yew".&lt;ref&gt;Watson, ''Celtic Place-Names'', pp. 88&amp;ndash;89&lt;/ref&gt;

Mac an Tàilleir (2003) lists the more recent Gaelic names of ''Ì'',&lt;ref group="fn"&gt;For etymology of Ì and Latinised derivative ''Iona'', see Watson (2004), pp. 87&amp;ndash;90.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ì Chaluim Chille'' and ''Eilean Idhe'' noting that the first named is "generally lengthened to avoid confusion" to the second, which means "Calum's (i.e. in latinised form "Columba's") Iona" or "island of Calum's monastery".&lt;ref name=Mac&gt;Mac an Tàilleir (2003) p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=H-Smith&gt;Haswell-Smith (2004) p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; The possible confusion results from "ì", despite its original etymology, becoming a Gaelic noun (now obsolete) meaning simply "island".&lt;ref&gt;Dwelly (1911)&lt;/ref&gt; ''Eilean Idhe'' means "the isle of Iona", also known as ''Ì nam ban bòidheach'' ("the isle of beautiful women"). The modern English name comes of yet another variant, ''Ioua'',&lt;ref name=Mac/&gt;&lt;ref name=H-Smith/&gt; which was either just Adomnán's attempt to make the Gaelic name fit Latin grammar or else a genuine derivative from ''Ivova'' ("yew place").&lt;ref&gt;Watson, ''Celtic Place-Names'', p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ioua'''s change to ''Iona'', attested from c.1274,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Broderick|first=George|year=2013|title=Some island names in the former ‘Kingdom of the Isles’: a reappraisal |journal=Journal of Scottish Name Studies|volume=7|pages=1–28: 13, fn.30|url=http://www.clanntuirc.co.uk/JSNS/V7/JSNS7%20Broderick.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; results from a transcription mistake resulting from the similarity of "n" and "u" in [[Insular Minuscule]].&lt;ref&gt;Fraser (2009) p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the continuity of forms in Gaelic between the pre-Norse and post-Norse eras, Haswell-Smith (2004) speculates that the name may have a [[Old Norse|Norse]] connection, ''Hiōe'' meaning "island of the den of the brown bear",&lt;ref name=H-Smith/&gt; The medieval English language version was "Icolmkill" (and variants thereof).&lt;ref name=H-Smith/&gt;

===Folk etymology===
Murray (1966) claims that the "ancient" Gaelic name was ''Innis nan Druinich'' ("the isle of [[Druid]]ic hermits") and repeats a Gaelic story (which he admits is [[apocrypha]]l) that as Columba's coracle first drew close to the island one of his companions cried out ''"Chì mi i''" meaning "I see her" and that Columba's response was "Henceforth we shall call her Ì".&lt;ref name=Murray&gt;Murray (1966) p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

Iona's highest point is Dùn Ì, {{convert|101|m|ft}}, an Iron Age hill fort dating from 100 BC &amp;ndash; AD 200.

The main settlement, located at St. Ronan's Bay on the eastern side of the island, is called ''Baile Mòr'' and is also known locally as "The Village".

==History==

===Dál Riata===
[[File:KellsFol292rIncipJohn.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The [[Book of Kells]] - Gospel of John]]
In the early Historic Period Iona lay within the Gaelic kingdom of [[Dál Riata]], in the region controlled by the [[Cenél Loairn]] (i.e. [[Lorne, Scotland|Lorn]], as it was then). The island was the site of a highly important [[monastery]] (see [[Iona Abbey]]) during the [[Early Middle Ages]]. According to tradition the monastery was founded in 563 by the monk [[Columba]], also known as Colm Cille, who had been exiled from his native [[Ireland]] as a result of his involvement in the [[Battle of Cúl Dreimhne|Battle of Cul Dreimhne]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Adomnan of Iona|Admonan]] ''The Life of St. Columba, Founder of Hy'' ed. [[William Reeves (bishop)|William Reeves]] (1857) University Press for the Irish Archaeological and Celtic Society. pp. 248-50.&lt;/ref&gt; Columba and twelve companions went into exile on Iona and founded a monastery there. The monastery was hugely successful, and played a crucial role in the conversion to Christianity of the [[Picts]] of present-day [[Scotland]] in the late 6th century and of the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] kingdom of [[Northumbria]] in 635. Many satellite institutions were founded, and Iona became the centre of one of the most important [[Hiberno-Scottish mission|monastic systems]] in Great Britain and Ireland.&lt;ref name=Koch&gt;Koch, pp. 657–658.&lt;/ref&gt;

Iona became a renowned centre of learning, and its [[scriptorium]] produced highly important documents, probably including the original texts of the Iona Chronicle, thought to be the source for the early [[Irish annals]].&lt;ref name=Koch/&gt; The monastery is often associated with the distinctive practices and traditions known as [[Celtic Christianity]]. In particular, Iona was a major supporter of the "Celtic" system for [[Celtic Christianity#Easter calculation|calculating the date of Easter]] at the time of the [[Easter controversy]], which pitted supporters of the Celtic system against those favoring the "Roman" system used elsewhere in Western Christianity. The controversy weakened Iona's ties to Northumbria, which adopted the Roman system at the [[Synod of Whitby]] in 664, and to Pictland, which followed suit in the early 8th century. Iona itself did not adopt the Roman system until 715, according to the Anglo-Saxon historian [[Bede]]. Iona's prominence was further diminished over the next centuries as a result of [[Viking]] raids and the rise of other powerful monasteries in the system, such as the [[Abbey of Kells]].&lt;ref name=Koch/&gt;

The [[Book of Kells]] may have been produced or begun on Iona towards the end of the 8th century.&lt;ref name=Koch/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Forbes, Andrew ; Henley, David (2012). ''Pages from the Book of Kells''. Chiang Mai: Cognoscenti Books. ASIN: B00AN4JVI0&lt;/ref&gt; Around this time the island's exemplary [[high cross]]es were sculpted; these may be the first such crosses to contain the ring around the intersection that became characteristic of the "[[Celtic cross]]".&lt;ref name=Koch/&gt; The series of Viking raids on Iona began in 794 and, after its treasures had been plundered many times, Columba's relics were removed and divided two ways between Scotland and Ireland in 849 as the monastery was abandoned.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/scottishhistory/earlychurch/trails_earlychurch_iona2.shtml BBC - Iona - A Beacon of Light Through the Dark Ages]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kingdom of the Isles===
As the Norse domination of the west coast of Scotland advanced, Iona became part of the [[Kingdom of the Isles]]. The Norse  ''Rex plurimarum insularum'' [[Amlaíb Cuarán]] died in 980 or 981 whilst in "religious retirement" on Iona.&lt;ref name=OC11&gt;Ó Corráin (1998) p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gregory (1881) pp. 4–6&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless the island was sacked twice by his successors, on Christmas night 986 and again in 987.&lt;ref&gt;Woolf (2007) pp. 217–18&lt;/ref&gt; Although Iona was never again important to Ireland, it rose to prominence once more in Scotland following the establishment of the [[Kingdom of Scotland]] in the later 9th century; the ruling dynasty of Scotland traced its origin to Iona, and the island thus became an important spiritual centre for the new kingdom, with many of its early kings buried there&lt;ref name=Koch/&gt;. However, a campaign by [[Magnus Barelegs]] led to the formal acknowledgement of Norwegian control of Argyll, in 1098.

[[Somerled]], the brother-in-law of Norway's governor of the region (the ''King of the Isles''), launched a revolt, and made the kingdom independent. A [[convent]] for [[Benedictine]] nuns was established in about 1208, with [[Bethóc, Prioress of Iona|Bethóc]], Somerled's daughter, as first prioress. The present Benedictine [[abbey]], [[Iona Abbey]], was built in about 1203. 

On Somerled's death, nominal Norwegian overlordship of the Kingdom was re-established, but de facto control was split between Somerled's sons, and his brother-in-law.

===Kingdom of Scotland===

Following the 1266 [[Treaty of Perth]] the Hebrides were transferred from Norwegian to Scottish overlordship.&lt;ref&gt;Hunter (2000) pp. 110–111&lt;/ref&gt;. At the end of the century, king [[John Balliol]] was challenged for the throne by [[Robert I of Scotland|Robert de Bruys]] Robert The Bruce. By this point, Somerled's descendants had split into three groups, the [[Clann Ruaidhrí|MacRory]], [[Clan MacDougall|MacDougalls]], and [[Clan Donald|MacDonalds]]. The MacDougalls backed Balliol, so when he was defeated by de Bruys, the latter exiled the MacDougalls and transferred their island territories to the MacDonalds; by marrying the [[Amy of Garmoran|heir of the MacRory]]s, [[John of Islay, Lord of the Isles|the heir of the MacDonalds]] re-unified most of Somerled's realm, creating the [[Lordship of the Isles]], under nominal Scottish authority. Iona, which had been a MacDougall territory (together with the rest of Lorn), was given to the [[Clan Campbell|Campbells]], where it remained for half a century.

In 1354, though in exile and without control of his ancestral lands, [[John Gallda MacDougall|John, the MacDougall heir]], quitclaimed any rights he had over Mull and Iona to the Lord of the Isles (though this had no meaningful effect at the time). When Robert's son, [[David II, King of Scotland]], became king, he spent some time in English captivity; following his release, in 1357, he restored MacDougall authority over Lorn. The 1354 quitclaim, which seems to have been an attempt to ensure peace in just such an eventuality, took automatic effect, splitting Mull and Iona from Lorn, and making it subject to the Lordship of the Isles. Iona remained part of the Lordship of the Isles for the next century and a half.

Following the 1491 [[Raid on Ross]], the Lordship of the Isles was dismantled, and Scotland gained full control of Iona for the second time. The monastery and nunnery continued to be active until the [[Scottish Reformation|Reformation]], when buildings were demolished and all but three of the 360 carved crosses destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotland.org.uk/guide/Isle_of_Iona Travel Scotland]&lt;/ref&gt;. The Augustine nunnery now only survives as a number of 13th century ruins, including a church and cloister. By the 1760s little more of the nunnery remained standing than at present, though it is the most complete remnant of a medieval nunnery in Scotland.

===Post-Union===

After a visit in 1773, the English writer [[Samuel Johnson]] remarked:

:The island, which was once the metropolis of learning and piety, now has no school for education, nor temple for worship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/2064 ''A Journey to the Western Islands of Scotland''], Project Gutenberg.&lt;/ref&gt;

He estimated the population of the village at 70 families or perhaps 350 inhabitants.

In the 19th century green-streaked marble was commercially mined in the south-east of Iona; the quarry and machinery survive, see 'Marble Quarry remains' below.&lt;ref&gt;Industrial Archaeology review, Vol I Number 1 Autumn 1976 ''The Marble Quarry, Iona, Inner Hebrides'', D. J. Viner. Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iona Abbey==
{{main|Iona Abbey}}
[[File:Iona Abbey. Panorama.jpg|thumb|center|750px|Panoramic view]]
[[File:Iona.showing.monasteries.jpg|thumb|Enlargement, showing the location of the abbey and monasteries.]]
Iona Abbey, now an [[ecumenical]] church, is of particular historical and religious interest to pilgrims and visitors alike. It is the most elaborate and best-preserved ecclesiastical building surviving from the Middle Ages in the [[Western Isles]] of [[Scotland]].  Though modest in scale in comparison to medieval abbeys elsewhere in [[Western Europe]], it has a wealth of fine architectural detail, and monuments of many periods. The [[8th Duke of Argyll]] presented the sacred buildings and sites of the island to the Iona Cathedral trust in 1899.&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt;

In front of the Abbey stands the 9th century St Martin's Cross, one of the best-preserved Celtic crosses in the [[British Isles]], and a replica of the 8th century St John's Cross (original fragments in the Abbey museum).

The ancient burial ground, called the Rèilig Odhrain (Eng: Oran's "burial place" or "cemetery"), contains the 12th century chapel of [[Saint Otteran|St Odhrán]] (said to be [[Columba]]'s uncle), restored at the same time as the Abbey itself. It contains a number of medieval grave monuments. The abbey graveyard contains the graves of many early [[Scotland/Monarchs|Scottish Kings]], as well as Norse kings from Ireland and Norway. Iona became the burial site for the kings of [[Dál Riata]] and their successors. Notable burials there include:
*[[Cináed mac Ailpín]], king of the Picts (also known today as "Kenneth I of Scotland")
*[[Domnall mac Causantín]], alternatively "king of the Picts" or "king of Scotland"
*[[Máel Coluim mac Domnaill]], king of Scotland ("Malcolm I")
*[[Donnchad mac Crínáin]], king of Scotland ("Duncan I")
*[[Mac Bethad mac Findlaích]], king of Scotland ("Macbeth")
*[[Domnall mac Donnchada]], king of Scotland ("Domnall Bán" or "Donald III")
*[[John Smith (Labour Party leader)|John Smith]], Labour Party Leader

In 1549 an inventory of 48 Scottish, 8 Norwegian and 4 Irish kings was recorded. None of these graves are now identifiable (their inscriptions were reported to have worn away at the end of the 17th century). Saint [[Baithin]] and Saint [[Fáilbe mac Pípáin|Failbhe]] may also be buried on the island. The Abbey graveyard is also the final resting place of [[John Smith (Labour Party leader)|John Smith]], the former Labour Party leader, who loved Iona. His grave is marked with an epitaph quoting [[Alexander Pope]]: "An honest man's the noblest work of God".&lt;ref name=rowe&gt;[http://travel.independent.co.uk/uk/article625010.ece ''Walk Of The Month: The island of Iona''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071022054221/http://travel.independent.co.uk/uk/article625010.ece |date=22 October 2007 }} ''[[The Independent]]'' 4 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Other early Christian and medieval monuments have been removed for preservation to the cloister arcade of the Abbey, and the Abbey museum (in the medieval infirmary). The ancient buildings of Iona Abbey are now cared for by [[Historic Scotland]] (entrance charge).

==Marble Quarry remains==
The remains of a marble quarrying enterprise can be seen in a small bay on the south-east shore of Iona.&lt;ref&gt;https://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Iona_marble_quarry#/media/File%3AIona_Marble_Quarry_-_geograph.org.uk_-_380937.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scottish-places.info/features/featurefirst91934.html&lt;/ref&gt; The quarry is the source of ‘Iona Marble’, a beautiful translucent green and white stone, much used in brooches and other jewellery.[http://www.alexander-ritchie.co.uk/marble.htm] The stone has been known of for centuries and was credited with healing and other powers. While the quarry had been used in a small way, it was not until around the end of the C18 when it was opened up on a more industrial scale by the Duke of Argyle. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=MacArthur, E Mairi, Iona, Colin Baxter Island Guide (1997) Colin Baxter Photography, Grantown-on-Spey, see Chapter 10, 128pp.|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;The then difficulties of extracting the hard stone and transporting it meant that the scheme was short lived. Another attempt was started in 1907, this time more successful with considerable quantities of stone extracted and indeed exported, but the First World War put paid to this as well, with little quarrying after 1914 and the operation finally closing in 1919. An excellent painting on the [https://artuk.org/discover/artworks/the-marble-quarry-iona-23417/view_as/grid/search/keyword:the-marble-quarry-cameron/page/1# ArtUK] website, ''The Marble Quarry, Iona'' (1909) by Sir D Y Cameron shows the quarry in operation. Such is the site’s rarity that it has been designated as a Scheduled Ancient Monument.[http://portal.historicenvironment.scot/designation/SM5255]

==Present day==
The island, other than the land owned by the Iona Cathedral Trust, was purchased from the Duke of Argyll by [[Sir Hugh Fraser, 2nd Baronet|Hugh Fraser]] in 1979 and donated to the [[National Trust for Scotland]].&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt; In 2001 Iona's population was 125&lt;ref&gt;{{GRO10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by the time of the [[United Kingdom Census 2011|2011 census]] this had grown to 177 usual residents.&lt;ref name=NRS/&gt; During the same period [[List of Scottish islands|Scottish island]] populations as a whole grew by 4% to 103,702.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-23711202 "Scotland's 2011 census: Island living on the rise"]. BBC News. Retrieved 18 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iona Community===
{{main|Iona Community}}
[[File:Iona Village from seawards.jpg|thumb|right|Baile Mòr viewed from the Sound of Iona]]
In 1938 [[George MacLeod]] founded the Iona Community, an ecumenical Christian community of men and women from different walks of life and different traditions in the Christian church committed to seeking new ways of living the [[Gospel]] of [[Jesus]] in today's world. This community is a leading force in the present [[Celtic Christian]] revival.

The Iona Community runs 3 residential centres on the Isle of Iona and on [[Isle of Mull|Mull]], where one can live together in community with people of every background from all over the world. Weeks at the centres often follow a programme related to the concerns of the Iona Community.

The 8 tonne ''Fallen Christ'' sculpture by [[Ronald Rae]] was permanently situated outside the MacLeod Centre in February 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iona.org.uk/news.php?id=44 |title=The Fallen Christ on Iona |publisher=iona.org.uk |accessdate=8 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080609065637/http://www.iona.org.uk/news.php?id=44 |archivedate=9 June 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transport===
Visitors can reach Iona by the 10-minute ferry trip across the [[Sound of Iona]] from [[Fionnphort]] on [[Isle of Mull|Mull]]. The most common route is via [[Oban]] in [[Argyll and Bute]]. Regular ferries connect to [[Craignure]] on Mull, from where the scenic road runs {{convert|37|mi|abbr=off}} to Fionnphort. Tourist coaches and local bus services meet the ferries.

There are very few cars on the island, as they are tightly regulated and vehicular access is not allowed for non-residents, who have to leave their car in Fionnphort. Bike hire is available at the pier, and on Mull.

===Accommodation===
In addition to the hotels, there are several [[bed and breakfast]]s on Iona and various self-catering properties. The Iona Hostel at Lagandorain and the Iona campsite at Cnoc Oran also offer accommodation.

== Iona in Scottish Painting ==
The island of Iona has played an important role in Scottish landscape painting, especially during the Twentieth Century. As travel to north and west Scotland became easier from the mid C18 on, artists’ visits to the island steadily increased. The Abbey remains in particular became frequently recorded during this early period. Many of the artists are listed and illustrated in the valuable book, ''‘Iona Portrayed – The Island through Artists’ Eyes 1760-1960’'', &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Christian, Jessica &amp; Stiller, Charles (2000), Iona Portrayed – The Island through Artists’ Eyes 1760-1960,  The New Iona Press, Inverness, 96pp, numerous illustrations in B&amp;W and colour, with list of artists.|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which lists over 170 artists known to have painted on the island.

The C20 however saw the greatest period of influence on landscape painting, in particular through the many paintings of the island produced by [[F C B Cadell]] and [[S J Peploe]], two of the ‘[[Scottish Colourists]]’. As with many artists, both professional and amateur, they were attracted by the unique quality of light, the white sandy beaches, the aquamarine colours of the sea and the landscape of rich greens and rocky outcrops. While Cadell and Peploe are perhaps best known, many major Scottish painters of the C20 worked on Iona and visited many times – for example [[George Houston (artist)|George Houston]], [[David Young Cameron|D Y Cameron]], James Shearer, John Duncan and John Maclauchlan Milne, among many.

==Media and the arts==
[[Samuel Johnson]] wrote "That man is little to be envied whose patriotism would not gain force upon the [[Battle of Marathon|plains of Marathon]], or whose piety would not grow warmer amid the ruins of Iona."&lt;ref&gt;Johnson (1775) p. 217&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Jules Verne]]'s novel ''[[The Green Ray]]'', the heroes visit Iona in chapters 13 to 16. The inspiration is romantic, the ruins of the island are conducive to daydreaming. The young heroine, Helena Campbell, argues that Scotland in general and Iona in particular are the scene of the appearance of goblins and other familiar demons.

In [[Jean Raspail]]'s novel ''The Fisherman's Ring'' (1995), his cardinal is one of the last to support the antipope [[Antipope Benedict XIII|Benedict XIII]] and his successors.

In the novel ''The Carved Stone'' (by Guillaume Prévost), the young Samuel Faulkner is projected in time as he searches for his father and lands on Iona in the year 800, then threatened by the Vikings.

"Peace of Iona" is a song written by [[Mike Scott (musician)|Mike Scott]] that appears on the studio album ''[[Universal Hall]]'' and on the live recording ''[[Karma to Burn (The Waterboys album)|Karma to Burn]]'' by [[The Waterboys]]. Iona is the setting for the song "Oran" on the 1997 [[Steve McDonald (Celtic music)|Steve McDonald]] album ''Stone of Destiny''.

Kenneth C. Steven published an anthology of poetry entitled ''Iona: Poems'' in 2000 inspired by his association with the island and the surrounding area.

Iona is featured prominently in the first episode ("By the Skin of Our Teeth") of the celebrated arts series ''[[Civilisation: A Personal View by Kenneth Clark]]'' (1969).

Iona is the setting of Jeanne M. Dams' Dorothy Martin mystery ''Holy Terror of the Hebrides'' (1998).

The [[Academy Award]]–nominated Irish animated film ''[[The Secret of Kells]]'' is about the creation of the [[Book of Kells]]. One of the characters, Brother Aiden, is a master [[Limner|illuminator]] from Iona Abbey who had helped to illustrate the Book, but had to escape the island with it during a Viking invasion.

After his death in 2011, the cremated remains of songwriter/recording artist [[Gerry Rafferty]] were scattered on Iona.&lt;ref name="Scotsman1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/scotland/Gerry-Rafferty-went-to-meet.6698811.jp?articlepage=2 |title='Gerry Rafferty went to meet his maker sober and unafraid, curious and brave' |publisher=thescotsman.scotsman.com |accessdate=29 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Frances Macdonald]] the contemporary Scottish artist based in Crinian, Argyll, regularly paints landscapes on Iona.

[[Iona Abbey]] is mentioned in [[Tori Amos]]'s "Twinkle" from her 1996 album ''[[Boys for Pele]]'':
"And last time I knew, she worked at an abbey in Iona. She said 'I killed a man, T, I've gotta stay hidden in this abbey' "

[[Iona_(band)|Iona]] is the name of a progressive [[Celtic rock]] band (first album released in 1990; not active at present), many of whose songs are inspired by the island of Iona and Columba's life.

==Storylines==

===2004–2012===
Jane comes to [[Walford]] with a funfair, working the candyfloss stall. She argues with [[Ian Beale]] ([[Adam Woodyatt]]) but helps out when the funfair collapses. She moves to the Square and becomes friends with Ian. She reveals that her husband, [[David Collins (EastEnders)|David Collins]] ([[Dan Milne]]), is in a hospice with [[Huntington's disease]]. After he dies, Jane and Ian start dating and she moves in with him and his children, [[Lucy Beale|Lucy]] ([[Melissa Suffield]]/[[Hetti Bywater]]), [[Peter Beale|Peter]] ([[Thomas Law]]), and [[Bobby Beale (EastEnders)|Bobby]] (Alex Francis). When Jane and [[Grant Mitchell (EastEnders)|Grant Mitchell]] ([[Ross Kemp]]) intervene in a feud between Ian and Grant's brother [[Phil Mitchell]] ([[Steve McFadden]]), they end up kissing. Jane tells Grant she is not in love with him.&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/scotland/article726662.ece?token=null&amp;offset=12&amp;page=2|title=Well, would you just Adam and Eve it?|last=Brown|first=Allan|date=28 May 2006|publisher=The Sunday Times|accessdate=11 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After an argument with Ian, she has sex with Grant but stays with Ian, and Grant leaves Walford. Phil tells Ian about the affair so Ian proposes to Jane, quietly planning to humiliate her at the wedding. Jane learns this on their wedding day and disappears. Ian finds her and they fight but realise they love each other and want to be together. They marry in secret.

Ian's stepson [[Steven Beale]] ([[Aaron Sidwell]]), who has been living overseas, returns to Walford and takes Ian hostage, locking him in a flat. The family eventually learn where Ian is and try to rescue him, but Jane is shot in the process. She and Ian agree to have a baby when she recovers but Jane needs an emergency [[hysterectomy]], leaving them devastated. Jane starts going to a stand-up comedy club, telling Ian that she is going to the gym. However, he knows she is lying so [[Tamwar Masood]] ([[Himesh Patel]]) takes him to the club where she is onstage. Amused initially, he is hurt by her jokes about him and their sex life. He gives her an ultimatum: give up her hobby or end their marriage. After she is accepted by a talent scout, she's shocked when Ian insists on being her agent. His interfering takes the fun out of her comedy career so she ends it.

After Ian invests in Masala Masood, the curry business run by [[Masood Ahmed]] ([[Nitin Ganatra]]) and his wife [[Zainab Masood]] ([[Nina Wadia]]), the Masoods and Beales go into business together, and Jane has a flirtatious relationship with Masood. When Ian refuses to consider the possibility of adopting a child, Jane turns to Masood for comfort and they kiss. Ian changes his mind but she knows it's only for her sake and leaves Walford, refusing to come home when Ian finds her and only returning when Bobby goes missing. Jane discovers her brother, [[Christian Clarke]] ([[John Partridge (actor)|John Partridge]]), is having an affair with Masood's son, [[Syed Masood]] ([[Marc Elliott]]), while acting as Syed's wedding planner. Zainab discovers this, and blames Jane for Christian coming to Walford. When Zainab hears Tamwar playing an audio recording of Ian having sex with [[Janine Butcher]] ([[Charlie Brooks]]), she plays it to Jane. Ian explains that Janine was blackmailing him and admits he stole [[Archie Mitchell]]'s ([[Larry Lamb]]) laptop on the day he was murdered to retrieve the recording. Ian is arrested when Janine implicates Ian in Archie's death, but the charges are dropped. This damages Jane's chances of adopting.

Jane learns that Lucy is pregnant and suggests Lucy consider an abortion but Lucy wants Jane and Ian to adopt the baby. Jane agrees but Ian refuses and blames Jane for taking advantage of Lucy. Ian convinces Lucy to have an abortion and arranges it, then tells Jane that Lucy has miscarried. Fearing that Jane will learn the truth, Ian persuades her to visit her mother, [[Linda Clarke]] ([[Lynda Baron]]), in Florida. Jane is suspicious but Lucy convinces her to go. That night, Masood reminds her of their kiss and asks if he can go with her, but she goes alone as Masood stays in Walford after Syed attempts suicide. When Jane returns, the family learn that there are inconsistencies in Lucy and Peter's exam results and the papers will be investigated. Lucy denies cheating but later admits that she did. When Jane tells Lucy's friend [[Zsa Zsa Carter]] ([[Emer Kenny]]) that she is upset about Lucy's lies, Zsa Zsa assumes Jane is talking about the abortion and tells her about it. Jane asks Lucy to promise her that she is not hiding anything else and she does, but Jane learns that Ian knew about the abortion and that Lucy planned to cheat on her exam, so she decides to leave once she has what she feels she is owed. She opens another bank account and plans to transfer funds secretly before leaving, telling Ian that she no longer wants to adopt, but Ian suggests that she adopt Bobby and she agrees, as she can fight for access to him. Jane tells Christian about the abortion and he urges her to leave Ian, offering to help.

[[Kim Fox]] ([[Tameka Empson]]) brings Ian a letter from the bank about Jane's secret account. He asks Jane about it and she says she's been saving for a holiday and then has to book one, but suspicious Ian watches her every move. Jane discovers that Ian plans to buy the local Indian restaurant, the Argee Bhajee, without consulting her. Jane angrily tells friends that she no longer loves Ian, unaware that he has overheard. Ian attempts to woo Jane by cooking for her and offering the Argee Bhajee after her, admitting that he overheard what she said at Zainab's house. Jane then reveals that she knows about Lucy's abortion and is sick of his lies. She meets Masood and the pair console each other about their respective partners. They go to a hotel to have sex, but change their minds and decide to remain friends. When Jane returns home, she confesses to Ian and they reconcile.

Ian asks Jane to renew their wedding vows and she agrees. Days later, Ian admits to having sex with [[Glenda Mitchell]] ([[Glynis Barber]]). He hopes she can forgive him but she cannot; they end their relationship but continue to live together, with Ian determined to win her back. She is horrified when [[Greg Jessop]] ([[Stefan Booth]]) asks Ian to be best man at his wedding to Jane's best friend [[Tanya Branning]] ([[Jo Joyner]]). During Tanya's hen night, Jane and Tanya get drunk and Tanya accuses Jane of being jealous, so Jane refuses to be Tanya's matron of honour. Returning home, Jane finds Greg bringing Ian home and she goes to kiss Greg, who pushes her away. Filled with guilt, Jane admits what she did to Tanya and they reconcile. Jane and Ian's relationship deteriorates when she meets a man named [[Martin (EastEnders)|Martin]] (Alasdair Harvey) at a pub quiz. They have a brief affair; she ends it, but Ian tries to make Jane jealous by hiring an escort named [[List of EastEnders characters (2011)#Jeanette|Jeanette]] (Georgia Reece). Jane learns that she is an escort and mocks Ian; he calls Jane a prostitute disguised as a wife. She then vows to take everything she can in their divorce. Jane tells Masood she is in love with him and asks him to leave Zainab, but he refuses, telling her he loves her but does not want a divorce. Jane wins the café in her divorce from Ian. Bobby is upset by their arguments, and Jane realises she must leave Walford for his sake, so there are no more arguments. She promises to see Bobby regularly, and leaves after removing her wedding ring. Ian and Jane's divorce is later finalised.

When Jane returns six months later after Bobby visits her, she's shocked to learn that Ian is engaged to [[Mandy Salter]] ([[Nicola Stapleton]]) and that Masood and Zainab have split. Masood tells Jane that he cannot just be friends with her and they begin a romantic relationship. Masood and Jane go to dinner at Ian and Mandy's house and Ian asks how their relationship can develop if Jane is not a Muslim, so she tells Ian that she will convert, surprising Masood. Masood says she need not convert, so she is relieved. She sees Masood kissing Zainab and tells Zainab's new partner [[Yusef Khan]] ([[Ace Bhatti]]), and her relationship with Masood ends, though they stay friends. As Tanya has cancer, Jane helps organise a function to raise money for cancer charities. At the event, Jane's former cuisine tutor [[Gethin Williams]] ([[Bradley Freegard]]) arrives. He is impressed with Jane's catering and asks her to interview for a job at his new restaurant. Jane is reluctant but Tanya sets it up regardless, telling Jane the next day and persuades her to go. She is offered the job, but it is in Cardiff, about 150 miles away. She accepts the job but Tanya assumes she has decided to stay in Walford and is horrified when Masood reveals the truth. Tanya is upset and says that Jane is no longer her friend. Jane is tempted to stay when Ian tells her that his half-brother [[Ben Mitchell (EastEnders)|Ben Mitchell]] ([[Joshua Pascoe]]) needs her but Christian convinces her to go, telling her not to give up on her dreams. As she and Christian are leaving, Tanya runs out of her house, and the two reconcile. She leaves and joyfully exclaims that she can now be whoever she wants.

===2014–2017===
Worried about Ian's behaviour, Peter (now [[Ben Hardy (actor)|Ben Hardy]]) calls Jane. She arrives at their house just as Ian is about to propose to his current girlfriend, Jane's friend [[Denise Fox]] ([[Diane Parish]]).&lt;ref name="6jan14"&gt;{{Cite episode |title= Episode dated 06/01/2014 |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03pcmy2 |series= EastEnders |serieslink=EastEnders |credits= Executive Producer: [[Dominic Treadwell-Collins]]; Director: Rebecca Gatward; Writer: Colin Wyatt |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One]] |airdate= 6 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ian is shocked and Jane and Denise feel awkward with each other. Ian and Jane have a heart-to-heart and Ian breaks down, saying that the pressure of his life is overwhelming. She encourages him to stay strong and advises Peter to talk to Denise about it.&lt;ref name="7jan14"&gt;{{Cite episode |title= Episode dated 07/01/2014 |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03pcnvl |series= EastEnders |serieslink=EastEnders |credits= Executive Producer: [[Dominic Treadwell-Collins]]; Director: Rebecca Gatward; Writer: Colin Wyatt |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One]] |airdate= 7 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next month Jane returns to watch Bobby compete in a school spelling competition, lodges with Masood, and agrees to buy into Ian's restaurant. Misinterpreting her actions, Masood kisses Jane, but she rebuffs him. Bonding with Jane over past experiences, Ian kisses her, but she flees the house in humiliation, then is further appalled when [[Max Branning]] ([[Jake Wood]]) tries to seduce her. Jane makes clear to Ian that they are only friends but agrees to keep the truth from Denise. Masood's daughter [[Shabnam Masood]] ([[Rakhee Thakrar]]) dislikes Jane and Masood's closeness and plots to push Jane closer to Ian, but Denise is trying to push Jane and Masood closer together, and they eventually become a couple.

Jane is devastated when Lucy is murdered (see [[Who Killed Lucy Beale?]]). Jane and Ian grieve together and have sex. This makes Ian hope they will reunite, but Jane immediately regrets it. When she tells Ian it was a mistake, he takes his anger out on Bobby (now Rory Stroud), and Jane breaks up with Masood and leaves with Bobby so Ian can grieve properly. Jane and Bobby stay with Christian, return for Lucy's funeral, and leave again when Jane realises that Ian needs more time alone.

Jane returns in November with the news that Bobby (now Eliot Carrington) is missing. Masood finds him asleep on Walford Common near where Lucy's body was found. When he is returned home it is apparent that he has been trying to solve the murder and wants to live in Walford. Jane agrees that Bobby needs his father and finds them a flat. Denise digs up Lucy's missing purse and phone in Patrick's allotment and Jane convinces Ian not to hand them in to the police. Denise is angry when she finds out Ian had sex with Jane the day after Lucy's death. Jane reunites Ian and Peter when they fall out after Ian discovers that Peter was sourcing Lucy's drugs for her, and later she decides to stay at the Beale house. She takes Lucy's phone and purse and hides them under a loose floorboard without telling Ian.

Jane kisses Ian and regrets it, but later realises she loves him and they kiss again under the mistletoe. Jane does not want everyone to know about their relationship, but [[Alfie Moon]] ([[Shane Richie]]) has already found out and the news quickly spreads across the Square. When Jane finds out, she tells Ian that their relationship will not work, but after a discussion with Alfie, she changes her mind and proposes to Ian, who accepts. They plan their wedding for February. Jane is upset when her parents decline her invitation, disapproving of her remarrying Ian, but [[Sonia Fowler]] ([[Natalie Cassidy]]) supports her and she makes her matron of honour. On the day of the wedding, Jane receives a card from Lauren, revealing she knows that Lucy was killed at home. Visibly disturbed, she flees her wedding reception and is confronted by Peter, who also has discovered that Lucy died in the house. Ian realises Jane is lying and accuses her of killing Lucy; initially, she confesses, but Ian sees through her and realises Bobby is the real culprit. Jane covered for Bobby by taking Lucy's body and putting it in the common, then convinced Bobby that he didn't kill his sister; that is why they left Walford soon after the murder. Ian forgives Jane and, with the twins' maternal half-sister [[Cindy Williams (EastEnders)|Cindy Williams]] ([[Mimi Keene]]), they agree that Bobby can never find out. Jane is devastated when Cindy stops her and Ian adopting Beth.

The Beales discover the police have a new suspect for Lucy's murder: Ben (now [[Harry Reid (actor)|Harry Reid]]). Jane brings Lucy's effects up from under the floorboards, telling Ian she kept them as security, and she is seemingly happy to allow Ben to take the blame. Ian tells her to put the items back; she does so but they go missing, as Bobby has overheard the conversation, and he takes them to the police station. Phil prevents Bobby from turning in the evidence but it is clear that Jane is not coping, as she begins to behave erratically, suggests that the Beales flee Walford and ultimately confesses the truth to family friend [[Sharon Mitchell (EastEnders)|Sharon Mitchell]] ([[Letitia Dean]]), who has found out after watching Cindy's video message meant for Bobby. Ian pleads with Sharon and she agrees not to tell the truth. Max is arrested and charged for Lucy's murder, leaving Jane racked with guilt. Ian and Bobby leave Walford on the eve of Max's trial, without telling Jane, who is distraught. Seeing Sharon comforting Jane, [[Phil Mitchell]] ([[Steve McFadden]]) works out that Jane knows Max is innocent, and confronts her. She admits she is covering for Bobby, and he decides to keep quiet, as Jane promises that she will keep Ben well out of this. She meets with Max's lawyer [[Marcus Christie]] ([[Stephen Churchett]]) and together they fabricate an alibi for Max on the night Lucy was killed, as she claims she had sex with him after turning to him for advice about Lucy. However, both the prosecution and her neighbours, including Max's sister [[Carol Jackson]] ([[Lindsey Coulson]]), are sceptical of her story.

When Max is convicted of the murder, the Beales struggle to move on and Ian attempts to commit suicide. Jane stops him in time but both are stunned when Ian's mother [[Kathy Beale|Kathy Sullivan]] ([[Gillian Taylforth]]) turns up in Walford after being believed to be dead for ten years.&lt;ref name="6oct15"&gt;{{Cite episode |title= Episode dated 06/10/2015 |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b06h1fps |series= EastEnders |serieslink=EastEnders |credits= Executive Producer: [[Dominic Treadwell-Collins]]; Director: Michael Owen Morris; Writer: Pete Lawson |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One]] |airdate= 6 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Jane grows close to Kathy, but is furious when Ian tells her that Bobby killed Lucy. Ian and Jane decide to move Bobby into Lucy's old bedroom, and Kathy into Bobby's, which infuriates him, especially when the rooms are swapped without his knowledge. Jane catches Bobby trying swap them back, and a physical scuffle ensues, which results in Bobby pushing Jane down the stairs. Jane tells Kathy that she slipped, but Bobby tells Kathy the truth, and Kathy asks Jane to think about Bobby's anger management problems. Jane refuses to admit he needs help, until he smashes a plate in the café when she refuses to get him a new bicycle for Christmas, so tells Kathy that she thinks there is something wrong with him.&lt;ref name="8dec15"&gt;{{Cite episode |title= Episode dated 08/12/2015 |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b06s199y |series= EastEnders |serieslink=EastEnders |credits= Executive Producer: [[Dominic Treadwell-Collins]]; Director: John Howlett; Writer: Katie Douglas |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One]] |airdate= 8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ian decides sending Bobby to an expensive boarding school will solve Bobby's anger problems. Ian decides to sell his restaurant to pay for it, but there are protests when he decides to sell to a supermarket chain, causing Ian to change his mind.

In the ambulance, Jane enters critical condition when her spinal injury restricts her ability to breathe, requiring anaesthetics and spinal surgeons upon arrival at the hospital. While she remains in a coma at the hospital, consultants advise her brother Christian and mother Linda upon their arrival that Jane may never walk again. She wakes up, and initially struggles to speak and has lost most of the feeling in her hands and feet. Jane tells Linda that everything that has happened is her own fault, and, after discovering that Bobby has been charged with killing Lucy and Steven has returned, she tells Ian that she is the reason he has lost his family and tells him their relationship is over as the Beale family is better off without her. However, Ian manages to convince her otherwise. Jane decides to continue her recovery at home, and Ian has the downstairs of the house refurbished to aid this. Jane begins to recover but feels isolated.

When Grant returns briefly, Jane feels normal when at first he does not realise she is paralysed. She sees an incomplete online credit card application in Lucy's name and confronts Steven; he realises it was Ian and admits to it though later Ian admits the truth to Jane. Jane grows frustrated when Ian avoids spending time with her, so she tells Ian that she wants to be a normal couple again and wants to visit Bobby but Ian says Bobby does not want any visitors. When Lauren gives Jane a makeover, Ian compliments her. She starts to leave the house in her wheelchair and Jane has a good day with friends until she suffers incontinence and is humiliated; at home, Ian leaves the room when Jane asks him to sit with her.&lt;ref name="3oct16"&gt;{{Cite episode |title= Episode dated 03/10/2016 |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07yjstp |series=EastEnders |serieslink=EastEnders |credits= Executive Producer: [[Sean O'Connor (producer)|Sean O'Connor]]; Director: David Moor; Writer: Lauren Klee |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One]] |airdate= 3 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jane thinks Steven is making excuses not to let her use the restaurant's laptop. Sharon has an idea so Jane can answer the telephone at the restaurant but Steven asks Jane to work in the kitchen as the restaurant is getting busy so Jane accuses him of not wanting a wheelchair in the restaurant which he denies, but Jane leaves. When Jane's paralysis improves that she is able to use a laptop properly, Lauren and Steven come up with a plan to distract her from looking at the restaurant's accounts. When she finally sees them, she realises payments are being made to a non-existent company so tells Sharon that it can only be Ian or Steven but she worries about confronting the wrong person.&lt;ref name="20oct16"&gt;{{Cite episode |title= Episode dated 20/10/2016 |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0807538 |series= EastEnders |serieslink=EastEnders |credits= Executive Producer: [[Sean O'Connor (producer)|Sean O'Connor]]; Director: John Greening; Writer: Jessica Lea |network=[[BBC]] |station= [[BBC One]] |airdate= 20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jane eventually finds out that it is Steven but promises to not say anything when Steven says he did it to help Peter out of debts. Masood helps Jane to walk before he leaves Walford. Jane later admits to Stacey that she feels that Ian no longer finds her attractive. However, Ian learns of this and kisses her. When Max returns, Lauren arranges to meet him in the pub and invites Jane and Ian, but Ian tells Jane they need to leave because Max left Ian a note saying he would never forget what they did, however, Jane convinces him to meet Max. They both apologise to Max and he claims to understand their motivation to protect their child and says he wants to move on, shaking both their hands and buying them a drink.

By February 2017, Jane is able to push her own wheelchair. However, she is told by doctors that her physiotherapy is being withdrawn but that she can have private physiotherapy if she wants it. When Ian is told he is at risk of developing type-2 diabetes, Jane vows to help him lose weight. When Ian's fish and chip shop is destroyed, he decides to sell it so he can spend more time with Jane.

By May 2017, Jane is able to stand up and has crutches but still uses the wheelchair. In September, Jane discovers Steven's lie about his brain tumour, Steven's affair with Abi and Max's revenge plan. As Jane confronts Max, a gas explosion destroys Walford in Bloom. Max leaves Jane at restaurant,  but, Jane having told Max she knows his scheme, he orders Steven to kill Jane. Steven arrives and confronts Jane. Jane tries to talk Steven round but he is disbelieving about Abi expecting his child. Steven turns increasingly nasty on Jane, leaving her helpless on the floor and goes through with setting fire to Beales. Later Steven has a change of heart and refuses to kill Jane. Max violently shoves Steven to a corner of a kitchen counter leaving him badly injured. Max confronts Jane about his revenge on all Walford residents. Jane pleads with Max not to go through with his plans, however he proceeds to take the fire blanket, leaving Jane to burn to death. Jane survives and is taken to hospital, although Steven later dies from his injuries. Jane is left in a coma for several weeks afterwards, and upon waking up she is threatened by Max to stay quiet. Max eventually orders her to leave Walford, and although she and Ian make plans to leave, Max later orders her to leave alone, threatening Bobby if she doesn't comply. Jane says her goodbye but couldn't tell anybody about Max because he was watching her move every time. Jane leaves Walford in a taxi, leaving Ian a voicemail telling him she will ring him later. When she doesn't phone, Ian fears that she is missing, but is talked out of reporting it by Max, who then leaves her another message warning her to not contact Ian again. In a last attempt to oust Max, Jane sends a voicemail to her friend [[Stacey Fowler]] ([[Lacey Turner]]) warning her about Max, unaware that her phone is now in the possession of [[Bernadette Taylor]] (Clair Norris) after her younger brother [[Riley Taylor]] (Tom Jacobs) impulsively stole it for her. Riley and his brother [[Chatham Taylor]] (Alfie Jacobs) later listen to a different voicemail from Jane, which begs Stacey not to repeat the details of her first voicemail to anyone.

Stacey gets her phone back on Christmas Day and Max deletes most of the voicemails before she can hear them. However, Tanya arrives and reveals that Jane has told her everything, revealing the truth about Max's role in Steven's death and Jane's departure to Stacey and an eavesdropping Abi and Stacey's husband [[Martin Fowler (EastEnders)|Martin Fowler]] ([[James Bye (actor)|James Bye]]). Upon arriving back at Ian's house, Abi tells Lauren, Ian and Kathy about Max's role in Steven's death, and Kathy tells Phil; leaving all disgusted with Max's actions.

Jane also made some cameo appearances in the Internet spin-off series ''[[EastEnders: E20]]''. In episode 2 of series 1, Jane is working in the café where [[Fatboy (EastEnders)|Fatboy]] ([[Ricky Norwood]]) attempts to chat her up. In episode 3 of series 2, she is seen briefly talking to a girl outside the café and in  episode 8 she confronts [[Asher Levi]] ([[Heshima Thompson]]) about some trainers he sold to Peter. He says he does not give refunds so she snatches his wallet and takes some money out but he snatches it back. Jane tells two police officers that Asher is a thief and they chase after him. In episode 10, Asher says he will refund Jane and when his brother [[Sol Levi]] ([[Tosin Cole]]) needs him, she lets him go.

==Creation and development==
Brett joined the cast of ''EastEnders'' in 2004 and was asked to dye her hair red and keep it short for the part. She also put on an English accent to disguise her natural Scottish accent.&lt;ref name="dailyrecord"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/showbiz/2006/04/21/laurie-isn-t-plain-jane-anymore-86908-16973413/|title=Laurie isn't plain Jane anymore|work=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|date=21 April 2006|accessdate=18 January 2010|first=Rick|last=Fulton}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brett described Jane as "warm, kind, caring and nurturing but she's not somebody that will be pushed around. She is quite feisty. She's a matriarch. Not as a dominant woman but she's definitely in a matriarch, she's the centre of a family in the making for ''EastEnders''."&lt;ref name="dailyrecord"/&gt;

In 2006, Jane has an affair with [[Grant Mitchell (EastEnders)|Grant Mitchell]], played by [[Ross Kemp]]. The scenes began after writers saw chemistry between Kemp and Brett. Brett considered the storyline to be a turning point for the character as "All I did for the last year was say: 'What can I get you?' in the café."&lt;ref name="dailyrecord"/&gt; Jane was given a sexier look after a new producer came in and asked Brett to grow her hair and bleach out the red dye.&lt;ref name="dailyrecord"/&gt;

Jane marries [[Ian Beale]] ([[Adam Woodyatt]]), after co-habiting for around two years. Brett described Jane as "the straight man to Ian's buffoon. She's the other half who makes him whole."&lt;ref name="Beales"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Woodward|first=Kate|author-link=|publication-date=8 April 2008|date=|year=|title=Brace yourselves! It's the Beales|periodical=[[Inside Soap]]|publication-place=[[England]]|place=|publisher=|volume=|issue=|pages=49–52|url=|doi=|oclc=|accessdate=|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking on the character's relationship with her husband, she likened herself to his mother, [[Kathy Beale|Kathy]] ([[Gillian Taylforth]]), stating: "if Jane doesn't work out for Ian, no one will! Perhaps because Ian is finally married to his mother. Jane is very Kathy-esque. They'd have got on really well, though I can't imagine Kathy would've been too impressed with Jane's affair with Grant – despite the fact she got through a few Mitchells herself!"&lt;ref name="Beales" /&gt; She stated that she hoped Jane and Ian's marriage would be a lasting one, commenting that so far: "it's panned out brilliantly.  There are millions of marriages like this one, involving a strong woman behind an incredibly weak man.  But it's Ian's flaws that make everyone love him so much. The only time a character becomes boring is when they're two dimensional, and that's something you could never say about Ian. I can't imagine being anyone else's missus!"&lt;ref name="Beales" /&gt;

On the Beale family as a whole, Brett commented: "we're probably the most normal family in [[Albert Square]]. The Beales are like the Trotters from ''[[Only Fools and Horses]]'' in many ways. They're salt-of-the-earth people who are trying to better themselves, so there's plenty of scope for drama and comedy.  The writers certainly haven't run out of ideas for us yet - I haven't stopped working on big stories since I joined the show!"&lt;ref name="Beales" /&gt;

===Reintroduction (2014)===
Jane returned to ''EastEnders'' in the 6 and 7 January 2014 episodes. Brett's return to filming was not announced by the show's producers so that viewers would be surprised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a541929/eastenders-jane-beale-makes-surprise-return-to-show.html|title=EastEnders: Jane Beale makes surprise return to show|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=6 January 2014|work=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=6 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brett found it easy to keep her return a secret, but said that the ''EastEnders'' press office and executive producer [[Dominic Treadwell-Collins]] probably found it more difficult. Brett said that she was "absolutely thrilled" with the reaction that she received, after the episode was broadcast, opining that it proved that Jane is a popular character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/scoop/a542220/eastenders-laurie-brett-im-thrilled-with-jane-return-reaction.html|title=EastEnders' Laurie Brett: 'I'm thrilled with Jane return reaction'|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=7 January 2014|work=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=7 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brett's character returned to screens from late February to early May, and returned on 24 November 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a565165/eastenders-jane-beale-to-return-permanently-in-late-2014.html#~oChT7uK7es7DXo|title=Eastenders: Jane Beale to return permanently in late 2014|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=17 April 2014|work=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=23 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Second departure (2017)===
On 23 October 2017, Jane made a previously unannounced departure from the show after being forced to leave Walford by [[Max Branning]] ([[Jake Wood]]). Of her departure, Brett commented: "I've loved every minute of playing Jane Beale. To return to ''EastEnders'' with such a huge storyline was an absolute gift. However, what I have known from the start is that with the soap gods watching us at all times, there is only so long before things go full circle. It's been hard keeping the secret but the storyline has been great to play out and I have loved every minute of it."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://metro.co.uk/2017/10/23/eastenders-spoilers-will-jane-beales-message-bring-down-max-branning-7021451/|title=EastEnders airs the exit of Jane Beale as Laurie Brett says goodbye|date=2017-10-23|work=Metro|access-date=2017-10-23|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
{{Expand section|date=May 2010}}
In a review of the first decade of the 21st century in soaps, Ruth Deller of [[lowculture]].co.uk wrote that Jane was "one of the best new characters in soap this decade; really believable, sensitive, [and] sensible, [...] she gives ''EastEnders'' a bit of heart, which is rare indeed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lowculture.co.uk/index.php/2009/12/31/soapstar-superstars-the-2000s/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110820081956/http://lowculture.co.uk/index.php/2009/12/31/soapstar-superstars-the-2000s/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=20 August 2011|title=Soapstar Superstars: The 2000s|last=Deller|first=Ruth|date=31 December 2009|publisher=[[lowculture]].co.uk|accessdate=12 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deller also expressed her belief that Jane transformed the Beale family into one of the strongest families of the late 2000s, further stating: "A genuinely nice character whom you could imagine being your mate, once they got that nonsense with Grant out of the way, she's been a real asset to the soap."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://lowculture.co.uk/index.php/2009/10/31/soapstar-superstars-septemberoctober/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110820081854/http://lowculture.co.uk/index.php/2009/10/31/soapstar-superstars-septemberoctober/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=20 August 2011|title=Soapstar Superstars – September/October|publisher=[[lowculture]].co.uk|author=Deller, Ruth|date=31 October 2009|accessdate=16 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kevin O'Sullivan (journalist)|Kevin O'Sullivan]] of the ''[[Sunday Mirror]]'' said that Jane was an ''EastEnders'' veteran who had a "seismic departure" as she "checked out of soapland's asylum in characteristically crazy style". When Jane departed she said "from now on I can be whoever I want" - in response O'Sullivan quipped "but you'll always be the loser who married Ian Beale".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=O'Sullivan|first=Kevin|title=From barmy to balmier|authorlink=Kevin O'Sullivan (journalist)|newspaper=[[Sunday Mirror]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|date=29 January 2012|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Virgin Media]] called 2009 the "Good year" for Jane because she left her ex-husband Ian, "the most boring and selfish man in Walford."&lt;ref name=virginmedia&gt;"[http://www.virginmedia.com/tvradio/christmas-tv/soaps-good-year-bad-year.php?ssid=5 Good year, bad year — Good year: Jane Beale]."

Brett was nominated for "Best Actress" at [[British Soap Awards#2015 winners|The British Soap Awards 2015]], but lost to co-star, [[Kellie Bright]], who portrays [[Linda Carter]]. However, she won "Best On-screen Partnership" alongside Woodyatt.

{{slavery}}

'''Jewish views on slavery''' are varied both religiously and historically. [[Judaism]]'s ancient and medieval religious texts contain numerous laws governing the ownership and treatment of slaves. Texts that contain such regulations include the [[Tanakh]] (Hebrew Bible), the [[Talmud]], the 12th century [[Mishneh Torah]] by rabbi [[Maimonides]], and the 16th century [[Shulchan Aruch]] by rabbi [[Yosef Karo]].  The original Israelite slavery laws found in the Hebrew Bible bear some resemblance to the 18th century BCE slavery laws of [[Hammurabi]].&lt;ref name="Hastings, p 619"&gt;Hastings, p 619&lt;/ref&gt;{{Obsolete source|date=July 2018}} The regulations changed over time.  The Hebrew Bible contained two sets of laws, one for [[Canaan]]ite slaves, and a more lenient set of laws for Hebrew slaves.  From the time of the Pentateuch, the laws designated for Canaanites were applied to all non-Hebrew slaves. The Talmud's slavery laws, which were established in the second through the fifth centuries CE,&lt;ref name="BBC Religion"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Talmud|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/judaism/texts/talmud.shtml|website=BBC Religion|publisher=BBC|accessdate=18 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; contain a single set of rules for all slaves, although there are a few exceptions where Hebrew slaves are treated differently from non-Hebrew slaves.  The laws include punishment for slave owners that mistreat their slaves.  In the modern era, when the [[abolitionism|abolitionist]] movement sought to outlaw slavery, supporters of slavery used the laws to provide religious justification for the practice of slavery.

Historically some Jewish people owned and traded slaves.&lt;ref name="Reiss p 85"&gt;{{cite book|author=Oscar Reiss|title=The Jews in Colonial America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MQEyBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA85|date=2 January 2004|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-1730-8|page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were important players in the [[Slavery in medieval Europe|medieval slave trade in Europe]] up to about the 12th century.&lt;ref name="Hastings, p 620"/&gt;{{Obsolete source|date=July 2018}}&lt;ref name="Drescher, p 107"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Trade|title=YIVO {{!}} Trade|website=www.yivoencyclopedia.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several scholarly works have been published to rebut the [[antisemitic canard]] of Jewish domination of the slave trade in Africa and the [[Americas]] in the later centuries,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Jews and the American Slave Trade|author=Saul Friedman|pages=250–254}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Finkelman&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1051402 Reviewed Work: Jews, Slaves, and the Slave Trade: Setting the Record Straight by Eli Faber] by Paul Finkelman.

Palgrave Macmillan, 2002; {{ISBN|0-312-16561-7}}
* "In no period did Jews play a leading role as financiers, shipowners, or factors in the transatlantic or Caribbean slave trades. They possessed far fewer slaves than non-Jews in every British territory in North America and the Caribbean. Even when Jews in a handful of places owned slaves in proportions slightly above their representation among a town's families, such cases do not come close to corroborating the assertions of The Secret Relationship." - Wim Klooster (University of Southern Maine): [http://oieahc.wm.edu/wmq/Jan00/FaberJan00.pdf Review of ''Jews, Slaves, and the Slave Trade: Setting the Record Straight'' by Eli Faber]{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (2000).

* "Medieval Christians greatly exaggerated the supposed Jewish control over trade and finance and also became obsessed with alleged Jewish plots to enslave, convert, or sell non-Jews... Most European Jews lived in poor communities on the margins of Christian society; they continued to suffer most of the legal disabilities associated with slavery. ... Whatever Jewish refugees from Brazil may have contributed to the northwestward expansion of sugar and slaves, it is clear that Jews had no major or continuing impact on the history of New World slavery." - Professor David Brion Davis of Yale University in ''Slavery and Human Progress'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1984), p. 89 (cited in [http://www.nizkor.org/ftp.cgi/orgs/american/wiesenthal.center/ftp.py?orgs/american/wiesenthal.center//web/historical-facts Shofar FTP Archive File: orgs/american/wiesenthal.center//web/historical-facts])
* "The Jews of Newport seem not to have pursued the [slave trading] business consistently ... [When] we compare the number of vessels employed in the traffic by all merchants with the number sent to the African coast by Jewish traders ... we can see that the Jewish participation was minimal. It may be safely assumed that over a period of years American Jewish businessmen were accountable for considerably less than two percent of the slave imports into the West Indies" - Professor Jacob R.

* "None of the major slave-traders was Jewish, nor did Jews constitute a large proportion in any particular community. ... probably all of the Jewish slave-traders in all of the Southern cities and towns combined did not buy and sell as many slaves as did the firm of Franklin and Armfield, the largest Negro traders in the South." - Bertram W.

American mainland colonial Jews imported slaves from Africa at a rate proportionate to the general population.  As slave sellers, their role was more marginal, although their involvement in the Brazilian and Caribbean trade is believed to be considerably more significant.&lt;ref name=ColumbiaHistory&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=JIBM5JEYM1gC&amp;pg=PA43 ''The Columbia History of Jews and Judaism in America'', p. 43], by Rabbi Marc Lee Raphael, (Columbia University Press, February 12, 2008); {{ISBN|978-0231132220}}. "During the 1990s, allegations that Jews financed, dominated, and controlled the slave trade captured wide attention and were widely accepted in the African American community (on the latter point, see [[Henry Louis Gates Jr.]]'s "Black Demagogues and Pseudo-Scholars", ''New York Times'', July 20, 1992, p A15). Subsequent extensive research demonstrated this was not the case, see David Brion Davis, "Jews in the Slave Trade", ''Culturefront'' (Fall 1992): 42-45&lt;br&gt;* Seymour Drescher, "The Role of Jews in the Transatlantic Slave Trade", ''Immigrants and Minorities'' 12 (1993): 113-25&lt;br&gt;Eli Faber, ''Jews, Slaves, and the Slave Trade: Setting the Record Straight'' (New York, 1998)&lt;br&gt;Saul S. Friedman, ''Jews and the American Slave Trade'' (New Brunswick, NJ, 1998).&lt;br&gt;For numerical data demonstrating the minute role played by mainland colonial Jews in the importation of slaves from Africa and the Caribbean and their marginal role as slave sellers, see Faber, ''Jews, Slaves, and the Slave Trade'', pp 131-42"; retrieved from Google Books on January 28, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Jason H. Silverman, a historian of slavery, describes the part of Jews in slave trading in the southern United States as "minuscule", and writes that the historical rise and fall of slavery in the United States would not have been affected at all had there been no Jews living in the [[American South]].&lt;ref name="Rodriguez, p 385"/&gt; Jews accounted for 1.25% of all Southern slave owners, and were not significantly different from other slave owners in their treatment of slaves.&lt;ref name="Rodriguez, p 385"/&gt;

==The Exodus==

The story of the [[Exodus from Egypt]], as related in the [[Torah]], has shaped the Jewish people throughout history.  Briefly outlined, the story recounts the experience of the [[Israelites]] under Egyptian enslavement, God's promise to redeem them from slavery, God's punishment of the Egyptians, and the Israelite redemption and departure from Egypt.  The Exodus story has been interpreted and reinterpreted in every era and in every location to suit or challenge cultural norms.&lt;ref&gt;Kushner, 332.&lt;/ref&gt; The result over time has been a steady increase in governance of masters in favor of slaves' rights and eventually the complete prohibition of slavery.&lt;ref name="Kushner457" /&gt;

==Biblical era==

Ancient Israelite society allowed slavery; however, total domination of one human being by another was not permitted.&lt;ref name="Hezser, p 6"&gt;Hezser, p 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Potok, 457-459.&lt;/ref&gt; Rather, slavery in antiquity among the Israelites was closer to what would later be called [[indentured servitude]].&lt;ref name="Kushner457"&gt;Kushner, 457.&lt;/ref&gt; Slaves were seen as an essential part of a Hebrew household.&lt;ref name="Hezser, p 382"&gt;Hezser, p 382&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, there were cases in which, from a slave's point of view, the stability of servitude under a family in which the slave was well-treated would have been preferable to economic freedom.&lt;ref&gt;Tigay, 153.&lt;/ref&gt; It is impossible for scholars to quantify the number of slaves that were owned by Hebrews in ancient Israelite society, or what percentage of households owned slaves, but it is possible to analyze social, legal, and economic impacts of slavery.&lt;ref&gt;Hezser p 23&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Hebrew Bible]] contains two sets of rules governing slaves:  one set for Hebrew slaves (Lev 25:39-43) and a second set for [[Canaan]]ite slaves (Lev 25:45-46).&lt;ref name="Hastings, p 619"/&gt;{{Obsolete source|date=July 2018}}&lt;ref name="Hezser, p 29"&gt;Hezser, p 29&lt;/ref&gt; The main source of non-Hebrew slaves were prisoners of war.&lt;ref name="Hezser, p 382"/&gt;   Hebrew slaves, in contrast to non-Hebrew slaves, became slaves either because of extreme poverty (in which case they could sell themselves to an Israelite owner) or because of inability to pay a debt.&lt;ref name="Hezser, p 6"/&gt;  According to the Hebrew Bible, non-Hebrew slaves were drawn primarily from the neighboring [[Canaan]]ite nations,&lt;ref name="Schorsch, p 63"&gt;Schorsch, p 63&lt;/ref&gt; and religious justification was provided for the enslavement of these neighbors:  the rules governing Canaanites was based on a curse aimed at [[Canaan (Biblical figure)|Canaan]], a son of [[Curse of Ham|Ham]],&lt;ref&gt;Lewis p 5&lt;/ref&gt; but in later eras the Canaanite slavery laws were stretched to apply to all non-Hebrew slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Schorsch p 63&lt;/ref&gt;

The laws governing non-Hebrew slaves were more harsh than those governing Hebrew slaves:  non-Hebrew slaves could be owned permanently, and bequeathed to the owner's children,&lt;ref&gt;Leviticus 25:45-45&lt;/ref&gt; whereas Hebrew slaves were treated as servants, and were released after six years of service or the occurrence of a jubilee year.&lt;ref&gt;Hezser, p 30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Potok, 457&lt;/ref&gt; One scholar suggests that the distinction was due to the fact that non-Hebrew slaves were subject to the [[curse of Canaan]], whereas God did not want Jews to be slaves because he freed them from [[The Exodus|Egyptian enslavement]].&lt;ref&gt;Hezser, pp 10, 30&lt;/ref&gt;

The laws governing Hebrew slaves were more lenient than laws governing non-Hebrew slaves, but a single Hebrew word, ''ebed'' (meaning slave or servant, cognate to the Arabic ''[[Abd (Arabic)|abd]]'') is used for both situations.  In English translations of the Bible, the distinction is sometimes emphasized by translating the word as "slave" in the context of non-Hebrew slaves, and "servant" or "bondman" for Hebrew slaves.&lt;ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia"&gt;Jewish Encyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt;

Most slaves owned by Israelites were non-Hebrew, and scholars are not certain what percentage of slaves were Hebrew: [[Ephraim Urbach]], a distinguished scholar of Judaism,  maintains that Israelites rarely owned Hebrew slaves after the [[Maccabean]] era, although it is certain that Israelites owned Hebrew slaves during the time of the [[Babylonian exile]].&lt;ref name="Hezser, p 6"/&gt;  Another scholar suggests that Israelites continued to own Hebrew slaves through the Middle Ages, but that the Biblical rules were ignored, and Hebrew slaves were treated the same as non-Hebrews.&lt;ref&gt;Schorsch, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt;

The Torah forbids the return of runaway slaves who escape from their foreign land and their bondage and arrive in the Land of Israel. Furthermore, the Torah demands that such former slaves be treated equally to any other resident alien.&lt;ref&gt;Deuteronomy 23:16-17&lt;/ref&gt; This law is unique in the Ancient Near East.&lt;ref&gt;Potok, 1124-1125&lt;/ref&gt;

==Talmudic era==
In the early [[Common Era]], the regulations concerning slave-ownership by Jews underwent an extensive expansion and codification within the Talmud.&lt;ref name="Blackburn, p 68"&gt;Blackburn, p 68&lt;/ref&gt;  The precise issues that necessitated a clarification to the laws is still up for debate. The majority of current scholarly opinion holds that pressures to assimilate during the late Roman to early medieval period resulted in an attempt by Jewish communities to reinforce their own identities by drawing distinctions between their practices and the practices of non-Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Urbach, pp 3-4, 37-38&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Milikowsky, Collected Writings in Jewish Studies&lt;/ref&gt;  One author however, has forwarded that they could include factors such as ownership of non-Canaanite slaves, the continuing practice of owning Jewish slaves or conflicts with Roman slave-ownership laws.&lt;ref name="Blackburn, p 68"/&gt; Thus, the [[Talmud]] (circa 200–500 CE) contains an extensive set of laws governing slavery, which is more detailed than found in the [[Torah]].

The major change found in the Talmud's slavery laws was that a single set of rules, with a few exceptions, governs both Jewish slaves and non-Jewish slaves.&lt;ref name="Schorsch, p 63"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hezser, pp 8, 31-33, 39"&gt;Hezser, pp 8, 31-33, 39&lt;/ref&gt; Another change was that the distinction between Hebrew and non-Hebrew slaves began to diminish as the Talmud expanded during this period. This included an expanded set of obligations the owner incurred to the slave as well as codifying the process for manumission (the freeing from slavery). It also included a large set of conditions that allowed or required manumission to include requirements for education of slaves, expanding disability manumission, and in cases of religious conversion or necessity.&lt;ref name="Schorsch, p 63"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hezser, pp 8, 31-33, 39"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hastings, p 620"&gt;Hastings, p 620&lt;/ref&gt;{{Obsolete source|date=July 2018}}&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Jewish Encyclopedia, "Slaves and Slavery"&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;Ref&gt;Jewish Virtual Library, Slavery in Judaism&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kid 24a, Git 38b, Yev 93b&lt;/ref&gt; These restrictions were based on the Biblical injunction to treat slaves well with the reinforcement of the memory of Egyptian slavery which Jews were urged to remember by their scriptural texts.&lt;ref name="Goodman2007"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jdiKEOTphrgC|title=Rome and Jerusalem: The Clash of Ancient Civilizations|author=Martin Goodman|date=25 January 2007|publisher=Penguin Books Limited|isbn=978-0-14-190637-9|page=250}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, historian [[Josephus]] wrote that the seven-year automatic release was still in effect if the slavery was a punishment for a crime the slave committed (as opposed to voluntary slavery due to poverty).&lt;ref&gt;Hezser, p 33&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the notion of Canaanite slaves from the Jewish Bible is expanded to all non-Jewish slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Schorsch, pp 64-65&lt;/ref&gt;

Significant effort is given in the Talmud to address the property rights of slaves. While the Torah only refers to a slave's specific ability to collect gleanings, Talmudic sources interpret this commandment to include the right to own property more generally, and even "purchase" a portion of their own labor from the master. Hezser notes the often confusing mosiac of Talmudic laws distinguishes between finding property during work and earning property as a result of work.&lt;ref&gt;Hezser, p 46&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garnsey, "Ideas of Slavery from Aristotle to Augustine"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schorsch&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kid 11b, Kid 14b (note 13), Ar. 1:2, Shek. 1:5, Pes. 8:2, 88b, Yev. 66a, Yev. 7:1, BK 11:1, BB 51b–52a, Sanh. 91a, 105a, Ket. 28a, Meg. 16a&lt;/ref&gt; While the Talmud affirmed that self-redemption of slaves (Jewish or not) was always permitted, it noted that conditionless manumission by the owner was generally a violation of legal precept.&lt;ref&gt;Hastings, p 620, citing Gitten 45b&lt;/ref&gt;{{Obsolete source|date=July 2018}}  The Talmud however, also included a varied list of circumstances and conditions that overrode this principle and mandated manumission. Conditions such as ill-treatment, oral promise, marriage to a free-woman, escape, inclusion in religious ceremony, and desire to visit the Holy Land all required the master to provide the slave with a deed of manumission, presented to him with witnesses. Failure to comply would result in excommunication.&lt;ref&gt;ibid&lt;/ref&gt;

It is apparent that Jews still owned Jewish slaves in the Talmudic era because Talmudic authorities tried to denounce the practice&lt;ref&gt;Lev. 25:39&lt;/ref&gt; that Jews could sell themselves into slavery if they were poverty-stricken. In particular, the Talmud said that Jews should not sell themselves to non-Jews, and if they did, the Jewish community was urged to ransom or redeem the slave.&lt;ref name="Hastings, p 620"/&gt;{{Obsolete source|date=July 2018}}

While Jews did take slaves for granted just as in other ancient societies, slaves in Jewish households could expect more compassionate treatment.&lt;ref name="Goodman20072"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jdiKEOTphrgC|title=Rome and Jerusalem: The Clash of Ancient Civilizations|author=Martin Goodman|date=25 January 2007|publisher=Penguin Books Limited|isbn=978-0-14-190637-9|page=250}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Female slaves===
The classical rabbis instructed that masters could never marry female slaves. They would have to be [[manumitted]] first;&lt;ref&gt;''Gittin'', 40a&lt;/ref&gt; similarly, male slaves could not be allowed to marry Jewish women.&lt;ref&gt;''Gittin'' 4:5&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the biblical instruction to sell thieves into slavery (if they were caught during daylight and could not repay the theft), the rabbis ordered that female Israelites could never be sold into slavery for this reason.&lt;ref name="je"&gt;''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]'' (1901), article on ''Slaves and Slavery''&lt;/ref&gt;{{obsolete source|date=July 2018}} Sexual relations between a slave owner and engaged slaves is prohibited in the Torah (Lev. 19:20-22).&lt;ref name="Abrahams, p 95"&gt;Abrahams, p 95&lt;/ref&gt;{{obsolete source|date=July 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;Roth, p 61&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Torah allows sex with non-engaged slaves, by clarifying that if she is engaged when the master has sex with her, "they are not to be put to death, since she was not freed" (which implies that a woman's slave status has direct bearing on whether she can be used for sex).&lt;ref name="Abrahams, p 95"/&gt;{{obsolete source|date=July 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;Roth, p 71&lt;/ref&gt;

===Freeing a slave===
The [[Tanakh]] contains the rule that Jewish slaves would be released following six years of service, but that non-Jewish slaves (barring a long list of conditions including conversion, or disability) could potentially be held indefinitely. The Talmud codified and expanded the list of conditions requiring manumission to include religious necessity, conversion, escape, maltreatment, and codified slaves' property rights and rights to education.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Gittin'' 1:4, 1:6, and 40b.&lt;/ref&gt; Freeing a non-Jewish slave was seen as a religious conversion, and involved a second immersion in a ritual bath ([[mikveh]]). Jewish authorities of the Middle Ages argued against the Biblical rule that provided freedom for severely injured slaves.&lt;ref&gt;The Bible said a slave should be freed if they had been harmed to the extent that their injury was covered by the [[lex talionis]] - {{bibleverse||Exodus|21:26-27|}}, should actually apply only to slaves who had converted to Judaism; additionally, Maimonides argued that manumission was really punishment of the owner and so that it could only be imposed by a court and required evidence from witnesses. —Jewish Encyclopedia.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Treatment of slaves===
The Torah and the Talmud contain various rules about how to treat slaves. Biblical rules for treatment of Jewish slaves were more lenient than for non-Jewish slaves&lt;ref name="bibleverse||Leviticus|25:43"&gt;{{bibleverse||Leviticus|25:43|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bibleverse||Leviticus|25:53"&gt;{{bibleverse||Leviticus|25:53|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Leviticus|25:39|}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Talmud insisted that Jewish slaves should be granted similar food, drink, lodging, and bedding, to that which their master would grant to himself.&lt;ref&gt;Furthermore, the Talmud instructed that servants were not to be unreasonably penalised for being absent from work due to sickness. The biblical seventh-year manumission was still to occur after the slave had been enslaved for six years; extra enslavement could not be tacked on to make up for the absence, unless the slave had been absent for more than a total of four years, and if the illness did not prevent light work (such as needlework), the slave could be ill for all six years without having to repay the time.&lt;/ref&gt; Laws existed that specified punishment of owners that killed slaves.&lt;ref&gt;The vague ("Avenger of Blood", ''Jewish Encyclopedia'', 1901.) biblical instruction to ''avenge'' slaves that had died, from punishment by their masters, {{bibleverse||Exodus|21:20-21|}} became regarded as an instruction to view such events as murder, with masters guilty of such crime being [[beheading|beheaded]], see ''[[Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael|Mekhilta]]'', ''Mishpatim'' 7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;On the other hand, the protection given to fugitive slaves was lessened by the classical rabbis; fugitive Israelite slaves were now compelled to buy their freedom, and if they were recaptured, then the time they had been absent was added on as extra before the usual 7th-year manumission could take effect.&lt;/ref&gt; Jewish slaves were often treated as property; for example, they were not allowed to be counted towards the quorum, equal to 10 men, needed for public worship.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Berakhot (Talmud)|Berakot]]'' 47. [[Sadducees]] went as far as to hold slave owners responsible for any damage caused by their slaves; - ''[[Yadayim]]'' 4:7. By contrast [[Pharisees]] acknowledged that slaves had independent thought - ''Yadayim'' 4:7&lt;/ref&gt;  Maimonides and other [[Halacha|halachic]] authorities forbade or strongly discouraged any unethical treatment of slaves, Jewish or not.&lt;ref&gt;According to the traditional Jewish law, a slave is more like an indentured servant, who has rights and should be treated almost like a member of the owner's family. Maimonides wrote ([[Mishneh Torah|Yad]], [http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1363819/jewish/Chapter-Nine.htm ''Avadim'' 9:8]) that, regardless whether a slave is Jewish or not, "The way of the pious and the wise is to be compassionate and to pursue justice, not to overburden or oppress a slave, and to provide them from every dish and every drink. The early sages would give their slaves from every dish on their table. They would feed their servants before sitting to their own meals.... Slaves may not be maltreated of offended&amp;nbsp;— the law destined them for service, not for humiliation. Do not shout at them or be angry with them, but hear them out". In another context, Maimonides wrote that all the laws of slavery are "mercy, compassion and forbearance" - from Encyclopedia Judaica, 2007, vol. 18, p. 670&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Freeman|first1=Tzvi|title=Torah, Slavery and the Jews|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/305549/jewish/Torah-Slavery-and-the-Jews.htm|publisher=Chabad-Lubavitch Media Center|accessdate=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some accounts indicate that Jewish slave-owners were affectionate, and would not sell slaves to a harsh master&lt;ref&gt;Abrahams, p 100-101&lt;/ref&gt;{{obsolete source|date=July 2018}} and that Jewish slaves were treated as members of the slave-owner's family.&lt;ref&gt;Roth, p 60&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars are unsure to what extent the laws encouraging humane treatment were followed. In the 19th century, Jewish scholars such as [[Moses Mielziner]] and [[Samuel Krauss]] studied slave-ownership by ancient Jews, and generally concluded that Jewish slaves were treated as merely temporary bondsman, and that Jewish owners treated slaves with special compassion.&lt;ref name="Hezser, pp 3-5"&gt;Hezser, pp 3-5&lt;/ref&gt; However, 20th century scholars such as [[Solomon Zeitlin]] and [[Ephraim Urbach]], examined Jewish slave-ownership practices more critically, and their historical accounts generally conclude that Jews did own slaves at least through the Maccabbean period, and that it was probably more ubiquitous and humane than earlier scholars had maintained.&lt;ref&gt;Hezser, pp 5-8&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Catherine Hezser explains the differing conclusions by suggesting that the 19th century scholars were "emphasizing the humanitarian aspects and moral values of ancient Judaism, Mielziner, Grunfeld, Farbstein, and Krauss [to argue] that the Jewish tradition was not inferior to early Christian teachings on slaves and slavery."&lt;ref name="Hezser, pp 3-5"/&gt;

===Converting or circumcising non-Jewish slaves===
The Talmudic laws required Jewish slave owners to try to convert non-Jewish slaves to Judaism.&lt;ref name="Hastings, p 620"/&gt;{{Obsolete source|date=July 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, p 8-9.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other laws required slaves, if not converted, to be circumcised and undergo ritual immersion in a bath (''[[mikveh]]'').&lt;ref name="Lewis, p 8-9"&gt;Lewis, p 8-9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hezser, p 41&lt;/ref&gt; A 4th century Roman law prevented the circumcision of non-Jewish slaves, so the practice may have declined at that time,&lt;ref&gt;Hezser, p 41-42&lt;/ref&gt; but increased again after the 10th century.&lt;ref name="Abrahams, p 99"&gt;Abrahams, p 99&lt;/ref&gt;{{obsolete source|date=July 2018}} Jewish slave owners were not permitted to drink wine that had been touched by an uncircumcised person so there was always a practical need, in addition to the legal requirement, to circumcise slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Abrahams p. 99&lt;/ref&gt;{{obsolete source|date=July 2018}}

Although conversion to Judaism was a possibility for slaves, rabbinic authorities Maimonides and Karo discouraged it on the basis that Jews were not permitted (in their time) to proselytise;&lt;ref name="je" /&gt; slave owners could enter into special contracts by which they agree not to convert their slaves.&lt;ref name="je" /&gt; Furthermore, to convert a slave into Judaism without the owner's permission was seen as causing harm to the owner, on the basis that it would rob the owner of the slave's ability to work during the Sabbath, and it would prevent them from selling the slave to non-Jews.&lt;ref name="je" /&gt;

===Jewish slaves and masters===
[[File:Boleslav of Bohemia and Jewish slave trader.jpg|right|250px|thumb|A Jewish slave trader being presented to [[Boleslaus I, Duke of Bohemia|Boleslas of Bohemia]]]]
[[Christian]] leaders, including Pope [[Gregory the Great]] (served 590-604), objected to Jewish ownership of Christian slaves, due to concerns about conversion to Judaism and the Talmudic mandate to circumcise slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Abrahams, pp 97, 99&lt;/ref&gt;{{obsolete source|date=July 2018}} The first prohibition of Jews owning Christian slaves was made by [[Constantine I]] in the 4th century. The prohibition was repeated by subsequent councils - [[Fourth Council of Orléans]] (541), Paris (633), [[Fourth Council of Toledo]] (633), the [[Synod of Szabolcs]] (1092) extended the prohibition to Hungary, [[Ghent]] (1112), [[Narbonne]] (1227), [[Béziers]] (1246). It was part of Saint Benedict's rule that Christian slaves were not to serve Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Aronius, "Regesten", No. 114&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the prohibition, Jews participated to some extent in slave trading during the Middle Ages. The extent of Jewish participation in the medieval slave trade has been subject to ongoing discourse among the historians. [[Michael Toch]] noted that the idea of a Jewish dominance of or even monopoly over the slave trade of medieval Christian Europe, while present in some older historical works, is generally unfounded.&lt;ref name="studio2000"&gt;{{cite book |author= Michael Toch |agency= Istituto internazionale di storia economica F.

Most European Jews lived in poor communities on the margins of Christian society; they continued to suffer most of the legal disabilities associated with slavery.&lt;ref&gt;David Brion Davis. ''Slavery and Human Progress'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1984), p. 89 (cited in [http://www.nizkor.org/ftp.cgi/orgs/american/wiesenthal.center/ftp.py?orgs/american/wiesenthal.center//web/historical-facts Shofar FTP Archive File: orgs/american/wiesenthal.center//web/historical-facts])&lt;/ref&gt; Jews participated in routes that had been created by Christians or Muslims but rarely created new trading routes.&lt;ref name="Drescher, p 107"/&gt;

During the [[Middle Ages]], Jews acted as slave-traders in Slavonia&lt;ref&gt;Graetz, Heinrich, ''History of the Jews'', vol iii, p 305 (Engl. translation by P. Bloch)&lt;/ref&gt;{{obsolete source|date=July 2018}} North Africa,&lt;ref name="Hastings, p 620"/&gt;{{Obsolete source|date=July 2018}} Baltic States,&lt;ref&gt;Drescher, p 111&lt;/ref&gt; Central and Eastern Europe,&lt;ref name="Drescher, p 107"/&gt; Spain and Portugal,&lt;ref name="Hastings, p 620"/&gt;{{Obsolete source|date=July 2018}}&lt;ref name="Drescher, p 107"/&gt; and Mallorca&lt;ref&gt;Schorsch, p 52&lt;/ref&gt; The most significant Jewish involvement in the slave-trade was in Spain and Portugal during the 10th to 15th centuries.&lt;ref name="Hastings, p 620"/&gt;{{Obsolete source|date=July 2018}}&lt;ref name="Drescher, p 107"/&gt;

Jewish participation in the slave trade was recorded as beginning in the 5th century, when [[Pope Gelasius I|Pope Gelasius]] permitted Jews to introduce slaves from [[Gaul]] into Italy, on the condition that they were non-Christian.&lt;ref name=JE_STO&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=849&amp;letter=S Slave Trade]. [[Jewish Encyclopedia]]&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 8th century, [[Charlemagne]] (ƒ 768-814) explicitly allowed Jews to act as intermediaries in the slave trade.&lt;ref name="Abrahams, p 98"&gt;Abrahams, p 98&lt;/ref&gt;{{obsolete source|date=July 2018}} In the 10th century, Spanish Jews traded in [[Slavonia]]n slaves, whom the Caliphs of [[Andalusia]] purchased to form their bodyguards.&lt;ref name="Abrahams, p 98"/&gt;{{obsolete source|date=July 2018}} In [[Bohemia]], Jews purchased these Slavonian slaves for exportation to Spain and the west of Europe.&lt;ref name="Abrahams, p 98"/&gt;{{obsolete source|date=July 2018}} [[William the Conqueror]] brought Jewish slave-traders with him from [[Rouen]] to England in 1066.&lt;ref name="Abrahams, p 99"/&gt;{{obsolete source|date=July 2018}} At [[Marseilles]] in the 13th century, there were two Jewish slave-traders, as opposed to seven Christians.&lt;ref&gt;"R. E. J." xvi.&lt;/ref&gt;

Middle Ages historical records from the 9th century describe two routes by which Jewish slave-dealers carried slaves from west to east and from east to west.&lt;ref name=JE_STO/&gt; According to [[Abraham ben Jacob|Abraham ibn Yakub]], [[Byzantine]] Jewish merchants bought [[Slavs]] from [[Prague]] to be sold as slaves.  Similarly, the Jews of [[Verdun]], around the year 949, purchased slaves in their neighborhood and sold them in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;Aronius, "Regesten", No. 127&lt;/ref&gt;

Jews continued to own slaves during the 16th through 18th centuries, and ownership practices were still governed by Biblical and Talmudic laws.&lt;ref name="Schorsch, p 63"/&gt; Myriad Hebrew and other sources indicate that owning slaves—particularly women of Slavic origin—was uniquely prevalent during this period among the Jewish households of the urban centres of the Ottoman Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ben-Naeh|2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Halachic developments===

====Treatment of slaves====
Jewish laws governing treatment of slaves were restated in the 12th century by noted rabbi [[Maimonides]] in his book [[Mishneh Torah]], and again in the 16th century by Rabbi [[Yosef Karo]] in his book [[Shulchan Aruch]].&lt;ref&gt;Hastings, p 619-620&lt;/ref&gt;{{Obsolete source|date=July 2018}}

The legal prohibition against Jews owning Jewish slaves was emphasized in the Middle Ages&lt;ref&gt;Abrahams, p 97, who cites Shulchan Aruch, Yore Deah, 267 sec 14&lt;/ref&gt;{{obsolete source|date=July 2018}} yet Jews continued to own Jewish slaves, and owners were able to bequeath Jewish slaves to the owner's children, but Jewish slaves were treated in many ways like members of the owner's family.&lt;ref&gt;Abraham, p 97&lt;/ref&gt;{{obsolete source|date=July 2018}}

====Redeeming Jewish slaves====
The [[Hebrew Bible]] contains instructions to redeem (purchase the freedom of) Jewish slaves owned by non-Jews (Lev. 25:47-51).  Following the suppression of the [[First Jewish–Roman War|66AD rebellion in Judea]] by the Roman army, many Jews were taken to Rome as prisoners of war.&lt;ref name="je" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Tacitus]], ''Annals'', 2:85&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Suetonius]], ''Tiberius'', 36&lt;/ref&gt; In response, the Talmud contained guidance to emancipate Jewish slaves, but cautioned the redeemer against paying excessive prices since that may encourage Roman captors to enslave more Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Hezser, p 43&lt;/ref&gt; [[Josephus]], himself a former 1st century slave, remarks that the faithfulness of Jewish slaves was appreciated by their owners;&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, ''Antiquities of the Jews''&lt;/ref&gt; this may have been one of the main reasons for freeing them.&lt;ref name="je" /&gt;

In the Middle Ages, redeeming Jewish slaves gained importance and—up until the 19th century—Jewish congregations around the Mediterranean Sea formed societies dedicated to that purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Abrahams, p 96&lt;/ref&gt;{{obsolete source|date=July 2018}} Jewish communities customarily ransomed Jewish captives according to a Judaic [[mitzvah]] regarding the redemption of captives ([[Pidyon Shvuyim]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.myjewishlearning.com/daily_life/GemilutHasadim/Social_Welfare/PidyonShvuyim.htm Ransoming Captive Jews.

In Venice, the Jewish Levantine and Portuguese congregations set up a special organization for redeeming Jewish captives taken by Christians from Turkish ships, Jewish merchants paid a special tax on all goods to support it, which acted as a form of insurance since they were likely victims."&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Johnson (writer)|Paul Johnson]]: ''A History of the Jews''. 1987. p.240&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern era==

===Latin America and the Caribbean===
Jews participated in the [[European colonization of the Americas]], and owned slaves in Latin America and the Caribbean, most notably in [[Brazil]] and [[Suriname]], but also in [[Barbados]] and [[Jamaica]].&lt;ref&gt;"Suriname", ''The Historical Encyclopaedia of world slavery, Volume 1'', by Junius P. Rodriguez, p 622&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reiss, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schorsch, p 60&lt;/ref&gt; Especially in Suriname, Jews owned many large plantations.&lt;ref&gt;Rodriguez, p. 622&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the ethnic Jews in the New World, particularly in Brazil, were "[[New Christian]]s" or ''[[converso]]s'', some of which continued to practice Judaism, so the distinction between Jewish and non-Jewish slave owners is a difficult distinction for scholars to make. {{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

===Mediterranean slave trade===
{{further|Jewish pirates|Barbary slave trade}}
The [[Algerian Jews|Jews of Algiers]] were frequent purchasers of Christian slaves from [[Barbary corsairs]].&lt;ref&gt;Hebb, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Jewish brokers in [[Livorno]], Italy, were instrumental in arranging the ransom of Christian slaves from Algiers to their home countries and freedom. Although one slave accused [[History of the Jews in Livorno|Livorno's Jewish]] brokers of holding the ransom until the captives died, this allegation is uncorroborated, and other reports indicate Jews as being very active in assisting the release of English Christian captives.&lt;ref&gt;Hebb, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; In 1637, an exceptionally poor year for ransoming captives, the few slaves freed were ransomed largely by Jewish factors in Algiers working with Henry Draper.&lt;ref&gt;Hebb, p. 163, No 5&lt;/ref&gt;

===Atlantic slave trade===
[[Image:Triangle trade2.png|right|thumb|200px|Triangular slave trade.]]
The Atlantic slave trade transferred African slaves from Africa to colonies in the New World.  Much of the slave trade followed a [[Triangular trade|triangular route]]: slaves were transported from Africa to the Caribbean, sugar from there to North America or Europe, and manufactured goods from there to Africa.  Jews and descendants of Jews participated in the slave trade on both sides of the Atlantic, in the Netherlands, Spain, and Portugal on the eastern side, and in Brazil, Caribbean, and North America on the west side.&lt;ref&gt;Drescher, p 107: "A small fragment of the Jewish diaspora fled ... westward into the Americas, there becoming entwined with the African slave trade"....they could only prosper by moving into high risk and new areas of economic development.  In the expanding Western European economy after the Columbus voyages, this meant getting footholds within the new markets at the fringes of Europe, primarily in overseas enclaves.  One of these new 'products' was human beings.  It was here that Jews, or descendants of Jews, appeared on the rosters of Europe's slave trade."&lt;/ref&gt;

After Spain and Portugal [[Alhambra Decree|expelled many of their Jewish residents]] in the 1490s, many Jews from Spain and Portugal migrated to the Americas and to the Netherlands.&lt;ref name="Austen, p 134"&gt;Austen, p 134&lt;/ref&gt; Jewish participation in the Atlantic slave trade increased through the 17th century because Spain and Portugal maintained a dominant role in the Atlantic trade and peaked in the early 18th century, but started to decline after the [[Peace of Utrecht]] in 1713 when Britain obtained the right to sell slaves in Spanish colonies, and Britain and France started to compete with Spain and Portugal.&lt;ref&gt;Drescher: JANCAST (p 451): "Jewish mercantile influence in the politics of the Atlantic slave trade probably reached its peak in the opening years of the eighteenth century....the political and the economic prospects of Dutch Sephardic [Jewish] capitalists rapidly faded, however, when the British emerged with the asiento [permission to sell slaves in Spanish possessions] at the Peace of Utrecht in 1713".&lt;/ref&gt; By the time the worldwide slave trade and European sugar-growing reached its peak in the 18th century, Jewish participation was dwarfed by the enterprise of British and French planters who did not allow Jews among their number.  During the 19th century, some Jews owned some cotton plantations in the southern United States.&lt;ref name="Austen, p 134" /&gt;

====Brazil====
[[File:NavioNegreiro.gif|right|thumb|200px|Slave ship used in Brazilian trade.]]
{{See also|Slavery in Brazil}}
The role of Jewish converts to Christianity (New Christians) and of Jewish traders was momentarily significant in Brazil&lt;ref name="Drescher p 455"&gt;Drescher: JANCAST: p 455: "only in the Americas&amp;nbsp;— momentarily in Brazil, more durably in the Caribbean&amp;nbsp;— can the role of Jewish traders be described as significant." p 455.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Christian inhabitants of Brazil were envious because the Jews owned some of the best plantations in the river valley of [[Pernambuco]], and some Jews were among the leading slave traders in the colony.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert I. Bloom. "The Christian inhabitants [of Brazil] were envious because the Jews owned some of the best plantations in the river valley of Pernambuco and were among the leading slave-holders and slave traders in the colony", p 133 of ''The Economic Activities of the Jews in Amsterdam in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries''&lt;/ref&gt;{{obsolete source|date=July 2018}} Some Jews from Brazil migrated to [[Rhode Island]] in the American colonies, and played a significant but non dominant role in the 18th-century slave trade of that colony; this sector accounted for only a very tiny portion of the total human exports from Africa.&lt;ref name="Austen135"&gt;Austen, p 135: "Jews of Portuguese Brazilian origin did play a significant (but by no means dominant) role in the eighteenth-century slave trade of Rhode Island, but this sector accounted for only a very tiny portion of the total human exports from Africa."&lt;/ref&gt;

====Caribbean and Suriname====
The New World location where Jews played the largest role in the slave-trade was in the Caribbean and [[Suriname]], most notably in possessions of the Netherlands, that were serviced by the [[Dutch West India Company]].&lt;ref name="Drescher p 455"/&gt; The slave trade was one of the most important occupations of Jews living in Suriname and the Caribbean.&lt;ref&gt;"Slave trade [sic] was one of the most important Jewish activities here [in Surinam] as elsewhere in the colonies", p 159, same book 2. ''The Economic Activities of the Jews of Amsterdam in the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries'' (Port Washington, New York/London: Kennikat Press, 1937), p. 159{{ISBN missing}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jews of Suriname were the largest slave-holders in the region.&lt;ref name="Roth, p 292"&gt;Roth, p 292&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Austen, "the only places where Jews came close to dominating the New World plantation systems were Curaçao and Suriname."&lt;ref&gt;Austen* p 135: "but the Dutch territories were small, and their importance shortlived."&lt;/ref&gt; Slave auctions in the Dutch colonies were postponed if they fell on a Jewish holiday.&lt;ref name="Raphael, p 14"&gt;Raphael, p 14&lt;/ref&gt; Jewish merchants in the Dutch colonies acted as middlemen, buying slaves from the Dutch West India Company, and reselling them to plantation owners.&lt;ref&gt;Kritzler, p 135: ''While the [Dutch West India] Company held a monopoly on the slave trade, and made a 240 percent profit per slave, Jewish merchants, as middlemen, also had a lucrative share, buying slaves at the Company auction and selling them to planters on an installment plan&amp;nbsp;— no money down, three years to pay at an interest rate of 40-50 percent.  ... With their large profits&amp;nbsp;— slaves were marked up by 300 percent ... - they built stately homes in [[Recife]], and owned ten of the 166 sugar plantations, including "some of the best plantations in the river valley of [[Pernambuco]]"''. [Herbert Bloom quoted in the last sentence]&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of buyers at slave auctions in the Brazil and the Dutch colonies were Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Wiznitzer, Arnold, ''Jews in Colonial Brazil'', Columbia University Press, 1960, p 70; quoted by Schorsch at p 59: The West India Company, which monopolized imports of slaves from Africa, sold slaves at public auctions against cash payment. "It happened that cash was mostly in the hands of Jews. The buyers who appeared at the auctions were almost always Jews, and because of this lack of competitors they could buy slaves at low prices. On the other hand, there also was no competition in the selling of the slaves to the plantation owners and other buyers, and most of them purchased on credit payable at the next harvest in sugar. Profits up to 300 percent of the purchase value were often realized with high interest rates"&lt;/ref&gt; Jews allegedly played a "major role" in the slave trade in Barbados&lt;ref name="Raphael, p 14"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schorsh, p 60&lt;/ref&gt; and Jamaica,&lt;ref name="Raphael, p 14"/&gt; and Jewish plantation owners in Suriname helped suppress several slave revolts between 1690 to 1722.&lt;ref name="Roth, p 292"/&gt;

In Curaçao, Jews were involved in trading slaves, although at a far lesser extent compared to the Protestants of the island.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Schorsch. ''Jews and blacks in the early modern world'', p. 61&lt;!-- ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Jews imported fewer than 1,000 slaves to Curaçao between 1686 and 1710, after which the slave trade diminished.&lt;ref name="Raphael, p 14"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schorsch p 62: In Curaçao: "Jews also participated in the local and regional trading of slaves"&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1630 and 1770, Jewish merchants settled or handled "at least 15,000 slaves" who landed in [[Curaçao]], about one-sixth of the total Dutch slave trade.&lt;ref&gt;Drescher, JANCAST, p 450&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cnaan|first1=Liphshiz|last2=Tzur|first2=Iris|title=How culpable were Dutch Jews in the slave trade?|url=http://www.jta.org/2013/12/26/news-opinion/world/dutch-rabbi-confronts-jews-with-ancestors-complicity-in-slavery#ixzz326RoIrWQ|publisher=Jewish Telegraphic Agency|accessdate=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====North American colonies====
{{See also|Slavery in the colonial United States}}
The Jewish role in the American slave trade was minimal.&lt;ref&gt;Professor Jacob R. Marcus of Hebrew Union College in The Colonial American Jew (Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 1970), Vol. 2, pp. 702-703&lt;/ref&gt; According to historian and rabbi [[Bertram Korn]], there were Jewish owners of plantations, but altogether they constituted only a tiny proportion of the industry.&lt;ref name="Korn"&gt;Bertram W. Korn, "Jews and Negro Slavery in the Old South, 1789-1865", in ''The Jewish Experience in America'', ed. Abraham J. Karp (Waltham, MA: American Jewish Historical Society, 1969), Vol. 3, p. 180 &lt;!-- ISBN needed --&gt;:&lt;/ref&gt; In 1830 there were only four Jews among the 11,000 Southerners who owned fifty or more slaves.&lt;ref&gt;''Historical Facts vs. Antisemitic Fictions: The Truth About Jews, Blacks, Slavery, Racism and Civil Rights'' (prepared under the auspices of the Simon Wiesenthal Center by Dr. Harold Brackman and Professor Mary R. Lefkowitz; 1993)&lt;!-- ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Of all the shipping ports in Colonial America, only in [[Newport, Rhode Island]] did Jewish merchants play a significant part in the slave-trade.&lt;ref&gt;Drescher, EAJH. Vol 1 (p 415), Newport, RI: "Newport [Rhode Island] was the leading African slaving port during the eighteenth century and the only port in which Jewish merchants played a significant part. At the peak period of their participation in slaving expeditions (the generation before the Am. Revolution), Newport's Jewish merchants handled up to 10 percent of the Rhode Island slave trade. Incomplete records for other eighteenth-century ports in which Jews participated in the slave trade in any way show that for a few years they held at least partial shares in up to 8 percent of New York's small number of slaving voyages, usually from African to Caribbean ports.&lt;/ref&gt;

A table of the commissions of brokers in [[Charleston, South Carolina]], shows that one Jewish brokerage accounted for 4% of the commissions. According to Bertram Korn, Jews accounted for 4 of the 44 slave-brokers in Charleston, three of 70 in Richmond, and 1 of 12 in Memphis.&lt;ref&gt;Drescher, EAJ. Vol 1 (p 415): internal traffic within US (Korn 1973).&lt;/ref&gt; However the proportion of Jewish residents of Charleston who owned slaves was similar to that of the general white population (83% versus 87% in 1830).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Susanna Ashton | title = Slaves of Charleston | newspaper = [[The Forward]] | date = September 12, 2014 | url = http://forward.com/articles/205455/slaves-of-charleston/?p=all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assessing the extent of Jewish involvement in the Atlantic slave trade===
[[File:Jacob Levin slave auction ad.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Advertisement for slave auction of slave trader Jacob Levin&lt;ref&gt;Ad from ''A key to Uncle Tom's cabin: presenting the original facts and documents upon which the story is founded.

Bosworth, 1853&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Information on Jacob Levin found at ''Jews and the American Slave Trade'', by Saul S. Friedman, p 157&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Historian [[Seymour Drescher]] emphasized the problems of determining whether or not slave-traders were Jewish.  He concludes that [[New Christian]] merchants managed to gain control of a sizeable share of all segments of the Portuguese Atlantic slave trade during the Iberian-dominated phase of the Atlantic system. Due to forcible conversions of Jews to Christianity many New Christians continued to [[Crypto-Jews|practice Judaism in secret]], meaning it is impossible for historians to determine what portion of these slave traders were Jewish, because to do so would require the historian to choose one of several definitions of "Jewish".&lt;ref&gt;Drescher, p 109&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Drescher: JANCAST: p 447: "New Christian merchants managed to gain control of a sizeable, perhaps major, share of all segments of the Portuguese Atlantic slave trade during the Iberian-dominated phase of the Atlantic system. I have come across no description of the Portuguese slave trade that estimates the relative shares of the various participants in the slave trade by the racial-religious designation, but New Christian families certainly oversaw the movement of a vast number of slaves from Africa to Brazil during its first-century period [1600-1700]."&lt;/ref&gt;

====''The Secret Relationship Between Blacks and Jews'' (book) ====
{{Main article|The Secret Relationship Between Blacks and Jews}}

In 1991, the [[Nation of Islam]] (NOI) published ''The Secret Relationship Between Blacks and Jews'', which alleged that Jews had dominated the Atlantic slave trade.&lt;ref&gt;Austen, pp 131-33&lt;/ref&gt; Volume 1 of the book claims Jews played a major role in the [[Atlantic slave trade]], and profited from slavery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Jews and Money|first=Abraham|last=Foxman|pages=130–135}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nation of Islam and antisemitism|The book was heavily criticized for being anti-Semitic]], and for failing to provide any objective analysis of the role of Jews in the slave trade. Common criticisms included the fact that the book used selective quotes, made "crude use of statistics",&lt;ref name="Austen, p 134"/&gt; and was purposefully trying to exaggerate the role of Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Austen, pp 133-34&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Anti-Defamation League]] (ADL) criticized the NOI and the book.&lt;ref name="adl.org"/&gt; [[Henry Louis Gates Jr]] criticized the book's intention and scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;"Black Demagogues and Pseuo-Scholars", ''New York Times'', July 20, 2002, p A15.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Antisemitism}}
Historian Ralph A. Austen heavily criticized the book and said that although the book may seem fairly accurate, it is an anti-Semitic book.  However, he added that before the publication of ''The Secret Relationship'', some scholars were reluctant to discuss Jewish involvement in slavery because of fear of damaging the "shared liberal agenda" of Jews and African Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Austen, pp 131-135&lt;/ref&gt; In that sense, Austen found the book's aims of challenging the myth of universal Jewish benevolence throughout history to be legitimate even though the means to that end resulted in an anti-Semitic book.&lt;ref&gt;Austen, p. 131: &lt;blockquote&gt;"[[John Hope Franklin]] and I ... were condoning a benign historical myth: that the shared liberal agenda of twentieth-century Blacks and Jews has a pedigree going back through the entire remembered past. ... Jewish students of Jewish history have known it was untrue and ... have produced a significant body of scholarship detailing the involvement of our ancestors in the Atlantic slave trade and Pan-American slavery.  [The scholarship] had never been synthesized in a publication for non-scholarly audience.  A book of this sort has now appeared, however, written not by Jews but by an anonymous group of African Americans associated with the Reverend Louis Farrakhan's Nation of Islam."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

====Later assessments====
The publication of ''The Secret Relationship'' spurred detailed research into the participation of Jews in the Atlantic slave trade, resulting in the publication of the following works, most of which were published specifically to refute the thesis of ''The Secret Relationship'':
* 1992 - Harold Brackman, ''Jew on the brain: A public refutation of the Nation of Islam's The Secret relationship between Blacks and Jews''
* 1992 - [[David Brion Davis]], "Jews in the Slave Trade", in ''Culturefront'' (Fall 1 992) pp 42–45
* 1993 - [[Seymour Drescher]], "The Role of Jews in the Atlantic Slave Trade", ''Immigrants and Minorities'', 12 (1993), pp 113–25
* 1993 - Marc Caplan, ''Jew-Hatred As History: An Analysis of the Nation of Islam's "The Secret Relationship"'' (published by the [[Anti Defamation League]])
* 1998 - Eli Faber, ''Jews, Slaves, and the Slave Trade: Setting the Record Straight'',  New York University Press
* 1999 - Saul S. Friedman, ''Jews and the American Slave Trade'', Transaction

Most post-1991 scholars that analysed the role of Jews only identified certain regions (such as Brazil and the Caribbean) where the participation was "significant".&lt;ref&gt;Drescher: JANCAST:  p 455: "only in the Americas&amp;nbsp;— momentarily in Brazil, more durably in the Caribbean&amp;nbsp;— can the role of Jewish traders be described as significant." .. but elsewhere involvemnent was modest or minimal p 455.&lt;/ref&gt; Wim Klooster wrote: "In no period did Jews play a leading role as financiers, shipowners, or factors in the transatlantic or Caribbean slave trades. They possessed far fewer slaves than non-Jews in every British territory in North America and the Caribbean. Even when Jews in a handful of places owned slaves in proportions slightly above their representation among a town's families, such cases do not come close to corroborating the assertions of ''The Secret Relationship''".&lt;ref name="academia.edu" /&gt;

David Brion Davis wrote that "Jews had no major or continuing impact on the history of New World slavery."&lt;ref&gt;"Medieval Christians greatly exaggerated the supposed Jewish control over trade and finance and also became obsessed with alleged Jewish plots to enslave, convert, or sell  non-Jews ... Most European Jews lived in poor communities on the margins of Christian society; they continued to suffer most of the legal disabilities associated with slavery. ... Whatever Jewish refugees from Brazil may have contributed to the northwestward expansion of sugar and slaves, it is clear that Jews had no major or continuing impact on the history of New World slavery." - Professor David Brion Davis of Yale University in ''Slavery and Human Progress'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1984), p 89 (cited in [http://www.nizkor.org/ftp.cgi/orgs/american/wiesenthal.center/ftp.py?orgs/american/wiesenthal.center//web/historical-facts Shofar FTP Archive File: orgs/american/wiesenthal.center//web/historical-facts])&lt;/ref&gt; Jacob R. Marcus wrote that Jewish participation in the American Colonies was "minimal" and inconsistent.&lt;ref&gt;"The Jews of Newport seem not to have pursued the [slave trading] business consistently ... [When] we compare the number of vessels employed in the traffic by all merchants with the number sent to the African coast by Jewish traders ... we can see that the Jewish participation was minimal. It may be safely assumed that over a period of years American Jewish businessmen were accountable for considerably less than two percent of the slave imports into the West Indies" - Professor Jacob R.

Korn. ''Jews and Negro Slavery in the Old South, 1789–1865'', in ''The Jewish Experience in America'', ed. Abraham J.

According to a review in ''[[The Journal of American History]]'' of both ''Jews, Slaves, and the Slave Trade: Setting the Record Straight''  and ''Jews and the American Slave Trade'': "Faber acknowledges the few merchants of Jewish background locally prominent in slaving during the second half of the eighteenth century but otherwise confirms the small-to-minuscule size of colonial Jewish communities of any sort and shows them engaged in slaving and slave holding only to degrees indistinguishable from those of their English competitors."&lt;ref&gt;"Eli Faber takes a quantitative approach to Jews, Slaves, and the Slave Trade in Britain's Atlantic empire, starting with the arrival of Sephardic Jews in the London resettlement of the 1650s, calculating their participation in the trading companies of the late seventeenth century, and then using a solid range of standard quantitative sources (Naval Office shipping lists, censuses, tax records, and so on) to assess the prominence in slaving and slave owning of merchants and planters identifiable as Jewish in Barbados, Jamaica, New York, Newport, Philadelphia, Charleston, and all other smaller English colonial ports. He follows this strategy in the Caribbean through the 1820s; his North American coverage effectively terminates in 1775.

"The available evidence indicates that the Jewish network probably counted for little in Atlantic slaving. The few cases of long-term Jewish participation in the eighteenth-century slave trades offer evidence of cross-religious networks as keys to their success. In case after case, Jews who participated in multiple slaving voyages ... linked themselves to Christian agents or partners. It was not as Jews, but as merchants, that traders ventured into one of the great enterprises of the early modern world." Drescher, in Ency Am. J. Hist. p 416.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Drescher, pp 107-108&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995 the [[American Historical Association]] (AHA) issued a statement, together with Drescher, condemning "any statement alleging that Jews played a disproportionate role in the Atlantic slave trade".&lt;ref name="ajh"&gt;Encyclopedia of American Jewish history, Volume 1, p 199&lt;/ref&gt;

Jewish slave ownership practices in the southern United States were governed by regional practices, rather than Judaic law.&lt;ref name="Rodriguez, p 385"&gt;Rodriguez, p 385&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Greenberg, p 110"&gt;Greenberg, p 110&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reiss, p 88"&gt;Reiss, p 88&lt;/ref&gt; Many southern Jews held the view that blacks were subhuman and were suited to slavery, which was the predominant view held by many of their non-Jewish southern neighbors.&lt;ref&gt;Reiss, p 84&lt;/ref&gt; Jews conformed to the prevailing patterns of slave ownership in the South, and were not significantly different from other slave owners in their treatment of slaves.&lt;ref name="Rodriguez, p 385"/&gt; Wealthy Jewish families in the American South generally preferred employing white servants rather than owning slaves.&lt;ref name="Reiss, p 88"/&gt; Jewish slave owners included [[Aaron Lopez]], [[Francis Salvador]], [[Judah Touro]], and [[Haym Salomon]].&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, ''Jews and the American Slave Trade;; pp xiii, 123-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jewish slave owners were found mostly in business or domestic settings, rather than on plantations, so most of the slave ownership was in an urban context&amp;nbsp;— running a business or as domestic servants.&lt;ref name="Greenberg, p 110"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Reiss, p 88"/&gt; Jewish slave owners freed their black slaves at about the same rate as non-Jewish slave owners.&lt;ref name="Rodriguez, p 385"/&gt; Jewish slave owners sometimes bequeathed slaves to their children in their wills.&lt;ref name="Rodriguez, p 385"/&gt;

===Abolition debate===

A significant number of Jews gave their energies to the antislavery movement.&lt;ref name="whiteman"&gt;Maxwell Whiteman, "Jews in the Antislavery Movement", Introduction to The Kidnapped and the Ransomed: The Narrative of Peter and Vina Still (Philadelphia: The Jewish Publication Society of America, 1970), pp 28, 42&lt;!-- ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Many 19th century Jews, such as [[Adolphe Crémieux]], participated in the moral outcry against slavery. In 1849, Crémieux announced the abolition of slavery throughout the French possessions.&lt;ref name="am"/&gt;

In England there were Jewish members of the abolition groups. [[Granville Sharp]] and [[William Wilberforce|Wilberforce]], in his "A Letter on the Abolition of the Slave Trade," employed Jewish teachings as arguments against slavery. Rabbi G. Gottheil of Manchester, and Dr. L. Philippson of Bonn and Magdeburg, forcibly combated the view announced by Southern sympathizers, that Judaism supports slavery. Rabbi M. Mielziner's anti-slavery work "Die Verhältnisse der Sklaverei bei den Alten Hebräern", published in 1859, was translated and published in the United States.&lt;ref name="am"&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=1606&amp;letter=A ANTISLAVERY MOVEMENT AND THE JEWS, Max J. Kohler]&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in Germany, [[Berthold Auerbach]] in his fictional work "Das Landhausam Rhein" aroused public opinion against slavery and the slave trade, and [[Heinrich Heine]] also spoke against slavery.&lt;ref name="am"/&gt; Immigrant Jews were among abolitionist [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]]'s band of antislavery fighters in Kansas, including Theodore Wiener (from Poland); Jacob Benjamin (from Bohemia), and [[August Bondi]] (1833-1907) from Vienna.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ajhs.org/scholarship/chapters/chapter.cfm?documentID=196 |accessdate=March 14, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301010537/http://www.ajhs.org/scholarship/chapters/chapter.cfm?documentID=196 |archivedate=March 1, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nathan Meyer Rothschild]] was known for his role in the [[Abolitionism#Great Britain|abolition of the slave trade]] through his part-financing of the £20 million [[Her Majesty's Government|British government]] compensation paid to former owners of the plantation industry's freed slaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/56390513|title=Hochschild, Adam (2005) ''Bury the Chains: Prophets and Rebels in the Fight to Free an Empire's Slaves'', Houghton Mifflin: New York, p 347|publisher=Worldcat.org|accessdate=2010-07-08|oclc=56390513}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[American Civil War|civil-war era]], prominent Jewish religious leaders in the United States engaged in public debates about slavery.&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite book|title=This Land of Liberty: A History of America's Jews|first=Helene Schwartz|last=Kenvin|publisher=Behrman House, Inc|year=1986|isbn=0-87441-421-0|pages=90–92}}*Benjamin, Judah P.

M. Michelbacher (both of Virginia), used the [[Tanakh]] (Jewish Bible) to support their arguments.&lt;ref&gt;
*{{cite book|title=What went wrong?: the creation and collapse of the Black-Jewish Alliance|first=Murray|last=Friedman|publisher=Simon and Schuster|year= 2007|page=25}}

[[Abolitionism in the United States|Abolitionist]] rabbis, including Einhorn and [[Michael Heilprin]], concerned that Raphall's position would be seen as the official policy of American Judaism, vigorously rebutted his arguments, and argued that slavery&amp;nbsp;– as practiced in the South&amp;nbsp;– was immoral and not endorsed by Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Strangers &amp; neighbors: relations between Blacks &amp; Jews in the United States|first=Maurianne|last=Adams|pages=190–94|publisher=University of Massachusetts Press|year=1999|isbn=1-55849-236-4}}. Adams writes that Raphall's position was "accepted by many as the Jewish position on the slavery question. ... Raphall was a prominent Orthodox rabbi and so the sermon was used in the South to prove the Biblical sanction of slavery and the American Jews' sympathy with the secession movement."&lt;/ref&gt;

Ken Yellis, writing in ''[[The Forward]]'', has suggested that "the majority of American Jews were mute on the subject, perhaps because they dreaded its tremendous corrosive power.  Prior to 1861, there are virtually no instances of rabbinical sermons on slavery, probably due to fear that the controversy would trigger a sectional conflict in which Jewish families would be arrayed on opposite sides.  ... America’s largest Jewish community, New York’s Jews were overwhelmingly pro-southern, pro-slavery, and anti-Lincoln in the early years of the war." However, as the war progressed, "and the North’s military victories mounted, feelings began to shift toward[s] ... the Union and eventually, emancipation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yellis|first1=Ken|title=Jews Mostly Supported Slavery&amp;nbsp;— Or Kept Silent&amp;nbsp;— During Civil War|url=http://forward.com/articles/179441/jews-mostly-supported-slavery-or-kept-silent-d/?p=all#ixzz326OPEy5Q|publisher=The Forward Association|accessdate=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contemporary affairs, Jews and African-Americans have cooperated in the Civil Rights movement, motivated partially by the common background of slavery, particularly the story of the Jewish enslavement in Egypt, as told in the Biblical story of the [[Book of Exodus]], which many blacks identified with.&lt;ref&gt;Kaufman, pp 3, 268&lt;/ref&gt; [[Seymour Siegel]] suggests that the historic struggle against prejudice faced by Jews led to a natural sympathy for any people confronting discrimination. Joachim Prinz, president of the [[American Jewish Congress]], spoke from the podium at the Lincoln Memorial during the famous [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom|March on Washington]] in 1963 where he emphasized how Jews identify deeply with African American disenfranchisement "born of our own painful historic experience," including slavery and [[ghettoization]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.joachimprinz.com/civilrights.htm Joachim Prinz March on Washington Speech]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crmvet.org/info/mowprog.htm Veterans of the Civil Rights Movement - March on Washington]&lt;/ref&gt;

Presently, according to the [[Orthodox Union]],  ''[[The Jewish Daily Forward]]'', and the ''[[Jewish Quarterly]]'', slavery (as defined as the total subjugation of one human being over another) is absolutely unacceptable in Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"There is little doubt that in terms of the Torah’s value system the exercise of power by one person over another, without their consent, is a fundamental assault against human dignity. ... So slavery is to be abolished. ... [God] wanted slavery abolished but he wanted it to be done by free human beings coming to see of their own accord the evil it is and the evil it does. The God of history, who taught us to study history, had faith that eventually we would learn the lesson of history: that freedom is indivisible. We must grant freedom to others if we truly seek it for ourselves."&lt;/blockquote&gt; [[Jonathan Sacks|Sacks, Jonathan]].

Accessed 21 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"History has judged [American Civil War-era Rabbi Morris Jacob] Raphall's defense of slavery poorly.  No Orthodox rabbi today would defend his view."

Human power and dominion, on the other hand, is always relative, so there is no justification for slavery; no human has the right to enslave another for none has absolute authority."&lt;/blockquote&gt; [http://www.jewishquarterly.org/issuearchive/article0eff.html?articleid=368 "Tikkun Olam."] ''[[The Jewish Quarterly]]''.

A recent, general example of a knowledge spillover could be the collective growth associated with the [[research and development]] of online [[social networking]] tools like [[Facebook]], [[YouTube]], and [[Twitter]].  Such tools have not only created a [[positive feedback loop]], and a host of originally unintended benefits for their users, but have also created an explosion of new software, programming platforms, and conceptual breakthroughs that have perpetuated the development of the industry as a whole.  The advent of online marketplaces, the utilization of user profiles, the widespread democratization of information, and the interconnectivity between tools within the industry have all been products of each tool’s individual developments.  These developments have since spread outside the industry into the mainstream media as news and entertainment firms have developed their own market feedback applications within the tools themselves, and their own versions of online networking tools (e.g. [[CNN]]’s [[iReport]]).

There are two kinds of knowledge spillovers: internal and external. Internal knowledge spillover occurs if there is a positive impact of knowledge between individuals [[wiktionary:within|within]] an organization that produces goods and/or services.&lt;ref name="economy"/&gt; An external knowledge spillover occurs when the positive impact of knowledge is between individuals [[wiktionary:without|without]] or outside of a production organization.&lt;ref name="economy"/&gt; Marshall-Arrow-Romer (MAR) spillovers, Porter spillovers and Jacobs spillovers are three types of spillovers.&lt;ref name="economy"/&gt;

==MAR spillover==
{{confusing|section|date=August 2015}}
[[Image:CabrilloBusinessPark-1.png|thumb|A business park in [[Santa Barbara County, California]] that may generate MAR spillover]]
MAR spillover has its origins in 1890, where the  [[England|English]] economist [[Alfred Marshall]] developed a theory of knowledge spillovers.&lt;ref name="economy"/&gt; Knowledge spillovers later were extended by economists [[Kenneth Arrow]] (1962) and [[Paul Romer]] (1986).  In 1992, [[Edward Glaeser]], [[Hedi Kallal]], [[José Scheinkman]], and [[Andrei Shleifer]] pulled together the &lt;u&gt;M&lt;/u&gt;arshall-&lt;u&gt;A&lt;/u&gt;rrow-&lt;u&gt;R&lt;/u&gt;omer views on knowledge spillovers and accordingly named the view MAR spillover in 1992.&lt;ref name="cities"&gt;Glaeser et al., [http://gsi.adislab.net/docs/Plunket/glaeser92.pdf "Growth in Cities"], Journal of Political Economy, 1992 Vol. 100, No. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the Marshall-Arrow-Romer (MAR) spillover view, the proximity of firms within a [[wiktionary:common|common]] industry often affects how well knowledge travels among firms to facilitate innovation and growth.&lt;ref name="economy"/&gt; The closer the firms are to one another, the greater the MAR spillover.&lt;ref name="economy"/&gt; The exchange of ideas is largely from employee to employee, in that employees from different firms in an industry exchange ideas about new products and new ways to produce goods.&lt;ref name="economy"/&gt; The opportunity to exchange ideas that lead to innovations key to new products and improved production methods.&lt;ref name="economy"/&gt;

[[Business parks]] are a good example of concentrated businesses that may benefit from MAR spillover.&lt;ref name="economy"/&gt; Many [[Semiconductor industry|semiconductor firms]] intentionally located their research and development facilities in [[Silicon Valley]] to take advantage of MAR spillover.&lt;ref name="economy"/&gt; In addition, the [[film industry]] in [[Los Angeles, California]] and elsewhere relies on a geographic concentration of specialists ([[Film director|directors]], [[Film producer|producer]]s, [[screenwriter|scriptwriter]]s, and [[set designer]]s) to bring together narrow aspects of movie-making into a final product.

However, research on the Cambridge IT Cluster (UK) suggests that technological knowledge spillovers might only happen rarely and are less important than other cluster benefits such as labour market pooling.&lt;ref name="techspillovers"&gt;Huber, F., [http://joeg.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2011/02/01/jeg.lbq058.abstract "Do clusters really matter for innovation practices in Information Technology? Questioning the significance of technological knowledge spillovers "], Journal of Economic Geography, {{doi|10.1093/jeg/lbq058}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Porter spillover==
Porter (1990), like MAR, argues that knowledge spillovers in specialized, geographically concentrated industries stimulate growth.  He insists, however, that local competition, as opposed to local monopoly, fosters the pursuit and rapid adoption of innovation.  He gives examples of Italian ceramics and gold jewellery industries, in which hundreds of firms are located together and fiercely compete to innovate since the alternative to innovation is demise.  Porter's externalities are maximized in cities with geographically specialized, competitive industries.&lt;ref name="cities"/&gt;

==Jacobs spillover==
Under the Jacobs spillover view, the proximity of firms from different industries affect how well knowledge travels among firms to facilitate innovation and growth.&lt;ref name="economy"/&gt; This is in contrast to MAR spillovers, which focus on firms in a common industry.&lt;ref name="economy"/&gt; The [[diversity (business)|diverse]] proximity of a Jacobs spillover brings together ideas among individuals with different perspectives to encourage an exchange of ideas and foster innovation in an industrially diverse environment.&lt;ref name="economy"/&gt;

Developed in 1969 by urbanist [[Jane Jacobs]] and  John Jackson&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=JohnJackson {{!}} Profile |url=http://media.cla.auburn.edu/economics/people/display.cfm?PersonID=2749 |work=Auburn University Department of Economics Staff Profile |accessdate=28 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501124426/http://media.cla.auburn.edu/economics/people/display.cfm?PersonID=2749 |archivedate= 1 May 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  the concept that [[Detroit]]’s shipbuilding industry from the 1830s was the critical antecedent leading to the 1890s development of the auto industry in Detroit since the [[gasoline engine]] firms easily transitioned from building gasoline engines for ships to building them for automobiles.&lt;ref name="economy"/&gt;

==Policy implications==
As information is largely [[Rivalry (economics)|non-rival]] in nature, certain measures must{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} be taken to ensure that, for the originator, the information remains a private [[asset]].  As the market cannot do this efficiently, public [[regulations]] have been implemented to facilitate a more appropriate [[Economic equilibrium|equilibrium]].

As a result, the concept of [[intellectual property rights]] have developed and ensure the ability of entrepreneurs to temporarily hold on to the profitability of their ideas through [[patent]]s, [[copyright]]s, and other governmental safeguards.  Conversely, such barriers to entry prevent the exploitation of informational developments by rival firms within an industry.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

On the other hand, when the research and development of a private firm results in a social benefit, unaccounted for within the market price, often greater than the private return of the firm’s research, then a [[subsidy]] to offset the underproduction of that benefit might be offered to the firm in return for its continued output of that benefit.  Government subsidies are often controversial, and while they might often result in a more appropriate social equilibrium, they could also lead to undesirable political repercussions as such a subsidy must come from taxpayers, some of whom may not directly benefit from the researching firm’s subsidized knowledge spillover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosen|first=Harvey S.|title=Public Finance 9th Ed.|year=2010|publisher=McGraw Hill|location=New York City|isbn=978-0-07-351135-1|pages=103–104}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of knowledge spillover is also used to justify subsidies to [[foreign direct investment]], as foreign investors help diffuse technology among local firms.&lt;ref name="spillovers"&gt;Tomas Havranek and Zuzana Irsova, [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jinteco.2011.07.004 "Estimating vertical spillovers from FDI: Why results vary and what the true effect is"], Journal of International Economics, 2011 Vol. 85, No. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lillian Friedman Astor''' (born April 12, 1912 in [[New York City]]&amp;nbsp;– July 9, 1989) was the first American female studio animator, working at for the [[Fleischer Studios|Fleischer Brothers' studio]], [[inker|inking]] and eventually animating various [[Betty Boop]] cartoons, as well as one [[Popeye]], some Color Classics, and several [[Hunky and Spunky]] cartoons, although she received screen credit on only six cartoons in her lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;''Who's Who in Animated Cartoons: An International Guide to Film &amp; Television's Award-Winning and Legendary Animators'', by Jeff Lenburg, pp. 95–97&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11313">This is a '''list of American prime time animated television series''' which were typically broadcast during [[prime time]].  This list does not include animated short films and videos that were shown on television variety shows, such as "[[The Ambiguously Gay Duo]]" on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' and "[[The Tracy Ullman Show#Dr. N!Godatu|Dr. N!Godatu]]" on ''[[The Tracy Ullman Show]]''. However, the fact ''[[The Simpsons]]'' originated as part of the latter show is noted.

==History==   
The Marina began life as a skating rink and was converted to a theatre in 1878 by architect R.F. Brett. In 1901, architect Ernest Runtz was hired to rebuild the theatre, using parts of the existing structure.&lt;ref name="treasures"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cinematreasures.org/theater/19949/|title=Marina Theatre|work=Cinema Treasures|accessdate=28 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Marina was largely rebuilt once again in 1930 by architect Francis Burdett, and re-opened as a cinema by [[Associated British Cinemas]]. It was closed in 1984 and eventually purchased by [[Waveney District Council]] in 1988.&lt;ref name="treasures" /&gt; It reopened in October, 1988 almost four years after its closure.&lt;ref name="treasures" /&gt;  It is believed the site was once part of the original Grove Estate and the remodelling in 1901 allowed for a gallery seating area possibly in a horseshoe shape with boxes. The remodelling during 1930 saw the creation of a new dress circle. 

The theatre was threatened with in 2010 due to financial pressures on the local council.&lt;ref name="BBC News" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ljdodd" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc2010"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/suffolk/8502790.stm|title=Council considers future of Marina Theatre in Lowestoft|work=BBC News|date=2010-02-07|accessdate=2011-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2011 the council handed over management to the newly formed charitable Marina Theatre Trust for a period of 15 years whilst retaining ownership of the building.{{cn|date=February 2012}} The Marina Theatre Trust is a registered charity number 1149133 and was formed following a successful tender by the venues award-winning management team. Leading experts from within the theatre industry, local business people and people from the local community form the board of trustees. The Friends Of The Marina Theatre acts as a voluntary support to the venue providing some  fundraising and volunteer labour.

The Marina Theatre Trust took over the running of the Marina Theatre on 1 December 2011 and in Summer 2012 oversaw a major refurbishment and renovation of the main auditorium. The much maligned local authority colour scheme of green and brown was replaced with a mixture of blues, grey and gold. Many of the previously covered mouldings and features were revealed and restored.  The entire seating was restored and reupholstered in dark blue with several of the cast  iron seats being recast to match those thought to be original and some thought to have been rescued from the former Lowestoft Odeon Cinema. Improvements to leg room in the rear stalls were also made and the venue capacity increased to 800 seats. New auditorium carpeting was included within the project. The former 1960s ABC cinema house lights were replaced with Art Deco style chandeliers and fixed lamps. A new lighting position was installed in the roof above the auditorium and digital speakers replaced those previously sited either side of the proscenium. During the refurbishment several mouldings were restored or replaced including those either side of the front stalls. It was found at the time that the theatre is approx one inch lower to the left of the stalls than to the right.

In June 2012 the Trust also secured a lease on three storey premises adjacent to the theatre - once part of the former Cosalt  Works, the building had been rebuilt and remodelled in the early 1990s and was occupied by a double glazing companies call centre. The new premises allowed the Marina Theatre to expand its catering facilities substantially with the creation of a new ground floor cafe and gallery and to relocate its box office from the previously cramped theatre foyer. A new community space has since been created on the first floor of the new premises and the venues administrative office has also located to the second floor. 

The new cafe and gallery opened  at the same time as the refurbished auditorium in September 2013. A successful public appeal enabled the Trust to construct a steel and glass link between the main theatre and new building which opened in November 2012. By obtaining the new premises the venue was also able to construct a new stage access for loading with lorries now able to unload direct to the scenery dock door off Battery Green Rd therefore the previous problem of access for large shows having to come via the front and side entrance has been solved.

In 2013 the Trust substantially upgraded the Cinema from 35mm projection to Digital. A new screen - one of the largest in the region was installed along with new digital Dolby sound. The Marina also commenced live screenings utilising the new equipment in autumn 2013 and now presents live broadcasts of performances including those from the Bolshoi Ballet, National Theatre, Royal Shakespeare Company and Royal Opera House, amongst others. The 35mm projector used from 1988 to 2013 is now on display in the theatre cafe &amp; gallery.

In 2017 the freehold ownership of the Marina Theatre passed from Waveney District Council to the newly formed Lowestoft Town Council. In 2018 The Lowestoft Town Council purchased the three storey building housing the cafe, community room and offices further securing the future for the Theatre's Trust Lease on the building.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lowestoftjournal.co.uk/news/marina-theatre-future-secured-after-200-000-loan-approved-1-5505792&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Medieval Chronicle Society''' is an international and interdisciplinary organization founded to facilitate the work of scholars interested in medieval [[annals]] and [[chronicle]]s, or more generally medieval [[historiography]].&lt;ref&gt;Albrecht Classen, ''Handbook of Medieval Studies'', 2010, p.1719.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For press reports on the Society see for example ''Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagzeitung'', 22 May 2011, p.63.&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded in 1999 and in February 2011 had 380 members.

==Aims and history==
Annals and chronicles were the main genres of historical writing in the [[Middle Ages]]. Consequently, they have always been of great importance to [[historians]].  The extent to which they are also of interest to students of [[medieval literature]] or of [[historical linguistics]] was only fully realised in the latter part of the 20th century.  Since many chronicles are illustrated, they are also a fruitful object of study for [[art history|art historians]].  It was the desire for a forum in which these disciplines could operate together that led to the foundation of the society.

The history of the society began with a series of triennial conferences initially in [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]], but later moving from place to place.  These early conferences were hosted by Erik Kooper (English studies, Utrecht).  It was at the second of these conferences, in 1999, that the society was formally founded.

The society maintains a website financed by the University of Liverpool, and publishes a regular newsletter with information on recent publications in the chronicles field.

==Journal ''The Medieval Chronicle''==
[[File:MedievalChronicle4.jpg|150px|right|The journal ''The Medieval Chronicle'']]
Volumes of proceedings of the first three conferences were published by Rodopi.&lt;ref&gt;''The Medieval Chronicle'' volumes 1–3, [[Rodopi (publisher)|Rodopi]], 1999–2004.&lt;/ref&gt;  When the society was founded, this triennial publication was transformed into a yearbook, now the peer-reviewed journal ''The Medieval Chronicle''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Medieval Chronicle'' volumes 4– , [[Rodopi (publisher)|Rodopi]], 2006– , ISSN 1567-2336.&lt;/ref&gt;

The journal is trilingual, with articles in English, French and German. As well as the proceedings of the society's conferences, and also of the Cambridge Chronicle Symposium, the journal includes research submitted independently of the conferences. A number of text editions of chronicles have also been published here.

The ''EMC'' contains around 2500 usually quite short articles on individual authors or on anonymous works. A majority of these are from Western Christendom, but there are also entries on Slavic, Byzantine, Syriac, Islamic and Jewish chronicles. These give information on the date, language, form and manuscript tradition, and discuss issues which have been highlighted in recent scholarship. There are also about 60 longer "thematic" articles on particular aspects of chronicles. The two-volume paper edition appeared in 2010 and runs to around 1830 pages, with about 60 black-and-white full-page illustrations. About 450 scholars collaborated in writing it. An electronic edition with additional articles appeared in 2012; an update with significant expansions appeared in 2016.

The '''Mural paintings of the Conquest of Majorca''' is a group of paintings conserved at the [[National Art Museum of Catalonia]], in [[Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;Guide of the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya. MNAC, 2004. {{ISBN|84-8043-136-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
The mural paintings of the [[Conquest of Majorca]] come from the former ancestral home of the Caldes family in [[Carrer Montcada]] in [[Barcelona]], a building later known as [[Palau Aguilar]] (now hosting [[Museu Picasso]]). 
Discovered and removed in 1961, these paintings are one of the most important examples of early or Linear Gothic Catalan painting. This magnificent example of painting on historical subject matter narrates the conquest of the island of [[Majorca]] by [[James I the Conqueror]] in 1229. Like a painted chronicle, the episodes follow the detailed narrative of Catalan medieval accounts such as King James I's '[[Llibre dels fets|Llibre dels Feits]]' and [[Bernat Desclot]]'s ''Crònica''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://art.mnac.cat/fitxatecnica.html;jsessionid=47ebcd8e6d370c6926ffc938f57f3dd871295ffedac166160908977bcfde952b?inventoryNumber=071447-CJT The artwork at MNAC's Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pictorial Context ==
With regard to linear Gothic paintings in Catalan Counties at the time, a workshop began in Barcelona which undertook the task of realising fresco paintings on the walls of various palaces in the city. The most important of these resulting works can be named as: the paintings at Tinell Hall (Saló Tinell), the Royal Palace ([[Palau Reial Mayor]]) and Palau Aguilar.[[File:Pintura mural del saló del tinell - Nunó Sanç a la conquesta de Mallorca.jpg|thumb|Detail of the Mural - [[Nunó Sanç]]]]
The frescoes were in no doubt executed by a workshop which realised commissions for Kings [[Alfonso III of Aragon|Alfonso the Candid]] (Alfonso el Franc) and [[James II of Aragon|James the Just]] (Jaume el Just), the nobility and clergy from both Barcelona and Majorca. Similarities are noted between the aforementioned palaces and the altarpiece of [[Santa Perpètua de Mogoda]], Palma de Majorca, the altarpiece of Saint Ursula of the convent of Saint Francis, Palma, and the altarpiece of Saint Bernard, realised for the Templers and today on display in the Museum of Majorca.

It is believed that the first commission of the murals in Barcelona was by the King and some nobles and afterwards, by religious authorities on the island of Majorca.
Dalmaes i Pitrarch was also of the same opinion in relation to the workshop that ‘after working in Barcelona, made its way to Mallorca in 1300'. [[File:Valladolid monasterio Valbuena 36 iglesia pintura gotica lou.jpg|thumb|left| Detail of a mural conserved in the monastery of Santa María de Valbuena]]

Throughout the Iberian Peninsula these murals display a level of similarity and so have been compared to the paintings found in the [[Valbuena Abbey|Monastery of Santa Maria de Valbuena]] in Valladolid, which represents the Conquest of Arjona in 1244.

== Theme ==
[[File:Llibre-dels-Feyts-XXVIIr.jpg|thumb|Llibre del Feits]]
The theme present in the narration of the conquest of Majorca 1229 is based on the literary sources of two of the greatest Catalan chronicles: the Llibre dels Feits and the Chronicle of Bernat Desclot, the latter having been written in 1283 and its final chapter between the years 1285 and 1295. These dates are around the same time as the completion of the mural paintings and during a time when Bernat Desclot held position as an official to the Royal Court.

=== Conquest of Majorca ===
A group of Catalan dignitaries, led by James I (Jaume I), met at the home of Pere Martell in the city of [Tarragona] during the second half of November 1228, in order to prepare for the conquest of Majorca.
On 23 December 1228 the Courts gathered in Barcelona and after three days of deliberation, they agreed on the proposed expedition. The next year, on 5 September 1229, the Catalan ships set sail from Salou, Cambrils and Tarragona with course for landing at Santa Ponsa (Santa Ponça). 
Just one week later, on 12 September, the Moors were defeated during the battle of Portopí. 
On 31 December, after three months of a siege, the Catalan troops conquered Madina Mayurqa Abu-I-Ulà Idrís al-Mamun. This crusade was led by James I of Aragon and resulted in the destruction of the [[Almohad]] power on the island, the enslavement of the Andalus population and the repopulation of the island with Christians under a feudal regime and, the creation of the Kingdom of Majorca.

== Palau Aguilar ==
[[File:Pati interior del Palau Aguilar (3).jpg|thumb|left|Interior Patio of Palau Aguilar]]
The palace where the paintings were discovered was constructed during the second half of the 13th century by the merchant Bernat de Caldes, who gave the building its initial title ‘Palau de Caldes’. 
It is situated at number 15 Montcada Street in Barcelona, in one of the main locations of the medieval old town, in a district named Arenas or [[Santa Maria del Mar, Barcelona|Santa Maria del Mar]].
In the same room in the palace where the mural paintings were discovered a pot was also kept, depicting the family crest of the owners. 
Later, when the property changed owners, according to custom, the coat of arms of the new proprietors was painted on the pot, this time a lily and a rose on a tree – emblem of the Ledó family who owned the property between 1317 and 1335.
The building belonged to several nobles of the Court of Aragon, until 1386 when the bourgeois family Coromines-Desplà acquired it and later sold it to Joan Berenguer d’Aguilar, for whom it became known by its current name, Palau Aguilar or Palau de Berenguer d’Aguilar.

When the Palau became municipal property from the year 1953 and while it was under restoration in 1961, for its future use as the home of the Picasso Museum, the mural paintings were discovered in a room near the central patio of the palace.

== Description ==
The three panels of paintings realised in the fresco technique and now found in MNAC, where they were translated to canvas for their conservation, are of a style categorised as 'linear gothic' and dated between 1285 and 1290.
They were restored in 1961 and although there are fragments missing, it is recognised that the series depicts three scenes; ‘the meeting of the Counts of Barcelona’, ‘the Battle of Porto Pi’ and the ‘Royal Camp and assault on the city of Majorca¡.
[[File:Corts-barcelona-desembre-1228.jpg|thumb|The meeting of the counts in Barcelona, December 1228]]
The composition of the work displays a Romanesque tendency, although there is a distinct realism in the details of the work and the background of the scenes have been treated with details of landscape, rather than being a flat pictorial space. Together with the interest shown in treating the figures with expression and representing portraits, there is an apparent trend and interest in a Franco-gothic style of painting.
The first panel where the narration commences – from left to right- is identified as the ‘Courts of Barcelona’. The representation is observed in the depiction of the walls of Barcelona, from which rise the bell tower of the cathedral. There is also group of people depicted, which probably corresponds to the meeting of parliament which was held in December 1228 to decide the details of the military assault on Majorca.
Fragments of a painting are also seen which may correspond to the scene of a naval battle.
[[File:Guillem-bearn-montcada-mallorca-1229.jpg|thumb|left|Detail of Guillem II de Montcada i de Bearn]]
The second panel corresponds to the depiction of the ‘Battle of Porto Pi’. On 11 September 1229 James I diploid his troops in the Bay of Santa Ponsa, that same day the decisive battle of Portopí against the Muslims took place. The background of the panel is rendered with mountains and trees, in the mountains a group of Moors are depicted whereas in the foreground the battle is observed, the battle in which Guillem II de Montcada i de Bearn met his death. He is shown riding his horse and brandishing a sword and shield where the coat of arms of his lineage appear; the bessants of Montcada and the oxen of Bearn, which are also found represented on his horses’ [[caparison]]. Gillem II is being pursued by an unidentified knight, heading towards the Saracen troops; as found in the description of these events chronicled by Bernat Desclot.

[[File:Kuba1..jpg|thumb|left|Detail of the Royal Tent with King Jaume I]]
The final panel shows the ‘Royal Camp and the attack on the city of Majorca’. The camp is shown on the right hand side with the royal tent of yellow and red. James I is depicted in the foreground, represented in the centre of a group of knights. On James I's left stand three representatives, one of which has been identified as Nunó Sanç, count of Roselló. To the right hand side King Guilabert de Cruïlles is depicted, wearing a red helmet with a white cross and his hand resting on the knee of King James I. The bishop of Barcelona stands to the right of Guilabert shown wearing his mitre, and to his side the knight Ramon de Centells is found. The tent situated to the left of the King’s, with the horizontal red stripes, is that of the Count of Empurias Hug V d’Empúries, who is found conversing with the Aragonese knight Pero Maça de Sangarrén. They are shown separated from the other group and the King this representation being true to the accounts which tell of  the Count d’Empúries’ disagreement with King James I. 
The spaces between the two depicted tents and the figures of the composition were filled with the suggestion of other tents, creating the pictorial notion of a vast army camp.
The assault on Medina Mayurqa is represented beneath the depiction of the royal tent. Here what could be described as a trebuchet is depicted and to its side a group of soldiers who are heading towards the city who find themselves clashing with a group of Saracens.
A wall with towers surrounding a city full of houses, in the centre of which the castle of Almundaina can be seen, protected by a double wall.

The nearest tower to the camp has been assaulted by two men bearing the Royal crest and who are shown fighting against two Moors, whilst the other towers depicted in the distance are still being defended by the Saracens.

== Style==
These paintings pertain to the military genre of historical painting or profane works in commemoration of heroic feats and gestures. A similar example of the same era is a painting found on a vaulted niche conserved in MNAC, belonging to Saint Vincent of Cardona, where the siege of Girona (1285)/ The defense of Girona (1285) is depicted. This event was also described in the chronicles of Bernat Desclot. It is one the works that could be attributed to the master of the Conquest of Majorca. A little later, during the beginning of the 14th century, there are other works in a similar style of linear gothic which are found in the tower of the castle of Alcanyís, which portray the Conquest of Valencia by James I.
The stylistic affinity is clear when these paintings are compared with the murals of the Palau Reial Major; both date from between 1285 and 1290, and both of which, in addition to the same subject, were realised using the majority of colours of red, blue, black and ochre, with a linear stroke deeply marked in black.
This narrative of the painting is depicted in reverse to that of its written version, that is, from right to left, with great affinity in its narrative.
There has been no conclusion as to which of the two series of paintings was realised first; that of the Palau Reail Major or, that of the Palau Aguilar.
That of the Palau Reial Major may have been the first to be painted as the style of the work is found to be more epic and monumental in its representation of the military parades; the figures being depicted as more compact than those found in the work of Palau Aguilar.
The work of Palau Aguilar more creative freedom can be observed, a creative freedom that perhaps would not have been apt for the destiny as a mural for a royal reception hall.
The coincidence that these murals were executed in the same style and subject matter in both palaces was resolved with the discovery that Dolçe de Caldes, daughter of Bernat de Caldes (owner of Palau Aguiler), at the time of the death of King [[Alfonso III of Aragon|Alfonso the Candid]], was pregnant with Alfonso's child. The King, before his death in 1291, asked his brother James (future king [[James II of Aragon|James the Just]]) to look after Dolçe and the son she was expecting by King Alfonso.

=== Iconography ===
The iconography which illustrated military chronicles or legendary tales was numerous in the 13th century, like that of [Lancelot] by [Chrétien de Troyes] or the fresco paintings which adorned the palaces of noble knights who wished to remain immortalised in their heroic exploits. Moreover, in Barcelona, there existed a narrative of the battle of [William the Orange] at the Tour Ferrando in Pernes (Valdusa) and another example from a little later being the mural painting in the Piazza Publico of Siena in which Capitan Guidoricco da Fogliano is represented as conqueror of the city – a work which was realised by Simone Martini.

The '''National Institute on Media and the Family''' ('''NIMF'''), founded by psychologist [[David Walsh (psychologist)|David Walsh]] in 1996 and closed in 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.1up.com/news/national-institute-media-family-closing |title=1up.com |access-date=2010-09-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016091843/http://www.1up.com/news/national-institute-media-family-closing |archive-date=2012-10-16 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[nonprofit organization]] based in [[Minneapolis]], [[Minnesota]]. It was a nonsectarian [[advocacy group]] which sought to monitor [[mass media]] for content that it deemed is harmful to children and families. The group characterized itself as "an international resource center for cutting-edge research and information" and denied playing any role in media [[censorship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mediafamily.org/about/index.shtml |title= Who We Are |accessdate=2007-01-16 |publisher= National Institute on Media and the Family |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061228181421/http://www.mediafamily.org/about/index.shtml &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== MediaWise movement ==
The '''MediaWise''' movement is the publicity and community outreach arm of the NIMF. Through it the organization sponsors speaking engagements given by its staff throughout the country, although most events take place at educational and religious institutions in the state of [[Minnesota]]. David Walsh is notable as the spokesperson for the NIMF, having given numerous interviews to national news programs and newspapers in this capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mediafamily.org/about/biodavew.shtml |title= David Walsh, Ph.D. Bio |accessdate=2007-01-16 |publisher= National Institute on Media and the Family |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061209104445/http://www.mediafamily.org/about/biodavew.shtml &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Video Game Report Cards ===
The primary publication of the MediaWise movement is an annual report on the marketing, distribution, and impact of video games to minors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mediafamily.org/research/vgrc_index.shtml |title= Video Game Report Cards |accessdate= 2007-01-16 |publisher= National Institute on Media and the Family |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070116170309/http://www.mediafamily.org/research/vgrc_index.shtml |archivedate= 2007-01-16 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; This "Video Game Report Card" comprises results to national surveys, summaries of recently completed research projects, and a [[Academic grading in North America|grade]]-based assessment of the [[Entertainment Software Association]]'s efforts to regulate the sales of video games to minors.

The 2005 MediaWise Video Game Report Card criticized the [[Entertainment Software Rating Board]]'s system of rating video games for age-appropriate conduct in its annual series of report cards, noting the scarcity of "Adults-Only" rated games and citing the perceived inadequacy in retailer enforcement. Several days after the report was released, the [[Parent-Teacher Association|United States National Parent Teacher Association]] issued a press release condemning it, stating that "[the report card] contained erroneous statements about National PTA's position on the Entertainment Software Rating Board's (ESRB) rating system. In fact, National PTA does not endorse NIMF's report. Further, it does not agree with the report's characterization of ESRB and its rating system."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.pta.org/ne_press_release_detail_1133460190390.html | title = National PTA Statement on Video Game Report Card | accessdate = 2006-10-14 | date = 2005-12-01 | work = pta.org }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies ==

In 2005 the NIMF made the controversial claim that the video game industry was promoting cannibalism after analyzing stills and video clips from a [[zombie]]-themed game titled ''[[Stubbs the Zombie in Rebel Without a Pulse]]''. Dr. Walsh was asked about this in a podcast interview with Dennis McCauley, owner of [[gamepolitics.com]]. During the interview Dr. Walsh did not acknowledge the NIMF's apparent error, instead claiming that video gamers tricked him into thinking there was cannibalism in the game.

In late 2003 Walsh proposed the coining of a [[neologism]] to fill what he sees is a gap in English vocabulary: ''killographic'', to be defined as the "graphic depiction of brutal violence."  This is intended as an analogy to "[[pornography|pornographic]]", which he defines as the "graphic depiction of sexual acts".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.mediafamily.org/mediawisecolumns/ke_mw.shtml | title = Killographic Entertainment | accessdate = 2006-09-02 | last = Walsh | first = David | authorlink=Dr. David Walsh |date = 2003 | publisher = National Institute on Media and the Family |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061213144323/http://www.mediafamily.org/mediawisecolumns/ke_mw.shtml &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This term has been the subject of considerable public debate.  Doug Lowenstein, head of the [[Entertainment Software Association]], described it as a "clever phrase", but noted that the average age of video gamers is 28, and that "as adults they should be allowed to pick their entertainment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.cnn.com/2003/TECH/fun.games/12/09/warning.videogames.reut/index.html | title = Group warns parents about 'killographic' games | accessdate = 2006-09-02 | date = 2003-12-09 | work = [[CNN.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 6, 2005, The ESRB assigned a failing grade of "F" to NIMF for its seriously flawed Video Game Report Card released the previous week.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esrb.org/about/news/12062005.jsp ESRB gives NIMFa failing grade]&lt;/ref&gt;  The ESRB cited inaccuracies, incomplete and misleading statements, omission of material facts, and flawed research as key factors in assigning the failing grade. In addition to the overall failing grade, NIMF was given a demerit for elevating its political and media agenda over their stated concerns for consumer welfare, particularly those of kids and teens.

'''OPEN LOOK''' is a major annual [[contemporary dance]] festival presented by Dance House [http://www.kannondance.ru/school_e.php "Kannon Dance"] in [[Saint Petersburg|St.Petersburg, Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sptimesrussia.com/index.php?action_id=2&amp;story_id=18093 The St.Petersburg Times, Issue #1182 (48), Friday, June 30, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; The festival is an international event offering training and performance programs that cover a wide range of contemporary dance forms. 
 
Established in 1999 as a means to introduce new audiences to dance and held each summer during the beautiful St.-Petersburg [http://www.saint-petersburg.com/virtual-tour/whitenights.asp White Nights], it gathers hundreds of professional dancers, choreographers and teachers from all over the world for a two-week program of performance and intensive workshops by well known dance masters. '''OPEN LOOK''' presents a concert program featuring performers from abroad and Russia on several stages of St.-Petersburg. 

The main aim of the festival is to share the best of Western culture with Russian public and dance society, to provide atmosphere and space for international artistic collaboration, knowledge, experience exchange, creative work, and education. Born in the West, contemporary dance is quite a new thing to Russia that has been for a long time thriving on classical tradition in arts and especially dance. However, contemporary dance draws more and more attention and public interest here and develops intensively.

'''Overlay architecture''', or '''Overlay''', is "event [[architecture]]", such as the temporary elements that are added to more permanent buildings to enable the operation of major [[sporting event]]s or [[festival]]s. These elements provide additional facilities for the duration of an event and are generally of a lightweight construction, as they are often removed afterwards.

==Use==
The role of overlay is extensive and can cover all aspects of a major event, starting with the "back of house" user groups, including staff, operations, officials, [[broadcast]], [[Mass media|media]], hospitality, [[VIP]]s and the athletes themselves. These groups all require physical facilities to provide [[accreditation]], accommodation, segregation and [[wayfinding]], which need to be separated from, but connected to, the spectators at the "front of house", to preserve the magic and mystery of the event experience.
It is important that the overlay design is integrated into the masterplan of major events at an early stage, in order that the flow of people through the site can be effectively managed and sufficient space provided for the various overlay facilities.  
The overlay design also has a significant role in helping to define the overall environment of a major event. By taking a design-inclusive approach and considering the cultural and design aspects alongside the commercial and functional requirements, memorable places and spaces can be created out of simple components and hired commodities.

==Overlay categories==
Overlay can be categorised in three main ways: 

* '''Existing facilities''': the overlay consists of temporary elements being added to an existing space to accommodate the specific needs of an event (e.g. the [[Excel Centre]], or the [[Archery]] range at [[Lord's Cricket Ground]]) 
* '''New facilities''': the overlay consists of temporary elements that are integrated with permanent elements in a new facility or venue for an event (e.g. the [[Olympic Stadium]])
* '''Temporary facilities''': the overlay creates a completely temporary facility or venue for an event (e.g. the [[Beach Volleyball]] court at [[Horse Guards Parade]], or the [[Equestrianism|Equestrian]] Centre at [[Greenwich Park]])

===Origin and History===
[[File:Pattachitra - Archaeological Activities Exhibition - Directorate of Archaeology &amp; Museums - West Bengal - Kolkata 2014-09-14 7907.JPG|thumb|Archaeological activities exhibition of [[West Bengal|Bengal]] Patachitra]]
Patachitra is known for its excellent play of colour. It is a traditional folk art form of rural Bengal. There are some controversial opinions about the dates of ancient Patas. But it has been suggested on the basis of historical themes connected with the accompanied songs like [[Patua Sangeet]]. It dates back to the Pre- Pala period  which is still tucked away with small villages of [[Midnapore]], [[Bankura]], [[Purulia]], [[Howrah]], [[Hooghly district|Hooghly]] and [[24 Parganas]]. Bengal Patachitra is referred to in the ''Buddhist literature'' in 1st century A.D., in ''Haribansha'' in 2nd century, in ''Abhigyanashakuntalam'' and ''Malavikagnimitra'' in 4th century, ''Harshacharita'' and ''Uttararamacharita'' in 6th and 7th-8th centuries respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Roy Niranjan (1973), The Patas and Patuas of Bengal. Indian Publications Calcutta, Page number 54-55 (Annexure C,V)&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book '''Folk Art of Bengal''', author ''Ajitcoomar Mookerjee''  has mentioned that there are some Jadu-Patuas painting of mural style in the temples of [[Bankura district|Bankura District]].&lt;ref&gt;Mookerjee Ajitcoomar (1939), Folk Art of Bengal. university of calcutta, Page number 18-19 (Annexure C.Vll)&lt;/ref&gt;

Secular pots depicts important news events, scandals accidents etc such as bus accidents at Narayangarh, rural elections, the rationing system, family planning, evils of the dowry system etc. Every Patachitra has a song related to it, which the artists sing while unfurling the Patachitra. Singing pot in Bengal is called [[Patua Sangeet]]. Patua Sangeet or Poter Gan is a cultural tradition of the singing Bengal Patachitra. It is performed by [[Patua]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Bangiyo Loko-Sangeet Ratnakosh|last=Sri Ashutosh Bhattacharya|first=|publisher=Paschimbanga Loko Sanskriti Gobeshona Kendra|year=|isbn=|location=Kolkata|pages=1041}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is famous in the village part of [[West Bengal]] like [[Birbhum]], [[Jhargram]], [[Bardhaman]] and [[Murshidabad]] as a folk song of [[West Bengal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://chitrolekha.com/myths-and-folktales-patachitra/|title=Myths and Folktales in the Patachitra Art of Bengal: Tradition and Modernity - The Chitrolekha Journal on Art and Design|date=2015-08-02|work=The Chitrolekha Journal on Art and Design|access-date=2018-05-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Durga pot or Durga sara is recognised as the worshiped patachitra. It worshiped in the ''Hatsarandi Sutradhar society'' of [[Birbhum district]] on Durga puja time. This type of patachitra is also worshiped is [[Katwa]]. Durga Pot has a semi-circular Patachitra where Patachitra of Durga is in the middle position. Ram, Sita, Shib, Nandi-Vringi, Brahma, Vishnu, Shumbha-Nishumbha are painted on this kind of Chalchitra. [[Krishnanagar, Nadia|Krishnanager]] Rajrajeshwari Durga is seen to be uniquely noticed. In the middle of the Chalchitra, there is Panchanan Shib and Parvati is beside him, on one side there is Dasha-mahabidya and the other side, there is [[Dashavatara|Dashabatar]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.anandabazar.com/state/%E0%A6%85%E0%A6%AC%E0%A6%95-%E0%A6%B7%E0%A7%9F-%E0%A6%86%E0%A6%B0-%E0%A6%85%E0%A6%AC%E0%A6%B2-%E0%A6%AA-%E0%A6%A4-%E0%A6%B0-%E0%A6%AE-%E0%A6%9D-%E0%A6%AC-%E0%A6%B2-%E0%A6%B0-%E0%A6%9A-%E0%A6%B2%E0%A6%9A-%E0%A6%A4-%E0%A6%B0-1.74260|title=অবক্ষয় আর অবলুপ্তির মাঝে বাংলার চালচিত্র - Anandabazar|last=ভট্টাচার্য|first=বিভূতিসুন্দর|work=anandabazar.com|access-date=2018-04-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Technique===
The Patachitra a of different districts of [[West Bengal]] are characterized by many peculiarities in colour and design. The patachitra of [[Manbhum]], now known as [[Purulia district|Purulia]] can easily be distinguished by their preference for one particular shade of burnt sienna relieved by white and yellow patches and densely packed composition. The seated figures of [[Dasaratha]] and [[Chand Sadagar]] of [[Medinipur]] crowning the [[Ramayana]] and Kamale-Kamini scrolls are impressive and monumental.&lt;ref&gt;Craft council of west Bengal-1985-86, The Jarana Patachitra of Bengal- Mahamaya, p-112&lt;/ref&gt; In the scrolls of pot of [[Birbhum district|Birbhum]], [[Bankura district|Bankura]] and [[Burdwan district|Burdwan]] preference for Indian red background usually found, the scrolls of [[Hooghly district|Hooghly]] preferred a dark brown. The [[Hooghly district|Hooghly]] and [[Manbhum]] 'pats' are peculiar and definitely modernistic with the abstract linear treatment.&lt;ref&gt;D. P. Ghosh, FOLK ART OF BENGAL, Visvabharati, p-4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colour===
Use of natural color is one of the individual characteristics of the Bengal Patachitra. In general, blue, [[yellow]], [[green]], [[red]], [[brown]], [[black]] and [[white]] are used in the Patachitra of [[West Bengal]]. Chalk dust is used for white color, pauri for yellow color, cultivated indigo for blue, bhushakali for black and mete sindur for red color.&lt;ref&gt;http://ipindiaservices.gov.in/GI_DOC/564/564%20-%20Statement%20of%20Case%20-%2017-08-2016.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Odisha Pattachitra ==
Pattachitra is a traditional painting of Odisha, India.&lt;ref name="odisha.gov.in"&gt;http://odisha.gov.in/e-magazine/Orissareview/2010/November/engpdf/46-48.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; These paintings are based on [[Hindu mythology]] and specially inspired by [[Jagannath]] and [[Vaishnava]] sect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Patta Chitra|url=http://www.odisha.gov.in/portal/ViewDetails.asp?vchglinkid=GL010&amp;vchplinkid=PL060&amp;vchslinkid=SL036}}&lt;/ref&gt;  All colours used in the Paintings are natural and paintings are made fully old traditional way by Chitrakaras that is Oriya Painter. Pattachitra style of painting is one of the oldest and most popular art forms of Odisha. The name Pattachitra has evolved from the Sanskrit words patta, meaning canvas, and chitra, meaning picture. Pattachitra is thus a painting done on canvas, and is manifested by rich colourful application, creative motifs and designs, and portrayal of simple themes, mostly mythological in depiction.&lt;ref&gt;http://india.gov.in/knowindia/pattachitra.php&lt;/ref&gt; The traditions of pattachitra paintings are more than thousand years old.&lt;ref&gt;http://craftorissa.com/b2c/product_info.php?products_id=112{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archive.india.gov.in/knowindia/culture_heritage.php?id=106|title=Pattachitra Painting|publisher=archive.india.gov.in}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Origin and History ===
The paintings of Orissa can be divided into three categories from the point of view of medium, i.e. paintings on cloth or 'Patta Chitra', paintings on walls or 'Bhitti Chitra' and palm leaf engravings or "Tala Patra Chitra' or "Pothi, Chitra'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unnatisilks.com/patachitra-introduction-indian-crafts.html|title=Crafts of India -Patachitra - Introduction|last=|first=|date=|website=Unnati Silks|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The style of all these remains more or less the same at a specific time because the then artists were commissioned to work in all these media, it is believed.

The painting the 'pattachitra' resemble the old murals of Odisha especially religious centres of [[Puri]], [[Konark]] and  [[Bhubaneshwar]] region, dating back to the 5th century BC. The best work is found in and around Puri, especially in the village of [[Raghurajpur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paramparik-karigar.org/bystates/pattachitra.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110227115716/http://www.paramparik-karigar.org/bystates/pattachitra.html |archivedate=2011-02-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This old tradition of Odia painting still survives in the places like Puri, Raghurajpur, [[Paralakhemundi]], Chikiti and [[Sonepur, Odisha|Sonepur]].In the past professionerise, there was no distinct separation between the master painters and master sculptors; so the possibility of a simultaneous origin of painting and sculptural art in Odisha can not be ruled out. Even today in Odisha, these two crafts are combined in one and these artists and known as Chitrakaras, their title remains mostly Mohapatra or Maharana. Strangely enough, painting appeared in Odisha rather later, several centuries after the construction of the great temples of Bhubaneswar, Puri and Konark.here exists a good number of paintings from 18th century onwards in many temples and Mathas especially in the southern districts of Odisha. Lord Jagannath in the present from is being taken as the origin of the Patta style. The colour schemes of the deities of Puri are quite similar to those of the Patta style. The oldest record of Patta Paintings does not probably go beyond the establishment of the present shrine of Shri Jagannath at Puri. It may be due to the fact that paintings do not survive like sculptures. The paints inside the shrines of Lord Jagannath at Puri make the date probable. The oldest classical marble paintings of Sitabanji at [[Keonjhar]] do not conform to the present style of Patta painting wholly. The wooden statues of the three deities are also covered with cloth and then overlaid with glue mixed with chalk, and then given paint only with four limited colours of red, yellow, white and black. The deities who are held in high esteem by the Odias and who inspire religion, life and activity of the people also carry with them a tradition of art and painting which is as old as the deities themselves. If the Savara origin of Jagannath is accepted, the date of the Patta paintings can be dated back to an earlier period. These paintings were originally substitutes for worship on days when the temple doors were shut for the 'ritual bath' of the deity.

[[File:Patta Chitra 02.jpg|thumb|centre|600px|Pattachitra are based on [[Hindu Mythology]]. Depicted here is a parade of the god [[Ganesha]].]]

=== Theme and Style ===
The theme of Odia painting centres round the [[Jagannath]] and the [[Vaishnava]] sect. Since beginning of Pattachitra culture, Lord [[Jagannath]] who was an incarnation of Lord [[Krishna]] has been the major source of inspiration. The subject matter of Patta Chitra is mostly mythological, religious stories and [[folk lore]]. Themes are chiefly on Lord Jagannath and [[Radha]]-[[Krishna]], different "Vesas" of Shri Jagannath, [[Balabhadra]] and [[Subhadra]], temple activities, the ten incarnations of [[Vishnu]] basing on the '[[Gita Govinda]]' of [[Jayadeva|Jayadev]], Kama Kujara [[Navagunjara]], [[Ramayana]], [[Mahabharata]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indianart.in/indian-art-journey/patta-chitra-paintings.html|title=Indian Art  » Blog Archive   » Patta Chitra Paintings|publisher=indianart.in}}&lt;/ref&gt; The individual paintings of gods and goddesses are also being painted.
The Pattachitra  style are mix of both folk and classical elements but leanings more towards folk forms. The dress style has [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] influences. All of the poses have been confined to a few well-defined postures. These are not free from monotonous repetitions, though at times this is necessary to accentuate the narrative character of the style. The lines are bold and clean and angular and sharp. Generally there are no landscapes, perspectives and distant views. All the incidents are seen in close juxtaposition. The background on which the figures are represented, is delineated with decorations of flowers and foliages and is mostly painted in red colour. All the paintings are given decorative borders. The whole painting is conceived in the form of a design on a given canvas.

The themes may be classified into following categories&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rabindraart.com/how-to-do-pattachitra.html categories of Pattachitra] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100729235958/http://www.rabindraart.com/how-to-do-pattachitra.html |date=2010-07-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Technique ===
[[File:Patta Chitra 01.jpg|thumb|centre|600px|Pattachitra were inspired by [[Jagannath]] [[culture]] in Odisha]]
Traditionally the painters are known as chitrakars. A patta painter's home with all the members of family is his studio. Woman members prepare the glue, the canvas and apply colours what we call the fill-in, and give the final lacquer coating. The master hand, mostly the male member, draws the initial line and gives the final finishing.
Patta paintings are done on small strips of [[cotton]] cloth. The [[canvas]] is prepared by coating the clothe with a mixture of chalk and gum made from [[tamarind]] seeds. Then it is rubbed by taking the help of two different stones and then the cloth is dried.The mixture of gum and [[chalk]] gives the cloth's surface a leathery finish on which the artists paint with vegetable, earth and stone colours.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mumbaipluses.com/thaneplus/index.aspx?page=article&amp;sectid=2&amp;contentid=201001302010020115560358832bd438&amp;sectxslt=&amp;comments=true&amp;pageno=1 The meticulous process of Pattachitra paintings]&lt;/ref&gt;
The painters do not use pencil or [[charcoal]] for the preliminary drawings. They are so expert in the line that they simply draw directly with the brush either in light red or yellow. Then the colours are filled in. The final lines are drawn and the patta is given a lacquer coating to protect it from weather, thus making the painting glossy. This process of [[(Glaze (painting technique))|glazing]] or [[varnishing]] is quite interesting. The painting is held over a fireplace so that the back of the painting is exposed to heat. On the surface of the painting fine lacquer is applied.

=== Colour ===
In the 16th century, with the emergence of [[Bhakti movement]] the paintings of Radha and Krishna were painted in vibrant shades of orange, red and yellow. There are typical scenes and figures like Krishna, Gopis, elephants, trees and other creatures are seen in these paintings. Krishna is always painted in blue and Gopis in light pink, purple or brown colours.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mumbaipluses.com/thaneplus/index.aspx?page=article&amp;sectid=2&amp;contentid=201001302010020115560358832bd438&amp;sectxslt=&amp;comments=true&amp;pageno=1 Radha, Krishna and Gopis in Pattachitra]&lt;/ref&gt;

The painters use vegetable and mineral colours without going for factory made poster colours. They prepare their own colours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rabindraart.com/how-to-do-pattachitra.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100729235958/http://www.rabindraart.com/how-to-do-pattachitra.html |archivedate=2010-07-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; White colour is made from the [[conch]]-shells by powdering, [[boiling]] and [[filter (chemistry)|filtering]] in a very hazardous process. It requires a lot of patience. But this process gives brilliance and premanence to the [[hue]]. 'Hingula', a mineral colour, is used for red. 'Haritala', king of stone ingredients for yellow, 'Ramaraja' a sort of indigo for blue are being used. Pure [[Oil lamp|lamp]]-[[black]] or black prepared from the burning of [[coconut]] shells are used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rabindraart.com/how-to-do-pattachitra.html natural colours used in Pattachitra] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100729235958/http://www.rabindraart.com/how-to-do-pattachitra.html |date=2010-07-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There was no blue either cobalt or ultramarine in the earlier colour schemes. The colours used in the Patta paintings are primarily bright colours, limited to red, yellow, indigo, black and white. The brushes that are used by these 'Chitrakaras' are also indigenous and are made of hair of domestic animals. A bunch of hair tied to the end of a [[bamboo]] stick make the brush.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rabindraart.com/how-to-do-pattachitra.html colour brushes used in Pattachitra] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100729235958/http://www.rabindraart.com/how-to-do-pattachitra.html |date=2010-07-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is really a matter of wonder as to how these painters bring out lines of such precision and finish with the help of these crude brushes.

=== Palm leaf Pattachitra ===
Palm leaf pattachitra which is in Oriya language known as ''Tala Pattachitra'' drawn on palm leaf. First of all palm leaves are left for becoming hard after being taken from tree.Then these are sewn together to form like a canvas. The images are traced by using black or white ink to fill grooves etched on rows of equal-sized panels of palm leaf that are sewn together. These panels can also be easily folded like a fan and packed in a compact pile for better conservation.Often palm-leaf illustrations are more elaborated, obtaining by superimposing layers that are glued together for most of the surface, but in some areas can open like small windows to reveal a second image under the first layer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jagannatha.net/painting.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106124430/http://www.jagannatha.net/painting.html |archivedate=2009-01-06 |df= }} Palm leaf pattachitra&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Laala is spending a normal day in Pripara with her friends, when they are all transported to the Pripara Grand Canyon. Meganii and Meganee explain that they received a distress call from Falulu in Pripari, the world headquarters of all Pripara, located in Prance. Falulu warns everyone that ominous black clouds have appeared above the Eppel Tower and that Pripari is beginning to lose its Sparkle power. The message is cut short before Falulu can elaborate further but Meganii explains that if Pripara loses all its Sparkle then they can no longer be idols. Meganii goes on to explain that the idols must travel to Pripari if they hope to save Pripara for everyone. He also explains that on the way they should perform as much as they can in order to collect Sparkle, or likes, from idols all over the world. Meganee reveals vehicles for all the idols, saying that they cannot use any normal transport, such as the Pritrain or Pricopter, as all forms of transport have become unusable since the disturbance in Pripari. Meganee tells the idols that the entrance to Pripari is at the end of the canyon and that they should hurry.

In Pripari, Falulu begins to fall into a coma, Unicorn explains to Gaaruru that because Falulu was born from the Sparkle power, she and the other Mini Falulu will disappear too, if Pripara is not saved. Gaaruru is unaffected as she was born from the negative feelings of girls who struggled to become idols, opposite to Falulu. Laala and her friends start heading through the canyon, but when they reach the entrance to Pripari, they find Aromageddon have beaten them there. Aroma reveals she plans to get to Pripari first, then seal the entrance with an explosive, but Mikan detonates the explosive prematurely, causing everyone to be blasted out of Pripara to various locations around the world.

Laala, Mirei and Sophy end up in Osaka, where they locate the local Pripara in an Aquarium. They perform for the local idols and collect their likes before continuing on to Pripari. Sion, Dorothy and Reona end up in the United States of Pamerica, where they find the Arepa 51 Pripara to perform at, before continuing on and getting lost in the Gobi desert where they meet Hibiki. Unfortunately the Gobi desert has a side effect of causing people to use sentence enders, which Hibiki hates more than anything. Hibiki is forced to perform in order to cause an oasis to appear and save Dressing Pafe from dying of thirst. Afterwards the three idols thank Hibiki, but are surprised when she begins using 'Pri' as a sentence ender, making them laugh. Hibiki angrily storms off out of the desert with Dressing Pafe in pursuit. Aroma and Mikan end up in Pegypt, where Mikan is able to reveal the entrance to Pegypt's Pripara in a Pyramid under a lake where they perform to get likes. Ajimi ends up lost in the Atlantic Ocean but manages to get to the Palps and meet up with Fuwari who has managed to get home to visit her grandfather. The two idols perform a duet for Fuwari's grandfather before continuing on to Pripari. The other idols, which include Sophy's Royal Guard, Laala's friends Nao, Eiko, Love, Ran the ghost girl and Nanami the leader of Pink Actress, all arrive in New York where they end up at the Pripara Fancy Club. Unfortunately the idols learn that the club holds idol deathmatches and that they cannot leave unless they win their match. The idols select Chanko of the Royal Guard to fight as she is the most macho. Chanko reluctantly agrees, winning her match and performing afterwards for likes.

SoLaMi Smile and Dressing Pafe reach Pripari first, and find the city size Pripara covered by black clouds and the Prisian idols acting strangely, saying they hate everything. But Dorothy discovers she can use the power of the likes stored in her Cyalume Charm to change the Prisians back to normal. SoLaMi Smile and Dressing Pafe head to where Falulu is and learn from Gaaruru the reason for the black clouds appearing. It transpires that when Falulu and Gaaruru returned to Pripari they came with Gloria Ookanda, who met her older sister Ploria when they landed on top of the Eppel Tower. At first the sisters excitedly greeted each other but then began arguing over something trivial. It is this argument that formed the clouds and spread the negative aura over Pripari, and the sisters are still fighting, continuing to create the clouds. Gaaruru explains that Falulu may be able to help them reach the two Ookanda sisters, but she has fallen into a coma with the other mini Falulu. Laala and her friends try to use their Cyalume Charms to wake up Falulu but they don't have enough likes. But when all seems hopeless, the other idols appear and use their charms to wake Falulu up. All the idols then perform a live in front of the Eppel Tower, causing the sisters to come to their senses and stop fighting, restoring Pripari and saving Pripara. The Ookanda sisters forgive each other and Laala and her friends return to Japan.

In a post credits scene, Laala is awoken by Non, who tells her a new idol group has appeared in Pripara. Meganii reveals the group to be Junon, Pinon and Kanon of Triangle, before addressing the audience, saying he will look forward to meeting them again in Pripara next time.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3479">'''Saudi Arabian art''' should be understood in the light of the country being the birthplace of [[Islam]] and to include both the arts of Bedouin nomads and those of the sedentary peoples of regions such as the [[Hejaz]], [[Tihamah]], [[Asir]] and the [[Najd]].

==Architecture==
The first mosque of Islam was the house of the Islamic prophet [[Mohammed]] in [[Medina]]. It is the prototype of all later sacred architecture of Islam. In it are most important the floor and carpet that are touched in prayer with the head.&lt;ref&gt;Seyyed Hossein Nasr: ''Islamic Art and Spirituality'', Albany, 1987, p. 38-40.&lt;/ref&gt; There are different regional styles of architecture in Saudi Arabia, and they are divided into different styles. In the Najd region, most buildings are made of mud-brick covered by mud-plaster. In the Hijaz region, most buildings are made of coral rag and wood, with roofs made of palm thatch and wooden beams. There are many Ottoman influences on the architecture in this region.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the Al-Hufud regions, the houses are usually two or three stories and they surround a central courtyard.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the Asir region, many houses are made of rough-cut stone, and other houses are made of a stone and mud combination.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Visual arts==
Tribal symbols referred to as "wusum" were carved by Bedouins during prehistoric times and are found as rock art in the hills and deserts of [[Arabia]]. During the years 1985-1990l there was a rock art and epigraphic survey of Saudi Arabia. During this time, over 1000 rock art sites were recorded. In the earlier stages of rock art, there were large human and animal faces, and in the later stages the human and animals faces were smaller.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Khan|first=Majeed|date=1991|title=Proceedings of the Seminar for Arabic Studies|jstor=41223107|journal=Twenty Fourth Seminar for Arabian Studies, Oxford|volume=|pages=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art Movement==
The Art Movement in Saudi Arabia started in the mid 60's by a group of School Art Teachers and lasted till mid 80's.

In 1972 Mohammed Said Farsi became the mayor of the coastal city of Jeddah, making the city one of the largest open-air art galleries in the world.

== Portable art forms ==
There are many portable art forms in Saudi Arabia. For example, there is metalware, jewelry, pottery and leatherwork. Even today, many Bedouin women weave, and they make brightly colored striped rugs, camel trapping and tents. The tents are black and are made of goat-hair, mixed with sheep’s wool and camel-hair.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/grove/art/T076144.|title=Saudi Arabia|last=|first=|date=October 27, 2011|website=Oxford Art Online|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Summer evening at Skagen - P.S. Krøyer - Google Cultural Institute.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Peder Severin Krøyer|P.S. Krøyer]]: ''Summer Evening at Skagen. The Artist's Wife and Dog by the Shore'', 1892]] 

'''''Summer Evening at Skagen. The Artist's Wife and Dog by the Shore''''' ({{lang-da|Sommeraften ved Skagen. Kunstnerens hustru med hund ved strandkanten}}) is an 1892 painting by [[Peder Severin Krøyer|P.S. Krøyer]], one of the best known of the artistic community known as the [[Skagen Painters]]. The work shows Marie Krøyer, the artist's wife, standing on the beach at [[Skagen]] with their dog Rap at her side and the moonlight reflected in the sea.

==Background==
{{main|Skagen Painters}}
The Skagen Painters were a close-knit group of mainly Danish artists who gathered each summer from the late 1870s in the fishing village of Skagen in the far north of [[Jutland]], painting the local fishermen and their own family life, gatherings and celebrations. Peder Severin Krøyer (1851–1909), who was born in [[Stavanger]], Norway, but brought up in Copenhagen, first arrived in Skagen in 1882 and returned almost every summer, finally settling there permanently after marrying [[Marie Krøyer|Marie Triepcke]] in 1889.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skagensmuseum.dk/en/collection/the-artists/ps-kroeyer/|title=P.S. Krøyer (1851–1909)|publisher=Skagens Museum|accessdate=2 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had already gained a reputation for his paintings of the fishermen in [[Hornbæk]] on the north coast of [[Zealand]] and had been influenced by the Impressionist movement during his travels to France. In Skagen, he became one of the central and most enthusiastic members of the artistic community creating masterpieces emphasizing the special effects of the local light, particularly in his beach scenes, and painting several memorable works recording the lively gatherings of the artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Kunst_og_kultur/Billedkunst/Danmark_1850-1910/Peder_Severin_Kr%C3%B8yer?highlight=p.s.%20kr%C3%B8yer|title=P.S. Krøyer|work=Den Store Danske |language=Danish|accessdate=2 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Marie Krøyer née Triepcke came from a well-to-do German family living in Copenhagen. From an early age she aspired to become an artist and after training privately she went to Paris to continue her studies. It was there, in early 1889, that she met Krøyer who immediately fell madly in love with her. Although he was 16 years her senior, the couple married that summer. In 1891, they settled in Skagen, giving Krøyer ample opportunity to paint portraits of Marie, both indoors and especially on the beach. The summers Krøyer spent together with his wife in the 1890s were clearly a source of inspiration for him, especially as Marie had a strong sense of beauty herself, often quoting [[Keats]]' "[[Ode on a Grecian Urn|Beauty is truth, truth beauty]]".&lt;ref name="Svanholm2004"&gt;Svanholm, p.132&lt;/ref&gt; 
As a result of the periods of mental illness Krøyer experienced from 1900, the marriage fell apart. In 1912, she married the Swedish composer [[Hugo Alfvén]] who had also been taken by her beauty. It is believed Marie was reluctant to paint after meeting Krøyer whom she looked up to as a far more competent artist. A few of her works have nevertheless survived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kvinfo.dk/side/170/bio/546/|title=Marie Krøyer (1867&amp;ndash;1940)|author=Lise Svanholm|work=Dansk kvindebiografisk leksikon|accessdate=9 September 2014 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kulturarv.dk/kid/VisWeilbach.do?kunstnerId=3784&amp;wsektion=alle|title=Marie Krøyer|publisher=Kunstindeks Danmark &amp; Weilbachs Kunstnerleksikon|accessdate=9 September 2014 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Painting==
The work is oil on canvas and it measures {{convert|206|x|123|cm|in}}.&lt;ref name="sm2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skagensmuseum.dk/en/collection/the-art-works/ps-kroeyer/sum/|title=P.S. Krøyer: Summer evening at Skagen &amp;ndash; 1892|publisher=Skagens Museum|accessdate=8 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marie Krøyer is shown in profile and her melancholy face and bright dress glow under the light of the setting sun.&lt;ref name="Svanholm2004"/&gt; The painting is one of the works in which Krøyer tries to capture the light and mood on the Skagen shore during what he called "[[Blue hour|l'heure bleue]]" (the blue hour), the short period at dusk when the light casts a blue tint over the landscape. The moon's reflection adds a slight feeling of depth to the otherwise flat background which consists mostly of the monolithic blue sea. Although Marie is depicted as being at a similar height to the viewer, the horizon rises above her head, so her radiance is emphasized by comparison with the muted, nearly monochrome background.&lt;ref name="harmony1"&gt;Annette Johansen in ''Harmony in Blue'' p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The painting was exhibited in 1893 in ''[[Den Frie Udstilling]]'' (The Free Exhibition). Reviews were mixed; [[Carl Hartmann (sculptor)|Carl Hartmann]] writing in the conservative ''[[Nationaltidende]]'' thought the painting beautiful and stated that it was "so fine that it ... throws an ennobling light on the whole collection",&lt;ref name="harmony2"&gt;Mette Bøgh Jensen in ''Harmony in Blue'' p.67&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Johannes Jørgensen]] in ''[[Politiken]]'' claimed that the viewer quickly tired of the picture as the figure of Marie was "incapable of awakening any mood", the colour was in places "distinctly unpleasant" and the dog, Rap, was "an ugly and unpleasant animal to behold".&lt;ref name="harmony2" /&gt; 
Critics at the [[Salon du Champ-de-Mars]] in 1894 were generally enthusiastic over Krøyer's use of colour and were struck and intrigued by the flatness of the composition.&lt;ref name="harmony2" /&gt; 
French critics who saw the picture at the [[Galerie nationale du Jeu de Paume|Jeu de Paume]] in Paris in 1928 compared it to the [[Impressionist]] works of [[Paul-Albert Besnard]], in particular his portrait of Madame Roger Jourdain, though at least one opined that the comparison showed the "victorious influence" of the French school.&lt;ref name="harmony1"/&gt;

==Provenance==
After the exhibition at ''Den Frie Udstilling'' in 1893, it was exhibited at a Munich exhibition in the summer of the same year, and then sold to a German art lover directly from the exhibition. Krøyer had mixed feelings about the sale as he would have preferred to have kept the portrait for a Danish museum, but was pleased that his painting had drawn so much appreciation at the German exhibition that he had not only had enthusiastic reviews but was able to sell it for 1000 kroner more than he would have been able to achieve in Denmark. Although Krøyer no longer owned the painting he was still allowed to exhibit it at the Salon du Champ-de-Mars in 1894. In 1900, he received a letter from the original German purchaser, a banker called Steinbart, informing him that he would like to offer it for sale; Krøyer talked to [[Heinrich Hirschsprung]] who arranged for [[J.C. Jacobsen]] to acquire it for the [[Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek]] in early 1902.&lt;ref name="harmony1"/&gt; In 1937 it was lodged at [[Skagens Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kulturarv.dk/kid/VisVaerk.do?vaerkId=263431|title=Sommeraften ved Skagen, kunstnerens hustru med hund ved strandkanten|trans-title=Summer Evening at Skagen, the Artist's Wife and Dog by the Shore|publisher=Kunstindeks Danmark &amp; Weilbachs Kunstnerleksikon|accessdate=8 September 2014|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bihari Sándor Önarckép.jpg|thumb|200px|Self-portrait (1880s?)]]
'''Sándor Bihari''' (19 May 1855, [[Rézbánya]] - 28 March 1906, [[Budapest]]) was a [[Jewish]] Hungarian [[Genre art|genre]] painter.

== Life ==
Born to a [[Jewish]] family, Sándor spent his childhood in [[Nagyvárad]]. Originally, he worked with his father as a decorative painter. In 1874, he moved to Budapest, where he did [[photo manipulation|retouching]] at a photography studio while attending a drawing school operated by [[Bertalan Székely]].&lt;ref name="M"&gt;[http://www.mke.hu/lyka/05/353-365-bihari.htm Béla Fónagy: Bihari Sándor] @ Művészet (from 1906)&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, he used his meager resources on a move to Vienna, where he hoped to enroll in the [[Academy of Fine Arts Vienna|Academy of Fine Arts]]. At first he had to find work as a retoucher again and might have remained in that position, had he not received a gift of 600 [[Forint]]s from Székely, which enabled him to quit his job and enter the Academy.&lt;ref name="M" /&gt;

He returned to his hometown, where he spent three years struggling as a portrait painter until a benefactor who liked his work provided the means for him to study in Paris. He travelled there in 1883, where he studied at the [[Académie Julian]] with [[Jean-Paul Laurens]]&lt;ref name="M" /&gt; and improved his technique by copying the [[Old Masters]] at the [[Louvre]]. While there, he became acquainted with [[plein-air]] painting and [[Impressionism (art)|Impressionism]], which had a decisive influence on his style. Upon returning to Hungary, he settled in [[Szolnok]], a popular gathering place for painters, and would later become one of the founders of an art colony there.

He continued to travel, making lengthy visits to Italy especially, until his health began to fail in 1893.&lt;ref name="M" /&gt; During his final years, he lived in Budapest but continued to spend his summers in Szolnok. In 1896, he was awarded the [[Order of Franz Joseph]].

'''The Bridge Stage of the Arts, Inc.''' ('''The Bridge''') is an [[United States|American]] theater company based in [[New York City]].  It was incorporated by its Artistic Director, Avra Petrides, in 1980;&lt;ref name="Incorporation 1980"&gt;Certificate of Incorporation, is dated April 21, 1980, and signed by the Secretary of State, Basil Paterson&lt;/ref&gt; and has produced American/International music- theater festivals in the [[South of France]] ([[Languedoc-Roussillon]] region) with American musical-theater artists such as [[Alan Jay Lerner]], lyricist and librettist of ''[[My Fair Lady]]'', and [[Betty Comden]] and [[Adolph Green]] screenwriters and lyricists of ''[[Singin' In The Rain]].''&lt;ref name="Int Herald Trib 1984 Jul 25" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;La Depeche, July 6, 1982&lt;/ref&gt; These artists performed and also gave master classes on musical theater to lyricists, librettists, playwrights, composers, directors, and performers from all over the world.  In [[Lower Manhattan]] The Bridge has presented  ''Performance-Forums'' in which theater artists collaborate on productions with astrophysicists, philosophers, architects and others working in a variety of disciplines.&lt;ref name="Time Out 1996 Mar 27" /&gt;&lt;ref name="World Notes 1996 Sum" /&gt; Also, in [[Lower Manhattan]], The Bridge produced ''Hart &amp; Hammerstein Centennial Plus One''  which re-introduced ''[[Castle Clinton]]'' as a noteworthy performance space.&lt;ref name="NYTs 1996 Jun 2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Courier Lifestyles 1996 Jun 3" /&gt;

==Purpose==
The purpose of The Bridge is to further collaborative creation of new theatrical hybrids by spanning different disciplines, cultures and generations; and to provide educational programs in the performing and visual arts.

==Notable productions==
In the [[South of France]], The Bridge presented ''[[Alan Jay Lerner]] and [[Liz Robertson]] In Concert'', ''[[Honi Coles]] and The Copasetics In Concert'', and ''[[Betty Comden]] and [[Adolph Green]] In Concert''.&lt;ref name="Int Herald Trib 1984 Jul 25" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"La Depeche 1982 July 6"&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[Lower Manhattan]], The Bridge has produced its ''Performance-Forums'' with astrophysicist, [[Neil deGrasse Tyson]], theater director, [[Tom O'Horgan]] and others.&lt;ref name="Time Out 1996 Mar 27" /&gt;&lt;ref name="World Notes 1996 Sum" /&gt;  And in June 2001, it presented ''Hart &amp; Hammerstein Centennial Plus One'' at [[Castle Clinton]], near the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] in [[Lower Manhattan]].&lt;ref name="Backstage 2001 Feb 21" /&gt;  The production was the first of a summer concert series, and marked the first time in 146 years that [[Castle Clinton]] had been used as a theater.  [[Castle Clinton]], a {{age|1811|01|01}}-year-old circular stone garrison built in 1811 to protect New York from the warring British, has served as an indoor garden, an opera house, an aquarium, an immigrant landing depot, and the setting in which the "[[Swedish Nightingale]]" [[Jenny Lind]] made her 1850 American debut, courtesy of [[P.T. Barnum]]; also, in recent years, as a ticket booth for ferries to the [[Statue of Liberty]].&lt;ref name="NYTs 1996 Jun 2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Courier Lifestyles 1996 Jun 3" /&gt;

==Founder and artistic director==
Avra Petrides, a native New Yorker, is the daughter of pioneering woman orchestral conductor, [[Frédérique Petrides]], and journalist, Peter Petrides, who, for many years was managing editor of the New York City-based, Greek-American newspaper, The National Herald (not to be confused with the newspaper of the same name that was established in 1997).&lt;ref name="Groh 1991" /&gt;

== History ==
The Bridge Stage of the Arts, Inc., was incorporated in New York City in 1980 as a not-for-profit organization.&lt;ref name="Incorporation 1980"/&gt; It was then known as The Bridge American Theater Festival, Inc. In 1995, its title was changed to The Bridge Stage of the Arts, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;Certificate of Amendment, filed with the Secretary of State on June 2nd 1995&lt;/ref&gt; The Bridge works on a project by project basis.

===Festival in south of France===
''Bridge Productions are always staged in spaces exceptional for their beauty and resonance of the past.'' Although based in Manhattan, in the 1980s, The Bridge produced summer music theater festivals in the south of France, with an emphasis on the American musical theater. Alan Jay Lerner (lyricist, librettist, [[My Fair Lady]], [[Camelot]]), [[Comden and Green]], lyricists-screenwriters [[Singin' In The Rain]], [[Will Rogers Follies]]) tap dancer [[Honi Coles]], ([[Tony Award]] winner, [[My One and Only (musical)|My One and Only]]), [[Virgil Thomson]], (critic and composer, Four Saints in Three Acts), members of the [[American Dance Machine]] and of [[Joseph Chaikin]]'s experimental [[The Open Theater]], and others performed at night and taught master classes during the day. Each summer, through the invitation of The Bridge and the International Theatre Institute,&lt;ref&gt;"Theatre Notes," ''International Theatre Institute USA,'' No. 107, May 1982&lt;/ref&gt; (a branch of [[UNESCO]]), 150 actors, singers, dancers, choreographers, playwrights, composers, directors and lyricists and librettists from, at times, 22 countries including [[France]], [[China]], [[Australia]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Madagascar]], [[United States|America]] and [[Japan]] came to partake free of charge in The Bridge programs. The performances attended by an international audience were sold out.

Surrounded by sunlit vineyards and streams, the festivals' first site, in 1982, was a restored 17th century factory, in the small, medieval township of [[Saint-Chinian]], South of France, ([[Languedoc-Roussillon]] region),  where the uniforms of [[Louis XIV]]'s regiments were once embroidered. In 1984, The Bridge Festival moved to the nearby walled medieval city of [[Beziers]] also in the [[Languedoc-Roussillon]] region of the [[South of France]].

To bring something as high spirited and new as the American musical into these timeless surroundings was thrilling, giving a sense of new in old, of continuity of tradition and the march of time.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', July 21, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;French newspaper ''[[Midi Libre]]'', July 2, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;French publication ''L'information du Spectacle'', June 1982&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;French newspaper ''[[Midi Libre]]'', June 25, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;French newspaper ''[[La Dépêche du Midi|La Depeche]]'', June 19, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;French newspaper ''[[La Marseillaise (journal)|La Marseillaise]]'' [[:fr:La Marseillaise (journal)|(fr)]] de [[Hérault|l'Herault]], July 1, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;French newspaper Liberation July 2, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;French newspaper ''[[La Marseillaise (journal)|La Marseillaise]]'' [[:fr:La Marseillaise (journal)|(fr)]] de [[Hérault|l'Herault]], June 25, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;French newspaper ''[[Midi Libre]]'', June 26, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;French newspaper ''[[La Dépêche du Midi|La Depeche]]'', July 6, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;French newspaper ''[[Le Monde]],'' June 24, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;French newspaper ''[[Le Figaro]],'' June 11, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;French newspaper ''[[Midi Libre]]'', July 17, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;French newspaper ''[[Midi Libre]]'', July 20, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;French newspaper ''[[Midi Libre]]'', July 22, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;French newspaper ''[[Midi Libre]]'', July 26, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;French newspaper ''[[Midi Libre]]'', July 27, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;French newspaper ''[[Midi Libre]]'', July 28, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

====Betty Comden review excerpted====
[[Betty Comden]] and her partner, [[Adolph Green]], were prolific lyricists and librettists of Broadway and film musicals including ''[[Singin' In The Rain]], [[Bells Are Ringing (musical)|Bells Are Ringing]]'', and ''[[On the Town (musical)|On the Town]].''  Comden gave The Bridge kudos in 1985.

'The Long Arm of the American Musical Stretches to [[Beziers]]'

&amp;hellip; It is not unusual for American musicals to appear in [[London]] &amp;hellip; nor is it strange that ''[[A Chorus Line]]'' is a smash in [[Budapest]], but just why were 50 assorted voices of musical workshop members belting out the song "Just in Time" one morning in July in the vaulted 11th century cloister of Sainte-Aphrodise in the relatively small town of [[Beziers]] (population 100,00) somewhere in the southwest of France!

'Just in time, I found you just in time &amp;hellip;' was issuing from throats that had traveled from [[Norway]], [[Belgium]], [[Sweden]], [[France]], [[West Germany]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Israel]], [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Poland]], [[Madagascar]], [[Romania|Rumania]], [[New Jersey]] and several other of the United States, only because my partner [[Adolph Green]] and I were using that song we had written with [[Jule Styne]] for the show ''[[Bells Are Ringing (musical)|Bells are Ringing]]'' as an example of a certain kind of theatrical-musical moment.  It pleased us to learn that most of the international group of students seemed to know, or at least know of the song.  They spontaneously sang along, their voices echoing, perhaps as far as the foothills of the Pyrenees. Ah your music, your theater, she is indeed the international language, no?

&amp;hellip;The concept of The Bridge, a yearly workshop and festival devoted to the American musical, to be located in France &amp;hellip; was to be literally a bridge between countries and cultures to disseminate knowledge on the subject by assembling "stagères", working participants from all over the globe, and bringing over from America leading practitioners of [[musical theater]] to do the disseminating.  Her dream was that some day in the future, for example, if [[Hal Prince]] wanted to experiment with Japanese [[Noh]] players, working with a Swedish lyricist, a Yugoslavian composer, and a Bessarabian choreographer, such an international collaboration would be assembled under the auspices of The Bridge.  This is but a facetious example of the possibilities.  Avra Petrides has a strong and sincere feeling about the need for open communication through the arts among the many diverse cultures of our all too unpeaceful world, and hopes The Bridge will help.&lt;ref name="Dramatists Guild 1985 Spring" /&gt;}}

=== Performance-Forums ===
In 1996, in [[Lower Manhattan]], The Bridge initiated its ''Performance- Forums'' in the [[Art Deco]] "Cocoa" building at No.1 Wall Street.  In this series, American/international theater artists collaborate with astrophysicists, sculptors, theologians, philosophers, poets, novelists, painters, musicians, choreographers, filmmakers, and others working in a variety of creative, scientific and intellectual disciplines.  The aim: to better understand each other's endeavors and find new and exciting ways to combine them in stage production. The theme of the initial Performance-Forum was ''Time'' (as perceived by people in different disciplines and cultures.)

For several months prior to this event these people collaborated on a performance based on that theme:
* [[Tom O'Horgan]], Theater director of the Broadway productions ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]'', ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]'', ''Lenny'', ''Inner City''; director for the [[Vienna State Opera]], [[New York City Opera]]; and co-author of ''Senator Joe'' at the [[Neil Simon Theater]] on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]].
* [[Neil de Grasse Tyson]], Ph.D. Astrophysicist and Director of the [[Hayden Planetarium]].
* Michael Sherman, A futurist, who was advising governments and corporations on their long-range plans. He has made a comparative study of images of time in modern culture.
* [[Min Tanaka]], International choreographer and [[Butoh]] dancer.
* [[Tony Rothman]], Ph.D. Physicist specializing in cosmology, who has been on the Editorial Board of [[Scientific American]], and a [[Pulitzer Prize]] nominee.
* Kirk Nurock, Composer/pianist, who has played with [[Phil Woods]], [[Chet Baker]], [[Dizzy Gillespie]] and [[Donald Byrd]]. His compositions and arrangements have been performed by [[Judy Collins]], [[Dizzy Gillespie]], [[Dick Hyman]], [[Bette Midler]], [[Jane Ira Bloom]], The [[Brecker Brothers]] and [[Jay Clayton (musician)|Jay Clayton]].
* Serge Gubelman, who has been playing the [[Didgeridu]] since the 70's.
* R.M. Fischer, Sculptor and installation artist, whose work is in the permanent collections of the [[Museum of Modern Art]], the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]], The Cincinnati Art Museum, and the [[Dallas Museum of Art]], among others. His public installations include ''Rector Gate'' at [[Battery Park City]] and the ''Kansas City Sky Stations''.
* [[Brenda Bufalino]], Tap dancer and Founder of the [[American Tap Dance Foundation]], who has performed as a soloist at [[Carnegie Hall]], [[Avery Fisher Hall]], the [[Smithsonian Institution]], the [[Kennedy Center]] and on [[PBS]]' [[Great Performances]] series; and-
* [[Theo Bleckmann]], Vocalist and composer who has worked with [[Philip Glass]], [[Anthony Braxton]], [[Elliott Sharp]], [[Meredith Monk]] and Kirk Nurock.

This debut ''Performance-Forum'', given on March 28, 1996, was attended by approximately two hundred artists, scientists and philosophers, who, at its conclusion, participated in the ''Forum'', which took the form of a panel-led discussion on the evening's theme ''Time''.&lt;ref name="Time Out 1996 Mar 27" /&gt;&lt;ref name="World Notes 1996 Sum" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The [[WQXR-FM]] initiative, ''Action for the Arts'' featured The Bridge ''Performance - Forums'' in public service announcements made by The Bridge's Artistic Director, Avra Petrides (on [[WQXR-FM]]) and they were featured in their ''Action for the Arts'' "catalog" which detailed the work of 96 organizations&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;archival video tape of the entire event, held by The Bridge Stage of the Arts&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Castle Clinton redux ===
In addition, in 1996, The Bridge re-introduced the beautiful 19th century reddish circular stone structure in Historic [[Battery Park]], [[Castle Clinton]], as a remarkable performance space, with the production, ''Hart and Hammerstein Centennial Plus One''. An evening of song, it was hosted by [[CBS]]' [[Charles Osgood]], and featured leading singers and Rob Fisher, then musical director of the [[Encores!]] series at the [[New York City Center]]. It was the first performance at [[Castle Clinton]] since the mid-1800s when, as an opera house, it was the [[Lincoln Center]] of its day, attracting impresarios like [[P.T. Barnum]] and performers like [[Jenny Lind]]. For the Hart &amp; Hammerstein production, The Bridge brought in Broadway theater technicians who, by working into the wee hours of the night before the performance, erected a 30&amp;nbsp;inch high, spacious stage, and to guard against the possibility of rain bringing the performance to a close, covered the roof opening with a translucent white tent.&lt;ref name="NYTs 1996 Jun 2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Courier Lifestyles 1996 Jun 3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[[Castle Clinton]] &amp;hellip; Rising in the East," ''[[New York Magazine]],'' June 3, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Robert Moses ''vs.'' Castle Clinton ====
In 1941, the [[New York City Department of Parks and Recreation|Park Commissioner]], [[Robert Moses]], wanted to raze [[Castle Clinton]], claiming it was essential to building a crossing from [[Battery Park|the Battery]] to [[Brooklyn]].&lt;ref name="Caro 1974"&gt;''[[The Power Broker: Robert Moses and the Fall of New York]]'', by [[Robert Caro|Robert A. Caro]], [[Alfred A. Knopf|Knopf]] (1974); {{OCLC|834874}}&lt;/ref&gt; Protests from historic preservationists and others brought this plan to a halt but not before the roof had been removed.

==Ongoing and in development==

The Bridge programs have been supported by organizations including the French Ministries of Culture (L'Association Française d'Artistique) and Foreign Affairs (Le Ministère des Relations Extérieures), the [[United States Department of State]], [[CBS]],  [[United Technologies Corporation]] and the ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]'' Foundation.&lt;ref name="Int Herald Trib 1984 Jul 25" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;French Newspaper, ''[[Midi Libre]]'', July 29, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;French newspaper ''[[La Dépêche du Midi]]'', July 6, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Suzy," (column), ''[[New York Post]],'' January 29, 1986&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Posters created by [[United Technologies]], advertising the Festival in Summer of1982&lt;/ref&gt;

It features a jumble of the bodies of the damned, hurled into abyss by [[Michael (archangel)|archangel Michael]] and accompanying angels. [[David Freedberg]] assessed this painting manner as the "most brilliant assemblages of lusciously naked flesh in [[Western art]]".&lt;ref&gt;Sophie Perryer, ''10 years 100 artists'', Struik, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1959 an [[Vandalism of art|art vandal]] threw an acid on the painting. According to him, he did not directly destroy the work, but the acid "relieves one from the work of destruction".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heyokamagazine.com/HEYOKA.3.PINOCELLI.htm|title=Destructivism|publisher =Heyoka Magazine|accessdate=2010-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

__NOTOC__
'''''The Golden Stairs''''' is one of the best-known paintings by the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood|Pre-Raphaelite]] artist [[Edward Burne-Jones]].  It was begun in 1876 and exhibited at the [[Grosvenor Gallery]] in 1880.&lt;ref name="Wildman"&gt;Wildman and Christian (1998), pp. 246–249&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wood"&gt;Wood (1997), pp. 88–89&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike many of Burne-Jones's works, ''The Golden Stairs'' is not based on a literary source. It has been called [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]],&lt;ref&gt;Wood (1997), p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; as it has no recognisable narrative, but rather sets a mood.  It is a harmony of color in the tradition of the [[Aestheticism|Aesthetic]] works of the 1860s and 1870s, as a group of young women carrying musical instruments descend a spiraling staircase, dressed in classically inspired robes in tones of white, shading to gold and silver.&lt;ref name="smarth"&gt;{{cite web | title =The Golden Stairs| work = | publisher =Smarthistory at Khan Academy | date = | url =http://smarthistory.khanacademy.org/burne-jones-the-golden-stairs.html | accessdate =31 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wildman247"&gt;Wildman and Christian (1998), p. 247&lt;/ref&gt; Critic [[F. G. Stephens]] wrote in ''[[The Athenaeum (British magazine)|The Athenaeum]]'' that the musicians "troop past like spirits in an enchanted dream ... whither they go, who they are, there is nothing to tell".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Wood (1997), p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Golden Stairs'' was one of many paintings Burne-Jones sketched out in 1872 following a trip to Italy.  He began work on the canvas in 1876 and finished it in great haste in April 1880, just days before the Grosvenor Gallery exhibition was to open.  Stephens found in the painting echoes of the work of [[Piero della Francesca]], whose frescoes Burne-Jones had seen and copied in 1871.&lt;ref name="Wildman247" /&gt; The figures of the musicians were drawn from professional models, but the heads are young women of Burne-Jones's circle.&lt;ref name="Wildman" /&gt; Some identifications have been made as follows.

His daughter Margaret is fourth from top, holding a trumpet.&lt;ref name=MacCarthy102&gt;MacCarthy (2011), p. 102 (caption to colour plate VI)&lt;/ref&gt; Edith Gellibrand, known by the stage name Edith Chester, is seventh from top, seen stooping.&lt;ref&gt;Marcus (1975), p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; [[May Morris]], daughter of [[William Morris]], is ninth from top, holding a violin. Frances Graham, later known as Lady Horner, daughter of [[William Graham (Glasgow MP)|William Graham]], is bottom left, holding cymbals.&lt;ref name=MacCarthy102/&gt; Standing behind her on the stairs is [[Mary Gladstone]], daughter of [[William Gladstone]].&lt;ref&gt;MacCarthy (2011), p. 277&lt;/ref&gt; Others include Laura Tennant, later known as [[Laura Lyttelton]], and Mary Stuart-Wortley, later [[Ralph King-Milbanke, 2nd Earl of Lovelace|Lady Lovelace]].&lt;ref name="Wildman" /&gt;

The painting was purchased by [[Cyril Flower, 1st Baron Battersea|Cyril Flower]] (1843–1907), later Lord Battersea, a politician and art patron, and was bequeathed by him to the [[Tate Britain|Tate Gallery]], where it remains.&lt;ref name="Wildman" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wood" /&gt;

 |ShortSummary= In the premiere of the show, Tim Gunn introduces the three mentors to a group of 15 designers. He separates the designers into 2 groups- group one with 8 and the group two with 7. He announces that 3 designers will be eliminates, and that the second group will not be participating in the first challenge. The first group is led into the workroom and given a bag of 6 3-yard pieces of fabric that they have 6 hours to make an outfit that shows their design aesthetics. After the runway, the mentors take turns to pick out their team. Designers who are chosen by more than one mentor are given the opportunity to choose their mentor. Nick becomes disheartened when it appears that he is unpopular with the designers.

This leaves Melissa and Natalia in the bottom two; the mentors bemoan the simplicity of Melissa's look, and raise doubts about Natalia's taste and time management. However, after a tearful appeal to the judges, both Nick and Mondo invite Natalia to be on their teams. Citing construction concerns, she ultimately chooses Nick, to his delight.

 |ShortSummary= The second group is given 30 seconds to pick out as much fabric as they want from drums scattered around the FIDM courtyard and given 6 hours to create a look that represents their aesthetic. Cognizant of the fact that there are fewer open positions for their group, several of the designers "up their game," creating a more competitive playing field for the mentors.

This leaves one spot on Nick's team open. Stephanie, Amy, and Rey plead their cases to Nick, but ultimately Nick states that his mind was already made up, and chooses Stephanie for his final mentee, leaving a disappointed Amy and a somewhat aggravated Rey to be eliminated.

 |ShortSummary= Tim takes the designers and mentors for a bus tour around hollywood to inspire the designers to come up with a red carpet look, with Zanna Roberts Rassi citing that the winning look would be worn by a celebrity in a future publication of ''Marie Claire''. As Tim analyzes the mentors, he finds himself stepping in to stop Nick from getting too hands-on with his designers. During the runway critique, Sam's outfit stands out for approaching red carpet clothing from a different direction and he is awarded the win; conversely, Camila is sent home for keeping her look too plain.

She sets the designers with the task of making an outfit using vampire-related materials, which the designers have to run and collect from a in a graveyard-setting in the FIDM courtyard. Despite landing in the bottom two the previous week, Michelle is awarded the win over Asha for this challenge,  while Anya is given the task of choosing between Brady and Nicholas as the losing designer. Ultimately, she decides that Nicholas has more potential, and sends Brady home.

 |ShortSummary= The designers must create a performance look for Zendaya to wear onstage while on tour. The designers seem to struggle with this challenge, and during the runway critique, seven designs are critiqued, with only Shan and Asha landing on top, while Nick's entire group (Stephanie, Oscar, Natalia, and Isabelle) and Blake end up on the bottom. Despite an overwhelming consensus from the judges that seems to point to Isabelle's elimination, Nick figuratively throws her under the bus after being unable to successfully help her manage her time, which causes concern amongst his remaining designers. Zendaya--tasked with choosing the winning designer--clearly heavily favors Asha's design, and awards her the win.

 |ShortSummary=  The first team challenge requires the designers to create mini collections of 3 cohesive pieces, inspired by the Getty Villa and the movie, Pompeii. Nick's team has a shaky start, and seems unable to reach common ground. Oscar takes over the group in order to turn things around, and Nick's group ultimately ends up winning the challenge, with Oscar being cited as the clear winner in his group. Mondo's team is safe, while Anya's team is declared the losing team. Blake's outfit is praised by the judges, which leaves Shan and Nicholas up for elimination. Ultimately neither designer is eliminated due to their "potential."

Tensions run high between Anya and Nicholas because of his consecutive bad performances, whereas Shan has upped his game after his near elimination. Shan wins the challenge, and Anya is yet again given the task between sending Blake or Nicholas home. Apparently learning from her mistake the first time, she chooses Blake to stay.

 |ShortSummary=  The designers enjoy a beach party in the California sun and then are challenged to use the materials from the seaside bash to create their looks. Frustrated with being safe since his initial win, Sam seems to struggle with his look, whereas Oscar has difficultly settling on a design for the challenge. Tim criticizes him for relying too much on the mentor critique to drive his design choices. After the runway, Mondo is given the responsibility of awarding the win to either Sam or Asha, ultimately choosing Sam for overcoming his frustrations with the challenge, and sticking to his design aesthetic. Sam is also awarded a bonus prize for creating the look that best matched the mood of the California beach party challenge. Even though Michelle is harshly criticized for making a cocktail waitress outfit and not utilizing enough unconventional materials, it's Stephanie who is sent home for yet again failing to deliver a compelling runway look.

 |ShortSummary=   The designers are placed in pairs across mentor groups to create a 3 look mini collection to be manufactured and sold at Francesca's. Shan and Oscar, Blake and Sam, and Natalia and Asha are paired up for this challenge. Asha is noticeably unhappy about the proposition of working with the unpredictable Natalia, and the two butt heads when Natalia seems to be wasting time. The mentors collaborate on their critiques, with Nick and Mondo seemingly disagreeing over the direction of the Asha/Natalia pairing. Several of the designers provide interviews saying that Natalia is faking her incessant emotional outbursts.

Oscar, Shan, Sam, and Blake are in contention for the win, with both Shan and Oscar being chosen as the winner. Asha and Natalia both give tearful speeches after being asked which of them should be sent home, and though neither of them actually give a clear answer, Natalia insinuates that she wouldn't want Asha to feel as though she was being sent home for something Natalia did. Ultimately, Natalia is eliminated for her poor construction.

 |Title= The Benefit of Fashion
 |OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|2014|3|27}}
 |ShortSummary=   The designers are paired with clients who have specific fashion needs, and are tasked with giving them makeovers.

'''Oscar:''' Dani has to shop in the children's sections of stores due to her petite stature, and is in need of a more age appropriate wardrobe.
'''Shan:''' Brittany is a single mom looking for exciting date look to break up the monotony of her day wear.
'''Blake:''' Ruzena is looking to have her tomboyish image more feminized.
'''Sam:''' Norah is looking for something that she can wear from the office to the bar.
'''Asha:''' Erin is looking for a birthday outfit that celebrate her recent 50lb weight loss.

All of the designers seemingly struggle in this challenge--Asha frets that the judges will send her home for the most minor issue after the previous week, while Sam is criticized for his poor fabric choices. Shan's client has an allergic reaction to sequins, and he has to make a dress for her in the two hours before the runway show. On the runway, Oscar is criticized for making Dani look old, whereas Sam and Blake both struggle to give their clients interesting designs. Asha is praised for making Erin glow with happiness, while Shan is credited with his think quick design, and is awarded the win and a bonus prize for his resourcefulness.

Sam becomes emotional after he connects Hawkeye's story to his struggles as a young gay teen, and shares that his mother accidentally prevented him from committing suicide, which he had never told her. Despite this emotional breakthrough, he and Asha are put up for elimination, both of whom seem sad to be losing their best friend right before the finale. However, in a twist, both designers from Mondo's team are put through to the finale, to the distaste of the other designers and mentors.

 |Title= Finale
 |OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|2014|4|10}}
 |ShortSummary=   The designers must create their collections in three days. The winning designer and mentor are chosen.

'''Sam's Collection:''' Inspired by the armor people build up to protect themselves, and how his armor crumbled during the competition.
'''Asha's Collection:''' Inspired by "Coming to America" and the idea of Queen Nefertiti in Harlem.
'''Oscar's Collection:" Inspiration unclear; seems to be inspired by Cuba and women giving life. Recycles past designs.
'''Shan's Collection:''' Inspired by the dichotomy of hard and soft, using leather and lace.

In the workroom, Nick is surprised at how directional Sam's collection is turning out, while Sam declares Asha his biggest competition. During critique, Mondo challenges both Asha and Sam to make their designs less costumey. Shan struggles to come up with a cohesive statement, and Oscar is reprimanded for repeating past looks.

On the runway, Sam is lauded for his ability to create a cohesive, salable collection out of highly disparate fabric choices but criticized for not creating more of a show. Asha is told her collection is "next level" by the sitting judges, who appreciate her growth in the competition; however Neil and Heidi find it to be too costumey. Oscar is praised by the guest judges for a gorgeously made collection, but the main judges are disappointed at how many of his looks are disappointing remakes. The judges' disappointment in Shan's collection is palpable, with Jen Rade looking nearly in tears.

The judges debate the criteria of who should win the challenge, and Tim has to reiterate the nature of the challenge itself. Shan is left out of the conversation while Asha, Oscar, and Sam are thrown around as potential winners. Ultimately, the decision comes down to Oscar and Sam, and the former is declared the winner of Under the Gunn.

{{italic title}}
'''''Waywords and Meansigns: Recreating Finnegans Wake [in its whole wholume]''''' is an international project setting [[James Joyce]]'s novel ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'' to music. Waywords and Meansigns has released two editions of audio, each offering an unabridged musical adaptation of Joyce's book. A [[Waywords and Meansigns Opendoor Edition|third edition]], featuring over 100 artists and performing much shorter passages of the book, debuted May 4, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Waywords and Meansigns website| url=http://www.waywordsandmeansigns.com/listen/opendoor-edition |title=Opendoor Edition |date=4 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project brought together a diverse array of musicians. A artist or group performed each chapter in the first two editions; artists performed shorter, page-length passages in the third edition. The musicians only requirements were that "the words be audible, unabridged and more or less in their original order". With a goal of making Joyce's famously obscure novel more accessible, all audio from the project is distributed freely online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Marta Bausells |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/feb/02/finnegans-wake-music-james-joyce-birthday |title=Finnegans Wake: a musical reading sounds out a cryptic text |date=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

The Waywords and Meansigns project began in 2014 with a goal of setting James Joyce's Finnegans Wake to music unabridged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Waywords and Meansigns website| url=http://www.waywordsandmeansigns.com/about/waywords-and-meansigns/ |title=About Waywords and Meansigns |access-date=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first edition, which premiered in 2015, featured a different artist or musical group performing each of the book's seventeen chapters. The second edition, which premiered in 2016, also offered an unabridged version of the book, performed by a different set of artists and musicians. 

A third edition, dubbed the [[Waywords and Meansigns Opendoor Edition]], premiered in 2017 with a focus on performing shorter passages rather than complete chapters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Waywords and Meansigns website| url=http://www.waywordsandmeansigns.com/about/waywords-and-meansigns/ |title=About Waywords and Meansigns |access-date=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an open edition, with contributors invited to create new recordings on an ongoing basis, the Opendoor Edition features over 100 contributors from 15 countries. Over 300 people have been involved in Wayords and Meansigns since 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Waywords and Meansigns website| url=http://www.waywordsandmeansigns.com/listen/opendoor-edition |title=Opendoor Edition |date=4 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

While some passages in Waywords and Meansigns adhere to traditional song structures, much of the music is experimental. The musicians' only requirements were that "the words be audible, unabridged and more or less in their original order."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Waywords and Meansigns website| url=http://www.waywordsandmeansigns.com/about/waywords-and-meansigns/ |title=About Waywords and Meansigns |access-date=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; All audio from the project is distributed freely online under [[Creative Commons license|Creative Commons licensing]]. Finn Fordham, a James Joyce scholar at [[Royal Holloway, University of London]] has called the project "wonderfully innovative"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Marta Bausells |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/feb/02/finnegans-wake-music-james-joyce-birthday |title=Finnegans Wake: a musical reading sounds out a cryptic text |website=The Guardian|date=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Guardian]]'' has highlighted the project for making Joyce's famously difficult novel more accessible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Billy Mills |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2015/apr/28/finnegans-wake-james-joyce-modern-interpretations |title=Finnegans Wake - the book the web was invented for |website=The Guardian |date=28 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contributors to Waywords and Meansigns are a self-described collection of "musicians, artists, poets, scholars, weirdos, passionate Wake-heads, those totally ignorant of the Wake, and anyone generally adventurous."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Waywords and Meansigns website| url=http://www.waywordsandmeansigns.com/contact/get-involved/ |title=Get Involved |access-date=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Waywords and Meansigns has been noted as a uniquely ambitious, and unusual, project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Alberto del Castillo  |url=http://www.playgroundmag.net/cultura/books/centenar-personas-creado-audiolibros-historia_0_1951604840.html |title=Un centenar de personas ha creado uno de los audiolibros más locos de la historia|website=Playground Mag |date=7 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Joe Murray  |url=https://radiofreemidwich.wordpress.com/2016/01/25/buttery-panes-joe-murray-on-neil-campbell-steve-gregoropoulos-no-artist-mel-bentley-010001111000/ |title=buttery panes: joe murray on neil campbell, steve gregoropoulos, no artist, mel bentley, 010001111000 |website=radio free midwich |date=25 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rock critic Jesse Jarnow applauded Waywords and Meansigns for their innovative use of the digital platform&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jesse Jarnow |url=http://flavorwire.com/556284/alternate-routes-mozart-and-joyce-reimagined-inside-baseball-and-more |title=Alternate Routes: James Joyce, Baseball, and ’90s Film Inspire Wildly Ambitious Musical Experiments|date=19 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[University College Dublin]]'s Digital Platform for Contemporary Irish Writing includes Waywords and Meansigns in their "Joyce Today" collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Contemporary Irish Writing website| url=http://www.contemporaryirishwriting.ie/joyce-today |title=Joyce Today |access-date=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

While many reviews of Waywords and Meansigns celebrate the project for its uniqueness and ambition, other reviewers find the project's massive scope daunting. The project has been lauded for its digital distribution platform, utilizing [[Creative Commons license|Creative Commons licensing]] to freely distribute audio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jesse Jarnow |url=http://flavorwire.com/556284/alternate-routes-mozart-and-joyce-reimagined-inside-baseball-and-more |title=Alternate Routes: James Joyce, Baseball, and ’90s Film Inspire Wildly Ambitious Musical Experiments|date=19 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.openculture.com/2016/02/finnegans-wake-read-by-17-artists.html |title=Hear James Joyce’s Finnegans Wake Read Unabridged &amp; Set to Music By 17 Different Artists |date=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing for ''[[The Guardian]]'', Billy Mills described ''Waywords and Meansigns'' as one of many Internet-based projects helping to make Joyce's famously obscure novel more approachable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Billy Mills |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2015/apr/28/finnegans-wake-james-joyce-modern-interpretations |title=Finnegans Wake - the book the web was invented for |date=28 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; While premiering advance audio from the second edition, Bort of [[Tiny Mix Tapes]] wrote "this massive undertaking will provide an endless supply of head scratches and cheers alike to its undertakers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Bort |url=http://www.tinymixtapes.com/chocolate-grinder/premiere-waywords-and-meansigns-recreating-finnegans-wake-its-whole-wholume-excerp |title=Waywords and Meansigns: Recreating Finnegans Wake [In Its Whole Wholume] [excerpts] |date=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

While reviewing [[Neil Campbell (musician)|Neil Campbell]]'s contribution in [[The Wire (magazine)|''The Wire'']], Dan Barrow spoke positively of the overall project: "As a putative adaptation of the ''Wake'', does the approach of ''Waywords and Meansigns'' work? Undoubtedly."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Barrow |first=Dan |date=February 2016 |title=Review of Neil Campbell, Waywords and Meansigns |journal=The Wire |issue=384 |pages=58–59}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[James Joyce Centre]] dubbed the first edition "31 hours, 8 minutes, 11 seconds worth of delightful strangeness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Emily Carson |url=http://jamesjoyce.ie/waywords-meansigns-now-available-online/ |title=Waywords &amp; Meansigns now available online! |date=6 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

James Joyce scholar Finn Fordham called the project "wonderfully innovative" and described the second edition as "a series of unexpected transformations of this endlessly transformative text."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Marta Bausells |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/feb/02/finnegans-wake-music-james-joyce-birthday |title=Finnegans Wake: a musical reading sounds out a cryptic text |website=The Guardian|date=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The open information site and public domain blog Open Culture featured all three editions of the project, writing of the first edition "as with all compilation albums, some tracks are better than others... It is definitely a labor of love."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ted Mills |url=http://www.openculture.com/2015/05/listen-to-james-joyces-finnegans-wake-read-aloud-set-to-music-31-hours-unabridged.html |title=Hear James Joyce’s ''Finnegans Wake'' Read Aloud &amp; Set to Music: 31 Hours of Free Unabridged Audio |date=7 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Open Culture wrote of the second edition: "these artists try to transcend ordinary ways of reading great literature, and clearly have lots fun in the doing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.openculture.com/2016/02/finnegans-wake-read-by-17-artists.html |title=Hear James Joyce’s Finnegans Wake Read Unabridged &amp; Set to Music By 17 Different Artists |date=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aodhán Kelly and Tom De Keyser reviewed the first edition of Waywords and Meansigns for the ''[[James Joyce Quarterly]]''. Noting that "the project has gathered considerable interest among both the artistic community and Joyce enthusiasts and reading groups",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author =Aodhán Kelly and Tom De Keyser| title =''Waywords and Meansigns: Recreating "Finnegans Wake" (In Its Whole Wholume)'', directed by Derek Pyle| journal = ''James Joyce Quarterly''| issue = Volume 52, Number 1 | pages = 232 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kelly and De Keyser wrote that "each track is... a unique and completely personal interpretation of an artist's reading of the text".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author =Aodhán Kelly and Tom De Keyser| title =''Waywords and Meansigns: Recreating "Finnegans Wake" (In Its Whole Wholume)'', directed by Derek Pyle| journal = ''James Joyce Quarterly''| issue = Volume 52, Number 1 | pages = 230 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The review concludes: "While we cannot say that we enjoyed the music in all instances, the project does attempt to bring challenging literature to a broader public... add[ing] another layer of richness to the life of the book with its own musical interpretation as a new form of cultural production".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author =Aodhán Kelly and Tom De Keyser| title =''Waywords and Meansigns: Recreating "Finnegans Wake" (In Its Whole Wholume)'', directed by Derek Pyle| journal = ''James Joyce Quarterly''| issue = Volume 52, Number 1 | pages = 232–233 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]'''s Jay Horton wrote of the [[Waywords and Meansigns Opendoor Edition|third edition]]: "It’s soon enough made clear that there are as many varieties of musical renderings as there are interpretations of its prose, which sparks the likely-unavoidable problem concerning the songs and the book they’re taken from and the ideas it (barely) contains – there’s just too damn many."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jay Horton |url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2017/05/various-artists-waywords-and-meansigns---recreatin.html |title=Various Artists: Waywords and Meansigns - Recreating Finnegans Wake [in its whole wholume] Review |website=Paste|date=12 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her [[PopMatters]] review, Maria Schurr wrote of the third edition: "the well of inspiration springing from Joyce's words is thrillingly infinite."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Maria Schurr |url=http://www.popmatters.com/post/waywords-and-meansigns-recreating-finnegans-wake-premiere/ |title=Waywords and Meansigns - Recreating Finnegans Wake (premiere) |website=PopMatters|date=5 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Open Culture's Josh Jones deemed the third edition "one of the most appropriate responses to the novel in the 78 years since its publication."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.openculture.com/2017/05/hear-james-joyces-finnegans-wake-set-to-music-features-100-musicians-including-pioneering-punk-bassist-mike-watt.html |title=Hear a Reading of James Joyce’s Finnegans Wake Set to Music: Features 100+ Musicians and Readers from Across the World |date=4 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Women's Caucus for Art Lifetime Achievement Award''' was established under the presidency of Lee Ann Miller (1978–80). [[Joan Mondale]], artist and wife of vice-president [[Walter Mondale]], helped to secure approval for a national award honoring women's achievements in the arts, and [[Jimmy Carter]] presided over the first [[Women's Caucus for Art]] award ceremony in the Oval Office in 1980.&lt;ref name="Dickinson"&gt;Eleanor Dickinson, [http://www.nationalwca.org/wcadocs/TheHistory%20of%20the%20WCA.pdf The History of the Women's Caucus for Art].
