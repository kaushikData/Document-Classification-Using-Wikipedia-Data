      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3746">The [[Democratic Alliance (South Africa)|Democratic Alliance]] held its 6th Federal Congress in [[Port Elizabeth, South Africa|Port Elizabeth]], [[Eastern Cape]] from 9 May to 10 May 2015. After incumbent leader [[Helen Zille]] announced she would not seek reelection, the congress became focused on the contest to succeed her.

==Election for Party Leader==
When the nominations deadline had passed, four candidates for the leadership had been put forward: Federal Chairperson [[Wilmot James]], Parliamentary Leader [[Mmusi Maimane]], Adrian Naidoo, and Morgan Oliphant&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/Voting-closed-for-new-DA-leaders-20150510|title=Voting closed for new DA leaders|work=News24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the month leading to the vote, the two leading candidates, James and Maimane, traded barbs over issues such party democracy, transparency, and who would be most successful in challenging the ruling [[African National Congress]]. The two candidates addressed the provincial party congress in [[KwaZulu-Natal]] where James challenged Mamaine to a series of debates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sabc.co.za/news/f1/da875980484354649f93ff4d1170398b/DA's-Maimane,-James-to-face-off-in-debate--20150505|title=SABC News - DAs Maimane, James to face off in debate :Tuesday 5 May 2015|author=Zanele Buthelezi|work=sabc.co.za}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Continuing his criticism of Maimane's commitment to intra-party democracy and transparency, James released his list of donors in the last week of the campaign and called on his rival to do the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sabc.co.za/news/a/05c544004833c8a0b8ddff4d1170398b/DAundefinedcandidatesundefinedurgedundefinedtoundefinedbeundefinedfinanciallyundefinedtransparent-20153004|title=SABC News - DA candidates urged to be financially transparent:Thursday 30 April 2015|author=Mercedes Besent|work=sabc.co.za}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 10, following a vote by party delegates, outgoing leader Helen Zille declared Mamaine as the duly elected leader of the Democratic Alliance. 93% of delegates voted in the leadership race.&lt;ref name="news24.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/Maimane-elected-new-DA-leader-20150510|title=Maimane elected new DA leader|work=News24}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to his campaign, Maimane won with 90% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/politics/maimane-won-by-90-1.1856397#.VV0YLPlViko|title=‘Maimane won by 90%’|author=Independent Newspapers Online|work=Independent Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is the first black South African to lead the party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sabc.co.za/news/a/11e637004854c3d78ef9bfe1ccb64421/Iundefinedwon%E2%80%99tundefinedbeundefinedanyone%E2%80%99sundefinedpuppet:undefinedMaimane-20151105|title=SABC News - I won’t be anyone’s puppet: Maimane:Monday 11 May 2015|author=Busi Chimombe|work=sabc.co.za}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other Internal Party Elections==

Eastern Cape DA Leader [[Athol Trollip]] was elected as Federal Chairperson.

James Selfe was reelected unopposed as chair of the federal council. Alf Lees was elected federal finance chair. Thomas Walters was elected deputy chair of the federal council. Ivan Meyer, Refiloe Ntsekhem and Desiree van der Walt were elected as first, second, and third deputy chairs respectively.&lt;ref name="news24.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://citizen.co.za/379617/maimane-is-the-new-leader-of-the-democratic-alliance/|title=Maimane is the new leader of the Democratic Alliance|author=Citizen Reporter and ANA|work=The Citizen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Imperial Territory of Alsace-Lorraine''' ({{lang-de|Reichsland Elsaß-Lothringen}} or {{lang|de|Elsass-Lothringen}}) was a territory created by the [[German Empire]] in 1871, after it annexed most of [[Alsace]] and the [[Moselle (department)|Moselle]] department of [[Lorraine (region)|Lorraine]] following its victory in the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. The Alsatian part lay in the Rhine Valley on the west bank of the [[Rhine River]] and east of the [[Vosges Mountains]]. The Lorraine section was in the upper [[Moselle valley]] to the north of the Vosges.

The territory encompassed 93% of [[Alsace]] and 26% of [[Lorraine (region)|Lorraine]], while the rest of these regions remained part of France. For historical reasons, specific legal dispositions are still applied in the territory in the form of a "[[Local law in Alsace-Moselle|local law]]". In relation to its special legal status, since its reversion to France following [[World War I]], the territory has been referred to administratively as '''Alsace-Moselle'''.&lt;ref group=note&gt;An instruction dated 1920-08-14 from the assistant Secretary of State of the Presidency of the Council to the General Commissioner of the Republic in Strasbourg reminds that the term ''Alsace-Lorraine'' is prohibited and must be replaced by the sentence "the [[département of France|département]] of [[Haut-Rhin]], the département of [[Bas-Rhin]] and the département of [[Moselle]]". While this sentence was considered too long, some used the term ''Alsace-Moselle'' to point to the three concerned départements. However, this instruction has no legal status because it is not based on any territorial authority.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2016, the historical territory is now part of the [[Regions of France|French administrative region]] of [[Grand Est]].

==Geography==
Alsace-Lorraine had a land area of {{convert|14,496|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. Its capital was [[Strasbourg|Straßburg]]. It was divided in three districts (''Bezirke'' in German):
* [[Oberelsass]] (Upper Alsace), whose capital was [[Colmar|Kolmar]], had a land area of 3,525&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and corresponds exactly to the current [[département of France|department]] of [[Haut-Rhin]]
* [[Unterelsass]], (Lower Alsace), whose capital was [[Strasbourg|Straßburg]], had a land area of 4,755&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and corresponds exactly to the current department of [[Bas-Rhin]]
* [[Bezirk Lothringen|Lothringen]], (Lorraine), whose capital was [[Metz]], had a land area of 6,216&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and corresponds exactly to the current department of [[Moselle (department)|Moselle]]

===Towns and cities===
The largest urban areas in Alsace-Lorraine at the 1910 census were:
* [[Strasbourg|Straßburg]] (now ''Strasbourg''): 220,883 inhabitants
* [[Mulhouse|Mülhausen]] (''Mulhouse''): 128,190 inhabitants
* [[Metz]]: 102,787 inhabitants
* [[Thionville|Diedenhofen]] (''Thionville''): 69,693 inhabitants
* [[Colmar]] (also historically ''Kolmar''): 44,942 inhabitants

==History==

===Background===
{{Main|French–German enmity|Causes of the Franco-Prussian War}}

The modern history of Alsace-Lorraine was largely influenced by the rivalry between [[French nationalism|French]] and [[German nationalism]].

France long sought to attain and preserve its "[[Natural borders of France|natural boundaries]]", which were the [[Pyrenees]] to the southwest, the [[Alps]] to the southeast, and the [[Rhine River]] to the northeast. These strategic claims led to the annexation of territories located west of the Rhine river in the [[Holy Roman Empire#Baroque period|Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation]]. What is now known as Alsace was progressively conquered by [[Louis XIV]] in the 17th century, while Lorraine was incorporated in the 18th century under [[Louis XV]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=William James |last=Roosen |title=The age of Louis XIV: the rise of modern diplomacy |page=55 |date=2013 |publisher=Transaction Publishers |oclc=847763358}}&lt;/ref&gt;

German nationalism, which resurfaced following the [[French period|French occupation of Germany]] under [[Napoleon]], sought to unify all the [[German-speaking Europe|German-speaking populations]] of the former [[Holy Roman Empire#Name|Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation]] into a single [[nation-state]]. As various [[German dialects]] were spoken by most of the population of Alsace and [[Moselle (department)|Moselle]] (northern Lorraine), these regions were viewed by German nationalists to be rightfully part of hoped-for united Germany in the future.

In 1871, the newly created German Empire's demand for Alsace from France after its victory in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] was not simply a [[punitive]] measure. The transfer was controversial even among the Germans: The [[Chancellor of Germany (German Reich)|German Chancellor]], [[Otto von Bismarck]], was initially opposed to it, as he thought it would engender permanent French enmity toward Germany. &lt;ref&gt; Churchill, W. S., "The World Crisis, Vol. I: 1911-1914, Bloomsbury Academic, 2015,  p. 4." &lt;/ref&gt; Some German industrialists did not want the competition from Alsatian industries, such as the cloth makers who would be exposed to competition from the sizeable industry in Mulhouse. [[Karl Marx]] also warned his fellow Germans: "If Alsace and Lorraine are taken, then France will later make war on Germany in conjunction with Russia. It is unnecessary to go into the unholy consequences." &lt;ref&gt;Fernbach, David (ed.) ''Marx: The First International and After'', p. 178, Letter to the Brunswick committee of the Social-Democratic Workers' Party, from ''Marx-Engels-Werke''&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the [[German Emperor]], [[Wilhelm I, German Emperor|Wilhelm I]], eventually sided with army commander [[Helmuth von Moltke the Elder|Helmuth von Moltke]], other Prussian generals and other officials who argued that a westward shift in the French border was necessary for strategic military and ethnographic reasons. From an ethnic perspective, the transfer involved people who for the most part spoke [[Alemannic German]] dialects. From a military perspective, by early 1870s standards, shifting the frontier away from the [[Rhine]] would give the Germans a strategic buffer against feared future French attacks. Due to the annexation, the Germans gained control of the fortifications of [[Metz]], though it was a French-speaking town; of [[Strasbourg]] (Straßburg) on the left bank of the Rhine; and of most of the iron resources of Lorraine.

However, domestic politics in the new Reich may have been decisive. Although it was effectively led by Prussia, the new German Empire was a decentralized federal state. The new arrangement left many senior Prussian generals with serious misgivings about leading diverse military forces to guard a prewar frontier that, except for the northernmost section, was part of two other states of the new Empire – [[Baden]] and [[Kingdom of Bavaria|Bavaria]]. As recently as the 1866 [[Austro-Prussian War]], these states had been Prussia's enemies. In the new Empire's constitution, both states, but especially Bavaria, had been given concessions with regard to local autonomy, including partial control of their military forces. For this reason, the Prussian [[General Staff]] argued that it was necessary for the Reich's frontier with France to be under direct Prussian control.{{Citation needed|reason=Makes claims about the statements of particular people, should be verified. |date=April 2014}} Creating a new Imperial Territory ({{lang|de|Reichsland}}) out of formerly French territory would achieve this goal: although a Reichsland would not be part of the Kingdom of Prussia, being governed directly from Berlin it would be under Prusso-German control. Thus, by annexing Alsace-Lorraine, Berlin was able to avoid complications with Baden and Bavaria on such matters as new fortifications.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

Memories of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] were still quite fresh in the 1870s. Right up until the Franco-Prussian War, the French had maintained a long-standing desire to establish their entire eastern frontier on the Rhine, and thus they were viewed by most 19th century Germans as an aggressive people. In the years before 1870, it is arguable that the Germans feared the French more than the French feared the Germans. Many Germans at the time thought that the creation of the new Empire in itself would be enough to earn [[French–German enmity|permanent French enmity]], and thus desired a defensible border with their old enemy. Any additional enmity that would be earned from territorial concessions was downplayed as marginal and insignificant in the overall scheme of things.

The annexed area consisted of the northern part of Lorraine, along with [[Alsace]]. The area around the town of [[Belfort]] (now the French ''département'' of [[Territoire de Belfort]]) was unaffected, because Belfort had been [[siege of Belfort|defended]] by [[Pierre Philippe Denfert-Rochereau|Colonel Denfert-Rochereau]], who surrendered only after receiving orders from Paris, and was compensated by another territory. The town of [[Montbéliard]] and its surrounding area to the south of Belfort, which have been part of the [[Doubs (département)|Doubs department]] since 1816, and therefore were not considered part of Alsace, were not included, although they were a Protestant enclave, as it belonged to [[Württemberg]] from 1397 to 1806. This area corresponded to the French ''[[département]]s'' of [[Bas-Rhin]] (in its entirety), [[Haut-Rhin]] (except the area of Belfort and Montbéliard), and a small area in the northeast of the [[Vosges département]], all of which made up Alsace, and the ''départements'' of [[Moselle]] (four-fifths of it) and the northeast of [[Meurthe Department|Meurthe]] (one-third of Meurthe), which were the eastern part of Lorraine.

The rest of the département of Meurthe was joined with the westernmost part of Moselle which had escaped German annexation to form the new département of [[Meurthe-et-Moselle]].

[[File:Gare de Metz R01.jpg|thumb|The neo-Romanesque Metz railway station, built in 1908. Kaiser [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]] instigated the construction of various buildings in Alsace-Lorraine supposedly representative of German architecture.]]

The new border between France and Germany mainly followed the geolinguistic divide between French and German dialects, except in a few valleys of the Alsatian side of the [[Vosges mountains]], the city of [[Metz]] and its region and in the area of [[Château-Salins]] (formerly in the Meurthe ''département''), which were annexed by Germany although most people there spoke French.&lt;ref group=note&gt;The linguistic border ran on the north of the new border, including in the "Alemannic" territories [[Thionville]] (also named ''[[Diedenhofen]]'' under the German Reich), [[Metz]], [[Château-Salins]], [[Vic-sur-Seille]] and [[Dieuze]], which were fully French-speaking. The valleys of [[Orbey]] and [[Sainte-Marie-aux-Mines]] were in the same case. Similarly, the town of Dannemarie (and adjoining areas) were also left in [[Alsace]] when language alone could have made them part of [[Territoire de Belfort]].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1900, 11.6% of the population of Alsace-Lorraine spoke French as their first language (11.0% in 1905, 10.9% in 1910).

That small francophone areas were affected, was used in France to denounce the new border as hypocrisy, since Germany had justified the annexation on linguistic grounds. However, the German administration was tolerant of the use of the French language (in sharp contrast to the use of the Polish language in the [[Province of Posen]]), and French was permitted as an official language and school language in those areas where it was spoken by a majority. This would only change with the First World War in 1914.

The [[Treaty of Frankfurt (1871)|Treaty of Frankfurt]] gave the residents of the region until October 1, 1872 to choose between emigrating to France or remaining in the region and having their nationality legally changed to German. About 161,000 people, or around 10.4% of the Alsace-Lorraine population, opted for French citizenship (the so-called ''Optanden''); however, only about 50,000 actually emigrated, while the rest acquired German citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;Sophie Charlotte Preibusch: ''Verfassungsentwicklungen im Reichsland Elsass-Lothringen 1871–1918''. In: ''Berliner Juristische Universitätsschriften, Grundlagen des Rechts.'' Vol 38, {{ISBN|3-8305-1112-4}}, p. 96.

The sentiment of attachment to France stayed strong at least during the first 16 years of the annexation. During the Reichstag elections, the 15 deputies of 1874, 1881, 1884 (but one) and 1887 were called ''protester deputies'' (fr: {{lang|fr|députés protestataires}}) because they expressed to the [[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]] their opposition to the annexation by means of the ''1874 motion'' in the French language: « May it please the Reichstag to decide that the populations of Alsace-Lorraine that were annexed, without having been consulted, to the German Reich by the treaty of Frankfurt have to come out particularly about this annexation. »&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/histoire/deputes-protestataires.asp Les députés "protestataires" d'Alsace-Lorraine] (French)&lt;/ref&gt; The Saverne Affair (usually known in English-language accounts as the [[Zabern Affair]]), in which abusive and oppressive behaviour by the military towards the population of the town of Saverne led to protests not just in Alsace but in other regions, put a severe strain on the relationship between the people of Alsace-Lorraine and the rest of the German Empire.

Under the German Empire of 1871–1918, the annexed territory constituted the ''Reichsland'' or Imperial Territory of {{lang|de|Elsaß-Lothringen}} (German for Alsace-Lorraine). The area was administered directly from Berlin, but was granted limited autonomy in 1911. This included its constitution and state assembly, its own flag, and the {{lang|de|[[Elsässisches Fahnenlied]]}} ("Alsatian Flag Song") as its anthem.

FVp: [[Progressive People's Party (Germany)|Progressive People's Party]]. formed in 1910 as a merger of all leftist liberal parties.

====During World War I====
{{further|World War I}}
[[File:Zabern Militärpatrouille.PNG|thumb|German patrol during the Saverne Affair]]
[[File:Fusillés de Gertwiller.jpg|thumb|Translation: ''Here at [[Gertwiller]] on 22 August 1914 three Alsatian farmers were shot, against all justice. (...) innocent victims of German barbarity. Alsatians! Remember!'']]

In French foreign policy, the demand for the return of Alsace and Lorraine faded in importance after 1880 with the decline of the monarchists element. When the World War broke out in 1914, recovery of the two lost provinces became the top French war goal.&lt;ref&gt;Frederic H.  Seager, "The Alsace-Lorraine Question in France, 1871-1914." in Charles K. Warner, ed., ''From the Ancien Regime to the Popular Front'' (1969): 111-126.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 20th century, the increased militarization of Europe, and the lack of negotiation between major powers, led to harsh and rash actions taken by both sides in respect to Alsace-Lorraine during [[World War I]]. As soon as war was declared, both the French and German authorities used the inhabitants of Alsace-Lorraine as propaganda pawns. {{citation needed|reason=this seems very POV and needs some sort of proof|date=December 2015}}

Germans living in France were arrested and placed into camps by the French authorities. Upon occupying certain villages, veterans of the 1870 conflict were sought out and arrested by the French army.&lt;ref&gt;In 1914, [[Albert Schweitzer]] was put under supervision in [[Lambaréné]], [[French Equatorial Africa]]; in 1917, he was taken to France and incarcerated until July 1918.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Germans responded to the outbreak of war with harsh measures against the Alsace-Lorraine populace:&lt;ref&gt;Charles Spindler, ''L'Alsace pendant la Guerre'', 6 septembre 1914 and 11 septembre 1915.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Saverne Affair]] had convinced the high command that the population was hostile to the German Empire and that it should be forced into submission.{{citation needed|reason=this seems very POV and needs some sort of proof|date=December 2015}} German troops occupied some homes. The German military feared French partisans – or ''[[francs-tireurs]]'', as they had been called during the Franco-Prussian War – would reappear.

German authorities developed policies aimed at reducing the influence of French. In Metz, French street names, which had been displayed in French and German, were suppressed in January 1915. Six months later, on July 15, 1915, German became the only official language in the region,&lt;ref&gt;Grandhomme, Jean-Noël (2008) ''Boches ou tricolores''. Strasbourg: La nuée bleue.&lt;/ref&gt; leading to the Germanization of the towns’ names effective September 2, 1915.

Prohibiting the speaking of French in public further increased the exasperation of some of the natives, who were long accustomed to mixing their conversation with French language (see [[code-switching]]); however, the use even of one word, as innocent as "''bonjour''", could incur a fine.&lt;ref group=note&gt;As of on October 26, 1914, we can read in Spindler's journal: "Then he recommends to me not to speak French. The streets are infested with informers, men and women, who touch rewards and make arrest the passers by for a simple « merci » said in French. It goes without saying that these measures excite the joker spirit of the people. A woman at the market, who probably was unaware that "''bonchour''" and "''merci''" was French, is taken with part by a German woman because she answered her "''Guten Tag''" by a "''bonchour ''". Then, the good woman, the fists on the hips, challenges her client : "Now I'm fed up with your silly stories! Do you know what? [here something like "''kiss my ...''"]! Is that endly also French? » (als: Jetz grad genua mit dene dauwe Plän! Wisse Sie was? Leeke Sie mich ...! Esch des am End au franzêsch?)"&lt;/ref&gt; Some ethnic Germans in the region cooperated in the persecution as a way to demonstrate German patriotism.&lt;ref group=note&gt;We can read in ''L'Alsace pendant la guerre'' how the exasperation of the population gradually increased but Spindler hears on September 29, 1914, a characteristic sentence: « ... the interior decorator H., who repairs the mattresses of the Ott house, said to me this morning: “If only it was the will of God that we became again French and that these damned "''Schwowebittel''" were thrown out of the country! And then, you know, there are chances that it happens.” It is the first time since the war I hear a simple man expressing frankly this wish. »&lt;/ref&gt;

German authorities became increasingly worried about renewed French nationalism. The Reichsland governor stated in February 1918: "''Sympathies towards France and repulsion for Germans have penetrated to a frightening depth the petty bourgeoisie and the peasantry''".&lt;ref&gt;Grandhomme, Jean-Noël. op.cit.&lt;/ref&gt; But in order to spare them possible confrontations with relatives in France but also to avoid any desertion from the Alsatian soldiers to the French army,&lt;ref group=note&gt;One of the famous case was the desertion from all the Alsatian soldiers from their German bataillion the eve of the Verdun offensive to warn the French army from the imminent attack&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alain Denizot - (1996) - "Guerre mondiale, 1914-1918 - Campagnes et batailles" 67-68&lt;/ref&gt; German Army draftees from Alsace-Lorraine were sent mainly to the Eastern front, or the Navy ({{lang|de|[[Kaiserliche Marine]]}}). About 15,000 Alsatians and Lorrainers served in the German Navy.

===Annexation to the French Republic===
{{Main|November 1918 in Alsace-Lorraine}}
[[File:André Bas et Marthe Kuentz - 1919.jpg|thumb|An Alsatian in traditional dress and a French officer, c. 1919]]
In the [[German Revolution|general revolutionary atmosphere]] of the expiring [[Second German Empire|German Empire]], [[Marxist]] councils of workers and soldiers ({{lang|de|Soldaten und Arbeiterräte}}) formed in Mulhouse, in Colmar and Strasbourg in November 1918, in parallel to other such bodies set up in Germany, in imitation of the Russian equivalent ''[[Soviet (council)#Russian Revolution|soviets]]''.

[[File:Front page, Le Petit Journal, 8 December 1918.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Metz]] and the Lorraine returned to France'', front page of ''[[Le Petit Journal (newspaper)|Le Petit Journal]]'' newspaper dated from 8 December 1918]]

In this chaotic situation, Alsace-Lorraine's [[Landtag]] proclaimed itself the supreme authority of the land with the name of {{lang|de|Nationalrat}}, the Soviet of Strasbourg claimed the foundation of a ''Republic of Alsace-Lorraine'', while [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] [[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]] representative for Colmar, [[Jacques Peirotes]], announced the establishment of the French rule, urging Paris to send troops quickly.&lt;ref name="Fortier"&gt;
Jacques Fortier, « La chute de l'Empire », ''Dernières Nouvelles d'Alsace'', 16 November 2008 [[French language|(Fr.)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

While the soviet councils disbanded themselves with the departure of the German troops between November 11 and 17,&lt;ref name="JNGrandhomme"&gt;Jean-Noël Grandhomme, « Le retour de l'Alsace-Lorraine », ''L'Histoire'', number 336, November 2008 [[French language|(Fr.)]]&lt;/ref&gt; the arrival of the [[French Army]] stabilized the situation: French troops put the region under ''[[military occupation|occupatio bellica]]'' and entered Strasbourg on November 21. The Nationalrat proclaimed the annexation of Alsace to France on December 5, even though this process did not gain international recognition until the signature of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] in 1919.

Alsace-Lorraine was divided into the ''[[département]]s'' of [[Haut-Rhin]], [[Bas-Rhin]] and [[Moselle]] (the same political structure as before the annexation and as created by the French Revolution, with slightly different limits). Today, these territories enjoy laws that are significantly different from the rest of France – these specific provisions are known as the [[Local law in Alsace-Moselle|local law]].

The département [[Meurthe-et-Moselle]] was maintained even after France recovered Alsace-Lorraine in 1919. The area of Belfort became a special status area and was not reintegrated into [[Haut-Rhin]] in 1919 but instead was made a full-status département in 1922 under the name [[Territoire-de-Belfort]].&lt;ref group=note&gt;However, on the Colmar prefecture building, the name of Belfort can be seen as a sous-prefecture.&lt;/ref&gt;

The French Government immediately started a [[Francization]] campaign that included the forced deportation of all Germans who had settled in the area after 1870. For that purpose, the population was divided in four categories: A (French citizens before 1870), B (descendants of such French citizens), C (citizens of Allied or neutral states) and D (enemy aliens - Germans). By July 1921, 111,915 people categorized as "D" had been expelled to Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ordnungsgemäße Überführung - Die Vertreibung der Deutschen nach dem Zweiten Weltkrieg|first=R.M.|last=Douglas|publisher=C.H.Beck|year=2012|ISBN=978-3-406-62294-6|pages=94 f|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Tabellarische Geschichte Elsaß-Lothringens / Französische Besatzung (1918-1940)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |url=http://www.geocities.com/bfel/geschichte6.html |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kmXUnBss?url=http://www.geocities.com/bfel/geschichte6.html |archivedate=2009-10-25 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; German-language Alsatian newspapers were also suppressed.

=== World War II ===
{{main|Malgré-nous}}
[[File:ObernaiMalgréNous.JPG|thumb|Monument to the Malgré-nous in [[Obernai]], [[Alsace]]]]
After the [[Battle of France|defeat of France]] in the spring of 1940, Alsace and Moselle were not formally annexed by [[Nazi Germany]]. Although the terms of the armistice specified that the integrity of the whole French territory could not be modified in any way, [[Adolf Hitler]], the German [[Führer]], drafted an annexation law in 1940 that he kept secret, expecting to announce it in the event of a German victory.&lt;ref&gt;Eberhard Jäckel, ''La France dans l'Europe de Hitler, op. cit.'', p. 123-124.&lt;/ref&gt; Through a series of laws which individually seemed minor, Berlin took full control of Alsace-Lorraine, and Alsatians-Lorrainians could be drafted into the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German Army]]. During the occupation, Moselle was integrated into a [[Reichsgau]] named [[Administrative divisions of Nazi Germany|Westmark]] and Alsace was amalgamated with [[Baden]]. Beginning in 1942, people from Alsace and Moselle were made German citizens by decree of the [[Government of Nazi Germany|Nazi government]].&lt;ref&gt;Eberhard Jäckel, « L'annexion déguisée », dans ''Frankreich in Hitlers Europa – Die deutsche Frankreichpolitik im Zweiten Weltkrieg'', Deutsche Verlag-Anstalg GmbH, Stuttgart, 1966, p. 123-124.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in October 1942, young Alsatian and Lorrainian men were inducted into the [[Wehrmacht|German armed forces]]. Sometimes they were known as the {{lang|fr|malgré-nous}}, which could be translated in English as "against our will".&lt;ref group=note&gt;(The term actually appeared after World War I.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Schlund, ''Souvenirs de guerre d'un Alsacien'', Éditions Mille et une vies, 2011, {{ISBN|978-2-923692-18-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Durand, ''En passant par la Lorraine ; gens et choses de chez nous 1900-1945'', Éditions Le Lorrain, 1945, {{pp.|131-132}}&lt;/ref&gt; A small minority, however, volunteered, notably the author of ''[[The Forgotten Soldier]]'', known by the pseudonym [[Guy Sajer]]. Ultimately, 100,000 Alsatians and 30,000 Mosellans were enrolled, many of them to fight on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] against the [[Red Army|Soviet Red Army]]. Most of those who survived the war were interned in [[Tambov]] in Russia in 1945. Many others [[operation Overlord|fought in Normandy]] against the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] as the {{lang|fr|malgré-nous}} of the [[2nd SS Panzer Division Das Reich]], some of which were involved in the [[Oradour-sur-Glane massacre|Oradour sur Glane]] and [[Tulle massacre|Tulle]] war crimes.

Speaking Alsatian, [[Lorraine Franconian]] or French was prohibited under German occupation, and learning German was obligatory.

===Religion===
When Alsace and the [[Bezirk Lothringen|Lorraine department]] became part of Germany, the French laws regarding religious bodies were preserved, with special privileges to the then recognised religions of Calvinism, Judaism, Lutheranism and Roman Catholicism, under a system known as the [[Concordat in Alsace-Moselle|Concordat]]. However, the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Metz|Roman Catholic dioceses of Metz]] and [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Strasbourg|of Strasbourg]] became [[Exemption (church)|exempt]] jurisdictions. The {{Interlanguage link multi|Evangelical Lutheran Church of France|fr|3=Église évangélique luthérienne de France|lt=Church of Augsburg Confession of France}}, with its directory, supreme consistory and the bulk of its parishioners residing in Alsace, was reorganised as the [[Protestant Church of Augsburg Confession of Alsace and Lorraine]] (EPCAAL) in 1872, but territorially reconfined to Alsace-Lorraine only. The five local Calvinist consistories, originally part of the [[Reformed Church of France]], formed a statewide synod in 1895, the [[Reformed Church of Alsace and Lorraine|Protestant Reformed Church of Alsace and Lorraine]] (EPRAL). The three [[Consistory (Judaism)|Israelite consistories]] in {{Interlanguage link multi|Colmar Consistory|de|3=Consistoire Colmar|lt=Colmar}}, {{Interlanguage link multi|Metz Consistory|de|3=Consistoire Metz|lt=Metz}} and {{Interlanguage link multi|Strasbourg Consistory|de|3=Consistoire Straßburg|lt=Strasbourg}} were disentangled from supervision by the [[Central Consistory|Israelite Central Consistory of France]] and continued as separate [[statutory corporation]]s which never formed a joint body, but cooperated. All the mentioned religious bodies retained the status as ''établissements publics de culte'' (public bodies of [[Religion]]). When the new Alsace-Lorraine constitution of 1911 provided for a [[Bicameralism|bicameral]] state parliament ({{Interlanguage link multi|Landtag of Alsace-Lorraine|fr|3=Landtag d'Alsace-Lorraine}}) each recognised religion was entitled to send a representative into the first chamber of the Landtag as [[ex officio]] members (the [[Bishop of Strasbourg|bishops of Strasbourg]] and of Metz, the presidents of EPCAAL and EPRAL, and a delegate of the three Israelite consistories).

===Languages===
[[File:Alsace-Lorraine Dialects.png|thumb|310px|Spatial distribution of dialects in Alsace-Lorraine before the expansion of [[standard French]] in the 20th century]]
Both [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] and [[Romance languages|Romance]] dialects were traditionally spoken in Alsace-Lorraine before the 20th century.

Germanic dialects:
* [[Central German]] dialects:
** [[Luxembourgish language|Luxembourgish Franconian]] aka Luxembourgish in the north-west of [[Moselle]] (''Lothringen'') around [[Thionville]] (''Diddenuewen'' in the local Luxembourgish dialect) and [[Sierck-les-Bains]] (''Siirk'' in the local Luxembourgish dialect).
** [[Moselle Franconian]] in the central northern part of Moselle around [[Boulay-Moselle]] (''Bolchin'' in the local Moselle Franconian dialect) and [[Bouzonville]] (''Busendroff'' in the local Moselle Franconian dialect).
** [[Rhine Franconian]] in the north-east of Moselle around [[Forbach]] (''Fuerboch'' in the local Rhine Franconian dialect), [[Bitche]] (''Bitsch'' in the local Rhine Franconian dialect), and [[Sarrebourg]] (''Saarbuerj'' in the local Rhine Franconian dialect), as well as in the north-west of [[Alsace]] around [[Sarre-Union]] (''Buckenum'' in the local Rhine Franconian dialect) and [[La Petite-Pierre]] (''Lítzelstain'' in the local Rhine Franconian dialect).
* Transitional between Central German and Upper German:
** [[South Franconian]] in the northernmost part of Alsace around [[Wissembourg]] (''Waisseburch'' in the local South Franconian dialect).
* [[Upper German]] dialects:
** [[Alsatian language|Alsatian]] in the largest part of Alsace and in a few villages around [[Phalsbourg]] in the extreme south-east of Moselle. Alsatian was the most spoken dialect in Alsace-Lorraine.
** [[High Alemannic]] in the southernmost part of Alsace, around [[Saint-Louis, Haut-Rhin|Saint-Louis]] and [[Ferrette]] (''Pfirt'' in the local High Alemannic dialect).

Romance dialects (belonging to the [[langues d'oïl]] like French):

{{Forms of government}}
'''Androcracy''' is a [[form of government]] in which the government rulers are male.  The males, especially fathers, have the central roles of political leadership, moral authority, and control of property. It is also sometimes called a '''phallocracy''', '''phallocratic''', '''andrarchy''', or an '''[[androcentric]]''' society. This term derives from the Greek root words ''andros'', "man", and ''krateo'' (as in [[democracy|democratic]]), or "to rule".

==Example==

Traditionally, influential political positions have been disproportionately occupied by males. With the rise of [[feminism]] since the late 19th century, opinions concerning women in politics have changed in a manner that has facilitated an increase in female political participation. Nevertheless, there continues to be a considerable disparity between the percentage of males and females in politics. Currently, women represent 19.4 percent of all parliamentarians in the regions of Europe, the Americas, Sub-Sahara Africa, Asia, the Pacific, the Arab States, and Nordic countries.&lt;ref name="ipu.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipu.org/wmn-e/arc/world311011.htm |title= Women in National Parliaments as of 31 October 2011 |accessdate=2 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130103004742/http://www.ipu.org/wmn-e/arc/world311011.htm | website = ipu.org | publisher = [[Inter-Parliamentary Union]] |archivedate=3 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The level of female participation in parliament varies between regions, ranging from percentages as high as 42 in Nordic countries to as low as 11.4 in Arabic states.&lt;ref name="ipu.org"/&gt;

Riane Eisler, in her book ''[[The Chalice and the Blade]]'', contrasts androcratic male-dominated society with [[wikt:gylany|gylany]], i.e., partnership society based on gender equality.&lt;ref name="Eisler"&gt;{{cite book | last = Eisler | first = Riane | author-link = Riane Eisler | title = [[The Chalice and the Blade|The chalice and the blade: our history, our future]] | pages = 24&amp;ndash;25 and 105&amp;ndash;106 | publisher = Harper &amp; Row | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | year = 1987 | isbn = 9780062502896 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gylany is balanced and equalitarian, and should not be confused with gynocracy or [[matriarchy]], which define systems where women impose hierarchical power over men.&lt;ref name="Eisler" /&gt;

==Gender bias==
Androcracy as a gender bias may influence the decision-making process in many countries. Kleinberg and Boris point to a dominant paradigm which promotes wage-earning fathers with financially dependent mothers, the exclusion of same-sex couples, and the marginalization of single-parent families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Boris | first1 = Eileen | last2 = Kleinberg | first2 = S.J. | title = Mothers and other workers: (re)conceiving labor, maternalism, and the state | journal = [[Journal of Women's History]] | volume = 15 | issue = 3 | pages = 90&amp;ndash;117 | publisher = [[Johns Hopkins University Press]] | doi = 10.1353/jowh.2003.0061 | date = Autumn 2003 | url = https://doi.org/10.1353/jowh.2003.0061 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20160918161002/https://caringlabor.wordpress.com/2010/12/02/eileen-boris-and-s-j-kleinberg-mothers-and-other-workers-reconceiving-labor-maternalism-and-the-state/ View online.]

==Gynecocracy==
{{Further|Matriarchy}}
The opposite of androcracy is gynecocracy, sometimes referred to as [[gynocracy]], or rule by women. It is related to but not synonymous with [[matriarchy]]. Evidence indicating historical gynecocracies survives mostly in mythology and in some archaeological records, although it is disputed by some authors, like Cynthia Eller in her book ''[[The Myth of Matriarchal Prehistory]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Eller | first = Cynthia | title = [[The Myth of Matriarchal Prehistory|Gentlemen and Amazons: the Myth of Matriarchal Prehistory, 1861-1900]] | publisher = University of California Press | location = Berkeley | year = 2011 | isbn = 9780520266766 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''bylaw enforcement officer''' is a law enforcement employee of a municipality, county or regional district, charged with the enforcement of non-criminal [[bylaws]], rules, laws, codes or regulations enacted by local governments.

This terminology is commonly used in [[Canada]] and some other [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries. In the Canadian province of [[Ontario]], bylaw enforcement officers are generally titled ''municipal law enforcement officers'', and in [[Newfoundland &amp; Labrador]], the term ''municipal enforcement officer'' is also used.

In the Canadian province of [[Alberta]], municipalities can appoint bylaw enforcements officers under the authority of section 555 and 556 of the ''Municipal Government Act''. There is a common misconception that all bylaw officers are community peace officers.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} However, a person appointed as a community peace officer can only enforce provincial acts and regulations. A community peace officer is not authorized to enforce municipal bylaws unless they are also appointed under the authority of the ''Municipal Government Act'', or if the specific bylaw states it can be enforced by a community peace officer working for that municipality. There are a number of municipalities in Alberta whose officers enforce only municipal bylaws as bylaw officers, others that only enforce provincial acts as community peace officers, and others that hold dual municipal and provincial appointments.

Municipalities in the [[United States]] more frequently use the terms ''[[code enforcement officer]]'' or ''[[municipal regulations officer]]'', although code enforcement officers in the United States often have a narrower scope of duties than municipal bylaw enforcement officers in Canada. Code enforcement officers in the United States are more like property standards officers in Canada. In the [[United Kingdom]], the word ''[[wikt:warden|warden]]'' is commonly used to describe various classes of non-police enforcement officers, and sometimes the title of ''[[inspector]]'' is also used in various jurisdictions. An environmental warden in [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]] has duties very similar to those of  a bylaw enforcement officer employed by a similar-sized city in Canada.

In [[Australia]], the terms ''law enforcement officer'', ''Shire Ranger'' or ''local laws officer'' are used for general-duty bylaw enforcement, ''traffic officer'' for parking enforcement only, and ''animal management officer'' (formerly known as ''ranger'' or ''[[council ranger]]'') for animal-related enforcement.

In [[Germany]] [[Code enforcement | order enforcement offices]] are established under the [[States of Germany | state´s]] laws and local regulations under different terms like ''Ordnungsamt'' (order enforcement office), ''Ordnungsdienst'' (order enforcement service), ''Gemeindevollzugsdienst'' (municipal code enforcement office), ''Polizeibehörde'' (police authority) or ''[[Municipal police (Germany) | Stadtpolizei]]'' (city police) for general-duty bylaw enforcement units. Currently there are no general regulations or standards for the training, there are different responsibilities and powers. The equipment and uniforms differ from town to town, some carry weapons and wear police-like or police uniforms, others just wear labeled jackets over plain clothes. Most of the order enforcement offices are established by the [[Municipalities of Germany | municipalities]], but can be established by the [[Districts of Germany | rural districts]] for their area of competence as well.&lt;ref&gt;https://anwaltauskunft.de/magazin/gesellschaft/staat-behoerden/aufgaben-und-rechte-was-das-ordnungsamt-darf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.paradisi.de/Freizeit_und_Erholung/Gesellschaft/Recht/Artikel/22866.php&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.halteverbot123.de/ordnungsamt-aufgaben-und-befugnisse.html&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Stadt Fulda - Ordnungsamt, Land Rover Freelander.JPG|thumb|Patrol car of Ordnungsamt [[Fulda]], [[Germany]]]]

In [[New Zealand]], local governments such as district/city councils usually appoint persons to undertake certain enforcement duties. Councils can employ persons such as: Enforcement Officers, Dog Control Officers, Parking Officers, Noise Control Officers, and Litter Officers. These positions are granted role-specific powers under legislation. Common parts of their roles may include enforcing bylaws made by the local council, such as dog-leash rules or parking restrictions.

===Structure and organization===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:CalgaryBylawOfficers.jpg|225px|thumb|right|wrap|Calgary Bylaw Services officers with new "Peace Officer" shoulder flashes, mandated under the ''Alberta Peace Officer Act of 2006''|{{deletable image-caption|1=Friday, 11 September 2009}}]] --&gt;
Within Canadian jurisdictions, the term Bylaw Enforcement Officer may refer to one or more classes of employees charged with enforcing bylaws, such as Animal Control Officers, Parking &amp; Traffic Enforcement Officers, Property Use Inspectors, Building Inspectors, and others, but more commonly refers to a person employed in a uniformed capacity for the purpose of enforcing a variety of bylaws in a high visibility role. Increasingly, municipalities are opting for this model of bylaw enforcement, as a multi-purpose approach to bylaw enforcement is less costly while offering more flexibility. Incumbents to such positions often require a higher degree of skill and experience than those employed in stratified enforcement roles. Many municipalities seek to recruit former or retired police officers to these positions, but the field has undergone significant change in the past several decades, and increased reliance on bylaw officers on the part of the municipal governments has expedited the professionalization of this field. Many Police Academies and/or Public Administration schools offer specialized training in bylaw enforcement.

===Types===
{{Refimprove|date=June 2012}}
Most bylaw enforcement services are structured in one of the following ways:

# '''General Bylaw Enforcement''' - where the Bylaw Enforcement Officer is responsible for many different bylaws, such as parking, business regulations, animal control, zoning, noise, signs, etc. Specialized trades inspection is still conducted by a skilled trades inspector with experience in the field, such as a Building Inspector or an Electrical or Plumbing Inspector. In this capacity, the general Bylaw Enforcement Officer is frequently asked to conduct added duties to respond to a problem. Specialized 'non' uniform services may be added to assist in enforcement duties where a different image is more productive - such as in the enforcement of business regulations. Some cities employ License Inspectors for tasks where the "suit" is more effective than the "badge."
# '''General Bylaw Enforcement without Animal Control''' - where the officers enforce various regulations, but do not conduct animal control, which is assigned to specialized Animal Control Officers or is contracted out to an outside agency such as the SPCA.
# '''Stratified or Diversified Bylaw Enforcement''' - where different tasks within bylaw enforcement are handled by different classes of employees. Parking regulations may be enforced by [[parking enforcement officer]]s, animal regulations by Animal Control Officers, different classes of Inspectors may exist for Licensing, Property Use, Signage, Garbage &amp; Waste, Environmental Protection/Recycling, Street Use or Engineering Inspectors, etc. This model is usually employed in larger cities, although it is frequently seen as bureaucratic and inefficient, since workloads may not warrant the employment of so many classes of personnel all for specialized tasks. This model is often inefficient because enforcement is conducted from City Hall or offices, through letters and reports, rather than through a more direct approach of site visits. Furthermore, this model offers significantly less flexibility to concentrate on more problematic areas, as there can be tendency for incumbents to "stick" to their own work and turn a blind eye to other problems, of which, in fairness, they may not be even aware due to a lack of training.

{{Original research|date=June 2012}}

For example, someone employed as a Bylaw Enforcement Officer in the general enforcement model may be attending to a call of an illegally parked vehicle and drive by a freshly erected sign which contravenes city regulation on where signs may be posted. A Parking Enforcement Officer attending the same call in a city which uses the stratified enforcement model would not take responsibility for signage issues and would not pay attention to the sign, or would likely even know that the sign has been posted illegally. His mind would be focused on the job at hand, which is only parking enforcement, and nothing else. In that model, a special complaint would usually have to be received from someone bothered by the sign enough and determined enough to have the issue taken up by the city, and the issue would hopefully be forwarded to the Signage Inspector working in the City Hall headquarters. The Inspector would then probably draft a letter and have the letter mailed. It would then take weeks, perhaps months to have the sign removed and the issue resolved; if the person who placed the sign fails to remove it, the Inspector would probably contact the engineering department or the maintenance crew supervisor and ask that a work order be made for the removal of the sign. The Inspector would most likely not issue tickets, and would "manage" the problem rather than "enforce" the bylaw. It would then take another period of time before the workorder was filled on a priority sequence. The general Bylaw Enforcement Officer working in a city with the more flexible unified model, on the other hand, could take proactive measures and attend to the problem immediately, since he is already on the scene, issuing a parking ticket. He would ascertain who the sign belongs to, attend the business being advertised on the sign, and can demand immediate corrective action in-person, and/or can remove the sign and/or provide a deadline and/or issue fines. Because general Bylaw Enforcement Officers are also responsible for animal control, they operate vans or trucks which can then serve the multi-purpose of having the necessary equipment, tools (such as pickers, shovels, wire, etc.) and cargo space at hand to impound illegally placed signs, clean up debris, or transport equipment. The unified model is therefore often seen as less wasteful, more efficient, more effective and offering a greater degree of accountability with less red tape.

===Peace Officer Status===
[[Image:Coq bylaws.JPG|185px|thumb|left|Bylaw Enforcement Officer patch from City of Coquitlam, BC, Canada]]
Today, all bylaw enforcement officers employed in Canada are ''de facto'' Peace Officers; in numerous provinces, bylaw officers are also ''de jure'' Peace Officers for the purpose of enforcing municipal laws, having been sworn under various Police Acts. Courts have ruled on several occasions, most recently in 2000 (in ''R. v. Turko''), that the definition of Peace Officer under section 2 of the Criminal Code of Canada includes bylaw officers as "other person[s] employed for the preservation or maintenance of the public peace or for the service or execution of civil process."&lt;ref&gt;Criminal Code of Canada, sec. 2&lt;/ref&gt; As such, while actually engaged in the execution of their duties, Bylaw Enforcement Officers are Peace Officers, independent of whether they are sworn or unsworn constables.

This was first proven in court in 1973, when two men were charged with Obstructing a Peace Officer in the Yukon Territory Magistrates Court in ''R. vs Jones and Hubert''&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''R. vs Jones'' [1975] 5 W.W.R. 197.&lt;/ref&gt; for their part in removing an impounded dog from an animal control van, contrary to the instructions given to them by an Animal Control Officer of the local municipality. This was the first "Peace Officer" test before a Canadian federal court to determine whether the definition of peace officer in the Criminal Code of Canada can be extended to bylaw officers, as "other persons employed for the preservation of peace." The Honourable Justice O'Connor ruled that the Animal Control Officer was in fact a Peace Officer, under the Criminal Code, but only while in the performance of his duty, and not for the purposes of any activities unrelated to his duties (such as enforcing criminal law). Furthermore, Justice O'Connor highlighted the severity and criminality of obstructing a bylaw officer: &lt;blockquote&gt;"It was submitted [to me] by the defendants that [they should have been charged under a section of the bylaw for hindering the bylaw officer, and not under the Criminal Code]. Having concluded that Mr. Malloy [the bylaw officer] was a peace officer for Criminal Code purposes, and having concluded that the charge under s. 118 of the Criminal Code applies [now sec. 129], I doubt whether s. 13 of the dog bylaw is intra vires of the council of the City of Whitehorse [in other words, who is or is not a peace officer is not up to municipal governments]. ''Obstruction of an animal control officer is a matter of criminal law over which the federal government has legislative jurisdiction.'' ... In any event it is not for the council of the City of Whitehorse to determine who is a peace officer for the purposes of the Criminal Code. That can only be done by Parliament."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Since then, several other court decisions have reaffirmed this ruling: in ''Moore v R'',&lt;ref&gt;''Moore v R'' [1975] 5 W.W.R. 176.&lt;/ref&gt; the Manitoba County Court held that a Poundkeeper was a peace officer within the meaning of Section 2 of the Criminal Code. Most recently, in 2000, in ''R vs Turko'', the Provincial Court of British Columbia ruled that a Capital Regional District (CRD) Bylaw Enforcement Officers were justified in arresting a person for failing to provide identification while engaged in enforcement of an anti-smoking bylaw, as the latter's refusal to provide identification constituted Obstruction of a Peace Officer (contrary to sec. 129 of the Criminal Code).&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Turko (Victoria: 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; "I conclude," Judge Ehrcke wrote in the judgment against Mr. Turko, "based on the duties the officers in this case were exercising that they were peace officers engaged in their duties when they attempted to enforce the bylaw against the accused. They were maintaining and preserving the public peace."&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Turko, pp. 10&lt;/ref&gt; Mr. Turko was convicted of Obstructing of a Peace Officer and Assault on a Peace Officer.

Not only did the Turko decision confirm Bylaw Officers were Peace Officers within the meaning of the Criminal Code, but it held that a bylaw officer had the powers to detain or arrest a person for failing to identify themselves according to section 129.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Turko Items 1, 2 &amp; 3&lt;/ref&gt;

This was further upheld in ''Woodward v. Capital Regional District et al. (2005)'', where two Bylaw Officers used force, including batons, to arrest a person for obstruction. Judge M. Hubbard ruled that Bylaw Officers were justified in arresting a person for failing to provide identification, and in so doing, using whatever reasonable force was necessary to subdue a person.&lt;ref&gt;Woodward v. Capital Regional District et al. (2005) BCPC: Victoria Registry&lt;/ref&gt;

In Alberta, section 555(1) of the Municipal Government Act states that “A person who is appointed as a bylaw enforcement officer is, in the execution of enforcement duties, responsible for the preservation and maintenance of the public peace”.

Section 15(2) of Ontario's Police Services Act R.S.O. 1990, states "Municipal law enforcement officers are peace officers for the purpose of enforcing municipal by-laws."&lt;ref&gt;R.S.O. 1990, c. P.15, s. 15 (2); 1997, c. 8, s. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar sections exist in most Provincial Police Acts.

For bylaw officers, this is generally good news, as it means that those persons who may be employed as bylaw officers without having been sworn under provincial acts are nonetheless protected under the Criminal Code definition of Peace Officer. This has somewhat convoluted the process of legally appointing bylaw officers. In British Columbia, for example, a person may be appointed as a Bylaw Officer through the ''Community Charter,''&lt;ref&gt;Sec. 264, Community Charter Act of BC http://www.qp.gov.bc.ca/statreg/stat/c/03026_08.htm#part8_division3&lt;/ref&gt; which sets out different powers &amp; responsibilities the Province of BC delegates to municipalities. However, the Provincial ''Police Act,'' which sets out various rules pertaining to police structure and administration in BC, also provides a mechanism for appointing bylaw officers.&lt;ref&gt;BC Police Act, Section 70: http://www.qp.gov.bc.ca/police/ec36700.htm#70&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a criminal offense for a person to fail to identify themselves to a bylaw officer in lawful execution of his or her duty (Obstructing a Peace Officer, sec 129 CCC), and a person could be charged with the greater charge of Assaulting a Peace Officer if assault were to occur.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Turko; Woodward v. Capital Regional District&lt;/ref&gt; As well, instances of someone obstructing a bylaw officer and being charged with Obstruction of a Peace Officer, as well as many cases of Assault of a Peace Officer, have been tested in the courts, as shown in ''Turko'' and ''Jones &amp; Hubert.'' However, how far the Peace Officer status extends to bylaw officers in other contexts is unclear, and will likely be challenged in the future. Some municipalities now use bylaw officers to stop and inspect commercial vehicles&lt;ref&gt;http://wvpd.ca/breaking-stories/215-commercial-vehicle-campaign&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Survey of Bylaw Officer duties http://liboa.homestead.com/Articles/2008_Province_of_British_Columbia.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and even for non-criminal enforcement of marijuana grow operations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.canada.com/vancouversun/news/story.html?id=9b375d7f-a59d-4895-a120-2c15a55ba389&amp;k=40296&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://vancouversun.com/news/Surrey+sees+drop+number+growing+operations+since+study/1700673/story.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://vancouversun.com/news/Surrey+records+huge+drop+marijuana+growing+operations+study/1698991/story.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.canada.com/victoriatimescolonist/story.html?id=ef31c08e-6eda-4519-9a7a-03b54fb7eb7d# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-07-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106190853/http://www.canada.com/victoriatimescolonist/story.html?id=ef31c08e-6eda-4519-9a7a-03b54fb7eb7d# |archive-date=2012-11-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arkinstall v.

It is also unclear to what extent peace officer status applies to non-proprietary (contract) employees, such as those employed by a security company on contract to a municipality.

==Development of the field==
[[Image:Torontoparkingenforcement.jpg|thumb|left|Example of a bylaw officer employed to do stratified enforcement as a Parking Enforcement Officer in Toronto, ON, Canada]]
Municipalities are under ever-increasing pressure to provide services quickly and cheaply, and many city governments see bylaw officers as attractive cheap alternatives to police for enforcement of non-criminal or less serious issues. As well, police departments themselves are under increased pressures in everything from staffing and finances, to the requirement to conduct police work within an increasingly complex legal framework brought about by increased litigiousness in society and more onerous limits &amp; guidelines imposed on the police in order to protect individual rights and freedoms. As such, police departments are frequently unable or unwilling to perform duties related to the enforcement of non-criminal statutes or municipal bylaws.

Many cities are finding themselves in situations where the police have stopped performing certain duties which they performed in the past. Failure to regulate certain activities in their municipality then creates problems and generates complaints and public frustration. This commonly results in the relegation of this task to bylaw officers.

Because the field developed in such an unusual way, essentially to accommodate changes and professionalization of policing, municipal employees of this class began taking on tasks historically performed by police officers, but without any policing powers or protections under the law. Meter Maids initially serviced parking meters, which had been a fairly new phenomenon in North American cities of the 1950s. Eventually, as traffic police officers only rarely enforced parking meter regulation, the cities required Meter Maids to write parking tickets. By the 1970s, most large municipalities had Meter Maids, who, through the course of the 1980s &amp; the 90's, transformed into Parking Enforcement Officers and were asked to enforce many more regulations than just those pertaining to meters. In recent history, Parking Enforcement Officers are increasingly taking on other duties, and municipalities (for the reasons mentioned above) are amalgamating specialized enforcement into general duty bylaw enforcement.

Because changes of this sort were unplanned, employees performing various classes of bylaw enforcement (parking, animal control, inspection work) frequently performed a duty of an officer of the law or as a person of authority. Since most bylaw officers were not sworn peace officers (and many are still not), the limits of their authority and exact definition of their powers have occasionally faced challenges.

Many provincial and state laws are being changed to help clarify status of non-constabulary bylaw officers. In British Columbia, when the new enabling charter was amended, (called 'Community Charter'), sections specifically referring to bylaw officers were included, including the power of bylaw officers to enter upon private property and investigate without warrant, something police are unable to do. The rationale behind such provisions (approved by the courts) is that bylaw matters are of significant importance to the public welfare (such as verifying that a building was properly constructed or that garbage is not illegally disposed of), yet violations carry only summary convictions (fines, or in most extreme cases, very very small jail terms if the issue is extremely serious and the person does not pay the fine) and are not as serious and deprecatory to a person's reputation and well-being as criminal offences. As such, the courts have determined that such powers are not unreasonable limitations on a person's Charter right of not being subject to "summary searches."

Many provinces have also standardized training for bylaw enforcement officers. The Alberta Municipal Government Act has no requirements for training of Bylaw Officers in Alberta. But formal training is available through the Alberta Municipal Enforcement Association and other organizations. If the person is also appointed as a Community Peace Officer then they are required to go through a 6-week training program at the Alberta Staff College or complete training that has been approved by the Solicitor General’s Office depending on what Provincial Acts are being enforced.  The Justice Institute of British Columbia and other private training companies offer specialized courses to those wishing to attain certification in the field in British Columbia.

Sometimes, the enforcement of particular bylaws may be conducted on contract by a private company. Such companies are either highly specialized in a single area of bylaw enforcement (such as animal control in the case of the SPCA), or provide security guards, who are then specially trained to handle specific tasks, usually limited to traffic or parking enforcement. The most recent trend is to recall many of the services previously contracted out and put systems in place to conduct such services in-house. As such, contracting-out is not a great concern in this field.

==Today's bylaw officers==
All of the changes mentioned above have created a class of employees, who previously just handled one task or assignment, such as animal control, who are now engaged in a variety of quasi-police activities, especially enforcement roles that for lack of staffing are not handled by police officers.  Although some work conducted by bylaw enforcement officers can be very minor in gravity, such as issuing tickets for expired meters, the investigation and enforcement duties conducted by bylaw officers are extremely important and necessary for the well-being of society. Dog attacks, for example, can be very serious events, where people or other animals can be gravely hurt. In most jurisdictions with bylaw officers, investigation work concerning dog attacks is conducted solely by the bylaw officers, without any police involvement. Such work can prevent future attacks, protect society from harm and/or cause an animal to be euthanized and its owners to face severe fines.  Bylaw Enforcement Officers care for and protect animals, help mediate neighbourhood disputes, assure public safety by investigating illegal garbage/waste dumping and enforce regulations, the absence of which can severely impact a person's well-being, such as late-night noise from frequent parties that prevents a neighbourhood from sleeping.  Bylaw enforcement officers are the first line of defense against a physical degradation of a neighbourhood or area, which can start with a broken window, lead to unsightly premises, and soon be littered with garbage, illegal signs, uninsured vehicles and lower real estate values. Bylaw enforcement is instrumental in preserving well-functioning neighbourhoods and fixing problematic ones.

In the United States, and even in some places in Canada, municipal enforcement personnel can be found in  police and municipal departments providing security to prisoners, guarding court houses, investigating dog fighting or writing parking tickets. This has led to increased police training, and in the United States, arming of these officials. The New York branch of the [[American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]] (ASPCA) employs several animal "cops" who are armed and have policing powers. This arrangement is becoming more common throughout the United States, particularly in larger cities where civilian enforcement personnel have difficulty conducting investigations due to a lack of cooperation from suspects. In Canada, many jurisdictions are training their bylaw personnel in self-defense and control tactics, and issuing equipment such as tactical batons and OC spray. Such changes have also made a career in municipal enforcement more dangerous, requiring more skills and training, and accordingly offering greater compensation. [[Security clearance]]s have also become the standard requirement, and as such, the process of becoming employed in one of these positions has become more time consuming. This has also made a career in bylaw enforcement more desirable than ever. The [https://web.archive.org/web/20110225155611/http://www.jibc.ca/programs-courses/schools-departments/school-community-social-justice/centre-counselling-community-safety/programs/bylaw-enforcement-investigative-skills Justice Institute of British Columbia] Bylaw Compliance, Enforcement and Investigative Skills Certificate Program is designed to develop the skills, knowledge and abilities required to work successfully in bylaw enforcement in British Columbia. Levels 1 and 2 of this certificate have been endorsed by the Licence Inspectors and Bylaw Officers Association of British Columbia.However, this field is growing quickly as municipalities seek to streamline costs and save on policing expenses; as well, many incumbents in the field are older, and due to relatively good municipal pension options, early retirements are possible and therefore prospects for employment in this area are good. Current standards for employment of uniformed bylaw enforcement officers are usually not codified state or province-wide, as flexibility is necessary, but usually include the precondition that candidates have a fairly clean driving record and an ability to pass a criminal records check. As the use of bylaw officers for more complex tasks increases, it is to be expected that standards for the profession will likely become regulated or imposed from a state/provincial governmental body.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2155">The '''Canadian Association of Elizabeth Fry Societies''' ('''CAEFS''') is an association of groups operating under the Elizabeth Fry Society banner, similar in many respects to the [[John Howard Society]]. The Elizabeth Fry Society groups work on issues affecting women and girls in the justice system. The societies take their name from [[prison reform]]er [[Elizabeth Fry]].

The organization was started in 1969, with formal incorporation as a [[non-profit organization]] occurring in 1978. They help female offenders to re-integrate into society. They work independently from the government.

The original Elizabeth Fry Society of Canada was founded in 1939 by Member of Parliament [[Agnes Macphail]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://canadaonline.about.com/cs/womengov/p/agnesmacphail.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.cbc.ca/IDC-1-73-1994-12753-10/politics_economy/twt/]&lt;/ref&gt;

The current Executive Director of CAEFS is [[Kassandra Churcher]].

The Elizabeth Fry Society has also taken an active approach to criminal cases involving females.  They have had intervenor status in a number of [[Supreme Court of Canada]] cases including [[R v Ryan]],&lt;ref&gt;http://scc.lexum.org/decisia-scc-csc/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/12807/index.do&lt;/ref&gt; in which [[Nicole Patricia Ryan]] was arrested by the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] after attempting to hire an undercover officer as a [[hitman]] to kill her husband.  The RCMP were criticized by the Supreme Court for failing to protect Ryan from an abusive husband, however both the husband and the RCMP refute the reported abuse. The husband was not called to testify during the trial.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/story/2013/01/23/ns-hitman-michael-ryan.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/story/2013/02/01/ns-nicole-ryan-doucet-rcmp-deny-report-abuse.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Colored dissolved organic matter''' (CDOM) is the optically measurable component of dissolved [[organic matter]] in water. Also known as ''[[chromophoric]]'' dissolved organic matter,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hoge |first1=FE |last2= Vodacek  |first2=A  |last3=Swift  |first3=RN |last4=Yungel |first4=JK |last5=Blough |first5=NV|date=October 1995 |title=Inherent optical properties of the ocean: retrieval of the absorption coefficient of chromophoric dissolved organic matter from airborne laser spectral fluorescence measurements. |journal=Applied Optics  |pmid=21060564|publisher= |volume=34 |issue=30 |pages=7032–8 |doi=10.1364/ao.34.007032|bibcode=1995ApOpt..34.7032H}},&lt;/ref&gt; ''yellow substance'', and ''gelbstoff'', CDOM occurs naturally in aquatic environments and is a complex mixture of many hundreds to thousands of individual, unique [[organic matter]] molecules, which are primarily leached from decaying [[detritus]] and organic matter&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Coble|first=Paula|date=2007|title=Marine Optical Biogeochemistry: The Chemistry of Ocean Color|url=https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/cr050350%2B?journalCode=chreay|journal=Chemical Reviews|volume=107|pages=402-418|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. CDOM most strongly absorbs short wavelength light ranging from blue to [[ultraviolet]], whereas pure water absorbs longer wavelength red light. Therefore, water with little or no CDOM, such as the open ocean, appears blue&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://science.nasa.gov/earth-science/oceanography/living-ocean/ocean-color|title=Ocean Color|last=|first=|date=|website=NASA Science|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=26 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Waters containing high amounts of CDOM can range from brown, as in many rivers, to yellow and yellow-brown in coastal waters. In general, CDOM concentrations are much higher in fresh waters and estuaries than in the open ocean, though concentrations are highly variable.

== Significance ==
[[File:Sediment off the Carolinas on October 9, 2016.jpg|thumb|Variations in the concentration of colored dissolved organic matter can even be seen from space. The dark brown water in the inland waterways contains high concentrations of CDOM. As this dark, CDOM-rich water moves offshore, it mixes with the low CDOM, blue ocean water from offshore.]]
The concentration of CDOM can have a significant effect on biological activity in aquatic systems. CDOM diminishes light intensity as it penetrates water. Very high concentrations of CDOM can have a limiting effect on [[photosynthesis]] and inhibit the growth of [[phytoplankton]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stedmon|first=C.A.|last2=Markager|first2=S.|last3=Kaas|first3=H.|date=2000|title=Optical properties and signatures of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in Danish coastal waters|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272771400906450|journal=Estuarine, Coastal, and Shelf Science|volume=51|pages=267-278|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which form the basis of oceanic [[food chains]] and are a primary source of atmospheric [[oxygen]]. CDOM also absorbs harmful UVA/B radiation, protecting organisms from DNA damage.

Absorption of UV radiation causes CDOM to "bleach", reducing its optical density and absorptive capacity. This bleaching (photodegradation) of CDOM produces low-molecular-weight organic compounds which may be utilized by microbes, release nutrients that may be used by phytoplankton as a nutrient source for growth&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Helms|first=John R.|last2=Stubbins|first2=Aaron|last3=Perdue|first3=E. Micheal|last4=Green|first4=Nelson W.|last5=Chen|first5=Hongmei|last6=Mopper|first6=Kenneth|date=2013|title=Photochemical bleaching of oceanic dissolved organic matter and its effect on absorption spectral slope and fluorescence|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304420313001217|journal=Marine Chemistry|volume=155|pages=81-91|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and generates reactive oxygen species, which may damage tissues and alter the bioavailability of limiting trace metals.

CDOM can be detected and measured from space using satellite [[remote sensing]] and often interferes with the use of satellite [[spectrometer]]s to remotely estimate phytoplankton populations. As a pigment necessary for photosynthesis, [[chlorophyll]] is a key indicator of the phytoplankton abundance. However, CDOM and chlorophyll both absorb light in the same spectral range so it is often difficult to differentiate between the two.

Although variations in CDOM are primarily the result of natural processes including changes in the amount and frequency of precipitation, human activities such as logging, agriculture, effluent discharge, and wetland drainage can affect CDOM levels in fresh water and estuarine systems.

[[Image:Map of USA Commonwealths.svg|thumb|270px|The four [[U.S. state]]s (red) that refer to themselves with the term "Commonwealth".]]

'''Commonwealth''' is a [[Terminology|designation]] used by four of the 50 [[U.S. state|states]] of the United States in their full official state names: [[Kentucky]],&lt;ref&gt;Third Constitution of Kentucky (1850), Article 2, Section 1 ''ff.''  Other portions of the same Constitution refer to the "State of Kentucky".&lt;/ref&gt; [[Massachusetts]],&lt;ref name="Constitution of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://malegislature.gov/Laws/Constitution#cp00s00.htm | title=Constitution of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts | publisher=[[Massachusetts General Court]] | work=Preamble of the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts | accessdate=27 October 2016}},&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pennsylvania]],&lt;ref&gt;Constitution of Pennsylvania, Preamble,&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;The Hornbook of Virginia History, 4th ed., page 88.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Commonwealth]] is a traditional English term for a political community founded for the [[common good]]. Prior to the formation of the United States of America in 1776, all four were part of [[British America|Great Britain's possessions]] along the Atlantic coast of North America. As such, they share a strong influence of English [[common law]] in some of their laws and institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Reinsch. English Common Law in the Early American colonies. Ph.D. thesis. Un. of Wisconsin. 1898.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William E. Nelson. The Common Law in Colonial America. Vol. I. Oxford University Press. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
{{Administrative divisions of the United States}}
The term ''[[commonwealth]]'' does not describe or provide for any specific political status or legal relationship when used by a state.&lt;ref name=ACQUISITION&gt;{{cite web| url = https://fam.state.gov/FAM/07FAM/07FAM1120.html#M1121_2_1| title = 7 fam 1120 Acquisition of U.S. Nationality in U.S. Territories and Possessions| accessdate = December 13, 2015| date = January 3, 2013| work = U.S. Department of State Foreign Affairs Manual Volume 7- Consular Affairs| publisher = U.S. Department of State|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those that do use it are [[equal footing|equal]] to those that do not. A traditional English term for a political community founded for the [[common good]], it is used symbolically to emphasize that these states have a "government based on the common consent of the people"&lt;ref&gt;''See'' "Commonwealth", ''The Columbia Encyclopedia'', Sixth Edition, 2001–07.&lt;/ref&gt; as opposed to one legitimized through their earlier [[Crown colony|colonial status]] that was derived from the [[British crown]]. It refers to the common "wealth", or welfare, of the public&lt;ref&gt;''The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language'', Fourth Edition, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; and is derived from a loose translation of the Latin term ''[[res publica]]''.{{efn|''[[cf.]]'' the 17th-century [[Commonwealth of England]].}}

[[Criminal law|Criminal]] charges in these four states are brought in the name of the Commonwealth.{{efn|Note that In California, Colorado, Illinois, Michigan, and New York, criminal charges are brought in the name of the People. In all the other states, they are brought in the name of the State. Regardless of state, [[Federal judiciary of the United States|federal]] criminal charges are always brought in the name of the [[United States of America]].}}

Besides the four aforementioned states, other states have also on occasion used the term ''commonwealth'' to refer to themselves:
*The term ''commonwealth'' is used interchangeably with the term ''[[State (polity)|state]]'' in the [[Constitution of Vermont]].&lt;ref&gt;The [http://www.leg.state.vt.us/statutes/const2.htm Constitution of the State of Vermont], Chapter II, §§ 1, 8, and 71.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*[[Delaware]] was primarily referred to as a "state" in its [[Delaware Constitution of 1776|1776 Constitution]]; however, the term ''commonwealth'' was also used in one of its articles.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Constitution of Delaware (1776)|Constitution of Delaware (1776)]], Art. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two [[Territories of the United States|U.S. territories]] are also designated as [[Commonwealth (U.S. insular area)|commonwealths]]: [[Puerto Rico]] and the [[Northern Mariana Islands]]. When used in connection with areas under U.S. sovereignty that are not states, the term broadly describes an area that is self-governing under a constitution of its own adoption and whose right of self-government will not be unilaterally withdrawn by the [[United States Congress]].&lt;ref name=ACQUISITION/&gt;

==States==
===Kentucky===
On September 28, 1786, the residents of [[Kentucky County]] began petitioning the Virginia legislature for permission to become a "free and independent state, to be known by the name of the ''Commonwealth'' of Kentucky".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Warren|first=Joseph Parker|date=Oct 1905|title=The Confederation and the Shays Rebellion|jstor=1832364|journal=The American Historical Review|volume=11|pages=42–67}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 1, 1792, Kentucky County officially became a state. As in Virginia, the official title of the elected local prosecutor in each of Kentucky's political subdivisions is the Commonwealth's Attorney, as opposed to State's Attorney in other States or the more standard District Attorney. Kentucky is the only state outside of the original [[Thirteen Colonies]] that uses commonwealth in its name.

===Massachusetts===
Massachusetts is officially named ''The Commonwealth of Massachusetts'' by its [[Constitution of Massachusetts|constitution]]. The name ''State of Massachusetts Bay'' was used in all acts and resolves up to 1780 and in the first draft of the constitution. The current name can be traced to the second draft of the state constitution, which was written by [[John Adams]] and ratified in 1780.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040727080643/http://www.sec.state.ma.us/cis/cismaf/mf1a.htm|title=CIS: State Symbols|date=27 July 2004|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Massachusetts, the term ''State'' is occasionally used in an official manner, usually in a [[Compound (linguistics)|compound structure]] rather than as a standalone noun. This is evident in the names of the [[Massachusetts State Police]], the [[Massachusetts State House]], and the [[Bridgewater State Hospital]].

===Pennsylvania===
The [[Seal of Pennsylvania]] does not use the term, but legal processes are in the name of the Commonwealth, and it is a traditional official designation used in referring to the state. In 1776, Pennsylvania's first state constitution referred to it as both ''Commonwealth'' and ''State'', a pattern of usage that was perpetuated in the constitutions of 1790, 1838, 1874, and 1958.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phmc.state.pa.us/bah/pahist/symbols.asp?secid=31 PHMC: Pennsylvania History] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060403052349/http://www.phmc.state.pa.us/bah/pahist/symbols.asp?secid=31 |date=April 3, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|A detailed history describing the origins of Pennsylvania's government, including its designation as a commonwealth from colonial times, is available from the Secretary of the Commonwealth's office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/gateway/PTARGS_0_2_486669_0_0_18/history_of_dos_rendell_admin.pdf |title=History of DOS |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} One of Pennsylvania's two intermediate [[appellate court]]s is called the [[Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania|Commonwealth Court]].

===Virginia===
The name ''Commonwealth of Virginia'' dates back to its independence from the Kingdom of Great Britain. Virginia's first [[Constitution of Virginia|constitution]] (adopted on June 29, 1776) directed that "Commissions and Grants shall run, In the Name of the commonwealth of Virginia, and bear test by the Governor with the Seal of the Commonwealth annexed." The [[Secretary of the Commonwealth of Virginia|Secretary of the Commonwealth]] still issues commissions in this manner.

Among other references, the constitution furthermore dictated that criminal indictments were to conclude "against the peace and dignity of the Commonwealth". Additionally, the official title of the elected local [[prosecutor]] in each of Virginia's political subdivisions is the [[Commonwealth's Attorney]], as opposed to [[State's Attorney]] in other States or the more standard [[District Attorney]].

In Virginia, the term ''state'' is sometimes used in an official manner, usually in a [[Compound (linguistics)|compound structure]] rather than as a standalone noun. This is evident in the names of the [[Virginia State Corporation Commission]], the [[Virginia State Police]], and the [[Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University]]. The state university in [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] is known as [[Virginia Commonwealth University]]; there is also a [[Virginia State University]], located in [[Ettrick, Virginia|Ettrick]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11330">'''Cultural dissonance''' (education, [[sociology]], [[anthropology]] and cultural studies) is an  uncomfortable sense of discord, disharmony, confusion, or conflict experienced by people in the midst of change in their cultural environment. The changes are often unexpected, unexplained or not understandable due to various types of cultural dynamics.&lt;ref name="adt.curtin.edu.au"&gt;[http://adt.curtin.edu.au/theses/available/adt-WCU20020610.140633/  English speaking migrant children in educational and cultural transition.] Curtin University of Technology. (Thesis)&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies into cultural dissonance take on a wide socio-cultural scope of analysis that inquire into [[economics]], [[politics]], [[values]], [[learning styles]], cultural factors, such as [[language]], [[tradition]], [[ethnicity]], [[cultural heritage]], cultural [[history]], educational formats, classroom design, and even socio-cultural issues such as [[ethnocentricism]], [[racism]] and their respective historical legacies in the cultures.

==Research==
Research topics in cultural dissonance tend to be [[interdisciplinary]] drawing from a wide range of disciplines and applying the findings to equally diverse fields and industries.

Edward J. Hedican wrote an article in the Department of Sociology &amp; Anthropology at the [[University of Guelph]], [[Ontario]]. In it he  noted the possibility of alleviating acculturative pressures, and their disruptive effects on the sense of aboriginal sense of worth and identity. He proposed, "...the development of interethnic communication or ethnopolitics of community competence. This, in turn, will lead to increased native control over educational, economic, &amp; political institutions, decreased cultural dissonance, &amp; a more positive native identity." (Hedican)

Paul Bohannan wrote an "anthropological treatise" outlining "Seven organizing principles unique to humans: contract, role, ranking property, markets, networks, &amp; public relations. These characteristics are built on to analyze dyads, triads, &amp; chains, to show how innovation, as well as how cultural dissonance can lead to cultural traps." (Bohannan)

=== Education ===
Winifred L. Macdonald concluded in her thesis that, "... shared markers of language and ethnicity were not sufficient to ensure that the cultural differences in education systems were not experienced by the families." 
Macdonald also observed that cultural dissonance is sometimes said to inhibit socio-cultural adaptation.&lt;ref name="adt.curtin.edu.au"/&gt;

Susan Black, an education research consultant, wrote an article in the ''[[American School Board Journal]]'' of the [[National School Board Association]] that summarized some of the actions recommended by some researchers in education-related cultural dissonance. The recommendations for educators included:
# Recognize [[ethnocentrism]]
# Know and understand the student's [[cultural heritage]]
# Understand social, economic and political issues and [[value (ethics)|values]] in different cultures
# Adopt the attitude that students—all students—can [[learn]]
# Create genuinely caring classrooms where all students are appreciated and accepted.

Other general findings include: 
*Geneva Gay (University of Washington in Seattle, Washington), proposed that differences can erupt into cultural clashes
*Researchers at the Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory notes that many anecdotal case studies show how culturally responsive practices improve students' behavior and achievement.&lt;ref&gt;Black, Susan. American School Board Journal; Jan 2006, Vol. 193 Issue 1, p34-36, 3p&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Second-generation immigrants ===
In their book ''Children of Immigration'', Carola and Marcelo Suárez-Orozco discuss dissonance as it relates to [[Latino]]s in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Carola and Marcelo Suárez-Orozco, [http://www.hepg.org/her/booknote/112 "Children of Immigration"], Harvard University Press, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Suarez Orozco found that second-generation [[Hispanics]] face more acute forms of cultural dissonance than their first generation parents. They also noticed that second-generation individuals also face "special difficulties" that lead to "three general patterns of adjustment"
# attempts to [[:wikt:synthesize|synthesize]] two cultural traditions
# [[Passing (sociology)|passing]] as a member of the dominant group
# developing of defensive identity such as [[gang]] membership

=== Refugees of war ===
Suárez-Orozco also compared the experience of exiles from [[Cuba]] being reunited with family members with the "...alienated refugees from war-torn Central America..." as they worked through their own adjustment issues, and concluded that Central Americans had to deal with more cultural dissonance than their Cuban counterparts.

=== Law enforcement ===
Larry A. Gould wrote a paper for [[Northern Arizona University]]
"his research reports on the link between feelings of spirituality &amp; how Navajo police officers tend to enforce European-based law. Previous research suggests that a link exists between the officers' depth of feeling of spirituality &amp; the officers' attitude toward the effectiveness traditional methods of social control; however, this research goes a step further &amp; examines the impact of cultural dissonance on the stressors faced by Navajo police officers. The enforcement behavior of the Navajo officers was used as a proxy for the intensity of their feelings concerning the usefulness of traditional vs European-based forces of social control; the underlying assumption being tested is that self-determination is not only a state of law but a state of psychological being. A snowball method of sample development was used to select officers for intensive interviews. The findings suggest that the officers' feeling of spiritual connectedness to his/her culture is inversely related to the strictness of the enforcement of European-based laws. In other words, the more spiritual the officer, the less likely the officer is to rely solely on European-based laws, &amp; the greater the reliance on other methods of problems solving. The finding also suggest that in addition to the stressors normally encounter by all police officers, Navajo officers faced additional stressors that are specific to indigenous officers policing in indigenous communities. 1 Table, 41 References. Adapted from the source document." (Gould)

=== In sports ===
Tracy Taylor wrote a paper for the ''[[Journal of Sport and Social Issues]]''. In it she wrote "...This research investigates issues of cultural diversity &amp; inclusiveness in women's netball in Australia using the rhetoric of exclusion. Women &amp; girls from culturally diverse backgrounds spoke of reinforced difference &amp; cultural assimilation in their netball experiences. Women born in other English-speaking countries recalled feelings of inclusion &amp; limited cultural dissonance &amp; indicated that netball helped them feel as part of their new community &amp; gain social capital via participation. Although experiences of explicit exclusion or racial discrimination were virtually nonreported, some women felt a strong sense of cultural conformity to Anglo-centric expectations of behavior. The women's stories &amp; experiences suggest that women from culturally diverse backgrounds have found few opportunities to express their cultural distinctiveness through mainstream Australian sports such as netball. The conclusion reached after this examination is that the rhetoric of exclusion is pervasive in Australian netball &amp; unlikely to change in the near future. 1 Table, 76 References. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright 2004.]" (Taylor)

==Cultural dissonance in popular culture==
Side 2 of the [[Firesign Theatre]]'s 1968 album, ''[[Waiting for the Electrician or Someone Like Him]]'', features a humorous 18-minute radio drama of a traveler experiencing cultural dissonance on his arrival in a foreign country. For example, the traveler struggles to communicate his wish to send a telegram, only to be informed that yes, his telegram has been sent, at considerable cost, and that he will be receiving it in about an hour.

{{Politics of Germany}}

The '''Danish Party''' ({{lang-de|Dänische Partei}}) was a [[political party]] in the [[German Empire]].

==History==
The party was established in 1871 to represent the 50,000-strong Danish population of [[South Jutland County|North Schleswig]], who remained opposed to their separation from Denmark following the [[Second Schleswig War]] in 1864.&lt;ref name=VM&gt;Vincent E McHale (1983) ''Political parties of Europe'', Greenwood Press, p415 {{ISBN|0-313-23804-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It won a seat in every [[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]] elected between [[German federal election, 1871|1871]] and [[German federal election, 1912|1912]]. Its best performance was in the [[German federal election, 1881|1881 elections]], the only occasion on which it won two seats.&lt;ref name=VM/&gt;

The party disappeared after [[World War I]],&lt;ref name=VM/&gt; following the [[Schleswig Plebiscites]] and the return of Northern Schleswig to Denmark.

The '''Donor's Bill of Rights''' was created by the [[Association of Fundraising Professionals]], the Association for Healthcare Philanthropy (AHP), the [[Council for Advancement and Support of Education]], and the Giving Institute: Leading Consultants to [[Nonprofit|Non-Profits]]. It has been endorsed by numerous organizations in the United States.

== The Donor Bill of Rights ==
[[Philanthropy]] is based on voluntary action for the [[common good]]. It is a tradition of giving and sharing that is primary to the quality of life. To ensure that philanthropy merits the respect and trust of the general public, and that donors and prospective donors can have full confidence in the nonprofit organizations and causes they are asked to support, we declare that all donors have these rights:

# To be informed of the organization's [[Mission statement|mission]], of the way the organization intends to use donated resources, and of its capacity to use [[donations]] effectively for their intended purposes.
# To be informed of the identity of those serving on the organization's governing board, and to expect the board to exercise prudent judgment in its stewardship responsibilities.
# To have access to the organization's most recent financial statements.
# To be assured their gifts will be used for the purposes for which they were given.
# To receive appropriate acknowledgement and recognition.
# To be assured that information about their donation is handled with respect and with confidentiality to the extent provided by law.
# To expect that all relationships with individuals representing organizations of interest to the donor will be professional in nature.
# To be informed whether those seeking donations are [[volunteering|volunteers]], employees of the organization or hired solicitors.
# To have the opportunity for their names to be deleted from mailing lists that an organization may intend to share.
# To feel free to ask questions when making a donation and to receive prompt, truthful and forthright answers.

{{Capitalism|Ideologies}}
'''Economic liberalism''' is an [[economic system]] organized on individual lines, which means the greatest possible number of [[Economy|economic]] decisions are made by [[Individualism|individuals]] or [[household]]s rather than by [[collective]] [[institution]]s or [[organization]]s.{{sfn|Adams|2001|p=20}} It includes a spectrum of different economic policies, such as [[freedom of movement]], but its basis is on strong support for a [[market economy]] and [[private property]] in the [[means of production]]. Although economic liberals can also be supportive of [[government regulation]] to a certain degree, they tend to oppose [[government intervention]] in the [[free market]] when it inhibits [[free trade]] and [[Competition (economics)|open competition]].

Economic liberalism is associated with free markets and private ownership of [[capital asset]]s. Historically, economic liberalism arose in response to [[mercantilism]] and [[feudalism]]. Today, economic liberalism is also considered opposed to non-capitalist economic orders, such as [[socialism]] and [[Planned economy|planned economies]].&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Wendy. ''Edgework: Critical Essays on Knowledge And Politics''. Princeton University Press. 2005. p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; It also contrasts with [[protectionism]] because of its support for free trade and [[Open economy|open markets]].

An economy that is managed according to these precepts may be described as a [[liberal economy]].

== Origins ==
[[File:AdamSmith.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Adam Smith]] was an early advocate for economic liberalism]]
Arguments in favor of economic liberalism were advanced during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], opposing mercantilism and feudalism. It was first analyzed by [[Adam Smith]] in ''[[An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations]]'', which advocated minimal interference of government in a market economy, though it did not necessarily oppose the state's provision of basic [[public good]]s with what constitutes public goods originally being seen as very limited in scope.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Aaron. ''What's Right?''. Dural, Australia. Rosenberg Publishing. 2003. p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; Smith claimed that if everyone is left to his own economic devices instead of being controlled by the state, then the result would be a harmonious and more equal society of ever-increasing prosperity.{{sfn|Adams|2001|p=20}} This underpinned the move towards a [[Capitalism|capitalist]] economic system in the late 18th century and the subsequent demise of the mercantilist system.

Private property and individual [[contract]]s form the basis of economic liberalism. The early theory was based on the assumption that the economic actions of individuals are largely based on self-interest ([[invisible hand]]) and that allowing them to act without any restrictions will produce the best results for everyone ([[spontaneous order]]), provided that at least minimum standards of public information and justice exist, e.g. no one should be allowed to coerce, steal, or commit fraud and there is freedom of speech and press.

Initially, the economic liberals had to contend with the supporters of feudal privileges for the wealthy, [[Aristocracy|aristocratic]] traditions and the rights of [[Monarch|kings]] to run national economies in their own personal interests. By the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th, these were largely defeated.

Today, economic liberalism is associated with [[classical liberalism]], [[neoliberalism]], [[Propertarianism|propertarian]] [[libertarianism]] and some schools of [[conservatism]].

=== Position on state interventionism ===
Economic liberalism opposes government intervention on the grounds that the state often serves dominant business interests, distorting the market to their favor and thus leading to inefficient outcomes.{{cn|date=May 2017}} [[Ordoliberalism]] and various schools of [[social liberalism]] based on classical liberalism include a broader role for the state, but do not seek to replace private enterprise and the free market with public enterprise and economic planning.{{sfn|Turner|2008|pp=83–84}}{{sfn|Balaam|Dillman|2015|p=48}} For example, a [[social market economy]] is a largely free market economy based on a [[free price system]] and private property, but is supportive of government activity to promote competitive markets and [[Social welfare|social welfare programs]] to address social inequalities that result from free market outcomes.{{sfn|Turner|2008|pp=83–84}}{{sfn|Balaam|Dillman|2015|p=48}} 

&lt;!-- Historian [[Kathleen G. Donohue]]
WHO IS SHE? Is she notable?
argues that classical liberalism in the United States during the 19th century had distinctive characteristics as opposed to Britain: {{Quote|[A]t the center of classical liberal theory [in Europe] was the idea of ''laissez-faire''. To the vast majority of American classical liberals, however, ''laissez-faire'' did not mean no government intervention at all. On the contrary, they were more than willing to see government provide tariffs, railroad subsidies, and internal improvements, all of which benefited producers. What they condemned was intervention in behalf of consumers}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kathleen G.

'''Edward Maurice Mezvinsky''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ɛ|z|ˈ|v|ɪ|n|s|k|i}}; born January 17, 1937) is a former U.S. Representative and a felon. A [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], he represented [[Iowa's 1st congressional district]] in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] for two terms (1973–77).

Mezvinsky grew up in [[Ames, Iowa]], and played high school football there. He received his [[law degree]] from the [[University of California, Hastings College of the Law]] (1965). After being elected to the Iowa Legislature (1968), he lost a race for Congress in 1970, then won in 1972 and was re-elected in 1974. He made several unsuccessful [[U.S. Senate]] attempts in the 1980s. In 2001, he was convicted of 31 charges of felony fraud, and served five years in federal prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Iowa ex-congressman to leave prison|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=CR&amp;z=CRGB&amp;p_theme=cr&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=11FFD75B65D2FBC0&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM|work=The Gazette|date=April 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, he became father-in-law to [[Chelsea Clinton]], the daughter of [[Hillary Clinton|Hillary]] and [[Bill Clinton]].

==Life and career==
Mezvinsky grew up in [[Ames, Iowa]], the son of Jewish grocery store owner Abe Mezvinsky. His father was born in [[Russia]] and his mother in [[Poland]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{citation |url= https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:KMBT-LXQ |title= United States Census, 1940 |website= [[FamilySearch]] |accessdate=March 20, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was an all-state football end and member of the [[Ames High School]] state championship basketball and track teams of 1955.&lt;ref name=dmr&gt;{{cite news|url=http://crab.rutgers.edu/~mchugh/nigeriamezvinsky.html|title=Whirlpool of lies swallows Mezvinsky|last=Kilen|first=Mike|date=August 3, 2003|publisher=Des Moines Register|accessdate=May 18, 2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mezvinsky attended the [[University of Iowa]], graduating in 1960. He went on to earn a masters in political science from the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1963, and a J.D. from the [[University of California, Hastings College of Law]] in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1975/10/06/archives/marjorie-margolies-of-nbc-wed-to-rep-edward-mezvinsky.html|title=Marjorie Margolies of NBC Wed to Rep. Edward Mezvinsky|date=October 6, 1975|publisher=|accessdate=February 14, 2018|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=M000686|title=MEZVINSKY, Edward Maurice - Biographical Information|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned briefly to Iowa to practice law, but quickly began a political career. In 1965, he worked for former Rep. [[Neal Edward Smith|Neal Smith]] in Washington on lobbyist disclosure and ethics bills. He was elected to the Iowa Legislature in 1968, where he attracted publicity as a consumers' advocate. He lost a 1970 campaign to unseat Republican Congressman [[Fred Schwengel]] in Iowa's 1st congressional district by only 765 votes (out of over 120,000 cast). After [[reapportionment]] improved his chances, Mezvinsky won a 1972 rematch.&lt;ref name=dmr/&gt;

During his first term in Congress, he sat on the [[House Judiciary Committee]] and voted for the [[impeachment]] of President [[Richard Nixon]] for his activities in the [[Watergate scandal]]. He was one of nine Democratic members of the committee who voted for all five articles of impeachment drafted against Nixon; three were reported to the House, while two failed. 

Although Mezvinsky defeated Davenport businessman [[Jim Leach]] in 1974 in the immediate aftermath of the impeachment hearings, Leach defeated him two years later, in 1976. Six months into his first term in Congress, Mezvinsky separated from his wife of ten years Myra Shulman; they were divorced two weeks after his 1974 re-election.&lt;ref&gt;Larry Eckholt, "Mezvinskys End Marriage", ''Des Moines Register'', November 20, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; During his final term he married [[Marjorie Margolies]], a television journalist.&lt;ref name=dmr/&gt; After his 1976 defeat, they relocated to suburban [[Philadelphia]]. After serving in Congress, Mezvinsky was [[United States Ambassador to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights]] from 1977-79.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=M000686|title=MEZVINSKY - Biographical Information|publisher=Bioguide.congress.gov|accessdate=November 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mezvinsky unsuccessfully sought the Democratic nomination for [[List of United States Senators from Pennsylvania|the United States Senate seat]] held by retiring incumbent Republican [[Richard Schweiker]] in [[United States Senate election in Pennsylvania, 1980|1980]], but lost to former [[Mayor of Pittsburgh|Pittsburgh Mayor]] [[Peter F. Flaherty|Pete Flaherty]]. Flaherty lost the general election by a wide margin to Republican, later Democrat [[Arlen Specter]], who went on to serve five terms in the Senate.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

He became chairman of the [[Pennsylvania Democratic Party]], and made a run for [[Pennsylvania Attorney General|state attorney general]] in 1988. He won the Democratic primary, but lost to Republican [[Ernie Preate]] in the general election. He also unsuccessfully sought the Democratic nomination for [[Lieutenant Governor of Pennsylvania|lieutenant governor]] in [[Pennsylvania gubernatorial election, 1990|1990]], losing to incumbent [[Mark Singel]].{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

==Family==
From 1993-95, Mezvinsky's wife [[Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky|Marjorie Margolies]] served a term in Congress. Together, they raised eleven children, three of whom were adopted. In 1998, she was the Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor of Pennsylvania. In 2000, she was running for the Democratic nomination for the U.S. Senate when her husband's business problems forced them to file for bankruptcy and forced her abrupt withdrawal.&lt;ref name=dmr/&gt; They divorced several years later.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politicsdaily.com/2009/12/02/meet-marc-mezvinsky-chelsea-clintons-fiance/ Meet Marc Mezvinsky, Chelsea Clinton's Fiancé], politicsdaily.com, December 2, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Friendship with the Clintons===
[[File:Marc Mezvinsky, Bill Clinton 2016 DNC Cof8Z5xVIAITfha.jpg|thumb|Mezvinsky's son Marc (left) is the son-in-law of Bill Clinton (right)]]
Mezvinsky and his wife Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky became close to [[U.S. President]] [[Bill Clinton]] and [[Hillary Clinton]] in the 1990s, both families met when they attended the annual Renaissance Weekend gathering in South Carolina. President Clinton was reportedly indebted to Margolies-Mezvinsky since she provided the crucial vote in the House of Representatives to pass his budget and tax bill, despite being "one of very few Democrats who represented a district with more constituents who'd get tax hikes than tax cuts, and in her campaign she'd promised not to vote for any tax increases", which cost her re-election in 1994. The Mezvinskys were frequent guests at White House state dinners during the Clinton administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=oss|first=Brian|title=Former Congressman Duped by Nigerian Scams|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2006/12/father_of_chels|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111101012610/http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2006/12/father_of_chels|archivedate=November 1, 2011|publisher=ABC News|date=December 8, 2006|accessdate=January 25, 2014}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Mezvinsky's son, [[Marc Mezvinsky]], married [[Chelsea Clinton]], daughter of Bill and Hillary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philly.com/inquirer/magazine/20100729_Seeing_the__quot_for_worse_quot__hasn_t_scared_Chelsea_from_the_altar.html Seeing the "for worse" hasn't scared Chelsea from the altar], Philly.com; accessed February 12, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criminal activities==
In March 2001, Mezvinsky was indicted and later pleaded guilty to 31 of 69 felony charges of [[bank fraud]], [[mail fraud]], and [[wire fraud]]. Mezvinsky, who had been working as an attorney at the time, was funneling embezzled and fraudulently obtained money to [[West Africa]]n con men after falling victim to an online [[advance-fee scam]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://money.cnn.com/magazines/moneymag/moneymag_archive/2002/07/01/324998/index.htm The Scam That Will Not Die], accessed May 14, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In the waning days of the [[Clinton presidency]], before the indictment was handed down, Mezvinsky's wife wrote personally to President Clinton requesting a [[Federal pardons in the United States|pardon]] for her husband. Clinton declined.&lt;ref name="pardon"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gerstein|first1=Josh|title=Clinton White House passed up pardon for Chelsea's father-in-law|url=https://www.politico.com/story/2016/02/clinton-bill-hillary-chelsea-mezvinsky-pardon-218632|accessdate=May 29, 2018|work=[[Politico]]|date=February 3, 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly $10 million was involved in the crimes. Shortly after Mezvinsky's indictment, he was diagnosed with [[bipolar disorder]], but the judge at his trial disallowed a [[mental illness]] [[Diminished responsibility|defense]].&lt;ref name=dmr/&gt;

He entered prison in February 2003, and served his time at [[Federal Prison Camp, Eglin]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/11/us/national-briefing-mid-atlantic-pennsylvania-ex-congressman-enters-prison.html?partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss "Pennsylvania: Ex-Congressman Enters Prison"], ''[[The New York Times]]''.

== History ==
In 1998, in response to calls for the [[devolution]] of power to [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]], Robin Tilbrook aimed at reforming the [[English National Party]], which had ceased operating in 1981. This project included members of the [[Devolved English parliament|Campaign for an English Parliament]], a [[Advocacy group|pressure group]] that lobbies for a devolved English Parliament. The party was relaunched as the "English Democrats" in September 2002, after merging with several other smaller political parties. In October 2004 the party merged with the Reform UK Party, which was a small splinter group from the [[UK Independence Party|United Kingdom Independence Party]] (UKIP). The [[New England Party]] merged with the English Democrats in February 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://northwest.englishdemocrats.party/about-2/|title=About English Democrats North West|website=northwest.englishdemocrats.party|language=en|accessdate=21 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222193744/http://northwest.englishdemocrats.party/about-2/|archive-date=22 February 2017|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The English Democrats were co-founders of the English Constitutional Convention,&lt;ref name="ECC001"&gt;{{cite web|title=Devolution for England – The way forward |publisher=English Constitution Convention |url=http://www.englishconstitutionalconvention.com/ |accessdate=8 August 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070708090225/http://englishconstitutionalconvention.com/ |archivedate=8 July 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; now defunct.

In December 2004, it was rumoured that [[Robert Kilroy-Silk]], the former UKIP [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]] had entered into negotiation to join the English Democrats.&lt;ref name="Guardian1372973"&gt;{{cite news| last = Hyde | first = Marina | title = Diary | work = [[The Guardian]] | date = 14 December 2004 | url = https://www.theguardian.com/diary/story/0,,1372973,00.html| accessdate =8 August 2007 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Kilroy-Silk formed [[Veritas (political party)|Veritas]] instead.

In 2007, the columnist and TV medical doctor [[Vernon Coleman]] announced he had joined the English Democrats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vernoncoleman.com/englishdemo.htm|title=Why I've Joined The English Democrats|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The party's most significant electoral success came when Peter Davies (a former UKIP and Reform UK member), its candidate for Mayor of Doncaster, was [[Doncaster Council mayoral election, 2009|elected]]. Having received 16,961 votes in the first round, 189 votes behind the [[independent (politician)|independent]] Michael Maye, Davies was returned in the second count on transfers of second preference votes, with 25,344 votes to 24,990.&lt;ref name="DoncasterMayor2009"&gt;{{cite news| title =English Democrat is new Mayor of Doncaster| work= [[The Independent]]| url =https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/english-democrat-is-new-mayor-of-doncaster-1697869.html | accessdate =5 June 2009|location=London| first=Celia|last=Paul|date=5 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mayoral Election 2009 Results"&gt;{{cite web |title=Mayoral Election 2009 Results |url=http://www.doncaster.gov.uk/services/the-council-democracy/mayoral-election-results-2009 |work= |publisher=Doncaster Council |date=5 June 2009 |accessdate=9 September 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Davies announced his resignation from the party on 5 February 2013 citing "a big influx of new members joining from the British National Party".&lt;ref name="resignation"&gt;''BBC News'' [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-21335384 "Doncaster mayor quits English Democrats 'because of BNP'"], 5 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt; One of its councillors, Mick Glynn, resigned the following day after the party's chairman, Tilbrook, launched a personal attack on Davies, thus reducing its number of elected representatives to two.&lt;ref&gt;England Watch blog [http://englandwatch.wordpress.com/2013/02/07/another-english-democrat-councillor-resigns/ "Another English Democrat Councillor Resigns."], 7 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The English Democrats lost their remaining councillors in the 2015 local elections.

The party claimed a total membership of 1,011 at the end of 2004, and 1,202 at the end of 2005.&lt;ref name="EC001"&gt;{{cite web|title=English Democrats Party Statement of Accounts |publisher=[[Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)|Electoral Commission]] |date=31 December 2005 |url=http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/files/dms/EnglishDemocrats_23009-17188__E__N__S__W__.PDF |archive-url=https://www.webarchive.org.uk/wayback/archive/20070305120000/http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/files/dms/EnglishDemocrats_23009-17188__E__N__S__W__.PDF |dead-url=yes |archive-date=5 March 2007 |accessdate=8 August 2007 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Parliamentary elections ===
At the [[Birmingham Hodge Hill by-election, 2004|2004 Birmingham Hodge Hill by-election]] the English Democrat candidate received 277 votes, or 1.4% of the votes cast.&lt;ref name="bbc3898823"&gt;{{cite news| title = Lib Dems snatch Labour seat| website = [[BBC Online]] | date = 16 July 2004| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/3898823.stm | accessdate =15 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The party's slogan for the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005 general election]] was "The English Democrats – Putting England First!" In total, the English Democrats fielded 25 candidates for the May 2005 general election,&lt;ref name="UKGE001"&gt;{{cite web| last = Kimber | first = Richard | title = UK General Election candidates 2005: Number of candidates by party | website = Political Science Resources| date = 2 February 2007| url = http://www.politicsresources.net/area/uk/ge05/cand/EDP.htm| accessdate =23 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Staffordshire]] South where the election was delayed until June due to the death of a candidate. The party withdrew its candidate in [[North Norfolk (UK Parliament constituency)|North Norfolk]] and endorsed the Conservative Party candidate, [[Iain Dale]], as he had "taken the issues of English discrimination seriously".&lt;ref name="edp"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.edp24.co.uk/content/edp24/news/story.aspx?brand=EDPOnline&amp;category=News&amp;tBrand=edponline&amp;tCategory=news&amp;itemid=NOED30%20Mar%202005%2009%3A10%3A08%3A783|title=English Democrat party bows out|date=30 March 2005|work=Eastern Daily Press|accessdate=2 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Garry Bushell]], the former ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|Sun]]'' journalist and current ''[[Daily Star (United Kingdom)|Daily Star Sunday]]'' TV critic, became the most high-profile candidate for the English Democrats, standing in the [[Greenwich and Woolwich (UK Parliament constituency)|Greenwich and Woolwich]] constituency in [[London]].&lt;ref name="UKGE002"&gt;{{cite web| last = Kimber| first = Richard| title = UK General Election candidates 2005 – English Democrats| website = Political Science Resources| date = 2 February 2007| url = http://www.politicsresources.net/area/uk/ge05/cand/EDP.htm | accessdate =8 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bushell's 1,216 votes (3.4%) beat the [[UK Independence Party|UKIP]] candidate, Stan Gain, who secured 709 votes (2.0%);&lt;ref name="Guardian984"&gt;{{cite news|title=Greenwich and Woolwich |work=[[The Guardian]] |year=2005 |url=http://politics.guardian.co.uk/hoc/constituency/0,,-984,00/html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130420061619/http://politics.guardian.co.uk/hoc/constituency/0,,-984,00/html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=20 April 2013 |accessdate=8 August 2007 |location=London }}&lt;/ref&gt; this was the party's best result for the election though still a fifth-place performance.

In June 2005, Bushell also stood in [[South Staffordshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Staffordshire South]], where he received 643 votes (2.5%) coming fifth out of eight candidates.&lt;ref name="BBC535"&gt;{{cite news| title = Result: Staffordshire South| website = [[BBC Online]] | date = 24 June 2005 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/vote2005/html/535.stm | accessdate =8 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Bushell announced that he would, in future, be supporting UKIP.

The English Democrats fielded Joanne Robinson as their candidate in the [[Haltemprice and Howden by-election, 2008|by-election]] forced by the resignation of former shadow home secretary [[David Davis (British politician)|David Davis]] from the House of Commons. Because of [[David Davis by-election campaign, 2008|the issues raised by David Davis]] in the by-election, many parties other than the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]], such as [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]], [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]], [[UK Independence Party|United Kingdom Independence Party]] (UKIP) and [[British National Party]] (BNP) chose not to stand. Joanne Robinson came third, with 1,714 votes (7.2%), 44 votes fewer than the Green candidate received in second place. Of the 26 candidates she was one of only three to win back her deposit. This result is both the highest place gained and the highest percentage of the votes won by any English Democrat candidate in a parliamentary election or parliamentary by-election.&lt;ref name="Guardian991"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://politics.guardian.co.uk/hoc/constituency/0,,-991,00.html |title=Ask Aristotle: Haltemprice and Howden |accessdate=11 July 2008 |date=2 May 2008 |work= |website=[[The Guardian]] |location=London |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080615025338/http://politics.guardian.co.uk/hoc/constituency/0%2C%2C-991%2C00.html |archivedate=15 June 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[United Kingdom general election, 2015|2015 general election]], the party contested 32 seats, securing a total of 6,531 votes (0.02%).

In the [[Batley and Spen by-election, 2016|2016 Batley and Spen by-election]], the English Democrats received 4.8% of the votes, coming second to Labour's [[Tracy Brabin]], when all of the other major parties did not stand.

=== European Parliament elections ===
==== 2004 ====
The English Democrats stood candidates for the [[European Parliament election, 2004 (United Kingdom)|2004 European Parliament election]] in five of the nine regions of England. The party’s 2004 election canvassing leaflet featured the slogan, "Not left, not right, just English". Its candidates received 130,056 votes in total.

==== 2009 ====
In June 2009, the English Democrats contested [[European Parliament election, 2009 (United Kingdom)|elections to the European Parliament]]. The party fielded a full slate of candidates across the nine [[Regions of England|English European parliament constituencies]]. On 18 May 2009, the English Democrats broadcast their first national [[Party political broadcast|Party Election Broadcast]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=English Democrats Party European election broadcast|work=BBC News |date=18 May 2009 |accessdate=9 June 2009 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/8056575.stm }}&lt;/ref&gt; They came seventh in the election in England (ninth in the UK as a whole) with 279,801 votes or 1.8%, a rise from the 0.7% they received at the previous elections in 2004. The English Democrats do not stand in Northern Ireland, Scotland or Wales, and their vote across England in 2009 was 2.1%, an increase of 1.3% yet still did not keep their deposits except in Yorkshire and the Humber where they gained 2.6% of the vote. None of the English Democrats candidates were elected; the English Democrats were the highest-polling party across the UK not to have an MEP elected.

==== 2014 ====
The English Democrats began their [[European Parliament election, 2014 (United Kingdom)|2014 EU election campaign]] in September 2013 with an extensive social media campaign. On 30 April 2014, they held a rally at [[Fobbing]] in [[Essex]], the site of the 1381 [[Peasants' Revolt]], and declared, "let the English revolt begin."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=English Democrats demand 'revolt' at elections launch|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-27218757|accessdate=12 May 2014|newspaper=[[BBC News]]|date=30 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party fielded a full slate of candidates across the nine [[Regions of England|English European parliament constituencies]] on 22 May 2014.

In November 2005, the party achieved its first electoral success when Paul Adams was elected to [[Crowborough]] Town Council, polling 120 votes, or 56.8% of the poll, on a turnout of 10%.&lt;ref name="CTC002"&gt;{{cite web | last = Blanshard | first = Heather | title = St. Johns Ward – Declaration of result of poll | publisher = Crowborough Town Council | date = 25 November 2005 | url = http://www.wealden.gov.uk/Council/Electoral_services/Results/documents/CrowStJohns241105.PDF | accessdate = 8 August 2007 | format = [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071027213938/http://www.wealden.gov.uk/Council/Electoral_services/Results/documents/CrowStJohns241105.PDF | archivedate = 27 October 2007 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom local elections, 2007|2007 local elections]], 78 candidates stood for election in boroughs and districts in 15 English counties, including 20 in [[Dartford Council election, 2007|Dartford]] and ten in [[Portsmouth Council election, 2007|Portsmouth]]. All were unsuccessful.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

In 2008, the party fielded candidates in 12 district council elections. None was elected. The party's best results were when it came second to the Conservatives: in the [[Finningley]] ward of Doncaster and in three wards in Rochford.&lt;ref name="EDP150"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://englishdemocrats.org.uk//index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=150&amp;Itemid=2 |title=English Democrats Election Results |accessdate=15 May 2008 |date=2 May 2008 |work= |publisher=English Democrats Party}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2009 English local elections, the party fielded 84 county council and local authority candidates, with a particular focus in Bristol, Essex, Hampshire, Kent, Northamptonshire, Nottinghamshire, Wiltshire and Lancashire.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} The party had an unexpected success when Peter Davies, its candidate for Mayor of Doncaster, was elected. Having received 16,961 votes in the first round, 189 votes behind the [[independent (politician)|independent]] Michael Maye, Davies was returned in the second count on transfers of second preference votes, with 25,344 votes to 24,990.&lt;ref name="DoncasterMayor2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mayoral Election 2009 Results" /&gt;

In 2010, the party also stood in the local elections on 6 May, but did not publish a list of candidates.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} The two sitting English Democrat councillors on Calderdale and Blackburn with Darwen councils retired, and the party did not nominate any candidates to contest the seats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calderdale.gov.uk/council/democracy/election-information/district-election/index.html |title=Notice of election |author= |date=29 March 2010 |work= |publisher=Calderdale Council |accessdate=7 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100510021116/http://www.calderdale.gov.uk/council/democracy/election-information/district-election/index.html |archivedate=10 May 2010 }}&lt;br&gt;- {{cite web|url=http://www.blackburn.gov.uk/server.php?show=ConWebDoc.51745|title=Local elections candidates 2010|author=|date=|work=|publisher=Blackburn with Darwen Council|accessdate=7 May 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606120254/http://www.blackburn.gov.uk/server.php?show=ConWebDoc.51745|archivedate=6 June 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the EDP stood about 130 candidates in district level elections; two were elected. The [[Boston (borough)|Boston Borough Council]] elections on 5 May 2011, saw the election of the first two EDP councillors. David Owens and Elliott Fountain were elected in the Fenside Ward for a four-year term, thus becoming the only EDP members of a district council to be elected by public vote. A sitting EDP councillor on Peterborough council lost his seat.

The party fielded a candidate in the 3 March 2011 local by-election for the [[Walkden]] North ward of [[Salford City Council]]. Its candidate, Laurence Depares, polled 125 votes (7%) and came third, ahead of the British National Party and [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]];&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.salford.gov.uk/byelection03032011.htm By-election result: 3 March 2011] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221224611/https://www.salford.gov.uk/byelection03032011.htm |date=21 February 2014 }}, Salford City Council&lt;/ref&gt; in a by-election in the same city's Swinton South ward on 7 January 2014 the party was fifth with 54 votes (3.7%).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.salford.gov.uk/results.htm By-election result: 7 January 2014] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222015757/https://www.salford.gov.uk/results.htm |date=22 February 2014 }}, Salford City Council&lt;/ref&gt;

The EDP contested the [[Directly elected mayors in England and Wales|mayoral elections]] in [[Directly elected mayor of Liverpool|Liverpool]] and [[Directly elected mayor of Salford|Salford]].

=== Welsh Assembly ===
In 2007, in line with [[English Democrats Party#Traditional counties|the English Democrats stance on the status of Monmouthshire]], 13 English Democrat candidates contested the [[National Assembly for Wales|Welsh Assembly]] elections in the South East Wales region, and the constituencies of Monmouth (fifth with 2.7%), Newport East (sixth, 2.2%) and Newport West (fifth, 2.7%).&lt;ref name="BBC003"&gt;{{cite news| title = Welsh assembly election 2007| website = [[BBC Online]]| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/nol/shared/bsp/hi/vote2007/maps/wales_constituencies/html/wales_constituencies_map.stm | accessdate =8 August 2007  | date=21 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party also received 0.9% of the vote on the regional list.

In the [[National Assembly for Wales election, 2011|2011 Welsh Assembly election]], the party fielded the Kent-based Steve Uncles as its candidate in [[Monmouth (Assembly constituency)|Monmouth]], in line with its view that [[Monmouthshire]] should be returned to English governance (Monmouthshire has been considered Welsh since at least 1974, after its status as part of England or Wales [[Monmouthshire (historic)#The 16th to 19th centuries|had been ambiguous]] after 1542). He polled 744 (2.47%) of the votes cast. The incumbent Conservative assembly member was returned.

The party contested the [[National Assembly for Wales election, 2016|2016 Welsh Assembly election]] in Monmouth. Its candidate, Stephen Morris, received 146 votes, 0.5% of the votes cast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = Monmouth Welsh Assembly constituency| website = [[BBC Online]]| url =https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/politics/wales-constituencies/W09000034 | accessdate =30 May 2016 | date=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== London Mayoral elections ===
In July 2007, Garry Bushell was nominated as the English Democrats' Mayoral candidate for the [[London mayoral election, 2008|2008 London mayoral and Assembly elections]] with the campaign slogan "Serious About London".&lt;ref name="Bushell"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gary Bushell Serious about London |publisher=English Democrats |url=http://www.garryformayor.com/index.php |accessdate=8 August 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011203210/http://www.garryformayor.com/index.php |archivedate=11 October 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2008, he stepped down as candidate because of work commitments and [[Matt O'Connor (activist)|Matt O'Connor]], the founder of [[Fathers 4 Justice]], was selected by the English Democrats in his place with his campaign expected to start on 14 February.

One week before the election, on 25 April, O'Connor told [[Vanessa Feltz]] and the [[BBC]] that he was dropping out of the Mayoral race, giving as his reasons the lack of support within the English Democrats on [[St George's Day]] and a lack of press coverage&lt;ref name="BBC7366662"&gt;{{cite news| title = O'Connor quits Mayoral contest| publisher = |work= BBC News | date = 25 April 2008 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7366662.stm | accessdate =25 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the party's co-operation with the far-right group [[England First Party|England First]].&lt;ref name="ELA"&gt;{{cite news| title = O'Connor accuses English Democrats of BNP link after quitting race for Mayor| work = [[East London Advertiser]] | author=Mike Brooke |date = 25 April 2008 | url=http://www.eastlondonadvertiser.co.uk/raceformayor/mayorELA/story.aspx?brand=ELAOnline&amp;category=voteforme&amp;tBrand=elaonline&amp;tCategory=voteforme&amp;itemid=WeED25%20Apr%202008%2013%3A45%3A29%3A573 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090522003840/http://www.eastlondonadvertiser.co.uk/raceformayor/mayorELA/story.aspx?brand=ELAOnline&amp;category=voteforme&amp;tBrand=elaonline&amp;tCategory=voteforme&amp;itemid=WeED25%20Apr%202008%2013%3A45%3A29%3A573 | archivedate= 22 May 2009 | accessdate =7 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The English Democrats released a press statement on their website in response to his resignation voicing disappointment at his decision to quit the contest.&lt;ref name="EDP142"&gt;{{cite news| title = Matt O'Connor's shock resignation press release| publisher = English Democrats | date = 25 April 2008| url = http://englishdemocrats.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=142&amp;Itemid=1 | accessdate =25 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Connor received 10,695 first preference votes (representing 0.44% of the votes cast) in the mayoral contest, ranking ninth out of ten candidates; he received 73,538 second preference votes (3.67%), ranking eighth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = London mayoral election 2008 | publisher = |work=BBC News | date = 6 May 2008 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/bsp/hi/elections/london/08/html/mayor.stm | accessdate =15 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Members holding local government seats ==
In November 2005, Paul Adams became the first elected English Democrats councillor at parish level for [[Crowborough]] Town Council in [[East Sussex]], polling 120 votes of 211 cast; he was returned in 2007 in an uncontested election. In 2011, he was elected as an independent, so the English Democrats lost the seat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wealden.gov.uk/Wealden/Your_Council/Democracy/Voting_and_Elections/Election_Results/Democracy_Election_Results.aspx|title=Election Results|publisher=Wealden District Council}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, Markyate Parish councillor Simon Deacon defected from the [[British National Party]], to the English Democrats, having been elected unopposed. However, he resigned in October 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://englandwatch.wordpress.com/2012/10/19/english-democrats-loose-another-councillor/|title=English Democrats loose another councillor!|work=England Watch}}&lt;/ref&gt; The English Democrats gained another parish council seat when Mick Glynn was elected for the Dunsville ward of Hatfield Town Council, Doncaster. Following the resignation of Peter Davies, Glynn resigned his seat and membership of the party in February 2013.

The party had two district councillors elected (the first above parish level) in the 2011 local elections and obtained a further county council seat through the defection of a BNP, later "Independent Nationalist", councillor in Hertfordshire. However, the county councillor did not defend the seat in the [[United Kingdom local elections, 2013|May 2013]] election, nor did the EDP put forward another candidate, losing them the seat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.threerivers.gov.uk/GetResource.aspx?file=Statement_of_Persons_Nominated_for_Hertfordshire_County_Council_Elections_-_2_May_2013.pdf|title=Home|author=|publisher=Three Rivers District Council}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The EDP lost one of its district councillors, Elliott Fountain, on 25 July 2013 after he failed to attend any meetings in six months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisislincolnshire.co.uk/Absent-councillor-pound-7k-allowance-claim/story-19587114-detail/story.html#ixzz2av70XYUj|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130803153748/http://www.thisislincolnshire.co.uk/Absent-councillor-pound-7k-allowance-claim/story-19587114-detail/story.html%23ixzz2av70XYUj#ixzz2av70XYUj|dead-url=yes|title=Absent Boston councillor in £7k allowance claim|work=Boston Target|date=2 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[United Kingdom local elections, 2015|2015 local elections]], the English Democrats have no representation on any local authorities.

== Party policies ==
=== An English Parliament, but no longer Independence ===
The English Democrat leader frequently changes the parties constitutional offering.  Since 2016 they propose creating a unified, devolved English Parliament, within a federal UK, not an independent sovereign state. An English Executive and First Minister with the same powers as Scottish ones, and a reformed Second Chamber at Westminster. It proposes fiscal devolution so that the English, Scottish, Welsh and N. Irish parliaments become responsible for financing their own expenditure.&lt;ref&gt;English Democrats ''[http://englishdemocrats.party/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/EDP-manifesto-September-2016-1.pdf''], September 2016, para 3.22. Retrieved 3 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the party rejected suggestions that non-English MPs in the House of Commons should be barred from voting on England-specific matters, on the basis that this would lead to there being, in effect, two parliaments in the same building and that this would be problematic.&lt;ref name="BBC4792120"&gt;{{cite news| title = No English parliament – Falconer | website = [[BBC Online]] | date = 10 March 2006 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4792120.stm| accessdate =8 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From March 2014 to the 2015 general election, the party chairman Robin Tilbrook had suggested [[English independence|England should become an independent country]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-26583314 "English Democrats seek independence for England"], ''BBC News'', 19 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Temporarily rekindling its roots, his 2015 general election campaign launch was moved on from Traitors Gate (Tower of London), to the nearby Hung, Drawn and Quartered pub. Tilbrook accused various political parties of being traitors to the English (Labour, the Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru and Sinn Fein), and the United Kingdom Independence Party "have no interest in England whatsoever". He said the party was "consolidating our position as the English nationalist party".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2015-32221075 "English Democrats launch campaign with attack on 'traitors'"], ''BBC News'', 8 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

=== European Union ===
The party favours deciding England's future relationship with the [[European Union]] by a nationwide multiple-choice referendum, which would include the option to withdraw from it entirely. The English Democrats are committed to campaign on the "withdrawal" side of any referendum.

=== Traditional counties ===
The party is supportive of [[Counties of the United Kingdom|historic counties]]. It has called for a referendum on whether [[Monmouthshire (historic)|Monmouthshire]] should be part of England rather than Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = Manifesto of the English Democrats| website = BBC News| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/EDP_uk_manifesto.pdf| format = [[Portable Document Format|PDF]]| accessdate =8 March 2008}}&lt;br&gt;- [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-east-wales-12726556 "English Democrats want vote on Monmouthshire Welshness"], ''BBC News South West Wales'', 13 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

It contested the [[Monmouth (UK Parliament constituency)|constituency of Monmouth]] in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2015|2015 general election]], receiving 100 votes (0.2% of votes cast).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/2015guide/monmouth/|title=UK Polling Report|publisher= |website= UK Polling Report}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nationalist connections ==
On 17 November 2011, the chairman of the English Democrats, Robin Tilbrook, met Sergey Yerzunov, a member of the executive committee of the Russian right-wing group [[Russky Obraz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rus-obraz.net/en/activity/252|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120804024436/http://rus-obraz.net/en/activity/252|archivedate=4 August 2012|title=Robin Tilbrook meets Russian Nationalists|website=rus-obraz.net|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterwards, Obraz announced that they were in alliance with the English Democrats. Other members of this alliance include Serbian [[Obraz (organization)|Obraz]], [[1389 Movement]], [[Golden Dawn (Greece)|Golden Dawn]], [[Party of the Danes|Danes' Party]], [[Slovenska Pospolitost]], [[Workers' Party (Czech Republic)|Workers' Party]] and [[Noua Dreaptă]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://right-world.net/en/countries/russia/obraz|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150323094714/http://www.right-world.net/en/countries/russia/obraz|archivedate=23 March 2015|title=Russian Obraz|website=right-world.net|accessdate=12 January 2012|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2010, a number of former members of the BNP have joined the project, with the party chairman quoted as saying, "They will help us become an electorally credible party."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=English Democrats|url=http://www.hopenothate.org.uk/hate-groups/edp/|work=[[Hope not Hate]]|accessdate=16 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161201031440/http://www.hopenothate.org.uk/hate-groups/edp/|archive-date=1 December 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an April 2013 interview, Tilbrook said that about 200-300 out of the party's membership of 3,000 were former BNP members. He said it was "perfectly fair" that such people would "change their minds" and join a "moderate, sensible English nationalist party".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-22268414 | work=BBC News | title='Up to one in 10' English Democrat members were in BNP | date=23 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New England Party===
The New England Party was a local party in [[Dartford]] from March 2003 to February 2007, when it merged with the English Democrats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://englandwatch.wordpress.com/2012/08/28/new-england-party/|title=New England Party|work=England Watch|date=28 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its leader, nominating officer and treasurer was Michael Tibby while Sheila Tibby was its campaigns officer.

Michael Tibby and Austen Brooker were councillors on [[Dartford (borough)|Dartford]] Borough Council between 2003 and 2007, representing [[Littlebrook]] and [[Newtown, Kent|Newtown]]. Tibby came second in Littlebrook in the 2003 local elections, while Brooker was elected as one of three [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] councillors for Newtown, but left Labour soon after his election in May 2003, initially as an independent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hillingdontimes.co.uk/archive/display.var.336929.0.councillor_defects_from_labour_group.php|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927043224/http://www.hillingdontimes.co.uk/archive/display.var.336929.0.councillor_defects_from_labour_group.php|dead-url=yes|archive-date=27 September 2007|work=Hillingdon Times|title=Councillor defects from Labour group|date=20 May 2003 |first=Lucy |last=Brinicombe|accessdate=14 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brooker stood down at the 2007 local elections and Tibby was unsuccessful in seeking re-election for the English Democrats, coming third.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://committeedmz.dartford.gov.uk/mgElectionAreaResults.aspx?ID=8|title=Election results for Littlebrook|work=Dartford Borough Council |date=May 2007 |accessdate=14 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael Tibby contested [[Dartford (UK Parliament constituency)|Dartford]] at the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005 general election]], receiving 1,224 votes (the elected Labour [[Member of Parliament|MP]], [[Howard Stoate]], received 19,909 votes). The party contested the Dartford Borough Council Heath ward by-election on 27 July 2006, polling 174 votes (9.6%). The candidate was Steven Uncles, who had been the English Democrats candidate in the [[Bromley and Chislehurst by-election, 2006|2006 Bromley and Chislehurst by-election]].

The New England Party merged with the English Democrats in February 2007.&lt;ref name=hnh&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hopenothate.org.uk/hate-groups/edp/|title=English Democrats Party|work=Hope Not Hate|accessdate=14 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161201031440/http://www.hopenothate.org.uk/hate-groups/edp/|archive-date=1 December 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://englishdemocrats.party/our-party/party-history/|title=Party History|work= |publisher=English Democrats|date=2 September 2015|accessdate=14 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Global Network Initiative''' ('''GNI''') is a [[non-governmental organization]] with the dual goals of preventing [[Internet censorship]] by [[authoritarian]] [[government]]s and protecting the [[Internet privacy]] rights of individuals. It is sponsored by a coalition of [[multinational corporation]]s, [[non-profit organization]]s, and [[universities]].

==History==

On October 29, 2008, the Global Network Initiative (GNI) was founded upon its "Principles of Freedom of Expression and Privacy".{{citequote|date=June 2012}}  The Initiative was launched in the 60th anniversary year of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR), and is based on internationally recognized laws and standards for [[human rights]] on [[freedom of expression]] and [[privacy]] set out in the UDHR, the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR) and the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] (ICESCR).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globalnetworkinitiative.org/faq/index.php |title=Global Network Initiative, FAQ |accessdate=March 6, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090309234331/http://www.globalnetworkinitiative.org/faq/index.php |archivedate=March 9, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Profile==
As a [[human rights organization]], GNI seeks to safeguard freedom of expression and personal privacy against government restrictions. The protections are facilitated by a coalition of companies, investors, civil society organizations, academics, and other stakeholders.

GNI esteems freedom of expression and privacy each as a "human right and guarantor of human dignity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Network Initiative - Principles|url=http://www.globalnetworkinitiative.org/principles/index.php|accessdate=26 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Participants are expected to respect and protect information available to users and users' ability to freely create and distribute information, provided that they operate outside narrowly defined circumstances necessary to adhere to international laws and standards set by the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR).

Participants are also expected to protect users' personal information from illegal or arbitrary interference when confronted with government demands, laws, or regulations that compromise a user's privacy. The same principle of adherence of international laws and standards applies.

Collaboration among stakeholders is key to the goals of the Global Network Initiative. The GNI's outline of principles encourages participants to explore ways to engage governments advance their cause, individually or collectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Principles: Multi-stakeholder collaboration|url=http://www.globalnetworkinitiative.org/principles/index.php#21|accessdate=26 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GNI recognizes that the actions of their corporate participants alone cannot guarantee the protection of human rights. One fundamental commitment is to promote the adoption of laws, policies, and practices that protect freedom of expression and privacy. GNI considers governments to be ultimately responsible for the fulfillment of their citizens' human rights, specifically pursuant to freedom of expression and privacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FAQ: How will the Global Network Initiative accomplish its goals?|url=http://www.globalnetworkinitiative.org/faq/index.php#48|accessdate=26 April 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090309234331/http://www.globalnetworkinitiative.org/faq/index.php#48|archivedate=9 March 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''government mouthpiece''' is a [[pejorative]] term for media outlets which are widely viewed as being an accessory to an oppressive government as well as its [[propaganda]]. Such media networks are typically criticized for taking government statements at face value without challenging their positions. Critics of such networks may criticize such networks as being a mimicker or parrot of whatever the government may say. Such lack of [[media independence]] is subsequently said to result in media that is biased, and hence cannot be trusted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jeevantjee|first1=Anver|title=Diversity in the Media|date=2008|page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Other Hong Kong Report 1996 - Page 523, Mee Kau Nyaw, Li Si-Ming - 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hazard analysis and risk-based preventive controls''' or '''HARPC''' is a successor to the [[Hazard analysis and critical control points]] (HACCP) food safety system. It is mandated by the [[FDA Food Safety Modernization Act]] (FSMA) of 2010. As the name implies, Preventive Controls systems emphasize prevention of hazards before they occur rather than their detection after they occur.&lt;ref name="SherodABCs"&gt;{{cite web |last=Sherod |first=Anne |date=11 May 2015 |title=The ABCs Of Building A Food Safety Plan: From HACCP To HARPC |url=http://www.foodonline.com/doc/the-abc-s-of-building-a-food-safety-plan-from-haccp-to-harpc-0001 |website=foodonline.com |access-date=2 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[FDA]] is releasing the rules in the Federal Registry beginning in September 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bonar |first=Samantha |date=10 September 2015 |title=FDA takes important steps in modernizing food safety system |url=http://www.latimes.com/food/dailydish/la-dd-fda-food-safety-system-20150910-story.html |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |location= |access-date= 10 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first release of rules addressed Preventive Controls for Human Food and Preventive Controls for Foods for Animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lgma.ca.gov/2015/09/first-fsma-rules-finalized-by-fda |title=First FSMA Rules Finalized by FDA |last1=Horsfall |first1=Scott |date= |website= |publisher=LGMA |access-date=17 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Produce Safety Final Rule, the Foreign Supplier Verification Programs (FSVP) Final Rule and the Accredited Third-Party Certification Final Rule were issued on November 13, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=FDA Issues Final Rules on Produce Safety, Imported Foods |url=http://www.foodqualityandsafety.com/article/fda-issues-final-rules-on-produce-safety-imported-foods |newspaper=Food Quality &amp; Safety |location= |date=16 November 2015 |access-date=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sanitary Transportation of Human and Animal Food final rule was issued on April 6, 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{Federal Register|81|20091}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Mitigation Strategies To Protect Food Against Intentional Adulteration (Food Defense) final rule was issued on May 27, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Whitworth |first=Joe |date=27 May 2016 |title=FDA issues rule to protect against intentional adulteration  |url=http://www.foodqualitynews.com/Regulation-and-safety/FDA-finalises-last-FSMA-rule |newspaper=Food Quality News |location= |access-date=1 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
==Scope==
All food companies in the United States that are required to register with the FDA under the [[Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act]] of 2002, as well as firms outside the US that export food to the US, must have a written FSMA-compliant Food Safety Plan in place by the deadlines listed below:

*Very small businesses of less than $1 million in sales per year are exempt, but must provide proof to the FDA of their very small status by January 1, 2016. 
*Businesses subject to Juice HACCP ({{CodeFedReg|21|120}}) and Seafood HACCP ({{CodeFedReg|21|123}}) are exempt.
*Businesses subject to the [[Pasteurized Milk Ordinance]]; Sept 17, 2018.
*Small businesses, defined as having fewer than 500 full-time equivalent employees; Sept 17, 2017. 
*All other businesses; Sept 17, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/food/guidanceregulation/fsma/ucm334115.htm#Compliance_Dates |title=FSMA Final Rule for Preventive Controls for Human Food |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=22 October 2015 |website=fda.gov |publisher=Food and Drug Administration |access-date=24 October 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, for the first time food safety is being extended to [[pet food]] and [[animal feed]], with firms being given an extra year to implement [[Current Good Manufacturing Practices]] before a Preventive Controls system the following year:

*Primary Production Farms, defined as "an operation under one management in one general, but not necessarily contiguous, location devoted to the growing of crops, the harvesting of crops, the raising of animals (including seafood), or any combination of these activities" are exempt. 
*Very small businesses of less than $2,500,000 in sales per year; Sept 17, 2018 for [[Good manufacturing practice|cGMP]], Sept 17, 2019 for Preventive Controls, but must provide proof of very small business status by January 1, 2017.  
*Small businesses, having fewer than 500 full-time equivalent employees; Sept 17, 2017 for cGMP, Sept 17, 2018 for Preventive Controls. 
*All other businesses; Sept 17, 2016 for cGMP, Sept 17, 2017 for Preventive Controls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/FSMA/ucm366510.htm#Compliance_Dates |title=FSMA Final Rule for Preventive Controls for Animal Food |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=21 October 2015 |website=fda.gov |publisher=Food and Drug Administration |access-date=24 October 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
The FDA estimates that 73,000 businesses currently fall under these definitions.

==Differences between FSMA Preventive Controls and HACCP==

*FSMA places a much stronger emphasis on science, research and prior experience with outbreaks than HACCP. For example, the FDA now uses [[whole genome sequencing]] to match the exact strain of pathogen isolated from hospital patients to DNA recovered from food manufacturing facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Alonso-Zaldiva |first=Ricardo |date=9 June 2016 |title=Investigator: FDA still taking months to recall tainted food |url=http://www.bradenton.com/news/business/article82698737.html |newspaper=Bradenton Herald |location=Bradenton, Florida |access-date=9 June 2016 }}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=How Whole-Genome Sequencing Can Help Fight Foodborne Illness |url=https://www.foodsafetymagazine.com/news/how-whole-genome-sequencing-can-help-fight-foodborne-illness |work= |location= |date=14 September 2017 |access-date=18 September 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''History of Rome''''' ({{lang-de|Römische Geschichte}}) is a multi-volume history of [[ancient Rome]] written by [[Theodor Mommsen]] (1817–1903). Originally published by Reimer &amp; Hirsel, [[Leipzig]], as three volumes during 1854–1856, the work dealt with the [[Roman Republic]]. A subsequent book was issued which concerned the provinces of the [[Roman Empire]]. Recently published was a further book on the Empire, reconstructed from lecture notes. The initial three volumes won widespread acclaim upon publication; indeed, "The ''Roman History'' made Mommsen famous in a day."&lt;ref&gt;[[George Peabody Gooch|G. P. Gooch]], ''History and Historians in the Nineteenth Century'' (London: Longmans, Green 1913, 4th impr. 1928) at 456.&lt;/ref&gt;  Still read and qualifiedly cited, it is the prolific Mommsen's most well-known work. The work was specifically cited when Mommsen was awarded the [[Nobel Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;"Facts on the Nobel Prize in Literature: Awarded for a particular literary work:" While the Nobel Prize in Literature is for a writer's life work, there are nine Literature Laureates for whom the Swedish Academy singled out a specific work for particular recognition. "Theodor Mommsen in 1902: 'the greatest living master of the art of historical writing, with special reference to his monumental work, A history of Rome'" http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/shortfacts.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genesis==

[[File:Theodor Mommsen 02.jpg|thumb|175px|right|[[Theodor Mommsen]] in 1863]]

Writing the ''History'' followed Mommsen's earlier achievements in the study of ancient Rome. He had not himself designed to write a history, but the opportunity presented itself in 1850 while at the [[University of Leipzig]] where Mommsen was a thirty-two-year-old special Professor of Law. "Invited to give a public lecture while at [[Leipzig]], I delivered an address on the [[Gracchi]]. Reimer and Hirzel, the publishers, were present, and two days later they asked me to write a Roman History for their series."&lt;ref&gt;G. P. Gooch, ''History and Historians in the Nineteenth Century'' (1913, 1928) at 456, quoting Mommsen's letter to the novelist Freytag.&lt;/ref&gt; Having been dismissed from the University for revolutionary activities, Mommsen would accept the publishing proposal "partly for my livelihood, and partly because the work greatly appeals to me."&lt;ref&gt;Cf., Alexander Demandt, "Introduction" at 1–35, 1, in Mommsen, ''A History of Rome under the Emperors'' (London: Routledge 1996).&lt;/ref&gt;

The publishers specified that the work focus on events and circumstances, and avoid discussing the scholarly process. While they certainly wanted a well-respected academic work to fit their acclaimed series on history, Karl Reimer and Solomon Hirzel were also seeking one with literary merit that would be accessible and appeal to the educated public. As a scholar Mommsen was an active party in recent advances made in ancient Roman studies. Yet Mommsen also had some experience as a journalist. He might well manage to become a popular academic author.&lt;ref&gt;Sauders and Collins, "Introduction" at 1–17, 5–6, to their edition of Mommsen, ''History of Rome'' (New Haven: Meridian Books 1958).&lt;/ref&gt; "It is high time for such a work", Mommsen wrote to an associate in Roman studies, "it is more than ever necessary to present to a wider audience the results of our researches."&lt;ref&gt;Gooch, ''History and Historians in the Nineteenth Century'' (1913, 1928) at 456, quoting Mommsen's correspondence to Henzen.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;On a different note, Mommsen would marry Marie Reimer, the daughter of his Leipzig publisher; together they had sixteen children. T. Wiedemann, "Mommsen, Rome, and the German ''Kaiserreich" 36–47, at 44, in Mommsen, ''A History of Rome under the Emperors'' (1992; 1996).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication==

===Original===

Originally the ''History'' was conceived as a five volume work, spanning [[History of the Roman Kingdom|Roman history]] from its inception to the emperor [[Diocletian]] (284–305). The first three volumes, which covered the origin of Rome through the fall of the Republic, ending with the reforms of Julius Caesar, were published in 1854, 1855, and 1856, as the ''Römische Geschichte''.&lt;ref&gt;Mommsen, ''Römische Geschichte'', 3 volumes (Leipzig: Reimer &amp; Hirsel 1854–1856). Although published in '''three''' volumes, this part of the ''History'' Mommsen organised into '''five''' "books".&lt;/ref&gt;

These three volumes did indeed become popular, very popular. "Their success was immediate." Here "a professional scholar" presented his readers with a prose that was of "such vigor and life, such grasp of detail combined with such vision, such self-confident mastery of a vast field of learning." Especially in Mommsen's third volume, as the narrative told of how the political crisis in the Roman Republic came to its final climax, "he wrote with a fire of imagination and emotion almost unknown in a professional history. Here was scientific learning with the stylistic vigor of a novel."&lt;ref&gt;Sauders &amp; Collins, "Introduction" 1–17, at 5–6, to their truncated edition of Mommsen, ''History of Rome'' (New Haven: Meridian Books 1958).&lt;/ref&gt;

These first three volumes of the ''Römische Geschichte'' retained their popularity in Germany, with eight editions being published in Mommsen's lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;W. P. Dickson, "Preface by the Translator" (1894) at v–x, viii, to Mommsen's ''A History of Rome'', volume one (1854; 1862; reprint by The Free Press/The Falcon's Wing Press, Glencoe IL, 1957).&lt;/ref&gt; Following his death in 1903, an additional eight German editions have issued.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Demandt, "Introduction" 1–35, at 1, in Mommsen, ''A History of Rome under the Emperors'' (London: Routledge 1996).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later volumes===

[[File:RomanEmpire 117.svg|thumb|right|250px|Provinces of the [[Roman Empire]], 117 A.D.]]

A planned fourth volume covering Roman history under the [[Roman Empire|Empire]] was delayed pending Mommsen's completion of a then 15-volume work on [[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum|Roman inscriptions]], which required his services as researcher, writer, and editor, occupying Mommsen for many years. After repeated delays the projected fourth volume was eventually abandoned, or at least not completed; an early manuscript may have been lost in a fire.&lt;ref&gt;The 1880 fire at Mommsen's home office, due to a gas explosion, has been proposed as the reason for no volume four, but Alexander Demandt dismisses it. A. Demandt, "Introduction" 1–35, at 7, 22–23, in Mommsen, ''A History of Rome under the Emperors'' (1992; London: Routledge 1996). There has been much scholarly discussion about the fate of the 'missing' fourth volume. Cf., A. Demandt, "Introduction" at 1–13 ("Why no volume IV?"), in Mommsen (1992; 1996). Cf., "Commentary" section here below.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1885, however, Mommsen had ready another work on ancient Rome, later translated into English as ''The Provinces of the Roman Empire''. In Germany it was published as the fifth volume of his ''Römische Geschichte''.&lt;ref&gt;Mommsen's fifth volume is subtitled ''Die Provinzen von Caesar bis Diokletian'' (Berlin: Weidmann 1885).&lt;/ref&gt; In thirteen chapters it describes the different imperial provinces, each as a stand-alone subject. Here there was no running narration of major Roman political events, often dramatic, as was the case in Mommsen's popular chronological telling of his earlier volumes.

In 1992,  a reconstruction of Mommsen's missing "fourth volume" on the Empire was issued.&lt;ref&gt;Theodore Mommsen, ''''Römische Kaisergeschichte'' (München: C.H.Beck'sche 1992), edited by B. and A. Demandt.&lt;/ref&gt; Its sources were lesson notes taken by two related students, Sebastian Hensel (father) and Paul Hensel (son), of lectures delivered by Prof. Mommsen during 1882–1886 regarding his courses on imperial Roman History, given at the [[University of Berlin]]. These student notes were 'discovered' in 1980 at a used bookshop in Nuremberg by [[Alexander Demandt]], then edited by Barbara Demandt and Alexander Demandt; the resulting German text was published in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;Theodore Mommsen, ''A History of Rome under the Emperors'' (London: Routledge 1996), edited by Demandt and Wiedemann; "Introduction" by A. Demandt at 1–35, 9–10, 13–14.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In English===

The contemporary English translations were the work of [[William Purdie Dickson]], then the [[Professor of Divinity (Glasgow)|Professor of Divinity]] at the [[University of Glasgow]]. The first three German volumes (which contained five 'books') were published during 1862 to 1866 by R. Bentley &amp; Son, London.&lt;ref&gt;Dickson's translation of Mommsen's first '''three''' volumes were published in '''four''' English volumes.&lt;/ref&gt; Over several decades Prof. Dickson prepared further English editions of this translation, keeping pace with Mommsen's revisions in German.&lt;ref&gt;Dickson, "Preface by the Translator" (1894) at viii, as published by Charles Scribners' Sons, New York, 1895.&lt;/ref&gt; All told, close to a hundred editions and reprints of the English translation have been published.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., as listed here by earliest date of the following publishers. London: R. Bentley (1862), J. M. Dent (1868), Macmillan (1894), Routledge/Thoemmes (1996). New York: C. Scribner (1866). Glencoe IL: The Free Press (1894).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mommsen's ''Römische Geschichte'' has been translated into many languages, following publication into Italian, French, English, Russian, Polish, and Spanish. ''New York Times'' obituary, "Prof. Mommsen is Dead" at page one (November 2, 1903). Relatively recently the first volume was translated into Chinese by Li Jianian and published by the Commercial Press, Beijing, 1994. T. Wiedemann and Wang Naixin, "Mommsen's ''Roman History''" in [http://www.dur.ac.uk/Classics/histos/1997/wiedemann.html ''Histos'', v.1 (April 1997)].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958 selections from the final two 'books' of the three-volume ''History'' were prepared by [[Dero A. Saunders]] and [[John H. Collins (academic)|John H. Collins]] for a shorter English version.&lt;ref&gt;Mommsen, ''History of Rome. An account of events and persons from the conquest of Carthage to the end of the Republic'' (New Haven CN: Meridian/Greenwich 1958), edited by Saunders and Collins. Text chosen from Mommsen's 'Book IV' and 'Book V'.&lt;/ref&gt; The content was chosen to highlight Mommsen's telling of the social-political struggles over several generations leading to the fall of the [[Roman Republic|Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;Concerning his writing here, Gooch opines: "Mommsen reaches full stride with Marius and Sulla, and portrays the dying struggles of the Republic with incomparable power and brilliance." Gooch (1913, 1928) at 456.&lt;/ref&gt; Provided with new annotations and a revised translation, the book presents an abridgment revealing the historical chronology. With rigor Mommsen is shown narrating the grave political drama and illuminating its implications; the book closes with his lengthy description of the new order of government adumbrated by Julius Caesar.&lt;ref&gt;Saunders and Collins in their edition of the ''History of Rome'' (1958), discuss their abridgement and their revision of the Dickson's translation, in the "Introduction" 1–17, at 12–15 and 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt;

With regard to Mommsen's 1885 "fifth volume" on the Roman provinces, Prof. Dr. Dickson immediate began to supervise its translation. In 1886 it appeared as ''The Provinces of the Roman Empire. From Caesar to Diocletian''.&lt;ref&gt;Also published by R. Bentley &amp; Son, London. The translation later was revised by F. Haverfield, evidently for a 1909 edition by Macmillan, London. See Haverfield's "Prefatory Note", included in the 1995 reprint by Barnes &amp; Noble, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mommsen's missing fourth volume was reconstructed from student notes and published in 1992 under the title ''Römische Kaisergeschichte''. It was soon translated into English by Clare Krojzl as ''A History of Rome under the Emperors''.&lt;ref&gt;Theodore Mommsen, ''A History of Rome under the Emperors'' (London: Routledge 1996), edited with an essay by Thomas Wiedemann, from the German edition by B. Demandt and A. Demandt, introduction by A. Demandt, translated by Clare Krojzl.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Review of contents==

===The Republic===

With exceptions, Mommsen in his ''Römische Geschichte'' (1854–1856) [[narration|narrates]] a straight chronology of historic events and circumstances. Often strongly worded, he carefully describes the political acts taken by the protagonists, demonstrates the immediate results, draws implications for the future, while shedding light on the evolving society that surround them. The chronology of the contents of his five 'books' (in his first three volumes) are in brief:

[[File:Maccari-Cicero.jpg|thumb|300px|right|[[Roman Senate]] ([[Cicero]] attacking [[Catilina]], 63 BCE). 19th-century fresco in [[Italian Senate]] at [[Palazzo Madama]].]]

*Book I, Roman origins and the [[Roman Kingdom|Monarchy]];
*Book II, the [[Roman Republic|Republic]] until the Union of Italy;
*Book III, the [[Punic Wars]] and the East;
*Book IV, the [[Gracchi]], [[Gaius Marius|Marius]], [[Marcus Livius Drusus (tribune)|Drusus]], and [[Sulla]];
*Book V, the [[Roman civil wars#Late Republic|Civil Wars]] and [[Julius Caesar]].

The broad strokes of Mommsen's long, sometimes intense narrative of the Roman Republic were summarized at the 1902 award of the Nobel Prize in a speech given by the secretary of the [[Swedish Academy]].&lt;ref&gt;Summary of Mommsen's book in the "Presentation Speech" by [[Carl David af Wirsén]], Permanent Secretary of the Swedish Academy, Stockholm, December 10, 1902. [http://www.nobelliterature.com Nobel Prize Literature List – 1902:Theodore Mommsen]. Af Wirsén was also a poet.&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning, the strength of Rome derived from the health of its families, e.g., a Roman's [[potestas|obedience]] to the state was associated with obedience of son to father.&lt;ref&gt;Mommsen, ''A History of Rome'' (1854–1856; 1862–1866; reprint 1957 by The Free Press) at I: 72–86 (Bk.I, ch.5 start). These social principles were not specific to Rome but held in common by all Latins.&lt;/ref&gt; From here Mommsen skillfully unrolls the huge canvas of Rome's long development from rural town to world capital. An early source of stability and effectiveness was the stubbornly preserved [[Political institutions of Ancient Rome|constitution]]; e.g., the reformed [[Roman Senate|Senate]] composed of [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patricians]] and [[plebeian]]s generally handled public affairs of the city-state in an honorable manner.&lt;ref&gt;Mommsen, ''A History of Rome'' (1854–1856; 1862–1866; reprint 1957 by The Free Press) at I: 410–412 (Bk.II, ch.3 end).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Roman constitution.png|thumb|left|180px|Outline of [[Constitution of the Roman Republic|Roman Constitution]].]]

Yet the great expansion of Rome and the consequent transformations worked to subvert the ancient order. Gradually, older institutions grew incapable of effectively meeting new and challenging circumstances, of performing the required civic tasks.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., Mommsen, ''A History of Rome'' (1854–1856; 1862–1866; reprint 1957 by The Free Press) at III: 35–63 (Bk.III, ch.XI second half), and 293–296 (Bk.IV, ch.1 end).&lt;/ref&gt; The purported sovereignty of the [[comitia]] (people's assembly) became only a fiction, which might be exploited by demagogues for their own purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Mommsen, ''A History of Rome'' (1854–1856; 1862–1866; reprint 1957 by The Free Press) at III: 57–63 (Bk.III, ch.11 end).&lt;/ref&gt; In the Senate, the old [[aristocracy|aristocratic]] [[oligarchy]] began to become corrupted by the enormous wealth derived from military conquest and its aftermath;&lt;ref&gt;Mommsen, ''A History of Rome'' (1854–1856; 1862–1866; reprint 1957 by The Free Press), e.g., at IV: 163–166 (Bk.IV, ch.11 begin/mid).&lt;/ref&gt; it no longer served well its functional purpose, it failed to meet new demands placed on Rome, and its members would selfishly seek to preserve inherited prerogatives against legitimate challenge and transition.&lt;ref&gt;For example, the reform regarding certain agricultural lands proposed separately by the [[Gracchi]], Tiberius (168–133) and Gaius (154–121), and similar reforms advanced by [[Marcus Livius Drusus (tribune)|Drusus]] (d.91). Mommsen, ''A History of Rome'' (1854–1856; 1862–1866; reprint 1957 by The Free Press) at III: 297–333, 334–370 (Bk.IV, ch.2 &amp; ch.3), and at III: 483–489 (Bk.IV, ch.6 end).&lt;/ref&gt; A frequently unpatriotic capitalism abused its power in politics and by irresponsible speculation. The free peasantry&lt;ref&gt;Mommsen's term. It included the poorer plebs.&lt;/ref&gt; became squeezed by the competing demands of powerful interests; accordingly its numbers began to dwindle, which eventually led to a restructuring of Army recruitment, and later resulted in disastrous consequences for the entire commonwealth.&lt;ref&gt;Mommsen, ''A History of Rome'' (1854–1856; 1862–1866; reprint 1957 by The Free Press) at III: 65–75, &amp; 96–97, 98–103 (Bk.III, ch.12 start &amp; end), at III: 305–309, 311–314 (Bk.IV, ch.2 mid start), and, e.g., at IV: 171–172 (Bk.IV, ch.11 mid).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sulla Glyptothek Munich 309.jpg|thumb|left|90px|[[Sulla]] bust in [[Munich]] [[Glyptothek]].]]

Moreover, the annual change of [[Roman consul|consul]]s (the two Roman chief executives) began to adversely impact the consistent management of its armed forces, and to weaken their effectiveness, especially in the era following the [[Punic War]]s. Eventually it led to the prolongation of military commands in the field; hence, [[Political history of the Roman military#From late Republic to mid-Roman Empire|Roman army generals]] became increasingly independent, and they led soldiers personally loyal to them.&lt;ref&gt;Due to population decline of the poorer plebeians and "free peasantry" in general, foreigners and landless [[proletarian|proletari]] had become eligible under [[Gaius Marius|Marius]] (157–86) to serve in the military. Their relatively weak state ties made them less likely to be as loyal to Roman politicians, but economic dependency encouraged their bonding with the commanding general, their paymaster. Mommsen, ''A History of Rome'' (1854–1856; 1862–1866; reprint 1957 by The Free Press) at III: 456–462 (Bk.IV, ch.6 near start), but compare at IV: 135–136 (Bk.IV, ch.10 mid/end).&lt;/ref&gt; These military leaders began to acquire the ability to rule better than the ineffective civil institutions. In short, the civil power's political capabilities were not commensurate with the actual needs of the Roman state. As Rome's strength and reach increased, the political situation developed in which an absolute command structure imposed by military leaders at the top might, in the long run, in many cases be more successful and cause less chaos and hardship to the [[Roman citizenship|citizenry]] than the corrupt and incompetent rule by the oligarchy of quarreling old families who ''de facto'' controlled the government.&lt;ref&gt;The several [[triumvirate]]s, during the last decades of the Republic, functioned in some regard as military [[Roman dictator|dictatorship]]s 'lite'. Cf., Mommsen, ''A History of Rome'' (1854–1856; 1862–1866; reprint 1957 by The Free Press) at IV: 378–385 (Bk.V, ch.3 mid), and at IV: 504–518 (Bk.V, ch.6 end), concerning the two triumvirates of Pompey, Cassus, and Caesar.&lt;/ref&gt; Such was his purpose when the conservative [[Optimate]], the noble and Roman general [[Sulla]] (138–78), seized state power by military force; yet he sought without permanent success to restore the Senate [[nobility]] to its former power.&lt;ref&gt;Among Roman generals who interfered with civil government: before Sulla, [[Gaius Marius|Marius]] (157–86) the commoner [[Populare]]; after Sulla, the commoner Optimate [[Pompey the Great]] (106–48), whose chief opponent became the noble Populare [[Julius Caesar]] (100–44).&lt;/ref&gt;

Political instability soon returned, social unrest being the disagreeable norm. The conservative renovation of the Republic's institutions was abandoned and taken apart. Eventually the decisive civil war victory of the incomparable [[Julius Caesar]] (100–44), followed by his executive mastery and public-minded reforms, appeared as the necessary and welcome step forward toward resolution of the sorry and bloody débâcle at Rome. This, in the dramatic narrative of Theodore Mommsen.&lt;ref&gt;Here ends the rendering of contents taken from af Wirsén's "Presentation Speech" per the 1902 Nobel Prize, regarding Mommsen's ''Römische Geschichte'' (1854–1856), translated as ''A History of Rome'' (1862–1866).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A similar though longer review of the contents of the ''Roman History'' was earlier provided by W. P. Allen, "Theodor Mommsen" at 445–465, in the ''North American Review'', v.112 (1870).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For discussion of a contrary response to Mommsen, e.g. his portrayal of Julius Caesar, see "Commentary" section here below.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mommsen's penultimate chapter provides an outline of the 'nation building' program begun by Caesar following his victory. Institutions were reformed, the many regions ruled by Rome became more unified in design, as if prepared for a future Empire which would endure for centuries; this, during Caesar's last five and a half years alive. His work at statecraft included the following: the slow pacification of party strife, nonetheless with republican opposition latent and episodically expressed; his assumption of the title [[Imperator]] (refusing the crown, yet continuing since 49 as [[Roman dictator|dictator]]), with reversion of the Senate to an advisory council, and the popular [[comitia]] as a compliant legislature, although law might be made by his [[edicts]] alone; his assumption of authority over tax and treasury, over provincial governors, and over the capital; supreme [[jurisdiction]] (trial and appellate) over the continuing republican legal system, with the [[Iudex|judex]] being selected among senators or [[equites]], yet criminal courts remained corrupted by factional infighting; supreme command over the decayed [[Roman army]], which was reorganized and which remained under civilian control; reform of government finance, of budgeting re income and expense, and of corn distribution; cultivation of civil peace in Rome by control of criminal "clubs", by new city police, and by public building projects.&lt;ref&gt;Mommsen, ''The History of Rome'' (1854–1856; 1862–1866; reprint by The Free Press 1957) at V: 315–377 (Bk.V, ch.11).&lt;/ref&gt; Impossible problems: widespread [[Roman slavery|slavery]], disappearance of family farms, extravagance and immorality of the wealthy, dire poverty, speculation, debt; Caesar's reforms: favoring families, against absentees, [[Sumptuary law|restricting luxuries]], debt relief (but not cancellation as demanded by ''populares''), personal [[bankruptcy]] for unpayable debt replacing enslavement by creditors, [[usury]] laws, road building, distribution of public agricultural lands in a moderated [[Gracchi|Gracchan]] fashion, and new [[Municipal government|municipal law]]. Mommsen writes, "[W]e may well conclude that Caesar with his reforms came as near to the measure of what was possible as it was given to a statesman and a Roman to come."&lt;ref&gt;Mommsen, ''The History of Rome'' (1854–1856; 1862–1866; reprint by The Free Press 1957) at V: 377–406 (Bk.V, ch.11), quote at 406.&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding the [[Roman provinces]], former misrule and financial plundering is described, committed by Roman government agents and Roman merchants; Caesar's reforms replaced the quasi-independent Roman governors with those selected by the Imperator and closely supervised, with reduction in taxes; provincial oppression by private concerns was found more difficult to arrest. Abatement of the prior popular notion of the provinces as "country estates" to be worked or exploited for Rome's benefit. Favors granted Jews; Latin colonies continue. Cultural joining of Latins and [[Greek people|Hellenes]]; "Italy was converted from the mistress of subject peoples into the mother of the renovated Italo-Hellenic nation." Census of the Mediterranean population under Rome taken; popular religion left free of additional state norms. Continuing development of the [[Praetor's Edict]], and plans for a codification of law. [[Roman coinage]], weights and measures reformed; creation of the [[Julian Calendar]]. "The rapidity and self-precision with which the plan was executed prove that it had been long meditated thoroughly and all its parts settled in detail", Mommsen comments. "[T]his was probably the meaning of the words which were heard to fall from him—that he had 'lived enough'."&lt;ref&gt;Mommsen, ''The History of Rome'' (1854–1856; 1862–1866; reprint by The Free Press 1957) at V: 406–442 (Bk.V, ch.11), quotations at 427 and 442. Six centuries later the law codification occurred under [[Justinian]] (r.527–565), at 434–435.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Another scholar conjectures that Mommsen must have considered the assassination of Julius Caesar "an incalculable disaster." W. P. Allen, "Theodor Mommsen" in the ''North American Review'' (1870) at 112: 445–465, at 456.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mommsen's expertise in Roman studies was acknowledged by his peers as being both wide and deep, e.g., his direction of the [[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum|ancient Latin inscriptions]] project,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum]]'' (1867 and continuing), which under his editorship grew to 40 folio volumes occupying eight feet of shelf. W. Warde Fowler, ''Roman essays and interpretations'' (Oxford Univ. 1920), "Theodore Mommsen: His life and work" 250–268, at 261–262.&lt;/ref&gt; his work on ancient dialects of Italy,&lt;ref&gt;Mommsen, ''Die unteritalischen Dialekte'' (Leipzig: Weidmann 1850). Mommsen helped show that [[Latin]] and other [[Italic languages]] were ''sister'' languages to ancient [[Greek language|Greek]], which was fatal to the [[Pelasgian]] theory favored by [[Barthold Georg Niebuhr|Niebuhr]]. W. P. Allen, "Theodor Mommsen" 445–465, at 446, in the ''North American Review'', v.112 (1870).&lt;/ref&gt; the journal he began devoted to Roman coinage,&lt;ref&gt;''Zeitschrift für Numismatik''; plus Mommsen's own large volume on ancient Roman coinage, ''Über das Römische Münzwesen'' (1850). From coins, standard weights, and the alphabet used by ancient Romans, Mommsen argued that their primary influence was [[Greek civilization]], not [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]]. W. P. Allen, "Theodor Mommsen" 445–465, at 448, in the ''North American Review'', v.112 (1870).&lt;/ref&gt; his multivolume ''Staatsrecht'' on the long [[Roman constitution|history of constitutional law]] at Rome,&lt;ref&gt;Mommsen, ''Römisches Staatsrecht'', 3 volumes (Leipzig: Hirzel 1871–1876, 3d ed. 1887).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gooch calls Mommsen's ''Staatsrecht'' "the greatest historical treatise on political institutions ever written." ''History and Historians in the Nineteenth Century'' (1913, 1928) at 460.&lt;/ref&gt; his volumes on Roman criminal law, the ''Strafrecht''.&lt;ref&gt;Mommsen, ''Römisches Strafrecht'', 3 volumes (Leipzig: Duncker and Humblot 1899).&lt;/ref&gt; His bibliography lists 1500 works.&lt;ref&gt;Fritz Stern, ''The Varieties of History'' (Cleveland: World/Meridian 1956) at 191.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A Mommsen bibliography prepared by Zangemeister in 1887 lists 920 items. "Nobel Prize Presentation Speech" [re Mommsen] given by af Wirsén (Stockholm, December 10, 1902).&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Provinces===

The ''Provinces of the Roman Empire'' (1885, 1886) contains thirteen chapters, namely: Northern Italy, Spain, [[Gaul]], Germany, Britain, the Danube, Greece, [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]], the Euphrates and [[Parthia]], Syria and the [[Nabataeans]], Judaea, Egypt, and the [[Africa province]]s. Generally, each chapter describes the economic geography of a region and its people, before addressing its Imperial regime. Regarding the North, military administration is often stressed; while for the East, the culture and history.

A quarter of the way into his short "Introduction" to the ''Provinces'' Mommsen comments on the decline of Rome, the capital city: "The Roman state of this epoch resembles a mighty tree, the main stem of which, in the course of its decay, is surrounded by vigorous offshoots pushing their way upward."&lt;ref&gt;Mommsen, ''The Province of the Roman Empire'' (Leipzig 1865; London 1866; London: Macmillan 1909; reprint New York 1996) at 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt; These shoots being the provinces he here describes.

===The Empire===

[[File:Rome-Capitole-StatueConstantin.jpg|90px|thumb|right|[[Constantine I|Constantine]] (272–337).]]

Mommsen's missing fourth volume, as reconstructed by Barbara Demandt and [[Alexander Demandt]] from lecture notes, was published as ''Römische Kaisergeschichte'' in 1992. Thus appearing many years after third volume (1856), and the fifth (1885). It contains three sections of roughly equal size.

The first section is arranged chronologically by emperor: Augustus (44 BC-AD 14); Tiberius (14–37); Gaius Caligula (37–41); Claudius (41–54); Nero (54–68); The Year of Four Emperors (68–69); Vespasian (69–79).

The chapters of the second section are entitled: General Introduction; Domestic Politics I; Wars in the West; Wars on the Danube; Wars in the East; Domestic Politics II.

The third section: General Introduction; Government and Society; A History of Events [''this the longest subsection, arranged by emperors'']: Diocletian (284–305); Constantine (306–337); The sons of Constantine (337–361); Julian and Jovian (355–364); Valentinian and Valens (364–378); From Theodosius to Alaric (379–410).&lt;ref&gt;Theodore Mommsen, ''''Römische Kaisergeschichte'' (München: C.H.Beck'sche 1992), edited by Barbara and Alexander Demandt; translated by Clare Krojzl as ''A History of Rome under the Emperors'' (London: Routledge 1996), edited by Thomas Wiedemann from German edition by B. and A. Demandt, essay by T. Wiedemann, introduction by A. Demandt.&lt;/ref&gt;

This rescued work contains a great wealth of material, in which one follows in the footsteps of a master historian. Yet, perhaps because of its nature as reconstructed student lecture notes, it more often lacks the fine points of literary composition and style, and of course the narrative drive of the original three volumes.&lt;ref&gt;See here above, "Publication" at "Original".&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless it is well to remember that the students involved here in taking the lecture notes were themselves quite accomplished people, and one listener and recorder was already a mature father.&lt;ref&gt;See here above subsection "Later volumes" at ''Nota Bene''. Alexander Demandt, "Introduction" 1–35, at 14–17, in Mommsen, ''A History of Rome under the Emperors'' (1992; 1996).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roman Portraits==

Several writers have remarked on Mommsen's ability to interpret personality and character.&lt;ref&gt;"Presentation Speech" by Carl David af Wirsén, of the Swedish Academy, Stockholm, December 10, 1902. Mentioned in particular were: Hannibal, Scipio Africanus, Gaius Gracchus, Marius, Sulla, and Caesar. [http://www.nobelliterature.com Nobel Prize Literature List – 1902:Theodore Mommsen]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[W. Warde Fowler]], however, in his ''Roman essays and interpretations'' (Oxford University 1920), "Theodor Mommsen: His life and work" 250–268, at 259, writes that Mommsen went astray in judging Pompey and Caesar, Cicero and Cato.&lt;/ref&gt; The following highlights are drawn from Mommsen's renderings of figures of ancient Rome, namely: Hannibal, Scipio Africanus, the Gracchi brothers, Marius, Drusus, Sulla, Pompey, Cato, Caesar, and Cicero.

[[File:Mommsen p265.jpg|thimb|right|120px|Bust, said to be of Hannibal.]]
* [[Hannibal Barca]] (247–183). Of [[History of Punic era Tunisia|Carthage]], not of Rome, in fact a sworn enemy of Rome, as the Roman people became acquainted with him. No [[Punic]] writer has left us an account of him, but only his 'enemies' whether Greek or Roman. Mommsen tells us, "the Romans charged him with cruelty, the Carthaginians with covetousness." It is "true that he hated" and knew "how to hate" and that "a general who never fell short of money and stores can hardly have been less than covetous. But though anger and envy and meanness have written his history, they have not been able to mar the pure and noble image which it presents." His father [[Hamilcar Barca|Hamilcar]] served Carthage as an army general; Hannibal's "youth had been spent in the camp." As a boy on horseback he'd become "a fearless rider at full speed." In his father's army he had performed "his first feats of arms under the paternal eye". In [[Hispania]] his father spent years building colonies for Carthage from which to attack Rome; but the son saw his father "fall in battle by his side." Under his brother-in-law [[Hasdrubal the Fair|Hasdrubal]], Hannibal led cavalry with bravery and brilliance; then Hasdrubal was assassinated. By "the voice of his comrades" Hannibal at 29 years took command of the army. "[A]ll agree in this, that he combined in rare perfection discretion and enthusiasm, caution and energy." His "inventive craftiness" made him "fond of taking singular and unexpected routes; ambushes and stratagems of all sorts were familiar to him." He carefully studied the Roman character. "By an unrivalled system of espionage—he had regular spies even in Rome—he kept himself informed of the projects of his enemy." He was often seen in disguise. Yet nothing he did at war "may not be justified under the circumstances, and according to the international law, of the times." "The power which he wielded over men is shown by his incomparable control over an army of various nations and many tongues—an army which never in the worst of times mutinied against him." Following the war Hannibal the statesman served Carthage to reform the city-state's constitution; later as an exile he exercised influence in the eastern Mediterranean. "He was a great man; wherever he went, he riveted the eyes of all."&lt;ref&gt;Mommsen, ''A History of Rome'' (1854–1856), translated by Dickson (1862–1866), as reprinted by The Free Press (1957), II: 243–245 (Bk.III, ch.VI early mid). His father Hamilcar: II: 236–239. His oath against Rome: II: 238 and 483 (Bk.III, ch.IX end). As civic leader: II: 378–379 (Bk.III, ch.VII early mid). Exile in the East: II: 449, 451, 454 (Bk. III, ch.IX near start).&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Scipio Africanus]] (235–183). His father a Roman general died at war in Hispania; years earlier his son Publius Cornelius Scipio (later Africanus) had saved his life. As then no one offered to succeed to his father's post, the son offered himself. The people's [[comitia]] accepted the son for the father, "all this made a wonderful and indelible impression on the citizens and farmers of Rome." Publius Scipio "himself enthusiastic" about others, accordingly "inspired enthusiasm." The [[Roman Senate]] acquiesqued to the mere [[military tribune]] serving in place of a [[praetor]] or [[consul]], i.e., his father. "He was not one of the few who by their energy and iron will constrain the world to adopt and to move in new paths for centuries, or who at any rate grasp the reins of destiny for years till its wheels roll over them." Though he won battles and conquored nations, and became a prominent statesman at Rome, he was not an Alexander or a Caesar. "Yet a special charm lingers around the form of that graceful hero; it is surrounded, as if with a dazzling halo... in which Scipio with mingled credulity and adroitness always moved." His enthusiasm warmed the heart, but he did not forget the vulgar, nor fail to follow his calculations. "[N]ot naïve enough to share the belief of the multitude in his inspirations... yet in secret thoroughly persuaded that he was a man specially favored of the gods." He would accept merely to be an ordinary king, but yet the Republic's constitution applied even to heroes such as him. "[S]o confident of his own greatness that he knew nothing of envy or of hatred, [he] courteously acknowledged other men's merits, and compassionately forgave other men's faults." After his war-ending victory over Hannibal at [[Battle of Zama|Zama]], he was called ''Africanus''. He was an excellent army officer, a refined diplomat, an accomplished speaker, combining Hellenic culture with Roman. "He won the hearts of soldiers and of women, of his countrymen and of the Spaniards, of his rivals in the [[Roman senate|senate]] and of his greater Carthaginian antagonist. His name was soon on every one's lips, and his was the star which seemed destined to bring victory and peace to his country." Yet his nature seemed to contain "strange mixtures of genuine gold and glittering tinsel." It was said he set "the fashion to the nobility in arogance, title-hunting, and client-making." In his politics Scipio Africanus "sought support for his personal and almost dynastic opposition to the senate in the multitude." No demagogue, however, he remained content to merely be "the first burgess of Rome".&lt;ref&gt;Mommsen (1854–56; 1957) II: 324–327 (Bk.III, ch.VI mid), 483 (Bk.III, ch.IX end); III: 61 (Bk.III, ch.XI near end).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tiberius Gracchus.jpg|thumb|120px|[[Tiberius Gracchus]].]]

* [[Tiberius Gracchus]] (163–133). His maternal grandfather was Scipio Africanus. His father [[Tiberius Gracchus Major]] was twice consul, a powerful man at his death in 150. The young widow [[Cornelia Africana]] "a highly cultivated and notable woman" declined marriage to an Egyptian king to raise her children. She was "a highly cultivated and notable woman".&lt;ref&gt;Mommsen, ''History of Rome'' (1854–56; reprint: The Free Press 1957) at III: 318 (Bk.IV, ch.III mid). Cornelia Africana enjoyed literary celebrity in Roman culture. &lt;blockquote&gt;"The collection of letters by Cornelia, the mother of the Gracchi, was remarkable partly for the classical purity of the language and the high spirit of the writer, partly as the first correspondence published in Rome, and as the first literary production of a Roman lady."&lt;/blockquote&gt; Mommsen (1854–56; 1957) at IV: 250 (Bk.IV, ch.XIII near end).&lt;/ref&gt; Her eldest son Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus "in all his relations and views... belonged to the [[Scipionic circle]]" sharing its "refined and thorough culture" which was both [[Classics|''Greek'' and ''Roman'']]. Tiberius "was of a good and moral disposition, of gentle aspect and quiet bearing, apparently fitted for anything rather than for an agitator of the masses." At that time political reform was widely discussed among aristocrats; yet the [[Roman senate|senate]] always avoided it. Tiberius declared for reform. Perhaps he was personally motivated by an incident as [[Quaestor|questor]] with the Army on campaign in Hispania: there he had escaped a terrible ordeal because of his elite connections. Reformist ideals of this "young, upright and proud man" were nourished by Hellenic [[rhetoric]]ians. "[W]hen his intentions became known... there was no want of approving voices, and many a public placard summoned the grandson of Africanus to think of the poor people and the deliverance of Italy." In 134 he became a [[tribune]] of the people. "The fearful consequences of the previous misgovernment, the political, military, economic, and moral decay of the burgesses, were just at that time naked and open to the eyes of all. ... So Gracchus immediately after entering on office, proposed the enactment of an agrarian law." The land reform was to benefit small holders, to restore prosperity to the "free farmers" of Italy; it concerned rural state lands ''de facto'' long held in the possession of wealthy families both of Rome and of Latin allies. His proposed law seemed to garner senate support, but it was effectively vetoed by another tribune acting on behalf of powerful Roman landowners; twice his bill was vetoed. Tiberius Gracchus then turned to the [[comitia|people's assembly]], which deposed the offending tribune and itself passed the land reform law.&lt;ref&gt;Mommsen (1854–56; 1957) at III: 317–318, 319–320, 321–323 (Bk.IV, ch.III mid).&lt;/ref&gt;

: [[File:Halle CorneliaMotherOfTheCracchi.jpg|thumb|left|90px|[[Cornelia Africana|Cornelia]] &amp; her children: Tiberius &amp; Gaius Gracchus, &amp; eldest Sempronia.]]

: "Rome about this period was governed by the [[Roman senate|senate]]. Anyone who carried a measure of administration against the majority of the senate made a revolution. It was revolution against the spirit of the constitution, when Gracchus submitted the domain question to the people; and revolution also against... the tribunician veto." Too, the people's assembly was a great tumultuous crowd and unfit to pass legislation. Yet senate governance had become so corrupt that a person who would replace it "might benefit the commonwealth more than he injured it. ¶ But such a bold player Tiberius Gracchus was not. He was a tolerably capable, thoroughly well-meaning, conservative patriot, who simply did not know what he was doing." Angry aristocrats from the senate caught and clubbed to death Gracchus; 300 other reformers died with him. The senate then closed ranks, saying that Tiberius Gracchus "had wished to seize the crown."&lt;ref&gt;Mommsen (1854–56; 1957) at III: 329–331, 333; 325–327 (Bk.IV, ch.II end).&lt;/ref&gt;

: Yet the land commission mandated by the reform law of Tiberius was allowed to meet and for several years managed to substantially increase the number of small farmers who owned their own land. [[Scipio Aemilianus]] (184–129), an in-law and adopted grandson of Scipio Africanus and thus cousin to the Gracchi, played an ambiguous rôle. A good soldier, fine orator, trustworty, and known for steadfast probity, his politics put him in between the aristocracy and the reformers. Against the oligarchy he brought the ballot to criminal proceedings before popular tribunals. Yet he mostly opposed land reforms; "rightly or wrongly, the remedy seemed to him worse than the disease." Eventually on behalf of allied Latin landowners he influenced the termination of the land commission. As a result he, too, was assassinated—probably by a land reformer.&lt;ref&gt;Adopted as Publius Cornelius Scipio Aemilianus Africanus. Mommsen, ''History of Rome'' (1854–56; reprint 1957) at III: 314–317, 327, 331–332, 334, 337–339 (Bk.IV, ch.II mid to end &amp; ch.III start).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gaius Gracchus Tribune of the People.jpg|thumb|140px|[[Gaius Gracchus]] before the [[Concilium Plebis]].]]

* [[Gaius Gracchus]] (154–121). Gaius was the younger brother of Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus, and the second son of [[Cornelia Africana]]. Gaius set himself the project of reforming the constitutional order of the Senate and People of Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Mommsen (1854–56; 1957) III: 334–337, 342–344 (Bk.IV, ch.III start); 349, 353–361; 366–370 (Bk.IV, ch.III end).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Marius Glyptothek Munich 319.jpg|thumb|right|100px|[[Gaius Marius]]. Bust in [[Glyptothek]] at [[Munich]].]]

* [[Gaius Marius]] (157–86). "Son of a poor day-labourer" in an Italian village, Marius was "reared at the plough". He joined the army as soon as he could. Noted for his ability and fine appearance, he served during campaigns in Hispania and by age 23 became an officer. Back home, he planned an army career, but regardless of merit he "could not attain those political offices, which alone led to the higher military posts, without wealth and without connections. The young officer acquired both by fortunate commercial speculations and by his union with a maiden of the ancient [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] clan of the Julii." In 115 he served as [[praetor]] and in 107 as [[consul]]. In Africa he then led an army; serving under him was Sulla, who captured [[Jugurtha]] which ended the war. Again Marius became consul, for an unprecedented four consecutive terms (104–101), during which in Germania he led an army to victory. "[A] brave and upright man, who administered justice impartially", he was "uncorruptable." "[A] skillful organizer... an able general, who kept the soldier under discipline [and] at the same time won his affections... [Marius] looked the enemy boldly in the face and joined issue with him at the proper time." Not a man of "eminent military capacity", he enjoyed "the reputation for such capacity."&lt;ref&gt;Mommsen, ''The History of Rome'' (1854–56; reprint: The Free Press 1957) at III: 452–453 (Bk.IV, ch.VI start).&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;blockquote&gt;"[Marius took a place] of unparalelled honour among the consulars and the [[Roman triumph|triumphators]]. But he was none the better fitted on that account for the brilliant circle. His voice remained harsh and loud, and his look wild, as if he still saw before him Libyans or Cimbrians, and not well-bred and perfumed colleagues. ... [H]is want of political culture was unpardonable... what was to be thought of a consul who was so ignorant of constitutional etiquette as to appear in triumphal costume in the senate! In other respects too the [[plebeian]] character clung to him. He was not merely—according to aristocratic phraseology—a poor man, but, what was worse, frugal, and a declared enemy of all bribery and corruption. After the manner of soldiers he was not nice, but was fond of his cups... he knew not the art of giving feasts, and kept a bad cook. It was likewise awkward that the consular understood nothing but Latin and declined conversation in Greek. ... Thus he remained throughout his life a countryman cast adrift among aristocrats."&lt;ref&gt;Mommsen (1854–56; 1957) at III: 453–454 (Bk.IV, ch.VI near start).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

: Marius, "a farmer by birth and a soldier by inclination", started out as no revolutionary. Yet the "hostile attacks of the aristocracy had no doubt driven him subsequently into the camp of [their] opponents" where "he speedily found himself elevated" as the new popular leader. "[T]he men of quality acknowledged his services" in gaining crucial military victories. Yet "with the people he was more popular than any one before or after him, popular alike by his virtues and by his faults, by his unaristocratic disinterestedness no less than by his boorish roughnesss; he was called by the multitude a third [[Romulus]]." Meanwhile, "the wretched government oppressed the land more heavily than did the barbarians." On Marius, "the first man of Rome, the favorite of the people... devolved the task of once more delivering Rome." His "sensuous passion" was stirred. Yet to this rustic and soldier "the political proceedings of the capital were strange and incongruous: he spoke ill as he commanded well." Firmer he was "in the presence of lances and swords" that amid "applause and hisses". "[I]f he would not deceive the expectations of his party" and "if he would not be unfaithful to his own sense of duty, he must check the maladministration of public affairs."&lt;ref&gt;Mommsen (1854–56; 1957) at III: 454–456 (Bk.IV, ch.VI near start); IV: 274 (Bk.V, ch.I early mid).&lt;/ref&gt;

: Yet his efforts at social reform would end very badly. "He knew neither the art of gaining his antagonists, nor that of keeping his own party in subjection." He stirred the [[proletariat]] to unworthy acts beyond the law; although he nobly shrank from the excess, he accepted the results. Once popular, a "gallant man", he slowly came to be seen in a different light, as a "laughing-stock". Later, during his seventh consulship in 86, many of his political opponents were murdered. "He had taken vengeance on the whole genteel pack that embittered his victories and envenomed his defeats". Regretfully Marius at last emerged as "the crackbrained chief of a reckless band of robbers" which earned him "the hatred of the entire nation".&lt;ref&gt;Mommsen (1854–56; 1957) at III: 472 (Bk.VI, ch.IV mid); IV: 68 (Bk.I, ch.VI early mid). Cf., III: 467–478; and, IV: 60–69.&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Marcus Livius Drusus (tribune)|Livius Drusus]] (d.91). His father of the same name, acting as tribune but on behalf of the Senate, had sponsored rival programs and "caused the overthrow of Gaius Gracchus." The son also held "strictly conservative views." "He belonged to the circle of the highest nobility and possessed a colossal fortune; in disposition too he was a genuine aristocrat—a man emphatically proud." Yet he followed "the beautiful saying, that nobility implies obligation." He had in earnest turned away from the "frivolity" common to elite society. "[T]rustworthy and strict in morals, he was respected rather than properly beloved" by the common people, "to whom his door and his purse were always open." Later he became [[tribune]]; as political events unfolded Drusus became less an antagonist and more the disciple of the late Gaius Gracchus. He championed reforms to remedy the corruption in the courts caused by [[equite]] merchants (who then acted as the [[iudex|judex]]); to this reform he added the grant of Roman citizenship to Italians. After the apparent victory of these reforms in the [[Roman senate|senate]], followed by their repeal, while yet vigorous he was murdered. Following his death the [[Social War (91-88 BC)|Social War]] started throughout Italy over citizenship rights.&lt;ref&gt;Mommsen, ''A History of Rome'' (1854–56; 1957) III: 483–484, 486–489 (Bk.IV, ch.VI end); 497–498 (Bk.IV, ch.VII near start).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hw-pompey.jpg|thumb|right|110px|[[Pompey]]. Bust, [[Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek]], [[Copenhagen]].]]

* [[Pompeius Magnus]] (106–48). His father was [[Pompeius Strabo]], a consul who earned a [[Roman triumph|triumph]] in the [[Social War (91–88 BC)|Social War]]. Pompey himself came into great public prominence during his 20s under the rule of Sulla. He was neither an "unconditional adherent" nor an "open opponent" of Sulla, who "half in recognition, half in irony" first called Pompey 'the Great'. Sound in body and mind, a good athlete, a skilled rider and fencer, the youthful Pompey had won extraordinary military honors and public acclaim. "Unhappily, his mental endowments by no means corresponded with these unprecedented successes. He was neither a bad nor an incapable man, but a man thoroughly ordinary." An "excellent soldier", he was "without trace of any higher gifts." As commander Pompey was cautious and delivered "the decisive blow only when he had established an immense superiority". "His integrity was of a rich man... too rich to incur special risks, or draw down on himself conspicuous disgrace". His reputation for "integrity and disinterestness" came less from his virtue than from a senate rife with vice. Yet as a landowner he was fair-minded; he did not join "revolting schemes in which the grandess of that age" expanded their domains by infringing on their "humbler neighbors". A good man, "he displayed attachment to his wife and children." He was "the first to depart from the barbarous custom of putting to death the captive kings" of countries fighting Rome. "His 'honest countenance' became almost proverbial." Yet at Sulla's command Pompey quit his beloved wife and then later ordered the execution of soldiers loyal to him, all due to Sulla and politics. He was not cruel, but he was cold. A shy man, "he spoke in public not without embarrassment; and generally was angular, stiff, and awkward in intercourse." "For nothing was he less qualified than for a statesman." His aims uncertain, unable to decide on means, short sighted, "he was wont to conceal his irresolution and indecision under a cloak of solemn silence." He often would "deceive himself that he was deceiving others." Like Marius, "Pompeius was in every respect incapable of leading and keeping together a [political] party."&lt;ref&gt;Mommsen (1854–56; 1957) IV: 271–273 (Bk.V, ch.I late start).&lt;/ref&gt;

: His exalted social position also remained fundamentally ambivalent. Allied to the aristocracy by his consular ancestry and through Sulla, he disliked Sulla personally and worked against the Sullan constitution, and his family [[gens]] was of recent vintage and not fully accepted by the nobility. Pompey maintained links to the [[Populares]] and joined Caesar in the [[triumvirate]]. Yet, to the contrary, he was well suited to associate with the [[Roman senate|senate]] oligarchy because his "dignified outward appearance, his solemn formality, his personal bravery, his decorous private life, his want of all initiative" and his "mediocrity, so characteristic of the genuine [[Optimate]]". An "affinity" existed, "subsisted at all times between Pompeius, [the] burgesses and the senate." Pompeius, however, refused to fit in. "[S]eized with giddiness on the height of glory which he had climbed with dangerous rapidity and ease", he began to compare himself to [[Alexander the Great]], and far above any senator. "His political position was utterly perverse." He was conflicted; "deeply indignant when persons and laws did not bend unconditionally before him" he nonetheless "trembled at the mere thought of doing anything unconstitutional." His "much agitated life passed joylessly away in a perpetual inward contradition." Pompey for Mommsen was the "most tiresome and most starched of all artificial great men." He died before his wife and son, when one of his old soldiers stabbed him from behind as he stepped ashore in Egypt. "Of all pitiful parts there is none more pitiful than that of passing for more than one really is."&lt;ref&gt;Mommsen (1854–56; 1957) IV: 274–275 (Bk.V, ch.I late start); V: 272–273 (Bk.V, ch.X early end).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Silver denarius of Cato 47 46 BCE.jpg|thumb|130px|[[Cato Uticensis]]. Silver [[denarius]] issued 47-46.]]

* [[Cato Uticensis]] (95–46). His mother's brother was the reformer Livius Drusus. His father's grandfather was the famous [[Roman censor|censor]], [[Cato the Elder]] (234–149). Here, Cato (also called 'the Younger') was a rare man among the aristocracy, "a man of the best intentions and of rare devotedness", yet Quixotic and cheerless. Although honourable, steadfast, earnest, and strongly attached "to country and to its hereditary constitution" he possessed little practical understanding. Cato, "dull in intellect and sensuously as well as morally destitute of passion", might have made "a tolerable state accountant." Walking "in the sinful capital as a model [[citizen]] and mirror of virtue" he would 'scold' those out of line. His ancestor Cato the Elder worked as a farmer, his anger had made him an orator; wielder of plough and sword, in politics "his narrow, but original and sound common sense ordinarily hit the nail on the head." The younger Cato, however, inspired by the example of his great-grandfather, made a "strange caricature" of him. Formal and philosophical, a follower of the [[Stoicism|Stoa]], the younger Cato would speak in "scholastic wisdom" and appeared as "this cloud-walker in the realm of abstract morals." Yet like his ancestor, he began "to travel on foot instead of riding, to take no [[interest]], to decline badges of distinction as a soldier", and like the legendary king [[Romulus]] to appear shirtless. In "an utterly wretched and cowardly age his courage and his negative virtues told powerfully with the multitude." As "the only conservative of note who possessed if not talent and insight, at any rate integrity and courage... he soon became the champion of the [[Optimate]] party." He never missed a [[Roman senate|senate]] meeting, and "as long as he lived he checked the details of the public budget." Yet unfortunately in politics he simply lacked common sense. Cato's tactics seemed to consist of nothing more than "setting his face against every one who deviated" from the traditional catechism of the aristocracy, which of course worked as much against the Optimates as for them. By his character and his actions this "Don Quixote of the aristocracy" proved the exhaustion of senate politics.&lt;ref&gt;Mommsen (1854–56; 1957) IV: 454–455 (Bk.V, ch.V near start). [[Cato the Elder]]: III: 45–47 (Bk.III, ch.XI late middle).&lt;/ref&gt;

: After Caesar's victory at [[Battle of Thapsus|Thapsus]] ending the civil war, Cato tended to the welfare of the republican remnant at [[Utica, Tunisia|Utica]], then took his own life by the sword. "Cato was anything but a great man." Yet he was the only man who "honourably and courageously championed in the last struggle the great [[Roman Republic|republican]] system doomed to destruction." "Cato has played a greater part in history than many men far superior to him in intellect. It only heightens the deep and tragic significance of his death that he was himself a fool; in truth it is just because Don Quixote is a fool that he is a tragic figure." Yet Cato inspired the republican protest against Caesar's victory, which "tore asunder like gossamer all that so-called constitutional character with which Caesar invested his monarchy", and exposed as hypocritical "the reconciliation of all parties" under the Empire. "The unrelenting warfare which the ghost of the legitimate republic waged for centuries" against the Empire, from [[Gaius Cassius Longinus|Cassius]] and [[Marcus Junius Brutus the Younger|Brutus]] to [[Thrasea]] and [[Tacitus]], "a warfare of plots and of literature" was Cato's legacy. Soon after his death this "republican opposition" began to "revere as a saint" Cato who in life was frequently a "laughing-stock" and a "scandal". "But the greatest of these marks of respect was the involuntary homage which Caesar rendered to him, when he made an exception in the contemptuous clemency" he offered defeated opponents. Cato alone he pursued even beyond the grave "with that energetic hatred which practical statesmen are wont to feel toward antagonists opposing them from a region of ideas which they regard as equally dangerous and impracticable."&lt;ref&gt;Mommsen, ''A History of Rome'' (1854–56; 1957) V: 299–300, 302–304 (Bk.V, ch.X near end).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:M-T-Cicero.jpg|thumb|110px|[[Cicero]], copy by [[Bertel Thorvaldsen]], Copenhagen.]]

* [[Tullius Cicero]] (106–43). An opportunist, "accostomed to flirt at times with the democrats, at times... with the aristocracy, and to lend his services as an advocate to every influential man under impeachment without distinction of person or party". Wealth and commerce were then "dominant in the courts" and the lawyer Cicero had made himself well accomplished as "the eloquent pleader" and "the courtly and witty champion." He was not an aristocrat, but a [[novus homo]]; he belonged to no party, but cultivated connections enough among both [[optimate]]s and [[populare]]s. Elected [[consul]] in 63, he ducked legal responsibility in the [[Catilina]] conspiracy. "As a statesman without insight, idea, or purpose, Cicero figured successively as democrat, as aristocrat, and as a tool of the [[triumvirate]], and was never more than a short-sighted egoist." "He was valiant in opposition to sham attacks, and he knocked down many walls of pasteboard with a loud din; no serious matter was ever, either in good or evil, decided by him". In [[Latin]], "his importance rests on his mastery of style". Yet as an author, he was "a dabbler", a "journalist in the worst sense of that term", and "poor beyond all conception in ideas". His letters "reflect the urban or villa life of the world of quality" yet remain in essence "stale and empty". As an orator "Cicero had no conviction and no passion; he was nothing but an advocate". He published his court pleadings; his [[Eloquence|orations]] can be "easy and agreeable reading." He used anecdote to excite sentimentality, "to enliven the dry business" of law "by cleverness or witticisms mostly of a personal sort". Yet "the serious judge" will find such "advantages of a very dubious value" considering his "want of political discernment in the orations on constitutional questions and of juristic deduction in the forensic addresses, the egotism forgetful of its duty... [and] the dreadful barrenness of thought". Yet as a "mouthpiece" for politicians Cicero "was useful on account of his lawyer's talent of finding a reason, or at any rate words, for everything."&lt;ref&gt;Mommsen (1854–56; 1957) IV: 470–471 (Bk.V, ch.V mid); V: 503–506 (Bk.V, ch.XII near end), 132–133 (Bk.V, ch.VIII mid). Himself trained in the law Mommsen apparently did not much appreciate Cicero the lawyer. Regarding the figure of [[Catilina]]: IV: 470, 475, 478–479, ''482–483'' (Bk.V, ch.V near end); 516–518 (Bk.V, ch.VI end).&lt;/ref&gt;

: Nonetheless Momsen acknowledges that those works of Cicero which are presented in the "stylistic dialogue" form are "not devoid of merit". ''[[De Oratore]]'' and other [[rhetoric]]al writings contain "a store of practical forensic experience and forensic anecdotes of all sorts easily and tastefully set forth, and in fact solve the problem of combining didactic instruction with amusement." Cicero's treatise ''[[De Republica]]'' presents a then popular idea "that the existing [[constitution of Rome]] is substantially the ideal state-organisation sought for by the philosophers." Yet it is "a singular mongrel compound of history and philosophy." Relying on the Greeks for both ideas and literary devices, ''De Republica'' contains "comparative originality, inasmuch as the elaboration shows throughout Roman local colouring, and the proud consciousness of political life, which the Roman was certainly entitled to feel as compared with the Greeks." In these dialogues Cicero's fictional advocates are shown gathered, including statesmen from the ''Scipionic'' circle, which "furnish a lively and effective framework... for the scientific discussion."&lt;ref&gt;Mommsen (1854–56; 1957) V: 507–509 (Bk.V, ch.XII near end).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commentary I==
Writers have described Mommsen's history as transformative of prior works on ancient Rome. He employed new sources, e.g., ancient inscriptions, in order to gain new insights. He also wrote in a new fashion. Yet his point of view itself was new, a product of his own life and times, a 19th-century outlook from middle Europe. From the vantage point of our latter era, the 19th-century view presents a result that appears now as somewhat of a distortion. On the other hand, each individual's outlook will necessarily encompass unique insights.&lt;ref&gt;See Collingwood's critique and reflections below, under the subsection "Caesar".&lt;/ref&gt;

===New sources===

Mommsen followed by a generation the historian [[Barthold Niebuhr]], who had made significant advances in Roman studies.&lt;ref&gt;Barthold Georg Niebuhr, ''Romische Geschichte'' (Berlin 1811–1833); later edited by Leonhard Schmitz as ''Romische Geschichte, von dem ersten punische Kreig bis zum tode Constantine'' (Berlin: Realschulbuchh 1844).&lt;/ref&gt; Niebuhr elevated the standards of scholarship and, in doing so, brought to light the lack of rigor of earlier work. He insisted on investigating the original sources. By his perceptive questioning, he challenged the surviving Latin and Greek historical literature, especially regarding earliest Rome. Niebuhr sifted it carefully in order to separate out what genuinely reflected the actual events: stories sourced in persons with personal knowledge, as opposed to inventions created apart from the event and containing suspect information, e.g., legend or folktales thoroughly scrambled with myth and fiction. He relied in part on the emerging field of [[source criticism]] to shed new light on the old writings.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Wiedemann, "Mommsen, Rome, and the German ''Kaiserreich''" 36–47, at 43, in Mommsen, ''A History of Rome under the Emperors'' (1992; 1996).&lt;/ref&gt; Niebuhr's ''Roman History'' was highly praised.&lt;ref&gt;"In the words of Mommsen, all historians, so far as they are worthy of the name, are Niebuhr's pupils, not least those who are not of his school." G. P. Gooch, ''History and Historians in the Nineteenth Century'' (London: Longmans, Green 1913, 4th impr. 1928), "Niebuhr" at 14–24, Mommsen quote at 24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gay and Victor G. Wexler, ''Historians at Work'' (New York: Harper and Row 1975) at 1–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:BartholdNiebuhr.jpg|thumb|right|110px|[[Barthold Niebuhr]] (1776–1831).]]

Yet Mommsen outdid Niebuhr. Mommsen sought to create a new category of material evidence on which to build an account of Roman history, i.e., in addition to the literature and art. Of chief importance were the many surviving Latin inscriptions, often on stone or metal. Also included were the Roman ruins, and the various Roman artefacts ranging from pottery and textiles, to tools and weapons. Mommsen encouraged the systematic investigation of these new sources, combined with on-going developments in [[philology]] and [[legal history]]. Much on-going work was furthering this program: inscriptions were being gathered and authenticated, site work performed at the ruins, and technical examination make of the objects. From a coordinated synthesis of these miscellaneous studies, historical models might be constructed. Such modeling would provide historians with an objective framework independent of the ancient texts, by which to determine their reliability. Information found in the surviving literature then could be for the first time properly scrutinized for its truth value and accordingly appraised.&lt;ref&gt;G. P. Gooch, ''History and Historians in the Nineteenth Century'' (London: Longmans, Green 1913, 1928) at 454–465.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf., Mommsen, "Rector's Address" (University of Berlin 1874), second half translated in ''Varieties of History'' edited by Fritz Stern (Cleveland: World/Meridian 1956) at 192–196.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"[T]hrough [[comparative linguistics]], [[numismatics]], and [[epigraphy]], Mommsen was trying to create a body of material which had the status of archival evidence and which would serve as a control on the narratives of historical writers such as [[Livy]] and [[Appian]]. Their narratives had already been subjected to scrutiny by earlier scholars, of whom the most significant was [[Barthold Georg Niebuhr]] (1776–1831). ... Niebuhr's method had been to apply the principles of "Source Criticism" to unravel contradictions in the traditional account, and then to explain them by applying models developed in the light of his own experience, e.g., of conscription in a peasant society. Mommsen's work sought to establish entirely new categories of evidence for the use of the historian."&lt;ref&gt;T. Wiedemann, "Mommsen, Rome, and the German ''Kaiserreich''" 36–47, at 43, in Mommsen, ''A History of Rome under the Emperors'' (1992; 1996).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Mommsen's work won immediate, widespread acclaim, but the praise it drew was not unanimous. "While the public welcomed the book with delight and scholars testified to its impeccable erudition, some specialists were annoyed at finding old hypotheses rejected... ."&lt;ref&gt;G. P. Gooch, ''History and Historians of the Nineteenth Century'' (1913, 1928) at 456–457.&lt;/ref&gt; Mommsen omits much of the [[Romulus|foundation legends]] and other tales of early Rome, because he could find no independent evidence to verify them.&lt;ref&gt;Apparently Mommsen mentions Romulus only once in connection with determining the early boundary line of Roman territory. Mommsen (1854–56; 1957) at I: 58–59 (Bk.I, ch.4 mid).&lt;/ref&gt; He thus ignored a scholarly field that was seeking a harmonized view using merely ancient writers. Instead Mommsen's ''Römische Geschichte'' presented only events from surviving literature that could be somehow checked against other knownledge gained elsewhere, e.g., from inscriptions, philology, or [[archaeology]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;"[The book] astonished and shocked professional scholars by its revolutionary treatment of the misty beginnings of Rome, sweeping away the old legends of the kings and heroes and along with them the elaborate critical structure deduced from those tales by Barthold Niebuhr, whose reputation as the grand master of Roman history was then sacrosanct. It replaced the critical work of Niebuhr with a far more penetrating criticism and a profounder body of inference."&lt;ref&gt;Saunders and Collins, "Introduction" 1–17, at 6, in their shorter edition of Mommsen, ''History of Rome'' (Leipzig 1854–56; New Haven CN: Greenwich/Meridian 1957).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Work continues, of course, in the trans-generational endeavor of moderns to understand what can legitimately be understood from what is left of the ancient world, including the works of the ancient historians. To be self-aware of how the approach ancient evidence, of course, is included in the challenge.&lt;ref&gt;Cf., Gary Forsythe, ''A Critical History of Early Rome. From prehistory to the first Punic war'' (University of California 2005), e.g., his chapter 3, "The ancient sources for early Roman history" at 59–77.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Novel style===

{Under construction}

There were academics who disapproved of its tone. "It was indeed the work of a politician and journalist as well as of a scholar." Before writing the ''History'', Mommsen had participated in events during the unrest of [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|1848 in Germany]], a year of European-wide revolts; he had worked editing a periodical which involved politics. Later Mommsen became a member of the Prussian legislature and eventually of the [[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]].&lt;ref&gt;Gooch, ''History and Historians of the Nineteenth Century'' (1913, 1928) at 456–457, 455, 464–465.&lt;/ref&gt; Mommsen's transparent comparison of ancient to modern politics is said to distort, his terse style to be journalistic, i.e., not up to the standard to be achieved by the professional academic.

About his modernist tone, Mommsen wrote: "I wanted to bring down the ancients from the fantastic pedestal on which they appear into the real world. That is why the [[Roman consul|consul]] had to become the [[burgomaster]]." As to his partisanship, Mommsen replied: "Those who have lived through historical events... see that history is neither written nor made without love and hate." To the challenge that he favored the political career of [[Julius Caesar]], Mommsen referred to the corruption and dysfunction of the tottering Republic: "When a Government cannot govern, it ceases to be legitimate, and he who has the power to overthrow it has also the right." He further clarified, stating the Caesar's role must be considered as the lesser of two evils. As an organism is better than a machine "so is every imperfect constitution which gives room for the free self-determination of a majority of citizens infinitely [better] than the most humane and wonderful absolutism; for one is living, and the other is dead." Thus, the Empire would only hold together a tree without sap.&lt;ref&gt;Gooch, ''History and Historians'' (1913, 1928) at 457–458, quoting Mommsen the four times.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:T-mommsen-2.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Theodor Mommsen]].]]

===Roman parties===

"In only one important aspect", Saunders and Collins hold, "did Mommsen fall into serious error." They note that 'most' scholars have faulted Mommsen for his depiction of the [[Political institutions of Ancient Rome|Roman party system]] during the late Republic. They readily admit that the Senate was dominated by a hardcore of 'aristocrats' or the 'oligarchy', who also nearly monopolized the chief offices of government, e.g., [[Roman consul|consul]], by means of family connection, marriage alliance, wealth, or corruption. Such "men may be said to have formed a 'party' in the sense that they had at least a common outlook—stubborn conservatism." They contended vainly among themselves for state 'honors' and personal greed, "forming cliques and intrigues in what amounted to a private game". Such Senate 'misrule' subverted Rome, causing prolonged wrongs and injustice that "aroused sporadic and sometimes massive and desperate opposition. But the opposition was never organized into a party. ... [T]here was no clear political tradition running from the [[Gracchi]] through [[Gaius Marius|Marius]] to [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]]." &lt;ref&gt;Saunders and Collins, "Introduction" 1–17, at 8–9, to their shortened 1958 edition of Mommsen's ''History of Rome''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Here Saunders and Collins appear to be summarizing Mommsen, ''The History of Rome'' (1854–1856; 1862–1866; reprint by The Free Press 1957) at III: 297–304 (Bk.IV, ch.2 start).&lt;/ref&gt;

The classicist [[Lily Ross Taylor]] addresses this issue, as follows. [[Cicero]], to refer to these two rival political groups, continually used the Latin word ''partes'' [English "parties"]. Cicero (106–43) was a key figure in Roman politics who wrote volumes about it. In distinguishing the two groups, he employed the Latin terms ''optimates'' for proponents of the Senate nobility and ''populares'' for elite proponents of the popular [[Glossary of rhetorical terms|demos]] or commoners. She points to the Roman historians [[Sallust]] (86–34) and [[Livy]] (59 BC-AD 17) for partial confirmation, as well as to later writers [[Plutarch]] (c.46–120), [[Appian]] (c.95-c.165), and [[Cassius Dio|Dio]] (c.155-c.235), and later still [[Machiavelli]] (1469–1527).&lt;ref&gt;[[Lily Ross Taylor]], ''Party politics in the age of Caesar'' (University of California 1949) at 8–14, with notes 18–54 at 187–193; especially at 10–12 and the historians in footnote 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

These rival political groups, Prof. Taylor states, were quite amorphous, as Mommsen well knew. In fact when Mommsen wrote his ''Romische Geschichte'' (1854–1856) political parties in Europe and America were also generally amorphous, being comparatively unorganized and unfocused, absent member alligiance and often lacking programs. Yet in the 20th century [[Political parties|modern parties]] grew better organized with enduring policies, so that their comparison with ancient Rome has become more and more tenuous. She describes Mommsen:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Theodor Mommsen... presented party politics of the late [Roman] republic in terms of the strife of his own day between liberalism and the reaction that won [[Revolution of 1848|the battle in 1848]]. Mommsen identified the Roman ''optimates'' with the hated [[Prussian Junkers]] and aligned himself with Caesar against them. But he fully recognized the lack of principle or program among the ''populares''. He well understood the amorphous character of the Roman 'parties'. The parties that he knew in Prussia and in other German states were almost equally amorphous."&lt;ref name="Taylor, 1949"&gt;Taylor, ''Party politics in the age of Caesar'' (University of California 1949) at 12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As Prof. Taylor continues, since Mommsen's wrote modern party 'tickets' and party 'lines' have grown more disciplined, and "the meaning of party had undergone a radical change. Thus the terms '[[optimate]]' and '[[Populares|popular]]' party are misleading to the modern reader. [¶] Lately there has been protest against the attribution of parties to Rome. The protest has gone too far." That is, the above-stated divisions were strong and constellated politics during the last century of the [[Roman Republic]].&lt;ref name="Taylor, 1949"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lily Ross Taylor (1949) at 12 text note 50 (at 192) cites to Mommsen,  ''The History of Rome'' (1854–1856; 1862–1866; reprint by The Free Press 1957) at III: 303 (Bk.IV, ch.2 start/mid): "Both parties contended alike for shadows and numbered in their ranks none but enthusiasts and hypocrites." Both were equally corrupt and "in fact equally worthless". Neither had a plan reaching much beyond the ''status quo'' of the moment. Their contests were more over political tactics than over state policy.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revolution(s)===

In 1961 the British historian [[Edward Hallett Carr]] published his ''[[What is History?]]'', which became well known. Therein Carr conjectured that the very nature of [[historiography|writing history]] will cause historians as a whole to reveal themselves to their readers as 'prisoners' subject to the context of their own age and culture. As a consequence, one may add, every generation feels the need to rewrite history so that it better fits their own situation, their point of view. To illustrate his point here, Carr selected as exemplars a number of well-regarded [[historians]], among them being Theodore Mommsen.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Hallett Carr, ''What is History'' (New York: Random House 1961) at 28–29, 35; regarding Mommsen at 43–45.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nationalversammlung in der Paulskirche.jpg|thumb|right|Democratically elected National Assembly at [[Paulskirche, Frankfurt|St. Paul's Church]], [[Frankfurt]], 18 May 1848.]]

Accordingly, Carr informs us that Mommsen's multivolume work ''Römische Geschichte'' (Leipzig 1854–1856) may tell the perceptive modern historian much about mid-19th-century Germany, while it is presenting an account of ancient Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Such reaction to Mommsen's ''History of Rome'' (1854–1856) began in the mid-1850s. Gooch, ''History and Historians in the Nineteenth Century'' (London: Longmans, Green 1913) at 457.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lily Ross Taylor, ''Party politics in the age of Caesar'' (University of California 1949) at 12, where the comparison between ancient Rome and Mommsen's Germany is expressly noted and drawn out.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Some see an analogy not between ancient Rome and Mommsen's Germany, but Rome and the modern West. In 1931 [[Egon Friedell]] summed it up: "[[Crassus]] becomes a [[speculator]] in the manner of [[Louis-Philippe of France|Louis Philippe]], the brothers [[Gracchus]] are [[Socialist]] leaders, and the [[Gallia|Gauls]] are [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indians]], etc." Friedell, ''Kulturgeschichte der Neuzeit'' (1931), at III: 270.&lt;/ref&gt; A major recent event in Germany was the failure of the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|1848–1849 Revolution]], while in Mommsen's ''Roman History'' his narration of the [[Roman Republic|Republic]] draws to a close with the revolutionary emergence of a strong state executive in the figure of [[Julius Caesar]]. Carr conjectures as follows.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Mommsen was imbued with the sense of need for a strong man to clean up the mess left by the failure of the German people to realize its political aspirations; and we shall never appreciate its history at its true value until we realize that his well-known idealization of Caesar is the product of this yearning for the strong man to save Germany from ruin, and that the lawyer-politician [[Cicero]], that ineffective chatterbox and slippery procrastinator, has walked straight out of the debates of the [[Paulskirche|Paulikirche]] in [[Frankfurt]] in 1848."&lt;ref name="Carr 1961 43–44"&gt;{{cite book|last=Carr|first=Edward Hallett|title=What is History|publisher=Knopf|location=New York|year=1961|oclc=397273|pages=43–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Far from protesting or denying such an observation, Mommsen himself readily admitted it. He added, "I wanted to bring down the ancient from their fantastic pedestal on which they appear in the real world. That is why the consul had to become the burgomaster. Perhaps I have overdone it; but my intention was sound enough."&lt;ref&gt;Mommsen quoted in G. P. Gooch, ''History and Historians in the Nineteenth Century'' (London: Longmans, Green 1913) at 457.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See discussion here above in section "Novel style".&lt;/ref&gt;

Alongside Carr on Mommsen, Carr likewise approaches [[George Grote]]'s ''History of Greece'' (1846–1856) and states that it must also reveal that period's England as well as ancient Greece. Thus about Grote's book Carr conjectures.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Grote, an enlightened radical banker writing in the 1840s, embodied the aspirations of the rising and politically progressive British middle class in an idealized picture of Athenian democracy, in which [[Pericles]] figured as a [[Jeremy Bentham|Benthamite]] reformer, and Athens acquired an empire in a fit of absence of mind. It may not be fanciful to suggest that Grote's neglect of the problem of slavery in Athens reflected the failure of the group in which he belonged to face the problem of the new English factory [[working class]].&lt;ref&gt;Carr, ''What is History?'' (New York: Random House/Vintage 1961) at 43.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

"I should not think it an outrageous paradox", writes Carr, "if someone were to say that Grote's ''History of Greece'' has quite as much to tell us about the thought of the English [[philosophical radicals]] in the 1840s as about [[Athenian democracy]] in the fifth century B.C."&lt;ref&gt;Carr, ''What is History?'' (1961) at 44.&lt;/ref&gt; Prof. Carr credits the philosopher R. G. Collingwood as being his inspiration for this line of thinking.&lt;ref&gt;Carr, ''What is History?'' (1961) at 29–31.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Robin G. Collingwood.jpg|thumb|right|80px|[[R. G. Collingwood|Collingwood]]]]

[[Robin Collingwood]], an early 20th-century Oxford professor, worked at building a philosophy of history, wherein history would remain a sovereign discipline. In pursuing this project he studied extensively the Italian philosopher and historian [[Benedetto Croce]] (1866–1952). Collingwood wrote on Croce, here in his 1921 essay.&lt;ref&gt;Collingwood's essay here explicates Croce's ''Teoria e Storia della Storiografia'' (Bari 1917). Collingwood (1921, 1965) at 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Croce shows how [[Herodotus]], [[Livy]], [[Tacitus]], [[George Grote|Grote]], [[Mommsen]], [[Jacques Nicolas Augustin Thierry|Thierry]], and so forth, all wrote from a subjective point of view, wrote so that their personal ideals and feelings coloured their whole work and in parts falsified it. Now, if this is so, who wrote real history, history not coloured by points of view and ideals? Clearly no one. ... History, to be, must be seen, and must be seen by somebody, from somebody's point of view. ... But this is not an accusation against any particular school of historians; it is a law of our nature."&lt;ref&gt;[[R. G. Collingwood]], "Croce's Philosophy of History"  in ''The Hibbert Journal'', XIX: 263–278 (1921), collected in his ''Essays on a Philosophy of History'' (University of Texas 1965) at 3–22, 11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In summary, Edward Carr here presents his interesting developments regarding the theories proposed by Benedetto Croce and later taken up by Robin Collingwood. In doing so Carr does not allege mistaken views or fault specific to Mommsen, or to any of the other historians he mentions. Rather any such errors and faults would be general to all history writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Carr|first=Edward Hallett|title=What is History|publisher=Knopf|location=New York|year=1961|oclc=397273|pages=43–44}} Other historians mentioned by Carr (at 48) include: [[G. M. Trevelyan|Trevelyan]], [[Namier]], and [[Friedrich Meinecke|Meinecke]].&lt;/ref&gt; As Collingwood states, "The only safe way of avoiding error is to give up looking for the truth."&lt;ref&gt;[[R. G. Collingwood]], "Croce's Philosophy of History" in ''The Hibbert Journal'', XIX: 263–278 (1921), collected in his ''Essays on a Philosophy of History'' (University of Texas 1965) at 3–22, 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, this line of thought, and these examples and illustrations of how Mommsen's Germany might color his history of ancient Rome, are illuminating concerning both the process and the result.

===Caesar===

The figure of Julius Caesar (100–44) remains controversial among historians and students of ancient Rome.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., Luciano Canfora, ''Giulio Cesare. Il dittatore democratico'' (Roma-Bari: Gius. Laterza &amp; Figli 1999) translated as ''Julius Caesar. The life and times of the peoples dictator'' (University of California 2007). In addition to the usual attacks and praise associated with the name of Julius Caesar, here Canfora also mentions the great devastation said to be caused by the [[Gallic Wars|conquest of Gaul]] under the command of Caesar, including enormous loss of life and enslavement of populations, as reported by [[Pliny the Elder]] (23–79) in his ''[[Naturalis Historia]]'' VII: 91–99, and also found in other ancient authors. Canfora (1999, 2007) at 118–123, 121.&lt;/ref&gt; Mommsen saw in him a leader with a special gift for organizing and transforming the city-state, which had come to rule the Mediterranean world.&lt;ref&gt;Mommsen, ''A History of Rome'' (1854–1856; 1862–1864; reprint by The Free Press 1957), e.g., at IV: 278–280 (Bk.V, ch.1 mid) and V: 107, 174, 305–315 (Bk.V, ch. 8 start, ch.9 mid, ch.11 start).&lt;/ref&gt; Caesar was opposed by an oligarchy of aristocratic families, the ''optimates'', who dominated the Senate and nearly monopolized state offices, who profited by the city's corruption and exploited the foreign conquests. They blocked the change necessitated by the times, stifling or coopting, at times by violence, any who advanced progressive programs. Although the state was dangerously unsteady, and the city often rent by armed mobs, the ''optimates'' rested on their heritage of the Roman tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Mommsen, ''A History of Rome'' (1854–1856; 1862–1864; reprint by The Free Press 1957), e.g., at III: 297–299 (Bk.IV, ch.2 start).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Giulio-cesare-enhanced 1-800x1450.jpg|thumb|left|100px|[[Julius Caesar]], bust at the [[Naples National Archaeological Museum|Museo Archeologico Nazionale di Napoli]].]]

Caesar sprang from the heart of this old nobility, yet he was born into a family which had already allied itself with the ''populares'', i.e., those who favored constitutional change. Hence Caesar's career was associated with the struggle for a new order and, failing opportunity along peaceful avenues, he emerged as a military leader whose triumph at arms worked to advance political change. Yet both parties in this long struggle had checkered histories of violence and corruption. Mommsen, too, recognized and reported "Caesar the rake, Caesar the conspirator, and Caesar the groundbreaker for later centuries of absolutism."&lt;ref&gt;Saunder &amp; Collins, "Introduction" 1–17, at 8, to their short edition of Mommsen, ''A History of Rome'' (New Haven CN: Meridian 1957).&lt;/ref&gt;

Some moderns follow the ''optimate'' view that it was a nefarious role that Caesar played in the fall of the [[Roman Republic|Republic]], whose ruling array of institutions had not yet outlived their usefulness.&lt;ref&gt;Cf., [[Erich S. Gruen]], ''The Last Generation of the Roman Republic'' (University of California 1974, 1995) at 498–507. Gruen is not given to judge Caesar, but at 504 he concludes that the Republic might well have survived but for the severe damage wrought by the ferocious civil war fought between Pompey and Caesar.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf., [[W. Warde Fowler]], ''Roman essays and interpretations'' (Oxford Univ. 1920), "Thomas Mommsen: His Life and Work" 250–268, at 259.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W. P. Allen, "Theodor Mommsen" in the ''North Atlantic Review'' (1970) at 112: 445–465, at 452: "His lawyer's reverence for authority too often leads him to side with power and prerogative against impotent cravings after freedom." Of course, to the contrary, Mommsen the revolutionary of 1848 might have shaken his head to read this comment.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Compare: [[William Shakespeare]], ''The Tragedy of Julius Caesar'' [1599], in ''The Complete Plays and Poems of William Shakespeare'', edited by Wm. A. Neilson and Chs. J. Hill (Cambridge MA: Houghton and Mifflin 1942) at 1012–1042. Shakespeare's play might yet influence how Caesar is regarded, although the above editors at 1011 comment: &lt;blockquote&gt;"The character of Caesar is deliberately foreshortened in the play for dramatic purposes. Since Caesar must be assassinated, Shakespeare must stress those qualities in him which can justify the deed in the eyes of those who commit it and who must, temporarily, have the sympathy of the audience. Consequently, Caesar is presented without reference to the genuine springs of his greatness, emphasis being place upon his arrogance."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; To the contrary, the Republic's fall ushered in the oppressive [[Roman Empire|Empire]] whose 'divine' rulers held absolute power. Julius Caesar as villain was an opinion shared, of course, by his knife-wielding assassins, most of whom were also nobility. Shared also without shame by that epitome of classical Roman politics and letters, [[Marcus Tullius Cicero]] (106–43).&lt;ref&gt;[[Cicero]] in his published writings refers to Caesar's assassins as "the company who did that most glorius of deeds". Cicero, ''Second Philippic against Anthony'' [October, 44 BCE]; in Cicero, ''Selected Works'', edited by [[Michael Grant (author)|Michael Grant]] (Penguin Books 1962, 1971) at 102–153, 113.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cicero in a private letter to his friend Atticus writes about one having "feasted his eyes on the just death of a tyrant." Quoted by [[D. R. Shackleton Bailey]] in his ''Cicero'' (New York: Chs. Scribner's Sons 1971) at 228. Bailey at 227 remarks: &lt;blockquote&gt;"[W]hen [[Marcus Junius Brutus|Brutus]] brandished the dagger he had just plunged into Caesar's body and shouted congratulations to Cicero by name, he knew he could count on a wholehearted response. Cicero saw the murder as a splendid feat of patriotic heroism, and the victim as a public enemy over whose fate all good citizens should rejoice and be glad."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The murder of Caesar brought Cicero nothing but satisfaction." J.P.V.D. Balsdon, "Cicero the Man" in Dudley and Dorey, editors, ''Cicero'' (London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul 1964) at 171–214, 186.&lt;/ref&gt; For some observers, following Caesar's assassination Cicero saved his rather erratic career in politics by his high-profile stand in favor of the Republic.&lt;ref&gt;[[H. H. Scullard]], "The Political Career of a 'Novus Homo'", in Dudley and Dorey, editors, ''Cicero'' (London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul 1964) at 1–25, 24. Scullar calls it "the greatest period of his life" with regard to Cicero's "series of speeches, the Philippics."&lt;/ref&gt; Also strong among Caesar's opponents was [[Marcus Porcius Cato Uticensis]] (95–46), who had long led the ''opimates'', supporters of the republican aristocracy, against the ''populares'' and in particular against Julius Caesar. During the Imperial era the [[Stoicism|stoic]] Cato became the symbol of lost republican virtue.&lt;ref&gt;Erich S. Gruen, ''The Last Generation of the Roman Republic'' (University of California 1974, 1995) at 53–55.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:CiceroBust.jpg|thumb|right|100px|[[M. Tullius Cicero]] at about age 60.]]

Nonetheless, even deadly foes could see the bright genius of Caesar; indeed, many conspitators were his beneficiaries.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Selected Letters'', edited by D. R. Shackleton Bailey (Penguin Books [1965–1980], 1982) at 13 (Cicero), at 239 (C. Cassius Longinus), at 245–246 (D. Junius Brutus).&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Marcus Junius Brutus|Brutus]], [[Gaius Cassius Longinus|Cassius]] and the others who, like Cicero, attached themselves to the conspiracy acted less out of enmity to Caesar than out of a desire to destroy his ''dominatio''."&lt;ref&gt;David Shotter, ''The Fall of the Roman Republic'' (London: Routledge 1994) at 86.&lt;/ref&gt; Too, the conspiracy failed to restore the Republic.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mary Beard (classicist)|Mary Beard]] and [[Michael Crawford (historian)|Michael Crawford]], ''Rome in the Late Republic'' (Cornell University 1985) at 68–71, 85–87.&lt;/ref&gt; An aristocrat's ''libertas'' meant very little to the population: the people, the armies, or even the [[Equites|equestrians]]; his assassins "failed to grasp the real pulse of the ''respublica''."&lt;ref&gt;David Shotter, ''The Fall of the Roman Republic'' (London: Routledge 1994) at 86–87.&lt;/ref&gt;

Moderns may be able to see both sides of the issue, however, as an historian might. Indeed, there exists a great difference in context between, say, an American, and a German historian of the 1850s, where during [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|1848]] citizens had made a rather spontaneous, incoherent effort to move German politics toward a free and unified country: it was crushed by the nobility.&lt;ref&gt;Cf., Rudolph Stadelmann, ''Sozial und politische Geschichte der Revolution von 1848'' (München: F. Bruckman 1948, 2d ed. 1970), translated as ''Social and Political History of the German 1848 Revolution'' (Ohio University 1975).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Lily Ross Taylor]], ''Party politics in the age of Caesar'' (University of California 1949) at 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosopher [[Robin Collingwood]] (1889–1943) developed a nuanced view of history in which each person explores ''the past'' in order to create his or her own true understanding of that person's unique ''cultural inheritance''. Although objectivity remains crucial to the process, each will naturally draw out their own inner truth from the universe of human truth. This fits the stark limitations on each individual's ability to know all sides of history. To a mitigated extent these constraints work also on the historian. Collingwood writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"This does not reduce history to something arbitrary or capricious. It remains genuine knowledge. How can this be, if my thoughts about Julius Caesar differ from Mommsen's? Must not one of us be wrong? No, because the object differs. My historical [object] is about my own past, not about Mommsen's past. Mommsen and I share in a great many things, and in many respects we share in a common past; but in so far as we are different people and representatives of different cultures and different generations we have different pasts. ... [O]ur views of Julius Caesar must differ, slightly perhaps, but perceptibly. This difference is not arbitrary, for I can see—or ought to be able to see—that in his place, apart (once more) from all questions of error, I should have come to his conclusions."&lt;ref&gt;[[R. G. Collingwood]], "The Philosophy of History" (Oxford University, History Asn. #79, 1930), reprinted in his ''Essays in the Philosophy of History'', edited by Wm. Debbins (University of Texas) at 121–139, 138–139.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A modern historian of ancient Rome echoes the rough, current consensus of academics about this great and controversial figure, as he concludes his well-regarded biography of Julius Caesar: "When they killed him his assassins did not realise that they had eliminated the best and most far-sighted mind of their class."&lt;ref&gt;Luciano Canfora, ''Giulio Cesare. Il dittatore democratico'' (Roma-Bari: Gius. Laterza &amp; Figli 1999) translated as ''Julius Caesar. The life and times of the peoples dictator'' (University of California 2007) at 348.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf., H. H. Scullard, ''From the Gracchi to Nero. A History of Rome from 133 BC to AD 68'' (London: Methuen 1959, 4th ed. 1976) at 157–158.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf., Erich S. Gruen, ''The Last Generation of the Roman Republic'' (University of California 1974, 1995) at 490–497.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commentary II==
{Under construction}

Placing Mommsen within the galaxy of world historians, subsequent writers have viewed his work from a more technical, professional perspective. The corpus of Mommsen's work may be picked at and poked. Problems and conundrums emerge. How did Mommsen handle recurrent issues of historiography? In addressing the perplexing reality of the ancient past, as a modern scholar to an educated audience, Mommsen was required to negotiate the common difficulties. How did he fare?

===4th volume===

Mommsen mentioned the future publication of a fourth volume on the Roman Empire. Due to the immense popularity of his first three, there remained for decades substantial interest and expectation concerning the appearance of this fourth volume. Yet it did not appear in Mommsen's lifetime. Consequently, this missing fourth volume has caused numerous scholars to speculate about the reasons 'why not'. Concurrently, such musings served to suggest where Theodore Mommsen was to be situated amid the portrait gallery of historians of the 19th century and the modern era.

As to the matter of why "Mommsen failed to continue his history beyond the fall of the republic", Carr wrote: "During his active career, the problem of what happened once the strong man had taken over was not yet actual. Nothing inspired Mommsen to project this problem back on to the Roman scene; and the history of the empire remained unwritten."&lt;ref name="Carr 1961 43–44"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;## Demandt. Changed circumstances, changed POV. Objective differences. Positivism.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Positivism===

&lt;ref&gt;## Toynbee, Collingwood, Carr. Paradox/irony of the specialized technician who cannot write a general history.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Points of View===

&lt;ref&gt;## POV: Dates from Rome's traditional founding in 753 BCE by Niebuhr, &amp; re Chr. Celts.
Collingwood or Carr. Classics: Greek &amp; Latin.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Discernment===

Because of Mommsen's expert knowledge across many field of study, he "knows as an eyewitness because... such a perfect comprehension [places him] in the position of a contemporary. [Thus he feels] a certainty he cannot explain, like the judgment of a statesman or a shrewd man of business who forms his opinions by processes he does not attempt to analyse."&lt;ref&gt;Allen at 452; Mommsen "sees things which others overlook, and gives weight to evidence where others find no evidence." at 452–453; intuitive insight" at 453.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;It's a serious defect that there are so few references to authority. Allen at 464.&lt;/ref&gt;

While not following Niebuhr's 'divination', Mommsen's manner goes to question of whether one may use discrete and controlled 'intersticial projection', safeguarded by monitoring the results closely ''after the fact''. Does its use necessarily sacrifice claims to 'objectivity'? Termed intuition based on scholarship, practitioners of such techniques are vulnerable to caustic challenges to the integrity of their science. Acknowledgement of such infirmities may also include an assessment of the skill involved and the quality of the result.&lt;ref&gt;Allen quote. E.g., his 'portraits'.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Praise===

Mommsen's work continues to attract a refined and popular readership. In their introduction Saunders and Collins express their admiration for Mommsen and his contribution to [[Classics|the study]] of ancient Roman history:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Theodor Mommsen (1817–1903) was the greatest classical historian of his century or of ours. His only rival in any century was [[Edward Gibbon]], whose monumental [[History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]] complements rather than competes with Mommsen's superb description of the Roman republic."&lt;ref&gt;Mommsen, ''History of Rome'' (New Haven: Meridian Books 1958), edited by Saunders and Collins, at 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One encyclopaedic reference summarizes: "Equally great as antiquary, jurist, political and social historian, Mommsen [had] no rivals. He combined the power of minute investigation with a singular faculty for bold generalization... ."&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica'', cited by Saunders and Collins, "Introduction" at 2, to Mommsen, ''History of Rome'' (1958).&lt;/ref&gt; About the ''History of Rome'' the universal historian [[Arnold J. Toynbee]] writes, "Mommsen wrote a great book, which certainly will always be reckoned among the masterpieces of Western historical literature."&lt;ref&gt;Arnold J. Toynbee, ''A Study of History, volume one'' (Oxford University 1934, 2d ed. 1935, 1962) at I: 3./ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; [[G. P. Gooch]] gives us these comments evaluating Mommsen's ''History'': "Its sureness of touch, its many-sided knowledge, its throbbing vitality and the Venetian colouring of its portraits left an ineffaceable impression on every reader." "It was a work of genius and passion, the creation of a young man, and is as fresh and vital to-day as when it was written."&lt;ref&gt;''History and Historians'' (1913, 1928) at 456 and 458.&lt;/ref&gt;

==1902 Nobel Prize==

[[File:Theodor Mommsen by Franz von Lenbach.jpg|thumb|right|190px|[[Theodor Mommsen]], 1897 Portrait by [[Franz von Lenbach]].]]

In 1902 Professor Theodor Mommsen became the second person to be awarded the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]], which had been inaugurated the preceding year. This world recognition was given him with "special reference" to the ''Römische Geschichte'' (the ''History of Rome''). The commendation called him "the greatest living master of the art of historical writing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1902/index.html|title=The Nobel Prize in Literature 1902|author=|date=|work=nobelprize.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The award came nearly fifty years after the first appearance of the work. The award also came during the last year of the author's life (1817–1903). It is the only time thus far that the [[List of Nobel laureates in Literature|Nobel Prize for Literature]] has been presented to a [[historian]] ''per se''.&lt;ref&gt;Cf., Alexander Demandt, "Introduction" 1–35, at 1 (502 n.2), to Mommsen's ''A History of Rome under the Emperors'' (Munich 1992; London 1996). Demandt also mentions Winston Churchill.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet the literary Nobel has since been awarded to a philosopher (1950) with mention of an "intellectual history",&lt;ref&gt;[[Bertrand Russell]] in 1950 received the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]]. In the award presentation his then recent work ''A History of Western Philosophy'' (1946) was mentioned first along with a few other books, 35 of his titles being referenced in all.&lt;/ref&gt; and to a war-time leader (1953) for speeches and writings, including a "current events history",&lt;ref&gt;[[Winston Churchill]] was a recipient of the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]]. He was selected in 1953 for his political oratory, his biographies, and his histories, e.g., his ''The Second World War'' (1948–1953). The later work, of course, he wrote in his role as a leading participant, and it was a collaborative effort. Later Churchill would write his ''History of the English Speaking Peoples'' (1956–1958).&lt;/ref&gt; plus a Nobel Memorial Prize has been awarded for two "economic histories" (1993).&lt;ref&gt;The 1993 [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] was awarded concurrently to [[Robert W. Fogel]] and to [[Douglass North]], both of whom separately wrote economic histories, each employing their discipline's analytic structures in order to better understand major events of the past.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless Mommsen's multi-volume ''History of Rome'' remains in a singular Nobel class.

The 1911 ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', a well-regarded reference yet nonetheless "a source unsparingly critical", summarizes: "Equally great as antiquary, jurist, political and social historian, Mommsen lived to see the time when among students of Roman history he had pupils, followers, critics, but no rivals. He combined the power of minute investigation with a singular faculty for bold generalization and the capacity for tracing out the effects of thought on political and social life."&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica'', cited by Saunders and Collins, "Introduction" at 2, to Mommsen, ''History of Rome'' (1958). Cf., "Theodor Mommsen" in the 11th edition, published in 1911.&lt;/ref&gt;

The British historian [[G. P. Gooch]], writing in 1913, eleven years after Mommsen's Nobel prize, gives us this evaluation of his ''Römisches Geschichte'': "Its sureness of touch, its many-sided knowledge, its throbbing vitality and the Venetian colouring of its portraits left an ineffaceable impression on every reader." "It was a work of genius and passion, the creation of a young man, and is as fresh and vital to-day as when it was written."&lt;ref&gt;G. P. Gooch, ''History and Historians'' (1913, 1928) at 456 and 458.&lt;/ref&gt; About the ''History of Rome'' another British historian [[Arnold J. Toynbee]] in 1934 wrote, at the beginning of his own 12-volume universal history, "Mommsen wrote a great book, [''Römisches Geschichte''],  which certainly will always be reckoned among the masterpieces of Western historical literature."&lt;ref&gt;Arnold J. Toynbee, ''A Study of History, volume one'' (Oxford University 1934, 2d ed. 1935, 1962) at I: 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Homework - vector maths.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Some geometry homework]]

'''Homework''', or a '''homework assignment''', is a set of tasks assigned to [[student]]s by their [[teacher]]s to be completed outside the [[Class (education)|class]]. Common homework assignments may include required [[Reading (activity)|reading]], a [[writing]] or [[typing]] project, [[mathematical exercise]]s to be completed, information to be reviewed before a [[Test (assessment)|test]], or other skills to be practiced.

The effect of homework is debated.  Generally speaking, homework does not improve academic performance among children{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} and may improve academic skills among older students, especially lower-achieving students.  Homework also creates stress for students and their parents and reduces the amount of time that students could spend outdoors, exercising, playing, working, sleeping, or in other activities.

The basic objectives of assigning homework to students are the same as schooling in general: to increase the knowledge and improve the abilities and skills of the students,&lt;ref&gt;Synthesis of research on homework. H Cooper - ''Educational leadership'', 1989 - addison.pausd.org&lt;/ref&gt; to prepare them for upcoming (or complex or difficult) lessons, to extend what they know by having them apply it to new situations, or to integrate their abilities by applying different skills to a single task. Homework also provides an opportunity for parents to participate in their children's education. Homework is designed to reinforce what students have already learned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Effects ==
=== Academic performance ===
Homework research dates back to the early 1900s. However, no consensus exists on the general effectiveness on homework.{{Sfnp|Trautwein|Köller|2003}} Results of homework studies vary based on multiple factors, such as the age group of those studied and the measure of academic performance.{{Sfnp|Cooper|Robinson|Patall|2006|p=1}}

Among teenagers, students who spend somewhat more time on homework generally have higher [[Grade (education)|grades]], and somewhat higher test scores than students who spend less time on homework.{{Sfnp|Cooper|Robinson|Patall|2006|pp=42–51}}  Very high amounts of homework cause students' academic performance to worsen, even among older students.{{Sfnp|Cooper|Robinson|Patall|2006|pp=42–51}}  Students who are assigned homework in middle and high school score somewhat better on standardized tests, but the students who have 60 to 90 minutes of homework a day in middle school or more than two hours in high school score worse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1376208,00.html|title=The Myth About Homework|last=Wallis|first=Claudia|date=August 29, 2006|publisher=Time Online}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Younger students who spend more time on homework generally have slightly worse, or the same academic performance, as those who spend less time on homework.{{Sfnp|Cooper|Robinson|Patall|2006|pp=42–51}} Homework does not improve academic achievements for [[grade school]] students. 

Low-achieving students receive more benefit from doing homework than high-achieving students.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/education-37494563|title=Is homework worth the hassle?|last=Coughlan|first=Sean|date=2016-09-28|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-04-21|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, schoolteachers commonly assign less homework to the students who need it most, and more homework to the students who are performing well.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Study habits ===
Proponents claim that assigning homework to young children helps them learn good study habits.  Essentially, they advocate for doing potentially unnecessary homework from approximately age five to ten as a way of practicing for doing necessary homework from age 10 to 15.  No research has ever been conducted to determine whether this claim has any merit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/life/family/2006/09/forget_homework.html|title=Forget Homework|last=Bazelon|first=Emily|date=2006-09-14|work=Slate|access-date=2018-04-11|language=en-US|issn=1091-2339}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Non-academic ===
The amount of homework given does not necessarily affect students' attitudes towards homework and various other aspects of school.{{Sfnp|Cooper|Robinson|Patall|2006|p=1}} 

{{Harvtxt|Epstein|1988}} found a near-zero correlation between the amount of homework and parents' reports on how well their elementary school students behaved. {{Harvtxt|Vazsonyi|Pickering|2003}} studied 809 adolescents in American high schools, and found that, using the Normative Deviance Scale as a model for [[Deviance (sociology)|deviance]], the correlation was {{math|''r'' {{=}} .28}} for Caucasian students, and {{math|''r'' {{=}} .24}} for African-American students. For all three of the correlations, higher values represent a higher correlation between time spent on homework and poor conduct.{{Sfnp|Cooper|Robinson|Patall|2006|p=47}}

{{Harvtxt|Bempechat|2004}} says that homework develops students' motivation and study skills. In a single study, parents and teachers of middle school students believed that homework improved students' study skills and personal responsibility skills.{{Sfnp|Xu|Yuan|2003}} Their students were more likely to have negative perceptions about homework and were less likely to ascribe the development of such skills to homework.{{Sfnp|Xu|Yuan|2003}} {{Harvtxt|Leone|Richards|1989}} found that students generally had negative emotions when completing homework and reduced engagement compared to other activities.

=== Health and daily life ===
Homework has been identified in numerous studies and articles as a dominant or significant source of stress and anxiety for students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvp|Bauwens|Hourcade|1992}}, {{Harvp|Conner|Denise|2009}}, {{Harvp|Hardy|2003}}, {{Harvp|Kouzma|Kennedy|2002}}, {{Harvp|West|Wood|1970}}, {{Harvp|Ystgaard|1997}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Studies on the relation between homework and health are few compared to studies on academic performance.{{Sfnp|Cheung|Leung-Ngai|1992|p=146}}{{Sfnp|Galloway|Conner|2013|p=493}}

{{Harvtxt|Cheung|Leung-Ngai|1992}} surveyed 1,983 students in Hong Kong, and found that homework led not only to added stress and anxiety, but also physical symptoms, such as headaches and stomachaches. Students in the survey who were ridiculed or punished by parents and peers had a higher incidence of [[Clinical depression|depression]] symptoms, with 2.2% of students reporting that they "always" had suicidal thoughts, and anxiety was exacerbated by punishments and criticism of students by teachers for both problems with homework as well as forgetting to hand in homework.

A 2007 study of American students by [[MetLife]] found that 89% of students felt stressed from homework, with 34% reporting that they "often" or "very often" felt stressed from homework. Stress was especially evident among high school students. Students that reported stress from homework were more likely to be deprived of sleep.{{Sfnp|Markow|Amie|Margot|2007|p=137}}

Homework can cause tension and conflict in the home as well as at school, and can reduce students' family and leisure time. In the {{Harvtxt|Cheung|Leung-Ngai|1992}} survey, failure to complete homework and low grades where homework was a contributing factor was correlated with greater conflict; some students have reported teachers and parents frequently criticizing their work. In the MetLife study, high school students reported spending more time completing homework than performing home tasks.{{Sfnp|Markow|Amie|Margot|2007}} {{Harvtxt|Kohn|2006}} argued that homework can create family conflict and reduce students' quality of life. The authors of {{Harvtxt|Sallee|Rigler|2008}}, both high school English teachers, reported that their homework disrupted their students' extracurricular activities and responsibilities. However, {{Harvtxt|Kiewra|Kaufman|Hart|Scoular|2009}} found that parents were less likely to report homework as a distraction from their children's activities and responsibilities. {{Harvtxt|Galloway|Conner|Pope|2013}} recommended further empirical study relating to this aspect due to the difference between student and parent observations.

=== Time use ===
{{Harvtxt|Galloway|Conner|Pope|2013}} surveyed 4,317 high school students from ten high-performing schools, and found that students reported spending more than 3 hours on homework daily. 72% of the students reported stress from homework, and 82% reported physical symptoms. The students slept an average of 6 hours 48 minutes, lower than the recommendations prescribed by various health agencies.

A study done at the [[University of Michigan]] in 2007 concluded that the amount of homework given is increasing. In a sample taken of students between the ages of 6 and 9 years, it was shown that students spend more than 2 hours a week on homework, as opposed to 44 minutes in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/default/article/Parents-Too-much-homework-3053802.php|title=Parents: Too much homework|last=Seligman|first=Katherine|date=1999-12-19|publisher=Hearst Communications Inc.|accessdate=2013-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Benefits===
Some educators argue that homework is beneficial to students, as it enhances learning, develops the skills taught in class, and lets educators verify that students comprehend their lessons.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Grohnke, Kennedy, and Jake Merritt. "Do Kids Need Homework?" ''Scholastic'' ''News/ Weekly Reader Edition 5/6,'' vol. 85, no. 3, 2016, pp. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents also argue that homework makes it more likely that students will develop and maintain proper study habits that they can use throughout their educational career.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Yrjö Ollila - Hearing the Homework.jpg|thumb|[[Hearing the Homework]]; Yrjö Ollila ]]
=== United States ===
Historically, homework was frowned upon in [[Culture of the United States|American culture]]. With few students interested in [[higher education]], and due to the necessity to complete daily chores, homework was discouraged not only by parents, but also by school districts. In 1901, the [[California]] legislature passed an act that effectively abolished homework for those who attended kindergarten
through the eighth grade. But, in the 1950s, with increasing pressure on the United States to stay ahead in the [[Cold War]], homework made a resurgence, and children were encouraged to keep up with their [[Soviet Union|Russian]] counterparts. By the end of the Cold War in the early 1990s, the consensus in American education was overwhelmingly in favor of issuing homework to students of all grade levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

| work=The San Francisco Chronicle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===
British students get more homework than many other countries in Europe. The weekly average for the subject is 5 hours. The main distinction for UK homework is the social gap, with middle-class teenagers getting a disproportionate amount of homework compared to Asia and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-30417132|title=UK families' 'long homework hours'|first=Sean|last=Coughlan|date=11 December 2014|accessdate=2 November 2017|website=Bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spain ===
In 2012, a report by the OECD showed that Spanish children spend 6.4 hours a week on homework. This prompted the CEAPA, representing 12,000 parent associations to call for a homework strike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/nov/02/parents-in-the-uk-and-abroad-do-your-children-get-set-too-much-homework|title=Parents in the UK and abroad: do your children get set too much homework?|first=Sarah|last=Marsh|date=2 November 2016|accessdate=2 November 2017|website=Theguardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  Dr. Thompson and Hursti believed they could change or [[hack (technology slang)|hack]] vote totals without the system detecting entry. The first two projects targeted the computer program that adds up all the voting machine results and produces the final report. On Feb. 14 and again on May 2, Thompson successfully hacked the Diebold GEMS central tabulator and bypassed all passwords by using a Visual Basic script. This, however, would be detected in a vigilant environment if the supervisor of elections checks the poll tapes (voting machine results) against the central tabulator report.

For purposes of demonstration, an election was run using [[Leon High School]] as a model. The results of the first hack are shown below.

To show that both the results tapes and the central tabulator could be hacked, Black Box Voting then engaged the services of Hursti to hack the poll tapes. Black Box Voting purchased a card reader from the [[internet]] and Hursti used it to produce counterfeit memory cards, which successfully altered the voting machine results tapes on May 26, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blackboxvoting.org/BBVreport.pdf Black Box Voting Report: Critical Security Problems with Diebold Optical Scan Machine]&lt;/ref&gt;

== One-Step hack==
A fourth trip to Tallahassee was made on Dec. 13, 2005. Black Box Voting and the producers of the film Hacking Democracy organized the test. Attending were Harris and Kathleen Wynne from Black Box Voting, Hursti, Thompson, along with [[Susan Pynchon]] of [[Florida Fair Elections Coalition]] from [[Volusia County, Florida]], and [[Susan Bernecker]], a former candidate for [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]] city council who videotaped Sequoia-brand touch-screen voting machines in her district recording vote after vote for the wrong candidate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.floridafairelections.org/ Florida Fair Elections]&lt;/ref&gt; During his research, Hursti found that Diebold's cards allowed negative votes. Hursti successfully altered the votes using only a memory card, producing a one-step hack that simultaneously altered both the central tabulator results and the voting machine results tapes for matched (but rigged) results. "I would have had no way of knowing," said Sancho. "I would have certified this election."

Three voting machines hacking tests have been performed by Finnish Computer expert [[Harri Hursti]] for the nonprofit elections watchdog group [[Black Box Voting]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blackboxvoting.org Black Box Voting site]  {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5QXAiFRod?url=http://www.blackboxvoting.org/ |date=2007-07-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the producers of the HBO documentary ''''''Hacking Democracy'''''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hackingdemocracy.com hackingdemocracy.com website]&lt;/ref&gt; who filmed it. The first two '''Hursti Hacks''' were set up in [[Leon County, Florida|Leon County]], [[Florida]] with the authorization of Supervisor of Elections [[Ion Sancho]] and these tests examined a [[Premier Election Solutions|Diebold Election Systems]] (DES) Accu-Vote OS 1.94w (optical scan) voting machine. The third Hursti test was conducted for Black Box Voting in collaboration with Bruce Funk, then-County Clerk of Emery County, Utah, on a Diebold TSx touch-screen.
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Accu-Vote Memory Card.jpg|thumb|175px|right|Harri Hursti holding an Accu-Vote memory card.]] --&gt;

==Hursti Memory Card Hacks==
The tests by Hursti were the third (May 26, 2005) and fourth (Dec. 13, 2005) in a series of five voting machine examinations produced by the Black Box Voting group. The first four tests were authorized by Supervisor of Elections for Leon County, [[Ion Sancho (politician)|Ion Sancho]] to ascertain whether votes could be altered on a Diebold voting machine. Tests on Feb. 14, 2005 and May 2, 2005 were conducted on the Diebold GEMS central tabulator by  [[Herbert Hugh Thompson]], who proved that results reports could be altered without a password by using a Visual Basic script. The third and fourth tests were memory card tests performed by Hursti. The fifth test took place with both Hursti and Thompson in Emery County Utah.

During Hursti's first memory card hack on May 26, 2005, he altered the program that creates the "poll tapes", or voting machine results reports. However, this hack would be detected if the supervisor of elections compared the poll tape results with the GEMS central tally report. The GEMS tally report can be hacked to match, as demonstrated during two earlier Black Box Voting projects in Leon County with Herbert Thompson. Thompson successfully manipulated the GEMS tally program using a Visual Basic script. 

The May 26 version of the Hursti memory card hack would require two steps to succeed without detection in a vigilant election setting: Both the memory card and the GEMS tabulator program would need to have matching hacks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blackboxvoting.org/BBVreport.pdf Black Box Voting "Hursti I" Report: Critical Security Problem with Diebold Optical Scan]&lt;/ref&gt; 

During a videotaped meeting in [[Cuyahoga County]], [[Ohio]], DES Research and Development chief Pat Green stated that checks and balances would detect the tampering and that it would not be possible to alter the votes themselves on the memory card.  

However, during the Dec. 13 2005 testing, Hursti successfully altered the votes on the memory card. His memory card manipulations falsified both the voting machine results tapes and the GEMS central tabulator report.  Leon County Supervisor of Elections Ion Sancho stated that he would have had no way to detect the tampering and would have certified the election.

The Hursti memory card hack performed in Leon County on Dec. 13, 2005 is a variation on stuffing the [[ballot box]] prior to any votes being cast. Hursti  had pre-loaded the memory card giving one candidate 5 positive votes and one candidate 5 negative votes to create a "zero report." This keeps the machine accurate in votes cast compared to number of voters.

{{Quotation|"What we are going to do here is modify one card and then bring it to the election provider's Ion Sancho's office, log it has the real card...if in any election as to the real election system and run ballots through and that's the same system which have been used in a number of previous elections...and we'll see that what is the power in the ballot box, this should be an empty box containing the votes but it has more capabilities than that."|Harri Hursti, Tuesday, December 13, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Transcribed from "Hacking Democracy" DVD&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Actual paper ballots were used pre-printed with the following question: "Can the votes on this Diebold system be hacked using the memory card?"

Since Hursti was the [[technical advisor]] he was asked by Sancho to remain outside of the test area. Selection of the voting machine was done by random draw. Machine #15191 was pulled as the random machine.&lt;ref&gt;Transcribed from "Hacking Democracy" DVD&lt;/ref&gt; Hursti only touched the memory card but did not come into contact with any machines. 

Seven participants made out their ballots using the opti-scan paper sheets (Hursti remaining outside the test area). Sancho then went to Hursti and gave him a ballot which Hursti filled out. Hursti then gave Sancho the memory card to insert into the machine. The operation of the machine was explained by Sancho to those in attendance and the card inserted and machine turned on which then produced the "zero total tape." The tape produced zero votes cast. The test ballots were then inserted into the Diebold machine followed by the "ender card" (same size as ballot) was inserted telling the machine to turn off its counting function and start its reporting function. The machine then produced a paper tape with 7 yes votes and 1 no vote.

==Results==
This test demonstrated that Diebold Election Systems made misrepresentations to [[Secretary of State (U.S. state government)|Secretaries of State]] across the nation when the company claimed votes could not be changed on the memory card, the [[credit card]]-sized ballot box used by computerized voting machines. More seriously Diebold Election Systems claimed in writing to state election officials that the Diebold memory cards did not contain any executable code. In fact the memory cards did contain executable code - likened to 'a living thing' inside the cards - and it was this executable code that hacking expert, Harri Hursti, used to defraud the Diebold voting system.

Furthermore, DES wrote a press release referring to the famous vote changing 'Hursti Hack', stating that - "Harri Hursti is shown attacking a DES machine in Florida. But his attack proved later to be a complete sham." In response to the test election, California's Secretary of State commissioned  a special report by scientists at [[UC Berkeley]] to investigate the 'Hursti Hack'. 

The UC Berkeley scientists wrote a [https://web.archive.org/web/20161202140146/https://www.supportthevoter.gov/files/2013/09/VSTAAB-Security-Analysis-of-Diebold-AccuBasic-Interpreter-2006.pdf Special Report On The Diebold Accuvote Voting Machine]. Page 2 of their report states: 

"Harri Hursti's attack does work: Mr. Hursti's attack on the AV-OS is definitely real. He was indeed able to change the election results by doing nothing more than modifying the contents of a memory card. He needed no passwords, no cryptographic keys, and no access to any other part of the voting system, including the GEMS election management server."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.supportthevoter.gov/files/2013/09/VSTAAB-Security-Analysis-of-Diebold-AccuBasic-Interpreter-2006.pdf Special Security Analysis Report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161202140146/https://www.supportthevoter.gov/files/2013/09/VSTAAB-Security-Analysis-of-Diebold-AccuBasic-Interpreter-2006.pdf |date=2016-12-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A spokesman for DES said it was similar to "leaving your car unlocked, with the windows down and keys left in the ignition and then acting surprised when your car is stolen." &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/03/25/AR2006032500805_pf.html Washington Post, March 25, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

The test election was filmed and shown in the conclusion of the Emmy nominated HBO documentary, ''[[Hacking Democracy]]'', which premiered November 2, 2006."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hbo.com/docs/programs/hackingdemocracy/synopsis.html "Hacking Democracy," HBO documentary.

==Examination of the DES TSx touch-screens in Utah==

In 2006, Black Box Voting was invited by [[Emery County, Utah]] County Clerk Bruce Funk to examine the DES TSx touch-screen. Black Box Voting arranged for the services of Hursti and Black Box board member Jim March, who traveled to Utah March 1 and 2, 2006. Hursti discovered numerous security flaws, the most egregious being the ability to reload the entire operating system and the ability to replace the boot loader simply by inserting a memory card with a specific program name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blackboxvoting.org/BBVreportIIunredacted.pdf  Unredacted Black Box Voting Hursti report on TSx]&lt;/ref&gt; Hursti discovered that the system would accept macros in a manner that posed a risk to election security. Jim March opened the case of the TSx and photographed its interior, discovering a hidden SD wireless slot and piggyback connectors under the standard modem, both enabling the machine to be equipped for wireless communications without the knowledge of election directors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blackboxvoting.org/BBVreportII-supplement-unredacted.pdf Unredacted supplement to Black Box Voting TSx report]&lt;/ref&gt;

After seeing how serious the problems were, Black Box Voting engaged the services of Herbert Thompson, then head of the security company Security Innovation, to provide an independent opinion. Both Hursti and Thompson conducted a second series of tests on March 16 and 17, 2006 to confirm findings, which prompted emergency warnings and last minute corrective actions in Pennsylvania, California, and other states.&lt;ref&gt;Technology Daily: States Still Concerned About New Voting Equipment; May 30, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''landlord''' is the owner of a [[house]], [[apartment]], [[condominium]], land or [[real estate]] which is [[Renting|rent]]ed or [[lease]]d to an individual or business, who is called a [[Leasehold estate|tenant]] (also a ''lessee'' or ''renter'').  When a [[juristic person]] is in this position, the term landlord is used. Other terms include '''lessor''' and '''owner'''. The term '''landlady''' may be used for [[women]] owners, and lessor may be used regardless of [[gender identity]]. The manager of a UK pub, strictly speaking a [[#Licensed victualler|licensed victualler]], is referred to as the landlord.

==History==
The concept of a landlord may be traced back to the [[feudalism|feudal]] system of [[manoralism]] ([[seignorialism]]), where a [[landed estate]] is owned by a [[Lord of the Manor]] ([[mesne lord]]s), usually members of the lower nobility which came to form the rank of [[knight]]s in the high medieval period, holding their fief via [[subinfeudation]], but in some cases the land may also be directly subject to a member of higher nobility, as in the [[royal domain]] directly owned by a king, or in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] [[Imperial Village|imperial villages]] directly subject to the emperor.
The medieval system ultimately continues the system of [[Roman villa|villas]] and [[latifundium|latifundia]] (peasant-worked broad farmsteads) of the [[Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faculty.history.wisc.edu/sommerville/123/feudalism.htm|title=Feudalism|author=|date=|website=faculty.history.wisc.edu|accessdate=14 March 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170405034238/http://faculty.history.wisc.edu/sommerville/123/feudalism.htm|archivedate=5 April 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern times, landlord describes any individual(s) or entity (e.g. government body or institution) providing housing for persons who cannot afford or do not want to own their own homes. They may be peripatetic, stationed on a secondment away from their home, not want the risk of a mortgage and/or negative equity, may be a group of co-occupiers unwilling to enter into the ties of co-ownership, or may be improving their credit rating or bank balance to obtain a better-terms future mortgage. 

===Social stigmas of lower-market landlords and tenants in a property-owning culture===
Renters (tenants or other licensees) at the lowest end of the payment scale may be in social or economic difficulty and due to their address or length of tenure may suffer a [[social stigma]].

A sometimes widely promoted social stigma can impact certain for-profit owners of rental property, especially in troubled neighborhoods.  The term "slumlord" / "slum landlord" is sometimes used to describe landlords in those circumstances.  Public improvement money/private major economic investment can improve areas and negate the stigma.  In the extreme government [[compulsory purchase]] powers in many countries enable [[slum clearance]] to replace the worst of neighbourhoods.

Examples:
*In [[Minneapolis]], downmarket landlords vocally and financially opposed a major reform and redevelopment plan of city officials and, in the 2001 election, succeeded in defeating the incumbent mayor and half the city council.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |url=http://www.landlordpolitics.com/landlord.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-06-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160623180446/http://www.landlordpolitics.com/landlord.html |archivedate=2016-06-23 |df= }} Minneapolis Property Rights Action Committee events &amp; adventures&lt;/ref&gt; 

*[[Peter Rachman]] was a [[landlord]] who operated in [[Notting Hill]], [[London]] in the 1950s and until his 1962 death. He became notorious for exploitation of his [[Leasehold estate|tenants]], with the word "'''Rachmanism'''" entering the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''. His henchmen included [[Michael X|Michael de Freitas]] (aka Michael X/Abdul Malik), who created a reputation as a black-power leader, and [[Johnny Edgecombe]], who became a promoter of jazz and blues, which helped to keep him in the limelight.&lt;ref name="Three"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historytalk.org/Tom+Vague+Pop+History/Chp+1.pdf|title=– historytalk.org|author=|date=|website=www.historytalk.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161003054425/http://www.historytalk.org/Tom%20Vague%20Pop%20History/Chp%201.pdf|archivedate=2016-10-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Owner and tenant responsibilities==
A [[rental agreement]], or ''lease'', is the [[contract]] defining such terms as the price paid, penalties for late payments, the length of the rental or lease, and the amount of notice required before either the homeowner or tenant cancels the agreement.  In general, responsibilities are given as follows: the homeowner is responsible for making repairs and performing property maintenance, and the tenant is responsible for keeping the property clean and safe.

Many owners hire a [[property management]] company to take care of all the details of renting their property out to a tenant. This usually includes advertising the property and showing it to prospective tenants, negotiating and preparing the written leases, and then, once rented, collecting rent from the tenant and performing repairs as needed.

[[Image:E9438-David-Berry-monument.jpg|thumb|Being a good landlord, [[David Berry (landowner)|David Berry]] (who had owned much of what is now known as [[Berry, New South Wales|Berry - the town was named after him]]) is well remembered by his tenants.]]

===United States===
In the [[United States]], [[residential]] homeowner–tenant disputes are primarily governed by [[state law]] (not [[federal law]]) regarding [[property]] and [[contracts]].  State law and, in some places, city law or county law, sets the requirements for [[eviction]] of a tenant.  Generally, there are a limited number of reasons for which a landlord or landlady can evict his or her tenant before the expiration of the tenancy, though at the end of the lease term the rental relationship can generally be terminated without giving any reason. Some cities, counties, and States have laws establishing the maximum rent a landlord can charge, known as rent control, or [[rent regulation]], and related [[eviction]]. There is also an [[Implied warranty of habitability#Habitability|implied warranty of habitability]], whereby a landlord must maintain safe, decent and habitable housing, meeting minimum safety requirements such as smoke detectors and a locking door.

===Canada===
In [[Canada]],  [[residential]] homeowner–tenant disputes are primarily governed by [[provincial law]] (not [[federal law]]) regarding [[property]] and [[contracts]].  Provincial  law sets the requirements for [[eviction]] of a tenant.  Generally, there are a limited number of reasons for which a landlord  can evict a tenant. Some provinces have laws establishing the maximum rent a landlord can charge, known as rent control, or [[rent regulation]], and related [[eviction]]. There is also an [[Implied warranty of habitability#Habitability|implied warranty of habitability]], whereby a landlord must maintain safe, decent and habitable housing, meeting minimum safety requirements.

;Residential rental market (tenancies)
Private sector renting is largely governed by many of the [[Landlord and Tenant Act]]s, in particular the [[Landlord and Tenant Act 1985]] which sets bare minimum standards in tenants' rights against their landlords.  Another key statute is the [[Housing Act 2004]].  Rents can be freely increased at the end of a usual six-month duration, on proper notice given to the tenant. A Possession Order under the most common type, the [[Assured Shorthold Tenancy]] (AST) is usually obtainable after eight weeks/two months of unpaid rent, and at the court's discretion after serving the tenant with a [[Section 8 notice]] (under the [[Housing Act 1988]] as amended) for a lesser period for all assured tenancies &amp;mdash; and on other grounds which defer to the landlord's ownership of the property.  If the tenancy is an AST then any possession order will not take effect until six months has passed into the initial tenancy.  A tenancy of someone who has been in occupation since before 15 January 1989 usually, if not a shorthold from the outset following their inception from 1980 onwards, may be a "[[regulated tenancy]]" with many more rights, especially under the [[Rent Act 1977]] and [[Protection from Eviction Act 1977]], introduced by the [[Third Wilson ministry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/11445/138295.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2018-04-12 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180413130952/https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/11445/138295.pdf |archivedate=2018-04-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each [[house in multiple occupation]], a unit the law does not regard it as a single household having more than three tenants, is subject to enhanced regulations including the [[Housing Act 2004]]. A council-issued Licence to be a landlord of such a unit is always required in some local authorities (in others, limited to the larger statutory examples).

;Residential leasehold
Tenancies above a couple of years are normally called leases and tend to be long; if more than 7 years a new leasehold estate must be registered.&lt;ref&gt;[[LRA 2002]], Sch.3&lt;/ref&gt; These are governed by few of the above rules and are in longer examples deliberately more akin to full ownership than tenancies, in general.  They seldom require a sizeable [[ground rent]]. The law has not regulated hefty break/resale charges nor does it prevent the sale of leasehold houses; in the 2010s certain of these proposals have been widely consulted upon and are being drafted.  Broadly, legislation allows such lessees (tenants) to club together to gain the [[Right to Manage]], and the right to buy the landlord's interest (to collectively enfranchise). It allows them individually to extend their leases for a new, smaller sum ("premium"), which if the tenants have enfranchised will not normally be demanded/recommended every 15-35 years.  Notice requirements and forms tend to be strict. In smaller examples the tenant, depending on a simple mathematical division of the building, may be able to enfranchise individually. Statute of 1925 implies into nearly all leases (tenancies at low rent and at a premium (fine, initial large sum)) of property that they can be sold (by the lessee, assigned); reducing any restriction to one whereby the landlord may apply standard that is "reasonable" vetting, without causing major delay. This is often known as the "statutory qualified covenant on assignment/alienation".

In the overall diminishing domain of [[social housing]], exceptionally, lessees widely acquire over time the [[Right to Buy]] for a fixed discount on the market price of the home.

;Commercial (business) leases and tenancies
In commercial property much of the law, especially as to disputes and basic responsibilities, is based on freedom of contract of the [[common law]] including the implied terms of precedent decisions of wide-ranging case law such as the meaning of "good and substantial repair". Implied principles include "non-derogation from grant" and "quiet enjoyment". All businesses which are tenants (lessees) must decide whether to contract in or outside of Part 2 (i.e. II) the [[Landlord and Tenant Act 1954]] which gives them "business security of tenure". If not, it generally applies by default. This "security of tenure" is expressly subject to common reasons and associated mechanisms for a landlord to obtain back the premises.  If a landlord is selling a block and a qualifying tenant occupies more than 50%, the tenant should be given the [[right of first refusal]] at the asking price to buy the block. As in most jurisdictions the law on rigorous adherence to lease terms on unlawful subletting and assignment can be strictly enforced, resulting in financial and premises loss if broken. Failure to repay a rent demand, unlike residential, can result in direct landlord's repossession ("peaceable re-entry").  The taking of a tenant's goods without a court-issued warrant (flowing from a court order or outstanding tax demand) ([[Distress (law)|distress]]) has been banned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/SN04103/SN04103.pdf ''Bailiffs''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180413043651/http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/SN04103/SN04103.pdf |date=2018-04-13 }} Lorraine Conway and Jack Dent.

==Rental investment and basis==
;Incentives and disincentives
The incentive, certainly if not [[social housing]], is to obtain a good rental yield (annual return on investment) and prospect of property price inflation. The disincentives are the locally varying duties of landlords in repair/maintenance and administration &amp;mdash; and keynote risks (tenant disputes, damage, neglect, loss of rent, insurance inavailability/disputes, economic slump, increased rate of interest on any mortgage, and negative equity or loss of investment).  Net income (yield) and capital growth from [[letting]] (renting out) particularly in leveraged [[buy to let]], is subject to [[Idiosyncrasy#Idiosyncrasy in economics|idiosyncratic risk]], which is considered objectively intensified for a highly [[Leverage (finance)|leveraged]] investor limited to a small number of similar profile homes, of narrow rental market appeal in areas lacking economic resilience.&lt;ref name=NYT032913&gt;{{cite news|title=Rental Investment May Seem Safer Than It Really Is|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/30/your-money/investing-in-a-rental-home-isnt-as-safe-as-it-may-seem.html|accessdate=March 30, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 29, 2013|author=Tara Siegel Barnard|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130330081922/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/30/your-money/investing-in-a-rental-home-isnt-as-safe-as-it-may-seem.html|archivedate=March 30, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Basis
Rental properties can be paid for by the tenant on whatever basis agreed between the landlord and the tenant &amp;mdash; more frequently than weekly or less than yearly is almost unheard of &amp;mdash; and which is always included in the lease agreement (preferably for both sides in writing). It should be one of the factors that a tenant considers before moving in. 

;Security for rent and extra fees
{{See also|Security deposit|Landlords' insurance}}
A landlord or its agent can decide to collect a security deposit (and/or in some jurisdictions such as parts of the US, a move-in/administration fee). A deterrent if high and a relative attractive if low in many markets for a tenant, it is rarely debated in pre-tenancy term negotiations. In some jurisdictions either or both are banned in the original sense. Instead a landlord's loss of rent/comprehensive damage insurance may be factored into the rent agreed and/or a special type of deposit, a regulated sum of money as a bond (protected security deposit) from the tenant held by a registered third party (such as certain realty agents) may be permissible.  A deposit is normally by law to be offset against arrears (rent deficits) and damage by or failures to clean/repair by the tenant.

==Licensed victualler==
{{Main article|Pub}}

In the United Kingdom the owner and/or manager of a pub (public house) is usually called the "landlord/landlady", and often, strictly incorrectly, "[[publican]]", the latter properly the appellation of a Roman public contractor or [[Tax farming|tax farmer]]. In more formal situations, the term used is '''licensed victualler''' or simply "licensee".&lt;ref name='Dictionary.com'&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/victualler |title=Dictionary.com |accessdate=2008-07-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090303083921/http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/victualler |archivedate=2009-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A female landlord can be called either a ''landlady'' or simply landlord.

The [[Licensed Trade Charity]], formed in 2004 from the merger of the Society of Licensed Victuallers and Licensed Victualler's National Homes,&lt;ref&gt;{{EW charity|230011|Society of Licensed Victuallers}}&lt;/ref&gt; exists to serve the retirement needs of Britain's pub landlords. The charity also runs three private schools in [[Ascot, Berkshire|Ascot]] and [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]] in [[Berkshire]] and [[Sayers Common]] in [[Sussex]]. As well as having normal full fee paying students, [[Licensed Victuallers' School]] in Ascot provides discounted education prices for the children of landlords and others in the catering industry.

==Landlord associations==

There are significant associations of landlords in various countries. These associations/societies provide support
for their  members in facing a range of issues &lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poavic.org|title=Property Owners Association Victoria|first=Property Owners Association of|last=Victoria|date=|website=www.poavic.org|accessdate=14 March 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180511012941/http://www.poavic.org/|archivedate=11 May 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
by providing a means of mutual support,
and also lobby relevant authorities and parliament with regard to the details and implementation
of residential and some commercial tenancy legislation. 

'''Australia'''

Numerous landlord associations exist in [[Australia]].These associations need to be distinguished from the class of property owner associations that represent
the 'big end of town'   - the owners of major buildings and very large residential
housing complexes, such as the Property Council of Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.propertycouncil.com.au/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-05-10 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160503152012/http://www.propertycouncil.com.au/ |archivedate=2016-05-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This list tracks the support for given candidates among the 716 [[superdelegate|unpledged delegates]] (commonly known as '''superdelegates''') who were eligible to cast a vote at the [[2016 Democratic National Convention]], held July 25–28, 2016 in [[Philadelphia]].&lt;ref name="Vox Bible" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/news/politics/20160624_In_face_of_uproar__Fattah_resigns_effective_immediately.html|title=In face of uproar, Fattah resigns effective immediately|publisher=philly.com|date=June 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/mark-takai-dies-225898|title=Rep. Mark Takai dies after battle with pancreatic cancer|website=Politico|date=July 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 8 unpledged delegates from [[Democrats Abroad]] carry half-votes at the convention, yielding a total of 712 votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://citynews.com.au/2016/the-us-presidential-race-comes-to-smiths-alternative-for-real/|title=The US presidential race comes to Smiths Alternative – for real|website=Canberra CityNews|date=February 26, 2016 |accessdate=June 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unpledged delegates represent about 15% of the overall convention votes (4,767 delegates, 4,763 votes) and come from several categories of prominent [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] members:
* 437 elected members (with 433 votes) from the [[Democratic National Committee]] (including the chairs and vice-chairs of each state's Democratic Party)
* 20 distinguished party leaders (DPL), consisting of current and former presidents, current and former vice-presidents, former congressional leaders, and former DNC chairs
* 191 Democratic members of the [[United States House of Representatives]] (including [[non-voting members of the United States House of Representatives|non-voting delegates]] from DC and territories)
* 47 Democratic members of the [[United States Senate]] (including [[shadow congressperson|Washington, DC shadow senators]])
* 21 Democratic governors (including territorial governors and the [[Mayor of the District of Columbia]]).

Superdelegates are "unpledged" in the sense that they themselves decide which candidate to support. (In other words, they are not allocated according to voter preferences as the majority of delegates are.) Pledged delegates can change their vote if no candidate is elected on the first ballot and can even vote for a different candidate on the first ballot if they are "released" by the candidate they are pledged to. Superdelegates, on the other hand, can change their vote purely of their own volition. With the exception of the eight DNC members from the [[Democrats Abroad]], who each receive a half-vote, all superdelegates are entitled to one vote (including when a sitting official or distinguished party leader is also a DNC member). Throughout this page, those who qualify under multiple categories are considered as sitting officials first, then as DNC members, and then as DPLs (for example, a sitting senator who is also a DNC member is listed as a senator).

The list below is based on the most recent information on how unpledged delegates voted at the roll call vote at the Democratic National Convention in July, 2016.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15885">During [[Josip Broz Tito]]'s [[presidency]] and in the years following his death in 1980, several places in the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] and elsewhere were named or renamed in honor of him as part of his [[cult of personality]]. Since the end of Yugoslavia, many towns and squares have reverted their names. Numerous streets and squares were also named after Tito, both in former Yugoslavia as well as elsewhere as an honour to a foreign dignitary.

==Cities formerly named after Tito==
A total of eight towns and cities were named after Tito. Right after [[World War II]], four municipalities whose role in the [[Partisans (Yugoslavia)|partisan resistance movement]] was perceived as significant gained the adjective "Tito's" (locally ''Titov/Titova/Titovo''), while the capital of the smallest federal republic of [[Montenegro]] was renamed ''Titograd'' (''Tito's [[Grad (Slavic settlement)|grad]]'').  After Tito's death in 1980, four more cities were added, for a total of one in each of the Yugoslav [[SFRY#Administrative divisions|six federal republics and two autonomous provinces]]. These were:
==={{flag|Montenegro}}===
* '''Titograd''', July 13, 1946 – April 2, 1992 – [[Podgorica]],
==={{flag|Bosnia and Herzegovina}}===
* '''Titov Drvar''', 1981–1991 – [[Drvar]], [[Canton 10]], [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]]

==={{flag|Croatia}}===
* '''Titova Korenica''', December 5, 1945 – February 7, 1997 – [[Korenica]] 
==={{flag|Serbia}}===
* '''Titovo Užice''', 1946–1992 – [[Užice]], 
* '''Titova Mitrovica''', 1981–1992 – [[Mitrovica, Kosovo|Kosovska Mitrovica]], [[Kosovo]]{{efn|name=status}}
* '''Titov Vrbas''', 1983–1992 – [[Vrbas (city)|Vrbas]], [[Vojvodina]] 
==={{flag|Slovenia}}===
* '''Titovo Velenje''', October 10, 1981 – July 17, 1990 – [[Velenje]]
==={{flag|Macedonia}}===
* '''Titov Veles''', 1946–1996 – [[Veles (city)|Veles]],  
 
With the dissolution of [[Yugoslavia]], each city was renamed.

==Streets and squares==
Many towns in the countries of former Yugoslavia and in other countries have streets and squares named after him.

==={{flag|Slovenia}}===
* [[Ilirska Bistrica]]: Trg Maršala Tita (main square)
* [[Jesenice, Jesenice|Jesenice]]: Cesta Maršala Tita
* [[Koper]]: Titov trg (main square)
* [[Logatec]]: Titova ulica
* '''[[Ljubljana]]''': Titova cesta (renamed to Slovenska cesta (Slovenian Avenue) in 1991); Titova cesta, a section of Štajerska cesca named after Tito in 2009. After [[Tito street decision in Slovenia]] renamed to Štajerska cesta.
* '''[[Maribor]]''': Titova cesta (main street), Titov most (Tito's Bridge)
* '''[[Postojna]]''': Titov trg (main square),  Titova cesta
* [[Radeče]]: Titova ulica
* [[Radenci]]: Titova cesta
* [[Senovo, Slovenia|Senovo]]: Titova cesta
* [[Tolmin]]: Trg Maršala Tita (main square)
* [[Velenje]]: Titov trg (main square with highest Tito's statue in the world)

In 2011 the [[Constitutional Court of Slovenia]] ruled that naming of a new street after [[Josip Broz Tito]] was unconstitutional. The court unanimously ruled that Tito symbolizes severe human rights violations, and that naming the street after him glorifies totalitarian regime and violates human dignity. &lt;ref&gt; Text of the decision U-I-109/10 of the Constitutional Court of Slovenia, issued on  3 October 2011, in Slovenian language: http://odlocitve.us-rs.si/usrs/us-odl.nsf/o/AB6C747BE8DF7AF3C125791F00404CF9 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Naming Street After Tito Unconstitutional. Slovenia Times, 5 October 2011 http://www.sloveniatimes.com/naming-street-after-tito-unconstitutional &lt;/ref&gt; The decision is highly important, because it was the first time that the highest national court legally evaluated Tito, his work, and his image.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3496">'''Local Public Planning Councils''', '''Local Councils of Public Planning''' or '''Consejos Locales de Planificación Pública''' (CLPP)&lt;!--Google translate, if better/sourced one found please add that and remove this--&gt;, are institutions of [[local government]] in [[Venezuela]] as enacted by the 1999 [[constitution of Venezuela]]. They are a subdivision of [[Municipality|municipal government]] that is [[Unitary government|unitary]].&lt;ref name="city"/&gt; The 335 municipalities in the country are divided into 1,084 civil [[parish]]es. They serve as functions for community control of local services and resources. Due to government functioning on a majority basis, the coalitions that this entails have hindered effective functioning of the process.&lt;ref name="city"/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Hugo Chávez crop.jpg|thumb|right|[[President of Venezuela]] [[Hugo Chávez]], who enacted the new [[Constitution of Venezuela|constitution]] that enabled the establishment of the CLPPs.]]
[[Colonial Venezuela]] led to the establishment of the 23 [[states of Venezuela]] out of the colonial provinces. Since independence in 1821, a variety of states have been merged, culminating in an expansion by three states in the late 1990s. The [[Federal War]] of 1859-1863 between the conservatives and liberals led to [[federalism]] and hindered [[devolution]] as a result of the ensuing ''[[caudillismo]]''. A 1969 [[presidential decree]] led to the grouping of the states into 10 administrative regions and further consolidated the federal government's authority.&lt;ref name="city"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citymayors.com/government/venezuela_government.html |title=Local government in Venezuela |publisher=City Mayors |date=2009-05-01 |accessdate=2013-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In addition to Venezuela under [[Hugo Chavez]], Brazil's [[Lula da Silva]] has also cited the need for change to the elite-dominated system by highlighting an interrelationship between the political and the social fields. In the latter case, this led to "participatory budgeting," which allows for an increase in civil participation of the allocation of local government resources. In Venezuela, however, this involved a further step of providing the tools for civil participation in influencing decisions in regards to daily economic and social welfare as [[participatory democracy]] to address [[social exclusion]] by increasing [[accountability]] and directing more resources to direct representation.&lt;ref name="va"/&gt;

The idea behind the CLPP is to counter a prevailing systemic poverty that had not changed despite [[democratisation]] across the continent. It seeks to maintain a comprehensive [[civil society]] mechanism, an active political culture and enhance opportunities for political participation.&lt;ref name="va"&gt;{{cite web|last=Wagner |first=Sarah |url=http://venezuelanalysis.com/analysis/788 |title=Citizen Power and Venezuela’s Local Public Planning Councils |publisher=venezuelanalysis.com |date=2004-11-12 |accessdate=2013-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also seeks to complement [[representative democracy]] with [[participatory democracy]].&lt;reF&gt;http://venezuelanalysis.com/analysis/788&lt;/reF&gt; It intends to be an engine for direct popular participation at the grassroots level.&lt;ref&gt;Hellinger, Daniel C.

The 'neo' part of neoliberalism indicates that there is something new about it, suggesting that it is an updated version of older ideas about 'liberal economics' which has long argued that markets should be free from intervention by the state.

The definition and usage of the term have changed over time.&lt;ref name=Boas2009&gt;{{cite journal |title= Neoliberalism: From New Liberal Philosophy to Anti-Liberal Slogan |author= Taylor C. Boas, Jordan Gans-Morse |journal= Studies in Comparative International Development |date= June 2009 |volume= 44 |issue= 2 |pages= 137–61 |doi= 10.1007/s12116-009-9040-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an [[economic philosophy]], neoliberalism emerged among European [[Liberalism|liberal]] scholars in the 1930s as they attempted to trace a so-called "third" or "middle" way between the conflicting philosophies of [[classical liberalism]] and [[Economic planning|socialist planning]].&lt;ref name="mirowski"&gt;[[Philip Mirowski]], Dieter Plehwe, ''The road from Mont Pèlerin: the making of the neoliberal thought collective'', Harvard University Press, 2009, {{ISBN|0-674-03318-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|14–15}} The impetus for this development arose from a desire to avoid repeating the economic failures of the early 1930s, which neoliberals mostly blamed on the [[economic policy]] of classical liberalism. In the decades that followed, the use of the term "neoliberal" tended to refer to theories which diverged from the more ''laissez-faire'' doctrine of classical liberalism and which promoted instead a [[market economy]] under the guidance and rules of a strong state, a model which came to be known as the [[social market economy]].

In the 1960s, usage of the term "neoliberal" heavily declined. When the term re-appeared in the 1980s in connection with [[Augusto Pinochet]]'s [[Economic history of Chile#"Neoliberal" reforms (1973–90)|economic reforms]] in [[Chile]], the usage of the term had shifted. It had not only become a term with negative connotations employed principally by critics of market reform, but it also had shifted in meaning from a moderate form of liberalism to a more radical and ''laissez-faire'' [[capitalism|capitalist]] set of ideas. Scholars now tended to associate it with the theories of [[Mont Pelerin Society]] economists [[Friedrich Hayek]], [[Milton Friedman]] and [[James M. Buchanan]], along with politicians and policy-makers such as [[Margaret Thatcher]], [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[Alan Greenspan]].&lt;ref name=Boas2009/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last= Springer|editor1-first= Simon |editor2-last= Birch|editor2-first= Kean |editor3-last= MacLeavy|editor3-first= Julie|date= 2016 |title= The Handbook of Neoliberalism|url=https://www.routledge.com/The-Handbook-of-Neoliberalism/Springer-Birch-MacLeavy/p/book/9781138844001|location= |publisher= [[Routledge]] |page= [https://books.google.com/books?id=M5qkDAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 3] |isbn= 978-1138844001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the new meaning of neoliberalism became established as a common usage among Spanish-speaking scholars, it diffused into the English-language study of [[political economy]].&lt;ref name=Boas2009/&gt; By 1994, with the passage of [[NAFTA]] and with the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatistas]]' reaction to this development in [[Chiapas]], the term entered global circulation.&lt;ref name="Handbook2"/&gt; Scholarship on the phenomenon of neoliberalism has been growing over the last couple of decades.&lt;ref name="Handbookscholarship"/&gt;

An early use of the term in English was in 1898 by the French economist [[Charles Gide]] to describe the economic beliefs of the Italian economist [[Maffeo Pantaleoni]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gide|first=Charles|date=1898-01-01|title=Has Co-operation Introduced a New Principle into Economics?|jstor=2957091|journal=The Economic Journal|volume=8|issue=32|pages=490–511|doi=10.2307/2957091}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the term "néo-libéralisme" previously existing in French,&lt;ref name="OxfordNeoliberalism"/&gt; and the term was later used by others including the classical liberal economist [[Milton Friedman]] in a 1951 essay.&lt;ref name="Burgin2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Angus Burgin|title=The Great Persuasion: Reinventing Free Markets since the Depression|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BnZ1qKdXojoC&amp;pg=PA170|date=2012|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-06743-1|page=170}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1938 at the [[Colloque Walter Lippmann]], the term "neoliberalism" was proposed, among other terms, and ultimately chosen to be used to describe a certain set of economic beliefs.&lt;ref name="mirowski"/&gt;{{rp|12–13}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Oliver Marc Hartwich]], [http://www.ort.edu.uy/facs/boletininternacionales/contenidos/68/neoliberalism68.pdf Neoliberalism: The Genesis of a Political Swearword], Centre for Independent Studies, 2009, {{ISBN|1-86432-185-7}}, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; The colloquium defined the concept of neoliberalism as involving "the priority of the price mechanism, free enterprise, the system of competition, and a strong and impartial state".&lt;ref name="mirowski"/&gt;{{rp|13–14}} To be "neoliberal" meant advocating a modern economic policy with [[state intervention]].&lt;ref name="mirowski"/&gt;{{rp|48}} Neoliberal state interventionism brought a clash with the opposing ''laissez-faire'' camp of classical liberals, like [[Ludwig von Mises]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jörg Guido Hülsmann]], [https://mises.org/daily/6022/ Against the Neoliberals], Ludwig von Mises Institute, May 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Most scholars in the 1950s and 1960s understood neoliberalism as referring to the social market economy and its principal economic theorists such as Eucken, Röpke, Rüstow and Müller-Armack. Although Hayek had intellectual ties to the German neoliberals, his name was only occasionally mentioned in conjunction with neoliberalism during this period due to his more pro-free market stance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Neoliberalism: From New Liberal Philosophy to Anti-Liberal Slogan |author=Taylor C.

During the [[Military dictatorship of Chile (1973–90)|military rule under Augusto Pinochet]] (1973–1990) in Chile, opposition scholars took up the expression to describe the [[Economic history of Chile (1973-1990)#“Neoliberal” reforms (1973–1990)|economic reforms implemented there]] and its proponents (the "[[Chicago Boys]]").&lt;ref name=Boas2009/&gt; Once this new meaning was established among Spanish-speaking scholars, it diffused into the English-language study of political economy.&lt;ref name=Boas2009/&gt; According to one study of 148 scholarly articles, neoliberalism is almost never defined but used in several senses to describe ideology, economic theory, development theory, or economic reform policy. It has largely become a term of condemnation employed by critics and suggests a [[market fundamentalism]] closer to the ''laissez-faire'' principles of the paleoliberals{{who|date=October 2016}} than to the ideas of those who originally attended the colloquium. This leaves some controversy as to the precise meaning of the term and its usefulness as a descriptor in the [[social science]]s, especially as the number of different kinds of market economies have proliferated in recent years.&lt;ref name=Boas2009/&gt;

Another center-left movement from [[modern American liberalism]] that used the term "neoliberalism" to describe its ideology formed in the United States in the 1970s. According to David Brooks, prominent neoliberal politicians included Al Gore and Bill Clinton of the Democratic Party of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;David Brooks, [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/11/opinion/11brooks.html?_r=0 The Vanishing Neoliberal], The New York Times, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The neoliberals coalesced around two magazines, ''[[The New Republic]]'' and the ''[[Washington Monthly]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.jacobinmag.com/2016/04/chait-neoliberal-new-inquiry-democrats-socialism/|title=The First Neoliberals|last= Robin|first=Corey|date= April 28, 2016|website=[[Jacobin (magazine)|Jacobin]]|publisher= |access-date= April 23, 2017|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "godfather" of this version of neoliberalism was the journalist [[Charles Peters]],&lt;ref&gt;Matt Welch, [http://reason.com/archives/2013/03/25/the-death-of-contrarianism The Death of Contrarianism.

===Current usage===
Elizabeth Shermer argued that the term gained popularity largely among left-leaning academics in the 1970s "to describe and decry a late twentieth-century effort by policy makers, think-tank experts, and industrialists to condemn social-democratic reforms and unapologetically implement free-market policies".&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Tandy Shermer, "Review," ''Journal of Modern History''  (Dec 2014) 86#4 pp. 884–90&lt;/ref&gt; Neoliberal theory argues that a free market will allow efficiency, economic growth, income distribution, and technological progress to occur. Any state intervention to encourage these phenomena will worsen economic performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Rise and Fall of Neoliberal Capitalism|last=Kotz|first=David|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2015|isbn=|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|page=12|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet the handbook argues to view the term as merely a pejorative or "radical political slogan" is to "reduce its capacity as an analytic frame. If neoliberalism is to serve as a way of understanding the transformation of society over the last few decades then the concept is in need of unpacking".&lt;ref name="Handbook2"/&gt; Currently, neoliberalism is most commonly used to refer to market-oriented reform policies such as "eliminating [[price control]]s, [[deregulation|deregulating]] capital markets, lowering trade barriers" and reducing state influence on the economy, especially through [[privatization]] and [[austerity]].&lt;ref name=Boas2009/&gt; Other scholars note that neoliberalism is associated with the economic policies introduced by [[Margaret Thatcher]] in the United Kingdom and [[Ronald Reagan]] in the United States.&lt;ref name = "For Business Ethics"/&gt;

There are several distinct usages of the term that can be identified:
* As a [[development model]], it refers to the rejection of [[structuralist economics]] in favor of the Washington Consensus.
* As an [[ideology]], it denotes a conception of freedom as an overarching [[Value (ethics)|social value]] associated with reducing state functions to those of a [[minimal state]].

Sociologists [[Fred L. Block]] and Margaret R. Somers claim there is a dispute over what to call the influence of free market ideas which have been used to justify the retrenchment of [[New Deal]] programs and policies over the last thirty years: neoliberalism, ''[[laissez-faire]]'' or "free market ideology".&lt;ref&gt;[[Fred L.

(Punctum Books, 2016), 3.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Philip Mirowski]], neoliberalism views the market as the greatest information processor superior to any human being. It is hence considered as the arbiter of truth.

The worldwide [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s brought about high unemployment and widespread poverty and was widely regarded as a failure of [[economic liberalism]]. To renew liberalism, a group of 25 intellectuals organised the [[Colloque Walter Lippmann|Walter Lippmann Colloquium]] at Paris in August 1938. It brought together [[Louis Rougier]], [[Walter Lippmann]], [[Friedrich von Hayek]], [[Ludwig von Mises]], [[Wilhelm Röpke]] and [[Alexander Rüstow]] among others. Most agreed that the liberalism of ''laissez-faire'' had failed and that a new liberalism needed to take its place with a major role for the state. Mises and Hayek refused to condemn ''laissez-faire'', but all participants were united in their call for a new project they dubbed "neoliberalism".&lt;ref name="Hartwich"&gt;[[Oliver Marc Hartwich]], [http://www.ort.edu.uy/facs/boletininternacionales/contenidos/68/neoliberalism68.pdf Neoliberalism: The Genesis of a Political Swearword], Centre for Independent Studies, 2009, {{ISBN|1-86432-185-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|18–19}} They agreed to develop the Colloquium into a permanent think tank called Centre International d’Études pour la Rénovation du Libéralisme based in Paris.

Deep disagreements in the group separated "true (third way) neoliberals" around Rüstow and Lippmann on the one hand and old school liberals around Mises and Hayek on the other. The first group wanted a strong state to supervise, while the second insisted that the only legitimate role for the state was to abolish barriers to market entry. Rüstow wrote that Hayek and Mises were relics of the liberalism that caused the Great Depression. Mises denounced the other faction, complaining that [[ordoliberalism]] really meant "ordo-interventionism".&lt;ref name="Hartwich"/&gt;{{rp|19–20}}

===Mont Pelerin Society===
Neoliberalism began accelerating in importance with the establishment of the [[Mont Pelerin Society]] in 1947, whose founding members included [[Friedrich Hayek]], [[Milton Friedman]], [[Karl Popper]], [[George Stigler]] and [[Ludwig von Mises]]. The Colloque Walter Lippmann was largely forgotten.&lt;ref name="JACKSON p=129"&gt;{{closed access}} {{cite journal | last=Jackson | first=Ben | title=At the Origins of Neo-Liberalism: The Free Economy and the Strong State, 1930–1947 | journal=The Historical Journal | publisher=Cambridge University Press (CUP) | volume=53 | issue=1 | date=2010-01-29 | issn=0018-246X | doi=10.1017/s0018246x09990392 |subscription=yes | pages=129–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new society brought together the widely scattered free market thinkers and political figures.

{{quote|Hayek and others believed that classical liberalism had failed because of crippling conceptual flaws and that the only way to diagnose and rectify them was to withdraw into an intensive discussion group of similarly minded intellectuals.&lt;ref name="mirowski"/&gt;{{rp|16}}}}

With [[central planning]] in the ascendancy worldwide and few avenues to influence policymakers, the society served to bring together isolated advocates of liberalism as a "rallying point" – as Milton Friedman phrased it. Meeting annually, it would soon be a "kind of international 'who's who' of the classical liberal and neo-liberal intellectuals."&lt;ref&gt;[[George H. Nash]], ''The Conservative Intellectual Movement in America Since 1945'', Intercollegiate Studies Institute, 1976, {{ISBN|978-1-882926-12-1}}, pp. 26–27&lt;/ref&gt; While the first conference in 1947 was almost half American, the Europeans dominated by 1951. Europe would remain the epicenter of the community with Europeans dominating the leadership.&lt;ref name="mirowski"/&gt;{{rp|16–17}}

==Post-World War II neo-liberal currents==

===Argentina===
{{further|José Alfredo Martínez de Hoz|Domingo Cavallo}}
In the 1960s, [[Latin America]]n intellectuals began to notice the ideas of [[ordoliberalism]]; these intellectuals often used the Spanish term "neoliberalismo" to refer to this school of thought. They were particularly impressed by the social market economy and the Wirtschaftswunder ("economic miracle") in Germany and speculated about the possibility of accomplishing similar policies in their own countries. Neoliberalism in 1960s meant essentially a philosophy that was more moderate than classical liberalism and favored using state policy to temper [[social inequality]] and counter a tendency toward monopoly.&lt;ref name="Boas2009" /&gt;

In 1976, the [[National Reorganization Process|military dictatorship]]'s economic plan led by Martínez de Hoz was the first attempt at a neoliberalist plan in Argentina. They implemented a fiscal austerity plan, whose goal was to reduce money printing and thus inflation. In order to achieve this, salaries were frozen, but they were unable to reduce inflation, which led to a drop in the real salary of the working class. Aiming for a free market, they also decided to open the country's borders, so that foreign goods could freely enter the country. Argentina's industry, which had been on the rise for the last 20 years since Frondizi's economic plan, rapidly declined, because it wasn't able to compete with foreign goods. Finally, the deregulation of the financial sector, gave a short-term growth, but then rapidly fell apart when capital fled to the United States in the Reagan years.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Following the measures, there was an increase in poverty from 9% in 1975 to 40% at the end of 1982.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

From 1989 to 2001, another neoliberalist plan was attempted by Domingo Cavallo. This time, the privatization of public services was the main objective of the government; although financial deregulation and open borders to foreign goods were also re-implemented. While some privatizations were welcomed, the majority of them were criticized for not being in the people's best interests. Along with an increased [[labour market flexibility]], the final result of this plan was an unemployment rate of 25% and 60% of people living under the poverty line, alongside 33 people killed by the police in protests that ended up with the president, Fernando de la Rúa, resigning two years before his term as president was completed.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

===Australia===
In Australia, neoliberal economic policies (known at the time as "economic rationalism"&lt;ref&gt;Pusey, M., 2003. Economic rationalism in Canberra: A nation-building state changes its mind. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; or "economic fundamentalism") were embraced by governments of both the [[Australian Labor Party|Labor Party]] and the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]] since the 1980s. The Labor governments of [[Bob Hawke]] and [[Paul Keating]] from 1983-96 pursued economic liberalisation and a program of micro-economic reform. These governments privatised government corporations, deregulated factor markets, floated the [[Australian dollar]] and reduced trade protection.&lt;ref&gt;Cameron Clyde R ''[http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/lab/86/cameron.html How the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party Lost Its Way] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120803004406/www.historycooperative.org/journals/lab/86/cameron.html |date=2012-08-03 }}''&lt;/ref&gt;

Immigration to the mainland capitals by refugees had seen capital flows follow soon after, such as from war-torn [[Lebanon]] and [[Vietnam]]. Latter economic-migrants from mainland [[China]] also, up to recent restrictions, had invested significantly in the property markets.

In 1955, a select group of Chilean students (later known as the [[Chicago Boys]]) were invited to the [[University of Chicago]] to pursue postgraduate studies in economics. They worked directly under Friedman and his disciple, [[Arnold Harberger]], while also being exposed to Hayek. When they returned to Chile in the 1960s, they began a concerted effort to spread the philosophy and policy recommendations of the Chicago and Austrian schools, setting up think tanks and publishing in ideologically sympathetic media. Under the [[Military government of Chile (1973–1990)|military dictatorship headed by Pinochet]] and severe social repression, the Chicago boys implemented [[Economic history of Chile (1973-1990)#“Neoliberal” reforms (1973-1990)|radical economic reform]]. The latter half of the 1970s witnessed rapid and extensive privatization, deregulation and reductions in trade barriers. In 1978, policies that would reduce the role of the state and infuse competition and individualism into areas such as labor relations, pensions, health and education were introduced.&lt;ref name=Boas2009/&gt; These policies resulted in widening inequality as they negatively impacted the wages, benefits and working conditions of Chile's working class.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[[Peter Winn]] (ed), ''[https://www.dukeupress.edu/Victims-of-the-Chilean-Miracle/ Victims of the Chilean Miracle: Workers and Neoliberalism in the Pinochet Era, 1973–2002]'', ([[Duke University Press]], 2004), {{ISBN|082233321X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pamela Constable and Arturo Valenzuela, ''A Nation of Enemies: Chile Under Pinochet,'' ([[W.

Retrieved December 4, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[Naomi Klein|Klien]], by the late 1980s the economy had stabilized and was growing, but around 45% of the population had fallen into poverty while the wealthiest 10% saw their incomes rise by 83%.&lt;ref&gt;[[Naomi Klein|Klein, Naomi]] (2008).

In 1990, the military dictatorship ended. Hayek argued that increased economic freedom had put pressure on the dictatorship over time and increased political freedom. Years earlier, he argued that "economic control is not merely control of a sector of human life which can be separated from the rest; it is the control of the means for all our ends".&lt;ref name="Chicago Press 1944 p.95"&gt;[[Friedrich Hayek]], ''[[The Road to Serfdom]]'', University Of Chicago Press; 50th Anniversary edition (1944), {{ISBN|0-226-32061-8}} p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; The Chilean scholars Martínez and Díaz rejected this argument, pointing to the long tradition of democracy in Chile. The return of democracy required the defeat of the Pinochet regime, though it had been fundamental in saving capitalism. The essential contribution came from profound mass rebellions and finally, old party elites using old institutional mechanisms to bring back democracy.&lt;ref&gt;Javier Martínez, Alvaro Díaz, The United Nations Research Institute for Social Development, 1996, {{ISBN|0-8157-5478-7}}, pp. 3, 4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F015320-0010, Ludwig Erhard.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Ludwig Erhard]]]]
Neoliberal ideas were first implemented in [[West Germany]]. The economists around [[Ludwig Erhard]] drew on the theories they had developed in the 1930s and 1940s and contributed to West Germany's reconstruction after the Second World War.&lt;ref&gt;[[Oliver Marc Hartwich]], [http://www.ort.edu.uy/facs/boletininternacionales/contenidos/68/neoliberalism68.pdf Neoliberalism: The Genesis of a Political Swearword], Centre for Independent Studies, 2009, {{ISBN|1-86432-185-7}}, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; Erhard was a member of the Mont Pelerin Society and in constant contact with other neoliberals. He pointed out that he is commonly classified as neoliberal and that he accepted this classification.&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig Erhard, [http://www.franz-oppenheimer.de/le64a.htm Franz Oppenheimer, dem Lehrer und Freund], In: Ludwig Erhard, Gedanken aus fünf Jahrzehnten, Reden und Schriften, hrsg. v. Karl Hohmann, Düsseldorf u. a. 1988, S. 861, Rede zu Oppenheimers 100. Geburtstag, gehalten in der Freien Universität Berlin (1964).&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ordoliberalism|ordoliberal]] [[Freiburg School]] was more pragmatic. The German neoliberals accepted the classical liberal notion that competition drives economic prosperity, but they argued that a laissez-faire state policy stifles competition as the strong devour the weak since monopolies and cartels could pose a threat to freedom of competition. They supported the creation of a well-developed legal system and capable regulatory apparatus. While still opposed to full-scale Keynesian employment policies or an extensive [[welfare state]], German neoliberal theory was marked by the willingness to place [[Humanistic capitalism|humanistic]] and social values on par with economic efficiency. [[Alfred Müller-Armack]] coined the phrase "social market economy" to emphasize the [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] and humanistic bent of the idea.&lt;ref name=Boas2009/&gt; According to Boas and Gans-Morse, [[Walter Eucken]] stated that "social security and social justice are the greatest concerns of our time".&lt;ref name=Boas2009/&gt;

[[File:Marshallplanhilfe.gif|thumb|left|upright=0.8|Builders in [[West Berlin]], 1952]]
Erhard emphasized that the market was inherently social and did not need to be made so.&lt;ref name="Hartwich"/&gt; He hoped that growing prosperity would enable the population to manage much of their social security by self-reliance and end the necessity for a widespread welfare state. By the name of ''Volkskapitalismus'', there were some efforts to foster private savings. However, although average contributions to the public old age insurance were quite small, it remained by far the most important old age income source for a majority of the German population, therefore despite liberal rhetoric the 1950s witnessed what has been called a "reluctant expansion of the welfare state". To end widespread poverty among the elderly the pension reform of 1957 brought a significant extension of the German welfare state which already had been established under [[Otto von Bismarck]].&lt;ref&gt;Werner Abelshauser, Deutsche Wirtschaftsgeschichte seit 1945, C.H.Beck, 2011, {{ISBN|978-3-406-510946}}, Seite 192&lt;/ref&gt; Rüstow, who had coined the label "neoliberalism", criticized that development tendency and pressed for a more limited welfare program.&lt;ref name="Hartwich"/&gt;

Hayek did not like the expression "social market economy", but stated in 1976 that some of his friends in Germany had succeeded in implementing the sort of social order for which he was pleading while using that phrase. However, in Hayek's view the social market economy's aiming for both a market economy and [[social justice]] was a muddle of inconsistent aims.&lt;ref&gt;Josef Drexl, ''Die wirtschaftliche Selbstbestimmung des Verbrauchers'', J.C.B. Mohr, 1998, {{ISBN|3-16-146938-0}}, Abschnitt: Freiheitssicherung auch gegen den Sozialstaat, p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his controversies with the German neoliberals at the Mont Pelerin Society, [[Ludwig von Mises]] stated that Erhard and Müller-Armack accomplished a great act of liberalism to restore the German economy and called this "a lesson for the US".&lt;ref&gt;Ralf Ptak, Vom Ordoliberalismus zur Sozialen Marktwirtschaft: Stationen des Neoliberalismus in Deutschland, 2004, pp. 18–19&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to different research Mises believed that the ordoliberals were hardly better than socialists. As an answer to Hans Hellwig's complaints about the interventionist excesses of the Erhard ministry and the ordoliberals, Mises wrote: "I have no illusions about the true character of the politics and politicians of the social market economy". According to Mises, Erhard's teacher [[Franz Oppenheimer]] "taught more or less the [[New Frontier]] line of" [[John F Kennedy|President Kennedy's]] "Harvard consultants ([[Arthur M. Schlesinger|Schlesinger]], [[John Kenneth Galbraith|Galbraith]], etc.)".&lt;ref&gt;Guido Jorg Hulsmann, Mises: The Last Knight of Liberalism, {{ISBN|978-1933550183}}, pp. 1007–08&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany, neoliberalism at first was synonymous with both ordoliberalism and social market economy. But over time the original term neoliberalism gradually disappeared since social market economy was a much more positive term and fit better into the ''[[Wirtschaftswunder]]'' (economic miracle) mentality of the 1950s and 1960s.&lt;ref name="Hartwich" /&gt;

In New Zealand, neoliberal economic policies were implemented under the [[Fourth Labour Government of New Zealand|Fourth Labour Government]] led by Prime Minister [[David Lange]].

The finance markets were also deregulated, removing restrictions on interests rates, lending and foreign exchange and in March 1985, the New Zealand dollar was floated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.TeAra.govt.nz/en/cartoon/33456/floating-the-new-zealand-dollar|title=Reserve Bank - Reverse Bank, 1936 to 1984|last=Singleton|first=John|date=20 June 2012|website=Te Ara Encyclopedia|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, a number of government departments were converted into state-owned enterprises which lead to great job loss: Electricity Corporation 3,000; Coal Corporation 4,000; Forestry Corporation 5,000; New Zealand Post 8,000.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

New Zealand became a part of a global economy. The focus in the economy shifted from the productive sector to finance as a result of zero restrictions on overseas money coming into the country.

The Austrian School follows an approach, termed [[methodological individualism]], a version of which was codified by [[Ludwig von Mises]] and termed "[[praxeology]]" in his book published in English as ''[[Human Action]]'' in 1949.&lt;ref name="Ludwigvon"&gt;Ludwig von Mises, Nationalökonomie (Geneva: Union, 1940), p. 3; Human Action (Auburn, Ala.: Mises Institute, [1949] 1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

The former [[Federal Reserve System|Federal Reserve]] Chairman [[Alan Greenspan]], speaking of the originators of the School, said in 2000 that "the Austrian School have reached far into the future from when most of them practiced and have had a profound and, in my judgment, probably an irreversible effect on how most mainstream economists think in this country".&lt;ref&gt;Greenspan, Alan.

===Chicago School===
{{Chicago school sidebar|expanded=movements}}
The [[Chicago school of economics]] describes a [[Neoclassical economics|neoclassical]] school of thought within the academic community of economists, with a strong focus around the faculty of [[University of Chicago]]. Chicago [[macroeconomic]] theory rejected [[Keynesianism]] in favor of [[monetarism]] until the mid-1970s, when it turned to new classical macroeconomics heavily based on the concept of rational expectations.&lt;ref name=ElgarComp&gt;{{cite book|last=Emmet|first=Ross|title=The Elgar Companion to the Chicago School of Economics|date=2010|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing Ltd.|isbn=978-1840648744|page=133|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The school is strongly associated with economists such as [[Milton Friedman]], [[George Stigler]], [[Ronald Coase]] and [[Gary Becker]].&lt;ref name=Mirowski&gt;{{cite book|last=Mirowski|first=Philip|title=The Road from Mont Pelerin: The Making of the Neoliberal Thought Collective|date=2009|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=0674033183|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 21 century, economists such as [[Mark Skousen]] refer to [[Friedrich Hayek]] as a key economist who influenced this school in the 20th century having started his career in Vienna and the Austrian school of economics.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Skousen. ''Vienna and Chicago: Friends or Foes? A Tale of Two Schools of Free-Market Economics'', (Capital Press, 2005) {{ISBN|0895260298}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The school emphasizes non-intervention from government and generally rejects regulation in markets as inefficient with the exception of central bank regulation of the money supply (i.e. [[monetarism]]). Although the school's association with neoliberalism is sometimes resisted by its proponents,&lt;ref name="ElgarComp" /&gt; its emphasis on reduced government intervention in the economy and a ''[[laissez-faire]]'' ideology have brought about an affiliation between the Chicago school and neoliberal economics.&lt;ref name="FPIF-2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Biglaiser&gt;{{cite journal|last=Biglaiser|first=Glen|title=The Internationalization of Chicago's Economics in Latin America|journal=Economic Development and Cultural Change|date=January 2002|volume=50|issue=2|doi=10.1086/322875|pages=269–86|jstor=322875}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political policy aspects==

===Political freedom===
In ''[[The Road to Serfdom]]'', Hayek has argued: "Economic control is not merely control of a sector of human life which can be separated from the rest; it is the control of the means for all our ends".&lt;ref name="Chicago Press 1944 p.95"/&gt;

[[File:Milton friedman y richard nixon.jpg|thumb|[[Milton Friedman]] and [[Richard Nixon]]]]
Later in his book ''[[Capitalism and Freedom]]'' (1962), Friedman developed the argument that economic freedom, while itself an extremely important component of total freedom, is also a necessary condition for political freedom. He commented that [[centrally planned economy|centralized control of economic activities]] was always accompanied with political repression.

In his view, the voluntary character of all transactions in an unregulated market economy and wide diversity that it permits are fundamental threats to repressive political leaders and greatly diminish power to coerce. Through elimination of centralized control of economic activities, economic power is separated from political power and the one can serve as counterbalance to the other. Friedman feels that competitive capitalism is especially important to minority groups since impersonal market forces protect people from discrimination in their economic activities for reasons unrelated to their productivity.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Milton Friedman. ''Capitalism and freedom''. (2002). The University of Chicago. {{ISBN|0-226-26421-1}} pp. 8–21&lt;/ref&gt;

Amplifying Friedman's argument, it has often been pointed out that increasing economic freedoms tend to raise expectations on political freedoms, eventually leading to democracy. Other scholars see the existence of non-democratic yet market-liberal regimes and the undermining of democratic control by market processes as strong evidence that such a general, ahistorical nexus cannot be upheld.&lt;ref name="WBrown"/&gt; Contemporary discussion on the relationship between neoliberalism and democracy shifted to a more historical perspective, studying extent and circumstances of how much the two are mutually dependent, contradictory or incompatible.

[[Stanley Fish]] argues that neoliberalization of academic life may promote a narrower and in his opinion more accurate definition of [[academic freedom]] "as the freedom to do the academic job, not the freedom to expand it to the point where its goals are infinite". What Fish urges is "not an inability to take political stands, but a refraining from doing so in the name of academic responsibility".&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Fish, [http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/category/stanley-fish/ Academic Freedom Against Itself] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180228071627/https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/category/stanley-fish/# |date=2018-02-28 }}, New York Times Opionator, 28 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Neoliberalism has received criticism both from the political left as well as the right,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title= Higher Degree Research By Numbers: Beyond the Critiques of Neo-liberalism|first1= Timothy |last1= Laurie |first2= Liam |last2= Grealy |journal=Higher Education Research &amp; Development  |volume= 36 |issue= 3 |pages= 458–71 |year= 2017 |url=https://www.academia.edu/31833744/}}&lt;/ref&gt; in addition to myriad activists and academics.&lt;ref name="Neoliberal Hegemony"&gt;{{cite book |last=Plehwe |first=Dieter |last2=Walpen |first2=Bernhard |last3=Neunhöffer |first3=Gisela |title=Neoliberal hegemony : a global critique |publication-place=London &amp; New York |publisher=Routledge |year=2006 |isbn=9780203099506 |oclc=646744326 |chapter=Introduction: Reconsidering neoliberal hegemony |chapter-url={{Google books|kiaxAx5l1QEC|page=1|plainurl=yes}} |access-date=2018-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas Marois and Lucia Pradella posit that the impact of the [[Great Recession|global 2008–2009 crisis]] has given rise to new scholarship that criticizes neoliberalism and seeks policy alternatives.&lt;ref&gt;

===Focus on economic efficiency===
Much of the literature in support of neoliberalism relies on the idea that neoliberal market logic improves a very narrow monetized conception of performance, which is not necessarily the best approach. This focus on economic efficiency can compromise other, perhaps more important factors. Anthropologist Mark Fleming argues that when the performance of a transit system is assessed purely in terms of economic efficiency, social goods such as strong workers' rights are considered impediments to maximum performance, which given the monetization of time means timely premium rapid networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fleming|first1=Mark|title=Mass Transit Workers and Neoliberal Time Discipline in San Francisco|journal=American Anthropologist|date=2016|volume=118|issue=4|pages=784–95|accessdate=|doi=10.1111/aman.12683}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using the case study of the San Francisco Muni, Fleming shows that neoliberal worldview has resulted in vicious attacks on the drivers' union, for example through the setting of impossible schedules so that drivers are necessarily late and through brutal public smear campaigns. This ultimately resulted in the passing of Proposition G, which severely undermined the powers of the Muni drivers' union. Workers' rights are by no means the only victims of the neoliberal focus on economic efficiency as it is important to recognize that this vision and metric of performance judgment de-emphasizes literally every public good that is not conventionally monetized. For example, the geographers Birch and Siemiatycki contend that the growth of marketization ideology has shifted discourse such that it focuses on monetary rather than social objectives, making it harder to justify public goods driven by equity, environmental concerns and social justice.&lt;ref name="Birch Siemiatycki pp. 177–198"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Birch |first=Kean |last2=Siemiatycki |first2=Matti |title=Neoliberalism and the geographies of marketization |journal=Progress in Human Geography |publisher=SAGE Publications |volume=40 |issue=2 |date=2015-03-05 |issn=0309-1325 |doi=10.1177/0309132515570512 |pages=177–198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Harvey (geographer)|David Harvey]] described neoliberalism as a class project, designed to impose class on society through liberalism.&lt;ref name="DavidHarvey"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkWWMOzNNrQ |title=A Brief History of Neoliberalism 1/5 |last=Harvey |first=David |author-link=David Harvey (geographer) |website=YouTube |series=A Brief History of Neoliberalism |access-date=2018-07-07}} Also see {{YouTube|playlist=PLA27CFAD836E1638A|title=David Harvey : A Brief History of Neoliberalism}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Economists Gérard Duménil and Dominique Lévy posit that "the restoration and increase of the power, income, and wealth of the upper classes" are the primary objectives of the neoliberal agenda&lt;ref name="Duménil Lévy 2016 p. 551"&gt;{{cite book |first=Gérard |last=Duménil |authorlink=Gérard Duménil |first2=Dominique |last2=Lévy |authorlink2=Dominique Lévy |editor-last=Springer |editor-first=Simon |editor-last2=Birch |editor-first2=Kean |editor-last3=MacLeavy |editor-first3=Julie |title=The handbook of neoliberalism |publisher=Routledge, Taylor &amp; Francis Group |publication-place=New York &amp; London |year=2016 |isbn=131754966X  |oclc=953604193 |chapter=The crisis of neoliberalism |chapter-url={{google books|id=M5qkDAAAQBAJ|page=PA551||plainurl=yes}} |pages=551–557 |access-date=2018-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economist David M.

Sociologist Thomas Volscho argues that the imposition of neoliberalism in the United States arose from a conscious political mobilization by capitalist elites in the 1970s who faced two crises: the legitimacy of capitalism and a falling rate of profitability in industry. Various neoliberal ideologies (such as [[monetarism]] and [[supply-side economics]]) had been long advanced by elites, translated into policies by the Reagan administration and ultimately resulted in less governmental regulation and a shift from a tax-financed state to a debt-financed one. While the profitability of industry and the rate of economic growth never recovered to the heyday of the 1960s, the political and economic power of Wall Street and finance capital vastly increased due to the debt-financing of the state.&lt;ref name="Volscho pp. 249–266"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Volscho |first=Thomas |title=The Revenge of the Capitalist Class: Crisis, the Legitimacy of Capitalism and the Restoration of Finance from the 1970s to Present |journal=Critical Sociology |publisher=SAGE Publications |volume=43 |issue=2 |date=2016-07-28 |issn=0896-9205 |ssrn=2602893 |id={{OCLC|7374542920|6962223812}} |doi=10.1177/0896920515589003 |pages=249–266}} SSRN Pre-publication is free access {{free access}}; SAGE Journals doi publication is closed access {{closed access}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In expanding upon Wacquant's thesis, sociologist and political economist John L. Campbell of [[Dartmouth College]] suggests that through [[Private prison|privatization]], the prison system exemplifies the centaur state: &lt;blockquote&gt;On the one hand, it punishes the lower class, which populates the prisons; on the other hand, it profits the upper class, which owns the prisons, and it employs the middle class, which runs them.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In addition, he says the prison system benefits corporations through outsourcing as the inmates are "slowly becoming a source of low-wage labor for some US corporations". Both through privatization and outsourcing, Campbell argues, the penal state reflects neoliberalism.&lt;ref name="campbell"&gt;{{cite journal |title= Neoliberalism's penal and debtor states |author=[http://dartmouth.edu/faculty-directory/john-l-campbell John L.

===Global health===
The effect of neoliberalism on global health, particularly the aspect of international aid, involves key players such as [[non-governmental organization]]s (NGOs), the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) and the [[World Bank]]. According to James Pfeiffer,&lt;ref name="Pfieffer UW faculty page"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globalhealth.washington.edu/faculty/james-pfeiffer|title=James Pfeiffer |publisher=University of Washington - Department of Global Health|website=globalhealth.washington.edu|accessdate=2018-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; neoliberal emphasis has been placed on free markets and privatization which has been tied to the "new policy agenda" in which NGOs are seen as being able to provide better social welfare than governments. International NGOs have been promoted to fill holes in public services created by the World Bank and IMF through their promotion of [[Structural adjustment|Structural Adjustment Programs]] (SAPs) which reduce government health spending and which Pfeiffer criticized as unsustainable. The reduced health spending and the gain of the public health sector by NGOs causes the local health system to become fragmented, undermines local control of health programs and contributes to local social inequality between NGO workers and local individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Pfeiffer |first1 = J |year = 2003 |title = International NGOs and primary health care in Mozambique: the need for a new model of collaboration |doi = 10.1016/s0277-9536(02)00068-0 |journal = Social Science &amp; Medicine |volume = 56 |issue = 4 |pages =  725–38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, researchers for the IMF released a paper entitled "Neoliberalism: Oversold?", which stated: &lt;blockquote&gt;There is much to cheer in the neoliberal agenda. The expansion of global trade has rescued millions from abject poverty. Foreign direct investment has often been a way to transfer technology and know-how to developing economies. Privatization of state-owned enterprises has in many instances led to more efficient provision of services and lowered the fiscal burden on governments.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, it was also critical of some neoliberal policies, such as freedom of capital and fiscal consolidation for "increasing [[economic inequality|inequality]], in turn jeopardizing durable expansion".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2016/06/pdf/ostry.pdf Neoliberalism: Oversold?] – IMF Finance &amp; Development June 2016 • Volume 53 • Number 2&lt;/ref&gt; The authors also note that some neoliberal policies are to blame for financial crises around the world growing bigger and more damaging.&lt;ref name="secondthoughts"&gt;[http://time.com/4356816/neoliberalism-imf-globalization/?xid=newsletter-brief Globalization’s True Believers Are Having Second Thoughts]. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]].'' June 3, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The report contends the implementation of neoliberal policies by economic and political elites has led to "three disquieting conclusions":
* The benefits in terms of increased growth seem fairly difficult to establish when looking at a broad group of countries.
* The costs in terms of increased inequality are prominent. Such costs epitomize the trade-off between the growth and equity effects of some aspects of the neoliberal agenda.
* Increased inequality in turn hurts the level and sustainability of growth. Even if growth is the sole or main purpose of the neoliberal agenda, advocates of that agenda still need to pay attention to the distributional effects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessinsider.com/imf-neoliberalism-warnings-2016-5 IMF: The last generation of economic policies may have been a complete failure].

Rowden wrote that the IMF's monetarist approach towards prioritising price stability (low inflation) and fiscal restraint (low budget deficits) was unnecessarily restrictive and has prevented developing countries from scaling up long-term investment in public health infrastructure, resulting in chronically underfunded public health systems, demoralising working conditions that have fueled a "[[brain drain]]" of medical personnel and the undermining of public health and the fight against [[HIV/AIDS]] in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Deadly Ideas of Neoliberalism: How the IMF has Undermined Public Health and the Fight Against AIDS|last=Rowden|first=Rick|publisher=Zed Books|year=2009|isbn=978-1848132856|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Infrastructure===
Nicolas Firzli has argued that the rise of neoliberalism eroded the [[post-war consensus]] and [[Presidency of Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower-era Republican centrism]] that had resulted in the massive allocation of public capital to large-scale infrastructure projects throughout the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s in both [[Western Europe]] and [[North America]]: "In the pre-Reagan era, infrastructure was an apolitical, positively connoted, technocratic term shared by mainstream economists and policy makers […] including President Eisenhower, a praetorian Republican leader who had championed investment in the Interstate Highway System, America’s national road grid […] But Reagan, Thatcher, Delors and their many admirers amongst Clintonian, ‘[[New Labour]]’ and EU Social-Democrat decision makers in Brussels sought to dismantle the generous state subsidies for social infrastructure and public transportation across the United States, Britain and the European Union".&lt;ref&gt;Nicolas J. Firzli, [https://www.academia.edu/26978017/After_The_Neoliberals_A_New_Middle_Way_for_Britain_and_America_Rescuing_Native_Workers_and_Jumpstarting_the_Economy/ The End of 'Globalization’? Economic Policy in the Post-Neocon Age], ''Revue Analyse Financière'' (July 12, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

Following [[Brexit]], the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 United States presidential election]] and the progressive emergence of a new kind of "self-seeking capitalism" ("[[wikt:Trumponomics|Trumponomics]]") moving away to some extent from the neoliberal orthodoxies of the past, we may witness a "massive increase in infrastructure investment" in the United States, Britain and other advanced economies:&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Weltman : [https://www.globalcapital.com/article/b1157nr86h8byh/country-risk-review-2016-populism-is-risky 'Country Risk Review: Populism Is Risky’, Euromoney Global Capital, January 6 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M.

Economic Policy in the Post-Neocon Age', Revue Analyse Financière, Q3 2016 – Issue N°60]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;With the victory of [[Donald J. Trump]] on November 8, 2016, the 'neoliberal-neoconservative' policy consensus that had crystalized in 1979–1980 (Deng Xiaoping's visit to the United States, election of Reagan and Thatcher) finally came to an end [...] The deliberate neglect of America's creaking infrastructure assets (notably public transportation and water sanitation) from the early 1980s on eventually fueled a widespread popular discontent that came back to haunt both [[Hillary Clinton]] and the Republican establishment. Donald Trump was quick to seize on the issue to make a broader slap against the ''laissez-faire'' complacency of the federal government.&lt;ref&gt;M. Nicolas J. Firzli : [http://www.analysefinanciere.org/2017/01/26/understanding-trumponomics 'Understanding Trumponomics', Revue Analyse Financière, 26 January 2017 – Supplement to Issue N°62]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Others such as Catherine Rottenberg do not see Trump's victory as an end to neoliberalism, but rather a new phase of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2016/12/trumping-neoliberalism-steroids-161215144834626.html|title=Trumping it up: Neoliberalism on steroids|last= Rottenberg|first=Catherine|date=December 18, 2016 |website=Al Jazeera|publisher= |access-date= April 20, 2017|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Corporatocracy===
{{main|Corporatocracy}}
Mark Arthur has written that the influence of neoliberalism has given rise to an "[[anti-corporatists|anti-corporatist]]" movement in opposition to it. This "anti-corporatist" movement is articulated around the need to re-claim the power that corporations and global institutions have stripped governments of. He says that [[Adam Smith]]'s "rules for mindful markets" served as a basis for the anti-corporate movement, "following government's failure to restrain corporations from hurting or disturbing the happiness of the neighbor [Smith]".&lt;ref&gt;Struggle and the Prospects for World Government. Mark Arthur, Trafford Publishing, 2003, pp. 70–71&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental impact===
{{expand section|date=July 2017}}
Nicolas Firzli has argued that the neoliberal era was essentially defined by "the economic ideas of Milton Friedman, who wrote that 'if anything is certain to destroy our free society, to undermine its very foundation, it would be a widespread acceptance by management of social responsibilities in some sense other than to make as much money as possible. This is a fundamentally subversive doctrine'".&lt;ref name="Analyse Financière"&gt;{{cite news |first1=M.

Counterpoints to neoliberalism:

* The replacement of a government-owned monopoly with private companies, each supposedly trying to provide the consumer with better value service than all of its private competitors, removes the efficiency that can be gained from the economy of scale.&lt;ref&gt;Katter, Bob (2012) 'An incredible race of people: a passionate history of Australia', (page numbers to be provided)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Even if it could be shown that neoliberal capitalism increases productivity, it erodes the conditions in which production occurs long term, i.e. resources/nature, requiring expansion into new areas. It is therefore not sustainable within the world's limited geographical space.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Jason W. (2011) 'Transcending the metabolic rift: a theory of crises in the capitalist worldecology', Journal of Peasant Studies, 38: 1, 1–46&lt;/ref&gt;
* Social and ecological damages: heterodox economists argue that neoliberalism is a system that socializes costs and privatizes profits. It is thus a system of unpaid costs and avoidance of responsibility. The main solution are seen in social controls of the economy to prevent damages, namely the precautionary principle and the reversal of the burden of proof. This markedly differs from neoclassical and neoliberal solutions that propose taxes, bargaining, or judicial process.&lt;ref name="Berger 2017"&gt;{{cite book |last=Berger |first=Sebastian |title=The social costs of neoliberalism : essays on the economics of K.

According to the economists Howell and Diallo, neoliberal policies have contributed to a United States economy in which 30% of workers earn low wages (less than two-thirds the median wage for full-time workers) and 35% of the labor force is underemployed as only 40% of the working-age population in the country is adequately employed.&lt;ref&gt;Howell, David R. and Mamadou Diallo. 2007.

The Center for Economic Policy Research's (CEPR) Dean Baker (2006) argued that the driving force behind rising inequality in the United States has been a series of deliberate, neoliberal policy choices including anti-inflationary bias, anti-[[Trade union|unionism]] and profiteering in the health industry.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, Dean. 2006.

[[Kristen R. Ghodsee]], ethnographer and Professor of Russian and East European Studies at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], asserts that the [[Triumphalism|triumphalist]] attitudes of Western powers at the end of the [[Cold War]] and the fixation with linking all leftist political ideals with the excesses of [[Stalinism]], permitted neoliberal, free market capitalism to fill the void, which undermined democratic institutions and reforms, leaving a trail of economic misery, unemployment and rising inequality throughout the former [[Eastern Bloc]] and much of the West in the following decades that has fueled the resurgence of extremist [[nationalism]]s in both the former and the latter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ghodsee|first=Kristen|date=2017 |title=Red Hangover: Legacies of Twentieth-Century Communism|url=https://www.dukeupress.edu/red-hangover|location= |publisher=[[Duke University Press]]|pages=xix–xx, 134, 197–99 |isbn=978-0822369493|author-link=Kristen R.

As an example of this, Blakeley says the case of Indonesia demonstrates that the U.S. and Great Britain put the interests of capitalist elites over the human rights of hundreds of thousands of Indonesians by supporting the [[Indonesian Army]] as it waged a [[Indonesian mass killings of 1965–66|campaign of mass killings]] which resulted in the wholesale annihilation of the [[Communist Party of Indonesia]] and its civilian supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Blakeley|first=Ruth|date=2009 |title=State Terrorism and Neoliberalism: The North in the South|url=http://www.routledge.com/books/details/9780415462402/|location= |publisher=[[Routledge]]|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=rft8AgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA4 4], [https://books.google.com/books?id=rft8AgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA20#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 20-23], [https://books.google.com/books?id=rft8AgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA88#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 88] |isbn=0415686172}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Bradley R.

'''The Cavaliers''' was the name given to an unofficial New Zealand [[rugby union]] team which toured [[South Africa]] in 1986, playing the Springbok rugby team.

After the intensely controversial [[1981 South African tour of New Zealand]], which had provoked nationwide protest and worldwide condemnation, the official All Black tour planned for 1985 was cancelled due to [[Finnigan v New Zealand Rugby Football Union|a legal ruling]] that it would be incompatible with the [[NZRFU]]'s legally stated purpose: ''"...the fostering and encouragement of the game of rugby..."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/nz/journals/VUWLRev/1999/32.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090915190622/http://www.austlii.edu.au/nz/journals/VUWLRev/1999/32.html |archivedate=2009-09-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NZRFU injunction cartoon|url=https://nzhistory.govt.nz/media/photo/nzrfu-injunction-cartoon|publisher=NZ History|accessdate=12 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the 30 players who had been selected for the 1985 tour, only [[David Kirk]] and [[John Kirwan (rugby)|John Kirwan]] did not join the Cavaliers. The rebel team were widely believed to have received large secret payments&amp;mdash;a controversial issue at a time when rugby union was still supposedly an amateur sport.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/media/photo/cavaliers-rugby-tour-1985]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cavaliers were coached by [[Colin Meads]], managed by [[Ian Kirkpatrick]] and captained by [[Andy Dalton (rugby union)|Andy Dalton]] and won just one of the four matches against [[South Africa national rugby union team|South Africa]], although they won seven of their eight other games on the tour. Dalton, however suffered a broken jaw in the second match of the tour against Northern Transvaal and played no more rugby that season, [[Jock Hobbs]] assumed the captaincy duties for the test matches against the [[Springboks]] while [[Andy Haden]] did the same for the midweek matches.

It was widely condemned for touring [[South Africa under apartheid|apartheid]] South Africa, and very controversial within New Zealand&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mortimer|first1=Gavin|title=Black gold|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/sep/02/rugbyunion.features|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=12 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; - and there were no future rugby contacts until the [[South African apartheid]] regime ended.

The players found that support for their actions was far less than they had expected. On their return, the NZRFU barred all the players from participating in the next two All Black tests, and instead selected a new group of players. Most of these replacement players were younger, and were quickly dubbed the "Baby Blacks".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Oral History: The day the All Blacks grew up|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&amp;objectid=11662654|accessdate=12 June 2017|work=NZ Herald|date=25 Jun 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Richards|first1=Huw|title=All Blacks rebel tour that created a split with New Zealand public|url=http://www.espn.co.uk/rugby/story/_/id/15286390/all-blacks-rebel-tour-created-split-new-zealand-public|accessdate=12 June 2017|work=ESPN|date=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those new All Blacks went on to form the basis of one of the most successful periods in All Black rugby,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Morrison|first1=Iain|title=Remembering rebel All Blacks tour of apartheid South Africa|url=http://www.scotsman.com/sport/rugby-union/remembering-rebel-all-blacks-tour-of-apartheid-south-africa-1-4115490|publisher=The Scotsman|accessdate=12 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which resulted in many Cavalier players struggling to get their places back.

The '''Norwegian Association of Local and Regional Authorities''' ({{lang-no|KS}}) is an [[employers' organisation]] in [[Norway]].

It was founded in 1972 as a merger between the [[Union of Norwegian Cities]] (''Norges Byforbund'', founded in 1903) and the [[Norwegian Association of Rural Municipalities]] (''Norges Herredsforbund'', founded in 1923).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ks.no/news-in-english/english-articles/about-ks/ |title=About KS|publisher=Norwegian Association of Local and Regional Authorities|accessdate=14 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two entities were also merged between 1942 and 1945, during the [[German occupation of Norway]]. It changed its name from ''Norske Kommuners Sentralforbund'' to ''Kommunenes Sentralforbund'' in 1988, and to just ''KS'' in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Norwegian Association of Local and Regional Authorities|accessdate=14 October 2009|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current director general is Gunn Marit Helgesen. KS' President Gunn Marit Helgesen was re-elected at the KS congress February 17, together with deputies Mette Gundersen and Bjørn Arild Gram. Ms. Helgesen has been the KS President since 2012 and member of the executive board since 2008.

== Executive Board ==
Seven out of 14 representatives are new to the Executive Board. The [[Norwegian Green Party]] is for the first time represented by a representative, while the [[Socialist Left Party (Norway)|Socialist Left Party]] lost its representation. The [[Centre Party (Norway)|Centre Party]] has received three representatives on the new Executive Board, compared to two in previous periods. The [[Conservative Party (Norway)|Conservative Party]] had their number of representatives from three to two, and The [[Labour Party (Norway)|Labour Party]] now holds five representatives.

The Executive Board's headquarters are located in [[Vika, Oslo]].

The '''Nova Scotia Voice of Women''' for Peace (NSVOW) is an active branch of the [[Canadian Voice of Women for Peace]] (VOW). Established in 1960, VOW is a local, national and international feminist Non Governmental Organization (NGO) composed of diverse women with consultative status at the United Nations Economic &amp; Social Council (ECOSOC). For almost 50 years, VOW has advocated a world without war. The organization's mandate is to "provide a means for women to promote world peace and justice, through education of themselves and others to take an equal part in the democratic process of decision making; and to cooperate with women throughout the world to create the mutual respect and understanding necessary for the peaceful resolution of international conflict."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nsvow.org/about-us/ | title=About the Nova Scotia Voice of Women | accessdate=April 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Canadian Voice of Women began in 1960 as a popular social movement opposed to nuclear weapons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/history/EPISCONTENTSE1EP15CH1PA4LE.html CBC Online History of the People - Cold War - Voice of Women]&lt;/ref&gt;   [[Muriel Duckworth]] and Peggy Hope-Simpson were among the founding members of the Nova Scotia Chapter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.peacemagazine.org/v04n5p08.htm Kerans, Marion. "Muriel Duckworth: the Peace Movement's Best Friend" in Peace Magazine, Oct/Nov 1988, pg. 8]&lt;/ref&gt;  Because of concerns raised by the Cold War, the time was ripe for ordinary women to become politically active. As Muriel herself explains it:&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Voice of Women grew out of fear of nuclear testing in the 1950s. Around the country, there were already women on the verge of organizing a women's peace group and when it happened, women poured into the membership, because it was such a dangerous time. The women who had come here as war brides were just beside themselves because they couldn't bear the thought of another war.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rabble.ca/in_her_own_words.shtml?x=30747 Fraser, Sharon. "Muriel: In her own words", Rabble.ca, March 8th, 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Current activities==
Among other activities, NSVOW holds a monthly vigil in [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax, Canada]], and co-hosts an annual Peace Day at the World Peace Pavilion in Dartmouth, NS, Canada on August 6, to commemorate the tragedy in Hiroshima.  Their current campaign includes encouraging Nova Scotia municipalities to join [http://www.mayorsforpeace.org/ Mayors For Peace].

[[File:Hefeflocken Naturata.jpg|{{largethumb}}|Nutritional yeast flakes]]
[[File:Popcorn with Nutritional yeast.jpg|{{largethumb}}|Some theatres offer visitors nutritional yeast for [[popcorn seasoning]].]]
'''Nutritional yeast''' is a deactivated [[yeast]], often a strain of ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'', which is sold commercially as a food product. It is sold in the form of flakes or as a yellow powder and can be found in the bulk aisle of most [[Health food store|natural food stores]]. It is popular with [[vegan]]s and [[vegetarianism|vegetarians]] and may be used as an ingredient in recipes or as a [[condiment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Brown, Elizabeth | url=http://www.smdp.com/singing-the-praisesof-nutritional-yeast/74196 | title=Singing the praises of nutritional yeast | work=Santa Monica Daily Press | date=25 April 2009 | accessdate=7 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a significant source of some [[Vitamin B|B-complex]] vitamins and contains trace amounts of several other vitamins and minerals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Large flake nutritional yeast |url=https://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/foods/show/45360902?fgcd=&amp;manu=&amp;format=&amp;count=&amp;max=25&amp;offset=&amp;sort=default&amp;order=asc&amp;qlookup=yeast&amp;ds=&amp;qt=&amp;qp=&amp;qa=&amp;qn=&amp;q=&amp;ing= |website=USDA Branded Food Products Database |publisher=United States Department of Agriculture |accessdate=26 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes nutritional yeast is fortified with [[Vitamin B12|vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;]].

Nutritional yeast has a strong flavor that is described as nutty, cheesy, or creamy, which makes it popular as an ingredient in [[cheese]] substitutes. It is often used by vegans in place of cheese,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stepaniak|first=Joanne|title=The Ultimate Uncheese Cookbook|year=2003|publisher=Book Pub. Co.|location=Summertown, Tenn.|isbn=978-1-57067-151-7|page=32|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6rTPl_JTVrUC&amp;lpg=PT35&amp;dq=%22nutritional%20yeast%22&amp;pg=PT35#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|edition=10th}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example in mashed and fried potatoes, in scrambled tofu, or as a topping for [[popcorn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wasserman|first=Debra|title=Conveniently Vegan|year=1997|publisher=Vegetarian Resource Group|location=Baltimore, Md.|isbn=978-0-931411-18-2|page=29|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=turX6K-4QFoC&amp;lpg=PA29&amp;dq=%22nutritional%20yeast%22%20popcorn&amp;pg=PA29#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|edition=Revised.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Australia, it is sometimes sold as "savoury yeast flakes." In New Zealand, it has long been known as Brufax. In the United States, it is sometimes referred to as "hippie dust", "nooch" or "yeshi", an Amharic name meaning "for a thousand".{{cn|date=March 2017}}{{Dubious |Yeshi|reason=Yeshi is a female given name in Amharic and does not appear to refer to nutritional yeast|date=May 2018}} Though "nutritional yeast" usually refers to commercial products, inadequately fed prisoners of war have used "home-grown" yeast to prevent vitamin deficiency.&lt;ref&gt;J G Lee [https://www.cofepow.org.uk/armed-forces-stories-list/harukoe-haruku HARUKOE (HARUKU)]&lt;/ref&gt;
Nutritional yeast is different from [[yeast extract]], which has a very strong flavour and comes in the form of a dark brown paste.

== Commercial production ==
Nutritional yeast is produced by culturing a yeast in a nutrient medium for several days. The primary ingredient in the growth medium is glucose, often from either sugarcane or beet molasses. When the yeast is ready, it is deactivated with heat and then harvested, washed, dried and packaged. The species of yeast used is often a strain of ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Industrial Exploitation Of Microorganisms|year=2010|publisher=I.K. International Pub. House|location=New Delhi|isbn=9789380026534|page=6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eqaMzycRTmgC&amp;lpg=PA6&amp;dq=%22nutritional%20yeast%22%20Saccharomyces%20cerevisiae&amp;pg=PA6#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The strains are cultured and selected for desirable characteristics and often exhibit a different [[phenotype]] from strains of ''S. cerevisiae'' used in baking and brewing.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

[[Acetaldehyde]] is the [[hazardous air pollutant]] emitted in the largest quantities from the manufacturing of nutritional yeast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Manufacturing of Nutritional Yeast: National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |url=https://www.epa.gov/stationary-sources-air-pollution/manufacturing-nutritional-yeast-national-emission-standards |publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency |access-date=2018-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nutrition ==

Nutritional values for nutritional yeast vary from one manufacturer to another. On average, two tablespoons (about 30 ml) provides 60 calories with 5 g of carbohydrates (four grams of which is fiber). A serving also provides 9 g of protein and is a [[complete protein]], providing all nine amino acids the human body cannot produce.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} While fortified and unfortified nutritional yeast both provide iron, the fortified yeast provides 20 percent of the recommended daily value, while unfortified yeast provides only 5 percent. Unfortified nutritional yeast provides from 35 to 100 percent of vitamins B1 and B2.

Because nutritional yeast is often used by vegans, who need to supplement their diets with [[vitamin B12|vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;]], there has been confusion about the source of the B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; in nutritional yeast. Yeast cannot produce B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;, which is only naturally produced by some bacteria. Some brands of nutritional yeast, though not all, are fortified with vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;. When fortified, the vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; (commonly [[cyanocobalamin]]) is produced separately  and then added to the yeast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nutritional Yeast|url=http://www.bestnaturalfoods.com/nutritional_yeast.html|publisher=bestnaturalfoods.com|accessdate=14 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=THE 5 STEPS IN MANUFACTURING NUTRITIONAL YEAST|url=http://lesaffre-yeast.com/five-steps.html|publisher=Lessafre Human Care|accessdate=14 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although some [[Vitamin B12#Synthesis and industrial production|species of bacteria]] that can produce B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; could potentially grow along with ''S. cerevisiae'' in the wild, commercially produced nutritional yeast is grown in controlled conditions that would normally not allow those bacteria to grow. Therefore, nutritional yeast is not a reliable source of B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; unless it is fortified.

== Glutamic acid ==
All inactive yeast contains a certain amount of [[Glutamic acid (flavor)|glutamic acid]] because when the yeast cells are killed, the proteins that compose the cell walls begin to degrade, breaking down into the amino acids that originally formed the proteins. [[Glutamic acid]] is a naturally occurring [[amino acid]] in all yeast cells, as well as in vegetables, fungi, and animals, and is commonly used as a flavor enhancer in cooking in its sodium salt form, [[monosodium glutamate]].

==Background==
During [[World War I]], Greece was one of seven countries to occupy Albania, filling the vacuum left after the collapse of [[Ottoman Empire]] in the [[Balkans]] during the [[Balkan Wars]]. Greece claimed parts of southern Albania as "[[Northern Epirus]]", since a sizeable Greek minority lived there. In 1915, Greek positions were occupied by [[Italy|Italian]] troops in [[Gjirokastër]] and [[France|French]] troops in [[Korçë]].

After the disestablishment of the [[Autonomous Albanian Republic of Korçë]], French troops left the area which incorporated in the newly created Albanian state, and the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] reaffirmed the borders.&lt;ref name="Elsie2"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Elsie|accessdate=2013-10-06|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=haFlGXIg8uoC&amp;pg=PR34 |page=174|title=Historical Dictionary of Albania|series=Historical Dictionaries of Europe|volume=75|isbn=978-0-8108-6188-6|publisher=Scarecrow Press|date=March 19, 2010|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, tensions were present in that part of Albanian-Greek border.

==Agreement==
{{further information|Autonomous Albanian Republic of Korçë}}
French troops stayed in Korçë until May 24, 1920. Two days later, on May 26, 1920, after a big rally held at Korçë, and later in [[Bilisht]] and [[Pogradec]], Albanians demanded the incorporation of former [[Autonomous Albanian Republic of Korçë]] into the Albanian state, informing the [[Tirana]] government via local representatives there about the tense situation in Korçë, especially on the border with Greece.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|accessdate=2013-11-05 | page=407| title=Balkan Studies| volume=20| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=UOsmAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=protokolli+kapshtices&amp;dq=protokolli+kapshtices&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=U4x5UoemMeaU0AXzn4DYBQ&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAQ| author=Institute for Balkan Studies, Society for Macedonian Studies| year= 1972| issue=2|issn= 0005-4313}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greek government was waiting for an approval from the British side and would not take any military action in southern Albania without their consent. Considering (allegedly) the recent oil discoveries, and the negotiation for Thrace and [[Dodecanese Islands]] taking place at that time, the British shifted their positioning towards the conservation of the actual border and support to the Albanian state, thus the only way left were the negotiations.&lt;ref name="Mylonas"&gt;{{cite book|accessdate=2013-11-05| title=The Politics of Nation-Building: Making Co-Nationals, Refugees, and Minorities| author=Harris Mylonas| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TOIHbEBhzPkC&amp;pg=PA100 | page=100| publisher= Cambridge University Press| date=April 11, 2013|isbn=978-1-107-66199-8|series=Problems of International Politics}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a quick meeting, made in [[Florina]] between the Greek and Albanian representatives, it was decided on 28 May 1920 to proceed with the meeting in Kapshticë where the agreement was signed and was known as "Kapshtica Protocol", or "Albanian-Greek Protocol of Kopshtica", which would remain in force until the issue would be resolved by the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Peace Conference]].&lt;ref name="Vlora"&gt;{{cite book|accessdate=2013-11-05| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bnsITEI0l4IC&amp;pg=PA137 | author=Ekrem Vlora| title=Lebenserinnerungen: 1912 bis 1925| trans-title=Memoirs: 1912–1925| isbn=978-3-486-47571-5 |publisher= Oldenbourg Verlag|year=1973|page=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tribuna"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.tribuna-news.com/mat.php?idm=616&amp;l=a|accessdate=2013-10-06|title= Pavarësia e Shqipërisë dhe krahina autonome e Korçës|language=Albanian| trans-title=Albanian Independence and Autonomous Region of Korçë|publisher=tribuna-news.com|last1=Prifti|first1=Vladimir|date=2007-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The head of delegations were Josif Koçi for the Albanian side and Achilleas Kalevras for the Greek side.

==Terms==
Both parts declared their friendly relations. The Albanian side proclaimed that it will respect the rights of the Greek communities of the region, including the operation of Greek schools and churches.&lt;ref name=Campridge&gt;{{cite book|last=Mylonas|first=Harris|title=The politics of nation-building : making co-nationals, refugees, and minorities|year=2013|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-1-107-02045-0|pages=100–101|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TOIHbEBhzPkC&amp;pg=PA100 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
From the strategic point of view, this treaty was important for the Albanian state. Not only the southeastern border was temporarily assured, but the Albanian side could gather forces and concentrate on western areas of [[Vlorë]], occupied by the Italians, which would finalize with the [[Vlora War]].&lt;ref name="Dielli"&gt;{{citation| accessdate =2017-09-11 |language=Albanian | url=http://gazetadielli.com/kendveshtrimi-i-sotem-si-refleksion-per-ngjarjen-historike-te-luftes-se-vlores-1920/ | publisher=Dielli | author=Albert Habazaj|date=5 June 2013| title=KËNDVËSHTRIMI I SOTËM SI REFLEKSION PËR NGJARJEN HISTORIKE TË LUFTËS SË VLORËS, 1920

After the Italian-Albanian reconciliation, in August 1920, the Albanian side refused to recognize the validity of the Protocol of Kapshtica. Latter, in 1921 it declared to the [[League of Nations]] that it will respect the rights of the Greek population. However, a Greek minority was recognized only around Gjirokastër, in southwest Albania.&lt;ref name=Campridge/&gt;

{{Politics of Israel}}
The '''provisional government of Israel''' ({{lang-he-n|הַמֶמְשָׁלָה הַזְמַנִּית}}, [[Romanization of Hebrew|translit.]] ''HaMemshela HaZmanit'') was the temporary [[Cabinet of Israel|cabinet]] which governed the [[Yishuv|Jewish community]] in [[Mandatory Palestine]], and later the newly established State of [[Israel]], until the formation of the [[First government of Israel|first government]] in March 1949 following the [[Israeli legislative election, 1949|first Knesset elections]] in January that year.

With the British Mandate of Palestine scheduled to come to an end on 15 May 1948, the governing body of the Jewish community, the [[Jewish National Council]] (JNC), on 2 March 1948 began work on organization of a Jewish provisional government.&lt;ref name="Palestine Israel US State Department Records"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/37211825/Palestine-Israel-US-State-Department-Records | title=Palestine Israel US State Department Records | publisher=University Publications of America | year=1987 | accessdate=October 25, 2011 | author=Nanette Dobrosky | pages=37 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130404082715/http://www.scribd.com/doc/37211825/Palestine-Israel-US-State-Department-Records | archivedate=April 4, 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; On 12 April 1948 it formed the '''Minhelet HaAm''' ({{lang-he-n|מנהלת העם}}, lit. ''People's Administration''), all of its members being drawn from [[Provisional State Council|Moetzet HaAm]] (''People's Council''), the temporary legislative body set up at the same time. The departmental structure of the JNC served as a basis for the interim government ministries.

On 12 May, Minhelet HaAm convened to vote on whether to declare independence. Three of the thirteen members were missing, with [[Yehuda Leib Maimon]] and [[Yitzhak Gruenbaum]] being stuck in [[Jerusalem]], whilst [[Yitzhak-Meir Levin]] was in the [[United States]]. The meeting started at 1:45 in the afternoon and ended after midnight. The decision was between accepting the American proposal for a truce, or declaring independence. The latter option was put to a vote, with six of the ten members present supporting it:

*'''For''': [[David Ben-Gurion]], [[Mordechai Bentov]], [[Moshe Sharett]] ([[Mapai]]), [[Peretz Bernstein]] ([[General Zionists]]), [[Haim-Moshe Shapira]] ([[Hapoel HaMizrachi]]), [[Aharon Zisling]] ([[Mapam]]). 
*'''Against''': [[Eliezer Kaplan]], [[David Remez]] ([[Mapai]]), [[Pinchas Rosen]] ([[New Aliyah Party]]), [[Bechor-Shalom Sheetrit]] ([[Sephardim and Oriental Communities]]).

On 14 May, the day [[Declaration of Independence (Israel)|Israel declared independence]], Minhelet HaAm became the Provisional government, whilst Moetzet HaAm became the [[Provisional State Council]]. The Provisional government was promptly recognised by the [[United States]] as the ''[[de facto]]'' authority of Israel,&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.timesonline.co.uk/tol/viewArticle.arc?articleId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1948-05-15-04-001&amp;pageId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1948-05-15-04 End of Palestine mandate], ''The Times'', 15 May 1948&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Harry S.

'''Queer nationalism''' is a phenomenon related both to the [[gay liberation|gay and lesbian liberation]] movement and [[nationalism]]. Adherents of this movement support the notion that the [[LGBT]] community forms a distinct people due to their [[sexuality and gender identity-based cultures|unique culture and customs]].

== Queer Nation ==
{{main|Queer Nation}}
The homophobic aspect of many cultures has led to increasing frustration and a wish to separate from a perceived hostile heterosexual majority.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3683/is_200007/ai_n8896104/print Rankin, L. P.: 'Sexualities and national identities: Re-imagining queer nationalism' in: ''Journal of Canadian Studies'', Summer 2000]&lt;/ref&gt; These feelings found their expression in 1990 with the establishment of [[Queer Nation]], a radical organisation best known for its slogan "We're here. We're queer. Get used to it".

In 1969, gay activist Don Jackson from California proposed to take over [[Alpine County, California]]—a project also known as [[Stonewall Nation]].&lt;ref&gt;[Donn Teal: 'The Gay Militants: How Gay Liberation began in America, 1969–1971'. (New York: Stein and Day, 1971). pp. 281–298.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first attempt to make territorial claims was made in 2004 by a group of Australian gay activists who declared the tiny islands of [[Cato Reef]] to be the [[Gay and Lesbian Kingdom of the Coral Sea Islands]] and Dale Parker Anderson to be the Emperor. Following the 2005 disagreements within the group, the Gay and Lesbian Commonwealth Kingdom and Unified Gay Tribe have cancelled their affiliation to Anderson. Some other groups with similar causes exist, e.g. the [[Gay Homeland Foundation]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://gayhomeland.org/ Gay Homeland Foundation], based in Cologne (Germany) under the responsibility of Dr. Viktor Zimmermann&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[micronation]] called Gay Parallel Republic.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

In 2007, Garrett Graham published a plan and constitution for a gay state,&lt;ref&gt;Graham, Garrett: The Gay State, New York/Bloomington 3rd edition 2010 (=Graham)&lt;/ref&gt; connected to [[Theodor Herzl]]'s [[Der_Judenstaat|Jewish state]] ("Herzl's words, messages and concepts live on in [...] The Gay State").&lt;ref&gt;Graham, 11&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Pink Panthers Movement ==
The gay rights activist group [[The Pink Panthers#Pink Panther's Movement|The Pink Panthers Movement]] (PPM) in Denver, Colorado as well as their charters/chapters throughout the United States including a large group located in Fresno, California have identified themselves not only as radical and militant, but as queer nationalists. These formed several small parties throughout the United States and Canada that stand in solidarity only to those that identify as supporters of the old Queer Nation.

== Research on nationalism ==
An advanced analysis was published 1996 by Brian Walker.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, Brian: "Social Movements as Nationalisms" in: "Rethinking Nationalism" {{ISBN|0-919491-22-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In his article "Social Movements as Nationalisms, or, On the Very Idea of a Queer Nation", Walker points out that several features of the nationalistic creation of [[cultural identity]] apply to the LGBT national movement as well. Walker classifies queer nationalism as one of the new cultural forms of nationalism which are distinct from the old ethnic and religious types of nationalism and concludes that the gay and lesbian community fulfils many criteria to be regarded as a people for thw following reasons:
* All forms of nationalism began as social movements, which queer nationalism is—a group of people set apart from those around them by in-group attitudes and discrimination from others.
* The gay community has a [[:Category:LGBT culture|culture]], with distinct discussion groups, book stores, magazines, bars, cabarets and other such features.
* It possesses a shared [[history]] and [[literature]].

Walker regards modern communication technologies such as the [[Internet]] as offering a chance for the LGBT community to further integrate as a non-territorial nation.

This thesis is supported by Paul Treanor, who considers an alternative (non-nationalist) world order possible. In this context, Treanor mentions the LGBT community as a "non-territorial nationalist movement".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.socresonline.org.uk/2/1/8.html Treanor, Paul: "Structures of Nationalism" in "Sociological Research online"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051201014431/http://www.socresonline.org.uk/2/1/8.html |date=December 1, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Will Kymlicka acknowledges that gays have developed a group identity and group culture similar to those of ethnocultural groups, but he argues in favor of integration instead of separatism.&lt;ref&gt;Will Kymlicka: ''Can Multiculturalism Be Extended to Non-Ethnic Groups?'' in ''Finding our way: rethinking ethnocultural relations in Canada'' (Toronto: Oxford University Press, 1998), S. 90–101.&lt;/ref&gt;

The park is across First Avenue from the [[United Nations headquarters]]. (This stretch of First Avenue is also known as "United Nations Plaza".) The granite staircase in the park's northwest corner leads to 43rd Street and the [[Tudor City]] apartments. It was built and dedicated in 1948 during construction of the U.N. headquarters and has the famous quotation from [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 2:4: "They shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks; nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more" incised into its wall. Known as the '''Isaiah Wall''', it was rededicated in 1975 and had the name "Isaiah" added under the final word.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ralph Bunche Park|url=http://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/ralphbunchepark/monuments/785|work=New York City Department of Parks and Recreation|accessdate=2012-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981 the staircase was named the '''Sharansky Steps''' in honor of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] dissident [[Natan Sharansky]].&lt;ref name="Historical Sign" /&gt;

In the plaza in front of the Isaiah Wall is ''Peace Form One'', a stainless-steel [[obelisk]] 50 feet (15 m) high, erected in 1980. The sculptor, [[Daniel LaRue Johnson]] (b. 1938), was a personal friend of Bunche, and dedicated the sculpture to Bunche, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Urquhart|first=Brian|authorlink=Brian Urquhart|title=Ralph Bunche: An American Odyssey|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-lsfETlobAkC|accessdate=2010-07-02|year=1993|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc.|location=New York|isbn=0-393-03527-1|page=458}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Near the southern end of the park is a plaque, dedicated in 1990, which commemorates [[civil rights]] leader [[Bayard Rustin]].&lt;ref name="Historical Sign" /&gt;

Because of its proximity to the United Nations, the peace theme of the Isaiah Wall and ''Peace Form One'', and Bunche's career as a peacemaker, the park is a popular site for demonstrations and rallies concerning peace and other international issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=From Tudor City, Protests Against Noisy Protesters |first=Bruce |last=Lambert |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/22/nyregion/neighborhood-report-east-side-from-tudor-city-protests-against-noisy-protesters.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=May 22, 1994 |accessdate=2010-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985 the park was dedicated as New York City's first Peace Park.&lt;ref name="Historical Sign" /&gt; The park covers less than a quarter of an acre (1,000 m²), however, so it cannot accommodate major gatherings.

'''''Random 1''''' is a documentary-style [[reality television]] series that aired from November 2005 to January 2006 on the [[A&amp;E Network|A&amp;E]] cable network. In each episode, hosts [[John Chester]] and Andre Miller travel from town to town, in Miller's real-life, rickety pickup truck ''Jackie'', searching for total strangers who are looking to have their lives changed. However, unlike other such "do-gooder" shows, Chester and Miller employ an all-shapes-and-sizes approach, with assignments ranging from a new cell phone to a week in rehab to a new prosthetic leg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stanley|first1=Alessandra|title=Avoiding the Quick Fix for Those Truly in Need|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/01/arts/television/avoiding-the-quick-fix-for-those-truly-in-need.html|website=The New York Times|accessdate=21 July 2017|date=November 1, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show ran for one season, and premiered to favorable reviews.

The crew abides by a set of rules:  the person being helped must be a stranger, the mission must be completed in one day, and no money may be spent (as Chester explains in Episode 4, "Out Of The Woods", this is because money distances a philanthropist from the person he or she is trying to help. All three of these rules were eventually broken in the course of the season, however). In order to free up John and Andre to get to know the subject of a given episode, they are aided by three producers in an internet-ready mobile RV.  Capella Fahoome, Jim Lefter, and Molly Schrek, once a subject has been decided on, go to their laptops and cell phones, searching for local businesses or individuals willing to help.  Typically, the "street team" and the "RV team" do not interact except over the phone, although this policy, too, has had its exceptions.

Although ''Random 1'' is no longer on the air, the A&amp;E network granted the team permission to present individual episodes as webcasts, which may be viewed on the show's website. DVD sets of the show have yet to be mass-produced, but individual episodes may be purchased directly from A&amp;E.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Random 1|url=http://store.aetv.com/html/subject/index.jhtml?id=cat1620002&amp;parentcatid=cat1620002|website=store.aetv.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212191440/http://store.aetv.com/html/subject/index.jhtml?id=cat1620002&amp;parentcatid=cat1620002|archivedate=December 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of May 24, 2007, there was no planned DVD release of the show itself, however, a feature film adaptation featuring Mark and Normand is touring the festival circuit, having premiered at South By Southwest.  It combines footage from episodes 4 and 10, along with behind-the-scenes footage of the show, and new footage of Mark and Normand's post-''Random 1'' experiences. It is entitled ''[[Lost In Woonsocket]]''.

==Cast==
* [[John Chester]] (scout and co-founder)
* Andre Miller (scout and co-founder)
* Jim Lefter (producer)
* Capella Fahoome (producer)
* Molly Schrekengost (producer)
* Jackie (truck)

==Season 1 (2005-06)==
===Episode 1 - Out on a Limb===
In [[Baltimore]], John and Andre meet Bruce, a homeless, one-legged former construction worker, who is struggling to keep his life together, begging for change while hobbling around on a very outdated prosthetic limb.  The crew attempts to find a prosthetic company willing to donate a $22,000 prosthetic leg.  The Bruce story is intertwined with the story of Kim, from [[Stamford, Connecticut]], a young woman with a comfortable job who wants to do more with her life.  The crew searches for a non-profit agency interested in hiring Kim.

===Episode 2 - Courage to Quit===
Reportedly filmed on a "dress rehearsal" day at the very beginning of production, this episode concerns Cleveland and Gary, an asthmatic builder in need of a new cell phone, and a recovering heroin addict, respectively.  Inspired by John and Andre's life philosophy, Cleveland quits his job as the cameras roll, and shortly thereafter has an asthma attack on the side of the road.  In the meantime, and very much to John's chagrin, Andre has added heroin addict Gary to the mix, packing the four men into Jackie's cab like sardines.    As though all this were not enough, it turns out Cleveland and Gary have more in common than they would have guessed.

===Episode 3 - The Stripper &amp; the Maestro===
In [[Baltimore]], John and Andre meet Amber, a former stripper, and her rodentine boyfriend.  Amber wants to become a model, and the crew sets about finding a model agency that will meet with her, although her domineering boyfriend seems visibly opposed to the idea.  The episode is intertwined with the story of Jan, a [[Huntington, West Virginia]] native, who plays his mostly-broken keyboard on the street for money.  The crew sets about finding him a place that will repair his keyboard.  Though the keyboard was beyond repair,  the gentlemen who promised to repair it gave him a new keyboard instead.

(After the episode aired, viewers learned on the show's website that Jan's cantankerous, alcoholic roommate Mary sold the keyboard to pay for beer and toilet paper.  Viewers responded by making donations towards a new keyboard.)

===Episode 4 - Out of the Woods===
In [[Woonsocket]], [[Rhode Island]], John and Andre encounter Mark, a homeless alcoholic living in a tent in the woods.  Mark has attempted to go to detox in the past, but a $250 deductible is standing in the way.  As darkness falls, the crew is faced with the choice of breaking one of its cardinal rules, by spending its own money, a decision which splits the group in two, and causes the mild-mannered Molly to use an unexpected swear word.  

Additionally, the crew meets Mark's tentmate Normand, who seems to be in even worse shape than Mark, and who at the time is completely inebriated.  John and Andre worry that Normand may seduce Mark back to the woods.  Both John and Andre are concerned about whether Mark will indeed go through with detox, although the ordinarily bubbly Andre is especially pessimistic.

Portions of this episode appear in ''Random 1'''s feature film ''[[Lost In Woonsocket]]'', which has been shown at film festivals.

===Episode 5 - Hope for the Holidays===
While traveling through [[New Rochelle]], [[New York (state)|New York]], the team meets Stephen, an out-of-work chef, about to be evicted from his home.  He is especially concerned about how this will impact his daughter, Asia, who he dotes on.  The RV crew scrambles to line up interviews with restaurants in the area, although it begins to look as though he will have no choice but to leave his apartment.

The team revisited Stephen later that year, the results of which make up the last five minutes of the episode.

===Episode 6 - Johnny Oxygen &amp; the Butterfly===
Easily the strangest episode of the season, John and Andre meet John, a conniving old man with breathing problems (who, despite this, continues to smoke constantly), who needs a stronger air conditioner.  Along the way, they meet Erin, who, like Amber, wants to be a model.  The RV team is flabbergasted at the difficulty of keeping New Yorkers on the phone long enough to make their pitch, and Erin appears as though she might flake out and not show up at all the next morning.  The episode is particularly noteworthy for its inclusion of eccentric modeling guru Candy Ford.

===Episode 7 - Permission to Grow===
This episode concerns Tom and Mary, a [[Baltimore]] couple struggling to open a bar, and Kevin, a young man from [[Providence, Rhode Island]] with a stuttering problem, who wants to go on his first date.  Kevin is ready to go, but his parents are not so excited.

===Episode 8 - Taking the Weight Off===
John and Andre meet Kim, a single mother in [[Louisville, Kentucky]], who is struggling to make ends meet and needs to fix her dryer.  The episode is intertwined with the story of Mike, who is dangerously overweight and looking to get his life back on track.

===Episode 9 - Tough Breaks===
This episode involves Terrence, an [[Akron, Ohio]] native with a fantastic singing voice who was fleeced by a shady producer.  We also meet [[West Virginia]] native and spousal abuse survivor Robyn, who is looking to get a criminal law degree, but has so far not made it through the application process.  The team attempts to get them moving in the right direction.

===Episode 10 - Beyond the Norm===
While watching an episode of ''[[Dog The Bounty Hunter]]'', a man named Timothy saw a commercial for Random 1, and recognized a man he had not talked to in thirteen years—Normand, from Episode 4, his estranged father.  He contacted the Random 1 team, and with his help they, along with a now-sober Mark, returned to [[Woonsocket]], [[Rhode Island]] to search for Normand.  

Portions of this episode appear in ''Random 1'''s feature film ''[[Lost In Woonsocket]]'', which has been being shown at film festivals.
&lt;!-- And believe it or not, Normand isn't a typo.  His name is spelled Normand with a D.  It's a French variation. --&gt;

==Origins==
The project began in 1996 when documentary filmmaker [[John Chester]] joined fitness trainer Andre Miller to seek out strangers for assistance; starting in 1999, the pair began documenting their experiences on film.  

In 2001, three volunteer producers joined the project, initially working out of a basement office. In 2004, the group acquired a customized RV donated by the manufacturer for use as a mobile support center.

[[A&amp;E Network|A&amp;E]] began airing the group's efforts as a 10-episode series in November 2005.

'''Ronald F. Inglehart''' (born September 5, 1934) is a [[political science|political scientist]] and professor [[emeritus]] at the [[University of Michigan]].&lt;ref name="lsa"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Inglehart |first1=Ronald |url=https://lsa.umich.edu/polisci/people/emeriti/rfi.html |website=LSA Political Science |title= Ronald Inglehart| accessdate=27 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://reason.com/archives/2011/05/31/does-disease-cause-autocracy|title=Does Disease Cause Autocracy? |last=Bailey|first=Ronald|date=31 May 2011|work=[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]|accessdate=22 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He is director of the [[World Values Survey]], a global network of social scientists who have carried out representative national surveys of the publics of over 80 societies on all six inhabited continents, containing 90 percent of the world's population. The first wave of surveys for this project was carried out in 1981 and the latest wave was completed in 2014.  Since 2010 Inglehart has also been co-director of the Laboratory for Comparative Social Research at the [[National Research University - Higher School of Economics]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite|url=http://www.hse.ru/en/org/persons/26435728|title=Faculty and Staff, National Research University}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Moscow and St Petersburg.  This laboratory has carried out surveys in Russia and eight ex-Soviet countries and is training PhD-level students in quantitative cross-national research methods.

In the seventies Inglehart began developing an influential theory of [[Generational Replacement]] causing intergenerational [[Value (ethics)|value]] change from materialist to [[post-materialism|post-materialist]] values that helped shape the [[Eurobarometer]] Surveys, the World Values Surveys and other cross-national survey projects.  Building on this work, he subsequently developed a revised version of [[Modernization theory]], Evolutionary Modernization Theory, which argues that economic development, welfare state institutions and [[the long peace]] between major powers since 1945, are reshaping human motivations in ways that have important implications concerning gender roles, sexual norms, the role of religion, economic behavior and the spread of democracy.

==Writings==
Ronald Inglehart's numerous writings have become extremely influential, with translations published in German, Italian, Spanish, French, Swedish, Brazilian Portuguese, Russian, Polish, Croatian, Japanese, Chinese, Vietnamese, Korean, Persian, Urdu and  Indonesian. Brief descriptions of some of his most influential works include:

===''The Silent Revolution''===
In ''The Silent Revolution'' (1977) Inglehart discovered a major intergenerational shift in the values of the populations of advanced industrial societies. In his 1990 book ''Culture Shift in Advanced Industrial Society'' Inglehart uses a large body of time-series survey data from twenty-six nations gathered from 1970 through 1988 to analyze the cultural changes that are occurring as younger generations gradually replace older ones in the adult population. These changes have far-reaching political implications, and they seem to be transforming the economic growth rates of societies and the kind of economic development that is pursued. Economic, technological, and sociopolitical changes have been changing the cultures of advanced industrial societies during the past several decades. Inglehart examines changes in [[religious belief]]s, work motivation, political conflict, attitudes toward children and families, and  attitudes toward [[divorce]], [[abortion]], and [[homosexuality]].

===''Culture Shift in Advanced Industrial Society''===
''Culture Shift in Advanced Industrial Society'' (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1990). Economic, technological, and sociopolitical changes have been transforming the cultures of advanced industrial societies in profoundly important ways during the past few decades. This ambitious work examines changes in religious beliefs, in motives for work, in the issues that give rise to political conflict, in the importance people attach to having children and families, and in attitudes toward divorce, abortion, and homosexuality. Ronald Inglehart's earlier book, The Silent Revolution (Princeton, 1977), broke new ground by discovering a major intergenerational shift in the values of the populations of advanced industrial societies. This new volume demonstrates that this value shift is part of a much broader process of cultural change that is gradually transforming political, economic, and social life in these societies.
Inglehart uses a massive body of time-series survey data from twenty-six nations, gathered from 1970 through 1988, to analyze the cultural changes that are occurring as younger generations gradually replace older ones in the adult population. These changes have far-reaching political implications, and they seem to be transforming the economic growth rates of societies and the kind of economic development that is pursued.

===''Modernization and Postmodernization''===
In ''Modernization and Postmodernization'' (1997) Inglehart argued that economic development, cultural change, and political change go together in coherent and, to some extent, predictable patterns. Inglehart theorised that industrialization leads to related changes such as mass mobilization and  diminishing differences in gender roles. Changes in worldviews seem to reflect changes in the economic and political environment, but take place with a generational time lag. Following industrialization, advanced industrial society leads to a basic shift in values, de-emphasizing [[instrumental rationality]]. Postmodern values then bring new societal changes, including democratic political institutions and the decline of state socialist regimes.

===''Rising Tide''===
Written with [[Pippa Norris]], ''Rising Tide:  Gender Equality and Cultural Change Around the World'' (New York and Cambridge:  Cambridge University Press, 2003) examines how the twentieth century gave rise to profound changes in traditional sex roles. This study reveals how modernization has changed cultural attitudes towards gender equality and analyzes the political consequences. It systematically compares attitudes towards gender equality worldwide, comparing almost 70 nations, ranging from rich to poor, agrarian to postindustrial. This volume is essential reading to gain a better understanding of issues in comparative politics, public opinion, political behavior, development and sociology.

===''Sacred and Secular''===
Inglehart's 2004 book with Pippa Norris, ''Sacred and Secular: Religion and Politics Worldwide'' reexamines the [[secularization]] thesis.  This book draws on a base of new evidence generated by four waves of the [[World Values Survey]] executed from 1981 to 2001 in eighty societies, covering most of the world’s major faiths. Examining religiosity from a broader perspective and in a wider range of countries than have been done before, this book argues that religiosity persists most strongly among vulnerable populations, especially those in poorer nations and in failed states, facing personal survival-threatening risks.  Exposure to physical, societal and personal risks drives religiosity. Conversely, a systematic erosion of traditional religious practices, values and beliefs may have occurred among the more prosperous strata in rich nations. But at the same time, a growing proportion of the population—in both rich and poor countries—spends time thinking about the meaning and purpose of life.  It is argued that in developed countries, the established churches are losing their ability to tell people how to live their lives, but spiritual concerns, broadly defined, may be becoming increasingly important.

===''Modernization, Cultural Change and Democracy''===
Written with [[Christian Welzel]], ''Modernization, Cultural Change and Democracy: The Human Development Sequence'' (2005) demonstrates that people's basic values and beliefs are changing, in ways that affect their political, sexual, economic, and religious behavior. These changes are roughly predictable because they can be interpreted on the basis of a revised version of [[modernization theory]] presented here. Drawing on evidence from societies containing 85% of the world's population, the authors argue that modernization is a process of human development, in which economic development triggers cultural changes that make individual autonomy, gender equality, and democracy increasingly likely.

===''Cosmopolitan Communications''===
Written with Pippa Norris. In ''Cosmopolitan Communications: Cultural Diversity in a Globalized World'' (New York and Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2009) he argues that societies around the world have experienced a flood of information from diverse channels originating beyond local communities and even national borders, transmitted through the rapid expansion of cosmopolitan communications. For more than half a century, conventional interpretations, Norris and Inglehart argue, have commonly exaggerated the potential threats arising from this process. A series of fire-walls protect national cultures. This book develops a new theoretical framework for understanding cosmopolitan communications and uses it to identify the conditions under which global communications are most likely to endanger cultural diversity. The authors analyze empirical evidence from both the societal level and the individual level, examining the outlook and beliefs of people in a wide range of societies. The study draws on evidence from the World Values Survey, covering 90 societies in all major regions worldwide from 1981 to 2007. The conclusion considers the implications of their findings for cultural policies.

===''Cultural Evolution''===
The book ''Cultural Evolution: People's Motivations Are Changing, and Reshaping the World'' (Cambridge University Press, 2018) is an update of the results and theories published in Inglehart's previous books.&lt;ref name="InglehartCulturalEvolution"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Inglehart |first1=Ronald F. |title=Cultural Evolution. People’s Motivations Are Changing, and Reshaping the World |date=2018 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |url=https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108613880}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this book, Inglehart presents what he calls ''Evolutionary modernization theory'', describing how social values and human priorities have developed through history as a consequence of increasing existential security. The presentation is based on [[Longitudinal study|longitudinal]] [[Survey (human research)|survey]] data from more than a hundred countries in the [[World Values Survey]] collected in six waves from 1981 to 2014.
Evolutionary modernization theory holds that economic and physical insecurity elicits an [[Authoritarian personality|authoritarian]] [[reflex]] leading to [[xenophobia]], strong [[Ingroups and outgroups|in-group]] [[solidarity]], [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] politics and rigid adherence to traditional
cultural norms. [[Modernization theory|Modernization]] and economic [[Human development (economics)|development]] has led to a degree of security in many countries after [[World War II]] where people take survival for granted. This has led to decreasing authoritarianism and the rise of ''Postmaterialist Values'': egalitarian norms, secularization, tolerance of foreigners, gender equality, and tolerance of [[divorce]], [[homosexuality]], and [[abortion]]. The existential security and the egalitarian norms that develop under the feeling of security are necessary for [[democracy]] to develop. The freedom of choice in postmaterialist societies also leads to improved happiness. Inglehart now sees a backlash in terms of increasing authoritarianism, political populism, and erosion of democracy as a consequence of the decreasing economic security that follows the growing [[economic inequality]].&lt;ref name="InglehartCulturalEvolution" /&gt;

The '''Science and Technology Select Committee''' is a [[Parliamentary select committees of the United Kingdom|select committee]] of the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]].

The original Science and Technology Committee was abolished upon the creation of the [[Innovation, Universities, Science and Skills Committee]] on 6 November 2007. However, just 19 months later, the government announced that it was re-establishing the committee following the recommendation of the Innovation, Universities, Science and Skills Committee&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parliament.uk/parliamentary_committees/ius/ius_120609_.cfm UK Parliament - MPs call for government to establish a House of Commons Science and Technology Committee following DIUS/BERR merger]&lt;/ref&gt; after the merging of the [[Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform]] and the [[Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills]] in June 2009. The House of Commons approved the re-establishment of the committee on 25 June 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090625/debtext/90625-0011.htm#09062552000004 House of Commons Debates 25 June 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; The committee was officially re-established on 1 October 2009 and has a remit to examine the work of the [[Government Office for Science]].

'''Fort Siallum''' is a defensive [[fort]] in [[Chin State]], [[Myanmar]] built during the British annexation of [[Chin Hills]], [[Myanmar]]. The fort was built by the Chin (Sizang) in the year of 1889 and located near Voklak village in [[Tedim Township]], Myanmar.

On 4 May 1889, The Chin ([[Sizang people|Sizang]] tribe) warriors and the British’s Chin Field Force fought fiercely at this Siallum Fort. A medical officer, Surgeon Captain [[Ferdinand Le Quesne]] of the Chin Field Force was awarded the [[Victoria Cross]] for his gallantry displayed in the battle.

==Background==

When the British Empire annexed Burma in 1885, [[Chin Hills]] did not fall automatically under the British colonial rule. [[Chin Hills]] at that time was independent nations and King [[Thibaw Min]] did not have the authority over [[Chin Hills]]. After the fall of [[Mandalay]], the British then advanced to the Burma's western borders and annexed [[Kalay]] valley in 1886. From 1887, the British administration in Upper Burma started communication with the Chin tribal leaders. The British political officer, Captain F.D. Raikes and the Chin tribal leaders held several meetings. The main discussion was about establishing a trade route to link British territories i.e. [[Myanmar]] and eastern [[India]] through the Chin Hills. The Tashons Chief Pu Con Bik refused to agree to establishing a trade route. Further negotiations failed and the Chin warriors made several raids to [[Kalay]]/[[Kabaw]] Valley. At the same time, the Tashons who were the most influential and powerful tribe in the northern [[Chin Hills]] at that time harbored Prince Shwegyophyu (son of [[Kanaung Mintha]]) who was wanted by the British police for killing two British officers, namely Major J.J. Kennedy (Second Infantry Regiment of the [[Nizam's Contingent|Hyderabad Contingent]]) and Captain H.E. Walter Belville (Assistant Commissioner of Upper Burma) during the [[Burmese resistance movement 1885–95|Chinbyit Battle]].&lt;ref name="C&amp;T"&gt;{{cite book|last1=H N Tuck|first1=B S Carey|title=The Chin Hills Volume 1: a history of the people, our dealings with them, their customs and manners, and a gazetteer of their country|date=1896|publisher=Gyan Publishing House|isbn=978-1236186928}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British administration in Burma then sent an ultimatum to the [[Sizang people|Sizang]] chief to deliver [[Khai Kam]] together with the captives whom he carried off. An ultimatum was also sent to the Fahlam Council to deliver the Prince Shwegyophyu and his followers. When the ultimatums were ignored by the Chin, the British force then launched an expedition known as The Chin Lushai Expedition (1888-1889). The British spent the month of November in 1888 preparing for the expedition. Brigadier-General Faunce arrived in Kanpale with a 1200 strong force and Captain Raikes, and proceeded to establish defensive positions along the valley. A levy of Military Police (later 2nd Battalion of Burma Rifle) guarded the [[Yaw people|Yaw]] valley against the depredations of the Southern Chins. Capt. Raikes and his assistant Mr. Hall collected intelligence about the Chin, their villages and the routes into the hills. Hills coolies were collected in [[Assam]] and sent for the expeditions. The forces for expedition were gathered at Kanpale (Stockade No.1) and Gurkha 42nd Battalion was added to the expedition.&lt;ref name="C&amp;T" /&gt;

The strategy was to first march against the northern [[Chin Hills]] of [[Sizang people|Sizang]] valley. There was no road to the hills at that time, therefore, a mule track had to be constructed by the British expeditionary force. By the beginning of December 1888, the mule track was completed, and led until the foot of the hill, where there they established No.2 Stockade i.e. Zawlkin (now [[Khai Kam]] Town). The road construction continued towards the hills and reached Phatzang where a rough No.3 stockade was established.&lt;ref name="C&amp;T" /&gt;

On hearing the news of the British advance, the [[Sizang people|Sizang]] council then sent [[Khai Kam]] of Khuasak to [[Tedim]] to meet Khaw Cin (the chief of Kamhau). The next day a Chin force consisting of 1630 [1,200 ([[Sizang people|Sizang]]), 400 (Kamhau) and 30 ([[Sukte people|Sukte]]) prepared to defend their motherland.&lt;ref name="Zo History by Dr.Vum Son"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Son|first1=Dr.Vum|title=Zo History|date=2011|publisher=Authour|location=Aizawl, India}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tashon also gathered warriors from her powerful neighboring tribes. On 7 December 1888, the [[Sizang people|Sizang]] started their offensive by attacking the road constructors. On 24 December, the [[Sizang people|Sizang]] again attacked the road working party and killed a sepoy. On Christmas day, the combined forces of [[Sizang people|Sizang]], Kamhau an Sukte attacked the working party under command of Lt. Butcher of 42 Gurkha Bn. The Sizang were in constant co-ordination with the Tashons. On 10 December 1888, the great force of Tashon made a simultaneous attack on the villages of Sihaung, Kyawywa and Kundu. At the same time, 80 Tashons warriors clashed head to head with 42nd Gurkha Light infantry led by Capt. Westmoreland. On the same day, the [[Sizang people|Sizang]] attacked Indin and a combined force of Sukte and Kamhau attacked the military post at Kangyi (20miles north of [[Kalemyo]]). The Chins showed their planning abilities and military capabilities in this simultaneous attack to the various British positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=File No. Acc 2714|year=1889|publisher=National Archives Department, Rangoon|location=Yangon, Myanmar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British officers were impressed by the Chin capabilities as "'''the Chins were in great force, and we now know that Tashons and Siyins (Sizang) were fighting side by side on this occasion. The Chins swooped down from the heights on to the party, which was working on a narrow spur, and attacked them from all four sides, fighting under cover of heavy undergrowth. The collies bolted and the troops fell back after holding their ground some little time. Whilst disputing every stage of our advance into their hills, the Chins showed considerable tactical ability by taking the offensive in the plains and attacking Shan villages and our posts in the rear of advancing column'''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Chin Hills|last1=H N Tuck|first1=B S Carey|publisher=Gyan Publishing House|year=|isbn=9788121201919|location=|page=27|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chin – Lushai Expedition (1888 - 1889)==
Since the Chin showed their military prowess by inflicting some losses on the invading forces, the British Army took the Chin seriously. General [[George White (British Army officer)|Sir. George White]] Commander-in-Chief of Burma, personally went to supervise the expedition. He arrived in Kanpale (near [[Kalaymyo]]) on 30 December 1888 and joined the expedition force. The Chin warriors built a stockade at Leisan Mual (Red Rocky Gate) and stood firm. On 27 January 1889, the Chin warriors attacked the road workers and the British sent their troops to engage the Chin warriors. The Chin warriors gave strong resistance but the superior British fire power forced the Chin warriors to retreat. The Chin warriors then stood firm at Leisen Mual stockade which was the last line of defence. The British couldn’t take the stockade initially, so reinforcements were ordered and the British charged the stockade again and the stockade fell. As the last line of defence was breached by the superior British force, the door to the Sizang valley was wide open. The British forces marched to Leisang range, from where they could see the villages within [[Sizang people|Sizang]] valley. General [[George White (British Army officer)|Sir. George White]] described his experience of the battles with the Chin as "Enemy yesterday attacked our working 1 party on road above this and held our covering party, 40 British and loo Gurkhas, from 9 till 3, when I arrived and ordered their positions to be charged. We carried all, driving them entirely away, getting off ourselves wonderfully cheaply. Only one Norfolk dangerously wounded. Enemy in considerable numbers, using many rifles and plenty ammunition. They fired at least 1,000  rounds, standing resolutely until actually charged, even trying to outflank us. Their loss probably about eight or ten, but they were carried down the khuds at once. '''Most difficult enemy to see or hit 1 ever fought'''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=H N Tuck|first1=B S Carey|title=The Chin Hills|publisher=Gyan Publishing House|isbn=9788121201919|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The battle at Leisen Mual was a serious blow to the Chin and they realized that it was impossible to save their villages. The leader Pu [[Khai Kam]] then burned his capital Khuasak before the arrival of the British, then moved to the jungle to start Guerrilla warfare. At the same time, the Chin warriors of the [[Sizang people|Sizang]], Kamhau, Sukte and Khuano were assembling at Buanman. The British saw the assembly and they fired their artillery at Buanman. The cannon balls exploded spectacularly, leading the Chin to realise that they fought a far superior force and they lost the heart to resist. By February 1889, the British captured Khuasak, Buanman and Thuklai. A military post [[Fort White, Burma|Fort White]] was established in honour of General George White. The British expedition force then burned the whole of Sizang villages as Carey &amp; Tuck wrote in the Chin Hills: '''''by 6 March 1889, not a single Sizang village remained in existence. The destruction of Sizang villages was accomplished with a good deal of firing, but very little damage to life and limb'''''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=H N Tuck|first1=B S Carey|title=The Chin Hills|publisher=Gyan Publishing House|isbn=9788121201919|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Chin people were beaten by a far superior force and driven out of their villages, they showed no sign of surrender and attacked British posts whenever they had an opportunity.  They ambushed British posts, cut telegraph cables and stole cattle from the British whenever possible. The Sizang resisted the British from the forest for two years.

==The Battle of Siallum==

The [[Sizang people|Sizang]] warriors learned that they were not able to defeat British forces when fighting in the open, or from behind stockades. As they could not withstand the charges of British and Gurkha troops the Sizang warrior tried a different tactic which involved fighting from covered-in trenches. The Sizang warriors built a [[fort]] which was basically trenches which were all covered-in by leaves and wood. This fort was built at Siallum. In 1890, Siallum was a settlement of about 30 houses in which about 100 persons of the Buanman clan lived. "'''Sial'''" means the head (the toughest part) of a mithun and "'''Lum'''" means Fort. The Siallum fort consists of "'''Kulhpi'''", "'''Kulh Peang'''" and "'''Nupi Kulh'''". "'''Khulhpi'''" is the main fort where the Sizang warriors took position and fire upon the arrive of the British’s Chin Field Force. "'''Kulhpeang'''" was built for the spirit agent (or) medium Pu En Khawm and family. "'''Nupi Kulh'''" was built for elders, children and women. At the time of the fighting, about 80 women and children were hiding in this Nupi Kulh. The Sizang also built a watch tower known as "'''Ngalvildum'''" at a place called Nalum Mual.&lt;ref name="U On Lian Khai (Voklak)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Khai (Voklak)|first1=U On Lian|title=The Siallum Fort|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Siallum Fort - Nupi Kulh.jpg|thumb|left|Siallum Fort - Nupi Kulh Fort where women, children and elders hide during the Battle of Siallum]]

The British forces stationed at Fort White started noticing some new huts at the site of Taitan. The British called it Taitan village but it was known by the [[Sizang people|Sizang]] as Siallum. To destroy this, Brigadier General Faunce assembled a column consisting of 65 rifles of the 2nd Battalion Norfolk Regiment and 60 rifles of the 42nd Gurkha Light Infantry. This column is also known as the Chin Field Force and was led by Captain C. H. Westmoreland of the 42nd Gurkha Light Infantry. The column marched from Fort White – Buanman – Mualsan – Ngumpi – Nalum - Taikhe then began the approach to Siallum (Taitan) village. The approach of the column was first noticed by the Sizang dogs (fox-terrier). Pu Zong On who was on duty at the watch tower at Nalum Mual also spotted the British column. He then ran to the village and informed the villagers.&lt;ref name="U On Lian Khai (Voklak)" /&gt; The whole village was then evacuated to the fort. The non-combatant families, women, children and elders were then to hide in the fort. The Sizang warriors also took up positions and were readied for the battle. When the British column arrived at Siallum (Taitan) village, the village was empty and quiet. The following is an account of the battle given by Captain Westmoreland of the 42nd Gurkha Light Infantry Battalion:

"'''''The column, consisting of 65 rifles of the 2nd Battalion Norfolk Regiment and 60 rifles of the 42nd Gurkha Light Infantry, occupied the heights above New Tartan [Siallum] without opposition. The main body advanced with the intention of rushing the village, but encountered determined resistance from the Chins, who were strongly posted in two stockades. The upper stockade consisted of a log-hut, the sides and roof of which were bullet-proof. It was connected with a ravine to the east by a trench about 3 feet wide, 5 feet deep, and 20 yards long. The trench was covered with logs and planks flush with the ground. The hut itself was surrounded at a distance of 5 or 6 yards with rows of sharp-pointed stakes about 3 feet high. The second stockade was in the bed of the ravine. It consisted of a hole about 6 or 9 feet square, from which a trench ran down the ravine. Both trench and hole were covered with logs and planks and were bullet-proof. In both stockades there were a few spaces between the logs through which the Chins fired, and the only way in which they could be carried was by pulling away some of the timber. At the lower stockade, early in the action, Second-Lieutenant Michel fell mortally wounded. The troops at first endeavored to turn out the defenders of the upper stockade by firing through the openings between the logs. Before long the covered trench was noticed and pulled open and the Chins in it were shot. After accomplishing this under fire from the Chins in the lower stockade and in the neighbouring jungle, the column retired, burning the village as it went. The Chins, who had suffered heavily, did not follow, being deterred by the loss which they had sustained and kept in check by a small covering party on the heights. In this action our loss was one officer killed and two (Captain Mayne and Surgeon [[Ferdinand Le Quesne]]) severely wounded and three men killed and eight wounded. [[Ferdinand Le Quesne]] received the [[Victoria Cross]] for conspicuous coolness and gallantry displayed whilst dressing Lieutenant Michel‘s wound'''''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=H N Tuck|first1=B S Carey|title=The Chin Hills|publisher=Gyan Publishing House|isbn=9788121201919|pages=30–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Captain Westmoreland also reported the details of the battle to Gen. Faunce who in turn reported to the Chief Secretary to the Chief Commissioner of Burma. Gen. Faunce's telegram reads as follows: Begins: ''323 C.F., Fort White, May 5th 1889. A new Siyin village near site of Tartan [Siallum], south-east of this, having been seen from Sagyilain by party referred to in my 320C.F., I sent 65 Rifles, Norfolk, 60 Rifles, 42nd, under Major Shepherd, Norfolk, yesterday to destroy new Tartan [Siallum] which consisted of 15 houses. No opposition till after troops entered village, at bottom of which two very strong stockades, flanking each other and connected by covered way with plank-roof. Siyin Chins held their fire till troops were within 50 yards. They stood their ground and fought with great pluck, eight being killed with the bayonet. In the first stockade their loss was 30 killed and many wounded. I regret our loss was heavy''&lt;ref name="VKH"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hau|first1=Dr. Vum Kho|title=A Profile of Burma Frontier Man|date=1963|publisher=Vum Kho Hau|location=Rangoon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Siallum Fort - (Kulhbaan and Kulhpeang).jpg|thumb|Siallum Fort, the trenches and the fort known as Kulhpeang]]
The secretary of the Chief Commissioner then replied "''YOUR No. 1283. Chief Commissioner (Sir Charles Crosthwaite, K.C.S.I.) will be glad to know whether it is to be understood that the attack was successful and that both stockades were taken and the village destroyed''".&lt;ref name="VKH" /&gt;

Political officer Major F.D. Raikes then replied to the Chief Secretary to the Chief Commissioner, Burma on 15 May 1889 "''New village of Taitan [Siallum] was destroyed, but one stockade was not taken as Officer Commanding Force considered if there were further casualty’s column could not return to Fort White that night and no arrangements made for camping out''".&lt;ref name="VKH" /&gt;

The Chin Field Force did not destroy the fort nor defeat the Chin warriors. The Chin warriors did not give up fighting, despite the heavy losses. As the British column had also sustained casualties, Capt. Westmoreland decided to retreat back to Fort White. The Chin warriors did not chase them down as they had also suffered heavy casualties. At the time of the British retreat, at least 40 Chin warriors were still shooting at the retreating column. Capt. Westmoreland then razed the newly built village, Siallum, to ashes on his way back to Fort White. Immediately after the battle of Siallum, Brigadier General Faunce was replaced by General Symons on 9 May 1889.&lt;ref name="TZD"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dal|first1=Thang Za|title=The Chin/Zo people of Bangladesh, Burma and India|date=2010|publisher=Thang Za Dal|location=Germany}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the battle on 4 May, the Chin warriors repaired Siallum fort and made ready for another round of assault. Gen. Symons then led a column to the fort on 10 May 1889 and defeated the Chin. The Siallum fort was completely destroyed and burnt. The details of Gen. Symons operation was reported as follows: "''Following from General Officer Commanding Chin Field Force. Begins: May 10th. Party 150 Rifles, Norfolk, and 42nd Gurkhas, under Brigadier-General Symons visited TAITAN, scene of fight on 4th May, yesterday. Were unopposed though signal shots were fired. Found many graves and several bodies were buried in enemy‘s trenches. Siyin Chins repaired stockade which was all completely destroyed and burnt''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=NO.1488|last1=Telegram from the District Staff Officer, Burma; to the Chief Secretary to the Chief Commissioner, Burma|first=|date=1889|publisher=National Archive Department|year=|isbn=|location=Yangon, Myanmar|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honour==

Pu Pau Thual who was at the battle in defending the Siallum fort compose the following poem/song:

:Bodies of relatives and enemy
:Were heaped like logs on one another
:Bodies of relatives served as my fort
:And called the heroic names of my clansmen as I killed the enemy

The following poem was composed by the late Rev. T. Hau Go Sukte in honour of the heroines and heroes of the Battle of Siallum. This poem is still in displayed at the site of the fort.

:'''SIALLUM FORTRESS'''

:Mark ye well this honoured spot,
:Stained with blood of heroes slain;
:They to keep our ancient lot,
:Fought a horde from Great Britain.
:Mark ye, too th’historic date,
:Eighteen eighty nine May fourth;
:They their precious blood poured forth;
:When for us who born of late,
:They their precious blood poured forth;
:Sowed the seed of liberty.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1279">'''Spreading''' is a term used in [[competitive debating]] in the United States—a portmanteau of [[speed reading]]—to refer to competitors speaking extremely fast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=McCordick |first=Jack |date=26 September 2017 |title=The Corrosion of High School Debate—And How It Mirrors American Politics |url=https://www.americamagazine.org/arts-culture/2017/09/26/corrosion-high-school-debate-and-how-it-mirrors-american-politics |work=[[American Magazine]] |location= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prevalence of spreading is attributed to 'failing to answer all opposing arguments' being an easy criteria for judges to award a win on, thus speaking fast and fielding an overwhelming number of distinct arguments is a viable strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |date=11 March 2016  |title=Debatable  |url=http://www.radiolab.org/story/debatable/ |work=[[Radiolab]] |location= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its usage is prevalent in both policy debating and the varsity level of debate. It is common practice for one who is spreading to 'flash' (give a copy of their case on a flash drive) to their opponent.

{{Feminism sidebar}}
'''State feminism''' is [[feminism]] created or approved by the government of a state or nation. It usually specifies a particular program. The government may, at the same time, prohibit [[non-governmental organization]]s from advocating for any other feminist program.&lt;ref name="FConverge-p223"&gt;{{harvp|Badran|2009|p=223}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Turkey ==
In the 20th century, Turkey's government "preempted feminism".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Badran|2009|p=302}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Turkey|Turkish]] national government's program in the 1920s included mandatory de-[[hijab]]icization (unveiling of women), access for women to more education and work, and political rights for women, all as part of a national effort to emulate some Western cultural characteristics in a Muslim nation.&lt;ref name="FConverge-p223"/&gt;

In the 1980s, [[second-wave feminism]] appeared, among daughters of leading women of Turkey's [[Kemalist ideology|Kemalist]] [[Turkish National Movement|movement]], the women being feminist within the government's definition and leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Badran|2009|p=227}}&lt;/ref&gt; The state feminism they followed, according to scholar Margot Badran, covered parts of patriarchy with an appearance of Western progressivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Badran|2009|p=227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Yemen ==
In [[South Yemen]], also known as the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen (with the subsequent unification of two Yemens into [[Yemen|one]], the former PDRY is now generally south Yemen), state feminism had little effect on patriarchy and did not have much influence beyond [[Aden]], a port city in the PDRY.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Badran|2009|p=260}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Women in the south&amp;nbsp;... seemed to believe their gains would never be rescinded. They behaved as feminists, if by that is meant shaping lives of their choice by accessing the new options offered them. But they did not embrace a feminist ideology or identity, as this was preempted by the state. When the socialist regime collapsed, the fragile gains of state feminism went with it."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Badran|2009|p=261}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Northern women had acquired an acute gender consciousness and developed practical feminist skills&amp;nbsp;... but they had no legitimate political space. Southern women had been able to exploit the educational and professional benefits conferred under state feminism, but they did not have the independent ideological space in which to develop a feminism of their own."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Badran|2009|p=261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Post-unification Yemen has been analyzed by one author.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Badran|2009|p=261}}, citing {{harvp|Carapico|1991|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sweden ==
{{main|Feminism in Sweden}}

== Middle East ==
In the 1980s and 1990s, "feminist activists and scholars in the Middle East assailed the limits of 'state feminism' and exposed its patriarchal dimensions."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Badran|2009|p=255}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Communist and socialist regimes ==
"Sharon Wesoky characterized the relationship of an emergent women's movement to the [Chinese] state as 'symbiotic,' containing elements of both autonomy and dependence, and operating largely within rather than in opposition to party-state institutions."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Hershatter|2007|p=102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{"'}}State feminisms' have been discredited elsewhere as well [''e.g.'', in China] following the collapse of communist and socialist regimes."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Badran|2009|pp=255, 261}}, citing {{harvp|Yang|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
"Many feminists ... consider the notion of a state feminism to be an oxymoron."&lt;ref name="FConverge-p223" /&gt; Independent women's movements may be prohibited by the government.&lt;ref name="FConverge-p223" /&gt;

'''''The Grand Chessboard: American Primacy and Its Geostrategic Imperatives''''' (1997) is one of the major works of [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]]. Brzezinski graduated with a PhD from Harvard University in 1953 and became Professor of American Foreign Policy at Johns Hopkins University before becoming the United States [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] during 1977–81 under the administration of President [[Jimmy Carter]].

Regarding the landmass of [[Eurasia]] as the center of global power, Brzezinski sets out to formulate a Eurasian [[geostrategy]] for the United States. In particular, he writes, it is imperative that no Eurasian challenger should emerge capable of dominating Eurasia and thus also of challenging America's [[superpower|global pre-eminence]].

Much of his analysis is concerned with [[geostrategy in Central Asia]], focusing on the exercise of power on the Eurasian landmass in a post-Soviet environment. In his chapter dedicated to what he refers to as the "Eurasian Balkans", Brzezinski makes use of [[Halford J. Mackinder]]'s [[Heartland Theory]].

The book was critically reviewed by ''[[The New York Times]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|date=October 26, 1997|title=Endgame – Zbigniew Brzezinski's latest blueprint for American foreign policy.

'''''The Listening (In ascolto)''''' is a 2006 movie based on the [[mass surveillance]] operations conducted by the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) with the aid of private corporations. It was Italian director Giacomo Martelli's debut movie and explored the dire consequences that can arise due to excessive corporate influence on a government agency set up for mass surveillance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Spies, Crime and those evil corporations|url=http://likhna.blogspot.in/2007/07/spies-crime-and-those-evil-corporations.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
In the late 1990s, the National Security Agency (NSA) and a computer software firm, Wendell Crenshaw work together to implement a surveillance technology, the Echelon, which enables NSA to monitor almost anybody in the world. When classified information about the Echelon system accidentally finds its way into a young woman's hands, a terrible clash occurs in the opinions of a top-executive at Wendell Crenshaw  and an NSA operative, the former determined to find out what the lady knows even if it means using violence and the latter, equally determined to save an innocent woman's life&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Listening|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/351999/The-Listening/overview}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==ECHELON ==
Making a film specifically on [[ECHELON]] offered the possibility of exploring the issues of interception, violation of privacy, and the interference of corporate interests in matters of national as well as international security simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WHY MAKE AN ECHELON FILM|url=http://www.docstoc.com/docs/34541111/The-Listening}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vote allocation''' is a system of [[tactical voting]] used in the [[Republic of China]] on [[Taiwan]] from the late-1990s, after which the voting system is to be changed from [[single non-transferable vote]] to a [[parallel voting]] system. In this system, voters are asked to vote for a party candidate based on items such as their day of birthday so as to evenly distribute votes. In districts where a party is running two candidates, males may be asked to vote for one candidate and females for another to insure even distribution. It was also practice in Japan and South Korea, where the SNTV  system were used.

Hong Kong political parties started to adopt this strategy since 2000 to overcome the effect of the largest remainder system with Hare quota combined with small constituencies (5- to 8-member in 2008). They are able to get more seats with fewer votes by filling separate lists of candidates in the same constituencies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19684">Overall, [[Africa]] has about 9% of the world's [[fresh water]] resources and 11% of the [[World population|world's population]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/cooperation-in-international-waters-in-africa|title=Cooperation in International Waters in Africa (CIWA)|website=www.worldbank.org|access-date=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The United Nations World Water Development Report 2016: Water and Jobs|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2016|isbn=978-92-3-100146-8|location=Paris|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, there is very significant inter-and intra-annual variability of all [[climate]] and [[water resources]] characteristics, so while some regions have sufficient water,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] faces numerous water-related challenges that constrain [[economic growth]] and threaten the livelihoods of its people.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; African [[agriculture]] is mostly based on [[rain]]-fed farming, and less than 10% of [[Cultivated land|cultivated]] land in the continent is [[Irrigation|irrigated]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The impact of [[climate change]] and variability is thus very pronounced.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The main source of [[electricity]] is [[hydropower]], which contributes significantly to the current installed capacity for energy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Continuing investment in the last decade has increased the amount of power generated.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Solutions to the challenges of water for [[Energy security|energy]] and [[food security]] are hindered by shortcomings in water [[infrastructure]], development, and management capacity to meet the demands of a rapidly growing population.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This is compounded by the fact the Africa has the fastest [[urbanization]] rates in the world.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.worldbank.org/opendata/africa-s-urban-population-growth-trends-and-projections|title=Africa’s urban population growth: trends and projections|last=Rafei|first=Leila|date=2014-10-29|website=The Data Blog|language=en|access-date=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Water development and [[Water resource management|management]] are much more complex due to the multiplicity of trans-boundary water resources ([[river]]s, [[lake]]s and [[aquifer]]s).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Around 75% of sub-Saharan Africa falls within 53 international [[Drainage basin|river basin]] catchments that traverse multiple borders.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This particular constraint can also be converted into an opportunity if the potential for trans-boundary cooperation is harnessed in the development of the area’s water resources.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A multi-sectoral analysis of the [[Zambezi|Zambezi River]], for example, shows that [[Riparian zone|riparian]] cooperation could lead to a 23% increase in firm energy production without any additional investments.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A number of institutional and legal frameworks for transboundary cooperation exist, such as the Zambezi River Authority, the [[Southern African Development Community]] (SADC) Protocol, [[Volta River Authority]] and the [[Nile Basin Commission]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, additional efforts are required to further develop political will, as well as the financial capacities and institutional frameworks needed for win-win multilateral cooperative actions and optimal solutions for all riparians.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Water, jobs and the economy ==
[[File:GDP Growth in Africa and Developing Countries, 2007 -2017.png|thumb|350px|GDP Growth in Africa and Developing Countries, 2007 -2017]]
[[File:Population Growth in Africa, 1950 - 2050.png|thumb|350px|Population Growth in Africa, 1950 - 2050]]
Africa has recently undergone its best decade (2005-2015) for [[economic growth]] since the post-[[independence]] period. The growth, however, has neither been inclusive or equitable.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; According to the [[World Bank]], [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] growth in sub-Saharan Africa averaged 4.5% in 2014, up from 4.2% in 2013, supported by continuing [[infrastructure]] investment, increased [[agricultural production]] and buoyant services.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Africa]]’s population surpassed the 1 billion mark in 2010 and is projected to double by 2050.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1787/aeo-2015-en|title=African Economic Outlook, Books / African Economic Outlook / 2015:Regional Development and Spatial Inclusion|last=AfDB|last2=UNDP|last3=OECD|doi=10.1787/aeo-2015-en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Demographically, it is expected to be the fastest growing region in the world with the growth varying depending on sub region.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Furthermore, the growth is skewed to the young and that component of the population that will need jobs is expected to increase rapidly and comprise 910 million out of the projected two billion total population by 2050.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Most of the growth in workforce will be in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] (about 90%).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Hence, the demand for jobs will be a major policy issue across the continent, which is already experiencing high unemployment and underemployment; moreover, the latter is driving both migration within the region and emigration towards [[Europe]] and other regions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Job creation for this anticipated growth in population is set to be the major challenge for Africa’s structural economic and social transformation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is estimated that in 2015, 19 million young people will be joining the sluggish job market in Sub-Saharan Africa and four million in [[North Africa]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The demand for jobs is expected to increase to 24.6 million annually in Sub-Saharan Africa and 4.3 million in North Africa by 2030, representing two thirds of global growth in demand for jobs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Youth unemployment has been the trigger for uprisings, notably in North Africa, and has led to social and security instability.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The key water-dependent or related sectors with the potential for meeting part of the current and projected demand for jobs in Africa are social services, agriculture, fisheries and aquaculture, [[retail]] and [[hospitality]], [[manufacturing]], [[construction]], [[natural resource]]s exploitation (including [[mining]]) and energy production (including [[Hydropower|hydro]], [[Geothermal energy|geothermal]] and expected [[Hydraulic fracturing|fracking]] for oil and natural gas).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; All these sectors depend to a varying extent on the availability of, access to, and reliability of water resources.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Irresponsible water use by some sectors can create short-term employment, but result in negative impacts on the availability of water resources and jeopardize future jobs in other water-dependent sectors.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Climate change]], [[water scarcity]] and variability have direct impact on the major sector outputs and thus ultimately on the overall economy of most African countries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Jobs in water-dependent sectors ==
Currently, the most important water-dependent sector in Africa is agriculture, which forms the bedrock of most economies of African states.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Both rain-fed and irrigated agriculture are important job-providing sectors in all African countries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Agriculture ===
The role of agriculture as the main source of [[employment]] is decreasing in many African countries as a sustained growth in many economies is leading to increasing standards of living, improved education and the occurrence of rapid rural-urban migration of educated youth in search of white collar jobs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, for the foreseeable future agriculture will still be a major source of employment, especially in non-oil producing African states.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There is a rising paradox of increasing unemployment in the rapidly urbanizing cities and towns of Africa: labour shortages in rural areas are leading to significant reduction in food production and increased dependence of many African countries on food imports.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Based on [[Food and Agriculture Organization|Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] statistics, agriculture was the source of employment for 49% of Africans by 2010 and is a reflection of a gradual decline from 2002 to 2010,which coincides with the period of sustained GDP growth in most African countries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture: Opportunities and Challenges|last=|first=|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)|year=2014|isbn=978-92-5-108276-8|location=http://www.fao.org/3/a-i3720e.pdf|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of this decline, agriculture is expected to create eight million stable jobs by 2020 based on the trends from the McKinsey Global Institute analysis.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; If the continent accelerates agricultural development by expanding large scale commercial farming on uncultivated land and shifts production from low-value grain production to more labour-intensive and higher value-added horticultural and bio fuel crops (a good example is [[Ethiopia]]), as many as six million additional jobs could be created continent-wide by 2020.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/africa/africa_at_work|title=Africa at work: Job creation and inclusive growth|website=McKinsey &amp; Company|access-date=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, such estimates do not take account of the potential displacement or disappearance of existing jobs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These would need to be carefully assessed in terms of social, economic and environmental impacts in the overall context of responsible agricultural investment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Fisheries ===
The African fisheries and aquaculture sector employed12.3 million people in 2014 and contributed US $24 billion or 1.26% of the GDP of all African countries, which improved food security and nutrition.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; About half of the workers in the sector were fishers and the rest were processors (mainly women) or [[Aquaculture|aquaculturists]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Value of African Fisheries|last=|first=|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)|year=2014|isbn=|location=http://www.fao.org/3/a-i3917e.pdf|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Manufacturing and industry ===
Many manufacturing industries in Africa are water-dependent.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The share of jobs is lower than in agriculture, even though the industries cited are considered as water intensive.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 2011, [[Ghana]]’s economy grew at 14% with the onset of its first production of oil.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ghana's Economic Performance 2011|last=|first=|publisher=Ghana Statistical Service|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2015 the growth rate was expected to be only 3.9%.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.africaneconomicoutlook.org/en/country-notes/ghana|title=Ghana {{!}} African Economic Outlook|website=African Economic Outlook|access-date=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be attributed to a great extent to the failure to provide the basic water and energy infrastructure to meet the needs of a rapidly growing economy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Ghana is mainly dependent on the Akosombo hydroelectric dam on the Volta River for electricity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Due to reduced inflows from low rainfall, the [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric dam]] was operating merely at half of its capacity in 2015.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theafricareport.com/West-Africa/electricity-ghanas-power-crisis-deepens.html|title=Electricity: Ghana's power crisis deepens {{!}} West Africa|last=Ofori-Atta|first=Prince|website=www.theafricareport.com|access-date=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was exacerbated by disruptions mainly in geothermal plants.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In June 2015, all electricity was being rationed at 12 hours on, and 24 hours off.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Though this is extreme, it reinforces the need for water infrastructure to sustain production and jobs in the nascent African economies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Anecdotal evidence from [[trade union]]s and [[Employment|employers]] in Ghana indicate that tens of thousands of stable jobs were lost in 2015 and the investment climate has turned sour, forcing Ghana to seek [[International Monetary Fund]] macro-economic support again.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sirte Declaration on the Challenges of Implementing Integrated and Sustainable Development on Agriculture and Water in Africa.|last=|first=|publisher=African Union|year=2004|isbn=|location=http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/sirte2008/Declaration-Sirte%202004.pdf|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These policy instruments are underpinned by strategies and programmes, including the New Partnership for African Development Program (NEPAD), Program for Infrastructure Development in Africa (PIDA) and many others, which include the integrated development of Africa’s water resources for socio-economic development and poverty alleviation and eradication.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The [[AU Agenda 2063]], for example, aspires to a prosperous Africa based on inclusive growth and sustainable development.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It specifically aims for an Africa that shall have equitable and sustainable use and management of water resources for socio-economic development, regional cooperation and the environment, and calls for the following action among others.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; ''‘Support Young people as drivers of Africa’s renaissance, through investment in their health,education and access to technology, opportunities and capital, and concerted strategies to combat youth unemployment and underemployment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Encourage exchange and Pan-Africanism among young people through the formation of African Union Clubs in all schools, colleges and universities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Ensure faster movement on the harmonization of continental admissions, curricula, standards, programmes and qualifications and raising the standards of higher education to enhance the mobility of African youth and talent across the continent by 2025’.''&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Expected future developments ==
For Africa to be able to meet the [[Sustainable Development Goals]] and maintain the impressive growth rates of the last 10 years, the basic infrastructures of water, electricity and transportation are prerequisites.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Without these basics, the African economies will lose the momentum of the last decade, which will lead to not only loss of direct water jobs, but also jobs in all the other sectors dependent on water.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; An illustrative example is the case of Ghana which is often cited as one of the best examples of economic recovery in Africa.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== African Water Policy Framework and impact on jobs ==
The African Policy Framework for the water sector comprise a series of high-level declarations,resolutions and programmes of action on the development and use of the continent’s water resources for socio-economic development, regional integration and the environment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These include the [[African Water Vision 2025]] and its Framework of Action, the African Union (AU) [[Extraordinary Summit on Water and Agriculture]], the AU [[Sharm El Sheikh Declaration on Water and Sanitation]], and most importantly, the Agenda 2063 –The Africa We Want.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sirte Declaration On The Challenges Of Implementing Integrated And Sustainable Development In Agriculture And Water In Africa|last=|first=|publisher=African Union|year=2004|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Africa Water Vision for 2025:  Equitable and  Sustainable Use of Water for Socioeconomic  Development|last=|first=|publisher=African Development Bank Group|year=|isbn=|location=http://www.afdb.org/fileadmin/uploads/afdb/Documents/Generic-Documents/african%20water%20vision%202025%20to%20be%20sent%20to%20wwf5.pdf|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These policy instruments are underpinned by strategies and programmes, including the [[New Partnership for African Development Program]] (NEPAD), [[Program for Infrastructure Development in Africa]] (PIDA) and many others, which include the integrated development of Africa’s water resources for socio-economic development and poverty alleviation and eradication.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
