'''''187 Ride or Die''''' is a video game for the [[PlayStation 2]] and [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]], developed and published by [[Ubisoft]]. In order to become "top dog" of the game, the player must race and defeat opponents through a variety of different stages all set in Los Angeles's infamous [[South Los Angeles|South Central]] region.

The game's title comes from two phrases common in the subculture. [[187 (murder)|187]] is the [[California Penal Code]] section that defines murder. It has come into general use among [[gang]]s in the United States as a synonym for murder, and this usage has passed into popular culture via [[gangsta rap]]. "Ride or die" is a combination of the phrases "ride it out" and "die trying", meaning one is willing to do anything even if it involves personal risk.

If playing with another player, one can be the driver and the other can be the shooter. This can be done in the story and online mode. There are a variety of modes available to the player.

The game would later be ported to the [[PlayStation Portable]] under the title ''[[Street Riders]]'' on March 31, 2006.

'''''8 Ball Bunny''''' is a ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' cartoon (reissued as a 1961 [[Blue ribbon|Blue Ribbon]] ''[[Merrie Melodies]]'' cartoon) directed by [[Chuck Jones]] and written by [[Michael Maltese]]. It was shot in 1949 and released theatrically on July 8, 1950.

==Plot==
The Brooklyn Ice Palace shuts down after the Ice Frolics pack up to go to another show somewhere else, but during their departure, the Ice Frolics crew forget their star performer, [[List of Looney Tunes characters|"Playboy" Penguin]].  Playboy is found by Bugs Bunny, who vows to take him home. But, upon discovering penguins come from the South Pole, exclaims  "Ooh, I'm dyin'!"

To go down south, Bugs and Playboy hitch a ride on a [[freight train]] to [[New Orleans]].

Once in [[New Orleans]], Bugs puts Playboy aboard a ship named ''[[Admiral Byrd]]'', which he believes is going to the South Pole. Afterwards, Bugs orders a carrot [[martini (cocktail)|martini]] at La Bouche Cafe and stays for [[Mardi Gras]]. After hearing that the ship is actually headed for Brooklyn, Bugs swims out to it to rescue Playboy and finds him hanging upside down in the ship's kitchen among uncooked chickens, but rather than swimming back to New Orleans, they end up on a tropical island.

While Bugs strums a guitar and composes a calypso ballad (six years before the style was popularized by "The Banana Boat Song"), Playboy is forced to build a [[dugout boat]]. As Bugs is playing, [[Humphrey Bogart]], straight out of the film ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)|The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]'', appears and asks him if he can "help out a fellow American who's down on his luck". Bugs reaches into his pocket, digs around, and pulls out a coin and flips it at him and tells him to "hit the road".

After ten days at sea, Bugs is beginning to feel hungry, having not taken any food with them. Upon looking at Playboy, Bugs remembers a hobo on the train saying that penguins are practically chickens, and decides to eat Playboy, but immediately snaps out of his daze and apologizes to Playboy, just as he spots land. The land, however, is the [[Panama Canal]] and when the guard at the first [[lock (canal)|lock]] demands a [[quarter (United States coin)|quarter]] for passage through, Bugs refuses to pay it and decides he and Playboy will continue the journey on foot.

While trekking rough South America, Bugs and Playboy end up in a cauldron of cannibals around Bolivia, Brazil, or Peru and are about to be eaten by the chanting natives when one comes running shouting "El Bwana" which scares the other natives away. Bugs Bunny intrepidly awaits the "El Bwana" which turns out to be Humphrey Bogart asking again "Pardon me, but could you help out a fellow American who's down on his luck?". Rather than berate him again, Bugs just gives him a coin for saving his and Playboy's life and then he and Playboy resume their journey.

Bugs and Playboy's route continues down through the rest of South America nearly straight to the South Pole, with Bugs having to swing through trees, outswim a hungry [[crocodile]], scale a mountain in the [[Andes]], and sail a boat through the South Pacific to the Antarctic.

Bugs brings Playboy to the exact South Pole and says that he [Bugs] has brought him home like he promised and is leaving, causing Playboy to cry. Bugs asks what's the problem now which Playboy shows Bugs a flyer for his performance which reads "The Ice Frolics ''Presents'' The Only Hoboken Born Penguin In Captivity Skating The" (''which'' [[Hoboken (disambiguation)|Hoboken]]&lt;!--intentional link to DAB page--&gt; is unspecified) and Bugs (realizing that regardless of which Hoboken it may be would still have to travel more than half the Earth to get Playboy to his true destination) yells that "Ooh, I'm dying again!" Humphrey Bogart appears yet again and starts to ask for Bugs' help. Just as Bogart says "Say pardon me but..." poor Bugs begs ''him'' if "he can help out a fellow American who's down on his luck". With that, he thrusts Playboy into Bogart's hands and runs off into the distance while laughing hysterically.

==Production==
''8 Ball Bunny'' is the second appearance of [[List of Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies characters#Playboy Penguin|Playboy]]; his first appearance was in 1949's ''[[Frigid Hare]]''.  The Bogart voice was performed by impressionist [[Dave Barry (actor)|Dave Barry]] (no relation to the [[Dave Barry|humor columnist]]).

While the film is introduced by the ''Looney Tunes'' music ''[[The Merry-Go-Round Broke Down]]'', the opening card indicates a ''Merrie Melodies'' Blue Ribbon release with the 1959–1964 red rings, as does the end card billed as a "Vitaphone Release", replacing the original green opening and ending sequences.

==Edited version==
When the short aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], the part where Bugs and Playboy are captured by South American natives is edited to remove the part where one of the natives runs to warn the group of "El Bwana" Humphrey Bogart coming and the group scattering. The scene was replaced with a frozen shot of Bogart's feet while the sound of the group muttering and fleeing was heard. However, the short has been aired uncensored (as recently as 2015) on [[Cartoon Network]], [[Boomerang (TV channel)|Boomerang]] and the Canadian cable channel [[Teletoon Retro]].

==Availability==

The short is included in the VHS release ''Looney Tunes Video Show Volume 3'', can be seen as a bonus feature on the DVD releases of the movie ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)|The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]'' (the Humphrey Bogart caricature in this cartoon short is based on Bogart's character in the film) and the documentary film ''[[March of the Penguins]]''. It is also featured uncensored and uncut and digitally remastered on [[Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 4|the fourth volume]] of the ''[[Looney Tunes Golden Collection]]'' [[DVD]] set, as well as disc one of ''[[The Essential Bugs Bunny]]''.

'''''ATV: Quad Power Racing''''' is an [[all-terrain vehicle]] [[Racing video game|racing]] [[video game]] released in 2000 for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] and in 2002 for the [[Game Boy Advance]]. A sequel called ''[[ATV: Quad Power Racing 2]]'' was released in 2003 and a third game titled ''[[ATV: Quad Power Racing 3]]'' was due for release in Early 2005, but was cancelled due to Acclaim Entertainment's bankruptcy. 

The GBA version was re-released in PAL regions in 2006 by Oxygen Interactive under their Liquid Games publishing label.

==Gameplay==
There are four gameplay modes: championship, single race, time attack, and two-player. In championship mode there are six different playable characters to choose from and twelve tracks to race on.&lt;ref name="spot"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamespot.com/ps/driving/atvquadpowerracing/review.html | title = GameSpot review | publisher = [[GameSpot]] | last = Satterfield | first = Shane | date = 2000-08-29 | accessdate = 2008-01-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ign"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://psx.ign.com/articles/164/164709p1.html | title = IGN review | publisher = [[IGN]] | last = Blache III | first = Fabian | date = 2000-09-18 | accessdate = 2008-01-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The tracks are separated to three different themes: desert, forest and snow. Objective is to win first place against five other [[Artificial intelligence|computer-controlled]] opponents. In the time attack mode and the single race mode objective is to record a [[high score]] by time or place respectively. Two-player mode is a race between two human opponents in split screen. The game also features weather effects.&lt;ref name="vortex"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamevortex.com/gamevortex/rm_psx_atvquad.html | title = Game Vortex review | publisher = Game Vortex | last = Paddock | first = Matt | date = | accessdate = 2008-01-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''ATV: Quad Power Racing'' was received poorly by critics. [[GameSpot]]'s Shane Satterfield wrote that for ATV enthusiasts the game may warrant a rental but others who are only mildly into the sport will be disappointed by the game's repetitive graphics, steep learning curve, and overall lack of variety or fun.&lt;ref name="spot" /&gt; [[IGN]] also gave low marks saying that "This game has little to no balance, very poor racing AI and never really gets past go...or is that Start".&lt;ref name="ign" /&gt; Game Vortex gave a good score of 86 out of 100 but still concluded the review that "my final call on ATV Quad Power Racing is that it's an acquired taste for most people, even hard-core racers".&lt;ref name="vortex" /&gt;

'''Adventure racing''' (also called '''expedition racing''') is typically a multi-disciplinary team sport involving navigation over an unmarked wilderness course with races extending anywhere from two hours up to two weeks in length. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=occW94DgWT4 (What Is Adventure Racing Video)] Some races offer solo competition as well. The principle disciplines in adventure racing include [[trekking]], [[mountain biking]], and [[paddling]] although races can incorporate a multitude of other disciplines including [[climbing]], [[abseiling]], [[horse riding]], [[skiing]] and [[white water rafting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Adventure Racing 101|website=USARA|publisher=AR Pathfinder}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teams generally vary in gender mix and in size from two to five competitors, however the premier format is considered to be mixed gender teams of four racers. There is typically no suspension of the clock during races, irrespective of length; elapsed competition time runs concurrently with real time, and competitors must choose if or when to rest.

== History ==
The roots of adventure racing are deep and people debate the origin of the modern adventure race.  Some point to the two-day [[Karrimor International Mountain Marathon]], first held in 1968 as the birth of modern adventure racing.  The Karrimor Marathon required two-person teams to traverse mountainous terrain while carrying all the supplies required to support themselves through the double-length marathon run.

In 1980, the [[Alpine Ironman]] was held in New Zealand.  Individual competitors ran, paddled and skied to a distant finish line.  Later that year, the Alpine Ironman's creator, [[Robin Judkins]] launched the better-known [[Coast to Coast (race)|Coast to Coast]] race&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.coasttocoast.co.nz|title=Home » Coast to Coast|website=www.coasttocoast.co.nz|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which involved most of the elements of modern adventure racing:  trail running, cycling and paddling.  Australias 2-day WildTrek ran from 1981 through 2005.

Independently in 1982, the first expedition-length adventure race, a week-long, North American event called the [[Alaska Mountain Wilderness Classic]] debuted. The Classic involved wilderness travel—no roads, no pack animals, and no support teams, carry all food and equipment from start to finish—with less than 50 of its 150 mile length on trail. It continues today, changing courses every 3 years.
 
In 1989, the modern era of adventure racing arrived with [[Gerald Fusil]]'s launch of the [[Raid Gauloises]] in [[New Zealand]]. Inspired by the [[Paris-Dakar Rally]], Fusil envisioned an expanded expedition-style race in which competitors would rely on their own strength and abilities to traverse great and challenging terrain.  The race included all the modern elements of adventure racing, including mixed-gender teams competing in a multi-day 400+ mile race.  Building on Fusil's concept, the inaugural [[Southern Traverse]] was held in 1991.

In the early-90's, [[Mark Burnett]] read an [[L.A. Times]] article&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1991-02-27/news/vw-1991_1_finish-line|title=Last Among Finishers, but First in Their Own Hearts|last=MARKMAN|first=JON D.|date=1991-02-27|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2018-06-09|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt; about [[Raid Gauloises]] and was inspired to compete and bring the race to the USA and promote the race as a major televised sporting event&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-03-05/local/me-30341_1_raid-gauloises|title=Topanga Man Seeking to Stage Race of Endurance :  Adventure: The event would be a California version of the Raid Gauloises, a 300-mile contest. Obtaining permits is key obstacle.|last=KLEIN|first=GARY|date=1994-03-05|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2018-06-09|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  After purchasing the rights from [[Gerald Fusil]], Burnett launched the first "[[Eco-Challenge]]" race in 1995.  Burnett promoted his event with [[Emmy]]-award-winning films (tapping the talent of [[Mike Sears]] to produce the films for the first two events).  The [[Eco-Challenge]] was last held in 2002 when Burnett shifted his focus to Survivor, the Contender, the Apprentice and other reality based television shows.  With the Eco-Challenge also came the name "adventure race", a phrase coined by journalist and author Martin Dugard, to describe the class of races embodied by the Raid and Eco-Challenge.

The United States Adventure Racing Association "USARA" was formed in 1998. The USARA was the first "national governing body" for the sport of adventure racing and arose from the need for safety standards, insurance and to promote the growth of adventure racing in the United States. The USARA has added national rankings, a national championship, ecological standards to the list of benefits provided for the sport of adventure racing.

In 2000, the inaugural United States Adventure Racing Association Adventure Race National Championship was held in Kernville, California. The USARA National Championship is typically held the first weekend in October and is considered the premier adventure race in the U.S. The USARA Adventure Racing National Championship has continued each year drawing the best US teams for a chance at earning the title of national champion.

In 2001, the inaugural World Championships were held in [[Switzerland]] with Team Nokia Adventure crossing the finishing line first. The concept of a world championship lay dormant until it was revived in 2004, with Canada's [[Raid the North|Raid the North Extreme]] serving as the AR World Championship event in [[Newfoundland &amp; Labrador]]. The [[Adventure Racing World Series]] and its ultimate event, the AR World Championships have been held every year since. The 2013 World Championships were in Costa Rica, 2014 in Ecuador, 2015 in Brazil, 2016 in Australia, and 2017 in the United States.  The 2018 event will be off the coast of Africa on the Reunion Island.

In 2002, the first major expedition length race to be held exclusively in the United States was launched.  [[Primal Quest]] has been sporadically held since its inception - about 6 times from 2002 to 2017.  In 2004, the death of veteran racer [[Nigel Aylott]] over-shadowed the race, and raised debates about the nature of [[Primal Quest]] and adventure racing.

In 2004, professional geologist Stjepan Pavicic organized the first [[Patagonian Expedition Race]] at the bottom tip of the American continent, in the Chilean Tierra del Fuego. Truly demanding routes through rough terrain of often more than 600&amp;nbsp;km soon made it be known as “the last wild race”.

In 2010, the German Adventure Race Series where held for the first time in three different locations all over Germany. Since then the popularity of the sport in Germany has grown every year. More races and venues have joined the series and the number of competitors are still growing from year to year. Competitors can start in teams of two (male, female or mixed) within the categories Master (15-20 h), Challenger (8-10 h) or Beginner (4-6 h).

In 2012, Commander Forer of the Royal Navy organized the first Sea-land navigation discipline race [[Solent Amphibious Challenge|The Solent Amphibious Challenge]]. The race demanded the competitors to split up between sailing, running, and cycling in parts of the race and rendezvous at the end and sail the yacht to the finish line.

In December of 2017, the [http://www.arcooperative.org/ Adventure Racing Cooperative] (ARC) was launched in the United States.  It was formed in a grassroots movement to help promote and expand the sport of Adventure Racing in the United States.  ARC is a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit business.

In May 2018 [[World OCR]], the world governing body for Obstacle Sports and related disciplines announced the Expedition OCR World Championships in collaboration with [[Primal Quest]] to be held in September 2018&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mudrunguide.com/2018/05/primal-quest-expedition-ocr-world-championship/|title=Primal Quest Slated to Host Expedition OCR World Championship {{!}} Mud Run, Obstacle Course Race &amp; Ninja Warrior Guide|date=2018-05-30|work=Mud Run, Obstacle Course Race &amp; Ninja Warrior Guide|access-date=2018-06-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In June 2018 [[Eco-Challenge]] announced it would re-launch in 2019 with [[Bear Grylls]] and the original production team&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/bear-grylls-mark-burnett-revive-eco-challenge-race-1202835584/|title=Bear Grylls and Mark Burnett Team to Revive ‘Eco-Challenge’ Race Franchise|last=Littleton|first=Cynthia|date=2018-06-07|work=Variety|access-date=2018-06-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Race types ==

===Lengths===
*Sprint: typically a two- to six-hour race, featuring minimal navigation and occasionally involving games or special tests of agility or cunning.
*12-Hour: a six- to twelve-hour race, featuring limited navigation and orienteering.
*24-Hour: a race lasting between 18-30+ hours, typically involving UTM-based ([[Universal Transverse Mercator]]) navigation.  Often basic rope work is involved (e.g., traverses or rappels).  24-hour and longer races used to require that competitors employ a support crew to transport gear from place to place.  Most races these days do not permit support crews, with race organizers transporting gear bins to designated checkpoints for racers.
*Multi-day: a 36-48+ hour race, involving advanced navigation and route choice; sleep deprivation becomes a significant factor.
*Expedition: Three to 11 day race (or longer), involving all the challenges of a multi-day race, but often with additional disciplines (e.g., horseback riding, unusual paddling events, extensive mountaineering and rope work).

===Disciplines===
[[Image:James+Pre-+race+by+sail.jpg|thumb|Setting up a kayak sail just before the start of [[Primal Quest]] 2003.]]
[[Image:Scotland AR.JPG|thumb|Preparing for the climbing section at an adventure race (Adrenaline Rush) in Scotland.]]
The majority of adventure races include trail running, mountain biking and a paddling event.  Navigation and rope work are also featured in all but the shortest races, but this is only the beginning.  Races often feature:

*Paddling:  [[kayaking|kayaks]], [[canoe]]s, [[outrigger|out-riggers]], [[rafting|rafts]] and [[tubing (recreation)|tubing]];
*Traveling on wheels: [[Mountain Biking|Mountain Bikes]], kick-scooters, [[roller skates|in-line skates]], [[roller skates]];
*Beasts of Burden: [[Horse]]s and [[camel]]s;
*Catching Air: [[Paragliding]], [[hang-gliding]];
*Covering Terrain: [[Orienteering]], [[mountaineering]], [[coasteering]], [[caving]], [[human swimming|swimming]], [[canyoneering]], [[riverboarding]];
*Learning the Ropes: Ascending; [[rappelling]], traversing (including via [[zip-line]]).

==Overview==

===Rules===
The rules of adventure racing vary by race.  However, virtually all races include the rules of racing:  
* no motorized travel;
* navigation;
* teams must travel together the entire race, usually within 50 meters of each other;
* no outside assistance except at designated transition areas (assistance from competing teams is generally permitted at all times); and
* teams must carry all mandatory gear.

===Organizational meeting===
Typically races will feature an organizational meeting either the night before or the morning of the race.  At this meeting the course will be revealed for the first time.  For sprints, racers may follow a marked course.  For longer races, racers may be given maps marked to show checkpoints ("CPs") or racers may be simply given a topographical map and coordinates (usually UTM coordinates) that indicate where the CPs will be found.  Special rules, last minute changes and other information may also be provided at the meeting.

===Checkpoints===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Passport control.JPG|thumb]] --&gt;
Racers are required to visit a series of [[Control point (orienteering)|checkpoints or passport controls]] (CPs), usually in a specific order.

===Transition areas===
Most races include one or more transition areas that teams can visit to replenish supplies. Typically, teams change to another mode of travel in a transition area.  For instance, teams will end a trekking leg and transition to mountain biking in a transition area.  Shorter races often feature a single transition area that teams may visit numerous times during the event.  Teams will leave food, water, paddling and biking gear, fresh clothing and any other items they may need during the course of the race.

Longer races feature multiple transition areas.  Team gear is transported either by a support crew (provided by the team) or by the racing staff.

===Gear check===
Virtually all adventure races feature mandatory gear that must be carried during part or all of the race.  Races will often include mandatory pre-race gear checks by race personnel and harsh penalties or disqualification may result if a team lacks the requisite equipment.

In addition to pre-race gear checks, many race organizers also include on-course gear checks.  This helps to ensure that teams that start with approved gear, compete with, and finish a race with that same gear.

===Short course===
Adventure races attract individuals of greatly divergent abilities.  To make the sport more inclusive, many race directors will "short course" racers; allow racers who miss mandatory time cut-offs to continue racing on a reduced-length course.  These racers will often earn an official finish time but be "unranked" and not eligible for prizes.  Some races provide the option for teams to skip certain CPs but incur a time penalty (which often must be "served" during the race).

===Teamwork===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Ar team photo.jpg|thumb]] --&gt;
Most adventure races are team events, with expedition length races typically requiring a set number of teammates (usually four or five) and requiring the teams to be co-ed. Many racers find the team aspect of adventure racing to be among the most enticing and demanding aspects.

Teams typically elect a team captain and designate a team navigator.  Teams have different views as to the functions of each of these positions, with some teams having very little structure, while others assigned specifics rights and responsibilities to each of these persons.  For example, a team that stresses a democratic philosophy may limit the captain’s role to be the keeper of the racing passport and rules, and limit the navigator’s role to carrying the map and being primarily responsible for determining the team’s position at any given time.   A more regimented team may give the captain ultimate responsibility for making all decisions regarding rest schedules, rule interpretations and the like, while the navigator has full responsibility for not only tracking the team’s location, but determining route choice as well.

'''América Latina Olé Tour 2016''' was a [[Latin America]] [[concert tour]] by [[The Rolling Stones]], which began on 3 February 2016 in [[Santiago]] and made stops in [[La Plata]], [[Montevideo]], [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[São Paulo]], [[Porto Alegre]], [[Lima]], [[Bogotá]], [[Mexico City]] and ended in [[Havana]] with one free show on 25 March 2016.&lt;ref name="billboard.com Rolling Stones 2016 Latin American Tour"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Waddell|first1=Ray|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/live/6753755/rolling-stones-2016-latin-america-tour-dates-latina-ole |title=Rolling Stones Announce 2016 Latin American Tour |date=5 November 2015 |website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard magazine]] |accessdate= 8 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
On 17 September 2015, the Spanish newspaper ''[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]]'' revealed that the Rolling Stones were (at the time) in final negotiations to perform for the very first time in [[Cuba]], at the end of March 2016 (on 20 or 21 March). The location would be [[Havana]] and the venue the Estadio Latinoamericano (Latin American Stadium), a facility with capacity for 55,000 people. Keith Richards confirmed the negotiations with the Cubans, adding that Cuba had taken it seriously, following the opening of embassies in the United States and the Pope's (then) upcoming visit to Havana. It was also reported that the Stones' bassist [[Darryl Jones]] had influenced the decision to [[The Rolling Stones: Havana Moon|play in Cuba]].&lt;ref name="elmundo.es Cuba Rolling Stones in Cuba 2016"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ruiz |first1=Julián |url=http://www.elmundo.es/cultura/2015/09/17/55fa81ce46163f10658b456e.html |title=Los Rolling [Stones] quieren actuar en Cuba |date=17 September 2015 |website=[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]] |accessdate= 8 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cuba-solidarity.org.uk Rolling Stones in Cuba in 2016"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cuba-solidarity.org.uk/news/article/2849/rolling-stones-may-perform-in-cuba-in-2016 |title=Rolling Stones may perform in Cuba in 2016 |date=17 September 2015 |website=cuba-solidarity.org.uk |accessdate= 8 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="billboard.com The Rolling Stones Playing Cuba"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Cantor-Navas |first1=Judy |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/6721788/mick-jagger-cuba-rolling-stones-concert |title=Mick Jagger Visits Havana -- Are The Rolling Stones Playing Cuba? |date=6 October 2015 |website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard magazine]] |accessdate= 8 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="iorr.org Rolling Stones Latin America Olé Tour 2016"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.iorr.org/tour16/ |title=The Rolling Stones Latin America Olé Tour 2016 |date=5 November 2015 |website=iorr.org |accessdate= 8 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 November 2015, it was announced that the Rolling Stones would be going on tour in [[Latin America]] in 2016 for the first time since their [[A Bigger Bang Tour]] in February 2006, the name of this 13-date stadium tour being "América Latina Olé Tour 2016".&lt;ref name="billboard.com Rolling Stones 2016 Latin American Tour"/&gt; The tour would include their second ever show in Chile (the first being during the [[Voodoo Lounge Tour]] in February 1995) and their first show in São Paulo since the [[Bridges to Babylon Tour]] in April 1998. The Stones were also due to play their first ever shows in Uruguay, Peru, Colombia and Cuba.

Later in November 2015, another show was rumoured to occur also on 20 or 21 March 2016 at the Estadio Olimpico Felix Sanchez in [[Santo Domingo]], [[Dominican Republic]]&lt;ref name="iorr.org Rolling Stones Latin America Olé Tour 2016"/&gt; but this show was never confirmed. On 1 March 2016, The Stones confirmed their first ever show in Cuba due to occur on 25 March 2016, to be a free concert, their first ever in the [[Caribbean]] and the first open air concert in the country by a British rock band.&lt;ref name="rollingstones.com free concert Cuba 2016"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rollingstones.com/2016/03/01/the-rolling-stones-announce-free-concert-in-cuba/ |title=The Rolling Stones announce free concert in Cuba! |date= 1 March 2016 |website=rollingstones.com |accessdate= 2 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band played at the Coliseo de la Ciudad Deportiva de La Habana. Dubbed the "Concert for Amity," it was the largest act to play Cuba since the revolution in 1959.&lt;ref name="variety.com Rolling Stones Cuba free oncert"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2016/music/news/the-rolling-stones-cuba-free-concert-1201719605/ |title=The Rolling Stones to Play Free Concert in Cuba (by Jacob Bryant) |date= 1 March 2016 |website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |accessdate= 3 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ask A Ninja''' is a series of comedy videos about the image of [[ninja]] in popular culture available in [[podcast]] and [[vodcast]] form, as well as in [[.mov|mov]] and [[WMV]] file formats. The episodes were released between 2005 and 2011.

In December 2007, television industry trade magazine ''TelevisionWeek'' (www.tvweek.com) reported that ''Ask a Ninja'' creators Kent Nichols and [[Douglas Sarine]] made about $100,000 a month in ad revenue and income from merchandising and licensing from the show.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvweek.com/news/2007/12/online_fame_easy_ads_harder_to.php Online Fame Easy; Ads Harder To Get] – December 8, 2007. Retrieved March 12, 2008 (The show's two creators can be seen in episode seventy-three, "Modern Major Ninja").&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2007 Forbes listed The Ninja as one of the top "Fictional Celebrities" on the web.&lt;ref name=Ewalt2007 /&gt;

==Overview==
The series, created by Los Angeles [[improvisational comedy|improvisational comedians]] Kent Nichols and Douglas Sarine, features a ninja who answers e-mails from "viewers" (a similar format to Ask Zorbak and [[Homestar Runner|Strong Bad Email]], which was an influence on Ask A Ninja's creators according to Kent Nichols).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=March 29, 2007 |url=http://www.citynews.ca/blogs/webnation_9277.aspx |title=Interview with Amber MacArthur on Webnation |accessdate=2007-06-13 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630154329/http://www.citynews.ca/blogs/webnation_9277.aspx |archivedate=June 30, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to an interview,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livevideo.com/video/BikiniNews/89EDA3A010354884B99346227C2EB779/episode-52-the-askaninja-interview.aspx Bikini News – Episode 52: The AskANinja Interview]. Retrieved June 13, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ask A Ninja'' was originally supposed to be an animated show about two Ninjas living in [[Orange County, California|Orange County]].

=== Podcast ===
The episodes feature constant and erratic camera-angle changes, as well as enthusiastic and wild hand gestures by the Ninja. Each episode usually ranges from four to seven minutes, usually ending with Ninja's signature remark to each questioner: "I look forward to killing you soon!" New episodes had been released bi-weekly during the height of the podcast's popularity. Starting with Episode 23, "Ninternships", the behind-the-scenes-team decided to have sponsors for their episodes.

Although episodes 1 to 16 are answered by Ninja in front of a featureless blue background, the action sometimes goes to other places, such as inside a car or another house. Episodes after the "Ninja Omnibus" episode use the Ninja edited onto a red circle gradient background, and episodes after the "BBQ" episode changed to blue.

The episodes start with the song "I Am Ninja", performed by The Neu Tickles and written by satirist [[Brently Heilbron]].

==Re-launch==
On October 4, 2010 the web series returned to re-launch as a daily series with new videos each week day. The new lineup will feature an experimental sketch show along with a weekly wrap up show (Ask A Ninja Weekly Wrap) and a showcase of emerging web shows that the Ninja likes.  Web series producer Brett Register, creator of ''[[The Crew (webseries)|The Crew]]'', ''A Good Knight's Quest'' and ''Craig &amp; The Werewolf'', was hired on as the new day-to-day producer-director for ''Ask a Ninja''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.tubefilter.tv/2010/09/02/ask-a-ninja-coming-back-strong-hires-brett-register/ ‘Ask A Ninja’ Coming Back Strong, Hires Brett Register | Tubefilter News] – September 2, 2010. Retrieved September 2, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advertising and other appearances==
''Ask A Ninja'' has widespread popular appeal, and has appeared in numerous media outlets.

Douglas Sarine was once asked to report as a guest film critic on [[National Public Radio]]'s show, ''[[All Things Considered]]''; his review there of ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest]]'' is classified as a special delivery episode.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5542014 'Pirates' Any Good? Ask a Ninja, If You Dare | NPR.org]&lt;/ref&gt; In a 5- to 10-minute piece ''Ask A Ninja'' interviewed ''[[Blades of Glory]]'' stars [[Will Ferrell]] and [[Jon Heder]] for which he asked a series of movie related questions. At the end of the interview he ice skates circles around Olympic gold medalist [[Scott Hamilton (figure skater)|Scott Hamilton]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beyondhollywood.com/gallery/video-ask-a-ninja-interviews-will-ferrell-and-jon-heder/ Video: Ask a Ninja Interviews Will Ferrell and Jon Heder | Beyond Hollywood]&lt;/ref&gt; One notable episode was shot in the ''[[MythBusters]]'' warehouse with [[Jamie Hyneman|Jamie]] and [[Adam Savage|Adam]], where he disputed the theory of gravity, but when asked for proof, claimed he would have to perform a move in which he would simultaneously pull out both their brains.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dsc.discovery.com/videos/mythbusters-ask-a-ninja.html MythBusters: Ask a Ninja | Discovery Channel]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
At the end of older episodes, the Ninja advertised the Ninja-Mart Store, where viewers may buy "Ask A Ninja"-related merchandise. More recent episodes have ended with Ninja advertising Ask A Ninja's first DVD release in the style of [[HeadOn]] commercials. He's also advertised ''[[The Simpsons Game]]'' as well as [[Doritos]]. Ask a Ninja also started hosting their videos with [[CastFire]]'s video hosting service,&lt;ref&gt;[http://newteevee.com/2007/05/18/ask-a-ninja-now-powered-by-castfire/ Ask a Ninja: Now Powered by Castfire] – May 18, 2007. Retrieved June 13, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; likely to add to their monetization strategy.

Recently, Nichols and Sarine appeared as commentators on [[VH1]]'s ''[[Best Week Ever]]''. The Ninja, however, does not appear with them. The Ninja appears alongside [[Margaret Cho]] in [[Liam Kyle Sullivan]]'s "Let Me Borrow That Top" music video. The Ninja has also appeared as a judge on [[Yahoo]]'s talent-show contest.

On April 11, 2007 episode of ''[[The Showbiz Show]]'', the Ninja, in a pre-recorded segment, provided a short review of the first episode of the final season of ''[[The Sopranos]]''.

[[Jessica Lee Rose]] appeared with Ninja in an episode called "Jessica Lee Rose" to celebrate his series' 50th episode anniversary and to comment on the death of [[lonelygirl15]]. Vodcast [[Bikini News]] featured an extensive interview with Nichols (against the familiar Ask A Ninja background) discussing the origins of the show.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livevideo.com/video/BikiniNews/89EDA3A010354884B99346227C2EB779/episode-52-the-askaninja-inte.aspx Episode 52: The AskANinja Interview – Channel: BikiniNews on LiveVideo.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Day of the Ninja Involvement===
Since 2006, ''Ask a Ninja'' has been involved in organizing and coordinating events for the annual [[Day of the Ninja]], December 5.

On December 5, 2006, the Ninja made his first live onstage appearance at the ''Ask a Ninja'' DVD Release Party, where he played the guitar after opening act The Neu Tickles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://laughingsquid.com/ask-a-ninja-dvd-release-party/ Ask A Ninja DVD Release PartyBRING DANNY BACK TO WIKIPEDIA | Laughing Squid&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The Ninja made his second live stage appearance at the [[El Rey Theatre]] on December 5, 2007 with [[Patton Oswalt]] and [[Hard 'n Phirm]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.myspace.com/askaninja MySpace.com – Ask A Ninja – WEST HOLLYWOOD – www.myspace.com/askaninja&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; On December 5, 2007, The Ninja guest starred on ''[[Attack of the Show]]'' alongside [[Olivia Munn]] on [[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4]] while [[Kevin Pereira|Kevin]] was on the road hosting live from people's homes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2581">The '''Association of Broadcasting and Allied Staffs''' ('''ABS''') was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[broadcasting]] [[trade union]].

The organisation was founded in 1945 with the merger of the [[BBC Staff (Wartime) Association]] and the [[Association of BBC Engineers]] to form the '''BBC Staff Association'''.  It was regarded as a non-political organisation for employees of the [[BBC]], but despite challenges from various trade unions, it remained the primary association of BBC employees.  In 1946, [[Leslie Littlewood]] was elected General Secretary, a post he was to hold until 1968.&lt;ref&gt;[[Asa Briggs]], ''The History of Broadcasting in the United Kingdom: Volume IV: Sound and Vision'', pp.124-125&lt;/ref&gt;

With the creation of [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]], the association aimed to expand its remit to cover the new broadcaster, and accordingly renamed itself the '''Association of Broadcasting Staff''' ('''ABS''') in 1956.  This was unsuccessful, but the ABS was recognised by the [[Independent Television Authority]].

In 1963, the ABS finally affiliated to the [[Trades Union Congress]] (TUC), and was able to normalise its relations with other TUC members. It was renamed the Association of Broadcasting and Allied Staffs in 1974.

In 1972, [[Tony Hearn]] became General Secretary, and under his leadership, the union began negotiations with the [[National Association of Theatrical and Kine Employees]].  The two unions finally merged in 1984 to form the [[Broadcasting and Entertainment Trades Alliance]].

As of 1982, the union had a membership of 15,510, and published a monthly journal, ''ABStract''.&lt;ref name="tuh82"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marsh|first1=Arthur|title=Trade Union Handbook|edition=3|date=1984|publisher=Gower|location=Aldershot|isbn=0566024268|pages=151-152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Azerbaijan State Song and Dance Ensemble''' was created in 1938 by [[Uzeyir Hajibeyov]], the founder of classic [[Music of Azerbaijan|Azerbaijani music]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

After [[Fikret Amirov]]’s death, the ensemble was renamed after him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

Prominent dance masters such as [[Amina Dilbazi]], Tutu Hamidova, Boyukagha Mammadov, Roza Jalilova, Aliya Ramazanova, Afag Melikova, Kamil Dadashov, Alikram Aslanov, Nadir Mammadov and others were trained by the choreographic group of the ensemble.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

They were fairy-glowbug creatures who lived in Blinkin land who had small wings which lit up and glowed in rainbow colours when their bodies were squeezed.

Along with the plush dolls Blinkins were small dolls, playsets, accessories, books and videos. The small versions each came with a pet or accessory and a butterfly comb.

Barre classes attract people who want to develop the lean muscle tone of a ballerina.&lt;ref name="time1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="time2"/&gt; Supposed benefits include improved strength,&lt;ref name="greatist1"/&gt; posture,&lt;ref name="greatist1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fm1"/&gt; flexibility,&lt;ref name="webmd1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="greatist1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fm1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ace1"/&gt; balance,&lt;ref name="greatist1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fm1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="time1"/&gt; stability,&lt;ref name="fm1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ace1"/&gt; endurance,&lt;ref name="time1"/&gt; and muscle definition,&lt;ref name="greatist1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fm1"/&gt; together with weight loss&lt;ref name="greatist1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fm1"/&gt; and reduced stress.&lt;ref name="fm1"/&gt; The exercises target muscles that support and stabilise the body and which are often neglected in everyday life and by other forms of exercise.&lt;ref name="time1"/&gt; 

Beyond purely physical goals, barre develops control and a particular aesthetic.&lt;ref name="time1"/&gt;

==Criticisms and risks==
One criticism of barre is that strength gains from small, isometric exercises do not build [[functional strength]] in the same way that [[compound movements]] common in traditional [[strength training]] do,&lt;ref name="greatist1"/&gt; because many of the movements used in barre class are not used anywhere but in dance.&lt;ref name="time1"/&gt; Furthermore, isometric movements are less effective than compound movements at encouraging muscle fibre growth and increased metabolic rate that will help reach weight loss goals.&lt;ref name="greatist1"/&gt; Neither are barre classes as effective as traditional [[aerobics]] classes at building [[cardio-vascular fitness]],&lt;ref name="webmd1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="time1"/&gt; typically only raising heart rates to 40–50% of maximum.&lt;ref name="greatist1"/&gt; In terms of energy output, barre typically does not burn many calories and its energy demands more closely resemble walking than running.&lt;ref name="time1"/&gt;

Some barre classes adopt the ballet aesthetic of keeping the lower back straight, achieved by tucking the pelvis. This practice can lead to back pain and injuries.&lt;ref name="time1"/&gt; The balletic [[plié]] movement used in many barre classes relies on bending the knee outwards with the legs rotated away from the centreline of the body. The pressure this places on the knees can increase the risk of knee injury, particularly if someone goes running immediately after a barre class.&lt;ref name="time1"/&gt;

== History ==
Barre was created by ballerina [[Lotte Berk]] in [[London]] in 1959. After injuring her back, Berk got the idea of combining her ballet bar routines with her rehabilitative therapy to form an exercise system. In 1959 she opened The Lotte Berk Studio in her West End basement. &lt;ref name="greatist1"/&gt; She numbered [[Joan Collins]] and [[Barbra Streisand]] among her students.&lt;ref name="greatist1"/&gt;

One of Berk's students, [[Lydia Bach]], brought barre to the United States.&lt;ref name="greatist1"/&gt; She opened the [[Lotte Berk Method]] studio in [[New York City]] in 1971, where it operated until 2005.&lt;ref name="greatist1"/&gt; Instructors from the studio went on to found some of the major chains providing barre classes, including [[Physique 57]],&lt;ref name="greatist1"/&gt; [[The Bar Method]],&lt;ref name="greatist1"/&gt; and [[Exhale Spa]].&lt;ref name="greatist1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=DeVito|first1=Fred|title=Meet the Founders|url=https://www.exhalespa.com/meet-our-founders|website=exhale|accessdate=27 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barre rapidly expanded in popularity in the 2010s.&lt;ref name="greatist1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fm1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ace1"/&gt; By 2015, the [[Pure Barre]] chain alone had nearly 300 studios in the United States, and The Bar Method had over 80.&lt;ref name="greatist1"/&gt;  The Los Angeles based chain [[Pop Physique]] popularized Barre by appealing to a younger urban hipster demographic,{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} opening studios In Los Angeles, New York, and San Francisco. [[Sadie Lincoln]], co-founder of the [[barre3]] chain of studios attributes the growth of popularity of barre to people wanting smaller, more connected fitness classes in the economic climate following the [[Global Financial Crisis]].&lt;ref name="fm1"/&gt; [[Tanya Becker]], co-founder of the Physique 57 chain suggests that the appeal of barre is that classes deliver well-rounded exercise in a short space of time.&lt;ref name="fm1"/&gt; The [[American Council on Exercise]] noted a rise in popularity of barre classes after the release of the 2010 movie ''[[Black Swan (film)|Black Swan]]''.&lt;ref name="ace1"/&gt;

&lt;!-- what "sex-related origins"?

The sex-related origins of the exercise program remain controversial.&lt;ref&gt;The sexual origins of the popular barre workout http://www.cnn.com/2018/01/24/health/barre-sexual-history-partner/?iid=ob_health_core_homepage&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

"'''Year One'''", later referred to as "'''Batman: Year One'''", is an [[American comic book]] [[story arc]] published by [[DC Comics]] which recounts the superhero [[Batman]]'s first year as a crime-fighter. It was written by [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]], illustrated by [[David Mazzucchelli]], colored by [[Richmond Lewis]], and lettered by [[Todd Klein]]. ''Batman: Year One'' originally appeared in issues #404–407 of the comic book title ''[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]]'' in 1987. As well as recounting [[Batman]]'s early crime-fighting career, the story simultaneously examines the life of recently transferred officer [[James Gordon (comics)|James Gordon]] – eventually building towards their partnership.

There have been several reprints of the story: a [[hardcover]], multiple [[Trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]] editions (one in standard comics paper with simpler coloring and one deluxe version with rich detailing in the colors &amp;mdash; both colored by [[Richmond Lewis]]) and it has been included in ''The Complete Frank Miller Batman'' hardcover. The [[story arc]] was adapted into an [[Batman: Year One (film)|animated feature]] in 2011.

==Publication history==
===Background===
[[Batman]] (Bruce Wayne) is a superhero appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[DC Comics]] who debuted in "[[The Case of the Chemical Syndicate]]", a story published in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #27 (May 1939). He was created by artist [[Bob Kane]] and writer [[Bill Finger]] to capitalize on the success of DC's other superhero [[Superman]] and was inspired by characters from [[pulp magazine|pulp fiction]] stories, such as [[the Shadow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Batman - The Complete History: The Life and Times of the Dark Knight|author=Les Daniels|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Batman_The_Complete_History.html?id=73wknu2cVIkC|pages=18–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boichel, Bill. "Batman: Commodity as Myth." ''The Many Lives of the Batman: Critical Approaches to a Superhero and His Media''. Routledge: London, 1991. {{ISBN|978-0-85170-276-6}}, pp. 6–7.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Origin of Batman|Batman's origin story]] was introduced in a two-page, 12-panel story by Kane and Finger from ''Detective Comics'' #33 (Nov. 1939). In the story, a young Bruce witnesses the murder of his parents [[Thomas Wayne|Thomas]] and [[Martha Wayne|Martha]] at the hands of a mugger. Bruce vows to avenge his parents' deaths by fighting crime; he takes the persona of Batman after a [[bat]] flies through his window one night. For the story, Finger lifted elements from tales published in ''[[Popular Detective]]'' and ''[[The Phantom]]'', while Kane traced artwork of [[Tarzan]] and from ''[[Junior G-Men]]''.&lt;ref name="nerd"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Weldon|first1=Glen|title=The Caped Crusade: Batman and the Rise of Nerd Culture|date=2016|publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]]|isbn=978-1-4767-5669-1|url=https://www.amazon.com/Caped-Crusade-Batman-Rise-Culture/dp/1476756694|accessdate=September 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years afterward, much of DC's continuity became convoluted and contradictory. Examples of this were present in Batman's origin: in a 1948 story, Finger gave the mugger a name ([[Joe Chill]]), and in 1956 wrote that he killed Bruce's parents on behalf of the mob. Finger also went on to suggest that the Batman persona was inspired by a bat costume Thomas wore to a [[masquerade ball]]. Other stories depicted Bruce traveling across the world to learn the skills he would need as Batman.&lt;ref name="nerd"/&gt; In an effort to resolve continuity errors like these in the [[DC Universe]], [[Marv Wolfman]] and [[George Pérez]] produced the 12-issue [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]''.&lt;ref name="backissue30"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greeberger|first1=Robert|title=Crisis at 30: A Look Back at the Most Influential Crossover in Comics History|journal=[[Back Issue!]]|date=August 2015|issue=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wolfman's plans for the DC Universe after ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' included relaunching every DC comic with a new first issue.&lt;ref name="Slugfest152"&gt;{{cite book |last=Tucker |first=Reed |date=October 2017 |title=Slugfest |location= [[New York City]]|publisher=[[Da Capo Press]]|page=152 |isbn=0306825473 |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Slugfest.html?id=hoyYDgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=kp_read_button#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the production of ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'', [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]] became the writer of [[Marvel Comics]]' ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]''.&lt;ref name="nerd"/&gt; Miller had originally been the series' [[penciller]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Sanderson|first = Peter|authorlink = Peter Sanderson|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1970s|title = Marvel Chronicle A Year by Year History|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year = 2008|location= London, United Kingdom|page = 189|isbn =978-0-7566-4123-8|quote= In this issue the great longtime ''Daredevil'' artist Gene Colan was succeeded by a new penciller who would become a star himself: Frank Miller.}}&lt;/ref&gt; but editor [[Dennis O'Neil]] soon made him the series' writer.&lt;ref name="O'NeilInt"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.manwithoutfear.com/daredevil-interviews/ONeil | title = Interview with Dennis O'Neil|first= Kuljit|last= Mithra|date= February 1998 | publisher =  ManWithoutFear.com |accessdate= May 10, 2013 | archivedate= March 21, 2013 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130321185605/http://www.manwithoutfear.com/daredevil-interviews/ONeil}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sales rose dramatically after Miller began to write. For one critically acclaimed ''Daredevil'' story, Miller collaborated with artist [[David Mazzucchelli]]. Miller went to work for DC as well, and produced the influential four-issue limited series ''[[The Dark Knight Returns]]'' (1986). O'Neil also made the move to DC.&lt;ref name="nerd"/&gt;

===Development===
[[File:Frank Miller Fan Expo Wiki.jpg|thumb|left|Frank Miller, the author of "Year One", at the Fan Expo 2016 in Toronto, Canada]]
The contract Miller signed to produce ''The Dark Knight Returns'' also required him to write a revamped Batman origin story. While Miller handled the writing and artwork of ''The Dark Knight Returns'', he simply wrote "Year One", while Mazzucchelli joined to pencil.&lt;ref name="nerd"/&gt; In the past, Miller had been overwhelmed by having to handle both writing and illustration duties.&lt;ref name="Back21"&gt;{{cite journal|last= Cordier|first=Philippe|title=Seeing Red: Dissecting Daredevil's Defining Years|journal=[[Back Issue!]]|issue=21|pages=33–60|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date= April 2007|location= Raleigh, North Carolina}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Todd Klein]] was the story's [[letterer]], while Mazzucchelli's wife [[Richmond Lewis]] handled coloring. O'Neil edited the issues.&lt;ref name="nerd"/&gt; According to O'Neil, the contract Miller and Mazzucchelli signed to produce "Year One" in the [[Ongoing series|ongoing]] ''[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]]'' series guaranteed publication within 6 months.&lt;ref name="ONeil13th"/&gt;

[[File:6.28.12DavidMazzuchelliByLuigiNovi36.jpg|thumb|[[David Mazzucchelli]] autographing a copy of the collected story in 2012]]
"Year One" was originally conceived as a [[graphic novel]]. O'Neil, who had been asked to edit several issues of ''Batman'', was friends with Miller and was able to learn of the story. Reflecting on poor sales of ''Batman'', O'Neil caught Miller one day while on a walk in [[Los Angeles]] and convinced him and Mazzucchelli to serialize the story in the ongoing series.&lt;ref name="ONeil13th"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Greenfield|first1=Dan|title=The DENNY O’NEIL INTERVIEWS — Batman: Year One|url=https://13thdimension.com/the-denny-oneil-interviews-batman-year-one/|website=13th Dimension|accessdate=May 20, 2018|date=September 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miller was initially reluctant; he felt this would be hard because he had to ensure the story stayed canonical to the DC Universe, something he did not have to worry about when writing ''The Dark Knight Returns''. In addition, Miller's pacing would have to be altered because of ongoing series' relatively small page counts. O'Neil reasoned that ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' had completely remade the DC Universe, so Miller would be able to have the same creative freedom that ''The Dark Knight Returns'' provided.&lt;ref name="nerd"/&gt; He also reassured Miller that he and Mazzucchelli "weren’t going to lose anything" by serializing it.&lt;ref name="ONeil13th"/&gt;

Miller has said he kept Kane and Finger's basic story for "Year One" but expanded it.&lt;ref name="NPRTalk"&gt;{{cite web|title='Batman' Author Frank Miller|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4704766|publisher=[[NPR]]|accessdate=May 22, 2018|date=June 15, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In writing the story, Miller looked for parts of Batman's origin that were never explored. He left the core elements, such as the murder of Bruce's parents, intact, but reduced them to brief [[Flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]]. Bruce's globe-trotting adventures was something Miller removed, as he found uninteresting. Rather than portraying Batman as a larger-than-life icon as he had in ''The Dark Knight Returns'', Miller chose to characterize "Year One"'s Batman as an average, inexperienced man trying to make a change in society because Miller believed a superhero is least interesting when most effective. Examples of this include Batman underestimating his opponents, getting shot by police, and his costume being too big. The story's violence was kept street-level and gritty, emphasizing [[Noir fiction|noir]] and realism.&lt;ref name="nerd"/&gt;

In illustrating, Mazzucchelli sought to make "Year One" look grimy, dark, and muted. His interpretation of [[Gotham City]] was designed to symbolize corruption, featuring muddy colors that gave the impression of the city being dirty and needing a hero. The newsprint paper used in ''Batman'' was unable to reproduce the bright coloring and visual effects of ''The Dark Knight Returns'', so Mazzucchelli took on "Year One" with a more grounded and darker approach.&lt;ref name="visual"/&gt;

===Publication===
In accordance with Wolfman's plans,&lt;ref name="Slugfest152"/&gt; O'Neil initially saw "Year One" as the start of the second volume of ''Batman'' and expected the first part to be its first issue. However, Miller rejected this idea. He explained: "I don't need to slash through continuity with as sharp a blade as I thought. Doing the ''Dark Knight'' has shown me there's been enough good material... I didn't feel that fleshing out an unknown part of Batman's history justified wiping out 50 years of [adventures]."&lt;ref name="visual"/&gt; Thus, the four "Year One" issues bear no continuity to past issues of ''Batman''.&lt;ref name="visual"&gt;{{cite book|last=Manning|first= Matthew K.|last2=Dolan|first2=Hannah, ed.|chapter= 1980s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |year=2010 |isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9 |page= 227 |quote =  Melding Miller's noir sensibilities, realistic characterization, and gritty action with Mazzucchelli's brilliant iconic imagery, "Year One" thrilled readers and critics alike...as well as being one of the influences for the 2005 film ''Batman Begins''.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The story recounts the beginning of Bruce Wayne's career as [[Batman]] and [[James Gordon (comics)|Jim Gordon]]'s with the [[Gotham City Police Department]]. Bruce Wayne returns home to [[Gotham City]] at the age of twenty-five from training abroad in martial arts, man-hunting, and science for the past 12 years, and James Gordon moves to Gotham City with his wife, Barbara, after a transfer from [[Chicago]]. Both are swiftly acquainted with the corruption and violence of Gotham City, with Gordon witnessing his partner [[Arnold John Flass|Detective Arnold John Flass]] assaulting an African-American teen for fun.

After refusing a proposition from a teenage prostitute [[Holly Robinson (fictional character)|Holly Robinson]], Bruce is reluctantly drawn into a brawl with her violent pimp and is attacked by several prostitutes, including [[dominatrix]] [[Catwoman|Selina Kyle]]. Two police officers shoot and take him in their squad car, but a dazed and bleeding Bruce breaks his handcuffs and causes a crash, dragging the police to a safe distance before fleeing. He reaches [[Wayne Manor]] barely alive and sits before his father’s bust, requesting guidance in his war on crime. A bat crashes through a window and settles on the bust, giving him the inspiration to become the Batman.

Gordon soon works to rid corruption from the force, but, on orders from [[Gillian B. Loeb|Commissioner Gillian Loeb]], several officers attack him, including Flass, who personally threatens Gordon’s pregnant wife. In revenge, the recovering Gordon tracks Flass down, beats him, and leaves him naked and handcuffed in the snow.

As Gordon becomes a minor celebrity for several brave acts, Batman strikes for the first time, attacking a group of thieves. Batman soon works up the ladder, even attacking Flass while the latter was accepting a drug dealer’s bribe. After Batman interrupts a dinner party attended by many of Gotham's corrupt politicians and crime bosses to announce his intention to bring them to justice, including [[Carmine Falcone|Carmine "The Roman" Falcone]], Loeb orders Gordon to bring him in by any means necessary.

As Gordon tries in vain to catch him, Batman attacks Falcone, stripping him naked and tying him up in his bed and dumping his car in the river, infuriating the mob boss. Assistant [[District Attorney]] [[Two-Face|Harvey Dent]] becomes Batman’s first ally, while [[Sarah Essen Gordon|Detective Sarah Essen]] and Gordon witness Batman save an old woman from a runaway truck, after Essen suggested Bruce Wayne as a Batman suspect. Essen holds Batman at gunpoint while Gordon is momentarily dazed, but Batman disarms her and flees to an abandoned building.

Claiming the building has been scheduled for demolition, Loeb orders a bomb to be dropped on it, forcing Batman into the fortified basement, where he abandons his belt as it catches fire. A [[SWAT]] team led by trigger-happy officer Branden is sent in and attempts to trap Batman in the basement. After tranquilizing Branden, Batman dodges bullets as Branden's team opens fire on him, barely managing to survive after two bullet wounds. Enraged as the team’s carelessly fired bullets injure several people outside, Batman beats the team into submission and, after using a device to attract the bats of his cave to him, he flees amid the chaos. After witnessing him in action, Selina Kyle dons a costume of her own to begin a life of crime.

Gordon has a brief affair with Essen, while Batman intimidates a mob drug dealer for information. The dealer comes to Gordon to testify against Flass, who is brought up on charges. Upset with Gordon's exploits, Loeb blackmails Gordon against pressing charges with proof of his affair. After bringing Barbara with him to interview Bruce Wayne, investigating his connection to Batman, Gordon confesses the affair to her.

Batman sneaks into Falcone’s manor, overhearing a plan against Gordon, but is interrupted when Selina Kyle, hoping to build a reputation after her robberies were pinned on Batman, attacks Falcone and his bodyguards, aided from afar by Batman. Identifying Falcone’s plan as the morning comes, the uncostumed Bruce leaves to help.

While leaving home, Gordon spots a motorcyclist enter his garage. Suspicious, Gordon enters to see Johnny Vitti, Falcone's nephew, and his thugs holding his family hostage. Gordon decisively shoots the thugs and chases Vitti, who has fled with the baby. The mysterious motorcyclist, now revealed to the reader as Bruce Wayne, rushes out to chase Vitti. Gordon blows out Vitti's car tire on a bridge and the two fight hand-to-hand, with Gordon losing his glasses, before Vitti and James Gordon Jr. fall over the side. Bruce leaps over the railing and saves the baby. Gordon realizes that he is standing before an unmasked Batman, but says that he is "practically blind without [his] glasses," and lets Bruce go.

In the final scenes of the comic, Flass turns on Loeb, supplying Dent with evidence and testimony, and Loeb resigns. Gordon is promoted to captain and stands on the rooftop waiting to meet Batman to discuss somebody called [[Joker (comics)|the Joker]], who is plotting to poison the reservoir.

==Reception==
DC's post-''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' revamp was a major success, raising sales 22% in the first year, and DC beat Marvel in [[direct market]] sales for the first time in August and September 1987.&lt;ref name="Slugfest157"&gt;{{cite book |last=Tucker |first=Reed |date=October 2017 |title=Slugfest |location= [[New York City]]|publisher=[[Da Capo Press]]|page=157 |isbn=0306825473 |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Slugfest.html?id=hoyYDgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=kp_read_button#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The four "Year One" issues were no exception to this. Two years before the relaunch, ''Batman'' had all-time low sales of 75,000 copies per month; "Year One" sold an average of 193,000 copies an issue, numbers not seen since the early 1970s. Despite this, it did not outsell other books like ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'', and the collected edition sold well but never matched the sales of ''The Dark Knight Returns''.&lt;ref name="nerd"/&gt; The story, with its noir-inspired narrative and dirty violence, quickly caught the attention of readers.&lt;ref name="ComicsVerseReview"/&gt; The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote that "Year One" offered an interesting and entertaining update to the origin of Batman.&lt;ref name="YearOne2007"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Miller |first1=Frank |last2=Mazzucchelli |first2=Dave |title=Batman: Year One |date=January 10, 2007 |publisher=[[DC Comics]] |isbn=0290204895 |edition=Paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Year One"'s characterization, particularly that of Batman and Gordon, has been praised. Hilary Goldstein (''[[IGN]]'') compared their journey to friendship to the plot of the film ''[[Serpico]]''; they found that the two characters' respective story arcs—with Gordon's "illustrat[ing] the corruption in Gotham" and Batman's detailing "the transformation from man to myth"—offered an exploration of Batman's world like no other.&lt;ref name="IGNReview"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Goldstein |first1=Hilary |title=Batman: Year One Review |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2005/06/17/batman-year-one-review |website=[[IGN]] |accessdate=May 30, 2018 |date=June 17, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Glenn Matchett (''ComicsVerse'') wrote that, unlike ''The Dark Knight Returns'', "Year One"'s Batman is more vulnerable and inexperienced, which made the story more memorable.&lt;ref name="ComicsVerseReview"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Matchett |first1=Glenn |title=Frank Miller’s Batman Part One: YEAR ONE, or How Legends are Made |url=https://comicsverse.com/frank-millers-batman-part-one-year-one-or-how-legends-are-made/ |website=ComicsVerse |accessdate=May 30, 2018 |date=September 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nick Roberts (''Geek Syndicate'') thought the characters seemed believable,&lt;ref name="GeekSyndicateReview"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Roberts |first1=Nick |title=‘Classic Comic’ Review – Batman: Year One |url=https://geeksyndicate.co.uk/reviews/%E2%80%98classic-comic%E2%80%99-review-%E2%80%93-batman-year-one/ |website=Geek Syndicate |accessdate=May 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and comics historian Matthew K. Manning called the characterization realistic.&lt;ref name="visual"/&gt;

The story's depiction of Gotham and dark tone has also been acclaimed. Journalist James Lovegrove described "Year One" as a "noir-inflected pulp tale of vigilantism and integrity, focused on a good man doing the right thing in a dirty world" and noted the brutality of its fight sequences.&lt;ref name="100best"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lovegrove |first1=James |title=Batman: Year One |journal=The 100 Greatest Graphic Novels of All Time |date=2016 |issue=1 |pages=92-93 |url=https://archive.org/stream/The_100_Greatest_Graphic_Novels_Of_All_Time#page/n91/mode/2up/search/Batman+Year+One |publisher=[[Future plc]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jason Serafino (''[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]'') wrote that by ignoring many of Batman's trademark gadgets and villains, Miller managed to present Batman in a relatable and thrilling way.&lt;ref name="Complex25"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Serafino |first1=Jason |title=The 25 Best DC Comics Of All Time |url=https://www.complex.com/pop-culture/the-best-dc-comics-of-all-time/all-star-superman |website=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]] |accessdate=May 31, 2018 |date=January 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goldstein found every moment memorable, writing "Miller does not waste a single panel" in presenting a gritty and dark story.&lt;ref name="IGNReview"/&gt; Matchett agreed; he offered particular praise for the scenes depicting Batman clashing with the police, calling them the moment Batman began to become a legend.&lt;ref name="ComicsVerseReview"/&gt;

Mazzucchelli's art was noted as a standout.&lt;ref name="IGNReview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ComicsVerseReview"/&gt;

==Continuity==
Before [[the New 52]] in 2011, ''Batman: Year One'' existed in the mainstream DC continuity, and in the same continuity as the other storylines in Miller's "Dark Knight Universe", consisting of ''[[The Dark Knight Returns]]'', its sequel ''[[The Dark Knight Strikes Again]]'', ''[[The Dark Knight III: The Master Race]]'', ''The Dark Knight Returns: The Last Crusade'', ''[[Spawn/Batman]]'', and ''[[All Star Batman and Robin the Boy Wonder]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sanderson |first=Peter |url=http://comics.ign.com/articles/685/685820p1.html |title='&amp;#39;Comics in Context #119: All-Star Bats'&amp;#39; on IGN |publisher=Comics.ign.com |date=2006-02-06 |accessdate=2011-01-04| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101213055056/http://comics.ign.com/articles/685/685820p1.html| archivedate= 13 December 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, following the New 52 reboot, ''[[Batman: Zero Year]]'' replaced ''Year One'' as the official origin for Batman and ''Year One'' was relegated to the continuity of the [[Batman (Dark Knight Universe)|other Frank Miller storylines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dccomics.com/blog/2013/03/11/the-associated-press-announces-batman-zero-year|title=THE ASSOCIATED PRESS Announces BATMAN: ZERO YEAR|author=|date=11 March 2013|website=dccomics.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151022223622/http://www.dccomics.com/blog/2013/03/11/the-associated-press-announces-batman-zero-year|archivedate=22 October 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', DC [[Reboot (fiction)|rebooted]] many of its titles. ''Year One'' was followed by ''[[Batman: Year Two]]'', but the 1994 ''[[Zero Hour: Crisis in Time]]'' crossover erased ''Year Two'' from continuity. In another continuity re-arrangement, ''Catwoman: Year One'' (''Catwoman Annual'' #2, 1995) posited that Selina Kyle had not actually been a prostitute, but, rather, a thief posing as one in order to commit crimes.

Launched in 1989, following the success of the film ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'', the title ''[[Batman: Legends of the Dark Knight]]'' examines crime-fighting exploits primarily, not exclusively, from the first four to five years of Batman's career. This title rotated in creative teams and time placement, but several stories directly relate to the events of ''Year One'', especially the first arc "Batman: Shaman". In 1998, [[Jeph Loeb]] and [[Tim Sale (artist)|Tim Sale]] created ''[[Batman: The Long Halloween]]'' and ''[[Batman: Dark Victory]]'', two 13-issue maxiseries that recounted Batman's early years as a crime-fighter following the events of Miller's original story and retold the origins of [[Two-Face]] and [[Dick Grayson]]. The ''Year One'' story was continued in the 2005 graphic novel ''[[Batman: The Man Who Laughs]]'', following up on Gordon informing Batman about the Joker, and thus recounting their first official encounter. Two other stories, ''[[Batman and the Monster Men]]'' and ''[[Batman and the Mad Monk]]'' tie into the same time period of Batman's career, filling in the gap between Year One and the Man Who Laughs. The comics ''[[Robin: Year One]]'' and ''[[Batgirl: Year One]]'' describe his sidekicks' origin stories.

==Adaptations==
After the critical failure of ''[[Batman &amp; Robin (film)|Batman &amp; Robin]]'', several attempts were made to [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] the [[Batman in film|Batman film franchise]] with an adaptation of "Year One". [[Joss Whedon]] and [[Joel Schumacher]] both pitched their own takes.&lt;ref name="nerd"/&gt; In 2000, [[Warner Bros.]] hired [[Darren Aronofsky]] to write and direct ''Batman: Year One''. The film was to be written by Miller, who finished an early draft of the script.&lt;ref name=Dana&gt;{{cite news | author = Dana Harris | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117786714 | title = WB sends ''Pi'' guy into the Bat Cave | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = 2000-09-21 | accessdate = 2008-10-17| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120117093609/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117786714| archivedate=January 17, 2012&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The script, however, was a loose adaptation, as it kept most of the themes and elements from the graphic novel but shunned other conventions that were otherwise integral to the character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Brian Linder | work = [[IGN]] | title = The Bat-Men Speak | url = http://movies.ign.com/articles/034/034023p1.html | date = 2000-10-16 | accessdate = 2008-10-17 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081206080319/http://movies.ign.com/articles/034/034023p1.html | archivedate = 2008-12-06 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was shelved by the studio in 2001,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Dana Harris | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117869140 | title = WB: fewer pix, more punch | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = 2002-06-30 | accessdate = 2008-10-17| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120117105000/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117869140| archivedate=January 17, 2012&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; after an individual who claimed to have read Miller's script published a negative review on ''[[Ain't It Cool News]]''.&lt;ref name="nerd"/&gt; In 2016, Miller stated the film was canceled because of creative differences between him and Aronofsky: "It was the first time I worked on a Batman project with somebody whose vision of Batman was darker than mine. My Batman was too nice for him. We would argue about it, and I'd say, 'Batman wouldn't do that, he wouldn't torture anybody'".&lt;ref name="THRInterview"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kit|first1=Borys|title=A Rare Interview With Frank Miller: 'Dark Knight,' the Unmade Darren Aronofsky Batman Movie, and Donald Trump|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/a-rare-interview-frank-miller-871654|website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|accessdate=May 28, 2018|date=March 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, [[Christopher Nolan]] began his series, with the reboot film ''[[Batman Begins]]'', which draws inspiration from "Year One" and other stories.&lt;ref name="nerd"/&gt; ''Batman Begins'' and its sequel ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]'' are set during the same timespan and adopt several elements directly from the graphic novel. Major characters like [[Gillian B. Loeb|Commissioner Loeb]], [[Arnold John Flass|Detective Flass]] and [[Carmine Falcone|Carmine 'The Roman' Falcone]] are featured prominently in ''Batman Begins''. Film critic [[Michael Dodd]] argued that with each major motion picture focused on the Dark Knight's origins, the odes and references to the ''Year One'' comic increased. Comparing ''[[Batman: Mask of the Phantasm|Mask of the Phantasm]]'' with ''[[Batman Begins]]'' he noted that "...Phantasm was a Batman story with ''Year One'' elements, while ''Batman Begins'' was a ''Year One'' story with added features".&lt;ref&gt;Dodd, Michael, "[http://themissingslate.com/2014/08/21/back-to-the-beginning-the-evolving-influence-of-batman-year-one/#.U_jTIvldUgs Back to the Beginning: The Evolving Influence of Batman: Year One] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170712082015/http://themissingslate.com/2014/08/21/back-to-the-beginning-the-evolving-influence-of-batman-year-one/ |date=2017-07-12 }}," The Missing Slate.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, an [[Batman: Year One (film)|animated adaptation]] was released as a [[DC Universe Animated Original Movies|DC Universe Animated Original Movie]]. It was produced by [[Bruce Timm]], co-directed by [[Lauren Montgomery]] and [[Sam Liu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/news.php/news.php?action=fullnews&amp;showcomments=1&amp;id=1030|title=Batman: Year One Animated Update|publisher=worldsfinestonline.com|date=June 13, 2010|accessdate=June 13, 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AEIM0tVT?url=http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/news.php/news.php?action=fullnews|archivedate=August 27, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It features the voices of [[Benjamin McKenzie]] as Bruce Wayne/Batman, [[Bryan Cranston]] as [[James Gordon (comics)|James Gordon]], [[Eliza Dushku]] as Selina Kyle/Catwoman, [[Katee Sackhoff]] as [[Sarah Essen Gordon|Sarah Essen]], [[Grey DeLisle]] as Barbara Gordon, [[Jon Polito]] as Commissioner Loeb, [[Alex Rocco]] as Carmine 'The Roman' Falcone, and Jeff Bennett as Alfred Pennyworth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/batman-year-one-lines-up-179942 |title='Batman: Year One' Lines Up Voice Cast, Sets Comic-Con Premiere (Exclusive) |last=Kit |first=Borys |date=April 20, 2011 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |accessdate=June 18, 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110721213402/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/batman-year-one-lines-up-179942| archivedate= 21 July 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movie premiered at [[San Diego Comic-Con International|Comic-Con]], with a Catwoman short shown in October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailyblam.com/news/2011/06/07/batman-year-one-animated-film-sneak-peek-video-character-designs |title=BATMAN: YEAR ONE Animated Film Sneak Peek Video &amp; Character Designs |publisher=The Daily BLAM! |date= |accessdate=2013-01-23 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130125080019/http://www.dailyblam.com/news/2011/06/07/batman-year-one-animated-film-sneak-peek-video-character-designs |archivedate=2013-01-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12767">The '''book test''' is a classic [[Magic (illusion)#magic tricks|magic trick]] used by [[Mentalism|mentalists]] to demonstrate [[telepathy]]-like effects. The name refers to its early use as a test of mental powers.

==Effect==
An audience member (the "spectator") is called onstage to assist the mentalist. The spectator is shown one or more books, and asked to read a random passage from one of them. The passage may be revealed to the audience, or recorded in some other way for later comparison. The mentalist then typically presents a routine to establish an atmosphere or back story, and proceeds to read the spectator's mind to reveal elements relating to the passage read by the spectator.

==History==
[[File:Johann Nepomuk Hofzinser.jpg|135px|right|thumb|[[Johann Nepomuk Hofzinser]] introduced the first modern example of the book test.]]
[[File:James Randi crop.jpg|135px|right|thumb|[[James Randi]] often performs the trick.]]

Books have been used as props as long ago as the 1450s. In one particularly common trick, the "[[magic coloring book|blow book]]", spectators would blow on the pages of a book which would then reveal images, colors, or text. However, these were not similar to modern book tests, as the "magic" was simply the change in appearance.{{sfn|Christian|2007}}&lt;ref group=N&gt;When the history of book tests are discussed, it is common to see a reference to ancient Egypt as the earliest mention. These refer to a series of stories about Se-Osiris and his father Setna Khaemuast, imperial scribe for [[Rameses the Great]]. In one story, Se-Osiris is able to read the contents of a sealed scroll, and thereby prove the superiority of Egyptian magicians. The events are described in magical terms, and whether or not any sort of event like this took place is unknown, nor is it clear if this is anything like a book test, or more likely, [[billet reading]]. See [http://vr.theatre.ntu.edu.tw/hlee/course/th6_520/sty_egy/minor/seallet.htm "Se-Osiris and the Sealed Letter"], National Taiwan University&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern concept of the book test involves the magician revealing a word, phrase, or image that the spectator has selected at random. The earliest known example is a variation on the modern [[Twenty One Card Trick]], in which a series of operations reveals the chosen item through basic mathematics. The magician first asks a spectator to choose a word or figure on a starting page. An associated number, say the column or group that the figure appears in, is used to select another page. For instance, if the spectator picks a figure in column two, they might flip forward two pages. Here the spectator sees the same figure somewhere else on the page, and repeats the process. After three flips the magician stops them and reveals the figure.{{sfn|Christian|2007}}

It is known that a version of this sort of book test was created by well-known publisher [[Girolamo Scotto]] and demonstrated for the Emperor of Austria in 1572.{{sfn|Jay|2008|p=227}} However, printed versions from this time are not extant. The earliest surviving example was found by Italian magician Vanni Bossi in the book ''Il Laberinto'', originally published in 1607 by Andrea Ghisi. An English translation was published in 1610 under the title ''Wits laberynth, or, the exercise of idlenesse''.&lt;ref&gt;Andrea Ghisi, [https://books.google.com/books?id=yweBMgAACAAJ "Wits labyrinth, or the exercise of idlenesse"], Purfoot, 1610&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed ''Wits laberynth'' was the inspiration for the same trick in Nicholas Hunt's ''Newe Recreations'', published in London in 1631.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Hunt, [https://books.google.com/books/about/Newe_Recreations.html?id=ologcgAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y "Newe Recreations"], 1631&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Clark|2012|p=172}}

Modern variations of the original "labyrinth" concept using gimmicked books are widespread, although they vary greatly in nature. The first modern example is widely suggested to have been introduced by [[Johann Nepomuk Hofzinser]] sometime between 1865 and 1875, generally known simply as "The Word".&lt;ref&gt;Ottokar Fischer &amp; Richard Hatch, [http://www.lybrary.com/the-magic-of-j-n-hofzinser-p-779.html "The Magic of J. N. Hofzinser"], 1985&lt;/ref&gt; Variations using a single page that can be inserted into other books, sometimes known as the "True Test" or "Modern Magazine Test", were first developed by in the 1930s by [[U.F. Grant]], a well-known inventor of magic tricks.

A very different style of book test uses unmodified books, and yet produces similar results. Originally developed by magician David Hoy and published in his 1963 ''The Bold and Subtle Miracles of Dr. Faust'',&lt;ref&gt;David Hoy, [https://books.google.com/books?id=m_nwPQAACAAJ "The Bold and Subtle Miracles of Dr. Faust"], Ireland Magic Company, 1963&lt;/ref&gt; the "Bold Book Test" is widely considered a classic and inventive trick. The trick, often with Hoy's name removed, has been published in dozens of books and pamphlets.{{sfn|Clark|2012|p=173}}

The book test has been a staple of mentalist acts throughout the 20th century. One of the best known variations of this trick was repeatedly performed by [[The Piddingtons]], whose version included elaborate stagecraft that placed Lesley Piddington, the "reader", in a variety of bizarre locations, from [[London Tower]] to a [[diving bell]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/hindsight/the-amazing-piddingtons/3563190 "The Amazing Piddingtons"], Radio National, Australian Broadcasting Company&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Randi]] uses the trick as a staple of his impromptu shows, selecting among a wide variety of methods at whim.&lt;ref&gt; Susana Martinez-Conde et al, [https://books.google.com/books?id=3p8mb-BzUKwC&amp;pg=PT175 "Sleights of Mind: What the neuroscience of magic reveals about our brains"], Profile Books, 2011, pp. 175-183.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Method==
There are many versions of the book test. The magician may use a single book, a single page or multiple books. In each case there are multiple variants. Methods using more than one book generally used unmodified books, or ''naturals''. These can be distinguished because the mentalist hands the books to the spectator to choose among, and has some sort of [[Shuffling#riffle|riffle]] or fast flipping of the pages later in the trick.{{sfn|Clark|2012|p=172}} Methods using a modified book, a ''gimmick'', allow free selection of the word from any page. In cases using the dictionary test principle have the magician holding the book in front of them, facing out.{{sfn|Clark|2012|p=53}}

===Mnemonic gimmicks===
Another major class of book tests involves a [[mnemonic]] device to distribute "money words" across a page. For instance, a given page might have the word "Abermarle" on it, and this would be the only "proper name" that starts with the letter A and the spectator would be invited to select a proper name beginning with A. "Hybrid" systems replace the gimmick book with a single gimmick page, which is styled and sized to fit within a target magazine or book. The mentalist must prepare the book themselves, inserting the page into any suitable book or magazine. For this version, the mentalist must use some form of a [[Equivocation (magic)#Equivoque|equivocation]] to ensure the spectator chooses the right page. There are a wide variety of forces used for this purpose.{{sfn|Clark|2012|pp=175-178}}

In both cases the spectator is handed the gimmicked book, or allowed to select among many similar examples. The spectator is then instructed to open and select a word off the page, with the word selection being limited, for example only allowing "odd words" or "proper names." The mentalist then asks the spectator a single question, typically "what is the first letter of the word you are thinking of?" They then apply the mnemonic to return the word, and reveal.{{sfn|Clark|2012|pp=175-178}}

There are a variety of systems used to create the word selection.  The original method, called "The Word," was developed by U.F. Grant,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.geniimagazine.com/magicpedia/U.F._Grant&lt;/ref&gt; but a number of variations exist. All require some preparation to use properly.

===Dictionary gimmicks===
The "dictionary test" is a gimmicked book test that anyone can prepare using any book, but works best with dictionaries, encyclopedias, books of lists, or other texts where there is some sort of obvious first word that is called out in the text.{{sfn|Clark|2012|pp=51-54}}

Using a dictionary, the gimmick is prepared by finding the first defined word on the left page, which is normally bolded or larger, and writing it in fine pencil on the top of the right page. The magician then holds the book open in front of the spectator and riffles with the left hand, and asks the spectator to call "stop" at any point. The magician then points to the upper right corner (blindly, as the book is still facing away from the magician) and while the spectator is looking there, peeks at the other corner, which is turned just enough to be visible.{{sfn|Clark|2012|pp=51-54}}

A commercial variation of the dictionary test is known as "Flashback," and comes in the form of a complete gimmicked book. Instead of the word appearing faintly at the top of the page, it is arranged so the last word on the left page is the same as the first word on the right page. In some forms the antonym appears on the mirror page, instead of the same word. For instance, if the word "day" appears as the first word on the left page, a straight flashback would put the word "day" on the left page, while an antonym version puts "night" there instead. Flashback variations are often incorporated in gimmick books supporting other methods as well.

===Other variations===
The "Page, Line and Word" trick uses two or three spectators, handing one a book (the "reader"), another an envelope, and the third pencil and paper (the "writer"). The writer is asked to ''imagine'' opening the book and selecting a word at random, and then writes down the page, line and word number they imagined. The magician then palms the writer's slip and hands a prepared slip to the reader, who opens the book to the selected section. The third spectator then opens the envelope to reveal the same word.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Mandelberg, [https://books.google.com/books?id=NxEpR_uJGUAC "Easy Mind-Reading Tricks"], Sterling Publishing, 2005, pp. 59-62.&lt;/ref&gt;

The "[[1089 (number)#In magic|1089 force]]" is a natural that relies on the mathematical manipulation of three-digit numbers such that the answer to a series of seemingly random operations will always result in the number 1089. The spectator is then asked to turn to page 108 and read the 9th word. Mathematical forces of this sort, similar to the original "labyrinth" type tests, are no longer common as these are widely known to the audience.&lt;ref&gt;Susana Martinez-Conde et al, [https://books.google.com/books?id=3p8mb-BzUKwC&amp;pg=PT175 "Sleights of Mind: What the neuroscience of magic reveals about our brains"], Profile Books, 2011, pp. 175-190.&lt;/ref&gt;

The "coin force," which can be performed with a number of props instead of coins, is essentially a combination of the natural and the flashback concepts. A word or statement from a natural is selected, and then some sort of marker, normally a quarter, is inserted in that page near the spine. As the magician riffles the book, they can easily flip to that page when the spectator calls "stop". This relies on nothing other than the magician holding the book firmly by the spine while it is riffled, both to obscure the coin as well as to keep it from falling out.{{sfn|Jay|2008|pp=226-227}}

The '''British Academy of Film and Television Arts''' ('''BAFTA''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ɑː|f|t|ə}}) is an independent charity that supports, develops and promotes the art forms of the moving image (film, television and games) in the United Kingdom. In addition to its annual awards ceremonies, BAFTA has an international programme of learning events and initiatives offering access to talent through workshops, masterclasses, scholarships, lectures and mentoring schemes in the UK and the United States.

==Origins==
BAFTA started out as the '''British Film Academy''', was founded in 1947 by a group of directors [[David Lean]], [[Alexander Korda]], [[Roger Manvell]], [[Laurence Olivier]], [[Emeric Pressburger]], [[Michael Powell]], [[Michael Balcon]], [[Carol Reed]], and other major figures of the British film industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bafta.org/print/heritage/features/david-lean/david-leans-letter-to-the-academy,55,GAL.html |title=David Lean's Letter to the Academy |publisher=Bafta.org |date= |accessdate=16 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/event/ev0000123/overview|title=BAFTA Awards: Overview|access-date=2017-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

David Lean was the founding chairman of the academy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bafta.org/heritage/features/sir-david-lean-1908-1991|title=Sir David Lean (1908-1991)|website=www.bafta.org|language=en|access-date=2017-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Film Awards ceremony took place in May 1949 and honouring the films ''[[The Best Years of Our Lives]]'', ''[[Odd Man Out]]'' and ''[[The World Is Rich]]''.

The '''Guild of Television Producers and Directors''' was set up in 1953 with the first awards ceremony in October 1954, and in 1958 merged with the British Film Academy to form the '''Society of Film and Television Arts''', whose inaugural meeting was held at Buckingham Palace and presided over by HRH The Duke of Edinburgh.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

In 1976, [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth]], [[The Duke of Edinburgh]], [[The Princess Royal]] and [[The Earl Mountbatten of Burma]] officially opened the organisation's headquarters at 195 [[Piccadilly]], London, and in March the Society became the British Academy of Film and Television Arts.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

==Charitable mission==
BAFTA is an independent charity with a mission to "support, develop and promote the art forms of the moving image, by identifying and rewarding excellence, inspiring practitioners and benefiting the public".

It is a membership organisation comprising approximately 7,500 individuals worldwide who are creatives and professionals working in and making a contribution to the film, television and games industries in the UK.

In addition to its high-profile awards ceremonies, BAFTA manages a year-round programme of educational events and initiatives including film screenings and Q&amp;As, tribute evenings, interviews, lectures, and debates with major industry figures. With over 250 events a year, BAFTA's stated aim is to inspire and inform the next generation of talent by providing a platform for some of the world's most talented practitioners to pass on their knowledge and experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bafta.org/about/learning,2836,BA.html |title=BAFTA's Commitment to Learning – About – The BAFTA site |publisher=Bafta.org |date= |accessdate=16 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scholarships===
BAFTA runs a number of scholarship programmes across the UK, US and Asia.

Launched in 2012, the UK programme enables talented British citizens who are in need of financial support to take an industry-recognised course in film, television or games in the UK. Each BAFTA Scholar receives up to £12,000 towards their annual course fees, and mentoring support from a BAFTA member and free access to BAFTA events around the UK. Since 2013, three students every year have received one of the Prince William Scholarships in Film, Television and Games, supported by BAFTA and Warner Bros. These scholarships are awarded in the name of [Prince William, Duke of Cambridge] in his role as President of BAFTA.

In the US, BAFTA Los Angeles offers financial support and mentorship to British graduate students studying in the US, as well as scholarships to provide financial aid to local LA students from the inner city. BAFTA New York's Media Studies Scholarship Program, set up in 2012, supports students pursuing media studies at undergraduate and graduate level institutions within the New York City area and includes financial aid and mentoring opportunities.

Since 2015, BAFTA has been offering scholarships for British citizens to study in China, vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bafta.org/media-centre/press-releases/bafta-awards-scholarships-to-students-in-the-uk-and-us|title=BAFTA Awards Scholarships To Students In The UK And US|website=www.bafta.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===BAFTA awards===
[[File:BAFTA award.jpg|thumb|The BAFTA award, designed by Mitzi Cunliffe|upright=0.85]]
The BAFTA award trophy is a mask, designed by American sculptor [[Mitzi Cunliffe]].  When the Guild merged with the British Film Academy to become the Society of Film and Television Arts, later the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, the first 'BAFTA award' was presented to Sir [[Charles Chaplin]] on his Academy Fellowship that year.

Today's BAFTA award – including the bronze mask and marble base – weighs 3.7&amp;nbsp;kg and measures 27&amp;nbsp;cm (h) x 14&amp;nbsp;cm (w) x 8&amp;nbsp;cm (d); the mask itself measures 16&amp;nbsp;cm(h) x 14&amp;nbsp;cm (w).

In 2017, the British Academy of Film and Television Arts introduced new entry rules for British Films Only starting from 2018 season. &lt;ref BAFTA New Entry Rules Forcing Diversity in British Film Making&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ikonlondonmagazine.com/bafta-new-entry-rules-forcing-diversity-in-british-film-making/|title=BAFTA New Entry Rules Forcing Diversity in British Film Making|publisher=Ikon London Magazine| last1 = Orlova-Alvarez | first1 = Tamara| last2 = Alvarez | first2 = Joe| date=14 July 2017|accessdate=6 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Awards ceremonies===
====Film Awards====&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Blade Runner]] --&gt;
{{main|British Academy Film Awards}}
BAFTA's annual film awards ceremony is known as the British Academy Film Awards,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bafta.org/film/awards |title=BAFTA Film Awards |publisher=Bafta.org |date= |accessdate=2016-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "the BAFTAs", and reward the best work of any nationality seen on British cinema screens during the preceding year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bafta.org/film/awards |title=EE British Academy Film Awards |publisher=BAFTA |date=11 February 2014 |accessdate=16 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949 the British Film Academy, as it was then known, presented the first awards for films made in 1947 and 1948. Since 2008 the ceremony has been held at the [[Royal Opera House]] in London's [[Covent Garden]]. It had been held in the [[Odeon Leicester Square|Odeon cinema]] on Leicester Square since 2000. 
Since 2017, the BAFTA ceremony has been held at the Royal Albert Hall. &lt;ref Royal BAFTAs 2017&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ikonlondonmagazine.com/royal-baftas-2017/|title=Royal BAFTAs|publisher=Ikon London Magazine| last1 = Orlova-Alvarez | first1 = Tamara| last2 = Alvarez | first2 = Joe| date=13 February 2017|accessdate=23 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref Royal BAFTAs 2018&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ikonlondonmagazine.com/baftas-2018/|title=Jennifer Lawrence EE British Academy Film and Television Awards | publisher=Ikon London Magazine | last1 = Orlova-Alvarez | first1 = Tamara| last2 = Alvarez | first2 = Joe | date=13 February 2018 | accessdate=23 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ceremony had been performed during April or May of each year, but since 2002 it has been held in February to precede the academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences' (AMPAS) [[Academy Awards]], or Oscars.

In order for a film to be considered for a BAFTA nomination its first public exhibition must be displayed in a cinema and it must have a UK theatrical release for no fewer than seven days of the calendar year that corresponds to the upcoming awards. A movie must be of feature length and movies from all countries are eligible in all categories, with the exception of the [[BAFTA Award for Best British Film|Alexander Korda Award for Outstanding British Film]] and [[Outstanding Debut by a British Writer, Director or Producer|Outstanding Debut]] which are for British films or individuals only.

====Television Awards and Television Craft Awards====
{{main|British Academy Television Awards|British Academy Television Craft Awards}}

The British Academy Television Awards ceremony usually takes place during April or May, with its sister ceremony, the British Academy Television Craft Awards, usually occurring within a few weeks of it.

The Television Awards, celebrating the best TV programmes and performances of the past year, are also often referred to simply as "the BAFTAs" or, to differentiate them from the movie awards, the "BAFTA Television Awards". They have been awarded annually since 1954. The first ever ceremony consisted of six categories. Until 1958, they were awarded by the [[Guild of Television Producers and Directors]].

From 1968 until 1997, BAFTA's Film and Television Awards were presented together, but from 1998 onwards they were presented at two separate ceremonies.

The Television Craft Awards celebrate the talent behind the programmes, such as individuals working in visual effects, production, and costume design.

Only British programmes are eligible – with the potential exception of the publicly voted Audience Award – but any [[cable television|cable]], [[satellite television|satellite]], [[analogue television|terrestrial]] or [[digital television]] stations broadcasting in the UK are eligible to submit entries, as are independent production companies who have produced programming for the channels. Individual performances can either be entered by the performers themselves or by the broadcasters. The programmes being entered must have been broadcast on or between 1 January and 31 December of the year preceding the awards ceremony.

From 2014 the "BAFTA Television Awards" will be open to TV programmes which are only broadcast online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Lizo Mzimba |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24345126 |title=BBC News – Bafta opens TV awards up to online shows |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=1 October 2013 |accessdate=16 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Games Awards====
{{main|British Academy Games Awards}}
The British Academy Games Awards ceremony traditionally takes place in March, shortly after the Film Awards ceremony in February.

BAFTA first recognised video games and other interactive media at its inaugural ''[[BAFTA Interactive Entertainment Awards]]'' ceremony during 1998, the first major change of its rules since the admittance of television thirty years earlier. Among the first winning games were ''[[GoldenEye 007 (1997 video game)|GoldenEye 007]]'', ''[[Gran Turismo (video game)|Gran Turismo]]'' and interactive comedy ''[[MindGym]]'', sharing the spotlight with the ''[[BBC News Online]]'' website which won the news category four years consecutively. These awards allowed the academy to recognise new forms of entertainment that were engaging new audiences and challenging traditional expressions of creativity.

During 2003, the sheer ubiquity of interactive forms of entertainment and the breadth of genres and types of video games outgrew the combined ceremony, and the event was divided into the ''[[British Academy Video Games Awards|BAFTA Video Games Awards]]'' and the BAFTA Interactive Awards&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/3253818.stm |title=Technology &amp;#124; Multimedia's best in Bafta battle |publisher=BBC News |date=1 December 2003 |accessdate=16 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite making headlines with high-profile winners like ''[[Halo 2]]'' and ''[[Half-Life 2]]'' the interactive division was discontinued and disappeared from BAFTA's publicity material after only two ceremonies.

During 2006, BAFTA announced its decision "to give video games equal status with film and television", and the academy now advertises video games as its third major topic in recognition of its importance as an art form of moving images. The same year the ceremony was performed at [[The Roundhouse]] by Chalk Farm Road in [[North London]] on 5 October and was televised for the first time on 17 October and was broadcast on the digital channel [[E4 (channel)|E4]].

Since 2009, the ceremonies have been performed at the London Hilton Park Lane and Tobacco Dock, London, and have been hosted by [[Dara Ó Briain]] and [[Rufus Hound]].

====Children's Awards====
{{main|British Academy Children's Awards}}
The British Academy Children's Awards are presented annually during November to reward excellence in the art forms of the moving image intended for children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bafta.org/awards/childrens |title=British Academy Children's Awards |publisher=Bafta.org |date=24 November 2013 |accessdate=16 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have been awarded annually since 1969.

The academy has a long history of recognising and rewarding children's programming, presenting two awards at the 1969 ceremony – The Flame of Knowledge Award for Schools Programmes and the Harlequin Award for Children's Programmes.

{{as of|2010}} the Awards ceremony includes 19 categories across movies, television, video games and online content.

Since 2007 the Children's Awards have included a Kids Vote award, voted by children between seven and 14. BAFTA Kids Vote is the annual competition for children aged between seven and 12 which is now part of BAFTA's year-round BAFTA Kids programme of activity helping children "discover, explore and find out more about the worlds of films, television and games by providing content, information and experiences". The [[CBBC]] Me and My Movie award, a children's filmmaking initiative to inspire and enable children to make their own movies and tell their own stories, has been discontinued.

Awards given include 'The Stanley Kubrick Britannia Award for Excellence in Film' (the original award was renamed during 2000 to honour director [[Stanley Kubrick]]), presented to an individual "upon whose work is stamped the indelible mark of authorship and commitment, and who has lifted the craft to new heights"; 'The John Schlesinger Britannia Award for Artistic Excellence in Directing' (added during 2003 in honour of [[John Schlesinger]]); the 'Britannia Award for British Artist of the Year'; and the 'Albert R.

'''CM&amp;''' (Compañía de Medios de Información) is a Colombian ''[[programadora]]'' established in 1992. It was one of the few ''programadoras'' that survived the crisis of the late 1990s and early 2000s, doing so by creating a two-hour news block in prime time (''horario estelar''). Its main program is '''Noticias CM&amp;''', created by [[Yamid Amat]] and [[Juan Gossaín]] and aired on [[RTVC]]'s [[Canal Uno]]. The acronym with the ampersand was adopted in 1993.

Between 1897 and 1902, he studied [[philosophy]], [[psychology]], and [[jurisprudence]] intermittently at the Universities of [[Ludwig Maximilians University of Munich|Munich]], [[Georg-August University of Göttingen|Göttingen]], and [[University of Leipzig|Leipzig]], but never graduated.  In 1900, he began working as a [[freelancer|freelance]] writer in [[Weimar]], where he met and married his first wife Eugenie Hauth the same year.  Their union ended in 1906 and he married the writer [[Thea Sternheim|Thea Löwenstein]] (née Bauer) in 1907, with whom he had two children.  Their daughter Dorothea ("Mopsa") was a resistance fighter during the Second World War and was detained by the Nazi's in [[Ravensbrück concentration camp]].

[[File:Grave Carl Sternheim and Marcel Hastir - Ixelles Bruxelles.jpg|thumb|Grave of Carl Sternheim and [[Marcel Hastir]] in [[Ixelles]]]]The wealth brought by Thea from her rich manufacturing family enabled the couple to build the Schloss Bellemaison in [[Munich]].  Here, Sternheim worked in the company of fellow artists such as [[Mechtilde Lichnowsky]], [[Max Reinhardt (theatre director)|Max Reinhardt]], and [[Frank Wedekind]], and assembled his own art collection.  In 1908, he collaborated with [[Franz Blei]] to launch the Expressionist literary journal ''[[Hyperion (journal)|Hyperion]]'', which published the first eight prose works by [[Franz Kafka]].  He also contributed occasionally to the Expressionist journal ''[[Die Aktion]]''.  In 1912, he relocated with his family to [[Belgium]] and in 1918, they fled the fighting of [[World War I]] and temporarily moved to [[St. Moritz]] and [[Uttwil]] in [[Switzerland]].  Sternheim and Thea divorced in 1927.  His next marriage, to actress and singer [[Pamela Wedekind]], took place in 1930 and lasted until 1934, after which he lived with Henriette Carbonara.  Sternheim died in [[Ixelles]] ([[Brussels]])&lt;ref&gt;Archives of the Ixelles Cemetery, Yearbook 1942, last address: Rue Emmanuel Van Driessche 52, Ixelles&lt;/ref&gt; during [[World War II]] and was buried in the [[Ixelles Cemetery]]. A friend of his, [[Marcel Hastir]] (1906–2011), was buried in the same tomb.

Sternheim's circle of prominent friends included [[Gottfried Benn]], [[Carl Einstein]], [[Franz Pfemfert]], [[Walther Rathenau]], [[Ernst Stadler]], [[Hugo von Tschudi]], [[Fritz von Unruh]], and [[Otto Vrieslander]].  In 1915, he presented the prize money for the [[Fontane Prize]] to the then largely unknown Kafka.  The [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] authorities banned Sternheim's work not only because of his partial Jewish descent but also because of his savage [[comedy|comedic]] assaults on the perceived moral corruption of the German bourgeoisie.

==Adaptations==
Sternheim's works remain popular in [[Germany]], but English language productions of them are rare. This is in part due to the large number of English comedies already in existence, bypassing the need for translations of German comedies. Academics have also argued that Sternheim's works are sometimes hard to sell to the market in foreign languages due to the difficulty in categorising his style as belonging to any one specific movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aQqOKWmjdQUC&amp;lpg=PA1280&amp;ots=dzZn_Cw7Gv&amp;dq=%22carl+sternheim%22+fossil&amp;pg=PA1280#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Columbia Encyclopedia of Modern Drama|first1=Gabrielle H.|last1=Cody|first2=Evert|last2=Sprinchorn|date=9 September 2018|publisher=Columbia University Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, Sternheim's plays have rarely been produced in a major venue. One notable exception occurred when [[Simon Callow]] made his West End debut in a version of ''[[Bürger Schippel]]'' (re-titled as ''The Plumber's Progress'') alongside [[Harry Secombe]] in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whatsonstage.com/interviews/theatre/london/E8821126280713/20+Questions+With%85Simon+Callow.html |title=''20 Questions with Simon Callow|publisher= What's On Stage|date= 12 September 2005 |accessdate=2011-07-15 |df= }}{{dead link|date=January 2017|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in August 2011, both ''[[Bürger Schippel|Paul Schippel Esq.]]'' (an alternative title often given to ''[[Bürger Schippel]]'') and ''[[The Fossil (Play)|The Fossil]]'', another of Sternheim's comedies, were performed as a double-bill at the [[Charing Cross Theatre]], London, with Kieran E.

In terrestrial [[radio]] and [[television broadcasting]], '''centralcasting''' refers to the use of systems [[automation]] by which customised signals for broadcast by multiple individual stations may be created at one central facility.

== Definition ==
Centralcasting is a form of [[broadcast automation]] which operates on the presumption that large quantities of content are similar and are handled in a consistent or repetitive manner across multiple stations in a broadcast station group. While each individual station has its own [[digital on-screen graphic]] logo, [[call sign]] and identity, much of the content on a typical [[affiliate station]] consists of a common [[television network]] or [[syndicated programming]] with a small number of local [[broadcast programming]] time blocks employed for [[television news]] and [[sports television]] coverage, [[public affairs (broadcasting)|public affairs]] programming or local [[television commercials]].

Traditionally, many operations at an individual broadcast station were handled manually by [[broadcast engineering]] technicians at the local station. Network feeds would arrive by [[satellite television|satellite]]; these would contain time cues to indicate when the station could switch to a prerecorded local station break from a [[videotape recorder]], a local station ID from a [[character generator]] or a local program such as a [[newscast]]. Syndicated programming would arrive separately, either recorded in advance from satellite for [[broadcast delay|tape delay]] or transported on prerecorded media. Local [[advertisements]] would be stored on tape cartridges ("carts") which would need to be inserted in the correct timeslots manually. A station could not operate unattended, even if it were merely retransmitting a network [[television program]]me originated elsewhere.

Broadcast automation relies on [[computer]]s to store and retrieve [[video]], largely eliminating the use of individual videotapes and allowing switching and retrieval of stored programming, advertising and titles to take place automatically.  The server would operate from stored [[playlist]]s, in which each programme, each commercial advertisement, each live or network feed and each station break had been configured in advance.

=== Central control ===
In some cases, broadcasters have operated groups of multiple stations at the regional or national level from one central facility, removing many tasks which were formerly done locally. These operations normally take one of two forms:

# A fully centralised operation may have local stations which function as little more than a local news bureau and a [[transmitter]] site. The local station sends its news footage to the central hub, which inserts it (along with local advertising and station identifiers) into a national network or syndicated programming feed. All video is stored in one central location. The resulting broadcast video streams are centrally assembled then sent directly to local station transmitters by the central hub.
# A less-centralised approach involves installing servers at local broadcast station sites which may be controlled either locally or remotely. The central hub would be able to send video to the local station, along with playlist information, and local facilities would then be used to store and rebroadcast programming.

=== Non-broadcast operations ===
Many traffic and operations tasks, such as acquiring programming, selling advertisements, scheduling and keeping records of what was broadcast and billing advertisers take place behind the scenes, yet are also suited to automation and central operation by regional broadcast station groups. If computers handle scheduling of individual broadcasts, advertisements and local identification, a computerised record of what has been broadcast can easily be extracted for use at a central location to bill advertisers for broadcast time. Central operation of non-broadcast business functions removes the need for these tasks to be carried out at each of the multiple local stations.

== Advantages ==
For some broadcasters, centralisation of broadcasting operations has reduced the number of people required to operate a station, with some saving in cost. This must be carefully balanced, however, against the cost of the extra communications links required from the local station to the hub; these often are [[optical fibre]], [[microwave]] or (occasionally) satellite and can be costly if large amounts of [[digital video]] must be carried great distances.

By shifting many of the control tasks to a central hub, centralcasting may also reduce the investment which must be made in equipment for each individual local station in the group for upgrades such as [[digital television]] broadcasting as less equipment is required at each local station site.&lt;ref&gt;[http://broadcastengineering.com/iptv/ip-based-centralcasting-0601/ IP-based centralcasting, Mark Warner, Broadcast Engineering, Jun 1, 2008] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090130105006/http://broadcastengineering.com/iptv/ip-based-centralcasting-0601/ |date=January 30, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Centralcasting can also be used as a way to control a station's local operations remotely during off-hours (such as late night, where there may be no one or just a skeleton crew at the local site). This can allow a station to operate on an "auto-pilot" basis during off-hours in which it otherwise may have needed to [[sign-off]].

== Drawbacks ==
An over-reliance on automation (and a reduction in the number of people at the local station) may leave an individual station less able to respond to local breaking news, such as [[tornado]]es or other [[natural disaster]]s which require local, live and immediate coverage. Individual local stations must also retain enough equipment to handle [[Emergency Alert System]] messages, routing them automatically to any remote locations being used to encode the final broadcast signals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.broadcastequipmentguide.com/barix_04_13_07.php Barix IP Audio Devices Gaining Popularity in EAS Applications, Broadcast Equipment Guide, April 13, 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130119051719/http://www.broadcastequipmentguide.com/barix_04_13_07.php |date=January 19, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of large amounts of centrally assembled programming may also reduce local diversity, turning a station into little more than a [[semi-satellite]] of a main broadcaster in another city. In some cases, individual stations in a group will legally need to maintain nominal main studios in or near their respective [[city of license|communities of license]] but will originate little or nothing from these facilities once most broadcast-related tasks become centralised.&lt;ref&gt;[http://entrepreneur.com/tradejournals/article/75278570_1.html The FCC's main studio rule: achieving little for localism at a great cost to broadcasters, Silverman, David M. - Tobenkin, David N., Federal Communications Law Journal • May 2001] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813152145/http://entrepreneur.com/tradejournals/article/75278570_1.html |date=August 13, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Broadcast centralisation can create problems when one station in the group is sold (as the local master control functions which had been centralised must be restored before the local station is a viable stand-alone entity). There also needs to be some means to remain on-air locally if the link to the central hub is lost, lest a [[single point of failure]] take down all stations in the regional group.

America's First was [[Alabama Public Television]] in 1955.

== Controversy ==

The reduction in local broadcast-related jobs as tasks are moved to central locations has also drawn objections from [[trade union]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.friends.ca/news-item/2052 Union appeals CRTC ruling to Federal Court of Appeal, April 2008, Canada NewsWire]&lt;/ref&gt;

Competition routines are held on a 12-meter square mat in which the entire surface can be used. Each team must perform a 2 minutes and 30 seconds routine in which 1 minute and 30 seconds of the routine may contain music. Routines showcase different elements including sideline cheers, pyramids and stunts, dance, and gymnastics. There is also a division for group stunt competition where a group of five participants perform a 60–65 seconds routine of strictly stunts. There is also a division for partner stunt competition that includes one male and one female and one spotter. These routines last around 55–60 seconds and can only incorporate stunting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Competition Rules|url=http://www.fjca.jp/cheerleading/contents_03.php|website=Foundation of Japan Cheerleading Association|accessdate=30 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{About|the 2014 brawler video game|the roguelike video game often simply known as Crawl|Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup}}

'''''Crawl''''' is a [[brawler]] [[indie game]] by Australian developer Powerhoof. Up to four players and [[Artificial intelligence (video games)|bots]] in [[local multiplayer]] advance through [[randomly generated]] dungeons with one player as the hero and the others as spirits who possess traps and monsters in the environment to kill and thus replace the hero. The game received a [[Steam Early Access]] release for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[OS X]], and [[Linux]] platforms in August 2014, and a full release for those three as well as [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]] in April 2017 and a release for [[Nintendo Switch]] on December 19, 2017.

== Gameplay ==
[[File:Crawl screenshot 5.png|thumb|left|A screenshot of the gameplay, depicting the art style and combat]]
''Crawl'' is a cross-genre game with [[roguelike]], [[bullet hell]], and [[brawler]] elements&lt;ref name="USgamer: introduces"/&gt; for up to four offline players and [[Artificial intelligence (video games)|bots]].&lt;ref name="Destructoid: Early Access"/&gt; The main player advances through [[randomly generated]] dungeons as a human hero while up to three other spirit players control the dungeon's enemies and traps to kill the main player.&lt;ref name="Eurogamer: bloody brilliant"/&gt; The spirit player who kills the human hero swaps roles to become the next main player. Players earn [[Experience point|experience]] as they progress through the dungeon in both the human hero and the non-human spirit roles. Hero experience unlocks new attacks and spells, and spirit experience unlocks stronger enemies to possess.&lt;ref name="Eurogamer: Early Access"/&gt; Each player's human hero experience level, weapon, and stats progress is preserved between turns.&lt;ref name="Eurogamer: bloody brilliant"/&gt; ''Crawl'' was designed to be more fast-paced and arcade-like than strategic, and includes genre-standard activities like collecting loot and upgradable weapons and magic items.&lt;ref name="USgamer: introduces"/&gt; Once player spirits possess "monster spawners" and traps in the active room, they cannot leave the form until they die or kill the main character. The players and enemies grow progressively more powerful over the course of a match.&lt;ref name="Eurogamer: bloody brilliant"/&gt; The game ends when a human hero reaches experience level 10, enters a portal, and defeats a final [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]] whose limbs are controlled cooperatively by the other players.&lt;ref name="Eurogamer: Early Access"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HG: kill them"/&gt; Typical matches last about 30 minutes.&lt;ref name="Eurogamer: bloody brilliant"/&gt;

== Development ==
[[File:Powerhoof - Barney and Dave at airport.png|thumb|left|Powerhoof's Barney and Dave]]
''Crawl'' was developed by Powerhoof, a two-person indie studio based in [[Melbourne]].&lt;ref name="Eurogamer: bloody brilliant"/&gt; They described the game as their version of four-player ''[[Gauntlet (1985 video game)|Gauntlet]]'' combined with the Japanese bullet hell genre, or a combination of ''[[Super Bomberman]]'' and ''[[The Legend of Zelda]]''.&lt;ref name="RPS: dungeon"/&gt; The game was made on the [[Unity (game engine)|Unity game engine]],&lt;ref name="USgamer: introduces"/&gt; and the developers designed a pixelated version of [[Gabe Newell]] as an in-game boss.&lt;ref name="USgamer: introduces"/&gt;

The game was "greenlit" on [[Steam (software)|Steam]] within twenty-four hours.&lt;ref name="Eurogamer: bloody brilliant"/&gt; There is no online multiplayer. The game was expected for release on Steam Early Access in July 2014, but was delayed due to an issue pertaining to Powerhoof's taxes and formation as a company.&lt;ref name="PC Gamer: apologetic"/&gt; The game was released on Steam Early Access on August 6, 2014 for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[OS X]], and [[Linux]] platforms.&lt;ref name="Destructoid: Early Access"/&gt; The full version released for computers, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on April 11, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pcgamer.com/crawl-release-date-set-bash-giant-gabe-newell-next-month/ |title=Crawl release date set, bash giant Gabe Newell next month |last=Donnelly |first=John |date=March 16, 2017 |website=[[PC Gamer]] |accessdate=March 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Wii U]] console version was planned in 2014.&lt;ref name="Eurogamer: bloody brilliant"/&gt;

--&gt;
Critics placed ''Crawl'' in a trend of local multiplayer functionality amongst indie games.&lt;ref name="USgamer: introduces"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HG: kill them"/&gt; Pete Davison of ''[[USgamer]]'' wrote that the game bridged multiple genres and was an example of the resurgence of [[couch co-op]]'s fashionability.&lt;ref name="USgamer: introduces"/&gt; ''Rock, Paper, Shotgun''{{'s}} Nathan Grayson compared the game's premise with ''[[Dungeonland (video game)|Dungeonland]]''.&lt;ref name="RPS: dungeon"/&gt; ''Hardcore Gamer''{{'s}} Marcus Estrada called the game's concept "ingenious" and praised its capacity as a [[party game]].&lt;ref name="HG: kill them"/&gt; In reviewing a prerelease version, Estrada wrote that the game had issues with gameplay pacing, lackluster artificial intelligence, and opportunities for players to hold up the game.&lt;ref name="HG: kill them"/&gt;

The game sold over 10,000 copies in its first 12 days on sale on early access.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.powerhoof.com/crawl-launch-impressions/|title=Crawl Launch Impressions|last=Cumming|first=Barney|date=August 19, 2014|publisher=Powerhoof|accessdate=August 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear}}

'''''Cyborg Justice''''' is a [[side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] [[beat 'em up]] [[video game]] developed by [[Appaloosa Interactive|Novotrade]] and released in [[1993 in video gaming|1993]] for the [[Sega Mega Drive]].

==Story==
{{expand section|date=November 2012}}
The game's opening cinematic shows a spaceship crashing onto a mining colony. The ship's occupant dies shortly after the crash. The space-traveler's brain is saved and it is transplanted into cyborg body. His memory is erased so that he can be put to work. The memory wipe fails and the player, as the unwilling cyborg, must escape.

==Gameplay==
When starting the game, players are prompted to select an arm, body, and legs for their cyborg character. Enemies are also a combination of these three types of cyborg parts, even having the secondary arm mixed. When players choose the "two players game mode," players will be prompted to the customization room, and afterwards either go to the main adventure mode or the duel mode if they previously set it in the Options menu. The first player has a combination of metallic gray and yellow, while the second player has a combination of metallic green and purple.

Enemies come in pairs, with first and second player colors respectively. Players have a wide variety of moves, which includes picking up and using objects and manipulating enemies, grabbing the enemy's arm and removing it,and swap it for the current arm, and if the enemy doesn't have a primary arm, then the next thing the player can grab is the body and tear the enemy in half, which can then be drained to replenish energy.

As the levels progress, the player is confronted with cyborg enemies sporting different modified bodies. If desired, the player can swap out parts from defeated enemies by kicking the wreckage and grasping downward at the displayed item. This is sometimes needed, such as in the first level where the player is faced with an enemy with high-jump legs and then has to jump across a wide chasm. Later on, battles with enemies become increasingly difficult. The more powerful weapons from defeated enemies prove essential in defeating the next wave of foes or end-level bosses.

'''''Die Another Day''''' is a 2002 British-American [[spy film]], the twentieth film in the [[James Bond in film|''James Bond'' series]] produced by [[Eon Productions]], as well as the fourth and final film to star [[Pierce Brosnan]] as the fictional [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] agent [[James Bond filmography|James Bond]]. The film follows Bond as he leads a mission to [[North Korea]], during which he is betrayed and, after seemingly killing a rogue North Korean [[Sangjwa|colonel]], is captured and imprisoned. Fourteen months later, Bond is released as part of a [[prisoner exchange]]. Surmising that the mole is within the British government, he attempts to earn redemption by tracking down his betrayer and all those involved.

The film, produced by [[Michael G. Wilson]] and [[Barbara Broccoli]], and directed by [[Lee Tamahori]], marked the ''James Bond'' franchise's 40th anniversary. The series began in 1962 with [[Sean Connery]] starring as Bond in ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]''. ''Die Another Day'' includes references to each of the preceding films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=20 things you never knew about... James Bond|url=http://www.virginmedia.com/movies/features/20-things-you-never-knew-about-james-bond.php?page=18|work=Virgin Media|accessdate=8 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131211144455/http://www.virginmedia.com/movies/features/20-things-you-never-knew-about-james-bond.php?page=18|archive-date=11 December 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film received mixed reviews. Some critics praised the work of Tamahori, while others criticised the film's heavy use of [[computer-generated imagery]], which they found unconvincing and a distraction from the film's plot. Nevertheless, ''Die Another Day'' was the highest-grossing ''James Bond'' film up to that time if inflation is not taken into account.

==Plot==
[[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] agent James Bond infiltrates a [[North Korea]]n military base, where Colonel Tan-Sun Moon is illegally trading weapons for African [[blood diamond|conflict diamond]]s. After Moon's assistant Zao discovers that Bond is a British agent via an unknown source, Moon attempts to kill Bond and a [[hovercraft]] chase ensues, ending with Moon's apparent death. Bond survives, but is captured by North Korean soldiers and imprisoned by the Colonel's father, General Moon.

After fourteen months of captivity and [[torture]], Bond is traded for Zao in a [[prisoner exchange]]. He is sedated and taken to meet [[M (James Bond)|M]], who informs him that his status as a [[00 Agent]] is suspended under suspicion of having leaked information under duress.  Bond is convinced that he has been set up by a [[double agent]] in the British government and decides to avenge his betrayal.  After escaping from the custody of MI6, he discovers that he is in [[Hong Kong]], where he learns from a Chinese agent that Zao is in [[Cuba]].

In [[Havana]], Bond meets [[National Security Agency|NSA]] agent Giacinta 'Jinx' Johnson, with whom he is intimate. Later, Bond follows her to a [[gene therapy]] clinic, where patients can have their appearances altered through DNA restructuring. Bond locates Zao inside the clinic and attempts to kill him, but he escapes, leaving behind a pendant which leads Bond to a cache of diamonds, identified as conflict diamonds, but bearing the crest of the company owned by British billionaire businessman Gustav Graves. Bond learns that Graves only appeared a year prior, apparently discovering a vein of diamonds in Iceland leading to his current wealth, celebrity, and philanthropy from its assets.

At [[Blades Club]] in [[London]] Bond meets Graves, along with his assistant [[List of James Bond henchmen in Die Another Day#Miranda Frost|Miranda Frost]], who is also an undercover MI6 agent. After a [[fencing]] exercise (and a literal sword-fight), Bond is invited by Graves to [[Iceland]] for a scientific demonstration. Shortly afterwards, M tells Bond of MI6's doubts about Graves, restores Bond's Double-0 status and offers assistance in the investigation.

At his [[ice palace]] adjacent to the diamond mine site in Iceland, Graves unveils a new orbital mirror satellite, "Icarus", which is able to focus [[solar energy]] on a small area and provide year-round sunshine for crop development.  During the night, Jinx infiltrates Graves' command centre, but is captured by Graves and Zao.  Bond rescues her and later discovers that Colonel Moon is still alive.  Moon has used the gene therapy technology to change his appearance, creating the identity of Gustav Graves and amassing his fortune from sale of the conflict diamonds.

[[File:Die Another Day - Aston Martin V12 Vanquish &amp; Bombardier MX Rev Ski-Doo.jpg|thumb|Aston Martin V12 Vanquish and Bombardier MX Rev Ski-Doo used in the film]]
Bond confronts Graves, but Frost arrives to reveal herself as the traitor who betrayed Bond in North Korea, forcing Bond to escape from Graves' facility. Bond then returns in his [[Aston Martin Vanquish]] to rescue Jinx, who has been captured once again within the palace. As Graves uses Icarus to melt the ice palace, Zao pursues Bond into the palace using his [[Jaguar XKR]]. Bond kills Zao by causing a giant ice chandelier to fall onto him, and then revives Jinx after she has almost drowned.

Bond and Jinx pursue Graves and Frost to the [[Korean peninsula]] and stow away on Graves' cargo plane. Graves reveals his true identity to his father, and the true purpose of the Icarus satellite: to cut a path through the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone]] with concentrated sunlight, allowing North Korean troops to invade [[South Korea]] and reunite the peninsula by force. Horrified at the fact that it would result in a [[nuclear warfare|nuclear war]] with the United States, General Moon tries to turn the plan down, but he is murdered by his own son.

Bond attempts to shoot Graves, but he is prevented by one of the soldiers on board.  In their struggle, a gunshot pierces the [[fuselage]], causing the plane to descend rapidly.  Bond engages Graves in a fist fight, and Jinx attempts to regain control of the plane.  Frost attacks Jinx, forcing her to defend herself in a sword duel. After the plane passes through the Icarus beam and is further damaged, Jinx kills Frost. Graves attempts to escape by parachute, but Bond opens the parachute, causing Graves to be pulled out of the plane and into one of its engines, killing him and disabling the Icarus beam. Bond and Jinx then escape from the disintegrating plane in a helicopter from the cargo hold, carrying away Graves' stash of diamonds in the process. In the end, they are seen to have sex amidst the diamonds on a bed in a South Korean Buddhist temple located in a valley.

===Filming===
[[File:Die Another Dayintro.jpg|thumb|right|Surfers (L &amp; R)]]

[[Principal photography]] of ''Die Another Day'' began on 11 January 2002 at Pinewood studios.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2002/01/12/nbond12.xml |title=Brosnan meets the two-faced Bond villain |work=The Daily Telegraph |accessdate=17 July 2009| location=London | first=Hugh | last=Davies | date=12 January 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was shot primarily in the United Kingdom, [[Iceland]], and [[Cádiz|Cádiz, Spain]]. Other locations included Pinewood Studios' [[Albert R. Broccoli's 007 Stage|007 Stage]] and [[Maui]], Hawaii, in December 2001.
[[Laird Hamilton]], [[Dave Kalama]], and [[Darrick Doerner]] performed the pre-title surfing scene at the surf break known as Jaws in [[Peahi, Hawaii|Pe{{okina}}ahi, Maui]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Maui's monster surf break getting bigger by the day |author= Timothy Hurley |newspaper= [[Honolulu Advertiser]] |date=18 November 2002 |url= http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2002/Nov/18/ln/ln04a.html |accessdate=29 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while the shore shots were taken near Cádiz and [[Newquay|Newquay, Cornwall]]. Scenes inside Graves' diamond mine were also filmed in [[Cornwall]], at the [[Eden Project]]. The scenes involving the Cuban locations of Havana and the fictional Isla de Los Organos were filmed at [[La Caleta, Spain]].&lt;ref name="locales"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.movie-locations.com/movies/d/dieanother.html |title=Die Another Day filming locations |accessdate=20 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scenes featuring Berry in a bikini were shot in Cádiz. The location was reportedly cold and windy, and footage has been released of Berry wrapped in thick towels between takes to avoid catching a chill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|title=Die Another Day |medium=DVD |year=2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Berry was injured during filming when debris from a smoke grenade flew into her eye. The debris was removed in a 30-minute operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/spain/1390372/Halle-Berry-hurt-in-blast-during-Bond-film-scene.html |title=Halle Berry hurt in blast during Bond film scene |author=Hugh Davies |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=10 April 2002 |accessdate=8 March 2012| location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gadgets and other props from every previous ''Bond'' film and stored in Eon Productions' archives appear in Q's warehouse in the [[London Underground]]. Examples include the jetpack in ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]'' and [[Rosa Klebb]]'s poison-tipped shoe in ''[[From Russia with Love (film)|From Russia with Love]]''.&lt;ref name="dvdcommentary1"&gt;{{cite video|title=Die Another Day [[Audio commentary]] 1|people=[[Lee Tamahori]], [[Michael G. Wilson]]|location=''Die Another Day''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Q mentions that the watch he issues Bond is "your 20th, I believe", a reference to ''Die Another Day'' being the 20th Eon-produced Bond film.&lt;ref name="dvdcommentary2"&gt;{{cite video|title=Die Another Day [[Audio commentary]] 2|people=[[Pierce Brosnan]], [[Rosamund Pike]]|location=''Die Another Day''}}&lt;/ref&gt; In London, the [[Reform Club]] was used to shoot several places in the film, including the lobby and gallery at the Blades Club, MI6 Headquarters, Buckingham Palace, Green Park, and Westminster. [[Svalbard|Svalbard, Norway]], and [[Jökulsárlón|Jökulsárlón, Iceland]] were used for the car chase on the ice with additional scenes filmed at [[Jostedalsbreen National Park|Jostedalsbreen National Park, Norway]] and [[RAF Little Rissington|RAF Little Rissington, Gloucestershire]];&lt;ref name="locales"/&gt; [[Manston Airport]] in [[Kent]] was used for the scenes involving the Antonov cargo plane scenes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kent Film Office|url=http://kentfilmoffice.co.uk/2002/02/die-another-day-2002/|title=Kent Film Office Die Another Day Film Focus}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scene in which Bond surfs the wave created by Icarus when Graves was attempting to kill Bond was shot on the [[chroma key|blue screen]]. The waves, along with all the glaciers in the scene are computer-generated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.surfertoday.com/surfing/7928-the-famous-james-bond-surfing-scenes-in-007-die-another-day|title=The famous James Bond surfing scenes in "007 - Die Another Day"|work=surfertoday.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jökulsárlón April 07-3.JPG|thumb|left|[[Jökulsárlón|Jökulsárlón, Iceland]]]]

The hangar interior of the "US Air Base in South Korea", shown crowded with [[CH-47 Chinook|Chinook]] helicopters, was filmed at [[RAF Odiham]] in Hampshire, UK, as were the helicopter interior shots during the Switchblade sequence. These latter scenes, though portrayed in the air, were actually filmed entirely on the ground with the sky background being added in post-production using blue screen techniques. Although the base is portrayed in the film as a US base, all the aircraft and personnel in the scene are British in real life. In the film, Switchblades (one-person gliders resembling fighter jets in shape) are flown by Bond and Jinx to stealthily enter North Korea. The Switchblade was based on a workable model called "PHASST" (Programmable High Altitude Single Soldier Transport). Kinetic Aerospace Inc.'s lead designer, Jack McCornack was impressed by director Lee Tamahori's way of conducting the Switchblade scene and commented, "It's brief, but realistic. The good guys get in unobserved, thanks to a fast cruise, good glide performance, and minimal radar signature. It's a wonderful promotion for the PHASST."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Bond Flies PHASST |publisher=Kinetic Aerospace |url=http://www.kineticaerospace.com/ |accessdate=18 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;


===Music===
{{Main|Die Another Day (soundtrack)}}
The soundtrack was composed by [[David Arnold]] and released on [[Warner Bros. Records]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.soundtrack.net/albums/database/?id=3150 |title=Die Another Day at Soundtracknet |accessdate=20 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He again made use of electronic rhythm elements in his score, and included two of the new themes created for ''[[The World Is Not Enough]]''. The first, originally used as Renard's theme, is heard during the mammoth "Antonov" cue on the recording, and is written for piano. The second new theme, used in the "Christmas in Turkey" track of ''The World Is Not Enough'', is reused in the "Going Down Together" track.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/die-another-day-music-from-the-motion-picture-mw0000662575|title=Die Another Day [Music from the Motion Picture]|work=AllMusic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Die Another Day (song)|title song for ''Die Another Day'']] was co-written and co-produced by [[Mirwais Ahmadzai]] and performed by [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], who also had a [[Cameo appearance|cameo]] in the film as Verity, a fencing instructor. The concept of the title sequence is to represent Bond trying to survive 14 months of torture at the hands of the North Koreans. Critics' opinions of the song were sharply divided—it was nominated for a [[Golden Globe]] for Best Original Song and the 2004 [[Grammy Award]] for Best Dance Recording,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cduniverse.com/search/xx/music/pid/5310300/a/Die+Another+Day.htm |title=Die Another Day at CD Universe |accessdate=20 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also for a [[Golden Raspberry Awards|Golden Raspberry Award]] for [[2002 Golden Raspberry Awards|Worst Original Song]] of 2002 (while Madonna herself won the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Supporting Actress for her cameo). In a [[MORI]] poll for the [[Channel 4]] programme ''"James Bond's Greatest Hits"'', the song was voted 9th out of 22, and also came in as an "overwhelming number one" favourite among those under the age of 24.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|people=[[Geoffrey Palmer (actor)|Geoffrey Palmer]] (Narrator) |year=2006 |title=James Bond's Greatest Hits |medium=Television |location=UK |publisher=North One Television}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marketing tie-ins==
MGM and Eon Productions granted [[Mattel]] the license to sell a line of [[Barbie]] dolls based around the franchise. Mattel announced that the Bond Barbies will be at her "stylish best", clad in evening dress and red shawl. [[Lindy Hemming]] created the dress, which is slashed to the thigh to reveal a telephone strapped to Barbie's leg. The doll was sold in a gift set, with Barbie's boyfriend Ken posing as Bond in a tuxedo designed by the Italian fashion house [[Brioni (fashion)|Brioni]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2002/10/18/nbond18.xml |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071113035029/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=%2Fnews%2F2002%2F10%2F18%2Fnbond18.xml |archivedate=13 November 2007 |title=New Bond girl is a real doll |accessdate=17 July 2009 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |location=London |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Revlon]] also collaborated with the makers of ''Die Another Day'' to create a cosmetics line based around the character Jinx. The limited edition 007 Colour Collection was launched on 7 November 2002 to coincide with the film's release. The product names were loaded with puns and [[innuendo]], with shades and textures ranging from the "warm" to "cool and frosted".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/beauty/news-features/TMG4795038/Discover-your-inner-Bond-girl-with-bullet-shaped-mascaras-and-007-blushes.html|title=Discover your inner Bond girl with bullet-shaped mascaras and 007 blushes |accessdate=17 July 2009|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|location=London|date=3 September 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release and reception==
''Die Another Day'' had its world premiere on 18 November 2002 at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in London. [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] and [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Prince Philip]] were guests of honor, making it the second ''Bond'' film premiere to be attended by the Queen, the first one being ''[[You Only Live Twice (film)|You Only Live Twice]]'' in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-416461/Daniel-Craig-makes-007-debut-premiere-Casino-Royale.html |title=Daniel Craig makes his 007 debut at premiere of Casino Royale |accessdate=19 September 2007|location=London| newspaper=Daily Mail | date=18 November 2006|first=Nick | last=Goodway}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Royal Albert Hall had a make-over for the screening and had been transformed into an ice palace. Proceeds from the première, about £500,000, were donated to the [[Cinema and Television Benevolent Fund]] of which the Queen is patron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctbf.co.uk/events/events_q4.html |title=Stars come out to support the cinema &amp; television benevolent fund’s 60th royal film performance|accessdate=17 July 2009|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070815074942/http://www.ctbf.co.uk/events/events_q4.html |archivedate = 15 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the first day, ticket sales reached £1.2 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/tv_film/newsid_2505000/2505093.stm |title=Die Another Day explodes at the box office |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=21 September 2007 | date=22 November 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Die Another Day'' was the highest grossing James Bond film until the release of ''Casino Royale''. It earned $432 million worldwide, becoming the sixth highest-grossing film of 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?view2=worldwide&amp;yr=2002&amp;p=.htm|title=2002 Yearly Box Office Results - Box Office Mojo|work=boxofficemojo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Die Another Day'' was controversial in the [[Korean Peninsula]]. The North Korean government disliked the portrayal of their state as brutal and war-hungry. The South Koreans boycotted 145 theatres where it was released on 31 December 2002, as they were offended by the scene in which an American officer issues orders to the South Korean army in the defence of their homeland, and by a lovemaking scene near a statue of the Buddha. The [[Jogye Order|Jogye Buddhist Order]] issued a statement that the film was "disrespectful to our religion and does not reflect our values and ethics". ''[[The Washington Post]]'' reported growing resentment in the nation towards the United States. An official of the South [[Korean Ministry of Culture and Tourism]] said that ''Die Another Day'' was "the wrong film at the wrong time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Both sides of the DMZ irked by James Bond |work=Northwest Asian Weekly |url=http://www.nwasianweekly.com/archive/commentary04.htm |accessdate=18 November 2006|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061116151009/http://www.nwasianweekly.com/archive/commentary04.htm |archivedate =16 November 2006|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The amount of [[product placement]] in the film was a point of criticism, specifically from various news outlets such as the [[BBC]], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' and [[Reuters]] who all used the pun "Buy Another Day".

On [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film received an [[approval rating]] of 58% based on 215 reviews, with an [[average rating]] of 6.1/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "Its action may be bit too over-the-top for some, but ''Die Another Day'' is lavishly crafted and succeeds in evoking classic Bond themes from the franchise's earlier installments."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/die_another_day/ |title=Die Another Day (2002) |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher=[[Fandango (company)|Fandango]] |accessdate=15 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film has a weighted average score of 56 out of 100 based on 43 critics, indicating "mixed and average reviews".&lt;ref name="meta"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/die-another-day |title=Die Another Day Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=15 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Dequina of ''[[Film Threat]]'' praised the film as the best of the series to star Pierce Brosnan and "the most satisfying installment of the franchise in recent memory."&lt;ref name="meta"/&gt; Larry Carroll of CountingDown.com praised Lee Tamahori for having "magnificently balanced the film so that it keeps true to the Bond legend, makes reference to the classic films that preceded it, but also injects a new zest to it all."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countingdown.com/features?feature_id=2651677 |title=Review: Die Another Day |accessdate=19 September 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012141200/http://countingdown.com/features?feature_id=2651677 |archivedate=12 October 2007  }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' magazine also gave a positive reaction, saying that Tamahori, "a true filmmaker", has re-established the series' pop sensuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,392638~1~0~dieanotherday,00.html |title=Die another Day at EW.com |accessdate=19 September 2007| work=Entertainment Weekly |date=2 December 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dana Stevens of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called the film the best of the ''James Bond'' series since ''[[The Spy Who Loved Me (film)|The Spy Who Loved Me]].''&lt;ref name="meta"/&gt; Kyle Bell of Movie Freaks 365 stated in his review that the "first half of ''Die Another Day'' is classic Bond", but that "Things start to go downhill when the ice palace gets introduced."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://moviefreaks365.com/review.php?artid=63 |title=Die Another Day Review |accessdate=2 April 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111205083458/http://moviefreaks365.com/review.php?artid=63 |archivedate=5 December 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first 20 minutes of ''Die Another Day'' was regarded as "much closer to the grimmer post-9/11 Bond played by [[Daniel Craig]]" [Pierce Brosnan's successor as the actor portraying James Bond] and able to "go toe-to-toe with the darkest moments in franchise history".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gq.com/story/how-die-another-day-almost-blew-up-the-james-bond-franchise|title=The James Bond Movie That Almost Blew Up the Whole Franchise|first=Scott|last=Meslow|date=22 November 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, some reviewers felt the film relied too heavily on gadgets and special effects, with the plot being neglected. [[James Berardinelli]] of Reelviews.net said, "This is a train wreck of an action film – a stupefying attempt by the filmmakers to force-feed James Bond into the mindless ''[[XXX (2002 film)|XXX]]'' mold and throw 40 years of cinematic history down the toilet in favor of bright flashes and loud bangs." Of the action sequences, he said, "''Die Another Day'' is an exercise in loud explosions and excruciatingly bad special effects. The CGI work in this movie is an order of magnitude worse than anything I have seen in a major motion picture. Coupled with lousy production design, ''Die Another Day'' looks like it was done on the cheap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://preview.reelviews.net/movies/d/die_another.html |title=Review: Die Another Day |accessdate=21 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gary Brown of the ''Houston Community Newspapers'' also described the weak point of the film as "the seemingly non-stop action sequences and loud explosions that appear to take centre stage while the Bond character is almost relegated to second string."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ppl.nhmccd.edu/~garyb/reviews/dieanotherday.html |title=Not a good ''Day'' at the office for James Bond |accessdate=21 September 2007|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071012141108/http://ppl.nhmccd.edu/~garyb/reviews/dieanotherday.html |archivedate =12 October 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Moore]], who played Bond in earlier films, said: "I thought it just went too far – and that’s from me, the first Bond in space!

Please!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Roger Moore |title=Bye bye to Ian Fleming's James Bond? |newspaper=The Times |date=4 October 2008 |url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/film/london_film_festival/article4866756.ece |accessdate=5 October 2008|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media==
''Die Another Day'' was novelised by the then-official James Bond writer, [[Raymond Benson]], based on the screenplay by [[Neal Purvis and Robert Wade]]. An effort is made to depict some of the film's more outlandish elements with more believability, in the style of Fleming's original novels' use of cutting-edge technology. So for example, the non-bodywork elements of the Aston Martin with its 'cloaking' function – the glass windows and rubber tyres – are described as having retractable covers to achieve the invisibility effect. Fan reaction to it was above average.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://commanderbond.net/article/1717 |title=Novelized ''Die Another Day'' |publisher=Commanderbond.net |date=11 November 2002 |accessdate=5 March 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070620152015/http://commanderbond.net/article/1717|archivedate=20 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; After its publication Benson retired as the official James Bond novelist and a new series featuring the secret agent's [[Young Bond|adventures as a teenager]], by [[Charlie Higson]], was launched in 2005. As the [[novelisation]] was published after Benson's final original 007 novel, ''[[The Man with the Red Tattoo]]'', it was the final literary work featuring Bond as originally conceived by Ian Fleming until the publication of ''[[Devil May Care (Faulks novel)|Devil May Care]]'' by [[Sebastian Faulks]] in 2008 to mark the 100th anniversary of Fleming's birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6289186.stm |title=Faulks pens new James Bond novel |date=11 July 2007 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=22 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[007 Legends]] released in 2012 features [[Daniel Craig]]'s James Bond in a Die Another Day level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.destructoid.com/license-to-kill-die-another-day-appearing-in-007-legends-233256.phtml|title=License to Kill/Die Another Day appearing in 007 Legends|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cancelled spin-off==
Speculation arose in 2003 of a spin-off film concentrating on Jinx, which was scheduled for a November/December 2004 release. It was originally reported that MGM was keen to set up a film series that would be a "winter olympics" alternative to 'James Bond'. In the late 1990s, MGM had originally considered developing a spin-off film based on [[Michelle Yeoh]]'s character, [[Wai Lin]], in 1997's ''[[Tomorrow Never Dies]]''. However, despite much speculation of an imminent movie, on 26 October 2003, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reported that MGM had completely pulled the plug on this project, to the dismay of Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson of Eon Productions, who were reported to be "clearly furious" about the decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://movies.yahoo.com/shop?d=hp&amp;cf=prev&amp;id=1808475849 |title=Yahoo!

Retrieved 28 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt; MGM was keen to instead move on with the next film, ''[[Casino Royale (2006 film)|Casino Royale]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cinema.com/news/item/6747/halle-berrys-bond-spin-off-cancelled.phtml|title=Halle Berry's Bond spin-off cancelled|work=cinema.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; which went on to feature several recycled ideas originally penned for the cancelled spin-off.

'''''Dirty Jokes and Beer: Stories of the Unrefined''''' is a 1997 book written by [[Drew Carey]].

In a preface to the book, Carey states that he wrote every word of it himself—he did not recruit a [[ghost writer]] although, as he says, "It probably would have been easier."

The book was mentioned briefly in an episode of the US version of the improv comedy TV series ''[[Whose Line Is It Anyway? (U.S. TV series)|Whose Line is it Anyway?]],'' a show which Drew himself hosted from 1998 to 2003. During a game of "Scenes From a Hat," Drew pulled out the subject "books least likely to be checked out at the library" and friend [[Ryan Stiles]] acted as if he was picking a book and read the title "Dirty Jokes and Beer."

==Sections==
The book is divided into three sections, which are referred to in the title. All of the chapters within the first two sections (save for ''101 Big-Dick Jokes'', which "would be redundant") are preceded by a dirty joke Carey has heard over the years.

===The "Dirty Jokes" section===
The first section deals with Drew's views on various topics, such as being at [[airports]] (he writes that he likes to ride around in the carts to make people move out of his way) and the difference between [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] and [[Atlantic City]]. (Carey writes that he prefers Las Vegas, as he sees Atlantic City as being filled with retired people shuffling around, playing nickel slot machines.) The section ends with ''101 Big [[Penis|Dick]] Jokes''.

===The "Beer" section===
This section of the book contains the [[autobiographical]] stories. Drew briefly discusses his upbringing and his time with the [[United States Marine Corps|United States Marines]], as well as his experiences working on [[The Drew Carey Show|his show]]. In this section, he also includes reviews about his show, both positive and negative, as well as some of the notes he received from network censors about the show's content.

==="The Stories Of The Unrefined"===
This section contains five short stories that Drew wrote for the book. He describes these stories as being "Drew in ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]],"'' where he takes some elements from his life and changes them into fictional stories where he is the main protagonist of the stories. These short stories are not preceded by dirty jokes. The very first story "Mi Plea" was a completely true story, except for the ending. And the stories about his friend Larry and girlfriend Natalie were completely fabricated. As was his story about himself in Las Vegas.

'''Erwin Friedrich Maximilian Piscator''' (17 December 1893 – 30 March 1966) was a German [[theatre director]] and [[Theatrical producer|producer]] and, along with [[Bertolt Brecht]], the foremost exponent of [[epic theatre]], a form that emphasizes the socio-political content of drama, rather than its [[psychological manipulation|emotional manipulation]] of the audience or the production's formal [[beauty]].&lt;ref&gt;''Piscator, Erwin''.

==Biography==

===Youth and wartime experience===
[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-P015298, Berlin, Volksbühne.jpg|thumb|The Volksbühne Berlin, scene of Piscator's early successes as a stage director in 1924]]
'''Erwin Friedrich Max Piscator''' was born on 17 December 1893 in the small [[Prussia]]n village of [[Greifenstein|Greifenstein-Ulm]], the son of Carl Piscator, a merchant, and his wife Antonia Laparose.&lt;ref&gt;Willett, John. 1978. The Theatre of Erwin Piscator: Half a Century of Politics in the Theatre. London: Methuen. pg 13.&lt;/ref&gt; His family was descended from [[Johannes Piscator]], a [[Protestant]] [[theologian]] who produced an important translation of the [[Bible]] in 1600.&lt;ref&gt;Willett (1978, 42).&lt;/ref&gt; The family moved to the university town [[Marburg]] in 1899 where Piscator attended the [[Gymnasium Philippinum]]. In the autumn of 1913, he attended a private Munich drama school and enrolled at [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|University of Munich]] to study [[German language|German]], [[philosophy]] and [[art history]]. Piscator also took [[Arthur Kutscher]]'s famous seminar in [[History of theatre|theatre history]] which [[Bertolt Brecht]] was also later to attend.&lt;ref&gt;Willett (1978, 43)&lt;/ref&gt; He began his acting career in the autumn of 1914, in small unpaid roles at the [[National Theatre Munich|Munich Court Theatre]], under the directorship of [[Ernst von Possart]]. In 1896, [[Karl Lautenschläger]] had installed one of the world's first [[revolving stage]]s in that theatre.&lt;ref name="will"&gt;Willett (1978, 43).&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[World War I|First World War]] Piscator was [[Conscription|drafted]] into the [[German Army (German Empire)|German army]], serving in a [[Western Front (World War I)|frontline]] [[infantry]] unit as a [[Landsturm]] soldier from the spring of 1915 (and later as a [[signaller]]). The experience inspired a hatred of [[militarism]] and [[war]] that lasted for the rest of his life, as well as a few bitter [[poem]]s, published in 1915 and 1916 in the [[left-wing]] [[Expressionist]] literary magazine ''[[Die Aktion]]''. In summer 1917, having participated in the battles at [[Ypres Salient]] and been in hospital once, he was assigned to a newly established army theatre unit. In November 1918, when the [[Armistice with Germany (Compiègne)|armistice]] was declared, Piscator gave a speech in [[Hasselt]] at the first meeting of a revolutionary Soldiers' Council ([[Soviet (council)|Soviet]]).&lt;ref name="will"/&gt;

===Early success in the Weimar Republic===
[[File:Nollendorfplatz B-Schoeneberg 06-2017 img1.jpg|thumb|The Piscator-Bühne in Berlin (1927–29), formerly known as Neues Schauspielhaus]]
In collaboration with the writer [[Hans Rehfisch | Hans José Rehfisch]], he formed a theatre company in Berlin at the Comedy-Theater on Alte Jacobsstrasse, following the [[Volksbühne]] ("people's stage") concept, where in 1922–1923 they staged works by [[Maxim Gorky]], [[Romain Rolland]] and [[Leo Tolstoy]].&lt;ref&gt;Willett (1978, 15–16, 46–47).&lt;/ref&gt; As stage director at the [[Volksbühne]] (1924–1927), and later as managing director at his own theatre (the [[Neues Schauspielhaus|Piscator-Bühne]] on [[Nollendorfplatz]]), Piscator produced social and political plays especially suited to his theories. His dramatic aims were utilitarian — to influence voters or clarify left-wing policies. He used mechanized sets, lectures, movies, and mechanical devices that appealed to his audiences. In 1926, his updated production of [[Friedrich Schiller]]'s ''[[The Robbers]]'' at the distinguished [[Konzerthaus Berlin|Preußisches Staatstheater]] in Berlin provoked widespread controversy. Piscator cut the text heavily and reinterpreted it as a vehicle for his political beliefs. He presented the protagonist Karl Moor as a substantially self-absorbed insurgent. As Karl's foil, Piscator made the character of Spiegelberg, often presented as a sinister figure, the voice of the working-class revolution. Spiegelberg appeared as a [[Trotskyist]] intellectual, slightly reminiscent of [[Charlie Chaplin]] with his cane and bowler hat. As he died, the audience heard ''[[The Internationale]]'' sung. 

Piscator founded the influential (though short-lived) Piscator-Bühne in Berlin in 1927. In 1928 he produced a notable adaptation of the unfinished episodic comic [[Czechoslovakia|Czech]] [[novel]] ''[[The Good Soldier Schweik]]''. The dramaturgical collective that produced this adaptation included Bertolt Brecht.&lt;ref&gt;Willett (1978, 90–95).&lt;/ref&gt; Brecht later described it as a "[[Soviet montage theory|montage]] from the novel".&lt;ref&gt;See Brecht's ''Journal'' entry for 24 June 1943. Brecht claimed in his ''Journal'' entry to have written the adaptation, but Piscator contested that; the manuscript bears the names "Brecht, Gasbarra, Piscator, [[George Grosz|G. Grosz]]" in Brecht's handwriting (John Willett. 1978. Art and Politics in the Weimar Period: The New Sobriety 1917–1933. New York: Da Capo Press, 1996, 110). Brecht wrote another ''Schweik'' drama in 1943, ''[[Schweik in the Second World War]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leo Lania]]'s play ''Konjunktur'' (Oil Boom) premiered in Berlin in 1928, directed by Erwin Piscator, with incidental music by [[Kurt Weill]]. Three oil companies fight over the rights to oil production in a primitive Balkan country, and in the process exploit the people and destroy the environment. Weill's songs from this play, like ''Die Muschel von Margate'' are still part of the modern repertoire of art music.&lt;ref&gt;The Kurt Weill Foundation for Music's Documentation on [https://www.kwf.org/pages/ww-muschel-von-margate.html ''Muschel von Margate'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1929 Piscator published his own work on the theory of theatre, ''The Political Theatre''.&lt;ref&gt;Piscator (1929).&lt;/ref&gt; In the preface to its 1963 edition, Piscator wrote that the book was "assembled in hectic sessions during rehearsals for ''The Merchant of Berlin''" by [[Walter Mehring]], which had opened on 6 September 1929 at the second Piscator-Bühne.&lt;ref name=pvi&gt;Piscator (1929, vi).&lt;/ref&gt; It was intended to provide "a definitive explanation and elucidation of the basic facts of epic, i.e. political theatre", which at that time "was still meeting with widespread rejection and misapprehension."&lt;ref name=pvi/&gt; Three decades later, Piscator felt that:
{{cquote|The justification for epic techniques is no longer disputed by anyone, but there is considerable confusion about what should be expressed by these means. The ''functional'' character of these epic techniques, in other words their inseparability from a specific content (the specific content, the specific message determines the means and not vice versa!) has by now become largely obscured.

In 1931, after the collapse of the third Piscator-Bühne, Piscator went to Moscow in order to make the motion picture ''[[Revolt of the Fishermen]]'' with actor [[Aleksei Dikiy]] for [[Gorky Film Studio|Mezhrabpom]], the Soviet film company associated with the [[International Workers Relief|International Workers' Relief]] Organisation.&lt;ref&gt;Gerhard F.

New York etc.: Peter Lang, 1991, p. 7. {{ISBN|0-8204-1591-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; As [[John Willett]] put it, throughout the pre-Hitler years Piscator's "commitment to the Russian Revolution was a decisive factor in all his work."&lt;ref&gt;John Willett: Introduction, in: ''Erwin Piscator. 1893–1966. An Exhibition by the Archiv der Akademie der Künste Berlin, in cooperation with the Goethe Institute''. Ed. by Walter Huder. London 1979, p. 1–4, p.1.&lt;/ref&gt; With Hitler's rise to power in 1933, Piscator's stay in the [[Soviet Union]] became exile.&lt;ref&gt;Hermann Haarmann: ''Politisches Theater im Geiste der Polis. Die späte Heimkehr des Erwin Piscator''. In: ''Freie Volksbühne Berlin 1890–1990. Beiträge zur Geschichte der Volksbühnenbewegung in Berlin''. Ed. by Dietger Pforte. Berlin: Argon 1990. Pp. 195–210, p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1936, Piscator left the Soviet Union for France. In 1937, he married dancer [[Maria Ley Piscator|Maria Ley]] in Paris. [[Bertolt Brecht]] was one of the groomsmen.

During his years in Berlin, Piscator had collaborated with [[Lena Goldschmidt]] on a stage adaptation of [[Theodore Dreiser]]'s bestselling novel ''[[An American Tragedy]]''; under the title ''The Case of Clyde Griffiths'' and with [[Lee Strasberg]] as director, it had run for 19 performances on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in 1936. When Piscator and Ley subsequently migrated to the [[United States]] in 1939, Piscator was invited by [[Alvin Saunders Johnson|Alvin Johnson]], the founding president of [[The New School]], to establish a theatre workshop. Among Piscator's students at this [[Dramatic Workshop]] in New York were [[Bea Arthur]], [[Harry Belafonte]], [[Marlon Brando]], [[Tony Curtis]], [[Ben Gazzara]], [[Judith Malina]], [[Walter Matthau]], [[Rod Steiger]], [[Elaine Stritch]], [[Eli Wallach]], [[Jack Creley]] and [[Tennessee Williams]].&lt;ref&gt;Willett (1978, 166).&lt;/ref&gt;

Piscator returned to [[West Germany]] in 1951 due to [[McCarthyism|McCarthy era]] political pressure.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexander Stephan]]: ''Im Visier des FBI. Deutsche Exilschriftsteller in den Akten amerikanischer Geheimdienste''. Stuttgart, Weimar 1995, p. 373.&lt;/ref&gt; He was appointed manager and director of the [[Freie Volksbühne]] in [[West Berlin]] in 1962. To much international critical acclaim, in February 1963, Piscator premièred [[Rolf Hochhuth]]'s ''[[The Deputy]]'', a play "about Pope Pius XII and the allegedly neglected rescue of Italian Jews from Nazi gas chambers."&lt;ref&gt;Gerhard F. Probst: ''Erwin Piscator and the American Theatre''. New York etc.: Peter Lang, 1991, p. 19. {{ISBN|0-8204-1591-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until his death in 1966, Piscator was a major exponent of contemporary and [[documentary theatre]]. Piscator's wife, Maria Ley, died in New York city in 1999.

Piscator's contribution to theatre has been described by theatre historian Günther Rühle as "the boldest advance made by the German stage" during the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Günther Rühle: Erwin Piscator: Dream and Achievement, in: ''Erwin Piscator. 1893–1966. An Exhibition by the Archiv der Akademie der Künste Berlin, in cooperation with the Goethe Institute''. Ed. by Walter Huder. London 1979, p. 12–19, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Piscator's theatre techniques of the 1920s — such as the extensive use of still and cinematic projections from 1925 on, as well as complex scaffold stages — had an extensive influence on European and American production methods. His dramaturgy of contrasts led to sharp political satirical effects and anticipated the commentary techniques of epic theatre.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

In the Federal Republic of Germany, Piscator's interventionist theatre model experienced a late second zenith. Several productions trying to come to terms with the Germans' Nazi past and on other timely issues made Piscator the inspirer of a mnemonic and documentary theatre from 1962 on. Piscator's stage adaptation of [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s novel ''[[War and Peace]]''&lt;ref&gt;''Leo Tolstoy. War and peace''. Adapted for the stage by [[Alfred Neumann (writer)|Alfred Neumann]], Erwin Piscator and Guntram Prüfer. London: Macgibbon &amp; Kee 1963.&lt;/ref&gt; has been played in some 16 countries since 1955, including three productions in New York.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

Director: Murray Grigor. [[Fife|Inverkeithing]]: Everallin 1984 (documentary film).&lt;/ref&gt; In the fall of 1985, an Erwin Piscator Award was inaugurated that is annually being awarded in New York, the adopted city of Piscator's second wife Maria Ley. Additionally, a Piscator Prize of Honors has been annually awarded to generous patrons of art and culture in commemoration of Maria Ley since 1996. The host of the Erwin Piscator Award is the international [[non-profit organisation]] "Elysium  − between two continents" that aims at fostering artistic and academic dialogue and exchange between the United States and Europe. In 2016, a Piscator monument has been raised in his birthplace Greifenstein-Ulm.&lt;ref&gt;Erwin Piscator Monument (in German), [https://www.greifenstein.de/freizeit-tourismus-kultur/erwin-piscator-denkmal.html Greifenstein-Ulm website]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Fairy Festival''', '''Faery Festival''' or '''Fairy Fayre''' is an outdoor gathering typically including costuming, handicrafts, music or other entertainment and food. Fairy Festivals are sometimes considered a form of [[Renaissance fair]], although they lack historical basis and the depiction of fairies is generally based on Victorian [[Romanticism]] rather than historical lore.

'''''Feature Comics''''' was a [[comic book]] anthology title published in the [[United States]] by [[Quality Comics]] from 1939 until 1950, that featured short stories in the superhero and humor genres. The series was a continuation of ''[[Feature Funnies]]'', a reprint collection of newspaper comic strips that was published by [[Harry "A" Chesler]] between 1937 and 1939, for twenty issues. ''Feature Comics'' continued the numbering with issue #21, and ran until #144.

== Recurring features ==
* '''[[Doll Man]]''': a shrinking superhero written and created by [[Will Eisner]] (under the [[pen name]] "William Erwin Maxwell") debuted in #27 and was the lead feature through #139.
* '''[[Clock (comics)|The Clock]]''': [[George Brenner]]'s masked crime-fighter was featured was carried over from ''Feature Funnies'', running in every issue of ''Feature Comics'' from #21–31 (Apr. 1940), when he moved over to the new Quality Comics title ''[[Crack Comics]]''.
* '''[[Jane Arden (comics)|Jane Arden]]''': Reprints of the popular newspaper strip featuring a spunky gal reporter were carried over from ''Feature Funnies'', running in every issue of ''Feature Comics'' from #21–31 (Apr. 1940), when the strip also moved over to ''Crack Comics''.
* '''[[Spider Widow]]''': a female crime-fighter dressed as a stereotypical [[Hallowe'en]] witch, with a green-faced old crone mask, a floppy black hat, and a long black dress. [[Frank Borth]]'s strip ran from issue #57 (June 1942) to #72 (June 1943).
* '''[[Stunt Man Stetson]]''': a story about an amateur detective in [[Hollywood]] was the lead from #140 until #144.

Other notable characters that appeared in ''Feature Comics'' include [[Phantom Lady]], as well as many strips serving as backups, including [[Boody Rogers]]' "Babe" and "Dudley", "[[Rube Goldberg]]'s Side Show," [[Louis Cazeneuve]]'s "Yank and Doodle," and the sports strip "Ned Brant." (Like the Clock and "Jane Arden," the "Ned Brant" feature also moved over to ''Crack Comics'' after issue #31, making room for new ''Feature Comics'' features.)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6241">'''Fofão''' is a fictional character from old Brazilian children TV shows Balão Mágico and TV Fofão. He was played by the Brazilian actor and humorist [[:pt:Orival Pessini|Orival Pessini]]. He became very popular among Brazilian kids in the 1980s, having his own TV show, discs, dolls and many licensed products.

The character's first appearance was in the morning children's television program ''[[Balão Mágico (TV series)|Balão Mágico]]'' in 1983, as a supporting character to the [[Turma do Balão Mágico|children's musical group]].&lt;ref name="memória "&gt;{{cite web|URL=http://memoriaglobo.globo.com/programas/entretenimento/infantojuvenis/balao-magico/evolucao.htm|title=BALÃO MÁGICO - EVOLUÇÃO|author=|date=|publisher=[[Globo.com|Memória Globo]]|access-date=13 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the character became very popular, arriving to become one of the icons of Brazilian media during the 80s, mainly due to high sales of a [[Stuffed toy|plush toy]] based on the character.&lt;ref name="memória" /&gt; After the end of the original program in 1986, the character won a solo program in the same year, broadcast by [[Rede Bandeirantes]] until 1989, called ''TV Fofão'' (with a return between 1994–1996).&lt;ref name="fofao"&gt;{{cite web|URL=http://televisao.uol.com.br/noticias/redacao/2014/07/25/dezoito-anos-apos-sair-da-tv-fofao-voltara-como-game-desenho-e-boneco.htm|title=Trinta anos após criação, Fofão voltará como game, desenho e boneco|author=Natália Guaratto|date=25 July 2014|publisher=[[Universo Online|UOL]]|access-date=13 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last appearance of the character on television was in 1998 by the channel [[:pt:CNT Gazeta|CNT Gazeta]].

In 1989 the character starred in a theatrical movie titled ''[[:pt:Fofão e a Nave sem Rumo|Fofão e a Nave Sem Rumo]]''. The character has also led to several other licensed products and sold numerous albums of children's songs during the 80s and 90s.

==Creation==
According to Orival Pessini, Fofão was created at the request of TV Globo director José Bonifácio de Oliveira Sobrinho (a.k.a. Boni), who needed a child character for the program Balão Mágico, which would debut in a few months, and any character that was created would go on the air. Orival had never worked with children and had no idea what to create, imagined various possibilities, such as a dog, a pig, a clown, a teddy bear, an extraterrestrial or a human being, after thinking he decided to mix all the imagined alternatives, resulting in Fofão. Other inspiration that Orival had to create Fofão was [[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial|Steven Spielberg's E.T]], which according him "was very ugly, with disgusting appearance and his head looked like as inverted foot, but he had a great heart and was very charismatic", so decided to create a similar character.

==Controversy and legacy==
At the end of the 1980s an [[urban legend]] about the plush toy of the character has become quite controversial.&lt;ref&gt;http://mundoestranho.abril.com.br/materia/o-homem-que-criou-a-maldicao-do-fofao&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.assombrado.com.br/2013/07/os-10-bonecos-mais-assombrados.html&lt;/ref&gt; The legend claims that the doll had inside its body a knife, supposedly meant for evil rituals and killing children. The doll has even come to be compared to [[Chucky (Child's Play)|Chucky]] from ''[[Child's Play (franchise)|Child's Play]]'' horror film series. In recent years the mystery was partially confirmed when it was revealed that the doll had a pointed hard plastic object as its spinal chord.

In 2016, Fofão was again popular on the internet, when a group of street performers titled “Carreta Furacão” became a popular meme in Brazil. The group features several amateur artists, dressed up as fictional characters of popular culture, like [[Popeye]], [[Captain America]], [[Mickey Mouse]], Fofão himself, and a generic clown.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://musica.uol.com.br/noticias/redacao/2016/04/15/sensacao-da-web-personagens-do-carreta-furacao-viram-estrelas-de-clipe.htm| title=Sensação da web, personagens do Carreta Furacão viram estrelas de clipe - Últimas Notícias - UOL Música|access-date=2016-04-16|work=UOL Música|language=pt-BR}}&lt;/ref&gt; Videos of the artists dancing and performing acrobatics on the streets were popular on [[YouTube]] and became a meme on the internet. Fofão was considered the most prominent character to be used by the artists like a leader; however, Orival Pessini made a protest against the group, prohibiting the use of his character in political affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2016/04/1760572-nao-autorizo-minha-imagem-no-protesto-contra-a-dilma-diz-fofao.shtml| title=Não autorizo minha imagem no protesto contra a Dilma, diz Fofão - 13/04/2016 - Ilustrada - Folha de S.Paulo|access-date=2016-04-16|work=www1.folha.uol.com.br}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2016/04/1760206-mbl-planeja-show-pro-impeachment-com-carreta-furacao-hit-da-web.shtml| title=MBL planeja show pró-impeachment com Carreta Furacão, hit da web - 12/04/2016 - Poder - Folha de S.Paulo|access-date=2016-04-16|work=www1.folha.uol.com.br}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://oglobo.globo.com/cultura/criador-do-fofao-proibe-personagem-da-carreta-furacao-em-protestos-19075621| title=Criador do Fofão proíbe personagem da Carreta Furacão em protestos|access-date=2016-04-16|work=O Globo|language=pt-BR}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some changes were then made to the generic character from the group.

On October 14, 2016, Fofão creator Orival Pessini died of spleen cancer, aged 72.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tvefamosos.uol.com.br/noticias/redacao/2016/10/14/morre-aos-72-anos-orival-pessini-criador-de-fofao-patropi-e-socrates.htm Morre, aos 72 anos, Orival Pessini, criador de Fofão, Patropi e Sócrates] {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Igor Vladimirovich Ilyinsky''' ({{lang-ru|И́горь Влади́мирович Ильи́нский}}; 24 July 1901 – 13 January 1987) was a famous [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] and [[Russians|Russian]] film and stage actor, director and comedian. [[Hero of Socialist Labour]] (1974) and [[People's Artist of the USSR]] (1949). 

==Early years==
Igor Ilyinsky was born on 24 July 1901 in Moscow. At age 16 he entered the Theatre Studio of [[Theodore Komisarjevsky]] and in half a year already debuted on the professional stage in [[Komissarjevsky Theatre]]. His first theatre role was that of the "Old Man" in [[Aristophanes]]' play ''[[Lysistrata]]''. In 1920, he joined the [[Vsevolod Meyerhold]] Theatre. The young actor's style was in correspondence with the principles of Meyerhold, and so Ilyinsky soon became the central actor of that theatre.

==Career in silent cinema==
In the mid-1920s Ilyinsky started to appear in movies, where he also played vivid comic characters. In 1924, [[Yakov Protazanov]] featured him in his famous futuristic film ''[[Aelita]]'', which was followed by his role in Protazanov's comedy ''[[The Tailor from Torzhok]]'' (1925). In 1926, he appeared in three films.&lt;blockquote&gt;
“I can act on the roof of a train carriage, on the radiator of a moving car, on back of a galloping horse, or while swimming in the sea”.&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

==1930s-1950s==
In 1938 he joined the [[Maly Theatre (Moscow)|Maly Theatre]] that had been his favourite one since school years. Afterwards Ilyinsky stayed in the Maly Theatre for almost fifty years and even staged several plays there himself. Ilyinsky would later write that it was [[Russian literature|Russian classic literature]] that had helped him overcome the crisis and feeling that he had been unable to create new characters, different from the previous ones. An outstandingly prolific period in the actor’s life was related to his work with the famous film director [[Grigori Aleksandrov]]. In 1938 Ilyinsky splendidly acted as Byvalov in the comedy [[Volga-Volga]] (for this role, he was awarded [[Stalin Prize]] in 1941). He deliberately avoided any comic traits in his character to create a common image of a red-tapist.  

The starting point for him was the gracious and stirring character of [[Lyubov Orlova]]. He decided to create a totally contrasting character, which he succeeded in. That role brought Ilyinsky the State Prize. [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] reportedly watched the film sixteen times. At Molotov's birthday party Stalin flung Ilyinsky a remark: “Ah, Byvalov! You are a bureaucrat and I am a bureaucrat. We shall understand each other”. The success of that movie determined the development of Soviet film comedy for the next several decades. However, after the film Ilyinsky almost stopped his film acting. In the mid-1950s Ilyinsky finally got a chance to act in a movie. It was a light comedy, ''[[A Crazy Day]]''. The character created by Ilyinsky was a repetition of what he had done 20 years earlier. He managed to play a truly starry film role only 18 years after Volga-Volga. It was the role of the bureaucrat Ogurtsov in the smash-hit comedy ''[[The Carnival Night]]'', directed by [[Eldar Ryazanov]].  

&lt;blockquote&gt;''“I was not going to feature the great Igor Ilyinsky in The Carnival Night - I felt timid, and understood that being a coryphaeus he would suppress me. When Pyriev offered him for the role of Ogurtsov, I just panicked: he was my idol from childhood, the famous actor of the Meyerhold Theatre! And me, directing my first film, on the other scale!”'' (Eldar Ryazanov)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Later years==
In Maly Theatre at the same time Ilyinsky shifted to portrayals of deeply tragic characters, in particular, from [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]] and [[Leo Tolstoy]]. In the late 1960s Ilyinsky went into stage directing. His first stage production was the stage version of [[Gustave Flaubert]]'s popular novel ''[[Madame Bovary]]''. The last period of Ilyinsky’s career was marked by his portrayal of [[Leo Tolstoy]] in the play ''Turning Full Circle and of Firs'', and his performance in ''[[The Cherry Orchard]]'' by [[Anton Chekhov]]. As a very old person Igor Ilyinsky acted a lot on the radio – almost blind, he was accompanied to the studio. 

==Death==
Igor Ilyinsky died on 13 January 1987, aged 85. His widow, actress [[Tatyana Yeremeyeva]], died on 29 November 2012, aged 99.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kommersant.ru/doc/2078633 Notice of death of Tatyana Yeremeyeva]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''King Rising levitation''' is a [[Levitation (illusion)|levitation illusion]] developed by and named after Corey King. Some consider it to be a variation of the [[Balducci levitation]].

==Effect==
The performer is viewed from the side. The performer's legs may be covered (commonly with a jacket) at the beginning of the effect. At this point the performer may patter, saying something like, “You may have seen other magicians levitate behind a jacket...". This is a reference to the [[Superman]] levitation. The obstruction (jacket, etc.) would then be removed. The performer's whole body is clearly visible. The performer suddenly appears to levitate a few inches above the ground. Both feet are clearly seen to be in the air. The levitation usually lasts just a few seconds. When both feet return to the ground, the performer's legs may again be momentarily obscured. The performer may again make a comparative reference to the Superman levitation. Immediately afterwards the effect is complete, and the performer (particularly the performer's clothing) and the area around the performer can be thoroughly examined.

[[Image:Kingrisinglevitation2.nwr.jpg|thumb|right|The King Rising levitation being performed]]

The biggest advantage of this levitation effect is that it is (like the [[Balducci levitation]]) impromptu. It can be performed anytime, anywhere, as long as the performer is wearing pants and shoes. It is more believable than the Balducci levitation because both feet are clearly seen in the air. However, it does require a small set-up that must be done under some kind of cover (an obstruction or [[misdirection (magic)|misdirection]]). It is also considerably more difficult to perform than the Balducci levitation.

==Method==

The performer stands so as to be viewed from the side. Under cover, the performer removes his or her foot from the far shoe and positions it at a right angle to that shoe, with the heel of the foot placed against the side of the shoe. After the obstruction is removed, the front of the performer's body can be seen. From the spectator's perspective it is impossible to tell that the performer's foot is out, because it is hidden by the leg closest to the viewers. The performer's weight is shifted to the leg, and the empty shoe is pinched between the angled foot and the shoe closest to the audience. The performer stands on the tip of the foot. Again, the foot remains hidden behind the shoes, which are both physically in the air, creating the genuine levitation. To end the effect the process is simply reversed.

The key to this illusion is that the spectators assume that there is a foot inside of the shoe, which is only natural. When both shoes are seen above the ground, it is then assumed that both feet are above the ground, and the performer is levitating.

Note that an obstruction is generally used to hide the performer's action of removing, and replacing the foot in its shoe. It is possible however to perform the effect without ever covering the legs, by using misdirection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people= |date= |title=King Rising Levitation - How To Levitate or Float |url=http://www.ellusionist.com/king-rising-levitation.html |format=DVD |medium= |publisher=Ellusionist |location= |accessdate= |time= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Megamind''''' is a 2010 American [[3D Film|3D]] [[Computer-animated film|computer-animated]] [[Superhero film|superhero]] [[comedy film]]  directed by [[Tom McGrath (animator)|Tom McGrath]], produced by [[DreamWorks Animation]] and distributed by [[Paramount Pictures]]. The film premiered on October 28, 2010, in [[Russia]], while it was released in the United States in [[Digital 3D]], [[IMAX 3D]] and 2D on November 5, 2010. It features the voices of [[Will Ferrell]], [[Tina Fey]], [[Jonah Hill]], [[David Cross]], and [[Brad Pitt]].&lt;ref name="superherohype"&gt;{{cite web | author=SuperHeroHype | url=http://www.superherohype.com/news/articles/99311-ferrell-pitt-and-hill-to-voice-oobermind | title=Ferrell, Pitt and Hill to voice Oobermind | publisher=[[Superhero Hype!]] | date=August 16, 2009 | accessdate=August 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film tells the story of a super-intelligent alien supervillain, Megamind, who after a long-lasting battle one day actually destroys his foe, the much-loved superhero Metro Man. Having Metro City for himself, Megamind finds out that his villainy has no purpose and thus creates a new superhero to serve as his nemesis. His plan backfires, as he ends up creating instead a new super-villain. With Metro City spiraling out of control, Megamind attempts to set things right and discovers his newfound purpose—as a superhero.

''Megamind'' received generally positive reviews from critics, praising its strong visuals and the cast's performances, but criticizing its unoriginality.&lt;ref name="rt"/&gt; With a budget of $130 million, the film grossed over $321 million worldwide,&lt;ref name="Box Office" /&gt; becoming one of DreamWorks Animation's lowest-grossing CG animated films of the 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fritz|first=Ben|title='Megamind' less than a mega-success overseas|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/jan/03/entertainment/la-et-box-office-sidebar-20110103|accessdate=September 3, 2012|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=January 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A short film, titled ''[[Megamind: The Button of Doom]]'', was released on February 25, 2011, on the ''Megamind'' DVD and Blu-ray.

==Plot==
Ever since they arrived on Earth as infants, supervillain Megamind has fought superhero Metro Man for dominance of Metro City. In his latest plan, Megamind and his sidekick Minion kidnap reporter Roxanne Ritchi and hold her hostage in a copper-lined observatory. When Metro Man arrives to save her, he reveals he is weakened by copper, and Megamind obliterates him with a death ray. Megamind finally takes control of the city, but his celebration is short-lived as without Metro Man to challenge him, he finds his life has no meaning.

While wandering the recently-opened Metro Man Museum, Megamind sees Roxanne nearby, and uses his holographic disguise watch to take the form of Bernard, the museum's curator, whom he had "dehydrated" into a small cube. He talks to Roxanne and becomes attracted to her, and is inspired by one of her statements to create a new superhero for him to fight. Megamind returns to his lair and creates a serum containing Metro Man's DNA which he plans to inject into a proper candidate with his Defuser Gun. However, Roxanne's arrival at his lair with her dimwitted cameraman Hal Stewart causes Megamind to inadvertently inject Hal with the serum. Megamind disguises himself as Hal's "Space Dad" and convinces him to become the superhero "Titan". Titan spends several days training with his Space Dad before issuing a challenge to fight Megamind.

On the day before the fight, Megamind gets into an argument with Minion about giving up villainy for Roxanne, while Titan tries and fails to woo her. Megamind, disguised as Bernard, takes Roxanne on a dinner date. Titan sees them, and as he had been infatuated with Roxanne, becomes upset and leaves. Shortly thereafter, Megamind's disguise fails, revealing his identity to Roxanne, who also storms off. The situation leaves him unable to find his invisible car, which is where he left the Defuser Gun he used to inject the serum into Hal.

Titan does not arrive at the scheduled fight, and Megamind finds that he has used his abilities for criminal purposes. As "Space Dad" and "Bernard" Megamind successfully convinces Titan to fight him as Titan realizes Megamind has used him and "taken" Roxanne from him. Titan engages in a super-powered fight with Megamind and his mechs hit. However, when Titan wants to ''kill'' him instead of arrest him, Megamind lures Titan into a copper-lined trap, but he is unaffected and continues to fight. Megamind escapes from the battle and seeks out Roxanne, hoping she can help. She offers to take him to Metro Man's secret headquarters, where they are both surprised to find Metro Man alive. Metro Man faked his death and weakness to copper, as he had become tired of being a superhero and wanted to retire to become a music star. He declines to help, but offers Megamind the advice that a hero will always rise up to challenge evil.

Returning to the city, Megamind does not believe he can become the hero the city needs, and allows himself to be locked up in prison. Titan kidnaps Roxanne and demands Megamind show himself or else. Megamind has a change of heart and pleads with the prison warden, apologizing for his past actions. The warden reveals himself to be Minion in disguise, accepting Megamind's apology, and frees him so they can fight Hal.

As Hal is about to kill Roxanne, Megamind appears and frees her. The two escape, but Hal traps Megamind under rubble when Metro Man suddenly arrives, and Hal flees. Roxanne discovers that "Megamind" is really an injured Minion in disguise, while "Metro Man" is Megamind. Hal, in his flight, recognizes Megamind's distinctive mispronunciations, and realizes he was duped. Hal flies back and fights Megamind, during which Megamind finds his invisible car. He grabs the Defuser Gun and is able to extract the Metro Man serum from Titan, restoring him to normal. Hal is arrested for his crimes. Now hailed as heroes, Megamind and Minion appear at the reopening of Metro Man's museum, now dedicated to Megamind instead, while Metro Man, in disguise within the crowd, silently congratulates his former rival.

In a [[mid-credits scene]] Minion is doing the laundry when a re-hydrated Bernard pops out of the washing machine.

==Reception==

===Box office===
''Megamind'' opened to $12.5 million on opening day, and earned $46 million over the three-day weekend, taking the No. 1 spot and averaged $11,668 from around 7,300 screens at 3,944 theaters. The opening was a bit higher than ''[[How to Train Your Dragon (film)|How to Train Your Dragon]]'', which earned $43.7 million back in March 2010. It was the fifth-highest opening for an animated feature in 2010. In its second weekend, it repeated at No. 1 and dropped 37% to $29.1 million for a $7,374 average from 3,949 theaters, and bringing its 10-day cumulative total to $88.8 million. On its third weekend, it fell 45% to $16 million and finished second to ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1]]'', averaging $4,237 from 3,779 theaters. Over Thanksgiving weekend, it held well with just a 22% drop to $12.6 million and slid to third place behind ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1'' and ''[[Tangled]]'' (it earned $17,304,307 over the five-day Thanksgiving period). Following Thanksgiving, the film fell a sharp 61% in its fifth weekend to $4.9 million and finished in sixth place.

The film closed in theaters on February 24, 2011 (a day before it was released on DVD and Blu-ray), earning $148.4 million in North America, and $173.5 million in other countries, for a worldwide total of $321.9 million.&lt;ref name="Box Office" /&gt; The final gross was on the low end for a DreamWorks Animation film, but was still a box office success since it beat its $130 million budget. It is the sixth-highest-grossing animated film from 2010 worldwide, behind ''[[Toy Story 3]]'' ($1.063 billion), ''[[Shrek Forever After]]'' ($753 million), ''Tangled'' ($591 million), ''[[Despicable Me]]'' ($543 million), and ''How to Train Your Dragon'' ($494 million), the highest-grossing film worldwide in both Ferrell and Fey's careers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://boxofficemojo.com/people/chart/?view=Actor&amp;id=willferrell.htm|title=Will Ferrell Box Office Results|accessdate=July 6, 2011|work=[[Box Office Mojo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.boxofficemojo.com/people/chart/?view=Actor&amp;id=tinafey.htm|title=Tina Fey Box Office Results|accessdate=March 30, 2011|work=[[Box Office Mojo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the fourth-highest-grossing superhero comedy film, behind ''[[Incredibles 2]]'', ''[[The Incredibles]]'' and ''[[Big Hero 6 (film)|Big Hero 6]]''.

===Critical response===
Review aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives a score of 72% based on 176 reviews and an average rating of 6.6 out of 10.&lt;ref name="rt"&gt;{{cite web|title=Megamind (2010)|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/megamind/|publisher= [[Flixster]] | work = [[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=December 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site's consensus states the film "regurgitates plot points from earlier animated efforts, and isn't quite as funny as it should be, but a top-shelf voice cast and strong visuals help make ''Megamind'' a pleasant, if unspectacular, diversion."&lt;ref name="rt" /&gt; Another review aggregator, [[Metacritic]], which assigns a [[normalization (statistics)|normalized]] rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, calculated an average score of 63 based on 33 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Megamind|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/megamind|publisher= CBS Interactive | work = [[Metacritic]] |accessdate=October 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Audiences polled by Cinemascore gave ''Megamind'' a grade of "A-" on a scale from A+ to F-.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Company Town: 'Megamind' orchestrates a box-office win | date = November 8, 2010 | author = Steven Zeitchik | work = [[Los Angeles Times]] | url = http://articles.latimes.com/2010/nov/08/entertainment/la-et-box-office-20101108 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' awarded the film three out of four stars, stating "This set-up is bright and amusing, even if it does feel recycled from bits and pieces of such recent animated landmarks as ''[[The Incredibles]]'' with its superpowers and ''[[Despicable Me]]'' with its villain."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20101103/REVIEWS/101109990 | authorlink = Roger Ebert | last = Ebert | first = Roger | title=Megamind :: rogerebert.com |publisher=[[Sun Times Media Group]] | work=Chicago Sun-Times | date=November 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen Holden, of ''[[The New York Times]]'', positively wrote in his review, "Visually ''Megamind'' is immaculately sleek and gracefully enhanced by 3-D."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/2010/11/05/movies/05mega.html?ref=movies&amp;pagewanted=1 | last = Holden | first = Stephen | title=Animated Ambiguity, Featuring a Big Head |work=[[The New York Times Company]] | date=November 4, 2010 | accessdate=November 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' reviewer [[Owen Gleiberman]] graded the film a B+ and wrote, "...too goofy-surreal to pack a lot of emotional punch, but it's antically light on its feet, with 3-D images that have a lustrous, gizmo-mad sci-fi clarity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20438854,00.html | title=MegaMind Movie Review | last = Glieberman | first = Owen | accessdate=November 5, 2010 | date=November 3, 2010 |work=Entertainment Weekly}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Travers]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' commented, "What this raucous 3D animated fun house lacks in originality (think bastard child of ''The Incredibles'' and ''Despicable Me'') it makes up for in visual and vocal wit."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/reviews/45905/231040 | last = Travers | first = Peter | work=Rolling Stone | publisher=Wenner Media LLC | title=MegaMind Film Review | accessdate=November 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a mixed review, Betsy Sharkey of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote, "Just as Megamind struggles to find his center, at times, so does the film."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-megamind-20101105,0,1617798.story | last = Sharkey | first = Betsy | title=Movie review: 'Megamind' | publisher=Los Angeles Times | date=November 5, 2010 | accessdate=November 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main point of criticism was the unoriginality of the film.

In April 2011, DreamWorks Animation's CEO, [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]], commented that the studio did not have plans to produce future movie genre parodies like ''[[Shark Tale]]'', ''[[Monsters vs. Aliens]]'', and ''Megamind'', saying that these films "all shared an approach and tone and idea of parody, and did not travel well internationally. We don't have anything like that coming on our schedule now."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lieberman|first=David|title=DreamWorks Animation Pins Hopes On ‘Kung Fu Panda 2′ After 1Q Earnings Fall Short|url=http://www.deadline.com/2011/04/dreamworks-pins-hopes-on-kung-fu-panda-2-after-first-quarter-earnings-fall-short/|accessdate=September 17, 2012|newspaper=Deadline|date=April 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Movies Anywhere''' is a United States-exclusive [[Cloud computing|cloud-based]] [[digital locker]] and [[over-the-top content|over-the-top streaming]] platform operated by [[The Walt Disney Company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Prange|first1=Stephanie|title=Movies Anywhere App Launches With Joint Studio Backing|url=https://variety.com/2017/digital/news/movies-anywhere-launches-with-joint-studio-backing-1202587915/|accessdate=October 12, 2017|work=Variety|date=October 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The service allows users to [[Streaming media|stream]] and download purchased films, including [[digital copy|digital copies]] redeemed from codes found in [[home video]] releases as well as digital purchases from participating services. The platform provides content from [[Walt Disney Studios (division)|Walt Disney Studios]], [[Universal Pictures]], [[20th Century Fox]], [[Warner Bros.]] and [[Sony Pictures]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hayes|first1=Dade|title=Four Major Studios Join U.S. Launch Of Disney’s Movies Anywhere Digital Service|url=http://deadline.com/2017/10/four-major-studios-join-disney-movies-anywhere-digital-service-1202186760/|accessdate=October 12, 2017|work=Deadline.com|date=October 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system utilizes an internal platform known as '''KeyChest''', which synchronizes content licenses from digital distribution platforms linked to a central user account.

Movies Anywhere was first launched on February 10, 2014 as '''Disney Movies Anywhere''' (DMA) with content from [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]], [[Pixar]], [[Marvel Studios|Marvel]], and ''[[Star Wars]]''-branded films on [[iOS]] with [[iTunes Store]] integration; the service has since been extended to other platforms and storefronts, including [[Amazon Video]], [[Google Play]], [[Vudu]], [[Fandango_(company)#FandangoNow|FandangoNow]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Spangler|first1=Todd|title=Fandango Joins Disney-Owned Movies Anywhere|url=https://variety.com/2018/digital/news/fandango-movies-anywhere-disney-1202724990/|accessdate=June 17, 2018|work=Variety.com|date=March 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Microsoft Movies &amp; TV]]. On October 12, 2017, DMA was relaunched as Movies Anywhere, with other studios joining Disney in offering their film titles through the platform.

Movies Anywhere is a competitor to the [[UltraViolet (system)|UltraViolet]] platform that was deployed by other major film studios (though the latter is declining as most of those studios move to Movies Anywhere); Disney declined to back the platform, in favor of promoting KeyChest as an alternative.

== History ==
In 2009, Disney unveiled a rights synchronization platform known as KeyChest, which would allow content purchases via digital distribution platforms to be queried and used to build a centralized library. The company explained that this system would allow "persistent" access to purchased content across multiple digital platforms, including television set-top boxes and mobiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.engadget.com/2014/02/25/disney-movies-anywhere/|title=Disney Movies Anywhere service launches with an unprecedented link to iTunes|work=Engadget|access-date=October 12, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.engadget.com/2010/01/10/disneys-keychest-is-not-drm/|title=Disney's KeyChest is not DRM|work=Engadget|access-date=October 12, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://mashable.com/2009/10/21/disney-going-digital/|title=Disney's Going Digital: Buy Once, Watch Anywhere|last=Warren|first=Christina|work=Mashable|access-date=October 12, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dig1"&gt;{{Citation|last=Healey|first=Jon|title=Disney offers KeyChest, but where is the KeyMaster?|date=January 5, 2010|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/technology/2010/01/disney-keychest-drm-dece.html|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=December 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703816204574485650026945222|title=Disney Touts a Way to Ditch the DVD|last=Smith|first=Ethan|website=WSJ|access-date=October 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;.The platform was viewed as being a competitor to [[UltraViolet (system)|UltraViolet]], a competing concept developed by [[Digital Entertainment Content Ecosystem|DECE]], a consortium containing all other [[Major film studio|major U.S. film studios]] but Disney.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Disney Movies Anywhere originally launched on February 10, 2014, as an [[iOS]] app that allows users to link Disney films purchased on [[iTunes Store]] into a unified library with digital copies of Disney films purchased on physical media, so that they can be streamed or downloaded. The integration is achieved by linking a user's [[Apple ID]] with a Disney account. The app also allows users to browse through a catalog of Disney films available on iTunes Store, access supplemental content such as interviews and behind-the-scenes footage, and participate in the Disney Movie Rewards program.&lt;ref name="tc-dma" /&gt; Walt Disney Studios CTO Jamie Voris explained that the app was designed to provide a "rich, interactive experience" around its content as an alternative to "utilitarian" online stores, and that Disney planned to seek additional retail partners for the service in the future.&lt;ref name="tc-dma"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/02/25/disney-movies-anywhere/|title=Disney Launches Disney Movies Anywhere, An iTunes-Integrated App Where Fans Can Build Their Movie Library|last=Ha|first=Anthony|work=TechCrunch|access-date=October 12, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2014, support for [[Google Play Movies &amp; TV]] and [[Vudu]] was added.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2014/digital/news/walmarts-vudu-joins-disney-movies-anywhere-1201356728/|title=Walmart’s Vudu Joins Disney Movies Anywhere|last=Graser|first=Marc|date=November 14, 2014|work=Variety|access-date=October 12, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/11/03/disney-and-google-partner-up-for-disney-movies-anywhere-access-on-google-play/|title=Disney And Google Partner Up For Disney Movies Anywhere Access On Google Play|last=Buhr|first=Sarah|work=TechCrunch|access-date=October 12, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2015, support for [[Amazon Video]] and [[Microsoft Movies &amp; TV]] was added, and DMA apps for [[Android TV]] and [[Roku]] were also released.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/9/8/9276525/disney-movies-anywhere-now-available-amazon-microsoft|title=Disney's fantastic cloud movie locker now works with Amazon, Microsoft video apps|work=The Verge|access-date=October 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2016, [[Verizon Fios]] became the first television provider to integrate with DMA, allowing purchases through Fios On Demand to be synced into DMA libraries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.multichannel.com/news/content/verizon-fios-first-mvpd-connect-disney-movies-anywhere/407221|title=Verizon Fios First MVPD to Connect to Disney Movies Anywhere|website=Multichannel News|language=en|access-date=October 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bizjournals.com/losangeles/news/2016/08/24/verizon-fios-joins-disney-movies-anywhere.html|title= Verizon Fios joins Disney Movies Anywhere platform|website=L.A. Biz|access-date=October 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2017, DMA ceased support for Microsoft Movies &amp; TV, with future purchases no longer automatically accessible through the linked library &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.engadget.com/2017/09/08/disney-movies-anywhere-drops-microsoft/|title=Disney Movies Anywhere drops Microsoft as a partner|work=Engadget|access-date=October 12, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; however in August 2018 support for the service provider was officially restored under Movies Anywhere.

On October 10, 2017, it was reported that the DMA platform would expand to include content from non-Disney studios under the name Movies Anywhere, with [[20th Century Fox]], [[Sony Pictures]], [[Universal Pictures]], and [[Warner Bros.]]  serving as initial partners, and [[Lionsgate]] and [[Paramount Pictures]] expressing interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2017/digital/news/disney-movies-anywhere-adds-fox-wb-universal-report-1202585994/|title=Disney Movies Anywhere Adds Fox, WB, Universal (Report)|last=Gruenwedel|first=Erik|date=October 10, 2017|work=Variety|access-date=October 12, 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It would also include titles from Disney's [[Touchstone Pictures]] and [[Hollywood Pictures]] banners that were previously unavailable on DMA. The DMA platform was relaunched on October 12, 2017. ''[[The Verge]]'' felt that the new platform could be used to replace the commercially-unsuccessful UltraViolet platform (which Disney did not support).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/12/16462824/movies-anywhere-digital-movie-locker-disney-warner-bros-universal-twentieth-century-fox-sony|title=Hollywood studios join Disney to launch Movies Anywhere digital locker service|work=The Verge|access-date=October 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Just two months after launch, at the January 2018 [[Consumer Electronics Show]] in Las Vegas, GM Karin Gilford announced that consumers’ accounts have accumulated nearly 80 million movies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Arnold|first1=Thomas|title=Betting on Movies Anywhere|url=https://www.mediaplaynews.com/betting-on-movies-anywhere/|accessdate=April 27, 2018|work=Media Play News|date=February 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same month, Movies Anywhere was picked the 2018 winner of the inaugural [[Home Media Magazine|Media Play News]] Fast Forward Awards, honoring people, technologies, organizations, products or services that move the home entertainment industry forward.

Support for [[Fandango_(company)#FandangoNOW|FandangoNOW]] was added on March 13, 2018,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=England|first1=Rachel|title=Movies Anywhere includes your FandangoNOW flicks|url=https://www.engadget.com/2018/03/13/movies-anywhere-includes-your-fandangonow-flicks/|work=Engadget|date=March 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; with talks also resuming between Movies Anywhere and Microsoft Movies &amp; TV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Thorp-Lancaster |first1=Dan |title=Microsoft 'in discussions' about joining Movies Anywhere |url=https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft-discussions-about-joining-movies-anywhere |website=Windows Central |publisher=Mobile Nations |accessdate=July 19, 2018 |date=March 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; By then, there were more than 100 million movies in consumer accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.mediaplaynews.com/movies-anywhere-adds-fandangonow/|title=Movies Anywhere Adds FandangoNow|newspaper=Media Play News|publisher=[[JCH Media Inc.]]|accessdate=April 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 6, 2018, it was announced that [[Microsoft Movies &amp; TV]] would be rejoining the Movies Anywhere service. By then, the number of movies in customer accounts had grown to more than 135 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Moon|first1=Tim|title=Microsoft Movies &amp; TV rejoins Movies Anywhere|url=https://www.neowin.net/news/microsoft-movies--tv-rejoins-movies-anywhere|work=Neowin|date=August 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Latchem|first1=John|title=Microsoft Joins Movies Anywhere Platform|url=https://www.mediaplaynews.com/microsoft-joins-movies-anywhere-platform/|newspaper=Media Play News|publisher=[[JCH Media Inc.]]|accessdate=August 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 9, the General Manager of Movies Anywhere announced that the service had 6 million users. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2018/digital/news/movies-anywhere-disney-6-million-app-downloads-1203023433/ |website=Variety}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2210">The notion of '''musical similarity''' is particularly complex because there are numerous dimensions of similarity. If similarity takes place between different fragments from one musical piece, a musical similarity implies a [[repetition (music)|repetition]] of the first occurring fragment. As well, eventually, the similarity does not occur by direct repetition, but by presenting in two (or more) set of relations, some common values or patterns. Objective musical similarity can be based on musical features such as:

Pitched parameters
* [[Pitch (music)|Pitch]] interval similarity
* [[Melody|Melodic]] similarity&lt;ref&gt;Greg Aloupis, Thomas Fevens, [[Stefan Langerman]], Tomomi Matsui, Antonio Mesa, Yurai Nunez, and David Rappaport, and Godfried T. Toussaint, "Algorithms for computing geometric measures of melodic similarity," ''Computer Music Journal'', Vol. 30, No. 3, Fall 2006, pp. 67–76.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Modulation (music)|Modulation]] pattern similarity
* [[Timbre|Timbral]] similarity

Non-pitched parameters
* [[Meter (music)|Metrical]] structure similarity
* [[Rhythm]]ic pattern similarity&lt;ref&gt;Godfried T. Toussaint, "A comparison of rhythmic dissimilarity measures," ''FORMA'', Vol. 21, No. 2, 2006, pp. 129–149.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Section (music)|Section]] structure similarity

Semiotic parameters
* [[Modality (semiotics)|Modality]] structure similarity
* [[Extension (semantics)|Extension]]al similarity
* [[Intension]]al similarity

Nevertheless, similarity can be based also on less objective features such as musical genre, personal history, social context (e.g. music from the 1960s), and a priori knowledge.

==Applications==
Automatic methods of musical similarity detection based on [[data mining]] and [[co-occurrence]] analysis has been developed in order to classify music titles for electronic music distribution.&lt;ref&gt;[[François Pachet]], Geert Westermann, Damien Laigre, [http://www.csl.sony.fr/downloads/papers/2001/pachet01c.pdf Musical Data Mining for Electronic Music Distribution].

'''Peter Eldin''' (born 1939) is a British author and [[Magic (illusion)|magician]]. He has written almost two hundred books; most of them are non-fiction for young people.&lt;ref&gt;Vang, Maikue. Something About the Author.

Detroit, Mich: Gale, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[WorldCat]] there are "132 works in 188 publications in 12 languages and 8,912 library holdings."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eldin, Peter|url=http://www.worldcat.org/wcidentities/viaf-35050257|work=WorldCat|accessdate=12 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He writes mainly on factual material, fun (puzzles, quizzes, jokes, and games) and magic for children, and has also edited magic magazines ''The Magic Circular'' and ''Abracadabra'', and written scripts for TV shows including ''[[The Weakest Link]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"Children's Writer At School", Derby Evening Telegraph, 18 March 2003, p 9 (via Nexis UK)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;T Shaw, "Time for a good book", Telegraph, 20 January 1987 (via Nexis UK).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="daigneault"/&gt;

==Books for children==
He is best known for the series of humorous instructional books for children such as ''The Trickster's Handbook'' (1976), ''The Secret Agent's Handbook'' (1977) and ''The Whizzkid's Handbook'' (1979), full of tricks, games, puzzles, and advice, with illustrations by Roger Smith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Peter Eldin Biography at JRank|url=http://biography.jrank.org/pages/918/Eldin-Peter-1939.html|accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following gives a brief flavour of these works: "tell your friends you can kiss a book 'inside and outside' without opening it - then prove it by kissing the book while standing outdoors ... and then indoors. Something semiserious? Baffle your buddies with vanishing water or instant indoor rainbows."&lt;ref&gt;W E Butterworth IV, "Books for all topics", ''[[Boys' Life]]'', November 1991, p16&lt;/ref&gt; The series was adapted for television in 1980 as ''The Whizzkids Guide'' starring [[Kenneth Williams]], [[Rita Webb]] and [[Arthur Mullard]] as overgrown schoolchildren.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Whizzkids Guide|url=http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/397106|work=Film &amp; TV Database|publisher=British Film Database|accessdate=12 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Whizzkid's Guide|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081962/|work=IMDb|accessdate=12 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Stevens ''Kenneth Williams: Born Brilliant'', Hachette UK, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Williams said "the script is full of corny gags which actually make me laugh".&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Williams, ''The Kenneth Williams Diaries'', ed Russell Davies, HarperCollins UK, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

School Library Journal called ''The Magic Handbook'' "an excellent standard source for magical tricks and advice for most children's library collections for many years to come."&lt;ref&gt;Craighton Hippenhammer, "Review: The Magic Handbook (Book)". School Library Journal; Aug86, Vol. 32 Issue 10, p91.&lt;/ref&gt; His book ''Magic'' (1998) has also received praise as an informative history of magic.&lt;ref name=daigneault&gt;Daigneault, Audrey I., "Reference books &amp; nonfiction series", Library Talk, 1043237X, Mar/Apr98, Vol. 11, Issue 2.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Spookster's Handbook'' (CIP Sterling, 1989) is "an entertaining little gem that's chock-full of zany ideas for Halloween", including haunted house ideas, optical illusions, tricks, and riddles, aimed at kids, parents, teachers, and group leaders.&lt;ref&gt;Chamberlin, Leslie, "Review: The Spookster's Handbook (Book)". School Library Journal; Mar90, Vol. 36 Issue 3, p226&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Professor Layton and the Last Specter''''',{{efn|Known in Japan as {{nihongo|'''''Reiton-kyōju to Majin no Fue'''''|レイトン教授と魔神の笛|lit. ''Professor Layton and the Specter's Flute''}}&lt;!-- See [[WP:JFN]] --&gt;}} known in Europe as '''''Professor Layton and the Spectre's Call''''', is a [[Puzzle video game|puzzle]] [[Adventure game|adventure]] video game produced by [[Level-5 (company)|Level-5]] for the [[Nintendo DS]] [[handheld game console]]. ''Last Specter'' is the fourth game in the [[Professor Layton|''Professor Layton'' series]], and is a prequel that takes place three years before the first trilogy, detailing how [[Professor Hershel Layton|Professor Layton]] met his apprentice, [[List of Professor Layton characters#Luke Triton|Luke Triton]] and introducing Layton's assistant [[List of Professor Layton characters#Emmy Altava|Emmy Altava]].

''Professor Layton and the Last Specter'' also includes an additional [[role-playing game]] entitled ''Professor Layton's London Life'', available from the start of the game. ''London Life'', in which players interact with various characters from the series in a town called "Little London", was advertised as having over 100 hours of content. ''London Life'' was removed from the European versions of the game because the translation of texts would have significantly delayed the game's release.

The game was released during 2009 in Japan, and was the highest-selling game there during the week of its release. It saw release in [[North American]] and [[PAL region]]s during 2011.

==Gameplay==
''Professor Layton and the Last Specter'' is a puzzle game presented in the style of an adventure game. The player controls the actions of a group of three protagonists as they move about a village called Misthallery: Professor Hershel Layton, his assistant [[List of Professor Layton characters#Emmy Altava|Emmy Altava]], and a young boy named Luke Triton. While in the village, the three of them are presented with several mysteries that are solved as the plot progresses. Misthallery is divided into several sections, although many require the plot to progress to a certain point before they can be accessed. In order to move about Misthallery, players tap a shoe-shaped [[computer icon|icon]] on the bottom-right corner of the [[touch screen]], and then the arrow representing the direction of the path they wish to take.&lt;ref name="lsmanualp11"&gt;{{cite book | title = Professor Layton and the Last Specter Instruction Booklet | section = Exploring | publisher = [[Nintendo of America]] | date = October 17, 2011 | quote = First, tap the shoe icon. Then tap an arrow or a hand icon to move. |page = 11}}&lt;/ref&gt; While in Misthallery, the player is capable of tapping anywhere on the bottom screen of the Nintendo DS system to investigate objects and reveal bits of dialogue, hint coins, collectible items, or hidden puzzles.&lt;ref name="ignreviewls"&gt;{{cite web | last = Drake | first = Audrey | url = http://www.ign.com/articles/2011/10/18/professor-layton-and-the-last-specter-review | title = Professor Layton and the Last Specter Review | publisher = [[IGN]] | date = October 17, 2011 | accessdate = April 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, if a [[non-player character]] is visible on the screen, they can be tapped to initiate a conversation.&lt;ref name="lsmanualp12"&gt;{{cite book | title = Professor Layton and the Last Specter Instruction Booklet | section = Talking to People | publisher = Nintendo of America | date = October 17, 2011 | quote = Tap a character on the Touch Screen to interact with him/her. |page = 12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Puzzles===
[[File:Last Specter Puzzle.png|thumb|right|180px|Puzzle [[interface (computing)|interface]] in ''Professor Layton and the Last Specter''. The puzzle is solved via input from the bottom touch screen, while instructions are provided on the top.]]Initiating a conversation or investigating an object in the main game will often lead to the player being asked to solve a puzzle.&lt;ref name="lsmanualp13b"&gt;{{cite book | title = Professor Layton and the Last Specter Instruction Booklet | section = Solving Puzzles | publisher = Nintendo of America | date = October 17, 2011| quote = It will be important to solve as many puzzles as possible in order to progress through the story! Talk to people and search the surrounding area for puzzles. |page = 13}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the plot progresses to a point at which a puzzle can no longer be accessed, it will be retrieved by a character named Keats the Cat for later solving.&lt;ref name="noegameplay"/&gt;  There are over 170 puzzles in the game,&lt;ref name="noewhatsnew"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nintendo.co.uk/NOE/en_GB/games/ms/plsc/whatsnew.html | title = Professor Layton and the Spectre's Call – What's New | publisher = Nintendo of Europe | work = Professor Layton and the Spectre's Call – Official Website | archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/639JCjpHl?url=http://www.nintendo.co.uk/NOE/en_GB/games/ms/plsc/whatsnew.html | archivedate = November 12, 2011 | deadurl = yes| accessdate = November 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[brain teaser]]s, [[sliding puzzle]]s, [[logic puzzle]]s, [[peg solitaire]], and several other varieties. When a puzzle begins, the player is briefly presented with the puzzle's name, number, and value in "Picarats", the game's system of [[Score (game)#Video games|point]]s as well as an estimation of the puzzle's difficulty.&lt;ref name="noegameplay"/&gt; These points are not used during the main game, but if a player collects enough of these Picarats, they gain access to bonuses accessible from the main menu.&lt;ref name="noegameplay"/&gt;

After this first screen, players are taken the main puzzle solving interface, which provides instructions for the current puzzle on the top screen while allowing the player to interact directly with the touch screen in order to solve the puzzle. The player has an infinite amount of time to complete each puzzle, and they have access to an in-game [[Notebook|memo pad]] function to aid them in solving each puzzle. If they do not wish to solve the puzzle at the time, they can hit the button labelled "Quit" in order to exit the interface without losing any Picarats.&lt;ref name="noegameplay"/&gt; Additionally, all puzzles have three hints available that can be purchased with tokens called "hint coins". If a player needs more help, they can also purchase a fourth "super hint", a more detailed hint that costs two hint coins.&lt;ref name="noeparents"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lsmanualp14a"&gt;{{cite book | title = Professor Layton and the Last Specter Instruction Booklet| section = Solving Puzzles | publisher = Nintendo of America | date = October 17, 2011 | quote = There are four hints for each puzzle. The first three hints cost one coin each, but the Super Hint costs two hint coins. There are a limited number of hint coins in the game, so use them sparingly! |page = 14}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are a limited amount of hint coins, and the game recommends they be used wisely.&lt;ref name="lsmanualp14a"/&gt;  The player starts with ten hint coins, but more can be obtained by thorough investigation of the village.&lt;ref name="lsgameprorev"&gt;{{cite web | last = Haywald | first = Justin | url = http://www.gamepro.com/article/reviews/224025/review-professor-layton-and-the-last-specter-ds | title = Review: Professor Layton and the Last Specter (DS) | publisher = ''[[GamePro]]'' | date = October 18, 2011 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111020192500/http://www.gamepro.com/article/reviews/224025/review-professor-layton-and-the-last-specter-ds | archivedate = October 20, 2011 | deadurl = yes | accessdate = April 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to solve a puzzle, the player must input an answer on the bottom screen. Sometimes, this will involve tapping a button labelled "Input Answer" and writing a word or number that solves the given puzzle. Other times, they might be asked to circle an answer or tap an area on the touch screen, and then hit "Submit". Still others are solved automatically once the player finds the solution by interacting with objects on the bottom screen.&lt;ref name="lsmanualp14b"&gt;{{cite book | title = Professor Layton and the Last Specter Instruction Booklet | section = Solving Puzzles | publisher = Nintendo of America | date = October 17, 2011 | quote = Some puzzles will end automatically when you've arrived at the right answer, and others require you to submit your answer manually. |page = 14}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the player has made a mistake in solving a puzzle, they can hit the button labelled "Restart" to reset the puzzle. Deducted Picarats and purchased hints are not reset if a puzzle is restarted. If the player submits an incorrect answer, they will be asked to repeat the puzzle, and a varying amount of Picarats will be deducted from the maximum possible for that puzzle.&lt;ref name="ignreviewls"/&gt; If the player submits a correct answer, they are rewarded with the amount of Picarats the puzzle is worth,&lt;ref name="noegameplay"/&gt; and the plot will progress.&lt;ref name="lsmanualp13b"/&gt; After completing a puzzle, it can be played again at any time from the Puzzle Index, a section in the game's interface that lists the puzzles a player has completed.&lt;ref name="noegameplay"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nintendo.co.uk/NOE/en_GB/games/ms/plsc/gameplay.html | title = Professor Layton and the Spectre's Call – Gameplay | publisher = Nintendo of Europe | work = Professor Layton and the Spectre's Call – Official Website | archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/639IK3xFH?url=http://www.nintendo.co.uk/NOE/en_GB/games/ms/plsc/gameplay.html | archivedate = November 12, 2011 | deadurl = yes | accessdate = November 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Occasionally, after completing a puzzle, the player will receive small items that can be used in [[minigame]]s. Fulfilling certain criteria, such as clearing all levels in a minigame, unlock additional puzzles in the Bonuses section.

Players are also capable of connecting to [[Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection]] in order to [[Downloadable content|download]] additional puzzles in the "Bonuses" mode, which can be selected from the game's title screen. These puzzles to be are made available each week following the game's release.&lt;ref name="noegameplay"/&gt; Hints for these puzzles could not be purchased with hint coins, but they were provided freely one week after the puzzle was made available, for 33 weeks.&lt;ref name="lsmanualp25"&gt;{{cite book | title = Professor Layton and the Last Specter Instruction Booklet | section = Weekly Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection Puzzles | publisher = Nintendo of America | date = October 17, 2011 | quote = When available, hints will be provided for downloaded puzzles one week after their release. The first time you connect and download puzzles from Nintendo WFC, all currently available puzzles and hints will be downloaded. |page = 25}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 34th puzzle was produced but never issued.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} When a player connected to Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, all puzzles and hints would be downloaded.&lt;ref name="lsmanualp25"/&gt; After May 20, 2014, it's no longer possible to download the additional content, as the [[Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection]] service was terminated on that date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Support/Nintendo-DSi-XL-/Basic-setup-and-use/Termination-of-Nintendo-Wi-Fi-Connection/Titles-with-additional-downloadable-content/Titles-with-additional-downloadable-content-864190.html | title = Titles with additional downloadable content | publisher = [[Nintendo]] | accessdate = May 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Minigames===
''Professor Layton and the Last Specter'' also features several small minigames that are playable in the main game, available by selecting them from the Professor's Suitcase located in the top-right corner of the bottom screen while moving about the town. In order to play these minigames, the plot must have progressed far enough to have [[unlockable (gaming)|unlocked]] each of them, and more difficult levels require the completion of puzzles in the main game.&lt;ref name="eurogamerlsrev"&gt;{{cite web | last = Teti | first = John | url = http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-10-21-professor-layton-and-the-last-specter-review | title=Professor Layton and the Last Specter | publisher = [[Eurogamer]] | date = October 21, 2011 | accessdate = October 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Toy Train''' minigame involves laying a [[railroad track]] across a complex game board. The toy train must pass through every train station and reach a defined end point, and in harder levels, it must be timed to avoid cars and other trains.&lt;ref name="wiredmajinnofue"&gt;{{cite web | last = Kohler | first = Chris | url = https://www.wired.com/2009/11/professor-layton/ | title = What's New In Professor Layton's Fourth Outing | publisher = ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' | date = November 30, 2009 | accessdate = April 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The toy train requires [[fuel]] to move, limiting the amount of track that can be placed by a player unless more fuel is collected before a track ends.&lt;ref name="wiredmajinnofue"/&gt;

The '''Fish''' minigame involves manipulating a fish to collect every coin in its tank. The fish moves in a straight diagonal line, and the player can alter this line by placing bubbles at certain marked points, [[reflection (physics)|reflect]]ing it in a different direction.&lt;ref name="noewhatsnew"/&gt; In the Japanese version of ''Last Specter'', the Fish minigame is instead based on trying to create words by feeding them to fish, who alter them in specific patterns.&lt;ref name="wiredmajinnofue"/&gt;

In the '''Puppet Theater''' minigame, the player is tasked with finishing the script of an ongoing play so that it makes sense.&lt;ref name="wiredmajinnofue"/&gt; If the player chooses a word that does not make sense in the context of the play, the play abruptly ends and the player is asked to try again; if all of the right words are chosen, the play is given an [[epilogue]] and an audience applauds.

After progressing far enough into the story, the player can tap mice across Misthallery to earn "mouse badges" and gain access to another minigame, entitled '''Mouse Alley'''.&lt;ref name="noewhatsnew"/&gt;&lt;ref name="grevreview"&gt;{{cite web | last = Tan | first = Nick | url = http://www.gamerevolution.com/review/professor-layton-and-the-last-spectre | title=Professor Layton and the Last Specter Review | publisher = [[Game Revolution]] | date = October 10, 2011 | accessdate = October 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the other minigames, this is accessed through a character in Misthallery and not through the Trunk.  The goal of the minigame is to tap as many mice as possible within the time limit, while avoiding tapping Luke's mouse, Toppy, by mistake.  This is the only real-time element in the game.

== Plot ==

===Setting===
''Professor Layton and the Last Specter'' takes place three years before the events of ''Professor Layton and the Curious Village'' in a fictional English village known as Misthallery.&lt;ref name="l5iapr"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://level5ia.com/news/professor-layton-and-the-last-specter-is-in-stores-now/ | title=Professor Layton and the Last Specter is in Stores Now! | publisher = Level-5 International America | date = October 17, 2011 | accessdate = November 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Misthallery, citizens have long spoken of legends of a [[Ghost|specter]] who rose from the mist to defend the village whenever the Specter's Flute was played. Lately, a monster who is believed by the town's population to be this specter has been attacking the village during the middle of the night, destroying homes and buildings.&lt;ref name="l5iapr"/&gt;

Misthallery is a watery town in which traveling via [[gondola]] to move about the town's [[canal]]s is commonplace.&lt;ref name="limbsofthetown"&gt;{{cite video game | title = Professor Layton and the Last Specter | developer = [[Level-5 (company)|Level-5]] | publisher = Nintendo | date = October 17, 2011 | platform = [[Nintendo DS]] | version = 1.0 | scene = Layton's Journal | level = The Limbs of the Town | quote = The canals that wind through Misthallery are not just for show. They are also a useful means of transportation for the inhabitants, which is evident from the number of piers and small boats moored about town.}}&lt;/ref&gt; By these canals, the town is divided into five distinct regions: the Crossroads, the Market, the East District, Ely Street, and Highyard Hill. The Crossroads contain the library as well as the home of the mayor, Clark Triton. The town market is a shady place controlled by a mysterious entity known as the Black Raven,&lt;ref name="theblackravens"&gt;{{cite video game | title = Professor Layton and the Last Specter | developer = Level-5 | publisher = Nintendo | date = October 17, 2011 | platform = Nintendo DS | version = 1.0 | scene = Layton's Journal | level = The Black Ravens | quote = When we arrived at the auction all, the Black Raven himself was waiting for us. At first glance, it is hard to tell who or what this Black Raven is, but it is clear to me that he is simply made up of a group of children, albeit remarkably clever children.

===Story===
[[File:Last Specter Cutscene.png|thumb|right|A still from one of the animated cutscenes within ''Professor Layton and the Last Specter''.]]
As the story begins, a woman named Emmy Altava is hired to be Professor Layton's assistant at the fictional Gressenheller University. Upon her introduction to him, he reveals that he is currently heading towards a town named Misthallery. According to a letter allegedly sent by his close friend, Clark Triton, a specter is attacking the village at night. As the pair reach Clark's house, though, they find that the letter was sent not by Clark, but by his son, Luke, who has learned how to predict the specter's attacks and wished to enlist Layton's help in putting an end to them.&lt;ref name="noegallery"/&gt; Luke sneaks out of his house to join Layton and Emmy's investigation. After they finish exploring Misthallery for the day, they go to spend the night at a local hotel. As they look out from the window in their room, they hear the sound of a flute and see a large, shadowy figure emerge from the [[mist]], which proceeds to forge a path of destruction through the town, including their hotel room, before vanishing without a trace.

The next day, Layton, Luke, and Emmy set off to find the town's [[black market]] in order to discover information about the Specter's Flute, an artifact which is said grant those who play it control over the specter. After winning the trust of the Black Raven, a group of children who run the market,&lt;ref name="theblackravens"/&gt; Layton learns that the flute was auctioned to the now-deceased Evan Barde, once the richest man in Misthallery, soon before the specter started attacking the town. The three then head to Barde Manor to visit his daughter, Arianna, a girl who was once close friends with Luke, but is now suffering from a [[terminal illness]] and is believed by the townspeople to be a witch.&lt;ref name="thegirlwhowascalledawitch"/&gt;

Arianna refuses to talk to anyone, however, so Layton and Luke continue to question the townspeople while Emmy goes to the [[Scotland Yard]] for information regarding Evan Barde's death. With the aid of Inspectors Chelmey and Grosky, she uncovers the records for the case before heading back to Misthallery to reunite with Layton and Luke.&lt;ref name="foundthedocuments"&gt;{{cite video game | title = Professor Layton and the Last Specter | developer = Level-5 | publisher = Nintendo | date = October 17, 2011 | platform = Nintendo DS | version = 1.0 | scene = Layton's Journal | level = Found the Documents! | quote = With some extra help from Inspector Chelmey, we managed to find the reports we were looking for. I also got my photographs developed, so I'm all set to go back to Misthallery. I might have accidentally picked up Inspector Grosky too...}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inspector Grosky returns with her, hoping that his own influence will help convince the town's [[Chief of Police]], Chief Jakes, to provide further information on the case. Regardless, Chief Jakes remains adamantly opposed to the investigation of Barde's death, and demands that Layton and company leave the town within 24 hours.&lt;ref name="wegettheblame"&gt;{{cite video game | title = Professor Layton and the Last Specter | developer = Level-5 | publisher = Nintendo | date = October 17, 2011 | platform = Nintendo DS | version = 1.0 | scene = Layton's Journal | level = We Get the Blame? | quote = We managed to witness the specter again, but as we set off after it, we were caught by Jakes and his men and forcibly taken to the police station. Does Jakes really think that we were behind all this? I very much doubt it. No, I believe there is something that Jakes doesn't want us to uncover...}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Jakes' threats, they visit Arianna to explain to her what has happened to the town and to her father. Arianna opens up to them, and proceeds to guide them to the nearby lake before playing the Specter's Flute, which causes a prehistoric aquatic creature named Loosha to rise from the lake.

Chief Jakes then appears at the lake, revealing that he had followed the Professor, and takes Arianna and Loosha into [[police custody]], claiming them to be behind the specter attacks. In his absence, the trio manage to find the real "specter" at an abandoned factory within the town.&lt;ref name="totheoldfactory"/&gt; As Arianna and Loosha are being formally accused in front of the townspeople, Layton appears and exposes the true identity of the specter: an [[excavation (archaeology)|excavation]] machine destroying the town in search of the "Golden Garden", ancient ruins believed to be beneath Misthallery.&lt;ref name="noegallery"/&gt; He goes on to describe Chief Jakes' scheme to become mayor of the town and his accomplice: a man disguised as Clark's butler, Doland Noble, named Jean Descole, a scientist looking for the Golden Garden who had held hostage Clark's wife along with his real butler.&lt;ref name="emmytotherescue"&gt;{{cite video game | title = Professor Layton and the Last Specter | developer = Level-5 | publisher = Nintendo | date = October 17, 2011 | platform = Nintendo DS | version = 1.0| scene = Art | level = Emmy to the Rescue | quote = Emmy helps the real Doland and Clark's wife, Brenda, escape from the cellar. What a relief to find them alive and well!}}&lt;/ref&gt; With Descole's plan revealed, he combines his machines into a giant [[mecha]] in a final attempt to level the town in search of the Golden Garden.

With the combined efforts of Layton, Luke, Emmy, Loosha, and the Black Ravens, the mecha is eventually defeated and Descole is forced to retreat. Despite Loosha having been fatally wounded during the fight, she proceeds to destroy the floodgates of the town's dam, drying the lake and revealing the entrance to the Golden Garden.&lt;ref name="paradisefound"&gt;{{cite video game | title = Professor Layton and the Last Specter | developer = Level-5 | publisher = Nintendo | date = October 17, 2011 | platform = Nintendo DS | version = 1.0 | scene = Layton's Journal | level = Paradise Found | quote = Though the struggle was over and the town saved, the badly wounded Loosha fought on to knock down the last floodgates, draining the lake of water and revealing a hidden door. When we solved the puzzle and opened the door, before us lay a paradise of lush greenery, an entire ecosystem... We had found the Golden Garden. Loosha had used the last of her strength to find a cure for Arianna.}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the group enter the garden, Loosha dies, and Arianna learns of Loosha's true intentions. Loosha knew that the clean environment of the garden would help Arianna recover from her disease, and fought the specter to ensure the garden would survive long enough to cure her.&lt;ref name="paradisefound"/&gt; She fully recovers from her illness a year later, and the Golden Garden's discovery is then made public, marking the beginning of Layton's fame in the field of archaeology.

As Luke leaves the garden, he realizes he still has much to learn about the world, and asks to become Layton's apprentice. Layton obliges, and the game ends with Luke bidding farewell to the people of Misthallery before beginning his journeys with Layton. In a final scene, Jean Descole is seen on a cart, preparing his next plan.

==''Professor Layton's London Life''==
[[File:London Life Title.png|thumb|right|200px|Gameplay from ''London Life''. Players perform errands for various characters from the ''Professor Layton'' series.]]

==Development and release==

===Development===
Every puzzle in ''Last Specter'' was created by [[Akira Tago]], a Japanese professor and author of the Atama no Taisō series of puzzle books, which has sold more than 12 million copies within Japan.&lt;ref name="noeparents"&gt;[https://www.nintendo.co.uk/NOE/en_GB/games/ms/plsc/parentsfaq.html]{{Dead link|date=April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was produced by Level-5 CEO [[Akihiro Hino]], and designed around the concept of {{nihongo|"''Nazotoki × Deai no Monogatari''"|「ナゾトキ×出会いの物語」||Lit. "Puzzle-solving and the Story of the Encounter"}}, detailing how Professor Layton met his apprentice, Luke.&lt;ref name="laytonjp"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.layton.jp/majin/index.html | script-title = ja:レイトン教授シリーズ | language = Japanese | publisher = Level-5 | accessdate = December 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Professor Layton'' series was envisioned as a trilogy, to be completed with the release of the third game, ''[[Professor Layton and the Unwound Future]]''.&lt;ref name="1uplasttimetravel"&gt;{{cite web | last = Sato | first = Yoshi | url = http://www.1up.com/news/final-professor-layton-game-announced | title = Third (Final!)

''Professor Layton and the Last Specter'' received "favorable" reviews according to video game [[review aggregator]] [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref name="metacriticls"/&gt; Many critics noted that although the game feels similar to past titles, the series had found a working formula and did not need to change.&lt;ref name="1upreview"&gt;{{cite web | last = Parish | first = Jeremy | url = http://www.1up.com/reviews/professor-layton-last-specter-nintendo-ds | title = Review: Professor Layton and the Last Specter is an Awful Lot of Game | publisher = [[1UP.com]] | date = October 17, 2011 | accessdate = October 17, 2011 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111223200602/http://www.1up.com/reviews/professor-layton-last-specter-nintendo-ds | archivedate = December 23, 2011 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lsgameprorev"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lsgradarreview"&gt;{{cite web | last = Gudmundson | first = Carolyn | url = http://www.gamesradar.com/professor-layton-and-last-specter-review/ | title = Professor Layton and the Last Specter review | publisher = [[GamesRadar]] | date = October 17, 2011 | accessdate = October 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[IGN]] shared these sentiments, but found that the game had "an added attention to detail that makes the whole game feel a bit sharper and more magnificent" than its predecessors.&lt;ref name="ignreviewls"/&gt; The game's puzzles received mixed reception. Reviewers often commented that they felt too similar to puzzles from the other games in the series,&lt;ref name="ignreviewls"/&gt;&lt;ref name="eurogamerlsrev"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lsgradarreview"/&gt; and several felt that they tended to be vague&lt;ref name="1upreview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lsgameprorev"/&gt; or inconsistent in difficulty.&lt;ref name="1upreview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="grevreview"/&gt; Despite this, ''[[GamePro]]'' felt that the game's puzzles were "more balanced" than those from previous games.&lt;ref name="lsgameprorev"/&gt; The game's cutscenes and visuals were very well received, with [[GamesRadar]] describing the cutscenes as "near-[[Studio Ghibli|Ghibli]] quality"&lt;ref name="lsgradarreview"/&gt; and IGN saying that "the graphics, which make use of a cartoony yet beautifully detailed, painterly art style, are simply gorgeous."&lt;ref name="ignreviewls"/&gt;

''Professor Layton's London Life'' was also viewed as a worthwhile extension to the game, with [[1UP.com]] stating that the main game was "almost a side diversion" in comparison.&lt;ref name="1upreview"/&gt; Critics often compared the gameplay to the popular ''[[Animal Crossing]]'' franchise.&lt;ref name="lsgameprorev"/&gt;&lt;ref name="eurogamerlsrev"/&gt;&lt;ref name="grevreview"/&gt; Response to the game was mixed. IGN felt it "surprising the game was included as a mere bonus"&lt;ref name="ignreviewls"/&gt; and GamePro praised the dialogue, calling it "clever and genuinely funny in ways that few other games are."&lt;ref name="lsgameprorev"/&gt; However, [[Game Revolution]] said that the game soon "becomes a chore" to play,&lt;ref name="grevreview"/&gt; and some reviewers were unhappy with the decision to remove the game from European versions of ''Professor Layton and the Last Specter''.&lt;ref name="eurogamerlsrev"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lsgradarreview"/&gt;

''[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]]'' gave ''Last Specter'' a score of four-and-a-half stars out of five, saying, "Another Professor Layton game, another bit of puzzling brilliance. Some of the brain teasers feel a bit recycled - instead of foxes and chickens, you're shuttling dogs and cats across the river, for example - but there's more than enough variety to warrant doggedly tracking down every last one. But if you only solve the ones you need to move the story forward, that's ok, too."&lt;ref name="escapistrev"/&gt; ''[[The Guardian]]'' gave it four stars out of five, saying, "If you've not been a fan of the series, this isn't the game that's going to change your mind. For everybody else though, ''Professor Layton &amp; The Spectre's Call'' is several days of commute-improving, grey cell stimulation in a mostly effective package.  And bravo to Nintendo for keeping this franchise on the standard DS rather than – for the time being, at least – adding that third dimension."&lt;ref name="guardianrev"&gt;{{cite news | last = Davey | first = Neil | url = https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2011/nov/23/professor-layton-spectres-call-review | title = Professor Layton &amp; The Spectre's Call - review | newspaper = [[The Guardian]] | date = November 23, 2011 | accessdate = April 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' gave it two-and-a-half stars out of five, saying, "The Layton charm is undoubtedly still present, but it's not enough to carry the series by itself. Upon solving certain puzzles, Layton exclaims 'I love the thrill of a good solution'. So do we, Hershel, so do we. And in this Layton game, sadly, that thrill is all too rare."&lt;ref name="telegraphrev"/&gt;

[[File:Jaojoby concert.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Salegy artist Jaojoby performing in Paris]]
'''Salegy''' {{IPA-mg|ˈsaleɡʲ|}} is a popular music genre from [[Madagascar]]. Originating as a [[List of Sub-Saharan African folk music traditions|Sub-Saharan African folk music]] style in the northwestern coastal areas of Madagascar, modern salegy is the genre of [[Music of Madagascar|Malagasy music]] that has gained the widest recognition and commercial popularity in the international market. Its sound is considered emblematic of the island.&lt;ref name="afropop"/&gt; [[Eusèbe Jaojoby]], a [[Sakalava people |Sakalava]] singer from [[Antsiranana]], was a key originator of the style and is widely considered the "King of Salegy".&lt;ref name=rfimusique&gt;{{cite web | last = Radio France International (RFI) | title = Jaojoby  | publisher = rfimusique.com | date = September 2008 | url = http://www.rfimusique.com/siteEn/biographie/biographie_6279.asp |archiveurl =  https://www.webcitation.org/62cbnGHP4 |archivedate = October 20, 2011 | accessdate = December 16, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;       

The contemporary, electrified form of popular salegy originated from traditional acoustic roots in northwestern Madagascar around [[Mahajanga]] and [[Antsiranana]] in the 1950s.&lt;ref name="Randrianary"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Randrianary | first = Victor | title = Madagascar: les chants d'une île | publisher = Actes Sud | year = 2001 | isbn =  978-2-7427-3556-3 | language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been popularized by originators like [[Eusèbe Jaojoby|Jaojoby]] and relative newcomers such as [[Ninie Doniah]], [[Vaiavy Chila]] and [[Dr. J.B. and the Jaguars]]. The style is [[funk]]y and energetic, dominated by ringing [[electric guitar]]s, real or synthesized [[accordion]], and [[Call and response (music)|call-and-response]] [[Polyphony|polyphonic vocals]], propelled by heavy [[electric bass]] and a driving [[percussion]] section typically including a [[drum kit]], [[djembe]] and [[Shaker (percussion)|shakers]].&lt;ref name="afropop"&gt;{{cite web | last = Eyre | first = Banning | title = Salegy | publisher = Afropop.com | url = http://www.afropop.org/explore/style_info/ID/28/salegy/ |archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/62ccCkUAj | archivedate = October 20, 2011| accessdate = October 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The syncopated, [[polyrhythm]]ic beat of salegy is rapid (typically around 290BPM) and features a distinctive percussion pattern performed on a Western drum kit in [[6/8 time|{{music|time|6|8}}]] or {{music|time|12|4}} time with accents on the 3rd or 7th beat. The melody and harmonies are often in the A minor key and feature beautiful high-life electric guitar and synthesized accordion lines. The sound of salegy can be heard at night clubs, cabarets, parties and dance floors across the island.

Salegy represents an electrified version of the ''antsa'' musical style that was traditionally performed at [[Betsimisaraka people|Betsimisaraka]] and [[Tsimihety people|Tsimihety]] rituals.&lt;ref name="Anderson, I. 2000 pp. 523"&gt;{{Citation | last = Anderson | first = Ian | title = The Rough Guide to World Music, Vol. 1: Africa, Europe and the Middle East | publisher = Rough Guides | year = 2000 | chapter =Ocean Music from Southeast Africa | pages =523–532 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=gyiTOcnb2yYC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | accessdate = November 17, 2010 | isbn =  978-1-84353-551-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to their commonalities in tempo, vocal style, and tendency toward [[minor key]]s (which some attribute to an [[Arab]] influence, and which stands in contrast to the [[major key]] dominance of Highland music), the salegy shares the antsa's structure in that it always features a middle section called the ''folaka'' ("broken") which is primarily instrumental—voice serves only to urge on more energetic dancing—and during which the vocalists (and the audience) will launch into intricate polyrhythmic [[Clapping|hand-clapping]] to the beat of the music.&lt;ref name="Randrianary"/&gt;

'''Self-working [[Magic (illusion)|magic]]''' is [[stage magic|magic]] that works simply from following a procedure that is known to the audience. It requires no secret set-up, trickery, [[sleight-of-hand]], or other hidden objects or moves. Some self-working magic allows the audience to have a secret that they do not reveal to the magician until the end. The audience can be told every step, and can even repeat the trick. It can be done alone, since the "magician" may be just as surprised as anybody. All the magician has to do is follow a certain procedure, and everything will be good. [[Optical illusion]]s and some other science demonstrations could fall into this category. The wonder comes from unexpectedness of a natural phenomenon. Basically, self-working magic relies on some expectation or lack of knowledge in the audience about what produces the outcome. Usually, self-working [[card trick]]s revolve around some mathematical principle, such as in the trick "Magical 13", where the spectator is asked to cut the deck 13 times, then split the deck into 13 piles. Upon revealing each pile, it is found that each pile contains only cards of the same value (i.e., one pile has all four fours, the other pile has all four twos, etc.). This is based on the principle that beforehand, the deck is set up with all the suits in order. No matter how many times you cut the deck, the same cards will always be 13 cards away from each other.

==Example==
Self-working magic tricks can be baffling in a special way. The [[patter]] can take different forms that make them more entertaining. One variation of patter is to say that you are hiding nothing, and explaining every step of the trick. Some audience members may still think it is a trick. Another variation, possibly with some tricks, is to say, "I will not be doing the magic, here: you will". Another way of doing it is to make a story that explains—gives a reason to—each step, so that no step is hidden, and the audience can even DO the steps, but the audience members are baffled, anyway.

Story: Make a story of cutting the deck 7 times. 7 drunken sailors decide to play a high-stakes poker game with a new deck of cards. (Use a new deck that is ordered correctly for this game, all cards in order in every suit, not backwards order as some decks have, or have the audience put the cards in order to simulate a new deck). Then say, none of them are in a state of mind to shuffle, so they decide to cut the deck 7 times, one time each. The dealer deals but forgets his own 2nd and 4th cards, so he ends up with 3 cards. He asks for 2 more, but the other sailors refuse, arguing, but none of them want to start the round over. They finally agree to let him get 5 new cards. They make their bets, and each sailor bets high, giving up everything he owns. The dealer bets last, and accepts all the bets. Everybody is all in. Finally, they reveal their cards, the dealer revealing last. Every drunken sailor has a full house. But the dealer rarely loses the hand, having usually a straight flush, and sometimes a royal straight flush. Every step of the trick has been told directly to the audience, but they are still amazed.

No magic, here. Say, "No magic, here. You will tell me which cards you picked." Ask the audience to pick 3 cards, not show them to you, and write them down. Make a pile of 10 cards, a pile of 15, another pile of 15, and a pile of 9, in order (no Jokers in the deck). Ask the audience to place the first card face down on the first deck. Then, take any number of cards from the 2nd deck and place them on the 1st. Put the 2nd card on top of the 2nd deck, and put any number of cards from the 3rd deck onto the 2nd deck. Put the 3rd card on top of the 3rd deck. Now, you put the 4th pile on the 3rd, both on the 2nd, and all 3 on the 1st. You have one deck. Take 4 cards from the top and put them on the bottom. You can tell the audience every step you are doing. Now, you can get 0 points to 3 points. I will go thru the deck, and you grab your cards if you see them. If you grab all 3 by the end, you get 3 points, if you grab 1, you get one point, and so on.

Now, put the 1st card face up, the 2nd face down. They will find no cards. Say that is OK, we will keep going. Pick up the face-down deck and keep going. Do it again, and again. They will never see their card. Stop when only 3 cards are left. And say, gee—only 3 cards left. Turn them over, and there are their 3 cards. It works every single time. Sometimes, you can arrange it so that they do not know that they had to memorize the cards after writing them down. They may pick the wrong cards. Show them that they picked the wrong cards by looking at their paper. They will think the trick is over. Then, reveal the correct 3 cards.

==Popular types==
1. Steps of math operations that use some secret knowledge of the audience like their birthday, and then reveal that secret knowledge in an unexpected way at the end. For example, think of any secret 3-digit number, multiply it by one specific number, and then another, and it always comes out a 6-digit number with the original 3
-digit number repeated twice.

2. Another one asks the audience to think of words that start with certain letters, and then words linked to the last letters of those words, asking the audience to reveal only their last choices, but somehow almost always ends with the words "Grey elephant in Denmark" even though the audience thought up their own words throughout the steps.

3. Another one ends up with the audience getting all the same number, but it is the WRONG number! Like an optical illusion, people are susceptible to adding up this particular sequence the wrong way almost every time.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10269">[[File:Male whale shark at Georgia Aquarium.jpg|thumb|right|350px|One of the several [[whale shark]]s housed at the [[Georgia Aquarium]]]]
Several species of '''[[shark]]s are kept in [[Captivity (animal)|captivity]]''' in public aquaria. In home aquaria, size constraints mean that only the smallest sharks are typically viable as pets.

==Public aquaria==
Until recently only a few [[benthic]] species of shark, such as [[Horn shark|hornsharks]], [[Triakis semifasciata|leopard sharks]], [[catshark]]s, and [[zebra shark]]s, had survived in aquarium conditions for up to a year or more. This gave rise to the belief that sharks, as well as being difficult to capture and transport, were difficult to care for. A better knowledge of sharks has led to more species (including the large [[pelagic]] sharks) being able to be kept for far longer. At the same time, transportation techniques have improved and long distance movement of sharks is becoming easier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mcss.sc/MCNEWS/mcn_v3_1_art3.htm |title=Whale Sharks in Captivity |accessdate=2015-02-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120826131514/http://www.mcss.sc/MCNEWS/mcn_v3_1_art3.htm |archivedate=August 26, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several attempts to keep a [[Great White Shark]] in captivity have been attempted, but most specimens died or had to be released after a short time. One example, placed in the [[Okinawa Churaumi Aquarium]] in Japan, only survived for three days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iflscience.com/plants-and-animals/great-white-shark-dies-after-just-three-days-captivity/ |title=Great White Shark Dies After Just THREE Days In Captivity |last=Hale |first=Tom |date=November 1, 2016 |website=IFL Science! |accessdate=2017-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The longest a Great White was held in captivity was at the [[Monterey Bay Aquarium]], in September 2004. A young female was kept in an outdoor tank for 198 days before releasing her back into the wild. In the following years, the Monterey Bay Aquarium hosted five more juvenile white sharks for temporary stays before ending their program in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/2016/7/8/12129028/great-white-shark-aquarium|title=Why there aren't any great white sharks in captivity|last=Fong|first=Joss|date=2016-07-08|website=Vox|access-date=2017-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Behavior===
When introduced to their new habitat some mature sharks has refused food despite the abundance and variety of feeding methods used&lt;ref&gt;Essapian, F. (1962). Notes on the Behavior of Sharks in Captivity. Copeia, 1962(2), 457-459. doi:10.2307/1440936&lt;/ref&gt;. Over a period of years this results in sharks dying of starvation amidst plenty&lt;ref&gt;Essapian, F. (1962). Notes on the Behavior of Sharks in Captivity. Copeia, 1962(2), 457-459. doi:10.2307/1440936&lt;/ref&gt;. 
Sharks are usually seen to live a solitary existence, rarely moving about in group events, although, a tank could house up to four or five species during the same time period&lt;ref&gt;Essapian, F. (1962). Notes on the Behavior of Sharks in Captivity. Copeia, 1962(2), 457-459. doi:10.2307/1440936&lt;/ref&gt;. 
It has been commonly seen that Lemon and Nurse sharks occupy the bottom of the tank floor. Occasionally, they will take a swim no more than two or three feet off the bottom&lt;ref&gt;Essapian, F. (1962). Notes on the Behavior of Sharks in Captivity. Copeia, 1962(2), 457-459. doi:10.2307/1440936&lt;/ref&gt;. Bull sharks, Sandbar sharks, and Sand tiger sharks continuously swim at mid-depth. Larger tiger sharks inhabit the upper region of the tank where their dorsal fin is breaking the surface frequently&lt;ref&gt;Essapian, F. (1962). Notes on the Behavior of Sharks in Captivity. Copeia, 1962(2), 457-459. doi:10.2307/1440936&lt;/ref&gt;. 
Swimming patterns seen from sharks in captivity are that of Blacktip, Bull, and Lemon sharks being active 24 hours and those of Sandbars, Nurse and Sand tigers being active at certain times of the day/night&lt;ref&gt;Hussain, S. M. (1991). The Behavior of Sharks in Captivity. Indian Journal of Fishtrits. Retrieved April 30, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;. However, within some aquaria’s this could be attributed to the different feeding times of these species&lt;ref&gt;Hussain, S. M. (1991). The Behavior of Sharks in Captivity. Indian Journal of Fishtrits. Retrieved April 30, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;. 
Sharks in captivity, referring to that of Sandbar, Sand tiger, and Nurse sharks are predicted to be less aggressive being that no aggressive biting is seen after feeding&lt;ref&gt;Flunory, M., Ortiz, M., &amp; Restrepo, A. (n.d.). A Behavioral Study of Sharks in Captivity. Retrieved April 30, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;. The foremost behavior observed from those in captivity was curiosity, reasoning's being due to less competition for food and lack of stimulation&lt;ref&gt;Flunory, M., Ortiz, M., &amp; Restrepo, A. (n.d.). A Behavioral Study of Sharks in Captivity. Retrieved April 30, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Home aquaria==
{{One source|date=January 2009}}
Most species of shark are not suitable for domestic aquaria and not every species of shark sold by pet stores make good inhabitants for personal aquaria. Some species of sharks can also be kept well in home saltwater aquaria.&lt;ref name="sharksathomeafm"&gt;{{Cite news | last = Michael | first = Scott W. | title = Sharks at Home | newspaper = Aquarium Fish Magazine | pages = 20–29 |date=March 2004 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Uninformed or unscrupulous dealers sometimes sell juvenile sharks like the [[nurse shark]], which upon reaching adulthood will have far outgrown typical home aquaria.&lt;ref name="sharksathomeafm"/&gt; Public aquaria are generally not interested in accepting donated specimens that have overgrown their housing and some shark owners have been tempted to [[Introduced species|release]] them into the wild.&lt;ref name="sharksathomeafm"/&gt;

===Housings===
However, some species of shark can make prized additions to home aquaria.&lt;ref name="sharksathomeafm"/&gt; Species appropriate to home aquaria represent considerable spatial and financial investments as they generally approach adult lengths of 3 feet and can live up to 25 years.&lt;ref name="sharksathomeafm"/&gt; Sharks must be housed in aquaria at or exceeding 180 gallons in volume, with more active species requiring more space.&lt;ref name="sharksathomeafm"/&gt; Surface area is an even more significant consideration for aquarists than volume as it is the determining factor for the amount of oxygen that ends up being dissolved in the water, and therefore critical to the sharks' respiration.&lt;ref name="sharksathomeafm"/&gt; Choice of aquarium substrate is also important because a sharp, rough bed can irritate a shark's soft underbelly, or in severe cases lead to fatal infections.&lt;ref name="sharksathomeafm"/&gt; Shark aquaria are generally advised to be decorated "conservatively" in order to leave space for the animal to move more freely during daily activities. A cave, however, is often an appropriate addition for some shy species.&lt;ref name="sharksathomeafm"/&gt;

===Diet and nutrition===
Sharks are very frequently overfed by amateur aquarists, which can lead to obesity or unnaturally fast growth rates.&lt;ref name="sharksathomeafm"/&gt; Captive sharks are healthiest when fed at levels similar to their food intake in the wild.&lt;ref name="sharksathomeafm"/&gt; Usually this amounts to 1-3% of their body weight weekly.&lt;ref name="sharksathomeafm"/&gt; However, aquarium conditions and species disposition are considered by conscientious aquarists when feeding captive sharks.&lt;ref name="sharksathomeafm"/&gt; Relatively sedentary species, such as wobbegongs can live on feedings occurring once or twice weekly.&lt;ref name="sharksathomeafm"/&gt; More active species may require to be fed three or four times per week to maintain satisfactory health.&lt;ref name="sharksathomeafm"/&gt; Sharks living in cooler water temperatures have slower metabolisms than sharks in warmer water housings and therefore require less food.&lt;ref name="sharksathomeafm"/&gt;

The most common staple food provided to captive sharks in home aquaria is frozen fish.&lt;ref name="sharksathomeafm"/&gt; The freezing process used to store foods for sharks often results in the food items losing nutrient value.&lt;ref name="sharksathomeafm"/&gt; Lost nutrients are replaced by vitamin supplements, which are marketed commercially, sometimes by companies generally associated with more typical pet foods (such as [[Purina Mills]]).&lt;ref name="sharksathomeafm"/&gt; Uncorrected nutrient deficiencies inherent in the frozen food diet can cause considerable detriment to the health of captive specimens.&lt;ref name="sharksathomeafm"/&gt; Conditions such as popeye, ascites, and anemia are known to occur in captive sharks that are deficient in some essential vitamin.&lt;ref name="sharksathomeafm"/&gt; Vitamin B deficiency results in a treatable condition where the shark's back arches and it swims in a circular motion.&lt;ref name="sharksathomeafm"/&gt;

Feeding sharks frozen non-marine fish can result in deficiencies of omega-3 fatty acids, which can result in "fat infiltration of the liver," which can impede the organ's function seriously enough for major health issues.&lt;ref name="sharksathomeafm"/&gt;

===In community tanks===
Sometimes sharks are unwittingly put in harm's way when aquarists include potentially dangerous tankmates in the same aquarium.&lt;ref name="sharksathomeafm"/&gt; Hobbyists generally don't think of other fish being a threat to sharks, but triggerfish, angel fish, puffers, and wrasses can all injure them.&lt;ref name="sharksathomeafm"/&gt; A large grouper is capable of consuming smaller sharks.&lt;ref name="sharksathomeafm"/&gt; Sometimes docile bottom feeding sharks are put at risk because of the fish that feed on the ocean bottom, sedentary sharks are simply an extension of the substrate."&lt;ref name="sharksathomeafm"/&gt; Another problem aquarists keeping sharks with other types of fish have encountered is that the smaller, more passive aquarium-friendly shark species often have difficulty competing with their tankmates for the food provided by the aquarist.&lt;ref name="sharksathomeafm"/&gt; Sharks are predatory themselves and may maul or consume tankmates smaller or weaker than themselves.&lt;ref name="sharksathomeafm"/&gt;

[[Image:Starcamp logo.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Star Camp]]

'''Star Camp''' is a German performing arts camp that was created in 2009. The camp kicked off in [[Büren, Westphalia|Büren]], [[Nuremberg]] and [[Werbellinsee]]. During the Easter holidays of 2010, Star Camp headed towards Helmarshausen in Bad Karlshafen, Hesse. The Star Camp takes place every year.

Since 2013 '''Robin Redelfs''' is the owner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.star-camp.de |title=Star Camp home page |work=Star-Camp.de |date=2011-01-10 |accessdate=2014-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Star Camp offers professional coaching in areas such as singing, dancing and interview training. It was initiated by German singing sensation [[LaFee]], who stated it was always her dream to create a camp for young, talented individuals, since she would have enjoyed such a camp greatly while beginning her career and pursuing her musical ambitions. Co-founders include young entrepreneur and former major label recording artist, Matthew Mockridge. To create an equal opportunity for everyone interested in Star Camp LaFee and her team partnered with leading media companies to give out scholarships to very talented contestants. Among others, Scholarships were provided by newspaper magazine ''[[Bild]]'' and television station [[Viva (TV station)|VIVA]]. Star Camp currently costs €399 per camper for 1 week. This includes room, board, classes and souvenirs. The age restriction is 10 to 20 years. The Star Camp experience includes daily coaching sessions with professional artists and other representatives of the entertainment industry. Other camp activities such as swimming, movie-night, camp-fire and sports are also part of Star Camp.

In 2013 Robin Redelfs took over the company. Ever since the camps take place under his direction.

==Coaches==
* Faiz Mangat - Vocal coach and former member of famous pop group [[Bro'Sis]].
* [[LaFee]] - Initiator of the Camp. She also coaches in areas such as styling, interview training, stage presence and image.
* [[Marc Jentzen]] - Former member of boy group Part Six and Top 10 contestant of ''[[Deutschland sucht den Superstar]]''.
* Selina Shirin Müller - Winner of "Beste Stimme 2006" and actress in German movie "Freche Mädchen".

==2009==
In its first year, Star Camp was taken out in 3 cities. The camp took place in Büren, Nuremberg and Werbellinsee. A total of 5 scholarships was given out, the final show was filmed by RTL and some major label executives were invited to the show. The ensemble song was "[[Lean on Me (song)|Lean On Me]]" for all three camps. Marc Jentzen from ''[[Deutschland sucht den Superstar]]'' was a guest coach for the three camps.

==2010: Easter Special==
The only camp held in 2010 was during the Easter holidays and was called "Easter Special". All campers, headed by 5 specially selected lead singers and guest stars, recorded the promotional song "For Once and For All", the official Camp-Song for 2010. The ensemble song 2010 was "[[Fame (Irene Cara song)|Fame]]".

==2011==
Star Camp has announced to take a break in 2010 and will come back to Germany in the summer of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.star-camp.de/start/das-star-camp-jahr-2010-und-ausblick-2011 Star Camp Preview 2011| Star-Camp.de&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''''Tankōbon'''''|単行本||"independent/standalone book"}} is the Japanese term for a book that is complete in itself and is not part of a series or corpus. In modern Japan, though, it is most often used in reference to individual volumes of a single [[manga]], as opposed to {{Nihongo|[[Manga magazines|magazines]]|雑誌|zasshi}}, which feature multiple series.&lt;ref name = "Gravett"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Gravett|title=Manga: Sixty Years of Japanese Comics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VgdjrS-lYwQC|publisher=Harper Design|year=2004|ISBN=1-85669-391-0|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schodt 1986"&gt;{{cite book|author=Frederik L. Schodt|title=' Manga! Manga! The World of Japanese Comics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sZ1AAAAACAAJ&amp;dq=Manga!+Manga! |publisher=Kodansha|location=Tokyo|year=1986|ISBN=978-0-87011-752-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest [[Imprint (trade name)|imprint]] labels for manga tankōbon publications include Jump Comics (for manga originally serialized in ''[[Weekly Shōnen Jump]]'' and other [[Jump (magazine line)|''Jump'' magazines]]), [[Shōnen Sunday|Shōnen Sunday Comics]], and [[Weekly Shōnen Magazine|Shōnen Magazine Comics]].

==Japanese comics==
[[Image:Tankobon comparison.jpg|thumb|This ''tankōbon'' (here, ''[[Love Hina]]'' #11) is smaller than this English ''tankōbon'' (here, ''[[Genshiken]]'' #8).]]
Typically, [[manga|Japanese comics]] are first published in thick, [[phone book|phone-book]]-sized weekly or monthly anthology [[list of manga magazines|manga magazine]]s (such as ''[[Afternoon (magazine)|Afternoon]]'', ''[[Weekly Shōnen Jump]]'', or ''[[Hana to Yume]]''). These anthologies often have hundreds of pages and dozens of individual series by multiple authors. They are printed on very cheap [[newsprint]] and are considered disposable. A ''tankōbon'' collects multiple installments from a single series and reprints them in a roughly [[paperback]]-sized volume on higher quality paper than in the original magazine printing. However, any colored images from the magazine publication are typically [[grayscale]]d.{{Citation needed | date = February 2014}}

In [[English language| English]], while a ''tankōbon'' translation is usually marketed as a "[[graphic novel]]" or "[[trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]]", the transliterated terms ''tankoubon'' and ''tankōbon'' are sometimes used amongst online communities. Japanese people frequently refer to manga ''tankōbon'' by the English [[loanword]] {{nihongo|"comics"|コミックス|komikkusu}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1= Shiraishi |first1=Saya S.|editor1-last= Katzenstein |editor1-first= Peter J. |editor2-last= Shiraishi |editor2-first= Takashi |title= Network Power: Japan and Asia |date=1997|publisher= Cornell University Press |location=Ithaca, New York |isbn=9780801483738|page=252|edition=Illustrated |chapter=Japan's Soft Power: Doraemon Goes Overseas|quote=The term Komikkusu (for comic books) spread and because of its English origin…}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it is more widespread for being used in place of the word "manga", as they are the same thing. The term also refers to the format itself—a comic collection in a [[Trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]] sized (roughly 13 × 18&amp;nbsp;cm, or 5" × 7") book (as opposed to the larger 18 × 25&amp;nbsp;cm / 7" × 10" format used by traditional American graphic novels). Although Japanese manga tankobon may be in various sizes, the most common are [[Paper size#Japanese B-series variant| Japanese B6]] (12.8 × 18.2&amp;nbsp;cm, 5.04" × 7.17") and [[Paper size|ISO A5]] (14.8 × 21.0&amp;nbsp;cm, 5.83" × 8.2").  The ''tankōbon'' format has made inroads in the American comics market, with several major publishers opting to release some of their titles in this smaller format, which is sometimes also called "digest format" or "[[digest size]]". In the United States, many manga are released in the so-called "Tokyopop trim" or "Tokyopop size" (approximately 5" × 7.5").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brienza|first=Casey E.|date = June 2009|title=Books, Not Comics: Publishing Fields, Globalization, and Japanese Manga in the United States | journal =Publishing Research Quarterly|publisher=Springer |location=New York|volume=25|issue=2|pages = 101–17 | issn =1053-8801|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/f11798l55w2872n0/|accessdate=March 12, 2010|doi = 10.1007/s12109-009-9114-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Special formats==
===''Aizōban''===
An '''''aizōban''''' ({{nihongo2|愛蔵版|lit. "favorite printing edition"}}) is a [[Special edition|collector's edition]] [[volume (bibliography)|volume]] . These volumes are generally more expensive and lavished with special features such as special covers created specifically for the edition, special paper used for the cover, higher quality paper, a special slipcase, and so on. ''Aizōban'' are generally printed in a limited run, thereby increasing the value and collectability of those few copies made. The ''aizōban'' format has begun to make inroads into the US market, with titles such as ''[[Fruits Basket]]'', ''[[Rurouni Kenshin]]'' and ''[[Gundam_The_Origin|Mobile Suit Gundam: The Origin]]'' being reissued in ''aizōban'' format.  Generally only the most popular manga are released in this format.

===''Bunkoban''===
{{Distinguish|Bunkobon}}
A '''''bunkoban''''' ({{nihongo2|文庫版}}) edition refers to a ''tankōbon'' printed in ''[[bunkobon|bunko]]'' format, or a typical Japanese novel-sized volume. ''Bunkoban'' are generally [[Paper size|A6]] size (105 × 148&amp;nbsp;mm) and thicker than ''tankōbon'' and, in the case of manga, usually have a new cover designed specifically for the release. In the case of manga, a ''bunkoban'' tends to contain considerably more pages than a ''tankōbon'' and usually a republication of ''tankōbon'' of the same title which may or may not have been out of print. Thus, the ''bunko'' edition of a given manga will consist of fewer volumes. For example, ''[[Please Save My Earth]]'' was published in 21 ''tankōbon'' volumes, and then re-released in 12 ''bunko'' volumes. If the original manga was a ''wide-ban'' release, the ''bunkoban'' release will generally have the same number of volumes. The term is commonly abbreviated in Japanese to just ''bunko'' (without the ''-ban'').

===''Kanzenban''===
The '''''kanzenban''''' ({{nihongo2|完全版|lit. "complete edition"}}) is another term sometimes used to denote this kind of a special release. A ''kanzenban'' release is generally [[ISO 216|A5 size]] (148 × 210&amp;nbsp;mm) and will typically reproduce individual chapter covers, color pages, and side-stories from its original magazine run, features that are often omitted or converted to [[grayscale]] in standard ''tankōbon'' releases. While the ''aizōban'' appellation emphasizes the value of the volumes, the term ''kanzenban'' emphasizes their completeness, though it is likewise generally reserved for popular manga such as ''[[Dragon Ball (manga)|Dragon Ball]]''.

===''Shinsōban''===
Similar to a ''wide-ban'', a {{nihongo|'''''shinsōban'''''|新装版}} is a new edition released with (usually) a new cover. The volumes in such a release usually have new color pages and other extras. For example, in 2002, ''[[Sailor Moon]]'' was reedited; some pages were completely redrawn and most dialogues were rewritten by the author. Plus, the chapters were redivided to fit into 12 volumes instead of 18.{{Citation needed | date = February 2014}}

===''Sōshūhen''===
The '''''sōshūhen''''' ({{nihongo2|総集編|lit. "complete collection"}}) is a relatively new format published by [[Shueisha]] beginning in 2008. A ''sōshūhen'' edition is [[ISO 216|B5 size]] (176 × 250&amp;nbsp;mm), larger than a ''kanzenban'', and similarly reproduces chapter covers and color pages while also including a variety of bonus features such as posters and interviews. The majority of ''sōshūhen'' releases are for popular manga with ongoing serializations. They also contain far more pages than a standard ''tankōbon'' and thus feature more chapters in fewer volumes; ''[[Naruto]]'' Part I was originally published in 27 ''tankōbon'' volumes, but was completed in just eight ''sōshūhen'' volumes.

===''Wide-ban''===
A '''''wide-ban''''' or '''''waidoban''''' ({{Nihongo2|ワイド版}}) edition is larger ([[ISO 216|A5]] size) than a regular ''tankōbon''. Many manga, particularly [[Seinen manga|seinen]] and [[josei manga]], are published in ''wide-ban'' editions after magazine serialization, and are never released in the ''tankōbon'' format that is common in [[shōnen manga]] and [[shōjo manga]]. When a series originally published in ''tankōbon'' format is re-released in ''wide-ban'' format, each volume will contain more pages than in the original edition, and therefore the series will consist of fewer volumes. For example, ''[[Maison Ikkoku]]'' was originally released in 15 ''tankōbon'' volumes, but was republished as 10 ''wide-ban'' volumes.{{Citation needed | date = February 2014}}

'''"The Ghost of the Grotto"''' is a 26-page [[funny animal]] [[comic book]] story written, drawn, and lettered by [[Carl Barks]]. It was first published in [[Four Color]] #159 (August 1947) with the 25-page Carl Barks comic book story, "[[Adventure Down Under]]". The cover and both stories have been reprinted many times.

==Plot==
Donald Duck and his nephews have rented a boat in order to collect [[seaweed]] in the [[West Indies]] for money. When they get back on land in order to wait out the low [[tide]] so they can collect seaweed inside a [[grotto]], the four hear that "tonight is the night". It turns out that the night is the night the [[ghost]] of the grotto kidnaps a little boy. With the ducks luck, Dewey is the one kidnapped. Now the ducks are faced with the task of saving Dewey and not only have to face the kidnapper, but an [[octopus]] guarding a giant ship. The ducks manage to get rid of the octopus by using a ton of [[black pepper|pepper]] and collecting a ton of seaweed in the process. Then Donald uses a mouse named Montmorency to disarm the kidnapper. He is revealed to be the latest guardian of the treasure of Sir [[Francis Drake]] while Dewey was expected to succeed him. The story ends with the guardian being allowed to keep the treasure and spend it as he sees fit, which to him, is on fancy clothing and hamburgers.

==Biography==
Anna Mathilda Winger was born in [[Arendal, Norway]]. She immigrated to the United States at age 14 and first trained as a hair dresser. She began her rodeo career riding during 1911 in [[Los Angeles, California]] where she won the bronc riding competition. At the  [[Pendleton Round-Up]] in [[Pendleton, Oregon]] during 1912, she won both the trick riding and cowgirls' bronc riding contests. She was also a trick rider and relay racer. Her image was captured by [[Walter S. Bowman]], a professional photographer in Pendleton.&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.uoregon.edu/speccoll/photo/Pendleton/fbowman.html "Fancy Riding, Tillie Baldwin, the Champion Lady Buckaroo"] (Furlong collection, PH244-0083 University of Oregon)&lt;/ref&gt; Later Bowman's 1915 image of [[Bonnie McCarroll]] being thrown from a horse named Silver at the Pendleton Round-Up became famous. McCarroll died years later in another accident at the Pendleton Round-Up.&lt;ref&gt;''The Fact, Not Legend, of Tillie Baldwin'' (Sunday Herald Magazine. Bridgeport, Conn. September 7, 1958)&lt;/ref&gt;

Mathilda Winger became Tillie Baldwin after she joined [[Captain Jack Baldwin's Wild West Show]].  She later joining [[Will Rogers]]' vaudeville troupe and then worked at the [[101 Ranch Wild West Show]].&lt;ref name="cowgirl"&gt;[http://www.cowgirl.net/?s=Tillie+Baldwin Tillie Baldwin] 2000 Cowgirl Honoree – National Cowgirl Museum and Hall of Fame&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wept&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1915&amp;dat=19350816&amp;id=ip00AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=XHEFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1064,3865246 Tillie Baldwin weeps over death of Will Rogers] (The Day.

[[File:Wikipedian-in-Residence Scope Diagram Page 1.png|thumb|The relationship between a Wikipedian in residence and the community. The diagram represents the stakeholders and what each stakeholder provides and receives in a typical Wikipedian in Residence project.]]

A '''Wikipedian in residence''' or '''Wikimedian in residence''' ('''WiR''') is a [[Wikipedia]] editor, a [[Wikipedian]] (or Wikimedian), who accepts a placement with an institution, typically an art gallery, library, archive or museum ([[GLAM (industry sector)|GLAM]]), [[learned society]], or institute of higher education (such as a university) to facilitate [[Wikipedia editing|Wikipedia entries]] related to that institution's mission, encourage and assist it to release material under open licences, and to develop the relationship between the institution and the Wikimedia community. A Wikipedian in residence generally helps to coordinate Wikipedia-related outreach events between the GLAM and the general public.

Institutions that have hosted a Wikipedian in residence include large institutions like the [[National Library of Wales]], [[British Museum]], the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]], the [[British Library]], the [[University of Toronto]], the [[National Library of Norway]], and the [[Federal Archives of Switzerland]] and smaller venues like the [[Derby Museum and Art Gallery]] and [[The New Art Gallery Walsall]] in the UK; the [[Palace of Versailles]] in France; the [[Museu Picasso]] in Spain; and in the US, the [[Smithsonian Institution]], the [[Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library]], and the [[National Archives and Records Administration]].

== Developing interest ==

In 2010, Australian Liam Wyatt became the first Wikipedian in residence when he volunteered at the [[British Museum]] for a period of five weeks.&lt;ref name="Cohen group"&gt;{{cite web |last = Cohen |first = Noam |title = Venerable British Museum Enlists in the Wikipedia Revolution |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/05/arts/design/05wiki.html |work = [[The New York Times]] |accessdate = 27 January 2013 |date = 5 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/20/arts/artsspecial/warming-up-to-the-culture-of-wikipedia.html |title = Warming Up to the Culture of Wikipedia |work = The New York Times |date = 19 March 2014 |accessdate = 24 March 2014 |last = Cohen |first = Noam }}&lt;/ref&gt; He noted the need for Wikipedia to strengthen partnerships with museums to create the most up-to-date and accurate information,&lt;ref name=Inside&gt;{{cite web |title = Museum Hires First Wikipedian-in-Residence |url = http://www.insideindianabusiness.com/newsitem.asp?ID=49490#middle |work = Inside Indiana Business |accessdate = 27 January 2013 |location = Indianapolis, Indiana |date = 19 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; saying "we are doing the same thing for the same reason, for the same people, in the same medium. Let's do it together." The [[Children's Museum of Indianapolis]] became involved with the program after Wikipedian Lori Phillips volunteered for a GLAM event in 2010,&lt;ref name=Inside /&gt; becoming the second Wikipedian in residence. The third, Benoît Evellin, spent six months at the [[Palace of Versailles]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikipedia:GLAM/Château de Versailles|GLAM Château de Versailles Project page]]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Museu Picasso]] in Barcelona, Spain, and the [[Derby Museum and Art Gallery]] in the United Kingdom were also early adopters of the idea.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikipedia:GLAM/Museu Picasso|GLAM Museu Picasso Project page]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikipedia:GLAM/Derby|GLAM Derby Project page]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the [[Smithsonian Institution]] expressed interest in the idea, which led to the hiring of Sarah Stierch in July as Wikipedian in Residence.&lt;ref name=Cohen2&gt;{{cite web |last = Cohen |first = Noam |title = Success may be Wikipedia's biggest challenge |url = http://www.boston.com/business/technology/articles/2010/07/12/success_may_be_wikipedias_biggest_challenge/ |work = [[The Boston Globe]] |accessdate = 27 January 2013 |date = 12 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Switzer |first = Cody |url = http://philanthropy.com/blogs/social-philanthropy/wikipedian-in-residence-helps-share-smithsonian-archives/28989 |title = Wikipedian-in-residence helps share Smithsonian archives |work = The Chronicle of Philanthropy |date = 28 July 2011 |accessdate = 27 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Shen |first = Aviva |url = http://blogs.smithsonianmag.com/aroundthemall/2012/04/how-many-women-does-it-take-to-change-wikipedia/ |title = How many women does it take to change Wikipedia? |work = Smithsonian Magazine |date = 4 April 2012 |accessdate = 27 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |work = [[The Independent]] |first = Paul |last = Gallagher |title = Wikipedia fires editor who enhanced entries for cash |date = 10 January 2014 |url = https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/wikipedia-fires-editor-who-enhanced-entries-for-cash-9052308.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, the [[National Archives and Records Administration]] followed suit and hired Dominic McDevitt-Parks, a student from [[Simmons College (Massachusetts)|Simmons College]], who was pursuing a [[master's degree]] in history and archives management, to work at its Archives II location.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |work = [[The Baltimore Sun]] |first = Julie |last = Baughman |title = National Archives hires 'Wikipedian in residence' |date = 13 July 2011 |url = http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2011-07-13/news/bs-md-wikipedia-archives-20110621_1_national-archives-wikipedian-archives-information |accessdate = 26 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Washington&gt;{{Cite news |work = [[The Washington Post]] |first = Lisa |last = Rein |title = National Archives hires first 'Wikipedian' |date = 2 June 2011 |url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/post/national-archives-hires-first-wikipedian/2011/03/23/AG63MCHH_blog.html |accessdate = 26 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; McDevitt-Parks had been editing Wikipedia since 2004 and was hired for this position by [[David Ferriero]].&lt;ref name=Washington/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |work = [[Tampa Bay Times]] |title = National Archives appoints a 'Wikipedian' |date = 3 June 2011 |url = http://www.tampabay.com/incoming/national-archives-appoints-a-wikipedian/1173507 |accessdate = 26 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2011 [[Wikimedia UK]] engaged Andy Mabbett, an editor since 2003, as an "Outreach Ambassador" in-residence at the Bristol-based wildlife charity [[Wildscreen]], working on the [[m:ARKive project|ARKive project]].&lt;ref name="Bristol24-7"&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.bristol247.com/2011/09/16/bristol-wikipedians-taught-to-edit-online-encylopaedia-26319/ |title = Bristol 'Wikipedians' taught to edit online encylopaedia |last = Zaba |first = Christina |date = 16 September 2011 |work = Bristol24-7 |accessdate = 13 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then Mabbett has been a Wikipedian in residence at other organisations such as [[the New Art Gallery Walsall]].&lt;ref name="Museums Association"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.museumsassociation.org/museum-practice/wikipedia/17062013-the-new-art-gallery-walsall |title = The New Art Gallery Walsall |last = Brown |first = Julie |date = 17 June 2013 |publisher = Museums Association |accessdate = 13 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2013, the [[Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library]] became the first [[Presidential library]] to hire a Wikipedian in residence, when they hired Michael Barera, a master's student at the [[University of Michigan]].&lt;ref name=Kaczmarczyk&gt;{{cite web |last = Kaczmarczyk |first = Jeffrey |title = President Gerald R.

In September 2013, the National Archives and Records Administration became the first organisation to employ a permanent full-time Wikipedian in residence when it hired Dominic McDevitt-Parks to join its Office of Innovation in that capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://blogs.archives.gov/aotus/?p=5179 |title = Breaking New Ground Again |date = 19 September 2013 |publisher = [[National Archives and Records Administration]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2014, [[Harvard University]] posted a job listing seeking applicants to be their Wikipedian in residence at the [[Houghton Library]].&lt;ref name="Outreach"&gt;{{cite web |url = https://outreach.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikipedian_in_Residence |title = Wikipedian in Residence |work = Outreach Wiki |accessdate = 18 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2014, the [[University of Victoria]] Libraries announced that in collaboration with The Electronic Textual Cultures Lab (ETCL) and the Federation for the Humanities and Social Sciences that [[:fr:Christian Vandendorpe|Christian Vandendorpe]] had been named Honorary Resident Wikipedian-in-Residence for the 2014/2015 academic year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.ideas-idees.ca/media/media-releases/honorary-resident-wikipedian-professor-christian-vandendorpe |title = Honorary resident Wikipedian: Professor Christian Vandendorpe - Federation for the Humanities and Social Sciences |publisher =  |accessdate = 28 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2016, more than 100 Wikipedians had taken part in the role,&lt;ref name="Outreach" /&gt; most of whom were paid by either the institution where they work or a Wikimedia-related organization.

== Role and duties ==

The primary role of the Wikipedian-in-Residence is to serve as a liaison between the host institution and the Wikimedia community by assisting with events and training that support the missions of both organisations. Typical duties include  arranging and/or leading training events and [[editathon|editathons;]]&lt;ref name="theregister orlowski 20120216"&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/02/16/british_library_wikipedian/ |title = British Library seeks taxpayer-funded Wikipedia-fiddler |work = [[The Register]] |date = 16 February 2012 |accessdate = 19 June 2013 |last = Orlowski |first = Andrew |authorlink = Andrew Orlowski }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc 20130424"&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-22264118 |title = National Library of Scotland recruits 'Wikipedian' |work = [[BBC News]] |date = 24 April 2013 |accessdate = 19 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; providing explanations to other staff and members of the public about policies and practice, such as policies about conflict-of-interest; as well as making contributions to articles relevant to the institution's materials and mission, such as articles about significant cultural objects in an organisation's collection.&lt;ref name="bristolwireless woods 20130418"&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.bristolwireless.net/2013/04/national-library-of-scotland-seeks-wikipedian-in-residence/ |title = National Library of Scotland seeks Wikipedian in residence |work = Bristol Wireless |date = 18 April 2013 |accessdate = 19 June 2013 |last = Woods |first = Steve }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Compensation ==
While Wikipedia discourages direct paid compensation for article editing and prohibits undisclosed advocacy, Wikipedians in residence are [[Wikipedia:Conflict of interest#Wikipedians in residence|permitted to be compensated for work on-wiki]], either by offering credit, stipend or salary, through their sponsoring institutions {{em|provided that}} they adhere to strict guidelines against engaging in public relations or marketing for their institution.

== Reception ==

One such advertised post has been reported positively by others as being a "unique opportunity to help enrich Wikipedia and its sister projects and share with the world... resources and knowledge."&lt;ref name="bristolwireless woods 20130418" /&gt; Conversely, journalist [[Andrew Orlowski]] criticized another advertised post as a waste of government funds.&lt;ref name="theregister orlowski 20120216" /&gt; In 2013, a part-time temporary position was advertised by [[National Library of Scotland]] and was noted as being "the first large-scale partnership" between a Scottish institution and [[Wikimedia UK]].&lt;ref name="bbc 20130424" /&gt; This initiative was followed by [[University of Edinburgh]] where a Wikimedian in residence was appointed in December 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://www.studentnewspaper.org/university-of-edinburgh-to-employ-wikimedian-in-residence-web-editor/ |title = University of Edinburgh to employ ‘Wikimedian in Residence’ web editor |last = Ho |first = Amanda |date = 13 October 2015 |website = The Student Newspaper |access-date = 7 May 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
