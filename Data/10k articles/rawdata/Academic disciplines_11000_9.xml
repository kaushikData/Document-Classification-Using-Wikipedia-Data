In [[visual perception|ocular]] [[physiology]], '''adaptation''' is the ability of the [[human eye|eye]] to adjust to various levels of light. Natural [[night vision]], or [[scotopic vision]], is the ability to see under low-light conditions. In humans, [[rod cell]]s are exclusively responsible for night vision as [[cone cell]]s are only able to function at higher illumination levels.&lt;ref name="Miller"&gt;Miller, R. E., &amp; Tredici, T. J. (1992). Night vision manual for the flight surgeon. PN.&lt;/ref&gt;  Night vision is of a much poorer quality than day vision because it is limited by a reduced [[Optical resolution|resolution]] and therefore provides the ability to only discriminate between shades of black and white.&lt;ref name="Miller"/&gt;  In order for humans to transition from day to night vision they must undergo a '''dark adaptation''' period in which each eye adjusts from a high luminescence setting to a low luminescence setting.&lt;ref name="Miller"/&gt;  This adaptation period is different for both rod and cone cells and results from the regeneration of [[photopigments]] to restore retinal sensitivity.&lt;ref name="Miller"/&gt;

{{TOC limit|3}}

== Efficiency ==
The human eye can function from very dark to very bright levels of light; its sensing capabilities reach across nine [[order of magnitude|orders of magnitude]]. This means that the brightest and the darkest light signal that the eye can sense are a factor of roughly 1,000,000,000 apart. However, in any given moment of time, the eye can only sense a [[contrast (vision)|contrast]] ratio of 1,000. What enables the wider reach is that the eye adapts its definition of what is black.

The eye takes approximately 20–30 minutes to fully adapt from bright sunlight to complete darkness and becomes 10,000 to 1,000,000 times more sensitive than at full daylight. In this process, the eye's perception of color changes as well (this is called the [[Purkinje effect]]). However, it takes approximately five minutes for the eye to adapt from darkness to bright sunlight. This is due to cones obtaining more sensitivity when first entering the dark for the first five minutes but the rods taking over after five or more minutes.&lt;ref name="eye, human"&gt;"Sensory Reception: Human Vision: Structure and Function of the Human Eye"  Encyclopædia Britannica, vol. 27, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cone cells]] are able to regain maximum retinal sensitivity in 9–10 minutes of darkness whereas rods require 30–45 minutes to do so.&lt;ref name="Sensory"&gt;"Sensory Reception: Human Vision: Structure and function of the Human Eye" vol. 27, p. 179 Encyclopædia Britannica, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

Dark adaptation is far quicker and deeper in young people than the elderly.&lt;ref name="effect of age"&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 10748929 | volume=39 | issue=23 | title=Aging and dark adaptation |vauthors=Jackson GR, Owsley C, McGwin G Jr | journal=Vision Res | pages=3975–82 | doi=10.1016/s0042-6989(99)00092-9| year=1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cones vs. rods ===
{{See also|Photoreceptor cell}}
[[File:Cone-response-en.svg|thumb|upright=2|Normalised absorption spectra of the three human photopsins and of human rhodopsin (dashed).]]
The human eye contains two types of photoreceptors, rods and cones, which can be easily distinguished by their structure.  Cone photoreceptors are conical in shape and contain cone [[opsin]]s as their visual pigments.  There exist three types of cone photoreceptors, each being maximally sensitive to a specific wavelength of light depending on the structure of their opsin photopigment.&lt;ref name="Kolb"&gt;[http://webvision.med.utah.edu/book/part-ii-anatomy-and-physiology-of-the-retina/photoreceptors/ Link], Kolb, H. (n.d.). Photoreceptors.&lt;/ref&gt;  The various cone cells are maximally sensitive to either short wavelengths (blue light), medium wavelengths (green light), or long wavelengths (red light).  Rod photoreceptors only contain one type of photopigment, rhodopsin, which has a peak sensitivity at a wavelength of approximately 530 nanometers which corresponds to blue-green light.&lt;ref name="Kolb"/&gt;
	The distribution of photoreceptor cells across the surface of the retina has important consequences for vision.&lt;ref name="Purves"&gt;Purves, D., Augustine, G. J., &amp; Fitzpatrick, D. (2001). Neuroscience. (2nd ed.). Sinauer Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;  Cone photoreceptors are concentrated in a depression in the center of the retina known as the [[fovea centralis]] and decrease in number towards the periphery of the retina.&lt;ref name="Purves"/&gt;  Conversely, rod photoreceptors are present at high density throughout the most of the retina with a sharp decline in the fovea.  Perception in high luminescence settings is dominated by cones despite the fact that they are greatly outnumbered by rods (approximately 4.5 million to 91 million).&lt;ref name="Purves"/&gt;

== Ambient light response ==
[[File:Dark Adaptation.png|thumbnail|right|Visual Response to Darkness]]
A minor mechanism of adaptation is the [[pupillary light reflex]], adjusting the amount of light that reaches the retina.

In response to varying ambient light levels, [[rods and cones]] of eye function both in isolation and in tandem to adjust the visual system. Changes in the sensitivity of rods and cones in the eye are the major contributors to dark adaptation.

Above a certain [[luminance]] level (about 0.03&amp;nbsp;cd/m{{sup|2}}), the cone mechanism is involved in mediating vision; [[photopic vision]]. Below this level, the rod mechanism comes into play providing [[scotopic vision|scotopic (night) vision]]. The range where two mechanisms are working together is called the [[Mesopic vision|mesopic range]], as there is not an abrupt transition between the two mechanism. This adaptation forms the basis of the '''Duplicity Theory'''.&lt;ref name="Light_Dark"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webvision.med.utah.edu/book/part-viii-gabac-receptors/light-and-dark-adaptation/|title=Light and Dark Adaptation by Michael Kalloniatis and Charles Luu – Webvision|website=webvision.med.utah.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advantages of night vision ==
{{See also|Night vision}}
[[File:TapetumLucidum.JPG|thumb|Reflection of camera flash from ''[[tapetum lucidum]]'']]

Many animals such as [[cat]]s possess high-resolution night vision, allowing them to discriminate objects with high frequencies in low illumination settings.  The ''[[tapetum lucidum]]'' is a reflective structure that is responsible for this superior night vision as it mirrors light back through the [[retina]] exposing the [[Photoreceptor cell|photoreceptor]] cells to an increased amount of light.&lt;ref name="Ollivier"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ollivier | first1 = F.

Despite the fact that the resolution of human day vision is far superior to that of night vision, human night vision provides many advantages.  Like many predatory animals humans can use their night vision to prey upon and ambush other animals without their awareness.  Furthermore, in the event of an emergency situation occurring at night humans can increase their chances of survival if they are able to perceive their surroundings and get to safety.  Both of these benefits can be used to explain why humans did not completely lose the ability to see in the dark from their nocturnal ancestors.&lt;ref name="Hall"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hall | first1 = M.

The sensitivity of the [[Rod cell|rod pathway]] improves considerably within 5–10 minutes in the dark.  Color testing has been used to determine the time at which rod mechanism takes over; when the rod mechanism takes over colored spots appear colorless as only [[Cone cell|cone pathways]] encode color.&lt;ref&gt;Aubert H. Physiologie der Netzhaut. Breslau: E. Morgenstern; 1865.&lt;/ref&gt;

Four factors affect dark adaptation:
*Intensity and duration of the pre-adapting light: By increasing the levels of pre-adapting luminances, the duration of cone mechanism dominance extends, while the rod mechanism switch over is more delayed.  In addition the absolute threshold takes longer to reach. The opposite is true for decreasing the levels of pre-adapting luminances.&lt;ref name="saturation"&gt;Bartlett NR. Dark and light adaptation. In: Graham CH, editor. Vision and visual perception. New
York: John Wiley and Sons, Inc.; 1965.&lt;/ref&gt;

*Size and location on the retina: The location of the test spot affects the dark adaptation curve because of the distribution of the [[Photoreceptor cell|rods and cones]] in the retina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hallett PE | year = 1969 | title = The variations in visual threshold measurement | journal = J Physiol | volume = 202 | issue = 403–419| pages = 403–19 | pmid = 5784294 | pmc=1351489}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Wavelength of the threshold light:Varying the wavelengths of stimuli also affect the dark adaptation curve.  Long wavelengths, such as extreme red, create the absence of a distinct rod/cone break as the rod and cone cells have similar sensitivities to light of long wavelengths. Conversely at short wavelengths the rod/cone break is more prominent, because the rod cells are much more sensitive than cones once the rods have dark adapted.&lt;ref name="saturation" /&gt;
*Rhodopsin regeneration: Upon exposure to light [[photopigments]] in both rod and cone photoreceptor cells undergo a structural change.&lt;ref name="American"&gt;[http://www.aoa.org/optometrists/tools-and-resources/clinical-care-publications/aviation-vision/the-eye-and-night-vision?sso=y Link], American Optometric Association.&lt;/ref&gt; The eye and night vision.During light adaptation the photopigments are decomposed thereby reducing retinal sensitivity in low luminescence settings.&lt;ref name="American"/&gt;  This is known as photoreceptor [[bleaching]] and is proportional to the quantum catch of the pigment.&lt;ref name="Colour"&gt;[http://www.cvrl.org/database/text/intros/introbleaches.htm Link], Colour and Vision Research Laboratory. (n.d.).Bleaching.&lt;/ref&gt;  The regeneration of the photopigments occurs during dark adaptation albeit at markedly different rates.&lt;ref name="American"/&gt;  Rod cells are much slower to adapt to the dark and it is believed to take days for these cells to reach full dark adaptation.&lt;ref name="American"/&gt;&lt;ref name="saturation" /&gt; The photopigment found in rod cells is called [[rhodopsin]].&lt;ref name="Perkins"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1688997/human-eye/64912/Bleaching-of-rhodopsin Link], Perkins, E. S. (2014). Human eye. In Encyclopædia Britannica.&lt;/ref&gt;  Upon the absorption of light rod cells becomes bleached causing rhodopsin to lose all of its colour and become transparent.&lt;ref name="Perkins"/&gt;  During dark adaptation the rod cells regenerate and the rhodopsin regains its purple pigmentation rendering them capable of capturing light.&lt;ref name="Perkins"/&gt;

===Intracellular signalling===
Normally, calcium reduces the affinity of channels to cGMP, through calcium-binding protein, [[calmodulin]].&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=1962979|year=1990|author1=Pugh Jr|first1=E. N.|title=Cyclic GMP and calcium: The internal messengers of excitation and adaptation in vertebrate photoreceptors|journal=Vision Research|volume=30|issue=12|pages=1923–48|last2=Lamb|first2=T. D.|doi=10.1016/0042-6989(90)90013-b}}&lt;/ref&gt; A decrease in calcium levels when cGMP gated Na&lt;sup&gt;+1&lt;/sup&gt; channels close activates [[guanylate cyclase]], which increases production of cGMP, and also increases the affinity of the channels to cGMP to potentiate re-opening of the Na&lt;sup&gt;+1&lt;/sup&gt; channels.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; The decrease in calcium ion concentration also inhibits the activation of [[phosphodiesterase]] to slow cGMP hydrolysis and increase the amount of cGMP.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; This allows for the photoreceptor cell to hyperpolarize again in response to changes in brightness level even in the dark because channels would re-open and allow for the cell to slightly depolarize.

=== Inhibition ===
Inhibition by neurons also affects activation in synapses. Together with the bleaching of a [[Photoreceptor cell|rod or cone pigment]], merging of signals on [[retinal ganglion cell|ganglion cells]] are inhibited, reducing convergence. Alpha adaptation, ''i.e.'', rapid sensitivity fluctuations, is powered by nerve control. The merging of signals by virtue of the diffuse ganglion cells, as well as horizontal and amacrine cells, allow a cumulative effect.  Thus that area of stimulation is inversely proportional to intensity of light, a strong stimulus of 100 rods equivalent to a weak stimulus of 1,000 rods.

In sufficiently bright light, convergence is low, but during dark adaptation, convergence of rod signals boost. This is not due to structural changes, but by a possible shutdown of inhibition that stops convergence of messages in bright light. If only one eye is open, the closed eye must adapt separately upon reopening to match the already adapted eye.&lt;ref name="eye, human" /&gt;

=== Measuring Dark Adaptation ===
Ophthalmologists sometimes measure patients' dark adaptation using an instrument known as a dark adaptometer. Currently, there is one commercially available dark adaptometer, called the [https://www.maculogix.com/dark-adaptation AdaptDx]. It works by measuring a patient's Rod Intercept (RI) time. RI is the number of minutes it takes for the eye to adapt from bright light to darkness. This RI number provides a clear and objective measurement of retinal function with 90% sensitivity and specificity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jackson|first=GR|year=2014|title=Diagnostic Sensitivity and Specificity of Dark Adaptometry for Detection of Age-Related Macular Degeneration|journal=Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci|volume=55 | issue = 3 |pages=1427–1431|via=|pmc=3954002|pmid=24550363|doi=10.1167/iovs.13-13745}}&lt;/ref&gt; Basically, an RI of less than 6.5 minutes indicates a healthy dark adaptation function.  However, an RI higher than 6.5 indicates impaired dark adaptation.

==== Using Dark Adaptation Measurement to Diagnose Disease ====
Numerous clinical studies have shown that dark adaptation function is dramatically impaired from the earliest stages of AMD, retinitis pigmentosa (RP), and other retinal diseases, with increasing impairment as the diseases progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Owsley|first=C.|last2=Jackson|first2=G.

It is also the leading cause of vision loss among people age 50 and older.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nei.nih.gov/health/maculardegen/armd_facts|title=Facts About Age-Related Macular Degeneration|last=NEI|date=|website=NEI|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is characterized by a breakdown of the RPE/Bruch's membrane complex in the retina, leading to an accumulation of cholesterol deposits in the macula.  Eventually, these deposits become clinically-visible drusen that affect photoreceptor health, causing inflammation and a predisposition to choroidal neovascularization (CNV). During the AMD disease course, the RPE/Bruch's function continues to deteriorate, hampering nutrient and oxygen transport to the rod and cone photoreceptors. As a side effect of this process, the photoreceptors exhibit impaired dark adaptation because they require these nutrients for replenishment of photopigments and clearance of opsin to regain scotopic sensitivity after light exposure.

Measurement of a patient's dark adaptation function is essentially a bioassay of the health of their Bruch's membrane. As such, research has shown that, with the AdaptDx, doctors can detect subclinical AMD at least three years earlier than it is clinically evident.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Owsley|first=Cynthia|last2=McGwin|first2=Gerald|last3=Clark|first3=Mark E.|last4=Jackson|first4=Gregory R.|last5=Callahan|first5=Michael A.|last6=Kline|first6=Lanning B.|last7=Witherspoon|first7=C.

==Accelerating dark adaptation==
There are a range of different methods, with varying levels of evidence, that have been purported or demonstrated to increase the rate at which vision can adapt in the dark.

=== Red lights and lenses ===
As a result of rod cells having a peak sensitivity at a wavelength of 530 nanometers they cannot perceive all colours on the visual spectrum.  Because rod cells are insensitive to long wavelengths, the use of red lights and red lens glasses has become a common practise for accelerating dark adaptation.&lt;ref name="Abbott"&gt;[http://users.ipfw.edu/abbott/120/adaptation.html Link], Abbott, B. (2012). Sensation and perception.&lt;/ref&gt;  In order for dark adaptation to be significantly accelerated an individual should ideally begin this practise 30 minutes prior to entering a low luminescence setting.&lt;ref name="Watson"&gt;Watson, S., &amp; Gorski, K. A. (2011). Invasive cardiology: A manual for cath lab personnel. (3rd ed., pp. 61-62). Sudbury, MA: Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning.&lt;/ref&gt;  This practise will allow an individual to maintain their photopic (day) vision whilst preparing for scotopic vision.  The insensitivity to red light will prevent the rod cells from further becoming bleached and allow for the rhodopsin photopigment to recharge back to its active conformation.&lt;ref name="Abbott"/&gt;  Once an individual enters a dark setting most of their rod cells will already be accommodated to the dark and be able to transmit visual signals to the brain without an accommodation period.&lt;ref name="Watson"/&gt;

The concept of red lenses for dark adaptation is based upon experimentation by Antoine Béclère and his early work with radiology.  In 1916, the scientist Wilhelm Trendelenburg invented the first pair of [[red adaptation goggles]] for radiologists to adapt their eyes to view screens during fluoroscopic procedures.

==== Evolutionary context ====
Although many aspects the human visual system remain uncertain, the theory of the evolution of rod and cone photopigments is agreed upon by most scientists.  It is believed that the earliest visual pigments were those of cone photoreceptors, with rod opsin proteins evolving later.&lt;ref name="Bowmaker"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Link | year = 1998| title =  Evolution of colour vision in vertebrates| doi = 10.1038/eye.1998.143| pmid =  9775215| journal = Eye | volume = 12 | issue = 3| pages = 541–547 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Following the evolution of mammals from their reptilian ancestors approximately 275 million years ago there was a nocturnal phase in which complex colour vision was lost.&lt;ref name="Bowmaker"/&gt;  Being that these pro-mammals were nocturnal they increased their sensitivity in low luminescence settings and reduced their photopic system from tetrachromatic to dichromatic.&lt;ref name="Bowmaker"/&gt;  The shift to a nocturnal lifestyle would demand more rod photoreceptors to absorb the blue light emitted by the moon during the night.&lt;ref name="Roberts"&gt;[http://www.photobiology.info/Roberts-CR.html Link], Roberts, J. E. (2010). Circadian rhythm and human health.&lt;/ref&gt;  It can be extrapolated that the high ratio of rods to cones present in modern human eyes was retained even after the shift from nocturnal back to diurnal.
	It is believed that the emergence of [[trichromacy]] in primates occurred approximately 55 million years ago when the surface temperature of the planet began to rise.&lt;ref name="Bowmaker"/&gt;  The primates were diurnal rather than nocturnal in nature and therefore required a more precise photopic visual system.  A third cone photopigment was necessary to cover the entire visual spectrum enabling primates to better discriminate between fruits and detect those of the highest nutritional value.&lt;ref name="Bowmaker"/&gt;

====Applications ====
*Aviators commonly wear red lensed glasses or goggles prior to taking off in the dark to ensure that they are able to see outside of the aircraft.  Furthermore, throughout flight the cock pit is illuminated with dim red lights.  This lighting is to ensure that the pilot is able to read instruments and maps while maintaining scotopic vision for looking outside.&lt;ref name="Federal"&gt;[https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/aim/aim0801.html Link] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150326041755/https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/aim/aim0801.html |date=March 26, 2015 }}, Federal Aviation Administration. (2015). Medical facts for pilots.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Submarines: Oftentimes submarines are “rigged for red,” meaning that the boat is going to be surfacing or coming to periscope depth at night.  During such times illumination within certain compartments is switched to red light to allow the eyes of the lookouts and officers to adjust to the darkness prior to looking outside of the boat.  Additionally, compartments on a submarine may be illuminated with red light in order to simulate night conditions for the crew.&lt;ref name="Summitt"&gt;Summitt, D. (2004).

=== Vitamin A ===
{{See also|Vitamin A}}
[[File:11-cis-Retinal2.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|11-cis-Retinal2]]
[[Vitamin A]] is necessary for proper functioning of the human eye.  The photopigment rhodopsin found in human rod cells is composed of retinal, a form of vitamin A, bound to an opsin protein.&lt;ref name="Wolf"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 =  | first1 =  | year = | title = The discovery of the visual function of vitamin A | url = | journal = The Journal of Nutrition | volume = 131 | issue = | pages = 1647–1650 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Upon the absorption of light rhodopsin was decomposed into retinal and opsin through bleaching.&lt;ref name="Wolf"/&gt;  Retinal could then have one of two fates: it could recombine with opsin to reform rhodopsin or it could be converted into free retinol.&lt;ref name="Wolf"/&gt;  The American scientist George Wald was the first to recognize that the visual system expends vitamin A and is dependent upon diet for its replacement.&lt;ref name="Wolf"/&gt;
Vitamin A serves many functions in the human body outside of healthy vision.  It is vital in maintaining a healthy immune system as well as promoting normal growth and development.&lt;ref name="Dieticians"&gt;[http://www.dietitians.ca/Your-Health/Nutrition-A-Z/Vitamins/Food-Sources-of-Vitamin-A.aspx Link], Dieticians of Canada. (2014). Food sources of vitamin a.&lt;/ref&gt;  The average adult male and female should consume 900 and 700 micrograms of vitamin A per day, respectively.&lt;ref name="Dieticians"/&gt;  Consumption above 3000 micrograms per day is referred to as vitamin A toxicity and is usually caused by accidental ingestion of supplements.&lt;ref name="Johnson"&gt;[http://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/nutritional_disorders/vitamin_deficiency_dependency_and_toxicity/vitamin_a.html Link],  Johnson, L. E. (2014). Vitamin a.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Sources of vitamin A ====
Vitamin A is present in both animal and plant sources as retinoids and carotenoids, respectively.&lt;ref name="Dieticians"/&gt;  Retinoids can be used immediately by the body upon absorption into the cardiovascular system; however, plant-based carotenoids must be converted to retinol prior to utilization by the body.&lt;ref name="Dieticians"/&gt;  The highest animal-based sources of vitamin A are liver, dairy products, and fish.&lt;ref name="Dieticians"/&gt;  Fruits and vegetables containing high amounts of carotenoids are dark green, yellow, orange, and red in colour.&lt;ref name="Dieticians"/&gt;

==== Evolutionary context ====
Vitamin A-based opsin proteins have been used for sensing light in organisms for most of evolutionary history beginning approximately 3 billion years ago.&lt;ref name="Zhong"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zhong | first1 = M. | last2 = Kawaguchi | first2 = R. | last3 = Kassai | first3 = M. | last4 = Sun | first4 = H. | year = 2012 | title = Retina, retinol, retinal and the natural history of vitamin a as a light sensor | url = | journal = Nutrients | volume = 4 | issue = 12| pages = 2069–2096 | doi = 10.3390/nu4122069 | pmid = 23363998 | pmc = 3546623 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This feature has been passed from unicellular to multicellular organisms including Homo sapiens.&lt;ref name="Zhong"/&gt;  This vitamin was most likely selected by evolution for sensing light because retinal causes a shift in photoreceptor absorbance to the visible light range.&lt;ref name="Zhong"/&gt;  This shift in absorbance is especially important for life on Earth because it generally matches the peak irradiance of sunlight on its surface.&lt;ref name="Zhong"/&gt;  A second reason why retinal evolved to be vital for human vision is because it undergoes a large conformational change when exposed to light.&lt;ref name="Zhong"/&gt;  This conformational change is believed to make it easier for the photoreceptor protein to distinguish between its silent and activated state thus better controlling visual phototransduction.&lt;ref name="Zhong"/&gt;

==== Experimental evidence ====
Various studies have been conducted testing the effective of vitamin A supplementation on dark adaptation.  In a study by Cideciyan et al. the length of dark adaptation was measured in a patient with systemic vitamin A deficiency (VAD) before and after vitamin A supplementation.&lt;ref name="Cid"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = | first1 =  | year = | title = Rod plateaux during dark adaptation in sorsby's fundus dystrophy and vitamin a deficiency | url = | journal = Investigative Ophthalmology &amp; Visual Science | volume = 38 | issue = 9| pages = 1786–1794 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The dark adaptation function was measured prior to supplementation, 1 day post-treatment, and 75 days post-treatment.  It was observed that after merely one day of vitamin A supplementation the recovery kinetics of dark adaptation were significantly accelerated after photoreceptor bleaching.&lt;ref name="Cid"/&gt;  Dark adaptation was further accelerated following 75 days of treatment.&lt;ref name="Cid"/&gt;
	  A subsequent study by Kemp et al. studied dark adaptation in subjects with [[primary biliary cirrhosis]] and [[Crohn’s disease]], both of which had vitamin A deficiency.&lt;ref name="Kemp"&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014483588800769 | doi=10.1016/S0014-4835(88)80076-9 | volume=46 | issue=2 | title=Visual function and rhodopsin levels in humans with vitamin A deficiency | year=1988 | journal=Experimental Eye Research | pages=185–197 | last1 = Kemp | first1 = Colin M. | last2 = Jacobson | first2 = Samuel G. | last3 = Faulkner | first3 = David J. | last4 = Walt | first4 = Robert W.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Within 8 days of oral supplementation of vitamin A both patients had their visual function restored to normal.&lt;ref name="Kemp"/&gt;  Furthermore, adaptation kinetics significantly improved in both subjects following supplementation.&lt;ref name="Kemp"/&gt;

=== Anthocyanins ===
{{See also|Anthocyanin}}
[[Anthocyanins]] make up the majority of the 4000 known [[flavonoid phytochemicals]].&lt;ref name="Lila"&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2004| journal = Journal of Biomedicine and Biotechnology | volume = 5 | issue = 5| pages = 306–313 | pmc=1082894 | pmid=15577194 | doi=10.1155/S111072430440401X | title=Anthocyanins and Human Health: An In Vitro Investigative Approach | last1 = Lila | first1 = MA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This group of approximately 600 bioactive antioxidants carries the strongest physiological effects of any plant compound.&lt;ref name="Sterling"&gt;[http://www.biolink.no/anthocyanins/category143.html Link] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402134152/http://www.biolink.no/anthocyanins/category143.html |date=April 2, 2015 }}, Sterling, M. (2001). What are anthocyanins?&lt;/ref&gt;  These chemicals are also the most visible of the flavonoid phytochemicals because they provide bright blue, red, or purple pigmentation to many plant species.&lt;ref name="Sterling"/&gt;  Anthocyanins also serve to protect the photosynthetic tissues from the direct rays of the sun.&lt;ref name="Inno"&gt;[http://www.innovateus.net/food/what-are-benefits-anthocyanidins], Innovateus. (n.d.). What are the benefits of anthocyanidins?&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition, the [[antioxidant]], anti-inflammatory, and vasoprotective properties of anthocyanins allow them to demonstrate diverse health effects.&lt;ref name="Sterling"/&gt;  In humans, anthocyanins are effective for a variety of health conditions including neurological damage, atherosclerosis, diabetes, as well as visual impairment.&lt;ref name="Inno"/&gt;  Anthocyanins frequently interact with other phytochemicals to potentiate biological effects; therefore, contributions from individual biomolecules remains difficult to decipher.&lt;ref name="Lila"/&gt;
As a result of anthocyanins providing bright colouration to flowers, the plants containing these phytochemicals are naturally successful in attracting pollinators such as birds and bees.&lt;ref name="Inno"/&gt;  The fruits and vegetables produced by such plants are also brightly pigmented attracting animals to eat them and disperse the seeds.&lt;ref name="Inno"/&gt;  Due to this natural mechanism anthocyanin-containing plants are widely abundant in most areas of the world.  The high abundance and distribution of anthocyanin-containing plants make it a natural food source for many animals.  Through fossil evidence it is known that these compounds were eaten in high amounts by primitive hominins.&lt;ref name="Sterling"/&gt;

During World Wars I and II British Air Force aviators were known to consume extensive amounts of bilberry jam.  The aviators consumed this anthocyanin-rich food due to its many visual benefits, included accelerated dark adaptation, which would be valuable for night bombing missions.&lt;ref name="Losso"&gt;Losso, J. N., Shahidi, F., &amp; Bagchi, D. (2007). Anti-angiogenic functional and medicinal foods. Boca Raton, FL: Taylor &amp; Francis Group.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Food sources ====
[[File:Blackberry fruits.jpg|thumb|Blackberry fruits]]
Brightly coloured fruits and vegetables are rich in anthocyanins.  This makes sense intuitively because anthocyanins offer pigmentation to plants.  Blackberries are the most anthocyanin-rich foods, containing 89-211 milligrams per 100 grams.&lt;ref name="Inno"/&gt;  Other foods that are rich in this phytochemical include red onions, blueberries, bilberries, red cabbage, and eggplant.&lt;ref name="Inno"/&gt;  The ingestion of any of these food sources will yield a variety of phytochemicals in addition to anthocyanins because they naturally exist together.&lt;ref name="Lila"/&gt;  The daily intake of anthocyanins is estimated to be approximately 200 milligrams in the average adult; however, this value can reach several grams per day if an individual is consuming flavonoid supplements.&lt;ref name="Lila"/&gt;

==== Effect on dark adaptation====
Anthocyanins accelerate dark adaptation in humans by enhancing the regeneration of the rod photopigment, rhodopsin.&lt;ref name="Tiru"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tirupula | first1 = K. C. | last2 = Balem | first2 = F. | last3 = Yanamala | first3 = N. | last4 = Klein-Seetharaman | first4 = J. | year = 2009 | title = ph-dependent interaction of rhodopsin with cyanidin-3-glucoside. 2. functional aspects | url = | journal = Photochemistry and Photobiology | volume = 85 | issue = 2| pages = 463–470 | doi=10.1111/j.1751-1097.2008.00533.x| pmid = 19267871 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Anthocyanins accomplish this by binding directly to opsin upon the degradation of rhodopsin to its individual constituents by light.&lt;ref name="Tiru"/&gt;  Once bound to opsin, the anthocyanin changes its structure thereby accelerating its access to the retinal binding pocket.  By having a diet rich in anthocyanins an individual is able to generate rhodopsin in shorter periods of time because of the increased affinity of opsin to retinal.&lt;ref name="Tiru"/&gt;  Through this mechanism an individual is able to accelerate dark adaptation and achieve night vision in a shorter period of time.

==== Supportive evidence ====
In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted by Nakaishi et al. a powdered anthocyanin concentrate derived from black currants was provided to a number of participants.&lt;ref name="Naka"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nakaishi | first1 = H. | last2 = Matsumoto | first2 = H. | last3 = Tominaga | first3 = S. | last4 = Hirayama | first4 = M. | year = 2000 | title = Effects of black currant anthocyanoside intake on dark adaptation and vdt work-induced transient refractive alteration in healthy humans | url = | journal = Alternative Medicine Review | volume = 5 | issue = 6| pages = 553–562 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{ums|date=December 2017}}  Participants received one of three doses of anthocyanins to measure if the result occurred in a dose-dependent manner.  The period of dark adaptation was measured prior to and two hours following supplementation in all participants.  Results from this experiment indicate that anthocyanins significantly accelerated dark adaptation at merely one dose level compared to the placebo.&lt;ref name="Naka"/&gt;{{ums|date=December 2017}}  Observing the data as a whole Nakaishi et al. concluded that anthocyanins effectively reduced the dark adaptation period in a dose-dependent manner.&lt;ref name="Naka"/&gt;{{ums|date=December 2017}}

==== Contradictory evidence ====
Despite the fact that many scientists believe anthocyanins to be beneficial in accelerating dark adaptation in humans, a study conducted by Kalt et al. in 2014 showed blueberry anthocyanins have no effect.  In this study two double-blind, placebo-controlled studies were conducted to examine dark adaptation following the intake of blueberry products.&lt;ref name="Kalt"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/jf503689c | pmid=25335781 | volume=62 | issue=46 | title=Blueberry Effects on Dark Vision and Recovery after Photobleaching: Placebo-Controlled Crossover Studies | year=2014 | journal=Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry | pages=11180–11189 | last1 = Kalt | first1 = Wilhelmina | last2 = McDonald | first2 = Jane E. | last3 = Fillmore | first3 = Sherry A. E. | last4 = Tremblay | first4 = Francois}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In neither study did the blueberry anthocyanin intake effect the length of dark adaptation.&lt;ref name="Kalt"/&gt;  From these results Kalt et al. concluded that blueberry anthocyanins provide no significant difference to the dark adaptation component of human vision.&lt;ref name="Kalt"/&gt;

== Light adaptation ==
With light adaptation, the eye has to quickly adapt to the background illumination to be able to distinguish objects in this background. The process for light adaptation occurs over a period of five minutes.

The photochemical reaction is:
: Rhodopsin ⇌ retinal + opsin

=== Increment threshold ===
[[File:Light adaptation.png|thumbnail|Schematic of the increment threshold curve of the rod system]]
Using increment threshold experiments, light adaptation can be measured clinically.&lt;ref&gt;H Davson. Physiology of the eye. 5th ed. London: Macmillan Academic and Professional Ltd.; 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; In an increment threshold experiment, a test stimulus is presented on a background of a certain [[luminance]], the stimulus is increased until the detection threshold is reached against the background. A monophasic or biphasic threshold versus intensity TVI curve is obtained through this method for both [[Photoreceptor cell|cones and rods]].

When the threshold curve for a single system (i.e., [[Photoreceptor cell|just cones or just rods]]) is taken in isolation it can be seen to possesses four sections:&lt;ref&gt;Aguilar M, Stiles WS. Saturation of the rod mechanism of the retina at high levels of stimulation. Opt Acta (Lond) 1954;1:59–65.&lt;/ref&gt;

;1. Dark light: The threshold in this portion of the TVI curve is determined by the dark/light level.  Sensitivity is limited by neural noise.  The background field is relatively low and does not significantly affect threshold.
;2. Square root law: This part of the curve is limited by quantal fluctuation in the background.  The visual system is usually compared with a theoretical construct called the ideal light detector.  To detect the stimulus, the stimulus must sufficiently exceed the fluctuations of the background (noise).
;3. Weber's law: Threshold increases with background [[luminance]] proportional to the square root of the background.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pages=337–350|pmid=13539843|pmc=1358805|year=1958|author1=Barlow|first1=H. B.|title=Temporal and spatial summation in human vision at different background intensities|journal=The Journal of Physiology|volume=141|issue=2|doi=10.1113/jphysiol.1958.sp005978}}&lt;/ref&gt;
;4. Saturation: At saturation, the rod system becomes unable to detect the stimulus.  This section of the curve occurs for the cone mechanism under high background levels.&lt;ref&gt;H Davson. Physiology of the eye. 5th ed. London: Macmillan Academic and Professional Ltd.; 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

== Insufficiency ==
{{main|Nyctalopia}}
[[File:P360 Onderdendam goed nachtzicht ns nachtblind.jpg|thumb|upright=2|Effect of night blindness. Left: good night vision. Right: nightblind.]]
Insufficiency of adaptation most commonly presents as insufficient adaptation to dark environment, called [[night blindness]] or ''nyctalopia''.&lt;ref name="Wolf"/&gt; The opposite problem, known as [[hemeralopia]], that is, inability to see clearly in bright light, is much rarer.

The [[Fovea centralis in macula|fovea]] is blind to dim light (due to its cone-only array) and the rods are more sensitive, so a dim star on a moonless night must be [[Averted vision|viewed from the side]], so it stimulates the rods. This is not due to pupil width since an artificial fixed-width pupil gives the same results.&lt;ref name="eye, human" /&gt;

Night blindness can be caused by a number of factors the most common of which being vitamin A deficiency.  If detected early enough nyctalopia can be reversed and visual function can be regained; however; prolonged vitamin A deficiency can lead to permanent visual loss if left untreated.&lt;ref name="Clifford"&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2013| title = Reversible night blindness – a reminder of the increasing importance of vitamin a deficiency in the developed world | url = | journal = Journal of Optometry | volume = 6 | issue = 3| pages = 173–174 | doi=10.1016/j.optom.2013.01.002 | last1 = Clifford | first1 = Luke J. | last2 = Turnbull | first2 = Andrew M.J. | last3 = Denning | first3 = Anne M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Night blindness is especially prominent in developing countries due to [[malnutrition]] and therefore a lack of vitamin A in the diet.&lt;ref name="Clifford"/&gt;  In developed countries night blindness has historically been uncommon due to adequate food availability; however, the incidence is expected to increase as obesity becomes more common.  Increased obesity rates correspond to an increased number of bariatric surgeries, causing malabsorption of vitamin A in the human body.&lt;ref name="Clifford"/&gt;

'''Antithetic parallelism''' is a form of [[parallelism (rhetoric)|parallelism]] where the meaning of two or more excerpts of text are observed, although directly linked by providing the same meaning from differing perspectives. This type of [[parallelism (rhetoric)|parallelism]] is used in order to create repetition of meaning as a technique for cognitive reinforcement, thus more effectively communicating the meaning of the text.

== Examples ==

Examples of antithetic parallelism are found in [[Biblical poetry|Hebrew poetry]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Antithetical Structure in Biblical Hebrew Poetry | last1=Krašovec | first1=Jože | isbn=9789004275584 | year=1984 | doi=10.1163/9789004275584 }}&lt;/ref&gt; especially in [[Psalms]] of the Bible:

The young lions lack and suffer hunger;
&lt;br /&gt;
But those who seek the LORD shall not lack any good thing. ([[Psalms]] 34:10)

More specifically, antithetical parallelism is defined as text where the meaning in the first part of the [[couplet]] contrasts with an opposite theme contained in the second part (see above). The use of opposites clarifies both extremes. In [[poetry]] the use of opposites can bring a sharper contrast to an image and provide a greater focus to the desired message. It is often marked by the use of the conjunction ‘but’, placed between two statements to juxtapose them and helps the reader or to view both the positive and negative perspectives of the text.

Antithetic parallelism is not to be confused with 'synonymous' or 'synthetic' [[parallelism (rhetoric)|parallelism]], which reflect repeated and expansive ideas respectively.

'''Arthropodology''' (from Greek {{lang|el|[[:wikt:ἄρθρον|ἄρθρον]]}} - ''arthron'', "joint", and {{lang|el|[[:wikt:πούς|πούς]]}}, ''gen''.: {{lang|el|[[:wikt:ποδός|ποδός]]}} - ''pous'', ''podos'', "foot", which together mean "jointed feet") is a biological discipline concerned with the study of [[arthropod]]s,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.museumstuff.com/learn/topics/Arthropodology Etymology-Museum of Learning.&lt;/ref&gt; a phylum of [[animal]]s that include the [[insect]]s, [[arachnid]]s, [[crustacean]]s and others that are characterized by the possession of jointed limbs.

This field is very important in medicine, studied together with [[parasitology]]. Medical arthropodology is the study of the parasitic effect of arthropods, not only as parasites but also as vectors. The first annual '' Conference on Medical Arthropodology'' was held in [[Madurai]] ([[Tamil Nadu]]) in 2007.

'''Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational Sciences (ARIES)''' is a leading research institute in [[Nainital]], [[Uttarakhand]] which specializes in [[Astronomy]], [[Astrophysics]] and [[Atmospheric Sciences]]. An autonomous body under the [[Department of Science and Technology (India)|Department of Science and Technology]] (DST), [[Government of India]], the institute is situated at Manora Peak (1,951 m (6,401&amp;nbsp;ft)), about 9&amp;nbsp;km from [[Nainital]], a popular hill station.&lt;ref name="ni"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nainital.nic.in/observatory.htm |title=Local attractions: Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational Sciences (ARIES) |publisher=[[Nainital district]] official website |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100829134618/http://nainital.nic.in/observatory.htm |archivedate=29 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Observatory#Astronomical observatories|astronomical observatory]] is open to the public during working days on afternoons. For night viewing however, three - four days on moonlight nights are fixed and prior permission is needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nainitaltourism.com/observatory_aries.html|title=OBSERVATORY ( Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational Sciences (ARIES)|publisher=Official Nainital tourism website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The institute was started on 20 April 1954 under the supervision of Dr.A.N.Singh as Uttar Pradesh State Observatory (UPSO) in the premises of the [[Govt. Sanskrit College]], presently known as [[Sampurnanand Sanskrit University]], [[Varanasi]], [[Uttar Pradesh]].
With the creation of the State of [[Uttarakhand]] on 9 Nov 2000, and because of its geographical location within the boundaries of [[Uttarakhand]], UPSO came under the administrative control of the new government and was re-christened as the State Observatory (SO). Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational Sciences (ARIES) was its new name when it came under the Department of Science &amp; Technology (DST), Govt. of India as an autonomous body on 22 March 2004.

==Research facilities==
===Astronomy and Astrophysics===
[[File:Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Belgian PM Charles Michel activate the ARIES Telescope located in Uttarakhand.jpg|thumb|300px|Prime Minister [[Narendra Modi]] and Belgian Prime Minister [[Charles Michel]] remotely activate the ARIES telescope from [[Brussels]] on 30 March 2016.]]
Research activities at ARIES cover topics related to the sun, stars and galaxies. ARIES has made significant contributions particularly to the field of star clusters and Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs). The longitude of ARIES (79° East) locates it in the middle of a 180-degree wide longitude band having modern astronomical facilities lying between the Canary Islands (20° West) and Eastern Australia (157° East).Observations, which are not possible in Canary Islands or Australia due to daylight, can be made at ARIES. Because of its geographical location and existence of good astronomical observation sites, ARIES has made unique contributions to many areas of astronomical research, particularly those involving time critical phenomena (e.g., the first successful attempt in the country to observe optical afterglow of GRBs was carried out from ARIES). A large number of eclipsing binaries, variable stars, star clusters, nearby galaxies, GRBs, and supernova have been observed from ARIES. The other research fields of the institute include solar astronomy, stellar astronomy, star clusters, stellar variability and pulsation, photometric studies of nearby galaxies, Quasars, and transient events like supernovae and highly energetic Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs). A total solar eclipse lasting about 4 minutes was successfully observed from Manavgat, Antalya in Turkey on 29 March 2006 by a team of scientists from the Institute.

In past, new ring systems around Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune were discovered from the observatory. Recently, for the first time a direct correlation between the intra-night optical variability and the degree of polarization of the radio jets in Quasars was established based on the observations from ARIES. For the first time periodic oscillations are detected in optical intra day variability data of blazers which is extremely useful to get the blackhole mass of blazers and also provide a strong support to accretion disk based models of AGN.

===Atmospheric Sciences===
Nainital (29.40N; 79.50E, 1958 m amsl) is located at a high altitude in the Central Himalayas and away from urban cities or any major pollution source. This factor makes it very suitable for carrying out observations in background condition and to study the regional environment, particularly interactions between natural and anthropogenic trace species and climate change. Additionally, the ARIES site can also provide information on long range transport of pollutants. Studies on lower atmospheric dynamics are also very important in this region, which is severely lacking over northern India.

==Infrastructure==
The Institute has in-house workshops to meet the requirements of electronic, mechanical, and optical maintenance of the instruments. ARIES has a modern computer center with internet facility and a well maintained library with more than 10,000 volumes of research journals and an excellent collection of books on Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics and Atmospheric Sciences.

'''Bonapartism''' is the political ideology of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] and his followers and successors. It was later used to refer to people who hoped to restore the [[House of Bonaparte]] and its style of government. After Napoleon, the term was applied to the French politicians who seized power in the [[coup of 18 Brumaire]], ruling in the [[French Consulate]] and subsequently in the [[First French Empire|First]] and [[Second French Empire|Second]] French Empires under the [[House of Bonaparte]] (the family of Bonaparte and his nephew [[Napoleon III of France|Louis-Napoleon]]). The term was used more generally for a political movement that advocated a dictatorship or [[authoritarian]] [[centralized government|centralized state]], with a [[strongman (political)|strongman]] charismatic leader based on [[populism|anti-elitist]] rhetoric, army support, and conservatism.

[[Marxism]] and [[Leninism]] developed a vocabulary of political terms that included Bonapartism, derived from their analysis of the career of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]. [[Karl Marx]] was a student of [[Jacobinism]] and the [[French Revolution]], and was a contemporary critic of the [[French Second Republic|Second Republic]] and [[Second French Empire|Second Empire]]. He used "Bonapartism" to refer to a situation in which counter-revolutionary military officers seize power from revolutionaries, and use selective reforms to co-opt the radicalism of the popular classes. Marx argued that in the process, Bonapartists preserve and mask the power of a narrower ruling class.

According to his essay "[[The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon]]" (1852), Marx believed that both Napoleon and his nephew [[Napoleon III]] had corrupted revolutions in [[France]] in this way. In this document, he drew attention to what he calls the phenomenon's repetitive history by saying: "Hegel remarks somewhere that all great world-historic facts and personages appear, so to speak, twice. He forgot to add: the first time as tragedy, the second time as farce."

More generally, "Bonapartism" may be used to describe the replacement of civilian leadership by military leadership within revolutionary movements or governments. Many &lt;!--who, specifically, with cite to RS --&gt;modern-day [[Trotskyism|Trotskyists]] and other leftists use the phrase "left Bonapartist" to describe those, such as [[Stalin]] and [[Mao Zedong|Mao]], who controlled 20th-century bureaucratic socialist regimes. In addition, [[Leon Trotsky]] was accused of using his position as commander of the [[Red Army]] to gain top-level power after [[Lenin]]'s death.

Noted political scientists and historians greatly differ on the definition and interpretation of Bonapartism. Sudhir Hazareesingh's book ''The Legend of Napoleon'' explores numerous interpretations of the term. He says that it refers to a 
"popular national leader confirmed by popular election, above party politics, promoting equality, progress, and social change, with a belief in religion as an adjunct to the State, a belief that the central authority can transform society and a belief in the 'nation' and its glory and a fundamental belief in national unity."{{cn|date=December 2015}} Hazareesingh believes that although recent research shows Napoleon used forced conscription of French troops, some men must have fought believing in Napoleon's ideals. He says that to argue Bonapartism co-opted the masses is an example of the Marxist perspective of [[false consciousness]]: the idea that the masses can be manipulated by a few determined leaders in the pursuit of ends. 

==Ideology==

Philosophically, Bonapartism was Napoleon's adaptation of principles of the [[French Revolution]] to suit his imperial form of rule. Desires for public order, French national glory, and emulation of the [[Roman Empire]] had combined to create a [[Caesarism|Caesarist]] ''coup d'etat'' for General Bonaparte on [[18 Brumaire]]. Though he espoused adherence to revolutionary precedents, he "styled his direct and personal rule on the Old Regime monarchs."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Truesdell |first=Matthew |title=Spectacular Politics: Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte and the Fête impériale, 1849-1870 |year=1997 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-510689-3|page=58|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8f1SwirhmHMC&amp;pg=PA58 |accessdate=18 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For Bonapartists, the most significant lesson of the Revolution was that unity of government and the governed was paramount. 

The [[Bee (mythology)|honey bee]] was a prominent political emblem for both the First and Second Empires.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.napoleon.org/en/essential_napoleon/symbols/index.asp#abeilles |title=History of the Two Empires: The Symbols of Empire |author= |year=2008 |publisher=Fondation Napoléon |accessdate=17 September 2011 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It represents the Bonapartist ideal of devoted service, self-sacrifice and social loyalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Englund |first=Steven  |title=Napoleon: A Political Life |year=2005 |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=978-0-674-01803-7 |page=240 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N-ZJbxGwU4cC&amp;pg=PA240|accessdate=18 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The defining characteristics of political Bonapartism were flexibility and adaptability. [[Napoleon III]] once commented on the diversity of opinions in his cabinet, united under the banner of Bonapartism. Referring to the leading figures in the government of the [[French Second Empire|Second Empire]], he remarked: "The [[Empress Eugenie|Empress]] is a [[Legitimist]], [[Duc de Morny|Morny]] is an [[Orléanist]], [[Prince Napoléon Bonaparte|Prince Napoleon]] is a [[republicanism|Republican]], and I myself am a [[Socialist]]. There is only one Bonapartist, [[Persigny]]&amp;nbsp;–  and he is mad!"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Jerrold |first=Blanchard |title=The Life of Napoleon III |year=1882 |publisher=Longmans, Green |location=London |page=378 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hbUwAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA378|accessdate=18 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
[[File:Common Violet.JPG|thumb|During his exile to Elba (1814–1815), Napoleon Bonaparte announced he would return in the spring. The violet became a symbol of this and of Bonapartism.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Lindsay|first=Suzanne G.|title=Funerary Arts and Tomb Cult: Living with the Dead in France, 1750-1870|year=2012|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-1-4094-2261-7|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=pONxfBACLPUC&amp;pg=PA172 172] (footnote 16)}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In [[France|French]] [[politics|political]] history, ''[[Bonapartiste]]s'' were [[monarchist]]s who desired a French Empire under the House of Bonaparte, the [[Corsica]]n family of [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]] (Napoleon I of France) and his nephew Louis-Napoleon ([[Napoleon III of France]]).

Bonapartism developed after Napoleon I was exiled to [[Elba]]. The Bonapartists helped him regain his power, leading to the [[Hundred Days]] period. Some of his acolytes could not accept his defeat in 1815 at [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]] or the [[Congress of Vienna]], and continued to promote the Bonaparte ideology. After Napoleon I's death in exile on [[Saint Helena]] in 1821, many of these people transferred their allegiance to other members of his family. After the death of Napoleon's son, the Duke of Reichstadt (known to Bonapartists as [[Napoleon II]]), Bonapartist hopes rested on several different members of the family.&lt;ref name=Riff1990&gt;{{Cite book|last=Riff |first=Michael A.|title=Dictionary of Modern Political Ideologies |year=1990 |publisher=Manchester University Press |isbn=978-0-7190-3289-9|page=33 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jh4NAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA33|accessdate=18 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The disturbances of 1848 gave hope to the nascent political undercurrent. Bonapartism, as an ideology of politically neutral French peasants and workers (EJ Hobsbawm), was essential in the election of Napoleon I's nephew Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte as [[President of France|President]] of the [[French Second Republic|Second Republic]], and gave him the political support necessary for his 1852 discarding of the constitution and proclaiming the [[Second French Empire|Second Empire]]. Louis Napoleon Bonaparte assumed the title [[Napoleon III]] to acknowledge the brief reign of Napoleon's son Napoleon II at the end of the [[Hundred Days]] in 1815 (see the [[abdication of Napoleon (1815)|abdication of Napoleon I]] in 1815).

In 1870, the [[French National Assembly]] forced Napoleon III to sign a declaration of war against Prussia; France suffered a disastrous defeat in the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. The emperor surrendered to the Prussians and their German allies to avoid further bloodshed at the [[Battle of Sedan (1870)]]. He went into exile after a parliamentary coup created the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Acton|first=Lord |authorlink=John Dalberg-Acton, 1st Baron Acton |title=The Cambridge Modern History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SNFmAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA495|accessdate=18 September 2011|year=1909|publisher=Macmillan Co. |location=New York |page=495ff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bonapartists continued to agitate for another member of the family to be placed on the throne. From 1871 forward, they competed with [[Monarchist]] groups that favoured the restoration of the family of [[Louis-Philippe]], [[King of the French]] (1830–1848) (the [[Orléanist]]s), and also with those who favoured the restoration of the [[House of Bourbon]], the traditional French [[royal family]] ([[Legitimist]]s). The strength of these three factions combined was powerful, but they did not unite on the choice of the new French monarch. Monarchist fervor eventually waned, and the French Republic became more or less a permanent facet of French life. Bonapartism was slowly relegated to being the civic faith of a few romantics as more of a hobby than a practical political philosophy. The death knell for Bonapartism was probably sounded when [[Eugène Bonaparte]], the only son of Napoleon III, was [[Anglo-Zulu War|killed in action]] while serving as a [[British Army]] officer in [[Zulu Kingdom|Zululand]] in 1879. Thereafter Bonapartism ceased to be a significant political force.

The current head of the Bonaparte family is the Prince Napoleon, great-great-great-grandson of Napoleon I's brother Jérôme Bonaparte, [[Jean-Christophe, Prince Napoléon|Jean-Christophe Napoléon]] (born 1986). There are no remaining descendants in the male line from any other of Napoleon's brothers. There is no serious political movement that aims to restore any of these men to the imperial throne of France.

==Bonapartist claimants==
[[File:Pierson - Jérôme Bonaparte.jpg|thumb|Jérôme Bonaparte, founder of the legitimate line]]

After becoming Emperor in 1804, Napoleon I established a Law of Succession, providing that the Bonapartist claim to the throne should pass firstly to Napoleon's own legitimate male descendants through the male line. At that time he had no legitimate sons, and it seemed unlikely he would have any due to the age of his wife [[Joséphine de Beauharnais|Joséphine]]. He eventually achieved an annulment, without Papal approval, of his marriage to Josephine. He married the younger [[Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma]], with whom he had one son. 

The law of succession provided that if Napoleon's own direct line died out, the claim passed first to his older brother Joseph and his legitimate male descendants through the male line, then to his younger brother Louis and his legitimate male descendants through the male line. His other brothers, Lucien and Jerome, and their descendants, were omitted from the succession (even though Lucien was older than Louis) because they had either politically opposed the Emperor or made marriages of which he disapproved. Napoleon abdicated in favor of his son after his defeat in 1815. Although the Bonapartes were deposed and the old Bourbon monarchy restored, Bonapartists recognized this child as Napoleon II. A sickly child, he was virtually imprisoned in Austria, and died young and unmarried, without any descendants. When the Bonaparte Empire was restored to power in France in 1852, the Emperor was Napoleon III, [[Louis Bonaparte]]'s only living legitimate son (their brother Joseph having died in 1844 without having had a legitimate son, only daughters).

In 1852, Napoleon III enacted a new decree on the succession. The claim was given to his own male legitimate descendants in the male line (though at that time he had no son, Louis later had a legitimate son, [[Eugène Bonaparte]], who was recognized by Bonapartists as "Napoleon IV" before dying young and unmarried). If Napoleon III's line died out, he decreed that the claim should pass to Jerome, Napoleon's youngest brother (who had previously been excluded), and his male descendants by Princess [[Catharina of Württemberg]] in the male line. (Excluded were his descendants by his first marriage, to the American commoner [[Elizabeth Patterson Bonaparte|Elizabeth Patterson]], of which Napoleon I had greatly disapproved.) The Bonapartist claimants since 1879, have been the descendants of Jerome and Catherine of Württemberg in the male line.

The Bonapartist laws of succession were far from traditional. The family members ignored [[primogeniture]] (by excluding [[Lucien Bonaparte]] and his descendants); they annulled marriages to achieve their goals; and they did not submit to the Pope's rights as final arbiter on the validity of marriages. The very claim of the Bonaparte family to rule France was far from traditional.

==Marxism==

Based on the career of [[Louis Bonaparte]], [[Marxism]] and [[Leninism]] defined Bonapartism as a political expression.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1852/18th-brumaire/], Marxists website&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karl Marx]] was a student of [[Jacobinism]] and the [[French Revolution]], as well as a contemporary critic of the [[French Second Republic|Second Republic]] and [[Second French Empire|Second Empire]]. He used the term ''[[Bonapartism (Marxism)|Bonapartism]]'' to refer to a situation in which [[counterrevolutionary]] military officers seize power from [[revolutionaries]], and use selective [[reformism]] to co-opt the radicalism of the masses. In the process, Marx argued, Bonapartists preserve and mask the power of a narrower [[ruling class]]. He believed that both Napoleon I and Napoleon III had corrupted revolutions in France in this way.  Marx offered this definition of and analysis of Bonapartism in ''[[The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte]]'', written in 1852. In this document, he drew attention to what he calls the phenomenon's repetitive history with one of his most quoted lines, typically condensed aphoristically as: "History repeats itself, first as tragedy, then as farce."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Surveys in Exile |last=Marx |first=Karl |authorlink=Karl Marx |editor=David Fernbach |year=1973 |publisher=Penguin |location=Harmondsworth, UK |isbn=978-0-14-021603-5 |page=146 |quote=Hegel remarks somewhere that all great events and characters of world history occur, so to speak, twice. He forgot to add: the first time as tragedy, the second time as farce.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marx believed that a Bonapartist regime could exert great power, because there was no class with enough confidence or power to firmly establish its authority in its own name. A leader who appeared to stand above the class struggle could take the mantle of power. He believed that this was an inherently unstable situation, as the apparently all-powerful leader would be swept aside when the class struggle in society was resolved. 

[[Leon Trotsky]] described [[Joseph Stalin]]'s regime as Bonapartist, as he believed it was balanced between the [[proletariat]], victorious but shattered by war, and the [[bourgeoisie#The Marxist view|bourgeoisie]], broken by the revolution but struggling to re-emerge.  The failure of Stalin's regime to disintegrate under the shock and disruption of the losses of the Second World War, and the success of its expansion into Eastern Europe, challenged this analysis. Many [[Trotskyism|Trotskyists]] rejected the idea that Stalin's regime was Bonapartist. [[Tony Cliff]] described such regimes as [[State capitalism#Use by Trotskyists|state capitalist]] in type and not as deformed [[socialist state|workers' states]] at all. In the last year of his life, Trotsky argued the example of Napoleon's expanding empire. He had achieved the abolition of serfdom in Poland and other French holdings, but his empire was still "Bonapartist."

"Bonapartism" may be used generally to describe the replacement of civilian leadership by military leadership within revolutionary movements or governments. Some modern-day Trotskyists and others on the left use the phrase ''left Bonapartist'' to describe leaders such as Stalin and [[Mao Zedong]], who controlled left-wing or populist totalitarian regimes. Bonapartism was an example of the Marxist idea of false consciousness: the masses could be manipulated by a few determined leaders in the pursuit of ends.

==Bonapartism in the French political spectrum==

According to historian [[René Rémond]]'s famous 1954 book, ''Les Droites en France'', Bonapartism constitutes one of the three French [[right-wing]] families; the latest one after [[far-right]] [[Legitimism]] and [[center-right]] [[Orleanism]]. Both [[Boulangisme]] and [[Gaullism]] would be forms of Bonapartism.

However, Bonapartists have consistently disagreed with this classification, as one of the fundamentals of Bonapartism as an ideology is the refusal to adhere to the left-right divide, which they see as an obstacle to the welfare and unity of the nation. Martin S Alexander, in his book "French History since Napoleon" (London, Arnold, New York, Oxford University Press, 1999) notes that Bonapartism as an idea would not have made a significant impact if it had been classifiable as either left-wing or right-wing. The historian Jean Sagnes in "The roots of Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte's Socialism" notes that the future Emperor of the French edited his political works through far-left publishers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jean Sagnes |title= Les racines du socialisme de Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte |location= Toulouse |publisher= Privat |date= 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the Bonapartist philosophy would fit into the space occupied by the [[Socialist Party (France)|Parti Socialiste]], the [[Democratic Movement (France)|Mouvement Démocrate]], the [[European Social Liberal Party|Nouveau Centre]] and the left wing of the conservative [[Union pour un Mouvement Populaire]], as these parties occupy the ideological space between parties advocating class struggle and race-based politics, both of which are anathema to Bonapartists, as contrary to the ideal of national unity and religious and ethnic tolerance. This is demonstrated by Napoleonic policy towards industrial disputes, one expression of which&amp;nbsp;– as Frank McLynn writes&amp;nbsp;–  is that strikes were forbidden by Napoleon I but in exchange the police sometimes prevented wages from being lowered,{{sfnp|McLynn|1998|page=482}} while another is the [[Napoleon and the Jews|assimilation and protection of the Jews.]]

The Marxist theory of "Left" and "Right" Bonapartism can be considered an illustration of what McLynn refers to as Napoleon I's appeal in equal measure "to both the Right and the Left",{{sfnp|McLynn|1998|page=667}} and what Vincent Cronin describes as "middle of the way", or "moderate" government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Vincent Cronin |date=1994 |title=Napoleon |publisher=HarperCollins |chapter=Chapter 19 |page=301}}&lt;/ref&gt; Napoleon III situated Bonapartism (or the "Napoleonic Idea") between the radicals and conservatives (respectively the Left and the Right) in "Des Idées Napoléoniennes", published in 1839. He expounded on this point to explain that Bonapartism, as practiced by his uncle Napoleon the Great (and represented by himself) was in the middle of "two hostile parties, one of which looks only to the past, and the other only to the future" and combined "the old forms" of the one and the "new principles" of the other.

==Modern Bonapartism==
{{further|Neo-Bonapartism}}

In contemporary times, the term "Bonapartism" has been used in a general sense to describe autocratic, highly centralized regimes dominated by the military.&lt;ref name=Calhoun&gt;{{Cite book |last=Calhoun |first=Craig J. |authorlink=Craig Calhoun |title=Dictionary of the Social Sciences |year=2002 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford; New York |isbn=978-0-19-512371-5 |page=47|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pfISGq3aB2UC&amp;pg=PA47 |accessdate=18 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, an official ''Mouvement Bonapartiste'' exists, based in France, headed by Paul-Napoléon Pierre Calland with an unknown number of members around the world. Its official mission statement is as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"[T]o defend, make known and to spread the principles and values of Bonapartism. [The movement] is based on popular support for a policy of recovery combining the efforts of individuals, associations and State services. The movement defends the Bonapartist principles on which it is founded, and which govern its internal organisation. It also defends the memory of Napoleon the Great, as well as those of Napoleon III and their sons, Napoleon II and Napoleon IV. It recognises Napoleon IV as having reigned without governing, by virtue of the plebiscite of May 1870. The movement recognises no emperor after 1879, because of the absence of a plebiscite. Republican, it gives priority to the happiness, interest and glory of peoples, and envisages the restoration of the Empire only if the foundations of the regime are republican and approved by referendum."&lt;ref name=mouvementbonapartiste&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://mouvementbonapartiste.wordpress.com/2011/07/28/bonapartist-movement |title=Bonapartist Movement |year=2011 |publisher=Mouvement Bonapartiste |accessdate=18 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Climate resilience''' can be generally defined as the capacity for a [[socio-ecological system]] to: (1) absorb stresses and maintain function in the face of external stresses imposed upon it by [[climate change]] and (2) adapt, reorganize, and evolve into more desirable configurations that improve the [[sustainability]] of the system, leaving it better prepared for future climate change impacts.

With the rising awareness of climate change impacts by both national and international bodies, building climate resilience has become a major goal for these institutions. The key focus of climate resilience efforts is to address the vulnerability that communities, states, and countries currently have with regards to the environmental consequences of climate change. Currently, climate resilience efforts encompass social, economic, technological, and political strategies that are being implemented at all scales of society. From local community action to global treaties, addressing climate resilience is becoming a priority, although it could be argued that a significant amount of the theory has yet to be translated into practice. Despite this, there is a robust and ever-growing movement fueled by local  and national bodies alike geared towards building and improving climate resilience.

== Introduction==

=== Definition of climate resilience===
In actuality, there is still a great deal of abstract discussion and debate regarding a number of subtle nuances associated with the precise definition of the climate resilience perspective, such as its relation to [[climate change adaptation]], the extent to which it should encompass actor-based versus systems-based approaches to improving stability, and its relationship with the [[balance of nature]] theory or [[homeostatic]] equilibrium view of ecological systems. 
&lt;ref name="folke"/&gt;
Currently, the majority of work regarding climate resilience has been centered around examining the capacity for social-ecological systems to sustain shocks and maintain the integrity of functional relationships in the face of external forces. However, there is a growing consensus in academic literature which argues that greater attention needs to be focused on investigating the other critical aspect of climate resilience, which is the capacity for social-ecological systems to renew and develop, and to utilize disturbances as opportunities for innovation and evolution of new pathways that improve the system’s ability to adapt to macroscopic changes.
&lt;ref name="folke"/&gt;
&lt;ref name="tomkins"&gt;Tompkins, Emma L., and W. Neil Adger. 2004. "Does Adaptive Management of Natural Resources Enhance Resilience to Climate Change?" Ecology &amp; Society. http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/202863/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sharifi|first1=Ayyoob|last2=Yamagata|first2=Yoshiki|title=Principles and criteria for assessing urban energy resilience: A literature review|journal=Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews|date=July 2016|volume=60|pages=1654–1677|doi=10.1016/j.rser.2016.03.028}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sharifi|first1=Ayyoob|title=A critical review of selected tools for assessing community resilience|journal=Ecological Indicators|date=October 2016|volume=69|pages=629–647|doi=10.1016/j.ecolind.2016.05.023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate resilience vs. climate adaptation===

The fact that climate resilience encompasses a dual function, to absorb shock as well as to self-renew, is the primary means by which it can be differentiated from the concept of climate adaptation. In general, [[adaptation]] is viewed as a group of processes and actions that help a system absorb changes that have already occurred, or may be predicted to occur in the future. For the specific case of environmental change and climate adaptation, it is argued by many that adaptation should be defined strictly as encompassing only active decision-making processes and actions - in other words, deliberate changes made in response to climate change.
&lt;ref name="nelson" /&gt; 
Of course, this characterization is highly debatable: after all, adaptation can also be used to describe natural, involuntary processes by which [[organisms]], [[populations]], [[ecosystems]] and perhaps even social-ecological systems evolve after the application of certain external stresses. However, for the purposes of differentiating climate adaptation and climate resilience from a policymaking standpoint, we can contrast the active, actor-centric notion of adaptation with resilience, which would be a more systems-based approach to building social-ecological networks that are inherently capable of not only absorbing change, but utilizing those changes to develop into more efficient configurations.

===Inter-connectivity between climate resilience, climate change, adaptability, and vulnerability===
[[File:Climate Resilience Model.PNG|thumb|A graphic displaying the inter-connectivity between climate change, adaptability, vulnerability, and resilience.]]
A conversation about climate resilience is incomplete without also incorporating the concepts of adaptations, vulnerability, and [[global warming|climate change]]. If the definition of resiliency is the ability to recover from a negative event, in this case climate change, then talking about preparations beforehand and strategies for recovery (aka adaptations), as well as populations that are more less capable of developing and implementing a resiliency strategy (aka vulnerable populations) are essential. This is framed under the assumed detrimental impacts of climate change to ecosystems and [[ecosystem services]].&lt;ref&gt;Smit, Barry, and Johanna Wandel. "Adaptation, adaptive capacity and vulnerability." Global environmental change 16.3 (2006): 282-292.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical overview of climate resilience===

Climate resilience is a relatively novel concept that is still in the process of being established by academia and policymaking institutions. However, the theoretical basis for many of the ideas central to climate resilience have actually existed since the 1960s. Originally an idea defined for strictly ecological systems, [[Resilience (ecology)|resilience]] was initially outlined by C.S. Holling as the capacity for ecological systems and relationships within those systems to persist and absorb changes to “state variables, driving variables, and parameters.”
&lt;ref name="holling"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Holling | first1 = CS | year = 1973| title = Resilience and Stability of Ecological Systems | url = | journal = Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 1–23 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.es.04.110173.000245 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This definition helped form the foundation for the notion of ecological [[Island biogeography|equilibrium]]: the idea that the behavior of natural ecosystems is dictated by a homeostatic drive towards some stable set point. Under this school of thought (which maintained quite a dominant status during this time period), ecosystems were perceived to respond to disturbances largely through [[negative feedback]] systems – if there is a change, the ecosystem would act to mitigate that change as much as possible and attempt to return to its prior state. However, the idea of resilience began evolving relatively quickly in the coming years.

As greater amounts of scientific research in ecological adaptation and natural resource management was conducted, it became clear that oftentimes, natural systems were subjected to dynamic, transient behaviors that changed how they reacted to significant changes in state variables: rather than work back towards a predetermined equilibrium, the absorbed change was harnessed to establish a new baseline to operate under.  Rather than minimizes imposed changes, ecosystems could integrate and manage those changes, and use them fuel the evolution of novel characteristics. This new perspective of resilience as a concept that inherently works synergistically with elements of [[uncertainty]] and [[entropy]] first began to facilitate changes in the field of [[adaptive management]] and environmental resources, through work whose basis was built by Holling and colleagues yet again.
&lt;ref name="folke" /&gt;
&lt;ref name="schoon"&gt;Schoon, M. (2005, 2 21). A short historical overview of the concepts of resilience, vulnerability, and adaptation . Retrieved from http://michaelschoon.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/historical_critique-of-resilience-working-paper.pdf
&lt;/ref&gt;

By the mid 1970s, resilience began gaining momentum as an idea in [[anthropology]], [[culture theory]], and other [[social sciences]]. Even more compelling is the fact that there was significant work in these relatively non-traditional fields that helped facilitate the evolution of the resilience perspective as a whole. Part of the reason resilience began moving away from an equilibrium-centric view and towards a more flexible, malleable description of social-ecological systems was due to work such as that of Andrew Vayda and [[Bonnie McCay]] in the field of social anthropology, where more modern versions of resilience were deployed to challenge traditional ideals of cultural dynamics.
&lt;ref name="vayda"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Vayda | first1 = Andrew P. | authorlink2 = Bonnie McCay | last2 = McCay | first2 = Bonnie J. | year = 1975 | title = New Directions in Ecology and Ecological Anthropology | url = | journal = Annual Review of Anthropology | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 293–306 | doi=10.1146/annurev.an.04.100175.001453}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually by the late 1980s and early 1990s, resilience had fundamentally changed as a theoretical framework. Not only was it now applicable to social-ecological systems, but more importantly, resilience now incorporated and emphasized ideas of management, integration, and utilization of change rather than simply describing reactions to change. Resilience was no longer just about absorbing shocks, but also about harnessing the changes triggered by external stresses to catalyze the evolution the social-ecological system in question.

As the issues of [[global warming]] and climate change have gained traction and become more prominent since the early 1990s, the question of climate resilience has also emerged. Considering the global implications of the impacts induced by climate change, climate resilience has become a critical concept that scientific institutions, policymakers, governments, and international organizations have begun to rally around as a framework for designing the solutions that will be needed to address the [[effects of global warming]].

==Climate resilience and environmental justice==

=== Applications of a resilience framework: addressing vulnerability===

A climate resilience framework offers a rich plethora of contributions that can improve our understanding of environmental processes, and better equip governments and policymakers to develop sustainable solutions that combat the effects of climate change. To begin with, climate resilience establishes the idea of multi-stable socio-ecological systems. As discussed earlier, resilience originally began as an idea that extended from the stable equilibrium view – systems only acted to return to their pre-existing states when exposed to a disturbance. But with modern interpretations of resilience, it is now established that socio-ecological systems can actually stabilize around a multitude of possible states. Secondly, climate resilience has played a critical role in emphasizing the importance of [[preventive action]] when assessing the effects of climate change. Although adaptation is always going to be a key consideration, making changes after the fact has a limited capability to help communities and nations deal with climate change. By working to build climate resilience, policymakers and governments can take a more comprehensive stance that works to mitigate the harms of global warming impacts before they happen.&lt;ref name="nelson" /&gt; 
&lt;ref name="tschakert"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tschakert | first1 = P | last2 = Dietrich | first2 = K A | year = 2010 | title = Anticipatory Learning for Climate Change Adaptation and Resilience | url = | journal = Ecology and Society | volume = 15 | issue = | page = 11 | doi=10.5751/es-03335-150211}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Finally, a climate resilience perspective encourages greater cross-scale connectedness of systems. Climate change scholars have argued that solely relying on theories of adaptation is also limiting because inherently, this perspective does not necessitate as much full-system cohesion as a resilience perspective would. Creating mechanisms of adaptation that occur in isolation at local, state, or national levels may leave the overall social-ecological system vulnerable. A resilience-based framework would require far more cross-talk, and the creation of environmental protections that are more holistically generated and implemented.
&lt;ref name="nelson" /&gt;
&lt;ref name="malhi"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Malhi | first1 = Yadvinder | last2 = Roberts | first2 = J Timmons | last3 = Betts | first3 = Richard A | last4 = Killeen | first4 = Timothy J | last5 = Li | first5 = Wenhong | last6 = Nobre | first6 = Carlos A | year = 2008 | title = Climate Change, Deforestation, and the Fate of the Amazon | url = http://www.sciencemag.org/content/319/5860/169.abstract | journal = Science | volume = 319 | issue = 5860| pages = 169–72 | doi=10.1126/science.1146961| bibcode = 2008Sci...319..169M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vulnerability=== 
Negative impacts of climate change are those that are least capable of developing robust and comprehensive climate resiliency infrastructure and response systems. However what exactly constitutes a vulnerable community is still open to debate. 
The International Panel on Climate Change has defined vulnerability using three characteristics: the “adaptive capacity, sensitivity, and exposure” to the effects of climate change.  The adaptive capacity refers to a community’s capacity to create resiliency infrastructure, while the sensitivity and exposure elements are both tied to economic and geographic elements that vary widely in differing communities. There are, however, many commonalities between vulnerable communities.&lt;ref&gt;J.J. McCarthy, O.F. Canziani, N.A. Leary, D.J. Dokken, K.S. White (Eds.), Climate Change 2001: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt;

Vulnerability can mainly be broken down into 2 major categories, economic vulnerability, based on [[socioeconomic]] factors, and geographic vulnerability. Neither are mutually exclusive.

====Economic vulnerability====

[[File:GNI PPP Per Capita.png|thumb|World gross national income per capita.]]

At its basic level, a community that is economically vulnerable is one that is ill-prepared for the effects of climate change because it lacks the needed financial resources. Preparing a climate resilient society will require huge investments in infrastructure, city planning, engineering sustainable energy sources, and preparedness systems. From a global perspective, it is more likely that people living at or below poverty will be affected the most by climate change and are thus the most vulnerable, because they will have the least amount of resource dollars to invest in resiliency infrastructure.   They will also have the least amount of resource dollars for cleanup efforts after more frequently occurring natural climate change related disasters.&lt;ref&gt;M.J. Collier et al. "Transitioning to resilience and sustainability in urban communities" Cities 2013. 32:21–S28&lt;/ref&gt;

====Geographic vulnerability====
A second definition of vulnerability relates to geographic vulnerability. The most geographically vulnerable locations to climate change are those that will be impacted by side effects of natural hazards, such as rising sea levels and by dramatic changes in ecosystem services, including access to food.  Island nations are usually noted as more vulnerable but communities that rely heavily on a sustenance based lifestyle are also at greater risk.&lt;ref&gt;K. Hewitt (Ed.), Interpretations of Calamity for the Viewpoint of Human Ecology, Allen and Unwin, Boston (1983), pp. 231–262&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Abaco Islands 15ft 4p572 shaded.png|thumb|Abaco Islands- An example of a low elevation island community likely to be impacted by rising sea level associated with changing climate.]]

Roger E. Kasperson and Jeanne X. Kasperson of the Stockholm Environmental Institute compiled a list of vulnerable communities as having one or more of these characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;Kasperson, Roger E., and Jeanne X. Kasperson. Climate change, vulnerability, and social justice. Stockholm: Stockholm Environment Institute, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;
*food insecure 
*water scarce
*delicate marine ecosystem 
*fish dependent
*small island community

===Vulnerability and equity:  environmental justice and climate justice===
Equity is another essential component of vulnerability and is closely tied to issues of [[environmental justice]] and [[climate justice]].   Who participates in and who has access to climate resiliency services and infrastructure are more than likely going to fall along historically unequitable patterns of distribution.  As the most vulnerable communities are likely to be the most heavily impacted, a [[climate justice]] movement is coalescing in response. There are many aspects of climate justice that relate to resiliency and many climate justice advocates argue that justice should be an essential component of resiliency strategies.  
Similar frameworks that have been applied to the [[Climate Justice]] movement can be utilized to address some of these equity issues.  The frameworks are similar to other types of justice movements and include- contractariansim which attempts to allocate the most benefits for the poor, utilitarianism which seeks to find the most benefits for the most people, egalitarianism which attempts to reduce inequality, and libertarianism which emphasizes a fair share of burden but also individual freedoms.&lt;ref&gt;Liu, F. (2000). Environmental justice analysis: Theories, methods and practice. Boca Raton, FL: [[CRC Press]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act for Climate Justice Campaign [http://www.actforclimatejustice.org/about/what-is-climate-justice/] has defined climate justice as “a vision to dissolve and alleviate the unequal burdens created by climate change. As a form of environmental justice, climate justice is the fair treatment of all people and freedom from discrimination with the creation of policies and projects that address climate change and the systems that create climate change and perpetuate discrimination”.&lt;ref&gt;Act for Climate Justice. (February 2014)  What Is Climate Justice.  Retrieved from http://www.actforclimatejustice.org/about/what-is-climate-justice/&lt;/ref&gt;

Climate Justice can incorporate both grassroots as well as international and national level organizing movements.

====Local level issues of equity====
Many indigenous peoples live sustenance based lifestyles, relying heavily on local ecosystem services for their livelihoods. According to some definitions, indigenous peoples are often some of the most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and advocating for participation of marginalized groups is one goal of the indigenous people’s climate justice movement. Climate change will likely dramatically alter local food production capacity, which will impact those people who are more dependent on local food sources and less dependent on global or regional food supplies. The greatest injustice is that people living this type of lifestyle are least likely to have contributed to the causes of global climate change in the first place.  Indigenous peoples movements often involve protests and calling on action from world leaders to address climate change concerns.&lt;ref&gt;Chwala, A. Climate Justice Movements Gather Strength. Climate Connections. State of the World. (2009). 119-121&lt;/ref&gt;

Another local level climate justice movement is the adaptation finance approach  which has been found in some studies to be a positive solution by providing resource dollars directly to communities in need.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Barrett | first1 = Sam | year = 2013 | title = Local Level Climate Justice? Adaptation Finance and Vulnerability Reduction | url = | journal = Global Environmental Change | volume = 23 | issue = 6| pages = 1819–29 | doi=10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2013.07.015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====International and national climate justice ====
The [[carbon market]] approach is one international and national concept proposed that tries to solve the issue by using market forces to make carbon use less affordable, but vulnerable host communities that are the intended beneficiaries have been found to receive little to no benefit.&lt;ref name="Mather"&gt;Mathur, Vivek N., et al. "Experiences of Host Communities with Carbon Market Projects: Towards Multi-Level Climate Justice." Climate Policy 14.1 (2014): 42-62. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;  One problem noted with the carbon market approach is the inherent conflict of interest embedded between developed and sustenance based communities.  Developed nations that have often prioritized growth of their own [[gross national product]] over implementing changes that would address climate change concerns by taxing carbon which might damage GDP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Towers | first1 = G | year = 2000 | title = Applying the political geography of scale: Grassroots strategies and environmental justice | url = | journal = Professional Geographer | volume = 52 | issue = | pages = 23–36 | doi=10.1111/0033-0124.00202}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition the pace of change necessary to implement a carbon market approach is too slow to be effective at most international and national policy levels.&lt;ref name="Mather"/&gt;

Alternatively, a study by V.N Mather, et al. proposes a multi-level approach that focuses on addressing some primary issues concerning climate justice at local and international levels.  The approach includes:&lt;ref name="Mather"/&gt;
*developing the capacity for a carbon market approach
*focusing on power dynamics within local and regional government
*managing businesses in regard to carbon practices
*special attention given to developing countries

====Climate justice, environmental justice, and the United States====

The issue of [[environmental justice]] and [[climate justice]] is relevant within the United States because historically communities of color and low socioeconomic communities have been under served and underrepresented in terms of distribution and participation.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Dorceta E. "Women of color, environmental justice, and ecofeminism."Ecofeminism: Women, culture, nature (1997): 38-81&lt;/ref&gt;  The question of “by and for whom” resiliency strategies are targeted and implemented is of great concern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Friend | first1 = R. | last2 = Moench | first2 = M. | year = 2013 | title = What is the purpose of urban climate resilience?

[[File:New Orleans USACE-17th Canal-A-09-04-05 0004.JPG|thumb|New Orleans post Hurricane Katrina levee damage.]]

The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People[[NAACP]] has recently begun a Climate Justice campaign&lt;ref name=NAACP&gt;[http://www.naacp.org/programs/entry/climate-justice Climate Justice: NAACP]&lt;/ref&gt; in response to  events such as Hurricane Katrina and in preparation for future climate change related natural disasters.  The goal of this campaign is to address the 3 R’s of climate justice: resilience, resistance, and revisioning.   The NAACP’s climate justice initiative will address climate resilience through advocacy, outreach, political actions, research and education.&lt;ref name=NAACP/&gt;

=====Climate gap=====

Another concept important for understanding vulnerability in the United States is the [[climate gap]].  The climate gap is the inequitably negative impact on poor people and people of color due to the effects of climate change. Some of these negative impacts include higher cost of living expenses, higher incidences of heat related health consequences in urban areas that are likely to experience [[urban heat island]] effects, increased pollution in urban areas, and decreases in available jobs for poor people and people of color.  Some suggested solutions to close the climate gap include suggesting legislative policies that would reduce the impact of climate change by reducing [[carbon emissions]] with the emphasis of reductions in [[greenhouse gas emissions]] and toxic [[air pollution]] in neighborhoods that are already heavily impacted, usually urban centers.  Other solutions include increasing access to quality health care for poor people and people of color, preparedness planning for urban heat island effects, identifying neighborhoods that are most likely to be impacted, investing in alternative fuel and energy research, and measuring the results of policy impacts.&lt;ref name= "Schonkoff"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shonkoff | first1 = Seth B. | display-authors = etal   | year = 2011 | title = The climate gap: environmental health and equity implications of climate change and mitigation policies in California—a review of the literature | url = http://dornsife.usc.edu/assets/sites/242/docs/The_Climate_Gap_Full_Report_FINAL.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Climatic Change | volume = 109 | issue = 1| pages = 485–503 | doi=10.1007/s10584-011-0310-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theoretical foundations for building climate resilience==
As the threat of environmental disturbances due to [[climate change]] becomes more and more relevant, so does the need for strategies to build a more resilient society. As climate resiliency literature has revealed, there are different strategies and suggestions that all work towards the overarching goal of building and maintaining societal resiliency.

===Urban resilience===
There is increasing concern on an international level with regards to addressing and combating the impending implications of [[climate change]] for urban areas, where populations of these cities around the world are growing disproportionately high. There is even more concern for the rapidly growing urban centers in developing countries, where the majority of urban inhabitants are poor or “otherwise vulnerable to climate-related disturbances.”&lt;ref name=Moench&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Moench | first1 = Marcus | last2 = Tyler | first2 = Stephen | year = 2012 | title = A Framework for Urban Climate Resilience | url = | journal = Climate and Development | volume = 4 | issue = | page = 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Urban centers around the world house important societal and economic sectors, so resiliency framework has been augmented to specifically include and focus on protecting these urban systems.

The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) defines resilience as “the ability of a social or ecological system to absorb disturbances while retaining the same basic structure and ways of functioning, the capacity of self-organization, and the capacity to adapt to stress and change.”&lt;ref name=Moench/&gt;  One of the most important notions emphasized in urban resiliency theory is the need for urban systems to increase their capacity to absorb environmental disturbances. By focusing on three generalizable elements of the resiliency movement, Tyler and Moench’s urban resiliency framework serves as a model that can be implemented for local planning on an international scale.

The first element of urban climate resiliency focuses on “systems’ or the physical infrastructure embedded in urban systems. A critical concern of urban resiliency is linked to the idea of maintaining support systems that in turn enable the networks of provisioning and exchange for populations in urban areas.&lt;ref name=Moench/&gt;  These systems concern both physical infrastructure in the city and ecosystems within or surrounding the urban center; while working to provide essential services like food production, flood control, or runoff management.&lt;ref name=Moench/&gt;  For example, city electricity, a necessity of urban life, depends on the performance of generators, grids, and distant reservoirs. The failure of these core systems jeopardizes human well-being in these urban areas, with that being said, it is crucial to maintain them in the face of impending environmental disturbances. Societies need to build resiliency into these systems in order to achieve such a feat. Resilient systems work to “ensure that functionality is retained and can be re-instated through system linkages”&lt;ref name=Moench/&gt; despite some failures or operational disturbances. Ensuring the functionality of these important systems is achieved through instilling and maintaining flexibility in the presence of a “safe failure.”&lt;ref name=Moench/&gt;  Resilient systems achieve flexibility by making sure that key functions are distributed in a way that they would not all be affected by a given event at one time, what is often referred to as spatial diversity, and has multiple methods for meeting a given need, what is often referred to as functional diversity.&lt;ref name=Moench/&gt;  The presence of safe failures also plays a critical role in maintaining these systems, which work by absorbing sudden shocks that may even exceed design thresholds.&lt;ref name=Moench/&gt;  Environmental disturbances are certainly expected to challenge the dexterity of these systems, so the presence of safe failures almost certainly appears to be a necessity.

Further, another important component of these systems is bounce-back ability. In the instance where dangerous climatic events affect these urban centers, recovering or "bouncing-back" is of great importance. In fact, in most disaster studies, urban resilience is often defined as "the capacity of a city to rebound from destruction." This idea of bounce-back for urban systems is also engrained in governmental literature of the same topic. For example, the former government's first Intelligence and Security Coordinator of the United States described urban resilience as "the capacity to absorb shocks and to bounce back into functioning shape, or at the least, sufficient resilience to prevent...system collapse." Keeping these quotations in mind, bounce-back discourse has been and should continue to be an important part of urban climate resiliency framework.&lt;ref&gt;Coaffee, Jon. "Towards Next-Generation Urban Resilience in Planning Practice: From Securitization to Integrated Place Making." Planning Practice and Research 28:3. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Other theorists have critiqued this idea of bounce-back, citing this as privileging the status quo, rather advocating the notion of ‘bouncing forward’, permitting system evolution and improvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Insurance as maladaptation: Resilience and the ‘business as usual’ paradox|url = http://epc.sagepub.com/content/early/2015/09/01/0263774X15602022|journal = Environment and Planning C: Government and Policy|date = 2015-09-01|issn = 0263-774X|pages = 0263774X15602022|doi = 10.1177/0263774X15602022|language = en|first = Paul|last = O'Hare|first2 = Iain|last2 = White|first3 = Angela|last3 = Connelly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next element of urban climate resiliency focuses on the social agents (also described as social actors) present in urban centers. Many of these agents depend on the urban centers for their very existence, so they share a common interest of working towards protecting and maintaining their urban surroundings.&lt;ref name=Moench/&gt;  Agents in urban centers have the capacity to deliberate and rationally make decisions, which plays an important role in climate resiliency theory. One cannot overlook the role of local governments and community organizations, which will be forced to make key decisions with regards to organizing and delivering key services and plans for combating the impending effects of climate change.&lt;ref name=Moench/&gt;  Perhaps most importantly, these social agents must increase their capacities with regards to the notions of “resourcefulness and responsiveness.&lt;ref name=Moench/&gt;  Responsiveness refers to the capacity of social actors and groups to organize and re-organize, as well as the ability to anticipate and plan for disruptive events. Resourcefulness refers to the capacity of social actors in urban centers to mobilize varying assets and resources in order to take action.&lt;ref name=Moench/&gt;  Urban centers will be able to better fend for themselves in the heat of climatic disturbances when responsiveness and resourcefulness is collectively achieved in an effective manner.

The final component of urban climate resiliency concerns the social and political institutions present in urban environments. Governance, the process of decision making, is a critical element affecting climate resiliency. As climate justice has revealed, the individual areas and countries that are least responsible for the phenomenon of climate change are also the ones who are going to be most negatively affected by future environmental disturbances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Roberts | first1 = Timmons | year = 2009 | title = The International Dimension of Climate Justice and the Need for International Adaptation Funding | url = | journal = Environmental Justice | volume = 2 | issue = | page = 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The same is true in urban centers. Those who are most responsible for climate change are going to disproportionately feel the negative effects of climatic disturbances when compared to their poorer, more vulnerable counterparts in society. Just like the wealthier countries have worked to create the most pollution, the wealthier subpopulations of society who can afford carbon-emitting luxuries like cars and homes undoubtedly produce a much more significant carbon footprint. It is also important to note that these more vulnerable populations, because of their inferior social statuses, are unable to participate in the decision-making processes with regards to these issues. Decision-making processes must be augmented to be more participatory and inclusive, allowing those individuals and groups most affected by environmental disturbances to play an active role in determining how to best avoid them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lebel | first1 = L. | last2 = Anderies | first2 = J. M. | last3 = Campbell | first3 = B. | last4 = Folke | first4 = C. | last5 = Hatfield-Dodds | first5 = S. | last6 = Hughes | first6 = T.

Individual communities who have access to timely information with regards to hazards are better able to respond to these threats.&lt;ref&gt;Satterthwaite, D., Huq, S., Pelling, M., Reid, H., &amp; Lankao, P.R. (2007). Adapting to Climate Change in Urban Areas: The Possibilities and Constraints in Low- and Middle-Income Nations. International Institute for Environment and Development, Discussion Paper&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human resilience===
Global climate change is going to increase the probability of extreme weather events and environmental disturbances around the world, needless to say, future human populations are going to have to confront this issue. Every society around the world differs in its capacity with regards to combating climate change because of certain pre-existing factors such as having the proper monetary and institutional mechanisms in place to execute preparedness and recovery plans. Despite these differences, communities around the world are on a level-playing field with regards to building and maintaining at least some degree “human resilience”.&lt;ref name=Keim&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Keim | first1 = Mark | year = 2008 | title = Building Human Resilience: The Role of Public Health Preparedness and Response As an Adaptation to Climate Change | doi = 10.1016/j.amepre.2008.08.022 | journal = American Journal of Preventive Medicine | volume = 35 | issue = 5 | pages=508–516}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Resilience has two components: that provided by nature, and that provided through human action and interaction. An example of climate resilience provided by nature is the manner in which porous soil more effectively allows for the drainage of flood water than more compact soil. An example of human action that affects climate resilience would be the facilitation of response and recovery procedures by social institutions or organizations. This theory of human resilience largely focuses on the human populations and calls for building towards the overall goal of decreasing human vulnerability in the face of climate change and extreme weather events. Vulnerability to climatic disturbances has two sides: the first deals with the degree of exposure to dangerous hazards, which one can effectively identify as susceptibility. The second side deals with the capacity to recover from disaster consequences, or resilience in other words.&lt;ref name=Keim/&gt;  The looming threat of environmental disturbances and extreme weather events certainly calls for some action, and human resiliency theory seeks to solve the issue by largely focusing on decreasing the vulnerability of human populations.

How do human populations work to decrease their vulnerability to impending and dangerous climatic events? Up until recently, the international approach to environmental emergencies focused largely on post-impact activities such as reconstruction and recovery.&lt;ref name=Keim/&gt;  However, the international approach is changing to a more comprehensive risk assessment that includes “pre-impact disaster risk reduction - prevention, preparedness, and mitigation.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Woodruff | first1 =  | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | title = Climate Change and Human Health: Review of the Evidence | url = | journal = Australian and New Zealand Journal of Public Health | volume = 30 | issue = | year = 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the case of human resiliency, preparedness can largely be defined as the measures taken in advance to ensure an effective response to the impact of environmental hazards.&lt;ref name=Keim/&gt;  Mitigation, when viewed in this context, refers to the structural and nonstructural measures undertaken to limit the adverse impacts of climatic disturbances.&lt;ref name=Keim/&gt;  This is not to be confused to mitigation with regards to the overall topic of climate change, which refers to reduction of carbon or greenhouse emissions. By accounting for these impending climate disasters both before and after the occur, human populations are able to decrease their vulnerability to these disturbances.

A major element of building and maintaining human resilience is public health.&lt;ref name=Keim/&gt;  The institution of public health as a whole is uniquely placed at the community level to foster human resilience to climate-related disturbances. As an institution, public health can play an active part in reducing human vulnerability by promoting “healthy people and healthy homes.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Srinivasan | first1 =  | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | title = Creating Healthy Communities, Healthy Homes, Healthy People: Initiating a Research Agenda on the Built Environment and Public Health | url = | journal = American Journal of Public Health | volume = 93 | issue = | year = 2003 | doi=10.2105/ajph.93.9.1446 | pages=1446–1450| pmc = 1447991}}&lt;/ref&gt;)  Healthy people are less likely to suffer from disaster-related mortality and are therefore viewed as more disaster-resilient. Healthy homes are designed and built to maintain its structure and withstand extreme climate events. By merely focusing on the individual health of populations and assuring the durability of the homes that house these populations, at least some degree human resiliency towards climate change can be achieved.

==Climate resilience in practice==
The building of climate resilience is a highly comprehensive undertaking that involves of an eclectic array of actors and agents: individuals, [[community organizations]], micropolitical bodies, [[corporations]], [[governments]] at local, state, and national levels as well as [[international organizations]]. In essence, actions that bolster climate resilience are ones that will enhance the adaptive capacity of social, industrial, and environmental infrastructures that can mitigate the effects of climate change.
&lt;ref name="adger"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Adger | first1 = W. N. | last2 = Arnell | first2 = N. W. | last3 = Tompkins | first3 = E. L. | year = 2005 | title = Successful adaptation to climate change across scales | url = | journal = Global Environmental Change | volume =  15| issue = | pages =  77–86| doi = 10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2004.12.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, research indicates that the strongest indicator of successful climate resilience efforts at all scales is a well-developed, pre-existing network of social, political, economic and financial institutions that is already positioned to effectively take on the work of identifying and addressing the risks posed by climate change. Cities, states, and nations that have already developed such networks are, as expected, to generally have far higher net incomes and GDP. 
&lt;ref name="sather"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Satterthwaite | first1 = D | year = 2013 | title = The political underpinnings of cities' accumulated resilience to climate change | url = | journal = Environment and Urbanization | volume = 25 | issue = | pages = 381–391 | doi = 10.1177/0956247813500902 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, it can be seen that embedded within the task of building climate resilience at any scale will be the overcoming of macroscopic [[socioeconomic]] inequities: in many ways, truly facilitating the construction of climate resilient communities worldwide will require national and international agencies to address issues of global [[poverty]], [[industrial development]], and [[food justice]]. However, this does not mean that actions to improve climate resilience cannot be taken in real time at all levels, although evidence suggests that the most climate resilient cities and nations have accumulated this resilience through their responses to previous weather-based disasters. Perhaps even more importantly, empirical evidence suggests that the creation of the climate resilient structures is dependent upon an array of social and environmental reforms that were only successfully passed due to the presence of certain sociopolitical structures such as [[democracy]], activist movements, and [[decentralization]] of government.
&lt;ref name="berkhout"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Berkhout | first1 = Frans | last2 = Hertin | first2 = Julia | last3 = Gann | first3 = David M. | year = 2006 | title = Learning to Adapt: Organisational Adaptation to Climate Change Impacts | url = | journal = Climatic Change | volume = 78 | issue = | pages = 135–56 | doi=10.1007/s10584-006-9089-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Thus it can be seen that to build climate resilience one must work within a network of related social and economic decisions that can have adverse effects on the success of a resilience effort given the competing interests participating in the discussion. Given this, it is clear that the social and economic scale play a vital role in shaping the [[feasibility study|feasibility]], [[cost]]s, empirical success, and [[efficiency]] of climate resilience initiatives. There is a wide variety of actions that can be pursued to improve climate resilience at multiple scales – the following subsections we will review a series of illustrative case studies and strategies from a broad diversity of societal contexts that are currently being implemented to strengthen climate resilience.

===Local and community level===

====Housing and workplace conditions====

[[File:Housing, Kenya 2006. Photo- AusAID (10704025714).jpg|thumb|alt=alt text|Improving housing conditions in Kenya is a prime target for local climate resilience efforts]]

[[Housing inequality]] is directly related to the ability for individuals and communities to sustain adverse impacts brought on by extreme weather events that are triggered by climate change, such as severe winds, storms, and flooding. Especially for communities in developing nations and the Third World, the integrity of housing structures is one of the most significant sources of vulnerability currently. 
&lt;ref name="mertz"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mertz | first1 = Ole | last2 = Halsnaes | first2 = Kirsten | last3 = Olesen | first3 = Jørgen E | last4 = Rasmussen | first4 = Kjeld | year = 2009 | title = Adaptation to Climate Change in Developing Countries | url = | journal = Environmental management | volume = 43 | issue = | pages = 743–52 | doi=10.1007/s00267-008-9259-3| bibcode = 2009EnMan..43..743M }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, even in more developed nations such as the US, there are still multitudes of socioeconomically disadvantaged areas where outdated housing infrastructure is estimated to provide poor climate resilience at best, as well as numerous negative health outcomes.
&lt;ref name="sather" /&gt;

Efforts to improve the resiliency of housing and workplace buildings involves not only fortifying these buildings through use of updated materials and foundation, but also establishing better standards that ensure safer and health conditions for occupants. Better housing standards are in the course of being established through calls for sufficient space, natural lighting, provision for heating or cooling, insulation, and ventilation. Another major issue faced more commonly by communities in the [[Third World]] are highly disorganized and inconsistently enforced housing rights systems. In countries such as [[Kenya]] and [[Nicaragua]], local [[militias]] or corrupted government bodies that have reserved the right to seizure of any housing properties as needed: the end result is the degradation of any ability for citizens to develop climate resilient housing – without property rights for their own homes, the people are powerless to make changes to their housing situation without facing potentially harmful consequences.

&lt;/ref&gt;

====Grassroots community organizing and micropolitical action====

Modern climate resilience scholars have noted that contrary to conventional beliefs, the communities that have been most effective in establishing high levels of climate resilience have actually done so through “bottom-up” political pressures. “Top-down” approaches involving state or federal level decisions have empirically been marred with dysfunction across different levels of government due to internal mismanagement and political gridlock.
&lt;ref name="sather" /&gt;
&lt;ref name="berkhout" /&gt; As a result, in many ways it is being found that the most efficient responses to climate change have actually been initiated and mobilized at local levels. Particularly compelling has been the ability of bottom-up pressures from local civil society to fuel the creation of micropolitical institutions that have compartmentalized the tasks necessary for building climate resilience. For example, the city of [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]] has developed a robust network of micropolitical agencies all dedicated to building resilience in specific industrial sectors: [[transportation]], workplace conditions, emergency shelters, and more.
&lt;ref name="sather" /&gt;
Due to their compact size, local level micropolitical bodies can act quickly without much stagnation and resistance from larger special interests that can generate bureaucratic dysfunction at higher levels of government.

====Low-cost engineering solutions====
Equally important to building climate resilience has been the wide array of basic technological solutions have been developed and implemented at community levels. In developing countries such as [[Mozambique]] and [[Tanzania]], the construction of [[concrete]] “breaker” walls and concentrated use of sandbags in key areas such as housing entrances and doorways has improved the ability of communities to sustain the damages yielded by extreme weather events. Additional strategies have included digging homemade drainage systems to protect local infrastructure of extensive water damage and flooding. 
&lt;ref name="mertz" /&gt;

[[File:Delhi Aerial View, Satellite Image, India September 2003.jpg|thumb|left|alt=alt text|An aerial view of Dehli, India where urban forests are being developed to improve the weather resistance and climate resilience of the city]]

In more urban areas, construction of a “[[green belt]]” on the peripheries of cities has become increasingly common. Green belts are being used as means of improving climate resilience – in addition to provide natural air filtering, these belts of trees have proven to be a healthier and sustainable means of mitigating the damages created by heavy winds and storms.&lt;ref name="sather" /&gt;&lt;ref name="oak"&gt;adaptOakland.

===State and national level===
{{Missing information|section=yes|Dominica's new goal to become the world's first climate resilient nation|date=March 2018}}
====Infrastructural development disaster preparedness protocols====

At larger governmental levels, general programs to improve climate resiliency through greater [[disaster]] preparedness are being implemented. For example, in cases such as [[Norway]], this includes the development of more sensitive and far-reaching early warning systems for extreme weather events, creation of emergency [[electricity]] power sources, enhanced public transportation systems, and more. 
&lt;ref name ="obrien"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = O'Brien | first1 = Karen | last2 = Eriksen | first2 = Siri | last3 = Sygna | first3 = Linda | last4 = Otto Naess | first4 = Lars | year = 2006 | title = Questioning Complacency: Climate Change Impacts, Vulnerability, and Adaptation in Norway | url = | journal = Ambio | volume = 35 | issue = | pages = 50–56 | doi=10.1579/0044-7447(2006)35[50:qccciv]2.0.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
To examine another case study, the state [[California]] in the US has been pursuing more comprehensive federal financial aid systems for communities afflicted by natural disaster, spurred in part by the large amounts of criticism that was placed on the US federal government after what was perceived by many to be a mishandling of [[Hurricane Katrina]] and [[Hurricane Sandy]] relief.

Additionally, a key focus of action at state and federal levels is in improving water management infrastructure and access. Strategies include the creation of [[emergency]] drinking water supplies, stronger [[sanitation]] technology and standards, as well as more extensive and efficient networks of water delivery.

====Social services====

Climate resilience literature has also noted that one of the more indirect sources of resilience actually lies in the strength of the [[social services]] and [[social safety net]] that is provided for citizens by public institutions. This is an especially critical aspect of climate resilience in more socioeconomically disadvantaged communities, cities, and nations. It has been empirically found that places with stronger systems of [[social security]] and [[pensions]] oftentimes have better climate resiliency.
&lt;ref name="sather" /&gt; This is reasoning in the following manner: first of all, better social services for citizens translates to better access to [[healthcare]], [[education]], [[life insurance]], and emergency services. Secondly, stronger systems of social services also generally increase the overall ownership of relevant economic assets that are correlated with better quality of life such as savings, house ownership, and more. Nations where residents are on more stable economic footing are in situations where there is a far higher incentive for private investment into climate resilience efforts.&lt;ref name="sather" /&gt;

===Global level===

====International treaties====

At the global level, most action towards climate resilience has been manifested in the signing of international agreements that set up guidelines and frameworks to address the impacts of climate change. Notable examples include the 1992 [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC), the 1997 [[Kyoto Protocol]] to the UNFCCC, and the 2010 Cancun Agreement.&lt;ref name="unfcc"&gt;

In some cases, as is the case with the Kyoto Protocol for example, these international treaties involve placing legally binding requirements on participant nations to reduce processes that contribute to global warming such as greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;ref name="kyoto"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Prins | first1 = Gwyn | year = 2011 | title = Climate Change: Beyond Kyoto | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 474 | issue = | pages = 576–77 | doi=10.1038/474576a}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rabe"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rabe | first1 = Barry G | year = 2007 | title = Beyond Kyoto: Climate Change Policy in Multilevel Governance Systems | doi = 10.1111/j.1468-0491.2007.00365.x | journal = Governance | volume = 20 | issue = | pages = 423–44 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In other cases, such as the [[2010 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] in Cancun, proposals for the creation of international funding pools to assist developing nations in combating climate change are seen.&lt;ref name="raj"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rajamani | first1 = Lavanya | year = 2011 | title = The Cancun Climate Agreements: Reading the Text, Subtext and Tea Leaves | url = | journal = International and Comparative Law Quarterly | volume = 60 | issue = | pages = 499–519 | doi=10.1017/s0020589311000078}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, that enforcement of any of the requirements or principles that are established in such international treaties has ambiguous: for example, although the 2010 Cancun conference called for the creation of a 100 billion dollar “Green Climate Fund” for developing nations, if and how this fund will actually be created still remains unclear.&lt;ref name="ober"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Oberthür | first1 = Sebastian | year = 2011 | title = Global Climate Governance after Cancun: Options for EU Leadership | url = | journal = The International Spectator | volume = 46 | issue = | pages = 5–13 | doi=10.1080/03932729.2011.567900}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Case studies===
As the looming threat of [[climate change]] and environmental disturbances becomes more and more immediate, so does the need for policy to combat the issue. As a relatively new phenomenon, climate change has yet to receive the political attention it deserves. However, the climate justice and [[climate change]] movements are gaining momentum on an international scale as both grass roots campaigns and supranational organizations begin to gain influence.&lt;ref&gt;Chawla, Ambika, “Climate Justice Movements Gather Strength,” WorldWatch, State of the World. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the most significant and impacting changes come from national and state governments around the world, as they have the political and monetary power to more effectively enforce their proposals.

====United States (as a country)====
As it stands today, there is no country-wide legislation with regards to the topic of climate resiliency in the United States. However, in mid February 2014, President [[Barack Obama]] announced his plan to propose a $1 billion “Climate Resilience Fund”.&lt;ref name=News&gt;Malakoff, David. "Obama to Propose $1 Billion Climate Resilience Fund." Sciencemag.org. http://news.sciencemag.org/climate/2014/02/obama-propose-1-billion-climate-resilience-fund. 15, February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  The details of exactly what the fund will seek to accomplish are vague since the fund is only in the stage of being proposed for Congress’s approval in 2015. However, in the speech given the day of the announcement of this proposal, Obama claimed he will request “...new funding for new technologies to help communities prepare for a changing climate, set up incentives to build smarter, more resilient infrastructure. And finally, my administration will work with tech innovators and launch new challenges under our [[Climate Data Initiative]], focused initially on rising sea levels and their impact on the coasts, but ultimately focused on how all these changes in weather patterns are going to have an impact up and down the United States - not just on the coast but inland as well - and how do we start preparing for that.”&lt;ref name=News/&gt;  Obama’s fund incorporates facets of both urban resiliency and human resiliency theories, by necessarily improving communal infrastructure and by focusing on societal preparation to decrease the country’s vulnerability to the impacts of climate change.

====Phoenix, Arizona====
Phoenix’s large population and extremely dry climate make the city particularly vulnerable to the threats of drought and extreme heat. However, the city has recently incorporated climate change into current (and future) water management and urban design. And by doing so, [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] has taken steps to ensure sustainable water supplies and to protect populations that are vulnerable to extreme heat, largely through improving the sustainability and efficiency of communal infrastructure. For example, Phoenix uses renewable surface water supplies and reserves groundwater for use during the instance when extended droughts arise. The city is also creating a task force to redesign the downtown core to minimize the way buildings trap heat and increase local temperatures.&lt;ref name=EPA&gt;EPA. “Climate Impacts and Adaptation Examples in the Southwest.” http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/impacts-adaptation/southwest-adaptation.html.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[File:Phoenix skyline Arizona USA.jpg|thumb|left|alt=alt text| The outdated infrastructure pictured here in the Phoenix downtown will be undergoing drastic changes geared towards improvements in efficiency.]]

====Denver, Colorado====
The city of [[Denver]] has made recent strides to combat the threat of extreme wildfires and precipitation events. In the year 1996, a fire burned nearly 12,000 acres around [[Buffalo Creek, Colorado|Buffalo Creek]], which serves as the main source of the city’s water supply. Two months following this devastating wildfire, heavy thunderstorms caused flash floods in the burned area, having the effect of washing sediment into the city’s reservoir. In fact, this event washed more sediment into the reservoir than had accumulated in the 13 years prior. Water treatment costs were estimated to be $20 million over the next decade following the event. Denver needed a plan to make sure that the city would not be devastated by future wildfire and flash flood events. DenverWater and the U.S. Forest Service Rocky Mountain Region are working together to restore more than 40,000 acres of [[United States National Forest|National Forest]]s lands through processes like reforestation, erosion control, and the decommissioning of roads. Further, [[Denver]] has installed sensors in the reservoirs in order to monitor the quality of the water and quantity of debris or sediment. These accomplishments will have the effect of building a more resilient Denver, Colorado towards the impending increase of extreme weather events such as wildfire and flooding.&lt;ref name=EPA/&gt;

====China====
[[File:Juncture of three main rivers in Ningbo China.jpg|thumb|right|alt=alt text| Pictured here is the conversion of three large rivers in Ningbo, China. The country is taking substantial measures to combat the flash floods predicted to intensify in the future.]]
[[China]] has been rapidly emerging as a new superpower, rivaling the [[United States]]. As the most populated country in the world, and one of the leaders of the global economy, China’s response to the impending effects of climate change is of great concern for the entire world. A number of significant changes are expected to affect China as the looming threat of [[climate change]] becomes more and more imminent. Here’s just one example; China has experienced a seven-fold increase in the frequency of floods since the 1950s, rising every decade. The frequency of extreme rainfall has increased and is predicted to continue to increase in the western and southern parts of China. The country is currently undertaking efforts to reduce the threat of these floods (which have the potential effect of completely destroying vulnerable communities), largely focusing on improving the infrastructure responsible for tracking and maintaining adequate water levels. That being said, the country is promoting the extension of technologies for water allocation and water-saving mechanisms. In the country’s [[National Climate Change Policy Program]], one of the goals specifically set out is to enhance the ability to bear the impacts of climate change, as well as to raise the public awareness on climate change. China’s National Climate Change Policy states that it will integrate climate change policies into the national development strategy. In China, this national policy comes in the form of its "Five Year Plans for Economic and Social Development". China’s Five Year Plans serve as the strategic road maps for the country’s development. The goals spelled out in the Five Year Plans are mandatory as government officials are held responsible for meeting the targets.&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;King et al. 2012. [http://www.smithschool.ox.ac.uk/research/library/The%20Response%20of%20China%20India%20and%20Brazil%20to%20Climate%20Change_%20A%20perspective%20for%20South%20Africa.pdf "The Response of China, India, and Brazil to Climate Change."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140509001158/http://www.smithschool.ox.ac.uk/research/library/The%20Response%20of%20China%20India%20and%20Brazil%20to%20Climate%20Change_%20A%20perspective%20for%20South%20Africa.pdf |date=2014-05-09 }} Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment. University of Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt;

====India====
As the world’s second most populous country, [[India]] is taking action on a number of fronts in order to address [[poverty]], natural resource management, as well as preparing for the inevitable effects of [[climate change]]. India has made significant strides in the energy sector and the country is now a global leader in renewable energy.  In 2011 India achieved a record $10.3 billion (USD) in clean energy investments, which the country is now using to fund solar, wind, and hydropower projects around the country. In 2008, India published its National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC), which contains several goals for the country. These goals include but are not limited to: covering one third of the country with forests and trees, increasing renewable energy supply to 6% of total energy mix by 2022, and the further maintenance of disaster management. All of the actions work to improve the resiliency of the country as a whole, and this proves to be important because India has an economy closely tied to its natural resource base and climate-sensitive sectors such as agriculture, water, and forestry.&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt;

In [[ecology]], '''climax community''', or '''climatic climax community''', is a historic term for a biological [[Community (ecology)|community]] of [[plant]]s, [[animal]]s, and [[fungi]] which, through the process of [[ecological succession]]  in the development of vegetation in an area over time, have reached a [[steady state]]. This equilibrium was thought to occur because the climax community is composed of species best adapted to average conditions in that area.  The term is sometimes also applied in [[soil]] development. Nevertheless, it has been found that a "steady state" is more apparent than real, particularly if long-enough periods of time are taken into consideration. Notwithstanding, it remains a useful concept.

The idea of a single climax, which is defined in relation to regional climate, originated with [[Frederic Clements]] in the early 1900s. The first analysis of succession as leading to something like a climax was written by [[Henry Chandler Cowles|Henry Cowles]] in 1899, but it was Clements who used the term "climax" to describe the idealized endpoint of succession.&lt;ref&gt;Cowles, Henry Chandler. 1899. The Ecological Relations of the Vegetation on the Sand Dunes of Lake Michigan. Botanical Gazette 27(2): 95-117; 27(3): 167-202; 27(4): 281-308; 27(5): 361-391.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Frederic Clements' use of "climax"== 
Clements described the successional development of an ecological communities comparable to the [[ontogeny|ontogenetic]] development of individual [[organism]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Clements, Frederic E. 1916. Plant Succession: An Analysis of the Development of Vegetation. Washington D.C.: Carnegie Institution of Washington.&lt;/ref&gt; Clements suggested only comparisons to very simple organisms.&lt;ref&gt;Hagen, Joel B. 1992. An Entangled Bank: The Origins of Ecosystem Ecology. New Brunswick: Rutgers University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Later ecologists developed this idea that the ecological community is a "[[superorganism]]" and even sometimes claimed that communities could be homologous to complex organisms and sought to define a single climax-type for each area. The English botanist [[Arthur Tansley]] developed this idea with the "polyclimax"—multiple steady-state end-points, determined by [[edaphic]] factors, in a given climatic zone. Clements had called these end-points other terms, not climaxes, and had thought they were not stable, because by definition climax [[vegetation]] is best-adapted to the climate of a given area. [[Henry Gleason]]'s early challenges to Clements's organism simile, and other strategies of his for describing vegetation, were largely disregarded for several decades until substantially vindicated by research in the 1950s and 1960s (below). Meanwhile, climax theory was deeply incorporated in both [[theoretical ecology]] and in vegetation management.  Clements's terms such as pre-climax, post-climax, [[plagioclimax]] and disclimax continued to be used to describe the many communities which persist in states that diverge from the climax ideal for a particular area.

Though the views are sometimes attributed to him, Clements never argued that climax communities must always occur, or that the different species in an ecological community are tightly integrated physiologically, or that plant communities have sharp boundaries in time or space. Rather, he employed the idea of a climax community—of the form of vegetation best adapted to some idealized set of environmental conditions—as a conceptual starting point for describing the vegetation in a given area. There are good reasons to believe that the species best adapted to some conditions might appear there, when those conditions occur. But much of Clements's work was devoted to characterizing what happens when those ideal conditions do not occur. In those circumstances, vegetation other than the ideal climax will often occur instead. But those different kinds of vegetation can still be described as deviations from the climax ideal. Therefore, Clements developed a very large vocabulary of theoretical terms describing the various possible causes of vegetation, and various non-climax states vegetation adopts as a consequence. His method of dealing with ecological complexity was to define an ideal form of vegetation—the climax community—and describe other forms of vegetation as deviations from that ideal.&lt;ref&gt;Eliot, Christopher. 2007. Method and Metaphysics in Clements’s and Gleason’s Ecological Explanations. Studies in History and Philosophy of Biological and Biomedical Sciences 38(1): 85–109.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Continuing usage of "climax"==
Despite the overall abandonment of climax theory, during the 1990s use of climax concepts again became more popular among some [[theoretical ecologist]]s.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Roughgarden, Jonathan, Robert M. May and Simon A. Levin, editors. 1989. Perspectives in Ecological Theory. Princeton: Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Many authors and nature-enthusiasts continue to use the term "climax" in a diluted form to refer to what might otherwise be called mature or [[old growth|old-growth]] communities. The term "climax" has also been adopted as description for a late successional stage for marine macroinvertebrate communities.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg R., S. Agrenius, B. Hellman, H. C. Nilsson, and K. Norling. 2002. Recovery of marine benthic habitats and fauna in a Swedish fjord following improved oxygen conditions. Marine Ecology Progress Series 234: 43-53.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, some contemporary ecologists still use the term "disclimax" to describe an [[ecosystem]] dominated by [[invasive species]] that competitively prevent the re-introduction of once native species. This concept borrows from Clement's earliest interpretation of climax as referring to an ecosystem that is resistant to colonization by outside species. The term disclimax was used in-context by Clements (1936), and despite being an [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] phenomenon which prevents the facilitation and succession to a true climax community, it is one of the only examples of climax that can be observed in nature.&lt;ref&gt;Clements, Frederic E. 1936. Nature and Structure of the Climax. Journal of Ecology. Vol. 24, No. 1, pp. 252-284&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, K. 1984. Prairie and plains disclimax and disappearing butterflies, in the central United States. Atala. Vol. 10-12, pp. 20-30&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6290">The '''''Codex Zographensis''''' (or '''''Tetraevangelium Zographense'''''; scholarly abbreviation '''''Zo''''') is an [[illuminated manuscript|illuminated]] [[Old Church Slavonic]] [[Old Church Slavonic#Canon|canon]] [[manuscript]]. It is composed of 304 [[parchment]] folios; the first 288 are written in [[Glagolitic script|Glagolitic]] containing [[Gospel]]s, and the rest written in [[Early Cyrillic|Cyrillic]] containing a 13th-century [[synaxarium]]. It is dated at late 10th or early 11th century.&lt;ref name="Damjanovic_2003_p17"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Damjanović|2003|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Discovery and publishing ==
[[File:ZographensisColour.jpg|right|thumb|200px|''Codex Zographensis'']]
The manuscript was found in the Bulgarian [[Zograf Monastery]] on [[Mount Athos]] in 1843 by the Croatian writer and diplomat [[Antun Mihanović]]. Codex's existence was however made known to public by [[Izmail Sreznevsky]] who published some parts of it in 1856.&lt;ref&gt;Кирилометодиевска енциклопедия, т. І, София 1985, с. 739-740&lt;/ref&gt; In 1860 monks from the Zograf monastery donated the Codex to Russian emperor [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] who donated it to [[Russian National Library]], where the Codex is being kept today. The first to describe the codex was [[Viktor I. Grigorovič]] in 1877, and two years later the Glagolitic part of the codex was published by Slavist [[Vatroslav Jagić]] in Berlin as ''Quattuor evangeliorum codex glagoliticus olim Zographensis nunc Petropolitanus'', completely transcribed in Cyrillic, with introduction and extensive philological commentary in [[Latin]].&lt;ref name="Damjanovic_2003_p17"/&gt; Jagić's edition has been reprinted as a [[facsimile]] edition in [[Graz]] in 1954. Other scholars who have extensively studied the language of Codex Zographensis include the [[Josef Kurz]] and the [[Leszek Moszyński]].

== Content ==
The manuscript contains 304 [[parchment]] folios. The first few ones have not been preserved, and thus it begins with [[Matthew 3:11]] and ends with [[Gospel of John|John]], with Mt 16:20-24:20 being later insertion in old Macedonian Church Slavonic.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Lunt|2001|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In total, the first 288 folios are written in Glagolitic and contain Gospel text. In addition, several additional folios from the middle of the manuscript are missing. At the end of the 11th or beginning of the 12th century some missing folios (from 41 to 57) were replaced with 17 new ones, written in square Glagolitic. They were themselves most likely a [[palimpsest]]. The rest of the 16 folios contain 13th-century [[synaxarium]].

== Origin and linguistic features ==
Along with the slightly older [[Codex Marianus]] it is an important document for its use of the round [[Glagolitic script]], the oldest recorded Slavic alphabet. It exhibits linguistic features characteristic of [[Old Church Slavonic#Western Bulgarian recension|Western Bulgarian]] (Macedonian) recension.

By analyzing the language of the codex it was established that the style and antiquity of the text is nonuniform, second part being more archaic than the first part. Some scholars explain this by gradual adaptation to the language of the source from which the manuscript originated. Generally, phonology of  the language of Codex Zographensis is archaic - vocalizations of [[Havlík's law|strong yers]] are rare, epenthetic ''l'' is preserved, though in most parts of the manuscript ''yers'' are being assimilated.&lt;ref name="Damjanovic_2003_p17"/&gt; It is a bit less archaic with respect to morphology and syntax, though the forms of definite declension of adjectives and older forms of participles are well-preserved (e.g. ''prošь'', ''nošь'' and rarely ''prosivъ'', ''nosivъ'').&lt;ref name="Damjanovic_2003_p17"/&gt;

'''Common sense''' is sound practical judgment concerning everyday matters, or a basic ability to [[Perception|perceive]], [[Nous|understand]], and [[Phronesis|judge]] that is shared by ("common to") nearly all people.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Merriam-Webster]]'' gives: "sound and prudent judgment based on a simple perception of the situation or facts." [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/common+sense], Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary. The [[Cambridge Dictionary]] defines it as, "the basic level of practical knowledge and judgment that we all need to help us live in a reasonable and safe way."[http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/common-sense], Cambridge Dictionaries Online. {{harvtxt|van Holthoorn|Olson|1987|page=9}} say that "common sense consists of knowledge, judgement, and taste which is more or less universal and which is held more or less without reflection or argument." C.S. {{harvtxt|Lewis|1967|page=146}} wrote that what common sense "often means" is "the elementary mental outfit of the normal man."&lt;/ref&gt; The first type of common sense, good sense, can be described as "the knack for seeing things as they are, and doing things as they ought to be done." The second type is sometimes described as [[folk wisdom]], "signifying unreflective knowledge not reliant on specialized training or deliberative thought." The two types are intertwined, as the person who has common sense is in touch with common-sense ideas, which emerge from the lived experiences of those commonsensical enough to perceive them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Emotional Common Sense as Constitutional Law|volume=62|pages=851|date=2009|journal=Vanderbilt Law Review|author=Maroney, Terry A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a psychology context, Smedslund defines common sense as "the system of implications shared by the competent users of a language" and notes, "A proposition in a given context belongs to common sense if and only if all competent users of the language involved agree that the proposition in the given context is true and that its negation is false."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Smedslund, Jan|title=Common sense as psychosocial reality: A reply to Sjöberg|journal=Scandinavian journal of psychology|date=September 1982|volume=23|issue=1|pages=79-82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The everyday understanding of common sense derives from historical philosophical discussion involving several European languages. Related terms in other languages include Latin '''{{lang|la|sensus communis}}''', Greek {{lang|grc|αἴσθησις κοινὴ}} ('''{{transl|grc|aísthēsis koinḕ}}'''), and French '''{{lang|fr|bon sens}}''', but these are not straightforward translations in all contexts. Similarly in English, there are different shades of meaning, implying more or less education and wisdom: "good sense" is sometimes seen as equivalent to "common sense", and sometimes not.&lt;ref&gt;For example, [[Thomas Reid]] contrasted common sense and good sense to some extent. See {{harvtxt|Wierzbicka|2010|page=340}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Aristotle Altemps Inv8575.jpg|thumb|right|Aristotle, the first person known to have discussed "common sense", described it as the ability with which animals (including humans) process sense-perceptions, memories and imagination ({{lang|grc|φρονεῖν}}, {{transl|grc|phroneîn}}) in order to reach many types of basic judgments. In his scheme, only humans have real reasoned thinking ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:νοεῖν#Ancient Greek|νοεῖν]]}}, {{transl|grc|noeîn}}), which takes them beyond their common sense.]]
"Common sense" also has at least two specifically philosophical meanings. One is a capability of the animal soul ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:ψυχή#Ancient Greek|ψῡχή]]}}, {{transl|grc|psūkhḗ}}) proposed by [[Aristotle]], which enables different individual senses to collectively perceive the characteristics of physical things such as movement and size, which all physical things have in different combinations, allowing people and other animals to distinguish and identify physical things. This common sense is distinct from basic sensory perception and from human rational thinking, but cooperates with both.

The second special use of the term is Roman-influenced and is used for the natural human sensitivity for other humans and the community.&lt;ref&gt;The ''[[Shorter Oxford English Dictionary]]'' of 1973 gives 4 meanings of "common sense": (1) An archaic meaning is "An internal sense which was regarded as the common bond or centre of the five senses"; (2) "Ordinary, normal, or average understanding" without which a man would be "foolish or insane" (3) "The general sense of mankind, or of a community" (two sub-meanings of this are good sound practical sense and general sagacity) (4) A philosophical meaning, the "faculty of primary truths".&lt;/ref&gt; Just like the everyday meaning, both of these refer to a type of basic awareness and ability to judge that most people are expected to share naturally, even if they cannot explain why.

All these meanings of "common sense", including the everyday ones, are interconnected in a complex history and have evolved during important political and philosophical debates in modern [[Western civilisation]], notably concerning [[science]], politics and [[economics]].&lt;ref&gt;See the body of this article concerning (for example) Descartes, Hobbes, Adam Smith, and so on. [[Thomas Paine]]'s pamphlet named ''"[[Common Sense (pamphlet)|Common Sense]]"'' was an influential publishing success during the period leading up to the [[American revolution]].&lt;/ref&gt; The interplay between the meanings has come to be particularly notable in English, as opposed to other western European languages, and the English term has become international.&lt;ref&gt;See for example {{Harvtxt|Rosenfeld|2011|page=282}}; {{harvtxt|Wierzbicka|2010}}; and {{harvtxt|van Kessel|1987|page=117}}: "today the Anglo-Saxon concept prevails almost everywhere".&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the [[Age of Enlightenment]] the term "common sense" has frequently been used for [[rhetoric]]al effect, sometimes pejorative, and sometimes appealed to positively, [[Argument from authority|as an authority]]. It can be negatively equated to [[wikt:vulgar|vulgar]] [[prejudice]] and [[superstition]], or on the contrary it is often positively contrasted to them as a standard for [[good taste]] and as the source of the most basic [[axiom]]s needed for science and logic.&lt;ref name="hund"&gt;{{harvtxt|Hundert|1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was at the beginning of the eighteenth century that this old philosophical term first acquired its modern English meaning: "Those plain, self-evident truths or conventional wisdom that one needed no sophistication to grasp and no proof to  accept  precisely  because  they  accorded  so  well  with  the  basic  (common sense) intellectual capacities and experiences of the whole social body" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rosenfeld|first1=Sophia|title=Common sense : a political history.|date=2014|publisher=Harvard Univ Press|location=[S.l.]|isbn=9780674284166|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This began with [[René Descartes|Descartes]]' criticism of it, and what came to be known as the dispute between "[[rationalism]]" and "[[empiricism]]". In the opening line of one of his most famous books, ''[[Discourse on Method]]'', Descartes established the most common modern meaning, and its controversies, when he stated that everyone has a similar and sufficient amount of common sense ({{lang|fr|bon sens}}), but it is rarely used well. Therefore, a skeptical logical method described by Descartes needs to be followed and common sense should not be overly relied upon.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Descartes|1901}} Part I of the ''Discourse on Method''. NOTE: The term in French is "{{lang|fr|bon sens}}" sometimes translated as "good sense". The opening lines in English translation read: {{Quote|"Good Sense is, of all things among men, the most equally distributed; for every one thinks himself so abundantly provided with it, that those even who are the most difficult to satisfy in everything else, do not usually desire a larger measure of this quality than they already possess. And in this it is not likely that all are mistaken: the conviction is rather to be held as testifying that the power of judging aright and of distinguishing [[Truth]] from [[Error]], which is properly what is called [[Good Sense]] or [[Reason]], is by nature equal in all men; and that the diversity of our opinions, consequently, does not arise from some being endowed with a larger share of Reason than others, but solely from this, that we conduct our thoughts along different ways, and do not fix our attention on the same objects. For to be possessed of a vigorous mind is not enough; the prime requisite is rightly to apply it. The greatest minds, as they are capable of the highest excellencies, are open likewise to the greatest aberrations; and those who travel very slowly may yet make far greater progress, provided they keep always to the straight road, than those who, while they run, forsake it."}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ensuing 18th century [[Enlightenment era|Enlightenment]], common sense came to be seen more positively as the basis for modern thinking. It was contrasted to [[metaphysics]], which was, like [[Cartesianism]], associated with the {{lang|fr|[[Ancien Régime]]}}. [[Thomas Paine]]'s polemical pamphlet ''[[Common Sense (pamphlet)|Common Sense]]'' (1776) has been described as the most influential political pamphlet of the 18th century, affecting both the [[American revolution|American]] and [[French revolution]]s.&lt;ref name="hund" /&gt; Today, the concept of common sense, and how it should best be used, remains linked to many of the most perennial topics in [[epistemology]] and [[ethics]], with special focus often directed at the philosophy of the modern [[social sciences]].

==Aristotelian==
The origin of the term is in the works of [[Aristotle]]. The best-known case is ''[[De Anima]]'' [http://www.mikrosapoplous.gr/aristotle/psyxhs/3_01.html Book III, chapter 1], especially at line 425a27.&lt;ref&gt;There are other places in the works of Aristotle uses the same two words together: ''[[De memoria et reminiscentia]]'' 1450a, ''[[De Partibus Animalium]]'' IV.10 686a, ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'' I.1 981b, ''[[Historia Animalium]]'' I.3 489a. See {{Harvtxt|Gregorić|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The passage is about how the animal mind converts raw sense perceptions from the [[Five wits|five specialized]] [[sense perception]]s, into perceptions of real things moving and changing, which can be thought about. According to Aristotle's understanding of perception, each of the five senses perceives one type of "perceptible" or "sensible" which is specific ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:ἴδιος#Ancient Greek|ἴδια]]}}, {{transl|grc|idia}}) to it. For example, sight can see colour. But Aristotle was explaining how the animal mind, not just the human mind, links and categorizes different tastes, colours, feelings, smells and sounds in order to perceive real things in terms of the "common sensibles" (or "common perceptibles"). In this discussion, "common" ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:κοινός#Ancient Greek|κοινή]]}}, {{transl|grc|koiné}}) is a term opposed to specific or particular ({{transl|grc|idia}}). The Greek for these common sensibles is {{transl|grc|tá koiná}} ({{lang|grc|τά κοινᾰ́}}, {{literal translation|'that which is common to many'|lk=on}}), which means shared or common things, and examples include the oneness of each thing, with its specific shape and size and so on, and the change or movement of each thing.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle lists change, shape, magnitude, number and unity, but he notes that we perceive shape, magnitude, and the rest by first being able to perceive change or movement (Greek uses one word for both: {{lang|grc|[[wikt:κίνησις#Ancient Greek|κῑ́νησῐς]]}}, {{transl|grc|kī́nēsis}}), and number is perceived by perceiving a lack of unity. (''De Anima'' 425a16, just before the famous mention of "common sense".) As {{harvtxt|Lee|2011}} explains, Aristotle is talking about what [[Robert Boyle]] and [[John Locke]] referred to as "[[primary qualities]]" (not to be confused with Aristotle's use of the term "primary qualities"). Plato is not so clear. In the equivalent passage in Plato's ''Theaetetus'' 185c–d, he talks about what is common in all things, and in specific things, and by which we say that things for example "are" versus "are not"; are "similar" versus "dissimilar"; are the "same" versus being "different"; being one or a higher number; odd or even.&lt;/ref&gt; Distinct combinations of these properties are common to all perceived things.&lt;ref&gt;These "common sensibles" or {{transl|grc|koiná}} are in other words one Platonic-Aristotelian version of what are today called "[[universals]]", although it should be noted that Aristotle distinguishes the {{transl|grc|koiná}} perceived by common sense, from the [[Theory of forms|forms]] or ideas seen by the {{transl|grc|[[Nous|noûs]]}} ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:νοῦς#Ancient Greek|νοῦς]]}}). See for example {{citation|title=A Companion to Aristotle
|editor-first= Georgios |editor-last=Anagnostopoulos |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4nlfBVrDmlgC&amp;pg=PT215|isbn= 9781118610633 |date= 2013-03-05 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In this passage, Aristotle explained that concerning these {{transl|grc|koiná}} (such as movement) we already have a sense, a "common sense" or sense of the common things ({{transl|grc|aísthēsis koinḕ}}), which does not work by [[accident (philosophy)|accident]] ({{lang|grc|κᾰτᾰ́ σῠμβεβηκός}}, {{transl|grc|katá sumbebēkós}}). And there is no specific ({{transl|grc|idéā}}) sense perception for movement and other {{transl|grc|koiná}}, because then we would not perceive the {{transl|grc|koiná}} at all, except by accident. As examples of perceiving by accident Aristotle mentions using the specific sense perception vision on its own to see that something is sweet, or to recognize a friend by their distinctive color. {{harvtxt|Lee|2011|page=31}} explains that "when I see Socrates, it is not insofar as he is Socrates that he is visible to my eye, but rather because he is coloured". So the normal five individual senses do sense the common perceptibles according to Aristotle (and Plato), but it is not something they necessarily interpret correctly on their own. Aristotle proposes that the reason for having several senses is in fact that it increases the chances that we can distinguish and recognize things correctly, and not just occasionally or by accident.&lt;ref&gt;''De Anima'' line 425a47, just after the famous mention of "common sense".&lt;/ref&gt; Each sense is used to identify distinctions, such as sight identifying the difference between black and white, but, says Aristotle, all animals with perception must have "some one thing" that can distinguish black from sweet.&lt;ref&gt;''De Anima'' column 427a. Plato, in his ''Theaetatus'' 185a–c uses the question of how to judge if sound or colour are salty.&lt;/ref&gt; The common sense is where this comparison happens, and this must occur by comparing impressions (or symbols or markers; {{lang|grc|[[wikt:σημεῖον#Ancient Greek|σημεῖον]]}}, {{transl|grc|sēmeîon}}, {{literal translation|'sign, mark'|lk=on}}) of what the specialist senses have perceived.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Sachs|2011|page=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; The common sense is therefore also where a type of [[consciousness]] originates, "for it makes us aware of having sensations at all". And it receives physical picture imprints from the imaginative faculty, which are then memories that can be recollected.&lt;ref name="brann43" /&gt;

The discussion was apparently intended to improve upon the account of Aristotle's friend and teacher [[Plato]] in his [[Socratic dialogue]], the ''[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Approximately [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Plat.+Theaet.+185a&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0171 185a]–[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0171%3Atext%3DTheaet.%3Asection%3D187a 187a].&lt;/ref&gt; But Plato's dialogue presented an argument that recognizing {{transl|grc|koiná}} is an active thinking process in the rational part of the human soul, making the senses instruments of the thinking part of man. Plato's Socrates says this kind of thinking is not a kind of sense at all. Aristotle, trying to give a more general account of the souls of all animals, not just humans, moved the act of perception out of the rational thinking soul into this {{lang|la|sensus communis}}, which is something like a sense, and something like thinking, but not rational.&lt;ref name="greg"&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gregorić|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Avicenna-miniatur.jpg|thumb|right|Avicenna became one of the greatest medieval authorities concerning Aristotelian common sense, both in Islamic and Christian lands.]]

The passage is difficult to interpret and there is little consensus about many of the details.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gregorić|2007}}, Introduction.&lt;/ref&gt; {{Harvtxt|Gregorić|2007|pages=204–205}} has argued that this may be because Aristotle did not use the term as a standardized technical term at all. For example, in some passages in his works, Aristotle seems to use the term to refer to the individual sense perceptions simply being common to all people, or common to various types of animals. There is also difficulty with trying to determine whether the common sense is truly separable from the individual sense perceptions and from imagination, in anything other than a conceptual way as a capability. Aristotle never fully spells out the relationship between the common sense and the [[imagination|imaginative faculty]] ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:φαντασία#Ancient Greek|φᾰντᾰσῐ́ᾱ]]}}, {{transl|grc|phantasíā}}), although the two clearly work together in animals, and not only humans, for example in order to enable a perception of time. They may even be the same.&lt;ref name="brann43"&gt;{{harvtxt|Brann|1991|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="greg" /&gt; Despite hints by Aristotle himself that they were united, early commentators such as [[Alexander of Aphrodisias]] and [[Al-Farabi]] felt they were distinct, but later, [[Avicenna]] emphasized the link, influencing future authors including Christian philosophers.&lt;ref name="hr42" /&gt;&lt;ref name="walz"&gt;{{citation|title=Al-Farabi on the Perfect State|first=Richard |last=Walzer| isbn=1871031761|year=1998|page=389}}.&lt;/ref&gt; {{Harvtxt|Gregorić|2007|page=205}} argues that Aristotle used the term "common sense" both to discuss the individual senses when these act as a unity, which Gregorić calls "the perceptual capacity of the soul", or the higher level "sensory capacity of the soul" that represents the senses and the imagination working as a unity. According to Gregorić, there appears to have been a standardization of the term {{transl|grc|koinḕ aísthēsis}} as a term for the perceptual capacity (not the higher level sensory capacity), which occurred by the time of Alexander of Aphrodisias at the latest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gregorić|2007|page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compared to Plato, Aristotle's understanding of the soul ({{transl|grc|psūkhḗ}}) has an extra level of complexity in the form of the {{transl|grc|[[Nous|noûs]]}} or "intellect"—which is something only humans have and enables humans to perceive things differently from other animals. It works with images coming from the common sense and imagination, using [[reason]]ing ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:λόγος#Ancient Greek|λόγος]]}}, {{transl|grc|[[Logos|lógos]]}}) as well as the ''[[active intellect]]''. The {{transl|grc|noûs}} identifies the true [[Formal cause|forms of things]], while the common sense identifies shared aspects of things. Though scholars have varying interpretations of the details, Aristotle's "common sense" was in any case not rational, in the sense that it implied no ability to explain the perception. [[Reason]] or [[rationality]] ({{transl|grc|lógos}}) exists only in man according to Aristotle, and yet some animals can perceive "common perceptibles" such as change and shape, and some even have imagination according to Aristotle. Animals with imagination come closest to having something like reasoning and {{transl|grc|noûs}}.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Posterior Analytics]]'' II.19.&lt;/ref&gt; Plato, on the other hand was apparently willing to allow that animals could have some level of thought, meaning that he did not have to explain their sometimes complex behavior with a strict division between high-level perception processing and the human-like thinking such as being able to form opinions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gregorić|2007|pages=5–6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Gregorić additionally argues that Aristotle can be interpreted as using the verbs {{transl|grc|phroneîn}} and {{transl|grc|noeîn}} to distinguish two types of thinking or awareness, the first being found in animals and the second unique to humans and involving reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Gregorić|2007}}, Part II, chapter 3, which concerns a passage in ''[[De Partibus Animalium]]'' IV, but also refers to other passages in the corpus. See footnote 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, in Aristotle (and the medieval Aristotelians) the universals used to identify and categorize things are divided into two. In medieval terminology these are the {{lang|la|species sensibilis}} used for perception and imagination in animals, and the {{lang|la|species intelligibilis}} or apprehendable forms used in the human intellect or {{transl|grc|noûs}}.

Aristotle also occasionally called the {{transl|grc|koinḕ aísthēsis}} (or one version of it) the {{transl|grc|prôton aisthētikón}} ({{lang|grc|πρῶτον αἰσθητῐκόν}}, {{literal translation|'first of the senses'|lk=no}}). (According to Gregorić, this is specifically in contexts where it refers to the higher order common sense that includes imagination.) Later philosophers developing this line of thought, such as [[Themistius]], [[Galen]], and [[Al-Farabi]], called it the {{em|ruler}} of the senses or {{em|ruling}} sense, apparently a metaphor developed from a section of Plato's ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' (70b).&lt;ref name="walz" /&gt; [[Augustine]] and some of the Arab writers, also called it the "inner sense".&lt;ref name="hr42" /&gt; The concept of the inner senses, plural, was further developed in the [[Middle Ages]]. Under the influence of the great Persian philosophers [[Al-Farabi]] and [[Avicenna]], several inner senses came to be listed. "Thomas Aquinas and [[John of Jandun]] recognized four internal senses: the common sense, [[imagination]], {{lang|la|vis cogitativa}}, and memory. Avicenna, followed by [[Robert Grosseteste]], [[Albert the Great]], and [[Roger Bacon]], argued for five internal senses: the common sense, imagination, fantasy, {{lang|la|vis aestimativa}}, and memory."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gregorić|2007|page=10}}. The "cogitative" or "estimative" capacity, {{lang|la|vis aestimativa}}, "enables the animal to extract vital information about its environment from the form processed by the common sense and imagination."&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of [[Descartes]] and [[Hobbes]], in the 1600s, the inner senses had been standardized to ''[[five wits]]'', which complemented the more well-known five "external" senses.&lt;ref name="hr42"&gt;{{Harvtxt|Heller-Roazen|2008|page=42}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Under this medieval scheme the common sense was understood to be seated not in the heart, as Aristotle had thought, but in the anterior [[Galen]]ic [[Ventricular system|ventricle]] of the brain. The great anatomist [[Andreas Vesalius]] however found no connections between the anterior ventricle and the sensory nerves, leading to speculation about other parts of the brain into the 1600s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gregorić|2007|page=11}}. See below concerning Descartes.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Harvtxt|Heller-Roazen|2008}} writes that "In different ways the philosophers of medieval Latin and Arabic tradition, from Al-Farabi to Avicenna, [[Averroës]], [[Albertus Magnus|Albert]], and [[Thomas of Aquinas|Thomas]], found in the ''De Anima'' and the ''[[Parva Naturalia]]'' the scattered elements of a coherent doctrine of the "central" faculty of the sensuous soul."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Heller-Roazen|2008|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was "one of the most successful and resilient of Aristotelian notions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gregorić|2007|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roman==
[[File:Marcus Aurelius statue.01.JPG|right|thumb|Marcus Aurelius, emperor and Stoic philosopher, and an important influence upon the concept of "humanist" common sense.]]
"{{lang|la|Sensus communis}}" is the Latin translation of the Greek {{transl|grc|koinḕ aísthēsis}}, which came to be recovered by Medieval [[scholastics]] when discussing Aristotelian theories of perception. However, in earlier Latin during the Roman empire the term had taken a distinct ethical detour, developing new shades of meaning. These especially Roman meanings were apparently influenced by several Stoic Greek terms with the word {{transl|grc|koinḗ}} ({{lang|grc|κοινή}}, {{literal translation|'common, shared'}}); not only {{transl|grc|koinḕ aísthēsis}}, but also such terms as {{transl|grc|koinós noûs}} ({{lang|grc|κοινός νοῦς}}, {{literal translation|'common mind/thought/reason'|lk=no}}) {{transl|grc|koinḗ énnoia}} ({{lang|grc|κοινή ἔννοιᾰ}}), and {{transl|grc|koinonoēmosúnē}}, all of which involve {{transl|grc|noûs}}—something, at least in Aristotle, that would not be present in "lower" animals.&lt;ref name="Bugter1987"&gt;{{harvtxt|Bugter|1987|page=84}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{transl|grc|Koinḗ énnoia}} is a term from [[Stoic philosophy]], a Greek philosophy, influenced by Aristotle, and influential in [[Rome]]. This refers to shared notions, or common conceptions, that are either in-born or imprinted by the senses on to the soul. Unfortunately few true Stoic texts survive, and our understanding of their technical terminology is limited.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Prolepsis and Ennoia in the Early Stoa|first= Henry |last=Dyson|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D1AXMNpIgJ4C| year=2009| publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn= 9783110212297 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{transl|grc|Koinós noûs}} is a term found in [[Epictetus]] (III.vi.8), a Stoic philosopher. C.S. {{harvtxt|Lewis|1967|page=146}} believed this to be close to a modern English meaning of "common sense", "the elementary mental outfit of the normal man", something like [[intelligence]]. He noted that {{lang|la|sensus}} could be a translation of {{transl|grc|noûs}}, (for example in the [[Vulgate Bible]]), but he only found one clear case of a Latin text showing this apparent meaning, a text by [[Phaedrus (fabulist)|Phaedrus the fable writer]].
* {{transl|grc|Koinonoēmosúnē}} is found only in the work of the emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]] (''[[Meditations]]'' I.16), also known as a Stoic. (He uses the word on its own in a list of things he learned from his adopted father.) Shaftesbury and others felt it represented the Stoic Greek original, which gave the special Roman meaning of {{lang|la|sensus communis}}, especially when used to refer to someone's public spirit. Shaftesbury explained the change of meaning as being due to the specific way that Stoics understood perception and intellect, saying that one should "consider withal how small the distinction was in that Philosophy, between the {{lang|grc|[[wikt:ὑπόληψις|ὑπόληψις]]}} [conjecture], and the vulgar {{lang|grc|[[wikt:αἴσθησις|αἴσθησις]]}} [perception]; how generally Passion was by those Philosophers brought under the Head of Opinion".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Shaftesbury|2001}}, volume I, part III, section I, first footnote.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another link between Latin {{lang|la|communis sensus}} and Aristotle's Greek was in [[rhetoric]], a subject that Aristotle was the first to systematize. In rhetoric, a prudent speaker must take account of opinions ({{lang|grc|δόξαι}}, {{transl|grc|[[Doxa|dóxai]]}}) that are widely held.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hans-Georg Gadamer]] saw Aristotle's rhetorical work as having formed a continuity with his ethical and political work, all sharing a focus upon {{transl|grc|[[Phronesis|phrónēsis]]}} ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:φρόνησις#Ancient Greek|φρόνησῐς]]}}, {{literal translation|'practical wisdom'|lk=no}}), and a connection to what Vico saw in the concept of common sense. See {{citation|title=Gadamer's Hermeneutics and the Art of Conversation| editor-first=Andrzej |editor-last=Wierciński| first=John|last=Arthos| chapter=Gadamer's dialogical imperative: Linking Socratic dialogue to Aristotle's ''PHRONESIS''|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4lE268UbRQsC| isbn=9783643111722 | year=2011 }} and {{harvtxt|Schaeffer|1990|page=113}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle referred to such commonly held beliefs not as {{transl|grc|koinaí dóxai}} ({{lang|grc|κοιναί δόξαι}}, {{literal translation|'common opinions'|lk=no}}), which is a term he used for self-evident logical axioms, but with other terms such as {{transl|grc|[[Endoxa|éndóxa]]}} ({{lang|grc|ἔνδόξα}}).

In his ''[[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Rhetoric]]'' for example Aristotle mentions "{{transl|grc|koinōn&amp;nbsp;[...] tàs písteis}}" or "common beliefs", saying that "our proofs and arguments must rest on generally accepted principles, [...] when speaking of converse with the multitude".&lt;ref&gt;{{lang|grc|ἀνάγκη διὰ τῶν κοινῶν ποιεῖσθαι τὰς πίστεις καὶ τοὺς λόγους}} [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0059%3Abekker+page%3D1355a ''Rhetoric'' 1355a]&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar passage in his own work on rhetoric, ''[[De Oratore]]'', [[Cicero]] wrote that "in oratory the very cardinal sin is to depart from the language of everyday life and the usage approved by the sense of the community". The sense of the community is in this case one translation of "{{lang|la|communis sensus}}" in the Latin of Cicero.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Bugter|1987|page=90}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0120:book=1:section=12&amp;highlight=communis%2Csensus ''De Oratore'', I, 3, 12]&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether the Latin writers such as [[Cicero]] deliberately used this Aristotelian term in a new more peculiarly Roman way, probably also influenced by Greek Stoicism, therefore remains a subject of discussion. {{harvtxt|Schaeffer|1990|page=112}} has proposed for example that the [[Roman republic]] maintained a very "oral" culture whereas in Aristotle's time rhetoric had come under heavy criticism from philosophers such as Socrates. {{harvtxt|Peters Agnew|2008}} argues, in agreement with [[Shaftesbury]] in the 18th century, that the concept developed from the Stoic concept of ethical virtue, influenced by Aristotle, but emphasizing the role of both the individual perception, and shared communal understanding. But in any case a complex of ideas attached itself to the term, to be almost forgotten in the Middle Ages, and eventually returning into ethical discussion in 18th-century Europe, after Descartes.

As with other meanings of common sense, for the Romans of the classical era "it designates a sensibility shared by all, from which one may deduce a number of fundamental judgments, that need not, or cannot, be questioned by rational reflection".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Heller-Roazen|2008|page=33}}.&lt;/ref&gt; But even though Cicero did at least once use the term in a manuscript on Plato's ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' (concerning a primordial "sense, one and common for all [...] connected with nature"), he and other Roman authors did not normally use it as a technical term limited to discussion about sense perception, as Aristotle apparently had in ''De Anima'', and as the Scholastics later would in the Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Bugter|1987|pages=91–92}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of referring to all animal judgment, it was used to describe pre-rational, widely shared human beliefs, and therefore it was a near equivalent to the concept of {{lang|la|[[humanitas]]}}. This was a term that could be used by Romans to imply not only [[human nature]], but also humane conduct, good breeding, refined manners, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bugter|1987|page=93}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from Cicero, [[Quintilian]], [[Lucretius]], [[Seneca the Elder|Seneca]], [[Horace]] and some of the most influential Roman authors influenced by Aristotle's rhetoric and philosophy used the Latin term "{{lang|la|sensus communis}}" in a range of such ways.&lt;ref name=rethink&gt;{{Harvtxt|Heller-Roazen|2008|page=32}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As [[C. S. Lewis]] wrote:
{{Quote|Quintilian says it is better to send a boy to school than to have a private tutor for him at home; for if he is kept away from the herd ({{lang|la|congressus}}) how will he ever learn that {{lang|la|sensus}} which we call {{lang|la|communis}}? (I, ii, 20). On the lowest level it means tact. In Horace the man who talks to you when you obviously don't want to talk lacks {{lang|la|communis sensus}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lewis|1967|page=146}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Compared to Aristotle and his strictest medieval followers, these Roman authors were not so strict about the boundary between animal-like common sense and specially human reasoning. As discussed above, Aristotle had attempted to make a clear distinction between, on the one hand, imagination and the sense perception which both use the sensible {{transl|grc|koiná}}, and which animals also have; and, on the other hand, {{transl|grc|noûs}} (intellect) and reason, which perceives another type of {{transl|grc|koiná}}, the intelligible forms, which (according to Aristotle) only humans have. In other words, these Romans allowed that people could have animal-like shared understandings of reality, not just in terms of memories of sense perceptions, but in terms of the way they would tend to explain things, and in the language they use.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|van Holthoon|1987}}, chapter 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cartesian==
[[File:Descartes mind and body.gif|thumb|200px|right|[[René Descartes]]' illustration of perception. Sensations from the senses travel to {{lang|la|sensus communis}}, seated in the pineal gland inside the brain, and from there to the immaterial spirit.]]
One of the last notable philosophers to accept something like the Aristotelian "common sense" was [[Descartes]] in the 17th century, but he also undermined it. He described this inner faculty when writing in Latin in his ''[[Meditations on first philosophy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Descartes|1901}} Chapter: MEDITATION II.: Of the Nature of the Human Mind ; and that It is More Easily Known than the Body.&lt;/ref&gt; The common sense is the link between the body and its senses, and the true human mind, which according to Descartes must be purely immaterial. Unlike Aristotle, who had placed it in the heart, by the time of Descartes this faculty was thought to be in the brain, and he located it in the [[pineal gland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Descartes|1901}} Chapter: MEDITATION VI.: Of the Existence of Material Things, and of the Real Distinction Between the Mind and Body of Man.&lt;/ref&gt; Descartes' judgement of this common sense was that it was enough to persuade the human consciousness of the existence of physical things, but often in a very indistinct way. To get a more distinct understanding of things, it is more important to be methodical and mathematical.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Brann|1991|page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; This line of thought was taken further, if not by Descartes himself then by those he influenced, until the concept of a faculty or organ of common sense was itself rejected.
{{Quote|René Descartes is generally credited with making obsolete the notion that there was an actual faculty within the human brain that functioned as a {{lang|la|sensus communis}}. The French philosopher did not fully reject the idea of the inner senses, which he appropriated from the [[Scholasticism|Scholastics]]. But he distanced himself from the Aristotelian conception of a common sense faculty, abandoning it entirely by the time of his ''[[Passions of the Soul]]'' (1649).&lt;ref name="rosenfeld21" /&gt;}}

Contemporaries such as [[Pierre Gassendi|Gassendi]] and [[Hobbes]] went beyond Descartes in some ways in their rejection of Aristotelianism, rejecting explanations involving anything other than matter and motion, including the distinction between the animal-like judgement of sense perception, a special separate common sense, and the human mind or {{transl|grc|noûs}}, which Descartes had retained from Aristotelianism.&lt;ref&gt;See {{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mKFXRA2HPkoC&amp;pg=PA83|page=83|title=The Mechanisation of Aristotelianism: The Late Aristotelian Setting of Thomas Hobbes' Natural Philosophy| first=Cees |last=Leijenhorst| publisher=Brill|isbn=9004117296|year=2002}}. Hobbes (like Gassendi) wrote scornfully of the complex old distinctions, and in particular the medieval concept of sensible "species" (a concept derived from Aristotle's perceptibles):
{{Quote|Some say the Senses receive the Species of things, and deliver them to the Common-sense; and the Common Sense delivers them over to the Fancy, and the Fancy to the Memory, and the Memory to the Judgement, like handing of things from one to another, with many words making nothing understood. ({{citation|first=Thomas |last=Hobbes| title= The English Works of Thomas Hobbes of Malmesbury; Now First Collected and Edited by Sir William Molesworth, Bart., 11 vols.| volume=3 (''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'')  |chapter= II.: of imagination| publication-place=London |publisher=Bohn| url= http://oll.libertyfund.org/title/585/89820/2025312}}).}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to Descartes who "found it unacceptable to assume that sensory representations may enter the mental realm from without"...
{{Quote|According to Hobbes [...] man is no different from the other animals. [...] Hobbes' philosophy constituted a more profound rupture with [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic]] thought. He accepted mental representations but [...] "All sense is fancy", as Hobbes famously put it, with the only exception of extension and motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Spruit|1995|pages=403–404}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
[[File:Descartes portrait.jpg|thumb|right|René Descartes is the source of the most common way of understanding the "common sense" as a widely spread type of judgement.]]
But Descartes used two different terms in his work, not only the Latin term "{{lang|la|sensus communis}}", but also the French term {{lang|fr|bon sens}}, with which he opens his ''Discourse on Method''. And this second concept survived better. This work was written in French, and does not directly discuss the Aristotelian technical theory of perception. {{lang|fr|Bon sens}} is the equivalent of modern English "common sense" or "good sense". As the Aristotelian meaning of the Latin term began to be forgotten after Descartes, his discussion of {{lang|fr|bon sens}} gave a new way of defining {{lang|la|sensus communis}} in various European languages (including Latin, even though Descartes himself did not translate {{lang|fr|bon sens}} as {{lang|la|sensus communis}}, but treated them as two separate things).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Rosenfeld|2011}}, p.&amp;nbsp;282. English is unusual in keeping one term that unites the classical and modern meanings, and philosophical and everyday meanings, so clearly. Italian has {{lang|it|senso comune}} and also {{lang|it|buon senso}}; German has {{lang|de|gemeiner Verstand}}, {{lang|de|gesunder Menschenverstand}}, and {{lang|de|Gemeinsinn}}, used by Kant and others. French also has {{lang|fr|sens commun}}, used by [[Étienne Gilson]] and others. See {{harvtxt|Wierzbicka|2010}}, who also notes that according to Gilson, Descartes himself always referred to {{lang|fr|bon sens}} as {{lang|la|bona mens}} in Latin, never {{lang|la|sensus communis}} (p.&amp;nbsp;340).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Harvtxt|Schaeffer|1990|page=2}} writes that "Descartes is the source of the most common meaning of ''common sense'' today: practical judgment". Gilson noted that Descartes actually gave {{lang|fr|bon sens}} two related meanings, first the basic and widely shared ability to judge true and false, which he also calls {{lang|fr|raison}} ({{literal translation|'reason'|lk=on}}); and second, wisdom, the perfected version of the first. The Latin term Descartes uses, {{lang|la|bona mens}} ({{literal translation|'good mind'}}), derives from the Stoic author [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] who only used it in the second sense. Descartes was being original.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dDpKI8JoLPAC&amp;pg=PA82|page=82| title=Discours de la méthode| chapter=Première Partie; Commentaire Historique| first=Etienne |last=Gilson| year=1925|isbn=9782711601806}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea that now became influential, developed in both the Latin and French works of Descartes, though coming from different directions, is that common good sense (and indeed sense perception) is not reliable enough for the new Cartesian method of [[skeptical]] [[reason]]ing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Heller-Roazen|2008|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cartesian project to replace common good sense with clearly defined mathematical reasoning was aimed at certainty, and not mere probability. It was promoted further by people such as Hobbes, [[Spinoza]], and others and continues to have important impacts on everyday life. In France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Spain and Italy, it was in its initial florescence associated with the administration of Catholic empires of the competing [[Bourbon dynasty|Bourbon]], and [[Habsburg dynasty|Habsburg]] dynasties, both seeking to centralize their power in a modern way, responding to [[Machiavelli]]anism and [[Protestantism]] as part of the so-called [[counter reformation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|van Kessel|1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|Cartesian theory offered a justification for innovative social change achieved through the courts and administration, an ability to adapt the law to changing social conditions by making the basis for legislation "rational" rather than "traditional".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Schaeffer|1990|page=52}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}} So after Descartes, critical attention turned from Aristotle and his theory of perception, and more towards Descartes' own treatment of common good sense, concerning which several 18th-century authors found help in Roman literature.

==The Enlightenment after Descartes==

===Epistemology: versus claims of certainty===
During the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], Descartes' insistence upon a mathematical-style method of thinking that treated common sense and the sense perceptions sceptically, was accepted in some ways, but also criticized. On the one hand, the approach of Descartes is and was seen as radically sceptical in some ways. On the other hand, like the Scholastics before him, while being cautious of common sense, Descartes was instead seen to rely too much on undemonstrable metaphysical assumptions in order to justify his method, especially in its separation of mind and body (with the {{lang|la|sensus communis}} linking them). Cartesians such as [[Henricus Regius]], [[Geraud de Cordemoy]], and [[Nicolas Malebranche]] realized that Descartes's logic could give no evidence of the "external world" at all, meaning it had to be taken on faith.&lt;ref name="gil1"&gt;{{harvtxt|Gilson|1939}}, chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Though his own proposed solution was even more controversial, Berkeley famously wrote that enlightenment requires a "revolt from metaphysical notions to the plain dictates of nature and common sense".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Concept of Humanity in an Age of Globalization|first=Longxi |last=Zhang| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LUeeHSwEWCcC&amp;pg=PA131|page=131 |isbn=9783862349180 |date=2011-12-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Descartes and the Cartesian "[[rationalists]]", rejected reliance upon experience, the senses and [[inductive reasoning]], and seemed to insist that certainty was possible. The alternative to induction, deductive reasoning, demanded a mathematical approach, starting from simple and certain assumptions. This in turn required Descartes (and later rationalists such as Kant) to assume the existence of innate or "{{lang|la|[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]}}" [[knowledge]] in the human mind—a controversial proposal.

In contrast to the rationalists, the "[[Empiricism|empiricists]]" took their orientation from [[Francis Bacon]], whose arguments for methodical science were earlier than those of Descartes, and less directed towards mathematics and certainty. Bacon is known for his doctrine of the "[[idols of the mind]]", presented in his ''[[Novum Organum]]'', and in his ''[[Essays (Francis Bacon)|Essays]]'' described normal human thinking as biased towards believing in lies.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Francis |last=Bacon |title=On Truth |url=http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl302/texts/bacon/bacon_essays.html |access-date=2013-09-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130629183522/http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl302/texts/bacon/bacon_essays.html |archive-date=2013-06-29 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; But he was also the opponent of all metaphysical explanations of nature, or over-reaching speculation generally, and a proponent of science based on small steps of experience,  experimentation and methodical induction. So while agreeing upon the need to help common sense with a methodical approach, he also insisted that starting from common sense, including especially common sense perceptions, was acceptable and correct. He influenced [[John Locke|Locke]] and [[Pierre Bayle]], in their critique of metaphysics, and in 1733 [[Voltaire]] "introduced him as the "father" of the [[scientific method]]" to a French audience, an understanding that was widespread by 1750. Together with this, references to "common sense" became positive and associated with modernity, in contrast to negative references to metaphysics, which was associated with the {{lang|fr|[[Ancien Régime]]}}.&lt;ref name="hund" /&gt;

As mentioned above, in terms of the more general epistemological implications of common sense, modern philosophy came to use the term common sense like Descartes, abandoning Aristotle's theory. While Descartes had distanced himself from it, [[John Locke]] abandoned it more openly, while still maintaining the idea of "common sensibles" that are perceived. But then [[George Berkeley]] abandoned both.&lt;ref name="rosenfeld21"&gt;{{harvtxt|Rosenfeld|2011|page=21}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Hume]] agreed with Berkeley on this, and like Locke and Vico saw himself as following Bacon more than Descartes. In his synthesis, which he saw as the first Baconian analysis of man (something the lesser known Vico had claimed earlier), common sense is entirely built up from shared experience and shared innate emotions, and therefore it is indeed imperfect as a basis for any attempt to know the truth or to make the best decision. But he defended the possibility of science without absolute certainty, and consistently described common sense as giving a valid answer to the challenge of [[Pyrrhonian skepticism|extreme skepticism]]. Concerning such sceptics, he wrote:
{{Quote|But would these prejudiced reasoners reflect a moment, there are many obvious instances and arguments, sufficient to undeceive them, and make them enlarge their maxims and principles. Do they not see the vast variety of inclinations and pursuits among our species; where each man seems fully satisfied with his own course of life, and would esteem it the greatest unhappiness to be confined to that of his neighbour? Do they not feel in themselves, that what pleases at one time, displeases at another, by the change of inclination; and that it is not in their power, by their utmost efforts, to recall that taste or appetite, which formerly bestowed charms on what now appears indifferent or disagreeable? [...] Do you come to a philosopher as to a cunning man, to learn something by magic or witchcraft, beyond what can be known by common prudence and discretion?&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Hume|1987}} Chapter: ESSAY XVIII: THE SCEPTIC&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Ethics: "humanist"===
[[File:Anthony Ashley Cooper, 3. Earl of Shaftesbury.jpg|right|thumb|Anthony Ashley Cooper, third Earl of Shaftesbury, and proponent of a Roman-inspired concept of common sense.]]
Once Thomas Hobbes and [[Spinoza]] had applied Cartesian approaches to [[political philosophy]], concerns about the inhumanity of the deductive approach of Descartes increased. With this in mind, [[Anthony Ashley Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury|Shaftesbury]] and, much less known at the time, [[Giambattista Vico]], both presented new arguments for the importance of the Roman understanding of common sense, in what is now often referred to, after [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]], as a [[Renaissance Humanist|humanist]] interpretation of the term.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gadamer|1989|pages=19–26}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Their concern had several inter-related aspects. One ethical concern was the deliberately simplified method that treated human communities as made up of selfish independent individuals ([[methodological individualism]]), ignoring the ''[[sense of community]]'' that the Romans understood as part of common sense. Another connected epistemological concern was that by considering ''common good sense'' as inherently inferior to Cartesian conclusions developed from simple assumptions, an important type of wisdom was being arrogantly ignored.

Shaftesbury's seminal 1709 essay ''Sensus Communis: An Essay on the Freedom of Wit and Humour'' was a highly erudite and influential defense of the use of irony and humour in serious discussions, at least among men of "Good Breeding". He drew upon authors such as [[Seneca the Elder|Seneca]], [[Juvenal]], [[Horace]] and [[Marcus Aurelius]], for whom, he saw, common sense was not just a reference to widely held vulgar opinions, but something cultivated among educated people living in better communities. One aspect of this, later taken up by authors such as Kant, was good taste. Another very important aspect of common sense particularly interesting to later British political philosophers such as [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson]] was what came to be called ''moral sentiment'', which is different from a tribal or factional sentiment, but a more general fellow feeling that is very important for larger communities:
{{Quote|A {{Not a typo|public|k}} Spirit can come only from a social Feeling or ''Sense of Partnership'' with Human Kind. Now there are none so far from being ''Partners'' in this ''Sense'', or sharers in this ''common Affection'', as they who scarcely know ''an {{Not a typo|Equal|l}}'', nor consider themselves as subject to any law of ''Fellowship'' or ''Community''. And thus Morality and good Government go together.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Shaftesbury|2001}}, Volume I, Part III, section 1.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Hutcheson described it as, "a Publick Sense, viz. "our Determination to be pleased with the Happiness of others, and to be uneasy at their Misery."" which, he explains, "was sometimes called {{lang|grc|κοινονοημοσύνη}}&lt;ref&gt;Although Greek, this term {{lang|grc|koinonoēmosúnē}} is from the ''Meditations'' of the Roman emperor-philosopher, Marcus Aurelius, and was possibly coined by him. However Shaftesbury and others suspect it is a Stoic term. (Not many Stoic texts have survived.)&lt;/ref&gt; or Sensus Communis by some of the Antients".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Francis |last=Hutcheson| title=An Essay on the Nature and Conduct of the Passions and Affections, with Illustrations on the Moral Sense, ed. Aaron Garrett |publication-place=Indianapolis| publisher=Liberty Fund|year= 2002| chapter= section i: A general Account of our several Senses and Desires, Selfish or Publick|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/title/885/65922/1605681 |accessdate= 2013-07-25}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A reaction to Shaftesbury in defense of the Hobbesian approach of treating communities as driven by individual self-interest, was not long coming in [[Bernard Mandeville]]'s controversial works. Indeed, this approach was never fully rejected, at least in economics. And so despite the criticism heaped upon Mandeville and Hobbes by Adam Smith, Hutcheson's student and successor in Glasgow university, Smith made self-interest a core assumption within nascent modern economics, specifically as part of the practical justification for allowing free markets.

By the late enlightenment period in the 18th century, the communal sense or empathy pointed to by Shaftesbury and Hutcheson had become the "moral sense" or "[[moral sentiment]]" referred to by Hume and [[Adam Smith]], the latter writing in plural of the "moral sentiments" with the key one being ''[[sympathy]]'', which was not so much a public spirit as such, but a kind of extension of self-interest. [[Jeremy Bentham]] gives a summary of the plethora of terms used in British philosophy by the nineteenth century to describe common sense in discussions about ethics:
{{Quote|Another man comes and alters the phrase: leaving out moral, and putting in ''common'', in the room of it. He then tells you, that his common sense teaches him what is right and wrong, as surely as the other's moral sense did: meaning by common sense, a sense of some kind or other, which he says, is possessed by all mankind: the sense of those, whose sense is not the same as the author's, being struck out of the account as not worth taking.&lt;ref&gt;Chapter II, "OF PRINCIPLES ADVERSE TO THAT OF UTILITY", in "[http://oll.libertyfund.org/title/278/20719/941780 An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation]".&lt;/ref&gt;}} This was at least to some extent opposed to the Hobbesian approach, still today normal in economic theory, of trying to understand all human behaviour as fundamentally selfish, and would also be a foil to the new ethics of Kant. This understanding of a moral sense or public spirit remains a subject for discussion, although the term "common sense" is no longer commonly used for the sentiment itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gadamer|1989|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In several European languages, a separate term for this type of common sense is used. For example, French {{lang|fr|sens commun}} and German {{lang|de|Gemeinsinn}} are used for this feeling of human solidarity, while {{lang|fr|bon sens}} (good sense) and {{lang|de|gesunder Verstand}} (healthy understanding) are the terms for everyday "common sense".

According to Gadamer, at least in French and British philosophy a moral element in appeals to common sense (or {{lang|fr|bon sens}}), such as found in Reid, remains normal to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gadamer|1989|pages=25–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; But according to Gadamer, the civic quality implied in discussion of {{lang|la|sensus communis}} in other European countries did not take root in the German philosophy of the 18th and 19th centuries, despite the fact it consciously imitated much in English and French philosophy. "{{lang|la|Sensus communis|italic=no}} was understood as a purely theoretical judgment, parallel to moral consciousness ([[conscience]]) and [[taste]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gadamer|1989|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of {{lang|la|sensus communis}} "was emptied and intellectualized by the German enlightenment".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gadamer|1989|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; But German philosophy was becoming internationally important at this same time.

Gadamer notes one less-known exception—the [[Württemberg pietism]], inspired by the 18th century [[Swabia]]n churchman, M. [[Friedrich Christoph Oetinger]], who appealed to Shaftesbury and other Enlightenment figures in his critique of the Cartesian rationalism of [[Leibniz]] and [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Wolff]], who were the most important German philosophers before Kant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gadamer|1989|pages=27–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Giambattista Vico===
[[File:Giovan Battista Vico.jpg|right|thumb|Giambattista Vico. A defender of classical education in rhetoric, who analysed evidence of ancient wisdom in common sense.]]
Vico, who taught classical rhetoric in [[Naples]] (where Shaftesbury died) under a Cartesian-influenced Spanish government, was not widely read until the 20th century, but his writings on common sense have been an important influence upon [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]], [[Benedetto Croce]] and [[Antonio Gramsci#Hegemony|Antonio Gramsci]].&lt;ref name="Bugter1987" /&gt; Vico united the Roman and Greek meanings of the term {{lang|la|communis sensus}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Schaeffer|1990|page=3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Vico's initial use of the term, which was of much inspiration to Gadamer for example, appears in his ''On the Study Methods of our Time'', which was partly a defense of his own profession, given the reformist pressure upon both his University and the legal system in Naples. It presents common sense as something adolescents need to be trained in if they are not to "break into odd and arrogant behaviour when adulthood is reached", whereas teaching Cartesian method on its own harms common sense and stunts intellectual development. Rhetoric and elocution are not just for legal debate, but also educate young people to use their sense perceptions and their perceptions more broadly, building a fund of remembered images in their imagination, and then using ingenuity in creating linking metaphors, in order to make [[enthymeme]]s. Enthymemes are reasonings about uncertain truths and probabilities—as opposed to the Cartesian method, which was skeptical of all that could not be dealt with as [[syllogism]]s, including raw perceptions of physical bodies. Hence common sense is not just a "guiding standard of [[eloquence]]" but also "the standard of [[practical judgment]]". The imagination or fantasy, which under traditional Aristotelianism was often equated with the {{transl|grc|koinḕ aísthēsis}}, is built up under this training, becoming the "fund" (to use Schaeffer's term) accepting not only memories of things seen by an individual, but also metaphors and images known in the community, including the ones out of which language itself is made.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Schaeffer|1990}}, chapter 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

In its mature version, Vico's conception of {{lang|la|sensus communis}} is defined by him as "judgment without reflection, shared by an entire class, an entire people, and entire nation, or the entire human race". Vico proposed his own anti-Cartesian methodology for a new Baconian science, inspired, he said, by [[Plato]], [[Tacitus]],&lt;ref&gt;As remarked by several commentators such as Croce and [[Leo Strauss]], during this period citation of Tacitus is referred to as [[Tacitean]]ism, and was often a veiled way of showing the influence of [[Machiavelli]]. Citing Plato on the other hand, shows the typical rejection in this period of Aristotle and scholasticism, but not classical learning in its entirety.&lt;/ref&gt; Francis Bacon and [[Grotius]]. In this he went further than his predecessors concerning the ancient certainties available within vulgar common sense. What is required, according to his new science, is to find the common sense shared by different people and nations. He made this a basis for a new and better-founded approach to discuss [[Natural Law]], improving upon Grotius, [[John Selden]], and [[Pufendorf]] who he felt had failed to convince, because they could claim no authority from nature. Unlike Grotius, Vico went beyond looking for one single set of similarities amongst nations but also established rules about how natural law properly changes as peoples change, and has to be judged relative to this state of development. He thus developed a detailed view of an evolving wisdom of peoples. Ancient forgotten wisdoms, he claimed, could be re-discovered by analysis of languages and myths formed under the influence of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Vico|1968}}, I.ii "Elements" (§§141-146) and I.iv "Method" (§§347-350).&lt;/ref&gt; This is comparable to both [[Montesquieu]]'s ''[[Spirit of the Laws]]'', as well as much later [[Hegel]]ian [[historicism]], both of which apparently developed without any awareness of Vico's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.cklawreview.com/wp-content/uploads/vol83no3/Bayer.pdf|last=Bayer|journal=Chicago-Kent Law Review|volume=83|issue=3|year=1990|title=Vico's principle of ''sensus communis'' and forensic eloquence}}.

Contemporary with Hume, but critical of Hume's scepticism, a so-called [[Scottish Common Sense Realism|Scottish school of Common Sense]] formed, whose basic principle was enunciated by its founder and greatest figure, [[Thomas Reid]]:
{{Quote|If there are certain principles, as I think there are, which the constitution of our nature leads us to believe, and which we are under a necessity to take for granted in the common concerns of life, without being able to give a reason for them — these are what we call the principles of common sense; and what is manifestly contrary to them, is what we call absurd.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|editor-last=Cuneo |editor2-last=Woudenberg|title=The Cambridge companion to Thomas Reid|year=2004| page= 85 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DpQAg6CTl3QC&amp;pg=PA85|isbn=9780521012089}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Thomas Reid was a successor to Francis Hutcheson and Adam Smith as [[Professor of Moral Philosophy, Glasgow]]. While Reid's interests lay in the defense of common sense as a type of self-evident knowledge available to individuals, this was also part of a defense of natural law in the style of Grotius. He believed that the term common sense as he used it did encompass both the social common sense described by Shaftesbury and Hutcheson, and the perceptive powers described by Aristotelians.

Reid was criticised, partly for his critique of Hume, by Kant and [[J. S. Mill]], who were two of the most important influences in nineteenth century philosophy. He was blamed for over-stating Hume's scepticism of commonly held beliefs, and more importantly for not perceiving the problem with any claim that common sense could ever fulfill Cartesian (or Kantian) demands for absolute knowledge. Reid furthermore emphasized inborn common sense as opposed to only experience and sense perception. In this way his common sense has a similarity to the assertion of {{lang|la|a priori}} knowledge asserted by rationalists like Descartes and Kant, despite Reid's criticism of Descartes concerning his theory of ideas. Hume was critical of Reid on this point.

Despite the criticism, the influence of the Scottish school was notable for example upon American [[pragmatism]], and modern [[Thomism]]. The influence has been particularly important concerning the epistemological importance of a {{lang|la|sensus communis}} for any possibility of rational discussion between people.

==Kant: In aesthetic taste==
[[File:Kant foto.jpg|right|thumb|Immanuel Kant proposed that {{lang|la|sensus communis}} ({{lang-de|Gemeinsinn}}) was a useful concept for understanding aesthetics, but he was critical of the Scottish school's appeals to ordinary widely shared common sense ({{lang|de|gesunden Verstand}}) as a basis of real knowledge.]]
[[Immanuel Kant]] developed a new variant of the idea of {{lang|la|sensus communis}}, noting how having a sensitivity for what opinions are widely shared and comprehensible gives a sort of standard for judgment, and objective discussion, at least in the field of [[aesthetics]] and taste:

{{Quote|multiline=y|''The common Understanding of men'' [{{lang|de|gemeine Menschenverstand}}], which, as the mere sound (not yet cultivated) Understanding, we regard as the least to be expected from any one claiming the name of man, has therefore the doubtful honour of being given the name of common sense [{{lang|de|Namen des Gemeinsinnes}}] ({{lang|la|sensus communis}}); and in such a way that by the name common (not merely in our language, where the word actually has a double signification, but in many others) we understand vulgar, that which is everywhere met with, the possession of which indicates absolutely no merit or superiority.

But under the {{lang|la|sensus communis}} we must include the Idea of a ''communal'' sense [{{lang|de|eines gemeinschaftlichen Sinnes}}], i.e. of a faculty of judgement, which in its reflection takes account ({{lang|la|a priori|italic=no}}) of the mode of representation of all other men in thought; in order as it were to compare its judgement with the collective Reason of humanity, and thus to escape the illusion arising from the private conditions that could be so easily taken for objective, which would injuriously affect the judgement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Kant|1914}}. Key German terms are added in square brackets. See [http://www.korpora.org/Kant/aa05/293.html German text].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Kant saw this concept as answering a particular need in his system: "the question of why aesthetic judgments are valid: since aesthetic judgments are a perfectly normal function of the same faculties of cognition involved in ordinary cognition, they will have the same universal validity as such ordinary acts of cognition".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/kantaest/|title=Kant's Aesthetics|first=Douglas |last=Burnham}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But Kant's overall approach was very different from those of Hume or Vico. Like Descartes, he rejected appeals to uncertain sense perception and common sense (except in the very specific way he describes concerning aesthetics), or the prejudices of one's "{{lang|de|[[Weltanschauung]]}}", and tried to give a new way to certainty through methodical logic, and an assumption of a type of {{lang|la|[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]}} knowledge. He was also not in agreement with Reid and the Scottish school, who he criticized in his ''[[Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics]]'' as using "the magic wand of common sense", and not properly confronting the "metaphysical" problem defined by Hume, which Kant wanted to be solved scientifically—the problem of how to use reason to consider how one ought to act.

Kant used different words to refer to his aesthetic {{lang|la|sensus communis}}, for which he used Latin or else German {{lang|de|Gemeinsinn}}, and the more general English meaning which he associated with Reid and his followers, for which he used various terms such as {{lang|de|gemeinen Menscheverstand}}, {{lang|de|gesunden Verstand}}, or {{lang|de|gemeinen Verstand}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Rosenfeld|2011}}, p.&amp;nbsp;312, note 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Gadamer, in contrast to the "wealth of meaning" that Vico and Shaftesbury brought from the Roman tradition into their humanism, Kant "developed his moral philosophy in explicit opposition to the doctrine of "moral feeling" that had been worked out in English philosophy". The [[moral imperative]] "cannot be based on feeling, not even if one does not mean an individual's feeling but common moral sensibility".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gadamer|1989|pages=32–34}}. Note: The source makes it clear that "English" includes Scottish authors.&lt;/ref&gt; For Kant, the {{lang|la|sensus communis}} only applied to taste, and the meaning of taste was also narrowed as it was no longer understood as any kind of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gadamer|1989|pages=34–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taste, for Kant, is universal only in that it results from "the free play of all our cognitive powers", and is communal only in that it "abstracts from all subjective, private conditions such as attractiveness and emotion".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gadamer|1989|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kant himself did not see himself as a relativist, and was aiming to give knowledge a more solid basis, but as [[Richard J. Bernstein]] remarks, reviewing this same critique of Gadamer:
{{Quote|Once we begin to question whether there is a common faculty of taste (a {{lang|la|sensus communis}}), we are easily led down the path to [[relativism]]. And this is what did happen after Kant—so much so that today it is extraordinarily difficult to retrieve any idea of taste or aesthetic judgment that is more than the expression of personal preferences. Ironically (given Kant's intentions), the same tendency has worked itself out with a vengeance with regards to all judgments of value, including moral judgments.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Richard| last=Bernstein| title=Beyond Objectivism and Relativism: Science, Hermeneutics, and Praxis| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=guJ0-eBoFAEC| year=1983| isbn=0812205502}}, p.&amp;nbsp;120.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Contemporary philosophy==

===Epistemology===
Continuing the tradition of Reid and the enlightenment generally, the common sense of individuals trying to understand reality continues to be a serious subject in philosophy. In America, Reid influenced [[C. S. Peirce]], the founder of the philosophical movement now known as [[Pragmatism]], which has become internationally influential. One of the names Peirce used for the movement was "Critical Common-Sensism". Peirce, who wrote after [[Charles Darwin]], suggested that Reid and Kant's ideas about inborn common sense could be explained by evolution. But while such beliefs might be well adapted to primitive conditions, they were not infallible, and could not always be relied upon.

Another example still influential today is from [[G. E. Moore]], several of whose essays, such as the 1925 "[[A Defence of Common Sense]]", argued that individuals can make many types of statements about what they judge to be true, and that the individual and everyone else knows to be true. [[Michael Huemer]] has advocated an epistemic theory he calls ''[[phenomenal conservatism]]'', which he claims to accord with common sense by way of [[Internalism and externalism|internalist]] [[intuition]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iep.utm.edu/phen-con/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethics: what the community would think===
In twentieth century philosophy the concept of the {{lang|la|sensus communis}} as discussed by Vico and especially Kant became a major topic of philosophical discussion. The theme of this discussion questions how far the understanding of eloquent rhetorical discussion (in the case of Vico), or communally sensitive aesthetic tastes (in the case of Kant) can give a standard or model for political, ethical and legal discussion in a world where forms of [[relativism]] are commonly accepted, and serious dialogue between very different nations is essential. Some philosophers such as [[Jacques Rancière]] indeed take the lead from [[Jean-François Lyotard]] and refer to the "[[postmodern]]" condition as one where there is "{{lang|la|dissensus communis}}".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|editor1-last=van Haute|editor2-last=Birmingham|title=Dissensus Communis: Between Ethics and Politics|year=1995|publisher=Kok Pharos|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BK9OTGZ62NEC|isbn=9789039004036}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hannah Arendt cropped.jpg|right|thumb|Hannah Arendt, who proposed an adaptation of Kant's aesthetic concept of common sense as having broader relevance to political philosophy.]]

[[Hannah Arendt]] adapted Kant's concept of {{lang|la|sensus communis}} as a faculty of aesthetic judgement that imagines the judgements of others, into something relevant for political judgement. Thus she created a "Kantian" political philosophy, which, as she said herself, Kant did not write. She argued that there was often a banality to evil in the real world, for example in the case of someone like [[Adolf Eichmann]], which consisted in a lack of {{lang|la|sensus communis}} and thoughtfulness generally. Arendt and also [[Jürgen Habermas]], who took a similar position concerning Kant's {{lang|la|sensus communis}}, were criticised by Lyotard for their use of Kant's {{lang|la|sensus communis}} as a standard for real political judgement. Lyotard also saw Kant's {{lang|la|sensus communis}} as an important concept for understanding political judgement, not aiming at any consensus, but rather at a possibility of a "[[euphony]]" in "dis-sensus". Lyotard claimed that any attempt to impose any {{lang|la|sensus communis}} in real politics would mean imposture by an empowered faction upon others.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Judging Lyotard| editor-first=Andrew |editor-last=Benjamin| year=1992| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qy17kj4oFocC| isbn=9781134940622 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a parallel development, [[Antonio Gramsci]], Benedetto Croce, and later Hans-Georg Gadamer took inspiration from Vico's understanding of common sense as a kind of wisdom of nations, going beyond Cartesian method. It has been suggested that Gadamer's most well-known work, ''[[Truth and Method]]'', can be read as an "extended meditation on the implications of Vico's defense of the rhetorical tradition in response to the nascent methodologism that ultimately dominated academic enquiry".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Gadamer and Ricoeur: Critical Horizons for Contemporary Hermeneutics| editor1-first=Francis J. |editor1-last=Mootz III| editor2-first= George H. |editor2-last=Taylor| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nIj4Gi11pJgC|page=84|last=Mootz|chapter=Gadamer's Rhetorical Conception of Hermeneutics as the key to developing a Critical Hermeneutics| isbn=9781441175991 | date=2011-06-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of Gadamer, this was in specific contrast to the {{lang|la|sensus communis}} concept in Kant, which he felt (in agreement with Lyotard) could not be relevant to politics if used in its original sense.

Gadamer came into direct debate with his contemporary Habermas, the so-called {{lang|de|[[Hermeneutikstreit]]}}. Habermas, with a self-declared Enlightenment "prejudice against prejudice" argued that if breaking free from the restraints of language is not the aim of dialectic, then social science will be dominated by whoever wins debates, and thus Gadamer's defense of {{lang|la|sensus communis}} effectively defends traditional prejudices. Gadamer argued that being critical requires being critical of prejudices including the prejudice against prejudice. Some prejudices will be true. And Gadamer did not share Habermas' acceptance that aiming at going beyond language through method was not itself potentially dangerous. Furthermore, he insisted that because all understanding comes through language, hermeneutics has a claim to universality. As Gadamer wrote in the "Afterword" of ''[[Truth and Method]]'', "I find it frighteningly unreal when people like Habermas ascribe to rhetoric a compulsory quality that one must reject in favor of unconstrained, rational dialogue".

[[Paul Ricoeur]] argued that Gadamer and Habermas were both right in part. As a hermeneutist like Gadamer he agreed with him about the problem of lack of any perspective outside of history, pointing out that Habermas himself argued as someone coming from a particular tradition. He also agreed with Gadamer that hermeneutics is a "basic kind of knowing on which others rest."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_KoqK3bl2MAC&amp;pg=PA149|page=149|title=Theology After Ricoeur: New Directions in Hermeneutical Theology
|first= Dan |last= Stiver|year=2001|isbn=9780664222437}}&lt;/ref&gt; But he felt that Gadamer under-estimated the need for a dialectic that was critical and distanced, and attempting to go behind language.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Gadamer and Ricoeur: Critical Horizons for Contemporary Hermeneutics| editor1-first= Francis J. |editor1-last=Mootz III| editor2-first=George H. |editor2-last=Taylor| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nIj4Gi11pJgC|chapter=Paul Ricoeur's and Hans-Georg Gadamer's diverging reflections on recognition|last=Vessey| isbn= 9781441175991 | date= 2011-06-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Paul Ricoeur: The Promise and Risk of Politics|first= Bernard |last= Dauenhauer|year=1998|publisher=Rowman and Littlefield|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ifdWn6SuswMC|isbn= 9780585177724 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent commentator on Vico, John D. Schaeffer has argued that Gadamer's approach to {{lang|la|sensus communis}} exposed itself to the criticism of Habermas because it "privatized" it, removing it from a changing and oral community, following the Greek philosophers in rejecting true communal rhetoric, in favour of forcing the concept within a [[Socratic dialectic]] aimed at truth. Schaeffer claims that Vico's concept provides a third option to those of Habermas and Gadamer and he compares it to the recent philosophers [[Richard J. Bernstein]], [[Bernard Williams]], [[Richard Rorty]], and [[Alasdair MacIntyre]], and the recent theorist of rhetoric, [[Richard Lanham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Schaeffer|1990}}, chapters 5–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Moral sense" as opposed to "rationality"===
The other Enlightenment debate about common sense, concerning common sense as a term for an emotion or drive that is unselfish, also continues to be important in discussion of social science, and especially [[economics]]. The axiom that communities can be usefully modeled as a collection of [[homo economicus|self-interested individuals]] is a central assumption in much of modern [[mathematical economics]], and mathematical economics has now come to be an influential tool of political decision making.

While the term "common sense" had already become less commonly used as a term for the empathetic moral sentiments by the time of Adam Smith, debates continue about [[methodological individualism]] as something supposedly justified philosophically for methodological reasons (as argued for example by [[Milton Friedman]] and more recently by [[Gary Becker|Gary S. Becker]], both members of the so-called [[Chicago school of economics]]).&lt;ref&gt;See for example [[Albert O. Hirschman]], "Against Parsimony: Three Easy Ways of Complicating Some Categories of Economic Discourse." Bulletin of the ''American Academy of Arts and Sciences'' 37, {{abbr|no.|number}} 8 (May '''1984'''): 11–28.&lt;/ref&gt; As in the Enlightenment, this debate therefore continues to combine debates about not only what the individual motivations of people are, but also what can be known about scientifically, and what should be usefully assumed for methodological reasons, even if the truth of the assumptions are strongly doubted. Economics and social science generally have been criticized as a refuge of Cartesian methodology. Hence, amongst critics of the methodological argument for assuming self-centeredness in economics are authors such as [[Deirdre McCloskey]], who have taken their bearings from the above-mentioned philosophical debates involving Habermas, Gadamer, the anti-Cartesian [[Richard Rorty]] and others, arguing that trying to force economics to follow artificial methodological laws is bad, and it is better to recognize social science as driven by rhetoric.

==Catholic theology==
Among Catholic theologians, writers such as theologian [[François Fénelon]] and philosopher [[Claude Buffier]] (1661–1737) gave an anti-Cartesian defense of common sense as a foundation for knowledge. Other catholic theologians took up this approach, and attempts were made to combine this with more traditional Thomism, for example [[Jean-Marie de Lamennais]]. This was similar to the approach of Thomas Reid, who for example was a direct influence on [[Théodore Simon Jouffroy|Théodore Jouffroy]]. This however meant basing knowledge upon something uncertain, and irrational. [[Matteo Liberatore]], seeking an approach more consistent with Aristotle and Aquinas, equated this foundational common sense with the {{transl|grc|koinaí dóxai}} of Aristotle, that correspond to the {{lang|la|communes conceptiones}} of Aquinas.&lt;ref name="gil1" /&gt; In the twentieth century, this debate is especially associated with [[Étienne Gilson]] and [[Reginald Garrigou-Lagrange]].&lt;ref name="murph"&gt;{{citation|title= Art and Intellect in the Philosophy of Etienne Gilson| first= Francesca |last= Aran Murphy|year= 2004| publisher= University of Missouri Press|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Ix8sIb9w1tsC| isbn= 9780826262387 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gilson pointed out that Liberatore's approach means categorizing such common beliefs as the existence of God or the immortality of the soul, under the same heading as (in Aristotle and Aquinas) such logical beliefs as that it is impossible for something to exist and not exist at the same time. This, according to Gilson, is going beyond the original meaning. Concerning Liberatore he wrote:

{{Quote|Endeavours of this sort always end in defeat. In order to confer a technical philosophical value upon the common sense of orators and moralists it is necessary either to accept Reid's common sense as a sort of unjustified and unjustifiable instinct, which will destroy Thomism, or to reduce it to the Thomist [[nous|intellect]] and reason, which will result in its being suppressed as a specifically distinct faculty of knowledge. In short, there can be no middle ground between Reid and St. Thomas.&lt;ref name="gil1" /&gt;}}

Gilson argued that Thomism avoided the problem of having to decide between Cartesian innate certainties and Reid's uncertain common sense, and that "as soon as the problem of the existence of the external world was presented in terms of common sense, Cartesianism was accepted".&lt;ref name="murph" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6873">'''Computational genomics''' (often referred to as Computational Genetics) refers to the use of computational and statistical analysis to decipher biology from [[genome sequence]]s and related data,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Koonin EV | title = Computational genomics | journal = Current Biology | volume = 11 | issue = 5 | pages = R155–8 | date = March 2001 | pmid = 11267880 | doi = 10.1016/S0960-9822(01)00081-1 | url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0960-9822(01)00081-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; including both [[DNA]] and [[RNA]] sequence as well as other "post-genomic" data (i.e., experimental data obtained with technologies that require the genome sequence, such as genomic [[DNA microarrays]]). These, in combination with computational and statistical approaches to understanding the function of the genes and statistical association analysis, this field is also often referred to as [[Computational and Statistical Genetics]]/genomics. As such, computational genomics may be regarded as a subset of [[bioinformatics]] and [[computational biology]], but with a focus on using whole genomes (rather than individual genes) to understand the principles of how the DNA of a species controls its biology at the molecular level and beyond.  With the current abundance of massive biological datasets, computational studies have become one of the most important means to biological discovery.&lt;ref name="MIT"&gt;[http://www.eecs.mit.edu/bioeecs/CompGenProt.html Computational Genomics and Proteomics at MIT]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The roots of computational genomics are shared with those of [[bioinformatics]]. During the 1960s, [[Margaret Dayhoff]] and others at the National Biomedical Research Foundation assembled databases of homologous protein sequences for evolutionary study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mount |first=David | name-list-format = vanc |title=Bioinformatics, Sequence and Genome Analysis |publisher=Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-87969-597-2 |pages=2–3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their research developed a [[phylogenetic tree]] that determined the evolutionary changes that were required for a particular protein to change into another protein based on the underlying [[amino acid]] sequences.  This led them to create a scoring matrix that assessed the likelihood of one protein being related to another.

Beginning in the 1980s, databases of genome sequences began to be recorded, but this presented new challenges in the form of searching and comparing the databases of gene information.  Unlike text-searching algorithms that are used on websites such as Google or Wikipedia, searching for sections of genetic similarity requires one to find strings that are not simply identical, but similar.  This led to the development of the [[Needleman-Wunsch algorithm]], which is a [[dynamic programming]] algorithm for comparing sets of amino acid sequences with each other by using scoring matrices derived from the earlier research by Dayhoff.  Later, the [[BLAST]] algorithm was developed for performing fast, optimized searches of gene sequence databases.  BLAST and its derivatives are probably the most widely used algorithms for this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  |vauthors = Brown TA |title=Genomes |publisher=Wiley |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-471-31618-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The emergence of the phrase "computational genomics" coincides with the availability of complete sequenced genomes in the mid-to-late 1990s. The first meeting of the Annual Conference on Computational Genomics was organized by scientists from [[The Institute for Genomic Research]] (TIGR) in 1998, providing a forum for this speciality and effectively distinguishing this area of science from the more general fields of [[Genomics]] or [[Computational Biology]].{{cn|date=October 2018}}  The first use of this term in scientific literature, according to [[MEDLINE]] abstracts, was just one year earlier in [[Nucleic Acids Research]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wagner A | title = A computational genomics approach to the identification of gene networks | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 25 | issue = 18 | pages = 3594–604 | date = September 1997 | pmid = 9278479 | pmc = 146952 | doi = 10.1093/nar/25.18.3594 | url = http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/content/25/18/3594.long }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The final Computational Genomics conference was held in 2006, featuring a keynote talk by Nobel Laureate [[Barry Marshall]], co-discoverer of the link between [[Helicobacter pylori]] and stomach ulcers.  As of 2014, the leading conferences in the field include [[Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology]] (ISMB) and [[Research in Computational Molecular Biology]] (RECOMB).

The development of computer-assisted mathematics (using products such as [[Mathematica]] or [[Matlab]]) has helped engineers, mathematicians and computer scientists to start operating in this domain, and a public collection 
of case studies and demonstrations is growing, ranging from whole genome comparisons to [[gene expression]] analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Cristianini N, Hahn M |title=Introduction to Computational Genomics |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-521-67191-0 |url=http://www.computational-genomics.net/}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has increased the introduction of different ideas, including concepts from systems and control, information theory, strings analysis and data mining. It is anticipated that computational approaches will become and remain a standard topic for research and teaching, while students fluent in both topics start being formed in the multiple courses created in the past few years.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2610">'''Cost escalation''can be defined as changes in the cost or price of specific goods or services in a given economy over a period. This is similar to the concepts of [[inflation]] and [[deflation]] except that escalation is specific to an item or class of items (not as general in nature), it is often not primarily driven by changes in the money supply, and it tends to be less sustained. While escalation includes general inflation related to the money supply, it is also driven by changes in technology, practices, and particularly supply-demand imbalances that are specific to a good or service in a given economy. For example, while general inflation (e.g., [[consumer price index]]) in the US was less than 5% in the 2003-2007 time period, steel prices increased (escalated) by over 50% because of supply-demand imbalance. Cost escalation may contribute to a project [[cost overrun]] but it is not synonymous with it.

Over long periods of time, as market supply and demand imbalances are corrected, escalation will tend to more-or-less equal inflation unless there are sustained technology or efficiency changes in a market.

Escalation is usually calculated by examining the changes in [[price index]] measures for a good or service. Future escalation can be forecast using [[econometrics]]. Unfortunately, because escalation (unlike inflation) may occur in a micro-market, and it may be hard to measure with surveys, indices can be difficult to find. For example, the [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] has a price index for construction wages and compensation (what the construction contractor's labor cost), but has none for the prices that owners must pay the construction contractor for their services.&lt;ref name="Specialist Groundworks Contractors"&gt;{{cite news | date=2014-01-03 | url=http://www.eks-construction.co.uk| title=Specialist Groundworks Contractors| publisher=Construction Group Association  | author=Paul Henssen| accessdate=2015-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[cost engineering]] and [[project management]] usage, escalation and [[cost contingency]] are both considered risk funds, that should be included in project estimates and budgets. When escalation is minimal, it is sometimes estimated together with contingency. However, this is not a best practice, particularly when escalation is significant.&lt;ref&gt;"Escalation Estimation: Working With Economics Consultants", John K. Hollmann; Larry R. Dysert, 2007 AACE International Transactions, AACE International, Morgantown, WV, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fields of [[chronology]] and [[periodization]], an '''epoch''' is an instant in time chosen as the origin of a particular [[calendar era|era]]. The "epoch" then serves as a reference point from which time is measured. [[Time#Measurement|Time measurement units]] are counted from the epoch so that the date and time of events can be specified unambiguously.

Events taking place before the epoch can be dated by counting negatively from the epoch, though in pragmatic [[periodization]] practice, epochs are defined for the past, and another epoch is used to start the next era, therefore serving as the ending of the older preceding era. The whole purpose and criteria of such definitions are to clarify and co-ordinate scholarship about a period, at times, across disciplines.

Epochs are generally chosen to be convenient or significant by a consensus of the time scale's initial users, or by authoritarian fiat. The epoch moment or date is usually defined by ''a specific clear event'', condition, or criterion—the epoch event or epoch criterion—from which the period or era or age is usually characterized or described.

== Calendar eras ==
=== Regnal eras ===
{{see|Regnal era}}
The official [[Japanese era name|Japanese system]] numbers years from the accession of the current [[Emperor of Japan|emperor]], regarding the calendar year during which the accession occurred as the first year.
A similar [[Chinese era name|system]] existed in [[China]] before 1912, being based on the accession year of the emperor (1911 was thus the third year of the [[Xuantong]] period). With the establishment of the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] in 1912, the republican era was introduced. It is still very common in [[Taiwan]] to date events via the republican era. The People's Republic of China adopted the common era calendar in 1949 (the 38th year of the Chinese Republic).

=== Pre-modern eras ===
* [[Olympiad]]s, the ancient Greek era of four-year periods beginning in 776 BC.
* [[Ab urbe condita]] (753 BC), used in the Roman imperial period.
* The [[Anno Domini]] or "[[Common Era]]" era, still in use with the [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]] and [[Julian calendar]]s today, marks the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation of Jesus]] as calculated in the 6th century by [[Dionysius Exiguus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Blackburn |first1=B |last2=Holford-Strevens |first2=L |date=2003 |title=The Oxford Companion to the Year: An exploration of calendar customs and time-reckoning |publisher=Oxford University Press |chapter=Incarnation era |page=881}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Anno Mundi]] (years since the creation of the world) as used in the [[Byzantine calendar]] (5509 BC).
* [[Anno Mundi]] (years since the creation of the world) as used in the [[Hebrew calendar]] (3761 BC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/counting-the-years/ |title=Counting the Jewish Years |website=myjewishlearning.com |last=Solomin |first=Rachel M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lee |first=Scott E. |date=2006 |url=http://www.rosettacalendar.com/calendars.html |title=Overview of Calendars |website=rosettacalendar.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Islamic calendar]] counts "lunar years" by ''Anno Hegiræ'' (in the year of the ''[[Hijra (Islam)|hijra]]'') or ''AH'' era (AD 622). The year count shifts relative to the solar year as the calendar is [[lunar calendar|purely lunar]]. The official [[Iranian calendars|Iranian calendar]] (used in [[Afghanistan]] as well as [[Iran]]) also dates from the ''hijra'', but as it is a [[solar calendar]] its year numbering does not coincide with the religious calendar.
* The term [[Hindu calendar]] may refer to a number of traditional Indian calendars. A notable example of a Hindu epoch is the [[Vikram Samvat]] (58 BC),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| edition = 3rd| publisher = Cambridge University Press| isbn = 978-0-521-70238-6| last1 = Dershowitz| first1 = Nachum| authorlink1 = Nachum Dershowitz | last2 = Reingold| first2 = Edward M.| authorlink2 = Edward Reingold  |title = Calendrical Calculations| date = 2008 | page = 289}}&lt;/ref&gt; also used in modern times as  "national calendar" of [[Nepal]] and [[Bangladesh]].
*   [[Buddhist calendar]]s tend to use the epoch of 544 BC (date of Buddha's ''[[parinirvana]]'').

=== Modern eras ===
* The [[Baha'i calendar]] is dated from the vernal equinox of the year the [[Báb]] proclaimed his religion (AD 1844). Years are grouped in Váḥids of 19 years, and Kull-i-Shay’s of 361 (19 x 19) years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=E. G. |last=Richards |chapter=Calendars |editor-first1=S.

* In [[Thailand]] in 1888 King [[Chulalongkorn]] decreed a National Thai Era dating from the founding of [[Bangkok]] on April 6, 1782. In 1912, New Year's Day was shifted to April 1. In 1941, Prime Minister [[Plaek Pibulsonggram|Phibunsongkhram]] decided to count the years since 543 BC. This is the [[Thai solar calendar]] using the Thai Buddhist Era. Except for this era, it is the Gregorian calendar.
* In the [[French Republican Calendar]], a calendar used by the French government for about twelve years from late 1793, the epoch was the beginning of the "Republican Era", September 22, 1792 (the day the [[French First Republic]] was proclaimed, one day after the Convention abolished the monarchy).
* The [[Indian national calendar]], introduced in 1957, follows the [[Saka era]] (AD 78).
* [[Minguo calendar]] used by officials of [[Taiwan]] and [[Republic of China (1912–49)|its predecessor]] since January 1, 1912, the first year after [[Xinhai Revolution]] which overthrew [[Qing dynasty|Qing Empire]] and the subsequent establishment of the republic.
* [[North Korea]] uses a system that starts in 1912 (= [[Juche]] 1), the year of the birth of their founder [[Kim Il-Sung]].
* In the scientific [[Before Present]] system of numbering years for purposes of [[radiocarbon dating]], the reference date is January 1, 1950 (though the use of January 1 is quite irrelevant, as radiocarbon dating has limited precision).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.c14dating.com/agecalc.html |website=c14dating.com |title=Radiocarbon dating – Age calculation |last=Higham |first=Thomas |authorlink1= Thomas Higham |publisher=Thomas Higham |accessdate=December 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stuiver |first=Minze |author2=Polach HA |year=1977 |title=Discussion; reporting of C-14 data. |journal=Radiocarbon |publisher=University of Arizona |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=355–363 |url=https://journals.uair.arizona.edu/index.php/radiocarbon/article/view/493/498 |accessdate=October 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Different branches of [[Freemasonry]] have selected different years to date their documents according to a [[Masonic era]], such as the [[Anno Lucis]] (A.L.).

== Astronomy ==

{{Main|Epoch (astronomy)}}

In astronomy, an epoch is a specific moment in time for which [[Celestial coordinate system|celestial coordinates]] or [[orbital elements]] are specified, and from which other orbital parametrics are thereafter calculated in order to predict future position. The applied tools of the mathematics disciplines of [[Celestial mechanics]] or its subfield [[Orbital mechanics]] (both predict orbital paths and positions) about a [[center of gravity]] are used to generate an [[ephemeris]] (plural: ''ephemerides''; from the Greek word ''ephemeros'' = daily) which is a table of values that gives the positions of astronomical objects in the sky at a given time or times, or a formula to calculate such given the proper time offset from the epoch. Such calculations generally result in an elliptical path on a plane defined by some point on the orbit, and the two foci of the [[ellipse]]. Viewing from another orbiting body, following its own trace and orbit, creates shifts in three dimensions in the spherical trigonometry used to calculate relative positions. These dynamics in three dimensions are also elliptical, which means the ephemeris need only specify one set of equations to be a useful predictive tool to predict future location of the object of interest.

Over time, inexactitudes and other errors accumulate, creating more and greater errors of prediction, so ephemeris factors need to be recalculated from time to time, and that requires a new epoch to be defined. Different astronomers or groups of astronomers used to define epochs to suit themselves, but in these days of speedy communications, the epochs are generally defined in an international agreement, so astronomers worldwide can collaborate more effectively. It was inefficient and error prone for data observed by one group to need translation (mathematic transformation) so other groups could compare information.

=== J2000.0 ===
The current standard epoch is called "[[J2000.0]]" This is defined by international agreement to be equivalent to:
# The [[Gregorian date]] January 1, 2000 at approximately 12:00 GMT ([[Greenwich Mean Time]]).
# The [[Julian date]] 2451545.0 TT ([[Terrestrial Time]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |editor-first=P. K. |editor-last=Seidelman  |encyclopedia=Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac |location=Sausalito, CA |publisher=University Science Books |date=1992 |pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# January 1, 2000, 11:59:27.816 TAI ([[International Atomic Time]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |editor-first=P. K. |editor-last=Seidelman  |encyclopedia=Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac |location=Sausalito, CA |publisher=University Science Books |date=1992 |title=Glossary: Terrestrial Dynamical Time}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# January 1, 2000, 11:58:55.816 UTC ([[Coordinated Universal Time]]).{{efn|This article uses a 24-hour clock, so 11:59:27.816 is equivalent to 11:59:27.816 AM.}}

== Computing == &lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Microsoft Office Excel]] --&gt;
The [[system time|time kept internally]] by a [[computer]] system is usually expressed as the number of time units that have elapsed since a specified epoch, which is nearly always specified as midnight [[Universal Time]] on some particular date.

Software timekeeping systems vary widely in the granularity of their time units; some systems may use time units as large as a day, while others may use [[nanosecond]]s. For example, for an epoch date of midnight UTC (00:00) on January 1, 1900, and a time unit of a second, the time of the midnight (24:00) between January 1 and 2, 1900 is represented by the number 86400, the number of seconds in one day. When times prior to the epoch need to be represented, it is common to use the same system, but with negative numbers.

These representations of time are mainly for internal use. If an end user interaction with dates and times is required, the software will nearly always convert this internal number into a date and time representation that is comprehensible to humans.

=== Notable epoch dates in computing ===
{{See also|System time}}
The following table lists epoch dates used by popular software and other computer-related systems. The time in these systems is stored as the quantity of a particular time unit (days, seconds, nanoseconds, etc.) that has elapsed since a stated time (usually midnight UTC at the beginning of the given date).

=== Problems with epoch-based computer time representation ===

Computers do not generally store arbitrarily large numbers. Instead, each number stored by a computer is allotted a fixed amount of space. Therefore, when the number of time units that have elapsed since a system's epoch exceeds the largest number that can fit in the space allotted to the time representation, the time representation [[arithmetic overflow|overflows]], and problems can occur. While a system's behavior after overflow occurs is not necessarily predictable, in most systems the number representing the time will reset to zero, and the computer system will think that the current time is the epoch time again.

Most famously, older systems which counted time as the number of years elapsed since the epoch of January 1, 1900 and which only allotted enough space to store the numbers 0 through 99, experienced the [[Year 2000 problem]]. These systems (if not corrected beforehand) would interpret the date January 1, 2000 as January 1, 1900, leading to unpredictable errors at the beginning of the year 2000.

Even systems which allocate more storage to the time representation are not immune from this kind of error. Many [[Unix-like]] [[operating system]]s which keep time as seconds elapsed from the epoch date of January 1, 1970, and allot timekeeping enough storage to store numbers as large as  {{nowrap|2 147 483 647}} will experience an overflow problem on January 19, 2038 if not fixed beforehand. This is known as the [[Year 2038 problem]]. A correction involving doubling the storage allocated to timekeeping on these systems will allow them to represent dates more than 290 billion years into the future.

Other more subtle timekeeping problems exist in computing, such as accounting for [[leap second]]s, which are not observed with any predictability or regularity. Additionally, applications which need to represent historical dates and times (for example, representing a date prior to the switch from the [[Julian calendar]] to the [[Gregorian calendar]]) must use specialized timekeeping [[library (computing)|libraries]].

Finally, some software must maintain compatibility with older software that does not keep time in strict accordance with traditional timekeeping systems. For example, [[Microsoft Excel]] observes the fictional date of [[February 29, 1900]] in order to maintain compatibility with older versions of [[Lotus 1-2-3]].&lt;ref name="excel-leapyear" /&gt; Lotus 1-2-3 observed the date due to an error; by the time the error was discovered, it was too late to fix it—"a change now would disrupt formulas which were written to accommodate this anomaly".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last2=Reingold |first2=Edward |author-link2=Edward Reingold |last1=Dershowitz |first1=Nachum |author-link1=Nachum Dershowitz |date=2008 |edition=3rd |title=Calendrical Calculations |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-70238-6 |pages=xxi, xxvi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Epoch in satellite-based time systems ===

There are at least six [[satellite navigation]] systems, all of which function by transmitting [[time signal]]s. Of the only two satellite systems with global coverage, [[GPS]] calculates its time signal from an epoch, whereas [[GLONASS]] calculates time as an offset from [[UTC]], with the UTC input adjusted for [[leap seconds]]. Of the only two other systems aiming for global coverage, [[Galileo positioning system|Galileo]] calculates from an epoch and [[Compass navigation system|Beidou]] calculates from UTC without adjustment for leap seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web |url=http://www.navipedia.net/index.php/Time_References_in_GNSS |title=Time References in GNSS |first1=J.

Juan |last2=Zornoza |first3=M. |last3=Hernández-Pajares |date=2011 |website=gssc.esa.int/navipedia |publisher=European Space Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt; GPS also transmits the offset between UTC time and GPS time, and must update this offset every time there is a [[leap second]], requiring GPS receiving devices to handle the update correctly. In contrast, leap seconds are transparent to GLONASS users.
The complexities of calculating UTC from an epoch are explained by the [[European Space Agency]] in Galileo documentation under "Equations to correct system timescale to reference timescale"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unoosa.org/pdf/icg/2016/gst2016.pdf |title=GNSS Timescale Description Galileo |publisher=United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs |date=2016 |at=Section 5d}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25193">'''Fault detection, isolation, and recovery''' ('''FDIR''') is a subfield of [[control engineering]] which concerns itself with monitoring a system, identifying when a [[Fault (technology)|fault]] has occurred, and pinpointing the type of fault and its location.  Two approaches can be distinguished: A direct pattern recognition of sensor readings that indicate a fault and an analysis of the discrepancy between the sensor readings and expected values, derived from some model.  In the latter case, it is typical that a fault is said to be detected if the discrepancy or ''residual'' goes above a certain threshold.  It is then the task of fault isolation to categorize the type of fault and its location in the machinery.  '''Fault detection and isolation''' ('''FDI''') techniques can be broadly classified into two categories.  These include model-based FDI and signal processing based FDI.

== Model-based  ==

[[File:Fault Detection Aircraft.png|thumb|400px|right|Example of model-based FDI logic for an actuator in an aircraft elevator control system&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mathworks.com/mason/tag/proxy.html?dataid=6801 Jason R. Ghidella and Pieter J. Mosterman, "Requirements-Based Testing in Aircraft Control Design," Paper ID AIAA 2005-5886 in AIAA Modeling and Simulations Technologies Conference and Exhibit 2005, August 15-18, San Francisco, California, 2005.]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In model-based FDI techniques some model of the system is used to decide about the occurrence of fault. The system model may be [[mathematical model|mathematical]] or knowledge based. Some of the model-based FDI techniques include&lt;ref&gt;Ding, S.X., Model-based fault diagnosis techniques, Springer 2008&lt;/ref&gt; observer-based approach, parity-space approach, and parameter identification based methods. There is another trend of model-based FDI schemes, which is called set-membership methods. These methods guarantee the detection of fault under certain conditions. The main difference is that instead of finding the most likely model, these techniques omit the models, which are not compatible with data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S240589631502443X | doi=10.1016/j.ifacol.2015.11.185 | volume=48 | issue=27 | title=Model Invalidation for Switched Affine Systems with Applications to Fault and Anomaly Detection**This work is supported in part by DARPA grant N66001-14-1-4045. | year=2015 | journal=IFAC-PapersOnLine | pages=260–266 | last1 = Harirchi | first1 = Farshad | last2 = Ozay | first2 = Necmiye}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.05921 Farshad Harirchi and Necmiye Ozay, "Guaranteed Model-Based Fault Detection in Cyber-Physical Systems: A Model Invalidation Approach" , arXiv]&lt;/ref&gt;

The example shown in the figure on the right illustrates a model-based FDI technique for an aircraft elevator reactive controller through the use of a truth table and a state chart.  The truth table defines how the controller reacts to detected faults, and the state chart defines how the controller switches between the different modes of operation (passive, active, standby, off, and isolated) of each actuator.  For example, if a fault is detected in hydraulic system 1, then the truth table sends an event to the state chart that the left inner actuator should be turned off.  One of the benefits of this model-based FDI technique is that this reactive controller can also be connected to a continuous-time model of the actuator hydraulics, allowing the study of switching transients.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mathworks.com/mason/tag/proxy.html?dataid=5505 Pieter J.

== Signal processing based FDI  ==
In signal processing based FDI, some mathematical or statistical operations are performed on the measurements, or some neural network is trained using measurements to extract the information about the fault.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | title=Shannon wavelet spectrum analysis on truncated vibration signals for machine incipient fault detection| journal=Measurement Science and Technology| year=2012 | last=Liu | volume=23 | issue=5 | pages=1–11 | first1=Jie | doi=10.1088/0957-0233/23/5/055604}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ahmadimanesh, Alireza, and S.

A good example of signal processing based FDI is [[time domain reflectometry]] where a signal is sent down a cable or electrical line and the reflected signal is compared mathematically to original signal to identify faults.  Spread Spectrum Time Domain Reflectometry, for instance, involves sending down a spread spectrum signal down a wire line to detect wire faults.&lt;ref&gt;Furse,Cynthia; Smith, Paul; Lo, Chet.

==Machine fault diagnosis==

Machine fault diagnosis is a field of [[mechanical engineering]] concerned with finding faults arising in machines. A particularly well developed part of it applies specifically to rotating machinery, one of the most common types encountered. To identify the most probable faults leading to failure, many methods are used for data collection, including [[vibration]] monitoring, [[thermal imaging]], oil particle analysis, etc. Then these data are processed utilizing methods like [[frequency spectrum#Spectrum analysis|spectral analysis]], [[wavelet analysis]], wavelet transform, short term Fourier transform, Gabor Expansion, Wigner-Ville distribution (WVD), cepstrum, bispectrum, correlation method, high resolution spectral analysis, waveform analysis (in the time domain, because spectral analysis usually concerns only frequency distribution and not phase information) and others. The results of this analysis are used in a root cause failure analysis in order to determine the original cause of the fault. For example, if a bearing fault is diagnosed, then it is likely that the bearing was not itself damaged at installation, but rather as the consequence of another installation error (e.g., misalignment) which then led to bearing damage. Diagnosing the bearing's damaged state is not enough for precision maintenance purposes. The root cause needs to be identified and remedied. If this is not done, the replacement bearing will soon wear out for the same reason and the machine will suffer more damage, remaining dangerous. Of course, the cause may also be visible as a result of the spectral analysis undertaken at the data-collection stage, but this may not always be the case.

The most common technique for detecting faults is the time-frequency analysis technique. For a rotating machine, the rotational speed of the machine (often known as the [[revolutions per minute|RPM]]), is not a constant, especially not during the start-up and shutdown stages of the machine. Even if the machine is running in the steady state, the rotational speed will vary around a steady-state mean value, and this variation depends on load and other factors. Since sound and vibration signals obtained from a rotating machine which are strongly related to its rotational speed, it can be said that they are time-variant signals in nature. These time-variant features carry the machine fault signatures. Consequently, how these features are extracted and interpreted is important to research and industrial applications.

The most common method used in signal analysis is the [[FFT]], or Fourier transform. The Fourier transform and its inverse counterpart offer two perspectives to study a signal: via the time domain or via the frequency domain. The [[FFT]]-based spectrum of a time signal shows us the existence of its frequency contents. By studying these and their magnitude or phase relations, we can obtain various types of information, such as [[harmonics]], [[sidebands]], [[beating frequency|beat frequency]], bearing fault frequency and so on. However, the [[FFT]] is only suitable for signals whose frequency contents do not change over time; however, as mentioned above, the frequency contents of the sound and vibration signals obtained from a rotating machine are very much time-dependent. For this reason, [[FFT]]-based spectra are unable to detect how the frequency contents develop over time. To be more specific, if the [[revolutions per minute|RPM]] of a machine is increasing or decreasing during its startup or shutdown period, its bandwidth in the FFT spectrum will become much wider than it would be simply for the steady state. Hence, in such a case, the harmonics are not so distinguishable in the spectrum.

The time frequency approach for machine fault diagnosis can be divided into two broad categories: linear methods and the quadratic methods. The difference is that linear transforms can be inverted to construct the time signal, thus, they are more suitable for signal processing, such as noise reduction and time-varying filtering. Although the quadratic method describes the energy distribution of a signal in the joint time frequency domain, which is useful for analysis, classification, and detection of signal features, phase information is lost in the quadratic time-frequency representation; also, the time histories cannot be reconstructed with this method.

The short-term Fourier transform ([[STFT]]) and the [[Gabor transform]] are two algorithms commonly used as linear time-frequency methods. If we consider linear time-frequency analysis to be the evolution of the conventional [[FFT]], then quadratic time frequency analysis would be the power spectrum counterpart. Quadratic algorithms include the Gabor spectrogram, Cohen's class and the adaptive spectrogram. The main advantage of time frequency analysis is discovering the patterns of frequency changes, which usually represent the nature of the signal. As long as this pattern is identified the machine fault associated with this pattern can be identified. Another important use of time frequency analysis is the ability to filter out a particular frequency component using a time-varying filter.

==Robust fault diagnosis==
In practice, model uncertainties and measurement noise can complicate fault detection and isolation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7040291/  "Robust residual selection for fault detection", 2014.]&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, using fault diagnostics to meet industrial needs in a cost-effective way, and to reduce maintenance costs without requiring more investments than the cost of what is to be avoided in the first place, requires an effective scheme of applying them. This is the subject of [[maintenance, repair and operations]]; the different strategies include:
*[[Condition-based maintenance]]
*[[Planned maintenance|Planned preventive maintenance]]
*[[Preventive maintenance]]
*[[Corrective maintenance]] (does not use diagnostics)
*[[Integrated vehicle health management]]

==Fault detection and diagnosis using artificial intelligence==

===Machine learning techniques for fault detection and diagnosis===
{{See also|Machine learning}}
In fault detection and diagnosis, [[Statistical classification|mathematical classification models]] which in fact belong to [[supervised learning]] methods, are trained on the [[training set]] of a labeled [[dataset]] to accurately identify the redundancies, faults and anomalous samples. During the past decades, there are different [[Statistical classification|classification]] and [[Data pre-processing|preprocessing]] models that have been developed and proposed in this research area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chen |first1=Kunjin |last2=Huang |first2=Caowei |last3=He |first3=Jinliang |title=Fault detection, classification and location for transmission lines and distribution systems: a review on the methods |journal=High Voltage |date=1 April 2016 |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=25–33 |doi=10.1049/hve.2016.0005}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[k-nearest neighbors algorithm|''K''-nearest-neighbors algorithm]] (''k''NN) is one of the oldest techniques which has been used to solve fault detection and diagnosis problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Verdier |first1=Ghislain |last2=Ferreira |first2=Ariane |title=Adaptive Mahalanobis Distance and $k$-Nearest Neighbor Rule for Fault Detection in Semiconductor Manufacturing |journal=IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing |date=February 2011 |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=59–68 |doi=10.1109/TSM.2010.2065531}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the simple logic that this instance-based algorithm has, there are some problems with large [[dimensionality]] and processing time when it is used on large [[dataset]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tian |first1=Jing |last2=Morillo |first2=Carlos |last3=Azarian |first3=Michael H. |last4=Pecht |first4=Michael |title=Motor Bearing Fault Detection Using Spectral Kurtosis-Based Feature Extraction Coupled With K-Nearest Neighbor Distance Analysis |journal=IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics |date=March 2016 |volume=63 |issue=3 |pages=1793–1803 |doi=10.1109/TIE.2015.2509913}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since [[k-nearest neighbors algorithm|''k''NN]] is not able to automatically extract the features to overcome the [[curse of dimensionality]], so often some [[Data pre-processing|data preprocessing]] techniques like [[Principal component analysis]](PCA), [[Linear discriminant analysis]](LDA) or [[Canonical correlation|Canonical correlation analysis]](CCA) accompany it to reach a better performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Safizadeh |first1=M.S. |last2=Latifi |first2=S.K. |title=Using multi-sensor data fusion for vibration fault diagnosis of rolling element bearings by accelerometer and load cell |journal=Information Fusion |date=July 2014 |volume=18 |pages=1–8 |doi=10.1016/j.inffus.2013.10.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many industrial cases, the effectiveness of [[k-nearest neighbors algorithm|''k''NN]] has been compared with other methods, specially with more complex classification models such as [[Support Vector Machine]]s (SVMs), which is widely used in this field. Thanks to their appropriate nonlinear mapping using [[kernel methods]], SVMs have an impressive performance in generalization, even with small training data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Liu |first1=Jie |last2=Zio |first2=Enrico |title=Feature vector regression with efficient hyperparameters tuning and geometric interpretation |journal=Neurocomputing |date=December 2016 |volume=218 |pages=411–422 |doi=10.1016/j.neucom.2016.08.093}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, general SVMs do not have automatic feature extraction themselves and just like [[k-nearest neighbors algorithm|''k''NN]], are often coupled with a [[data pre-processing]] technique.&lt;ref name="ruonan"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Liu |first1=Ruonan |last2=Yang |first2=Boyuan |last3=Zio |first3=Enrico |last4=Chen |first4=Xuefeng |title=Artificial intelligence for fault diagnosis of rotating machinery: A review |journal=Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing |date=August 2018 |volume=108 |pages=33–47 |doi=10.1016/j.ymssp.2018.02.016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another drawback of SVMs is that their performance is highly sensitive to the initial parameters, particularly to the [[kernel method]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Genton |first1=Marc G. |title=Classes of Kernels for Machine Learning: A Statistics Perspective |journal=Journal of Machine Learning Research |date=2001 |volume=2 |pages=299–312 |doi=10.1162/15324430260185646}}&lt;/ref&gt;, so in each signal [[dataset]], a parameter tuning process is required to be conducted first. Therefore, the low speed of the training phase is a limitation of SVMs when it comes to its usage in fault detection and diagnosis cases.&lt;ref name="kot"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kotsiantis |first1=S.B. |last2=Zaharakis |first2=I.D. |last3=Pintelas |first3=P.E. |title=Machine learning: a review of classification and combining techniques |journal=Artificial Intelligence Review |date=2006 |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=159–190 |doi=10.1007/s10462-007-9052-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Time domain waveform and CWTS of a normal signal comparison.png|thumb|Time domain waveform(top) and CWTS(bottom) of a normal signal]]
[[Artificial Neural Networks]](ANNs) are among the most mature and widely used [[Statistical classification|mathematical classification algorithms]] in fault detection and diagnosis. ANNs are well-known for their efficient self-learning capabilities of the complex relations (which generally exist inherently in fault detection and diagnosis problems) and are easy to operate.&lt;ref name="ruonan"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Another advantage of ANNs is that they perform automatic feature extraction by allocating negligible weights to the irrelevant features, helping the system to avoid dealing with another feature extractor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Vercellis |first1=Carlo |title=Business intelligence : data mining and optimization for decision making |date=2008 |publisher=Wiley |location=Hoboken, N.J. |isbn=978-0-470-51138-1 |pages=436 |edition=[Online-Ausg.].}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, ANNs tend to [[overfitting|over-fit]] the training set, which will have consequences of having poor validation accuracy on the validation set. Hence, often, some regularization terms and prior knowledge are added to the ANN model to avoid [[overfitting|over-fiting]] and achieve higher performance. Moreover, properly determining the size of the hidden layer needs an exhaustive parameter tuning, to avoid poor approximation and generalization capabilities.&lt;ref name="kot"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
In general, different SVMs and ANNs models (i.e. [[Backpropagation|Back-Propagation Neural Networks]] and [[Multilayer perceptron|Multi-Layer Perceptron]]) have shown successful performances in the fault detection and diagnosis in industries such as [[gearbox]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Saravanan |first1=N. |last2=Siddabattuni |first2=V.N.S.

===Deep learning techniques for fault detection and diagnosis===
[[File:Typical cnn.png|thumb|Typical architecture of a Convolutional Neural Networks]]
{{See also|Deep learning}}
With the research advances in ANNs and the advent of [[deep learning]] algorithms using deep and complex layers, novel [[Statistical classification|classification models]] have been developed to cope with fault detection and diagnosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lv |first1=Feiya |last2=Wen |first2=Chenglin |last3=Bao |first3=Zejing |last4=Liu |first4=Meiqin |title=Fault diagnosis based on deep learning |journal=2016 American Control Conference (ACC) |date=July 2016 |pages=6851–6856 |doi=10.1109/ACC.2016.7526751|isbn=978-1-4673-8682-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Most of the [[machine learning|shallow learning]] models extract a few feature values from signals, causing a [[dimensionality]] reduction from the original [[signal]]. By using [[Convolutional neural network]]s, the [[continuous wavelet transform]] [[scalogram]] can be directly classified to normal and faulty classes. Such a technique avoids omitting any important fault message and results in a better performance of fault detection and diagnosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Guo |first1=Sheng |last2=Yang |first2=Tao |last3=Gao |first3=Wei |last4=Zhang |first4=Chen |title=A Novel Fault Diagnosis Method for Rotating Machinery Based on a Convolutional Neural Network |journal=Sensors |date=4 May 2018 |volume=18 |issue=5 |pages=1429 |doi=10.3390/s18051429|pmid=29734704 |pmc=5982639 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition, by transforming signals to image constructions, 2D [[Convolutional neural network]]s can be implemented to identify faulty signals from vibration image features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hoang |first1=Duy-Tang |last2=Kang |first2=Hee-Jun |title=Rolling element bearing fault diagnosis using convolutional neural network and vibration image |journal=Cognitive Systems Research |date=March 2018 |doi=10.1016/j.cogsys.2018.03.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In comparison to [[machine learning|traditional machine learning]], due to their deep architecture, [[deep learning]] models are able to learn more complex structures from [[dataset]]s, however, they need larger samples and longer processing time to achieve higher accuracy.&lt;ref name="ruonan"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;div style="margin:0 0 18px 12px"&gt;[[Image:Gardners.jpg|thumb|Gardner's, ''Art Through The Ages'']]&lt;/div&gt;
'''''Gardner's Art Through the Ages''''' is an American textbook on the [[history of art]], with the 2004 edition by Fred S. Kleiner and Christin J. Mamiya. The 2001 edition was awarded both a [[William Holmes McGuffey#McGuffey awards|McGuffey award]] for longevity{{ref|Lit_Prize1}} and the [[Textbook Excellence Award ("Texty")|"Texty" Award]] for current editions{{ref|Lit_Prize2}} by the Text and Academic Authors Association. No other book has received both awards in the same year.

The first edition published in 1926 was written by [[Helen Gardner (art historian)|Helen Gardner]].  It, like all following editions, was organized chronologically beginning with "The Birth of Art" in the Upper [[Paleolithic]] and progressing in a mainly chronological sequence to the contemporary period.

Gardner's initial edition  was ahead of its time in that along with the [[Western canon]] of [[European art]], it examined the art of other cultures.  This broader view has influenced artists like [[Roy Lichtenstein]] as a student{{ref|Inf_Licht}} with its coverage not only of China, Japan, and Africa, but The Americas and the South Pacific as well.  It continues to be a required text for introductory classes in [[art history]] for American students to this day.{{ref|Wittenburg}}{{ref|Kader}}

==Formats==
The book is now published in a number of different formats, with a "concise" version, and the Western and non-Western sections available separately. There are also "enhanced" editions with additional [[multimedia]] material, and versions in one to four volumes. According to the US publisher, [[Cengage]], the following were available in 2010:

==Criticism==
The GKA has been accused of being biased against Konkani publications in the [[Konkani in the Roman script|Roman script]] in the past. Another demand has been that the GKA should be headed by persons of both the major communities in Goa([[Hindus]] and [[Christians]]) by rotation.&lt;ref name="Konkaniworld"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.konkaniworld.com/news/indexMore.asp?ID=892&amp;title=Script+for+Konkani |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713165258/http://www.konkaniworld.com/news/indexMore.asp?ID=892&amp;title=Script+for+Konkani |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-07-13 |title=Konkaniworld - Script for Konkani |last=Lopes |first=Nelson |accessdate=2009-06-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fredrick Noronha]] has criticized the way the GKA distributes books. He blames the "low-price, no-distributor-margins policy" as being responsible for the lack of interest by distributors, and hence low readership of its books.&lt;ref name="Fredrick_Noronha"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fredericknoronha.wordpress.com/2007/10/22/learn-konkani-the-romi-way/|title=Learn Konkani, the Romi way|last=Noronha|first=Frederick|accessdate=2009-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This article considers the '''history of [[zoology]]''' since the theory of [[evolution]] by [[natural selection]] proposed by [[Charles Darwin]] in 1859.

[[Charles Darwin]] gave new direction to [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]] and [[physiology]], by uniting them in a common biological theory: the theory of organic evolution. The result was a reconstruction of the classification of animals upon a [[genealogical]] basis, fresh investigation of the development of animals, and early attempts to determine their genetic relationships. The end of the 19th century saw the fall of [[spontaneous generation]] and the rise of the [[germ theory of disease]], though the mechanism of [[biological inheritance|inheritance]] remained a mystery. In the early 20th century, the rediscovery of [[Gregor Mendel|Mendel's]] work led to the rapid development of [[genetics]] by [[Thomas Hunt Morgan]] and his students, and by the 1930s the combination of [[population genetics]] and natural selection in the "[[Neo-Darwinism|neo-Darwinian synthesis]]".

==Second half of nineteenth century==

===Darwin and the theory of evolution===
The 1859 publication of Darwin's theory in ''[[On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life]]'' is often considered the central event in the history of modern zoology. Darwin's established credibility as a naturalist, the sober tone of the work, and most of all the sheer strength and volume of evidence presented, allowed ''Origin'' to succeed where previous evolutionary works such as the anonymous ''[[Vestiges of Creation]]'' had failed. Most scientists were convinced of evolution and [[common descent]] by the end of the 19th century. However, natural selection would not be accepted as the primary mechanism of evolution until well into the 20th century, as most contemporary theories of heredity seemed incompatible with the inheritance of random variation.&lt;ref&gt;Larson, ''Evolution'', chapter 5: "Ascent of Evolutionism"; see also: [[Peter J. Bowler]], ''The Eclipse of Darwinism''; Secord, ''Victorian Sensation''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alfred Russel Wallace]], following on earlier work by [[A.P. de Candolle|de Candolle]], [[Alexander von Humboldt|Humboldt]] and Darwin, made major contributions to [[zoogeography]]. Because of his interest in the transmutation hypothesis, he paid particular attention to the geographical distribution of closely allied species during his field work first in [[South America]] and then in the [[Malay archipelago]]. While in the archipelago he identified the [[Wallace line]], which runs through the [[Maluku Islands|Spice Islands]] dividing the fauna of the archipelago between an Asian zone and a [[New Guinea]]/Australian zone. His key question, as to why the fauna of islands with such similar climates should be so different, could only be answered by considering their origin. In 1876 he wrote ''The Geographical Distribution of Animals'', which was the standard reference work for over half a century, and a sequel, ''Island Life'', in 1880 that focused on island biogeography. He extended the six-zone system developed by [[Philip Sclater]] for describing the geographical distribution of birds to animals of all kinds. His method of tabulating data on animal groups in geographic zones highlighted the discontinuities; and his appreciation of evolution allowed him to propose rational explanations, which had not been done before.&lt;ref&gt;Larson, ''Evolution'', pp 72-73, 116–117; see also: Browne, ''The Secular Ark''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bowler ''Evolution: The History of an Idea'' p. 174&lt;/ref&gt;

The scientific study of [[heredity]] grew rapidly in the wake of Darwin's ''Origin of Species'' with the work of [[Francis Galton]] and the [[biometry|biometricians]]. The origin of [[genetics]] is usually traced to the 1866 work of the [[monk]] [[Gregor Mendel]], who would later be credited with the [[laws of inheritance]]. However, his work was not recognized as significant until 35 years afterward. In the meantime, a variety of theories of inheritance (based on [[pangenesis]], [[orthogenesis]], or other mechanisms) were debated and investigated vigorously.&lt;ref&gt;Mayr, ''The Growth of Biological Thought'', pp 693–710&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1859, [[Charles Darwin]] placed the whole theory of organic evolution on a new footing, by his discovery of a process by which organic evolution can occur, and provided observational evidence that it had done so. This changed the attitudes of most exponents of the scientific method. Darwin's discoveries revolutionised the zoological and botanical sciences, by introducing the [[theory]] of [[evolution]] by [[natural selection]] as an explanation for the diversity of all animal and plant life. The subject-matter of this new science, or branch of biological science, had been neglected: it did not form part of the studies of the collector and systematist, nor was it a branch of anatomy, nor of the physiology pursued by medical men, nor again was it included in the field of microscopy and the cell theory.{{Sfn|Lankester|1911|p=1023}} Almost a thousand years before Darwin, the Arab scholar [[Al-Jahiz]] (781 – 868) had already developed a rudimentary theory of natural selection &lt;!-- Comment &lt;ref name="Conway Zirkle 1941 p. 71-123"/&gt;--&gt;, describing the [[natural selection|Struggle for existence]] in his ''Book of Animals'' where he speculates on how environmental factors can affect the characteristics of species by forcing them to adapt and then passing on those new traits to future generations. However, his work had largely been forgotten, along with many other early advances of Arab scientists, and there is no evidence that his works were known to Darwin.

The area of biological knowledge which Darwin was the first to subject to scientific method and to render, as it were, contributory to the great stream formed by the union of the various branches, is that which relates to the breeding of animals and plants, their congenital variations, and the transmission and perpetuation of those variations. This branch of biological science may be called [[thremmatology]] - the science of [[Reproduction|breeding]].{{Sfn|Lankester|1911|p=1023–1024}} Outside the scientific world, an immense mass of observation and experiment had grown up in relation to this subject. From the earliest times the [[Animal husbandry|shepherd]], the [[farmer]], the [[horticulturist]], and the [[fancier]] had for practical purposes made themselves acquainted with a number of biological laws, and successfully applied them without exciting more than an occasional notice from the academic students of biology. Darwin made use of these observations and formulated their results to a large extent as the laws of [[Genetic diversity|variation]] and [[heredity]]. As the breeder selects a congenital variation which suits his requirements, and by breeding from the animals (or plants) exhibiting that variation obtains a new breed specially characterised by that variation, so in nature is there a selection amongst all the congenital variations of each generation of a species. This selection depends on the fact that more young are born than the natural provision of food will support. In consequence of this excess of births there is a struggle for existence and a [[survival of the fittest]], and consequently an ever-present necessarily acting selection, which either maintains accurately the form of the species from generation to generation or leads to its modification in correspondence with changes in the surrounding circumstances which have relation to its fitness for success in the struggle for life, structures to the service of the organisms in which they occur.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911 |wstitle=Zoology |volume=28 |pages=1022–1039 |first=Edwin Ray |last=Lankester |inline=1}}{{Better source needed|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It cannot be said that previously to Darwin there had been any very profound study of teleology, but it had been the delight of a certain type of mind, that of the lovers of nature or naturalists par excellence as they were sometimes termed, to watch the habits of living animals and plants and to point out the remarkable ways in which the structure of each variety of organic life was adapted to the special circumstances of life of the variety or species. The astonishing colours and grotesque forms of some animals and plants which the museum zoologists gravely described without comment were shown by these observers of living nature to have their significance in the economy of the organism possessing them; and a general doctrine was recognized, to the effect that no part or structure of an organism is without definite use and adaptation, being designed by the Creator for the benefit of the creature to which it belongs, or else for the benefit, amusement or instruction of his highest creatureman. Teleology in this form of the doctrine of design was never very deeply rooted amongst scientific anatomists and systematists. It was considered permissible to speculate somewhat vaguely on the subject of the utility of this or that startling variety of structure; but few attempts, though some of great importance, were made systematically to explain by observation and experiment the adaptation of organic structures to particular purposes in the case of the lower animals and plants. Teleology had, indeed, an important part in the development of physiology - the knowledge of the mechanism, the physical and chemical properties, of the parts of the body of man and the higher animals allied to him. But, as applied to lower and more obscure forms of life, teleology presented almost insurmountable difficulties; and consequently, in place of exact experiment and demonstration, the most reckless though ingenious assumptions were made as to the utility of the parts and organs of lower animals.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

Darwin's theory had as one of its results the reformation and rehabilitation of teleology. According to that theory, every organ, every part, colour and peculiarity of an organism, must either be of benefit to that organism itself or have been so to its ancestors: no peculiarity of structure or general conformation, no habit or instinct in any organism, can be supposed to exist for the benefit or amusement of another organism, not even for the delectation of man himself.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

A very subtle and important qualification of this generalization has to be recognized (and was recognized by Darwin) in the fact that owing to the interdependence of the parts of the bodies of living things and their profound chemical interactions and peculiar structural balance (what is called organic polarity) the variation of one single part (a spot of colour, a tooth, a claw, a leaflet) may, and demonstrably does in many cases entail variation of other parts what are called correlated variations. Hence many structures which are obvious to the eye, and serve as distinguishing marks of separate species, are really not themselves of value or use, but are the necessary concomitants of less obvious and even altogether obscure qualities, which are the real characters upon which selection is acting. Such correlated variations may attain to great size and complexity without being of use. But eventually they may in turn become, in changed conditions, of selective value. Thus in many cases the difficulty of supposing that selection has acted on minute and imperceptible initial variations, so small as to have no selective value, may be got rid of. A useless correlated variation  may have attained great volume and quality before it is (as it were) seized upon and perfected by natural selection. All organisms are essentially and necessarily built up by such correlated variations.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

Necessarily, according to the theory of natural selection, structures either are present because they are selected as useful or because they are still inherited from ancestors to whom they were useful, though no longer useful to the existing representatives of those ancestors. Structures previously inexplicable were now explained as survivals from a past age, no longer useful though once of value. Every variety of form and colour was urgently and absolutely called upon to produce its title to existence either as an active useful agent or as a survival. Darwin himself spent a large part of the later years of his life in thus extending the new teleology.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

The old doctrine of types, which was used by the philosophically minded zoologists (and botanists) of the first half of the 19th century as a ready means of explaining the failures and difficulties of the doctrine of design, fell into its proper place under the new dispensation. The adherence to type, the favourite conception. of the transcendental morphologist, was seen to be nothing more than the expression of one of the laws of thremmatology, the persistence of hereditary transmission of ancestral characters, even when they have ceased to be significant or valuable in the struggle for existence, whilst the so-called evidences of design which was supposed to modify the limitations of types assigned to Himself by the Creator were seen to be adaptations due to the selection and intensification by selective breeding of fortuitous congenital variations, which happened to prove more useful than the many thousand other variations which did not survive in the struggle for existence.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

Thus not only did Darwins theory give a new basis to the study of organic structure, but, whilst rendering the general theory of organic evolution equally acceptable and necessary, it explained the existence of low and simple forms of life as survivals of the earliest ancestry of the more highly complex forms, and revealed the classifications of the systematist as unconscious attempts to construct the genealogical tree or pedigree of plants and animals. Finally, it brought the simplest living matter or formless protoplasm before the mental vision as the starting point whence, by the operation of necessary mechanical causes, the highest forms have been evolved, and it rendered unavoidable the conclusion that this earliest living material was itself evolved by gradual processes, the result also of the known and recognized laws of physics and chemistry, from material which we should call not living. It abolished the conception of life as an entity above and beyond the common properties of matter, and led to the conviction that the marvellous and exceptional qualities of that which we call living matter are nothing more nor less than an exceptionally complicated development of those chemical and physical properties which we recognize in a gradually ascending scale of evolution in the carbon compounds, containing nitrogen as well as oxygen, sulphur and hydrogen as constituent atoms of their enormous molecules. Thus mysticism was finally banished from the domain of biology, and zoology became one of the physical sciencesthe science which seeks to arrange and discuss the phenomena of animal life and form, as the outcome of the operation of the laws of physics and chemistry.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

A subdivision of zoology which was at one time in favour is simply into morphology and physiology, the study of form and structure on the one hand, and the study of the activities and functions of the forms and structures of the other. But a logical division like this is not necessarily conducive to the ascertainment and remembrance of the historical progress and present significance of the science. No such distinction of mental activities as that involved in the division of the study of animal life into morphology and physiology has ever really existed: the investigator of animal forms has never entirely ignored the functions of the forms studied by him, and the experimental inquirer into the functions and properties of animal tissues and organs has always taken very careful account of the forms of those tissues and organs. A more instructive subdivision must be one which corresponds to the separate currents of thought and mental preoccupation which have been historically manifested in western Europe in the gradual evolution of what is to-day the great river of zoological doctrine to which they have all been rendered contributory.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

===Cell theory, embryology and germ theory===
[[File:Albert Edelfelt - Louis Pasteur - 1885.jpg|thumb|upright|Innovative experimental methods such as [[Louis Pasteur]]'s contributed to the young field of [[bacteriology]] in the late 19th century.]]
[[Cell theory]] led zoologists to re-envision individual organisms as interdependent assemblages of individual cells. Scientists in the rising field of [[cell biology|cytology]], armed with increasingly powerful microscopes and new [[staining]] methods, soon found that even single cells were far more complex than the homogeneous fluid-filled chambers described by earlier microscopists. Much of the research on cell reproduction came together in [[August Weismann]]'s theory of heredity: he identified the nucleus (in particular chromosomes) as the hereditary material, proposed the distinction between [[somatic cell]]s and [[germ cell]]s (arguing that chromosome number must be halved for germ cells, a precursor to the concept of [[meiosis]]), and adopted [[Hugo de Vries]]'s theory of [[pangene]]s. Weismannism was extremely influential, especially in the new field of experimental [[embryology]].&lt;ref&gt;Sapp, ''Genesis'', chapter 8; Coleman, ''Biology in the Nineteenth Century'', chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1880s, [[bacteriology]] was becoming a coherent discipline, especially through the work of [[Robert Koch]], who introduced methods for growing pure cultures on [[Agar plate|agar gels]] containing specific nutrients in [[Petri dish]]es. The long-held idea that living organisms could easily originate from nonliving matter ([[spontaneous generation]]) was attacked in a series of experiments carried out by [[Louis Pasteur]], while debates over [[vitalism]] vs. [[mechanism (philosophy)|mechanism]] (a perennial issue since the time of Aristotle and the Greek atomists) continued apace.&lt;ref&gt;Magner, ''A History of the Life Sciences'', pp 254–276&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physiology===
Over the course of the 19th century, the scope of physiology expanded greatly, from a primarily medically oriented field to a wide-ranging investigation of the physical and chemical processes of life—including plants, animals, and even microorganisms in addition to man. ''Living things as machines'' became a dominant metaphor in biological (and social) thinking.&lt;ref&gt;Coleman, ''Biology in the Nineteenth Century'', chapter 6; on the machine metaphor, see also: Rabinbach, ''The Human Motor''&lt;/ref&gt; Physiologists such as [[Claude Bernard]] explored (through vivisection and other experimental methods) the chemical and physical functions of living bodies to an unprecedented degree, laying the groundwork for [[endocrinology]] (a field that developed quickly after the discovery of the first [[hormone]], [[secretin]], in 1902), [[biomechanics]], and the study of [[nutrition]] and [[digestion]]. The importance and diversity of experimental physiology methods, within both medicine and zoology, grew dramatically over the second half of the 19th century. The control and manipulation of life processes became a central concern, and experiment was placed at the center of biological education.&lt;ref&gt;Rothman and Rothman, ''The Pursuit of Perfection'', chapter 1; Coleman, ''Biology in the Nineteenth Century'', chapter 7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Twentieth century==
At the beginning of the 20th century, zoological research was largely a professional endeavour. Most work was still done in the [[natural history]] mode, which emphasized morphological and phylogenetic analysis over experiment-based causal explanations. However, anti-[[vitalism|vitalist]] experimental physiologists and embryologists, especially in Europe, were increasingly influential. The tremendous success of experimental approaches to development, heredity, and metabolism in the 1900s and 1910s demonstrated the power of experimentation in biology. In the following decades, experimental work replaced natural history as the dominant mode of research.&lt;ref&gt;See: Coleman, ''Biology in the Nineteenth Century''; Kohler, ''Landscapes and Labscapes''; Allen, ''Life Science in the Twentieth Century''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early 20th century work (variation and heredity)===
After publication of his work ''[[The Origin of Species]]'', Darwin became interested in the animal and plant mechanisms that confer advantages to individual members of a species.  Much important work was done by [[Fritz Muller]] (''Für Darwin''), by [[Hermann Müller (botanist)|Hermann Müller]] (''Fertilization of Plants by Insects''), [[August Weismann]], Edward B. Poulton and [[Abbott Thayer]]. There was considerable progress during this period in the field that would become known as [[genetics]], the laws of variation and [[heredity]] (originally known as ''thremmatology''{{Sfn|Lankester |1911|p=1036}}).  The progress of microscopy gave a clearer understanding of the origin of the [[Ovum|egg]]-cell and [[sperm]]-cell and the process of [[fertilization]].

====Mendel and zoology====
Mendel's experiments on cultivated varieties of plants were published in 1865, but attracted little notice until thirty-five years later, sixteen years after his death (see [[Mendelism]]). Mendel tried to gain a better understanding of [[heredity]]. His main experiments were with varieties of the edible [[pea]]. He chose a variety with one marked structural feature and crossed it with another variety in which that feature was absent. For example, he hybridized a tall variety, with a dwarf variety, a yellow-seeded variety with a green-seeded variety, and a smooth-seeded variety with a wrinkle-seeded variety. In each experiment, he concentrated on one character; after obtaining a first hybrid generation, he allowed the hybrids to self-fertilize, and recorded the number of individuals in the first, second, third, and fourth generations in which the chosen character appeared.

In the first hybrid generation, nearly all the individuals had the positive character, but in subsequent generations the positive character was not present in all individuals: half had the character and half did not. Thus the random pairing of two groups of reproductive cells yielded the proportion 1 PP, 2 PN, 1 NN, where P stands for the character and N for its absence - the character was present in three-quarters of the offspring and absent from a quarter. The failure of the character to distribute itself among all of the reproductive cells of a hybrid individual, and the limitation of its distribution to half only of those cells, prevents the swamping of a new character by interbreeding. The tendency of the proportions in the offspring is to give, in a series of generations, a reversion from the hybrid form PN to a race with the positive character and a race without it. This tendency favours the persistence of a new character of large volume suddenly appearing in a stock. The observations of Mendel thus favoured the view that the variations upon which natural selection acts are not small but large and discontinuous. However, it did not appear that large variations would be favoured any more than small ones, or that the eliminating action of natural selection upon an unfavourable variation could be checked.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

Much confusion arose in discussions of this topic, because of defective nomenclature. Some authors used the word ''mutation'' only for large variations that appeared suddenly and that could be inherited, and ''fluctuation'' for small variations, whether they could be transmitted or not. Other authors used ''fluctuation'' only for  small, acquired variations due to changes in food, moisture and other features of the environment. This kind of variation is not heritable, but the small variations Darwin thought important are. The best classification of the variations in organisms separates those that arise from congenital variations from those that arise from variations of the environment or the food-supply. The former are innate variations, the latter are "acquired variations". Both innate and acquired variations include some that are more and some that are less obvious. There are slight innate variations in every new generation of every species; their greatness or smallness so far as human perception goes is not of much significance, their importance for the origin of new species depends on whether they are valuable to the organism in the struggle for existence and reproduction. An imperceptible physiological difference might be of selective value, and it might carry with it correlated variations that may or may not appeal to the human eye, but are of no selective value themselves.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

The views of [[Hugo de Vries]] and others about the importance of saltatory variation, the soundness of which was still not generally accepted in 1910, may be gathered from the article [[Mendelism]]. A due appreciation of the far-reaching results of correlated variation must, it appeared, give a new and distinct explanation of large mutations, discontinuous variation, and saltatory evolution.  The analysis of the specific variations of organic form to determine the nature and limitation of a single character, and whether two variations of a structural unit can blend when one is transmitted by the male parent and the other by the female, were yet to be determined. It was not clear whether absolute blending was possible, or whether all apparent blending was only a more-or-less minutely subdivided mosaic of non-combinable characters of the parents.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

Another important development of Darwin's conclusions deserves notice. The fact of variation was familiar: no two animals, even of the same brood, are alike. [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]] hypothesised that structural alterations acquired by a parent might be transmitted to the offspring, and as these are acquired by an animal or plant as a consequence of the action of the environment, the offspring would sometimes start with a greater fitness for those conditions than its parents started with. In turn, it would acquire a greater development of the same modification, which it would  transmit to its offspring. Lamarck argued that, over several generations, a structural alteration might thus be acquired. The familiar illustration of Lamarck's hypothesis is that of the [[giraffe]], whose long neck might, he suggested, was acquired by the efforts of a short-necked race of [[herbivore]]s who stretched their necks to reach the foliage of trees in a land where grass was deficient, the effort producing a longer neck of each generation, which was then transmitted to the next. This process is known as 'direct adaptation'. &lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

Such structural adaptations are acquired by an animal in the course of its life, but are limited in degree and rare, rather than frequent and obvious. Whether acquired characters could be transmitted to the next generation was a very different issue. Darwin excluded any assumption of the transmission of acquired characters. He pointed to the fact of congenital variation, and showed that congenital variations are arbitrary and non-significant.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

====Congenital variation====
At the beginning of the 20th century, the causes of congenital variation were obscure, although it was recognised that they were largely due to a mixing of the matter that constituted the fertilized germ or embryo-cell from two individuals. Darwin had shown that congenital variation was all-important. A popular illustration of the difference was this: a man born with four fingers only on his right hand might transmit this peculiarity to at least some of his children; but a man with one finger chopped off will produce children with five fingers. Darwin, influenced by some facts that seemed to favour the Lamarckian hypothesis, thought that acquired characters are sometimes transmitted, but did not consider that this mechanism was likely to be of great importance.

After Darwin's writings, there was an effort to find evidence for the transmission of acquired characters; ultimately, the Lamarckian hypothesis of transmission of acquired characters was not supported by evidence, and was dismissed. [[August Weismann]] argued from the structure of the egg-cell and sperm-cell, and from how and when they are derived in the growth of the embryo from the egg, that it was impossible that a change in parental structure could produce a representative change in the germ or sperm-cells.

The only evidence that seemed to support the Lamarckian hypothesis were the experiments of [[Charles Brown-Séquard]], who produced [[epilepsy]] in [[guinea-pig]]s by bisection of the large nerves or [[spinal cord]], which led him to believe that, in rare instances, the artificially-produced epilepsy and mutilation of the nerves was transmitted. The record of Brown-Séquard's original experiments was unsatisfactory, and attempts reproduce them were unsuccessful. Conversely, the vast number of experiments in the cropping of the tails and ears of domestic animals, as well as of similar operations on man, had negative results. Stories of tailess kittens, puppies, and calves, born from parents one of whom had been thus injured, are abundant, but failed to stand experimental examination.

Whilst evidence of the transmission of an acquired character proved wanting, the ''a priori'' arguments in its favour were recognized as flawed, and cases that appeared to favour the Lamarckian assumption were found to be better explained by the Darwinian principle. For example, the occurrence of [[blind animals]] in caves and in the deep sea was a fact that even Darwin regarded as best explained by the atrophy of the eye in successive generations through the absence of light and consequent disuse. However, it was suggested that this is better explained by natural selection acting on congenital fortuitous variations. Some animals are born with distorted or defective eyes. If a number of some species of fish are swept into a cavern, those with perfect eyes would follow the light and eventually escape, leaving behind those with imperfect eyes to breed in the dark place. In every succeeding generation this would be the case, and even those with weak but still seeing eyes would escape, until only a pure race of blind animals would be left in the cavern.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

====Transmission====
It was argued that the elaborate structural adaptations of the nervous system that underlie instincts must have been slowly built up by the transmission to offspring of acquired experience. It seemed hard to understand how complicated instincts could be due to the selection of congenital variations, or be explained except by the transmission of habits acquired by the parent. However, imitation of the parent by the young account for some, and there are cases in which elaborate actions must be due to the natural selection of a fortuitously-developed habit. Such cases are the habits of 'shamming dead' and the combined posturing and colour peculiarities of certain caterpillars ([[Lepidoptera]] larvae) that cause them to resemble dead twigs or similar objects. The advantage to the caterpillar is that it escapes (say) a bird that would, were it not deceived, attack and eat it. Preceding generations of caterpillars cannot have acquired this habit of posturing by experience; either a caterpillar postures and escapes, or it does not posture and is eaten - it is not half eaten and allowed to profit by experience. Thus, we seem justified in assuming that there are many movements of stretching and posturing possible to caterpillars, that some had a fortuitous tendency to one position, some to another, and, that among all the variety of habitual movements, one is selected and perpetuated because it happened to make the caterpillar look more like a twig.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

====Record of the past====
Man, compared with other animals, has the fewest instincts and the largest brain in proportion to body size. He builds up, from birth onwards, his own mental mechanisms, and forms more of them, and takes longer in doing so, than any other animal. The later stages of evolution from ape-like ancestors have consisted in the acquisition of a larger brain and in the education of that brain. A new feature in organic development makes its appearance when we set out the facts of man's evolutionary history. This factor is the ''record of the past'', which grows and develops by laws other than those affecting the perishable bodies of successive generations of mankind, so that man, by the interaction of the ''record'' and his educability, is subject to laws of development unlike those by which the rest of the living world is governed.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

===Ecology and environmental science===
{{see also|History of ecology}}
In the early 20th century, naturalists were faced with increasing pressure to add rigor and preferably experimentation to their methods, as the newly prominent laboratory-based biological disciplines had done. Ecology had emerged as a combination of biogeography with the [[biogeochemical cycle]] concept pioneered by chemists; field biologists developed quantitative methods such as the [[quadrat]] and adapted laboratory instruments and cameras for the field to further set their work apart from traditional natural history. Zoologists did what they could to mitigate the unpredictability of the living world, performing laboratory experiments and studying semi-controlled natural environments; new institutions like the [[Carnegie Station for Experimental Evolution]] and the [[Marine Biological Laboratory]] provided more controlled environments for studying organisms through their entire life cycles.&lt;ref&gt;Kohler, ''Landscapes and Labscapes'', chapters 2, 3, 4&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles Sutherland Elton|Charles Elton's]] studies of animal [[food chain]]s was pioneering among the succession of quantitative methods that colonized the developing ecological specialties. Ecology became an independent discipline in the 1940s and 1950s after [[Eugene P. Odum]] synthesized many of the concepts of [[ecosystem ecology]], placing relationships between groups of organisms (especially material and energy relationships) at the center of the field.&lt;ref&gt;Hagen, ''An Entangled Bank'', chapters 2–5&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s, as evolutionary theorists explored the possibility of multiple [[units of selection]], ecologists turned to evolutionary approaches. In [[population ecology]], debate over [[group selection]] was brief but vigorous; by 1970, most zoologists agreed that natural selection was rarely effective above the level of individual organisms.

===Classical genetics, the modern synthesis, and evolutionary theory===

[[Image:Morgan crossover 1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Thomas Hunt Morgan|Thomas Hunt Morgan's]] illustration of [[Chromosomal crossover|crossing over]], part of the Mendelian-chromosome theory of heredity]]
1900 marked the so-called ''rediscovery of Mendel'': [[Hugo de Vries]], [[Carl Correns]], and [[Erich von Tschermak]] independently arrived at [[Mendel's laws]] (which were not actually present in Mendel's work).&lt;ref&gt;Randy Moore, "[http://papa.indstate.edu/amcbt/volume_27/v27-2p13-24.pdf The 'Rediscovery' of Mendel's Work]", ''Bioscene'', Volume 27(2) pp. 13-24, May 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, cytologists (cell biologists) proposed that [[chromosome]]s were the hereditary material. Between 1910 and 1915, [[Thomas Hunt Morgan]] and the "[[Drosophilists]]" in his fly lab forged these two ideas—both controversial—into the "Mendelian-chromosome theory" of heredity.&lt;ref&gt;T. H. Morgan, A. H. Sturtevant, H. J. Muller, C. B. Bridges (1915) [http://www.esp.org/books/morgan/mechanism/facsimile/title3.html ''The Mechanism of Mendelian Heredity''] Henry Holt and Company.&lt;/ref&gt; They quantified the phenomenon of genetic linkage and postulated that genes reside on chromosomes like beads on string; they hypothesized [[Chromosomal crossover|crossing over]] to explain linkage and constructed [[genetic map]]s of the fruit fly ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', which became a widely used [[model organism]].&lt;ref&gt;Garland Allen, ''Thomas Hunt Morgan: The Man and His Science'' (1978), chapter 5; see also: Kohler, ''Lords of the Fly'' and Sturtevant, ''A History of Genetics''&lt;/ref&gt;

Hugo de Vries tried to link the new genetics with evolution; building on his work with heredity and [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridization]], he proposed a theory of [[mutationism]], which was widely accepted in the early 20th century. [[Lamarckism]] also had many adherents. [[Darwinism]] was seen as incompatible with the continuously variable traits studied by [[biometry|biometricians]], which seemed only partially heritable. In the 1920s and 1930s—following the acceptance of the Mendelian-chromosome theory— the emergence of the discipline of [[population genetics]], with the work of [[R.A. Fisher]], [[J.B.S. Haldane]] and [[Sewall Wright]], unified the idea of evolution by [[natural selection]] with [[Mendelian inheritance|Mendelian genetics]], producing the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]]. The [[inheritance of acquired characters]] was rejected, while mutationism gave way as genetic theories matured.&lt;ref&gt;Smocovitis, ''Unifying Biology'', chapter 5; see also: Mayr and Provine (eds.), ''The Evolutionary Synthesis''&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second half of the century the ideas of population genetics began to be applied in the new discipline of the genetics of behavior, [[sociobiology]], and, especially in humans, [[evolutionary psychology]]. In the 1960s [[W.D. Hamilton]] and others developed [[game theory]] approaches to explain [[altruism]] from an evolutionary perspective through [[kin selection]]. The possible origin of higher organisms through [[endosymbiosis]], and contrasting approaches to molecular evolution in the [[gene-centered view of evolution|gene-centered view]] (which held selection as the predominant cause of evolution) and the [[neutral theory of molecular evolution|neutral theory]] (which made [[genetic drift]] a key factor) spawned perennial debates over the proper balance of [[adaptationism]] and contingency in evolutionary theory.&lt;ref&gt;Gould, ''The Structure of Evolutionary Theory'', chapter 8; Larson, ''Evolution'', chapter 12&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s [[Stephen Jay Gould]] and [[Niles Eldredge]] proposed the theory of [[punctuated equilibrium]] which holds that stasis is the most prominent feature of the fossil record, and that most evolutionary changes occur rapidly over relatively short periods of time.&lt;ref&gt;Larson, ''Evolution'', pp 271–283&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980 [[Luis Walter Alvarez|Luis Alvarez]] and [[Walter Alvarez]] proposed the hypothesis that an [[impact event]] was responsible for the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]].&lt;ref&gt;Zimmer, ''Evolution'', pp 188–195&lt;/ref&gt; Also in the early 1980s, statistical analysis of the fossil record of marine organisms published by [[Jack Sepkoski]] and [[David M. Raup]] lead to a better appreciation of the importance of [[mass extinction events]] to the history of life on earth.&lt;ref&gt;Zimmer, ''Evolution'', pp 169–172&lt;/ref&gt;

==Twenty-first century==
Advances were made in analytical chemistry and physics instrumentation including improved sensors, optics, tracers, instrumentation, signal processing, networks, robots, satellites, and compute power for data collection, storage, analysis, modeling, visualization, and simulations.  These technology advances allowed theoretical and experimental research including internet publication of zoological science.  This enabled worldwide access to better measurements, theoretical models, complex simulations, theory predictive model experimentation, analysis, worldwide internet observational [[data reporting]], open peer-review, collaboration, and internet publication.

The '''interconnect bottleneck''' comprises limits on [[integrated circuit]] (IC) performance due to connections between components instead of their internal speed.
In 2006 it was predicted to  be a "looming crisis" by 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/04/060417124542.htm |title= Quantum Paint-on Laser Could Rescue Computer Chip Industry |work= Science Daily |date= April 17, 2006 |accessdate= May 23, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Improved performance of computer systems has been achieved, in large part, by downscaling the IC minimum feature size. This allows the basic IC building block, the [[transistor]], to operate at a higher frequency, performing more computations per second. However, downscaling of the minimum feature size also results in tighter packing of the wires on a [[microprocessor]], which increases [[parasitic capacitance]] and signal propagation delay. Consequently, the delay due to the communication between the parts of a chip becomes comparable to the computation delay itself. This phenomenon, known as an “interconnect bottleneck”, is becoming a major problem in high-performance computer systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ece.rochester.edu/~weiss/SMW%20papers/MH_SPIE2004.pdf Dynamically tunable 1D and 2D photonic bandgap structures for optical interconnect applications]&lt;/ref&gt;

This interconnect bottleneck can be solved by utilizing optical interconnects to replace the long metallic interconnects.&lt;ref name="iptronics"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.iptronics.com/36209/Optical%20interconnects.html|title=Parallel Optical Interconnects|last=Bek|first=Jesper|date=2008-06-09|publisher=[[IPtronics]]|accessdate=2010-04-09|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110305124306/http://www.iptronics.com/36209/Optical%20interconnects.html|archivedate=2011-03-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such hybrid optical/electronic interconnects promises better performance even with larger designs. Optics has widespread use in long-distance communications; still it has not yet been widely used in chip-to-chip or on-chip interconnections because they (in centimeter or micrometer range) are not yet industry-manufacturable owing to costlier technology and lack of fully mature technologies. As optical interconnections move from computer network applications to chip level interconnections, new requirements for high connection density and alignment reliability have become as critical for the effective utilization of these links. There are still many materials, fabrication, and packaging challenges in integrating optic and electronic technologies.

[[File:Fenestraria rhopalophylla.jpg|thumb| A flowering ''[[Fenestraria rhopalophylla]]'', so named due to the translucent leaf window on the tips of its modified leaf.]]
'''Leaf window''', also known as '''epidermal window''',&lt;ref name=e2007/&gt; is a specialized [[leaf]] structure consisting of a translucent area where sunlight can enter into the interior surfaces of the plant's modified leaf where [[photosynthesis]] can occur. This is also known as '''fenestration'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |authors=Hickey, M.; King, C. |year=2001  |title=The Cambridge Illustrated Glossary of Botanical Terms |publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |authors=Beentje, H.; Williamson, J. |year=2010  |title=The Kew Plant Glossary: an Illustrated Dictionary of Plant Terms |publisher=Kew Publishing |location=Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The translucent structure may include epidermal tissue, and in some succulent plants it consists of several cell layers of [[parenchyma]], which may also function as water-storage tissue.&lt;ref name=Christensen&gt;{{citation |authors=Christensen-Dean, G.A.; Moore, R. |year=1993 |title=Development of Chlorenchyma and Window Tissues in Leaves of ''Peperomia columella'' |journal=Annals of Botany |volume=71 |issue=2 |pages=141–146 |url=http://aob.oxfordjournals.org/content/71/2/141.abstract |doi=10.1006/anbo.1993.1018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can appear as a large continuous patch, a variegated or reticulated region, or as numerous small spots. This structural adaptation is found in certain [[succulent plant]]s native to arid climates, which allow much of the plant to remain beneath the soil surface where it is protected from desiccation of extreme winds and heat while optimizing the absorption of light by increasing the photosynthetic surface area. Many of the known species containing leaf windows are native to [[South Africa]] and neighbouring countries.

==Functions==
The primary function of the translucent windows on the leaf epidermis is to increase the absorption of radiant energy, and thereby the rate of photosynthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Egbert|first=K.|date=March 2002|title=The Influence of Leaf Windows on the Utilization and Absorption of Radiant Energy in Seven Desert Succulents|journal=Photosynthetica|doi=10.1023/A:1020129820295|pmid=|volume=40|pages=35–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Epidermal windows are commonly situated at the apex of leaves, allowing unobstructed sunlight to be captured and utilized even when the plant is buried below the surface of the soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cactus-art.biz/note-book/Dictionary/Dictionary_W/dictionary_windowed.htm|title=Windowed|website=www.cactus-art.biz|access-date=2016-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The absence of [[stoma]]ta in the translucent tissue of the window prevents water loss in the plant. This allows succulents to minimize the exposure of leaf surface area to the outside environment and reduce the risk of [[desiccation]] under intense heat. The actual green, photosynthesizing surface is hidden in the underground part of the plant, so that it collects only the diffused light that strikes the windows, which in turn focusses and channels it to the leaves' inside surface.&lt;ref name=e2007&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1093/jxb/ern105| volume = 59| issue = 7| pages = 1863–1873| last1 = Egbert| first1 = K.

[[Carnivorous plants]] can also make use of by growing traps (highly modified leaves) which use sunlight to lure and/or confuse insects and increase the effectiveness of the trap.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ww2.kqed.org/science/2014/03/03/predatory-plant-lure-of-the-cobra-lily/|title=Predatory Plant: Lure of the Cobra Lily|website=KQED Science|language=en-us|access-date=2016-06-10|date=2014-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Limerence''' is a state of mind which results from a [[Romance (love)|romantic attraction]] to another person and typically includes obsessive thoughts and fantasies and a desire to form or maintain a relationship with the object of love and have one's feelings reciprocated.

==Origin and meaning of the term==
[[Psychologist]] [[Dorothy Tennov]] coined the term "limerence" for her 1979 book, ''Love and Limerence:  The Experience of Being in Love'', to describe a concept that had grown out of her work in the mid-1960s, when she interviewed over 500 people on the topic of love.&lt;ref name="Love and Limerence"&gt;{{cite book |last=Tennov|first=Dorothy|authorlink=Dorothy Tennov|title=Love and Limerence: the Experience of Being in Love|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uPsDAAAACAAJ|accessdate=12 March 2011|year=1999|publisher=Scarborough House|isbn=978-0-8128-6286-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Limerence, which is not exclusively sexual, has been defined in terms of its potentially inspirational effects and in relation to [[attachment theory]]. It has been described as being "an involuntary potentially inspiring state of adoration and attachment to a limerent object (LO) involving [[Intrusive thought|intrusive]] and obsessive thoughts, feelings and behaviors from euphoria to despair, contingent on perceived emotional reciprocation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Willmott|first=Lynn|title=Love and Limerence: Harness the Limbicbrain| year= 2012| publisher= Lathbury House|isbn= 978-1481215312}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Attachment theory emphasizes that "many of the most intense [[emotion]]s arise during the formation, the maintenance, the disruption, and the renewal of attachment relationships".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|first= John |last= Bowlby| title= Attachment| editor-first= Richard |editor-last= Gregory |work= The Oxford Companion to the Mind| publisher= Oxford |year= 1987| page= 57}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that "the state of limerence is the conscious experience of sexual incentive motivation" during attachment formation, "a kind of subjective experience of sexual incentive motivation"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Agmo|2007|pp=173, 186}}&lt;/ref&gt; during the "intensive ... pair-forming stage"&lt;ref name="Morris1994"&gt;{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=223}}&lt;/ref&gt; of human affectionate bonding.

==Characteristics==
The concept of 'limerence' "provides a particular carving up of the semantic domain of love",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=V. C. |editor-last=De Munck|title=Romantic Love and Sexual Behavior |year=1998 |page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and represents an attempt at a scientific study of the nature of love. Limerence is considered as a [[cognitive]] and emotional state of being emotionally attached to or even obsessed with another person, and is typically experienced involuntarily and characterized by a strong desire for reciprocation of one's feelings—a near-obsessive form of [[Romance (love)|romantic love]].&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{cite journal

|accessdate=2008-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Tennov, "sexual attraction is an essential component of limerence ... the limerent is a potential sex partner".&lt;ref name="Tennov"&gt;{{harvnb|Tennov|1998|p=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Limerence is sometimes also interpreted as [[infatuation]], or what is colloquially known as a "crush".  However, in common speech, infatuation includes aspects of immaturity and extrapolation from insufficient information, and is usually short-lived.  Tennov notes how limerence "may dissolve soon after its initiation, as in an early teenage buzz-centered crush",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leggett|Malm|1995|p=86}}&lt;/ref&gt; but she is more concerned with the point when "limerent bonds are characterized by 'entropy' crystallization as described by [[Stendhal]] in his 1821 treatise ''On Love'', where a new love infatuation perceptually begins to transform ... [and] attractive characteristics are exaggerated and unattractive characteristics are given little or no attention ... [creating] a 'limerent object'".

According to Tennov, there are at least two types of love: limerence, which she describes as, among other things, "loving attachment", and "loving affection", the bond that exists between an individual and their parents and children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2003/dec/14/features.magazine47 |work= The Guardian |title= That crazy little thing called love |date= 14 December 2003 |accessdate= 15 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; She notes that one form may evolve into the other: "Those whose limerence was replaced by affectional bonding with the same partner might say ... 'We were very much in love when we married; today we love each other very much'".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tennov|1998|p=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; The distinction is comparable to that drawn by [[ethologists]] "between the pair-forming and pair-maintaining functions of sexual activity",&lt;ref name="Morris1994" /&gt; just as "the attachment of the attachment theorists is very similar to the emotional reciprocation longed for in Tennov's limerence, and each is linked to sexuality".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Moore|1998|p=260}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Limerence is characterized by [[Intrusive thoughts|intrusive thinking]] and pronounced sensitivity to external events that reflect the disposition of the limerent object towards the individual. It can be experienced as intense [[joy]] or as extreme [[Despair (emotion)|despair]], depending on whether the feelings are reciprocated. Basically, it is the state of being completely carried away by unreasoned [[passion (emotion)|passion]] or [[love]],{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} even to the point of [[Addiction|addictive]]-type behavior. Usually, one is inspired with an intense passion or admiration for someone. Limerence can be difficult to understand for those who have never experienced it, and it is thus often dismissed by non-limerents as ridiculous fantasy or a construct of romantic fiction.&lt;ref name="Love and Limerence" /&gt;

Tennov differentiates between limerence and other emotions by asserting that [[love]] involves concern for the other person's welfare and feeling. While limerence does not require it, those concerns may certainly be incorporated. [[Affection]] and fondness exist only as a disposition towards another person, irrespective of whether those feelings are reciprocated, whereas limerence deeply desires reciprocation, but it remains unaltered whether or not it is returned. Physical contact with the object is neither essential nor sufficient to an individual experiencing limerence, unlike with one experiencing [[sexual attraction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Diamond|first1=Lisa|title=Emerging Perspectives on Distinctions Between Romantic Love and Sexual Desire|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|volume=13|page=2|url=http://www.psych.utah.edu/people/people/diamond/Publications/Emerging%20Perspectives.pdf|accessdate=25 July 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304003453/http://www.psych.utah.edu/people/people/diamond/Publications/Emerging%20Perspectives.pdf|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Where early, unhealthy attachment patterns or [[Psychological trauma|trauma]] influence limerence, the limerent object may be construed as an idealization of the figure or figures involved in the original unhealthy attachment or trauma. Lack of reciprocation may in such instances serve to reinforce lessons learned in earlier, unhealthy bonding experiences, and hence strengthen the limerence.

==Components==
Limerence involves intrusive thinking about the limerent object.&lt;ref name="Love and Limerence" /&gt; Other characteristics include acute longing for reciprocation, fear of rejection, and unsettling shyness in the limerent object's presence. In cases of unrequited limerence, transient relief may be found by vividly imagining reciprocation from the limerent object. Tennov suggests that feelings of limerence can be intensified through adversity, obstacles, or distance—'Intensification through Adversity'.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leggett|Malm|1995|p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; A limerent person may have acute sensitivity to any act, thought, or condition that can be interpreted favorably. This may include a tendency to devise, fabricate, or invent "reasonable" explanations for why neutral actions are a sign of hidden passion in the limerent object.

A person experiencing limerence has a general intensity of feeling that leaves other concerns in the background. In their thoughts, such a person tends to emphasize what is admirable in the limerent object and to avoid any negative or problematic attributes.

===Intrusive thinking and fantasy===
During the height of limerence, thoughts of the limerent object (or person) are at once persistent, involuntary and intrusive. Such 'intrusive thoughts about the LO ... appear to be genetically driven':&lt;ref name="moore268"&gt;{{harvnb|Moore|1998|p=268}}&lt;/ref&gt; indeed, limerence is first and foremost a condition of cognitive obsession. This may be caused by low serotonin levels in the brain, comparable to those of people with [[obsessive–compulsive disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;Marazziti D, Akiskal HS, Rossi A, Cassano GB. "Alteration of the platelet serotonin transporter in romantic love." ''Psychol Med.'' 2000&lt;/ref&gt; All events, associations, stimuli, and experiences return thoughts to the limerent object with unnerving consistency, while conversely the constant thoughts about the limerent object define all other experiences. If a certain thought has no previous connection with the limerent object, immediately one is made. Limerent fantasy is unsatisfactory unless rooted in reality,&lt;ref name="Love and Limerence" /&gt; because the fantasizer may want the fantasy to seem realistic and somewhat possible.  At their most severe, intrusive limerent thoughts can occupy an individual's waking hours completely, resulting—like severe addiction—in significant or complete disruption of the limerent's normal interests and activities, including work and family.  For serial limerents, this can result in debilitating, lifelong underachievement in school, work, and family life.  Comparisons{{which|date=December 2013}} made between limerence and substance addiction may draw attention to the constant, free availability of the limerent's "drug of choice".

Fantasies that are concerned with far-fetched ideas are usually dropped by the fantasizer.&lt;ref name="Love and Limerence" /&gt; Sometimes fantasizing is retrospective: actual events are replayed from memory with great vividness. This form predominates when what is viewed as evidence of possible reciprocation can be re-experienced (a kind of selective or revisionist history). Otherwise, the long fantasy is anticipatory; it begins in the everyday world and climaxes at the attainment of the limerent goal. A limerent fantasy can also involve an unusual, often tragic, event.

The long fantasies form bridges between the limerent's ordinary life and that intensely desired ecstatic moment. The duration and complexity of a fantasy depend on the availability of time and freedom from distractions. The bliss of the imagined moment of consummation is greater when events imagined to precede it are possible (though they often represent grave departures from the probable). Not always is it entirely pleasant, and when rejection seems likely the thoughts focus on despair, sometimes to the point of [[suicide]]. The pleasantness or unpleasantness of the state seems almost unrelated to the intensity of the reaction. Although the direction of feeling, i.e. happy versus unhappy, shifts rapidly, with 'dramatic surges of buoyancy and despair',&lt;ref name=moore268/&gt; the intensity of intrusive and involuntary thinking alters less rapidly, and only in response to an accumulation of experiences with the particular limerent object.

Fantasies are occasionally dreamed by the one experiencing limerence. Dreams give out strong emotion and happiness when experienced, but often end with despair when the subject awakens. Dreams can reawaken strong feelings toward the limerent object after the feelings have declined.

=== Fear of rejection ===
Along with an emphasis on the perceived exceptional qualities, and devotion to them, there is abundant doubt that the feelings are reciprocated: [[social rejection#Romantic rejection|rejection]]. Considerable self-doubt is encountered, leading to "personal incapacitation expressed through unsettling timidity in the presence of the person",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leggett|Malm|1995|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; something which causes misery and galvanizes desire.

In most cases, what destroys limerence is a suitably long period of time without [[Reciprocity (social psychology)|reciprocation]]. Although it appears that limerence advances with adversity, personal discomfort may foul it.  This discomfort results from a fear of the limerent object's opinions.

=== Hope ===
Limerence develops and is sustained when there is a certain balance of hope and uncertainty. The basis for limerent hope is not in objective reality but in reality as it is perceived. The inclination is to sift through nuances of speech and [[wikt:subtleties|subtleties]] of behavior for evidence of limerent hope. "Lovers, of course, are notoriously frantic [[epistemologist]]s, second only to paranoiacs (and analysts) as readers of signs and wonders."&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, Adam. ''On Flirtation'' (London 1994) p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; "Little things" are noticed and endlessly analyzed for meaning. Such excessive concern over trivia may not be entirely unfounded, however, as body language can indicate reciprocated feeling. What the limerent object said and did is recalled with vividness. Alternative meanings for the behaviors recalled are sought. Each word and gesture is permanently available for review, especially those interpreted as evidence in favor of reciprocated feeling. When objects, people, places or situations are encountered with the limerent object, they are vividly remembered, especially if the limerent object  interacted with them in some way.

The belief that the limerent object does not and will not reciprocate can only be reached with great difficulty. Limerence can be carried quite far before acknowledgment of rejection is genuine, especially if it has not been addressed openly by the limerent object.

==Effects==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}

===Physical effects===
The physiological correlations of intense limerence can include [[seizure]]-like [[trembling]], [[pallor]], [[flushing (physiology)|flushing]], [[heart palpitations]], [[pupil dilation]] and general [[Muscle weakness|weakness]]. [[Awkwardness]], [[stuttering]], [[shyness]], and [[confusion]] predominate at the behavioral level. Less common effects include [[insomnia]], [[loss of appetite]],  and [[Syncope (medicine)|passing out]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

If there is extensive [[anxiety]], incorrect behaviour may torpedo the relationship, which may cause physical responses to manifest intensely. Some people acutely feel these effects either immediately or following contact with the limerent object.  Blended is dire ecstasy or keen despair, depending on the turn of events.

The sensitivity that stems from fear of rejection can darken limerent objects' perceived body language. Conflicted signs of [[desire]] may be emitted that confuse judgment.  Often the limerent object is currently involved with another or is in some other way unavailable.

A condition of sustained alertness, a heightening of awareness and an enormous fund of energy to deploy in pursuit of the limerent aim is developed. The sensation of limerence is felt in the midpoint of the chest, bottom of the throat, guts, or in some cases in the abdominal region.&lt;ref name="Love and Limerence" /&gt; This can be interpreted as ecstasy at times of mutuality, but its presence is most noticeable during [[Broken heart|despair at times of rejection]].

===Psychological effects===
Sufferers complain of abandonment, despair, and diabolically humiliating disappointment. A sense of paralyzing ambiguity predominates, punctuated by pining. The fact of intermittent or nonreciprocal response lends to labile vacillation. This [[limbo]] is the threshold for mental prostration.

== Sexuality ==
Awareness of [[physical attraction]] plays a key role in the development of limerence,&lt;ref name="Tennov" /&gt; but is not enough to satisfy the limerent desire, and is almost never the main focus; instead, the limerent focuses on what could be defined as the "beneficial attributes". Nevertheless, Tennov stresses that "the most consistent result of limerence is mating, not merely sexual interaction but also commitment".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tennov|1998|p=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Limerence can be intensified after a sexual relationship has begun, and with more intense limerence there is greater desire for sexual contact. However, while sexual surrender at one time indicated the end of uncertainty felt by the limerent object – because in the past, a sexual encounter more often led to a feeling of obligation to commit – in modern times this is not necessarily the case.

The sexual aspect of limerence is not consistent from person to person.  Most limerents experience limerent sexuality as a component of romantic interest.  Some limerents, however, may experience limerence as a consequence of hyperarousal. In such cases, limerence may form as a [[defense mechanism]] against the limerent object, who is not perceived initially as a romantic ideal, but as a physical threat to the limerent.

[[Sexual fantasy|Sexual fantasies]] are distinct from limerent fantasies. Limerent fantasy is rooted in reality and is intrusive rather than voluntary. Sexual fantasies are under more or less voluntary control and may involve strangers, imaginary individuals, and situations that could not take place. Limerence elevates body temperature and increases relaxation{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}, a sensation of viewing the world with [[Optimism|rose-tinted glasses]], leading to a greater receptiveness to sexuality, and to daydreaming.

People can become aroused by the thought of sexual partners, acts, and situations that are not truly desired, whereas every detail of the limerent fantasy is passionately desired actually to take place. Limerence sometimes increases sexual interest in other partners when the limerent object is unreceptive or unavailable.

== Limerent reaction ==
The limerent reaction is a composite reaction – that is, it is composed of a series of separate reactions.  These reactions occur only where misperceptions meet adversity in the context of a romance.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}  Perhaps because of this unique specificity, limerent reactions can be uniquely quantified and predicted according to the schema described below.

Involvement increases if obstacles are externally imposed or if the limerent object’s feelings are doubted. Only if the limerent object were to be revealed as highly undesirable might limerence subside. The presence of some degree of doubt causes the intensity of the feelings to increase further.  The stage is reached at which the reaction is virtually impossible to dislodge. This adversity may be superficial or deep, internal or external, so that an individual may sometimes generate deep adversity where none exists.  Also "romance", as it were, need not be present in any genuine way for a limerent reaction to occur.

The course of limerence results in a more intrusive thinking pattern. This thinking pattern is an expectant and often joyous period with the initial focusing on the limerent object’s admirable qualities: [[crystallization (love)|crystallization]]. Then, under appropriate conditions of hope and uncertainty, the limerence intensifies further.

With evidence of reciprocation (real or imagined) from the limerent object, a state of extreme pleasure, even euphoria, is enjoyed. Thoughts are mainly occupied with considering and reconsidering what is attractive in the limerent object, replaying whatever events may have thus far transpired with the limerent object, and appreciating personal qualities perceived as possibly having sparked interest in the limerent object. At peak crystallization, almost all waking thoughts revolve around the limerent object. After this peak, the feelings eventually decline.

Fantasies are preferred to virtually any other activity with the exception of activities that are believed to help obtain the limerent object, and activities that involve actually being in the presence of the limerent object. The motivation to attain a "relationship" continues to intensify so long as a proper mix of hope and uncertainty exist.

== Limerent duration ==

Tennov estimates, based on both questionnaire and interview data, that the average limerent reaction duration, from the moment of initiation until a feeling of neutrality is reached, is approximately three years. The extremes may be as brief as a few weeks or as long as several decades. When limerence is brief, maximum intensity may not have been attained. According to David Sack, M.D., limerence lasts longer than romantic love, but is shorter than a healthy, committed partnership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Others suggest that 'the biogenetic sourcing of limerence determines its limitation, ordinarily, to a two-year span',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leggett|Malm|1995|p=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; that limerence generally lasts between 18 months and three years; but further studies on unrequited limerence have suggested longer durations. In turn, a limerent may only experience a single limerent episode, or may experience "serial" episodes, in which nearly one's entire mature life, from early puberty through late adulthood, can be consumed in successive limerent obsessions.

== Bond varieties ==
{{Main|Human bonding}}
Once the ''limerent reaction'' has initiated, one of three varieties of bonds may form, defined over a set duration of time, in relation to the experience or non-experience of limerence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Diamond|first1=Lisa|title=Emerging Perspectives on Distinctions Between Romantic Love and Sexual Desire|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|volume=13|page=1|url=http://www.psych.utah.edu/people/people/diamond/Publications/Emerging%20Perspectives.pdf|accessdate=25 July 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304003453/http://www.psych.utah.edu/people/people/diamond/Publications/Emerging%20Perspectives.pdf|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The constitution of these bonds may vary over the course of the relationship, in ways that may either increase or decrease the intensity of the limerence.

The basis and interesting characteristic of this delineation made by Tennov, is that based on her research and interviews with people, all human bonded relationships can be divided into three varieties being defined by the amount of limerence or non-limerence each partner contributes to the relationship.

With an affectional bond, neither partner is limerent. With a Limerent-Nonlimerent bond, one partner is limerent. In a Limerent-Limerent bond, both partners are limerent.

Affectional bonding characterize those affectionate sexual relationships where neither partner is limerent; couples tend to be in love, but do not report continuous and unwanted intrusive thinking, feeling intense need for exclusivity, or define their goals in terms of reciprocity.  These types of bonded couples tend to emphasize compatibility of interests, mutual preferences in leisure activities, ability to work together, and in some cases a degree of relative contentment.

The bulk of relationships, however, according to Tennov, are those between a limerent person and a nonlimerent other, i.e. ''limerent-nonlimerent bonding''.  These bonds are characterized by unequal reciprocation.

Lastly, those relationship bonds in which there exists mutual reciprocation are defined as ''limerent-limerent bondings''.  Tennov argues that since limerence itself is an "unstable state", mutually limerent bonds would be expected to be short-lived; mixed relationships probably last longer than limerent-limerent relationships. Some limerent-limerent relationships evolve into affectional bondings over time as limerence declines.  Tennov describes such couples as "old marrieds" whose interactions are typically both stable and mutually gratifying.

==Mitigation==
In her study Tennov identified three ways in which limerence subsides: 
;Consummation (reciprocation)
:Each limerent has a slightly different view of acceptable reciprocation, and the reactions to reciprocation vary.  Some limerents remain limerent (as documented by Tennov), while for others the limerence subsides as the certainty of reciprocity grows.  Other limerents do not achieve any "real" consummation (e.g. physical, or in the form of an actual relationship) but find their limerence waning after a limerent object professes similar feelings.
;Starvation
:In this process, a lack of ''any'' notice (i.e. starvation, described by Tennov as "the onslaught of evidence that LO does not return the limerence") causes the limerent to gradually desensitize. This desensitization may take a long time, in which case a limerent's latent hypersensitivity may cause any attention given by a former LO, regardless of how slight, to be interpreted as a reason for hope, precipitating a resurgence of limerence.
;Transference
:The limerent transfers their romantic feelings to another person, thereby ending the initial limerence; the limerence is sometimes transferred as well.

==Continuing research==
Tennov's research has been continued{{when|refers to 2008 articles|date=January 2018}} by Albert Wakin, who knew Tennov at the [[University of Bridgeport]] but did not assist in her research, and Duyen Vo, a graduate student of [[Southern Connecticut State University]].&lt;ref name="usatoday"&gt;{{cite news

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their goal is to refine the term limerence so that it refers mostly to the negative aspects.

The term "limerence" has been invoked in many popular media,{{according to whom|date=January 2018}} including self-help books, popular magazines, and websites.  However, according to a paper by Wakin and Vo, "In spite of the public’s exposure to limerence, the professional community, particularly clinical, is largely unaware of the concept."&lt;ref name="Wakin-Vo"&gt;{{Cite journal

They reported that more research must be gathered before the condition is suitable for inclusion in the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (''DSM'').&lt;ref name=usatoday/&gt;

Critics point out that Tennov's account "is based on interviews rather than on direct observation", but conclude that "despite its shortcomings, Tennov's work may constitute a basis for informed hypothesis formulation".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Agmo|2007|p=172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lost-wax casting''' (also called "[[investment casting]]", "precision casting", or '''''cire perdue''''' which has been adopted into English from the [[French language|French]])&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]]. [http://www.oed.com.rp.nla.gov.au/view/Entry/33422?redirectedFrom=cire+perdue#eid]&lt;/ref&gt; is the process by which a duplicate [[metal]] [[sculpture]] (often [[silver]], [[gold]], [[brass]] or [[bronze]]) is [[casting|cast]] from an original sculpture. Intricate works can be achieved by this method. 

The oldest known example of this technique is a 6,000-year old amulet from Indus valley civilization.&lt;ref&gt;Thoury, M.; et al. (2016). "High spatial dynamics-photoluminescence imaging reveals the metallurgy of the earliest lost-wax cast object". Nature Communications. 7. doi:10.1038/ncomms13356.&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples from a similar period are the objects discovered in the [[Cave of the Treasure]] ([[Nahal Mishmar]]) [[hoard]] in southern [[Israel]], and which belong to the [[Chalcolithic]] period (4500–3500 BC). Conservative estimates of age from [[carbon-14 dating]] date the items to c. 3700 BC, making them more than 5,700 years old.&lt;ref name="Moorey" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Muhly"&gt;{{cite paper |last=Muhly |first=J.D. |title=The Beginnings of Metallurgy in the Old World }} In {{harvnb|Maddin|1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Lost-wax casting was widespread in Europe until the 18th century, when a [[piece-moulding]] process came to predominate.

The steps used in casting small bronze sculptures are fairly standardized, though the process today varies from [[foundry]] to foundry. (In modern [[Industry|industrial]] use, the process is called investment casting.) Variations of the process include: "lost [[Mold (manufacturing)|mould]]", which recognizes that materials other than [[wax]] can be used (such as: [[tallow]], [[resin]], [[tar]], and [[textile]]);&lt;ref name="Agrawal"&gt;{{cite book

==Process==
Casts can be made of the wax model itself, the direct method, or of a wax copy of a model that need not be of wax, the indirect method. These are the steps for the indirect process:

#'''Model-making.''' An artist or mould-maker creates an original model from wax, [[clay]], or another material.  Wax and oil-based clay are often preferred because these materials retain their softness.
#'''Mouldmaking.''' A [[molding (process)|mould]] is made of the original model or sculpture.  The rigid outer moulds contain the softer inner mould, which is the exact negative of the original model. Inner moulds are usually made of [[latex]], [[polyurethane|polyurethane rubber]] or [[silicone]], which is supported by the outer mould. The outer mould can be made from [[plaster]], but can also be made of [[Glass-reinforced plastic|fiberglass]] or other materials. Most moulds are made of at least two pieces, and a [[Shim (engineering)|shim]] with keys is placed between the parts during construction so that the mould can be put back together accurately. If there are long, thin pieces extending out of the model, they are often cut off of the original and moulded separately.  Sometimes many moulds are needed to recreate the original model, especially for large models.
#'''Wax.''' Once the mould is finished, molten wax is poured into it and swished around until an even coating, usually about {{frac|1|8}}&amp;nbsp;inch (3&amp;nbsp;mm) thick, covers the inner surface of the mould.  This is repeated until the desired thickness is reached. Another method is to fill the entire mould with molten wax and let it cool until a desired thickness has set on the surface of the mould. After this the rest of the wax is poured out again, the mould is turned upside down and the wax layer is left to cool and harden. With this method it is more difficult to control the overall thickness of the wax layer.
#'''Removal of wax'''. This hollow wax copy of the original model is removed from the mould. The model-maker may reuse the mould to make multiple copies, limited only by the durability of the mould.
#'''Chasing'''. Each hollow wax copy is then "chased": a heated metal tool is used to rub out the marks that show the [[parting line]] or [[Molding flash|flashing]] where the pieces of the mould came together.  The wax is dressed to hide any imperfections. The wax now looks like the finished piece.  Wax pieces that were moulded separately can now be heated and attached; foundries often use registration marks to indicate exactly where they go.
#'''Spruing.''' The wax copy is [[Sprue (molding)|sprued]] with a treelike structure of wax that will eventually provide paths for the  molten casting material to flow and for air to escape. The carefully planned spruing usually begins at the top with a wax "cup," which is attached by wax cylinders to various points on the wax copy.  The spruing does not have to be hollow, as it will be melted out later in the process.
#'''Slurry.''' A sprued wax copy is dipped into a slurry of silica, then into a sand-like [[stucco]], or dry crystalline silica of a controlled grain size. The slurry and grit combination is called ceramic shell mould material, although it is not literally made of [[ceramic]].  This shell is allowed to dry, and the process is repeated until at least a half-inch coating covers the entire piece.  The bigger the piece, the thicker the shell needs to be.  Only the inside of the cup is not coated, and the cup's flat top serves as the base upon which the piece stands during this process.
#'''Burnout.''' The ceramic shell-coated piece is placed cup-down in a [[kiln]], whose heat hardens the silica coatings into a shell, and the wax melts and runs out.  The melted wax can be recovered and reused, although it is often simply burned up.  Now all that remains of the original artwork is the negative space formerly occupied by the wax, inside the hardened ceramic shell.  The feeder, vent tubes and cup are also now hollow.
#'''Testing.''' The ceramic shell is allowed to cool, then is tested to see if [[water]] will flow freely through the feeder and vent tubes. Cracks or leaks can be patched with thick refractory paste. To test the thickness, holes can be drilled into the shell, then patched.
#'''Pouring.''' The shell is reheated in the kiln to harden the patches and remove all traces of moisture, then placed cup-upwards into a tub filled with sand. Metal is melted in a [[crucible]] in a furnace, then poured carefully into the shell. The shell has to be hot because otherwise the temperature difference would shatter it. The filled shells are then allowed to cool.
#'''Release.''' The shell is hammered or sand-blasted away, releasing the rough casting. The sprues, which are also faithfully recreated in metal, are cut off, the material to be reused in another casting.
#'''Metal-chasing.''' Just as the wax copies were chased, the casting is worked until the telltale signs of the casting process are removed, so that the casting now looks like the original model. Pits left by air bubbles in the casting and the stubs of the spruing are filed down and polished.

Prior to silica-based casting moulds, these moulds were made of a variety of other fire-proof materials, the most common being [[plaster]] based, with added grout, and [[clay]] based. Prior to rubber moulds gelatine was used.

== Casting jewellery and small parts ==
The methods used for small parts and [[jewellery]] vary somewhat from those used for sculpture.  A wax model is obtained either from injection into a rubber mould or by being custom-made by carving.  The wax or waxes are sprued and fused onto a rubber base, called a "sprue base".  Then a metal flask, which resembles a short length of steel pipe that ranges roughly from 1.5 to six inches tall and wide, is put over the sprue base and the waxes.  Most sprue bases have a circular rim which grips the standard-sized flask, holding it in place.  Investment (refractory plaster) is mixed and poured into the flask, filling it.  It hardens, then is burned out as outlined above. Casting is usually done straight from the kiln either by [[centrifugal casting (industrial)|centrifugal casting]] or [[Casting (metalworking)#Filling|vacuum casting]].

The lost-wax process can be used with any material that can [[Combustion|burn]], [[Melting|melt]], or [[Evaporation|evaporate]] to leave a mould cavity.  Some [[automobile]] manufacturers use a lost-foam technique to make [[Cylinder block|engine blocks]].  The model is made of [[polystyrene]] foam, which is placed into a [[casting flask]], consisting of a [[cope and drag]], which is then filled with [[molding sand|casting sand]].  The foam supports the sand, allowing shapes that would be impossible if the process had to rely on the sand alone.  The metal is poured in, [[Vaporization|vaporizing]] the foam with its heat.

In dentistry, gold crowns, inlays and onlays are made by the lost-wax technique.Application of Lost Wax technique for the fabrication of cast inlay was first reported by Taggart.  A typical gold alloy is about 60% gold and 28% silver with copper and other metals making up the rest. Careful attention to tooth preparation, impression taking and laboratory technique are required to make this type of restoration a success. Dental laboratories make other items this way as well.

==Textile use==
In this process, the wax and the textile are both replaced by the metal during the casting process, whereby the fabric reinforcement allows for a thinner model, and thus reduces the amount of metal expended in the mould.&lt;ref name=Bunker&gt;{{cite book

==Archaeological history==
[[File:Hecht 090710 Sceptre.jpg|thumb|Replica of bronze sceptre from the Nahal Mishmar Hoard.]]

===Middle East===
Some of the oldest known examples of the lost-wax technique are the objects discovered in the [[Cave of the Treasure]] ([[Nahal Mishmar]]) hoard in southern [[Israel]], and which belong to the [[Chalcolithic]] period (4500–3500 BC). Conservative Carbon 14 estimates date the items to c.3700 BC, making them more than 5700 years old.&lt;ref name=Moorey/&gt;&lt;ref name="Muhly"/&gt;

===Near East===
In [[Mesopotamia]], from c. 3500–2750 BC, the lost-wax technique was used for small-scale, and then later large-scale copper and bronze statues.&lt;ref name=Moorey&gt;{{cite paper |last=Moorey |first=P.R.S. |title=Early Metallurgy in Mesopotamia }} In {{harvnb|Maddin|1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the earliest surviving lost-wax castings is a small lion [[pendant]]  from [[Uruk IV]].

Metalcasting by the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] began around 3500 BC in the [[Mohenjodaro]] area,&lt;ref name=Kuppuram/&gt; which produced one of the earliest known examples of lost-wax casting, an Indian bronze figurine named the “dancing girl” that dates back nearly 5,000 years to the [[Indus Valley Civilization|Harappan]] period (c. 3300–1300 BC).&lt;ref name=Kuppuram/&gt;&lt;ref name=Krishnan/&gt; Other examples include the buffalo, bull and dog found at Mohenjodaro and [[Harappa]],&lt;ref name=Agrawal/&gt;&lt;ref name=Krishnan/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kenoyer&gt;Kenoyer, J.

==Literary history==

=== Indirect evidence ===
[[File:Name Kylix by the Foundry Painter Antikensammlung Berlin 2.jpg|thumb|The Berlin Foundry Cup, early 5th century BC]]

Some early [[Literature|literary works]] allude to lost-wax casting. [[Columella]], a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] writer of the 1st century AD, mentions the processing of wax from [[beehive]]s in ''De Re Rustica'', perhaps for casting, as does [[Pliny the Elder]],&lt;ref name=pliny&gt;{{cite book

One [[Greeks|Greek]] [[Epigraphy|inscription]] refers to the payment of craftsmen for their work on the [[Erechtheum]] in [[Athens]] (408/7–407/6 BC). Clay-modellers may use clay moulds to make [[terracotta]] negatives for casting or to produce wax positives.&lt;ref name=Humphrey/&gt; Pliny portrays&lt;ref name=pliny/&gt; {{illm|Zenodorus (sculptor)|lt=Zenodorous|fr|Zénodore (sculpteur)}} as a well-reputed ancient artist producing bronze statues,&lt;ref name=Jex&gt;[[Katharine Jex-Blake|Jex-Blake, K.]] &amp; E.

Many bronze statues or parts of statues in antiquity were cast using the lost wax process. [[Theodorus of Samos]] is commonly associated with bronze casting.&lt;ref name=pliny/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pausania, Description of Greece 8.14.8&lt;/ref&gt; Pliny also mentions the use of [[lead]], which is known to help molten bronze flow into all areas and parts of complex moulds.&lt;ref name=Hurcombe&gt;{{cite book |first=L.M. |last=Hurcombe |title=Archaeological Artefacts as Material Culture |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=16KOAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA207 |year=2014 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-136-80200-3 |page=207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Quintilian]] documents the casting of statues in parts, whose moulds may have been produced by the lost wax process.

=== Direct evidence ===

====India====
The lost-wax method is well documented in ancient Indian literary sources. The ''[[Shilpa shastras]]'', a text from the [[Gupta Empire|Gupta Period]] (c. 320-550 AD), contains detailed information about casting images in metal. The 5th-century AD ''[[Vishnusamhita]]'', an appendix to the ''[[Vishnu Purana]]'', refers directly to the modeling of wax for making metal objects in chapter XIV: "if an image is to be made of metal, it must first be made of wax."&lt;ref name=Kuppuram&gt;{{cite book |first=Govindarajan |last=Kuppuram |title=Ancient Indian Mining, Metallurgy, and Metal Industries |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GAnVuQAACAAJ |year=1989 |publisher=Sundeep Prakashan |isbn=978-81-85067-28-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chapter 68 of the ancient Sanskrit text [[Mānasāra Silpa]] details casting [[Cult image|idols]] in wax and is entitled "[[Maduchchhista vidhānam]]", or the "lost wax method".&lt;ref name=Kuppuram/&gt;&lt;ref name=Krishnan&gt;{{cite book |first=M.V. |last=Krishnan |title=Cire perdue casting in India |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VxhUAAAAMAAJ |year=1976 |publisher=Kanak Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Someshvara III#The Manasollasa|Mānasollāsa]] (also known as the [[Abhilasitārtha chintāmani]]), allegedly written by King [[Someshvara III|Bhūlokamalla Someshvara]] of the [[Western Chalukyas|Chalukya dynasty of Kalyāni]] in AD 1124–1125, also provides detail about lost-wax and other casting processes.&lt;ref name=Kuppuram/&gt;&lt;ref name=Krishnan/&gt;

In a 16th-century treatise, the [[Uttarabhaga]] of the Śilparatna written by [[Srïkumāra]], verses 32 to 52 of Chapter 2 ("Linga lakshanam"), give detailed instructions on making a hollow casting.&lt;ref name=Kuppuram/&gt;&lt;ref name=Krishnan/&gt;

====Theophilus====
An early medieval writer [[Theophilus Presbyter]], believed to be the [[Benedictine]] monk and metalworker [[Roger of Helmarshausen]], wrote a treatise in the early-to-mid-12th century&lt;ref name=Hawthorne&gt;{{cite book |author=Theophilus (Presbyter.) |title=On Divers Arts: The Foremost Medieval Treatise on Painting, Glassmaking, and Metalwork |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MMiLTJqvYnYC |year=1963 |publisher=Dover |isbn=978-0-486-23784-8 |editor-first=John G. |editor-last=Hawthorne |editor1-link=John G. Hawthorne |editor2-first=Cyril Stanley |editor2-last=Smith |editor2-link=Cyril Stanley Smith}}&lt;/ref&gt; that includes original work and copied information from other sources, such as the ''[[Mappae clavicula]]'' and Eraclius, ''De dolorous et artibus Romanorum''.&lt;ref name=Hawthorne/&gt; It provides step-by-step procedures for making various articles, some by lost-wax casting: "The Copper Wind Chest and Its Conductor" (Chapter 84); "Tin Cruets" (Chapter 88), and "Casting Bells" (Chapter 85), which call for using "tallow" instead of wax; and "The Cast Censer". In Chapters 86 and 87 Theophilus details how to divide the wax into differing [[ratio]]s before moulding and casting to achieve accurately tuned small musical [[Bell (instrument)|bells]]. The 16th-century Florentine sculptor [[Benvenuto Cellini]] may have used Theophilus' writings when he cast his bronze [[Perseus]].&lt;ref name=Krishnan/&gt;&lt;ref name=M&gt;{{cite journal |author=M.

The '''magnetosphere of [[Jupiter]]''' is the cavity created in the [[solar wind]] by the planet's [[magnetic field]]. Extending up to seven million kilometers in the Sun's direction and almost to the orbit of [[Saturn]] in the opposite direction, Jupiter's [[magnetosphere]] is the largest and most powerful of any planetary magnetosphere in the [[Solar System]], and by volume the largest known continuous structure in the Solar System after the [[heliosphere]]. Wider and flatter than the [[Earth's magnetosphere]], Jupiter's is stronger by an [[order of magnitude]], while its [[magnetic moment]] is roughly 18,000 times larger. The existence of Jupiter's magnetic field was first inferred from observations of radio emissions at the end of the 1950s and was directly observed by the ''[[Pioneer 10]]'' spacecraft in 1973.

Jupiter's internal magnetic field is generated by electrical currents in the planet's outer core, which is composed of liquid [[metallic hydrogen]]. Volcanic eruptions on Jupiter's moon [[Io (moon)|Io]] eject large amounts of [[sulfur dioxide]] gas into space, forming a large [[gas torus|torus]] around the planet. Jupiter's magnetic field forces the torus to rotate with the same [[angular velocity]] and direction as the planet. The torus in turn loads the magnetic field with [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]], in the process stretching it into a pancake-like structure called a magnetodisk. In effect, Jupiter's magnetosphere is shaped by Io's plasma and its own rotation, rather than by the [[solar wind]] like Earth's magnetosphere. Strong currents in the magnetosphere generate permanent [[aurora (astronomy)|auorae]] around the planet's poles and intense variable radio emissions, which means that Jupiter can be thought of as a very weak [[radio pulsar]]. Jupiter's aurorae have been observed in almost all parts of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]], including [[infrared]], [[visible light|visible]], [[ultraviolet]] and [[soft X-rays]].

The action of the magnetosphere traps and accelerates particles, producing intense belts of [[particle radiation|radiation]] similar to Earth's [[Van Allen belts]], but thousands of times stronger. The interaction of energetic particles with the surfaces of Jupiter's largest [[Galilean moons|moons]] markedly affects their chemical and physical properties. Those same particles also affect and are affected by the motions of the particles within Jupiter's tenuous [[Rings of Jupiter|planetary ring system]]. Radiation belts present a significant hazard for spacecraft and potentially to human space travellers.

== Structure ==
Jupiter's magnetosphere is a complex structure comprising a [[bow shock]], [[magnetosheath]], [[magnetopause]], [[magnetotail]], magnetodisk, and other components. The magnetic field around Jupiter emanates from a number of different sources, including fluid circulation at the planet's core (the internal field), electrical currents in the plasma surrounding Jupiter and the currents flowing at the boundary of the planet's magnetosphere. The magnetosphere is embedded within the plasma of the [[solar wind]], which carries the [[interplanetary magnetic field]].&lt;ref name=Khurana12&gt;[[#Khurana|Khurana]], 2004, pp. 12–13&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Internal magnetic field ===
The bulk of Jupiter's magnetic field, like [[Earth's magnetic field|Earth]]'s, is generated by an internal [[Dynamo theory|dynamo]] supported by the circulation of a conducting fluid in its [[outer core]]. But whereas Earth's core is made of molten [[iron]] and [[nickel]], Jupiter's is composed of [[metallic hydrogen]].&lt;ref name=Russell1993-694/&gt; As with Earth's, Jupiter's magnetic field is mostly a [[dipole]], with north and south magnetic poles at the ends of a single magnetic axis.&lt;ref name=Khurana3/&gt; However, on Jupiter the north pole of the dipole is located in the planet's northern hemisphere and the south pole of the dipole lies in its southern hemisphere, opposite to the Earth, whose north pole lies in the southern hemisphere and south pole lies in the northern hemisphere.&lt;ref name=Kivelson303/&gt;{{refn|The north and south poles of the Earth's dipole should not be confused with Earth's [[North magnetic pole]] and [[South magnetic pole]], which lie in the northern and southern hemispheres, respectively.|group=note}} Jupiter's field also has [[quadrupole]], [[octupole]] and higher components, though they are less than one tenth as strong as the dipole component.&lt;ref name=Khurana3&gt;[[#Khurana|Khurana]], 2004, pp. 3–5&lt;/ref&gt;

The dipole is tilted roughly 10° from Jupiter's axis of rotation; the tilt is similar to that of the Earth (11.3°).&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt;&lt;ref name=Khurana3/&gt; Its equatorial field strength is about 776.6&amp;nbsp;[[microtesla|μT]] (7.766&amp;nbsp;[[Gauss (unit)|G]]), which corresponds to a dipole [[magnetic moment]] of about 2.83{{E-sp|20}} [[Tesla (unit)|T]]·[[cubic meter|m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;]]. This makes Jupiter's magnetic field about 20 times stronger than Earth's, and its magnetic moment ~20,000&amp;nbsp;times larger.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Connerney|first=J. E.

=== Size and shape ===
Jupiter's internal magnetic field prevents the [[solar wind]], a stream of ionized particles emitted by the [[Sun]], from interacting directly with [[atmosphere of Jupiter|its atmosphere]], and instead diverts it away from the planet, effectively creating a cavity in the solar wind flow, called a magnetosphere, composed of a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] different from that of the solar wind.&lt;ref name=Khurana1&gt;[[#Khurana|Khurana]], 2004, pp. 1–3&lt;/ref&gt; The Jovian (i.e. pertaining to Jupiter) magnetosphere is so large that the [[Sun]] and its visible [[corona]] would fit inside it with room to spare.&lt;ref name=Russell1993-715&gt;[[#Russell1993|Russel]], 1993, pp. 715–717&lt;/ref&gt; If one could see it from Earth, it would appear five times larger than the [[full moon]] in the sky despite being nearly 1700 times farther away.&lt;ref name="Russell1993-715"/&gt;

As with Earth's magnetosphere, the boundary separating the denser and colder solar wind's plasma from the hotter and less dense one within Jupiter's magnetosphere is called the [[magnetopause]].&lt;ref name=Khurana1/&gt; The distance from the magnetopause to the center of the planet is from 45 to 100 ''R''&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt; (where ''R''&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;=71,492&amp;nbsp;km is the radius of Jupiter) at the [[subsolar point]]—the unfixed point on the surface at which the Sun would appear directly overhead to an observer.&lt;ref name=Khurana1/&gt; The position of the magnetopause depends on the pressure exerted by the solar wind, which in turn depends on [[solar wind|solar activity]].&lt;ref name="Russell2001-1016"&gt;[[#Russell2001|Russell]], 2001, pp. 1015–1016&lt;/ref&gt; In front of the magnetopause (at a distance from 80 to 130&amp;nbsp;''R''&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt; from the planet's center) lies the [[bow shock]], a [[wake]]-like disturbance in the solar wind caused by its collision with the magnetosphere.&lt;ref name="Krupp15"&gt;[[#Krupp|Krupp]], 2004, pp.&amp;nbsp;15–16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Russell1993-725"&gt;[[#Russell1993|Russel]], 1993, pp.&amp;nbsp;725–727&lt;/ref&gt; The region between the bow shock and magnetopause is called the [[magnetosheath]].&lt;ref name="Khurana1"/&gt;

[[File:Magnetosphere Levels.svg|thumb|left|An artist's concept of a magnetosphere, where plasmasphere (7) refers to the plasma torus and sheet]]
At the opposite side of the planet, the solar wind stretches Jupiter's magnetic field lines into a long, trailing [[magnetotail]], which sometimes extends well beyond the orbit of [[Saturn]].&lt;ref name="Khurana17"/&gt; The structure of Jupiter's magnetotail is similar to Earth's. It consists of two lobes (blue areas in the figure), with the magnetic field in the southern lobe pointing toward Jupiter, and that in the northern lobe pointing away from it. The lobes are separated by a thin layer of plasma called the tail [[current sheet]] (orange layer in the middle).&lt;ref name="Khurana17"&gt;[[#Khurana|Khurana]], 2004, pp.&amp;nbsp;17–18&lt;/ref&gt; Like Earth's, the Jovian tail is a channel through which solar plasma enters the inner regions of the magnetosphere, where it is heated and forms the [[radiation belt]]s at distances closer than 10&amp;nbsp;''R''&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt; from Jupiter.&lt;ref name="Khurana6"&gt;[[#Khurana|Khurana]], 2004, pp.&amp;nbsp;6–7&lt;/ref&gt;

The shape of Jupiter's magnetosphere described above is sustained by the neutral sheet current (also known as the magnetotail current), which flows with Jupiter's rotation through the tail [[plasma sheet]], the tail currents, which flow against Jupiter's rotation at the outer boundary of the magnetotail, and the magnetopause currents (or Chapman–Ferraro currents), which flow against rotation along the dayside magnetopause.&lt;ref name="Kivelson303"/&gt; These currents create the magnetic field that cancels the internal field outside the magnetosphere.&lt;ref name="Khurana17"/&gt; They also interact substantially with the solar wind.&lt;ref name=Kivelson303&gt;[[#Kivelson|Kivelson]], 2005, pp. 303–313&lt;/ref&gt;

Jupiter's magnetosphere is traditionally divided into three parts: the inner, middle and outer magnetosphere. The inner magnetosphere is located at distances closer than 10&amp;nbsp;''R''&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt; from the planet. The magnetic field within it remains approximately dipole, because contributions from the currents flowing in the magnetospheric equatorial plasma sheet are small. In the middle (between 10 and 40&amp;nbsp;''R''&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;) and outer (further than 40&amp;nbsp;''R''&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;) magnetospheres, the magnetic field is not a dipole, and is seriously disturbed by its interaction with the plasma sheet (see magnetodisk below).&lt;ref name=Khurana1/&gt;

=== Role of Io ===
[[File:iotorus.jpg|thumb|300 px|Io's interaction with Jupiter's magnetosphere. The Io plasma torus is in yellow.]]
Although overall the shape of Jupiter's magnetosphere resembles that of the Earth's, closer to the planet its structure is very different.&lt;ref name=Russell2001-1016/&gt; Jupiter's volcanically active moon [[Io (moon)|Io]] is a strong source of plasma in its own right, and loads Jupiter's magnetosphere with as much as 1,000&amp;nbsp;kg of new material every second.&lt;ref name=Khurana5&gt;[[#Khurana|Khurana]], 2004, pp. 5–7&lt;/ref&gt; Strong volcanic eruptions on Io emit huge amounts of [[sulfur dioxide]], a major part of which is [[dissociation (chemistry)|dissociated]] into atoms and [[ionization|ionized]] by the solar [[ultraviolet radiation]], producing ions of [[sulfur]] and [[oxygen]]: S&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, S&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and O&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=Krupp3&gt;[[#Krupp|Krupp]], 2004, pp. 3–4&lt;/ref&gt;{{Disputed inline|talk=Talk:Magnetosphere of Jupiter #Plasma originating from Io|date=June 2018}} These ions escape from the satellite's atmosphere and form the ''Io plasma torus'': a thick and relatively cool ring of plasma encircling Jupiter, located near Io's orbit.&lt;ref name=Khurana5/&gt; The [[Hot plasma|plasma temperature]] within the torus is 10–100&amp;nbsp;[[electronvolt|eV]] (100,000–1,000,000&amp;nbsp;K), which is much lower than that of the particles in the radiation belts—10&amp;nbsp;keV (100&amp;nbsp;million&amp;nbsp;K). The plasma in the torus is forced into co-rotation with Jupiter, meaning both share the same period of rotation.&lt;ref name=Krupp4/&gt; The Io torus fundamentally alters the dynamics of the Jovian magnetosphere.&lt;ref name=Krupp1&gt;[[#Krupp|Krupp]], 2004, pp. 1–3&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of several processes—[[diffusion]] and [[interchange instability]] being the main escape mechanisms—the plasma slowly leaks away from Jupiter.&lt;ref name=Krupp4&gt;[[#Krupp|Krupp]], 2004, pp. 4–7&lt;/ref&gt; As the plasma moves further from the planet, the radial currents flowing within it gradually increase its velocity, maintaining co-rotation.&lt;ref name=Khurana1/&gt; These radial currents are also the source of the magnetic field's azimuthal component, which as a result bends back against the rotation.&lt;ref name=Khurana13/&gt; The [[particle number density]] of the plasma decreases from around 2,000&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; in the Io torus to about 0.2&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; at a distance of 35&amp;nbsp;''R''&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=Khurana10&gt;[[#Khurana|Khurana]], 2004, pp. 10–12&lt;/ref&gt; In the middle magnetosphere, at distances greater than 20&amp;nbsp;''R''&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt; from Jupiter, co-rotation gradually breaks down and the plasma begins to rotate more slowly than the planet.&lt;ref name=Khurana1/&gt; Eventually at the distances greater than 40&amp;nbsp;''R''&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt; (in the outer magnetosphere) this plasma escapes the magnetic field completely and leaves the magnetosphere through the magnetotail.&lt;ref name=Russell2001-1024&gt;[[#Russell2001|Russell]], 2001, pp. 1024–1025&lt;/ref&gt; As cold, dense plasma moves outward, it is replaced by hot, low-density plasma (temperature 20&amp;nbsp;[[Kiloelectronvolt|keV]] (200&amp;nbsp;million&amp;nbsp;K) or higher) moving from the outer magnetosphere.&lt;ref name=Khurana10/&gt; This plasma, [[adiabatic heating|adiabatically heated]] as it approaches Jupiter,&lt;ref name=Khurana20&gt;[[#Khurana|Khurana]], 2004, pp. 20–21&lt;/ref&gt; forms the radiation belts in Jupiter's inner magnetosphere.&lt;ref name=Khurana5/&gt;

=== Magnetodisk ===
While Earth's magnetic field is roughly teardrop-shaped, Jupiter's is flatter, more closely resembling a disk, and "wobbles" periodically about its axis.&lt;ref name=depths/&gt; The main reasons for this disk-like configuration are the [[centrifugal force]] from the co-rotating plasma and thermal pressure of hot plasma, both of which act to stretch Jupiter's [[magnetic field line]]s, forming a flattened pancake-like structure, known as the magnetodisk, at the distances greater than 20&amp;nbsp;''R''&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt; from the planet.&lt;ref name=Khurana1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Russell2001-1021&gt;[[#Russell2001|Russell]], 2001, pp. 1021–1024&lt;/ref&gt; The magnetodisk has a thin current sheet at the middle plane,&lt;ref name=Krupp3/&gt; approximately near the [[magnetic equator]]. The magnetic field lines point away from Jupiter above the sheet and towards Jupiter below it.&lt;ref name=Russell2001-1016/&gt; The load of plasma from Io greatly expands the size of the Jovian magnetosphere, because the magnetodisk creates an additional internal pressure which balances the pressure of the solar wind.&lt;ref name=Krupp15/&gt; In the absence of Io the distance from the planet to the magnetopause at the subsolar point would be no more than 42&amp;nbsp;''R''&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;, whereas it is actually 75&amp;nbsp;''R''&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt; on average.&lt;ref name=Khurana1/&gt;

The configuration of the magnetodisk's field is maintained by the azimuthal [[ring current]] (not an analog of Earth's ring current), which flows with rotation through the equatorial plasma sheet.&lt;ref name=Kivelson315&gt;[[#Kivelson|Kivelson]], 2005, pp. 315–316&lt;/ref&gt; The Lorentz force resulting from the interaction of this current with the planetary magnetic field creates a [[centripetal force]], which keeps the co-rotating plasma from escaping the planet. The total ring current in the equatorial current sheet is estimated at 90–160&amp;nbsp;million [[ampere]]s.&lt;ref name=Khurana1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Khurana13&gt;[[#Khurana|Khurana]], 2004, pp. 13–16&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dynamics ==

=== Co-rotation and radial currents ===
[[File:Currents in Jovian Magnetosphere.png|thumb|300px|The magnetic field of Jupiter and co-rotation enforcing currents]]
The main driver of Jupiter's magnetosphere is the planet's rotation.&lt;ref name=Blanc250&gt;[[#Blanc|Blanc]], 2005, pp. 250–253&lt;/ref&gt; In this respect Jupiter is similar to a device called a [[Unipolar generator]]. When Jupiter rotates, its ionosphere moves relatively to the dipole magnetic field of the planet. Because the dipole magnetic moment points in the direction of the rotation,&lt;ref name=Kivelson303/&gt; the [[Lorentz force]], which appears as a result of this motion, drives negatively charged electrons to the poles, while positively charged ions are pushed towards the equator.&lt;ref name=Cowley1069&gt;[[#Cowley|Cowley]], 2001, pp. 1069–76&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the poles become negatively charged and the regions closer to the equator become positively charged. Since the magnetosphere of Jupiter is filled with highly conductive plasma, the [[electrical circuit]] is closed through it.&lt;ref name=Cowley1069/&gt; A current called the direct current{{refn|The direct current in the Jovian magnetosphere is not to be confused with the [[direct current]] used in electrical circuits. The latter is the opposite of the [[alternating current]].|group=note}} flows along the magnetic field lines from the ionosphere to the equatorial plasma sheet. This current then flows radially away from the planet within the equatorial plasma sheet and finally returns to the planetary ionosphere from the outer reaches of the magnetosphere along the field lines connected to the poles. The currents that flow along the magnetic field lines are generally called field-aligned or [[Birkeland current]]s.&lt;ref name=Khurana13/&gt; The radial current interacts with the planetary magnetic field, and the resulting Lorentz force accelerates the magnetospheric plasma in the direction of planetary rotation. This is the main mechanism that maintains co-rotation of the plasma in Jupiter's magnetosphere.&lt;ref name=Cowley1069/&gt;

The current flowing from the ionosphere to the plasma sheet is especially strong when the corresponding part of the plasma sheet rotates slower than the planet.&lt;ref name="Cowley1069" /&gt; As mentioned above, co-rotation breaks down in the region located between 20 and 40&amp;nbsp;''R''&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt; from Jupiter. This region corresponds to the magnetodisk, where the magnetic field is highly stretched.&lt;ref name=Blanc254&gt;[[#Blanc|Blanc]], 2005, pp. 254–261&lt;/ref&gt; The strong direct current flowing into the magnetodisk originates in a very limited latitudinal range of about {{nowrap|16 ± 1}}° from the Jovian magnetic poles. These narrow circular regions correspond to Jupiter's main [[Aurora (astronomy)|auroral ovals]]. (See below.)&lt;ref name=Cowley1083&gt;[[#Cowley|Cowley]], 2001, pp. 1083–87&lt;/ref&gt; The return current flowing from the outer magnetosphere beyond 50&amp;nbsp;''R''&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt; enters the Jovian ionosphere near the poles, closing the electrical circuit. The total radial current in the Jovian magnetosphere is estimated at 60 million–140&amp;nbsp;million amperes.&lt;ref name=Khurana13/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cowley1069/&gt;

The acceleration of the plasma into the co-rotation leads to the transfer of energy from the Jovian rotation to the [[kinetic energy]] of the plasma.&lt;ref name=Khurana1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Krupp1/&gt; In that sense, the Jovian magnetosphere is powered by the planet's rotation, whereas the Earth's magnetosphere is powered mainly by the solar wind.&lt;ref name=Krupp1/&gt;

=== Interchange instability and reconnection ===
The main problem encountered in deciphering the dynamics of the Jovian magnetosphere is the transport of heavy cold plasma from the Io torus at 6&amp;nbsp;''R''&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt; to the outer magnetosphere at distances of more than 50&amp;nbsp;''R''&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=Blanc254/&gt; The precise mechanism of this process is not known, but it is hypothesized to occur as a result of plasma diffusion due to interchange instability. The process is similar to the [[Rayleigh-Taylor instability]] in [[hydrodynamics]].&lt;ref name=Krupp4/&gt; In the case of the Jovian magnetosphere, [[centrifugal force]] plays the role of gravity; the heavy liquid is the cold and dense Ionian (i.e. pertaining to [[Io (moon)|Io]]) plasma, and the light liquid is the hot, much less dense plasma from the outer magnetosphere.&lt;ref name=Krupp4/&gt; The instability leads to an exchange between the outer and inner parts of the magnetosphere of [[flux tube]]s filled with plasma. The buoyant empty flux tubes move towards the planet, while pushing the heavy tubes, filled with the Ionian plasma, away from Jupiter.&lt;ref name=Krupp4/&gt; This interchange of flux tubes is a form of magnetospheric [[turbulence]].&lt;ref name=Russell2008&gt;[[#Russell2008|Russell]], 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Jovian magnetosphere (view from the north pole).png|thumb|left|The magnetosphere of Jupiter as viewed from above the north pole&lt;ref name=Krupp2007-216/&gt;]]
This highly hypothetical picture of the flux tube exchange was partly confirmed by the [[Galileo spacecraft]], which detected regions of sharply reduced plasma density and increased field strength in the inner magnetosphere.&lt;ref name=Krupp4/&gt; These voids may correspond to the almost empty flux tubes arriving from the outer magnetosphere. In the middle magnetosphere, Galileo detected so-called injection events, which occur when hot plasma from the outer magnetosphere impacts the magnetodisk, leading to increased flux of energetic particles and a strengthened magnetic field.&lt;ref name=Krupp7&gt;[[#Krupp|Krupp]], 2004, pp. 7–9&lt;/ref&gt; No mechanism is yet known to explain the transport of cold plasma outward.

When flux tubes loaded with the cold Ionian plasma reach the outer magnetosphere, they go through a [[reconnection]] process, which separates the magnetic field from the plasma.&lt;ref name=Blanc254/&gt; The former returns to the inner magnetosphere in the form of flux tubes filled with hot and less dense plasma, while the latter are probably ejected down the magnetotail in the form of [[plasmoid]]s—large blobs of plasma. The reconnection processes may correspond to the global reconfiguration events also observed by the Galileo spacecraft, which occurred regularly every 2–3 days.&lt;ref name=Krupp11/&gt; The reconfiguration events usually included rapid and chaotic variation of the magnetic field strength and direction, as well as abrupt changes in the motion of the plasma, which often stopped co-rotating and began flowing outward. They were mainly observed in the dawn sector of the night magnetosphere.&lt;ref name=Krupp11&gt;[[#Krupp|Krupp]], 2004, pp. 11–14&lt;/ref&gt; The plasma flowing down the tail along the open field lines is called the planetary wind.&lt;ref name=Krupp3/&gt;&lt;ref name=Khurana18&gt;[[#Khurana|Khurana]], 2004, pp. 18–19&lt;/ref&gt;

The reconnection events are analogues to the [[Magnetosphere#Magnetic substorms and storms|magnetic substorm]]s in the Earth's magnetosphere.&lt;ref name=Blanc254/&gt; The difference seems to be their respective energy sources: terrestrial substorms involve storage of the solar wind's energy in the magnetotail followed by its release through a reconnection event in the tail's neutral current sheet. The latter also creates a plasmoid which moves down the tail.&lt;ref name=Russell2001-1011&gt;[[#Russell2001|Russell]], 2001, p. 1011&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, in Jupiter's magnetosphere the rotational energy is stored in the magnetodisk and released when a plasmoid separates from it.&lt;ref name=Krupp11/&gt;

=== Influence of the solar wind ===
[[File:Jovian magnetosphere vs solar wind.svg|thumb|300px|Interactions between solar wind and Jovian magnetosphere]]
Whereas the dynamics of Jovian magnetosphere mainly depend on internal sources of energy, the solar wind probably has a role as well,&lt;ref name=Nichols&gt;[[#Nichols|Nichols]], 2006, pp. 393–394&lt;/ref&gt; particularly as a source of high-energy [[proton]]s.{{refn|The Jovian [[ionosphere]] is another significant source of protons.&lt;ref name=Khurana5/&gt;|group=note}}&lt;ref name=Khurana5/&gt; The structure of the outer magnetosphere shows some features of a solar wind-driven magnetosphere, including a significant dawn–dusk asymmetry.&lt;ref name=Khurana13/&gt; In particular, magnetic field lines in the dusk sector are bent in the opposite direction to those in the dawn sector.&lt;ref name=Khurana13/&gt; In addition, the dawn magnetosphere contains open field lines connecting to the magnetotail, whereas in the dusk magnetosphere, the field lines are closed.&lt;ref name=Khurana17/&gt; All these observations indicate that a solar wind driven reconnection process, known on Earth as the [[Dungey cycle]], may also be taking place in the Jovian magnetosphere.&lt;ref name=Blanc254/&gt;&lt;ref name=Nichols/&gt;

The extent of the solar wind's influence on the dynamics of Jupiter's magnetosphere is currently unknown;&lt;ref name=Krupp18&gt;[[#Krupp|Krupp]], 2004, pp. 18–19&lt;/ref&gt; however, it could be especially strong at times of elevated solar activity.&lt;ref name=Nichols404&gt;[[#Nichols|Nichols]], 2006, pp. 404–405&lt;/ref&gt; The auroral radio,&lt;ref name=Zarka375/&gt; optical and X-ray emissions,&lt;ref name=Elsner/&gt; as well as [[synchrotron]] emissions from the radiation belts all show correlations with solar wind pressure, indicating that the solar wind may drive plasma circulation or modulate internal processes in the magnetosphere.&lt;ref name=Krupp11/&gt;

=== Aurorae ===
[[File:Jupiter.Aurora.HST.mod.svg|thumb|400 px|Image of Jupiter's northern aurorae, showing the main auroral oval, the polar emissions, and the spots generated by the interaction with Jupiter's natural satellites]]
Jupiter demonstrates bright, persistent aurorae around both poles. Unlike Earth's aurorae, which are transient and only occur at times of heightened solar activity, Jupiter's aurorae are permanent, though their intensity varies from day to day. They consist of three main components: the main ovals, which are bright, narrow (less than 1000&amp;nbsp;km in width) circular features located at approximately 16° from the magnetic poles;&lt;ref name=Palier1171/&gt; the satellites' auroral spots, which correspond to the footprints of the magnetic field lines connecting Jupiter's ionosphere with those of its largest moons, and transient polar emissions situated within the main ovals.&lt;ref name=Palier1171&gt;[[#Palier|Palier]], 2001, pp. 1171–73&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bhardwaj311&gt;[[#Bhardwaj|Bhardwaj]], 2000, pp. 311–316&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas the auroral emissions were detected in almost all parts of the electromagnetic spectrum from radio waves to X-rays (up to 3&amp;nbsp;keV), they are brightest in the mid-infrared (wavelength 3–4&amp;nbsp;μm and 7–14&amp;nbsp;μm) and deep ultraviolet spectral regions (wavelength 80–180&amp;nbsp;nm).&lt;ref name=Bhardwaj342&gt;[[#Bhardwaj|Bhardwaj]], 2000, p. 342&lt;/ref&gt;

Spots were found to correspond to three Galilean moons: Io, [[Europa (moon)|Europa]] and [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]].{{refn|Callisto may have a spot as well; however, it would be unobservable because it would coincide with the main auroral oval.&lt;ref name=Clarke/&gt;|group=note}}&lt;ref name=Clarke&gt;[[#Clarke|Clarke]], 2002&lt;/ref&gt; They develop because the co-rotation of the plasma is slowed in the vicinity of moons. The brightest spot belongs to Io, which is the main source of the plasma in the magnetosphere (see above). The Ionian auroral spot is thought to be related to [[Alfvén waves|Alfvén current]]s flowing from the Jovian to Ionian ionosphere. Europa's and Ganymede's spots are much dimmer, because these moons are weak plasma sources, because of sublimation of the water ice from their surfaces.&lt;ref name=Blanc277&gt;[[#Blanc|Blanc]], 2005, pp. 277–283&lt;/ref&gt;

Bright arcs and spots sporadically appear within the main ovals. These transient phenomena are thought to be related to interaction with the solar wind.&lt;ref name=Bhardwaj311/&gt; The magnetic field lines in this region are believed to be open or to map onto the magnetotail.&lt;ref name=Bhardwaj311/&gt; The secondary ovals observed inside the main oval may be related to the boundary between open and closed magnetic field lines or to the polar [[Aurora (astronomy)#Solar wind and the magnetosphere|cusp]]s.&lt;ref name=Palier1170&gt;[[#Palier|Palier]], 2001, pp. 1170–71&lt;/ref&gt; The polar auroral emissions are similar to those observed around Earth's poles: both appear when electrons are accelerated towards the planet by potential drops, during reconnection of solar magnetic field with that of the planet.&lt;ref name=Blanc254/&gt; The regions within both main ovals emit most of auroral X-rays. The spectrum of the auroral X-ray radiation consists of [[spectral line]]s of highly ionized oxygen and sulfur, which probably appear when energetic (hundreds of kiloelectronvolts) S and O ions precipitate into the polar atmosphere of Jupiter. The source of this precipitation remains unknown.&lt;ref name=Elsner&gt;[[#Elsner|Elsner]], 2005, pp. 419–420&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Jupiter at radio wavelengths ===
Jupiter is a powerful source of [[radio wave]]s in the spectral region stretching from several [[kilohertz]] to tens of [[megahertz]]. Radio waves with [[radio frequency|frequencies]] of less than about 0.3&amp;nbsp;MHz (and thus wavelengths longer than 1&amp;nbsp;km) are called the Jovian [[kilometer|kilometric]] radiation or KOM. Those with frequencies in the interval of 0.3–3&amp;nbsp;MHz (with wavelengths of 100–1000&amp;nbsp;m) are called the [[hectometer|hectometric]] radiation or HOM, while emissions in the range 3–40&amp;nbsp;MHz (with wavelengths of 10–100&amp;nbsp;m) are referred to as the [[decameter|decametric]] radiation or DAM. The latter radiation was the first to be observed from Earth, and its approximately 10-hour periodicity helped to identify it as originating from Jupiter. The strongest part of decametric emission, which is related to Io and to the Io–Jupiter current system, is called Io-DAM.&lt;ref name=Zarka20160&gt;[[#Zarka|Zarka]], 1998, pp. 20,160–168&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|The non-Io-DAM is much weaker than the Io-DAM, and is the high-frequency tail of the HOM emissions.&lt;ref name=Zarka20160/&gt;|group=note}}
[[File:Radio emissions of Solar System planets.png|thumb|left|300px|The spectrum of Jovian radio emissions compared with spectra of four other magnetized planets, where (N,T,S,U)KR means (Neptunian, Terrestrial, Saturnian and Uranian) kilometric radiation]]
The majority of these emissions are thought to be produced by a mechanism called Cyclotron Maser Instability, which develops close to the auroral regions, when electrons bounce back and forth between the poles. The electrons involved in the generation of radio waves are probably those carrying currents from the poles of the planet to the magnetodisk.&lt;ref name=Zarka20173&gt;[[#Zarka|Zarka]], 1998, pp. 20, 173–181&lt;/ref&gt; The intensity of Jovian radio emissions usually varies smoothly with time; however, Jupiter periodically emits short and powerful bursts (S bursts), which can outshine all other components. The total emitted power of the DAM component is about 100&amp;nbsp;GW, while the power of all other HOM/KOM components is about 10&amp;nbsp;GW. In comparison, the total power of Earth's radio emissions is about 0.1&amp;nbsp;GW.&lt;ref name=Zarka20160/&gt;

Jupiter's radio and particle emissions are strongly modulated by its rotation, which makes the planet somewhat similar to a [[pulsar]].&lt;ref name=Hill&gt;[[#Hill|Hill]], 1995&lt;/ref&gt; This periodical modulation is probably related to asymmetries in the Jovian magnetosphere, which are caused by the tilt of the magnetic moment with respect to the rotational axis as well as by high-latitude [[magnetic anomaly|magnetic anomalies]]. The physics governing Jupiter's radio emissions is similar to that of radio pulsars. They differ only in the scale, and Jupiter can be considered a very small [[radio pulsar]] too.&lt;ref name=Hill/&gt; In addition, Jupiter's radio emissions strongly depend on solar wind pressure and, hence, on [[solar variation|solar activity]].&lt;ref name=Zarka20160/&gt;

In addition to relatively long-wavelength radiation, Jupiter also emits [[synchrotron radiation]] (also known as the Jovian [[decimeter|decimetric]] radiation or DIM radiation) with frequencies in the range of 0.1–15&amp;nbsp;GHz (wavelength from 3&amp;nbsp;m to 2&amp;nbsp;cm),&lt;ref name=Zarka/&gt; which is the [[bremsstrahlung radiation]] of the relativistic electrons trapped in the inner radiation belts of the planet. The energy of the electrons that contribute to the DIM emissions is from 0.1 to 100&amp;nbsp;MeV,&lt;ref name=Santos-Costa&gt;[[#Santos-Costa|Santos-Costa]], 2001&lt;/ref&gt; while the leading contribution comes from the electrons with energy in the range 1–20&amp;nbsp;MeV.&lt;ref name=Bolton&gt;[[#Bolton|Bolton]], 2002&lt;/ref&gt; This radiation is well understood and was used since the beginning of the 1960s to study the structure of the planet's magnetic field and radiation belts.&lt;ref name=Zarka384&gt;[[#Zarka2|Zarka]], 2005, pp. 384–385&lt;/ref&gt; The particles in the radiation belts originate in the outer magnetosphere and are adiabatically accelerated, when they are transported to the inner magnetosphere.&lt;ref name=Khurana20/&gt;

Jupiter's magnetosphere ejects streams of high-energy electrons and ions (energy up to tens [[megaelectronvolt]]s), which travel as far as Earth's orbit.&lt;ref name=Krupp17&gt;[[#Krupp|Krupp]], 2004, pp. 17–18&lt;/ref&gt; These streams are highly [[collimated]] and vary with the rotational period of the planet like the radio emissions. In this respect as well, Jupiter shows similarity to a pulsar.&lt;ref name=Hill/&gt;

== Interaction with rings and moons ==
{{See also|Rings of Jupiter|Ganymedian magnetosphere|Space weathering}}
Jupiter's extensive magnetosphere envelops its ring system and the orbits of all four [[Galilean satellites]].&lt;ref name=Kivelson2-2/&gt; Orbiting near the magnetic equator, these bodies serve as sources and sinks of magnetospheric plasma, while energetic particles from the magnetosphere alter their surfaces. The particles [[sputtering|sputter]] off material from the surfaces and create chemical changes via [[radiolysis]].&lt;ref name=Johnson-1&gt;[[#Johnson|Johnson]], 2004, pp. 1–2&lt;/ref&gt; The plasma's co-rotation with the planet means that the plasma preferably interacts with the moons' trailing hemispheres, causing noticeable hemispheric asymmetries.&lt;ref name=Johnson-3&gt;[[#Johnson|Johnson]], 2004, pp. 3–5&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the large internal magnetic fields of the moons contribute to the Jovian magnetic field.&lt;ref name=Kivelson2-2/&gt;
[[File:Jupiter radio.jpg|thumb|Jupiter's variable radiation belts]]
Close to Jupiter, the planet's rings and small moons absorb high-energy particles (energy above 10&amp;nbsp;keV) from the radiation belts.&lt;ref name=Burns1/&gt; This creates noticeable gaps in the belts' spatial distribution and affects the decimetric synchrotron radiation. In fact, the existence of Jupiter's rings was first hypothesized on the basis of data from the ''[[Pioneer 11]]'' spacecraft, which detected a sharp drop in the number of high-energy ions close to the planet.&lt;ref name=Burns1&gt;[[#Burns|Burns]], 2004, pp. 1–2&lt;/ref&gt; The planetary magnetic field strongly influences the motion of sub-micrometer ring particles as well, which acquire an electrical charge under the influence of solar [[ultraviolet radiation]]. Their behavior is similar to that of co-rotating [[ion]]s.&lt;ref name=Burns12&gt;[[#Burns|Burns]], 2004, pp. 12–14&lt;/ref&gt; The resonant interaction between the co-rotation and the orbital motion is thought to be responsible for the creation of Jupiter's innermost halo ring (located between 1.4 and 1.71&amp;nbsp;''R''&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;), which consists of sub-micrometer particles on highly [[Inclination|inclined]] and [[Orbital eccentricity|eccentric]] orbits.&lt;ref name=Burns10&gt;[[#Burns|Burns]], 2004, pp. 10–11&lt;/ref&gt; The particles originate in the main ring; however, when they drift toward Jupiter, their orbits are modified by the strong 3:2 Lorentz resonance located at 1.71&amp;nbsp;''R''&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;, which increases their inclinations and eccentricities.{{refn|A Lorentz resonance is one that exists between a particle's orbital speed and the rotation period of a planet's magnetosphere. If the ratio of their angular frequencies is ''m'':''n'' (a [[rational number]]) then scientists call it an ''m'':''n'' Lorentz resonance. So, in the case of a 3:2 resonance, a particle at a distance of about 1.71&amp;nbsp;''R''&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt; from Jupiter makes three revolutions around the planet, while the planet's magnetic field makes two revolutions.&lt;ref name=Burns17/&gt;|group=note}} Another 2:1 Lorentz resonance at 1.4&amp;nbsp;Rj defines the inner boundary of the halo ring.&lt;ref name=Burns17&gt;[[#Burns|Burns]], 2004, pp. 17–19&lt;/ref&gt;

All Galilean moons have thin atmospheres with surface pressures in the range 0.01–1&amp;nbsp;[[bar (unit)|nbar]], which in turn support substantial [[ionosphere]]s with electron densities in the range of 1,000–10,000&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=Kivelson2-2&gt;[[#Kivelson2|Kivelson]], 2004, pp. 2–4&lt;/ref&gt; The co-rotational flow of cold magnetospheric plasma is partially diverted around them by the currents induced in their ionospheres, creating wedge-shaped structures known as Alfvén wings.&lt;ref name=Kivelson2-8&gt;[[#Kivelson2|Kivelson]], 2004, pp. 8–10&lt;/ref&gt; The interaction of the large moons with the co-rotational flow is similar to the interaction of the [[solar wind]] with the non-magnetized planets like [[Venus]], although the co-rotational speed is usually [[Speed of sound|subsonic]] (the speeds vary from 74 to 328&amp;nbsp;km/s), which prevents the formation of a [[bow shock]].&lt;ref name=Kivelson2-1&gt;[[#Kivelson2|Kivelson]], 2004, pp. 1–2&lt;/ref&gt; The pressure from the co-rotating plasma continuously strips gases from the moons' atmospheres (especially from that of Io), and some of these atoms are ionized and brought into co-rotation. This process creates gas and plasma tori in the vicinity of moons' orbits with the Ionian torus being the most prominent.&lt;ref name="Kivelson2-2" /&gt; In effect, the Galilean moons (mainly Io) serve as the principal plasma sources in Jupiter's inner and middle magnetosphere. Meanwhile, the energetic particles are largely unaffected by the Alfvén wings and have free access to the moons' surfaces (except Ganymede's).&lt;ref name=Cooper137&gt;[[#Cooper|Cooper]], 2001, pp. 137,139&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:PIA04433 Jupiter Torus Diagram cr.jpg|thumb|left|Plasma tori created by Io and Europa]]
The icy Galilean moons, [[Europa (moon)|Europa]], [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]] and [[Callisto (moon)|Callisto]], all generate induced magnetic moments in response to changes in Jupiter's magnetic field. These varying magnetic moments create dipole magnetic fields around them, which act to compensate for changes in the ambient field.&lt;ref name=Kivelson2-2/&gt; The induction is thought to take place in subsurface layers of salty water, which are likely to exist in all of Jupiter's large icy moons. These underground oceans can potentially harbor life, and evidence for their presence was one of the most important discoveries made in the 1990s by [[Galileo (spacecraft)|spacecraft]].&lt;ref name=Kivelson2-10&gt;[[#Kivelson2|Kivelson]], 2004, pp. 10–11&lt;/ref&gt;

The interaction of the Jovian magnetosphere with Ganymede, which has an intrinsic magnetic moment, differs from its interaction with the non-magnetized moons.&lt;ref name=Kivelson2-10/&gt; Ganymede's internal magnetic field carves a cavity inside Jupiter's magnetosphere with a diameter of approximately two Ganymede diameters, creating a mini-magnetosphere within Jupiter's magnetosphere. Ganymede's magnetic field diverts the co-rotating plasma flow around its magnetosphere. It also protects the moon's equatorial regions, where the field lines are closed, from energetic particles. The latter can still freely strike Ganymede's poles, where the field lines are open.&lt;ref name=Kivelson2-16&gt;[[#Kivelson2|Kivelson]], 2004, pp. 16–18&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the energetic particles are trapped near the equator of Ganymede, creating mini-radiation belts.&lt;ref name=Williams1&gt;[[#Williams|Williams]], 1998, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Energetic electrons entering its thin atmosphere are responsible for the observed Ganymedian polar aurorae.&lt;ref name=Kivelson2-16/&gt;

Charged particles have a considerable influence on the surface properties of Galilean moons. Plasma originating from Io carries sulfur and [[sodium]] ions farther from the planet,&lt;ref name=Cooper154&gt;[[#Cooper|Cooper]], 2001, pp. 154–156&lt;/ref&gt; where they are implanted preferentially on the trailing hemispheres of Europa and Ganymede.&lt;ref name=Johnson-15&gt;[[#Johnson|Johnson]], 2004, pp. 15–19&lt;/ref&gt; On Callisto however, for unknown reasons, sulfur is concentrated on the leading hemisphere.&lt;ref name=Hibbitts&gt;[[#Hibbitts|Hibbitts]], 2000, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Plasma may also be responsible for darkening the moons' trailing hemispheres (again, except Callisto's).&lt;ref name=Johnson-3/&gt; Energetic electrons and ions, with the flux of the latter being more isotropic, bombard surface ice, sputtering atoms and molecules off and causing [[radiolysis]] of water and other [[chemical compound]]s. The energetic particles break water into [[oxygen]] and [[hydrogen]], maintaining the thin oxygen atmospheres of the icy moons (since the hydrogen escapes more rapidly). The compounds produced radiolytically on the surfaces of Galilean moons also include [[ozone]] and [[hydrogen peroxide]].&lt;ref name=Johnson-8/&gt; If organics or [[carbonate]]s are present, [[carbon dioxide]], [[methanol]] and [[carbonic acid]] can be produced as well. In the presence of sulfur, likely products include sulfur dioxide, [[hydrogen disulfide]] and [[sulfuric acid]].&lt;ref name=Johnson-8&gt;[[#Johnson|Johnson]], 2004, pp. 8–13&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oxidant]]s produced by radiolysis, like oxygen and ozone, may be trapped inside the ice and carried downward to the oceans over geologic time intervals, thus serving as a possible energy source for life.&lt;ref name="Cooper154" /&gt;

== Discovery ==
[[File:Pioneer 10 at Jupiter.jpg|thumb|Pioneer 10 provided the first ''in situ'' and definitive discovery of the Jovian magnetosphere]]

The first evidence for the existence of Jupiter's magnetic field came in 1955, with the discovery of the [[decameter|decametric]] radio emission or DAM.&lt;ref name=Burke&gt;[[#Burke|Burke]], 1955&lt;/ref&gt; As the DAM's spectrum extended up to 40&amp;nbsp;[[Hertz|MHz]], astronomers concluded that Jupiter must possess a magnetic field with a strength of about 1&amp;nbsp;milli[[tesla (unit)|tesla]]s (10&amp;nbsp;[[Gauss (unit)|gauss]]).&lt;ref name=Zarka&gt;[[#Zarka2|Zarka]], 2005, pp. 371–375&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1959, observations in the [[microwave]] part of the electromagnetic (EM) spectrum (0.1–10&amp;nbsp;[[Hertz|GHz]]) led to the discovery of the Jovian [[decimeter|decimetric]] radiation (DIM) and the realization that it was [[synchrotron radiation]] emitted by [[Relativistic electron beam|relativistic electrons]] trapped in the planet's radiation belts.&lt;ref name=Drake&gt;[[#Drake|Drake]], 1959&lt;/ref&gt; These synchrotron emissions were used to estimate the number and energy of the electrons around Jupiter and led to improved estimates of the magnetic moment and its tilt.&lt;ref name=Khurana5/&gt;

By 1973 the magnetic moment was known within a factor of two, whereas the tilt was correctly estimated at about 10°.&lt;ref name=Russell1993-715/&gt; The modulation of Jupiter's DAM by [[Io (moon)|Io]] (the so-called Io-DAM) was discovered in 1964, and allowed Jupiter's [[rotation period]] to be precisely determined.&lt;ref name=Zarka375&gt;[[#Zarka2|Zarka]], 2005, pp. 375–377&lt;/ref&gt; The definitive discovery of the Jovian magnetic field occurred in December 1973, when the [[Pioneer 10]] spacecraft flew near the planet.&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;[[#Smith|Smith]], 1974&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Pioneer 10 carried a helium vector [[magnetometer]], which measured the magnetic field of Jupiter directly.

[[File:Ulysses at Jupiter.jpg|thumb|The path of the Ulysses spacecraft through the magnetosphere of Jupiter in 1992]]
[[File:Galileo - MAD photo - mag1.jpg|thumb|Galileo orbiter's magnetometer instrument]]
As of 2009 a total of eight spacecraft have flown around Jupiter and all have contributed to the present knowledge of the Jovian magnetosphere. The first space probe to reach Jupiter was [[Pioneer 10]] in December 1973, which passed within 2.9&amp;nbsp;''R''&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;ref name=Russell1993-715/&gt; from the center of the planet.&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt; Its twin [[Pioneer 11]] visited Jupiter a year later, traveling along a highly inclined trajectory and approaching the planet as close as 1.6&amp;nbsp;''R''&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=Russell1993-715/&gt;

Pioneer 10 provided the best coverage available of the inner magnetic field&lt;ref name=Khurana1/&gt; as it passed through the inner radiation belts within 20&amp;nbsp;''R''&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;, receiving an integrated dose of 200,000 [[Rad (unit)|rads]] from [[electrons]] and 56,000 rads from [[protons]] (for a human, a whole body dose of 500 rads would be fatal).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first= Garry |last= Hunt et al |year= 1981 |title= Jupiter|edition= 1st |publisher= Rand McNally |location= London |isbn= 0-528-81542-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The level of radiation at Jupiter was ten times more powerful than ''Pioneer'''s designers had predicted, leading to fears that the probe would not survive; however, with a few minor glitches, it managed to pass through the radiation belts, saved in large part by the fact that Jupiter's magnetosphere had "wobbled" slightly upward at that point, moving away from the spacecraft. However, Pioneer 11 did lose most images of Io, as the radiation had caused its imaging photo [[polarimeter]] to receive a number of spurious commands. The subsequent and far more technologically advanced ''[[Voyager program|Voyager]]'' spacecraft had to be redesigned to cope with the massive radiation levels.&lt;ref name=depths&gt;[[#Wolverton|Wolverton]], 2004, pp. 100–157&lt;/ref&gt;

Voyagers 1 and 2 arrived at Jupiter in 1979–1980 and traveled almost in its equatorial plane. [[Voyager 1]], which passed within 5&amp;nbsp;''R''&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt; from the planet's center,&lt;ref name=Russell1993-715/&gt; was first to encounter the Io plasma torus.&lt;ref name=Khurana1/&gt; It received a radiation dosage one thousand times the lethal level for humans, the damage resulting in serious degradation of some high-resolution images of Io and Ganymede.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first= Andrew |last= Wilson |year= 1987 |title= Solar System Log |edition= 1st |publisher= Jane's Publishing Company Limited |location= London |isbn= 0-7106-0444-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Voyager 2]] passed within 10&amp;nbsp;''R''&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;ref name=Russell1993-715/&gt; and discovered the current sheet in the equatorial plane. The next probe to approach Jupiter was [[Ulysses (spacecraft)|Ulysses]] in 1992, which investigated the planet's polar magnetosphere.&lt;ref name=Khurana1/&gt;

The [[Galileo (spacecraft)|Galileo spacecraft]], which orbited Jupiter from 1995 to 2003, provided a comprehensive coverage of Jupiter's magnetic field near the equatorial plane at distances up to 100&amp;nbsp;''R''&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;. The regions studied included the magnetotail and the dawn and dusk sectors of the magnetosphere.&lt;ref name=Khurana1/&gt; While Galileo successfully survived in the harsh radiation environment of Jupiter, it still experienced a few technical problems. In particular, the spacecraft's [[gyroscope]]s often exhibited increased errors. Several times [[electrical arc]]s occurred between rotating and non-rotating parts of the spacecraft, causing it to enter [[Safe mode (spacecraft)|safe mode]], which led to total loss of the data from the 16th, 18th and 33rd orbits. The radiation also caused phase shifts in Galileo's ultra-stable [[quartz oscillator]].&lt;ref name=Fieseler&gt;[[#Fieseler|Fieseler]], 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

When the [[Cassini (spacecraft)|Cassini]] spacecraft flew by Jupiter in 2000, it conducted coordinated measurements with Galileo.&lt;ref name=Khurana1/&gt; [[New Horizons]] passed close to Jupiter in 2007, carrying out a unique investigation of the Jovian magnetotail, traveling as far as 2500&amp;nbsp;''R''&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt; along its length.&lt;ref name=Krupp2007-216&gt;[[#Krupp2007|Krupp]], 2007, p. 216&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2016 [[Juno (spacecraft)|Juno]] was inserted into Jupiter orbit, its scientific objectives include exploration of Jupiter's polar magnetosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://juno.wisc.edu/science.html |title=Juno Science Objectives |accessdate=October 13, 2008 |publisher=[[University of Wisconsin-Madison]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081016083427/http://juno.wisc.edu/science.html |archivedate=October 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The coverage of Jupiter's magnetosphere remains much poorer than for Earth's magnetic field. Further study is important to further understand the Jovian magnetosphere's dynamics.&lt;ref name=Khurana1/&gt;

In 2003, [[NASA]] conducted a conceptual study called "Human Outer Planets Exploration" (HOPE) regarding the future human exploration of the [[outer solar system]]. The possibility was mooted of building a surface base on Callisto, because of the low radiation levels at the moon's distance from Jupiter and its geological stability. Callisto is the only one of Jupiter's Galilean satellites for which human exploration is feasible. The levels of [[ionizing radiation]] on Io, Europa and Ganymede are inimical to human life, and adequate protective measures have yet to be devised.&lt;ref name=Trautman&gt;[[#Troutman|Troutman]], 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

The  [[Jovian Auroral Distributions Experiment]] (JIRAM) instrument should also help to understand the magnetosphere.&lt;ref name="jhuapl.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jhuapl.edu/newscenter/pressreleases/2016/160629.asp|title=NASA's Juno and JEDI: Ready to Unlock Mysteries of Jupiter|date=June 29, 2016|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory|access-date=February 7, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170324122251/http://www.jhuapl.edu/newscenter/pressreleases/2016/160629.asp|archive-date=March 24, 2017|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|A primary objective of the Juno mission is to explore the polar magnetosphere of Jupiter. While Ulysses briefly attained latitudes of ~48 degrees, this was at relatively large distances from Jupiter (~8.6 RJ). Hence, the polar magnetosphere of Jupiter is largely uncharted territory and, in particular, the auroral acceleration region has never been visited. ...|''A Wave Investigation for the Juno Mission to Jupiter''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=	Kurth, W.

''Juno'' revealed a planetary magnetic field rich in spatial variation, possibly due to a relatively large dynamo radius. The most surprising observation until late 2017 was the absence of the expected magnetic signature of intense field aligned currents ([[Birkeland currents]]) associated with the main aurora.&lt;ref&gt;"Jupiter's Magnetosphere and Aurorae Observed by the Juno Spacecraft During its First Polar Orbits."

'''Memory disambiguation''' is a set of techniques employed by high-performance [[out-of-order execution]] [[microprocessor]]s that execute [[primary storage|memory]] access [[instruction (computer science)|instructions]] (loads and stores) out of program order.  The mechanisms for performing memory disambiguation, implemented using [[digital circuit|digital logic]] inside the microprocessor core, detect true dependencies between memory operations at execution time and allow the processor to recover when a dependence has been violated.  They also eliminate spurious memory dependencies and allow for greater [[instruction-level parallelism]] by allowing safe out-of-order execution of loads and stores.

When attempting to execute instructions out of order, a microprocessor must respect [[Dependence analysis#Flow(True) dependence|true dependencies]] between [[instruction (computer science)|instructions]].  For example, consider a simple true dependence:
 1: add $1, $2, $3      # R1 &lt;= R2 + R3
 2: add $5, $1, $4      # R5 &lt;= R1 + R4 (dependent on 1)
In this example, the &lt;code&gt;add&lt;/code&gt; instruction on line 2 is dependent on the &lt;code&gt;add&lt;/code&gt; instruction on line 1 because the [[processor register|register]] R1 is a source [[operand]] of the addition operation on line 2.  The &lt;code&gt;add&lt;/code&gt; on line 2 cannot execute until the &lt;code&gt;add&lt;/code&gt; on line 1 completes.  In this case, the dependence is '''static''' and easily determined by a microprocessor, because the sources and destinations are registers.  The destination register of the &lt;code&gt;add&lt;/code&gt; instruction on line 1 (&lt;code&gt;R1&lt;/code&gt;) is part of the instruction encoding, and so can be determined by the microprocessor early on, during the decode stage of the pipeline.  Similarly, the source registers of the &lt;code&gt;add&lt;/code&gt; instruction on line 2 (&lt;code&gt;R1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;R4&lt;/code&gt;) are also encoded into the instruction itself and are determined in decode.  To respect this true dependence, the microprocessor's scheduler logic will issue these instructions in the correct order (instruction 1 first, followed by instruction 2) so that the results of 1 are available when instruction 2 needs them.

Complications arise when the dependence is not statically determinable.  Such non-static dependencies arise with memory instructions (loads and stores) because the location of the operand may be indirectly specified as a register operand rather than directly specified in the instruction encoding itself.
 1: store $1, 2($2)      # Mem[R2+2] &lt;= R1
 2: load  $3, 4($4)      # R3 &lt;= Mem[R4+4] (possibly dependent on 1, possible same address as above)
Here, the store instruction writes a value to the memory location specified by the value in the address (R2+2), and the load instruction reads the value at the memory location specified by the value in address (R4+4).  The microprocessor cannot statically determine, prior to execution, if the memory locations specified in these two instructions are different, or are the same location, because the locations depend on the values in R2 and R4.  If the locations are different, the instructions are independent and can be successfully executed out of order.  However, if the locations are the same, then the load instruction is dependent on the store to produce its value.  This is known as an '''ambiguous dependence'''.

===Out-of-order execution and memory access operations===
Executing loads and stores out of order can produce incorrect results if a dependent load/store pair was executed out of order.  Consider the following code snippet, given in [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]] [[assembly language|assembly]]:

 1: div $27, $20
 2: sw  $27, 0($30)
 3: lw  $08, 0($31)
 4: sw  $26, 0($30)
 5: lw  $09, 0($31)

Assume that the scheduling logic will issue an instruction to the execution unit when all of its register operands are ready.  Further assume that registers &lt;code&gt;$30&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;$31&lt;/code&gt; are ready: the values in &lt;code&gt;$30&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;$31&lt;/code&gt; were computed a long time ago and have not changed.  However, assume &lt;code&gt;$27&lt;/code&gt; is not ready: its value is still in the process of being computed by the &lt;code&gt;div&lt;/code&gt; (integer divide) instruction.  Finally, assume that registers &lt;code&gt;$30&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;$31&lt;/code&gt; hold the same value, and thus all the loads and stores in the snippet access the same memory word.

In this situation, the &lt;code&gt;sw $27, 0($30)&lt;/code&gt; instruction on line 2 is not ready to execute, but the &lt;code&gt;lw  $08, 0($31)&lt;/code&gt; instruction on line 3 is ready.  If the processor allows the &lt;code&gt;lw&lt;/code&gt; instruction to execute before the &lt;code&gt;sw&lt;/code&gt;, the load will read an old value from the memory system; however, it should have read the value that was just written there by the &lt;code&gt;sw&lt;/code&gt;.  The load and store executed out of program order, but there was a memory dependence between them that was violated.

Similarly, assume that register &lt;code&gt;$26&lt;/code&gt; ''is'' ready.  The &lt;code&gt;sw $26, 0($30)&lt;/code&gt; instruction on line 4 is also ready to execute, and it may execute before the preceding &lt;code&gt;lw  $08, 0($31)&lt;/code&gt; on line 3.  If this occurs, the &lt;code&gt;lw  $08, 0($31)&lt;/code&gt; instruction will read the ''wrong'' value from the memory system, since a later store instruction wrote its value there before the load executed.

===Characterization of memory dependencies===

Memory dependencies come in three flavors:

* '''Read-After-Write''' (RAW) dependencies: Also known as true dependencies, RAW dependencies arise when a load operation reads a value from memory that was produced by the most recent preceding store operation to that same address.
* '''Write-After-Read''' (WAR) dependencies: Also known as anti dependencies, WAR dependencies arise when a store operation writes a value to memory that a preceding load reads.
* '''Write-After-Write''' (WAW) dependencies: Also known as output dependencies, WAW dependencies arise when two store operations write values to the same memory address.

The three dependencies are shown in the preceding code segment (reproduced for clarity):
 1: div $27, $20
 2: sw  $27, 0($30)
 3: lw  $08, 0($31)
 4: sw  $26, 0($30)
 5: lw  $09, 0($31)

* The &lt;code&gt;lw  $08, 0($31)&lt;/code&gt; instruction on line 3 has a RAW dependence on the &lt;code&gt;sw $27, 0($30)&lt;/code&gt; instruction on line 2, and the &lt;code&gt;lw  $09, 0($31)&lt;/code&gt; instruction on line 5 has a RAW dependence on the &lt;code&gt;sw $26, 0($30)&lt;/code&gt; instruction on line 4.  Both load instructions read the memory address that the preceding stores wrote.  The stores were the most recent producers to that memory address, and the loads are reading that memory address's value.
* The &lt;code&gt;sw  $26, 0($30)&lt;/code&gt; instruction on line 4 has a WAR dependence on the &lt;code&gt;lw  $08, 0($31)&lt;/code&gt; instruction on line 3 since it writes the memory address that the preceding load reads from.
* The &lt;code&gt;sw  $26, 0($30)&lt;/code&gt; instruction on line 4 has a WAW dependence on the &lt;code&gt;sw  $27, 0($30)&lt;/code&gt; instruction on line 2 since both stores write to the same memory address.

==Memory disambiguation mechanisms==

Modern microprocessors use the following mechanisms, implemented in [[computer hardware|hardware]], to resolve ambiguous dependences and recover when a dependence was violated.

===Avoiding WAR and WAW dependencies===
Values from store instructions are not committed to the memory system (in modern microprocessors, [[CPU cache]]) when they execute.  Instead, the store instructions, including the memory address and store data, are buffered in a '''store [[Queue (data structure)|queue]]''' until they reach the retirement point.  When a store retires, it ''then'' writes its value to the memory system.  This avoids the WAR and WAW dependence problems shown in the code snippet above where an earlier load receives an incorrect value from the memory system because a later store was allowed to execute before the earlier load.

Additionally, buffering stores until retirement allows processors to speculatively execute store instructions that follow an instruction that may produce an [[exception handling|exception]] (such as a load of a bad address, divide by zero, etc.) or a [[branch (computer science)|conditional branch]] instruction whose direction (taken or not taken) is not yet known.  If the exception-producing instruction has not executed or the branch direction was predicted incorrectly, the processor will have fetched and executed instructions on a "wrong path."  These instructions should not have been executed at all; the exception condition should have occurred before any of the speculative instructions executed, or the branch should have gone the other direction and caused different instructions to be fetched and executed.  The processor must "throw away" any results from the bad-path, speculatively-executed instructions when it discovers the exception or branch misprediction.  The complication for stores is that any stores on the bad or mispredicted path should not have committed their values to the memory system; if the stores had committed their values, it would be impossible to "throw away" the commit, and the memory state of the machine would be corrupted by data from a store instruction that should not have executed.

Thus, without store buffering, stores cannot execute until all previous possibly-exception-causing instructions have executed (and not caused an exception) and all previous branch directions are known.  Forcing stores to wait until branch directions and exceptions are known significantly reduces the out-of-order aggressiveness and limits ILP ([[Instruction level parallelism]]) and performance.  With store buffering, stores can execute ahead of exception-causing or unresolved branch instructions, buffering their data in the store queue but not committing their values until retirement.  This prevents stores on mispredicted or bad paths from committing their values to the memory system while still offering the increased ILP and performance from full out-of-order execution of stores.

===Store to load forwarding===
Buffering stores until retirement avoids WAW and WAR dependencies but introduces a new issue.  Consider the following scenario: a store executes and buffers its address and data in the store queue.  A few instructions later, a load executes that reads from the same memory address to which the store just wrote.  If the load reads its data from the memory system, it will read an old value that would have been overwritten by the preceding store.  The data obtained by the load will be incorrect.

To solve this problem, processors employ a technique called '''store-to-load forwarding''' using the store queue.  In addition to buffering stores until retirement, the store queue serves a second purpose: forwarding data from completed but not-yet-retired ("in-flight") stores to later loads.  Rather than a simple [[FIFO (computing and electronics)|FIFO]] queue, the store queue is really a [[content-addressable memory|Content-Addressable Memory (CAM)]] searched using the memory address.  When a load executes, it searches the store queue for in-flight stores to the same address that are logically earlier in program order.  If a matching store exists, the load obtains its data value from that store instead of the memory system.  If there is no matching store, the load accesses the memory system as usual; any preceding, matching stores must have already retired and committed their values.  This technique allows loads to obtain correct data if their producer store has completed but not yet retired.

Multiple stores to the load's memory address may be present in the store queue.  To handle this case, the store queue is [[priority encoder|priority encoded]] to select the ''latest'' store that is logically earlier than the load in program order.  The determination of which store is "latest" can be achieved by attaching some sort of [[timestamp]] to the instructions as they are fetched and decoded, or alternatively by knowing the relative position (slot) of the load with respect to the oldest and newest stores within the store queue.

===RAW dependence violations===
====Detecting RAW dependence violations====
Modern out-of-order CPUs can use a number of techniques to detect a RAW dependence violation, but all techniques require tracking in-flight loads from execution until retirement.  When a load executes, it accesses the memory system and/or store queue to obtain its data value, and then its address and data are buffered in a '''load queue''' until retirement.  The load queue is similar in structure and function to the store queue, and in fact in some processors may be combined with the store queue in a single structure called a '''load-store queue''', or '''LSQ'''.  The following techniques are used or have been proposed to detect RAW dependence violations:

=====Load queue CAM search=====
With this technique, the load queue, like the store queue, is a CAM searched using the memory access address, and keeps track of all in-flight loads.  When a store executes, it searches the load queue for completed loads from the same address that are logically later in program order.  If such a matching load exists, it must have executed before the store and thus read an incorrect, old value from the memory system/store queue.  Any instructions that used the load's value have also used bad data.  To recover if such a violation is detected, the load is marked as "violated" in the retirement buffer.  The store remains in the store queue and retirement buffer and retires normally, committing its value to the memory system when it retires.  However, when the violated load reaches the retirement point, the processor flushes the pipeline and restarts execution from the load instruction.  At this point, all previous stores have committed their values to the memory system.  The load instruction will now read the correct value from the memory system, and any dependent instructions will re-execute using the correct value.

This technique requires an associative search of the load queue on every store execution, which consumes [[digital circuit|circuit]] power and can prove to be a difficult timing path for large load queues.  However, it does not require any additional memory ([[Cache County, Utah|cache]]) ports or create resource conflicts with other loads or stores that are executing.

=====Disambiguation at retirement=====
With this technique, load instructions that have executed out-of-order are re-executed (they access the memory system and read the value from their address a second time) when they reach the retirement point.  Since the load is now the retiring instruction, it has no dependencies on any instruction still in-flight; all stores ahead of it have committed their values to the memory system, and so any value read from the memory system is guaranteed to be correct.  The value read from memory at re-execution time is compared to the value obtained when the load first executed.  If the values are the same, the original value was correct and no violation has occurred.  If the re-execution value differs from the original value, a RAW violation has occurred and the pipeline must be flushed because instructions dependent on the load have used an incorrect value.

This technique is conceptually simpler than the load queue search, and it eliminates a second CAM and its power-hungry search (the load queue can now be a simple FIFO queue).  Since the load must re-access the memory system just before retirement, the access must be very fast, so this scheme relies on a fast cache.  No matter how fast the cache is, however, the second memory system access for every out-of-order load instruction does increase instruction retirement [[latency (engineering)|latency]] and increases the total number of cache accesses that must be performed by the processor.  The additional retire-time cache access can be satisfied by re-using an existing cache port; however, this creates port resource contention with other loads and stores in the processor trying to execute, and thus may cause a decrease in performance.  Alternatively, an additional cache port can be added just for load disambiguation, but this increases the complexity, power, and area of the cache.  Some recent work (Roth 2005) has shown ways to filter many loads from re-executing if it is known that no RAW dependence violation could have occurred; such a technique would help or eliminate such latency and resource contention.

A minor benefit of this scheme (compared to a load-queue search) is that it will not flag a RAW dependence violation and trigger a [[pipeline flush]] if a store that would have caused a RAW dependence violation (the store's address matches an in-flight load's address) has a data value that matches the data value already in the cache.  In the load-queue search scheme, an additional data comparison would need to be added to the load-queue search hardware to prevent such a pipeline flush.

====Avoiding RAW dependence violations====
CPUs that fully support out-of-order execution of loads and stores must be able to detect RAW dependence violations when they occur.  However, many CPUs avoid this problem by forcing all loads and stores to execute in-order, or by supporting only a limited form of out-of-order load/store execution.  This approach offers lower performance compared to supporting full out-of-order load/store execution, but it can significantly reduce the complexity of the execution core and caches.

The first option, making loads and stores go in-order, avoids RAW dependences because there is no possibility of a load executing before its producer store and obtaining incorrect data.  Another possibility is to effectively break loads and stores into two operations: address generation and cache access.  With these two separate but linked operations, the CPU can allow loads and stores to access the memory system only once all previous loads and stores have had their address generated and buffered in the LSQ.  After address generation, there are no longer any ambiguous dependencies since all addresses are known, and so dependent loads will not be executed until their corresponding stores complete.  This scheme still allows for some "out-of-orderness"—the address generation operations for any in-flight loads and stores can execute out-of-order, and once addresses have been generated, the cache accesses for each load or store can happen in any order that respects the (now known) true dependences.

==Additional Issues==
===Memory dependence prediction===
Processors that fully support out-of-order load/store execution can use an additional, related technique, called [[memory dependence prediction]], to attempt to predict true dependences between loads and stores ''before'' their addresses are known.  Using this technique, the processor can prevent loads that are predicted to be dependent on an in-flight store from executing before that store completes, avoiding a RAW dependence violation and thus avoiding the pipeline flush and the performance penalty that is incurred.  See the memory dependence prediction article for more details.&lt;!--
===Differing operand sizes/Partial matches/Merging===
To be written.  Add info on store-to-load forwarding of values from stores of smaller sizes (say, "store byte") to loads of larger sizes (say, "load word").  Also add info on merging stores -- two "store word"s to consecutive word addresses followed by a "load dword" that uses both values.

===Address alignment===
To be written.  Loads/stores that cross cache alignment boundaries (x86 only?)

===Multiprocessor cache coherence===
To be written.  What to do when cache coherence messages arrive from the interconnect.

Increasingly such institutions are considered as a part of a unified [[documentation science|documentation]]/[[information science]] perspective.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="44251">'''Microbial metabolism''' is the means by which a [[microbe]] obtains the energy and nutrients (e.g. [[carbon]]) it needs to live and reproduce.  Microbes use many different types of [[metabolism|metabolic]] strategies and species can often be differentiated from each other based on metabolic characteristics.  The specific metabolic properties of a microbe are the major factors in determining that microbe's [[ecological niche]], and often allow for that microbe to be useful in [[biotechnology|industrial processes]] or responsible for [[biogeochemistry|biogeochemical]] cycles.

==Types==
[[File:Troph flowchart.svg|thumb|350px|right|Flow chart to determine the metabolic characteristics of microorganisms]]
{{main|Primary nutritional groups}} 

All microbial metabolisms can be arranged according to three principles:

1. How the organism obtains carbon for synthesising cell mass:
* '''[[autotroph]]ic''' – carbon is obtained from [[carbon dioxide]] ({{CO2}})
* '''[[heterotroph]]ic''' – carbon is obtained from [[organic compound]]s
* '''[[mixotroph]]ic''' – carbon is obtained from both organic compounds and by fixing carbon dioxide
2. How the organism obtains [[reducing equivalent]]s used either in energy conservation or in biosynthetic reactions:
* '''[[lithotroph]]ic''' – reducing equivalents are obtained from [[inorganic compound]]s
* '''[[organotroph]]ic''' – reducing equivalents are obtained from organic compounds
3. How the organism obtains energy for living and growing:
* '''[[chemotroph]]ic''' – energy is obtained from external [[chemical compound]]s
* '''[[phototroph]]ic''' – energy is obtained from light

In practice, these terms are almost freely combined. Typical examples are as follows:

* '''chemolithoautotrophs''' obtain energy from the oxidation of inorganic compounds and carbon from the fixation of carbon dioxide. Examples: [[Nitrifying bacteria]], Sulfur-oxidizing bacteria, [[Iron-oxidizing bacteria]], [[Knallgas-bacteria]]
* '''photolithoautotrophs''' obtain energy from light and carbon from the fixation of carbon dioxide, using reducing equivalents from inorganic compounds. Examples: [[Cyanobacteria]] (water ({{chem|H|2|O}}) as reducing equivalent donor), [[Chlorobiaceae]], [[Chromatiaceae]] (hydrogen sulfide ({{chem|link=Hydrogen sulfide|H|2|S}}) as reducing equivalent donor), ''[[Chloroflexus]]'' (hydrogen ({{chem|H|2}}) as reducing equivalent donor)
* '''chemolithoheterotrophs''' obtain energy from the oxidation of inorganic compounds, but cannot fix carbon dioxide ({{CO2}}). Examples: some ''[[Hydrogenophilaceae|Thiobacilus]]'', some ''[[Beggiatoa]]'', some ''[[Nitrobacter]]'' spp., ''[[Wolinella]]'' (with {{chem|H|2}} as reducing equivalent donor), some [[Knallgas-bacteria]], some [[sulfate-reducing bacteria]]
* '''chemoorganoheterotrophs''' obtain energy, carbon, and reducing equivalents for biosynthetic reactions from organic compounds. Examples: most bacteria, e. g. ''[[Escherichia coli]]'', ''[[Bacillus]]'' spp., ''[[Actinobacteria]]''
* '''photoorganoheterotrophs''' obtain energy from light, carbon and reducing equivalents for biosynthetic reactions from organic compounds. Some species are strictly heterotrophic, many others can also fix carbon dioxide and are mixotrophic. Examples: ''[[Rhodobacter]]'', ''[[Rhodopseudomonas]]'', ''[[Rhodospirillum]]'', ''[[Rhodomicrobium]]'', ''[[Rhodocyclus]]'', ''[[Heliobacteria|Heliobacterium]]'', ''[[Chloroflexus]]'' (alternatively to photolithoautotrophy with hydrogen)

==Heterotrophic microbial metabolism==

Some microbes are heterotrophic (more precisely chemoorganoheterotrophic), using organic compounds as both carbon and energy sources. Heterotrophic microbes live off of nutrients that they scavenge from living hosts (as [[commensals]] or [[parasite]]s) or find in dead organic matter of all kind ([[saprophage]]s). Microbial metabolism is the main contribution for the bodily decay of all organisms after death. Many [[eukaryotic]] microorganisms are heterotrophic by [[predation]] or [[parasitism]], properties also found in some bacteria such as ''[[Bdellovibrio]]'' (an intracellular parasite of other bacteria, causing death of its victims) and Myxobacteria such as ''[[Myxococcus]]'' (predators of other bacteria which are killed and lysed by cooperating swarms of many single cells of Myxobacteria). Most [[pathogen]]ic bacteria can be viewed as heterotrophic parasites of humans or the other eukaryotic species they affect. Heterotrophic microbes are extremely abundant in nature and are responsible for the breakdown of large organic [[polymer]]s such as [[cellulose]], [[chitin]] or [[lignin]] which are generally indigestible to larger animals. Generally, the breakdown of large polymers to carbon dioxide ([[Mineralization (biology)|mineralization]]) requires several different organisms, with one breaking down the polymer into its constituent monomers, one able to use the monomers and excreting simpler waste compounds as by-products, and one able to use the excreted wastes.  There are many variations on this theme, as different organisms are able to degrade different polymers and secrete different waste products.  Some organisms are even able to degrade more recalcitrant compounds such as petroleum compounds or pesticides, making them useful in [[bioremediation]].

Biochemically, [[prokaryotic]] heterotrophic metabolism is much more versatile than that of [[eukaryotic]] organisms, although many prokaryotes share the most basic metabolic models with eukaryotes, e. g. using [[glycolysis]] (also called [[Embden-Meyerhoff-Parnas|EMP pathway]]) for sugar metabolism and the [[citric acid cycle]] to degrade [[acetate]], producing energy in the form of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] and reducing power in the form of [[NADH]] or [[quinols]].  These basic pathways are well conserved because they are also involved in biosynthesis of many conserved building blocks needed for cell growth (sometimes in reverse direction).  However, many [[bacteria]] and [[archaea]] utilize alternative metabolic pathways other than glycolysis and the citric acid cycle.  A well-studied example is sugar metabolism via the [[KDPG pathway|keto-deoxy-phosphogluconate pathway]] (also called [[Entner–Doudoroff pathway|ED pathway]]) in ''[[Pseudomonas]]''.  Moreover, there is a third alternative sugar-catabolic pathway used by some bacteria, the [[pentose phosphate pathway]]. The metabolic diversity and ability of prokaryotes to use a large variety of organic compounds arises from the much deeper evolutionary history and diversity of prokaryotes, as compared to eukaryotes.  It is also noteworthy that the [[mitochondrion]], the small membrane-bound intracellular organelle that is the site of eukaryotic energy metabolism, arose from the [[endosymbiosis]] of a [[bacterium]] related to obligate intracellular ''[[Rickettsia]]'', and also to plant-associated ''[[Rhizobium]]'' or ''[[Agrobacterium]]''.  Therefore, it is not surprising that all mitrochondriate eukaryotes share metabolic properties with these [[Proteobacteria]].  Most microbes [[Cellular respiration|respire]] (use an [[electron transport chain]]), although [[oxygen]] is not the only [[terminal electron acceptor]] that may be used.  As discussed below, the use of terminal electron acceptors other than oxygen has important biogeochemical consequences.

==Fermentation==
{{main|Fermentation (biochemistry)}}

Fermentation is a specific type of heterotrophic metabolism that uses [[organic compound|organic carbon]] instead of oxygen as a terminal electron acceptor.  This means that these organisms do not use an electron transport chain to oxidize NADH to {{chem|NAD|+}} and therefore must have an alternative method of using this reducing power and maintaining a supply of {{chem|NAD|+}} for the proper functioning of normal metabolic pathways (e.g. glycolysis).  As oxygen is not required, fermentative organisms are [[Anaerobic organism|anaerobic]].  Many organisms can use fermentation under anaerobic conditions and [[aerobic respiration]] when oxygen is present.  These organisms are [[facultative anaerobe]]s.  To avoid the overproduction of NADH, [[Obligate anaerobe|obligately]] fermentative organisms usually do not have a complete citric acid cycle.  Instead of using an [[ATP synthase]] as in [[Cellular respiration|respiration]], ATP in fermentative organisms is produced by [[substrate-level phosphorylation]] where a [[phosphate]] group is transferred from a high-energy organic compound to [[Adenosine diphosphate|ADP]] to form ATP.  As a result of the need to produce high energy phosphate-containing organic compounds (generally in the form of [[Coenzyme A]]-esters) fermentative organisms use NADH and other [[cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]]s to produce many different reduced metabolic by-products, often including [[hydrogen]] gas ({{chem|H|2}}). These reduced organic compounds are generally small [[organic acid]]s and [[alcohol]]s derived from [[pyruvic acid|pyruvate]], the end product of [[glycolysis]]. Examples include [[ethanol]], [[acetic acid|acetate]], [[lactic acid|lactate]], and [[butyric acid|butyrate]]. Fermentative organisms are very important industrially and are used to make many different types of food products. The different metabolic end products produced by each specific bacterial species are responsible for the different tastes and properties of each food.

Not all fermentative organisms use substrate-level [[phosphorylation]]. Instead, some organisms are able to couple the oxidation of low-energy organic compounds directly to the formation of a [[proton motive force|proton (or sodium) motive force]] and therefore [[ATP synthesis]].  Examples of these unusual forms of fermentation include [[succinate]] fermentation by ''[[Propionigenium modestum]]'' and [[oxalate]] fermentation by ''[[Oxalobacter formigenes]]''. These reactions are extremely low-energy yielding.  Humans and other higher animals also use fermentation to produce [[Lactic acid|lactate]] from excess NADH, although this is not the major form of metabolism as it is in fermentative microorganisms.

==Special metabolic properties==

===Methylotrophy===

Methylotrophy refers to the ability of an organism to use [[C1-compounds]] as energy sources. These compounds include [[methanol]], [[methyl amine]]s, [[formaldehyde]], and [[formic acid|formate]].  Several other less common substrates may also be used for metabolism, all of which lack carbon-carbon bonds. Examples of methylotrophs include the bacteria ''[[Methylomonas]]'' and ''[[Methylobacter]]''.  [[Methanotroph]]s are a specific type of methylotroph that are also able to use [[methane]] ({{chem|CH|4}}) as a carbon source by oxidizing it sequentially to methanol ({{chem|CH|3|OH}}), formaldehyde ({{chem|CH|2|O}}), formate ({{chem|HCOO|-}}), and carbon dioxide {{CO2}} initially using the enzyme [[methane monooxygenase]].  As oxygen is required for this process, all (conventional) methanotrophs are [[obligate aerobe]]s.  Reducing power in the form of [[quinone]]s and NADH is produced during these oxidations to produce a proton motive force and therefore ATP generation.  Methylotrophs and methanotrophs are not considered as autotrophic, because they are able to incorporate some of the oxidized methane (or other metabolites) into cellular carbon before it is completely oxidized to {{CO2}} (at the level of formaldehyde), using either the [[serine pathway]] (''[[Methylosinus]]'', ''[[Methylocystis]]'') or the [[ribulose monophosphate pathway]] (''[[Methylococcus]]''), depending on the species of methylotroph.

In addition to aerobic methylotrophy, methane can also be oxidized anaerobically. This occurs by a consortium of sulfate-reducing bacteria and relatives of [[methanogen]]ic [[Archaea]] working syntrophically (see below). Little is currently known about the biochemistry and ecology of this process.

[[Methanogenesis]] is the biological production of methane.  It is carried out by methanogens, strictly [[Anaerobic organism|anaerobic]] Archaea such as ''[[Methanococcus]]'', ''[[Methanocaldococcus]]'', ''[[Methanobacterium]]'',
''[[Methanothermus]]'', ''[[Methanosarcina]]'', ''[[Methanosaeta]]'' and ''[[Methanopyrus]]''.  The biochemistry of methanogenesis is unique in nature in its use of a number of unusual [[cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]]s to sequentially reduce methanogenic substrates to methane, such as [[coenzyme M]] and [[methanofuran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=DiMarco AA, Bobik TA, Wolfe RS |title=Unusual coenzymes of methanogenesis |journal=Annu. Rev. Biochem. |volume=59 |pages=355&amp;ndash;94 |year=1990 |pmid=2115763 |doi=10.1146/annurev.bi.59.070190.002035}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These cofactors are responsible (among other things) for the establishment of a [[proton]] gradient across the outer membrane thereby driving ATP synthesis.  Several types of methanogenesis occur, differing in the starting compounds oxidized.  Some methanogens reduce carbon dioxide ({{CO2}}) to methane ({{chem|CH|4}}) using electrons (most often) from hydrogen gas ({{chem|H|2}})  chemolithoautotrophically.  These methanogens can often be found in environments containing fermentative organisms.  The tight association of methanogens and fermentative bacteria can be considered to be syntrophic (see below) because the methanogens, which rely on the fermentors for hydrogen, relieve feedback inhibition of the fermentors by the build-up of excess hydrogen that would otherwise inhibit their growth.  This type of syntrophic relationship is specifically known as [[interspecies hydrogen transfer]].  A second group of methanogens use methanol ({{chem|CH|3|OH}}) as a substrate for methanogenesis. These are chemoorganotrophic, but still autotrophic in using {{CO2}} as only carbon source.  The biochemistry of this process is quite different from that of the carbon dioxide-reducing methanogens.  Lastly, a third group of methanogens produce both methane and carbon dioxide from [[acetate]] ({{chem|CH|3|COO|-}}) with the acetate being split between the two carbons. These acetate-cleaving organisms are the only chemoorganoheterotrophic methanogens.  All autotrophic methanogens use a variation of the [[reductive acetyl-CoA pathway]] to fix {{CO2}} and obtain cellular carbon.

===Syntrophy===

Syntrophy, in the context of microbial metabolism, refers to the pairing of multiple species to achieve a [[chemical reaction]] that, on its own, would be energetically unfavorable.  The best studied example of this process is the oxidation of fermentative end products (such as acetate, [[ethanol]] and [[butyrate]]) by organisms such as ''[[Syntrophomonas]]''.  Alone, the oxidation of butyrate to acetate and hydrogen gas is energetically unfavorable.  However, when a [[hydrogenotrophic]] (hydrogen-using) methanogen is present the use of the hydrogen gas will significantly lower the concentration of hydrogen (down to 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; atm) and thereby shift the [[Chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]] of the butyrate oxidation reaction under standard conditions (ΔGº’) to non-standard conditions (ΔG’). Because the concentration of one product is lowered, the reaction is "pulled" towards the products and shifted towards net energetically favorable conditions (for butyrate oxidation: ΔGº’= +48.2 kJ/mol, but ΔG' = -8.9 kJ/mol at 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; atm hydrogen and even lower if also the initially produced acetate is further metabolized by methanogens). Conversely, the available free energy from methanogenesis is lowered from ΔGº’= -131 kJ/mol under standard conditions to ΔG' = -17 kJ/mol at 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; atm hydrogen. This is an example of intraspecies hydrogen transfer.  In this way, low energy-yielding carbon sources can be used by a consortium of organisms to achieve further degradation and eventual [[mineralization (biology)|mineralization]] of these compounds.  These reactions help prevent the excess sequestration of carbon over geologic time scales, releasing it back to the biosphere in usable forms such as methane and {{CO2}}.

==Anaerobic respiration==

While [[aerobic organism]]s during respiration use oxygen as a [[terminal electron acceptor]], [[anaerobic organism]]s use other electron acceptors. These inorganic compounds have a lower reduction potential than oxygen, meaning that [[Cellular respiration|respiration]] is less efficient in these organisms and leads to slower growth rates than aerobes. Many [[facultative anaerobe]]s can use either oxygen or alternative terminal electron acceptors for respiration depending on the environmental conditions.

Most respiring anaerobes are heterotrophs, although some do live autotrophically. All of the processes described below are dissimilative, meaning that they are used during energy production and not to provide nutrients for the cell (assimilative). Assimilative pathways for many forms of [[anaerobic respiration]] are also known.

===Denitrification – nitrate as electron acceptor===
{{main|Denitrification}}

Denitrification is the utilization of [[nitrate]] ({{chem|NO|3|-}}) as a terminal electron acceptor.  It is a widespread process that is used by many members of the Proteobacteria.  Many facultative anaerobes use denitrification because nitrate, like oxygen, has a high reduction potential.  Many denitrifying bacteria can also use ferric [[iron]] ({{chem|Fe|3+}}) and some organic [[electron acceptor]]s.  Denitrification involves the stepwise reduction of nitrate to [[nitrite]] ({{chem|NO|2|-}}), [[nitric oxide]] (NO), [[nitrous oxide]] ({{chem|N|2|O}}), and dinitrogen ({{chem|N|2}}) by the enzymes [[nitrate reductase]], [[nitrite reductase]], nitric oxide reductase, and nitrous oxide reductase, respectively.  Protons are transported across the membrane by the initial NADH reductase, quinones, and nitrous oxide reductase to produce the electrochemical gradient critical for respiration.  Some organisms (e.g. ''[[E. coli]]'') only produce nitrate reductase and therefore can accomplish only the first reduction leading to the accumulation of nitrite.  Others (e.g. ''[[Paracoccus denitrificans]]'' or ''[[Pseudomonas stutzeri]]'') reduce nitrate completely.  Complete denitrification is an environmentally significant process because some intermediates of denitrification (nitric oxide and nitrous oxide) are important [[greenhouse gas]]es that react with [[sunlight]] and [[ozone]] to produce nitric acid, a component of [[acid rain]].  Denitrification is also important in biological [[wastewater]] treatment where it is used to reduce the amount of nitrogen released into the environment thereby reducing [[eutrophication]].

===Sulfate reduction – sulfate as electron acceptor===
{{main|Sulfate-reducing bacteria}}

[[Dissimilatory sulfate reduction]] is a relatively energetically poor process used by many Gram-negative bacteria found within the [[deltaproteobacteria]], Gram-positive organisms relating to ''[[Desulfotomaculum]]'' or the archaeon ''[[Archaeoglobus]]''. [[Hydrogen sulfide]] ({{chem|H|2|S}}) is produced as a metabolic end product. For sulfate reduction electron donors and energy are needed.

====Electron donors====

Many sulfate reducers are organotrophic, using carbon compounds such as lactate and pyruvate (among many others) as [[electron donor]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ishimoto M, Koyama J, Nagai Y |title=Biochemical Studies on Sulfate-Reducing Bacteria: IV. The Cytochrome System of Sulfate-Reducing Bacteria|journal=J Biochem |volume=41 |issue=6 |pages=763–70 |date=September 1954 |url=http://jb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pdf_extract/41/6/763}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others are lithotrophic, using hydrogen gas ({{chem|H|2}}) as an electron donor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mizuno O, Li YY, Noike T |title= The behavior of sulfate-reducing bacteria in acidogenic phase of anaerobic digestion |journal=Water Research |volume=32 |issue=5 |pages=1626–34 |date=May 1998 |doi=10.1016/S0043-1354(97)00372-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some unusual autotrophic sulfate-reducing bacteria (e.g. ''[[Desulfobacteraceae|Desulfotignum phosphitoxidans]]'') can use [[phosphite]] ({{chem|HPO|3|-}}) as an electron donor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Schink B, Thiemann V, Laue H, Friedrich MW |title= ''Desulfotignum phosphitoxidans'' sp. nov., a new marine sulfate reducer that oxidizes phosphite to phosphate |journal=Arch Microbiol |volume=177 |issue=5 |pages= 381–91|date=May 2002 |pmid=11976747 |doi= 10.1007/s00203-002-0402-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas others (e.g. ''[[Desulfovibrio|Desulfovibrio sulfodismutans]]'', ''[[Desulfobulbaceae|Desulfocapsa thiozymogenes]]'', ''[[Desulfobulbaceae|Desulfocapsa sulfoexigens]]'') are capable of sulfur disproportionation (splitting one compound into two different compounds, in this case an electron donor and an electron acceptor) using elemental sulfur (S&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;), sulfite ({{chem|SO|3|2−}}), and thiosulfate ({{chem|S|2|O|3|2-}}) to produce both hydrogen sulfide ({{chem|H|2|S}}) and sulfate ({{chem|SO|4|2−}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jackson BE, McInerney MJ |title=Thiosulfate Disproportionation by Desulfotomaculum thermobenzoicum |journal=Appl Environ Microbiol |volume=66 |issue=8 |pages=3650–3|date=August 2000 |pmid=10919837 |doi= 10.1128/AEM.66.8.3650-3653.2000 |pmc= 92201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Energy for reduction====

All sulfate-reducing organisms are strict anaerobes.  Because sulfate is energetically stable, before it can be metabolized it must first be activated by adenylation to form APS (adenosine 5’-phosphosulfate) thereby consuming ATP.  The APS is then reduced by the enzyme APS reductase to form [[sulfite]] ({{chem|SO|3|2−}}) and [[Adenosine monophosphate|AMP]].  In organisms that use carbon compounds as electron donors, the ATP consumed is accounted for by fermentation of the carbon substrate.  The hydrogen produced during fermentation is actually what drives respiration during sulfate reduction.

===Acetogenesis – carbon dioxide as electron acceptor===
{{main|Acetogenesis}}

Acetogenesis is a type of microbial metabolism that uses hydrogen ({{chem|H|2}}) as an electron donor and carbon dioxide ({{CO2}}) as an electron acceptor to produce acetate, the same electron donors and acceptors used in methanogenesis (see above).  Bacteria that can autotrophically synthesize acetate are called homoacetogens.  Carbon dioxide [[Redox|reduction]] in all homoacetogens occurs by the acetyl-CoA pathway.  This pathway is also used for carbon fixation by autotrophic sulfate-reducing bacteria and hydrogenotrophic methanogens.  Often homoacetogens can also be fermentative, using the hydrogen and carbon dioxide produced as a result of fermentation to produce acetate, which is secreted as an end product.

===Other inorganic electron acceptors===

Ferric iron ({{chem|Fe|3+}}) is a widespread anaerobic terminal electron acceptor both for autotrophic and heterotrophic organisms.  Electron flow in these organisms is similar to those in [[electron transport]], ending in oxygen or nitrate, except that in ferric iron-reducing organisms the final enzyme in this system is a ferric iron reductase.  Model organisms include ''[[Shewanella putrefaciens]]'' and ''[[Geobacter|Geobacter metallireducens]]''.  Since some ferric iron-reducing bacteria (e.g. ''G. metallireducens'') can use toxic [[hydrocarbon]]s such as [[toluene]] as a carbon source, there is significant interest in using these organisms as bioremediation agents in ferric iron-rich contaminated [[aquifer]]s.

Although ferric iron is the most prevalent inorganic electron acceptor, a number of organisms (including the iron-reducing bacteria mentioned above) can use other [[inorganic]] ions in anaerobic respiration.  While these processes may often be less significant ecologically, they are of considerable interest for bioremediation, especially when [[heavy metals]] or [[radionuclide]]s are used as electron acceptors.  Examples include:
* [[Manganese|Manganic ion]] ({{chem|Mn|4+}}) reduction to [[manganous ion]] ({{chem|Mn|2+}})
* [[Selenium|Selenate]] ({{chem|SeO|4|2-}}) reduction to [[Selenium|selenite]] ({{chem|SeO|3|2-}}) and selenite reduction to inorganic [[selenium]] (Se&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;)
* [[Arsenic|Arsenate]] ({{chem|AsO|4|3-}}) reduction to [[arsenic|arsenite]] ({{chem|AsO|3|3-}})
* [[Uranyl|Uranyl ion]] ion ({{chem|UO|2|2+}}) reduction to [[uranium dioxide]] ({{chem|UO|2}})

===Organic terminal electron acceptors===

A number of organisms, instead of using inorganic compounds as terminal electron acceptors, are able to use organic compounds to accept electrons from respiration.  Examples include:
* [[Fumarate]] reduction to [[succinate]]
* [[Trimethylamine N-oxide|Trimethylamine ''N''-oxide]] (TMAO) reduction to [[trimethylamine]] (TMA)
* [[Dimethyl sulfoxide]] (DMSO) reduction to [[Dimethyl sulfide]] (DMS)
* Reductive dechlorination
TMAO is a chemical commonly produced by [[fish]], and when reduced to TMA produces a strong odor.  DMSO is a common marine and freshwater chemical which is also odiferous when reduced to DMS.  Reductive dechlorination is the process by which chlorinated organic compounds are reduced to form their non-chlorinated endproducts.  As chlorinated organic compounds are often important (and difficult to degrade) environmental pollutants, reductive dechlorination is an important process in bioremediation.

==Chemolithotrophy==

[[Chemolithotrophy]] is a type of metabolism where energy is obtained from the oxidation of inorganic compounds.  Most chemolithotrophic organisms are also autotrophic.  There are two major objectives to chemolithotrophy: the generation of energy (ATP) and the generation of reducing power (NADH).

===Hydrogen oxidation===
{{main|Hydrogen oxidizing bacteria}}
Many organisms are capable of using hydrogen ({{chem|H|2}}) as a source of energy.  While several mechanisms of anaerobic hydrogen [[oxidation]] have been mentioned previously (e.g. sulfate reducing- and acetogenic bacteria), hydrogen can also be used as an energy source aerobically in the knallgas reaction:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100040856| title=knallgas reaction| publisher=Oxford Reference |access-date=August 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + energy

In these organisms, hydrogen is oxidized by a membrane-bound [[hydrogenase]] causing proton pumping via electron transfer to various quinones and [[cytochrome]]s.  In many organisms, a second cytoplasmic hydrogenase is used to generate reducing power in the form of NADH, which is subsequently used to fix carbon dioxide via the [[Calvin cycle]].  Hydrogen-oxidizing organisms, such as ''Cupriavidus necator'' (formerly ''[[Ralstonia eutropha]]''), often inhabit oxic-anoxic interfaces in nature to take advantage of the hydrogen produced by anaerobic fermentative organisms while still maintaining a supply of oxygen.

===Sulfur oxidation===

Sulfur oxidation involves the oxidation of reduced sulfur compounds (such as sulfide {{chem|H|2|S}}), inorganic sulfur (S), and thiosulfate ({{chem|S|2|O|3|2-}}) to form [[sulfuric acid]] ({{chem|H|2|SO|4}}).  A classic example of a sulfur-oxidizing bacterium is ''[[Beggiatoa]]'', a microbe originally described by [[Sergei Winogradsky]], one of the founders of [[environmental microbiology]]. Another example is ''[[Paracoccus]]''. Generally, the oxidation of sulfide occurs in stages, with inorganic sulfur being stored either inside or outside of the cell until needed.  This two step process occurs because energetically sulfide is a better electron donor than inorganic sulfur or thiosulfate, allowing for a greater number of protons to be translocated across the membrane.  Sulfur-oxidizing organisms generate reducing power for carbon dioxide fixation via the Calvin cycle using [[reverse electron flow]], an energy-requiring process that pushes the electrons against their [[thermodynamic]] gradient to produce NADH.  Biochemically, reduced sulfur compounds are converted to sulfite ({{chem|SO|3|2−}}) and subsequently converted to sulfate ({{chem|SO|4|2−}}) by the enzyme [[sulfite oxidase]].&lt;ref name="sulfite"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kappler U, Bennett B, Rethmeier J, Schwarz G, Deutzmann R, McEwan AG, Dahl C |title= Sulfite:Cytochrome ''c'' Oxidoreductase from ''Thiobacillus novellus''.  Purification, Characterization, and Molecular Biology of a Heterodimeric Member of the Sulfite Oxidase Family |journal= J Biol Chem |volume=275 |issue=18 |pages=13202–12|date=May 2000 |pmid=10788424 |doi= 10.1074/jbc.275.18.13202 |url=http://www.jbc.org/content/275/18/13202.full}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some organisms, however, accomplish the same oxidation using a reversal of the APS reductase system used by sulfate-reducing bacteria (see [[Microbial metabolism#Energy for reduction|above]]).  In all cases the energy liberated is transferred to the electron transport chain for ATP and NADH production.&lt;ref name="sulfite" /&gt;  In addition to aerobic sulfur oxidation, some organisms (e.g. ''[[Thiobacillus denitrificans]]'') use nitrate ({{chem|NO|3|-}}) as a terminal electron acceptor and therefore grow anaerobically.

===Ferrous iron ({{chem|Fe|2+}}) oxidation===
{{further information|Acidophiles in acid mine drainage}}

[[Iron(II) oxide|Ferrous iron]] is a soluble form of iron that is stable at extremely low [[pH]]s or under anaerobic conditions.  Under aerobic, moderate pH conditions ferrous iron is oxidized spontaneously to the ferric ({{chem|Fe|3+}}) form and is hydrolyzed abiotically to insoluble [[ferric hydroxide]] ({{chem|Fe(OH)|3}}).  There are three distinct types of ferrous iron-oxidizing microbes.  The first are [[acidophile (organisms)|acidophile]]s, such as the bacteria ''[[Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans]]'' and ''[[Leptospirillum ferrooxidans]]'', as well as the [[archaeon]] ''[[Ferroplasma]]''.  These microbes oxidize iron in environments that have a very low pH and are important in [[acid mine drainage]].  The second type of microbes oxidize ferrous iron at near-neutral pH. These micro-organisms (for example ''[[Gallionella ferruginea]]'', ''[[Leptothrix ochracea]]'', or ''[[Mariprofundus ferrooxydans]]'') live at the oxic-anoxic interfaces and are  microaerophiles.  The third type of iron-oxidizing microbes are anaerobic photosynthetic bacteria such as [[Rhodopseudomonas]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jiao Y, Kappler A, Croal LR, Newman DK |title= Isolation and Characterization of a Genetically Tractable Photoautotrophic Fe(II)-Oxidizing Bacterium, Rhodopseudomonas palustris Strain TIE-1 |journal=Appl Environ Microbiol |volume=71 |issue=8 |pages=4487–96|date=August 2005 |pmid=16085840 |doi= 10.1128/AEM.71.8.4487-4496.2005 |pmc= 1183355}}&lt;/ref&gt; which use ferrous iron to produce NADH for autotrophic carbon dioxide fixation.  Biochemically, aerobic iron oxidation is a very energetically poor process which therefore requires large amounts of iron to be oxidized by the enzyme [[rusticyanin]] to facilitate the formation of proton motive force.  Like sulfur oxidation, reverse electron flow must be used to form the NADH used for carbon dioxide fixation via the Calvin cycle.

===Nitrification===

Nitrification is the process by which [[ammonia]] ({{chem|NH|3}}) is converted to nitrate ({{chem|NO|3|-}}).  Nitrification is actually the net result of two distinct processes: oxidation of ammonia to nitrite ({{chem|link=Nitrite|NO|2|-}}) by nitrosifying bacteria (e.g. ''[[Nitrosomonas]]'') and oxidation of nitrite to nitrate by the nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (e.g. ''[[Nitrobacter]]'').  Both of these processes are extremely energetically poor leading to very slow growth rates for both types of organisms.  Biochemically, ammonia oxidation occurs by the stepwise oxidation of ammonia to [[hydroxylamine]] ({{chem|NH|2|OH}}) by the enzyme ammonia monooxygenase in the [[cytoplasm]], followed by the oxidation of hydroxylamine to nitrite by the enzyme hydroxylamine oxidoreductase in the [[periplasm]].

Electron and proton cycling are very complex but as a net result only one proton is translocated across the membrane per molecule of ammonia oxidized.  Nitrite oxidation is much simpler, with nitrite being oxidized by the enzyme [[nitrite oxidoreductase]] coupled to proton translocation by a very short electron transport chain, again leading to very low growth rates for these organisms.  Oxygen is required in both ammonia and nitrite oxidation, meaning that both nitrosifying and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria are aerobes.  As in sulfur and iron oxidation, NADH for carbon dioxide fixation using the Calvin cycle is generated by reverse electron flow, thereby placing a further metabolic burden on an already energy-poor process.

In 2015, two groups independently showed the microbial genus ''[[Nitrospira]]'' is capable of complete nitrification ([[Comammox]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Complete nitrification by a single microorganism|url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v528/n7583/full/nature16459.html#ref4|journal = Nature|date = 2015-12-24|issn = 0028-0836|pages = 555–559|volume = 528|issue = 7583|doi = 10.1038/nature16459|first = Maartje A.

===Anammox===

Anammox stands for anaerobic ammonia oxidation and the organisms responsible were relatively recently discovered, in the late 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Strous M |title=Missing lithotroph identified as new planctomycete |journal=Nature |volume=400 |issue=6743 |pages=446–9 |date=July 1999 |pmid=10440372 |doi=10.1038/22749 |name-list-format=vanc|author2=Fuerst JA |author3=Kramer EH |display-authors=3 |last4=Kramer |first4=Evelien H.

Gijs}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This form of metabolism occurs in members of the [[Planctomycetes]] (e.g. Candidatus ''[[Brocadia anammoxidans]]'') and involves the coupling of ammonia oxidation to nitrite reduction.  As oxygen is not required for this process, these organisms are strict anaerobes.  Amazingly, [[hydrazine]] ({{chem|N|2|H|4}} – rocket fuel) is produced as an intermediate during anammox metabolism.  To deal with the high toxicity of hydrazine, anammox bacteria contain a hydrazine-containing intracellular organelle called the anammoxasome, surrounded by highly compact (and unusual) [[ladderane]] lipid membrane.  These lipids are unique in nature, as is the use of hydrazine as a metabolic intermediate.  Anammox organisms are autotrophs although the mechanism for carbon dioxide fixation is unclear.  Because of this property, these organisms could be used to remove nitrogen in [[industrial wastewater treatment]] processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zhu G, Peng Y, Li B, Guo J, Yang Q, Wang S |title=Biological removal of nitrogen from wastewater |journal=Rev Environ Contam Toxicol |volume=192 |issue= |pages=159–95 |year=2008 |pmid=18020306 |doi=10.1007/978-0-387-71724-1_5 |series=Reviews of Environmental Contamination and Toxicology |isbn=978-0-387-71723-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Anammox has also been shown to have widespread occurrence in anaerobic aquatic systems and has been speculated to account for approximately 50% of nitrogen gas production in the ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Op den Camp HJ |title=Global impact and application of the anaerobic ammonium-oxidizing (anammox) bacteria |journal=Biochem Soc Trans |volume=34 |issue=Pt 1 |pages=174–8 |date=February 2006 |pmid=16417514 |doi=10.1042/BST0340174 |name-list-format=vanc }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phototrophy==
{{Main|Phototrophic prokaryotes}}

Many microbes (phototrophs) are capable of using light as a source of energy to produce [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] and [[organic compound]]s such as [[carbohydrate]]s, [[lipid]]s, and [[protein]]s.  Of these, [[algae]] are particularly significant because they are oxygenic, using water as an [[electron donor]] for electron transfer during photosynthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Gräber| first1=Peter| last2=Milazzo|first2=Giulio| title= Bioenergetics| year= 1997| publisher=Birkhäuser| page= 80| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=N-EUfoA4tCIC&amp;pg=PA80&amp;dq=oxygenic+photosynthesis+algae+water+%22electron+donor%22&amp;cd=7#v=onepage&amp;q=oxygenic%20photosynthesis%20algae%20water%20%22electron%20donor%22| isbn= 978-3-7643-5295-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Phototrophic bacteria are found in the phyla [[Cyanobacteria]], [[Chlorobi]], [[Proteobacteria]], [[Chloroflexi (phylum)|Chloroflexi]], and [[Firmicutes]].&lt;ref name=Bryant /&gt; Along with plants these microbes are responsible for all biological generation of oxygen gas on [[Earth]]. Because [[chloroplast]]s were derived from a lineage of the Cyanobacteria, the general principles of metabolism in these [[endosymbiont]]s can also be applied to chloroplasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=McFadden G |title=Endosymbiosis and evolution of the plant cell |journal=Curr Opin Plant Biol |volume=2 |issue=6 |pages=513–9 |year=1999 |pmid=10607659 |doi=10.1016/S1369-5266(99)00025-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to oxygenic photosynthesis, many bacteria can also photosynthesize anaerobically, typically using sulfide ({{chem|H|2|S}}) as an electron donor to produce sulfate.  Inorganic sulfur ({{chem|S|0}}), thiosulfate ({{chem|S|2|O|3|2-}}) and ferrous iron ({{chem|Fe|2+}}) can also be used by some organisms.  Phylogenetically, all oxygenic photosynthetic bacteria are Cyanobacteria, while anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria belong to the purple bacteria (Proteobacteria), [[Green sulfur bacteria]] (e.g. [[Chlorobium]]), [[Green non-sulfur bacteria]] (e.g. [[Chloroflexus]]), or the [[heliobacteria]] (Low %G+C Gram positives).  In addition to these organisms, some microbes (e.g. the Archaeon ''[[Halobacterium]]'' or the bacterium ''[[Roseobacter]]'', among others) can utilize light to produce energy using the enzyme [[bacteriorhodopsin]], a light-driven proton pump. However, there are no known Archaea that carry out photosynthesis.&lt;ref name=Bryant&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bryant DA, Frigaard NU |title=Prokaryotic photosynthesis and phototrophy illuminated |journal=Trends Microbiol |volume=14 |issue=11 |pages=488&amp;ndash;96 |date=November 2006 |pmid=16997562 |doi=10.1016/j.tim.2006.09.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As befits the large diversity of photosynthetic bacteria, there are many different mechanisms by which light is converted into energy for metabolism.  All photosynthetic organisms locate their [[photosynthetic reaction center]]s  within a membrane, which may be invaginations of the [[cytoplasmic membrane]] (Proteobacteria), [[thylakoid membrane]]s (Cyanobacteria), specialized antenna structures called [[chlorosome]]s (Green sulfur and non-sulfur bacteria), or the cytoplasmic membrane itself (heliobacteria).  Different photosynthetic bacteria also contain different photosynthetic pigments, such as [[chlorophyll]]s and [[carotenoids]], allowing them to take advantage of different portions of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]] and thereby inhabit different [[ecological niche|niche]]s.  Some groups of organisms contain more specialized light-harvesting structures (e.g. [[phycobilisome]]s in Cyanobacteria and chlorosomes in Green sulfur and non-sulfur bacteria), allowing for increased efficiency in light utilization.

Biochemically, anoxygenic photosynthesis is very different from oxygenic photosynthesis.  Cyanobacteria (and by extension, chloroplasts) use the [[Z scheme]] of electron flow in which electrons eventually are used to form NADH.  Two different reaction centers (photosystems) are used and proton motive force is generated both by using cyclic electron flow and the quinone pool.  In anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria, electron flow is cyclic, with all electrons used in photosynthesis eventually being transferred back to the single reaction center.  A proton motive force is generated using only the quinone pool.  In heliobacteria, Green sulfur, and Green non-sulfur bacteria, NADH is formed using the protein [[ferredoxin]], an energetically favorable reaction.  In purple bacteria, NADH is formed by reverse electron flow due to the lower chemical potential of this reaction center.  In all cases, however, a proton motive force is generated and used to drive ATP production via an ATPase.

Most photosynthetic microbes are autotrophic, fixing carbon dioxide via the Calvin cycle.  Some photosynthetic bacteria (e.g. Chloroflexus) are photoheterotrophs, meaning that they use organic carbon compounds as a carbon source for growth.  Some photosynthetic organisms also fix nitrogen (see below).

==Nitrogen fixation==
{{main|Nitrogen fixation}}

Nitrogen is an element required for growth by all biological systems.  While extremely common (80% by volume) in the [[atmosphere]], dinitrogen gas ({{chem|N|2}}) is generally biologically inaccessible due to its high [[activation energy]].  Throughout all of nature, only specialized bacteria and Archaea are capable of nitrogen fixation, converting dinitrogen gas into ammonia ({{chem|NH|3}}), which is easily assimilated by all organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cabello P, Roldán MD, Moreno-Vivián C |title=Nitrate reduction and the nitrogen cycle in archaea |journal=Microbiology |volume=150 |issue=Pt 11 |pages=3527&amp;ndash;46 |date=November 2004 |pmid=15528644 |doi=10.1099/mic.0.27303-0 |url=http://mic.sgmjournals.org/cgi/content/full/150/11/3527?view=long&amp;pmid=15528644}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These prokaryotes, therefore, are very important ecologically and are often essential for the survival of entire ecosystems.  This is especially true in the ocean, where nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria are often the only sources of fixed nitrogen, and in soils, where specialized symbioses exist between [[legume]]s and their nitrogen-fixing partners to provide the nitrogen needed by these plants for growth.

Nitrogen fixation can be found distributed throughout nearly all bacterial lineages and physiological classes but is not a universal property.  Because the enzyme [[nitrogenase]], responsible for nitrogen fixation, is very sensitive to oxygen which will inhibit it irreversibly, all nitrogen-fixing organisms must possess some mechanism to keep the concentration of oxygen low.  Examples include:
* heterocyst formation (cyanobacteria e.g. ''[[Anabaena]]'') where one cell does not photosynthesize but instead fixes nitrogen for its neighbors which in turn provide it with energy
* root nodule symbioses (e.g. ''[[Rhizobium]]'') with plants that supply oxygen to the bacteria bound to molecules of [[leghaemoglobin]]
* anaerobic lifestyle (e.g. ''[[Clostridium pasteurianum]]'')
* very fast metabolism (e.g. ''[[Azotobacter vinelandii]]'')
The production and activity of nitrogenases is very highly regulated, both because nitrogen fixation is an extremely energetically expensive process (16–24 ATP are used per {{chem|N|2}} fixed) and due to the extreme sensitivity of the nitrogenase to oxygen.

'''Moscow Aviation Institute (National Research University)''' ({{lang-ru|Московский авиационный институт}}) founded in 1930 is one of several major engineering higher education establishments in [[Moscow]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/moscow-aviation-institute-national-research-university|title=Moscow Aviation Institute (National Research University)|date=2015-07-16|work=Top Universities|access-date=2018-11-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/institution/Moscow_Aviation_Institute|title=Moscow Aviation Institute|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2018-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Since its inception MAI has been spearheading advances in aerospace technology both within Russia and worldwide. The university laid emphasis on laboratory instruction in applied science and engineering, specific to demands of the aerospace industry. During [[World War II]] part of the university was evacuated to [[Almaty]] Kazakhstan, the university, staff and students continued to work on research and wartime production throughout the war.
During the Post-War period, the university expanded and assimilated new technologies during the Jet age. Research conducted in the university contributed to heralding the space age.

The university has to its merit more than 160000 specialists, 250 chief designers in the Aerospace Industry. 50 [[Academicians]] of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]], 22 [[cosmonauts]], 100 test pilots and 60 Olympic champions in different sports.

Alumni of the institute form the backbone of many companies like [[Sukhoi]], [[MiG|MIG]], [[Ilyushin]], [[Tupolev]], [[Yakovlev]], [[Beriev]], [[Myasishchev]], [[Mil Moscow Helicopter Plant]], [[OAO S.P. Korolev Rocket and Space Corporation Energia]], [[Lavochkin]], [[Makeyev Rocket Design Bureau]], [[Khrunichev State Research and Production Space Center]], [[NPO Energomash]], [[Almaz-Antey]] and others.

== History ==

=== Founding and Vision ===

Moscow Aviation Institute (National Research University) was established on 20 March 1930 as Higher Aero-mechanical college (VAMU) by the order of Supreme Economic Council of the USSR in order to ensure training of qualified personnel for the aviation industry. The Aero-mechanical faculty of [[Bauman Moscow State Technical University]] formed the basis of the new university. On 29 August 1930, the university was renamed as Moscow Aviation Institute. In the beginning it had 3 departments, Aeronautical, Aircraft engines and Aerodynamics. On its 10th anniversary in 1940, the university had established itself as a premier aeronautical university with 38 departments, 22 laboratories and a Student design office and production facility. 

The uniqueness of the MAI is that historically it was created to train specialists for almost all departments and teams in [[OKB|the Design Bureaus]] of the aviation industry.

=== World War II ===

On 22 June 1941, Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union. The students and faculty members were mobilized to work in aircraft workshops and design offices. Many students signed up to join the armed forces during the [[Battle of Moscow]], many continued to work aircraft production facilities and armaments workshops.

The university was partly evacuated to [[Almaty]], [[Kazakhstan]] under the leadership of [[Alexander Yakovlevich Bereznyak|Alexander Yakovlev]]. By 1942 the Moscow campus of MAI started functioning in parallel with the Almaty campus. It was in the workshops of MAI in Almaty, [[Mikhail Kalashnikov]], the legendary rifle designer worked on his [[AK-47]] assault rifle.

By 1943, the university was completely relocated back to Moscow. Members of the university were involved in research &amp; designing new combat aircraft and sub-systems, along with refining and redesigning existing aircraft, for the war effort.
{|style="margin: 0 auto;"

In 1945 the institute was awarded the [[Order of Lenin]].

=== Jet age &amp; Space age ===

Although prototypes of the first jet aircraft were made as far back as 1910 by [[Henri Coandă]], it war during World War II that significant developments were made.
[[Arkhip Lyulka]] designed the first Two-stage centrifugal compressor Turbojet in 1938. [[Alexander Bereznyak]] a graduate of MAI, designed the first jet aircraft in the USSR, the [[Bereznyak-Isayev BI-1]] in 1942.

After the war, the university placed special emphasis on developing new technology required for developing jet aircraft and was quick to adapt to new technologies.
this was emphasised in May 1946, during the second Student technical conference, faculty members of the institute defended 6 post-doctoral thesis and 14 Ph.Ds on various aspects regarding development of jet aircraft. On 26 April 1946, [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-9]] became the first operational turbojet fighter in the USSR.

It was also in the same year Faculty of Radio electronics was established based on department of Radio-location, to assimilate newer technologies in the field of Radio location.

The era of helicopters began in USSR with two leading pioneers at MAI [[Boris Yuryev]], inventor of [[Swashplate]] in helicopters and [[Bratukhin]], they were awarded the state prize of the USSR in 1946. In 1952, department of helicopter design was established under the leadership of Prof. Boris Yuryev.

In 1955, the university celebrated its silver jubilee.

On 4 October 1957, the USSR launched the first artificial satellite opening up Space for mankind, graduates from MAI were deeply involved in the space program since its inception under the leadership of [[Sergey Korolev]], the legendary chief designer of head of the Soviet space program and [[Mikhail Tikhonravov]] chief designer of satellites [[Sputnik-3]], [[Luna-1]], [[Luna-3]], [[Luna-4]].

=== Cold War ===
During the cold war, students, faculty members and graduates of the university were involved in cutting edge research in the fields of Aeronautics, Missile development and armaments research. They were pivotal in keeping the USSR ahead in the arms race in close collaboration with the Aerospace and Defense industry and Research organizations like [[TsAGI]], National Institute of Aviation technologies, Russian scientific-research institute of aviation materials, Central institute of Aircraft engines, [[30th Central Scientific Research Institute, Ministry of Defence]], [[Gromov Flight Research Institute]] among others.

Key figures from the university during this era were Rostislav Belyakov chief designer of MIG-29, [[Myasishchev]], [[Mikhail Yangel]], Sergey Mikheev chief designer of Kamov helicopters, Marat Tishchenko of Mil helicopters, Mikhail Reshetnev and others.

In 1962, the University established the Student design office(ОСКБ — объединение СКБ факультетов и кафедр), which integrated different faculties and departments within the institute to develop aircraft prototypes in-house and to provide greater exposure to students in design and production work. The Design office functions today as the OKKBES-MAI http://oskbes.ru/english.html.

== Moscow Aviation Institute (Moscow Aviation and Aerospace University) today ==

Currently, MAI is the only university in Russia, which provides highly qualified personnel for the entire aerospace product life cycle from system design to implementation of the cutting edge technologies in production, testing, utilisation, and aircraft recycling.

The present-day MAI is a unique institute of higher education where thorough theoretical knowledge are combined with various practical skills. More than 120 laboratories, 3 student design offices, 3 specialized resource centers, an experimental-design factory, and an aerodrome are available for the students.

In 1980 the institute was awarded the [[Order of the October Revolution]].

In 1993 Moscow Aviation Institute was given one more name: "State Technological University". To date, the development in the field of aeronautics and astronautics is based mostly on the activities of institute professors and alumnus of the university.

Moscow Aviation Institute is a large scientific research center. Significant scientific ideas are developed here; new technological principles are discovered; new devices are invented and constructed. Five fundamental scientific discoveries for dynamic systems have been patented; the opto-electronic device "Photon" designed here is now operating in outer space; innovative power sources based on new principles invented and constructed here are currently used in aircraft and aerospace system units, etc.

In October 2009, the MAI was ranked among the 12 best universities of the Russian Federation. The rank of a "National research university" was conferred to the institute by decision of the Russian Government.

On 31 March 2015 the Ministry of Education reorganized Moscow Aviation Institute (MAI) by annexation of the Russian State Technological University named after Tsiolkovsky (MATI).

== OSKBES MAI ==

The history of aircraft creation in the MAI (Moscow Aviation Institute) began simultaneously with the foundation of the institute in 1930. The modern design bureau in the MAI was formed in 1965 as a students one. It was engaged in creation of experimental pilot and remote controlled light aircraft, which were developed according to the requirements specifications of various organizations of the Ministry of Aviation Industry (MAP), the Ministry of Civil Aviation (MGA) and the Ministry of Defense (MOP).

In 1982 by the order of Ministry of Aircraft Industry the Design Bureau was transformed into a branch-wise experimental students aircraft construction design bureau of the MAI. The work was carried out by professional engineers. If necessary the co-workers from among the MAI students and teachers and also from among the workers of the industry were invited. The production facility of the MAI aircraft development plant (EOZ) in the experimental development shop (shop № 3) are manned by qualified technicians. The OSKBES work on the experimental aircraft engineering constantly received high estimations of the industry. Their technical novelty and utility are confirmed by nine Introduction Certificates and more than twenty Invention Certificates. By the end of 1980s six experimental aircraft of different types were designed and built: Kvant, Elf-D UAV, PS-01 small-sized UAV, Elf, Photon and Yunior aircraft.

The basic structure, address and the industrial areas occupied by it in the OSKBES MAI have remained the same. The EOZ MAI (shop № 3) and the MAPO (Moscow aircraft building plant) were used as an industrial base. On July 27, 1992 the application on realization the inspection work in the OKB MA for reception the certificate for the right to develop the civil aircraft engineering was sent to the Aviaregister of the MAK and the Air Industry Department of the Ministry of Industry of Russian Federation. It was made on behalf of the "Aviatika" joint-stock company. According to the inspection results the Aviaregister of the MAK issued Certificate № R-9 to the "Aviatika" joint-stock company with the right to develop light civil aircraft. It was on February 17, 1993.

Aircraft designed and developed at OSKBES include

A single-seater Aviatika-MAI-890 aircraft — passed certification, had a temporary Certificate of a type of 31 March 1994 № 52В-890, valid till 1 April 1995, is series produced by the RAC "MiG";
A two-seater Aviatika-MAI-890U aircraft is serially produced by the RAC "MiG";
An agricultural Aviatika-MAI-890SKh aircraft is serially produced by the RAC "MiG";
A single-seater Aviatika-MAI-900 aerobatics ("Akrobat")'
A two-seater Aviatika-MAI-910 with wings, folding on the ground;
An Aviatika-MAI-920 glider;
A single-seater Aviatika-MAI-890A autogyro, a pre-production model at the stage of flying test.
The basis for the "Aviatika" aircraft manufacture at the MAPO plant is the License Agreement concluded by this plant with the "Aviatika" joint-stock company on 10 April 1995 (contract № 4276).

The personnel of the OSKBES have continued to work in the field of light civil aircraft together with the MAPO MIG.

In April 27, 1998 the Aviaregister of Interstate Aviation Committee issued a Design Organization Certificate R-52 of the developer of light civil aircraft.

29 September 1999 eight members of our design bureau, Moscow Aviation Institute and RAC "MIG" were rewarded by "State Prize of the Russian Federation in science and technology" for designing and development of light multipurpose airplanes in a serial production. They are:

OSKBES MAI Chief Designer K. Zhidovetskiy (posthumously);
OSKBES MAI Deputy Chief Designer (after the death of K. Zhidovetskiy —
Chief Designer) N. Goryunov;
OSKBES MAI Deputy Chief Designer V. Demin;
OSKBES MAI Deputy Chief Designer V. Feigenbaum;
Rector of MAI A. Matveyenko;
Manager of MAI Experimental Plant P. Ogadzhanov;
General Manager of RAC "MIG" plant G. Nemov;
Deputy Manager of RAC "MIG" O. Chukantsev.

Autogyro MAI-205 made the first flight in 2001, chief designer Andrey Zorin.

In 2002 OSKBES MAI has started designing a new plane MAI-223. This plane made the first flight in 2004.

In 2003 OSKBES MAI started to work on different aircraft, airships and autogyros. It designed and produced gondolas, nacelles, fly-by-wire power plant controls and empennages of NPO "RosAeroSystems" airships Au-30 and Au-12M.

The design and development of Autogyro MAI-208 was started in 2006. The first MAI-208 is undergoing testing. OSKBES MAI presented MAI-208 at the 2nd International exhibition of the helicopter industry "HeliRussia-2009" (21...23 May 2009, Moscow). The new autogyro has caused the big interest of visitors and the press.

July 1, 2008 Vadim Demin was appointed Chief Designer of OSKBES MAI. The same year the design office has started working on a new multi-purpose four-seat twin engine aircraft MAI-407.

In 2009 OSKBES MAI started designing a new training glider MAI-227.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6190">'''Natural heritage''' refers to the sum total of the elements of biodiversity, including flora and fauna ,
ecosystems and geological structures.

Heritage is that which is ''inherited'' from past generations, maintained in the present, and bestowed to future generations.&lt;ref&gt; Ann Marie Sullivan, Cultural Heritage &amp; New Media: A Future for the Past, 15 J. MARSHALL REV. INTELL. PROP. L. 604 (2016) https://repository.jmls.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1392&amp;context=ripl&lt;/ref&gt; The term "natural heritage", derived from "natural inheritance", pre-dates the term "[[biodiversity]]." It is a less scientific term and more easily comprehended in some ways by the wider audience interested in [[Conservation (ethic)|conservation]]. 

The term was used in this context in the United States when [[Jimmy Carter]] set up the Georgia Heritage Trust &lt;ref&gt;http://maps.csc.noaa.gov/RoisDatabaseEntry/lawDetails.jsp?lawID=107{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} The creation of the Heritage Trust Commission, Georgia Heritage Trust Act, Official Code of Georgia (O.C.G.A.)

 By James F. Cook, {{ISBN|0-86554-954-0}}, 2005 Mercer University Press&lt;/ref&gt; It would appear that Carter picked the term up from [[Lyndon Johnson]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2007-07-11-lady-bird-obit_N.htm | work=USA Today | title=Lady Bird Johnson dies at 94 | first=Kathy | last=Kiely | date=2009-01-22 | accessdate=2010-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; who used it in a 1966 Message to [[United States Congress|Congress]].  (He may have gotten the term from his wife [[Lady Bird Johnson]] who was personally interested in conservation.)  President Johnson signed the [[Wilderness Act|Wilderness Act of 1964]]. 

The term "Natural Heritage" was picked up by the Science Division of [[The Nature Conservancy]] (TNC) when, under Robert E. Jenkins, Jr., it launched in 1974 what ultimately became the network of state natural heritage programs -- one in each state, all using the same [[methodology]] and all supported permanently by state governments because they scientifically document conservation priorities and facilitate science-based environmental reviews. When this network was extended outside the United States, the term "Conservation Data Center (or Centre)" was suggested by Guillermo Mann and came to be preferred for programs outside the US{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}.  Despite the name difference, these programs, too, use the same core methodology as the 50 state natural heritage programs. In 1994 The network of natural heritage programs formed a membership association to work together on projects of common interest: the Association for Biodiversity Information (ABI). In 1999, Through an agreement with The Nature Conservancy, ABI expanded and assumed responsibility for the scientific databases, information, and tools developed by TNC in support of the network of natural heritage programs. In 2001, ABI changed its name to [[NatureServe]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.natureserve.org/about-us/our-history NatureServe History], The history of the Virginia-based conservation non-profit NatureServe.&lt;/ref&gt; NatureServe continues to serve as the hub of the NatureServe Network, a collaboration of 86 governmental and non-governmental programs including natural heritage programs and conservation data centers located in the United States, Canada, and Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.natureserve.org/natureserve-network About the NatureServe Network]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal status==

An important site of natural heritage or [[cultural heritage]] can be listed as a [[World Heritage Site]] by the [[World Heritage Committee]] of [[UNESCO]].  The UNESCO programme, catalogues, names, and conserves sites of outstanding cultural or natural importance to the common heritage of humanity.  As of March 2012, there are 936 World Heritage Sites: 725 cultural, 183 natural, and 28 mixed properties, in 153 countries.

The 1972 UNESCO World Heritage Convention established that biological resources, such as plants, were the [[common heritage of mankind]] or as was expressed in the preamble: "need to be preserved as part of the world heritage of mankind as a whole.". These rules probably inspired the creation of great public banks of genetic resources, located outside the source-countries.

New global agreements (e.g., the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]]), now give sovereign national rights over biological resources (not property). The idea of static  conservation of biodiversity is disappearing and being replaced by the idea of dynamic conservation, through the notion of resource and  innovation.

The new agreements commit countries to conserve biodiversity, develop resources for sustainability and share the benefits resulting from their use. Under new rules, it is expected  that [[bioprospecting]] or collection of natural products has to be allowed by  the biodiversity-rich country, in exchange for a share of the  benefits.

In 2005, the [[World Heritage Marine Programme]] was established to protect marine areas with Outstanding Universal Values.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10448">The '''Orton-Gillingham''' Approach to [[Reading (activity)|reading]] instruction was developed in the early-20th century.

It is language-based, multisensory, structured, sequential, cumulative, [[cognitive]], and flexible.&lt;ref&gt;The structured flexibility of Orton-GillinghamBB Sheffield - Annals of Dyslexia, 1991 - Springer&lt;/ref&gt;

The Orton-Gillingham Approach has been in use since the 1930s.  An intensive, sequential [[phonics]]-based system teaches the basics of word formation before whole meanings. The method accommodates and utilizes three learning modalities, or pathways, through which people learn&amp;mdash;visual, auditory and kinesthetic. Unlike some scripted and rigid reading programs, the Orton-Gillingham Approach is a system that allows for flexibility.

== Orton and Gillingham ==

[[Samuel Orton|Samuel Torrey Orton]] (1879&amp;ndash;1948), a neuropsychiatrist and [[pathologist]] at [[Columbia University]], brought together neuroscientific information and principles of remediation. As early as the 1920s, he had extensively studied children with the kind of language processing difficulties now commonly associated with [[dyslexia]] and had formulated a set of teaching principles and practices for such children.

[[Anna Gillingham]] (1878&amp;ndash;1963) was an [[educator]] and [[psychologist]] at Teachers College, [[Columbia University]].  Working with Dr. Orton, she trained teachers and compiled and published instructional materials. Gillingham combined Orton’s teaching methods with her analysis of the structure of the English/American language and with Bessie Stillman, she wrote what has become the Orton–Gillingham manual: Remedial Training for Children with Specific Disability in Reading, Spelling and Penmanship. First published in 1935/6, this work is updated and republished regularly.

== Features of the Approach ==

'''Language-based''': The Orton-Gillingham approach is based on a technique of studying and teaching language, understanding the nature of human language, the mechanisms involved in learning, and the language-learning processes in individuals.

'''Multisensory''': Orton-Gillingham teaching sessions are action-oriented and involve constant interaction between the teacher and the student and the simultaneous use of multiple sensory input channels reinforcing each other for optimal learning. Using auditory, visual, and kinesthetic elements, all language skills taught are reinforced by having the student listen, speak, read and write. For example, a dyslexic learner is taught to see the letter A, say its name and sound and write it in the air – all at the same time. The approach requires intense instruction with ample practice.
The use of multiple input channels is thought to enhance memory storage and retrieval by providing multiple "triggers" for memory.&lt;ref&gt;Sherman, Gordon. Can Neuroscience Help to Demystify Dyslexia?  Schwab Learning. Retrieved from http://www.schwablearning.org/articles.aspx?r=430 October 8, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Structured, Sequential, and Cumulative''': The Orton-Gillingham teacher introduces the elements of the language systematically. Sound-symbol associations along with linguistic rules and generalizations are introduced in a linguistically logical, understandable order.  Students begin by reading and writing sounds in isolation. Then they blend the sounds into syllables and words. Students learn the elements of language—consonants, vowels, [[Digraph (orthography)|digraphs]], blends, and [[diphthongs]]&amp;mdash;in an orderly fashion. They then proceed to advanced structural elements such as syllable types, roots, and affixes. As students learn new material, they continue to review old material to the level of automaticity. The teacher addresses vocabulary, sentence structure, composition, and reading comprehension in a similar structured, sequential, and cumulative manner.

'''Cognitive''': Students learn about the history of the [[English language]] and study the many generalizations and rules that govern its structure. They also learn how best they can learn and apply the language knowledge necessary for achieving reading and writing competencies.

'''Flexible''': Orton-Gillingham teaching is diagnostic and prescriptive in nature. Teachers try to ensure the learner is not simply recognising a pattern and applying it without understanding. When confusion of a previously taught rule is discovered, it is re-taught from the beginning.

== Research support ==
In 2000, the National Reading Panel included the Orton-Gillingham method in their study, "Teaching Children to Read: An Evidence-Based Assessment of the Scientific Research Literature on Reading and Its Implications for Reading Instruction."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Langengerg, Ph.D|first1=Daniel|title=Teaching Children to Read: An Evidence-Based Assessment of the Scientific Research Literature on Reading and Its Implications for Reading Instruction|url=https://www.nichd.nih.gov/publications/pubs/nrp/documents/report.pdf|website=National Reading Panel|accessdate=26 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Panel supported the significance of offering classroom instruction in phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary, and comprehension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hughes|first1=S.|title=The Orton-Gillingham Language Approach - A Research Review|date=10 February 2014|page=7|url=http://www.nessy.com/us/files/2014/06/Orton-Gillingham_Report-Final-Version.pdf|accessdate=26 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Florida Center for Reading Research reported in 2006 that it was unable to identify any empirical studies examining the efficacy of the approach specifically as described in Orton-Gillingham training materials. Thus there was no direct research evidence to determine its effectiveness, although there are a variety of  studies of derivative methods that incorporate aspects of Orton-Gillingham in combination with other techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

An overview of all reported studies of Orton-Gillingham derivative methods, such as Alphabetic Phonics or Project Read, revealed only a dozen studies with inconsistent results and a variety of methodological flaws. Despite these conclusions, the article does provide a detailed overview of the available research, which viewed most favorably would show some evidence of benefit from [[classroom]] use of OG methods with first graders, and use in [[special education]] or [[resource room]] settings with older children with [[learning disabilities]].&lt;ref name=Ritchey2006&gt;{{cite journal

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11651">The '''Osborne effect''' is a [[social phenomenon]] of customers canceling or deferring orders for the current soon-to-be-obsolete product as an [[unintended consequences|unexpected drawback]] of a company's announcing a future product prematurely.

The term was coined after the [[Osborne Computer Corporation]], in which the company took more than a year to make its next product available and eventually ran out of cash and went bankrupt in 1985.&lt;ref name="hyper"&gt;{{cite book | isbn=0-918347-00-9 | last1=Osborne |first1= Adam | first2=John C. | last2=Dvorak| author2-link=John C. Dvorak | year=1984 | title=Hypergrowth: the rise and fall of Osborne Computer Corporation | publisher=Idthekkethan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="standards"&gt;{{cite book | isbn=0-19-828807-7 | title=Standards, strategy and policy: cases and stories | first=Peter | last=Grindley | year=1985 | publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pre-announcement is done for several reasons: to reassure current customers that there is improvement or lower cost coming, to increase the interest of the media and investors in the company's future prospects, and to intimidate or confuse competitors. When done correctly, the sales or cash flow impact to the company is minimal, as the revenue drop for the current product is offset by orders or completed sales of the new product as it becomes available. However, when the Osborne effect occurs, the quantity of unsold goods increases and the company must react by either discounting or lowering production of the current product, both of which depress cash flow.

==Description==
&lt;!-- This section is directly linked from other articles. Do not change the title without finding and fixing all articles that link to it first. --&gt;
The Osborne Effect states that prematurely discussing future, unavailable products damages sales of existing products. The name comes from the planned replacement of the [[Osborne 1]], an early personal computer first sold by the [[Osborne Computer Corporation]] in 1981. In 1983, founder [[Adam Osborne]] pre-announced several next-generation computer models (the "[[Osborne Executive]]" and "[[Osborne Vixen]]"), which had not yet been built, highlighting the fact that they would outperform the existing model. A widely held belief was that sales of the Osborne 1 fell sharply as customers anticipated those more advanced systems, leading to a sales decline from which Osborne Computer was unable to recover. This belief appeared in the media almost immediately after the company's September 1983 bankruptcy:{{r|ahl198403}}

{{quote|To give the jazzy $2495 Osborne Executive a running start, Adam began orchestrating publicity early in 1983. We, along with many other magazines, were shown the machine in locked hotel rooms. We were required not to have anything in print about it until the planned release date in mid-April. As far as we know, nothing did appear in print, but dealers heard about the plans and cancelled orders for the Osborne 1 in droves.

In early April, Osborne told dealers he would be showing them the machine on a one-week tour the week of 17 April, and emphasized that the new machine was not a competitor for the Osborne 1. But dealers didn't react the way Osborne expected; said Osborne, "All of them just cancelled their orders for the Osborne 1."}}

Osborne reacted by drastically cutting prices on the Osborne 1 in an effort to stimulate cash flow. But nothing seemed to work, and for several months sales were practically non-existent.&lt;ref name="ahl198403"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.atarimagazines.com/creative/v10n3/24_Osborne_Comptuer_Corporat.php | title=Osborne Computer Corporation | accessdate=4 April 2011 | author=Ahl, David H. | date=March 1984 | work=Creative Computing | publisher=Ziff-Davis | pages=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Osborne myth==
Interviews with former employees cast doubt on the idea that Osborne's downfall was caused solely by announcement ahead of availability.&lt;ref name="pbs"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Osborne Effect|work=The Osborne Effect: Sometimes What Everyone Remembers Is Wrong | url=https://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/2005/pulpit_20050616_000856.html | accessdate=25 November 2009 | date=16 June 2005 | publisher=PBS | last=Cringely | first=Robert X. | authorlink=Robert X.

Cringely]] interviewed ex-Osborne employee Mike McCarthy and clarified the story behind the "Osborne effect". Purportedly, the new Executive model from Osborne Computer was priced at US$2,195 and came with a {{convert|7|in|mm|sigfig=3|adj=on}} screen, while competitor [[Kaypro]] was selling a computer with a {{convert|9|in|mm|sigfig=3|adj=on}} screen for US$400 less. The Kaypro machine had already begun to cut into sales of the Osborne 1, a computer with a {{convert|5|in|mm|sigfig=3|adj=on}} screen for US$1,995. After inventories of the Osborne 1 cleared out, monthly sales of the Executive were less than a tenth of the previous model, as customers switched to Kaypro.

On 20 June 2005, ''[[The Register]]'' quoted Osborne's memoirs and interviewed Osborne repairman Charles Eicher to tell a tale of corporate decisions that led to the company's demise.&lt;ref name="register" /&gt; Apparently, while sales of the new model were relatively slow, they were starting to show a profit. Then, a vice president discovered that there was an inventory of fully equipped motherboards for the older models, worth US$150,000. Rather than discard the motherboards, the vice president sold Osborne leadership on the idea of building them into complete units and selling them. Soon US$2 million, far more money than anybody anticipated, and more than the company could afford at that time, was spent to turn the motherboards into completed units: for CRTs, RAM, floppy disk drives, and to restore production and fabricate the molded cases. In his autobiography, Osborne described this as a case of "throwing good money after bad".&lt;ref name="register"/&gt; It was then that the company folded due to debt.

==Other examples==
In 1978, [[North Star Computers]] announced a new version of their floppy disk controller, which had double the capacity, to be sold at the same price as their existing range. Sales of the existing products plummeted and the company almost went bankrupt.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Orlowski, [https://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/06/20/no_osborne_effect_at_osborne/ "Taking Osborne out of the Osborne Effect"], ''The Register'', 20 June 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  Other consumer electronics products have been continually been plagued by Osborne Effect as well.  In the early 1990's TV set sales were depressed by talk of the imminent release of HDTV, which did not actually become widespread for another 10 years. 

When [[Sega]] began publicly discussing their next-generation system (eventually released as the [[Dreamcast]]), barely two years after launching the [[Sega Saturn|Saturn]], it became a [[self-defeating prophecy]]. This move, combined with Sega's recent history of short-lived consoles, particularly the [[Sega Mega-CD]] and [[Sega 32X|32X]] which were considered ill-conceived "stopgaps" that turned off gamers and developers alike, led to a chain reaction that quickly caused the Saturn's future to collapse. Immediately following the announcement, sales of the console and software substantially tapered off in the second half of 1997, while many planned games were canceled, causing the console's life expectancy to shorten substantially. While this let Sega focus on bringing out its successor, premature demise of the Saturn caused customers and developers to be skeptical and hold out, which led to the Dreamcast's demise as well.&lt;ref&gt;Jason Perlow, [http://www.zdnet.com/photos/osborne-effects-death-by-pre-announcement_p4/6370842 "Osborne effects: Death by pre-announcement"], ''ZDNet'', 21 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example of the Osborne Effect took place as a result of [[Nokia]] CEO [[Stephen Elop]]'s implementation of the plan to shift away from [[Symbian]] to [[Windows Phone]] for its mobile software platform. On top of this, criticism of existing products was compared to the [[Gerald Ratner|Ratner Effect]]. These two together led to the coining of the term "Elop Effect", to describe the combination of both premature announcement and negative comments on existing products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ahonen |first=Tomi T. |title=Coining Term: "Elop Effect" when you combine Osborne Effect and Ratner Effect |work=Communities Dominate Brands |date=2011-08-11 |url= http://communities-dominate.blogs.com/brands/2011/08/coining-term-elop-effect-when-you-combine-osborne-effect-and-ratner-effect.html |accessdate=2011-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://communities-dominate.blogs.com/brands/2011/08/coining-term-elop-effect-when-you-combine-osborne-effect-and-ratner-effect.html Communities Dominate Brands: Coining Term: "Elop Effect" when you combine Osborne Effect and Ratner Effect&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Although it was known for some time that Nokia's Symbian phones were no longer competitive against [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]], they still generated significant profit thanks to Nokia's brand recognition until Elop's announcement "effectively transformed the Symbian cash-cow into a dead duck". At the same time, Nokia's first Windows Phone devices would not be ready for a year, and once they were released their sales were not enough to replace the volume and profit of Symbian devices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://crave.cnet.co.uk/mobiles/nokias-windows-phone-bear-hug-is-choking-the-mighty-finn-50007750/ Nokia's Windows Phone "bear hug" is choking the Mighty Finn - CNET&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the announcement that [[Windows Phone 7]] devices would not be able to upgrade to [[Windows Phone 8]] hurt sales of Nokia's WP7 phones, plus it was a risky move for [[Microsoft]] which "can ill afford to alienate people when there are scores of highly capable and affordable Android phones up for grabs. Or years-old Apple [[iPhone]]s which aren't being prematurely shut out of the iOS playground."&lt;ref&gt;Natasha Lomas, "[http://crave.cnet.co.uk/mobiles/windows-phone-8-sucker-punches-windows-phone-fans-50008345/ Windows Phone 8 sucker punches Windows Phone fans]" [[CNET]], 21 June 2012.

[[MakerBot]] appears to have fallen victim to the Osborne effect: talking openly about a future product significantly reduced the sales of their current product.&lt;ref&gt;Jason Huggins (April 2015), ''[http://www.hugs.io/2015/04/18/makerbot-and-the-osborne-effect.html What Doomed MakerBot?

The major distinguishing symptom of acquired phonological dyslexia is that a selective impairment of the ability to read pronounceable non-words occurs although the ability to read familiar words is not affected.

==Deep and phonological dyslexia==

Individuals who suffer from phonological dyslexia have the opposite problem to surface dyslexics. These individuals are able to read using the [[Reading education in the United States#Whole Language|whole word method]]. However, they struggle when it comes to [[Reading education in the United States#Phonics|sounding words out]]. Phonological dyslexics are able to read familiar words, but have difficulties when it comes to unfamiliar words or non-words that are pronounceable.&lt;ref name="Beauvois, 1979"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Beauvois MF, Dérouesné J |title=Phonological alexia: three dissociations |journal=J. Neurol. Neurosurg. Psychiatry |volume=42 |issue=12 |pages=1115–24 |date=December 1979 |pmid=533850 |pmc=490427 |doi= 10.1136/jnnp.42.12.1115|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several studies have found that many phonological dyslexics have a good reading ability if the individual has developed a large vocabulary prior to suffering from brain damage. These individuals seem to stop developing their vocabulary post-brain damage, which affects their reading capacity.&lt;ref name="Derouesne, 1979"/&gt;

Phonological dyslexia is a reading disorder in which the patient has impaired reading of nonwords. The symptoms of phonological dyslexia are very similar to those of [[deep dyslexia]]. The major difference between these two dyslexias is that phonological dyslexics do not make semantic errors associated with deep dyslexia. Beauvois and Dérouesné (1979) studied the first case of phonological dyslexia and came up with this term.&lt;ref name="Welbourne"&gt;{{Citation|title=Proceedings of the 28th Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science Society|author1=Welbourne S.R.|author2=Lambon Ralph M.A.|contribution= Phonological and Surface Dyslexia in a Single PDP Model of Reading|year=2006|pages=2359&amp;ndash;64|place=Mahwah, New Jersey|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|url=http://csjarchive.cogsci.rpi.edu/proceedings/2006/docs/p2359.pdf|isbn=9780976831822}}&lt;/ref&gt; The problem people with phonological dyslexia have is that they are able to read words using the whole word method; however, they are not able to sound words out. This means that they are able to read familiar words, but have difficulties reading new words.

Initially it was believed that the factor causing phonological dyslexia was lexicality; however, other factors such as imageability and concreteness also play a critical role in reading. A study done by Crisp and Lambon Ralph concluded that imageability has a significant effect on phonological dyslexia. The study found that eleven out of the twelve patients had more accuracy when reading words with high imageability.&lt;ref name="Welbourne" /&gt; In that study, the patient who was the exception was the least severely damaged, contributing to a view of phonological dyslexia and deep dyslexia as points on a continuum rather than discrete disorders.&lt;ref name="Welbourne" /&gt;

==Physiology==
Several studies have found that different levels of [[brain damage]] can lead to the occurrence of varying forms of non-word reading disorders.&lt;ref&gt;Berndt, R.S., Hawndiges, A.N., Mitchum, C. C., &amp; Wayland, S.C. (1996). An investigation of nonlexical reading impairments. Cognitive Neuropsychology, 13, 763-801.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Dérouesné, J |author2=Beauvois, M F. |chapter=The "phonemic" state in the non-lexical reading process: Evidence from a case of phonological alexia |editors=Coltheart, Max; Patterson, Karalyn; Marshall, John F. |title=Surface dyslexia: neuropsychological and cognitive studies of phonological reading |publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates |location=Hillsdale, N.J |year=1985 |pages= 399–457 |isbn=0-86377-026-6 |oclc=789357383 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been found that during certain tasks, dyslexics had activated one of two regions of the brain: the [[Broca's area]], which is responsible for speech, or the [[Wernicke's area]], which is responsible for forming and understanding. Both areas were seldom active together. This study has led to the conclusion that there exist neural connection breakdowns between the language centers that may be causing dyslexia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lishman WA |title=Developmental dyslexia |journal=J. Neurol. Neurosurg. Psychiatry |volume=74 |issue=12 |pages=1603–5 |date=December 2003 |pmid=14638872 |pmc=1757419 |doi= 10.1136/jnnp.74.12.1603|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hyphenation==
An investigation conducted by Harley, T. A., and O'Mara, D.A. (2006) found that [[Syllabification|hyphenation]] significantly improved a participant`s reading ability. The subject suffered from phonological dyslexia that was due to a deficiency in graphemic parsing. The study suggested that hyphenation might be generally useful as a strategy to assist phonological dyslexics.&lt;ref name="Harley, O'Mara, 2006"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Harley |first1=Trevor A. |last2=O'Mara|first2=David A.|title=Hyphenation can improve reading in acquired phonological dyslexia |journal=Aphasiology |volume=20|issue=8 |year=2006 |pages=744–761 |issn=0268-7038|doi=10.1080/02687030600591658}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Case study==
A study was done by Beauvois and Dérouesné on a 64-year-old man. The individual is described as right-handed, a retiree, and having formerly been an agricultural machinery representative. The individual had had surgery for a left parieto-occipital [[angioma]]. Scans showed a lesion at the left angular gyrus, the posterior part of the second temporal convolution, the [[inferior longitudinal fasciculus]], the geniculostriate fibres and [[tapetum of corpus callosum|tapetum]]. The patient was also found to be suffering from neurological defects such as right inferior quadrantanopia, mild memory deficit, mild calculation impairment, minimal constructional apraxia, and [[astereognosia]]. It was found that the patient did not suffer from motor or sensory defects. He had been obliged to retire as the phonological dyslexia disrupted his ability to work. He had previously enjoyed reading, but was now unable to read his own or other pieces of writing. The diagnosis was confirmed with the Alouette reading test, which concluded that the patient suffered from a reading disability. He was found to have the reading ability of a 6-year-old child, which is considered to be the lowest reading level. The level of reading was not determined from the speed, rather from the fact that the patient was not able to read more than 62 of the stimuli presented in three minutes, while 40% of the represented stimuli were either read incorrectly or left unread. The reading errors included [[adjectives]], [[possessive adjectives]], [[conjunctions]] and [[verbs]].&lt;ref name="Beauvois, 1979"/&gt;

==The dual route cascaded model==
Patients with phonological dyslexia have problem reading non-words and unfamiliar words. According to the dual route model, patients with phonological dyslexia use route 2 or 3 that have intact orthographic input lexicon which allow them to pronounce familiar words whether regular or irregular. However due to phonological dyslexia they are unable to use grapheme-phoneme conversion (Route 1), as route 1 is impaired, thus patients find it difficult to pronounce unfamiliar words and non-words.

The '''Post correspondence problem''' is an [[undecidable problem|undecidable]] [[decision problem]] that was introduced by [[Emil Post]] in 1946.&lt;ref name="Post46"&gt;{{cite journal|year = 1946|author = [[Emil Post|E. L. Post]]| title= A variant of a recursively unsolvable problem |journal = Bull. Amer. Math. Soc.| volume =  52|url=http://www.ams.org/bull/1946-52-04/S0002-9904-1946-08555-9/S0002-9904-1946-08555-9.pdf|doi=10.1090/s0002-9904-1946-08555-9|pages=264–269}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because it is simpler than the [[halting problem]] and the ''[[Entscheidungsproblem]]'' it is often used in proofs of undecidability.

== Definition of the problem ==

Let &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; be an alphabet with at least two symbols.  The input of the problem consists of two finite lists &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{1}, \ldots, \alpha_{N}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta_{1}, \ldots, \beta_{N}&lt;/math&gt; of words over &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. A solution to this problem is a [[sequence]] of indices &lt;math&gt;(i_k)_{1 \le k \le K}&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;K \ge 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; 1 \le i_k \le N&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, such that

: &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{i_1} \ldots \alpha_{i_K} = \beta_{i_1} \ldots \beta_{i_K}.&lt;/math&gt;

The decision problem then is to decide whether such a solution exists or not.

===Alternative definition===
 

:&lt;math&gt;g: (i_1,\ldots,i_K) \mapsto \alpha_{i_1} \ldots \alpha_{i_K}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;h: (i_1,\ldots,i_K) \mapsto \beta_{i_1} \ldots \beta_{i_K}.&lt;/math&gt;

This gives rise to an equivalent alternative definition often found in the literature, according to which any two homomorphisms &lt;math&gt;g,h&lt;/math&gt; with a common domain and a common codomain form an instance of the Post correspondence problem, which now asks whether there exists a nonempty word &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; in the domain such that

:&lt;math&gt;g(w)=h(w)&lt;/math&gt;.

== Example instances of the problem ==

===Example 1===
Consider the following two lists:
{{col-begin|width=auto}}
{{col-break}}
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center;background:#55FF83;font-style:italic;"
|-style="font-weight:bold;"
|width=40 | α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
|width=40 | α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
|width=40 | α&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
|-
|a
|ab
|bba
|}
{{col-break|gap=5px|align=center}}
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center;background:#87E6FF;font-style:italic;"
|-style="font-weight:bold;"
|width=40 | β&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
|width=40 | β&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
|width=40 | β&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
|-
|baa
|aa
|bb
|}
{{col-end}}
A solution to this problem would be the sequence (3, 2, 3, 1), because

: &lt;math&gt;\alpha_3 \alpha_2 \alpha_3 \alpha_1 = bba \cdot ab \cdot bba \cdot a = bbaabbbaa = bb \cdot aa \cdot bb \cdot baa = \beta_{3} \beta_{2} \beta_{3} \beta_{1}.&lt;/math&gt;

Furthermore, since (3, 2, 3, 1) is a solution, so are all of its "repetitions", such as (3, 2, 3, 1, 3, 2, 3, 1), etc.; that is, when a solution exists, there are infinitely many solutions of this repetitive kind.

However, if the two lists had consisted of only &lt;math&gt;\alpha_2, \alpha_3&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta_{2}, \beta_{3}&lt;/math&gt; from those sets, then there would have been no solution (the last letter of any such α string is not the same as the letter before it, whereas β only constructs pairs of the same letter).

A convenient way to view an instance of a Post correspondence problem is as a collection of blocks of the form
{{col-begin|width=auto}}  
{{col-break}}
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;"
| bgcolor="#55FF83" width="40" | α&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;
|-
| bgcolor="#87E6FF" width="40" | β&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;
|}
{{col-end}}
there being an unlimited supply of each type of block. Thus the above example is viewed as
{{col-begin|width=auto}}
{{col-break|align=center}}
{| class="wikitable" style="font-style:italic;text-align:center;"
| bgcolor="#55FF83" width="40" | a
|-
| bgcolor="#87E6FF" width="40" | baa
|}
''i = 1''
{{col-break|gap=5px|align=center}}
{| class="wikitable" style="font-style:italic;text-align:center;"
| bgcolor="#55FF83" width="40" | ab
|-
| bgcolor="#87E6FF" width="40" | aa
|}
''i = 2''
{{col-break|gap=5px|align=center}}
{| class="wikitable" style="font-style:italic;text-align:center;"
| bgcolor="#55FF83" width="40" | bba
|-
| bgcolor="#87E6FF" width="40" | bb
|}
''i = 3''
{{col-end}}
where the solver has an endless supply of each of these three block types. A solution corresponds to some way of laying blocks next to each other so that the string in the top cells corresponds to the string in the bottom cells. Then the solution to the above example corresponds to:
{{col-begin|width=auto}}
{{col-break|align=center}}
{| class="wikitable" style="font-style:italic;text-align:center;"
| bgcolor="#55FF83" width="40" | bba
|-
| bgcolor="#87E6FF" width="40" | bb
|}
''i&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 3''
{{col-break|gap=5px|align=center}}
{| class="wikitable" style="font-style:italic;text-align:center;"
| bgcolor="#55FF83" width="40" | ab
|-
| bgcolor="#87E6FF" width="40" | aa
|}
''i&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 2''
{{col-break|gap=5px|align=center}}
{| class="wikitable" style="font-style:italic;text-align:center;"
| bgcolor="#55FF83" width="40" | bba
|-
| bgcolor="#87E6FF" width="40" | bb
|}
''i&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = 3''
{{col-break|gap=5px|align=center}}
{| class="wikitable" style="font-style:italic;text-align:center;"
| bgcolor="#55FF83" width="40" | a
|-
| bgcolor="#87E6FF" width="40" | baa
|}
''i&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; = 1''

===Example 2===
Again using blocks to represent an instance of the problem, the following is an example that has infinitely many solutions in addition to the kind obtained by merely "repeating" a solution.

{{col-begin|width=auto}}
{{col-break|align=center}}
{| class="wikitable" style="font-style:italic;text-align:center;"
| bgcolor="#55FF83" width="40" | bb

''3''
{{col-end}}

In this instance, every sequence of the form (1, 2, 2, . . ., 2, 3) is a solution (in addition to all their repetitions):

==Proof sketch of undecidability ==

The most common proof for the undecidability of PCP describes an instance of PCP that can simulate the computation of an arbitrary [[Turing machine]] on a particular input. A match will occur if and only if the input would be accepted by the Turing machine. Because [[Halting problem|deciding if a Turing machine will accept an input is a basic undecidable problem]], PCP cannot be decidable either. The following discussion is based on [[Michael Sipser]]'s textbook ''Introduction to the Theory of Computation''.&lt;ref name="sipser05"&gt;{{cite book|author = [[Michael Sipser]] | year = 2005 | title = Introduction to the Theory of Computation | edition = 2nd | publisher = Thomson Course Technology | isbn = 0-534-95097-3 | chapter = A Simple Undecidable Problem | pages = 199&amp;ndash;205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In more detail, the idea is that the string along the top and bottom will be a [[computation history]] of the Turing machine's computation. This means it will list a string describing the initial state, followed by a string describing the next state, and so on until it ends with a string describing an accepting state. The state strings are separated by some separator symbol (usually written #). According to the definition of a Turing machine, the full state of the machine consists of three parts:
* The current contents of the tape.
* The current state of the [[finite state machine]] which operates the tape head.
* The current position of the tape head on the tape.
Although the tape has infinitely many cells, only some finite prefix of these will be non-blank. We write these down as part of our state. To describe the state of the finite control, we create new symbols, labelled ''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; through ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;, for each of the finite state machine's ''k'' states. We insert the correct symbol into the string describing the tape's contents at the position of the tape head, thereby indicating both the tape head's position and the current state of the finite control. For the alphabet {0,1}, a typical state might look something like:

101101110''q''&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;00110.

A simple computation history would then look something like this:

''q''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;101#1''q''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;01#11''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;1#1''q''&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;10.

We start out with this block, where ''x'' is the input string and ''q''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the start state:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center;"
| bgcolor="#55FF83" width="40" | &amp;nbsp;
|-
| bgcolor="#87E6FF" width="40" | ''q''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''x''#
|}

The top starts out "lagging" the bottom by one state, and keeps this lag  until the very end stage. Next, for each symbol ''a'' in the tape alphabet, as well as #, we have a "copy" block, which copies it unmodified from one state to the next:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center;"
| bgcolor="#55FF83" width="40" | ''a''
|-
| bgcolor="#87E6FF" width="40" | ''a''
|}

We also have a block for each position transition the machine can make, showing how the tape head moves, how the finite state changes, and what happens to the surrounding symbols. For example, here the tape head is over a 0 in state 4, and then writes a 1 and moves right, changing to state 7:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center;"
| bgcolor="#55FF83" width="40" | ''q''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;0
|-
| bgcolor="#87E6FF" width="40" | 1''q''&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;
|}

Finally, when the top reaches an accepting state, the bottom needs a chance to finally catch up to complete the match. To allow this, we extend the computation so that once an accepting state is reached, each subsequent machine step will cause a symbol near the tape head to vanish, one at a time, until none remain. If ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt; is an accepting state, we can represent this with the following transition blocks, where ''a'' is a tape alphabet symbol:

{{col-begin|width=auto}}
{{col-break|align=center}}
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center;"
| bgcolor="#55FF83" width="40" | ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt;''a''
|-
| bgcolor="#87E6FF" width="40" | ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt;
|}
{{col-break|gap=5px|align=center}}
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center;"
| bgcolor="#55FF83" width="40" | ''aq''&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt;
|-
| bgcolor="#87E6FF" width="40" | ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt;
|}
{{col-end}}

There are a number of details to work out, such as dealing with boundaries between states, making sure that our initial tile goes first in the match, and so on, but this shows the general idea of how a static tile puzzle can simulate a Turing machine computation.

The previous example

''q''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;101#1''q''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;01#11''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;1#1''q''&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;10.

== Variants ==

Many variants of PCP have been considered. One reason is that, when one tries to prove undecidability of some new problem by reducing from PCP, it often happens that the first reduction one finds is not from PCP itself but from an apparently weaker version. Also note that if one removes ''correspondence'', the [https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/4284/post-correspondence-problem-variant problem becomes decidable].

* The problem may be phrased in terms of [[monoid morphism]]s ''f'', ''g'' from the free monoid ''B''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt; to the free monoid ''A''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt; where ''B'' is of size ''n''.  The problem is to determine whether there is a word ''w'' in ''B''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; such that ''f''(''w'') = ''g''(''w'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Arto | last=Salomaa | authorlink=Arto Salomaa | title=Jewels of Formal Language Theory | publisher=Pitman Publishing | isbn=0-273-08522-0 | year=1981 | zbl=0487.68064 | pages=74–75 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The condition that the alphabet &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; have at least two symbols is required since the problem is decidable if &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; has only one symbol.
* A simple variant is to fix ''n'', the number of tiles. This problem is decidable if ''n'' ≤ 2, but remains undecidable for ''n'' ≥ 5. It is unknown whether the problem is decidable for 3 ≤ ''n'' ≤ 4.&lt;ref name="N15"&gt;{{cite conference|author = T. Neary|year=2015|title=Undecidability in Binary Tag Systems and the Post Correspondence Problem for Five Pairs of Words|conference=STACS 2015|book-title=32nd International Symposium on Theoretical Aspects of Computer Science (STACS 2015)|editor=Ernst W. Mayr and Nicolas Ollinger|publisher=Schloss Dagstuhl–Leibniz-Zentrum fuer Informatik|volume=30|pages=649–661|doi=10.4230/LIPIcs.STACS.2015.649|url=http://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2015/4948/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The '''''circular'' Post correspondence problem''' asks whether indexes &lt;math&gt;i_1, i_2,\ldots&lt;/math&gt; can be found such that &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{i_1} \cdots \alpha_{i_k}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta_{i_1} \cdots \beta_{i_k}&lt;/math&gt; are [[conjugacy|conjugate words]], i.e., they are equal modulo rotation. This variant is undecidable.&lt;ref name="Ruohonen83"&gt;{{cite journal|author= K. Ruohonen |year =1983|title=On some variants of Post's correspondence problem|publisher=Springer|volume=19|issue=4|pages=357&amp;ndash;367|journal=Acta Informatica | doi = 10.1007/BF00290732}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* One of the most important variants of PCP is the '''''bounded'' Post correspondence problem''', which asks if we can find a match using no more than ''k'' tiles, including repeated tiles. A brute force search solves the problem in time O(2&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;), but this may be difficult to improve upon, since the problem is [[NP-complete]].&lt;ref name="GJ79"&gt;{{cite book|author = [[Michael R. Garey]]|author2=[[David S. Johnson]]  | year = 1979 | title = [[Computers and Intractability: A Guide to the Theory of NP-Completeness]] | publisher = W.H. Freeman | isbn = 0-7167-1045-5 | page = 228 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike some NP-complete problems like the [[boolean satisfiability problem]], a small variation of the bounded problem was also shown to be complete for RNP, which means that it remains hard even if the inputs are chosen at random (it is hard on average over uniformly distributed inputs).&lt;ref name="Gurevich91"&gt;{{cite journal|author = Y. Gurevich|journal = J. Comp. Sys. Sci.|year = 1991|pages = 346–398|volume=42|title= Average case completeness|publisher=Elsevier Science|doi = 10.1016/0022-0000(91)90007-R|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Another variant of PCP is called the '''''marked'' Post Correspondence Problem''', in which each &lt;math&gt;\alpha_i&lt;/math&gt; must begin with a different symbol, and each &lt;math&gt;\beta_i&lt;/math&gt; must also begin with a different symbol. Halava, Hirvensalo, and de Wolf showed that this variation is decidable in [[EXPTIME|exponential time]]. Moreover, they showed that if this requirement is slightly loosened so that only one of the first two characters need to differ (the so-called 2-marked Post Correspondence Problem), the problem becomes undecidable again.&lt;ref name="HHW01"&gt;{{cite journal|author = V. Halava |author2=M. Hirvensalo |author3=R. de Wolf|year=2001|title=Marked PCP is decidable|journal=Theor. Comput. Sci.|publisher=Elsevier Science|volume=255|pages=193–204|doi=10.1016/S0304-3975(99)00163-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The '''Post Embedding Problem''' is another variant where one looks for indexes &lt;math&gt;i_1, i_2, \ldots&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{i_1} \cdots \alpha_{i_k}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[substring|(scattered) subword]] of &lt;math&gt;\beta_{i_1} \cdots \beta_{i_k}&lt;/math&gt;. This variant is easily decidable since, when some solutions exist, in particular  a length-one solution exists. More interesting is the '''''Regular'' Post Embedding Problem''', a further variant where one looks for solutions  that belong to a given regular language (submitted, e.g., under the form of a regular expression on the set &lt;math&gt;\{1,\ldots,N\}&lt;/math&gt;). The Regular Post Embedding Problem is still decidable but,  because of the added regular constraint, it has a very high complexity that dominates every multiply recursive function.&lt;ref name="CS07"&gt;{{cite journal|author = P. Chambart|author2=Ph. Schnoebelen|title = Post embedding problem is not primitive recursive, with applications to channel systems|year = 2007|journal = Lecture Notes in Computer Science|volume =4855|pages=265–276|publisher=Springer|doi=10.1007/978-3-540-77050-3_22|series = Lecture Notes in Computer Science|isbn = 978-3-540-77049-7|url=http://www.lsv.ens-cachan.fr/Publis/PAPERS/PDF/CS-fsttcs07.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The '''Identity Correspondence Problem''' (ICP) asks whether a finite set of pairs of words (over a group alphabet) can generate an identity pair by a sequence of concatenations. The problem is undecidable and equivalent to the following Group Problem:  is the semigroup generated by a finite set of pairs of words (over a group alphabet) a group.&lt;ref name="BP10"&gt;{{cite journal|author = Paul C.

'''''Principles of Criminology''''', written by [[Edwin H. Sutherland]] and [[Donald R. Cressey]], is hailed as the most authoritative work in the field of [[criminology]].&lt;ref name="Obit"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/28/obituaries/prof-donald-r-cressey-68-expert-on-sociology-of-crime.html "Prof. Donald R. Cressey, 68, Expert on Sociology of Crime." ''New York Times.'' July 28, 1987.]&lt;/ref&gt; The first edition was published in 1934, although it was derived from a previous publication, ''Criminology'' (1924). The 1934 edition contained a paragraph claiming that crime is brought about by a conflict of behaviours that originate from different cultures. This was the seed of Sutherland's theory of [[differential association]], which was fully developed in the fourth edition, published in 1947.

Further editions of the book were published after Sutherland's death in 1950 by Cressey and D. F. Luckenbill as co-authors.

[[Image:Aristoteles Louvre.jpg|thumb|right|[[Bust (sculpture)|Bust]] of [[Aristotle]], Greek philosopher]]
For many philosophers, both ancient and modern, man is regarded as the "representational animal" or ''[[animal symbolicum]]'', the creature whose distinct character is the creation and the manipulation of signs – things that "stand for" or "take the place of" something else.&lt;ref name=Mitchell1995/&gt;&lt;!--p. 11--&gt;

Representation has been associated with [[aesthetics]] (art) and [[semiotics]] (signs). Mitchell says "representation is an extremely elastic notion, which extends all the way from a stone representing a man to [[Ulysses (novel)|a novel]] representing the day in the life of several Dubliners".&lt;ref name=Mitchell1995/&gt;&lt;!--p. 13--&gt;
 
The term 'representation' carries a range of meanings and interpretations. In [[literary theory]], 'representation' is commonly defined in three ways. 
#To look like or resemble
#To stand in for something or someone
#To present a second time; to re-present&lt;ref name=Stadler2005&gt;O'Shaughnessy, M &amp; Stadler J, ''Media and society: an introduction'', 3rd edn, Oxford University Press, South Melbourne, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Representation began with early literary theory in the ideas of [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]], and has evolved into a significant component of language, [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussurian]] and [[communication]] studies.&lt;ref name=Stadler2005/&gt;

==Defining representation==
[[Image:Mona Lisa, by Leonardo da Vinci, from C2RMF retouched.jpg|thumb|right|''Reproduction of the [[Mona Lisa]]'']]
To represent is "to bring to mind by description," also "to symbolize, to be the embodiment of;" from O.Fr. representer (12c.), from L. repraesentare, from re-, intensive prefix, + praesentare "to present," lit. "to place before".

A representation is a type of recording in which the sensory information about a physical [[Object (philosophy)|object]] is described in a [[Media (arts)|medium]]. The degree to which an artistic representation ''resembles'' the object it represents is a function of resolution and does not bear on the denotation of the word. For example, both the [[Mona Lisa]] and a child's crayon drawing of [[Lisa del Giocondo]] would be considered representational, and any preference for one over the other would need to be understood as a matter of aesthetics.

==History==
[[Image:Tragic comic masks - roman mosaic.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Greek theatrical masks depicted in [[Hadrian]]s Villa mosaic'']]
Since ancient times representation has played a central role in understanding literature, aesthetics and semiotics. [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] are key figures in early literary theory who considered literature as simply one form of representation.&lt;ref name=Childers1995&gt;Childers J (ed.), ''Columbia Dictionary of Modern Literary and Cultural Criticism'', Columbia University Press, New York, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle for instance, considered each mode of representation, verbal, visual or musical, as being natural to human beings.&lt;ref name=Vukcevich2002&gt;&lt;Vukcevich, M 2002, "Representation", The University of Chicago, viewed 7 April 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, what distinguishes humans from other animals is their ability to create and manipulate signs.&lt;ref name=Mitchell1990&gt;Mitchell, W, "Representation", in F Lentricchia &amp; T McLaughlin (eds), ''Critical Terms for Literary Study'', University of Chicago Press, Chicago 1990&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle deemed mimesis as natural to man, therefore considered representations as necessary for people's learning and being in the world.&lt;ref name=Vukcevich2002/&gt; Plato, in contrast, looked upon representation with more caution. He recognised that literature is a representation of life, yet also believed that representations create worlds of illusion leading one away from the [[The Real|"real things"]].&lt;ref name=Hall1997&gt;Hall, S (ed.), ''Cultural Representations and Signifying Practice'', Open University Press, London, 1997.  {{ISBN|978-0761954323}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Plato, representation, like contemporary media, intervenes between the viewer and the real, creating illusions that lead one away from "real things". Plato believed that representation needs therefore, to be controlled and monitored due to the possible dangers resulting in its ability to foster antisocial emotions or encourage the imitation of evil.&lt;ref name=Mitchell1990/&gt;

Aristotle went on to say it was a definitively human activity.&lt;ref name=Mitchell1995/&gt;
From childhood man has an instinct for representation, and in this respect man differs from the other animals that he is far more imitative and learns his first lessons though imitating things.&lt;ref name=Mitchell1995/&gt;&lt;!--p. 11--&gt;
Aristotle discusses representation in three ways—
#'''The object:''' The symbol being represented.
#'''Manner:''' The way the symbol is represented.
#'''Means:''' The material that is used to represent it.
The '''means''' of literary representation is [[language]]. An important part of representation is the relationship between what the material and what it represents. The questions arising from this are, "A stone may represent a man but how? And by what and by what agreement, does this understanding of the representation occur?"&lt;ref name=Mitchell1995/&gt;

One apprehends reality only through representations of reality, through texts, discourses, images: there is no such thing as direct or unmediated access to reality. But because one can see reality only through representation it does not follow that one does not see reality at all… Reality is always more extensive and complicated than any system of representation can comprehend, and we always sense that this is so-representation never "gets" reality, which is why human history has produced so many and changing ways of trying to get it.&lt;ref name=Dryer1993&gt;Dryer 1993, cited in O’Shaughnessy &amp; Stadler 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--p. 3--&gt;

Consequently, throughout the history of human culture, people have become dissatisfied with language's ability to express reality and as a result have developed new modes of representation. It is necessary to construct new ways of seeing reality, as people only know reality through representation.&lt;ref name=Dryer1993/&gt; From this arises the contrasting and alternate theories and representational modes of abstraction, realism and modernism, to name a few.

==Contemporary ideas about representation==
It is from Plato’s caution that in the modern era many are aware of political and ideological issues and the influences of representations. It is impossible to divorce representations from culture and the society that produces them. In the contemporary world there exist restrictions on subject matter, limiting the kinds of representational signs allowed to be employed, as well as boundaries that limit the audience or viewers of particular representations. In [[motion picture rating system]]s, M and R rated films are an example of such restrictions, highlighting also society’s attempt to restrict and modify representations to promote a certain set of ideologies and values. Despite these restrictions, representations still have the ability to take on a life of their own once in the public sphere, and can not be given a definitive or concrete meaning; as there will always be a gap between intention and realization, original and copy.&lt;ref name=Mitchell1990/&gt;

Consequently, for each of the above definitions there exists a process of communication and message sending and receiving. In such a system of communication and representations it is inevitable that potential problems may arise; misunderstandings, errors, and falsehoods. The accuracy of the representations can by no means be guaranteed, as they operate in a system of signs that can never work in isolation from other signs or cultural factors. For instance, the interpretation and reading of representations function in the context of a body of rules for interpreting, and within a society many of these codes or conventions are informally agreed upon and have been established over a number of years. Such understandings however, are not set in stone and may alter between times, places, peoples and contexts. How though, does this ‘agreement’ or understanding of representation occur? It has generally been agreed by semioticians that representational relationships can be categorised into three distinct headings: icon, symbol and index.&lt;ref name=Mitchell1990/&gt;

For instance objects and people do not have a constant meaning, but their meanings are fashioned by humans in the context of their culture, as they have the ability to make things mean or signify something.&lt;ref name=Hall1997/&gt; Viewing representation in such a way focuses on understanding how language and systems of knowledge production work to create and circulate meanings. Representation is simply the process in which such meanings are constructed.&lt;ref name=Hall1997/&gt; In much the same way as the post-structuralists, this approach to representation considers it as something larger than any one single representation. A similar perspective is viewing representation as part of a larger field, as Mitchell, saying, "…representation (in memory, in verbal descriptions, in images) not only 'mediates' our knowledge (of slavery and of many other things), but obstructs, fragments, and negates that knowledge"&lt;ref name=Mitchell1994&gt;Mitchell, W, ''Picture Theory'', University of Chicago Press, Chicago, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--p188--&gt; and proposes a move away from the perspective that representations are merely "objects representing", towards a focus on the relationships and processes through which representations are produced, valued, viewed and exchanged.

==Peirce and representation==
[[Image:Charles Sanders Peirce.jpg|thumb|right|[[Charles Sanders Peirce]]]]
[[Charles Sanders Peirce]] (1839–1914) was an innovative and accomplished logician, mathematician, and scientist, and founded [[pragmatism|philosophical pragmatism]]. Peirce's central ideas were focused on [[logic]] and representation.

===Semiotics and logic===
Peirce distinguished philosophical logic as logic ''per se'' from mathematics of logic. He regarded logic (''per se'') as part of philosophy, as a normative field following esthetics and ethics, as more basic than metaphysics,&lt;ref&gt;On his classifications, see Peirce, C.S. (1903), CP 1.180–202 [http://www.princeton.edu/~batke/peirce/cl_o_sci_03.htm Eprint] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111105121054/http://www.princeton.edu/~batke/peirce/cl_o_sci_03.htm |date=2011-11-05 }} and (1906) "The Basis of Pragmaticism" in ''The Essential Peirce'' 2:372–3. For the relevant quotes, see "Philosophy" and "Logic" at ''[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/dictionary.html Commens Dictionary of Peirce's Terms]'', Bergman and Paavola, editors, U. of Helsinki.&lt;/ref&gt; and as the art of devising methods of research.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C.S., 1882, "Introductory Lecture on the Study of Logic" delivered September 1882, ''Johns Hopkins University Circulars'', vol. 2, no. 19, pp. 11–12, November 1892, ''Google Book Search'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=E0YFAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA11&amp;dq=%22art+of+devising+methods+of+research%22 Eprint]. Reprinted in ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'' v. 7, paragraphs 59–76, ''The Essential Peirce'' 1:214–214; ''Writings of Charles S. Peirce'' 4:378–382.&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that, more generally, as inference, "logic is rooted in the social principle", since inference depends on a standpoint that, in a sense, is unlimited.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C.S. (1878) "The Doctrine of Chances", ''Popular Science Monthly'', v. 12, pp. 604–615, 1878, reprinted in ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'', v. 2, paragraphs 645–668, ''Writings of Charles S. Peirce'' 3:276–290, and ''The Essential Peirce'' 1:142–154. "...death makes the number of our risks, the number of our inferences, finite, and so makes their mean result uncertain. The very idea of probability and of reasoning rests on the assumption that this number is indefinitely great. .... ...logicality inexorably requires that our interests shall not be limited. .... Logic is rooted in the social principle."&lt;/ref&gt;

Peirce held that logic is formal semiotic,&lt;ref name=L75&gt;Peirce, C. S. (written 1902), "MS L75: Logic, Regarded As Semeiotic (The Carnegie application of 1902): Version 1: An Integrated Reconstruction", Joseph Ransdell, ed., ''Arisbe'', see [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/l75/ver1/l75v1-05.htm#m12 Memoir 12].&lt;/ref&gt; the formal study of signs in the broadest sense, not only signs that are artificial, linguistic, or symbolic, but also signs that are semblances or are indexical such as reactions. He held that "all this universe is perfused with signs, if it is not composed exclusively of signs",&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C.S., ''The Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'', v. 5, paragraph 448 footnote, from "The Basis of Pragmaticism" in 1906.&lt;/ref&gt; along with their representational and inferential relations, interpretable by mind or ''quasi-mind'' (whatever works like a mind despite perhaps not actually being one);&lt;ref&gt;See "[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/quasimind.html Quasi-Mind]" at the ''Commens Dictionary of Peirce's Terms'', Mats Bergman and Sami Paavola, eds., University of Helsinki.&lt;/ref&gt; the focus here is on sign action in general, not psychology, linguistics, or social studies).

He argued that, since all thought takes time, "all thought is in signs"&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C.S. (1868), "Questions Concerning Certain Faculties Claimed for Man" (''Arisbe'' [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/question/qu-frame.htm Eprint]), ''Journal of Speculative Philosophy'' vol. 2, pp. 103–114. Reprinted (''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'', v. 5, paragraphs 213–263, the quote is from paragraph 253).&lt;/ref&gt; and sign processes ("[[semiosis]]") and that the three irreducible elements of semiosis are (1) the ''sign'' (or [[wiktionary:representamen|representamen]]), (2) the (semiotic) ''object'', the sign's subject matter, which the sign represents and which can be anything thinkable&amp;mdash;quality, brute fact, or law&amp;mdash;and even fictional ([[Prince Hamlet]]), and (3) the ''interpretant'' (or interpretant sign), which is the sign's meaning or ramification as formed into a kind of idea or effect that is a further sign, for example, a translation.&lt;ref&gt;For Peirce's definitions of semiosis, sign, representamen, object, interpretant, see the [http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/dictionary.html Commens Dictionary of Peirce's Terms]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Even when a sign represents by a resemblance or factual connection independent of interpretation, the sign is a sign because it is at least potentially interpretable. A sign depends on its object in a way that enables (and, in a sense, determines) interpretation, forming an interpretant which, in turn, depends on the sign and on the object ''as the sign depends on the object'' and is thus a further sign, enabling and determining still further interpretation, further interpretants. That essentially triadic process is logically structured to perpetuate itself and is what defines sign, object, and interpretant.

An object either (1) is ''immediate'' to a sign, and that is the object as represented in the sign, or (2) is a ''dynamic'' object, which is the object as it really is, on which the immediate object is founded. Usually, an object in question, such as Hamlet or the planet Neptune, is a special or partial object. A sign's total object is the object's [[universe of discourse]], the totality of things in that world to which one attributes the object. An interpretant is either (1) ''immediate'' to a sign, for example a word's usual meaning, a kind of interpretive quality or possibility present in the sign, or (2) ''dyanamic'', an actual interpretant, for example a state of agitation, or (3) ''final'' or ''normal'', a question's true settlement, which ''would'' be reached if thought or inquiry were pushed far enough, a kind of norm or ideal end with which any actual interpretant may, at most, coincide.

Peirce said that, in order to know to what a sign refers, the mind needs some sort of experience of the sign's object, experience outside, and collateral to, the given sign or sign system. In that context he spoke of collateral experience, collateral observation, collateral acquaintance, all in much the same terms.&lt;ref&gt;Ten quotes on collateral observation from Peirce provided by Professor Joseph Ransdell can be viewed [http://lyris.ttu.edu/read/messages?id=57101#57101 here]. Also see pp. 404–409 in "Pragmatism" by Peirce in ''The Essential Peirce'' v. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, art work can exploit both the richness and the limits of the audience's experience; a novelist, in disguising a ''[[roman à clef]]'', counts on the typical reader's lack of personal experience with the actual individual people portrayed. Then the reader refers the signs and interpretants in a general way to an object or objects of the kind that is represented (intentionally or otherwise) by the novel. In all cases, the object (be it a quality or fact or law or even fictional) determines the sign to an interpretant through one's collateral experience with the object, collateral experience in which the object is newly found or from which it is recalled, even if it is experience with an object of imagination as called into being by the sign, as can happen not only in fiction but in theories and mathematics, all of which can involve mental experimentation with the object under specifiable rules and constraints. Through collateral experience even a sign that consists in a chance semblance of an absent object is determined by that object.

Peirce held that logic has three main parts:
# '''Speculative grammar''',&lt;ref name=spec&gt;See "[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/grammarspec.html Grammar: Speculative]" in ''Commens Dictionary of Peirce's Terms''.&lt;/ref&gt; on meaningfulness, conditions for meaning. Study of significatory elements and combinations.
# '''Logical critic''',&lt;ref name=critic&gt;See "[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/critic.html Critic]" in ''Commens Dictionary of Peirce's Terms''.&lt;/ref&gt; on validity, conditions for true representation. Critique of arguments in their various distinct modes.
# '''Speculative rhetoric''', or methodeutic,&lt;ref name=methodeutic&gt;See "[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/methodeutic.html Methodeutic]" in ''Commens Dictionary of Peirce's Terms''.&lt;/ref&gt; on conditions for determining interpretations. Methodology of inquiry in its mutually interacting modes.

1. '''Speculative Grammar'''. By this, Peirce means discovering relations among questions of how signs can be meaningful and of what kinds of signs there are, how they combine, and how some embody or incorporate others. Within this broad area, Peirce developed three interlocked universal [[Trichotomy (philosophy)|trichotomies]] of signs, depending respectively on (1) the sign itself, (2) how the sign stands for its object, and (3) how the sign stands for its object to its interpretant. Each trichotomy is divided according to the phenomenological category involved: ''Firstness'' (quality of feeling, essentially monadic), ''secondness'' (reaction or resistance, essentially dyadic), or ''thirdness'' (representation or mediation, essentially triadic).&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/categories.html Categories, Cenopythagorean Categories]", ''Commens Dictionary of Peirce's Terms'', Mats Bergman and Sami Paavola, editors, University of Helsinki.&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Semiotic elements and classes of signs (Peirce)#I. Qualisign.2C sinsign.2C legisign|Qualisigns, sinsigns, and legisigns]]. Every sign is either (qualisign) a [[Quality (philosophy)|quality]] or possibility, or (sinsign) an actual individual thing, fact, event, state, etc., or (legisign) a norm, habit, rule, law.
# [[Semiotic elements and classes of signs (Peirce)#II. Icon.2C index.2C symbol|Icons, indices, and symbols]]. Every sign refers either (icon) through similarity to its object, or (index) through factual connection to its object, or (symbol) through interpretive habit or norm of reference to its object.
# [[Semiotic elements and classes of signs (Peirce)#III. Rheme.2C dicisign.2C argument|Rhemes, dicisigns, and arguments]]. Every sign is interpreted either as (rheme) term-like, standing for its object in respect of quality, or as (dicisign) proposition-like, standing for its object in respect of fact, or as (argument) argumentative, standing for its object in respect of habit or law. This is the trichotomy of all signs as building blocks of inference.
{{C. S. Peirce ninefold sign table}} 
Some (not all) sign classes from different trichotomies intersect each other. For example, a qualisign is always an icon, and is never an index or a symbol. He held that there were only ten classes of signs logically definable through those three universal trichotomies.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'', v. 2, paragraphs 254–263, reprinted in ''Philosophical Writings of Peirce'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=ClSjXRIbxAMC&amp;pg=PA115 pp. 115]–118, and in ''The Essential Peirce'' v. 2, pp. 294–296.&lt;/ref&gt; He thought that there were further such universal trichotomies as well. Also, some signs need other signs in order to be embodied. For example, a legisign (also called a type), such as the word "the," needs to be embodied in a sinsign (also called a token), for example an individual instance of the word "the", in order to be expressed. Another form of combination is attachment or incorporation: an index may be attached to, or incorporated by, an icon or a symbol.

Peirce called an icon apart from a label, legend, or other index attached to it, a "hypoicon", and divided the hypoicon into three classes: (a) the ''image'', which depends on a simple quality; (b) the ''diagram'', whose internal relations, mainly dyadic or so taken, represent by analogy the relations in something; and (c) the ''metaphor'', which represents the representative character of a sign by representing a parallelism in something else.&lt;ref&gt;On image, diagram, and metaphor, see "[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/hypoicon.html Hypoicon]" in the ''[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/dictionary.html Commens Dictionary of Peirce's Terms]''.&lt;/ref&gt; A diagram can be geometric, or can consist in an array of algebraic expressions, or even in the common form "All __ is ___" which is subjectable, like any diagram, to logical or mathematical transformations.

2. '''Logical critic''' or Logic Proper. That is how Peirce refers to logic in the everyday sense. Its main objective, for Peirce, is to classify arguments and determine the validity and force of each kind.&lt;ref name=critic/&gt; He sees [[Charles Sanders Peirce#Modes of inference|three main modes]]: [[Abductive reasoning|abductive inference]] (guessing, inference to a hypothetical explanation); [[Deductive reasoning|deduction]]; and [[Inductive reasoning|induction]]. A work of art may embody an inference process and be an argument without being an explicit argumentation. That is the difference, for example, between most of ''[[War and Peace]]'' and its final section.

3. '''Speculative rhetoric''' or methodeutic. For Peirce this is the theory of effective use of signs in investigations, expositions, and applications of truth. Here Peirce coincides with Morris’s notion of pragmatics, in his interpretation of this term. He also called it "methodeutic", in that it is the analysis of the methods used in inquiry.&lt;ref name=methodeutic/&gt;

===Using signs and objects===
Peirce concluded that there are three ways in which signs represent objects. They underlie his most widely known trichotomy of signs:
* Icon
* Index
* Symbol&lt;ref&gt;For Peirce's definitions of icon, index, symbol, and related terms, see the [http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/dictionary.html Commens Dictionary of Peirce's Terms]''&lt;/ref&gt;

;Icon
This term refers to signs that represent by resemblance, such as portraits and some paintings though they can also be natural or mathematical. Iconicity is independent of actual connection, even if it occurs because of actual connection. An icon is or embodies a possibility, insofar as its object need not actually exist. A photograph is regarded as an icon because of its resemblance to its object, but is regarded as an index (with icon attached) because of its actual connection to its object. Likewise, with a portrait painted from life. An icon's resemblance is objective and independent of interpretation, but is relative to some mode of apprehension such as sight. An icon need not be sensory; anything can serve as an icon, for example a streamlined argument (itself a complex symbol) is often used as an icon for an argument (another symbol) bristling with particulars.

;Index
Peirce explains that an index is a sign that compels attention through a connection of fact, often through cause and effect. For example, if we see smoke we conclude that it is the effect of a cause – fire. It is an index if the connection is factual regardless of resemblance or interpretation. Peirce usually considered personal names and demonstratives such as the word "this" to be indices, for although as words they depend on interpretation, they are indices in depending on the requisite factual relation to their individual objects. A personal name has an actual historical connection, often recorded on a birth certificate, to its named object; the word "this" is like the pointing of a finger.

;Symbol
Peirce treats symbols as habits or norms of reference and meaning. Symbols can be natural, cultural, or abstract and logical. They depend as signs on how they ''will'' be interpreted, and lack or have lost dependence on resemblance and actual, indexical connection to their represented objects, though the symbol's individual embodiment is an index to your experience of its represented object. Symbols are instantiated by specialized indexical sinsigns. A proposition, considered apart from its expression in a particular language, is already a symbol, but many symbols draw from what is socially accepted and culturally agreed upon. Conventional symbols such as "horse" and ''&lt;span lang=es&gt;caballo&lt;/span&gt;'', which prescribe qualities of sound or appearance for their instances (for example, individual instances of the word "horse" on the page) are based on what amounts to arbitrary stipulation.&lt;ref name=Mitchell1990/&gt; Such a symbol uses what is already known and accepted within our society to give meaning. This can be both in spoken and written language.

For example, we can call a large metal object with four wheels, four doors, an engine and seats a "car" because such a term is agreed upon within our culture and it allows us to communicate.  In much the same way, as a society with a common set of understandings regarding language and signs, we can also write the word "car" and in the context of Australia and other English speaking nations, know what it symbolises and is trying to represent.&lt;ref name=Dupriez1991&gt;Dupriez, B, ''A Dictionary of Literary Devices'', University of Toronto Press, Canada, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Saussure and representation==
[[Image:Ferdinand de Saussure by Jullien.png|thumb|right|[[Ferdinand de Saussure]]]]
Swiss linguist [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] (1857–1913) played a major role in the development of semiotics with his argument that language is a system of signs that needs to be understood in order to fully understand the process of [[linguistics]].&lt;ref name=Culler1976&gt;Culler, J 1976, ''Saussure'', Fontana Modern Masters, Britain, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; The study of semiotics examines the signs and types of representation that humans use to express feelings, ideas, thoughts and ideologies.&lt;ref name=Ryder2004&gt;Ryder, M, ''Semiotics: Language and Culture'', 2004 viewed 6 April 2006 see link below&lt;/ref&gt; Although semiotics is often used in the form of [[textual analysis]] it also involves the study of representation and the processes involved with representation.

The process of representation is characterised by using signs that we recall mentally or phonetically to comprehend the world.&lt;ref name=Klarer1998&gt;Klarer, M, ''An Introduction to Literary Studies'', Routledge, London, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Saussure says before a human can use the word "tree" she or he has to envision the mental concept of a tree.

Two things are fundamental to the study of signs:&lt;ref name=Barry2002&gt;Barry, P, ''Beginning Theory: an Introduction to Literary and Cultural Theory'', Manchester University Press, Great Britain, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;
#The '''signified:''' a mental concept, and
#The '''signifier:''' the verbal manifestation, the sequence of letters or sounds, the linguistic realisation.
The signifier is the word or sound; the signified is the representation.
 
Saussure points out that signs:
*Are '''arbitrary:''' There is no link between the signifier and the signified
*Are '''relational:''' We understand we take on meaning in relation to other words. Such as we understand "up" in relation to "down" or a dog in relation to other animals, such as a cat.
*'''constitute our world''' – "You cannot get outside of language. We exist inside a system of signs".&lt;ref name=Barry2002/&gt;

Saussure suggests that the meaning of a sign is arbitrary, in effect; there is no link between the signifier and the signified.&lt;ref name=Holdcroft1991&gt;Holdcroft 1991 no details&lt;/ref&gt; The signifier is the word or the sound of the word and the signified is the representation of the word or sound. For example, when referring to the term "sister" (signifier) a person from an English speaking country such as Australia, may associate that term as representing someone in their family who is female and born to the same parents (signified). An [[Australian Aborigines|Aboriginal Australian]] may associate the term "sister" to represent a close friend that they have a bond with. This means that the representation of a signifier depends completely upon a person’s cultural, linguistic and social background. Saussure argues that if words or sounds were simply labels for existing things in the world, translation from one language or culture to another would be easy, it is the fact that this can be extremely difficult that suggests that words trigger a representation of an object or thought depending on the person that is representing the signifier.&lt;ref name=Chandler2001&gt;Chandler, D, ''Semiotics for Beginners: Modality and representation'', viewed 8 April 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The signified triggered from the representation of a signifier in one particular language do not necessarily represent the same signified in another language. Even within one particular language many words refer to the same thing but represent different people's interpretations of it. A person may refer to a particular place as their "work" whereas someone else represents the same signifier as their "favorite restaurant".  This can also be subject to historical changes in both the signifier and the way objects are signified.

Saussure claims that an imperative function of all written languages and alphabetic systems is to "represent" spoken language.&lt;ref name=Arnason2006&gt;Arnason, D, Reference material, 2006, viewed 12 April 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Most languages do not have writing systems that represent the [[Phoneme|phonemic sounds]] they make. For example, in English the written letter "a" represents different phonetic sounds depending on which word it is written in. The letter "a" has a different sound in the word in each of the following words, "apple", "gate", "margarine" and "beat", therefore, how is a person unaware of the phonemic sounds, able to pronounce the word properly by simply looking at alphabetic spelling. The way the word is represented on paper is not always the way the word would be represented phonetically. This leads to common misrepresentations of the phonemic sounds of speech and suggests that the [[writing system]] does not properly represent the true nature of the pronunciation of words.

== Career ==
In 1968, Turner served briefly as a correspondent in Vietnam for the Indianapolis News. He then was commissioned as a Captain in the US Army through the [[Reserve Officers' Training Corps|ROTC]] program and assigned to the intelligence services. He served in Vietnam from 1968 through 1971, primarily assigned to [[Military Assistance Command, Vietnam|MACV]] on detail to the [[Embassy of the United States, Saigon|US Embassy]] as Assistant Special Projects Officer, North Vietnam/Viet Cong Affairs Division. One of his duties was interviewing senior communist defectors and POWs. In that position, he accumulated first-hand knowledge of Vietnamese communism from those he interviewed, an experience that led to his book, Vietnamese Communism: Its Origins and Development.&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=RclmAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Robert+F.+Turner%22&amp;dq=%22Robert+F.+Turner%22|accessdate=28 November 2017|last1=Turner|first1=Robert F.|title=Vietnamese Communism: Its Origins and Development|date=1975|publisher=Hoover Institution Press|location=Stanford, CA|isbn=9780817964313|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another of his duties was briefing US and foreign media. In his capacity as Special Projects Officer, he also authored a top secret monograph on Viet Cong assassination policy.&lt;ref name=bio /&gt;

In 1971 he became a Research Assistant/Associate at the Hoover Institution on War, Revolution and Peace,&lt;ref name=fed /&gt; where "he contributed ten chapters on communist movements in Southeast Asia to the ''Yearbook on International Communist Affairs'' (1972)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Staar|first1=Richard Felix|last2=Drachkovitch|first2=Milorad M.|last3=Gann|first3=Lewis H.|title=Yearbook on International Communist Affairs|date=1972|publisher=Hoover Institution on War, Revolution and Peace, Stanford University.|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Yearbook_on_International_Communist_Affa.html?id=tfADAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=30 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; While at Stanford, he attended graduate courses in History and Political Science. In 1972 he became a Public Affairs Fellow. He spent his first year researching at Stanford and completing his book on Vietnamese Communism and his second year on Capitol Hill. During that period, he also served as Associate Editor (Asia and Pacific) for the ''Yearbook on International Communist Affairs'' (1973-1974).&lt;ref name=bio /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Staar|first1=F.

When his fellowship was complete, Turner became Special Assistant and Legislative Assistant to U.S. Senator [[Robert P. Griffin]] of Michigan for five years.&lt;ref name=fed /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Robert F. Turner|url=https://content.law.virginia.edu/faculty/adjunct-profile/rft3m/1216438|website=University of Virginia School of Law|publisher=University of Virginia|accessdate=29 November 2017|language=en|date=22 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served as Senator Griffin's national security advisor and was responsible for [[Foreign policy|Foreign Affairs]], [[Military|Armed Services]] and [[Intelligence]] issues.&lt;ref name=bio /&gt; While there, he helpded draft the language that created the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.

In April 1981, Turner co-founded the Center for National Security Law with John Norton Moore.&lt;ref name="fed"&gt;{{cite web|title=Prof. Robert F. Turner|url=https://fedsoc.org/contributors/robert-turner-1|website=The Federalist Society|accessdate=30 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was "the first organization focused expressly on national security law in the nation, and probably in the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=7HhLrgEACAAJ&amp;dq=National+Security+Law+%26+Policy|accessdate=28 November 2017|last1=Moore|first1=John Norton|last2=Roberts|first2=Guy B.|last3=Turner|first3=Robert F.|title=National Security Law &amp; Policy|date=2015|publisher=Carolina Academic Press|location=Durham, NC|isbn=978-1611637045|edition=3rd|page=xiii}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year he took a leave of absence to become the Special Assistant to the UnderSecretary of Defense for Policy as well as Counsel to the President's Intelligence Oversight Board,&lt;ref name=fed /&gt; where he served for two years. Then he served as Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Legislative and Governmental Affairs for the [[United States Department of State]] until 1985.&lt;ref name=bio /&gt;

The following year, Turner became the first President and CEO&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Current and Past Leadership|url=https://www.usip.org/about-us/executive-office/current-and-past-leadership|website=United States Institute of Peace|accessdate=29 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[United States Institute of Peace]] which was established by Congress in 1984, holding the position from 1986 to 1987.

Two years later, he became the Chair of the ABA Standing Committee on Law and National Security. He held the post until 1992. He also served as editor of the ABA National Security Law Report.&lt;ref name=fed /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Turner|first1=Robert F.|title=Ten Questions: Responses of Robert F.

in 1991, Turner co-edited and published National Security Law and Policy, now in its third edition. At the time of its creation, the field of national security law did not exist as a separate discipline in the legal profession. Turner went on to become a three-term chairman of the ABA Standing Committee on Law and National Security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Links of Interest {{!}} Standing Committee|url=https://www.americanbar.org/groups/public_services/law_national_security/resources/links_of_interest.html|website=www.americanbar.org|accessdate=29 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gellman|first1=Barton|title=Washingtonpost.com: Fog of War - Post Archive|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/inatl/longterm/fogofwar/archive/post012491_2.htm|accessdate=29 November 2017|publisher=The Washington Post|date=25 January 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''SABIO-RK''' ('''S'''ystem for the '''A'''nalysis of '''Bio'''chemical Pathways - '''R'''eaction '''K'''inetics) is a web-accessible [[database]] storing information about biochemical [[Chemical reaction|reactions]] and their [[Enzyme kinetics|kinetic]] properties.

SABIO-RK comprises a reaction-oriented representation of quantitative information on reaction dynamics based on a given selected publication.
This comprises all available kinetic parameters together with their corresponding [[rate equation]]s,
as well as kinetic law and parameter types and experimental and environmental conditions under which the kinetic data were determined.
Additionally, SABIO-RK contains information about the underlying biochemical reactions and [[Metabolic pathway|pathways]] including their [[Reagent|reaction participants]],
[[Cell (biology)|cellular]] location and detailed information about the [[enzymes]] catalysing the reactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi = 10.1007/11799511_9|chapter = SABIO-RK: Integration and Curation of Reaction Kinetics Data|title = Data Integration in the Life Sciences|series = Lecture Notes in Computer Science|year = 2006|last1 = Wittig|first1 = Ulrike|last2 = Golebiewski|first2 = Martin|last3 = Kania|first3 = Renate|last4 = Krebs|first4 = Olga|last5 = Mir|first5 = Saqib|last6 = Weidemann|first6 = Andreas|last7 = Anstein|first7 = Stefanie|last8 = Saric|first8 = Jasmin|last9 = Rojas|first9 = Isabel|volume = 4075|pages = 94–103}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=17822389 |year=2007 |last1=Rojas |first1=I |last2=Golebiewski |first2=M |last3=Kania |first3=R |last4=Krebs |first4=O |last5=Mir |first5=S |last6=Weidemann |first6=A |last7=Wittig |first7=U |title=Storing and annotating of kinetic data |volume=7 |issue=2 Suppl |pages=S37–44 |journal=In silico biology}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/nar/gkr1046 |title=SABIO-RK--database for biochemical reaction kinetics |year=2011 |last1=Wittig |first1=U. |last2=Kania |first2=R. |last3=Golebiewski |first3=M. |last4=Rey |first4=M. |last5=Shi |first5=L. |last6=Jong |first6=L. |last7=Algaa |first7=E. |last8=Weidemann |first8=A. |last9=Sauer-Danzwith |first9=H. |last10=Mir |first10=S. |last11=Krebs |first11=O. |last12=Bittkowski |first12=M. |last13=Wetsch |first13=E. |last14=Rojas |first14=I. |last15=Muller |first15=W. |journal=Nucleic Acids Research |volume=40 |pages=D790–6 |pmid=22102587 |issue=Database issue |pmc=3245076|display-authors=8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Müller W.

== Content of SABIO-RK Database ==
The data stored in SABIO-RK in a comprehensive manner is extracted manually from literature. This includes reactions, their participants (substrates, products), modifiers ([[Enzyme inhibitor|inhibitors]], activators, [[Cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactors]]), [[Catalysis|catalyst]] details (e.g. [[Enzyme Commission number|EC enzyme classification]], [[Protein quaternary structure|protein complex composition]], [[wild type]] / [[Mutations|mutant]] information), kinetic parameters together with corresponding rate equation, biological sources ([[organism]], [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]], cellular location), environmental conditions ([[pH]], temperature, buffer) and reference details. Data are adapted, normalized and annotated to controlled vocabularies, [[Ontology (information science)|ontologies]] and external data sources including [[KEGG]], [[Uniprot|UniProt]], [[ChEBI]], [[Pubchem|PubChem]], [[National Center for Biotechnology Information|NCBI]], and [[Pubmed|PubMed]].&lt;br/&gt;
Currently SABIO-RK contains more than 52.000 curated single entries, for example 42% of them are related to the kinetic law type [[Michaelis–Menten kinetics|Michaelis-Menten kinetics]], more than 14% of the entries contain diverse types of inhibitions. Kinetic parameters in SABIO-RK include more than 41.700  velocity constants (V&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;, [[Turnover number|k&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Reaction rate constant|rate constants]]), more than 42.500 K&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; values (including S_half for [[Hill equation (biochemistry)|Hill equations]]) and about 11.800 [[Enzyme inhibitor|inhibition constants]] (Ki, IC50). Kinetic data are available for about 850 organisms, 6.700  different reactions and about 1.480 enzymes catalysing these reactions (as of December 2015).&lt;br/&gt;
Several tools, databases and workflows in [[Systems biology|Systems Biology]] make use of SABIO-RK biochemical reaction data by integration into their framework including

Worms, bacteria and fish are shown [[bioturbation|disturbing the sediment]] as they burrow and move through it.]]
A '''sediment-dwelling organism''' is a creature or micro-organism which lives mainly inside [[sediment]] – the layer of small particles at the bottom of a body of water.  These are collectively known as '''infauna''', as opposed to [[epifauna]] – the [[benthic]] organisms which live on the surface of the sediment.

Such creatures are found in the fossil record and include [[lingulata]], [[trilobites]] and [[worm]]s.  They made burrows in the sediment as protection and may also have fed upon detritus or the mat of microbes which tended to grow on the surface of the sediment.{{sfn|Vermeij|2009|p=266}}  Today, a variety of organisms live in and [[bioturbation|disturb the sediment]].  The deepest burrowers are the ghost shrimps – ''[[Thalassinidea]]'' – which go as deep as 3 metres into the sediment at the bottom of the ocean.{{sfn|Vermeij|2009|p=267}}

A '''sex toy''' is an object or device that is primarily used to facilitate [[Human sexual activity|human sexual pleasure]], such as a [[dildo]] or [[Vibrator (sex toy)|vibrator]].  Many popular sex toys are designed to resemble human genitals and may be vibrating or non-vibrating.  The term ''sex toy'' can also include [[BDSM]] apparatus and [[sex furniture]] such as [[fisting sling|slings]]; however, it is not applied to items such as [[birth control]], [[pornography]], or [[condom]]s. Alternative expressions include '''adult toy''' and the dated euphemism '''marital aid''', although "marital aid" has a broader sense and is applied to drugs and herbs marketed to supposedly enhance or prolong sex. Sex toys are most commonly sold at a [[sex shop]], but they may also be sold in a pharmacy/chemist store, a pornographic DVD store, or [[head shop]]. Today's sex toys are available in almost all countries for male and females.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}

==Types==

=== Erotic electrostimulation ===
{{expand section|date=March 2013}}
Another form of sex toy for both men and women are those for [[erotic electrostimulation]].

Erotic electrostimulation refers to the act of using electricity for sexual stimulation. Electrostimulation dates back as early as the mid 1700s. By the mid 1970s, medical transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) machines were widely available. The machines work by stimulating nerve endings with electricity, sending signals of stimulation to the brain. Electrostimulation works off this same principle, when the brain received a signal of stimulation from the genitals, pleasure hormones are released.

===Erotic furniture===
{{expand section|date=March 2013}}
[[Erotic furniture]] is furniture specially shaped for comfort, penetration levels, and stimulation.

===General penetrative toys===
[[Image:Ben Wa balls.jpg|thumb|upright|A type of Ben Wa balls]]

}}
* [[Ben Wa balls]] are hollow metal balls inserted vaginally which can be worn inside the vagina for extended periods of time. The internal rolling is claimed to enhance orgasms.
* Love Balls are solid metal balls inserted vaginally prior to sex. The weight and agitation by penis or dildo enhance sensation. They were popularised by the novel ''[[Fifty Shades of Grey]]'' and its film adaptation.
* A [[dildo]] is a non-vibrating device which is used for sexual stimulation of the vagina or anus. Dildos are generally made of silicone rubber, but can be made of other materials such as body safe metals such as titanium, stainless steel, aluminium, or glass. They are often made to resemble a penis, although some are C-shaped or S-shaped for G-spot or P-spot stimulation.
** A [[double penetration dildo]] is a long, usually flexible dildo with both ends designed for penetration. It allows for mutual penetration between two persons (or for double penetration of  a single female, both anally and vaginally).
** A [[strap-on dildo]] is a dildo worn in a harness, used to penetrate another person.
* A horseshoe is a non-vibrating sex toy which is shaped similar to a [[horseshoe]], which is put into the vagina and anus at the same time. It is made with softer plastics.
* [[Kegel exercise]]r, also known as vaginal barbells, eggs, or jugglers, are designed to improve muscle tone in the [[pelvic floor]], and can be used for sexual pleasure as well as enhancing vaginal response.
* A [[sex-machine]] is a motor-driven device that combines penetration with rotational or reciprocal movement, or both.&lt;ref name="leung"&gt;Leung, Isaac (2009). "The Cultural Production of Sex Machines and the Contemporary Technosexual Practices". In Grenzfurthner, J. et al., eds. ''Do androids sleep with electric sheep? Critical perspectives on sexuality and pornography in science and social fiction.''  [[RE/SEARCH]], {{ISBN|978-1-889307-23-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Anal toys====
[[Image:Zwei unterschiedliche Butt-Plugs.jpg|upright|thumb|Two butt plugs]]
* [[Anal beads]]
* [[Butt plug]]s are often shorter dildos intended for anal insertion.  They tend to have a flared base to prevent the device from becoming sucked into the rectum.
* [[Prostate massage]]rs are devices designed to stimulate a man's [[prostate]] for health and pleasure.

====Glass sex toys====
[[File:Glass Dildo.JPG|thumb|upright=0.5|left|Glass [[Dildo]]]]
Glass sex toys are commonly made from clear medical grade [[borosilicate glass]] ("hard glass"). This particular type of safety toughened glass is non-toxic and will withstand extreme temperatures, as well as physical shock without compromising its structural integrity.

The choice of this high-grade material provides safety in use and the option to heat or chill the toys. Borosilicate glass is also non-porous and can be sterilized to help prevent infection with reuse. The highest quality glass toys can even be put in the dishwasher making them easier to keep clean. As well as their practical qualities, a main selling point of glass sex toys is their visual appeal.

Some glass sex toys vibrate.  There are two main ways this can be achieved. Either the toy may have a hole into which a small bullet vibrator can be inserted, or the core of the glass design can be modified to form a standard vibrator. The latter option usually has a plastic cap covering the battery compartment, which will also house any control buttons or switches.

====Vibrators====
{{main|Vibrator (sex toy)}}
Vibrators are vibrating devices intended to stimulate the body. Vibrators come in a range of shapes and sizes, for internal or external use.  Some vibrators intended for internal use are [[Phallus|phallic]] in shape.  Small vibrators may have a stretchy loop attachment for use as a finger toy or [[cock ring]]. Penetrative vibrators usually measure twelve to eighteen cm (five to seven inches) in length and two to five cm (one to two inches) wide often to mimic the size of the average [[human penis]].{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

* [[Anal vibrator]]s are designed to be inserted into the rectum, which may stimulate the [[prostate]] in men.  The safest ones have a flared base which remains outside the body, that prevents the toy from becoming irretrievable.
*  Bullet vibrators are small, bullet-shaped vibrators that can be used for direct stimulation or inserted into other sex toys to increase stimulation.  Some are sold with stretchy loops for attachment as a finger toy or [[cock ring]].
* Luxury vibrators have an increased focus on design and the use of expensive materials that appeal to a more upscale fashion market.
* [[G-spot vibrator]]s are curved at one end to facilitate stimulation of the female [[G-spot]].
* The [[rabbit vibrator]], of which there are several variations, is a popular female sex toy popularized by the television series ''[[Sex and the City]]''.&lt;ref name="Sex and The City Episode Guide"&gt;{{cite web| title =  Sex and The City Episode Guide| publisher = HBO.com| url = http://www.hbo.com/city/episode/season1/episode09.shtml| accessdate =2007-07-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It comprises an insertable shaft which often has additional functionality, such as rotation and internal beads or a thrusting action. Attached to the shaft is a vibrating clitoral stimulator. For most rabbit vibrators this comes in the form of "bunny ears" which sit each side of the [[clitoris]].
* Vibrator wands, such as the [[Hitachi Magic Wand]], are large vibrators that generally plug into an electrical outlet (versus operating on battery power) and are often marketed as back massagers.&lt;ref name="christophertrout"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Trout |first1=Christopher |title=The 46-year-old sex toy Hitachi won't talk about |url=https://www.engadget.com/2014/08/27/history-of-the-hitachi-magic-wand/ |accessdate=30 August 2014 |work=[[Engadget]] |date=28 August 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140827183517/http://www.engadget.com/2014/08/27/history-of-the-hitachi-magic-wand/ |archivedate=27 August 2014 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  They are able to produce far more powerful vibration than most battery-powered vibrators.&lt;ref name="christophertrout" /&gt;  Various attachments made of silicone or a rubber material allow the toy to be used penetratively, or give the toy more interesting texture.&lt;ref name="christophertrout" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=News &amp; Commentary|work=Valley Advocate|location=Easthampton, Massachusetts|publisher=Accessed via [[NewsBank]]|date=4 November 2010|quote=The Hitachi Magic Wand, with a reputation for releasing even the most stubborn orgasm, brings a powerful buzz to all the right places (instead of uncomfortably rattling the handle). Separately sold removable silicone tops add extra texture or penetration options}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Sybian]]s are dual-area vibrators in the form of a clitoral stimulator and vaginal stimulator, designed to stimulate the two erogenous zones simultaneously and independently.

===Nipple toys===
* A [[nipple clamp]] is a clamp used to stimulate the nipples by applying varying degrees of pressure.
* Suction devices are generally either rubber or glass.

===Penile toys===
[[Image:Sex Toy.png|thumb|100px|A penis sleeve]]
* [[Artificial vagina]]s, also known as "pocket pussies" or "male masturbators", are tubes made of soft material to simulate [[sexual intercourse]]. The material and often textured inner canal are designed to stimulate the [[Human penis|penis]] and induce [[orgasm]]. The male masturbators come in many shapes and styles; they can be shaped like [[vulva]]s, anuses, mouths, or as non-descriptive holes. Some male masturbators are [[disposable]] and some can be washed and used repeatedly. Some are equipped with [[sex-machine]] options that work similar to [[milking machines]].&lt;ref name="browne"&gt;{{cite book|last=Browne|first=Ray Broadus|year=1982|title=Objects of special devotion: fetishism in popular culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NO5DkzptBeoC|page=49|publisher=Popular Press|isbn=978-0-87972-191-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A cock harness is a more elaborate harness designed to be worn around the penis and scrotum. Its function is similar to that of a cock ring. These devices are often associated with [[BDSM]] activities such as [[cock and ball torture (sexual practice)|cock and ball torture]]. An [[Arab strap (sexual device)|Arab strap]] is one such form of harness, purported to be a device used for maintaining an erection.
* [[Cock ring]]s prolong male erection by holding blood inside the penis. A man may wear a cock-ring to combat erectile difficulties, or for the sensation of tightness and engorgement that wearing one provides. Some models include a protruding [[Clitoris|clitoral]] stimulator, designed to stimulate the clitoris during sex. Others vibrate, either vibrating the ring itself, or in a popular 'Dolphin' variant by using two removable bullet vibrators to provide stimulation to both the testicles and clitoris. Some cock rings also have [[Vibrator (sensual)|vibrators]] attached which can be worn to stimulate a partner during [[sexual intercourse]], especially in the [[scrotum]] or [[perineum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.extremerestraints.com/nova-silicone-cock-ring-and-prostate-vibe.html|title="Nova Silicone Cock Ring and Prostate Vibe"}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet other cock rings have arms that rub and apply pressure to the [[perineum]] of the wearer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fischer|first=Albert G|year=1994|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US5439007|title=United States Patent 5,439,007 "Suspensory"|access-date=15 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** A triple crown is a special cock ring that has additional rings for restraining the testicles. In orgasm, the testicles usually retract toward the body before [[ejaculation]]. A triple crown changes and intensifies the sensation of orgasm by forcing the testicles to stay away from the body.
* A docking sleeve is a cylindrical device similar to a penis sleeve, but is open at both ends, so that two men can [[List of sex positions#Genital-genital sex|dock]], a form of [[Mutual masturbation#Mutual masturbation as a form of non-penetrative sex|mutual masturbation]].
* A penis extension is a partially hollow device like a very short dildo, with the hollow end placed on the end of the penis, intended to increase the effective length of the penis, again for the benefit of the person being penetrated. These are generally worn with condoms to prevent them from falling off during use.
* A penis sleeve is a cylindrical device that is placed on the shaft of the penis, with the aim of increasing stimulation for the person being penetrated. They often have soft bumps intended to provide further stimulation.

==Health, safety, and privacy concerns==

No safety regulations exist in the sex toy industry. The sex toys are sold as novelty items so they do not need to adhere to certain regulations such as reporting the chemicals and materials used in a product. Due to this status, manufacturers are not responsible if their toys are used for any other purpose than being a novelty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Safety Dance: Sex Toy Safety for a New Generation|url=http://kinseyconfidential.org/safety-dance-sex-toy-safety-generation/|publisher=www.kinseyconfidential.org|accessdate=25 June 2015|date=12 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regulations such as [[Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals|REACH]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://echa.europa.eu/regulations/reach|title=REACH - ECHA|publisher=|accessdate=18 August 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160724051550/http://echa.europa.eu/regulations/reach|archivedate=24 July 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; do exist, and some sex toys may be compliant to this though, despite that there is no obligation for manufacturers on attaining compliance.  A 2006 study conducted by the [[Greenpeace]] Netherlands office found high level of [[phthalate]]s in seven out of eight plastic sex toys tested.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/blog/toxics/bad-vibrations-we-expose-an-eu-sex-scandal Bad vibrations? We expose an EU sex scandal] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514001824/http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/blog/toxics/bad-vibrations-we-expose-an-eu-sex-scandal |date=2008-05-14 }} Posted by bex (8 September 2006)Greenpeace UK&lt;/ref&gt;

Sex toys are classified as novelties in the United States because the [[Food and Drug Administration]] has extensive testing and financial requirements in order for sex toys to be classified as medical devices. Therefore, sex toy manufacturers more often choose less complex production by labelling them a novelty, where their listed ingredients do not have to be accurate in chemical composition or percentage of ingredients.  Due to the novelty classification, sex toys may contain toxins such as phthalates, which have been banned in children's toys by the [[U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission|CPSC]].&lt;ref name="kinseyconfidential.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kinseyconfidential.org/safety-dance-sex-toy-safety-generation/|title=The Safety Dance: Sex Toy Safety for a New Generation - Kinsey Confidential|publisher=|accessdate=18 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Phthalates|url=http://www.cpsc.gov/en/Business--Manufacturing/Business-Education/Business-Guidance/Phthalates-Information/|publisher=www.cpsc.gov|accessdate=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phthalates are chemical plasticizers that are added as softeners, to create the malleable and soft effect that many look for in sex toys.&lt;ref name="kinseyconfidential.org"/&gt;

Studies on rodents have revealed that when exposed to very large doses, phthalates can cause damage to the liver, lungs, kidneys, testes and can cause hormonal disruption. The latest research indicates that exposure to these substances can upset the body's ability to regulate hormone production, damage reproduction, can cause liver and kidney defects, and can cause cancer. The most common and external side-effects are rashes, itchiness and irritation to the locations of use.

Before using a sex toy, owners should take precautions.  One should check for tears, rough seams or cracks  that could harm the inside of the vagina or anus.  Condoms should also be used on porous sex toys and sex toys that are being shared between two or more partners. They should also use appropriate lubricants; silicone lube will break down silicone toys, and oil-based lubes will break down latex condoms.&lt;ref name=brownedu&gt;{{cite web|title=Sex Toys|url=http://www.brown.edu/Student_Services/Health_Services/Health_Education/sexual_health/sexuality/sex_toys.php/|publisher=[[Brown University]]|accessdate=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cleaning sex toys is also very important for sexual health and sex toy safety.  Cleaning them will avoid the potential of bacterial infection, transmission of STIs (if shared), or pregnancy (if sperm is present on the toy).  Porous sex toys (ridged, flexible, soft and squishy) are difficult to clean and can hide bacteria that multiply and harm the human body. Non-porous toys are easier to clean, being less harmful.&lt;ref name="kinseyconfidential.org"/&gt;  When cleaning sex toys, always use warm water and unscented anti-bacterial soap.&lt;ref name=brownedu /&gt;

Non-porous toys&lt;ref name=brownedu /&gt;
* Glass toys: some can be put in the dishwasher, but it is recommended not to expose them to extreme temperatures and to wash them with soap and water.
* Stainless Steel toys: boil or soak stainless steel toys in 1-10 bleach-water solution for ten minutes, put it on the top shelf of the dishwasher, or use soap and water (if there are electrical components to the toy).
* Hard plastic toys: do not boil the toy, and wash with soap and water.
* Silicone toys: put it on the top shelf of the dishwasher, boil for 5–10 minutes, or wash with water and soap.

Porous toys&lt;ref name=brownedu /&gt;
* Rubber toys: they cannot be properly cleaned because bacteria is absorbed into the material, so it is recommended to always use a condom.
* Cyberskin and Vinyl toys: clean with warm water, air dry, and sprinkle it with a small amount of cornstarch (to keep them dry and not sticky).
* Nylon toys: put it in the top rack of the dish-washer or wash with soap and water.

Anal toys ([[butt plug]]s, small dildos, etc.)
*When using sex toys in the anus, sex toys can easily get lost as rectal muscles contract and can suck an object up and up, potentially obstructing the colon; to prevent this serious problem, it is recommended that individuals use sex toys with a flared base or a string.&lt;ref name=scientificamerican&gt;{{cite web|title=Good Vibrations: U.S. Consumer Web Site Aims to Enhance Sex Toy Safety|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/good-vibrations-us-consumer-web-site-aims-to-enhance-sex-toy-safety/|publisher=www.scientificamerican.com|accessdate=25 June 2015|date=24 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 the security software company [[Trend Micro]] demonstrated that some sex toys are vulnerable to [[cyberattack]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Your Sex Toys Could Be Vulnerable To Cyberattack|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sex-toy-cyberattack_us_56e82b02e4b065e2e3d74bb5|work=Huffington Post|date=15 March 2016|author=Caroline Copley|agency=Reuters|location=Hanover, Germany}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus creating the field of [[Tor hidden services|onion dildonics]].&lt;ref name="Onion Dildonics"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/sex-toy-bluetooth-hacks-security-fix |title=Smart dildos and vibrators keep getting hacked – but Tor could be the answer to safer connected sex|quote=Connected sex toys are gathering huge amounts of data about our most intimate moments.

==Legal issues==

===India===
Sex toys are illegal in India.&lt;ref name ="singh2007"&gt;Singh, Jyotsna (20 June 2007). [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/6221540.stm India rattled by vibrating condom.] [[BBC News]]&lt;/ref&gt; Selling sex toys is a punishable offense under section 292 of Indian penal code, as sex toys are considered an "obscene" product. Besides sex toys, any book, pamphlet, paper, writing, drawing, painting, representation, figure or any other object, is by the way also considered obscene by section 292 if it is lascivious or appeals to the prurient interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Big-market-for-sex-toys-despite-ban/articleshow/2164155.cms|title=Big market for sex toys despite ban|author=Rati Chaudhary|date=1 July 2007|work=Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; The punishment for the offense is up to two years in prison.&lt;ref name ="timesindia"&gt;Staff report (February 2, 2011).

===Japan===
In [[Japan]], many [[dildo]]s are created to resemble animals or cartoon characters, such as [[Hello Kitty]], rabbits or dolphins, so that they may be sold as toys, thus avoiding [[obscenity|obscenity laws]].{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

===Malaysia===
In [[Malaysia]], the sale and importation of sex toys is illegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chin|first1=Christina|title=Shop online but don't break the law|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/News/Nation/2013/07/28/Shop-online-but-dont-break-the-law/|accessdate=17 October 2014|work=The Star (Malaysia)|date=28 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Africa===
Section 18A of the [[Sexual Offences Act, 1957]], inserted by the [[Immorality Amendment Act, 1969]], prohibited the manufacture or sale of any item "intended to be used to perform an unnatural sexual act". The term "unnatural sexual act" referred to any sex other than vaginal heterosexual sex, and this prohibition was ostensibly aimed at preventing the use of [[dildo]]s by [[lesbian]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Kevan |last1=Botha |first2=Edwin |last2=Cameron |authorlink2=Edwin Cameron |editor1-first=Donald J. |editor1-last=West |editor2-first=Richard |editor2-last=Green |title=Sociolegal Control of Homosexuality: A Multi-Nation Comparison |chapter=South Africa |year=1997 |publisher=Plenum Press |location=New York |isbn=0-306-45532-3 |pages=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; No longer enforced, the section was repealed by the [[Criminal Law (Sexual Offences and Related Matters) Amendment Act, 2007]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

===United States===
{{see also|Anti-Obscenity Enforcement Act|Texas obscenity statute}}
Sex toys and lubricants have become increasingly available in major commercial outlets in the United States. On-shelf displays tend to be more discreet than the offerings on web sites. These items tend to be displayed in the "sexual health" sections of stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/110965|title=Sex Aids on Retail Shelves|date=13 February 2008|publisher=|accessdate=18 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until recently, many [[U.S. Southern states|Southern]] and some [[Great Plains|Great Plains states]] banned the sale of sex toys completely, either directly or through laws regulating "obscene devices".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Lingere Store Accused of Violating State Obscenity Laws | publisher = KBCD.com | url = http://www.kcbd.com/Global/story.asp?S=6554592&amp;pass=1&amp;nav=3w6y | accessdate = 2007-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, [[William H. Pryor, Jr.]], an assistant attorney general in [[Alabama]] commenting on a case involving sex toys and discussing to what end the devices are used, was quoted as saying there is no "fundamental right for a person to buy a device to produce [[orgasm]]". A federal appeals court upheld Alabama's law prohibiting the sale of sex toys on Valentine's Day, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Rawls, Phillip. [https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2007-10-01-2390404063_x.htm Court leaves Ala. sex toy ban intact], USA Today, Oct 1, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2008, a federal appeals court overturned a [[Texas]] statute banning the sales of sex toys, deeming such a statute as violating the Constitution's 14th Amendment on the right to privacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Appeals court overturns Texas ban on sex toys | publisher = msnbc.msn.com | url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/23155562 | accessdate = 2008-02-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The appeals court cited ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'', where the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] in 2003 struck down bans on consensual sex between gay couples, as unconstitutionally aiming at "enforcing a public moral code by restricting private intimate conduct".  Similar statutes have been struck down in [[Kansas]] and [[Colorado]].

[[Marty Klein]], author of ''America's War on Sex'' and an advocate for the moral value of sex toys, has described the sex toy bans as a form of [[erotophobia]] and [[genophobia]] claiming the "extraordinary erosion of personal liberty, coupled with the massive disrespect of and fear of sexuality is no joke" and that the "Supreme Court [of the United States] has declared our orgasms a battlefield, and sex toys another casualty."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Holthouse|first=David|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091005085548/http://www.damemagazine.com/features/f261/AlabamavsDildos.php?Page=2|url=http://www.damemagazine.com/features/f261/AlabamavsDildos.php?Page=2|archive-date=5 October 2009|title=Alabama vs. Dildos: Attorney General Troy King stands hard against stimulators|magazine=Dame Magazine|accessdate=7 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Semiotics}}
In [[semiotics]], a '''sign relational complex''' is a generalization of a [[sign relation]] that allows for empty components in the ''elementary sign relations'', or sign relational triples of the form (object, sign, interpretant).

Generally speaking, when it comes to things that are being contemplated as ostensible or potential signs of other things, neither the existence nor the uniqueness of the elements appearing in the sign relation is guaranteed.  For example, the reference of a putative sign to its putative objects may achieve reference to zero, to one, or to many objects.  A proper treatment of this complication calls for the conception of something slightly more general than a sign relation proper, namely, a sign relational complex.  In effect, expressed in the roughest practical terms, this allows for ''missing data'' in the columns of the relational database table for the sign relation in question.  Typically one operates on the default assumption that all of the roles of elementary sign relations are filled, but remains wary enough of the possible exceptions to deal with them on an ''[[ad hoc]]'' basis.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19065">'''Spatial citizenship''' describes the ability of individuals and groups to interact and participate in societal [[space|spatial]] decision making through the [[Reflexivity (social theory)|reflexive]] production and use of geo-media (geographic media such as [[map]]s, [[virtual globe]]s, [[GIS]], and the [[Geoweb]]). Spatial citizens are lay users who are able to use geo-media to question existing perspectives on action in space (e.g. [[Convention (norm)|social rule]]s, [[spatial planning]]) and to produce, communicate, and negotiate alternative spatial visions.

Spatial citizenship is an educational approach at the intersection of [[Citizenship education (subject)|citizenship education]] and geography education. Its main theoretical reference points are [[Emancipation|emancipatory]] forms of [[citizenship]] and the "reflexive appropriation of space".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Boscaljon |first=Daniel |date=Spring 2014 |title=The reflexive appropriation of space |journal=Iowa Journal of Cultural Studies |volume=15 |pages=3–11 |url=http://ir.uiowa.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1438&amp;context=ijcs |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reference points in citizenship education ==
Spatial citizenship can be distinguished from traditional citizenship education approaches in many respects: 
* Spatial citizenship respects multiple institutional and locational setups. It is de-linked from traditional national "citizenship" as it is not tied to the nation or local state as predefined spatial entities. Spatial citizenship is based upon the principles of [[human rights]] and [[democracy|democratic negotiation]] to ensure a basis for conciliation and compromise.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} It is based on the concept of activist citizenship (in contrast to [[active citizenship]]) formulated by Katharyne Mitchell and Sarah Elwood, who challenge unquestioned social rules that limit participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Elwood |first1=Sarah |last2=Mitchell |first2=Katharyne |date=Winter 2013 |title=Another politics is possible: neogeographies, visual spatial tactics, and political formation |journal=Cartographica |volume=48 |issue=4 |pages=275–292 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Katharyne_Mitchell/publication/265895477_Another_Politics_Is_Possible_Neogeographies_Visual_Spatial_Tactics_and_Political_Formation/links/54c07e490cf28eae4a696b59.pdf |quote=Recognizing neogeography as a site of political formation paves the way toward realizing its broader potential in the development and practice of a critical spatial citizenship. We develop these arguments from a three-year neogeography project conducted with young teens. [...] As an example of neogeography politics conceived as strategy, Gryl and Jekel (2012) argue that collaborative online "geo-media" (which has been termed neogeography in this article) can be sites for the development and practice of critical spatial citizenship. They argue that this critical spatial citizenship depends upon citizens' abilities to engage in "strategic practices" (de Certeau 1984), such as having the cartographic and spatial thinking skills necessary to use geo-media in ways that will be recognized by policymakers or other citizens and to use these platforms to disseminate their own spatial narratives or challenge those put forth by others. |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Spatial citizenship refers to an open and flexible conception of social institutions. It supplants the notion of belonging to one specific place with the notion of belonging to multiple and fluid [[community|communities]] that may or may not be linked with a particular location on the Earth's surface. Angharad Stephens and Vicki Squire have argued that societal negotiation processes have shifted away from fixed communities due to new information technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stephens |first1=Angharad Closs |last2=Squire |first2=Vicki |date=June 2012 |title=Politics through a web: citizenship and community unbound |journal=Environment and Planning D: Society and Space |volume=30 |issue=3 |pages=551–567 |doi=10.1068/d8511 |url=http://dro.dur.ac.uk/13714/1/13714.pdf |quote=What happens to citizenship when the nation and the state are no longer assumed to be the inevitable starting points from which politics is defined?

* Spatial citizenship draws special attention to [[web community|web communities]] and geo-social networks. A spatial citizen is a 'self-actualizing citizen' who, in contrast to the 'dutiful citizen' concept of the past, is able to use [[Web 2.0]] and [[cloud computing|cloud]]-based applications to compare different and potentially contradicting information sources and communicate his/her own alternative ideas via [[collaboration|collaborative]] web tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bennett |first1=W.

== Reference points in social geography: appropriation of space ==
Spatial citizenship has become a conceptual reference point in theories of action-oriented [[social geography]] and new [[cultural geography]].&lt;ref name="Jekel2015"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jekel |first1=Thomas |last2=Gryl |first2=Inga |last3=Schulze |first3=Uwe |date=2015 |chapter=Education for spatial citizenship |editor1-last=Solari |editor1-first=Osvaldo Muñiz |editor2-last=Demirci |editor2-first=Ali |editor3-last=Schee |editor3-first=Joop |title=Geospatial technologies and geography education in a changing world: geospatial practices and lessons learned |location=Tōkyō; New York |publisher=[[Springer Verlag]] |pages=35–49 |isbn=9784431555186 |oclc=900306594 |doi=10.1007/978-4-431-55519-3_4 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; These approaches contend that human beings constantly appropriate spaces, as they attach meanings to geographically located physical matter in order to prepare it for their own actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Werlen |first=Benno |date=1993 |title=Society action and space: an alternative human geography |location=London; New York |publisher=[[Routledge]] |isbn=0415069653 |oclc=25372963 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=April 2016}}

In these theories, spaces are regarded as being [[Social constructionism|socially constructed]]. To a large extent, the attachment of meaning works unconsciously, following socially accepted, mainstream categories and [[discourse]]s.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Meanings given to physical objects determine the actions deemed possible. For instance, a field of asphalt in a city centre might have multiple meanings: it may be interpreted as a parking area as well as a place for ball games, with both meanings competing for dominance. As soon as one meaning becomes superior, which is a result of [[Power (social and political)|social power relations]], the other meaning may decline, become invisible, and eventually is not used anymore. The superiority of a specific meaning over another one might be supported by artifacts representing meanings attached, such as signs on buildings, structural modifications of the physical environment, or symbols and explanations of the socio-cultural significance of places and objects in spatial representations visualized via geo-media.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

A mature appropriation of space therefore includes the conscious attachment of meaning as well as awareness of meanings being attached to places by others. It includes a sensibility to the multitude of meanings transported and hidden by a mainstream discourse. Keys to the mature appropriation of space are therefore the [[deconstruction]] of socially produced meanings, as well as the ability to communicate one's own, potentially contradictory meanings and negotiate them with others. This process is often mediated through the formation of a collective spatialized identity. Given that space – its uses and symbolic significance – is often the site of social and political struggle, it becomes the container for action while at the same time shaping the group development of a "us". In particular, when groups re-imagine public space for political usages, this expression of spatial citizenship is the outcome of a spatially informed collective identity.&lt;ref name="js"&gt;Sbicca, Joshua and Perdue, Robert. (2014). [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14742837.2013.822782 Protest Through Presence: Spatial Citizenship and Identity Formation in Contestations of Neoliberal Crises] Social Movement Studies, Volume 13, Issue 4 pp. 309-327&lt;/ref&gt;

== Spatial citizenship in the geoinformation society ==
Geographic media (geo-media) are especially important for attaching meaning to places as they clearly connect location, information and visualization. In addition to this, geo-media represents mainly single meanings out of the many that are possible. Nowadays, geo-media have become more and more present in everyday life due to [[mobile computing]] in combination with [[Geoweb]] applications. For instance, maps on [[smart phone]]s guide people in their everyday actions, but at the same time limit their opportunities for action by limiting the variety of potential meanings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fischer |first=Florian |date=2014 |chapter=Everyday geomedia use and the appropriation of space |editor1-last=Jekel |editor1-first=Thomas |editor2-last=Sanchez |editor2-first=Eric |editor3-last=Gryl |editor3-first=Inga |editor4-last=Juneau-Sion |editor4-first=Caroline |editor5-last=Lyon |editor5-first=John |title=Learning and teaching with geomedia |location=Newcastle upon Tyne, UK |publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing |pages=10–28 |isbn=9781443862134 |oclc=885014629 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=FDxQBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA10 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars of spatial citizenship understand geo-media as instruments of [[Human self-reflection|reflection]] and [[communication]].
* Reflection on geo-media means reflecting on the limitations of previously given meanings by using theories of [[critical cartography]] to ask which aspects of potential relevance for a certain spatial problem or decision making are included and excluded in the given meanings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Harley |first=John Brian |date=Summer 1989 |title=Deconstructing the map |journal=Cartographica |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=1–20 |url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/p/passages/4761530.0003.008?rgn=main;view=fulltext |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, self-reflection requires being aware of one's own, [[subjectivity|subjective]] [[hypothesis]] construction while using geo-media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=MacEachren |first1=Alan M. |last2=Buttenfield |first2=Barbara P. |last3=Campbell |first3=James B. |last4=DiBiase |first4=David W. |last5=Monmonier |first5=Mark |date=1992 |chapter=Visualization |editor1-last=Abler |editor1-first=Ronald |editor2-last=Marcus |editor2-first=Melvin G. |editor3-last=Olson |editor3-first=Judy M. |title=Geography's inner worlds: pervasive themes in contemporary American geography |series=Occasional publications of the Association of American Geographers |volume=2 |location=New Brunswick, NJ |publisher=[[Rutgers University Press]] |pages=99–137 |isbn=0813518296 |oclc=25008961 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both aspects allow for a more mature appropriation of space with geo-media, while being aware of and gaining insight into the construction process of meanings attached to space.
* Communication with geo-media means communicating using spatial representations. Thanks to [[usability|user-friendly]] [[web mapping]] tools within the Geoweb, users ([[prosumer]]s) can easily produce their own geo-media and share it web-wide. Collaboration features allow for the negotiation of constructions of space with other users, for example through [[volunteered geographic information]] (VGI). The study of spatial citizenship examines subjectivity, impact on everyday action, social power relations, competition, and negotiation in VGI.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Spatial citizenship also aims at increasing awareness of [[geographic information]] produced involuntarily by users through automatic data collection that many Geoweb platforms (especially mobile phones) include to support the interests of service providers (see [[location-based service]]s).

== Education ==
The goal of education for spatial citizenship is to enable learners to achieve a reflexive appropriation of space as the basis for mature action in space by reflective geo-media use and active, reflective geo-media production.&lt;ref name="Jekel2015"/&gt; Using a broad variety of learning environments orientated toward the learners' needs, the educational approach of spatial citizenship is applicable at different levels from [[primary education|primary]] to [[tertiary education]]. Apart from technological proficiency, spatial citizenship education aims at two additional main competencies:
* Being able to achieve a reflective use of geo-media, while understanding the process of the social construction of spaces, with the result of either consciously accepting given meanings or producing alternative meanings.
* Being able to communicate alternative meanings effectively with geo-media and using geo-media as instruments to support [[argumentation]] in negotiation processes on contradictory meanings.

== Scientific response ==
The [[European Commission]]-funded project SPACIT furthers education for spatial citizenship by developing teacher training standards, [[curriculum|curricula]], and learning modules for teacher education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=SPACIT: education for spatial citizenship |url=http://www.spatialcitizenship.org/ |publisher=[[European Commission]] |accessdate=2012-10-29 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another EU-funded project, digital-earth.eu, linked with the SPACIT project by connecting stakeholders using or interested in using geo-media in education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Digital-earth.eu |url=http://www.digital-earth.eu/ |publisher=[[European Commission]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150910112227/http://www.digital-earth.eu/ |archivedate=2015-09-10 |accessdate=2016-04-04 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; It supported spatial citizenship through the creation of [[Standards-based education reform|educational standards]], the collection of best-practice examples, and the provision of learning environments applicable to teachers in everyday classroom situations. Digital-earth.eu also promoted these concepts related to spatial citizenship in political circles concerned with the development of the Europe2020 goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Europe2020: Europe's growth strategy |url=http://ec.europa.eu/europe2020/index_en.htm |publisher=[[European Commission]] |accessdate=2012-11-04 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sumac Kawsay'''  ''Buen Vivir''  ("good living") rooted in the cosmovisión (or worldview) of the [[Quechua people|Quechua]] peoples of the Andes, sumak kawsay – or buen vivir, to give it its Spanish name – describes a way of doing things that is community-centric, ecologically-balanced and culturally-sensitive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/blog/buen-vivir-philosophy-south-america-eduardo-gudynas|title=Buen vivir: the social philosophy inspiring movements in South America|last=Balch|first=Oliver|date=2013-02-04|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-03-19|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept is related to tradition of legal and political scholarship advocating legal standing for the natural environment.&lt;ref name="Stone CD 1974 p 8"&gt;Stone CD, Should Trees Have Standing? Toward Legal Rights for Natural Objects. Southern California Law Review 1972;45:450; W Kaufmann, Los Altos, 1974 p 8&lt;/ref&gt; The rights approach is a break away from traditional environmental regulatory systems, which regard nature as property.&lt;ref name="Celdf"&gt;Community Environmental Legal Defense Fund (CELDF). 2008. http://www.celdf.org/, accessed April, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2000 animals, plants and other organisms have their rights to dignity recognised by the Constitution in Switzerland (art. 120), but the implications of this disposition are still not very clear. With the enactment of [[2008 Constitution of Ecuador|its 2008 Constitution]], [[Ecuador]] became the first country in the world to codify the Rights of Nature and to inform a more clarified content to those rights. Articles 10 and 71–74 of the Ecuadorian Constitution recognize the inalienable rights of [[ecosystems]] to exist and flourish, gives people the authority to petition on the behalf of ecosystems, and requires the government to remedy violations of these rights.

==History==
{{Further|Plant rights|Environmental movement}}

=== Rights of nature in legal history ===
In his famous work, "Should Trees Have Standing?", Christopher Stone presented the case for conferring legal personality and rights on the environment. As Stone explained, as a rights-holder the natural object would “have a legally recognised worth and dignity in its own right, and not merely to serve as a means to benefit ‘us’”. To achieve rights-holder status, the natural object must satisfy three criteria: [First], that the thing can institute legal actions at its behest; second, that in determining the granting of legal relief, the court must take injury to it into account; and third, that relief must run to the benefit of it.&lt;ref name="Stone CD 1974 p 8"/&gt;

In his dissenting opinion in the landmark environmental law case, ''[[Sierra Club v. Morton]]'', 405 U.S. 727 (1972), Justice [[William O. Douglas]] argued that "inanimate objects" should have standing to sue in court: {{quote|The critical question of "standing" would be simplified and also put neatly in focus if we fashioned a federal rule that allowed environmental issues to be litigated before federal agencies or federal courts in the name of the inanimate object about to be despoiled, defaced, or invaded by roads and bulldozers and where injury is the subject of public outrage. Contemporary public concern for protecting nature's ecological equilibrium should lead to the conferral of standing upon environmental objects to sue for their own preservation. This suit would therefore be more properly labeled as Mineral King v. Morton.&lt;ref name=405US727&gt;{{Cite court|title=a|url=http://supreme.justia.com/us/405/727/case.html#741|year=1972|accessdate=October 8, 2011|court=USSC|litigants=Sierra Club v. Morton|opinion=727|pinpoint=741–43|reporter=U.S.|vol=405}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}
Douglas continued: {{quote|Inanimate objects are sometimes parties in litigation. A ship has a legal personality, a [[Legal fiction|fiction]] found useful for maritime purposes. The [[corporation sole]]{{mdash}}a creature of ecclesiastical law{{mdash}}is an acceptable adversary and large fortunes ride on its cases.... So it should be as respects valleys, alpine meadows, rivers, lakes, estuaries, beaches, ridges, groves of trees, swampland, or even air that feels the destructive pressures of modern technology and modern life. The river, for example, is the living symbol of all the life it sustains or nourishes{{mdash}}fish, aquatic insects, water ouzels, otter, fisher, deer, elk, bear, and all other animals, including man, who are dependent on it or who enjoy it for its sight, its sound, or its life. The river as plaintiff speaks for the ecological unit of life that is part of it.&lt;ref name=405US727 /&gt;}}

===Outcome from neoliberal development in Ecuador===

The Rights of Nature articles in Ecuador's constitution are part of a reaction to a combination of political, economic, and social phenomena. Ecuador's abusive past with the [[oil industry]], most famously the [[Chevron Corporation#Environmental damage in Ecuador|class-action litigation]] against [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]], and the failure of an extraction-based economy and [[neoliberal]] reforms to bring economic prosperity to the region has resulted in the election of a New Leftist regime led by President [[Rafael Correa]], and sparked a demand for new approaches to development. In conjunction with this need, the principle of "''Buen Vivir''" or good living, which focuses on social, environmental and spiritual wealth versus material wealth, gained popularity among citizens and was incorporated into the new constitution.&lt;ref name="Gudynas"&gt;Gudynas, Eduardo. 2011. Buen Vivir: Today's Tomorrow Development 54(4):441-447.&lt;/ref&gt;

The influence of indigenous groups, from whom the concept of ''Buen Vivir'' originates, in the forming of the constitutional ideals also facilitated the incorporation of the Rights of Nature as a basic tenet of their culture and conceptualization of ''Buen Vivir''.&lt;ref name="Becker"&gt;Becker, Marc. 2011 Correa, Indigenous Movements, and the Writing of a New Constitution in Ecuador. Latin American Perspectives 38(1):47-62.&lt;/ref&gt;

The neoliberal development schemes in line with the "[[Washington Consensus]]" did not create prosperity for much of Ecuador's population, especially its [[Indigenous peoples in Ecuador|indigenous population]]s, who make up about 40% of the country's population.&lt;ref name="Acosta"&gt;Acosta, Alberto, Eduardo Gudynas, Esperanza Martínez, and Joseph H.

Policy Innovations. http://www.policyinnovations.org/ideas/briefings/data/000077&lt;/ref&gt; The economy, based on the exportation of the country's raw materials, mainly oil, was also wreaking havoc on the nation's environment, an area with valuable biological and cultural diversity.&lt;ref name="Arsel"&gt;Arsel, Murat 2012. Between 'Marx and Markets'? The State, The 'Left Turn' And Nature In Ecuador. Tijdschrift Voor Economische En Sociale Geografie (Journal of Economic &amp; Social Geography) 103(2):150-163.&lt;/ref&gt; The global economic crisis of 2008 revealed the vulnerabilities of an extractive economy, and led to a period of political turmoil in the country that made obviously the need for a new more inclusive government that embodied a post-oil, post-neoliberal development paradigm.&lt;ref name="Becker" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Acosta" /&gt; In late 2006, the election of leftist Rafael Correa, who ran on an anti-neoliberal platform, showed the emergence of a new political era for Ecuador.&lt;ref name="Arsel" /&gt;

===''Buen Vivir''===

''Buen Vivir'' ("good living") emerged as a response to the traditional strategies for development and their negative environmental, social, or economic effects. ''Buen Vivir'' is an alternative concept of development that focuses on the attainment of the "good life" in a broad sense, only attainable within a community; a community that includes Nature. A popular approach to ''Buen Vivir'' is the Ecuadorian concept of ''[[w:es:sumak kawsay|sumak kawsay]]'', meaning a full life in [[kichwa]]. Part of this concept also emphasizes living in harmony with other people and nature. ''Buen Vivir'' has gained new popularity, spreading throughout parts of [[South America]] and evolving as a multicultural concept. Social consensus led to the inclusion of ''Buen Vivir'' in Ecuador's new constitution, supported as an alternative to neoliberal development. The constitution outlines ''Buen Vivir'' as a set of rights, one of which is the rights of nature.&lt;ref name="Gudynas" /&gt; In line with the assertion of these rights, ''Buen Vivir'' changes the relationship between nature and humans to a more bio-pluralistic view, eliminating the separation between nature and society.&lt;ref name="Gudynas" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SENPLADES"&gt;SENPLADES. 2009 National Plan for Good Living. Electronic document, http://plan2009.senplades.gob.ec/web/en/presentation, accessed May, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indigenous movement===

The inclusion of "Buen Vivir" and Rights of Nature in the constitution was ushered in largely due to the increased influence of indigenous activist groups in the political realm. After several years of worsening economic and environmental conditions, uprisings from various indigenous communities, who found themselves receiving less support from the state, while simultaneously their land was being increasingly encroached upon by oil companies, brought attention to their concerns.&lt;ref name="Arsel" /&gt; After historically being excluded from the political process, indigenous groups, especially concerned about the worsening environmental devastation of the extraction business and global [[climate change]], started social movements aimed at creating a new approach to development that would protect the environment and harmonize its relationship with people. [[CONAIE]] (National Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador), the largest federation of indigenous movements, encompassing 14 of the nation's indigenous groups, and other groups focused on social justice began lobbying for a new constitution that incorporated recognition of the nation's indigenous groups, their language, culture, history, and land rights, and inherently their concepts of ''sumak kawsay'' and ''[[Pachamama]]'' (English: "Mother Nature").&lt;ref name="Becker" /&gt;

===Drafting===
President [[Rafael Correa]] included calling for a constitutional assembly in his 2006 campaign. On April 15, 2007, over 80% of Ecuadorians voted in favor of calling a new assembly, thanks in large part to the support of indigenous communities. Indigenous groups had been pressuring for a new, more inclusive constitution for years, and were therefore actively involved in the drafting process. Alberto Acosta, the elected Assembly President, pledged to make the assembly more inclusive and incorporate the concerns of the indigenous into the constitution. In the end, a few indigenous representatives were elected to the assembly.&lt;ref name="Becker" /&gt; To create a constitution based on the principles of ''Buen Vivir'', the Constitutional Assembly, with the advice of the [[Pachamama]] Alliance, enlisted the help of the Community Environmental Legal Defense Fund (CELDF) to draft language for the new provisions of the constitution detailing the Rights of Nature.&lt;ref name="Celdf" /&gt; Indigenous groups also played a role in the drafting process. Fundación Pachamama, in conjunction with leaders in CONAIE, met with members of the assembly to present their ideas for the constitution and gain support. A national media campaign detailing the tenets of the new constitution and the Rights of Nature was also launched to inform and gain support from the public.&lt;ref name="FP"&gt;Fundación Pachamama (FP). 2011 [http://www.derechosdelanaturaleza.org/website/files/2011/01/Recogniting-Rights-for-Nature-in-the-Ecuadorian-Constitution-Fundacion-Pachamama1.pdf "Recognizing Rights for Nature in the Ecuadorian Constitution"]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adoption===
On April 10, 2008, with 91 votes out of 130, the [[Ecuadorian Constituent Assembly|Constitutional Assembly]] approved Article 10 for inclusion in the new constitution. On June 7, the language of Articles 71 through 74, compiling the Rights of Nature, were presented and debated on, before receiving approval for inclusion in the constitution.&lt;ref name="FP" /&gt;
 
On September 28, 2008, a mandatory [[referendum]] was held to vote on the new constitution, where the adoption of the constitution was approved by 65% of voters.&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;Smith, Gar. 2009, "In Ecuador, Trees Now Have Rights", ''Earth Island Journal'' 23(4):15-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chapter seven===

===Rights of nature===

'''Article 71.''' Nature, or Pacha Mama, where life is reproduced and occurs, has the right to integral respect for its existence and for the maintenance and regeneration of its life cycles, structure, functions and evolutionary processes.
All persons, communities, peoples and nations can call upon public authorities to enforce the rights of nature. To enforce and interpret these rights, the principles set forth in the Constitution shall be observed, as appropriate.
The State shall give incentives to natural persons and legal entities and to communities to protect nature and to promote respect for all the elements comprising an ecosystem.

'''Article 72.''' Nature has the right to be restored. This restoration shall be apart from the obligation of the State and natural persons or legal entities to compensate individuals and communities that depend on affected natural systems.
In those cases of severe or permanent environmental impact, including those caused by the exploitation of nonrenewable natural resources, the State shall establish the most effective mechanisms to achieve the restoration and shall adopt adequate measures to eliminate or mitigate harmful environmental consequences.

'''Article 73.''' The State shall apply preventive and restrictive measures on activities that might lead to the extinction of species, the destruction of ecosystems and the permanent alteration of natural cycles.
The introduction of organisms and organic and inorganic material that might definitively alter the nation’s genetic assets is forbidden.

'''Article 74.''' Persons, communities, peoples, and nations shall have the right to benefit from the environment and the natural wealth enabling them to enjoy the good way of living.
Environmental services shall not be subject to appropriation; their production, delivery, use and development shall be regulated by the State.&lt;ref name="PDBA"&gt;[http://pdba.georgetown.edu/Constitutions/Ecuador/english08.html "2008 Constitution of the Republic of Ecuador. Political Database of the Americas (PDBA)"].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==
The Rights of Nature is significant as it is the first case where this concept has been evoked at the national level. The articles set out a rights-based system that recognizes Nature, or ''Pachamama'', as a right-bearing entity that holds value in itself, apart from human use. This differs from traditional systems that see nature as property, giving landowners the right to damage or destroy ecosystems that depend on their land. The rights-based approach spelled out in the Rights of Nature expands on previous laws for regulation and conservation by recognizing that nature has fundamental and inalienable rights as a valuable entity in and of itself. The system also assigns liability for damage to the environment and holds the government responsible for the reparation of any damage. Additionally, if an ecosystem's rights are violated, it gives people the authority to petition on behalf of the ecosystem to ensure that its interests are not subverted to the interests of individuals or corporations.&lt;ref name="Celdf" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Acosta" /&gt;
 
The inclusion of the Rights of Nature also makes the constitution more democratic and inclusive, as it reflects the indigenes' idea of Nature as a mother that must be respected and celebrated. This is the first constitution that has incorporated indigenous concepts of ''sumak kawsay'' and ''Pachamama'', as well as recognized the [[plurinationality]] of Ecuador. This has broad significance for the recognition of indigenous groups and their right to preserve their land and culture. The combination of human rights with the rights of nature will allow for more effective protection of indigenous communities.&lt;ref name="FP" /&gt;
 
The Rights of Nature also transforms the relationship between nature and humans by asserting that nature is not just an object.&lt;ref name="Mychalejko"&gt;Mychalejko, Cyril. 2008 Ecuador's Constitution Gives Rights to Nature. Philadelphia Independent Media Center.&lt;/ref&gt; By putting ecosystems on an equal footing with humans, the conception of humans as masters or as separate from nature is dismissed.&lt;ref name="Gudynas" /&gt; Instead, this system celebrates nature and recognizes that humans are a part of it.&lt;ref name="Arsel" /&gt;
 
The Rights of Nature are further incorporated in the updated National Plan for Good Living, which states guaranteeing the Rights of Nature and promoting a healthy and sustainable environment as one of its twelve objectives. Policies under the objective include aims to preserve and manage biodiversity, diversify the national energy matrix with renewable sources, prevent, control and mitigate environmental damage, promote adaptation to and [[mitigation of climate change]], and incorporate environmental approach in all public policies.&lt;ref name="SENPLADES" /&gt;

===Legal effects===
The Rights of Nature has been applied to several legal disputes and considered in government development initiatives.

====Wheeler c. Director de la Procuraduria General Del Estado de Loja====
''Wheeler c. Director de la Procuraduria General Del Estado de Loja'' was the first case in history to vindicate the Rights of Nature. The lawsuit was filed against the local government near Rio Vilcabamba in March 2011, who were responsible for a road expansion project that dumped debris into the river, narrowing its width and thereby doubling its speed. The project was also done without the completion of an [[environmental impact assessment]] or consent of the local residents. The case was filed by two such residents, citing the violation of the Rights of Nature, rather than property rights, for the damage done to the river. The case was important because the court stated that the rights of nature would prevail over other constitutional rights if they were in conflict with each other, setting an important precedent. The proceedings also confirmed that the burden of proof to show there is no damage lies with the defendant. Though the plaintiffs were granted a victory in court, the enforcement of the ruling has been lacking, as the local government has been slow to comply with the mandated reparations.&lt;ref name="Daly"&gt;Daly, Erin. 2012, [http://celdf.live2.radicaldesigns.org/downloads/The_Ecuadorian_Exemplar_The_First_Ever_Vindications_of_Constitutional_Rights_of_Nature.pdf "Ecuadorian Exemplar: The First Ever Vindications of Constitutional Rights"], ''Review of European Community &amp; International Environmental Law'' 21(1): 63-66.&lt;/ref&gt;

====República del Ecuador Asamblea Nacional, Comisión de la Biodiversidad y Recursos Naturales====
In March 2011, right after the ruling on the ''Wheeler'' case, the government of Ecuador filed a case against illegal gold mining operations in northern Ecuador, in the remote districts San Lorenzo and Eloy Alfaro. The rights of nature were violated by the mining operations, which were argued to be polluting the nearby rivers. This case is different from the previous in that it was the government addressing the violation of the rights of nature. It was also swiftly enforced, as military operation to destroy the machinery used for illegal mining was ordered and implemented.&lt;ref name="Daly" /&gt;

====Yasuni ITT initiative====
The Yasuni-Ishpingo, Tambococha, and Tiputini (ITT) Initiative, referring to the corridor of oil reserves within the [[Yasuni National Park]], is the first post-oil development initiative that recognizes that the benefits gained from the [[Amazon rainforest|Amazon]] are greater than the economic benefits from oil extraction. The aim of the initiative is therefore to protect the biodiversity of the area, which UNESCO has declared a biodiversity reserve, by keeping the oil reserves in the ground, in return for compensation from the international community for at least half of the projected benefit Ecuador would receive from the oil extraction (approximately $3.5 billion). These funds would be used to fund other economic initiatives to alleviate poverty and develop the renewable energy sector. The importance of keeping the oil in the ITT area in the ground has been argued as of international importance to mitigate the effects of global climate change by preventing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions and the local environmental devastation the extraction would cause. The Rights of Nature and other articles of the new constitution also make the protection of the park a legal imperative, as the extraction would be a violation of nature's rights.&lt;ref name="Acosta" /&gt; Though there originally was some difficulty evoking a sense of international responsibility to fund the initiative, especially with the national constitution requiring this law already, eventually in August 2010 Ecuador came to an arrangement with the UNDP for funding of the initiative through the issue of Yasuní Guarantee Certificates, denoting the amount of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions avoided and their monetary value, which can potentially be used in the [[European Union]] [[European Union Emission Trading Scheme|Emission Trading Scheme]].&lt;ref name="Arsel" /&gt;

==Reactions==

===Praise===
The adoption of the Rights of Nature by Ecuador has received praise internationally by many countries who see this as a revolutionary way to conceptualize the environment and a way for Ecuador to move beyond the extractive economy of its past.&lt;ref name="Madden" /&gt; Initiatives to adopt the concept of ecosystem rights have been taken or are being taken in various parts of the world, including Bolivia, Turkey, Nepal, and various municipalities in the United States.&lt;ref name="Celdf" /&gt;

===Criticisms===
Criticisms of the Rights of Nature have generally centered on the mechanisms of enforcement of the provision. One criticism is that though the constitution establishes stronger regulations for the environment, it also gives the state the power to relax these regulations if found to be in the national interest.&lt;ref name="Arsel" /&gt; Therefore, much of the enforcement of the ecosystem rights depends on the will of the government, or an active citizenry.&lt;ref name="Becker" /&gt; Indigenous groups have also expressed dissatisfaction that the constitution does not give local communities veto power over projects affecting their land.&lt;ref name="FP" /&gt; Others also feel a major weakness of the constitution is that it does not require prior or informed consent by communities before the start of development projects, which can undermine their ability to uphold the rights of nature.&lt;ref name="Mychalejko" /&gt; There are also concerns that the Rights of Nature could negatively affect [[foreign direct investment]] since companies will not want to comply with the more stringent regulations.&lt;ref name="Madden" /&gt; On the other hand, people are skeptical of the Correa administration for still approving projects by foreign extraction companies violating the Rights of Nature.&lt;ref name="Mychalejko" /&gt;

[[File:Sumernetlogo.JPG|thumbnail|right|SUMERNET Logo]]

The '''Sustainable Mekong Research Network''' ('''SUMERNET''') is a network of organizations committed to the [[sustainability|sustainable development]] of the [[Greater Mekong Subregion|Greater Mekong Region]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sumernet.org/&lt;/ref&gt; Launched in 2005, SUMERNET supports policy-relevant research and outreach activities to inform and engage policy-makers, planners and stakeholders. Within this context, it pursues an evolving agenda in response to questions and policy issues that arise in the region. Current research themes are climate-compatible development, regional economic integration, and [[ecosystem services]] and local development. The network works on a range of issues including natural ecosystems governance, floods and natural disasters, climate change and adaptation, and transboundary resource flows.&lt;ref&gt;Le Anh Tuan and Suppakorn Chinvanno (2011).Climate Change in the Mekong River Delta and Key Concerns on Future Climate Threats. In “Environmental Change and Agricultural Sustainability in the Mekong Delta”, Stewart, Mart A.; Coclanis, Peter A. (Eds.). Springer, 2011, XVI, 456 p.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins and Foundations ==
SUMERNET was launched in 2005, financed by the [[Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency|Swedish International Development Agency (Sida)]]. Since then, SUMERNET's work has also attracted support from the Climate and Development Knowledge Network (CDKN) and from partner institutes across the region. Membership has grown from the 14 organizations, to more than 50 affiliated organizations now.

SUMERNET was conceived at a time of accelerated development in the region. Major roads and other infrastructure projects were being planned and built; bilateral and multilateral economic and trade agreements were being made, and there was a vigorous debate going on about the future of the Mekong Region. Many development agencies expressed concerns and called for an integrated approach that would incorporate a greater diversity of views and perspectives into regional planning and policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stockholm Environmental Institute (SEI)|title=Sustainable Mekong Research Network Programme (SUMERNET)|url=http://sei-international.org/projects?prid=266|publisher=SEI|accessdate=28 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SUMERNET was established to help meet that need by supporting and promoting the use of scientific evidence in policy-making, with the overarching goal of contributing to sustainable development in the Mekong Region. In the seven years since its inception, SUMERNET has sponsored a wealth of policy-relevant research and worked to create an ‘enabling environment’ for researchers and decision-makers to engage with one another.

The SUMERNET Secretariat, at the [[Stockholm Environment Institute|Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI)]] Asia Centre in Bangkok, actively supports the network’s activities, drawing on both regional and global intellectual resources.

== Mission ==
SUMERNET's mission is to '''inform and influence sustainable development in the Mekong Region by supporting credible, collaborative research; stimulating independent discussions on key regional issues, and engaging with decision-makers and stakeholders to foster more effective and sustainable policies and programmes.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=SUMERNET|title=SUMERNET Vision Guide|year=2013|publisher=SUMERNET Secretariat|location=Bangkok}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A key aspect of SUMERNET’s work is to '''bridge science and policy'''; SUMERNET does this by choosing research questions that are directly relevant to current policy debates, engaging decision-makers in all aspects of our activities, and building capacity for sustainable development through workshops and other activities. SUMERNET also emphasizes collaboration, networking and knowledge-sharing, connecting partners in different countries through our projects and events, and works to strengthen research capacity across the region.

== Implementation Phases ==
Since the time of its establishment, SUMERNET has coordinated three implementation phases: Phase I (2005 - 2008), Phase II (2010 - 2013) and currently Phase III (2014 - 2017).

=== Phase I (2005 - 2008) ===

Phase I established SUMERNET as a genuinely independent regionally owned platform and has a "voice" in a way that other comparable networks do not, which are often seen to be activist and essentially foreign-driven and discounted in influence as a result. Sumernet Phase I also had positive impacts for its partners (both individuals and their institutions) in terms of capacity-building through both training and conduct of research and also through the promotion of cross-border linkages.

Phase I supported 9 research projects, namely:

# Incentives as a means to achieving sustainable land and water management in the Greater Mekong Sub-Region: Developing a framework for PES in the hydropower sector in the region.
# Assessment of regional value chains for promoting sustainable fisheries development in the Mekong Delta
# Study on local community institutions to cope with the flood situation of the Mekong region
# The potential role of integrated farming systems (IFS) for poverty alleviation in the Mekong Basin: An assessment of farmer based networks in promoting IFS
# Towards policy relevant knowledge in the Mekong: Exploring the links between sustainability research and policy
# Regional migration: a feasible option for livelihood diversification for the regional poor?
# Incentive Based Approaches for Sustainability in the Mekong
# Meeting regional and global demands for rubber: A viable option for poverty alleviation in the Mekong Basin?
# Rubber: Costs or Benefits to the Lao PDR?

By the end of Phase I, SUMERNET is well on in the process of becoming known as a knowledge producer and a focus of research collaborators and development actors. This gives it a place in regional development as a focus of research and a policy forum. SUMERNET aims to make more headway in policy engagement and policy impact in a second phase.  Phase I has served as a good “testing ground” for this new alliance and its agenda for producing knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=SEI Asia Center|title=Sustainable Mekong, Final Report to Sida|year=2009|publisher=SEI Asia Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Phase II (2010 - 2013) ===
SUMERNET Phase II has been established upon the basis of policy-relevant collaborative research among researchers in Mekong region. SUMERNET, since the beginning of the current phase, has been encouraging researchers to develop collaboration with other researchers in other countries in the Mekong region, therefore typical feature of SUMERNET research project in Phase II is that the researchers originate from more than one country. This cross-country collaboration has strengthened the relevance of SUMERNET research findings beyond the national and sub-national levels into the regional policy level.

In Phase II, SUMERNET has invested its resources to develop capacity of researchers in the region by incorporating mentoring support of research project team. The mentoring support was highly appreciated by partners, as they benefited from the expertise of the mentors in improving the credibility of their research results and quality of the research outputs. Besides the mentoring, SUMERNET supported several workshops to enhance their capacity to generate outputs specifically intended for the academic and specific-interest audience, such as journal articles and book chapters, and working papers. The success of the capacity building support for researchers was illustrated by generation of numerous peer-review publication outputs, on various stages manuscript to accepted, and also a high-quality of book chapters produced for the SUMERNET flagship book publication expected to be published in early 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=SEI Asia Center|title=Final Report - Sustainable Mekong Research Network Phase II (2010 – 2013)|year=2013|publisher=SEI Asia Center|location=Bangkok, Thailand}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Supporting and sustaining high quality research remains the key effort in SUMERNET Phase II.  From the wide vista of sustainable development challenges in the region, four research areas have been identified as the strategic research themes for Phase II:

* '''Ecosystem services''', resource use and impacts, including: (a) conservation of critical ecosystems, (b) environmental sustainability, (c) biodiversity corridors, and (d) economic corridor sustainability.
* '''Trans-boundary issues'''. The focus is on the analysis of long-term impacts of national economics including trade and natural resources use on the sustainability of the region, and on searching for sustainable paths for regional cooperation and development.
* '''Energy &amp; climate change''': energy security, climate change and linkages of the two with economic development. The research under this theme directly aims at this target to support the formulation or development of national strategies in this area.
* '''Poverty and livelihoods''': This theme is linked with the other three themes described above and will be a thread that runs through all aspects of Sumernet research activities.

These themes are themselves broad in character: they will be refined, prioritised and turned into specific research questions by the network members and in consultation with policy makers to understand what knowledge they need and how decisions on key sustainable development issues can be informed and influenced by better understanding of the immediate and long-term implications of key environmental and development trends in the region.

From those themes, 10 the research projects emerged within SUMERNET Phase II:

# Vulnerability assessment of livelihoods in Lower Mekong Basin: Adaptation options for enhancing capacity of people living in the most vulnerable flood-prone areas in Cambodia and Vietnam
# Making economic integration work for the rural poor through contract farming practices
# Evaluation of Pilot Program on Payment for Forest Environmental Services in Vietnam and Policy Implication for Laos and Cambodia
# Trans-boundary Fish Trade in the Lower Mekong Basin: Impacts on Fisheries and Rural Employment in Cambodia, Lao PDR and Thailand
# Impact of Urban Expansion on the Hinterland and Local Responses in the Mekong Region: A Study in Khon Kaen, Thailand, and Vang Vieng, Lao PDR
# Research on Integrating Community-based Participatory Carbon Measurement and Monitoring with Satellite Remote Sensing and GIS in a Measurement, Reporting and Verification (MRV) System for Reducing Emission from Deforestation and Forest Degradation-Plus (REDD+) and Agroforestry Carbon Sequestration Activities
# Communicating water-related climate change risks to improve local adaptation in the deltas of the Mekong Region
# Climate change implications to food security and livelihood of small-scale farmers
# Sustainable urban tourism through low carbon initiatives: Experiences from Hue and Chiang Mai
# Participatory Social Return on Investment (PSROI): Greater Mekong Basin Climate Change Adaptation Planning and Costing Project

These research projects are co-supported by the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida) and the [[CDKN|Climate and Development Knowledge Network (CDKN)]].

=== Phase III (2014 - 2017) ===

After 2 implementation phases which generated credible research results, SUMERNET has now established a successful and expanding regional research network with expertise in several policy areas critical to sustainability. Building upon the foundation of SUMERNET – a collaboration among 50 research and policy-making institutions with a strong track record, SUMERNET Phase III will be in a strategic position to inform and influence policy-making in the Mekong Region towards more socially inclusive and gender-responsive sustainable development.

In response to shifting knowledge demands and policy debates in the region, SUMERNET Phase III will focus its work on three key issues:

* '''Climate-compatible development'''. The rising energy demand and rapid urbanization that have typically accompanied economic growth in Southeast Asia represent significant challenges and opportunities for climate-compatible development.  SUMERNET research is promoting human development while addressing both mitigation of, and adaptation to, climate change.
* '''Regional economic integration'''. Greater regional economic integration has been promoted widely in the region, most notably as part of the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) activities leading to increased transborder trade and investment activities. But poverty and inequality as well as transboundary environmental degradation need pressing attention.
* '''Ecosystem services and local development'''. Local development in rural and peri-urban settings is often greatly affected by the condition of ecosystems and the services they provide. Research and policy-oriented assessments are needed to help maintain and improve ecosystem services throughout the Mekong region to ensure the well-being of societies and households who derive their livelihoods from natural resources.

SUMERNET Phase III is being supported by Swedish International Development Agency (Sida).

'''Technology education''' is the study of [[technology]], in which students "learn about the processes and knowledge related to technology".&lt;ref&gt;[[International Technology and Engineering Educators Association|ITEA]]. (2000). Standards for technological literacy; Content for the study of technology. Executive Summary. Reston, Va, p. 242&lt;/ref&gt; As a field of study, it covers the human ability to shape and change the physical world to meet needs, by manipulating materials and [[tools]] with techniques. It addresses the disconnect between wide usage and the lack of knowledge about technical components of technologies used and how to fix them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Technology Education Today: International Perspectives|last=de Vries|first=Marc|last2=Fletcher|first2=Stefan|last3=Labudde|first3=Peter|last4=Lang|first4=Martin|last5=Mammes|first5=Ingelore|last6=Max|first6=Charles|last7=Munk|first7=Dieter|last8=Nicholl|first8=Bill|last9=Strobel|first9=Johannes|publisher=Waxmann Verlag|year=2016|isbn=9783830933847|location=Munster|pages=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; This emergent discipline seeks to contribute to the learners' overall [[Scientific literacy|scientific]] and [[technological literacy]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Technology Education in School and Industry: Emerging Didactics for Human Resource Development|last=Blandow|first=Dietrich|last2=Dyrenfurth|first2=Michael|publisher=Springer-Verlag|year=1994|isbn=3540582509|location=Berlin|pages=312}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technology education should not be confused with [[educational technology]]. Educational technology focuses on a more narrow subset of technology use that revolves around the use of technology in and for education as opposed to technology education's focus on technology's use in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dugger Jr.|first=William E.|last2=Naik|first2=Nitin|date=September 2001|title=Clarifying Misconceptions between Technology Education and Educational Technology|url=https://www.iteea.org/File.aspx?id=49264|journal=Technology Teacher|volume=61|issue=1|pages=31–35|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Technology education is an offshoot of the [[Industrial arts|Industrial Arts]] tradition in the [[United States]] and the Craft teaching or vocational education in other countries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1980, through what was called the "Futuring Project", the name of "[[industrial arts education]]" was changed to be "technology education" in [[New York (state)|New York State]]; the goal of this movement was to increase students' technological literacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.oswego.edu/technology/history-1/|title=History {{!}} Department of Technology|last=|first=|date=|website=www.oswego.edu|at=sec. Technology Education|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the nature of technology education is significantly different from its predecessor, Industrial Arts teachers underwent inservice education in the mid-1980s while a Technology Training Network was also established by the New York State Education Department (NYSED).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

In Sweden, technology as a new subject emerged from the tradition of crafts subjects while in countries like Taiwan and Australia, its elements are discernible in historical vocational programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Technology Education for Teachers|last=Williams|first=John|last2=Williams|first2=Anthony|publisher=Macmillan Education Australia Pty Ltd|year=1996|isbn=0732940907|location=South Melbourne|pages=286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 21st century, [[Mars suit]] design was utilized as a topic for technology education.&lt;ref name="nasa3"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nasa.gov/audience/foreducators/topnav/materials/listbytype/Designing_Spacesuits_Mars.html|title=Designing Spacesuits for Mars|website=NASA|accessdate=2018-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Technical education is entirely different from general education

== Current State of Technology Education ==
TeachThought, a private entity, described technology education as being in the “status of childhood and bold experimentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.teachthought.com/technology/the-current-state-of-technology-in-the-classroom-infographic/|title=The Current State Of Technology In The Classroom [Infographic] -|date=2013-03-20|work=TeachThought|access-date=2018-07-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;” A survey of teachers across the United States by an independent market research company found out that 86 percent of teacher-respondents agree that technology must be used in the classroom. 96 percent say it promotes engagement of students and 89% agree technology improves student outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.fractuslearning.com/edtech-stats/|title=18 EdTech Stats About the Current State of Technology in Education|date=2013-08-26|work=Fractus Learning|access-date=2018-07-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Technology is present in many education systems.

[[File:MarsTransitionV.jpg|thumb|180px|right|An artist's conception shows a terraformed [[Mars]] in four stages of development.]]

'''Terraforming''' or '''terraformation''' (literally, "Earth-shaping") of a [[planet]], [[natural satellite|moon]], or other body is the [[hypothesis|hypothetical]] process of deliberately modifying its [[atmosphere]], [[temperature]], surface [[topography]] or [[ecology]] to be similar to the environment of [[Earth]] to make it [[planetary habitability|habitable]] by Earth-like life.

The concept of terraforming developed from both [[science fiction]] and actual [[science]]. The term was coined by [[Jack Williamson]] in a science-fiction short story ("[[Collision Orbit]]") published during 1942 in ''[[Astounding Science Fiction]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.jessesword.com/sf/view/125| title=Science Fiction Citations: terraforming| accessdate=2006-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the concept may [[Terraforming in popular culture|pre-date this work]].

Even if the environment of a planet could be altered deliberately, the feasibility of creating an unconstrained planetary environment that mimics Earth on another planet has yet to be verified. [[Mars]] is usually considered to be the most likely candidate for terraforming. Much study has been done concerning the possibility of heating the planet and altering its atmosphere, and [[NASA]] has even hosted debates on the subject. Several potential methods of [[Terraforming of Mars|altering the climate of Mars]] may fall within humanity's technological capabilities, but at present the economic resources required to do so are far beyond that which any government or society is willing to allocate to it. The long timescales and practicality of terraforming are the subject of debate. Other unanswered questions relate to the [[ethics of terraforming|ethics]], [[logistics]], [[economics]], [[politics]], and [[methodology]] of altering the environment of an extraterrestrial world.

==History of scholarly study==
The renowned astronomer [[Carl Sagan]] proposed the [[planetary engineering]] of Venus in an article published in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' in 1961.&lt;ref name="The Planet Venus"&gt;{{cite journal| journal=Science| year=1961|doi=10.1126/science.133.3456.849  |title=The Planet Venus| first=Carl| last=Sagan|bibcode = 1961Sci...133..849S| volume=133| issue=3456| pages=849–58| pmid=17789744 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sagan imagined seeding the atmosphere of [[Venus]] with [[algae]], which would convert water, nitrogen and carbon dioxide into [[organic compound]]s. As this process removed [[carbon dioxide]] from the atmosphere, the [[greenhouse effect]] would be reduced until surface temperatures dropped to "comfortable" levels. The resulting carbon, Sagan supposed, would be incinerated by the high surface temperatures of Venus, and thus be [[Carbon sequestering|sequestered]] in the form of "graphite or some involatile form of carbon" on the planet's surface.&lt;ref name="Sagan276"&gt;Sagan 1997, pp. 276–7.&lt;/ref&gt; However, later discoveries about the conditions on [[Venus]] made this particular approach impossible. One problem is that the clouds of Venus are composed of a highly concentrated [[sulfuric acid]] solution. Even if atmospheric algae could thrive in the hostile environment of Venus's upper atmosphere, an even more insurmountable problem is that its atmosphere is simply far too thick—the high atmospheric pressure would result in an "atmosphere of nearly pure molecular oxygen" and cause the planet's surface to be thickly covered in fine graphite powder.&lt;ref name="Sagan276"/&gt; This volatile combination could not be sustained through time. Any carbon that was fixed in organic form would be liberated as carbon dioxide again through combustion, "short-circuiting" the terraforming process.&lt;ref name="Sagan276"/&gt;

Sagan also visualized making [[Mars]] habitable for human life in "Planetary Engineering on Mars" (1973), an article published in the journal ''[[Icarus (journal)|Icarus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Planetary Engineering on Mars| journal=Icarus| year=1973| first=Carl| last=Sagan|doi=10.1016/0019-1035(73)90026-2|volume=20|page=513| bibcode=1973Icar...20..513S|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three years later, NASA addressed the issue of planetary engineering officially in a study, but used the term "planetary ecosynthesis" instead.&lt;ref&gt;Averner&amp;amp; MacElroy, 1976&lt;/ref&gt; The study concluded that it was possible for Mars to support life and be made into a [[Planetary habitability|habitable planet]]. The first conference session on terraforming, then referred to as "Planetary Modeling", was organized that same year.

In March 1979, NASA engineer and author [[James Oberg]] organized the First Terraforming Colloquium, a special session at the Lunar and Planetary Science Conference in Houston. Oberg popularized the terraforming concepts discussed at the colloquium to the general public in his book ''New Earths'' (1981).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Oberg| first=James Edward| year=1981| title=New Earths: Restructuring Earth and Other Planets| publisher=Stackpole Books, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not until 1982 was the word ''terraforming'' used in the title of a published journal article. Planetologist Christopher McKay wrote "Terraforming Mars", a paper for the ''[[Journal of the British Interplanetary Society]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Journal of the British Interplanetary Society| first=Christopher| last=McKay| title=Terraforming Mars| year=1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paper discussed the prospects of a self-regulating Martian biosphere, and McKay's use of the word has since become the preferred term.
In 1984, [[James Lovelock]] and Michael Allaby published ''The Greening of Mars''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|year=1984| title=The Greening of Mars|author1=Lovelock, James  |author2=Allaby, Michael |lastauthoramp=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lovelock's book was one of the first to describe a novel method of warming Mars, where [[chlorofluorocarbon]]s (CFCs) are added to the atmosphere.

Motivated by Lovelock's book, biophysicist [[Robert Haynes]] worked behind the scenes{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} to promote terraforming, and contributed the [[neologism]] '''''Ecopoiesis''''',&lt;ref&gt;Haynes, RH (1990), "Ecce Ecopoiesis: Playing God on Mars", in MacNiven, D. (1990-07-13), ''Moral Expertise: studies in practical and professional ethics,'' Routledge. pp. 161–163. {{ISBN|0-415-03576-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; forming the word from the Greek {{lang|grc|οἶκος}}, ''oikos'', "house",&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|oi{{=}}kos1|οἶκος|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and {{lang|grc|ποίησις}}, ''poiesis'', "production".&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|poi/hsis|ποίησις|shortref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Ecopoiesis refers to the ''origin of an ecosystem''.  In the context of space exploration, Haynes describes ecopoiesis as the "fabrication of a sustainable ecosystem on a currently lifeless, sterile planet".  Fogg defines ecopoiesis as a type of [[planetary engineering]] and is one of the first stages of terraformation. This primary stage of ecosystem creation is usually restricted to the initial seeding of microbial life.&lt;ref name="EPE"&gt;{{cite book| last=Fogg| first=Martyn J.| year=1995| title=Terraforming: Engineering Planetary Environments| publisher=SAE International, Warrendale, PA.}}&lt;/ref&gt; As conditions approach that of Earth, plant life could be brought in, and this will accelerate the production of oxygen, theoretically making the planet eventually able to support animal life.

===Aspects and definitions===
Beginning in 1985, [[Martyn J. Fogg]] began publishing several articles on terraforming. He also served as editor for a full issue on terraforming for the ''Journal of the British Interplanetary Society'' in 1992. In his book ''Terraforming: Engineering Planetary Environments'' (1995), Fogg proposed the following definitions for different aspects related to terraforming:&lt;ref name="EPE" /&gt;
* [[Planetary engineering]]: the application of technology for the purpose of influencing the global properties of a planet.
* [[Climate engineering|Geoengineering]]: planetary engineering applied specifically to Earth. It includes only those macroengineering concepts that deal with the alteration of some global parameter, such as the greenhouse effect, atmospheric composition, [[insolation]] or impact flux.
* Terraforming: a process of planetary engineering, specifically directed at enhancing the capacity of an extraterrestrial planetary environment to support life as we know it. The ultimate achievement in terraforming would be to create an open planetary [[ecosystem]] emulating all the functions of the [[biosphere]] of Earth, one that would be fully habitable for human beings.

Fogg also devised definitions for candidate planets of varying degrees of human compatibility:&lt;ref&gt;Fogg, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;
* Habitable Planet (HP): A world with an environment sufficiently similar to Earth as to allow comfortable and free human habitation.
* Biocompatible Planet (BP): A planet possessing the necessary physical parameters for life to flourish on its surface. If initially lifeless, then such a world could host a [[biosphere]] of considerable complexity without the need for terraforming.
* Easily Terraformable Planet (ETP): A planet that might be rendered biocompatible, or possibly habitable, and maintained so by modest planetary engineering techniques and with the limited resources of a starship or robot precursor mission.

Fogg suggests that [[Mars]] was a biologically compatible planet in its youth, but is not now in any of these three categories, because it can only be terraformed with greater difficulty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/32348444|title=Terraforming : engineering planetary environments|last=1960-|first=Fogg, Martyn J.,|date=1995|publisher=Society of Automotive Engineers|isbn=1560916095|oclc=32348444}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Habitability requirements==
{{main|Planetary habitability}}
An absolute requirement for life is an energy source, but the notion of planetary habitability implies that many other geophysical, geochemical, and astrophysical criteria must be met before the surface of an astronomical body is able to support life. Of particular interest is the set of factors that has sustained complex, multicellular animals in addition to simpler organisms on Earth. Research and theory in this regard is a component of [[planetary science]] and the emerging discipline of [[astrobiology]].

In its astrobiology roadmap, [[NASA]] has defined the principal habitability criteria as "extended regions of liquid water, conditions favorable for the assembly of complex [[organic molecule]]s, and energy sources to sustain [[metabolism]]."&lt;ref name=NASA1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://astrobiology.arc.nasa.gov/roadmap/g1.html |title=Goal 1: Understand the nature and distribution of habitable environments in the Universe |accessdate=2007-08-11 |publisher=[[NASA]] |work=Astrobiology: Roadmap |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110117011137/http://astrobiology.arc.nasa.gov/roadmap/g1.html |archivedate=2011-01-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preliminary stages==
Once conditions become more suitable for [[life]] of the [[introduced species]], the importation of [[microbial]] life could begin.&lt;ref name="EPE"/&gt;  As conditions approach that of Earth, [[plants|plant life]] could also be brought in.  This would accelerate the production of oxygen, which theoretically would make the planet eventually able to support [[animal]] life.

==Prospective targets==

[[File:TerraformedMars.jpg|thumb|right|210px|Artist's conception of a terraformed Mars]]

===Mars===
{{main|Terraforming of Mars}}

In many respects, [[Mars]] is the most Earth-like planet in the Solar System.&lt;ref&gt;Read and Lewis 2004, p.16; Kargel 2004, pp. 185–6.&lt;/ref&gt; It is thought that Mars once had a more Earth-like environment early in its history, with a thicker atmosphere and abundant water that was lost over the course of hundreds of millions of years.&lt;ref&gt;Kargel 2004, 99''ff''&lt;/ref&gt;

The exact mechanism of this loss is still unclear, though three mechanisms in particular seem likely: First, whenever surface water is present, [[carbon dioxide]] ({{chem|C|O|2}}) reacts with rocks to form [[carbonate]]s, thus drawing atmosphere off and binding it to the planetary surface. On Earth, this process is counteracted when [[plate tectonics]] works to cause volcanic eruptions that vent carbon dioxide back to the atmosphere. On Mars, the lack of such tectonic activity worked to prevent the recycling of gases locked up in sediments.&lt;ref name="forgetmars81"&gt;Forget, Costard &amp;amp; Lognonné 2007, pp. 80–2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Second, the lack of a [[magnetosphere]] around Mars may have allowed the [[solar wind]] to gradually erode the atmosphere.&lt;ref name="forgetmars81" /&gt; [[Convection]] within the core of Mars, which is made mostly of [[iron]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author = Dave Jacqué |url = http://www.anl.gov/Media_Center/News/2003/030926mars.htm |title = APS X-rays reveal secrets of Mars' core | publisher = Argonne National Laboratory | date = 2003-09-26 | accessdate = 2009-06-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; originally generated a [[magnetic field]].  However the [[dynamo theory|dynamo]] ceased to function long ago,&lt;ref&gt;Schubert, Turcotte &amp;amp; Olson 2001, p. 692&lt;/ref&gt; and the magnetic field of Mars has largely disappeared, probably due to "...&amp;nbsp;loss of core heat, solidification of most of the core, and/or changes in the mantle convection regime."&lt;ref&gt;Carr 2007, p. 318&lt;/ref&gt; Results from the NASA [[MAVEN]] mission show that the atmosphere is removed primarily due to [[Coronal Mass Ejection]] events, where outbursts of high-velocity protons from the sun impact the atmosphere. Mars does still retain a limited [[magnetosphere]] that covers approximately 40% of its surface. Rather than uniformly covering and protecting the atmosphere from solar wind, however, the magnetic field takes the form of a collection of smaller, umbrella-shaped fields, mainly clustered together around the planet's southern hemisphere.&lt;ref name="SOLWIND"&gt;Solar Wind, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, between approximately 4.1 and 3.8 billion years ago, [[asteroid]] impacts during the [[Late Heavy Bombardment]] caused significant changes to the surface environment of objects in the Solar System. The low [[gravity]] of Mars suggests that these impacts could have ejected much of the Martian atmosphere into deep space.&lt;ref name="forgetmars80"&gt;Forget, Costard &amp;amp; Lognonné 2007, pp. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

Terraforming Mars would entail two major interlaced changes: building the atmosphere and heating it.&lt;ref&gt;Faure &amp;amp; Mensing 2007, p. 252.&lt;/ref&gt; A thicker atmosphere of greenhouse gases such as [[carbon dioxide]] would trap incoming [[solar radiation]]. Because the raised temperature would add greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, the two processes would augment each other.&lt;ref&gt;Zubrin, Robert M. &amp; McKay, Christopher P. (1997). [http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~mfogg/paper1.htm Technological Requirements for Terraforming Mars]. ''Journal of the British Interplanetary Society'', 50, 83. Accessed 2009-06-09.&lt;/ref&gt; Carbon dioxide alone would not suffice to sustain a temperature above the freezing point of water, so a mixture of specialized greenhouse molecules might be manufactured.&lt;ref&gt;Gerstell, Francisco, Yung, Boxe, &amp;amp; Aaltonee (2001) PNAS 98, pp. 2154-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:TerraformedVenus.jpg|thumb|right|210px|Artist's conception of a terraformed [[Venus]]]]

===Venus===
{{main|Terraforming of Venus}}

Terraforming [[Venus]] requires two major changes; removing most of the planet's dense 9&amp;nbsp;[[Pascal (unit)|MPa]] carbon dioxide atmosphere and reducing the planet's 450&amp;nbsp;°C (723.15&amp;nbsp;[[Kelvin|K]]) surface temperature.&lt;ref name="fogg1987"&gt;[[Martyn J. Fogg|Fogg, Martyn J.]] (1987). "The Terraforming of Venus," ''Journal of the British Interplanetary Society, 40'', pp. 551-564. ([http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1987JBIS...40..551F abstract]).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Landis2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Landis|first1=Geoffrey|title=Terraforming Venus: A Challenging Project for Future Colonization|year=2011|url= https://info.aiaa.org/tac/SMG/SCTC/Shared%20Documents/Terraforming-Venus_AIAA_Space2011.pdf|doi=10.2514/6.2011-7215}} Paper AIAA-2011-7215, AIAA Space 2011 Conference &amp; Exposition, Long Beach CA, Sept. 26–29, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; These goals are closely interrelated, because Venus's extreme temperature is thought to be due to the [[greenhouse effect]] caused by its dense atmosphere. Sequestering the atmospheric carbon would likely solve the temperature problem as well.

[[File:TerraformedMoonFromEarth.jpg|thumb|right|210px|Artist's conception of what the [[Moon]] might look like terraformed]]

===The Moon===

Although the gravity on Earth's [[moon]] is too low to hold an atmosphere for geological spans of time, if given an atmosphere, it would retain the atmosphere for spans of time that are long compared to human lifespans.&lt;ref name= "landis1990" /&gt; Landis&lt;ref name= "landis1990"&gt;Landis, Geoffrey (1990) "Air Pollution on the Moon," ''Analog'', June.&lt;/ref&gt; and others&lt;ref name= "benford2014"&gt;Benford, Greg (2014) [http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2014/07/terraforming_the_moon_it_would_be_a_lot_like_florida.html "How to Terraform the Moon"], ''Slate'', July 14. Retrieved 30 January 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Matt (2016) [http://www.universetoday.com/121140/could-we-terraform-the-moon/ "How Do We Terraform the Moon"], ''Universe Today,'' 31 March. Retrieved 30 January 2017&lt;/ref&gt; have thus proposed that it could be feasible to terraform the moon, although not all agree with that proposal.&lt;ref&gt;Dorminey, Bruce (2016) [https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucedorminey/2016/07/27/why-the-moon-should-never-be-terraformed "Why The Moon Should Never Be Terraformed"], ''Forbes,'' July 27. Retrieved 30 January 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Landis estimates that a 1 PSI atmosphere of pure oxygen on the moon would require on the order of two hundred trillion tons of oxygen, and suggests it could be produced by reducing the oxygen from an amount of lunar rock equivalent to a cube about fifty kilometers on an edge.  Alternatively, he suggests that the water content of "fifty to a hundred comets" the size of Halley's comet would do the job, "assuming that the water doesn't splash away when the comets hit the moon."&lt;ref name= "landis1990" /&gt; Likewise, Benford calculates that terraforming the moon would require "about 100 comets the size of Halley's."&lt;ref name= "benford2014" /&gt;

===Biological Terraforming===
{{See also|Interplanetary contamination}}

Many proposals for planetary engineering involve the use of genetically engineered bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hiscox|first1=JA|last2=Thomas|first2=DJ|title=Genetic modification and selection of microorganisms for growth on Mars.|journal=Journal of the British Interplanetary Society|date=October 1995|volume=48|issue=10|pages=419–26|pmid=11541203|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/David_Thomas36/publication/11805652_Genetic_modification_and_selection_of_microorganisms_for_growth_on_Mars/links/02e7e5214dccdab76b000000.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Mercury|journal=The Society|volume=29|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WkNBAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=10 January 2017|publisher=The Society|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[synthetic biology]] matures over the coming decades it may become possible to build designer organisms from scratch that directly manufacture desired products efficiently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Menezes|first1=A.

Gary King, microbiologist at [[Louisiana State University]] studying the most extreme organisms on Earth, notes that "synthetic biology has given us a remarkable toolkit that can be used to manufacture new kinds of organisms specially suited for the systems we want to plan for" and outlines the prospects for terraforming, saying "we'll want to investigate our chosen microbes, find the genes that code for the survival and terraforming properties that we want (like radiation and drought resistance), and then use that knowledge to genetically engineer specifically Martian-designed microbes". He sees the project's biggest bottleneck in the ability to genetically tweak and tailor the right microbes, estimating that this hurdle could take "a decade or more" to be solved&lt;!--grammar?--&gt;. He also notes that the it would be best to develop "not a single kind microbe but a suite of several that work together".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Here's How We'll Terraform Mars With Microbes|url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/space/moon-mars/a15410/terraform-mars-with-microbes/|publisher=''Popular Mechanics''|accessdate=10 January 2017|date=7 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[DARPA]] is researching using photosynthesizing plants, bacteria, and algae grown directly on the Mars surface that could warm up and thicken its atmosphere. In 2015 the agency and some of its research partners have created a software called [[DTA GView]] − a '[[Google Maps]] of [[genome]]s', in which genomes of several organisms can be pulled up on the program to immediately show a list of known genes and where they are located in the genome. According to Alicia Jackson, deputy director of [[Biological Technologies Office (DARPA)|DARPA's Biological Technologies Office]] by this they have developed a "technological toolkit to transform not just hostile places here on Earth, but to go into space not just to visit, but to stay".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Will tweaked microbes make Mars Earth-like? - Times of India|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/Will-tweaked-microbes-make-Mars-Earth-like/articleshow/47858464.cms|publisher=The Times of India|accessdate=10 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DARPA: We Are Engineering the Organisms That Will Terraform Mars|url=https://motherboard.vice.com/read/darpa-we-are-engineering-the-organisms-that-will-terraform-mars|publisher=Vice Motherboard|accessdate=10 January 2017|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Chris|title=We Definitely Want to Live on Mars – Here's How We Plan to Tame the Red Planet|url=https://bgr.com/2015/06/25/mars-darpa-terraforming-project/|publisher=BGR|accessdate=10 January 2017|date=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DARPA Wants To Use Genetically Engineered Organisms To Make Mars More Earth-Like|url=http://www.techtimes.com/articles/63927/20150627/darpa-wants-to-use-genetically-engineered-organisms-to-turn-make-mars-more-earth-like.htm|publisher=Tech Times|accessdate=10 January 2017|date=27 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paraterraforming===
Also known as the "worldhouse" concept, paraterraforming involves the construction of a habitable enclosure on a planet which encompasses most of the planet's usable area.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; The enclosure would consist of a transparent roof held one or more kilometers above the surface, pressurized with a breathable atmosphere, and anchored with tension towers and cables at regular intervals. The worldhouse concept is similar to the concept of a domed habitat, but one which covers all (or most) of the planet.

===Adapting humans===
It has also been suggested that instead of or in addition to terraforming a hostile environment humans might adapt to these places by the use of [[genetic engineering]], [[biotechnology]] and [[Cyborg|cybernetic enhancements]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gronstal|first1=A.|last2=Pérez|first2=J.E.A.|last3=Bittner|first3=T.|last4=Clacey|first4=E.|last5=Grubisic|first5=A.|last6=Rogers|first6=D.|title=Bioforming and terraforming: A balance of methods for feasible space colonization|date=1 January 2005|volume=2|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/289486325_Bioforming_and_terraforming_A_balance_of_methods_for_feasible_space_colonization|accessdate=10 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lunan|first1=Duncan|title=Man and the Planets: The Resources of the Solar System|publisher=Ashgrove Press|isbn=9780906798171|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=St8JAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=10 January 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spitzmiller|first1=Ted|title=Astronautics: A Historical Perspective of Mankind's Efforts to Conquer the Cosmos|publisher=Apogee Books|isbn=9781894959667|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kjVGAAAAYAAJ|accessdate=10 January 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Could We Marsiform Ourselves? - Universe Today|url=http://www.universetoday.com/132783/could-we-marsiform-ourselves/|publisher=Universe Today|accessdate=10 January 2017|date=10 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=motherboard1&gt;{{cite web|title=Be Your Own Spaceship: How We Can Adapt Human Bodies for Alien Worlds|url=https://motherboard.vice.com/blog/be-your-own-spaceship-how-we-can-adapt-human-bodies-for-alien-worlds|publisher=Vice Motherboard|accessdate=10 January 2017|language=en-us|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170113041207/https://motherboard.vice.com/blog/be-your-own-spaceship-how-we-can-adapt-human-bodies-for-alien-worlds|archivedate=13 January 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues==

===Ethical issues===
{{main|Ethics of terraforming}}

There is a philosophical debate within [[biology]] and [[ecology]] as to whether terraforming other worlds is an [[ethics|ethical]] endeavor. From the  point of view of a [[cosmocentric ethic]], this involves balancing the need for the preservation of human life against the intrinsic value of existing planetary ecologies.&lt;ref&gt;MacNiven 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

On the pro-terraforming side of the argument, there are those like [[Robert Zubrin]], [[Martyn J. Fogg]], Richard L. S. Taylor and the late [[Carl Sagan]] who believe that it is humanity's moral obligation to make other worlds suitable for [[life]], as a continuation of the history of life transforming the environments around it on Earth.&lt;ref name="zoob1"&gt;Robert Zubrin, ''[[The Case for Mars|The Case for Mars: The Plan to Settle the Red Planet and Why We Must]]'', pp. 248–249, Simon &amp; Schuster/Touchstone, 1996, {{ISBN|0-684-83550-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fogg 2000&lt;/ref&gt; They also point out that [[Future of the Earth|Earth would eventually be destroyed if nature takes its course]], so that humanity faces a very long-term choice between terraforming other worlds or allowing all terrestrial life to become [[extinction|extinct]]. Terraforming totally barren planets, it is asserted, is not morally wrong as it does not affect any other life.

The opposing argument posits that terraforming would be an unethical interference in [[nature]], and that given humanity's past treatment of Earth, other planets may be better off without human interference. Still others strike a middle ground, such as [[Christopher McKay]], who argues that terraforming is ethically sound only once we have completely assured that an alien planet does not harbor life of its own; but that if it does, we should not try to reshape it to our own use, but we should engineer its environment to artificially nurture the [[Extraterrestrial life|alien life]] and help it thrive and co-evolve, or even co-exist with humans.&lt;ref name="ontomars"&gt;Christopher McKay and Robert Zubrin, "Do Indigenous Martian Bacteria have Precedence over Human Exploration?", pp. 177–182, in ''On to Mars: Colonizing a New World'', Apogee Books Space Series, 2002, {{ISBN|1-896522-90-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even this would be seen as a type of terraforming to the strictest of ecocentrists, who would say that all life has the right, in its home biosphere, to evolve without outside interference.

===Economic issues===
The initial cost of such projects as planetary terraforming would be gargantuan, and the infrastructure of such an enterprise would have to be built from scratch. Such [[technology]] is not yet developed, let alone financially feasible at the moment. John Hickman has pointed out that almost none of the current schemes for terraforming incorporate [[economy|economic strategies]], and most of their models and expectations seem highly optimistic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.jetpress.org/volume4/space.htm| title=The Political Economy of Very Large Space Projects| accessdate=2006-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political issues===
{{further|Outer Space Treaty}}
National pride, rivalries between nations, and the politics of [[public relations]] have in the past been the primary motivations for shaping space projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000080&amp;sid=a5elzidanocM&amp;refer=asia| title=China's Moon Quest Has U.S. Lawmakers Seeking New Space Race| accessdate=2006-04-28 | work=Bloomberg| date=2006-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thompson 2001 p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; It is reasonable to assume that these factors would also be present in planetary terraforming efforts.

==In popular culture==
{{main|Terraforming in popular culture}}
Terraforming is a common concept in [[science fiction]], ranging from [[science fiction television|television]], [[science fiction film|movies]] and [[science fiction novels|novels]] to [[video games]].

[[Implicit stereotype|Unconscious (or implicit) biases]] are learned stereotypes that are automatic, unintentional, deeply engrained, universal, and able to influence behavior.&lt;ref name="Noon"&gt;Noon, M. (2018). Pointless diversity training: Unconscious bias, new racism and agency. ''Work, Employment and Society, 32'', 198–209. {{doi|10.1177/0950017017719841}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Unconscious bias training''' programs are designed to expose people to their unconscious biases, provide tools to adjust automatic patterns of thinking, and ultimately eliminate discriminatory behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;Fiarman, S. E. (2016). ''Unconscious bias: When good intentions aren't enough''. ''Educational Leadership, 74(3)'', 10–15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 
A critical component of unconscious bias training is creating awareness for implicit bias. Since 1998, the online [[Implicit-association test|Implicit-Association Test]] (IAT) has provided a platform for the general public to assess their unconscious biases.

== Training techniques ==

There are a wide variety of unconscious bias training programs, but the programs tend to follow a basic three-step method. 1. Participants take a pretest to assess baseline implicit bias levels (typically with the IAT); 2. They complete the unconscious bias training task; and 3. They take a posttest to re-evaluate  bias levels after training. Frequently follow-up tests of unconscious bias are administered days, weeks, or months after the completion of training programs to examine the long-term benefits of these programs.&lt;ref name="Devine 2012"&gt;Devine, P.

=== Counterstereotype ===
According to a metanalysis of 17 unconscious bias interventions, counterstereotype training is the most effective way to reduce unconscious bias.&lt;ref name="Lai"&gt;Lai, C. (2014). "Reducing implicit racial references: I. A comparative investigation of 17 interventions". ''Journal of experimental psychology'', 143(4), 1765–1785. {{doi|10.1037/a0036260}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the area of gender bias, techniques such as imagining powerful women, hearing their stories, and writing essays about them has been shown to reduce levels of unconscious gender bias on the IAT.&lt;ref name="Blair"&gt;Blair, I. V., Ma, J. E., &amp; Lenton, A. P. (2001). "Imagining stereotypes away: The moderation of implicit stereotypes through mental imagery". ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology'', 81(5), 828–841. {{doi|10.1037//0022-3514.81.5.828}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dasgupta and Asagari (2004) found that real life counterstereotypes, such as going to a women’s college or having female professors, have the ability to decrease bias because the idea that women are intelligent and hard-working is repeatedly reinforced.&lt;ref name= "Dasgupta"&gt;Dasgupta, N., &amp; Asgari, S. (2004). "Seeing is believing: Exposure to counterstereotypic women leaders and its effect on the malleability of automatic gender stereotyping." ''Journal of Experimental Social Psychology'', 40, 642–658. {{doi|10.1016/j.jesp.2004.02.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of racial bias, several studies have replicated the finding that training participants to pair counterstereotypical traits such as “successful” with images of black individuals is an effective tool for reducing implicit racial bias.&lt;ref name= "Woodcock"&gt;Woodcock, A., &amp; Monteith, M. J. (2013). "Forging links with the self to combat implicit bias". ''Group Processes &amp; Intergroup Relations'', 16(4), 445–461. {{doi|10.1177/1368430212459776}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hu"&gt;Hu, X., Antony, J. W., Creery, J. D., Varags, I. M., Bodenhausen, G. V., &amp; Paller, K. A. (2015). Unlearning implicit social biases during sleep. ''Science, 348'', 1013–1015. {{doi|10.1126/science.aaa3841}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Burns" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Johnson"&gt;Johnson, I. R., Kopp, B. M., Petty, R. E. (2018). "Just say no! (and mean it): Meaningful negation as a tool to modify automatic racial attitudes". ''Group Processes &amp; Intergroup Relations'', 21(1), 88–110.{{doi|10.17117/1368430216647189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kawakami, Dovido, and van Kamp (2005) challenged the effectiveness of counterstereotype training when they found that participants actually showed an increase in gender bias after training. Rather than using the IAT to assess levels of unconscious bias, the researchers asked participants to read a resume and decide if the applicant was qualified for a leadership job because, "when ambiguity exists in an individual's qualifications or competence, evaluators will fill the void with assumptions drawn from gender stereotypes".&lt;ref name= "Isaac"&gt;Isaac, C., Lee, B., &amp; Carnes, M. (2009). "Interventions that affect gender bias in hiring: A systematic review". ''Aca Med'', 84(10), 1440-1446. {{doi|10.1097/ACM.0b013e3181b6ba00}}&lt;/ref&gt; The participants received one of four resumes describing equally qualified candidates. The only difference between the four resumes was the name of the applicant—two had female names and two had male names. When participants were administered the job application task immediately following counterstereotype training, they were more likely to pick the male candidates over the female candidates, which made it appear as though the counterstereotype training was ineffective. However, when the researchers added a distractor task between the counterstereotype training and the job application task, participants selected male and female candidates at an equal rate. When participants had to engage in a cognitive task while simultaneously selecting a candidate, they were more likely to select the female applicants.&lt;ref name= "Kawakami 2005"&gt;Kawakami, K., Dovido, J. F., &amp; van Kamp, S. (2005). "Kicking the habit: Effects of nonstereotypic association training and correction processes on hiring decisions". ''Journal of Experimental Social Psychology'', 41, 68–75. {{doi|10.1016/j.jesp.2004.05.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The researchers did a follow up study with a slightly different procedure to determine why bias was increased in some conditions and decreased in others. They followed the same counterstereotype training procedure, but divided the job application task into two distinct parts. Participants were either asked to first pick the best candidate for the job and then rank each candidate on sixteen traits (half were female stereotypes and the other half were male stereotypes) or they were asked to complete the tasks in the opposite order. Regardless of the order, participants consistently were biased against women in the first task, but not in the second task. The researchers hypothesized that the participants were able to discern that the purpose of the study was to reduce gender bias, so they showed an increase bias in the first task to compensate for the researcher’s attempt to influence their behaviors.&lt;ref name= "Kawakami 2007"&gt;Kawakami, K., Dovido, J. F., &amp; van Kamp, S. (2007). "The impact of counterstereotypic training and related correction processes on the application of stereotypes". ''Group Processes &amp; Intergroup Relations'', 10(2), 139–156. {{doi|10.1177/1368430207074725}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further research is necessary to determine why participants showed decreased bias on the second task and if the decreased has an enduring effect.

Hu and colleagues (2015) created a form of counterstereotype training to unlearn implicit bias while sleeping.&lt;ref name="Hu" /&gt; Participants completed the typical counterstereotype training task of pairing images of people with different genders and races with counterstereotypical traits. However, their study differed from previous research because two unique sounds played after each successful pairing of either a gender or race counterstereotype. After the training task, participants were asked to take a 90-minute nap, and their sleep patterns were monitored with [[Electroencephalography|EEG]]. Once participants entered into [[slow-wave sleep]], the researchers played either the sound that followed correct gender counterstereotypes or racial counterstereotypes in the training task. After follow up assessments, the results showed that bias was successfully reduced depending on the sound played during sleep, meaning the people that listened to the sound associated with gender counterstereotypes showed reduced gender bias, but not racial bias, and vice versa. The specific reduced bias remained when the participants returned to the lab a week after initial training and testing.&lt;ref name="Hu" /&gt;

=== Negation ===
Negation training decreases implicit bias through actively rejecting information that reinforces stereotypes, therefore breaking the habit of stereotyping.&lt;ref name="Johnson" /&gt; Kawakami, Dovido, Moll, Hermsen, and Russin (2000) conducted one of the first studies to test the effects of negation training on reducing unconscious bias. In their study, participants were presented with pictures of black and white individuals along with a word that represented a stereotype. The participants were instructed to press "NO" during stereotype-consistent trials (for example, a black person and the word "lazy"), and "YES" during stereotype-inconsistent trials (a black person paired with "successful"). Participants showed significant decreases in automatic bias from the pretest to posttest.&lt;ref name= "Kawakami 2000"&gt;Kawakami, K., Dovido, J. F., Moll, J., Hermsen, S., &amp; Russin, A. (2000). "Just say no (to stereotyping): Effects of training in the negation of stereotypic associations on stereotype activation". ''Journal of Personality and Psychology'', 78(5), 871–888. {{doi|10.1037//O022-3514.78.5.871}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Gawronski, Deutsch, Mbirkou, Seibt, and Strack(2006) hypothesized that negation training was not only ineffective, but could actually strengthen unconscious biases. They stated that Kawakami and colleagues only produced positive results because when the participants responded, "YES" to stereotype-inconsistent word-picture pairings, they were using counterstereotyping rather than negation. To test these claims, the researchers created separate counterstereotype and negation conditions. The counterstereotype condition was instructed to press "YES" for stereotype-inconsistent information, while the negation condition was told to press "NO" for stereotype-consistent information. The results showed that the counterstereotype condition decreased implicit bias, but the negation condition increased bias. A possible explanation for the increase in bias with negation training is the level of control required during memory retrieval. During negation training, the memory of a previously held stereotype is activated and then you have to purposefully reject the meaning of the memory. The participants were repeatedly activating the memory of the stereotype, which made it stronger, and they were not able to replace the stereotype with a positive counterstereotype. Alternatively, in counterstereotyping, you do not have to exhibit control to reject a memory because a new and separate memory for stereotype-inconsistent information is formed.&lt;ref name= "Gawronski"&gt;Gawronski, B., Deutsch, R., Mbirkou, S., Seibt, B., Strack, F. (2008). "When 'Just Say No' is not enough: Affirmation versus negation training and the reduction of automatic stereotype activation". ''Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 44'', 270–377. {{doi|10.1016/j.jesp.2006.12.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 
Recently, Johnson, Kopp, and Petty (2018) attempted to reconcile the discrepant results of the previous research. They argued the negation was not meaningful and participants were not adequately motivated to get rid of their unconscious biases. The researchers introduced a condition in which participants were told to think, "That's wrong!" in response to stereotype-consistent information. Other participants were told, instead, to continue to use the typical form of negation and simply responded "No" to stereotype-consistent information. The researchers hypothesized that "No" is an ambiguous and weak response to stereotypes, but "That's wrong!" is a specific and morally tied response that is hard to ignore. When participants were told to think, "that's wrong!" in response stereotype-consistent information, there was a decrease in unconscious bias that was not observed in the condition that simply thought "no". Additionally, the researchers discovered that motivation plays a role in the effectiveness of unconscious bias training programs. After the negation training tasks, participants took the Motivation to Control for Prejudiced Reactions Scale (MCPR) to measure the participants' drive to change their unconscious biases. People who scored particularly high on the MCPR showed a reduction in bias regardless of the condition. Therefore, if people feel determined to reduce their unconscious biases and think "that's wrong" rather than "no", negation training shows promising results for decreasing implicit racial bias.&lt;ref name="Johnson" /&gt;

=== Perspective-taking ===
Perspective-taking creates a sense of empathy for a stereotyped group, which has been shown to improve attitudes towards individuals as well as their group as a whole.&lt;ref name="Shih"&gt;Shih, M. J., Wang, E., Bucher, A. T., &amp; Stotzer, R. (2009). "Perspective taking: Reducing prejudice towards general outgroups and specific individuals". ''Group Processing &amp; Intergroup Relations'', 12(5), 565–577. {{doi|10.1177/1368430209337463}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, perspective-taking studies follow a three-step procedure. First, participants are exposed to the target minority group through watching a video that displays examples of racial discrimination or through viewing a photograph of an individual from the target minority group. Then participants are told to reflect on that person’s life and their emotions or imagine themselves as the main character. A separate control group watches the same movie or views the same photograph, but they are not given any additional instructions involving perspective-taking. Lastly, participants’ biases are reassessed through answering questionnaires, retaking IAT, or engaging in specific tasks. This prototypical form of perspective-taking has been shown to effectively reduce racial bias.&lt;ref name="Dovido"&gt;Dovido, J. F., ten Vergert, M., Steward, T. L., Gaertner, S. L., Johnson, J. D., Esses, V. M., Riek, B. M., Pearson, A. R. (2004). Perspective and prejudice: Antecedents and mediating mechanisms. ''Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin'', 30(12), 1537–1549. {{doi|10.1177/0146167204271177}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Todd"&gt;Todd, A. R., Bodenhausen, G. V., Richeson, J. A., &amp; Galinksy, A. D. (2011). "Perspective taking combats automatic expressions of racial bias". ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology'', 100(6), 1027–1042.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dovidio and colleagues (2004) found that a diverse group of strangers can come together as a unified group if they believe they share a common threat. Stimulating a perceived common threat can reduce bias, because people are less likely to be biased against members of their own group.&lt;ref name="Dovido" /&gt; Todd, Bodenhausen, Richenson, and Galinksy (2011) showed participants an image of a black man, had them write an essay about a day in his life, and then watched the participants interact with a black researcher. The face-to-face interactions were more successful and natural with the participants in the perspective-taking condition compared to the control group.&lt;ref name="Todd" /&gt;

Another example of perspective-taking was tested by Shih, Stotzer, and Guitérrez (2009). They had participants watch a clip of a movie that showed an Asian American being discriminated against and were told to read a college admissions folder and decide if the student should be admitted. The admission profiles were exactly the same, except one version checked White for ethnicity while the other checked Asian American. The participants in the perspective-taking condition demonstrated greater empathy towards the Asian profile and were more likely to accept him than the control condition.&lt;ref name="Shih" /&gt; In 2013, they conducted an additional study in which they added a task where they flashed the pronouns "us" or "them" before showing an adjective with a good or bad connotation. They found that participants that were in the control group quickly associated good adjectives with "us" and bad adjective with "them", while the perspective-taking group did not show a significant time difference between the two categories. The researchers concluded that empathy and perspective taking could reduce prejudice towards discriminated groups.&lt;ref name= "Shih 2013"&gt;Shih, M. J., Stotzer, R., &amp; Guitérrez, A. S. (2013). "Perspective-taking and empathy: Generalizing the reduction of group bias towards Asian Americans to general outgroups". ''Journal of Abnormal Psychology'', 4(2), 79–83. {{doi|10.1037/a0029790}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 
Kaatz and colleagues (2017) had participants play a video game where they are the character Jamal, a black graduate student working towards a degree in science. Throughout the game, players had to complete tasks such as selecting an advisor, attending conferences, and publishing papers. During each task, the players experienced hardships due to racial discrimination and learn about implicit bias. In order to successfully complete the game, players had to be able to learn how to recognize, label, and talk about bias. After completing the game, participants filled out surveys about their experiences. Most participants agreed that it was an effective strategy for reducing unconscious bias.&lt;ref name= "Kaatz"&gt;Kaatz, A., Carner, M., Gutierrez, B., Savoy, J., Samuel, C., Filut, A., &amp; Pribbenow, C. M. (2017). "Fair play: A study of scientific workforce trainers' experience playing an educational video game about racial bias". ''CBE- Life Sciences Education'', 16(7), 1–18. {{doi|10.1187/cbe.15-06-0140}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further research is necessary to objectively measure the effectiveness of the game.

=== Meditation ===
Meditation has become integrated into a variety of Western therapeutic practices due to its benefits of enhanced well-being, reduced depression and anxiety, and overall mood improvement.&lt;ref name="Stell"&gt;Stell, A. J., &amp; Farsides, T. (2016). "Brief loving-kindness meditation reduces racial bias, mediated by positive other-regarding emotions". ''Motivation and Emotion'', 40(1), 140–147. {{doi|10.1007/s11031-015-9514-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, meditation was incorporated into unconscious bias training using [[Mettā|Lovingkindness meditation]] (LKM), which "aims to self-regulate an affective state of unconditional kindness towards the self and others".&lt;ref name="Stell" /&gt; Meditation studies follow the format of a pretest IAT, participation in a LKM program, and a posttest IAT. Hutcherson, Seppala, and Gross (2008) showed that a few minutes of LMK could create a sense of empathy and compassion for a neutral target, which inspired the idea to use meditation as an unconscious bias training technique.&lt;ref name= "Hutcherson"&gt;Hutcherson, C. A., Seppala, E. M., &amp; Gross, J. J. (2008). "Loving-kindness meditation increases social connectedness". ''Emotion'', 8(5), 720–724. {{doi|10.1037/a0013237}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stell and Farsides (2016) found that after only seven minutes of LMK, unconscious racial bias for a targeted group was reduced.&lt;ref name="Stell" /&gt; Kang, Gray, and Dovido (2014) found that participants who attend a seven-week meditation course showed a significant decrease unconscious bias towards African Americans and homeless people. Notably, participants who participated in a discussion based on the Lovingkindness philosophy for seven weeks but did not practice meditation did not show a reduction in bias after the seven weeks.&lt;ref name= "Kang"&gt;Kang, Y., Gray, J. R., Dovido, J. F. (2014). "The nondiscriminating heart: Lovingkindness meditation training decreases implicit intergroup bias". ''Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 143(3)'', 1306–1313. {{doi|10.1037/a0034150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Implicit bias workshops ===
{{essay-like|section|date=September 2018}}
{{citation-style|section|date=September 2018}}
Implicit bias workshops typically use a combination of strategies to reduce unconscious bias. Devine, Forscher, Austin, and Cox (2012) created a workshop that uses five different techniques to combat bias; stereotype replacement, counterstereotype training, individualism, perspective taking, and increased opportunities for contact with minority races. In stereotype replacement, participants try to recognize their stereotypes, reflect on why they have those stereotypes, consider how they could avoid those stereotypes in the future, and come up with an unbiased response to replace their stereotypes. The counterstereotype training involves picturing examples of counterstereotypes. For example, if the counterstereotype is intelligence, participants are asked to picture an intelligent black individual such as President Obama or a family friend. During the individualism portion of the workshop, participants receive specific information about members of a stereotyped group so they can remember each person as an individual rather than seeing the group as a singular unit. Perspective-taking involves imagining yourself as a member of a stereotyped group. Lastly, participants are provided with opportunities to have positive interactions with members of minority groups. Studies show that four and eight weeks after completing the workshop, and unconscious bias (as measured by the IAT) was reduced.&lt;ref name="Devine 2012" /&gt; Moss-Racusin and colleagues (2016) created a 120-minute workshop called "Scientific Diversity" that was aimed at reducing gender bias. During the workshop, instructors present empirical evidence on implicit bias, encourage active group discussion, and help participants practice techniques for creating an accepting environment. To assess bias, participants took pretest and posttest questionnaires. The posttest questionnaires revealed that participants experienced increased diversity awareness and decreased subtle gender bias.&lt;ref name= "Moss"&gt;Moss-Racusin, C. A., van der Toorn, J., Dovidio, J. F., Brescoll, V. L., Graham, M. J., &amp; Handelsman, J. (2016). "A 'scientific diversity' intervention to reduce gender bias in a sample of life scientists". ''CBE-Life Sciences Education'', 15, 1–11. {{doi|10.1187/cbe.15-09-0187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Gonzales, Kim, and Marantz (2014), the recognition of bias cannot be taught in a single session, so researchers have created workshops or class curriculums that span days, semesters, or even years.&lt;ref&gt;Gonzales, C. M., Kim, M. Y., &amp; Marantz, P. R. (2014). "Implicit bias and its relation to health disparities: A teaching program and survey of medical students". ''Teaching and learning in medicine'', 26(1), 64–71. {{doi|10.1080/10401334.2013.857341}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hannah and Carpenter-Song (2013) created a semester-long course that focuses on [[introspection]]. Students are encouraged to look within themselves to examine their own bias, values, and most importantly, blind spots. During each class, students discuss articles about various forms of bias and participate in interactive exercises that are designed to promote perspective-taking and empathy. Tests of the course showed that students who have an active interest in learning about issues of implicit bias were able to successfully reduce their levels of bias. However, a subset of the students did not reduce bias or even showed an increased bias after the course because the program was mandatory and they were not incentivized to change their thoughts and behaviors.&lt;ref name="Hannah" /&gt;

Van Ryn and colleagues (2015) started a course for medical school students that studies disparities in minority health care. The researchers were able to implement various forms of the class in forty-nine medical schools and collected data from 3,547 students. During class, students read articles about unconscious bias, hold group discussions, and gain experience with interacting with racial minorities. Participants took the IAT during their first and last semesters of medical school to assess the effectiveness of the program. Though most reductions in implicit bias were small, the reductions were significant and affected behaviors. Students reported feeling more comfortable when working with minorities and kept in mind implicit biases when treating minorities.&lt;ref name="Van Ryan" /&gt;

Stone, Moskowitz, and Zestcott (2015) conducted a workshop for medical students that used self-reflection techniques to motivate health care providers to address their implicit biases. First, participants took an IAT (but did not receive feedback) and read an article about implicit bias in medicine. A week later, the participants attended a lecture about implicit bias and had a classroom demonstration of an IAT. Two days later, participants discussed strategies for reducing bias, seeking common-identities, and taking the perspective of patients in small groups. When participants retook the IAT three to seven days after the workshop, there was a significant decrease in implicit bias.&lt;ref name= "Zestcott"&gt;Zestcott, C. A., Blair, I. V., Stone, J. (2016). "Examining the presence, consequences, and reduction of implicit bias in health care: A narrative review".

'''William Barclay Squire''' (16 October 1855 – 13 January 1927) was a British musicologist, librarian and librettist.&lt;ref&gt;http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100526612&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
William Barclay Squire was a devoted music enthusiast. He spent 35 years of his life (1885-1920) working for the [[British Museum]], where he took charge of the collections of the music department and added many antiquarian publications to it. Squire prepared the publishing of the ''Catalogue of Printed Music before 1801'' (edited in 1912) and negotiated the deposit of the Royal Music Collection, for which he prepared the catalogue.
