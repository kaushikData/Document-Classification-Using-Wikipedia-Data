Argyre is centered at {{Coord|49.7|S|316.0|E|globe:Mars}} and lies between 35° and 61° S and 27° and 62° W in the [[Argyre quadrangle]]. The basin is approximately {{convert|1800|km|mi|abbr=on}} wide and drops {{convert|5.2|km|ft|abbr=on}} below the surrounding plains; it is the second deepest impact basin on Mars after [[Hellas Planitia|Hellas]]. The crater [[Galle (Martian crater)|Galle]], located on the east rim of Argyre at {{Coord|51|S|31|W|globe:Mars}}, strongly resembles a [[smiley]] face.

The basin was possibly formed by a giant impact during the [[Late Heavy Bombardment]] of the early [[Solar System]], approximately 3.9 billion years ago, and may be one of the best preserved ancient impact basins from that period. Argyre is surrounded by rugged [[massif]]s which form concentric and radial patterns around the basin. Several mountain ranges are present, including [[Charitum Montes|Charitum]] and [[Nereidum Montes]].&lt;ref name="planetary.brown.edu"&gt;'[http://www.planetary.brown.edu/pdfs/2563.pdf Topography and morphology of the Argyre Basin, Mars].' Hiesinger &amp; Head.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Past water flows==
Four large [[Noachian epoch]] channels lie radial to the basin. Three of these channels ([[Surius Valles]], [[Dzígai Valles]], and [[Palacopas Valles]]) flowed into Argyre from the south and east through the rim mountains. The fourth, [[Uzboi Vallis]], appears to have flowed out from the basin's north rim to the [[Chryse Planitia|Chryse]] region and may have drained a [[lake]] of melting ice within the basin. A smaller outflow channel named [[Nia Valles]] is relatively fresh-looking, and probably formed during the early [[Amazonian epoch|Amazonian]] after the major fluvial and lacustrine episodes had finished.&lt;ref&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-data_query?bibcode=2000LPI....31.2033P&amp;link_type=ARTICLE&amp;db_key=AST&amp;high=  Argyre Planitia and the Mars Global Hydrologic Cycle]'. Parker et al.&lt;/ref&gt;

The original basin floor is buried with friable, partially deflated layered material that may be lake [[sediment]]. No inner rings are visible; however, isolated massifs within the basin may be remnants of an inner ring.&lt;ref name="planetary.brown.edu"/&gt;

==Past habitability==
The impact that formed the Argyre basin probably struck an ice cap or a thick [[permafrost]] layer.  Energy from the impact melted the ice and formed a giant lake that eventually sent water to the North.  The lakes's volume was equal to that of Earth's Mediterranean Sea.  The deepest part of the lake may have taken more than a hundred thousand years to freeze, but with the help of heat from the impact, geothermal heating, and dissolved solutes it may have had liquid water for many millions of years. The basin would have supported a regional environment favorable for the origin and the persistence of [[Life on Mars|life]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Argyre Region as a Prime Target for in situ Astrobiological Exploration of Mars |journal=Astrobiology |date=February 2016 |author=Fairén Alberto G. |author2=Dohm James M. |author3=Rodríguez J.

Based on morphometrical and geomorphological analysis of the Argyre eskers and their immediate surroundings, it was suggested that they formed beneath an approximately 2&amp;nbsp;km thick, stagnant (i.e., stationary) ice sheet around 3.6 billion years ago. This stagnant body of ice might have resembled a [[Glacier morphology#Piedmont glaciers|Piedmont-style glacier]] comparable to today's [[Malaspina Glacier]] in [[Alaska]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bernhardt | first1 = H. | last2 = Hiesinger | first2 = H. | last3 = Reiss | first3 = D. | last4 = Ivanov | first4 = M.

'''Camp de Tarragona''' ({{IPA-ca|ˈkam də tərəˈɣonə}}) is a [[Natural region|natural]] and historical region of [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. It includes a central plain, surrounded by the [[Serralada Prelitoral]] mountain chain on the west and in the north, with the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] sand beaches of the [[Costa Daurada]] on the east and limited in the south by the [[Coll de Balaguer]]. The main towns are [[Tarragona]], [[Reus]], [[Valls]] and [[Cambrils]]. [[Salou]] is an important [[resort town|resort destination]]. 

The region is regarded as the second metropolitan area of Catalonia, hosting the most important chemical complex in Spain as well as one of the main ports. Among the most distinctive agricultural produce of the region are [[hazelnut]]s, [[olive]]s, [[wine]] and [[fish]]. It is also one of the major [[tourism|tourist]] areas in Catalonia, mainly due to the variety of beaches, [[tourist attraction|holiday attractions]] like the remains of the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] important past of Tarragona (one of the [[UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Spain]]), samples of the Catalan [[Modernisme]] style (particularly in Reus, [[Gaudí]]'s hometown) and [[PortAventura World]] ([[PortAventura Park]], the most visited theme park in Spain&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = [[Themed Entertainment Association]] |author2=Economics Research Associates | title = Global Attractions Attendance Report | publisher = AECOM | year = 2013 | url = http://www.aecom.com/deployedfiles/Internet/Capabilities/Economics/_documents/ThemeMuseumIndex_2013.pdf| accessdate =4 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Ferrari Land]] and also the [[PortAventura Caribe Aquatic Park]]).

The area has a common history going back to 1356. In 1936, the region was politically divided into three [[Comarques of Catalonia|comarques]]: [[Alt Camp]], [[Baix Camp]] and [[Tarragonès]].

According to the General Territorial Plan of Catalonia, the Camp de Tarragona region is one of the seven functional territorial sections of Catalonia. It covers, however, a greater area, as the neighbouring comarques of [[Baix Penedès]], [[Priorat]] and [[Conca de Barberà]] are also included. Under the 2006 [[Estatut|Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia]], the four [[Provinces of Spain|provinces]] which make up Catalonia are due to be replaced by seven [[vegueria|vegueries]], which will also take over many of the functions of the comarques. While the final boundaries of the new vegueries have yet to be approved, the vegueria of Camp de Tarragona will most likely be formed by the same six comarques above mentioned, with the only possible exception of Baix Penedès if the historical region of the [[Penedès]] was finally accepted as an eighth vegueria, as requested by many local councils.

==Veguerie==
{{main|Vegueria}}
The Veguerie ([[Vegueria]] in [[Catalan language|Catalan]]) was an important [[feudalism|feudal]] land division in the [[Principality of Catalonia]], [[Kingdom of Sardinia]], and [[Duchy of Athens]] during the [[Middle Ages]] and into the [[Modern Era]] until the [[Nueva Planta decrees]] of 1716. It was the primary division of a [[county]] in Catalonia and the basic territorial unit of government in Sardinia and Athens after those countries became part of the [[Crown of Aragon]]. The office of a veguer was called a '''vigeriate''' (Latin: ''vigeriatus''). 

In 1936, Catalonia was reconstituted into [[Comarques of Catalonia|''comarques'']]. Although these were quickly abolished in 1939 they were reconstituted again in 1987. Each ''comarca'' was grouped with two to four others into a veguerie, of which there were nine, with their capitals at [[Barcelona]], [[Girona]], [[Tremp]], [[Vic]], [[Manresa]], [[Lleida]], [[Reus]], [[Tarragona]], and [[Tortosa]]. 

Since the 1987 reconstitution it has been decided that Vegueries be formally re-established in 2011. Under the 2006 [[Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia]], the four [[Provinces of Spain|provinces]] which make up Catalonia are due to be replaced by seven vegueries, which will also take over many of the functions of the ''comarques''. As of October 2008, whereas the final boundaries of the new vegueries have yet to be formally approved, they are expected to incorporate largely historical boundaries: [[Àmbit metropolità de Barcelona]], [[Alt Pirineu i Aran]], Camp de Tarragona, [[Comarques Centrals]], [[Comarques Gironines]], [[Ponent]] or Lleida, [[Terres de l'Ebre]].

'''Denis Retaillé''' (born 1953, Mayenne, [[France]]) is a Professor of Geography at the University of Bordeaux III and the Director of the CNRS ADES Research Unit, UMR 5186. Professor Retaillé holds a PhD in Geography from the University of Rouen (1983) dedicated to the study of the Nigerien région of Koutous, and an Habilitation from the [[Paris-Sorbonne University]] (Paris IV) (1993) dedicated to the study of space in the [[Sahel]]. From 1993 to 2008, Denis Retaillé was a Professor of Geography at the University of Rouen, France.

Drawing on the work made by French geographer Jean Gallais in the Inner Niger Delta in [[Mali]], Denis Retaillé has contributed to the understanding of space, in particular in the [[Sahara]] and in the [[Sahel]] &lt;ref&gt;Retaillé (1993), (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; and also in India. Building on his African fieldworks, he developed the idea of a ''nomadic space'' &lt;ref&gt;Retaillé (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; and of a ''mobile space''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pacte.cnrs.fr/IMG/pdf_Retaill_.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, Denis Retaillé is interested in explaining the diversity of cultural representations in the globalised world. His work has contributed to the development of the epistemology of geography and is inspired by a comparative approach, as evidenced by his contribution in ''Le monde, espaces et systèmes'', published with Marie-Françoise Durand and Jacques Lévy in 1993, and in ''Le monde du géographe'', published in 1997.

Professor Retaillé is an Editor in Chief of ''L’Information géographique'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.armand-colin.com/revue/6/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-09-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090830025406/http://www.armand-colin.com/revue/6/ |archivedate=2009-08-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; a French journal.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5648">'''Edward  Augustus  Ackerman'''  ([[Idaho]] 1911- [[Washington D. C.|Washington]] 1973) was a noted American [[geographer]] and an authority in the management of hydric resources in US. He was member of several committees and advisory groups on management of [[natural resources]], [[population growth]],  the [[Natural environment|environment]] and conservation. Through his career he placed emphasis on the need of a [[sustainable development|sustainable management]] of the natural resources.
A key element of Ackerman thinking is the concept of [[system]] and the interactions between the people and the [[nature]]. According to Ackerman  "the objective of Geography is to understand the great system that encompasses the humanity and its environment on Earth's surface".&lt;ref&gt;White, G. F. (1974), Edward A. Ackerman, 1911–1973. Annals of the Association of American Geographers, 64: 297–309. doi: 10.1111/j.1467-8306.1974.tb00979.x&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OBITUARIO&gt;Obituary: Edward A. Ackerman (1911-1973), Donald J. Patton, Geographical Review Vol. 64, No. 1 (Jan., 1974), pp. 150-153, Published by: American Geographical Society&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Ackerman was born in [[Ohio]] and was an orphan. He attended Coeur D’Alene Highschool, in 1930 he was awarded a scholarship to study at [[Harvard University]]. During his first term at Harvard his talent was noted by Derwent Whittlesey then the professor of Humane Geography in the Geology and Geography Department at Harvard. Whittlesey became his professor, mentor and promoter, and supervised Ackerman PhD. thesis which he completed in 1939. Upon graduating Ackerman was teacher at Harvard during the period 1940 - 1948.&lt;ref name=OBITUARIO/&gt;

During the Second World War, Ackerman was contracted by the ''Coordinator Of Information'' (COI), a dependency that would be the origin of the  [[Office of Strategic Services]] (OSS) (that latter would be the origin of the [[CIA]]).&lt;ref name=OSS&gt;Reconstructing Conflict: Integrating War and Post-war Geographies -  S. Kirsch  C. Flint, Chapter 11 Mapping Intelligence, American Geographers and the Office of Strategic Services and GHQ/SCAP (Tokyo), Trevor Barnes and Jeremy Crampton. Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2011.330 pages. {{ISBN|9781409404705}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From this post he collaborated with the military effort, initially working in the ''Geographic Report Section'' of the Geography Division. Ackerman was responsible for planning and managing the drafting of documents that provided intelligence information on the different geographic areas where the war was taking place, including the assessment of beaches for disembarkments, and even the level of empathy and political and social preferences of the people living in the places where the US Army would be moving through.  In 1942 ha was appointed Manager of OSS Topographic Intelligence subdivision of the Europe-African Division. The Geographic Reports he helped to produce, were latter the base of what would be the Joint Army Navy Intelligence Surveys (JANIS) and latter would become the source material for the [[CIA World Factbook]].&lt;ref name=OSS/&gt;

After Japan was occupied by US in September 1945, Ackerman was commissioned to develop the policies for the development and management of Japan resources; he work on this assignment between 1946 - 1948 as member of the Natural Resources Section (NRS). Among the tasks undertaken by the NRS was the redistribution of the agricultural land, given that up to late 1945 Japan's agriculture system was essential a feudal one, with the poor peasants paying a fee for the land they laboured. A third of the agricultural land changed hands as a result of the implementation of the redistribution policy.&lt;ref name=OSS/&gt;

In the period 1952 - 1954 he was vice general director of the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]], being the director of the programme "Hydric Resources for the Future" (1954 - 1958). From 1958 and until his death he was director of the [[Carnegie Institution for Science|Carnegie Institute]].

'''''Géographe''''' was a 20-gun [[Serpente class corvette|''Serpente'' class]] [[corvette]] of the [[French Navy]]. She was named ''Uranie'' in 1797, and renamed ''Galatée'' in 1799, still on her building site. Her builder refused to launch her, as he had not been paid to that time. Finally launched in June 1800, she was renamed ''Géographe'' on 23 August 1800.

On 19 October 1800, under captain [[Nicolas Baudin]], she departed [[Le Havre]] with [[French corvette Naturaliste|''Naturaliste'']] for an [[Baudin expedition of 1800 to 1802|exploration of Australia]]. She carried a number of scholars, painters, and designers, as well as [[Anselme Riedlé]], the gardener, who had already accompanied Baudin on a previous expedition, and [[Charles Alexander Lesueur]], an artist.&lt;ref name=Barrey&gt;Barrey (1907), p.60.&lt;/ref&gt; The two vessels reached [[Tenerife]] on 13 November. They then crossed the equator on 11 December and arrived at [[Isle de France (Mauritius)]], on 16 March 1801.&lt;ref name=Barrey/&gt;

For some 18 months ''Naturaliste'' and ''Géographe'' explored the less-known regions of [[New Holland (Australia)]], and [[Van Diemen's Land]].&lt;ref name=Barrey/&gt; On 30 May Baudin made his first major discovery. Baudin named the bay they found that day on the coast of [[Western Australia]] [[Geographe Bay]]. Later, the cape at the south of the bay was named [[Cape Naturaliste]].&lt;ref&gt;Fornasiero, ''et al.'',  (2004), pp.44-45.&lt;/ref&gt;

Riedlé died at Timor on 21 October 1801 where he was collecting specimens in the region of Kupang.
Lasueur, with [[François Péron]], took over the duties as naturalist after the death of the expedition's zoologist [[René Maugé]]. Together Lasueur and Maugé collected over 100,000 zoological specimens. In 1802 Lasueur made the only known sketches of the [[King Island emu]] in its natural habitat (the bird became extinct in 1822).

In late 1802 the expedition was at [[Port Jackson]], where the government sold 60 casks of flour and 25 casks of salt meat to Baudin to resupply his two vessels. The supplies permitted ''Naturaliste'' to return to France and ''Géographe'' to continue her explorations of the Australian coast.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Historical Records of Australia]]'' (1915), Series I vol.3 1801/02, p.600.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Géographe'' returned to Le Havre on 23 March 1804, under [[Frigate Captain]] Milius, as Baudin had died during the expedition.

After her return her armament was steadily reduced. From 1807 she served as a powder hulk in the
Caudran district at Lorient. The next year she became a barracks ship. In October 1811 ''Géographe'' replaced ''Société'' as the headquarters hulk for Lorient.&lt;ref name=WR/&gt;

''Géographe'' was decommissioned in December, but continued in use as a service craft.&lt;ref name=WR/&gt;

==Fate==
On 6 April 1819 ''Géographe'' was reported unserviceable and was struck.&lt;ref name=WR&gt;Winfield and Roberts (2015), p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Africa, the wealthiest nations are the three on the southern tip of the continent, [[South Africa]], [[Botswana]], and [[Namibia]], and the countries of [[North Africa]].

Within prosperous nations, wealth often increases with distance from the equator; for example, the [[Northeast United States]] has long been wealthier than its southern counterpart and northern [[Italy]] wealthier than southern regions of the country.
[[Image:GDP per capita (nominal) 2015.png|thumb|right|[[Gross domestic product]] ([[Real versus nominal value|nominal]] per capita) in 2015]]

Researchers at [[Harvard]]'s Center for International Development found in 2001 that only three tropical economies — [[Hong Kong]], [[Singapore]], and part of [[Taiwan]] — were classified as high-income by the [[World Bank]], while all countries within regions zoned as [[temperate]] had either middle- or high-income economies .&lt;ref&gt;[http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Study/Location/  Location, Location, Location]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are exceptions. For example, [[Russia]] is not as well off as the United States or even [[Australia]]; the latter is wealthier than Southern Europe. Also, within Russia, [[Moscow]] and especially [[St. Petersburg]] are wealthier than, for example, [[Siberia]]. Similarly, [[Germany]]'s poorest regions are situated in the North East. The wealthiest nations of Central America are generally those closest to the equator, namely Panama and Costa Rica, and Mongolia is poorer than China. Also, mainland United States is richer than Alaska and Canada. In Canada, the poorest region is in the North. In China, the poorest regions are in the West and the North East. And in southeast Asia, the richest nations are [[Malaysia]], [[Thailand]] and [[Singapore]], straddling the equator.

==Measurement==

Most of the recent studies use national [[gross domestic product]] per person, as measured by the [[World Bank]] and the [[International Monetary Fund]], as the unit of comparison. Intra-national comparisons use their own data, and political divisions such as states or provinces then delineate the study areas.

==Explanations==

===Historic===
One of the first to describe and assess the phenomenon was the [[France|French]] [[philosopher]] [[Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]], who asserted in the 18th century that "cold air constringes (''sic'') the extremities of the external fibres of the body; this increases their elasticity, and favours the return of the blood from the extreme parts to the heart. It contracts those very fibres; consequently it also increases their force. On the contrary, warm air relaxes and lengthens the extremes of the fibres; of course it diminishes their force and elasticity. People are therefore more vigorous in cold climates."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.constitution.org/cm/sol_14.htm Montesquieu "Of Laws in Relation to the Nature of the Climate"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 19th century historian [[Henry Thomas Buckle]] wrote that "climate, soil, food, and the aspects of nature are the primary causes of intellectual progress--the first three indirectly, through determining the accumulation and distribution of wealth, and the last by directly influencing the accumulation and distribution of thought, the imagination being stimulated and the understanding subdued when the phenomena of the external world are sublime and terrible, the understanding being emboldened and the imagination curbed when they are small and feeble."

===Cultural innovation===

Physiologist [[Jared Diamond]] was inspired to write his [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning work ''[[Guns, Germs, and Steel]]'' by a question posed by [[Yali (politician)|Yali]], a [[New Guinea]]n politician: why were Europeans so much wealthier than his people? In this book, Diamond argues that the [[Europe]]-[[Asia]] land mass is particularly favorable for the transition of societies from [[hunter-gatherer]] to farming communities. This continent stretches much further along the same lines of latitude than any of the other continents. Since it is much easier to transfer a domesticated species along the same latitude than it is to move it to a warmer or colder climate, any species developed at a particular latitude will be transferred across the continent in a relatively short amount of time. Thus the inhabitants of the Eurasian continent have had a built-in advantage in terms of earlier development of farming, and a greater range of plants and animals from which to choose.

Diamond notes that modern technologies and institutions were designed primarily in a small area of northwestern Europe. After the [[Scientific Revolution]] in Europe in the 16th century, the quality of life increased and wealth began to spread to the middle class. This included agricultural techniques, machines, and medicines.  These technologies and models readily spread to areas colonized by Europe which happened to be of similar climate, such as North America and Australia.  As these areas also became centres of innovation, this bias was further enhanced. Technologies from automobiles to power lines are more often designed for colder and drier regions, since most of their customers are from these regions.

The book goes on to document a [[feedback]] effect of technologies being designed for the wealthy, which makes them more wealthy and thus more able to fund technological development.  He notes that the far north has not always been the wealthiest latitude; until only a few centuries ago, the wealthiest belt stretched from Southern Europe through the [[Middle East]], northern [[India]] and southern [[China]].  A dramatic shift in technologies, beginning with ocean-going ships and culminating in the [[Industrial Revolution]], saw the most developed belt move north into northern Europe, China, and the Americas.  Northern Russia became a [[superpower]], while southern [[India]] became impoverished and colonized.  Diamond argues that such dramatic changes demonstrate that the current distribution of wealth is not due to immutable factors such as climate or [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], citing the early emergence of [[agriculture]] in ancient [[Mesopotamia]] as evidence.

Diamond also notes the feedback effect in the growth of medical technology, stating that more research money goes into curing the ailments of northerners.

===Disease===

[[Tick]]s, [[mosquito]]s, and [[rat]]s, which continue to be important disease [[Vector (epidemiology)|vectors]], benefit from warmer temperatures and higher humidities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/372219.stm Sci/Tech:Global warming disease warning]&lt;/ref&gt; There has long been a [[malaria|malarial belt]] spanning the equatorial portions of the [[globe]]; the disease is especially deadly to children under the age of five.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/impact/statistics.htm Centers for Disease Control: Statistics and Malaria's Public Health Impact]&lt;/ref&gt; Notably it has been almost impossible for most forms of northern [[livestock]] to thrive due to the [[Endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] presence of the [[tsetse fly]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilri.org/InfoServ/Webpub/Fulldocs/Inagura/Impact.htm The Impact and Implementation of Theileriosis and Trypanosomyasis on Livestock Production in Africa]&lt;/ref&gt;

Jared Diamond has linked domestication of animals in Europe and Asia to the development of diseases that enabled these countries to conquer the inhabitants of other continents. The close association of people in Eurasia with their domesticated animals provided a vector for the rapid transmission of diseases. Inhabitants of lands with few domesticated species were never exposed to the same range of diseases, and so, at least on the American continents, succumbed to diseases introduced from Eurasia. These effects were exhaustively discussed in [[William Hardy McNeill|William McNeill's]] book ''Plagues and Peoples''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://worldhistoryconnected.press.uiuc.edu/3.1/br_whelchel.html World History Connected: Review of ''Plagues and Peoples'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2001 Harvard study mentions high [[infant mortality]] as another factor; since birth rates usually increase in compensation, women may delay their entry into the workforce to care for their younger children. The education of the surviving children then becomes difficult, perpetuating a cycle of poverty.

*In "Climate and Scale in Economic Growth," William A. Masters and Margaret S. McMillan of [[Purdue University]] and [[Tufts University]] hypothesize that the disparity is partially due to the effects of frost in increasing soil [[Fertility (soil)|fertility]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ksg.harvard.edu/CID/cidwp/048.pdf Climate and Scale in Economic Growth]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Hernando Zuleta, of the [[Universidad del Rosario]], has proposed that where output fluctuations are more profound, i.e. areas that experience winter, saving is more pronounced, which leads to the adoption or creation of capital-intensive technologies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=901794 Seasons, Savings, and Gdp]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson, and James A. Robinson of [[MIT]] argued in 2001 that in places where Europeans faced high mortality rates, they could not settle and were more likely to set up exploitative institutions. These institutions offered no protection for private property or checks and balances against government expropriation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://econ-www.mit.edu/faculty/download_pdf.php?id=144 The Colonial Origins of Comparative Development: An Empirical Investigation]&lt;/ref&gt; They assert that after controlling for the effect of institutions, countries in Africa or those closer to the equator do not have lower incomes.  This work has been disputed by [[David Albouy]], who argues that European mortality rates in the study were badly mismeasured, falsely supporting its conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://repositories.cdlib.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1055&amp;context=iber/cider The Colonial Origins of Comparative Development: An Investigation of the Settler Mortality Data]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact of global warming on wealth==

In a 2006 paper discussing the potential impact of [[global warming]] on wealth, John K. Horowitz of the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]] predicted that a 2-degree Fahrenheit temperature increase across all countries would cause a decrease of 2 to 6 percent in world GDP, with a best estimate of around 3.5 percent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arec.umd.edu/people/faculty/jhorowitz/Paper4_4.pdf The Income-Temperature Relationship in a Cross-Section of Countries and its Implications for Global Warming]&lt;/ref&gt; [[United Nations]] Secretary-General [[Ban Ki-moon]] has expressed concern that global warming will exacerbate the existing poverty in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=21448&amp;Cr=climate&amp;Cr1 Poor countries will suffer most from global warming, Ban Ki-moon warns]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''ISO 3166-2:BS''' is the entry for [[the Bahamas]] in [[ISO 3166-2]], part of the [[ISO 3166]] [[standardization|standard]] published by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO), which defines [[code]]s for the names of the principal [[country subdivision|subdivision]]s (e.g., [[province]]s or [[state (administrative division)|state]]s) of all [[country|countries]] coded in [[ISO 3166-1]].

Currently for the Bahamas, ISO 3166-2 codes are defined for 1 island ([[New Providence]]) and [[districts of the Bahamas|31 districts]].

Each code consists of two parts, separated by a hyphen. The first part is {{mono|BS}}, the [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] code of the Bahamas. The second part is two letters.

==Current codes==
Subdivision names are listed as in the ISO 3166-2 standard published by the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency (ISO 3166/MA).

The '''''Imperial Gazetteer of Scotland''''' is a [[topography|topographical]] [[dictionary]] first published in parts between 1854 and 1857, 
edited by the Reverend [[John Marius Wilson]]. It also appeared in two undated volumes in 1868 and was described as "A Dictionary of Scottish Topography compiled from the most recent authorities, and forming a complete body of Scottish Geography, Physical, Statistical and Historical."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maybole.org/history/Gazatteer/gazetteer.htm The Imperial Gazetteer of Scotland Volume II (Gordon-Zetland)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070823020427/http://www.maybole.org/history/Gazatteer/gazetteer.htm |date=2007-08-23 }} at maybole.org (accessed 5 November 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gazetteer contains a detailed description of Scotland and a brief article on each [[county]], [[city]], [[borough]], [[civil parish]], and [[diocese]], describing their political and physical features and naming the principal people of each place.

The publishers were [[Archibald Fullarton|A. Fullarton and Co.]], of London &amp; Edinburgh. The work was later joined as a companion by Wilson's ''[[Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales]]'', which followed in six volumes between 1870 and 1872.

==Overview==
This road, is an important trade corridor between Tanzania, Kenya and South Sudan. It links four Kenyan counties and for the residents of these communities, it is a vital trade and transportation link to [[Kisumu]] and [[Nairobi]], two of the largest cities in the country. As at April 2016, the road surface has deteriorated and is heavily potholed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|

The '''''Journal of Political Ecology''''' is an annual [[open access]] [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]] covering [[political ecology]]. It was established in 1994 as one of the first open access journals in the social sciences, by James B. Greenberg and Thomas K. Park ([[University of Arizona]]), to experiment with online formats and to showcase new work in the emerging field of political ecology. The current [[editors-in-chief]] are Simon P.J. Batterbury ([[Lancaster University]] and [[University of Melbourne]]) and Casey Walsh ([[University of California, Santa Barbara]]). There is an international editorial board.&lt;ref&gt;http://jpe.library.arizona.edu/Masthead.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication==
Unlike the majority of academic journals it is produced free of charge for readers and authors using voluntary academic labour, and its website is hosted at the University of Arizona library. There is no journal budget and editorial work is voluntary. JPE is abstracted and indexed in [[Scopus]], and the number of articles published, and citation index, has risen substantially since 2014.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ecologiapolitica.info/?p=3564&lt;/ref&gt; The journal publishes Eric Wolf Prize papers submitted by early career scholars to the [[Society for Applied Anthropology]] annual meetings in the United States. The journal is a founding member of the ''Free Journal Network'' &lt;ref&gt;https://freejournals.org/ Free Journal Network&lt;/ref&gt; that supports and lobbies for quality open access publishing.

==Scope==
The scope of the journal is research into the linkages between [[political economy]] and [[human impact on the environment]], particularly where there are inequalities in access to resources, or an increase in vulnerability, as a result of resource use or assertion of political power. Articles must address some aspect of this relationship, framed in political ecology, and topics have ranged from [[mining]] and [[indigenous peoples of Oceania]], to drug production in [[Lesotho]], [[marine protected area]] management in Vietnam, the [[sandalwood]] trade in [[East Timor]], environmental pollution in post-communist countries, water consumption and management in the United States West and Mexico, and the plight of [[Adivasi]] peoples living in national parks in India. Special issues are occasionally published, for example ''Ecologies of Hope'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jpe.library.arizona.edu/Volume20/Volume_20.html |title=Journal of Political Ecology |publisher=University of Arizona Library |date=2013 |accessdate=2013-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; edited by S. Ravi Rajan and Colin Duncan in 2013, ''Non-capitalist political ecologies''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jpe.library.arizona.edu/Volume21/Volume_21.html |title=Journal of Political Ecology |publisher=University of Arizona Library |date=2013 |accessdate=2013-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; edited by Brian Burke and Boone Shear and ''Degrowth, Culture and Power'' edited by Lisa Gezon and Susan Paulson in 2017.

The four most important research areas covered by the 145 articles published as of late 2014 were 1) Food and agricultural issues 2) social aspects of conservation 3) fishing issues and 4) mining and social struggles.&lt;ref&gt;Batterbury, S.P.J. 2015.

A '''''koog''''' (plural: ''köge'') or '''''groden''''' is a type of [[polder]] found on the [[North Sea]] coast of [[Germany]] that is established by the construction of [[dyke (embankment)|dykes]] enclosing the land which is then drained to form [[marshland]]. This type of land reclamation is also used along rivers. In general, a ''koog'' is protected by [[Levee|embankments]] known as dykes (''Deiche'').
[[File:Westerkoog feb.jpg|thumb|[[Hedwigenkoog|Westerkoog]] (Dithmarschen): typical ''koog'' landscape]]

== Etymology ==
Unlike the meaning in modern German, [[Ingvaeonic languages|Ingvaeonic]] ''*kāg'', [[Old Dutch]] ''*kōg'', modern [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''koog'' and [[West Frisian Dutch]] ''kaag'' all designate "land outside the dike". In the Netherlands, it primarily survives in place names (e.g. [[De Koog]], [[Koog aan de Zaan]], [[Kaag]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymologiebank.nl/trefwoord/koog Koog] at etymologiebank.nl&lt;/ref&gt; From the [[Dithmarschen]] word ''koch'' (15th and 16th centuries), it went into [[Danish language|Danish]] as ''kog''. In [[North Frisian language|North Frisian]] it is ''kuch''. The spelling ''koog'' was used by the poet Michael Richey in 1755 and around 1700, what is now the port of [[Cuxhaven]] was still called ''Koogshaven''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Friedrich Kluge]]: ''Etymologisches Wörterbuch''. De Gruyter, Berlin 1975, Lemma Kog.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Polders ==
In the [[Netherlands]] and in the adjacent regions of [[East Frisia]] the word [[polder]] (Low German: ''Poller'') is used for land enclosed by embankments from where the water is artificially drained. The etymology of the word polder/poller is unclear but it is probably related to English ''pool''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymologiebank.nl/trefwoord/polder1 Polder] at etymologiebank.nl&lt;/ref&gt; 

== ''Groden'' ==
The term ''groden'' (c.f. the English verb "to grow") used in [[Lower Saxony]], particularly in  the eastern part of East Frisia and in the [[Oldenburg Land]], refers to new areas of land washed up by the sea. Sediments are deposited by the sea on [[mud flat]]s when the [[tide]]s change. After reaching a certain height, the land is dyked. Dyked land becomes ''innengroden''. As a result of draining the fertile soil compacts and, over time, can sink until it is below sea level. The rising sea level in front of the dyke and the sinking of the old, now drained, sea areas behind the dyke leads to further dykes being built at an ever-higher level to enclose the newly dyked areas of marsh. In this way a so-called "polder staircase" is formed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalpark-wattenmeer.de/sites/default/files/media/pdf/_klimapfad_broschuere_klein.pdf Klimapfad Sande, Seite 22] (pdf; 1.5&amp;nbsp;MB), retrieved 20 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The name ''groden'' is found for example in the borough of [[Wilhelmshaven]] in the villages of Altengroden, [[Neuengroden]] and [[Fedderwardergroden]], the [[Heppenser Groden Naval Base|Heppenser]], Voslapper and Rüstersieler Groden, and in the surrounding area are the [[Cäciliengroden]], Petersgroden and Adelheidsgroden. All these areas, whether they emerged more recently (i.e. in the 20th century) or in older times, were formed as a result of dyke enclosure and ''Aufspülung'', as is often the case with polders.

: → ''See also [[salt marsh]]''

== Drainage ==
[[File:KinderdijkMolens01.jpg|thumb|(Pump) mill on a dyke at the Overwaard Polder near [[Kinderdijk]]]]
Because a ''koog'' often lies below the level of the adjacent sea or river, it has to be continually drained. This is carried out with the aid of [[soakaway]]s, [[sluice]]s, [[pumping station]]s and [[water pump]]s.&lt;ref name="Loki"&gt;Klaus-Joachim Lorenzen-Schmidt, Ortwin Pelc: ''Schleswig-Holstein Lexikon''. Wachholtz, Neumunster, 2006, Lemma Koog.&lt;/ref&gt;

Today the pumps are powered by engines, in pre-industrial times and sometimes even into the period of intense industrialisation, they were driven by [[wind power]] ([[wind pump]]s). The groups of [[wind mill]]s on the dykes of the [[Rhine]] delta - a symbol of the Netherlands - are old water pumps.

== Riparian ''köge'' ==
As well land reclaimed from the sea, a ''koog'' may also refer to land reclaimed alongside rivers. These are usually wet areas that are now used for agriculture. This entails creating a completely new ecosystem from a river meadow or a [[carr (landform)|carr]]. Often its name will recall its original situation, for example, the [[Oderbruch]].

On the [[Rhine]], [[Elbe]] and [[Oder]] rivers these areas are also used for [[flood protection]]. Once the flooding has subsided, water is pumped out again and the land can be used for farming until the next flood.

Until the 1950s, ''köge'' were mainly created to reclaim land for farming; since then [[Coastal management|coastal defence]] has been the main aim.

== North German ''köge'' ==
On the western coast of [[Schleswig-Holstein]] and on the shores of the Lower [[Elbe]] over 230 ''koogs'' have been created over the centuries. The oldest ones are in the borough of [[Eiderstedt]]; they date to the 11th century.&lt;ref name="Loki" /&gt; After the [[Burchardi flood]] of 1634, an increasing number of "[[octroi]]" ''koogs'' were built.&lt;br&gt; Well known ''koogs'' include:

Ruanda-Urundi formed part of [[German East Africa]] until it was [[East African Campaign (World War I)#Belgian operations, 1916–17|captured]] by [[Belgium|Belgian]] forces during [[World War I]]. After that, the territory became a [[League of Nations]] [[League of Nations mandate|mandate]], and later a [[United Nations]] [[United Nations Trust Territories|trust territory]], under Belgian control, until 1962 when the constituent parts of the territory became independent.

For residents of the subregion of Ruanda, see [[List of colonial residents of Rwanda]].

For residents of the subregion of Urundi, see [[List of colonial residents of Burundi]].

This is a list of "'''twin towns'''" or "'''sister cities'''" in the continent of South America — that is, pairs of towns or cities in different countries which have [[town twinning]] arrangements. Where known, the date of formation of the twinning agreement is included in parentheses.

Note that the list is likely to always remain incomplete, since no canonical list of such arrangements exists; even those towns that are listed may well have arrangements which are not listed here.
However, a searchable, interactive list is maintained by [[Sister Cities International]]. Note also that any twinning arrangement ''should'' be listed at two locations in the series of lists: once for each of the towns involved in the arrangement.

The '''Maracaibo Basin''', also known as '''Lake Maracaibo natural region''', '''Lake Maracaibo depression''' or '''Lake Maracaibo Lowlands''', is a [[foreland basin]] and one of the eight [[natural regions of Venezuela]], found in the northwestern corner of [[Venezuela]] in South America. Covering over 36,657 square km, it is a hydrocarbon-rich region that has produced over 30 billion bbl of oil with an estimated 44 billion bbl yet to be recovered.&lt;ref name="Pet-Over"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Escalona|first1=A.|last2=Mann|first2=P.|title=An overview of the Petroleum system of Maracaibo Basin|journal=American Association of Petroleum Geologists Bulletin|date=2006|volume=90|pages=657–678|doi=10.1306/10140505038}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dep-Hist"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Guzman|first1=J.|last2=Fisher|first2=W.|title=Early and middle Miocene depositional history of the Maracaibo Basin, western Venezuela|journal=American Association of Petroleum Geologists Bulletin|date=2006|volume=90|number=4|pages=625–655|doi=10.1306/10110505035}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basin is characterized by a large shallow tidal [[estuary]], [[Lake Maracaibo]], located near its center. The Maracaibo basin has a complex tectonic history that dates back to the Jurassic period with multiple evolution stages. Despite its complexity, these major tectonic stages are well preserved within its stratigraphy. This makes The Maracaibo basin one of the most valuable basins for reconstructing South America's early tectonic history.

==Geologic setting==
The Maracaibo basin is surrounded by two mountain ranges, the [[Méridas Andes]] to the southeast and the [[Sierra de Perija]] to the west, with the [[Gulf of Venezuela]] to the north. The basin lies within a region of deformation created by the interactions of the Caribbean and South American plate boundaries. These interactions include the collision of the [[Caribbean plate]] with the [[South American plate]] in the [[Cenozoic era]], which formed a belt of foreland basins across northern South America.&lt;ref name="Geo-Tec-Sett"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mann|first1=P.|last2=Escalona|first2=A.|last3=Castillo|first3=M.|title=Regional Geologic and Tectonic Setting of the Maracaibo supergiant basin, western Venezuela|journal=American Association of Petroleum Geologists Bulletin|date=2006|volume=90|number=4|pages=445–478|doi=10.1306/10110505031}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are three main fault zones associated with the basin: the Santa Marta-Bucaramanga fault zone, the Boconó fault zone, and the Oca fault zone. These strike-slip zones create a v-shape around the basin which form a smaller plate known as the Maracaibo block. Within this v-shaped wedge, multiple smaller fault zones are present including the Icotea strike-slip fault. Thus the Maracaibo basin geometry is dominated by strike-slip tectonics and subordinate folding with a main syncline, the Maracaibo syncline, striking north-south through the center of Lake Maracaibo.&lt;ref name="Geo-Tec-Sett"/&gt;

==Tectonic history==
The formation of the Maracaibo basin began 160 Ma with the North American, South American, and Caribbean plates playing key roles in the evolution of the basin. It developed into the present-day foreland basin via multiple stages throughout time: Late Jurassic, Late Cretaceous, Paleocene-Eocene, and the Oligocene-Holocene stages.

[[File:South American plates.png|thumb|left|Present-day tectonic plate position and geometry]]

===Late Jurassic===

During the break-up of [[Pangea]], the [[North American plate]] began to separate from the South American plate. The two plates rifted away from each other forming the "[[Proto-Caribbean Seaway]]", an 1800&amp;nbsp;km wide region of oceanic crust.&lt;ref name="Geo-Tec-Sett"/&gt; As this rifting occurred, the Caribbean plate began its eastward migration from the Pacific region.&lt;ref name="Car-Sea"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Neill|first1=I.|last2=Kerr|first2=A.|first3=K.|last3=Chamberlain|first4=A.|last4=Schmitt|first5=F.|last5=Urbani|first6=A.|last6=Hastie|first7=J.|last7=Pindell|first8=T.|last8=Barry|first9=I.|last9=Millar|title=Vestiges of the proto-Caribbean seaway: Origin of the San Souci Volcanic Group, Trinidad|journal=Tectonophysics|date=2014|volume=626|pages=170–185|url=http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0040195114002005/1-s2.0-S0040195114002005-main.pdf?_tid=d116ec48-cca8-11e4-a5af-00000aacb361&amp;acdnat=1426598796_4e841db839ae90c61be15ca4fc069a49|doi=10.1016/j.tecto.2014.04.019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Late Cretaceous===

After rifting, the northern edge of the South American plate developed into a [[passive margin]] with the Proto-Caribbean Seaway. This stable passive margin allowed for thermal subsidence to occur which began to increase due to the building up of the [[Cordillera Central (Colombia)|Cordillera Central]] range of Colombia.&lt;ref name="Pet-Over"/&gt; This uplift was initiated by the eastward moving Caribbean plate interacting with the Nazca and northwestern South American plate.

[[File:Caribbean plate tectonics-en.png|thumb|400px|Caribbean plate tectonics-en]]

===Paleocene-Eocene===

The Caribbean plate has been migrating eastward from the Pacific region and eventually collided with the South American plate in the middle Paleocene. This collision transformed the passive margin of northern South America into an [[active margin]]. The Caribbean plate had subducted significant amounts of oceanic Proto-Caribbean crust by this time and was now subducting beneath the South American crust.&lt;ref name="Geo-Tec-Sett"/&gt; This boundary interaction was greatly affecting the region of northwestern South America. Foreland basins formed across the region which received large amount of sediment due to the plate boundary interactions to the north.

===Oligocene-Holocene===

The Caribbean plate continued its eastward migration and continued to deform the northwestern regions of South America while also producing deformation along the northeastern regions.&lt;ref name="Sub-Mechs"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Escalona|first1=A.|last2=Mann|first2=P.|title=Tectonics, basin subsidence mechanisms, and paleogeography of the Caribbean-South American plate boundary zone|journal=[[Marine and Petroleum Geology]] |date=2006|volume=28|pages=8–39|doi=10.1016/j.marpetgeo.2010.01.016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As plate migration proceeded, accretion along the South American plate increased. This accretion greatly influenced mountain building of the region. Uplift of the Sierra de Perijas occurred during the Oligocene whereas the Mérida Andes formed later in the middle Miocene.&lt;ref name="Geo-Tec-Sett"/&gt; This uplift and subsequent erosion deposited large amount of sediment into the basin. The Maracaibo syncline formed later in this stage due to "inversion of Eocene rift-related structures".&lt;ref name="Geo-Tec-Sett"/&gt;

==Stratigraphy==

The main events of sediment deposition follow the same pattern as the tectonic events, where major sedimentary formations coincide with the four tectonic stages mentioned above.

===Depositional history===

The break-up of Pangea resulted in the break-up of the Paleozoic metamorphic basement rock. The basement rock formed half-grabens where eroded sediments from the break-up were then deposited.&lt;ref name="C-H-Str"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Castillo|first1=M.|last2=Mann|title=Cretaceous to Holocene structural and stratigraphic development in south Lake Maracaibo, Venezuela, inferred from well and three-dimensional seismic data|journal=American Association of Petroleum Geologists|date=2006|volume=90|pages=529–565|doi=10.1306/10130505036}}&lt;/ref&gt; These sediments created the metasedimentary rocks of the La Quinta formation.&lt;ref name="Geo-Tec-Sett"/&gt; Development of the passive margin occurred after rifting. Characterized by carbonate and shale, the stable passive margin allowed for large amounts of clastic sediment to deposit and stay undisturbed until burial. Some of the most important source rocks come from this stage, including the La Luna and Socuy formations. The timing of the Paleogene collision is clearly recorded in the stratigraphy of the Maracaibo basin. There is an abrupt change in sediment type of the late Cretaceous made evident by the thickly deposited, pelagic shale of the Colon formation. This represents the beginnings of the Caribbean arc collision with the South American plate. As the collision continued, this region shifted from the passive margin stage to the foreland basin stage. These Paleogene sediments are characterized by fluvial and deltaic facies&lt;ref name="Geo-Tec-Sett"/&gt; and make up the Misoa formation, fluvial sandstones that act as [[hydrocarbon]] reservoirs. Mountain building begins in the late Paleogene, producing mostly continental sandstone facies.

==Hydrocarbon resources==

Oil was discovered in producible quantities in Venezuela in 1914 at the town of Mene Grande in the east central part of the Maracaibo basin near a surface oil seep.

Today the basin accounts for approximately 50% of Venezuela's crude export capacity and approximately 15% of proven [[Venezuelan oil reserves]]. The region hosts one of the world's largest oil refinery complexes, the [[Paraguaná Refinery Complex]]. The nearby islands of [[Aruba]] and [[Curaçao]] also host large refineries that process oil from the Maracaibo basin. Together these refineries form the 'Venezuelan Circuit' of [[PDVSA]].

The Bolivar Coastal Field, BCF, on the eastern shore of Lake Maracaibo produces from Miocene sandstones and Eocene sandstones.&lt;ref name=Martinez328&gt;Martinez, A.R., Giant Fields of Venezuela, in Geology of Giant Petroleum Fields, AAPG Memoir 14, Halbouty, M.T., editor, Tulsa: American Association of Petroleum Geologists, p. 328.&lt;/ref&gt; West of Maracaibo, the La Paz Field produces from Cretaceous limestones, and oil is found in the stratigraphic traps of Boscan, Los Claros and the Urdaneta fields.&lt;ref name=Martinez328/&gt;

Venezuela produces a mix of conventional heavy crude and unconventional crude derived from bitumen. This latter source, previously too expensive to produce in quantity, now makes up an increasing large percent of Venezuela's oil exports – 600,000 of Venezuela's three million barrels per day in 2006. In the Maracaibo Basin, the balance of reserves is toward its conventional deposits. As the country continues shifting toward bitumen production due to its increasing profitability and decreases in conventional reserves, the level of Maracaibo Basin oil production will decrease, while that of the Orinoco Belt and its massive bitumen deposits will increase.

{{Biodiversity}}
A '''natural landscape''' is the original landscape that exists before it is acted upon by human culture.&lt;ref group = note&gt;"The area prior to the introduction of man 's activity is represented by one body of morphologic facts. The forms that man has introduced are another set. We may call the former, with reference to man, the original, natural landscape. In its entirety it no longer exists in many parts of the world, but its reconstruction and understanding are the first part of formal morphonology." Carl O. Sauer, "The Morphology of Landscape". ''University of California Publications in Geography'', vol. 2, No. 2, 12 October 1925, p. 37.[https://archive.org/stream/universityofc02univ/universityofc02univ_djvu.txt]&lt;/ref&gt; The natural landscape and the [[cultural landscape]] are separate parts of the [[landscape]].&lt;ref group = note&gt;"The cultural landscape is fashioned from a natural landscape by a culture group. Culture is the agent, the natural area is the medium, the cultural landscape the result." Carl O. Sauer, "The Morphology of Landscape", p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the twenty-first century landscapes that are totally untouched by human activity no longer exist, so that reference is sometimes now made to degrees of naturalness within a landscape.&lt;ref group = note&gt;The [[European Environment Agency]]'s planned forest naturalness index is an example of an attempt to define one type of natural landscape in Europe. The Agency lists forests in three categories: (1) [[Plantations]]; (2) Semi-natural; and (3) Naturally dynamic. The latter are "forests whose structure, composition and function have been shaped by natural dynamics without substantial [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] influence over a long period of time".&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Silent Spring]]'' (1962) [[Rachel Carson]] describes a roadside verge as it used to look: "Along the roads, laurel, viburnum and alder, great ferns and wildflowers delighted the traveler’s eye through much of the year" and then how it looks now following the use of [[herbicide]]s: "The roadsides, once so attractive, were now lined with browned and withered vegetation as though swept by fire".&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge, Mass.: Riverside Press, 1962, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the landscape before it is sprayed is biologically degraded, and may well contains alien species, the concept of what might constitute a natural landscape can still be deduced from the context.

The phrase "natural landscape" was first used in connection with [[landscape painting]], and [[landscape gardening]], to contrast a formal style with a more natural one, closer to nature. [[Alexander von Humboldt]] (1769 – 1859) was to further conceptualize this into the idea of a natural landscape ''separate'' from the [[cultural landscape]]. Then in 1908 [[geographer]] [[Otto Schlüter]] developed the terms original landscape (''Urlandschaft'') and its opposite cultural landscape (''Kulturlandschaft'') in an attempt to give the science of geography a subject matter that was different from the other sciences. An early use of the actual phrase "natural landscape" by a [[geographer]] can be found in  [[Carl O. Sauer]]'s paper "The Morphology of Landscape" (1925).&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl O. Sauer]], "The Morphology of Landscape". ''University of California Publications in Geography'' 2 (2), pp. 19-53.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins of the term==
The concept of a natural landscape was first developed in connection with [[landscape painting]], though the actual term itself was first used in relation to [[landscape gardening]]. In both cases it was used to contrast a formal style with a more natural one, that is closer to nature. Chunglin Kwa suggests, "that a seventeenth-century or early-eighteenth-century person could experience natural scenery ‘just like on a painting,’ and so, with or without the use of the word itself, designate it as a landscape."&lt;ref&gt;Chunglin Kwa, "Alexander von Humboldt's invention of the natural landscape", ''The European Legacy'', Vol. 10, No. 2, pp. 149-162, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to landscape gardening John Aikin, commented in 1794: "Whatever, therefore, there be of ''novelty'' in the singular scenery of an artificial garden, it is soon exhausted, whereas the infinite diversity of a natural landscape presents an inexhaustible flore of new forms".&lt;ref&gt;J. Aikin, M.D., ''Letters from a Father to His Son, on Various Topics, Relative to Literature and the Conduct of Life. Written in the Years 1792 and 1793'',  (Philadelphia:  Samuel Harrison Smith), p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in 1844 the prominent American landscape gardener [[Andrew Jackson Downing]] comments: "straight canals, round or oblong pieces of water, and all the regular forms of the geometric mode ... would evidently be in violent opposition to the whole character and expression of natural landscape".&lt;ref&gt;''A Treatise on the Theory and Practice of Landscape Gardening Adapted to North America''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his extensive travels in South America, [[Alexander von Humboldt]] became the first to conceptualize a natural landscape separate from the cultural landscape, though he does not actually use these terms.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext05/qnct310.txt&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/routledg/cele/2005/00000010/00000002/art00002 Chunglin Kwa, Alexander von Humboldt's invention of the natural landscape, The European Legacy, Vol. 10, No. 2, pp. 149-162, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group = note&gt;[http://www.avhumboldt.net/humboldt/publications/paragraph/did/35/vid/38/cid/244/tid/7698/text/The-description-of-nature-in-its-manifold-richness-of-form-as-a-distinct-branch-of-poetic-literat] "The description of nature in its manifold richness of form, as a distinct branch of poetic literature, was wholly unknown to the Greeks. The landscape appears among them merely as the basil-ground of the picture of which human figures constitute the main subject. Passions, breaking forth into action, riveted their attention almost exclusively." Alexander von Humboldt ''[[Cosmos: a sketch of a physical description of the universe]]'' (translation 1804), Volume 2, Part I, Paragraph 5, Chapter I.&lt;/ref&gt; Andrew Jackson Downing was aware of, and sympathetic to, Humboldt's ideas, which therefore influenced American landscape gardening.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Horticulturist'', vol.4, no.2, August 1849, which Downing edited.&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, the [[geographer]] [[Otto Schlüter]], in 1908, argued that by defining [[geography]] as a ''Landschaftskunde'' (landscape science) would give geography a logical subject matter shared by no other discipline.&lt;ref&gt;James, P.E &amp; Martin, G (1981) ''All Possible Worlds: A History of Geographical Ideas.'' John Wiley &amp; Sons. New York, p.177.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elkins, T.H (1989) ''Human and Regional Geography in the German-speaking lands in the first forty years of the Twentieth Century''. Entriken, J. Nicholas &amp; Brunn, Stanley D (Eds) ''Reflections on Richard Hartshorne's The nature of geography''. Occasional publications of the Association of the American Geographers, Washington DC., p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; He defined two forms of landscape: the ''Urlandschaft'' (original landscape) or landscape that existed before major human induced changes and the ''Kulturlandschaft'' (cultural landscape) a landscape created by human culture. Schlüter argued that the major task of geography was to trace the changes in these two landscapes.

The term natural landscape is sometimes used as a synonym for [[wilderness]], but for geographers natural landscape is a scientific term which refers to the [[biological]], [[geological]], [[Climatology|climatological]] and other aspects of a landscape, not the cultural values that are implied by the word wilderness.&lt;ref&gt;"The Trouble with Wilderness; or, Getting Back to the Wrong Nature". William Cronon, ed., ''Uncommon Ground: Rethinking the Human Place in Nature''. (New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Co., 1995), pp. 69–90.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The natural and conservation===
Matters are complicated by the fact that the words nature and natural have more than one meaning. On the one hand there is the main dictionary meaning for nature: "The phenomena of the physical world collectively, including plants, animals, the landscape, and other features and products of the earth, as opposed to humans or human creations".&lt;ref&gt;"Nature", ''New Oxford American Dictionary''&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, there is the growing awareness, especially since [[Charles Darwin]], of humanities biological affinity with nature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://education.seattlepi.com/animals-share-human-dna-sequences-6693.html "Animals That Share Human DNA Sequences", Seattlepi.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]] of the first definition has its roots is an "ancient concept", because early people viewed "nature, or the nonhuman world […] as a divine ''Other'', godlike in its separation from humans".&lt;ref&gt;Gregory H. Aplett and David N. Cole, "The Trouble with Naturalness: Rethinking Park and Wilderness Goals" in ''Beyond Naturalness: Rethinking Park and Wilderness Stewardshio in an Era of Rapid Change'' (Washington, DC.: Island Press, 2010), p. 14. They cite William Conron's 1995 essay "The Trouble with Wilderness: or, Getting Back to the Wrong Nature".&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Western culture|West]], Christianity's myth of [[The fall of man|the fall]], that is the expulsion of humankind from the [[Garden of Eden]], where all creation lived in harmony, into an imperfect world, has been the major influence.&lt;ref&gt;Joanne Vining, Melinda Merrick and Emily Price, "The Distinction between Humans and Nature". ''Human Ecology Review'', vol.15, no. 1, 2008, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cartesian dualism]], from the seventeenth century on,  further reinforced this dualistic thinking about nature.&lt;ref&gt;Vining, Merrick and Price, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; 
With this [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]] goes value judgement as to [[appeal to nature|the superiority of the natural over the artificial]]. Modern science, however, is moving towards a [[holistic]] view of nature.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Kaika, ''City of Flows: Modernity, Nature, and the City''. (New York: Routledge, 2005), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

====America====
What is meant by natural, within the American [[conservation movement]], has been changing over the last century and a half.

In the mid-nineteenth century American began to realize that the land was becoming more and more domesticated and wildlife was disappearing. This led to the creation of [[National Park Service|American National Parks]] and other conservation sites.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory H. Aplett and David N. Cole, "The Trouble with Naturalness: Rethinking Park and Wilderness Goals" in ''Beyond Naturalness: Rethinking Park and Wilderness Stewardshio in an Era of Rapid Change'' (Washington, DC.: Island Press, 2010), pp. 14-15.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially it was believed that all that was needed to do was to separate what was seen as natural landscape and "avoid disturbances such as logging, grazing, fire and insect outbreaks".&lt;ref name="Aplett and Cole, p. 15"&gt;Aplett and Cole, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; This, and subsequent environmental policy, until recently, was influenced by ideas of the wilderness.&lt;ref&gt;William Cronon, pp. 72-77&lt;/ref&gt; However, this policy was not consistently applied, and in [[Yellowstone Park]], to take one example, the existing ecology was altered, firstly by the exclusion of Native Americans and later with the virtual extermination of the wolf population.&lt;ref name="dow"&gt;{{cite web |title=Defenders of Wildlife |work=A Yellowstone Chronology |url=http://www.defenders.org/wildlife/wolf/ynpchro.html |accessdate=2007-03-19 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607214843/http://www.defenders.org/wildlife/wolf/ynpchro.html |archivedate=7 June 2007}}&lt;/ref{{cite book |last=Merchant |first=Carolyn |title=The Columbia Guide to American Environmental History |publisher=Columbia University Press |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-231-11232-1 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=QQQximQsxSgC |page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A century later, in the mid-twentieth century, it began to be believed that the earlier policy of "protection from disturbance was inadequate to preserve park values", and that is that direct human intervention was necessary to restore the landscape of National Parks to its ‘’natural’’ condition.&lt;ref name="Aplett and Cole, p. 15"/&gt; In 1963 the [[Leopold Report]] argued that "A national park should represent a vignette of primitive America".&lt;ref&gt;Aplett and Cole, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; This policy change eventually led to the restoration of [[History of wolves in Yellowstone|wolves in Yellowstone Park]] in the 1990s.

However, recent research in various disciplines indicates that a pristine natural or "primitive" landscape is a myth, and it now realised that people have been changing the natural into a cultural landscape for a long while, and that there are few places untouched in some way from human influence.&lt;ref&gt;Aplett and Cole, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; The earlier conservation policies were now seen as cultural interventions. The idea of what is natural and what artificial or cultural, and how to maintain the natural elements in a landscape, has been further complicated by the discovery of [[global warming]] and how it is changing natural landscapes.&lt;ref&gt;Aplett and Cole, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

Also important is a reaction recently amongst scholars against dualistic thinking about nature and culture. Maria Kaika comments: "Nowadays, we are beginning to see nature and culture as intertwined once again – not [[ontologically]] separated anymore […].What I used to perceive as a compartmentalized world, consisting of neatly and tightly sealed, autonomous ‘space envelopes’ (the home, the city, and nature) was, in fact, a messy socio-spatial continuum”.&lt;ref&gt;''City of Flows: Modernity, Nature, and the City''. (New York: Routledge, 2005), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; And William Cronon argues against the idea of wilderness because it "involves a dualistic vision in which the human is entirely outside the natural"&lt;ref&gt;Cronon, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; and affirms that "wildness (as opposed to wilderness) can be found anywhere" even "in the cracks of a Manhattan sidewalk".&lt;ref name="Cronon, p. 85"&gt;Cronon, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Cronon we have to "abandon the dualism that sees the tree in the garden as artificial […] and the tree in the wilderness as natural […] Both in some ultimate sense are wild."&lt;ref name="Cronon, p. 85"/&gt; Here he bends somewhat the regular dictionary meaning of wild, to emphasise that nothing natural, even in a garden, is fully under human control.

====Europe====
The landscape of Europe has considerably altered by people and even in an area, like the [[Cairngorm Mountains]] of [[Scotland]], with a low population density, only " the high summits of the [[Cairngorm Mountains]], consist entirely of natural elements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snh.gov.uk/about-scotlands-nature/scotlands-landscapes/what-is-landscape/  [[Scottish Natural Heritage]], ]&lt;/ref&gt; These ''high summits'' are of course only part of the Cairngorms, and there are no longer wolves, bears, wild boar or lynx in Scotland's wilderness.&lt;ref&gt;Murray (1973)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/north_east/6155172.stm | title = Extinct Island Pig Spotted Again | publisher = BBC News | date = 17 November 2006 | accessdate =1 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fraser Darling and Boyd 1969 64"&gt;Fraser Darling and Boyd (1969) p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Scots pine]] in the form of the [[Caledonian forest]] also covered much more of the Scottish landscape than today.&lt;ref&gt;Steven, H. M. &amp; Carlisle, A. (1959). ''The Native Pinewoods of Scotland''. Oliver and Boyd, Edinburgh&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Swiss National Park]], however, represent a more natural landscape. It was founded in 1914, and is one of the earliest national parks in Europe.
Visitors are not allowed to leave the motor road, or paths through the park, make fire or camp. The only building within the park is Chamanna Cluozza, [[mountain hut]]. It is also forbidden to disturb the animals or the plants, or to take home anything found in the park. Dogs are not allowed. Due to these strict rules, the Swiss National Park is the only park in the Alps who has been categorized by the [[IUCN]] as a [[strict nature reserve]], which is the highest protection level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/mabdb/br/brdir/directory/biores.asp?code=SWI+01&amp;mode=all Parc Suisse Biosphere Reserve]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of natural landscape==
No place on the Earth is unaffected by people and their culture. People are part of [[biodiversity]], but human activity affects biodiversity, and this alters the natural landscape.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amnh.org/museum/press/feature/biofact.html National Survey Reveals Biodiversity Crisis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607101209/http://www.amnh.org/museum/press/feature/biofact.html |date=7 June 2007 }} American Museum of Natural History&lt;/ref&gt; Mankind have altered landscape to such an extent that few places on earth remain pristine, but once free of human influences, the landscape can return to a natural or near natural state.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4uDb0H4V5c YouTube, Professor James Lovelock, We can't save the planet, BBC NEWS, 2010/03/30]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wrangell St. Elias National Park.jpg|thumb| [[Glacier]] on the border between [[Alaska]], US, and Canada: [[Kluane-Wrangell-St. Elias-Glacier Bay-Tatshenshini-Alsek]] park system]]
Even the remote [[Yukon]] and [[Alaskan]] wilderness, the bi-national [[Kluane-Wrangell-St. Elias-Glacier Bay-Tatshenshini-Alsek]] park system comprising [[Kluane National Park|Kluane]], [[Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve|Wrangell-St Elias]], [[Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve|Glacier Bay]] and [[Tatshenshini-Alsek Park|Tatshenshini-Alsek]] parks, a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]], is not free from human influence, because the [[Kluane National Park]] lies within the traditional territories of the Champagne and Aishihik [[First Nations]] and [[Kluane First Nation]] who have a long history of living in this region. Through their respective Final Agreements with the Canadian Government, they have made into law their rights to harvest in this region.

==Examples of cultural forces==
Cultural forces intentionally or unintentionally, have an influence upon the landscape.&lt;ref group = note&gt;[http://lamar.colostate.edu/%7Ehrolston/Technol-vs-Nature-Aberdeen.pdf "It is true that certain human technological actions do have unintended consequences that spread everywhere; there are contagious effects that seep into the nooks and crannies of all nature." Holmes Rolston III, "Technology versus nature, What is natural, Journal of Philosophy and Technology", ''Ends and Means'', Vol 2 No.2 Spring 1998, University of Aberdeen, Edinburgh University Press]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cultural landscapes]] are places or artifacts created and maintained by people. Examples of cultural intrusions into a landscape are: fences, roads, parking lots, sand pits, buildings, hiking trails, management of plants, including the introduction of [[invasive species]], extraction or removal of plants, management of animals, mining, hunting, [[natural landscaping]], farming and forestry, pollution. Areas that might be confused with a natural landscape include [[public park]]s, farms, orchards, artificial lakes and reservoirs, managed forests, golf courses, nature center trails, gardens.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3919">'''Niflhel''' ("Misty [[Hel (location)|Hel]]"; ''Nifel'' meaning ''[[fog]]'') is a location in [[Norse mythology]] which appears in the [[Poetic Edda|eddic poems]] ''[[Vafþrúðnismál]]'' and ''[[Baldrs draumar]]'', and also in [[Snorri Sturluson]]'s ''[[Gylfaginning]]''. According to Snorri Sturluson's work, Niflhel could be interpreted as the lowest level of [[Hel (location)|Hel]], but Niflhel and sometimes Hel are conflated with the concept of [[Niflheim]], a term which originates with Sturluson.

==Prose Edda==
===''Gylfaginning''===
In ''Gylfaginning'' by [[Snorri Sturluson]], [[Gylfi]], the old [[Mythical kings of Sweden|king of Scandinavia]], receives an education in Norse mythology from [[Odin]] himself in the guise of three men. Gylfi learns from Odin (as ''Þriði'') that Odin gave [[Ask and Embla|the first man]] his spirit, and that the spirits of just men will live forever in [[Gimlé]], whereas those of evil men will live forever in Niflhel:
{{cquote|"The greatest of all is this: that he made man, and gave him the spirit, which shall live and never perish, though the flesh-frame rot to mould, or burn to ashes; and all men shall live, such as are just in action, and be with himself in the place called [[Gimlé]]. But evil men go to [[Hel (realm)|Hel]] and thence down to the Misty Hel; and that is down in the ninth world."&lt;ref&gt;Section III of ''[[Gylfaginning]]'', in translation by [[Arthur G. Brodeur]] (1916, 1923), [https://books.google.com/books?id=_T1cAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=thence+down+to+the+Misty+Hel#v=snippet&amp;q=thence%20down%20to%20the%20Misty%20Hel&amp;f=false p. 16] at Google Books.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Poetic Edda==
===''Vafþrúðnismál''===
In ''Vafþrúðnismál'', Odin has wagered his head in a contest of wits with the giant ([[Jötunn|jotun]]) [[Vafþrúðnir]]. Odin asks Vafþrúðnir whether he can tell all the secrets of the gods and giants, and Vafþrúðnir answers that he can do so since he has been to all the [[Norse cosmology|nine worlds]], including Niflhel:
{|
|
:Vafþrúðnir kvað:
:43. "Frá jötna rúnum
:ok allra goða
:ek kann segja satt,
:því at hvern hef ek
:heim of komit;
:níu kom ek heima
:fyr Niflhel neðan;
:hinig deyja ór helju halir."&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.heimskringla.no/original/edda/vafthrudnesmal.php Vafþrúðnismál]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}'' at Norrøne Tekster og Kvad, Norway.&lt;/ref&gt;
|
:Vafthruthnir spake:
:43. "Of the runes of the gods
:and the giants' race
:The truth indeed can I tell,
:(For to every world have I won;)
:To nine worlds came I,
:to Niflhel beneath,

|
|}
===''Baldrs draumar''===
Though not a part of the [[Codex Regius]], in the poem ''Baldrs draumar'', Odin makes a visit to Niflhel himself in order to enquire about the bad dreams of his son [[Baldr]]:
{|
|
:Upp reis Óðinn,
:alda gautr,
:ok hann á Sleipni
:söðul of lagði;
:reið hann niðr þaðan

|
:2. Then Othin rose,
:the enchanter old,
:And the saddle he laid
:on Sleipnir's back;
:Thence rode he down
:to Niflhel deep,
:And [[Garmr|the hound]] he met

The '''MIT Open Agriculture Initiative (OpenAg)''' was founded in 2015 by Caleb Harper as an initiative of the [[MIT Media Lab]] at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/innovations/wp/2015/06/17/inside-an-mit-researchers-grand-plan-to-create-the-personal-food-computer/|title=Inside an MIT researcher’s grand plan to create the personal food computer|author=Matt McFarland|date=17 June 2015|work=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The project aims to develop [[controlled-environment agriculture]] platforms called "Food Computers" that operate on a variety of scales, and which can be used for experimental, educational, or personal use.  All of the hardware, software, and data will be [[open source]], with the intention of creating a standardized [[open platform]] for agricultural research and experimentation.&lt;ref name="MLL"&gt;[https://www.media.mit.edu/special/groups/open-ag Open Agriculture (OpenAg) | MIT Media Lab&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

OpenAg advocates pursue transparency in the agricultural industry, and promote sustainable, local growing practices. Much of their focus is on enhancing urban agriculture and improving access to fresh, healthy foods.&lt;ref name="OAG"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://openag.media.mit.edu/|title=OpenAg Initiative — Farming for the Future|work=mit.edu|accessdate=2016-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Food Computer ==
The Open Agriculture Initiative coined the term "Food Computer" to describe their main product. Originally developed under the MIT CityFARM project,&lt;ref name="MLL" /&gt; the Food Computer is [[controlled-environment agriculture]] platform that utilizes soilless agriculture technologies including [[hydroponic]] and [[aeroponic]] systems to grow crops indoors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.techtimes.com/articles/65692/20150702/personal-food-comuter-farm-apartment.htm The Personal Food Computer Is A Farm For Your Apartment : SCIENCE : Tech Times&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2015/11/05/food-computer-set-to-alleviate-global-food-crisis-using-climate-recipes_n_8479334.html Food Computer Set To Alleviate Global Food Crisis Using 'Climate Recipes'&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The Food Computer also utilizes an array of sensors that monitor the internal climate within a specialized growing chamber and adjust it accordingly so that  the environmental conditions remain consistent and optimum.&lt;ref name="smith"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/what-is-a-personal-food-computer-180956085/?no-ist|title=What Is a Personal Food Computer?|author=Heather Hansman|work=Smithsonian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The climate inside of a growing chamber can be tightly controlled and used as a tool to enhance food production or quality.&lt;ref&gt;[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FbjTR1S1ABao0pWDlyY2BCynObDPtL21M9ayRiohpV8/edit Google Docs &lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The data on the climate conditions during a given harvest cycle can be logged online as a "climate recipe", and the [[phenotype|phenotypic]] expressions (observable characteristics) of the plant can also be monitored and recorded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2015/11/05/food-computer-set-to-alleviate-global-food-crisis-using-climate-recipes_n_8479334.html|title=Food Computer Set To Alleviate Global Food Crisis Using 'Climate Recipes'|work=The Huffington Post UK|accessdate=2016-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; These recipes are recorded in an online database that will be openly accessible so that climate conditions can be downloaded by other users around the globe.&lt;ref name="OAG"/&gt;

The term Food Computer can apply generally to any of the Open Agriculture Initiative’s controlled-environment systems, or specifically to the smallest model, which is also called a Personal Food Computer.&lt;ref&gt;http://openag.media.mit.edu/hardware/|title=Food Computers&lt;/ref&gt; The tabletop-sized unit is intended for use in homes, classrooms, and small-scale experimental facilities.&lt;ref name="Food Computers"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://openag.media.mit.edu/hardware/|title=Food Computers|work=mit.edu|accessdate=2016-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mid-sized model, or Food Server, is the size of an internationally standardized [[Intermodal container|shipping container]], and utilizes [[vertical farming]] structures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.popsci.com/wikipedia-farming-is-here The Wikipedia Of Farming Is Here | Popular Science&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; It is intended for use in cafeterias, restaurants, local grocers, and large-scale experimental facilities. The largest version of the Food Computer will be warehouse-sized Food Data Centers that will function on the level of industrial crop production.&lt;ref name="smith"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Food Computers"/&gt;

Food Computers are not yet commercially available. {{as of|2016}}, there are six prototype Personal Food Computers operating in schools around the Boston area, and three Food Servers operating at MIT, [[Michigan State University]], and [[Cinvestav|Unidad Guadalajara (Cinvestav)]] in Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;[http://on.aol.com/shows/now-what-with-ryan-duffy-shw113 Now What With Ryan Duffy - AOL On&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Build directions and schematics are available for makers and hobbyists,&lt;ref name="oagbuild" /&gt; while more-widespread availability is expected once manufacturing begins in coming years.&lt;ref name="oagbuild"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://openag.media.mit.edu/build/|title=Build|work=mit.edu|accessdate=2016-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Open Phenome Library ==
Various climate conditions including temperature, [[relative humidity]], [[carbon dioxide]] and [[oxygen]] levels, [[pH]] of water, [[electrical conductivity]] of water, and exposure to various nutrients, fertilizers and chemicals determine whether a plant grows and also how it grows.&lt;ref&gt;[https://extension.illinois.edu/gpe/case1/c1facts3a.html Great Plant Escape - Growing plants indoors&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Different climate conditions can lead to different phenotypic expressions in plants that are [[genotype|genotypically]] very similar or identical. The various traits that a plant expresses, including color, size, texture, yield, growth rate, flavor, and nutrient density, make up its [[phenome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/genotype-phenotype/|title=The Genotype/Phenotype Distinction|work=stanford.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; OpenAg aims to [[Crowd-sourced science|crowd source]] this research and create an [[open library]] of phenome data that relates external climate conditions to specific phenotypic expressions in various plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popsci.com/wikipedia-farming-is-here|title=The Wikipedia Of Farming Is Here|work=Popular Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=7310847&amp;filter%3DAND%28p_IS_Number%3A7310795%29]{{dead link|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Affiliations and funding ==
The Open Agriculture Initiative is primarily funded through the [[MIT Media Lab]], which is almost 100% industrially funded through corporate memberships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.media.mit.edu/sponsorship/funding-levels/corporate-research-partner|title=Corporate Research Partner - MIT Media Lab|work=mit.edu|access-date=2015-11-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222131115/https://www.media.mit.edu/sponsorship/funding-levels/corporate-research-partner#|archive-date=2015-12-22|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.media.mit.edu/sponsorship/sponsor-list Sponsor List | MIT Media Lab&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The Open Agriculture Initiative has also received specific endorsements from members such as [[IDEO]], [[Lee Kum Kee]], [[Target Corporation|Target]], [[Unilever]], and Welspun.&lt;ref name="Team"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://openag.media.mit.edu/team/|title=Team|work=mit.edu|accessdate=2016-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; OpenAg has also received additional investments and philanthropic contributions from companies and institutions unaffiliated with the Media Lab.&lt;ref name="Team"/&gt;

[[File:Triglav Oryctographia Carniolica 1778.jpg|thumb|Triglav and the [[Velo Polje|Velo Polje Alp]], ''Oryctographia Carniolica'', 1778]]
'''''Oryctographia Carniolica''''' (with the subtitle {{lang|de|physikalische Beschreibung des Herzogthums Krain, Istrien und zum Theil der benachbarten Länder}}) is a four-volume work by [[Belsazar Hacquet]], published in [[Leipzig]] in 1778, 1781, 1784 and 1789. It discusses the physical properties of the [[Duchy of Carniola]], [[Istria]] and parts of the neighbouring lands. It also includes an in-depth description of the [[Idrija mercury mine]].

The front page of the work presents the first known depiction of [[Triglav]], the highest mountain in [[Slovenia]]. The copper engraving was produced by C. Conti after a drawing by Franz Xaver Baraga.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.gore-ljudje.net/novosti/44870/ |title=Zgodovina slovenskega planinstva |newspaper=Gore-ljudje |date=2 April 2009 |first=Franci |last=Savenc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Plazes AG''' was a Berlin, Germany-based [[geosocial networking]] site.  Plazes allowed users to post their location and current activities and share this information with other Plazes users via computers or mobile telephones.  On 23 June 2008, [[Nokia Corporation]] announced plans to acquire Plazes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dealbook |url=http://dealbook.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/06/23/nokia-to-buy-germanys-plazes-in-social-network-push |title=Nokia to Buy Germany's Plazes in Social-Network Push |publisher=Dealbook.blogs.nytimes.com |date=23 June 2008 |accessdate=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plazes was subsequently integrated to Nokia Maps which itself was integrated to HERE Maps.

== History ==
Plazes AG introduced the beta version of the Plazes service on 16 August 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.plazes.com/?p=17 |title=Umbelíco Networks - ka4.net.umbelico.com |publisher=Blog.plazes.com |accessdate=21 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723054549/http://blog.plazes.com/?p=17 |archivedate=23 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The service was continually updated and began to attract attention on technology blogs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2005/06/11/plazes-gets-traction-at-reboot-70/ |title=Plazes Profile |publisher=TechCrunch |date=11 June 2005 |accessdate=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lockergnome.com/search/2005/09/30/plazes/ |title=Plazes ~ LockerGnome Search Engineer |publisher=Lockergnome.com |date=30 September 2005 |accessdate=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In October 2004, Plazes introduced two [[Application programming interface|APIs]]: a Web-based API that advised users of the current location of other Plazes users; and a launcher API that allowed users to create their own Plazes launchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.plazes.com/?p=37 |title=Umbelíco Networks - ka4.net.umbelico.com |publisher=Blog.plazes.com |accessdate=21 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723054613/http://blog.plazes.com/?p=37 |archivedate=23 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In January 2005, Plazes introduced a [[Movable Type]] plugin that allowed users to automatically include or add their location to blog postings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Kellner |first=Stefan |url=http://plugins.movabletype.org/plazes-plugin/ |title=Plazes Plugin &amp;#124; MovableType.org – Home of the MT Community |publisher=Plugins.movabletype.org |accessdate=21 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111226230657/http://plugins.movabletype.org/plazes-plugin/ |archivedate=26 December 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In June 2005, Plazes created an API that allowed users to access photos from their [[Flickr]] accounts and to add those photos to their Plazes accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.plazes.com/?p=56 |title=Umbelíco Networks - ka4.net.umbelico.com |publisher=Blog.plazes.com |accessdate=21 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723054617/http://blog.plazes.com/?p=56 |archivedate=23 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A Flickr group of Plazes users quickly sprang up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/groups/plazes/ |title=plazes |publisher=Flickr |accessdate=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2006, Plazes was awarded the LeadAward in Bronze in the Category “WebLeader 2006″.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leadacademy.de/2006/index.html |title=Lead Award |publisher=Leadacademy.de |accessdate=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable features==

===Web interface===
[[Image:Plazes Radar.JPG|thumb|right|Plazes Radar Web Interface.]]
The Plazes Web interface allows users to post a location, the time of day they will be at the location and the activity they will be engaged in at the location.  This information can be shared with people selected by the user, Plazes contacts or all members of the Plazes community.  In addition to the Web interface, users can update their location using Plazer (see below), via [[text message]] or via [http://m.plazes.com/ m.plazes.com], the mobile Plazes Web site.  Plazes users are able to publish their Plazes location on [[Fire Eagle]], Twitter, [[Google Maps]], MySpace and on the user's blog.

The Web interface allows users to invite others to join Plazes.  Plazes can search a user's [[Gmail]], [[Yahoo]] or [[Hotmail]] or [[Microsoft Outlook]] contacts and send invitations to these contacts.

Plazes allows users to create groups or to join an existing group of Plazes users.  Under the Groups tab, Plazes suggests groups that the user may wish to join, as well as offer the user the opportunity to search for existing groups.  If the user wants to create a group, the user will need to select a group name and a draft a brief description of the group.  The user may add an image to the group to help differentiate it from other groups.

Plazes has a radar function that allows users to discover other Plazes users that are located near the user's current location.  The Plazes Radar generates a list of the locations close to the user's current location and lists the number of Plazes users that have previously stated they were at that location.  When the user clicks on the location name, information about the user that was at that location is displayed along with a description of the user's activity at the location.

===Plazes Launcher/Plazer===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Plazer Screen Shot.JPG|thumb|right|Image of the Plazer Launcher.]] --&gt;

The Plazes Launcher was a client application that allowed Plazes users to update their location and current activities without having to log onto plazes.com. The launcher would detect the [[MAC address]] of the user's current router, and query the Plazes database to see if the router already had a "plaze" associated with it. If no existing plaze was found, the user would be prompted to enter details about the plaze, including a name and its physical location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://xn.pinkhamster.net/blog/tech/plazes.html |title=Plazes |publisher=xn.pinkhamster.net |accessdate=8 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2006, the Plazes Launcher was rebranded as '''Plazer'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.plazes.com/?p=96 |title=Umbelíco Networks - ka4.net.umbelico.com |publisher=Blog.plazes.com |accessdate=21 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723060213/http://blog.plazes.com/?p=96 |archivedate=23 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Plazer is integrated with Skype; Skype users are able to publish their location on Skype via Plazer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.plazes.com/?p=97 |title=Umbelíco Networks - ka4.net.umbelico.com |publisher=Blog.plazes.com |accessdate=21 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723060254/http://blog.plazes.com/?p=97 |archivedate=23 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Plazer is available for Windows, Mac OS X, iPhone and iPod touch, and Symbian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnet.com/1770-5_1-0.html?query=Plazes&amp;tag=srch |title=Plazes |publisher=CNET |accessdate=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=manu contreras Manu Contreras+ Add Contact |url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/mc/339695217/ |title=Plazes for Symbian &amp;#124; Flickr – Photo Sharing! |publisher=Flickr |accessdate=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was also a third-party Plazer available for Nokia's [[Maemo]] devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://maemo.org/downloads/product/OS2007/maemoplazer/ |title=Downloads: Maemo Plazer |publisher=maemo.org |accessdate=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Acquisition by Nokia==
In August 2007, Nokia announced that it was moving into the services field with the introduction of [[Ovi (Nokia)|Ovi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nokia.com/press/press-releases/showpressrelease?newsid=1149749 |title=Press Release &amp;#124; Nokia – Press |publisher=Nokia |accessdate=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nokia Maps became part of the Ovi service offering.  On 23 June 2008, Nokia Corporation announced plans to acquire Plazes.  As part of the acquisition, Plazes gained access to the millions of users that own a Nokia device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.plazes.com/?p=242 |title=Umbelíco Networks - ka4.net.umbelico.com |publisher=Blog.plazes.com |accessdate=21 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111110115501/http://blog.plazes.com/?p=242 |archivedate=10 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the same time, Nokia gained technology and a research team that was on the cutting edge of the [[geosocial networking]] trend.&lt;ref name="nokia1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nokia.com/press/press-releases/showpressrelease?newsid=1229894 |title=Press Release &amp;#124; Nokia – Press |publisher=Nokia |accessdate=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The acquisition closed on 15 July 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.plazes.com/?p=253 |title=Umbelíco Networks - ka4.net.umbelico.com |publisher=Blog.plazes.com |accessdate=21 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723060645/http://blog.plazes.com/?p=253 |archivedate=23 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Post acquisition, Plazes became part of Nokia's Services business unit.&lt;ref name="nokia1"/&gt;

==Closure==
On 4 May 2012 the Plazes team sent an email message for their users informing that on the next week will go out of service. Users could export their Plazes history to Nokia Maps which itself was integrated to HERE Maps.

'''Pleaching''' or plashing is a technique of interweaving living and dead branches through a [[Hedge (barrier)|hedge]] for stock control. Trees are planted in lines, the branches are woven together to strengthen and fill any weak spots until the hedge thickens.&lt;ref&gt;The Complete Guide to Pruning and Training Plants, Joyce and Brickell, 1992, page 106, Simon and Schuster&lt;/ref&gt; Branches in close contact may grow together, due to a natural phenomenon called [[inosculation]], a natural graft. Pleach also means weaving of thin, whippy stems of trees to form a basketry effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[Image:Arley Hall Lime Walk - geograph.org.uk - 530409.jpg|[[Allée]] of pleached [[Tilia|lime]] trees at [[Arley Hall]]|thumb]]
Pleaching or plashing (an early synonym)&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary''&lt;/ref&gt; was common in gardens from late medieval times to the early eighteenth century, to create shaded paths, or to create a living fence out of trees or shrubs. This craft had been developed by European farmers who used it to make their hedge rows more secure.&lt;ref name = Trees&gt;{{cite book  | last = Mentgen | first = Glen A. | title =  GROW ON TREES The Complete Guide to Starting Your Own Profitable Tree Farm Includes Production, Maintenance and Marketing. | publisher = TLC Publishing | series =  | volume =  | edition =  | date = 2000 | location =   United States of America. | pages = 120 | url =  | isbn = 1-929709-03-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;   [[Julius Caesar]] (circa 60 B.C.) states that the Gallic tribe of [[Nervii]] used plashing to create defensive barriers against cavalry.&lt;ref name = Roman&gt;

In [[hedge laying]], this technique can be used to improve or renew a [[quickset hedge]] to form a thick, impenetrable barrier suitable for enclosing animals. It keeps the lower parts of a hedge thick and dense, and was traditionally done every few years.&lt;ref&gt;''The booke of husbandry'', John Fitzherbert. London, 1573&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The second book of the English husbandman'', Gervase Markham. London , 1614, Part II, ch. VI. Of Plashing of Hedges&lt;/ref&gt;
The stems of hedging plants are slashed through to the centre or more, then bent over and interwoven. The plants rapidly regrow, forming a dense barrier along its entire length.

In garden design, the same technique has produced elaborate structures,&lt;ref name=Fischbacher&gt;{{Citation |first=Thomas |last=Fischbacher |title=Botanical Engineering |url=http://www.soton.ac.uk/~doctom/talks/botanical-engineering.pdf |accessdate= |year=2007 |publisher=School of Engineering Sciences, University of Southampton}}&lt;/ref&gt; neatly shaded walks and [[allée]]s.  This was not much seen in the American colonies, where a labor-intensive aesthetic has not been a feature of gardening: "Because of the time needed in caring for pleached [[Avenue (landscape)|allée]]s," Donald Wyman noted,&lt;ref&gt;''Wyman's Gardening Encyclopedia'' 1971: "Pleach".&lt;/ref&gt; "they are but infrequently seen in American gardens, but are frequently observed in Europe."

After the second quarter of the eighteenth century, the technique withdrew to the kitchen garden, and the word dropped out of English usage, until [[Sir Walter Scott]] reintroduced it for local colour, in ''The Fortunes of Nigel'' (1822).&lt;ref&gt;''The Fortunes of Nigel'', ch. x, noted by Paul Roberts, 'Sir Walter Scott's Contributions to the English Vocabulary" ''[[Publications of the Modern Language Association|PMLA]]'' '''68'''.1 (March 1953, pp. 189-210) p 196.&lt;/ref&gt; After the middle of the nineteenth century, English landowners were once again planting avenues, often shading the sweeping curves of a drive, but sometimes straight allées of pleached limes, as Rowland Egerton's at [[Arley Hall]], Cheshire, which survive in splendidly controlled form.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Foster, "The History of the Gardens at Arley Hall, Cheshire" ''Garden History'' '''24'''.2 (Winter 1996), pp. 255-271. p 265 and 266:fig 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'', Antonio reports (I.ii.8ff) that the Prince and Count Claudio were "walking in a thick pleached alley in my orchard." A modern version of such free-standing pleached fruit trees is sometimes called a "Belgian fence": young fruit trees pruned to four or six wide Y-shaped crotches, in the candelabra-form [[espalier]] called a ''palmette verrier'', are planted at close intervals, about two metres apart, and their branches are bound together to makes a diagonal lattice,&lt;ref&gt;[[Eleanor Perenyi]], ''Green Thoughts: A Writer in the Garden'' (New York) 1981 pp 24-25.&lt;/ref&gt; a regimen of severe seasonal [[pruning]]; lashing of young growth to straight sticks and binding the joints repeat the pattern.

Smooth-barked trees such as [[Tilia|limewood or linden]] trees, or [[hornbeam]]s were most often used in pleaching. A sunken [[parterre]] surrounded on three sides by pleached allées of [[laburnum]] is a feature of the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew|Queen's Garden, Kew]], laid out in 1969 to complement the seventeenth-century Anglo-Dutch architecture of [[Kew Palace]].&lt;ref&gt;Quarterly Newsletter (Garden History Society)  No. 10  (Summer 1969), pp. 8-10.&lt;/ref&gt; A pleached [[hornbeam]] hedge about three meters high is a feature of the replanted town garden at [[Rubens House]], Antwerp, recreated from Rubens' painting ''The Walk in the Garden'' and from seventeenth-century engravings.&lt;ref&gt;Anne Kendal, "The Garden of Rubens House, Antwerp"''Garden History'' '''5'''.2 (Summer 1977, pp 27-29), p.28.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the gardens of [[André Le Nôtre]] and his followers, pleaching kept the vistas of straight rides through woodland cleanly bordered. At [[Studley Royal]], Yorkshire, the avenues began to be pleached once again, as an experiment in restoration, in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;Ken Lemmon, "Restoration Work at Studley Royal" ''Garden History'' '''1'''.1 (September 1972, pp. 22-23) p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;small&gt;'''Navy Cross'''&lt;/small&gt;
|}
Puerto Ricans have served as members of the [[United States Armed Forces]] and have fought in every major conflict in which the United States has been involved from World War I onward. Many Puerto Ricans, including those of Puerto Rican descent, have distinguished themselves during combat as members of the five branches of the U.S. Military, the [[United States Army|Army]], [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]], [[United States Navy|Navy]], [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] and the [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]].

Nine Puerto Ricans have been awarded the United States' highest military decoration — the [[Puerto Rican recipients of the Medal of Honor|Medal of Honor]], seven have been awarded the Navy Cross and eighteen have been awarded the [[Puerto Rican recipients of the Distinguished Service Cross|Distinguished Service Cross]] (four of which were upgraded to the Medal of Honor on March 18, 2014.).&lt;ref&gt;[http://elboricua.com/MedalHonor.html Puerto Rican Medal of Honor recipients]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Navy Cross is the second highest medal that can be awarded by the U.S. Navy and are awarded to members of the U.S. Navy or U.S. Marine Corps for heroism or distinguished service. The following is a list of the seven Puerto Ricans awarded the Navy Cross with their citations. On August 2, 1917 Lieutenant Frederick L. Riefkohl of the US Navy became the first known Puerto Rican to be awarded the Navy Cross.

The Navy Cross is presented to Rafel Toro, Private, U.S. Marine Corps, for extraordinary heroism in battle when on the occasion of an engagement at San Fernando, Nicaragua, 25 July 1927, during an insurrection in that country, while performing advance guard duty in an important expedition into Nueva Segovia, Private Toro, accompanying his commanding officer, rode ahead into the town and on being attacked, fearlessly proceeded against tremendous odds, returning the fire, and at the risk of his own life materially assisted in holding the enemy in check until the arrival of reinforcements. Although receiving wounds at this time, which later resulted in his death, Private Toro continued in the fight to the last displaying that type of grit, determination and courage which characterizes conduct above and beyond the call of duty.

[[File:Ramón Núñez-Juárez.jpg|100px|center]]
'''[[Ramón Núñez-Juárez|PFC. Ramón Núñez-Juárez]]*''' (October 6, 1932 – September 8, 1952), born in [[San Sebastián, Puerto Rico]] was a member of the [[United States Marine Corps]]. He was listed as [[Missing in Action]] during the [[Korean War]] and was posthumously awarded the Navy Cross.

''&lt;center&gt;Citation:&lt;/center&gt;''

The Navy Cross is presented to Ramon Nunez-Juarez (1240152), Private First Class, U.S. Marine Corps, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations against an armed enemy of the United Nations while serving as an Automatic Rifleman of Company E, Second Battalion, First Marines, First Marine Division (Reinforced), in action against enemy aggressor forces in the Republic of Korea on 9 August 1952. With his squad's position on a vitally important hill encircled and attacked from three sides by a numerically superior enemy force following an intense hostile artillery and mortar barrage, Private First Class Nunez- Juarez fearlessly remained in his forward position and delivered effective rifle fire which greatly aided in halting the attackers. When his supply of ammunition was expended, he unhesitatingly left his fighting position and crawled down the slope to acquire a re-supply from one of his comrades. Unable to return to his original position, he quickly set up his weapon at an alternate point near the crest of the hill and continued to deliver devastating fire upon the enemy. Aware that his squad was unable to evacuate its casualties without covering fire, he gallantly held his commanding ground when the order to withdraw was given and poured accurate fire on the hostile force to enable his unit to withdraw to a safe position. By his indomitable fighting spirit, courageous initiative and resolute determination in the face of overwhelming odds, Private First Class Nunez-Juarez served to inspire all who observed him and contributed in large measure to the successful withdrawal of his entire squad. His great personal valor reflects the highest credit upon himself and enhances the finest traditions of the United States Naval Service.

The Navy Cross is presented to Enrique Romero-Nieves (1240226), Private First Class, U.S. Marine Corps, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations against an armed enemy of the United Nations while serving as a Squad Leader of Company A, First Battalion, Seventh Marines, First Marine Division (Reinforced), in action against enemy aggressor forces in the Republic of Korea on 26 October 1952. When both the platoon commander and sergeant were wounded and evacuated during his platoon's night counterattack against a bitterly defended hill mass which had been overrun by the enemy a few hours before, Private First Class Romero-Nieves unhesitatingly continued the attack in the face of intense artillery, mortar, automatic-weapons and grenade fire and skillfully directed the emplacement of a machine gun within seventy-five yards of the hostile position to increase the volume of covering and supporting fire fore the final assault on an enemy bunker. Armed only with hand grenades, he single-handedly charged the bunker and, although knocked down and painfully wounded by an enemy grenade, which rendered his left arm useless, quickly regained his feet and again stormed the bunker. Unable to pull the bin of a grenade with his wounded left hand, he coolly extracted the pin by hooking it in his belt buckle and hurled the deadly missile into the bunker, killing six of the enemy and enabling his comrades to continue in the assault. His intrepid fighting spirit, resolute determination and courageous initiative were contributing factors in the recapture of the platoon's objective and reflect the highest credit upon Private First Class Romero-Nieves and the United States Naval Service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.homeofheroes.com/valor/1_Citations/05_korea-nc/nc_08korea_usmcMZ.html#M Romero-Nieves' Navy Cross citation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929090437/http://www.homeofheroes.com/valor/1_Citations/05_korea-nc/nc_08korea_usmcMZ.html |date=2007-09-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''&lt;center&gt;Citation:&lt;/center&gt;''
The Navy Cross is presented to Angel Mendez, Sergeant, U.S. Marine Corps, for extraordinary heroism while serving as the Platoon Guide of the Third Platoon, Company F, Second Battalion, Seventh Marines, First Marine Division (Reinforced), Fleet Marine Force, in the Republic of Vietnam on 16 March 1967. During Operation DE SOTO in Quang Ngai Province, Company F was conducting a search and destroy mission when the rear elements of the company were taken under intense 50-caliber machine gun and automatic weapons fire from an estimated hard-core Viet Cong battalion. One half of the Second Platoon was pinned-down in an open rice paddy and all attempts to relieve the pressure on the beleaguered Marines had proven futile. Sergeant (then Corporal) Mendez, unhesitatingly volunteered to lead a squad into the face of the devastating and extremely accurate machine gun fire to assist the pinned-down Marines in returning to friendly lines with their two dead and two seriously wounded. The Viet Cong fire increased to a fever pitch as Sergeant Mendez calmly and courageously moved out onto a paddy dike, completely exposed to the intense fire, and commenced firing his M-79 at the enemy positions with deadly accuracy. He fired round after round as he stood, bravely defying the enemy, to give covering fire to his comrades. Sixty meters across the rice paddy from Sergeant Mendez, his Platoon Commander was seriously wounded and he fell, unable to move. Immediately Sergeant Mendez raced through the hail of bullets to his Platoon Commander's side. Shielding him with his body as he applied a dressing to the wound, he picked up the Lieutenant and started to carry him to friendly lines, which were more than seventy-five meters away. Exhibiting exceptional courage he moved toward the lines as the Viet Cong attempted to hit this double target. Twenty meters short of his goal, he was hit in the shoulder and two of his comrades ran out to assist him. Even though painfully wounded, Sergeant Mendez chose to be the rear man, refusing to relinquish his hold on his Lieutenant's legs as they carried him toward the hedgerow. He was shielding his Lieutenant with his own body when he was mortally wounded. By his dauntless courage, initiative and selfless efforts in behalf of another, Sergeant Mendez saved his platoon commander's life and upheld the highest traditions of the Marine Corps and the United States Naval Service. He gallantly gave his life for his country.

''&lt;center&gt;Citation:&lt;/center&gt;''
The President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting the Navy Cross to Lance Corporal Jose L. Rivera (MCSN: 2447515), United States Marine Corps, for extraordinary heroism while serving as a Fire Team Leader with Company L, Third Battalion, Fifth Marines, FIRST Marine Division (Reinforced), Fleet Marine Force, in connection with combat operations against the enemy in the Republic of Vietnam. On the night of 26 March 1969, Lance Corporal Rivera and six other Marines from Company L were occupying a listening post approximately 100 yards forward of the company perimeter in Quang Nam Province. Suddenly, the Marines came under a heavy ground attack by a numerically superior enemy force. Lance Corporal Rivera was attempting to alert the company by radio when a hostile hand grenade landed in his position. Without hesitation, he covered the grenade with his helmet and two protective vests and, shouting a warning to his comrades, smothered the explosion with his own body. Although suffering from multiple fragmentation wounds, he ignored his painful injuries and commenced delivering accurate fire at the assaulting enemy, resolutely refusing to leave his position until his comrades had reached friendly lines. His heroic and timely actions and sincere concern for the welfare of his fellowmen inspired all who observed him and were instrumental in saving the lives of several Marines. By his courage, aggressive determination and unswerving devotion to duty in the face of extreme personal danger, Lance Corporal Rivera contributed significantly to the subsequent defeat of the enemy force and upheld the highest traditions of the Marine Corps and of the United States Naval Service.

''&lt;center&gt;Citation:&lt;/center&gt;''
The President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting the Navy Cross to Corporal Miguel A. Rivera-Sotomayor (MCSN: 2174861), United States Marine Corps, for extraordinary heroism while serving as a Grenadier with Company F, Second Battalion, Ninth Marines, THIRD Marine Division (Reinforced), Fleet Marine Force, in Quang Tri Province, Republic of Vietnam, on 29 July 1967. While moving in a battalion-sized operation in connection with Operation KINGFISHER, the entire battalion was attacked by a large element of the North Vietnamese army and began receiving a heavy barrage of mortar, rocket and automatic weapons fire. The Third Platoon of Company F, called to the front of the battle, was pinned down in a heavy cross fire from enemy machine guns. Receiving a call, for his support, Corporal Rivera-Sotomayor responded immediately, though he had been painfully wounded in the arm by shrapnel earlier in the battle. Rushing out into the direct line of enemy fire, with utter disregard for his own safety, he fired his complete supply of ammunition. His firing was so effective that it completely silenced the enemy machine guns and allowed his platoon to move from its pinned down position to establish an effective base of fire against the enemy. With his ammunition expended, Corporal Rivera-Sotomayor observed a machine-gun team whose members were too seriously wounded to fire their gun. Running across the opening in which he was standing, through intensifying enemy automatic rifle fire, he quickly loaded it and again, with no thought of his intense pain or severe wound, stood up with the gun and fired several rounds. Observing that the enemy was shifting positions, he grabbed a rifle and struggling into the open from his covered position, he fired a complete magazine of ammunition. Returning as quickly as possible for another magazine, he had to be restrained by a Corpsman from going out again. By his daring actions and loyal devotion to duty in the face of personal risk, Corporal Rivera-Sotomayor upheld the highest traditions of the Marine Corps and the United States Naval Service.

{{About|the Romanian historical term|other uses|Raya (disambiguation){{!}}Raya}}
{{State organisation of Ottoman Empire}}
'''Raya''' or '''Raia''' is a term used in [[Romania]]n historiography to refer to former territories of the mediaeval principalities of [[Wallachia]] and [[Moldavia]] held under the direct administration of the [[Ottoman Empire]], as opposed to the principalities, which kept their internal autonomy under Ottoman [[suzerainty]]. The term originated from [[rayah]], a generic name for the non-Muslim subjects of the Ottoman Empire.&lt;ref&gt;[[Romanian Academy]]. ''Istoria Românilor: De la universalitatea creştinǎ cǎtre Europa "patriilor"''. Editura Enciclopedică, 2001. pp. 571-572 &lt;/ref&gt;  Though mainly populated by Christian [[population]]s, a raya was ruled according to Ottoman law.&lt;ref&gt;Lazăr Şeineanu - ''Dicţionarul limbii române''. 1929&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''raia'' consisted of an important fortress and its hinterland, which generally formed a [[qadaa|kaza]] in the Ottoman administrative system. In Wallachia, the ''raia'' were located on the northern bank of the [[Danube]], around the fortresses of [[Turnu Măgurele]], [[Giurgiu]] and [[Brăila]], while in Moldavia they were situated on the eastern border, around the fortresses of [[Kiliya, Ukraine|Kiliya]], [[Akkerman]], [[Bender, Moldova|Bender]] and [[Khotin]].  The territories in Wallachia were transferred back to the latter in 1829 by the [[Treaty of Adrianople (1829)|Treaty of Adrianople]].

'''Robert John Nettleton Devoy''' is an Irish geographer. He is an Emeritus Professor of Geography at [[University College Cork]] and was formerly a Lead Member of the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]].

==Education==

Devoy studied at [[Durham University]], graduating with a [[2:1]] degree in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Durham University gazette, XX (ns), supplement |url=http://reed.dur.ac.uk/xtf/view?docId=bookreader/DU_Gazettes/DUGazette20_3/dg203METS.xml#page/12/mode/2up |website=reed.dur.ac.uk |accessdate=13 August 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Devoy's doctoral work, an analysis of sea-level changes and land subsidence on the [[Thames Estuary]], was completed at [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]] in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Biography - Robert Devoy |url=http://research.ucc.ie/profiles/A010/rdevoy |website=UCC |accessdate=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; His research interests lie primarily in [[coastal geography|coastal science]], including contemporary coastal processes and [[coastal management]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Robert Devoy - MaREI |url=http://www.marei.ie/people/robert-devoy/ |website=MaREI |accessdate=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career and Research==

Devoy moved to Cork to continue his research after graduating from Cambridge. In conjunction with his activities in Ireland he went on to hold a number of international appointments. In 1984 he was a Visiting Researcher at the [[University of Delaware]] and subsequently served as a Visiting Research Fellow in [[Geomorphology]] at the [[Australian National University]] in 1987, and as a Research Fellow at the [[University of Sydney]] in 1990 and again from 1992-1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Biography - Robert Devoy |url=http://research.ucc.ie/profiles/A010/rdevoy |website=UCC |accessdate=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1992 he was the founding director of the Coastal and Marine Research Centre (CMRC) at University College Cork, working there until 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Biography - Robert Devoy |url=http://research.ucc.ie/profiles/A010/rdevoy |website=UCC |accessdate=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently Devoy has concentrated on researching the implications of [[climate change]] on [[coastal erosion]] and water dynamics. He was a Lead Author on the [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report|4th IPCC Assessment Report]], which led to the IPCC being awarded the [[2007 Nobel Peace Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Robert Devoy - MaREI |url=http://www.marei.ie/people/robert-devoy/ |website=MaREI |accessdate=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to serve as a Reviewer for the [[IPCC Fifth Assessment Report|5th Report]] published in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Robert Devoy - MaREI |url=http://www.marei.ie/people/robert-devoy/ |website=MaREI |accessdate=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 he suggested it would cost at least €5bn to properly protect Ireland's largest cities and critical areas of the coastline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Irish warned of doomsday sea levels if climate change continues |url=https://www.irishcentral.com/news/irish-warned-of-doomsday-sea-levels-if-climate-change-continues |website=IrishCentral.com |accessdate=13 August 2018 |language=en |date=10 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2 years later he publicly criticized Cork [[flood control|flood defense]] plans, accusing the proposed scheme of being too reliant on an outdated study and not taking the threat of [[tidal flooding]] seriously enough.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=OPW engineer defends Cork flood defence plan amid criticism |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/opw-engineer-defends-cork-flood-defence-plan-amid-criticism-1.3124368 |website=The Irish Times |accessdate=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Scandinavian Montane Birch forests and grasslands ecoregion''', a [[Palearctic]] [[ecoregion]] of the [[Alpine tundra]] and [[Boreal forest]] [[Biome]]s, located in [[Norway]], [[Sweden]], and [[Finland]].  It is one of the [[terrestrial ecoregion]]s determined and defined by the [[World Wildlife Fund]].&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|name=Scandinavian montane birch forest and grasslands|id=pa1110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conservation value ==
The Scandinavian Montane Birch forests and grasslands is one of the [[Global 200]] ecoregions, and is thus regarded as a high priority for conservation.

== Geography ==
[[File:Skjomtinden &amp; Kongsbakktinden from Bogen 2, 2010 September.JPG|thumb|left|There is a large span in environmental conditions from the [[fjord]]s to the mountains. Fall colors in the mid-boreal forest near the fjord while the [[Narvik]] mountains reach up to high alpine tundra; [[Northern Norway]].]]
[[Image:Kungsleden near Alesjaure Hut.jpg|thumb|right|Alpine tundra near [[Alesjaure]], northern Sweden]]
The ecoregion follows the [[Scandinavian Mountains]], and spans 11 degrees of latitude from the south to the north. Abouth two-thirds of the ecoregion are located in [[Norway]], about one-third in [[Sweden]] and a small area touches the northwesternmost part of [[Finland]]. This is a varied ecoregion, 1,600&amp;nbsp;km long, with a total area of approximately 243 000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (slightly larger than Great Britain).&lt;ref&gt;{{NatGeo ecoregion|id=pa1110|name=Scandinavian Montane Birch forests and grasslands}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest [[glacier]]s on the European mainland are located here ([[Jostedalsbreen]], [[Svartisen]]), as are [[Northern Europe]]'s highest mountains ([[Jotunheimen]]) and largest mountain plateau. The mountain chain itself creates a [[rain shadow]], and the eastern part of the mountain chain is considerably drier than the western part.
The ecoregion is divided in two parts, the southern part is in Norway's central mountains and goes down to the western fjords. The northern part follows the Kjølen mountains, and also goes down to the fjords in the west. The western part of the ecoregion, both in the south and north, borders on the [[Scandinavian coastal conifer forests]] ecoregion or directly on the fjords ([[Norwegian Sea]] and [[North Sea]]). The eastern part of the ecoregion, both in the south and the north, borders on the [[Scandinavian and Russian taiga]] ecoregion. In the far south it meets the [[Sarmatic mixed forest]] ecoregion, while the extreme northeasternmost part near the [[Barents Sea]] bordes on the [[Kola peninsula tundra]] ecoregion.

== Habitats ==
[[File:Sjurfjellet.jpg|thumb|left|Winter is long and snowmelt is late at the [[treeline]], [[Junkerdal National Park|Junkerdal]], Norway.]]
[[File:Betula pubescens Ljungdalen August 2011.jpg|thumb|right|Mountain birch near the treeline in [[Ljungdalen]], Sweden]]
Parts of the ecoregion are located in smaller mountain areas surrounded by lower elevation [[biomes]], as is the case with coastal mountains in Norway.
At the highest altitude is high [[alpine tundra]] with very modest vegetation and bare rock, skree, snowfields and glaciers. At lower altitude is low alpine tundra with continuous plant cover; [[dwarf birch]] and [[willow]]s up to 1 m tall and grasslands, as well as numerous lakes and [[bog]]s. At still lower altitude is the adjacent montane birch zone with small (2–5 m) mountain downy birch (''Betula pubescens'') above the [[conifer]] [[tree line]]; some stunted [[Norway spruce|spruce]] and [[Scots pine|pine]], and many lakes and bogs. This part is regarded as part of the [[High boreal]] (sparse taiga) vegetation zone; birch forming the treeline is very rare outside Scandinavia (also in Iceland and the Kamtchatka peninsula).

At still lower elevations the forests become closed-canopy (mid-boreal, south-boreal), denser and taller (8–20 m, exceptionally 30 m) with more species including mature Scots pine and aspen. Sometimes much of the lowland forest near the fjords of [[Western Norway]] is also included as Norway spruce is mostly absent here (both Norway spruce and Sitka spruce are commonly planted for economic reasons). In these temperate forests are also species such as ''[[Quercus robur]]'', ''[[Fraxinus excelsior]]'', ''[[Taxus baccata]]'', [[holly]] and [[small-leaved linden]] in addition to pine, aspen and birch. There might thus be a very large span in environmental conditions within this ecoregion; from temperate forest near the fjords with a 6-month [[growing season]] to the highest mountains with glaciers and snowfields not melting until mid-summer.

== Flora and fauna ==
[[Image:Fjällväxter - Norwegian hills near Sweden.jpg|thumb|left|Some typical plants on the low alpine tundra in autumn]]
[[Image:ArcticFoxSummer.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Arctic fox]] is the most threatened [[mammal]] in the ecoregion.]]
'''[[Flora]]:''' There are many [[alpine plant]] species in this region not found anywhere else in Europe, but often in the [[Arctic]] and sometimes in mountain areas in North America. In addition to birch trees include [[Populus tremula|aspen]], [[Pinus sylvestris|Scots pine]], [[Juniperus communis]], [[grey alder]], [[rowan]], [[Salix caprea|goat willow]] and [[Prunus padus|bird cherry]]. Some of the characteristic herbst are [[Aconitum lycoctonum]], [[bilberry]] (blueberry) and [[Rubus chamaemorus]], the latter typically growing on the numerous [[bog]]s.
&lt;br /&gt;
'''[[Fauna]]''' includes predators like [[wolverine]], [[brown bear]], [[Eurasian lynx]], [[grey wolf]], [[red fox]] and [[stoat]]. The [[Arctic fox]] is in danger of extinction in this area, but there are efforts to try to save the species. Herbivores include wild [[reindeer]] (only in the mountains in central Norway; the reindeer in the north are semi-domesticated), [[roe deer]] and [[red deer]] (lowland in southern part of ecoregion); the most common large herbivore is the [[moose]] (mostly below the treeline). [[Lemming]], [[vole]]s, [[squirrel]] and [[hare]] are common, and the [[European otter]] is common near the fjords and in many rivers, especially in the north. There are approximately 150 [[musk oxen]] on [[Dovrefjell]], having been transported from Greenland in the 1930s, as the species were extinct in Scandinavia. [[File:Stortolla.JPG|thumb|right|Mixed pine and birch forest, mid-boreal, 400 m [[amsl]] in ''Vindøldalen'', [[Surnadal]].]]
There is a rich bird life; most birds are [[Bird migration|migratory]], but some, like the [[rock ptarmigan|ptarmigan]], stay all year. Bird species include [[gyrfalcon]] and [[White-tailed eagle|sea eagle]]s. There are many lakes with [[trout]] and [[Arctic char]], the rivers have [[sea trout]] and [[salmon]].

A '''strath''' is a large [[valley]], typically a river valley that is wide and shallow (as opposed to a [[glen]], which is typically narrower and deep).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=T. A. Gibson|title=Etymological Geography: Being a Classified List of Terms of Most Frequent Occurrence, Entering, as Prefixes Or Postfixes, Into the Composition of Geographical Names|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m8owm163yr8C&amp;pg=PA23|accessdate=21 March 2013|year=1835|publisher=Oliver &amp; Boyd|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An anglicisation of the [[Scottish Gaelic language|Gaelic]] word ''srath'', it is one of many that have been absorbed into the [[English language]]. It is commonly used in rural Scotland to describe a wide valley, even by non-Gaelic speakers. 

It occurs in numerous place names within [[Scotland]] including [[Strathspey, Scotland|Strathspey]] and [[Strathclyde]]. Internationally, many places with [[Scotland|Scottish]] heritage also use the prefix, including [[Strath-Taieri, New Zealand|Strath-Taieri]] in [[New Zealand]]; [[Strathalbyn, South Australia|Strathalbyn]] in South Australia, [[Strathfield]], a suburb of [[Sydney]], [[Australia]]; [[Strathewen, Victoria]], Australia; [[Strathpine]], a suburb of [[Brisbane]], Australia; and various places in [[Canada]]: [[Strathmore, Alberta]]; [[Strathcona (disambiguation)#Places|Strathcona]]; [[Strathroy, Ontario]]; and Strathburn, Ontario.

It also occurs in the names of five [[Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company]] liners, four of which, the ''Strathaird'', the ''Strathnaver'', the ''Stratheden'' and the ''Strathmore'', carried thousands of migrants to Australia between the 1950s and the 1960s. The ships acted as troop carriers during the [[Second World War]] and the fifth ship, the ''Strathallan'',  sank in the Mediterranean in 1942 taking troops to the landings in North Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

The word is related to Old Welsh ''Ystrad'', as in ''Ystrad Clud'', the Old Welsh name for the [[Kingdom of Strathclyde]].

In [[Keith, Moray|Keith]] there is a distillery producing the [[Strathisla Single Malt|Strathisla]] whisky. It is a single malt whisky that is also an ingredient to the blend [[Chivas Regal]].

'''Students of Sustainability (SoS)''' is an annual conference of the Australian student environment and social justice movement and predates the [[Australian Student Environment Network]] (ASEN). The first Students of Sustainability conference was held at ANU in 1991 when it was called Students, Science and Sustainability. The name changed in 1995 to Students and Sustainability and then again in 2003 to Students of Sustainability. In each case the name changes were to make the conference open to a wider range of participants.   Students of Sustainability always runs in July co-currently with [[NAIDOC_Week|NAIDOC week]], Aboriginal and Islander politics and affairs play a major part in the SOS program.

==History==
The conference began in Canberra in 1991 under the name 'Students, Science and Sustainability'. This first conference (April 24–26, 1991) attracted more than 300 students from every Australian State and Territory to discuss matters of sustainability with respect to students and science. This first conference was organised by a small group of ANU undergraduates, including John Reynolds, Padma Raman, Tristan Armstrong, Naomi Flutter and Joely-Kym Sobott, among others. One of the many high profile speakers was the late Australian historian Manning Clark AC. 
Since then, interest and enthusiasm for the conference has grown, and the number of participants has steadily increased. As SoS moves around the country, it spreads its unique, life-affirming, change-making energy to the University and community that hosts it.

==Description==
From the website [http://www.studentsofsustainability.org www.studentsofsustainability.org] which is run by the hosting crew each year:

'''Aims of SoS'''
•  to inspire ecologically sustainable practices as an alternative - to current societal values 
•  to empower individuals and groups to bring about positive social and political change through open forums, skill sharing opportunities 
•  to create national and international networks of environmentally-minded people 
•  to integrate environmentalism with other progressive movements such as human rights and cultural awareness movements 
•  and to create a conference that is accessible to as many people as possible.

'''Organise''' - The SoS organising committee advocates supportive, respectful and constructive involvement in all aspects of the conference. All participants share their knowledge and learn from each other, bringing their own opinions, voices and ideas. This diversity of voices, ideas and opinions makes SoS what it is.

==Locations==

The '''Superior Craton''' or '''Superior Province''' is an [[Archean]] [[craton]] (4.031 billion years ago-present) which forms the core of the [[Canadian Shield]] lying north of [[Lake Superior]] for which it is named.

The craton extends from northwestern [[Quebec]] along the east side of [[Hudson Bay]] south through [[Northern Ontario]] to the north shores of [[Lake Huron]] and Lake Superior. It extends across [[Northwestern Ontario]] south of Hudson Bay and underlies most of southeastern [[Manitoba]]. It extends southward through eastern [[North Dakota|North]] and [[South Dakota]] and western [[Minnesota]].&lt;ref name=Card&gt;Card, K. D., 1986, ''Geology and Tectonics of the Archaean Superior Province, Canadian Shield'', Geological Survey of Canada, pp 27-29

It is bounded on the west and north by the [[Proterozoic]] [[Trans-Hudson orogen]] which separates it from the [[Wyoming Craton|Wyoming]], [[Hearne Craton|Hearne]], [[Slave Craton|Slave]], [[Rae Craton|Rae]] and [[Nain Province|Nain]] cratons. On the southeast it is bounded by the [[Grenville Front]] and to the south by the [[Midcontinent Rift System]] and the Yavapai – Mazatzal terranes.&lt;ref&gt;Canil, Dante; ''Canada's craton: A bottoms-up view,'' GSA Today: v. 18, no. 6, June 2008, pp. 4-10 doi: 10.1130/GSAT01806A.1 &lt;/ref&gt;

==Revised titles==
In 1970, the London volume was split into three. Bomb damage during the Second World War, the subsequent post-war reconstruction and alterations to local government boundaries in 1965 all made it difficult to properly treat London in one volume.&lt;ref&gt;"Preface" by Ann Saunders (1972) in ''London North of the Thames''. London: [[Hodder &amp; Stoughton]]. p. ix {{ISBN|0340158743}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new volumes, which brought the total to 42, were:

* ''London North of the Thames except the City and Westminster'' (1972)
* ''London – The City and Westminster''
* ''London South of the Thames''

==Reprints==
In 1989, [[The King's England Press]] was established to reprint the series, "recognising the need for them, both as excellent guidebooks and now with the added dimension as historical documents in their own right."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the company|url=http://www.kingsengland.com/PBCPPlayer.asp?ID=773748|publisher=The King's England Press|accessdate=7 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern mapping, a '''topographic map''' is a type of [[map]] characterized by large-[[Scale (map)|scale]] detail and quantitative representation of [[terrain|relief]], usually using [[contour line]]s, but historically using a [[cartographic relief depiction|variety of methods]]. Traditional definitions require a topographic map to show both natural and man-made features. A topographic survey is typically published as a [[map series]], made up of two or more map sheets that combine to form the whole map. A contour line is a line connecting places of equal elevation.

[[Natural Resources Canada]] provides this description of topographic maps:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Other authors define topographic maps by contrasting them with another type of map; they are distinguished from smaller-scale "[[chorography|chorographic]] maps" that cover large regions,&lt;ref&gt;P. D. A. Harvey, ''The History of Topographical Maps: Symbols, Pictures and Surveys'', Thames and Hudson, 1980, {{ISBN|0-500-24105-8}}, p. 9. "By a topographical map, we mean a large-scale map, one that sets out to convey the shape and pattern of landscape, showing a tiny portion of the earth's surface as it lies within one's own direct experience, and quite distinct from the small-scale maps that show us the features of whole provinces, nations and continents."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AAT"&gt;[[Art &amp; Architecture Thesaurus]] entry for [http://www.getty.edu/vow/AATFullDisplay?find=topographic+maps&amp;logic=AND&amp;note=&amp;english=N&amp;prev_page=1&amp;subjectid=300028361 topographic maps] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607112443/http://www.getty.edu/vow/AATFullDisplay?find=topographic+maps&amp;logic=AND&amp;note=&amp;english=N&amp;prev_page=1&amp;subjectid=300028361 |date=7 June 2011 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; "[[planimetrics|planimetric]] maps" that do not show elevations,&lt;ref&gt;Committee on Nomenclature of the American Society of Photogrammetry, "Definitions of terms used in photogrammetric surveying and mapping: preliminary report", ''Photogrammetric Engineering'', 8, 247-283, 1942. "Topographic Map. A map that presents the horizontal and vertical positions of the features represented; distinguished from a planimetric map by the addition of relief in measurable form." This definition is used in many glossaries of map terminology.&lt;/ref&gt; and "[[thematic map]]s" that focus on specific topics.&lt;ref&gt;M.-J. Kraak and F. Ormeling, ''Cartography: Visualization of Spatial Data'', Longman, 1996, {{ISBN|0-582-25953-3}}, p. 44. "Traditionally, the main division of maps is into topographic and thematic maps. Topographic maps supply a general image of the earth's surface: roads, rivers, buildings, often the nature of the vegetation, the relief and the names of the various mapped objects."&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in the vernacular and day to day world, the representation of relief (contours) is popularly held to define the genre, such that even small-scale maps showing relief are commonly (and erroneously, in the technical sense) called "topographic".&lt;ref name="AAT"/&gt;

The study or discipline of [[topography]] is a much broader field of study, which takes into account all [[Landform feature|natural]] and man-made features of terrain.

==History==
{{see also|Topography#Etymology|Cadastre#History|Cartography#History}}

Topographic maps are based on topographical surveys. Performed at large scales, these surveys are called topographical in the old sense of [[Topography as the study of place|topography]], showing a variety of elevations and landforms.&lt;ref&gt;The range of information is indicated by the title of a map produced in 1766: ''A Topographical Map of Hartfordshire from an Actual Survey in which is Express'd all the Roads, Lanes, Churches, Noblemen and Gentlemen's Seats, and every Thing remarkable in the County'', by Andrew Dury and John Andrews, reprinted by Hertfordshire Publications in 1980. This showed the relief by using [[hachures]].&lt;/ref&gt; This is in contrast to older [[cadastral survey]]s, which primarily show property and governmental boundaries. The first multi-sheet topographic map series of an entire country, the ''Carte géométrique de la France'', was completed in 1789.&lt;ref&gt;Library of Congress, [https://www.loc.gov/rr/geogmap/guide/gmillgen.html Geography and Maps: General Collections] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170916032347/http://www.loc.gov/rr/geogmap/guide/gmillgen.html |date=16 September 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Great Trigonometric Survey]] of India, started by the [[East India Company]] in 1802, then taken over by the [[British Raj]] after 1857 was notable as a successful effort on a larger scale and for accurately determining heights of Himalayan peaks from viewpoints over one hundred miles distant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

[[File:Soviet topographic map codes.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|left|Global indexing system first developed for ''International Map of the World'']]

Topographic surveys were prepared by the military to assist in planning for battle and for defensive emplacements (thus the name and history of the [[United Kingdom]]'s [[Ordnance Survey]]). As such, elevation information was of vital importance.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Barber, ''The Map Book'', Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, 2005, {{ISBN|0-297-84372-9}}, pp. 232, 250.&lt;/ref&gt;

As they evolved, topographic map series became a national resource in modern nations in planning infrastructure and resource exploitation. In the United States, the national map-making function which had been shared by both the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]] and the [[United States Department of the Interior|Department of the Interior]] migrated to the newly created [[United States Geological Survey]] in 1879, where it has remained since.&lt;ref&gt;

1913 saw the beginning of the [[International Map of the World]] initiative, which set out to map all of Earth's significant land areas at a scale of 1:1 million, on about one thousand sheets, each covering four degrees latitude by six or more degrees longitude. Excluding borders, each sheet was 44&amp;nbsp;cm high and (depending on latitude) up to 66&amp;nbsp;cm wide. Although the project eventually foundered, it left an [[International Map of the World#Map Indexing System|indexing system]] that remains in use.

By the 1980s, centralized printing of standardized topographic maps began to be superseded by databases of coordinates that could be used on computers by moderately skilled end users to view or print maps with arbitrary contents, coverage and scale. For example, the [[Federal government of the United States]]' ''[[TIGER]]'' initiative compiled interlinked databases of federal, state and local political [[border]]s and [[Census tract|census enumeration areas]], and of roadways, railroads, and water features with support for locating street addresses within street segments. TIGER was developed in the 1980s and used in the 1990 and subsequent [[United States Census|decennial censuses]]. [[Digital elevation model]]s (''DEM'') were also compiled, initially from topographic maps and stereographic interpretation of aerial photographs and then from [[remote sensing|satellite photography and radar data]]. Since all these were government projects funded with taxes and not classified for national security reasons, the datasets were in the [[public domain]] and freely usable without fees or licensing.

TIGER and DEM datasets greatly facilitated [[Geographic information system]]s and made the [[Global Positioning System]] much more useful by providing context around locations given by the technology as coordinates.  Initial applications were mostly professionalized forms such as innovative [[Surveying#Surveying equipment|surveying instruments]] and agency-level GIS systems tended by experts. By the mid-1990s, increasingly [[usability|user-friendly]] resources such as [[Web mapping|online mapping]] in two and three dimensions, integration of GPS with [[mobile phone]]s and [[automotive navigation system]]s appeared. As of 2011, the future of standardized, centrally printed topographical maps is left somewhat in doubt.&lt;ref&gt;

==Uses==
[[File:curvimetre.jpg|thumb|[[Curvimeter]] used to measure the length of a curve]]
Topographic maps have multiple uses in the present day: any type of geographic [[planning]] or large-scale [[architecture]]; [[earth sciences]] and many other [[geography|geographic]] disciplines; [[mining]] and other earth-based endeavours; [[civil engineering]] and recreational uses such as [[hiking]] and [[orienteering]].

==Conventions==

The various features shown on the map are represented by conventional signs or symbols. For example, colors can be used to indicate a classification of roads. These signs are usually explained in the margin of the map, or on a separately published characteristic sheet.&lt;ref&gt;Ordnance Survey, [http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/oswebsite/docs/legends/25k-raster-legend.pdf Explorer Map Symbols] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121101163741/http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/oswebsite/docs/legends/25k-raster-legend.pdf |date=1 November 2012 }}; Swisstopo, [http://www.swisstopo.admin.ch/internet/swisstopo/en/home/products/accessories/brochures.parsys.000120.DownloadFile.tmp/symbolsen.pdf Conventional Signs]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726110548/http://www.swisstopo.admin.ch/internet/swisstopo/en/home/products/accessories/brochures.parsys.000120.DownloadFile.tmp/symbolsen.pdf |date=26 July 2011 }}; United States Geological Survey, [http://erg.usgs.gov/isb/pubs/booklets/symbols/topomapsymbols.pdf Topographic Map Symbols] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910173405/http://erg.usgs.gov/isb/pubs/booklets/symbols/topomapsymbols.pdf |date=10 September 2008 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Topographic maps are also commonly called ''contour maps'' or ''topo maps''. In the United States, where the primary national series is organized by a strict 7.5-minute grid, they are often called ''topo quads'' or quadrangles.

Topographic maps conventionally show [[topography]], or land contours, by means of [[contour line]]s. Contour lines are [[curve]]s that connect contiguous points of the same [[altitude]] ([[isohypse]]). In other words, every point on the marked line of 100&amp;nbsp;m [[elevation]] is 100&amp;nbsp;m above mean sea level.

These maps usually show not only the contours, but also any significant [[stream]]s or other bodies of [[water]], [[forest]] cover, built-up areas or individual buildings (depending on scale), and other features and points of interest.

Today, topographic maps are prepared using [[photogrammetry|photogrammetric]] interpretation of [[aerial photography]], [[lidar]] and other [[Remote sensing]] techniques. Older topographic maps were prepared using traditional [[surveying]] instruments.

The cartographic style (content and appearance) of topographic maps is highly variable between national mapping organizations and aesthetic traditions and conventions persist, particularly amongst European countries at medium map scales.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kent|first=Alexander J.|last2=Vujakovic|first2=Peter|date=August 2009|title=Stylistic Diversity in European State 1 : 50 000 Topographic Maps|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1179/000870409X12488753453453|journal=The Cartographic Journal|language=en|volume=46|issue=3|pages=179–213|doi=10.1179/000870409x12488753453453|issn=0008-7041}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These large-scale maps are the basis for maps at smaller scales.  Maps at scales 1:4,000,000 or smaller are exported by  ''Cartographic Publishing House, Beijing'' while larger-scale maps are restricted as state secrets, and prohibited from publishing by legislation, all except Hong Kong and Macau.  China's topographic maps follow the [[International Map of the World|international system of subdivision]] with 1:100,000 maps spanning 30 minutes longitude by 20 minutes latitude.&lt;ref&gt;

===Netherlands===
The Land Registry [[Kadaster]] (formerly ''Topografische Dienst'') collects, processes and provides topographical information of the entire Dutch territory. 
The history of the Land Registry goes back to the year 1815, that year was commissioned to create a large map, known as ''Map of Krayenhoff''. Around 1836 they began printing the topographic map on a scale of 1: 50,000, followed in 1865 by the topographic map on a scale of 1: 25,000. In 1951 began the start of production of the topographic map on a scale of 1: 10,000. From various reorganizations arose in 1932 the ''Topografische Dienst'' as [[national mapping agency]] of the Netherlands, since January 2004 housed within the Land Registry ''Kadaster''.

===New Zealand===
Land Information New Zealand is the government agency responsible for providing up-to-date topographic mapping. LINZ topographic maps cover all of New Zealand, offshore islands, some Pacific Islands and the Ross Sea Region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linz.govt.nz/core/topography/index.html Land Information New Zealand] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20060706123156/http://www.linz.govt.nz/core/topography/index.html |date=6 July 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The standard issue ''NZTopo'' map series was published September 2009 at 1:50,000 (NZTopo50), and 1:250,000 (NZTopo250).

===Pakistan===
The responsibility for topographic mapping and aerial photography lies with the Surveyor General of Pakistan [SGP]. Established in 1947, the Survey of Pakistan (SOP) is based in Rawalpindi with a number of regional offices distributed at urban centers throughout Pakistan. SGP is a civil organization which, for security reasons, is headed by a Surveyor General and works under the strict control of Army General Headquarters (GHQ). Colonel C.A.K. Innes-Wilson, a Royal Engineers officer who joined the Survey of India which mapped the subcontinent, was the first Surveyor General of Pakistan.

All departments which require topographic maps make their request to SGP and many are permanently registered with it for mapping and aerial photographs procurement. The SOP performs these functions under the auspices of the Ministry of Defence (MOD). Organisationally, the SOP is overseen by the Surveyor General (SG) who is a direct military appointee and a senior uniformed officer. The SG reports directly to the Secretary of Defence. Under the SG are two Deputy SG’s (I and II) who manage the operational departments of the agency and a Senior Technical Advisor. These departments are divided into Regional Directorates for Topographic Mapping including the Northern region centred in Peshawar, Eastern region (Lahore), Western region (Quetta) and finally, the Southern region in Karachi. Responsibility for fields surveys and the maintenance/update of topographic maps are sub-divided according to these geographic areas.

===Portugal===
The Army's Geographical Institute - Instituto Geográfico do Exército [http://www.igeoe.pt/] - produces 1.25,000, 1:500,000 maps for public sale, as well as lots of geographical services.

===Romania===
Until recently, the two major government mapping authorities in Romania have been the Military Topographic Department (Directia Topografica Militara (DTM)), and the Institute for Geodesy, Photogrammetry, Cartography and Land Management (Institutul de Geodezie, Fotogrammetrie, Cartografie, si Organizarea Teritoriului (IGFCOT)). This situation has recently changed, following a decision in 1996 by the Romanian Government to establish a combined civilian National Office of Cadastre, Geodesy and Cartography (Oficiul National de Cadastru, Geodezie si Cartografie (ONCGC). Maps continued to be published under the imprint of the previous organizations into the late 1990s.
From 1958, a number of town maps at scales of 1:5,000 or 1:10,000 were also made, initially on the Gauss-Krϋger projection, but after 1970 on a stereographic projection. More than 100 such sheets have been produced. There is also a street map of Bucharest in four sheets at 1:15,000 derived from larger scale surveys, which is revised annually.

The 1:50,000 series in 737 sheets is now regarded as the base map. It was revised in the period 1965-72 using aerial photographs, and is currently being updated again with the intention of establishing a revision cycle of five to six years. The 1:25,000 will be retained, but revision only at 15-20-year intervals, except for sheets covering areas of rapid change.

===Russia===
Detailed, accurate topographic maps have long been a military priority.  They are currently produced by the ''Military-topographic service of armed forces of the Russian Federation'' ({{lang-ru|Военно-топографическая служба Вооружённых сил Российской Федерации or '''ВТС ВС'''}}).  Military topographic mapping departments held other titles in the [[Russian Empire]] since 1793 and in the [[Soviet Union]]&lt;ref&gt;[[:ru:Топографическая служба Вооружённых сил Российской Федерации]]{{Better source|date=October 2015|reason=[[WP:CIRCULAR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; where these maps also came to be used for [[Cheka|internal control]] and [[Economy of the Soviet Union|economic development]].

When [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Germany invaded in 1941]], detailed maps from the USSR's western borders to the [[Volga River]] became an urgent task, accomplished in less than one year.  After the war years the entire Soviet Union was mapped at scales down to 1:25,000—even 1:10,000 for the agriculturally productive fraction. The rest of the world except Antarctica is believed to have been mapped at scales down to 1:200,000, with regions of special interest down to 1:50,000 and many urban areas to 1:10,000.  In all there may have been over one million map sheets&lt;ref&gt;

===Spain===
The [[Instituto Geográfico Nacional (Spain)|Instituto Geográfico Nacional]] (IGN) is responsible for the official topographic maps. It does use six scales that cover all the Spanish territory: 1:25,000, 1:50,000, 1:200,000, 1:500,000, 1:1,000,000 and 1:2,000,000. The most common scale is the first one, which utilizes the UTM system.

===South Africa===
The [[Chief Directorate: National Geo-spatial Information]] (CD:NGI) produces three topographic map series, each covering the whole country, at scales 1:50&amp;nbsp;000, 1:250&amp;nbsp;000, and 1:500&amp;nbsp;000.

===Switzerland===
[[Swisstopo]] (the Federal Office of Topography) produces topographic maps of [[Switzerland]] at seven different scales.

=== Taiwan ===
Topographic maps for Taiwan had long been kept as confidential information due to security concerns. It has only been recently made available to public from the National Land Surveying and Mapping Center, the government agency responsible for surveying and publishing various maps.

The [[Ordnance Survey]] (OS) produces topographic map series covering the [[United Kingdom]] at 1:25,000 and 1:50,000 scales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/|title=Ordnance Survey: Britain's mapping agency|author=|date=|website=www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk|accessdate=1 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19981201075807/http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/|archivedate=1 December 1998|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1:25,000 scale is known as the "Explorer" series, and include an "OL" (Outdoor Leisure) sub-series for areas of special interest to hikers and walkers. It replaced the "Pathfinder" series, which was less colourful and covered a smaller area on each map. The 1:50,000 scale is known as the "Landranger" and carries a distinctive pink cover. More detailed mapping as fine as 1:10,000 covers some parts of the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/oswebsite/products/10kraster/ 1:10,000 Scale Raster: mid-scale high-resolution detailed mapping] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070510233536/http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/oswebsite/products/10kraster/ |date=10 May 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1:25,000 and 1:50,000 scales are easily coordinated with standard [[romer]] scales on currently available compasses and plotting tools. The Ordnance Survey maintains a mapping database from which they can print specialist maps at virtually any scale.&lt;ref&gt;The [[MasterMap]] [https://archive.is/20130718045200/http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/oswebsite/products/os-mastermap/topography-layer/ Topography Layer] contains information about buildings, roads, woodland, administrative boundaries, etc., with just a few spot heights along the roads. For contours or a digital terrain model, a separate product called [http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/oswebsite/products/land-and-height-data.html OS Terrain] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130701031951/https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/oswebsite/products/land-and-height-data.html |date=1 July 2013 }} is required.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ordnance Survey National Grid]] divides the U.K. into cells 500&amp;nbsp;km, 100&amp;nbsp;km, 10&amp;nbsp;km and 1&amp;nbsp;km square on a [[Transverse Mercator]] grid aligned true North-South along the 2°W [[Meridian (geography)|meridian]]. OS map products are based on this grid.

===United States===&lt;!--this section linked to by [[The National Map]]--&gt;
The [[United States Geological Survey]] (USGS), a scientific federal agency, produces several national series of topographic maps which vary in scale and extent, with some wide gaps in coverage, notably the complete absence of 1:50,000 scale topographic maps or their equivalent. The largest (both in terms of scale and quantity) and best-known topographic series is the 7.5-minute or 1:24,000 [[Quadrangle (geography)|quadrangle]]. This scale is unique to the United States,{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} where nearly every other developed nation has introduced a metric 1:25,000 or 1:50,000 large scale topo map.  The USGS also publishes 1:100,000 maps covering 30 minutes latitude by one degree longitude, 1:250,000 covering one by two degrees, and state maps at 1:500,000 with [[California]], [[Michigan]] and [[Montana]] needing two sheets while [[Texas]] has four. [[Alaska]] is mapped on a single sheet, at scales ranging from 1:1,584,000 to 1:12,000,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Recent USGS digital ''National Map'' omits several important geographic details that were featured in the original USGS topographic map series (1945-1992).&lt;ref name="MOO"&gt;Moore, Larry, ''[http://www.directionsmag.com/articles/us-topo-a-new-national-map-series/178707 US Topo – A New National Map Series] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422094859/http://www.directionsmag.com/articles/us-topo-a-new-national-map-series/178707 |date=22 April 2012 }}'', Directions Magazine, 16 May 2011, retrieved 18 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  Examples of omitted details and features include power transmission lines, telephone lines, railroads, recreational trails, pipelines, survey marks, and buildings.&lt;ref name="MOO"/&gt;  For many of these feature classes, the USGS is working with other agencies to develop data or adapt existing data on missing details that will be included in The National Map.&lt;ref name="MOO"/&gt;  In other areas USGS digital map revisions may omit geographic features such as ruins, mine locations, springs, wells, and even trails in an effort to protect natural resources and the public at large, or because such features are not present in any public domain database.&lt;ref name="MOO"/&gt;
