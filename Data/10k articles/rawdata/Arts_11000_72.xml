'''''A Dialogue of Comfort against Tribulation''''' is a work that was written by St. [[Thomas More]] while imprisoned in the [[Tower of London]] in 1534.

[[File:Nb_pinacoteca_yeames_the_meeting_of_sir_thomas_more_with_his_daughter_after_his_sentence_of_death.jpg|thumb|450px|William Frederick Yeames, ''The meeting of Sir Thomas More with his daughter after his sentence of death'', 1872]]

==Introduction==
Thomas More was imprisoned by King [[Henry VIII]] for refusing to swear to the [[Act Respecting the Oath to the Succession|Act of Succession (1534)]]. He had been given writing materials in the early months of his imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;Ackroyd, Peter. The Life of Thomas More. New York: Anchor, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dialogue is set in the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] in 1528, between the invasions of [[Suleiman the Magnificent]]. It is a fictional dialogue between Vincent and his uncle, Anthony. The book begins with Vincent paying a visit to his uncle. He is terrified by the invasions of [[Ottoman Empire|the Ottomans]] and seeks comfort from Anthony. Anthony tells him that comfort can only come from God. The Dialogue is a reflection on worldly power, the transience of pleasure, and the redemptive power of [[Jesus Christ]]. While it is a spiritual reflection, the treatment of themes of worldly power by a major political figure and humanist also characterizes it as a work of political thought.

==Summary==
'''Book I''' (Day 1)&lt;ref name="A Dialogue of Comfort"&gt;More,Thomas. "A Dialogue of Comfort against Tribulation". Vol. 12. Yale University Press, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

''Comfort in Tribulation (Chapters I-XII)''

Anthony defines tribulation as grief consisting either of bodily pain or heaviness of the mind. Ancient [[Ethics|moral philosophers]] recommended various remedies for tribulation, including the uses of certain drugs, but they lacked the most effective source of comfort, [[Faith in Christianity|faith]], which is a gift from God (I-II).

The first source of comfort in tribulation is the desire to be comforted by God (III). But, the desire to have tribulation taken away is not always sufficient, since God sometimes wills for us to suffer tribulation (IV). Anthony discusses the importance of friends who pray for and give counsel to the one suffering tribulation (V). Comfort in tribulation requires trust that God works all things towards good (VI).

The second source of comfort is that tribulation is medicinal (VII).
Anthony says there are three types of tribulation: 
# those caused through our own fault (VIII)
# those sent by God as punishment for past sins or to prevent other sins (IX)
# those sent to increase our patience and our merit (X)
[[File:Christ praying in the garden of Gethsemane. Two shields of unidentified arms in borders, with motto “Entre tenir Dieu le viuelle” (f. 40) Cropped.jpg|thumb|Christ praying in the garden of Gethsemane.]]
Third source of comfort is that merit can be gained through perseverance here on Earth but not in purgatory (XI). This perseverance leads not only to the purging of our sins, but also to the increase of our heavenly reward. Anthony questions the existence of purgatory (XII).

''The Necessity of Tribulation (Chapters XIII-XX)''

Fourth source of comfort is that the cross is necessary to enter heaven and continual prosperity is a grave danger (XIII). Vincent responds that this treatment of prosperity is too harsh (XIV) and raises four objections (XV):
# the Church prays for the health of princes and prelates 
# if health and prosperity are wrong why take medicine 
# [[Solomon]], [[Job]], and [[Abraham]] were all prosperous 
# many rich men are good and many poor people are evil
Anthony defines tribulation again and answers first and third objections (XVI). Then, Anthony answers the second objection and explains how suffering draws us to God, through prayer (XVII). Anthony speaks of those who seek “mad medicines” rather than God (XVIII). Vincent questions the preeminence Anthony gives to suffering. Anthony argues that the prayers of those suffering are far more precious to God than the prayers of the prosperous (XIX). Anthony explains that suffering is a gracious gift from God. Anthony speaks about the necessity of tribulation. He claims that continual prosperity without tribulation is a sign of God’s disfavor (XX).

'''Book II''' (about a month later, after breakfast)

Vincent returns to visit Anthony and tells him that he has shared his council with his friends and that he wishes to hear more. The main topic of their last discussion was not tribulation itself but the comfort that comes from it (prologue). Vincent says that Anthony disavowal of all worldly recreation is too hard. Anthony responds that while it is allowed to seek worldly enjoyment our first priority should be to seek comfort from God (I). Anthony bemoans how old and frail he is (II). Anthony divides tribulation into three types: 
# those which a man willingly takes upon himself
# those he willingly suffers
# those he cannot avoid, such as sickness, imprisonment, loss of goods, loss of friends or unavoidable bodily harm. 
The third kind was discussed in the first book and Anthony reiterates his principle that wit and faith are necessary for comfort in this type of tribulation (III). Anthony describes the first type where the tribulation is willfully accepted for [[penance]] and no comfort is needed. To show that two contrary states can co-exist, he gives an example of a strange intermittent fever he had where he felt both cold and hot (IV). Vincent says many people refrain from repenting until their deathbeds. Anthony answers saying deathbed conversions are still salvific but those who live lives of repentance have a higher place in heaven (V). Vincent adds that some say compunction and penance for one's sins is unnecessary or ineffectual and that only the intent to do better is required. Anthony responds, the Church has always taught that it is only through Christ’s [[Passion of Jesus|Passion]] that our penance is worth anything. And Anthony gives many scriptural examples of how fasting was instituted by God, not by men and for more reasons than to increase physical temperance (VI). Vincent asks, what if one cannot feel sorry for one’s sins. Anthony answers that if he cannot feel sorry for his sin, then at least he should feel sorry for not feeling sorry (VII).

Anthony discusses the second type of tribulation, those willingly suffered, and he subdivides them into two parts: the first being temptation and the second persecution (VIII).
[[File:Envy-fasting-prayer.jpg|thumb|Envy-fasting-prayer]]
''[[Psalm 91]] [90]:5-6 and the First Temptation (Chapter IX-XVI)''

Continuing the discussion on temptation, Anthony says that the forms of temptation are diverse and the more we are tempted the more reason we have to be comforted in the hope of receiving an eternal reward (IX). The second comfort in temptation is that God has promised to give us the necessary strength and wisdom to overcome temptation if we ask for it. He introduces Psalm 91 [90] where God is described as a hen which protects her young with her wings (X).

Anthony distinguishes four types of temptation in the [[Psalm]] (XI). The first is about fear which leads to impatience or to the exaggeration of danger. Anthony uses verse five from the Psalm ‘Thou shalt not be afeard of the fear of the night’ as a basis for his interpretation (XII). Another form of ‘night’s fear’ is pusillanimity, which is fleeing from things that are incorrectly perceived as dangerous (XIII). Anthony describes a scrupulous conscience as the “daughter of pusillanimity” and advises those with scruples to seek another’s counsel (XIV). Anthony continues by saying the desire to commit suicide is another example of ‘night’s fear’. Vincent objects and says that suicide is an example of courage and boldness. Anthony responds by telling him that people can be tempted to commit suicide out of pride or anger and therefore do not suffer tribulation and are not in need of comfort but rather good counsel (XV). Anthony discusses the desire to kill oneself that is perceived to be a revelation from God. In such cases comfort and counsel are both required; counsel is necessary to make him aware of his delusion and comfort is necessary to encourage him and give him consolation (XVI).

''The Second Temptation (Chapter XVI)''

Anthony defines the second temptation as pride. He interprets "the arrow flying by day" (Psalm 91 [90]:5b) to consist of temptations that find their source in prosperity (XVI).

''The Third Temptation (Chapter XVII)''

Anthony identifies the third temptation as covetousness. He interprets Psalm 91 [90]:6 “the busyness walking about in the darknesses” to be the frantic pursuit of riches or worldly possessions. Vincent asks if the rich man can be saved. Anthony explains that riches in themselves are not evil only the inordinate pursuit of them. Wealth should be used to care for the poor, one’s family (including servants), and strangers in need (XVII).

'''Book III''' (later on the same day, after dinner)
[[File:A harom reszre szakadt Magyar allam terkepe (1567).JPG|thumb|The Kingdom of Hungary was torn into three parts (1567)]]

Vincent tells Anthony about a letter he saw from Constantinople concerning the approaching Turkish army. Vincent expresses his fear that the Turks will invade Hungary and that many Christians will renounce their faith. Anthony agrees that this will probably happen. He says that Turkish invasion is God’s punishment on Europe for their lack of faith. Anthony says that since the various warring factions for the Hungarian throne will not offer much resistance against the Turkish invasion, they should prepare for the worst (Prologue).

Vincent objects saying it is dangerous to think about how one would respond under torture, either you will promise too much beforehand and fail to persevere or you will want to avoid pain and give up your faith. Anthony responds that Christians must confess their faith openly upon pain of [[damnation]]. If anyone is afraid of falling, let them think of Christ's Passion and pray for strength (I).

''The Fourth Temptation (Chapters II-IV)''

The fourth, and final temptation, is open persecution for the faith. Anthony interprets Psalm 91 [90]:6b "incursion of the noon-day devil" to be the most dangerous of all temptations. Here the Devil works openly and without subterfuge. Vincent would like to be prepared to withstand the attacks of the Devil with good counsel (II).

Anthony states that both the soul and the body can suffer harm. Anthony asks Vincent to list the outward things that a man might lose and the pain he might suffer. Vincent first lists the loss of worldly possessions, offices, positions of authority and finally the lands that belong to the man in question and his heirs. The loss of these things leads to neediness and poverty, and the shame of begging. The harm that comes to the body consists of loss of liberty, hard labor, imprisonment, and a painful and shameful death (III). Anthony admits that after examining the issue as they have, the threat of the Turkish invasion seems less terrible (IV).

''The Loss of Outward Things (Chapters V-XVI)''

Anthony states that the value of outward goods is greatly exaggerated; they can be lost easily (V). The possession of land does not offer any more security than other forms of wealth (VI). The outward ‘goods of fortune’ and one’s reputation should be used to benefit one's earthly life and increase merit, “with God’s help”, in the afterlife (VII). There is a limited value of being wealthy in this life (VIII).
[[File:Ladislaus I (Chronica Hungarorum).jpg|thumb|Ladislaus I (Chronica Hungarorum)]]
Anthony considers fame or one’s good name. Its value is also exaggerated and can even be harmful, especially when people hate or envy us (IX). Some men prefer flattery over honesty so much they hire flatterers as advisors. Vincent tells a story about a prelate who asked an ambassador for advice and afterwards rebuked him for his honesty. Anthony responds with a story about King [[Ladislaus I of Hungary]], who if he was honestly and deservedly praised, would let it pass unremarked, but if he received flattery he would tell the flatterer to not praise him with lies (X).

Anthony explains that positions of authority are of little value if they are only desired for worldly advantage. Most men only want positions of power so that they can order people around. Vincent interjects that there is still a certain pleasure in making people bow and do reverence. Anthony replies that even princes cannot always have their way and their responsibilities are more burdensome (XI). Outward goods, when desired only for worldly advantage, have little value for the body and can cause great harm for the soul (XII). Anthony points out that in the imminent Turkish persecutions those who have a greater desire to keep their possessions than faith will keep their worldly goods and those who have a stronger faith than the desire to keep their possessions will loses their worldly goods (XIII). Vincent acknowledges that the temptation to give up one's faith to keep one’s worldly possessions is the strongest of all temptations. Anthony has Vincent play the role of a great lord who wants to keep his possessions. Vincent, as the lord, says he can outwardly confess the Great Turk’s faith while secretly remaining a Christian. Anthony responds that God is not fooled and neither will the Great Turk. You cannot serve both God and [[Mammon]]. He also points out that even if one denies the faith that is no guarantee one will be able to keep one’s property (XIV).

Vincent points out that it is always detestable to lose one’s possessions. Anthony suggests that the only safe place to hide one’s treasure is in heaven, that is to give one's possessions to the poor.  If our hearts are truly in Heaven, God will strengthen us to suffer the loss of our worldly possessions &lt;ref name="Lakowski"&gt;*Romuald Lakowski. [http://extra.shu.ac.uk/emls/iemls/work/chapters/chap6sum.html Summary of Dialogue of Comfort]&lt;/ref&gt; (XV). Christians have grown very weak and lukewarm in their faith. Yet, if they truly remembered the poverty of Christ, how he became poor and needy for their sake, they would be ashamed to forsake him by keeping their wealth. If we lose our possessions because of our faith we will be recompensed in heaven&lt;ref name="Lakowski"/&gt; (XVI).

''Bodily Pain, Captivity, and Imprisonment (Chapters XVII-XXII)''

[[File:Walka o sztandar turecki.jpg|thumb|450px|''Sipahis of the Ottoman Empire'' by [[Józef Brandt]]]]

Vincent tells Anthony of his fear of denying the faith under torture. Anthony responds by reminding Vincent that Christ dreaded his own Passion. Vincent is comforted by Anthony's words (XVII). Anthony lists the physical punishments common in the persecution by the Turks: captivity, imprisonment, and painful death. Anthony defines captivity as the violent restraint of a man under the power of another to the extent that he must do what the other commands, and is not at liberty to go where he wishes. Christ’s humility is offered as a model to follow (XVIII).

Anthony defines imprisonment as: a restraint of liberty that prevents a man from going where he wishes. Anthony states that every man is in a prison. Vincent objects accusing his uncle of “sophistical fantasies”. Anthony welcomes Vincent’s challenge and replies that every man coming into this world is condemned to death by God's own judgement for man's original sin. No one, not even the greatest king, can escape the grisly cruel hangman Death&lt;ref name="Lakowski"/&gt; (XIX).

Anthony describes God is the chief jailer of this prison of the whole earth. Vincent accepts part of Anthony's argument, but objects that he does not see God putting any man in stocks or fetters, or locking him in a chamber. Anthony replies that as God himself is invisible, he also uses invisible instruments to inflict his punishments. If we fear imprisonment at the hands of the Turks so much that we are prepared to renounce our faith, then we will find ourselves thrown into the prison of Hell, from which no man ever escapes&lt;ref name="Lakowski"/&gt; (XX).

Vincent expresses fear of suffering a shameful and painful death. Anthony explains that if our affections are sensual we will fear death much more than if they are spiritual (XXI). Anthony considers death itself (XXII).

''Persecution and Martyrdom (Chapters XXIII-XXVII)''
[[File:Schwaigern-barbara-altar.jpg|thumb|Martyrdom of St. Barbara]]
Anthony discusses the shame that comes with persecution. Anthony then argues that the faithful wise man will not dread any death however painful since Christ himself and his saints died such glorious deaths (XXIII). Vincent responds that shame is one thing that can be mastered, but no one can master pain in the same way. Anthony replies that, though no one can deny the reality of pain, reason alone often helps a man to bear the pain for the sake of some greater good&lt;ref name="Lakowski"/&gt; (XXIV).

Anthony says that Christ warns us not to fear those who can only kill the body, but rather to fear the one who can kill both body and soul in Hell. Anyone who considers this will not be afraid to endure the most terrible sufferings the Turks can inflict, rather than be cast into the pains of Hell (XXV). Anthony discusses the joys of Heaven. He says, if we considered the joys of Heaven, we would be much more willing to suffer for Christ in this world for the sake of winning heavenly joy&lt;ref name="Lakowski"/&gt; (XXVI).

Finally, Anthony describes in detail the sufferings of Christ in his Passion, and suggests that, if we meditate on them, they will inflame our cold hearts with such love for Christ, that we will be happy to suffer death for his sake. We should prepare ourselves with prayer, fasting and almsgiving, and not trust in our own strength, but rely on the help of God. We should resist the Devil's temptations, and not fear the Turks &lt;ref name="Lakowski"/&gt;(XXVII).

''Conclusion''

Anthony, wearily, bids Vincent farewell. Vincent thanks Anthony for all his efforts and the comfort Vincent has taken from Anthony's counsels. Vincent says he will write down what was discussed in Hungarian and German. Anthony ends by praying that God will breathe His Holy Spirit into the reader's breast, so that he may teach the reader inwardly in his heart. Anthony then prays that God will reunite them once more either here or in Heaven&lt;ref name="Lakowski"/&gt;(XXVII).

==The Great Turk as forms of tribulation==
There are three main interpretations of the Great Turk in the Dialogue.

===The Ottoman Emperor===
In a literal interpretation, the Great Turk signifies the terrible vulnerability of a theologically and politically divided Europe to the [[Great Turkish Invasion|Turkish invasions]]. As [[Hungary]] was on the eastern edge of Europe, it was the first line of defense in preventing the Ottomans from conquering the rest Europe. And since the Emperor took an oath (Book III) when he becomes Sultan to spread the faith of [[Islam]] by conquest, the threat of persecution or martyrdom for [[Christian]]s was real.

===Henry VIII===
[[Henry VIII]] was directly responsible for [[Thomas More]]’s tribulation when he wrote the Dialogue in the tower. But the King’s legacy can be extended to all [[Roman Catholic (term)|Roman Catholics]] in [[England]]. The separation of England from the Roman Catholic Church during the [[English Reformation]] made Catholicism illegal and began centuries of persecution. Catholics were not granted legal toleration in England until 1829 under the [[Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829]] and there is still a very deep rooted tradition of [[Anti-Catholicism]] today in English speaking countries including the [[Anti-Catholicism in the United States|USA]].&lt;ref&gt;*Lakowski, Romuald I. "Sir Thomas More and the Art of Dialogue." Ph.D. Diss. U of British Columbia, Fall 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Devil===
The [[Devil]] is ultimately the cause of all the trials and persecutions that Christians may be called upon to suffer in this life, especially in light of the first and second interpretations. In the Dialogue, Thomas More continually emphasizes the importance of a strong faith and prayer to overcome the Devil and his works.&lt;ref&gt;*Bore, Isabella. "Thomas More et Ie Grand Turc: variations sur le theme des invasions ottomanes" Morcalla Vol. 48, 185-186. pp. 9-34.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication==
Immediately after More's death the Dialogue of Comfort circulated in manuscript form. The most important surviving manuscripts are the Corpus Christi Manuscript, Bodleian Library, Ms. C.C.C. D.37;and British Library, Ms. Royal 17 D.XIV. It was first published, in [[quarto]], in London by [[Richard Tottel]] in 1553. In modern editions the spelling and punctuation of the original are corrected and standardized.

'''Abhimāna''' ([[Sanskrit]]:अभिमान) variously means – pride, false prestige, desire, an impression, the conception, by self-conception, from the misconception; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Meaning of the Sanskrit word – abhimana|publisher=Sanskritdictionary.org|url=http://sanskritdictionary.org/abhimana}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Hindu philosophy]], it means – prideful attachment of "I-sense" i.e. ''man'' (to think) + ''māna'' (too much); it also means – identify or identification&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Be Free From “Me|author=Paul Bahder|publisher=Vision of Vedanta|page=|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=PdGwAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT191&amp;dq=abhimana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_efyVNmwCo6OuASq1YKoAw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=abhimana&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; and also refers to selfish conviction, for ''abhimāna'' is the function of ''[[ahamkara]]'' (ego) as the state of mind which interprets experience as " mine ".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedia of the Hindu World Part 1|publisher=Concept Publishing|page=107|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=w9pmo51lRnYC&amp;pg=PA107&amp;dq=abhimana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=n-PyVN64Mc6WuATfq4G4Cg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=abhimana&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The psychological sense of "I" am experience is ''ahamkāra'' which comes about as and when owing to '' [[Avidya (Hinduism)|avidya]] '', [[Brahman]], the Universal transcendental Self, is distinguished from the [[Jiva]], the empirical individual self. ''Sanga'' (one’s associations), ''mamkāra'' (attachments) and ''moha'' (attractions) are the three aspects of abhimāna (ego-consciousness)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Psychology in India Vol. 4|publisher=Pearson Publications|pages=130–131|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=fXQzo7LGfuIC&amp;pg=PA131&amp;dq=abhimana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=n-PyVN64Mc6WuATfq4G4Cg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=abhimana&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; which produces ''katrtva'' (the sense agency) as the deliberate consciousness of ''niścaya'' (decision) without which there would be no difference between the self and other material objects; '' [[buddhi]] '' (intellect), which manifests according to ''[[vāsanā]]s'' (impressions), is deliberate decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Indian Philosophy Vol.5|author=Surendranathh Dasgupta|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|pages=34–35|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=aohGsuUuXuMC&amp;pg=PA35&amp;dq=abhimana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=g-fyVI6xB86KuASYvIHACQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=abhimana&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:  " The antahkarana (internal organ, the mind) has its seat in these, the eye and other organs of the body identifying itself with them with the sense of "I" by reflection of the ātman in it. "   – [[Vivekachudamani]] (105)

[[Adi Shankara|Shankara]] tells us that the mind or manas dwells in the organs and body as ''aham'' (ego) with ''abhimāna'' – अहमित्यभिमानेन in the reflected brightness of the atman as the ''kartā'' (doer) and the ''bhoktā'' (enjoyer) experiencing all three states of consciousness but the atman, the witness of everything, limited by ''buddhi'' is not tainted by anything that ''buddhi'' does – अशेषसाक्षी for the taint of action attaches only to the actor, the ātman does not act. This ''abhimāna'' or identification with names and forms dependent on the perishable body, as also with the subtle body, needs to be given up entirely in order to realize ''akhanda ānanda'' (inseparable bliss).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Foundations of Indian Psychology Vol.1|author=Cormelissen R.M.Matthijs|publisher=Pearson Education|page=139|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=xmiJWZnCH1oC&amp;pg=PA139&amp;dq=abhimana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=n-PyVN64Mc6WuATfq4G4Cg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=abhimana&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vācaspati Miśra]] explains that it is ''ahamkāra'' (empirical ego) which presides over the objects intuited by the sense-organs and then definitely perceived by the mind; and that the sense-organ intuits the object, ''manas'' reflects on it, ''ahamkāra'' appropriates it and finally ''buddhi'' (intellect) resolves which way the intended action must proceed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ancient Indian Education|author=Radha Kumud Mookerji|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=294|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=mjFfqpq7HhkC&amp;pg=PA294&amp;dq=abhimana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=7uTyVKHQLMSHuATkzYCgBA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=abhimana&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Abhimāna'' is the false sense of "I" and "mine"; it is because of the emphatic identity (''abhimāna'') with one’s body etc., that there is ''pramata'' (cognising subject) and involvement with ''pramānas'' (acts or processes of knowing, perception, inference and the rest) owing to functioning of the senses as resulting from ''avidyā'' (ignorance) and resulting in bondage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Philosophy of Sankar’s Advaita Vedanta|author=Shyama Kumar Chattopadhyaya|publisher=Sarup &amp; Sons|pages=41,366|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=IPasbJW-1PwC&amp;pg=PA366&amp;dq=abhimana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=S-jyVIefOIeRuASBwIKYBA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=abhimana&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examined from the level of social consciousness, ātman or the transcendental consciousness is certainly essential for man’s being but ''[[upadhi]]s'' (limitations) are its accidental parts the self-identification with which gives rise to ''abhimāna'' (identification with the body) that makes man a socio-spiritual being subjective and objective, both, and becomes the basis for his ''adhikāra'' (social and ritual eligibility).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Foundations of Indian Culture Vol.1|author=Govind Chandra Pande|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=3|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=VMf-isGALqQC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=abhimana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=n-PyVN64Mc6WuATfq4G4Cg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=abhimana&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Shudha Advaita school of [[Vallabha Acharya]], ''saguna'' means – one having the ''abhimāna'' of gunas (forming part of one’s own self), the ''nirguna'' is one having no abhimāna.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Kalatattvakosa|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=18|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=_YHYrni9wckC&amp;pg=PA186&amp;dq=abhimana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=7uTyVKHQLMSHuATkzYCgBA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=abhimana&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Lakshmi Tantra]] tells us that "''ahamkāra'' which is a cognitive-sense, is identical with ''abhimāna''" and "the awareness of the knower in relating time and place to himself is called ''abhimāna''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Lakshmi Tantra|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=33|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=pENlKmZ4r94C&amp;pg=PA33&amp;dq=abhimana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vubyVLmMIIKSuQTn5IIg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=abhimana&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; For most people desiring success, incidental gains and weighed down by sense of self-respect ''abhimāna'' is a virtue but for those who are wise and contented, it is mere pride associated with arrogance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Design and Rhetoric in Sanskrit Court Epic|publisher=SUNY Press|page=81|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=tTm5RVOAEnMC&amp;pg=PA81&amp;dq=abhimana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=7uTyVKHQLMSHuATkzYCgBA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=abhimana&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Bhoja]], who outlined the theory of [[Rasa (aesthetics)|Rasa]] (experience of delight), attaches great importance to ''abhimāna'' or ''ahankāra'' (ego). He states that the ''[[rasika]]'' who has ''rasa'' in him has it because of ''[[sringara]]'' (peak), ''ahamkāra'' and ''abhimāna'', enjoyable as a ''[[guna]]'' of his atman; he uses the term ''abhimāna'' in a good sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=I.A.Richards and Indian Theory of Rasa|author=Gupteshwar Prasad|publisher=Sarup &amp; Sons|pages=16–25|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=hmy5cnSbsWYC&amp;pg=PA25&amp;dq=abhimana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=P-byVJTjLdCOuATbwIC4Bw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=abhimana&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; From ''ahamkāra'' rises ''abhimāna'' that originates ''sringāra'', and from ''abhimāna'' rises ''[[rati]]'' (love, amorousness), and from ''rati'' are originated all ''rasas''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Glimpses of Indian Poetics|author=Satya Dev Chaudhari|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|page=106|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=hnB8-TPF7pYC&amp;pg=PA106&amp;dq=abhimana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=n-PyVN64Mc6WuATfq4G4Cg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=abhimana&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Original research|date=November 2009}}
'''Airport novel(s)''' represent a [[literary genre]] that is not so much defined by its [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] or cast of [[stock character]]s, as much as it is by the social function it serves.  An airport novel is typically a fairly long but fast-paced [[novel]] of intrigue or adventure that is stereotypically found in the reading fare offered by [[airport]] [[newsstand]]s.

Considering the marketing of fiction as a trade, airport novels occupy a niche similar to the one that once was occupied by [[pulp magazine]] fiction and other reading materials typically sold at newsstands and [[kiosk]]s to travellers.  This pulp fiction is one obvious source for the genre; sprawling [[historical novel]]s of exotic adventure such as those by [[James A. Michener|James Michener]] and [[James Clavell]] are another source.  In [[French language|French]], such novels are called ''romans de gare'', "[[train station|railway station]] novels",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Romans de gare|work=Harper-Collins French-English Dictionary|publisher=Harper-Collins|date= 2007|isbn= 978-0-00-728044-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting that writers in France were aware of this potential market at an even earlier date.&lt;ref name="Sweeney, Seamus"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.socialaffairsunit.org.uk/blog/archives/000327.php |title=A New Genre: The Record Store Book|website=The Social Affairs Unit|author=Sweeney, Seamus}}&lt;/ref&gt; The somewhat dated, Dutch term 'stationsroman' is a [[calque]] from French.

==Meeting the reading needs of travelers==
An airport novel must necessarily be superficially engaging, while not being particularly profound or philosophical, or at least, without such content being necessary for enjoyment of the book. The reader is not a person alone, in a quiet setting, contemplating deep thoughts or savouring fine writing; the reader is being jostled and penned among strangers, and seeks distraction from the boredom and inconveniences of travel. Similarly, the reader is not in a position to consult reference works, scholarly papers, or the author's previous works. The writer of an airport novel must meet the needs of readers in this situation.

The realisation that this niche market for [[mass market paperback]]s had given rise to a new genre was slow in coming. Perhaps a defining moment in the history of the genre came in 1968, when [[Arthur Hailey]] published ''[[Airport (novel)|Airport]]'', an airport novel that used the commercial flight industry to frame an adventure yarn about a disaster in an airport.&lt;ref name="Fear of Flying"&gt;Sarah Vowell, [http://www.salon.com/ent/music/vowe/1998/08/24vowe.html ''Fear of Flying''] at salon.com, byline Aug. 24, 1998, accessed Mar. 26, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Hailey's other novels, [[soap opera]] tales with complex plots of adultery and intrigue featuring business characters, using a number of other industries as backdrops (e.g. ''[[The Final Diagnosis]]'' ([[hospital]]s); ''[[Hotel (novel)|Hotel]]'' ([[hotel]]s);  ''[[Wheels (novel)|Wheels]]'' ([[automobile]] industry); ''[[The Moneychangers]]'' ([[banking]]) represented an emerging genre.

==Format==
{{Original research|date=May 2010}}
{{Refimprove|date=May 2010}}
Airport novels are always [[paperback book]]s of a small but thick format. These books are often printed on inexpensive [[newsprint]]. {{citation needed|date=February 2015}} Their titles are often printed in a gilded, silvery or vividly scarlet finish, which more often than not starts very quickly to dissolve and stick to the reader's fingertips. This is not a problem for their intended purpose; they are made to be bought on impulse, and their readers often discard them when finished.

Airport novels are typically quite long books; a book that a reader was able to finish before the journey was done would similarly be unsatisfying.  Because of this length, the genre attracts prolific authors, who use their output as a sort of [[brand]]ing; each author is identified with a certain sort of story, and produces many variations of the same thing.  Well-known authors' names are usually in type larger than the title on the covers of airport novels, often in [[Embossing (paper)|embossed]] letters.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Cathcart, ''[http://www.abc.net.au/rn/arts/atoday/stories/s153446.htm Airport art: what is it?]''.  [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]], byline July 17, 2000, accessed Mar. 25, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==
Airport novels typically fall within a number of other [[genre fiction|fictional genres]], including:

* [[Crime fiction]]
* [[Detective fiction]]
* [[Historical romance]]
* [[Spy fiction]]
* [[Thriller (genre)|Thriller]]s

Whatever the genre, the books must be fast-paced and easy to read.  The description "airport novel" is mildly [[pejorative]]; it implies that the book has little lasting value, and is useful chiefly as an inexpensive form of entertainment during travel.  Airport novels are sometimes contrasted with [[literary fiction]]; so that a novel with literary aspirations would be disparaged by the label.&lt;ref&gt;Bridget Kulakauskas, [http://www.illiterarty.com/genre-airport-novel Genre: ''Airport novel''] at illiterarty.com, no date; accessed Mar. 26, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

On this theme, the animated television series ''[[The Simpsons]]'' included a joke in the episode "[[The Joy of Sect]]" (airdate February 8, 1998), in which an airport bookstore is named "JUST [[Michael Crichton|CRICHTON]] AND [[Stephen King|KING]]".  [[Hans Moleman]] asks, "Do you have anything by [[Robert Ludlum]]?" and is immediately told by the clerk to get out.&lt;ref name="The Joy of Sect"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.snpp.com/episodes/5F23|work=The Simpsons|date=February 8, 1998|title=The Joy of Sect|access-date=2013-07-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011107142518/http://www.snpp.com/episodes/5F23|archive-date=2001-11-07|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9476">Saint '''Asterius of Amasea''' (c. 350{{snd}}c. 410 AD)&lt;ref name=Vnova/&gt; was made [[Bishop of Amasea]] between 380 and 390 AD, after having been a lawyer.&lt;ref name="Vnova"&gt;
  "Writers from the time of Augustine", Villanova.edu.
  (''see below:'' References).
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AA"&gt;
  "Asterius of Amasea, Sermons (1904). Preface to
  the online edition", Roger Pearse (translator),
  Ipswich, UK, December 2003, webpage:
  [http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/fathers/asterius_00_eintro.html  ECWritings-Aste].
&lt;/ref&gt; He was born in [[Cappadocia]] and probably died in [[Amasya|Amasea]] in modern Turkey, then in [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]].  Significant portions of his lively sermons survive, which are especially interesting from the point of view of [[art history]], and social life in his day.  Asterius, Bishop of Amasea is not to be confused with the Arian polemicist, [[Asterius the Sophist]].&lt;ref name=AA/&gt; His feast day is Oct. 30.&lt;ref&gt;http://catholicsaints.mobi/calendar/30-october.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and work==

Asterius of Amasea was the younger contemporary of [[Amphilochius of Iconium]] and the three great [[Cappadocian Fathers]].&lt;ref name=AA/&gt;  Little is known about his life, except that he was educated by a [[Scythians|Scythian]] slave.  Like Amphilochius, he had been a lawyer before becoming bishop between 380 and 390 AD, and he brought the skills of the professional [[rhetoric]]ian to his sermons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/fathers/asterius_00_intro.html Introduction to his sermons]&lt;/ref&gt;  Sixteen homilies and [[panegyric]]s on the martyrs still exist, showing familiarity with the classics, and containing an unusual concentration of details of everyday life in his time.  One of them, ''Oration 4: Adversus Kalendarum Festum'' attacks the pagan customs and abuses of the New Years feast, denying everything that [[Libanius]] had said supporting it&amp;nbsp;– see [[Lord of Misrule]] for extensive quotations.  That sermon was preached on January 1, 400 AD, which provides the main evidence, with a reference in another to his great age, to the dating of his career.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/fathers/asterius_00_intro.html Introduction]&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Oration 11, On the martyrdom of St. Euphemia'', Asterius describes a painting of the martyrdom and compares it to pictures made by the famous pre-Christian [[Hellenistic]] painters [[Euphranor]] and [[Timomachus]];&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-N6u74StgmUC&amp;pg=PA465&amp;dq=Asterius+Amasea+Nicea+images#PPA465,M1 Google books partial translation] Castelli, Elizabeth A; in ''Religions of Late Antiquity in Practice'', Ed Richard Valantasis, Princeton University Press, 2000, {{ISBN|0-691-05751-6}}, {{ISBN|978-0-691-05751-4}}
&lt;/ref&gt; the speech was quoted twice in the [[Second Council of Nicaea]] in 787, which concluded the period of [[Byzantine iconoclasm]], as evidence in favour of the [[Icon|veneration of images]].&lt;ref name=AA/&gt; As described, the [[icon]] was on [[canvas]], and displayed in a church near her tomb; it has puzzled historians, as the manner of death, from fire, differs from all other accounts in the tradition.  It is an exceptionally detailed ''[[ekphrasis]]'', or description of a work of art, from this period, although scholars have wondered how well the description matched an actual work.&lt;ref&gt;See Castelli&lt;/ref&gt;  The intended audience is uncertain, though it was apparently all-male, as they are addressed as "gentlemen" (''andres'').  In Oration 1, ''On the [[Dives and Lazarus|Rich Man and Lazarus]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/fathers/asterius_01_sermon1.html Online English text]&lt;/ref&gt; he objects to [[Byzantine clothing|richly decorated clothes]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;  through vain devices and vicious desires, you seek out fine linen, and gather the [[History of silk|threads of the Persian worms]] and weave the spider's airy web;&lt;ref&gt;This is [[hyperbole]], built upon the preceding [[Periphrasis|periphrastic]] description of [[silk]]&lt;/ref&gt; and going to the dyer, pay large prices in order that he may fish the shell-fish out of the sea and stain the garment with the blood of the creature,&lt;ref&gt;See [[Tyrian purple]].&lt;/ref&gt; ----this is the act of a man surfeited, who misuses his substance, having no place to pour out the superfluity of his wealth. For this in the Gospel such a man is scourged, being portrayed as stupid and womanish, adorning himself with the embellishments of wretched girls.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Clothes decorated with religious images, worn by laymen it seems, are also condemned:&lt;blockquote&gt;having found some idle and extravagant style of weaving, which by the twining of the warp and the woof, produces the effect of a picture,&lt;ref&gt;[[Tapestry]]; [[The Hestia Tapestry]] is a 6th-century Byzantine tapestry.&lt;/ref&gt; and imprints upon their robes the forms of all creatures, they artfully produce, both for themselves and for their wives and children, clothing beflowered and wrought with ten thousand objects....You may see the wedding of Galilee, and the water-pots; the paralytic carrying his bed on his shoulders; the blind man being healed with the clay; the woman with the bloody issue, taking hold of the  border of the garment; the sinful woman falling at the feet of Jesus; Lazarus returning to life from the grave. In doing this they consider that they are acting piously and are clad in garments pleasing to God. But if they take my advice let them sell those clothes and honor the living image of God. Do not picture Christ on your garments. It is enough that he once suffered the humiliation of dwelling in a human body which of his own accord he assumed for our sakes. So, not upon your robes but upon your soul carry about his image.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Other interesting details of the lifestyle of the rich are mentioned in condemnation.  The apparent contradiction of these positions confused Arnold Hauser, in his famous ''The Social History of Art'', into wrongly claiming Asterius as an [[iconoclasm|Iconoclast]],&lt;ref&gt;The Social History of Art [https://books.google.com/books?id=z9xlfxVqdNIC&amp;pg=PA125&amp;lpg=PA125&amp;dq=Asterius+of+Amasia&amp;source=web&amp;ots=qm2vpXD0e9&amp;sig=NJvPXX72UlTk_xoXDKyzgHU6uok&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=1c6QSe62FpiL-gaH8uWJCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ct=result Online text]&lt;/ref&gt; but his objection to images on clothes is on the grounds of expense and frivolity.

==Texts==
Of Asterius's work, 16 homilies survive, and [[Photios]] lists four more. Some of these speeches have survived in medieval Latin, Georgian, and Church Slavonic translations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Kazhdan|editor1-first=Alexander P.|title=The Oxford dictionary of Byzantium|date=1991|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-504652-8|page=213|chapter=Asterios of Amaseia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An English translation exists of five sermons by Asterius, which were published in 1904 in the US under the title ''"Ancient Sermons for Modern Times"'', and issued as a reprint in 2007.  This is the main portion of his works to exist in English, and has been transcribed online.&lt;ref name=AA/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Ancient-Sermons-for-Modern-Times-by-Asterius-Bishop-of-Amasia-Circa-375-405-a-D/Galusha-Anderson/e/9780548332214 Barnes &amp; Noble details]&lt;/ref&gt;  Oration 11 has also been translated.&lt;ref&gt;In the article by Castelli, referenced above.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other sermons by Asterius of Amasea existed in the time of [[Photius]], who referred to a further ten sermons not now known in [[Bibliotheca (Photius)|Bibliotheca]] codex 271.&lt;ref name=AA/&gt;  One of these lost sermons indicates that Asterius lived to a great age.&lt;ref name=AA/&gt;

[[Philip Rubens]], brother of the painter, produced an edition of the homilies, published posthumously in a memorial volume after his death in 1611, together with a short biography of Philip, a selection of Latin poems that he had written, and Latin poems written in his memory by his friends.

Fourteen genuine sermons have been printed by [[Migne]] in the ''Patrologia Graeca'' 40, 155-480, with a [[Latin language|Latin]] translation.&lt;ref name=AA/&gt; along with other sermons "by Asterius" that were written by [[Asterius the Sophist]].  Another two genuine sermons were discovered in manuscript  at [[Mount Athos]] by M. Bauer. Those two were first printed by A. Bretz (TU 40.1, 1914).  Eleven sermons have also been translated into German.&lt;ref name=AA/&gt;

[[File:Bayeux Tapestry in the museum.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Bayeux Tapestry]] in its museum in [[Bayeux]], [[France]].]]

The '''Bayeux Tapestry tituli''' are captions embroidered on the [[Bayeux Tapestry]] describing events leading up to the [[Norman conquest of England]] concerning [[William the Conqueror|William, Duke of Normandy]], and [[Harold Godwinson|Harold, Earl of Wessex, later King of England]], and culminating in the [[Battle of Hastings]]. The ''[[tituli]]'' are in [[Medieval Latin]].

==Description==

[[File:Bayeux tapestry stitches detail..jpg|thumb|Detail of embroidered lettering]]

The Bayeux Tapestry was probably commissioned by William the Conqueror's half-brother, [[Odo of Bayeux|Bishop Odo]], possibly at the same time as [[Bayeux Cathedral]]'s construction in the 1070s, and completed by 1077 in time for display on the cathedral's dedication.&lt;ref name=stenton&gt;[[#Stenton|Stenton (1961)]].&lt;/ref&gt; It is embroidered in [[wool]] [[yarn]] on a [[plain weave|tabby-woven]] [[linen]] ground using [[backstitch|outline or stem stitch]] for detailing and lettering.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Coatsworth|Coatsworth (2005)]], p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mussetb|Musset (2011)]], p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; 
A dark blue wool, almost black, is used for most of the tapestry's lettering but towards the end other colours are used, sometimes for each word and other times for each letter.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

The content of the hanging is primarily pictorial but ''tituli'' are included on many scenes of the action to point out names of people and places or to explain briefly the event being depicted.&lt;ref name=musset&gt;[[#Mussetb|Musset (2011)]].&lt;/ref&gt; The text is in Latin (which for the most part is grammatically correct), and is extremely direct, with each statement being closely tied to the scenes depicted in a given section.&lt;ref name=musset35/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mussetb|Musset (2011)]], p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; The text is frequently abbreviated as indicated by [[tilde]]s placed over words at the place of omission of a letter. The words themselves are often demarcated by two points (which Lucien Musset likens to colons); sometimes, more important section breaks are demarcated by three points. Many personal names, mostly in English, are not Latinised and the same applies for names of places in England and for Beaurain "Belrem" in France. In places the spelling shows an English influence, such as the phrase "at Hestenga ceasrta", which in proper Latin would be "ad Hastingae castra").&lt;ref name=musset35&gt;[[#Mussetb|Musset (2011)]], p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Some French names are either archaic ("Rednes") or anglicised ("Bagias").&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mussetb|Musset (2011)]], pp. 35{{en dash}}6.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes "Franci" is used to describe the Normans who at that time certainly did not regard themselves as French.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mussetb|Musset (2011)]], p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

The end of the tapestry has been missing from time immemorial and the final ''titulus'' "Et fuga verterunt Angli" is said by Lucien Musset to be "entirely spurious", added shortly before 1814 at a time of anti-English sentiment.&lt;ref name=spurious2/&gt; The first word on the tapestry "Edward" is also a restoration.&lt;ref name=spurious1/&gt;

==Latin text with English translation==

The English translation provided here is of a literal nature, to reflect the simplicity of the captions themselves. The numbering scheme uses the scene numbers on the tapestry's backing cloth, which were added sometime around 1800.&lt;ref name=musset /&gt;

'''''Becoming Jane''''' is a 2007 British-Irish [[biographical film|biographical]] [[Romance film|romantic]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] directed by [[Julian Jarrold]]. It depicts the early life of the English author [[Jane Austen]] and her lasting love for [[Thomas Langlois Lefroy]]. American actress [[Anne Hathaway]] stars as the title character, while her romantic interest is played by Scottish actor [[James McAvoy]]. Also appearing in the film are [[Julie Walters]], [[James Cromwell]] and [[Maggie Smith]]. The film was produced in cooperation with several companies, including [[Ecosse Films]] and [[Graham Broadbent#Career|Blueprint Pictures]]. It also received funding from the [[Irish Film Board]] and the [[UK Film Council]] Premiere Fund.

The film is partly based on the 2003 book ''[[Becoming Jane Austen]]'' by [[Jon Hunter Spence]], who was also hired as historical consultant. The final screenplay, developed by [[Sarah Williams (screenwriter)|Sarah Williams]] and [[Kevin Hood]], pieced together some known facts about Austen into a coherent story, in what co-producer [[Graham Broadbent]] called "our own Austenesque landscape." According to Hood, he attempted to weave together "what we know about Austen's world from her books and letters," and believed Austen's personal life was the inspiration for ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]''.&lt;ref name=writingstudio/&gt; Jarrold began production of the film in early 2006, opting to shoot primarily in Ireland as he found it had better-preserved locations than [[Hampshire]], England, where Austen was raised.

Released firstly in the United Kingdom on 9 March 2007 and in other countries later in the year, ''Becoming Jane'' earned approximately $37 million worldwide. The film received mixed reviews from critics. Hathaway's performance received mixed critical reception, with some reviewers negatively focusing on her nationality and accent. Commentators and scholars have analysed the presence of Austen characters and themes within the film, and also noted the implementation of [[mass marketing]] in the film's release.

==Plot==
Jane Austen is the younger daughter of the Reverend George Austen and his wife and has yet to find a suitable husband. She aspires to be a writer, to the dismay of her mother and proud delight of her father.

Thomas Lefroy is a promising lawyer with a bad reputation, which he describes as "typical" for people in the profession. Tom makes a terrible first impression upon meeting Jane, when he nearly falls asleep while she gives a reading of her work for the company. Overhearing his subsequent criticism, Jane cannot stand the arrogant Irishman. Meanwhile, she turns down the affections of other men, including Mr. Wisley, the nephew and heir of the wealthy Lady Gresham. Wisley proposes but Jane ultimately rejects him due to lack of affection. The mischievous Tom encounters Jane again; they argue but increasingly take interest in each other and Tom demonstrates that he takes Jane's literary aspirations seriously. In time they fall in love.

Tom, Jane, her brother Henry and Jane's rich widowed cousin, Eliza, Comtesse de Feullide, conspire to receive an invitation from Tom's uncle and benefactor, the Lord Chief Judge Langlois of London, for the rich "Madame La Comtesse" and her friends. This visit is meant to be a short break in their journey to see Jane's brother, Edward. This would allow Judge Langlois to get to know Jane before and give a blessing for their marriage. Full of hope, Jane cannot sleep during the night at the Judge's place. In a flow of inspiration, she then begins the writing of ''First Impressions'', the manuscript that will become ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]''.

However, Judge Langlois receives a letter informing him of the genteel poverty of Jane's family and he refuses to give Tom his blessing, declaring that he would wish Tom to be the whoremonger he had been rather than allow him to live in poverty because of a bad marriage. Tom tells Jane that he cannot marry her and she is crushed, not knowing that Tom has a legitimate reason; his family depends on him financially.

Jane returns home and soon learns that Tom has become engaged to someone else at the arrangement of his family. Jane accepts the marriage proposal of Mr. Wisley, whom she had earlier declined. Later, Tom realises he cannot live without Jane, and returns, asking Jane to run away with him, for "what value will there be in life, if we are not together?" Jane agrees, and they leave, with only Jane's sister Cassandra knowing they plan to marry in secret.

On the way, Jane stumbles upon a letter from Tom's mother, and realises his situation: he sends money he receives from his uncle back to his parents and siblings, and his family cannot survive without it. She tells Tom that they cannot elope, not with so many people depending upon him. He insists that he and Jane must marry and tells her he will earn money, but Jane tells him that it will not be enough; he will never be able to make enough money to support his dependents with a High Court judge (his uncle) as an enemy and with a penniless wife. Distraught, Tom asks her if she loves him, and she replies, "Yes, but if our love destroys your family, then it will destroy itself, in a long, slow degradation of guilt and regret and blame." As she leaves, Jane catches a last glimpse of Tom through the carriage window as he briefly follows, the horses outpacing him.

Twenty years later, Jane, now a successful author and by choice unmarried, sees Tom during a gathering. Henry, now married to Eliza, brings Tom to her. Tom introduces his eldest daughter, who admires Jane's novels. Tom's daughter asks Jane to read aloud, but as Jane rarely does so he remonstrates with his daughter using her name, which is also Jane. Astonished that he named his eldest after her, Jane agrees to read. The last scene shows Tom's daughter sitting by Jane as she reads aloud from ''Pride and Prejudice'', while Tom watches Jane affectionately. As she concludes, their eyes meet, and Tom joins the rest of the company in honouring Jane and her work with applause.

In 2004, screenwriter [[Sarah Williams (screenwriter)|Sarah Williams]] approached [[Douglas Rae (TV executive)|Douglas Rae]] and Robert Bernstein of [[Ecosse Films]] with the intention of creating a film about the life of [[Jane Austen]], a popular eighteenth century English novelist.&lt;ref name=writingstudio/&gt;&lt;ref name="williams"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/3663235/Not-so-plain-Jane.html |first=Sally |last=Williams |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] | title=Not so plain Jane | date=17 February 2007 | accessdate=12 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Williams had recently read ''[[Becoming Jane Austen]]'', a 2003 biography that largely pieced together several known facts, such as Austen's meeting [[Thomas Langlois Lefroy|Tom Lefroy]] on Christmas 1795, into a coherent story about unrequited love. Bernstein agreed to adapt the work, believing that it depicted "a pivotal relationship in Jane Austen's early life that was largely unknown to the public."&lt;ref name=writingstudio&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.writingstudio.co.za/page1718.html |title=The Art of Adaptation: Becoming Jane |work=The Writing Studio |accessdate=15 July 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024221712/http://www.writingstudio.co.za/page1718.html |archive-date=24 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book's author, [[Jon Hunter Spence]], was hired as a historical consultant on the film,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Deborah| last=Cartmell |title=Screen Adaptations: Jane Austen's ''Pride and Prejudice'': A Close Study of the Relationship between Text and Film |publisher=A&amp;C Black Publishers Ltd |year=2010 |isbn=1-4081-0593-4 |ref=harv |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Screen_Adaptations_Jane_Austen_s_Pride_a.html?id=J6TG62AsSJQC |page=120 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Higson185&gt;{{cite book|first=Andrew| last=Higson|title=Film England: Culturally English Filmmaking Since the 1990s |publisher=I.B. Tauris |year=2011 |isbn=1-84885-454-4 |page=185}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the task of "see[ing] that, given that the 'story' is a work of imagination, the factual material was as accurate as possible within the limitations of the story."&lt;ref name=writingstudio/&gt;

After Williams completed several drafts of the screenplay, the company hired [[Kevin Hood]] to aid in further script development. Bernstein believed that Hood's past work contained "a romantic sensibility... There is a poetic quality about his writing as well as there being a rigorous emotional truth which I thought was important for Jane."&lt;ref name=writingstudio/&gt; Hood was attracted to the film because he believed "the story is such an important one and very much the inspiration for ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]''."&lt;ref name=writingstudio/&gt; Calling Austen a "genius" and "one of the top two or three prose writers of all time", Hood thought that her relationship with Lefroy "was absolutely essential in shaping her work."&lt;ref name=writingstudio/&gt; Hood acknowledged however that ''Becoming Jane'' is "based on the facts as they are known and the majority of characters did exist, as did many of the situations and circumstances in the film. Some have been fictionalised, weaving together what we know about Austen's world from her books and letters, creating a rich Austenite landscape."&lt;ref name=writingstudio/&gt;

[[Julian Jarrold]] became attached to direct the film in early 2005.&lt;ref name=writingstudio/&gt; It was his second feature film, after ''[[Kinky Boots (film)|Kinky Boots]]'', which was released later that year.&lt;ref name=JarroldIFTN&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iftn.ie/news/?act1=record&amp;only=1&amp;aid=73&amp;rid=4280085&amp;tpl=archnews&amp;force=1 |title=Julian Jarrold On 'Becoming Jane' |publisher=Irish Film &amp; Television Network |date=15 March 2007 |accessdate=2 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bernstein, he "liked [Jarrold's] style as it was modern and visceral, and I just had a feeling that he was the right choice. This piece needed to be handed with delicacy but also with a certain amount of brio and Julian was able to bring those two things to the production."&lt;ref name=writingstudio/&gt; The director began work on the project in early 2006, rereading the novels ''Pride and Prejudice'', ''[[Sense and Sensibility]]'', and ''[[Persuasion (novel)|Persuasion]]'' and also reviewing Austen biographies such as Spence's book. Jarrold depended most heavily on the script, calling it "a rich, witty and clever screenplay from someone who obviously knew his subject very well. It is a love story but much more besides. Kevin's screenplay has so many layers and interesting ideas. Apart from the love story I was very attracted by the themes of imagination and experience."&lt;ref name=writingstudio/&gt; The director intended to "bring Austen up to date by roughening her up a bit" and adding "more life and energy and fun," opining that past Austen adaptations had been "a little bit picture-postcard and safe and sweet and nice."&lt;ref name=Higson185/&gt;

===Casting===
[[File:Anne Hathaway at MIFF.jpg|left|thumb|200px|[[Anne Hathaway]] focused on learning an English accent, believing that if she "didn't get that right, the rest of the performance wouldn't matter because people would write me off in the first five minutes."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-1314809771.html |title=From princess to pauper |work=[[Winnipeg Free Press]] |via=[[HighBeam Research]] |first=Randall |last=King |date=4 August 2007 |accessdate=26 July 2012}} {{Subscription needed}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Jarrold sought to make ''Becoming Jane'' "look and feel" realistic "so everything is not lit in a very glamorous Hollywood way."&lt;ref name="felce"/&gt; According to him, "One of the key ideas in the film was to get away from the old, stuffy costume drama kind of feel of what Jane Austen is and to look at somebody before she becomes a genius, when she is in her early twenties and on the verge of writing her great thing; she had a real exuberance for life, intelligent and independent and a sort of outsider in rural Hampshire, more intelligent than the people around her and kicking against all those pressures."&lt;ref name="felce"/&gt; To further set his film apart from other costume dramas, American actress [[Anne Hathaway]] was cast as the title character. A fan of [[Jane Austen]] since she was fourteen, Hathaway immediately began rereading Austen's books, conducting historical research including perusing the author's letters, and also learned sign language, calligraphy, dance choreography, and playing the piano. She moved to England a month before production began to improve her English accent, and attempted to stay in character throughout filming, the first time she had done so for a movie.&lt;ref name="felce"/&gt;

[[File:James McAvoy Cannes 2014.jpg|[[James McAvoy]] stars as Thomas Langlois Lefroy.|thumb|200px]]

There were concerns in some quarters that the American Hathaway was playing a beloved English writer. [[James McAvoy]], who plays [[Thomas Langlois Lefroy]], believed that filming in Ireland made her casting "a bit safer" than if they had shot in England. McAvoy accepted the role because he enjoyed Austen's writings and was eager to work with Jarrold, having collaborated with him previously on the 2002 television production ''[[White Teeth#Television adaptation|White Teeth]]''.&lt;ref name=LevineMarch7/&gt; McAvoy first assumed that ''Becoming Jane'' would be directly associated with ''Pride and Prejudice'', with his character possessing similarities with [[Mr. Darcy]]; the actor soon realised however "that the screenplay was nothing like ''Pride and Prejudice''. The screenwriter probably speculated on some of the inspiration for ''Pride and Prejudice'' but it is a completely different story."&lt;ref name=writingstudio/&gt;

[[Julie Walters]] had once disliked Austen's writings but changed her mind when she read ''Pride and Prejudice'' after receiving her role as Mrs. Austen.&lt;ref name=LevineMarch7&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/movies/interviews/a43620/becoming-jane-james-mcavoy-julie-walters.html |publisher=[[Digital Spy]] |title='Becoming Jane': James McAvoy, Julie Walters |first=Nick |last=Levine |date=7 March 2007 |accessdate=6 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Appearing as Mr. Austen was actor [[James Cromwell]], who viewed his character as "a generous gentleman, well educated and supportive of Jane for the most part. He is bedevilled by his financial circumstances but deeply in love with his wife and sympathetic to her concerns about what will happen to the girls if they don't marry."&lt;ref name=writingstudio/&gt; [[Joe Anderson (actor)|Joe Anderson]] portrayed Henry Austen, while [[Lucy Cohu]] played the widowed [[Eliza de Feuillide]], the Austens' worldly cousin and Henry's romantic interest. Cohu believed that her character "needs security. She is looking to be safe. She finds that security with Henry as she knows the Austen family."&lt;ref name=writingstudio/&gt;

[[Anna Maxwell Martin]] appeared as Jane's sister [[Cassandra Austen|Cassandra]]. The actress called her character "terribly sensible", noting that she "gets her heart broken. It's very sad. She's the levelling force for Jane Austen, the wild one. She tries to get her back in line, but fails miserably."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-3740808.html |work=[[The Independent]] |via=[[HighBeam Research]] |title='My dream is to go to the country and build an eco-friendly house' |first=Elisa |last=Bray |date=12 March 2007 |accessdate=26 July 2012}} {{Subscription needed}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Becoming Jane'' also featured [[Laurence Fox]] as Mr. Wisley and Dame [[Maggie Smith]] as Lady Gresham, whom Jarrold viewed as possessing "similarities to Lady Catherine De Burgh in ''Pride and Prejudice'' but in this film you get to see her hidden vulnerabilities – the pain of never having had children and her controlling maternal power over Wisley."&lt;ref name=writingstudio/&gt; Other cast members included [[Ian Richardson]] as Judge Langlois, [[Leo Bill]] as John Warren, Jessica Ashworth as Lucy Lefroy, Michael James Ford as Mr. Lefroy, Tom Vaughan-Lawlor as Robert Fowle, and [[Helen McCrory]] as [[Ann Radcliffe|Mrs. Radcliffe]].&lt;ref name="elley"/&gt;

===Costume design===
[[File:Becoming Jane costume display.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A costume from the film worn by Anne Hathaway.]]
Irish costume designer [[Eimer Ní Mhaoldomhnaigh]] designed the clothing seen in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/lifestyle/the-day-i-dressed-colin-farrell-2208938.html |work=[[The Independent]] |title=The day I dressed Colin Farrell . . . |date=5 June 2010 |accessdate=27 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She attempted to create a different style of costumes than had been seen in recent Austen adaptations, and drew inspiration from the [[1795–1820 in fashion|fashions of the 1790s]], a time period she considered "fascinating" and a "very transitional era in terms of fashion... it was a real challenge to make it work."&lt;ref name=writingstudio/&gt; Ní Mhaoldhomhnaigh attended the [[2006 Cannes Film Festival|Cannes Film Festival]] in May 2006 but then had to quickly return to the ''Becoming Jane'' set to complete the last two days of filming.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-24840002.html |work=[[The Irish Times]] |via=[[HighBeam Research]] |title='Brokeback' gets Minister's seal of approval |date=27 May 2006 |accessdate=27 July 2012}} {{Subscription needed}}&lt;/ref&gt; She later collaborated with Jarrold in the 2008 drama film ''[[Brideshead Revisited (film)|Brideshead Revisited]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-16999110.html |work=[[Pittsburgh Tribune-Review]] |via=[[HighBeam Research]] |title='Brideshead' revisits costumed excess of aristocracy |first=Valli |last=Herman |date=11 August 2008 |accessdate=27 July 2012}} {{Subscription needed}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For research, Ní Mhaoldhomhnaigh visited museums and art galleries, and also read Austen's letters and novels. She was interested in both the effects of continental fashions on English clothing and the differences between social classes.&lt;ref name=writingstudio/&gt; While she recognised that 1795 "marked the beginning" of the [[empire silhouette|empire waistline]] trend, Ní Mhaoldhomhnaigh also understood this fashion would have barely been introduced to Austen's circle in the country; rather, the film displayed many costume designs from the [[1775–95 in fashion|early 1790s]]. She explained, "We wanted to show that transition especially for the women. The look in London is very different from the look in the countryside. For the country ball the fashion for the older women is more of the old style but for the younger women we show the introduction of the Empire line."&lt;ref name=writingstudio/&gt;

The costume designer created all of Hathaway's outfits from scratch, and "looked for images of a young Jane Austen."&lt;ref name=writingstudio/&gt; Ní Mhaoldhomhnaigh explained, "I wanted to get her youthfulness and innocence across through her dress. But crucially there was also her strength of character. So we kept away from frills and flounces. I wanted a definite look that was quite strong but also pretty at the same time. Jane was living on a working farm so her dress had to be practical as well. In terms of the costume we were definitely trying to steer away from the chocolate box image that we associate with Jane Austen."&lt;ref name=writingstudio/&gt;

Ní Mhaoldhomhnaigh dressed McAvoy in rich fabrics, such as velvet and [[beaver]] fur, to help distinguish him from the other men. She recalled that "he wears very stylish waist coats and cut-away jackets. With Jane around he'd have an extra swagger in front of her. James (McAvoy) was really into it. We'd talk about the colours and fabrics to achieve his distinctive look."&lt;ref name=writingstudio/&gt; Ní Mhaoldhomhnaigh and Maggie Smith agreed that Lady Gresham's dresses would be modelled after [[1750–75 in fashion|1770s]] fashion, which was "the sort of dress that the character would have worn when she was much younger and suited her back then. Lady Gresham is very much her own character and is not someone who is dictated to by fashion."&lt;ref name=writingstudio/&gt; Smith's dresses contained stiff fabrics "to emphasise a woman who was very set in her ways".&lt;ref name=writingstudio/&gt;

===Filming===
Produced independently by Ecosse,&lt;ref name="JarroldIFTN" /&gt; ''Becoming Jane'' was given a limited budget of €12.7 million (£9 million or $16.5 million).&lt;ref name="williams"/&gt;&lt;ref name=irishfilmboard&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.irishfilmboard.ie/irish_film_industry/news/Becoming_Jane_in_Irish_cinemas_this_weekend/513 |title=Becoming Jane in Irish cinemas this weekend |publisher=[[Irish Film Board]] |date=13 March 2007 |accessdate=11 July 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160113122625/http://www.irishfilmboard.ie/irish_film_industry/news/Becoming_Jane_in_Irish_cinemas_this_weekend/513 |archive-date=13 January 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/2007/BJANE.php |title=Becoming Jane |publisher=The Numbers|accessdate=1 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Production designer Eve Stewart researched Regency literature and Austen's life, and along with Jarrold, scouted locations in Dublin and nearby counties for five weeks in January and February 2006.&lt;ref name=writingstudio/&gt; They ultimately opted to shoot in Dublin and the [[Counties of Ireland|Irish counties]] of [[County Meath|Meath]] and [[County Wicklow|Wicklow]] instead of [[Hampshire]], the birthplace of Austen,&lt;ref name=JarroldIFTN/&gt; because it held "a sense of countryside that felt more unchanged," while Hampshire had unfortunately become too "groomed and manicured".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.thedubliner.ie/the_dubliner_magazine/2008/02/dublin-but-not.html |work=The Dubliner |title=Dublin, but not as we know it |first=Eleanor |last=Fitzsimons |date=5 February 2008 |accessdate=6 July 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120424085537/http://www.thedubliner.ie/the_dubliner_magazine/2008/02/dublin-but-not.html |archive-date=24 April 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jarrold also found "a great variety of Georgian houses and older houses" in Ireland.&lt;ref name="felce"/&gt; His production received funds from the [[Irish Film Board]],&lt;ref name="felce"/&gt; the [[UK Film Council]] Premiere Fund,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ukfilmcouncil.eu/awards?awardid=10488 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029201215/http://ukfilmcouncil.eu/awards?awardid=10488 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=29 October 2013 |title=Awards database |publisher=UK Film Council Lottery |accessdate=9 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Higson, pp. 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt; [[2 Entertain]], Scion Films, and [[Miramax Films]].&lt;ref name=Minister12April/&gt; Film critic [[Andrew Sarris]] noted that in Ireland "happily, there are still architectural traces of life more than 200 years ago to correspond with the year 1795."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://observer.com/2007/07/austen-in-love/ |work=[[The Observer]] |title=Austen in Love |first=Andrew |last=Sarris |authorlink=Andrew Sarris |date=31 July 2007 |accessdate=6 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Ireland did include a few disadvantages: Stewart found that "the rural aspects were the most difficult as the Irish country landscape is nothing like Hampshire. There are no rolling hills so the vegetation and the landscaping was the trickiest thing for me as a production designer."&lt;ref name=writingstudio/&gt;

[[File:HENRIETTA STREET - DUBLIN (402556531).jpg|left|thumb|280px|[[Henrietta Street, Dublin|Henrietta Street]] in Dublin was used to represent Regency London.]]
Due to its low budget,&lt;ref name=JarroldIFTN/&gt; ''Becoming Jane'' was filmed on a "tight" schedule of eight weeks&lt;ref name=irishfilmboard/&gt; from March to May 2006.&lt;ref name=writingstudio/&gt; Jarrold observed however that because Ecosse was not a [[film studio]], he had more creative freedom.&lt;ref name=JarroldIFTN/&gt; Bernstein stated of filming, "We recreated a world that Jane Austen lovers can recognise and associate with. But hopefully we can also take them into areas and places like the boxing club, the cricket game and the fair that do not feature in Jane Austen's fiction. They are sort of seedy and dangerous areas that are not normally associated with Austen."&lt;ref name=writingstudio/&gt; Jarrold found filming "very difficult. We had to make it work in the locations that we had as efficiently as possible."&lt;ref name="felce"/&gt; Filming outdoors was often so cold that Hathaway turned blue and had difficulty saying her lines; [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|Automated Dialogue Replacement]] in post-production helped correct this by re-dubbing her lines.&lt;ref name="felce"/&gt;

The story's central location was set at Steventon [[rectory]] where Austen was raised.&lt;ref name=writingstudio/&gt; While it had been demolished in 1824,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DV_DfmN9UDUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=jane+austen+life&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=f4eHqTeu1D&amp;sig=bmoL_d06nQ1xuwRiwXZZa9WZb7c&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=q2wTUObqA5SY8gTXs4HQCQ&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA#v=snippet&amp;q=1824&amp;f=false |title=Jane Austen: A Life |first=Claire |last=Tomalin |year=1999 |publisher=Vintage |ISBN=0679766766 |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jarrold and his crew "fortunately found a wonderful house that was very like the original... We honed the script as well to make it as practical as possible."&lt;ref name="felce"/&gt; Stewart believed that the Austen house expressed their status and wealth, "I think that you will lose the central thrust of the story unless you understand the status of the Austen's and that they are pretty poor. Jane spent all her formative years there and that was the place that influenced her view of the world. You have to believe that the family live in that house because that is a crucial piece of the jigsaw."&lt;ref name=writingstudio/&gt; Scenes at Steventon rectory were filmed in Higginsbrook House, a few miles off [[Trim, County Meath|Trim]] in County Meath.&lt;ref name="byrne"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/property/2007/0308/1173121314890.html |first=Robert |last=O'Byrne|work=The Irish Times  | title=How Higginsbrook became Jane's house | date=3 March 2007 | accessdate=12 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in fall 2006, it appeared again as the house of the Morlands in ''[[Northanger Abbey (2007 film)|Northanger Abbey]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iftn.ie/locationsireland/irishlocationsregion/sublinks_static1/meath/locationsbycounty/?act1=record&amp;aid=90&amp;rid=64&amp;only=1&amp;tpl=archive3locations&amp;force=1 |publisher=Irish Film and Television Network |title=Higginsbrook House, Meath |accessdate=26 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-160284144.html|title=Abbey days for Jane Austen's 'Irish Home'|date=8 March 2007|work=[[Evening Herald]] |first=Aoife|last=Finneran|accessdate=7 July 2012}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A house on Henrietta Street also provided the filming site for Mrs. Radcliffe's residence. Gentleman Jackson's club, where Lefroy boxes, was represented by "the dark and otherworldly" Mother Redcaps tavern, also in Dublin.&lt;ref name=writingstudio/&gt;

The [[Film score|musical score of the film]] was written by English composer [[Adrian Johnston (musician)|Adrian Johnston]]. To prepare melodies, he reviewed music books that had belonged to the Austen family.&lt;ref name=Moritareview/&gt; The first track, "First Impressions", has been described as a "depressing"&lt;ref name=Newton3Aug/&gt; song that "exhibits slow, pure and classical piano work";&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thecelebritycafe.com/cd/full_review/12965.html |work=The Celebrity Cafe |title=Becoming Jane Soundtrack |first=Sari N. |last=Kent |date=4 August 2007 |accessdate=31 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090415204008/http://thecelebritycafe.com/cd/full_review/12965.html |archivedate=15 April 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; one critic quipped that it belonged in "''Becoming [[Sylvia Plath]]&amp;thinsp;''". Later tracks ranged "in mood from upbeat and playful to somber and teary."&lt;ref name=Newton3Aug&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0803/p13s01-almp.html |work=[[The Christian Science Monitor]] |title=Noteworthy CD releases |first=Robert |last=Newton |date=3 August 2007 |accessdate=31 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his review of the score, Tim Clark of [[Soundtrack.net]] lamented the "absence of a truly memorable theme, despite a wealth of thematic material," and found similarities to [[Dario Marianelli]]'s [[Pride &amp; Prejudice (soundtrack)|composition]] for the 2005 film ''[[Pride &amp; Prejudice (2005 film)|Pride &amp; Prejudice]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.soundtrack.net/albums/database/?id=4564 |title=Becoming Jane (2007) Soundtrack |first=Tim |last=Clark |publisher=[[Soundtrack.net]] |date=13 March 2008 |accessdate=26 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Patsy Morita, a music critic for ''[[Allmusic]]'', wrote that the second half of Johnston's score becomes as "unremarkable" as "so many other dramatic film scores of the early twenty-first century."&lt;ref name=Moritareview/&gt; She continued, "It fulfills its purpose of underscoring the emotion of the story by being moody and slow to change melodically and harmonically, and by using many pregnant pauses and minimalist-leaning repetitive figures."&lt;ref name=Moritareview/&gt; Morita added that "there is nothing in it to draw attention away from the film."&lt;ref name=Moritareview&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/becoming-jane-mw0000481538 |title=Becoming Jane |first=Patsy |last=Morita |work=[[Allmusic]] |accessdate=26 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The score later received a nomination for Best Original Film Score at the 2008 [[Ivor Novello Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2008/04/21/uk-ivors-nominations-idUKL2137940020080421 |title=Winehouse gets three Ivor Novello nods Soundtrack |first=Mike |last=Collett-White |work=[[Reuters]] |date=21 April 2008 |accessdate=31 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film soundtrack was released on 31 July 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://www.amazon.com/Becoming-Original-Score-Adrian-Johnston/dp/B000RIWAXU/ |title=Becoming Jane [Original Score]|publisher=[[Amazon.com]] |accessdate=31 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A track listing for the album is as follows:&lt;ref name="Moritareview" /&gt;

[[Henry Purcell]]'s "Hole in the Wall," also known as "St. Martin's Lane," which is featured in the ballroom scene, was first published in 1695 and is highly unlikely to have been common during the Regency, when Jane Austen was a young adult.&lt;ref name="holeinthewall"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kickery.com/2008/03/regency-dancers.html|title=Real Regency Dancers Don't Turn Single: Ten Tips for Judging Authenticity|date=12 March 2008|accessdate=5 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes and analysis==

===Fictionalisation of plot===
Jon Spence, the author of the biography the film was based on, identifies "Tom Lefroy as the love of Austen's life and her relationship with him as the origin of her genius. But he never suggests that there was an aborted elopement (much less subsequent reading sessions with any of Lefroy's children). And he is careful, as the filmmakers are not, to clarify that in speculating about Austen's romantic experience he is reading between the lines of the family records and of the three rather opaque Austen letters that are his principal sources."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = See Jane Elope|url = http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2007/08/see_jane_elope.html|newspaper = Slate|date = 2007-08-03|access-date = 2016-02-16|issn = 1091-2339|language = en-US|first = Deidre|last = Lynch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An important deviation of the film's plot from history is that there is scant evidence in real life Austen and Lefroy's relationship went beyond acquaintance. Rather, all that is known of them together is that they danced at three Christmas balls before Tom returned to school and that Jane was "too proud" to ask his aunt about him two years later. In the latter years of Tom Lefroy's life, he was questioned about his relationship with Jane Austen by his nephew, and admitted to having loved Jane Austen, but stated that it was a "boyish love".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Becoming Jane Austen|last = Spence|first = Jon|publisher = Hambledon Continuum|year = 2003|isbn = |location = London|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; As is written in a letter sent from T.E.P. Lefroy to James Edward Austen Leigh in 1870,&lt;blockquote&gt;My late venerable uncle ... said in so many words that he was in love with her, although he qualified his confession by saying it was a boyish love. As this occurred in a friendly &amp; private conversation, I feel some doubt whether I ought to make it public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Linda Robinson Walker|url = http://www.jasna.org/persuasions/on-line/vol27no1/walker.htm|website = www.jasna.org|access-date = 2016-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Lori Smith, author of ''The Jane Austen Guide to Life'', opined that:&lt;blockquote&gt;No doubt this relationship and her [Jane's] repartee with Tom fueled her writing. Whether it was "her greatest inspiration" as the trailers for ''Becoming Jane'' claim, well, that's debatable. But I'm sure it provided as spark.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Following Austen: 50: The truth about Jane Austen and Tom Lefroy|url = http://followingausten.blogspot.com/2007/07/50-truth-about-jane-austen-and-tom.html|access-date = 2016-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;However, contrary to the film's story line, Jane had attempted her first full-length novel before she met Tom and had already read ''[[The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling]]'' before meeting him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2007-07-31/features/0707300945_1_tom-lefroy-jane-austen-society-austen-fans |title=See Jane |work=[[Washington Post]] |date=31 July 2007|first=Monica |last=Hesse |accessdate=15 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a cut scene from the movie, it is clear that she is reading the novel for the second time, but in the theatrical release without that scene, it appears he introduces her to it.

===Representation of Austen characters in story===
Various commentators have offered opinions concerning the presence in the film of characters and themes from Austen's works, particularly with ''Pride and Prejudice''. Deborah Cartmell contended that Hathaway's Austen is a "replica of Elizabeth Bennet (with a touch of impetuous Lydia thrown in),"&lt;ref&gt;Cartmell, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; and added that the associations between Austen and Elizabeth are "more explicit than in" any other Austen biopic.&lt;ref&gt;Cartmell, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; Tim Robey of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' declared that the film took "good old ''P&amp;P''{{'}}s storyline and replace[d] Elizabeth Bennet with Austen herself [and added] a real-life pseudo-Darcy from the skimpiest of biographical evidence."&lt;ref name=Robey9March&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/filmreviews/3663636/A-touching-tribute-to-Austens-power.html |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |title=A touching tribute to Austen's power |first=Tim |last=Robey |date=9 March 2007 |accessdate=1 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''A Companion to Jane Austen'' observed that the "physicality" of Jane and Lefroy's kiss was similar to the "passionate kiss" between Elizabeth and Darcy in the 1995 serial ''[[Pride and Prejudice (1995 TV series)|Pride and Prejudice]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z68N_TXKpi8C&amp;pg=PT612&amp;dq=%22becoming+jane%22+jarrold&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zXYTUIP4NYW49gTP5YH4Ag&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22becoming%20jane%22&amp;f=false |title=A Companion to Jane Austen |first=Claudia L. |last=Johnson |author2=Clara Tuite |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |year=2012 |ISBN=0470672382}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' magazine further expressed that {{Quote|The characters peopling the young Jane’s life are plainly recognisable as the prototypes for her most celebrated characters: Walters’ anxious mother and Cromwell’s strong, fair-minded Mr. Austen are clear relatives of ''Pride &amp; Prejudice''{{'}}s Mr. and Mrs. Bennet; Smith’s aloof, disdainful dowager exemplifies the snobbery and social climbing that provide context for Austen’s romances; McAvoy’s cocksure, worldly Lefroy is the epitome of the outwardly arrogant, inwardly sensitive hero of whom Mr. Darcy is the paradigm, while Jane herself shares the wit and passion of Austen’s most beloved heroine, Lizzie Bennet.|Anna Smith, ''Empire'' magazine&lt;ref name=SmithEmpire/&gt;}}

===Place in mass marketing===
The implementation of [[mass marketing]] in the film's production and release has attracted notice from film and literary scholars. Dianne F. Sadoff writes that ''Becoming Jane'' "confirms the two-decades-long megaplexing of Jane Austen."&lt;ref name=Sadoff246&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b-8wBJaBRpMC&amp;pg=PA246&amp;dq=%22becoming+jane%22+jarrold&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zXYTUIP4NYW49gTP5YH4Ag&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22becoming%20jane%22&amp;f=false |title=Victorian Vogue: British Novels on Screen |first=Dianne F. |last=Sadoff |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |year=2009 |ISBN=0816660913 |page=246 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Andrew Higson, the film was another example of "Austen Power" and the desire of filmmakers to "exploit the possibilities of both the Austen industry and the market for literary cinema and television – and more generally, the market for 'traditional' English drama."&lt;ref&gt;Higson, p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt; While reviewing Austen adaptations of the 1990s and 2000s in her book ''Heritage Film: Nation, Genre and Representation'', author Belén Vidal viewed ''Becoming Jane'' as yet another "transformation of Austen's novels into icons of popular culture."&lt;ref name=Vidal/&gt; To Vidal, this and other productions, such as ''[[The Jane Austen Book Club (film)|The Jane Austen Book Club]]'' (2007) and ''[[Miss Austen Regrets]]'' (2008), confirmed "the generic status of the Austen phenomenon whilst dispensing with the incorporation of the literary text."&lt;ref name=Vidal&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KXsZl-ZxBO0C&amp;pg=PT25&amp;dq=%22becoming+jane%22+jarrold&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=w3cTUOD_HYWg9QTNu4GQDg&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22becoming%20jane%22%20jarrold&amp;f=false |title=Heritage Film: Nation, Genre and Representation |first=Belén |last=Vidal |publisher=Wallflower Press |year=2012 |ISBN=0231162030 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Becoming Jane'' followed a different formula than the Austen adaptations of the 1990s and attempted to draw viewers from a variety of demographic groups.&lt;ref name=Sadoff246/&gt; Hathaway's casting was intended to attract young female viewers who had enjoyed the actress in ''[[The Princess Diaries (film)|The Princess Diaries]]'' and ''[[The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Higson, p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt; According to producers, the view was that this demographic group would have been in their early teens during the release of the ''Princess'' films, making them "the right age" for Austen as 15-year-olds. Expecting ''Becoming Jane'' to be a popular film, in February 2007 [[Penguin Books]] announced new editions of six of Austen's best-known novels; their redesigned covers were intended to attract teenage readers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bxFRfvKetYwC&amp;pg=PT74&amp;dq=%22becoming+jane%22+jarrold&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=w3cTUOD_HYWg9QTNu4GQDg&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22becoming%20jane%22&amp;f=false |title=Chick Lit and Postfeminism |first=Stephanie |last=Harzewski |publisher=University of Virginia Press |year=2011 |ISBN=0813930715}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heritage and other themes===
{{Main|Heritage film}}
''Becoming Jane'' has been referred to as a heritage costume drama film, a genre which has been popular in the United States among both its audiences and its film studios. According to Andrew Higson, ''Becoming Jane'' falls into the continuing trend of American attitudes influencing English film.&lt;ref&gt;Higson, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Belén Vidal wrote that the film "exploit[s] a well-defined heritage iconography and strategically combine[s] American stars with supporting casts of international 'quality' players."&lt;ref name=Vidal/&gt; Hilary Radner analysed the presence of the "[[marriage plot]]" – a girl succeeding only by marrying the man of her choice – in film and television, and noted that while ''Becoming Jane'' critiques this film trope, it "points to the power of the traditional marriage plot as a residual paradigm influencing feminine identity."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=abten_fd3FwC&amp;pg=PA68&amp;dq=%22becoming+jane%22+jarrold&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zXYTUIP4NYW49gTP5YH4Ag&amp;ved=0CFwQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22becoming%20jane%22&amp;f=false |title=Neo-Feminist Cinema: Girly Films, Chick Flicks and Consumer Culture |first=Hilary |last=Radner |pages=36, 68 |publisher=Routledge |year=2010 |ISBN=0415877733}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jarrold's adaptation also came in the wake of a number of literary [[biographical film]]s, such as ''[[Shakespeare in Love]]'' and ''[[Miss Potter]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Higson, pp. 180–81.&lt;/ref&gt; Deborah Cartmell, author of ''Screen Adaptations: Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice: A Close Study of the Relationship between Text and Film'', found similarities between ''Becoming Jane'' and ''Shakespeare in Love'' "almost so obvious that the [former] film risks the accusation of being dangerously derivative." A given example included the characters of Austen and [[William Shakespeare]] inputting their personal experiences directly into their works.&lt;ref&gt;Cartmell, pp. 116-18.&lt;/ref&gt; Marina Cano López and Rosa María García-Periago explained that the film "follows the path opened by John Madden’s ''Shakespeare in Love''. The numerous intertextual connections between both movies can be reduced to one:  just as Shakespeare is imagined as the hero of his own play, Jane Austen becomes the heroine of her own novel." Among other listed similarities, they noted that the romantic interests of both protagonists serve as their literary muses, and that the middle part of both films "lie" when viewed from a historical perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.jasna.org/persuasions/on-line/vol29no1/cano-garcia.html |title=Becoming Shakespeare and Jane Austen in Love: An Intertextual Dialogue between Two Biopics |first=Marina |last=Cano López |author2=Rosa María García-Periago |work=Persuasions On-line |publisher=Jane Austen Society of North America |volume=29 |number=1 |year=Winter 2008 |accessdate=2 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release and reception==
===Premiere, theatrical release, distribution and box office===
The [[Film premiere|world premiere]] of ''Becoming Jane'' took place in London on 5 March 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6418655.stm | title =Star misses Jane Austen premiere |date=5 March 2007 |accessdate =16 July 2012 | publisher = [[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was released to cinemas on 9 March 2007 in the United Kingdom&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://industry.bfi.org.uk/article/12434/March-2007 | title =March 2007 |accessdate =16 July 2012 | publisher = [[British Film Institute]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/mar/10/features16.theguide | title =In cinemas this weekend |date=9 March 2007 |accessdate =28 July 2010 | work= [[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a week later in Ireland by [[Buena Vista International]].&lt;ref name=JarroldIFTN/&gt; It ultimately grossed £3.78 million in the UK and Ireland, placing in sixteenth among all UK films for the year in those markets.

[[Miramax Films]] distributed the film in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.screendaily.com/miramax-gets-north-american-rights-to-becoming-jane/4026353.article |title=Miramax gets North American rights to Becoming Jane |work=Screen Daily |first=Wendy |last=Mitchell |date=1 March 2006 |accessdate=16 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; giving it a release date of 3 August 2007.&lt;ref name="boxofficemojo" /&gt; Originally, the studio intended to release ''Becoming Jane'' in June or July due to a "counter-programming" strategy,{{#tag:ref|According to Higson, "counter-programming" involved "so-called small, intelligent, quality films [being] released in the same week as one of the big summer [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbusters]]."&lt;ref name=Higson182/&gt;|group="note"}} attempting to attract demographic groups who were not interested in large [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbusters]].&lt;ref name=Higson182&gt;Higson, p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt; The film was expected to perform well during all seven days of the week and gradually gain more viewers during its time in cinemas. Due to the presence of recognizable stars such as Hathaway, ''Becoming Jane'' was expected to also do well among mainstream audiences. However, due to its weak UK release, the film's release was moved to August, when it opened on 100 screens in its first week. It increased to 601 screens the following week, later reaching 1,210 screens.&lt;ref name=Higson182/&gt; While the film made under $1 million in its first week, it was considered "a highly respectable showing for a heritage biopic" and enough of a figure to "justify a ten-week run."&lt;ref&gt;Sadoff, pp. 247–48.&lt;/ref&gt; The film eventually grossed a total of $18,670,946 in the US.&lt;ref name="boxofficemojo" /&gt;

On an international scale, ''Becoming Jane'' received a total of $37,311,672. It earned its highest grosses in the US, the UK, and Australia.&lt;ref name="boxofficemojo"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=becomingjane.htm | title =Becoming Jane |accessdate =28 July 2010 | publisher = [[Box Office Mojo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical response===
{{Anchor|Critics|Critical reaction|Critical reception}} 
Film [[review aggregator|review aggregation]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gave the film a score of 57% based on reviews from 136 critics. The site summarized the consensus: "Although ''Becoming Jane'' is a well-crafted period piece, it lacks fresh insight into the life and works of Jane Austen. The film focuses too much on wardrobe and not enough on Austen's achievements."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/becoming_jane/ |publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |title=Becoming Jane (2007) |accessdate=26 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' called the film a "triumph" for Hathaway, but observed that "the screenplay’s pseudo-Austen tone is so consistent that its lapses into modern romance-novel fantasy [and] threatens to derail the film."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/2007/08/03/movies/03jane.html |title=Our Wit-Lit Heroine Avoids Marrying a Juiceless Man |work=[[The New York Times]] |first=Stephen |last=Holden |date=3 August 2007 |accessdate=26 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; More positive, ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' called the film "a charmer," articulating that "the supporting cast (Julie Walters, Maggie Smith, James Cromwell) is top-drawer; and Anne Hathaway, with her coltish beauty and frank demeanor, is a welcome Jane."&lt;ref name=ewValby&gt;{{cite web|last=Valby |first=Karen |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=1 February 2008 |title=Becoming Jane (2008) |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20175519,00.html |accessdate=1 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics lauded Hathaway and McAvoy for the chemistry between their characters, finding that it lent authenticity to the love story between Austen and Lefroy.&lt;ref name="elley"&gt;{{cite web|last=Elley |first=Derek |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=8 March 2007 |title=Becoming Jane |url= http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117933022.html |accessdate=9 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SmithEmpire"&gt;{{Cite web |last=Smith |first=Anna |title=Becoming Jane (2007) |url=http://www.empireonline.com.au/reviews/films/2007/3/becoming-jane/review/ |work=Empire Online |accessdate=26 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121231071604/http://www.empireonline.com.au/reviews/films/2007/3/becoming-jane/review/ |archivedate=31 December 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; While Hathaway was admired for her performance by some critics,&lt;ref name="elley"/&gt;&lt;ref name=ewValby/&gt; some reviews negatively focused on her nationality&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-160375371.html |title=Perfectly pleasant, but this Jane still falls short |work=[[Daily Mail]] |via=[[HighBeam Research]] |first=Chris |last=Tookey |date=9 March 2007 |accessdate=26 July 2012}} {{Subscription needed}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the inauthenticity of her accent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-160298294.html |title=MOVIES: A BIT OF A PLAIN JANE; THE BIG RELEASE BECOMING JANE |work=[[Daily Mirror|The Mirror]] |via=[[HighBeam Research]] |first=David |last=Edwards |date=9 March 2007 |accessdate=26 July 2012}} {{Subscription needed}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-29458321.html  |work=[[The Belfast Telegraph]] |via=[[HighBeam Research]] |title=Does Anne's accent ruin film? |date=24 August 2011 |accessdate=26 July 2012}} {{Subscription needed}}&lt;/ref&gt; James McAvoy defended the decision of casting Hathaway by stating that a director should, "find the right actor…and [she] is undoubtedly brilliant."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Movie+Q%26A%3B+JAMES+McAVOY+Becoming+Jane.-a0160298687 |title=Movie Q&amp;A; JAMES McAVOY Becoming Jane |work=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|The Daily Record]] |date=9 March 2007 |accessdate=26 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hathaway herself admitted the persistent tendency to "sound too much like myself and not at all like Jane", blaming cold weather in Ireland, which meant she had to do voice retakes for several scenes.&lt;ref name="williams"/&gt; Nonetheless, Jarrold praised Hathaway for her performance. In a wrap up party after the filming, the director confessed that the actress had been a different person, "not just her accent but also the whole character, the way of holding yourself and speaking was so completely different".&lt;ref name="felce"&gt;{{cite web|last=Felce |first=Silvia |year=2007 |accessdate=11 July 2012 |title= Becoming Jane Q&amp;A with Anne Hathaway and director Julian Jarrold |publisher= Phase9 Entertainment |url=http://www.phase9.tv/moviefeatures/becomingjaneinterview1.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out London]]'' gave a positive review, enunciating that "Overall, the approach is less fluffily contrived than you’d expect, and though the alignment of circumstance and social status thwarting innocent passions is hardly fresh, it’s handled with thoughtful decorum. The emotional temperature’s rather restrained as a result, but with luxury casting all down the line,... elegant visuals balancing verdant and velvet, and a delightful faux-classical score, it’s a classy package, all right – just missing the extra spark."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/84140/becoming-jane.html |title=Becoming Jane (2007) |work=[[Time Out London]] |first=Trevor |last=Johnston |date=7 March 2007 |accessdate=1 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some reviewers have questioned the historical accuracy of the film, for instance critiquing the depicted relationship between Austen and Lefroy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-167182668.html |title='Becoming Jane' is fun without the genius; Strong cast, but love story about Austen built on a wisp |work=[[The Washington Times]] |via=[[HighBeam Research]] |first=Kelly Jane |last=Torrance |date=3 August 2007 |accessdate=26 July 2012}} {{Subscription needed}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2007/03/05/becoming_jane_2007_review.shtml |title=Movies - review - Becoming Jane (2007) |publisher=[[BBC]] |first=Stella |last=Papamichael |date=9 March 2007 |accessdate=1 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Civilité''' type (in French: "Caractères de civilité") is a [[typeface]] invented in 1557 by the French engraver [[Robert Granjon]]. These characters imitate [[Blackletter#French cursiva|French cursiva]]{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} letters of the [[Renaissance]].

==History==
[[image:Civilite type.JPG|right|200px|thumb| Civilité types used in a French courtesy book (1785)]]
The first book in the new type was ''Dialogue de la vie et de la mort'', a French version of Innocenzo Ringhieri's dialogue, in the dedication of which Granjon explains his purpose in cutting the new design. He calls the typeface "lettres françaises" and suggests that France like other nations should have a type based on the national hand; his model was contemporary handwriting. The popular name for the type came from the titles of two early books in which it was used: Erasmus's ''La Civilité puerile'', Jean Bellère, Antwerp, 1559, and ''La Civile honesteté pour les enfans'', R. Breton, Paris, 1560. "Civilité" meant "good manners" and it was thought an advantage that children should learn to read from a book printed in a type resembling current handwriting. Between 1557 and 1562 Granjon printed some 20 books in this type. Two other Paris printers had typefaces made that were very similar and Granjon himself supplied his version to Guillaume Silvius and to Christophe Plantin at Antwerp.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, A. F. (1966) ''Type Designs''; 3rd ed. London: Andre Deutsch; pp. 138-40&lt;/ref&gt;

They were mostly employed to print books in [[Flanders]], [[Holland]],&lt;ref&gt;In the Netherlands the type was more popular than in France but mostly in a form based on the contemporary Flemish hand which was devised by Ameet Tavernier of Bailleul by 1559.--Johnson (1966), p. 140&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Vlacq, Michiel et al. (1607) ''Den nieuwen verbeterden Lust-Hof, gheplant vol uytgelesene, eerlijcke, amoreuse ende vrolijcke ghesanghen''. [with:] (''Bruylofts Bancket''. Verghemaeckt door M[ichiel]. V[acq]. binnen der Goude verriert met ... copere figusren. ... Den derden druck gebetert en veel vermeerdert''. Amstelredam: Dirck Pietersz&lt;/ref&gt; [[England]], and [[France]]. In the latter, they were used until the second half of the 19th century to print children's lesson-books teaching civility and manners from which the type got its name.&lt;ref&gt;Elias, Norbert, 1978: ''The Civilizing Process: a History of Manners''. Urizen Books, New York. p.54&lt;/ref&gt; Civilité type did not win great popularity in France although used occasionally at all periods. Another version of civilité were used in one book printed in 1597 by Claude Micard, and two others in two books printed by [[Jean de Tournes (1539–1615)|Jean de Tournes]] in 1581 and 1598. In the mid 19th century Louis Perrin of Lyons printed J. Soulary's ''Sonnets humouristiques'' in civilité. Granjon's experiment cannot be said to have been a success: one of the grave disadvantages was that many ligatures were required and some letters had more than one variant.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, A. F. (1966) ''Type Designs''; 3rd ed. London: Andre Deutsch; pp. 138-40&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lily-M7292-As-shot-and-manual.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The left half shows the photo as it came from the digital camera. The right half shows the photo adjusted to make a gray surface neutral in the same light.]]

In [[photography]] and [[image processing]], '''color balance''' is the global adjustment of the intensities of the colors (typically red, green, and blue [[primary colors]]).  An important goal of this adjustment is to render specific colors – particularly neutral colors – correctly. Hence, the general method is sometimes called '''gray balance''', '''neutral balance''', or '''white balance'''.  Color balance changes the overall mixture of colors in an image and is used for [[color correction]]. Generalized versions of color balance are used to correct colors other than neutrals or to deliberately change them for effect.

Image data acquired by sensors – either [[photographic film|film]] or electronic [[image sensor]]s – must be transformed from the acquired values to new values that are appropriate for color reproduction or display.  Several aspects of the acquisition and display process make such color correction essential – including the fact that the acquisition sensors do not match the sensors in the human eye, that the properties of the display medium must be accounted for, and that the ambient viewing conditions of the acquisition differ from the display viewing conditions.

The color balance operations in popular [[image editing]] applications usually operate directly on the red, green, and blue channel [[pixel]] values,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = The Gimp for Linux and Unix | author = Phyllis Davis | publisher = Peachpit Press | year = 2000 | isbn = 0-201-70253-3 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=0sEnoWrMw-gC&amp;pg=PA135&amp;dq=%22color+balance%22+channels | page = 134}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = Adobe Photoshop 6.0 | author = Adobe Creative Team | publisher = Adobe Press | year = 2000 | isbn = 0-201-71016-1 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=MRtx2-0GZc4C&amp;pg=PA277&amp;dq=%22color+balance%22+channels | page = 278 }}&lt;/ref&gt; without respect to any color sensing or reproduction model.  In film photography, color balance is typically achieved by using [[color correction filter]]s over the lights or on the camera lens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = Cinematography: Theory and Practice : Imagemaking for Cinematographers, Directors, and Videographers | author = Blain Brown | publisher = Focal Press | year = 2002 | isbn = 0-240-80500-3| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=1JL2jFbNPNAC&amp;pg=PA170&amp;dq=%22color+balance%22 | page=170 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Generalized color balance==
[[File:Color balancing girl.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Example of color balancing]]
Sometimes the adjustment to keep neutrals neutral is called ''white balance'', and the phrase ''color balance'' refers to the adjustment that in addition makes other colors in a displayed image appear to have the same general appearance as the colors in an original scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = Introduction to Color Imaging Science | author = Hsien-Che Lee | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 2005 | isbn = 0-521-84388-X | page=450 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is particularly important that neutral (gray, neutral, white) colors in a scene appear neutral in the reproduction. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nikondigital.org/articles/white_balance.htm White Balance]. ''Nikon Digital''. {{retrieved|access-date=October 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychological color balance===
Humans relate to [[Human skin color|flesh tones]] more critically than other colors. Trees, grass and sky can all be off without concern, but if human flesh tones are 'off' then the human subject can look sick or dead. To address this critical color balance issue, the tri-color primaries themselves are formulated to ''not'' balance as a true neutral color. The purpose of this color primary imbalance is to more faithfully reproduce the flesh tones through the entire brightness range. 

US Patent 2,850,563 states "...effecting a non-distorted transfer of a flesh tone through the system over its entire brightness range, notwithstanding the inherent non-linear transfer characteristic of said system...".&lt;ref&gt;[https://patents.google.com/patent/US2850563A/en?oq=2850563 US Patent 2,850,563] Edgar A. Gretener 1958 &lt;/ref&gt;

Viewing of the flesh altered primaries is available with a [https://coins.nd.edu/ColCoin/ColCoinIcons/ColorGuide100dpi.jpg /''Color Separation Guide''] or ''Color Control Patch'' (same thing). There are 18 color swatches on the guide; 9 at 100% density, and the same 9 at 50% density. The 3-color swatch at 50% density thereon shows the result of the flesh tone primaries, at a 1:1:1 ratio, directly.

Most digital cameras have means to select color correction based on the type of scene lighting, using either manual lighting selection, automatic white balance, or custom white balance.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}} The algorithms for these processes perform generalized [[chromatic adaptation]].

Many methods exist for color balancing.  Setting a button on a camera is a way for the user to indicate to the processor the nature of the scene lighting. Another option on some cameras is a button which one may press when the camera is pointed at a [[gray card]] or other neutral colored object. This captures an image of the ambient light, which enables a digital camera to set the correct color balance for that light.

There is a large literature on how one might estimate the ambient lighting from the camera data and then use this information to transform the image data. A variety of algorithms have been proposed, and the quality of these has been debated. A few examples and examination of the references therein will lead the reader to many others. Examples are [[Retinex]], an [[artificial neural network]]&lt;ref name="Funt1996"&gt;Brian Funt, Vlad Cardei, and Kobus Barnard, "[http://www.cs.sfu.ca/~colour/publications/ARIZONA/arizona_abs.html Learning color constancy]," in ''Proceedings of the Fourth IS&amp;T/SID Color Imaging Conference,'' pp. 58–60 (1996).&lt;/ref&gt; or a [[Bayesian method]].&lt;ref name=Finlayson2001&gt;{{Cite journal

==Chromatic colors==

Color balancing an image affects not only the neutrals, but other colors as well. An image that is not color balanced is said to have a color cast, as everything in the image appears to have been shifted towards one color.&lt;ref name="Yule1967"&gt;John A C Yule, ''Principles of Color Reproduction.'' New York: Wiley, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2010}} Color balancing may be thought in terms of removing this color cast.

Color balance is also related to [[color constancy]]. Algorithms and techniques used to attain color constancy are frequently used for color balancing, as well. Color constancy is, in turn, related to [[chromatic adaptation]]. Conceptually, color balancing consists of two steps: first, determining the [[standard illuminant|illuminant]] under which an image was captured; and second, scaling the components (e.g., R, G, and B) of the image or otherwise transforming the components so they conform to the viewing illuminant.

Viggiano found that white balancing in the camera's native [[RGB color model]] tended to produce less color inconstancy (i.e., less distortion of the colors) than in monitor RGB for over 4000 hypothetical sets of camera sensitivities.&lt;ref name="Viggiano2004"/&gt; This difference typically amounted to a factor of more than two in favor of camera RGB. This means that it is advantageous to get color balance right at the time an image is captured, rather than edit later on a monitor. If one must color balance later, balancing the [[Raw image format|raw image data]] will tend to produce less distortion of chromatic colors than balancing in monitor RGB.

==Mathematics of color balance==
Color balancing is sometimes performed on a three-component image (e.g., [[RGB color model|RGB]]) using a 3x3 [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]]. This type of transformation is appropriate if the image was captured using the wrong white balance setting on a digital camera, or through a color filter.

===Scaling monitor R, G, and B===
In principle, one wants to scale all relative luminances in an image so that objects which are believed to be [[grey|neutral]] appear so. If, say, a surface with &lt;math&gt;R=240&lt;/math&gt; was believed to be a white object, and if 255 is the count which corresponds to white, one could multiply all [[red]] values by 255/240. Doing analogously for [[green]] and [[blue]] would result, at least in theory, in a color balanced image. In this type of transformation the 3x3 matrix is a [[diagonal matrix]].

: &lt;math&gt;\left[\begin{array}{c} R \\ G \\ B \end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{ccc}255/R'_w &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 255/G'_w &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 255/B'_w\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{c}R' \\ G' \\ B' \end{array}\right]&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; are the color balanced red, green, and blue components of a [[pixel]] in the image; &lt;math&gt;R'&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;G'&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;B'&lt;/math&gt; are the red, green, and blue components of the image before color balancing, and &lt;math&gt;R'_w&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;G'_w&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;B'_w&lt;/math&gt; are the red, green, and blue components of a pixel which is believed to be a white surface in the image before color balancing. This is a simple scaling of the red, green, and blue channels, and is why color balance tools in [[Photoshop]] and the [[GIMP]] have a white eyedropper tool.  It has been demonstrated that performing the white balancing in the phosphor set assumed by [[sRGB]] tends to produce large errors in chromatic colors, even though it can render the neutral surfaces perfectly neutral.&lt;ref name="Viggiano2004"&gt;J A Stephen Viggiano, "[http://www.acolyte-color.com/papers/EI_2004.pdf Comparison of the accuracy of different white balancing options as quantified by their color constancy]." ''Sensors and Camera Systems for Scientific, Industrial, and Digital Photography Applications V: Proceedings of the SPIE,'' volume 5301. Bellingham, WA: SPIE: the International Society for Optical Engineering, p 323-333 (2004), retrieved online 2008-07-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scaling X, Y, Z===
If the image may be transformed into [[CIE 1931 color space|CIE XYZ tristimulus values]], the color balancing may be performed there.  This has been termed a “wrong von Kries” transformation.&lt;ref name=Terstiege1972&gt;{{Cite journal

Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Although it has been demonstrated to offer usually poorer results than balancing in monitor RGB, it is mentioned here as a bridge to other things. Mathematically, one computes:

If the tristimulus values of the monitor primaries are in a matrix &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P}&lt;/math&gt; so that:

:&lt;math&gt;\left[\begin{array}{c} X \\ Y \\ Z \end{array}\right]=\mathbf{P}\left[\begin{array}{c}L_R \\ L_G \\ L_B \end{array}\right]&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;L_R&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;L_G&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;L_B&lt;/math&gt; are the un-[[gamma correction|gamma corrected]] monitor RGB, one may use:

:&lt;math&gt;\left[\begin{array}{c} L_R \\ L_G \\ L_B \end{array}\right]=\mathbf{P^{-1}}\left[\begin{array}{ccc}X_w/X'_w &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; Y_w/Y'_w &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; Z_w/Z'_w\end{array}\right]\mathbf{P}\left[\begin{array}{c}L_{R'} \\ L_{G'} \\ L_{B'} \end{array}\right]&lt;/math&gt;

===Von Kries's method===
[[Johannes von Kries]], whose theory of [[rod cell|rods]] and three color-sensitive [[cone cell|cone]] types in the [[retina]] has survived as the dominant explanation of color sensation for over 100 years, motivated the method of converting color to the [[LMS color space]], representing the effective stimuli for the Long-, Medium-, and Short-wavelength cone types that are modeled as adapting independently.  A 3x3 matrix converts RGB or XYZ to LMS, and then the three LMS primary values are scaled to balance the neutral; the color can then be converted back to the desired final [[color space]]:&lt;ref name=Sharma&gt;{{Cite book| title = Digital Color Imaging Handbook | author =  Gaurav Sharma| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=AkByHKRGTsQC&amp;pg=PA153&amp;dq=%22von+Kries%22 | publisher = [[CRC Press]] | year = 2003 | isbn = 0-8493-0900-X | page=153 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\left[\begin{array}{c} L \\ M \\ S \end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{ccc}1/L'_w &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1/M'_w &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1/S'_w\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{c}L' \\ M' \\ S' \end{array}\right]&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; are the color-balanced LMS cone tristimulus values; &lt;math&gt;L'_w&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;M'_w&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;S'_w&lt;/math&gt; are the tristimulus values of an object believed to be white in the un-color-balanced image, and &lt;math&gt;L'&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;M'&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;S'&lt;/math&gt; are the tristimulus values of a pixel in the un-color-balanced image.

Matrices to convert to LMS space were not specified by von Kries, but can be derived from CIE color matching functions and LMS color matching functions when the latter are specified; matrices can also be found in reference books.&lt;ref name=Sharma/&gt;

===Scaling camera RGB===
By Viggiano's measure, and using his model of gaussian camera spectral sensitivities, most camera RGB spaces performed better than either monitor RGB or XYZ.&lt;ref name="Viggiano2004"/&gt;  If the camera's raw RGB values are known, one may use the 3x3 diagonal matrix:

: &lt;math&gt;\left[\begin{array}{c} R \\ G \\ B \end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{ccc}255/R'_w &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 255/G'_w &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 255/B'_w\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{c}R' \\ G' \\ B' \end{array}\right]&lt;/math&gt;

and then convert to a working RGB space such as [[sRGB]] or [[Adobe RGB]] after balancing.
&lt;!-- in progress!
However, if one has already converted to monitor RGB, one may still work in camera RGB if a 3x3 [[regular matrix]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; characterizes the camera's color mixing behavior reasonably well, so that:

: &lt;math&gt;\left[\begin{array}{c} X \\ Y \\ Z \end{array}\right]\approx\mathbf{A}\left[\begin{array}{c}L_R \\ L_G \\ L_B \end{array}\right]&lt;/math&gt;

(This matrix is included in the [[ICC profile]] for some cameras.&lt;ref name="ICC01_2006"&gt;International Color Consortium, ''Specification ICC.1:2004-10 (Profile version 4.2.0.0) Image technology colour management — Architecture, profile format, and data structure'', (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;) If this matrix is known, one computes:

:&lt;math&gt;\left[\begin{array}{c} L_R \\ L_G \\ L_B \end{array}\right]=\mathbf{P^{-1}A^{-1}}\left[\begin{array}{ccc}R_w/R'_w &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; G_w/G'_w &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; B_w/B'_w\end{array}\right]\mathbf{A\cdotP}\left[\begin{array}{c}L_{R'} \\ L_{G'} \\ L_{B'} \end{array}\right]&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P}&lt;/math&gt; is the phosphor matrix mentioned in the previous section; &lt;math&gt;L_{Rw}&lt;/math, &lt;math&gt;G_w&lt;/math, &lt;math&gt;B_w&lt;/math are the
--&gt;

===Preferred chromatic adaptation spaces===
Comparisons of images balanced by diagonal transforms in a number of different RGB spaces have identified several such spaces that work better than others, and better than camera or monitor spaces, for chromatic adaptation, as measured by several [[color appearance model]]s; the systems that performed statistically as well as the best on the majority of the image test sets used were the "Sharp", "Bradford", "CMCCAT", and "ROMM" spaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| url = http://infoscience.epfl.ch/getfile.py?recid=34049&amp;mode=best | title = Chromatic Adaptation Performance of Different RGB Sensors |author1=Sabine Süsstrunk |author2=Jack Holm |author3=Graham D. Finlayson | journal = IS&amp;T/SPIE Electronic Imaging | volume = 4300|date=January 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===General illuminant adaptation===
The best color matrix for adapting to a change in illuminant is not necessarily a diagonal matrix in a fixed color space.  It has long been known that if the space of illuminants can be described as a linear model with ''N'' basis terms, the proper color transformation will be the weighted sum of ''N'' fixed linear transformations, not necessarily consistently diagonalizable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author1=Laurence T.

'''''Compert Con Culainn''''' ({{lang-en|'''The Conception of Cú Chulainn'''}}) is an early medieval [[Ireland|Irish]] narrative about the conception and birth of the hero [[Cú Chulainn]]. Part of the [[Ulster Cycle]] of [[Irish mythology]], it survives in two major versions.

==Manuscripts==

The tale exists in two main recensions. The earliest witness of the first version is the [[Lebor na hUidre]] (LU), compiled in the 12th century. The principal scribe (M) was responsible for writing down the main text, while a later reviser (H) erased the ending to make room for his own sequel from the time of Cú Chulainn's birth. According to H's notes, the text was included in the [[Cín Dromma Snechtai]], an 8th-century manuscript now lost. Further copies of Recension I have come down in six manuscripts of the 15th and 16th centuries, all of them in some way associated with [[Connacht]].&lt;ref&gt;Ó Concheanainn, "The textual tradition." p. 441.&lt;/ref&gt;

The second recension survives in Egerton 1782 and D IV 2, where they immediately follow the first.&lt;ref&gt;Ó Concheanainn, "The textual tradition." p. 442.&lt;/ref&gt; This recension is also called ''Feis Tige Becfholtaig'' “The feast of (or: passing of the night in) Becfholtach's house” in D IV 2.

==Summary==
In the earliest version of ''Compert Chon Culainn'', Cú Chulainn's mother [[Deichtine]] is the daughter and charioteer of [[Conchobar mac Nessa]], king of Ulster, and accompanies him as he and the nobles of Ulster hunt a flock of magical birds. Snow falls, and the Ulstermen seek shelter, finding a house where they are made welcome. Their host's wife goes into labour, and Deichtine assists at the birth of a baby boy. A mare gives birth to two colts at the same time. The next morning, the Ulstermen find themselves at the Brug na Bóinde (the neolithic mound at [[Newgrange]]). The house and its occupants have disappeared, but the child and the colts remain. Deichtine takes the boy home and raises him to early childhood, but he falls sick and dies. The god [[Lugh|Lug]] appears to her and tells her he was their host that night, and that he has put his child in her womb, who is to be called Sétanta. Her pregnancy is a scandal as she is betrothed to [[Sualtam]] mac Róich, and the Ulstermen suspect Conchobar of being the father, so she aborts the child and goes to her husband's bed "virgin-whole". She then conceives a son whom she names Sétanta.&lt;ref&gt;[[A.G. van Hamel]] (ed), ''Compert Con Culainn and Other Stories''. pp. 3-8.&lt;/ref&gt; This has been interpreted as a triple conception, marking the child out as someone special.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean Markale]]. ''The Epics of Celtic Ireland: Ancient Tales of Mystery and Magic''. 2000. p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the later, and better-known, version of ''Compert Con Culainn'', Deichtine is Conchobar's sister, and disappears from [[Emain Macha]], the Ulster capital. As in the previous version, the Ulstermen go hunting a flock of magical birds, are overtaken by a snowstorm and seek shelter in a nearby house. Their host is Lug, but this time his wife, who gives birth to a son that night, is Deichtine herself. The child is named Sétanta.&lt;ref&gt;Cross and Slover, ''Ancient Irish Tales. ''pp. 134-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The nobles of Ulster argue over which of them is to be his foster-father, until the wise Morann decides he should be fostered by several of them: Conchobar himself; [[Sencha mac Ailella]], who will teach him judgement and eloquent speech; the wealthy [[Blaí Briugu]], who will protect and provide for him; the noble warrior [[Fergus mac Róich]], who will care for him and teach him to protect the weak; the poet [[Amergin mac Eccit|Amergin]], who will educate him, and his wife [[Findchóem]], who will nurse him. He is brought up in the house of Amergin and Findchóem on Muirthemne Plain in modern [[County Louth]], alongside their son [[Conall Cernach]].&lt;ref&gt;Kinsella, ''The Táin.'' pp. 23-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Exquisite corpse drawing by Noah Ryan and Erica Parrott.JPG|thumb|An exquisite corpse drawing]]

'''Exquisite corpse''', also known as '''exquisite cadaver''' (from the original French term '''''{{Lang|fr|cadavre exquis}}'''''), is a method by which a collection of words or images is collectively assembled. Each collaborator adds to a composition in sequence, either by following a rule (e.g. "The ''[[adjective]]'' ''[[noun]]'' ''[[adverb]]'' ''[[verb]]'' the ''adjective'' ''noun''." as in "The green duck sweetly sang the dreadful dirge.") or by being allowed to see only the end of what the previous person contributed.

==History==
This technique was invented by [[surrealism|surrealist]]s and is similar to an old [[parlour game]] called [[Consequences (game)|Consequences]] in which players write in turn on a sheet of paper, fold it to conceal part of the writing, and then pass it to the next player for a further contribution. Surrealism principal founder [[André Breton]] reported that it started in fun, but became playful and eventually enriching. Breton said the diversion started about 1925, but [[Pierre Reverdy]] wrote that it started much earlier, at least as early as 1918.&lt;ref name="Breton" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.exquisitecorpse.com/definition/bretons_remembrances.html |title=Morgue |last=Reverdy |first=Pierre |date=March 1918 |publisher=Nord-Sud |accessdate=28 March 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107014444/http://www.exquisitecorpse.com/definition/Bretons_Remembrances.html |archivedate=January 7, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name is derived from a phrase that resulted when Surrealists first played the game, "{{Lang|fr|Le cadavre exquis boira le vin nouveau.}}" ("The exquisite corpse shall drink the new wine.")&lt;ref&gt;[[André Breton|Breton, André]] (7 October 1948), ''{{Lang|fr|Le Cadavre Exquis: Son Exaltation}}'', exhibition catalogue, La Dragonne, Galerie Nina Dausset, Paris (October 7–30).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brotchie|first=Alastair|author2=Mel Gooding|title=Surrealist Games|publisher=[[Redstone Press]]|year=1991|location=London|pages=143–144|isbn=1-870003-21-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; André Breton writes that the game developed at the residence of friends in an old house of [[Montparnasse]] at 54 rue du Château (no longer existing). These artists started the movement [[Yves Tanguy]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Jacques Prévert]], [[Benjamin Péret]], [[Pierre Reverdy]], and [[André Breton]]. Other participants probably included [[Max Morise]], [[Joan Miró]], [[Man Ray]], [[Simone Collinet]], [[Tristan Tzara]], [[Georges Hugnet]], [[René Char]], and [[Paul Éluard|Paul]] and [[Nusch Éluard]].&lt;ref name="Breton"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://exquisitecorpse.com/definition/Bretons_Remembrances.html|title=Breton Remembers|last=Breton|first=André|date=7 October 1948}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pusanweb.com/poetryplus/poetryplus16/corpse/exquisite.htm#exquisite|title=The Exquisite Corpse|year=2009|publisher=Poetry Plus|accessdate=28 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Henry Miller]] often partook of the game to pass time in French cafés during the 1930s.

[[File:She (colorized).jpg|thumb|right|The 1935 [[fantasy film]] ''[[She (1935 film)|She]]'', colorized.]]

'''Film colorization''' (or '''colourisation''') is any process that adds color to [[black-and-white]], [[sepia tone|sepia]], or other monochrome moving-picture images. It may be done as a special effect, to "modernize" black-and-white films, or to restore color films. The first examples date from the early 20th century, but colorization has become common with the advent of [[digital image processing]].

==Early techniques==

===Hand colorization===
{{expand section|date=October 2011}}
{{see also|List of early color feature films}}
The first film colorization methods were hand done by individuals. For example, at least 4% of [[George Méliès]]'s output, including some prints of ''[[A Trip to the Moon]]'' from 1902 and other major films such as ''[[The Kingdom of the Fairies]]'', ''[[The Impossible Voyage]]'', and ''[[The Barber of Seville (1904 film)|The Barber of Seville]]'' were individually hand-colored by [[Elisabeth Thuillier]]'s coloring lab in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Yumibe|2012|pp=71–74}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thuillier, a former colorist of glass and celluloid products, directed a studio of two hundred people painting directly on film stock with brushes, in the colors she chose and specified; each worker was assigned a different color in [[assembly line]] style, with more than twenty separate colors often used for a single film. Thuillier's lab produced about sixty hand-colored copies of ''A Trip to the Moon'', but only one copy is known to exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wemaere|Duval|2011|p=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first full-length feature film made by a hand-colored process was ''[[The Miracle (1912 film)|The Miracle]]'' of 1912.

The process was always done by hand, sometimes using a [[stencil]] cut from a second print of the film, such as the [[Pathécolor]] process. As late as the 1920s, hand coloring processes were used for individual shots in ''[[Greed (film)|Greed]]'' (1924) and ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1925 film)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'' (1925) (both utilizing the [[Handschiegl color process]]); and rarely, an entire feature-length movie such as ''[[Cyrano de Bergerac (1925 film)|Cyrano de Bergerac]]'' (1925) and ''[[The Last Days of Pompeii (1926 film)|The Last Days of Pompeii]]'' (1926).

These colorization methods were employed until effective [[color motion picture film|color film processes]] were developed. During the late 1960s and the early 1970s, black-and-white ''[[Betty Boop]]'', ''[[Mickey Mouse]]'', and ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' cartoons were redistributed in color. Supervised by [[Fred Ladd]], color was added by tracing the original black-and-white frames onto new animation [[cel]]s, and then adding color to the new cels in [[South Korea]]. To cut time and expense, Ladd's process skipped every other frame, cutting the frame rate in half; this technique considerably degraded the quality and timing of the original animation, to the extent that some animation was not carried over or mistakenly altered. The most recent redrawn colorized black-and-white cartoons are the [[Fleischer Studios]]/[[Famous Studios]]' ''[[Popeye the Sailor (animated cartoons)|Popeye]]'' cartoons, the [[Harman-Ising]] ''[[Merrie Melodies]]'', and [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cartoon studio|MGM]]'s ''[[The Captain and the Kids (MGM animated series)|The Captain and the Kids]]'' cartoons, which were colorized in 1987 for airing on the [[Turner Entertainment|Turner]] networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cztoondb.tripod.com/cztoondb/laddqaart.htm |title=The colorized cartoon database |accessdate=2007-01-01 |author= |authorlink= |work= |publisher= |pages= |language= |quote= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060522113108/http://cztoondb.tripod.com/cztoondb/laddqaart.htm |archivedate=May 22, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With computer technology, studios were able to add color to black-and-white films by digitally tinting single objects in each frame of the film until it was fully colorized (the first authorized computer-colorizations of B&amp;W cartoons were commissioned by [[Warner Bros.]] in 1990). The initial process was invented by Canadian [[Wilson Markle]] and was first used in 1970 to add color to monochrome footage of the moon from the [[Apollo program]] missions.

===Digital colorization===
Computerized colorization began in the 1970s using the technique invented by Wilson Markle. These early attempts at colourisation have soft contrast and fairly pale, flat, washed-out color; however, the technology improved steadily since the 1980s.

To perform digital colorization, a digitized copy of the best [[monochrome| black and white]] film print available is used. Technicians, with the aid of computer software, associate a range of gray levels to each object, and indicate to the computer any movement of the objects within a shot. The software is also capable of sensing variations in the light level from frame-to-frame and correcting it if necessary. The technician selects a color for each object based on (1) common "memory" colors such as blue sky, white clouds, flesh tones and green grass, and (2) based on any known information about the movie. If color publicity stills or props from the movie are available to examine, authentic colors may be applied. (3) In the absence of any better information, the technician may choose a color which they feel fits the gray level and is consistent with what a director might have chosen for the scene. The computer software then associates a variation of the basic color with each gray level in the object, while keeping intensity levels the same as in the monochrome original. The software then follows each object from frame to frame, applying the same color until the object leaves the frame. As new objects come into the frame, the technician must associate colors to each new object in the same way as described above.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.museum.tv/eotvsection.php?entrycode=colorization |title=COLORIZATION |accessdate=2007-01-01 |author= |authorlink= |work= |publisher= |pages= |language= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This technique was patented in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://brevets-patents.ic.gc.ca/opic-cipo/cpd/eng/patent/1291260/summary.html  |title=Canadian Intellectual Property Office |accessdate=2007-01-01 |author= |authorlink= |work= |publisher= |pages= |language= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A major obstacle with this method is it is highly labour-intensive. In order to colourise a still image, an artist typically begins by dividing the image into regions, and then assigning a color to each region. This approach, also known as the [[segmentation (image processing)|segmentation]] method, is laborious, as the process of dividing the picture into correct segments is time-consuming. This occurs primarily when there have been no fully automatic [[algorithm]]s to identify fuzzy or complex region boundaries, such as between a subject's hair and face. Colorization of moving images also requires tracking regions as movement occurs from one frame to the next ([[motion compensation]]). Several companies claim to have produced automatic region-tracking algorithms.

Legend Films describes their core technology as pattern recognition and background compositing which moves and morphs foreground and background masks from frame to frame. In the process, backgrounds are colorized separately in a single composite frame which functions as a visual database of a cut, and includes all offset data on each camera movement. Once the foreground areas are colourised, background masks are applied frame-to-frame.

Timebrush describes a process based on [[Artificial neural network|neural net]] technology which produces saturated and crisp colors with clear lines and no apparent spill-over. The process is cost effective, as it relies on computer, rather than human effort, and is equally suitable for low-budget colorization, as well as broadcast-quality, or theatrical projection.

A team at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]'s Benin School of Computer Science and Engineering describe their method as an interactive process which does not require precise, manual, region detection, nor accurate tracking, and is based on the premise that adjacent pixels in space and time which have similar gray levels, should also have similar colors. At the [[University of Minnesota]], a color propagation method was developed which uses [[Distance (graph theory)|geodesic distance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://moon.felk.cvut.cz/~sykorad/literature.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101106161817/http://moon.felk.cvut.cz/~sykorad/literature.html |archivedate=2010-11-06 |title=Annotation of colorization methods |accessdate=2007-01-01 |author=Daniel Sýkora |authorlink= |work= |publisher= |pages= |language= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A highly labor-intensive process, employed by the UK-based film and video colorization artist [[Stuart Humphryes]] in conjunction with video restoration company SVS Resources, was employed by the [[BBC]] in 2013 for the commercial release of two ''[[Doctor Who]]'' serials;  the first episode of ''[[The Mind of Evil]]'' and newly discovered black and white footage in the director's cut of ''[[Terror of the Zygons]]''. For these projects, approximately 7,000 key-frames (approximately every 5th [[PAL]] video frame) were fully colorized by hand, without the use of masks, layers or the [[segmentation (image processing)|segmentation]] method. These were then utilised by SVS Resources to interpolate the colour across the intervening surrounding frames using a part computerized/part manual process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://babelcolour.com/dvd-work/mind-of-evil/ |title=Babelcolour Video Colourisation |accessdate=2013-11-15 |author= |authorlink=Stuart Humphryes |date=8 May 2013 |work= |publisher= |pages= |language= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, ''Algorithmia'' released a free, online colourisation service. Although sample limited, the service uses [[Artificial neural network|neural nets]] with [[artificial intelligence]] which is trained on colourised images that are fed to [[Deep learning|deep]] [[generative adversarial networks]] along with automatically generated [[grayscale]].[http://demos.algorithmia.com/colorize-photos/]

==Uses of colorization==

===Partial colorization===
The earliest form of colorization introduced limited color into a black-and-white film using dyes, as a visual effect.  The earliest Edison films, most notably the ''[[Annabelle Serpentine Dance]]'' series, were also the earliest examples of colorization, done by painting [[aniline]] dyes onto the emulsion.

Around 1905, [[Pathé]] introduced ''Pathéchrome'', a stencil process that required cutting one or more stencils for each film frame with the aid of a reducing [[pantograph]].

In 1916, the [[Handschiegl Color Process]] was invented for [[Cecil B. DeMille]]'s film ''[[Joan the Woman]]'' (1917). Another early example of the Handschiegl process can be found in ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1925 film)|Phantom of the Opera]]'' (1925), in which [[Lon Chaney, Sr.|Lon Chaney]]'s character can be seen wearing a bright-red cape while the rest of the scene remained monochrome. The scene was toned sepia, and then the cape was painted red, either by stencil or by matrix. Then, a sulfur solution was applied to everything but the dyed parts, turning the sepia into blue tone. The process was named after its inventor, Max Handschiegl. This effect, as well as a missing color sequence, were recreated in 1996 for a [[Photoplay Productions]] restoration by computer colorization (see below).

Partial colorization has also been utilized on footage shot in color to enhance commercials and broadcast television to further facilitate the director's artistic vision. As an example, [[Cerulean Fx]] provided partial colorization for [[Dave Matthews Band]]'s music video ''[[The Space Between]]'' as well as [[Outkast]]'s music videos ''[[Bombs Over Baghdad]]'' and ''[[roses (OutKast song)|Roses]]''.

===Restoration===
{{Main article|Colour recovery}}

A number of British television shows which were made in color in the early 1970s were [[wiping|wiped]] for economic reasons, but in some cases black-and-white [[telerecording]]s were made for export to countries that did not yet have [[color television]]. An example is the [[BBC]]'s five-part ''[[Doctor Who]]'' story ''[[The Dæmons]]''. Only one episode survived in color; the rest existed only as black-and-white film recordings. The only known color recording was a poor-quality over-the-air recording of an abridged broadcast in the United States. In the 1990s the BBC colorized the black-and-white copies by adding the color signal from the over-the-air recordings. The result was judged a success by both technicians and fans. In March 2008, it was announced&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/mar/06/research.bbc |title=Putting colour back in the Doctor's cheeks |accessdate=2008-03-14 |author=Charles Norton |authorlink= |date=6 March 2008 |work= |publisher=The Guardian |pages=  |quote= | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; that new technology, which involves detecting color artifacts ("[[dot crawl]]") in high-resolution scans of black-and-white films, will be used to restore other ''Who'' episodes as well as shows like ''[[Steptoe and Son]]'' where some episodes originally produced in color only exist in black-and-white. However, there are no plans to use colorization on BBC programmes originally ''produced'' in black-and-white, such as the 1960s ''Who'' episodes since they have no color information available and so cannot be recovered using these methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.restoration-team.co.uk/ |title=Doctor Who Restoration Team Official Site |accessdate=2007-01-01 |author= |authorlink= |work= |publisher= |pages= |language= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Integration===
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2017}}

Colorization is also sometimes used on historical [[stock footage]] in color movies. For instance, the film ''[[Thirteen Days (film)|Thirteen Days]]'' uses colorized news footage from the time of the [[Cuban missile crisis]] of 1962.

The full-color feature film ''[[Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow]]'' (2004), which already made heavy use of digitally generated sets and objects, integrated black-and-white 1940s footage of Sir [[Laurence Olivier]] into scenes by colorizing him.

In his feature film, ''[[The Aviator (2004 film)|The Aviator]]'' (2005), Martin Scorsese seamlessly blended colorized stock footage of the ''[[Hell's Angels (film)|Hell's Angels]]'' movie premiere with footage of the premiere's re-enactment.  The colorization by Legend Films was designed to look like normal three-strip film but was then color corrected to match the two-strip look of the premiere's re-enactment.  Also in ''The Aviator'', Scorsese used colorized footage of [[Jane Russell]] from the original black-and-white film, ''[[The Outlaw]]'' and dog fight scenes from ''Hell's Angels''.

In 1983, Hal Roach Studios became one of the first studios to venture into the business of computerized film colorization. Buying a 50 percent interest in [[Wilson Markle]]'s Colorization, Inc., it began creating digitally colored versions of some of its films. Roach's ''[[Topper (film)|Topper]]'' (1937), followed by ''[[Way Out West (1937 film)|Way Out West]]'' (1937), became the first black-and-white films to be redistributed in color using the digital colorization process,&lt;ref name="Edgerton"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01956050009602812 |title=The Germans Wore Gray, You Wore Blue |accessdate=2009-12-24 |author= |last=Edgerton |first=Gary R. |authorlink= |date=Winter 2000 |work= |publisher=Journal of Popular Film and Television |pages= |language= |doi= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AFI Topper"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.afi.com/members/catalog/DetailView.aspx?s=&amp;Movie=4530 |title=Topper |website=[[AFI Catalog of Feature Films]] |publisher=[[American Film Institute]] |access-date=2016-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AV media notes |title=Topper |title-link=Topper (film) |year=1985 |publisher=Hal Roach Studios Film Classics, Inc. |quote=It seems fitting that ''Topper'' should again be on the cutting edge of change, this time heralding the age of Colorization as the first completed Color version of a classic black and white motion picture.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last= |first= |date=April 13, 1985 |title=Roach Enters Home Market |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8SMEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PT11&amp;dq=colorized&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiSn-aSvtfNAhUH5IMKHcRKDhY4ChDoAQgvMAU#v=onepage&amp;q=colorized&amp;f=false |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |access-date=2016-07-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; leading to controversy. Defenders of the process noted that it would allow black-and-white films to have new audiences of people who were not used to the format. Detractors complained (among other reasons) that the process was crude and claimed that even if it were refined, it would not take into account [[lighting]] compositions chosen for black-and-white [[photography]] which would not necessarily be as effective in color.&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,963207,00.html |title=Casablanca In Color? |accessdate=2007-01-01 |author= |authorlink= |date=1987-01-12 |work= |publisher=[[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] |page=3 |language= |quote= | first=Charles | last=Krauthammer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Figures opposed to the process included [[Roger Ebert]], [[James Stewart]], [[John Huston]], [[George Lucas]] and [[Woody Allen]].&lt;ref name="Edgerton"/&gt;

In 1986, Film critics [[Gene Siskel]] and [[Roger Ebert]] did a special episode of ''[[Siskel &amp; Ebert]]'' addressing colorization as "Hollywood's New Vandalism." Siskel explained how networks were unable to show classic black-and-white films in prime-time unless they offer it in color. "They arrest people who spray subway cars, they lock up people who attack paintings and sculptures in museums, and adding color to black and white films, even if it's only to the tape shown on TV or sold in stores, is vandalism nonetheless." Roger Ebert added, "What was so wrong about black and white movies in the first place? By filming in black and white, movies can sometimes be more dreamlike and elegant and stylized and mysterious. They can add a whole additional dimension to reality, while color sometimes just supplies additional unnecessary information."&lt;ref&gt;[http://siskelandebert.org/video/AH4MXGWKMRGH/Colorizing-Hollywood8217s-New-Vandalism-1986 Colorizing, Hollywood’s New Vandalism (1986)], Siskel &amp; Ebert, Buena Vista Television, 1986; air date unknown&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Media mogul]] [[Ted Turner]] was once an aggressive proponent of this process, by employing the San Diego firm American Film Technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sec.edgar-online.com/american-film-technologies-inc-de/10-k-annual-report/2000/01/25/Section2.aspx |title=AMERICAN FILM TECHNOLOGIES INC /DE/ – AFTC Annual Report (10-K) ITEM 1. BUSINESS |publisher=Sec.edgar-online.com |accessdate=2009-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he told members of the press in July 1988 that he was considering colorizing ''[[Citizen Kane]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Bawden, James, "Colorful Turner sees ''Citizen Kane'' in a different light".''[[Toronto Star]]'', July 28, 1988. "''Citizen Kane?'' I'm thinking of colorizing it."&lt;/ref&gt; Turner's comments led to an immediate public outcry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museum.tv/eotvsection.php?entrycode=turnerted |title='&amp;#39;The Museum of Broadcast Communications'&amp;#39;: Ted Turner |publisher=Museum.tv |accessdate=2009-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1989 the [[Associated Press]] reported that two companies were producing color tests of ''Citizen Kane'' for Turner Entertainment. Criticism increased with the AP's report that filmmaker [[Henry Jaglom]] remembered that shortly before his death [[Orson Welles]] had implored him to protect ''Kane'' from being colorized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1989/Turner-Says-It-s-Testing-To-Colorize-Citizen-Kane-/id-4c23402df90437fb0816882f7e22ff27 |title=Turner Says It's Testing To Colorize 'Citizen Kane' |agency=[[Associated Press]], January 30, 1989 |accessdate=2014-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 14, 1989, Turner Entertainment president [[Roger Mayer (film industry executive)|Roger Mayer]] announced that work to colorize ''Citizen Kane'' had been stopped:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Our attorneys looked at the contract between [[RKO Pictures]] Inc. and Orson Welles and his production company, [[Mercury Theatre|Mercury Productions]] Inc., and, on the basis of their review, we have decided not to proceed with colorization of the movie. … While a court test might uphold our legal right to colorize the film, provisions of the contract could be read to prohibit colorization without permission of the Welles estate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1989/We-ll-Never-Know-If-Rosebud-Was-Red/id-3da27b3969212eb7885db3dbd81b597e |title=We'll Never Know If Rosebud Was Red |publisher=John Antczyk, Associated Press, February 14, 1989 |accessdate=2014-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One minute of the colorized test footage of ''Citizen Kane'' was included in a special ''[[Arena (UK TV series)|Arena]]'' documentary, ''The Complete Citizen Kane'', produced by the [[BBC]] in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wellesnet.com/?p=6476 |title=The Complete Citizen Kane’ documentary is now online |publisher=Wellesnet, May 13, 2013 |accessdate=2014-01-05}} The footage appears at approximately 1:17:00.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://explore.bfi.org.uk/4ce2b7b72e91f |title=The Complete Citizen Kane |publisher=[[British Film Institute]] |accessdate=2014-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Huston's opposition to the colorization of his work led to a landmark three-year French legal case after his death, sparked by a colorized version of ''[[The Asphalt Jungle]]''. His daughter [[Anjelica Huston]] successfully used [[French copyright law]] to set a binding precedent in 1991 that prevents the distribution or broadcasting in France of any colorized version of a film against the wishes of the original creator or their heirs.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/25/movies/film-makers-are-victors-in-a-lawsuit-on-coloring.html?n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/Subjects/C/Color|title=Film Makers Are Victors In a Lawsuit on Coloring |last=Riding|first=Alan|date=25 August 1991|work=New York Times|accessdate=2009-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Major legislative reaction in the United States was the [[National Film Preservation Act|National Film Preservation Act of 1988]] (Public Law 100-446), which prohibits any person from knowingly distributing or exhibiting to the public a film that has been materially altered, or a black and white film that has been colorized and is included in the Registry, unless such films are labeled disclosing specified information. This law also created the [[National Film Registry]].

Because of the high cost of the process, Turner Entertainment stopped colorizing titles. With the coming of [[DVD]] technology, the notion of colorization was once again gaining press. Because the DVD format was more versatile, studios could offer viewers the option to choose between both versions without switching discs, and thus, the release of colorized titles once again seemed profitable. Some companies re-released the older colorized versions from the 1980s—an example of this is the [[Laurel and Hardy]] box set being released in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dvdbeaver.com/film/DVDReviews16/laurel_and_hardy_collection_dvd_review.htm |title=The Laurel and Hardy Collection |accessdate=2007-01-01 |author= |authorlink= |work= |publisher=DVD Beaver |pages= |language= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other studios, such as [[Sony|Sony Entertainment]], commissioned West Wing Studios to colorize several [[Three Stooges]] films for DVD release. The studio was given access to the original [[Columbia Studios]] props and sets to lend authenticity to the colorized versions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/5651949 |title=Stooges DVD revives colorization debate |accessdate=2007-01-01 |author= |authorlink= |work= |publisher=[[MSNBC]] |pages= |language= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both film and television restoration and colorization is produced by the company [[Legend Films]]. Their patented automated process was used to colorize around 100 films between 2003 and 2009. [[Shirley Temple]], [[Jane Russell]], [[Terry Moore (actress)|Terry Moore]] and [[Ray Harryhausen]] have worked with the company to colorize either their own films or their personal favorites. Two movies that Legend Films are noted for is the colorization of the [[exploitation film]] ''[[Reefer Madness]]'', for which certain color schemes were used to create a psychedelic effect in its viewers, and ''[[Plan 9 from Outer Space]]''. Recently (2007), Legend Films colorized ''It's a Wonderful Life'' for [[Paramount Pictures]] (whose subsidiary, [[Republic Pictures]], had regained control of the copyright in the 1990s) and ''[[Holiday Inn (film)|Holiday Inn]]'' in 2008 for rights holder [[Universal Pictures]].

In 2004, a classic Indian film, ''[[Mughal-e-Azam]]'', was colored for theatrical release all over the world by a company called Indian Academy of Arts and Animation (IAAA) in association with Sankranti Creations. Founder of IAAA and Owner of [Sankranti creations], Rajeev Dwivedi used this technology for the first time in India.

In 2005, [[Sony Pictures Home Entertainment]] released the first season of ''[[Bewitched]]'' on DVD. Because the first season was produced in black-and-white, Sony released two versions of the set: one with the episodes as originally broadcast and a second with the episodes colorized. A year later, the second season of ''Bewitched'' and the first season of ''[[I Dream of Jeannie]]'', another show owned by Sony, were released the same way. These releases were colorized by Dynacs Digital Studios, a Florida-based company with film colorization and animation studios in Patna, India.

Colorization has also been used to restore scenes from color films that were cut from the finished product but were preserved in black-and-white. In 2018, the originally intended closing scene to the 1978 film ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]'' (in which the lead characters kiss) was added to the film's 40th anniversary release. A challenge that still plagues colorization efforts is the fact that the colorized black-and-white film may not match film shot originally in color; [[Randal Kleiser]], the director of ''Grease'', wanted to edit the scene back into the film but found the colors between the scenes did not match well enough to do so. Kleiser is optimistic that colorization technology will be advanced enough to match true color by 2028, when ''Grease'' reaches its 50th anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2018/05/21/grease-anniversary-danny-sandy-finally-get-their-movie-ending-kiss/625512002/|title=Danny and Sandy finally get their movie-ending 'Grease' kiss, 40 years after it was cut|first=Bryan|last=Alexander|work=USA Today|date=May 21, 2018|accessdate=May 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Documentary make-overs===
Colorization is sometimes used on [[documentary film|documentary]] programmes. ''[[The Beatles Anthology]]'' TV show colorizes some footage of the band, such as the performance of "[[All You Need Is Love]]" from the TV special ''[[Our World (TV special)|Our World]]'' (1967). In the documentary this scene begins in its original black-and-white before [[dissolve (film)|dissolving]] into seemingly realistic, [[psychedelia|psychedelic]] color.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.beatlesagain.com/breflib/anthvid.html |title=Anthology Home Video |accessdate=2007-01-01 |author= |authorlink= |work= |publisher=Beatles Reference Library |pages= |language= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The color design was based on color photographs taken at the same time as the special was shot.

The documentary series ''[[World War 1 in Colour]]'' (2003) was broadcast on television and released on DVD in 2005. There had previously been full-color documentaries about World War II using genuine color footage, but since true color film was not practical for moving pictures at the time of World War I, the series consists of colorized contemporary footage (and photographs). Several documentaries on the [[Military Channel]] feature colorized war footage from the Second World War and the [[Korean War]].

The 1960 [[Masters Tournament]], originally broadcast in black-and-white and recorded on [[kinescope]], was colorized by Legend Films for the documentary ''[[Jim Nantz Remembers]]''. This was the first time a major sports event had been re-broadcast using colorization.

In [[Peter Jackson]]'s 2018 [[First World War]] well-received documentary, ''[[They Shall Not Grow old]]'', black and white footage from the trenches was colourized.&lt;ref&gt;"The Times" report, 19 November 2018, page 3&lt;/ref&gt;

[[1958 NFL Championship Game|The Greatest Game Ever Played]], the 1958 [[National Football League|NFL]] Championship between the [[Baltimore Colts]] and the [[New York Giants]] was colorized by Legend Films for [[ESPN]] for a sports broadcast special in December 2008.

'''The Grand 1894 Opera House''' in [[Galveston, Texas]] is currently operated as a not-for-profit performing arts theatre. The [[Romanesque Revival architecture|Romanesque Revival]] style Opera House is located at 2020 Post Office Street in Galveston's Historic Downtown Cultural Arts District. It was named "The Official Opera House of Texas" in 1993 by the 73rd Texas Legislature.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thegrand.com/history.asp&lt;/ref&gt; It has a seating capacity of 1,040.&lt;ref&gt;http://conventionsouth.com/business-directory/9569/the-grand-1894-opera-house/&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In 1894, Henry Greenwall (often spelled Greenwald) raised $100,000 for construction of The Grand Opera House and Hotel in [[Galveston, Texas|Galveston]]. It opened on January 3, 1895 with a live performance of the play, ''The Daughters of Eve''.

The Grand has stood through notable hurricanes, including the [[Galveston Hurricane of 1900]], [[Galveston Hurricane of 1915]], [[Hurricane Carla]], and [[Hurricane Ike]]. The Grand began as a major, live performing arts theatre but after passing through a [[Vaudeville]] phase, it slowly evolved into a movie house. The movie house closed in 1974 and was purchased the same year by the Galveston County Cultural Arts Council. They transformed the movie house back into a theatre and then renovated and restored it to its former beauty. The restoration included volunteer efforts and support from private foundations. The theatre was listed in the [[National Register of Historic Places]] as "1894 Grand Opera House" in 1974.&lt;ref name="nris" /&gt; The Galveston County Cultural Arts Council owned the Opera House until 1986, when it became a stand-alone organization known as 1894, Inc. Maureen M. Patton is The Grand's Executive Director, having served as Director under the Arts Council beginning in 1981. Hurricane Ike hit Galveston Island on September 13, 2008, but The Grand was reopened on January 3, 2009 on its 114th anniversary. All of the damage that the hurricane and the flood had caused was repaired with only 92 days of construction.

The Grand also has been the presenter of several premieres: ''Red White &amp; Tuna'' and ''Tuna Does Vegas'', two of four comedic plays written and performed by ''[[Greater Tuna]]'' creators, Jaston Williams and Joe Sears; and ''ANN'', a one-woman play about the life of Texas Governor Ann Richards, written and performed by [[Holland Taylor]].

== Architecture ==
[[File:1894_Grand_Opera_House_Galveston.jpg|thumb]]
"When it opened in 1895, the 70' x 37' x 69' stage was THE LARGEST IN THE STATE OF TEXAS and one of the largest in the country... Even today, a stage whisper can be heard without a microphone, and no seat is more than 70 feet from the stage."

The Grand has been through natural disasters, such as fires and hurricanes, as well as neglect during its time as a movie house. It has been rebuilt and remodeled more than once, such as during the devastating [[Galveston Hurricane of 1900]], when its rear wall and roof caved in.

The front wall of the building is made of red stone, brick, and terra cotta; the large, glass doors are framed by a carved, Romanesque style stone arch. Inside, the glass box office sits in between the two sets of doors. The carpet is a historic pattern of colors found in the decorative curtain and stenciling of roses and scrolls on the ceiling and boxes. The floors are marble tile, and the walls are wainscot. The banisters and railings are of long leaf red-heart pine, like the wainscot. A large, bronze statue of a woman holding a torch stands on the newel post on The Grand staircase. Inside the theater auditorium, red, velvet curtains frame the stage and eight opera boxes. Blue velour lines the chairs. The stage curtain (originally painted by architect Frank Cox) is a replication of the original, depicting “Sappho and Companions”.

In the 1990s, after playing the lead female role in the short-lived ''[[My Life and Times]]'', Hunt starred in the series ''[[Mad About You]]'', winning Emmy Awards for her performances in 1996, 1997, 1998, and 1999.&lt;ref name=tca/&gt; For the last year of the show she and Paul Reiser became the first actors ever to be paid $1,000,000 per episode.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Hunt directed several episodes of ''Mad About You'', including the series finale.

In 2012, she starred alongside [[John Hawkes (actor)|John Hawkes]] and [[William H. Macy]] in [[The Sessions (film)|''The Sessions'']] as sex surrogate [[Cheryl Cohen-Greene]].

The movie also gained two awards at the Sundance Film Festival. The role required Hunt to perform multiple scenes of [[Nudity in film|full-frontal nudity]]. Hunt further said: ""Being naked was challenging, but even more than that was the vulnerability. I felt vulnerable because I was naked. I felt vulnerable because we were having such a vulnerable moment in this character's life. This was a real journey that someone had gone on, and I wanted to do right by that."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.popsugar.co.uk/love/photo-gallery/45083061/image/45082981/Helen-Hunt|title=Helen Hunt|last=Block|first=Tara|work=POPSUGAR Love UK|access-date=2018-10-24|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Islamic miniatures''' are small [[painting]]s on [[paper]], usually book or manuscript illustrations but also sometimes separate artworks. The earliest examples date from around 1000 AD, with a flourishing of the artform from around 1200 AD. The field is divided by scholars into four types, [[Arabic miniature|Arabic]],  [[Mughal painting|Mughal (Indian)]],  [[Ottoman miniature|Ottoman (Turkish)]], and  [[Persian miniature|Persian]].&lt;ref name=DavidCollection&gt;{{cite web |title=Miniature Painting |url=https://www.davidmus.dk/en/collections/islamic/materials/miniatures |publisher=The David Collection |accessdate=30 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MMA1933"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Islamic Miniature Painting and Book Illumination|journal=Bulletin of the Metropolitan Museum of Art|date=October 1933|volume=28|issue=10|pages=166–171|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/pubs/bulletins/1/pdf/3255467.pdf.bannered.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Joseph C. Lewis''' (born 5 February 1937) is a British businessman and investor, who currently lives in [[New Providence]] in the [[Bahamas]].

Lewis' total wealth is estimated at $US5 billion, and he is listed as the 388th richest person in ''[[Forbes]]''’ 2018 list of billionaires. Forbes reported that Lewis is the 12th wealthiest person in the UK, {{as of|2018|3|lc=y}}.&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt;

==Early life==
Lewis was born to a [[British Jews|Jewish]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ejpress.org/article/7664 European Jewish Press: "Jewish businessmen prominent in British 'Rich List'"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414013555/http://www.ejpress.org/article/7664 |date=14 April 2012 }} 24 April 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324439804578112891365453074?mod=WSJ_topics_obama Wall Street Journal: "Star of David, For Entertainment Only"] 11 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt; family above a [[public house]] in Roman Road, [[Bow, London]].&lt;ref name= "The East Ender"&gt;Luscombe, Richard and Teather, David. [https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/mar/22/creditcrunch.moneyinvestments "The East Ender who blew a billion dollars in a day"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 22 March 2008. Retrieved 1 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Lewis left school at 15 to help run his father's [[West End of London|West End]] catering business, Tavistock Banqueting. When he took the reins, he quickly expanded it by selling luxury goods to American tourists, and also owned West End club the Hanover Grand, where he gave [[Robert Earl]] his first job.&lt;ref name= "The East Ender"/&gt; He later sold the business in 1979 to make his initial wealth.

==Currency trading==
After selling the family business in the late 1970s, Lewis moved into [[currency trading]] in the 1980s and 1990s, resulting in his move to the Bahamas where he is now a [[tax exile]].&lt;ref name= "The East Ender"/&gt; In September 1992, Lewis teamed up with [[George Soros]] to bet on the pound crashing out of the [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism]]. The event, which was dubbed [[Black Wednesday]], made Lewis very wealthy, and some say he made more than Soros.&lt;ref name= "Profile"&gt;Bowers, Simon. [https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/sep/14/2 "Profile: Joe Lewis"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 14 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/joe-lewis | work=Forbes | title=Billionaires: March 2011 - Profile: Joe Lewis}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lewis is still an active [[Foreign exchange market|foreign exchange trader]].&lt;ref name="World’s Billionaires 2013"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/joe-lewis/| work=Forbes| title=World’s Billionaires 2013 | date=4 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tavistock Group==
{{main|Tavistock Group}}
Lewis is the main investor in Tavistock Group, which owns more than 200 companies in 15 countries. Tavistock Group's portfolio includes:
*Lake Nona Medical City
*Life sciences
*Sports teams: [[Tottenham Hotspur]] via [[ENIC Group]]. Formerly owned stakes in [[Glasgow Rangers F.C.]] and [[Slavia Prague]].&lt;ref name= "The East Ender"/&gt;

===Property===
Lewis hosts the [[Tavistock Cup]] tournament every March in Florida, raising millions of dollars for charity, and owns three of the four clubs that compete: Albany, [[Lake Nona Golf &amp; Country Club]] and [[Isleworth Golf &amp; Country Club]]. Lewis built a golf community in the Bahamas called Albany, which opened in October 2010. Tiger Woods and Ernie Els are also major shareholders in the luxury resort community located in New Providence. Lewis made a £70 million investment in Bulgarian property development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/construction_and_property/article2510919.ece | title=Joe Lewis takes aim at Bulgaria | author=Jenny Davey | publisher=''[[The Sunday Times]]'' | date=27 September 2007 | accessdate=14 March 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Lake Nona Medical City====
{{main|Lake Nona Medical City}}
Lewis seeded Lake Nona, covering 7,000 acres next to Orlando’s international airport, with $100 million in gifts and land which was cultivated into a large-scale community offering research and educational facilities, hospitals for veterans and children, a town center, and a range of workspaces and residential options.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/08/realestate/08medical.html | work=New York Times | title=Orlando’s Newest Attraction Is Medical | date=7 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Escondido Lake and controversy====
Since Lewis bought a property in [[Río Negro Province]], Argentina, public access to Escondido lake has been under discussion. The Argentine law asserts that every water course is public and of free access.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarin.com/politica/joe-lewis-magnate-lago-escondido_0_V1cE1_yCl.html ¿Quién es Joe Lewis, el magnate dueño de Lago Escondido?], Clarín, 26 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 Lewis was ordered by the Superior Tribunal de Justicia (STJ) to create and keep access to the lake, with "sufficient signage and to keep it transitable", but the ruling has not been enforced. Lewis' frontman Van Ditmer stated: "We are going to defend the private property with the Winchester in the hands; with blood if needed".&lt;ref name="cholilaonline.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cholilaonline.com/2017/01/joe-lewis-el-verdadero-patron-del-mal.html|title=Joe Lewis, el verdadero patrón del mal de la Patagonia|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lewis' property encircles the lake. While some have called for another public mountain trail to be built to access the lake, El Consejo de Ecología y Medio Ambiente de Río Negro (the Council of Ecology and Environment of Río Negro) does not support building another pass, which would cause harm to the environmentally protected area.

He is currently planning to use a huge protected area, 4 times the size of the city of Buenos Aires, for another private development, against the wishes of the locals. The property was bought for 69 pesos per hectare, currently about $4 USD. This low price was secured by using the name of a local 'poblador' on the deed, after which it was transferred to him. It is suggested that the Hidden Lake property is needed to supply water and (hydraulic) energy to this new property, dubbed the private state in Patagonia. In January 2017, new mass protests have started in El Bolson against this project.&lt;ref name="cholilaonline.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cholilaonline.com/2017/01/dia-historico-en-el-bolson-mas-de-15.html|title=Día histórico en El Bolsón: Más de 15 mil personas marcharon contra el loteo de Joe Lewis|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bear Stearns===
{{main|Bear Stearns}}
On 10 September 2007, Lewis paid [[US$]]860.4 million in an all-cash purchase of a 7% stake in Bear Stearns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=aasVn8g.o2Js&amp;refer=home | work=Bloomberg | title=Bear Stearns Gains on Speculation About Stake Sale (Update5) | date=26 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; By December 2007 Lewis had raised his stake at the brokerage firm to 9.4%, a total of 11 million shares, for which he paid an average price of $107 apiece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601213&amp;sid=aIOoem3ab3bo&amp;refer=home | work=Bloomberg | title=Lewis, Barrow Hanley Lose Combined $2 Billion on Bear (Update2) | date=17 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the purchase of [[Bear Stearns]] by [[JP Morgan]] for $10 a share, it was estimated that Lewis lost $1.16 billion on his investment.&lt;ref name= "The East Ender"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB120571021671940207 | work=The Wall Street Journal | title=A Stake Through the Heart | first=Cassell | last=Bryan-Low | date=17 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalalchemy.tv/2008/03/joseph-lewis-lost-1-billion-in-bear.html|title=Joseph Lewis: "I Lost $1 Billion in Bear Stearns"|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mitchells &amp; Butlers===
{{main|Mitchells &amp; Butlers}}
Lewis is the largest shareholder in the British [[public house]] group Mitchells &amp; Butlers, controlling 26.85% of the issued share capital through his investment vehicle Piedmont, which he built up since 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/sep/18/mitchells-butlers-no-one-to-call-time | author=Jenny Davey | accessdate=24 September 2011 | work=The Guardian | title=Mitchells &amp; Butlers: the giant pub company with no one to call 'time' | location=London | date=18 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://jc-thn-ws3.thejc.com/business/alex-brummer-business/32817/joe-lewis-still-has-midas-touch The Jewish Chronicle: "Joe Lewis still has that midas touch" by Alex Brummer] 10 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt; It was reported on 27 August 2011 that Lewis had made a zero premium proposal for the pub group of 224p a share. He later revealed on 12 September 2011 that he was considering raising his earlier offer to 230p a share, a 4.5% premium. However, independent M&amp;B board members rejected the offer as "significantly undervaluing" the business.

==Personal life==
Lewis has been married twice. 
His first marriage to Esther Browne ended in divorce. They had two children: 
Vivienne Lewis Silverton is seen as his "heir"&lt;ref name= "The East Ender"/&gt; and serves on Tavistock's board of directors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tavistock.com/team/ Tavistock Website: Board of Directors] retrieved 8 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cityam.com/the-capitalist/harriet-dennys/joe-lewis-clan-bears-his-fourth-generation City AM: "JOE LEWIS CLAN BEARS HIS FOURTH GENERATION" by HARRIET DENNYS] 23 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt; She is divorced from Toby Silverton, the former chairman of [[Bristol Cars]], once fully owned by Tavistock.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bristolcars.co.uk/past/#2 Britol Cars: "The end of the second era - 1997-2011"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130310235540/http://www.bristolcars.co.uk/past/ |date=10 March 2013 }} retrieved 31 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/02/11/bristol-cars-exclusive-anonymity/ New York Times: "Bristol Cars: Exclusive Anonymity" By NICK KURCZEWSKI] 11 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thisisbristol.co.uk/Undefined-Headline/story-11237972-detail/story.html This Is Bristol: "Bristol Cars - Memorable Motors" by Gerry Brook] 8 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
Charles Lewis lives in Argentina,&lt;ref name= "The East Ender"/&gt; Lewis is now married to Jane Lewis.&lt;ref name= "The East Ender"/&gt;

==Art collection==
Lewis' art collection is estimated to be worth $1 billion, includes works by [[Picasso]], [[Matisse]], [[Lucian Freud]] and sculptor [[Henry Moore]].&lt;ref name="World’s Billionaires 2013"/&gt; Lewis bought [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]]'s ''Triptych 1974–1977'' in 2008 for £26.3 million,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/feb/07/art.artnews |author=Mark Brown |title=What recession?

[[File:Katy Perry - Part Of Me Australian Premiere - June 2012 (9).jpg|left|thumb|180px|Perry at the premiere of ''Part of Me'' in Australia.]]

'''Lambert &amp; Bunnell''' was a long-lived [[United States|American]] [[architect|architectural firm]] from [[Bridgeport, Connecticut]], in business from 1860 to 1901. It was established by Edward R. Lambert and Rufus W. Bunnell.

==Partner biographies==

'''Edward Richard Lambert''' was a life-long resident of Bridgeport. His father, also named Edward R. Lambert, was a surveyor. In the mid-1850s he worked for local architect Albert C. Nash, where he first met Bunnell. About 1855 he established himself as an architect.&lt;ref&gt;Golovin, Anne C. ''Bridgeport's Gothic Ornament: the Harral-Wheeler House''. 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1858 Bunnell was briefly a draftsman in his office, but then lived in [[North Carolina]] for two years. In 1860 Bunnell returned, and the two formed a partnership, Lambert &amp; Bunnell. They remained associated until Lambert fell ill in 1901.&lt;ref name="Bunnell"&gt;[http://drs.library.yale.edu/HLTransformer/HLTransServlet?stylename=yul.ead2002.xhtml.xsl&amp;pid=mssa:ms.1149&amp;clear-stylesheet-cache=yes "Guide to the Bunnell Family Papers"]. n.d.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rufus William Bunnell''' was born in Bridgeport on February 11, 1835. He attended the public schools. He began his architectural training in 1852 with Chauncey Graham, a local builder-architect. In 1854 he entered the office of Bridgeport architect Albert C. Nash, where he and Lambert met. The following year he went to [[Trenton, New Jersey]] to work for Graham, who had reestablished his office there. After a few months he went to [[Toledo, Ohio]], to work for Frank J. Scott. In 1857-58 he worked briefly for Woollett &amp; Ogden in [[Albany, NY|Albany]], and for Lambert in Bridgeport. In 1858 he went south to [[Wilmington, North Carolina]] for be the designer for James F. Post, a builder. For Post he worked on the [[Bellamy Mansion]] in Wilmington, begun 1859. In 1860 he returned to Bridgeport, establishing his partnership with Lambert. He was with the Union Army from 1862-1863, but otherwise remained associated with Lambert until 1901. After Lambert fell ill that year, the partnership was dissolved and Bunnell worked from his home in [[Stratford, CT|Stratford]]. He died in 1909.&lt;ref name="Bunnell"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20127">This is a '''list of books in [[computational geometry]].'''
There are two major, largely nonoverlapping categories:
*Combinatorial computational geometry, which deals with collections of discrete objects or defined in discrete terms: points, lines, polygons, polytopes, etc., and algorithms of discrete/combinatorial character are used
*Numerical computational geometry, also known as [[geometric modeling]] and [[computer-aided geometric design]] (CAGD), which deals with modelling of shapes of real-life objects in terms of curves and surfaces with algebraic representation.

==Combinatorial computational geometry==

===General-purpose textbooks===
* {{cite book
|authors = [[Franco P. Preparata]] and [[Michael Ian Shamos]] | title = Computational Geometry - An Introduction | publisher = [[Springer-Verlag]]| year = 1985 | id = 1st edition: {{ISBN|0-387-96131-3}}; 2nd printing, corrected and expanded, 1988: {{ISBN|3-540-96131-3}}; Russian translation, 1989: {{ISBN|5-03-001041-6}}}}
*:The book is the first comprehensive monograph on the level of a graduate textbook to systematically cover the fundamental aspects of the emerging discipline of computational geometry. It is written by founders of the field and the first edition covered all major developments in the preceding 10 years. In the aspect of comprehensiveness it was preceded only by the 1984 survey paper, Lee, D, T., Preparata, F. P. : "Computational geometry - a survey". ''[[IEEE Trans. on Computers]]''. Vol. 33, No. 12, pp.&amp;nbsp;1072–1101 (1984). It is focused on two-dimensional problems, but also has digressions into higher dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{MR|0805539}}, {{MR|1004870}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Zbl|0575.68037}}, {{Zbl|0575.68059}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*:The initial core of the book was M.I.Shamos' doctoral dissertation, which was suggested to turn into a book by a yet another pioneer in the field, [[Ronald Graham]].
*:The introduction covers the history of the field, basic data structures, and necessary notions from the [[theory of computation]] and geometry.
*:The subsequent sections cover [[geometric searching]] ([[point location]], [[range searching]]), [[convex hull]] computation, proximity-related problems ([[closest points]], computation and applications of the [[Voronoi diagram]], [[Euclidean minimum spanning tree]], [[triangulation]]s, etc.), [[geometric intersection problems]], algorithms for sets of [[isothetic rectangle]]s

*:The monograph is a rather advanced exposition of problems and approaches in computational geometry focused on the role of [[hyperplane arrangement]]s, which are shown to constitute a basic underlying combinatorial-geometric structure in certain areas of the field. The primary target audience are active theoretical researchers in the field, rather than application developers. Unlike most of books in computational geometry focused on 2- and 3-dimensional problems (where most applications of computational geometry are), the book aims to treat its subject in the general multi-dimensional setting.&lt;ref&gt;A review of Edelsbrunner's book in {{Zbl|0634.52001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*:The textbook provides an introduction to computation geometry from the point of view of practical applications. Starting with an introduction chapter, each of the 15 remaining ones formulates a real application problem, formulates an underlying geometrical problem, and discusses techniques of computational geometry useful for its solution, with algorithms provided in pseudocode. The book treats mostly 2- and 3-dimensional geometry. The goal of the book is to provide a comprehensive introduction into methods and approached, rather than the cutting edge of the research in the field: the presented algorithms provide transparent and reasonably efficient solutions based on fundamental "building blocks" of computational geometry.&lt;ref&gt;Reviews in {{Zbl|0877.68001}} (1st ed.), {{Zbl|0939.68134}} (2nd ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.uu.nl/geobook/ About the book by de Berg, van Kreveld, Overmars, and Schwarzkopf]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''miracle of the roses''' is a [[miracle]] in which [[rose]]s manifest an activity of [[God in Christianity|God]] or of a [[saint]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lafaye|first=Jacques|year=1987|title=Quetzalcoatl and Guadaloupe: The Formation of Mexican National Consciousness, 1531-1813|pages=55|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|isbn=0-521-42018-0|accessdate=11 December 2008|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fWJJua4aoGcC&amp;pg=PA55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a miracle is presented in various [[hagiography|hagiographies]] and [[legend]]s in different forms,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Klaniczay|first=Gábor|year=2002|title=Holy Rulers and Blessed Princesses: Dynastic Cults in Medieval Central Europe|page=422|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=0-521-42018-0|accessdate=11 December 2008|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tz12J0Eb9eUC&amp;pg=RA1-PA422&amp;dq=%22Miracle+of+the+roses%22+%22hagiography%22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it occurs in connection with diverse individuals such as Saints [[Elizabeth of Hungary]] (1207–1231), [[Elizabeth of Portugal]] (1271–1336), St. Dorothy, a 4th-century virgin martyr at Caesarea in Cappadocia (died ca. 311), and [[Our Lady of Guadalupe]] (appeared in 1531).

==Symbolism of the rose==
[[File:Niccolo Betti San Diego de Alcalá Descalzas Reales - Adobe Reader.jpg|thumb|Niccolo Betti San Diego de Alcalá Descalzas Reales]]
In the Latin West the symbolism of the rose is of Greco-Roman heritage but influenced by and finally transformed through Latin biblical and liturgical texts. In Greco-Roman culture the rose's symbolic qualities represented beauty, the season of spring, and love.  It also spoke of the fleetness of life, and therefore of death.  In Rome the feast called "[[Rosalia (festival)|Rosalia]]" was a feast of the dead: thus the flower referred to the next world.&lt;ref name=koehler&gt;[http://campus.udayton.edu/mary/rosarymarkings36.html Koehler, S.M., Rev. Theodore A., "The Christian Symbolism of the Rose"], ''Roses and the Arts: A Cultural and Horticultural Engagement'', Central State University, Wilberforce, Ohio, May 8, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

This symbolism attained a deeper complexity when contrasted with the rose's thorns.  This contrast inspired the Christian Latin poet [[Coelius Sedulius]], who wrote (between 430-450) a very elaborate comparison between [[Eve]], our first mother, and [[Mary, the Mother of Jesus]] our Savior. He illustrated the parallelism already made by [[Justin Martyr]] (around 150) and developed it in a deep poetic and doctrinal liturgical teaching in his Easter song, ''Carmen paschal''.&lt;ref name=koehler/&gt;
[[File:Elisabeth roses.jpg|thumb|140px|left|&lt;center&gt;''St. Elisabeth of Thuringia, Miracle of the roses''&lt;/center&gt;]]
The rose was a privileged symbol for Mary, Queen of heaven and earth.  We see this development later during the Middle Ages, when the rose became an attribute of many other holy women, including [[Elizabeth of Hungary]], [[Elizabeth of Portugal]], [[Casilda of Toledo]], and for the [[martyr]]s in general.  The rose is even a symbol for Christ himself, as seen in the German Christmas song, "es ist ein 'Rose' entsprungen."&lt;ref name=koehler/&gt;

During the Middle Ages the rose was cultivated in monastery gardens and used for medicinal purposes. It became a symbol in religious writing and iconography in different images and settings, to invoke a variety of intellectual and emotional responses.&lt;ref name=carleton&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carleton|first=Sarah|title=A rose is a rose is a rose:The Rose as Symbol in the Ars antiqua Motet|journal=Discourses in Music|date=Spring 2004|volume=5|issue=1|url=http://www.discourses.ca/v5n1a1.html|accessdate=15 December 2012|publisher=Univ. of Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mystic rose appears in Dante's ''[[Divine Comedy]]'', where it represents God's love. By the twelfth century, the red rose had come to represent [[Passion (Christianity)|Christ's passion]], and the blood of the martyrs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book   | last = Wilson  | first = Jean C.  | title = Excavating the Medieval Image: Manuscripts, Artists, Audiences; Essays in Honor of Sandra Hindman  | chapter = 'Richement et pompeusement parée': the ''collier'' of Margaret of York and the politics of love in late medieval Burgundy  | publisher = Ashgate  | year = 2004  | pages = 109–134  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=dez8trnjfbUC  | isbn = 978-0-7546-3143-9}} 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common association of the rose is with the Virgin Mary. The third-century [[Saint Ambrose]] believed that there were roses in the Garden of Eden, initially without thorns, but which became thorny after the fall, and came to symbolize [[Original Sin]] itself. Thus the Blessed Virgin is often referred to as the 'rose without thorns', since she was immaculately conceived. Saint [[Bernard of Clairvaux ]] compared her virginity to a white rose and her charity to a red rose. With the rise of Marian devotion and the [[Gothic cathedral]] in the twelfth century, the image of the rose became even more prominent in religious life. Cathedrals built around this time usually include a [[rose window]], dedicated to the Virgin, at the end of a transept or above the entrance. The thirteenth century [[Saint Dominic]] is credited with the institution of the [[Rosary]], a series of prayers to the Virgin, symbolized by garlands of roses worn in Heaven.&lt;ref name=carleton/&gt;

==Saint Elizabeth of Hungary==
[[File:Pietro Nelli - Elizabeth van Hongarije.JPG|thumb|upright|Elisabeth of Hungary with roses]]
In Western Europe, the best-known version of a miracle of the roses concerns Saint Elizabeth of Hungary (also called Elisabeth of Thuringia), the daughter of King [[Andrew II of Hungary]], who spent most of her life living with her in-laws in Germany (a ruling family of [[List of rulers of Thuringia|Thuringia]]), who kept court at [[Wartburg Castle]].&lt;ref name="reber"/&gt;

===Origins===
It has been suggested that the legend originated in a sermon given by [[Caesarius of Heisterbach]] in which he reflects on the occasion of the [[Translation (relics)|translation]] of the remains of Saint Elizabeth, in 1236. Caesarius speaks of a sweet aroma that emanates from the grave as soon as it is opened (a common theme in [[hagiography]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Maresch|first=Maria|title=Elisabeth von Thüringen: Schutzfrau des deutschen Volkes|place=Bonn|publisher=Verlag der Buchgemeinde|year=1931|page=220|isbn=}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This metaphorical or actual aroma could have been translated into a physical event, the miracle of the roses.&lt;ref name="reber"&gt;{{cite book|last=Reber|first=Ortrud|title=Die heilige Elisabeth: Leben und Legende|place=St. Ottilien|year=1982|ref=Reber1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The first report of a miracle resembling that of the roses is by [[Franciscan]]s in the mid-13th century. Their account is of spring flowers, and the event takes place in [[Hungary]], at Elizabeth's home when she was five years old.&lt;ref name="Hohberg72"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hohberg|first=Rainer|last2=Weigelt|first2=Sylvia|title=Brot und Rosen: Das Leben der heiligen Elisabeth in Sagen und Legenden|place=Wartburg|publisher=Wartburg Verlag|year=2006|ref=Hohberg2006|isbn=978-3-86160-183-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The miracle as we know it, with roses and in Germany, is first reported in 1332, in a Franciscan book of prayers,&lt;ref name="reber"/&gt; though it has also been proposed that the miracle was "translated" from Elizabeth of Portugal to Elisabeth of Hungary in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pörnbacher|first=Hans|year=2003|title=Die hl.

One day the young but pious Elizabeth, in the company of one or more serving women, descends from [[Wartburg Castle]] down to the village of [[Eisenach]], below the castle. She is carrying meat, eggs, and bread under her mantle. Supposedly she has taken items from the family dining table to distribute to the poor in the village, against the wishes of her family, who frown upon such behavior. Halfway down, she unexpectedly meets her husband [[Ludwig IV of Thuringia]], who asks, upon seeing her bulk, what she is carrying. Embarrassed and speechless as she is, she does not know what to say. Ludwig opens her mantle, and to his surprise (in some versions this takes place in the dead of winter) finds her carrying a bouquet of roses.&lt;ref name="Hohberg72"/&gt;

====Saint Elizabeth of Portugal====
Very much the same story is told of [[Elizabeth of Portugal]], also known as Elizabeth of Aragon (1271–4 July 1336), who was the great-niece of Elizabeth of Hungary. Married to the profligate King [[Denis of Portugal]], she, like her great-aunt, showed great devotion at an early age, and likewise was charitable toward the poor, against the wishes of her husband. Caught one day by her husband, while carrying bread in her apron, the food was turned into roses. Since this occurred in January, King Denis reportedly had no response and let his wife continue. The story is somewhat apocryphal; while it shows up in popular versions of the saint's life,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

====Saint Didacus of Alcalá====

Of the 15th-century [[Franciscan]] St. [[Didacus of Alcalá]], also known as San Diego, the same miracle is told: as a lay brother of the Franciscans in Spain, he often took bread from the monastery's dining table to give to the poor. One day, leaving the convent with a cloak full of food, he was accused and challenged to open his cloak; miraculously, the loaves of bread had changed into roses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

[[File:Juan-Diego.jpg|thumb|140px|&lt;center&gt;[[Miguel Cabrera (painter)|Miguel Cabrera]], ''Juan Diego''&lt;/center&gt;]]
The story of [[Our Lady of Guadalupe]] is of an entirely different character, although here again the miraculous presence of the roses in the middle of winter is a sign of the presence of the divinity. The account is a corollary to a [[Marian apparition]], Our Lady of Guadalupe, found in the 1556 booklet [[Nican Mopohua]], and supposedly taking place in 1531.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt; It concerns a native inhabitant of [[Mexico]] named [[Juan Diego]], whom the Virgin chooses to convey a message to an unwilling bishop, that "Here I will hear their weeping, their sorrow and will remedy and alleviate all their multiple sufferings, necessities and misfortunes." The bishop however, does not believe Diego's story. He returns to his field, where again the Virgin appears to him, with the same message. Diego again goes to the bishop, with the same result, and the remark that he has to bring a token if he is to be believed. The fourth time the Virgin appears, she directs Diego toward "varied Castilian flowers" which he picks; she then places the flowers in his mantle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

== Saint Rita of Cascia ==
[[File:Rapallo-chiesa san Francesco-dipinto4.jpg|thumb|140px|left|&lt;center&gt;St. Rita of Cascia&lt;/center&gt;]]
A miracle involving roses occurred to Saint [[Rita of Cascia]]. The winter before the end of her life, a cousin visited her and asked her if she desired anything from her old home at Roccaporena. Saint Rita responded by asking for a rose and a fig from the garden. It was January and her cousin did not expect to find anything due to the snowy weather. However, when her relative went to the house, a single blooming rose was found in the garden, as well as a fully ripened and edible fig. Her cousin brought the rose and fig back to Saint Rita at the convent, who thanked her and gave the rose to her sisters.

The rose is thought to represent God's love for Rita and Rita's ability to intercede on behalf of lost causes or impossible cases. Rita is often depicted holding roses or with roses nearby, and on her feast day, churches and shrines of Saint Rita provide roses to the congregation that are blessed by priests during [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]].

=== Statement of Pope John Paul II ===
On the occasion of the centenary of the canonization of Saint Rita of Cascia, Pope John Paul II stated that the worldwide devotion to Saint Rita is symbolized by the rose, and said: "It is to be hoped that the life of everyone devoted to her will be like the rose picked in the garden of Roccaporena the winter before the saint's death. That is, let it be a life sustained by passionate love for the Lord Jesus; a life capable of responding to suffering and to thorns with forgiveness and the total gift of self, in order to spread everywhere the good odour of Christ (cf. {{bibleverse|2|Cor|2:15|ESV}}) through a consistently lived proclamation of the Gospel."  He added that Saint Rita spiritually offers her rose to each of those he addressed as an exhortation to "live as witnesses to a hope that never disappoints and as missionaries of a life that conquers death".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/speeches/2000/apr-jun/documents/hf_jp-ii_spe_20000520_santa-rita_en.html |title= Address of Holy Father John Paul II on the centenary of St. Rita's canonization. |date= 20 May 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''mono.kultur''''' is a quarterly magazine publishing interviews with creatives in the arts and culture in a wider sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=mono.kultur Website|url=http://mono-kultur.com/|accessdate=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each issue features a single in-depth interview and dedicates the entire issue to the interviewee. With this radical focus on only one feature the editorial design adapts to the theme of the interview, the only constant being an unconventional [[DIN A5|DIN A5-Format]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=One Track Mind - Interview with Kai von Rabenau|url=http://www.imaginepub.com/one-track-mind-an-interview-with-kai-von-rabenau-of-mono.kultur-magazine|website=Imaginepub|accessdate=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview with Kai von Rabenau|url=http://hugohoppmann.com/blog/interview-with-kai-von-rabenau-mono-kultur/|website=Hugohoppmann|accessdate=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Avant/garde Diaries|url=https://vimeo.com/35686721|title=Frank Leder &amp; Kai von Rabenau - Ultimate Fanzine|website=Vimeo|accessdate=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and profile==
''mono.kultur'' was founded in 2005 in Berlin. The magazine is published in English and distributed worldwide. Founder and publisher is Kai von Rabenau. The editorial team consists of 10 independent editors and 6 more contributing editors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=mono.kultur Colophon|url=http://mono-kultur.com/colophon/|accessdate=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview with Kai von Rabenau|url=http://hugohoppmann.com/blog/interview-with-kai-von-rabenau-mono-kultur/|website=Hugohoppmann|accessdate=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=At Work with Kai von Rabenau|url=http://magculture.com/at-work-with-kai-von-rabenau-mono-kultur/|accessdate=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Klanten, Mollard, and Hübner described mono.kultur in their 2011 book on Self-Publishing Culture: "Incidentally, many of mono.kultur's chosen protagonists are surprised and delighted by the scope and space of the chosen format. For once, they are encouraged to speak out about topics, interest and ideas usually glossed over in targeted lifestyle features, half-hour promo interviews, or narrow specialist publications. Complementing this rich content, the small, beautifully compact magazine is designed by a changing rosting of invitees who spice up the thematic mono.kultur with their own aesthetic interpretation."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Klanten | first1 = R. | last2 = Mollard | first2 = A. | last3 = Hübner | first3 = M. | title = [[Behind the Zines: Zines and their role as a catalyst in the evolution of media and graphic design today]] | place = Berlin | publisher = [[Gestalten Verlag]] |pages = 170–171 | date = March 2011 | isbn = 978-3-89955-336-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Nantgarw China Works''' was a [[porcelain]] factory, later making other types of [[pottery]], located in [[Nantgarw]] on the eastern bank of the [[Glamorganshire Canal]], {{convert|8|mi}} north of [[Cardiff]] in the [[River Taff]] valley, [[Glamorganshire]], [[Wales]]. 
The factory made porcelain of very high quality, especially in the years from 1813-1814 and 1817-1820.  The body was extremely white and translucent, and was given [[overglaze decoration]] of high quality, mostly in London or elsewhere rather than at the factory.  The wares were expensive, and mostly distributed through the London dealers.  Plates were much the most common shapes made, and the decoration was typically of garlands of flowers in a profusion of colours, the speciality of the founder, [[William Billingsley (artist)|William Billingsley]].  With [[Swansea porcelain]], Nantgarw was one of the last factories to make [[soft-paste porcelain]], when English factories had switched to [[bone china]], and continental and Asian ones continued to make [[hard-paste porcelain]].&lt;ref&gt;Battie, 147; Honey, 314-323&lt;/ref&gt; 

The history of the ownership and management of the factory is complicated.  The first formula, used in 1813-14, gave excellent results, but had an unacceptably high wastage rate, being very prone to deform ("slump") during firing. This formula was also being used at Swansea, and pieces can be impossible to allocate between the two with confidence. After a period of experimentation, in 1817-1820 the original paste formula was used again.&lt;ref&gt;Honey, 314-316; Battie, 147&lt;/ref&gt;     

After ceasing to make or decorate porcelain in the 1820s, and a period of closure, the pottery reopened in 1833, making [[earthenware]] and [[stoneware]], as well as [[Smoking pipe (tobacco)|clay pipe]]s, before finally closing in 1920, when [[cigarettes]] had replaced pipes.  The site is now a museum, and also a working pottery. In 2017 a limited quantity of porcelain was made there, using the original formula, as reconstructed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-42269441 BBC Wales: "Nantgarw China Works porcelain produced after 200 years"], 10 December, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;  

==History==
Established in November 1813, when artist and [[Pottery|potter]] [[William Billingsley (artist)|William Billingsley]] and his son-in-law Samuel Walker, a skilled technician, rented "Nantgarw House" on the eastern bank of the [[Glamorganshire Canal]], eight miles north of [[Cardiff]] in the Taff Valley, [[Glamorganshire]], [[Wales]], and set about building the kilns and ancillary equipment in its grounds, necessary to transform the building into a small porcelain pottery.
[[File:Nantgarw bottle oven.JPG|350px|thumb|One of the kilns at the Nantgarw Pottery undergoing restoration in September 2006]]

Billingsley had been instrumental in the development of the [[porcelain]] recipe for ''Flight, Barr &amp; Barr'' at [[Royal Worcester]], he and Walker, had signed an agreement not to disclose their new porcelain recipe to a third party, but there was no clause preventing them from using that recipe themselves. They had left [[Worcester]] in secret and started the venture at [[Nantgarw]] with only £250 to invest in the project between them. By January 1814, the [[Quaker]] entrepreneur [[William Weston Young]] had already become the major share-holder in their venture, having invested £630 into the first production period at Nantgarw, as his diaries at the [[Glamorgan Archives|Glamorgan Record Office]] testify, where payments are recorded to a ''Mr "Bealey;"'' an alias Billingsley travelled under since leaving [[Royal Worcester]].

It is assumed Young was acquainted with Billingsley through a mutual friend, and fellow earthenware decorator [[Thomas Pardoe]], whom Billingsley had approached at Swansea's [[Cambrian Pottery]], while seeking employment in 1807. Young's work across Glamorganshire as a surveyor may have put him in the position to advise Billingsley whilst still at [[Royal Worcester]], of the suitability of the site at [[Nantgarw]]. Its proximity to the Glamorganshire Canal enabled heavy shipments of [[china clay]], as well as the pottery's delicate porcelain wares to be smoothly transported to and from Cardiff docks by barges.

With the pottery established, Billingsley sought to produce a ''[[soft paste]]'' porcelain. [[Nantgarw]] porcelain was made to Billingsley's secret formula. Bones, burnt and mixed with clay, were ground by miller David Jones in a mill adjoining the Cross Keys public house, in the village. The water wheel was powered by a leat running from the canal to the [[River Taff]]. The high temperature needed to produce perfect pieces made Billingsley soft paste method difficult to fire. The vast majority of the pieces warped or shattered in the firing process. The resources of the three associates soon ran out and the group approached the British Government's ''Committee of Trade and Plantations'' (The Board of Trade), requesting a grant of £500, referring to the subsidy afforded to the famous [[Sèvres]] Porcelain Factory by the French Government. They were not successful, but one member of the committee, porcelain enthusiast Sir [[Joseph Banks]], suggested his friend and [[Pottery|potter]] [[Lewis Weston Dillwyn]] of the [[Cambrian Pottery]] of [[Swansea]], Glamorganshire, should make an inspection and report on the matter.

Dillwyn made the inspection, observing that 90% of the porcelain was ruined in the firing, but was so impressed with the quality of the surviving pieces that he invited Billingsley and Walker to use his facilities at the Cambrian Pottery to improve their recipe and process. An annexe was built for porcelain production at the Cambrian Pottery, where Walker and Billingsley were based from late 1814. The recipe was modified and improved, but was still wasteful enough for Dillwyn to abandon the project in 1817, when the pair returned to Nantgarw. Royal Worcester's attempts to sue Dillwyn, Billingsley &amp; Walker for breach of contract was a further reason for Dillwyn to cease porcelain production at the Cambrian Pottery. The contract signed at [[Royal Worcester]] prevented the recipe being disclosed to a third party, which superficially, ''Flight, Barr &amp; Barr'' could not prove. However, when Dilwyn's notebooks were interred at the [[V&amp;A Museum]], [[South Kensington]], [[London]] in 1920; Bilingsley's recipe was found, but had never used in Billingsley's absence.
[[File:Nantgarrow jigger0010.JPG|thumb| A jigger-and-jolley machine demonstrated by the curator of the Nantgarw pottery museum]]

In the second phase of production at Nantgarw, Young invested a further £1,100 in the pottery as well as mustering a further £1,000 from "ten gentlemen of the county". Billingsley and Walker continued to fire their porcelain, which by this stage was of the finest quality Billingsley had ever attained but still at a loss until one day in April 1820, while Young was away in [[Bristol]], the pair absconded to [[Coalport]] leaving behind them the lease to the pottery and several thousand pieces of undecorated porcelain in various stages of production ("in the biscuit and the white").

Young put the Nantgarw Pottery and its contents up for sale via public [[auction]] in October 1820, enabling him to buy out his minor partners, become sole proprietor and manage the completion and sale of the stock; effectively salvaging the business. He invited his friend and former co-working artist from the Cambrian Pottery, Thomas Pardoe, to aid him with the completion and decoration of the salvaged porcelain. Young and Pardoe experimented to perfect a glaze for the biscuit ware, but were unable to add to Billingsley's stockpile of porcelain, having no access to his recipe. The final sales of the finished [[porcelain]] (sold between 1821 and 1822), paid Pardoe and his staff's salaries in arrears, but failed to recoup Young's total losses, leaving Young narrowly avoiding [[bankruptcy]]. Besides the porcelain decorated by Young, but predominantly by Pardoe at Nantgarw, many pieces were sold ''in the white'' to be decorated in London. These wares are known to have been decorated by [[Thomas Martin Randall]] (working for [[John Mortlock]] at the time),  [[John Latham (artist)|John Latham]], [[William Peg]] and probably [[Matthew Colclough]].

Some Nantgarw porcelain is identified with the mark "NANTGARW" impressed, often with the initials C.W. ''(for China Works)'' underneath. The word "NANTGARW" in red script is also seen on some of the finer specimens.

In 1833 William Henry Pardoe, son of Thomas Pardoe, took over the vacant Nantgarw Pottery and began manufacturing stoneware bottles and brown glazed earthenware known as [[Rockingham_Pottery#Other_Rockingham|Rockingham ware]]. He also began manufacturing clay tobacco pipes, many of which were exported to Ireland. The business continued under Pardoe's descendants, and at its peak produced around 10,000 pipes a week, until its closure in 1920, when cigarettes replaced such clay pipes.

In 1989 the semi-derelict site was bought by [[Taff-Ely]] County Borough Council, who still today own the site. After the start of [[archaeological]] excavation and restoration of its kilns and buildings, the site opened it to the public two years later as the '''Nantgarw China Works and Museum'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webapps.rhondda-cynon-taf.gov.uk/heritagetrail/taff/nantgarw/nantgarw.htm|title=Nantgarw|publisher=Rhondda Cynon Taff|accessdate=2010-12-01|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717013732/http://webapps.rhondda-cynon-taf.gov.uk/heritagetrail/taff/nantgarw/nantgarw.htm|archivedate=2011-07-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/southeastwales/hi/people_and_places/history/newsid_9156000/9156577.stm|title=BBC - Nantgarw pottery museum reopens to the public|work=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Closed at the end of 2008 due to budget cuts at [[Rhondda Cynon Taff]] council, the Nantgarw Chinaworks Museum was reopened during the week in November 2010 by two artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/southeastwales/hi/people_and_places/history/newsid_9156000/9156577.stm|title=Nantgarw pottery museum reopens to the public|publisher=BBC Wales|date=4 November 2010|accessdate=2010-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum is currently (February 2016) used for artists' studios, exhibitions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nantgarwchinaworksmuseum.co.uk/?page_id=545|title=Gareth Nash, Artist in Residence|work=nantgarwchinaworksmuseum.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; art classes and special events,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nantgarwchinaworksmuseum.co.uk/?page_id=620|title=Art Classes/Dosbarthiadau Celf|work=nantgarwchinaworksmuseum.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the restoration of the [[kiln]]s is being completed by the [[Cadw|Welsh government]].

The '''neck''', '''nicor''', '''nixie''' or '''nokken''' ({{lang-de|[[wikt:Nixe|Nixe]]}}; {{lang-nl|[[wikt:nikker|nikker]]}}, {{lang|nl|[[wikt:nekker|nekker]]}}; [[Danish language|Danish]]: ''nøkke;'' {{lang-no|[[wikt:nøkk|nøkk]]}}; {{lang-sv|[[wikt:näck|näck]]}}; {{lang-fi|[[wikt:näkki|näkki]]}}; {{lang-et|[[wikt:näkk|näkk]]}}) are [[shapeshifting]] water spirits in [[Germanic mythology]] and [[Germanic folklore|folklore]] who usually appeared in forms of other creatures.

Under a [[#Names|variety of names]], they were common to the stories of all [[Germanic peoples]],&lt;ref name="nordisknäck"&gt;The article ''Näcken'', [http://runeberg.org/nfbt/0177.html tome 20, p. 317], in {{lang|no|[[Nordisk familjebok]]}} (1914)&lt;/ref&gt; although they are perhaps best known from [[Scandinavian folklore]]. The related English ''[[knucker]]'' was generally depicted as a [[European dragon|wyrm]] or [[European dragon|dragon]], although more recent versions depict the spirits in other forms. Their sex, bynames, and various transformations vary geographically. The German '''{{lang|de|Nix}}''' and his Scandinavian counterparts were males. The German {{lang|de|Nixe}} was a female river [[mermaid]].&lt;ref name="nordisknäck"/&gt;

==England==
English folklore contains many creatures with similar characteristics to the ''Nix'' or {{lang|sv|Näck}}. These include [[Jenny Greenteeth]], the [[Shellycoat]], the river-hag [[Peg Powler]], the {{lang|sv|Bäckahäst}}-like [[Brag (folklore)|Brag]], and the [[Grindylow]].

At [[Lyminster]] near Arundel in the English county of [[Sussex]], there are today said to dwell "water-wyrms" called [[knucker]]s, in a pool called the ''Knucker-hole''. The great Victorian authority Skeat had plausibly suggested the pool's name of ''knucker'' (a name attested from 1835, Horsfield)&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Walker Horsfield, ''The History, Antiquities, and Topography of the County of Sussex'', Volume 2, 1835.&lt;/ref&gt; was likely derived from the [[Old English]] {{lang|ang|nicor}}, a creature-name found in ''Beowulf''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.prestel.co.uk/aspen/sussex/dragon.html Dragons &amp; Serpents In Sussex] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080405144710/http://www2.prestel.co.uk/aspen/sussex/dragon.html |date=5 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. Yet the waters at the pool were badly muddied by a local antiquarian named Samuel Evershed, who from 1866 tried assiduously to connect the pool with dragons and thus with the tale of [[St. George and the Dragon]]. Any authentic water-sprite folklore the site may originally have had was thus trampled down by Evershed's enthusiastic inculcation of the local people in ideas about water-dragons.

===Näck, Nøkk===
[[File:Näckens polska.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''Näckens polska'' by [[Bror Hjorth]]]]
The Scandinavian ''näcken'', ''näkki'', ''nøkk'' were male water spirits who played enchanted songs on the violin, luring women and children to [[drown]] in lakes or streams.  However, not all of these spirits were necessarily malevolent; many stories indicate at the very least that nøkker were entirely harmless to their audience and attracted not only women and children, but men as well with their sweet songs.  Stories also exist wherein the Fossegrim agreed to live with a human who had fallen in love with him, but many of these stories ended with the nøkk returning to his home, usually a nearby waterfall or brook. (Compare the legend of [[Llyn y Fan Fach]] in Wales.) The nøkker were said to grow despondent unless they had free, regular contact with a water source.

The Norwegian [[Fossegrim]] or ''Grim'', Swedish ''strömkarl'',&lt;ref&gt;Or strömkarl (singular), per Grimm 1835:17:11.&lt;/ref&gt; is a related figure who, if properly approached, will teach a musician to play so adeptly "that the trees dance and waterfalls stop at his music".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/celt/tfm/tfm056.htm |title=The Fairy Mythology: Scandinavia : The Power of the Harp |publisher=Sacred-texts.com |accessdate=26 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is difficult to describe the appearance of the nix, as one of his central attributes was thought to be [[shapeshifting]]. Perhaps he did not have any true shape. He could show himself as a man playing the violin in brooks and waterfalls (though often imagined as fair and naked today, in folklore he was more frequently described as wearing more or less elegant clothing) but also could appear to be treasure or various floating objects, or as an animal—most commonly in the form of a "brook horse" (see below). The modern Scandinavian names are derived from [[Old Norse]] ''nykr'', meaning "river horse". Thus, it is likely that the figure of the brook horse preceded the personification of the nix as the "man in the rapids".  Fossegrim and derivatives were almost always portrayed as especially beautiful young men, whose clothing (or lack thereof) varied widely from story to story.

The enthralling music of the nøkk was most dangerous to women and children, especially pregnant women and [[baptism|unbaptised]] children.  He was thought to be most active during [[Midsummer's Night]], on Christmas Eve, and on Thursdays.  However, these superstitions do not necessarily relate to all the versions listed here. Many,  if not all of them, developed after the Christianizing of the northern countries, as was the case of similar stories of faeries and other entities in other areas.

[[File:Ernst Josephson-Näcken.jpg|thumb|upright|''Näcken'' ("The Water Sprite") by [[Ernst Josephson]], 1884]]

When malicious nøkker attempted to carry off people, they could be defeated by calling their name; this was believed to cause their death.&lt;ref&gt;Francis James Child, ''The English and Scottish Popular Ballads'', v 1, p 95-6, Dover Publications, New York 1965.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another belief was that if a person bought the nøkk a treat of three drops of blood, a black animal, some "brännvin" (Scandinavian [[vodka]]) or [[snus]] (wet snuff) dropped into the water, he would teach his enchanting form of music.

The nøkk was also an omen for drowning accidents. He would scream at a particular spot in a lake or river, in a way reminiscent of the [[loon]], and on that spot, a fatality would later take place. He was also said to cause drownings, but swimmers could protect themselves against such a fate by throwing a bit of steel into the water.&lt;ref name="phantoms" /&gt;

In the later Romantic folklore and folklore-inspired stories of the 19th century, the nøkk sings about his loneliness and his longing for salvation, which he purportedly never shall receive, as he is not "a child of God". In a poem by Swedish poet [[Erik Johan Stagnelius|E. J. Stagnelius]], a little boy pities the fate of the nøkk, and so saves his own life. In the poem, arguably Stagnelius' most famous, the boy says that the Näck (nøkk) will never be a "child of God" which brings "tears to his face" as he "never plays again in the silvery brook". 

On a similar theme, a 19th-century text called "Brother Fabian's Manuscript" by [[Sebastian Evans]] has this verse:

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;Where by the marishes boometh the [[bittern]],
Neckar the soulless one sits with his ghittern.
Sits inconsolable, friendless and foeless.
Waiting his destiny, - Neckar the soulless.&lt;ref name="phantoms"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/stream/cu31924079619411/cu31924079619411_djvu.txt |title=Phantoms of the Deep, or : Legends and Superstitions of the Sea and of Sailors |accessdate=3 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}

(The source has "bloometh" for "boometh", but this is clearly an error; a bittern is not a plant, but a bird, and it is known for its booming call. A "ghittern" is a guitar. The spelling "Nickar" ''vice'' "Neckar" is sometimes used.)

In Scandinavia, [[Nymphaea alba|water lilies]] are called "nix roses" (''näckrosor/nøkkeroser''). A tale from the forest of [[Tiveden]] relates that a father promised his daughter to a nøkken who offered him great hauls of fish in a time of need; she refused and stabbed herself to death, staining the water lilies red from that time on:
{{quote|At the lake of Fagertärn, there was once a poor fisherman who had a beautiful daughter. The small lake gave little fish and the fisherman had difficulties providing for his little family. One day, as the fisherman was fishing in his little [[Dugout (boat)|dugout]] of oak, he met the Nøkken, who offered him great catches of fish on the condition that the fisherman gave him his beautiful daughter the day she was eighteen years old. The desperate fisherman agreed and promised the Nøkken his daughter. The day the girl was eighteen she went down to the shore to meet the Nøkken. The Nøkken gladly asked her to walk down to his watery abode, but the girl took forth a knife and said that he would never have her alive, then stuck the knife into her heart and fell down into the lake, dead. Then, her blood coloured the water lilies red, and from that day the water lilies of some of the lake's forests are red (Karlsson 1970:86).}}

===Bäckahäst, bækhest===
[[File:Theodor Kittelsen - Nøkken som hvit hest.jpg|thumb|The Neck as a brook horse by Theodor Kittelsen, a depiction of the Neck as a white horse]]
[[File:Gutt på hvit hest.jpg|thumb|''Gutt på hvit hest'' (Boy on white horse) by the same Kittelsen]]
[[File:Arthur Rackam Die Rheintöchter.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Rhinemaidens]] by [[Arthur Rackham]]]]

The '''bäckahäst''' or '''bækhest''' (translated as ''the brook horse'') is a [[mythology|mythological]] horse in [[Scandinavian folklore]]. It has a close parallel in the Scottish [[kelpie]], and the Welsh [[Ceffyl Dŵr]].

It was often described as a majestic white horse that would appear near rivers, particularly during foggy weather.  Anyone who climbed onto its back would not be able to get off again.  The horse would then jump into the river, drowning the rider. The brook horse could also be harnessed and made to plough, either because it was trying to trick a person or because the person had tricked the horse into it. The following tale is a good illustration of the brook horse:
{{quote|A long time ago, there was a girl who was not only pretty but also big and strong. She worked as a maid on a farm by Lake Hjärtasjön in southern [[Nerike]]. She was ploughing with the farm's horse on one of the fields by the lake. It was springtime and beautiful weather. The birds chirped and the [[white wagtail|wagtail]]s flitted in the tracks of the girl and the horse in order to pick worms. All of a sudden, a horse appeared out of the lake. It was big and beautiful, bright in colour and with large spots on the sides. The horse had a beautiful mane which fluttered in the wind and a tail that trailed on the ground. The horse pranced for the girl to show her how beautiful he was. The girl, however, knew that it was the brook horse and ignored it. Then the brook horse came closer and closer and finally he was so close that he could bite the farm horse in the mane. The girl hit the brook horse with the bridle and cried: "Disappear you scoundrel, or you'll have to plough so you'll never forget it." As soon as she had said this, the brook horse had changed places with the farm horse, and the brook horse started ploughing the field with such speed that soil and stones whirled in its wake, and the girl hung like a mitten from the plough. Faster than the cock crows seven times, the ploughing was finished and the brook horse headed for the lake, dragging both the plough and the girl. But the girl had a piece of [[Iron in mythology|steel]] in her pocket, and she made the [[sign of the cross]].  Immediately she fell down on the ground, and she saw the brook horse disappear into the lake with the plough. She heard a frustrated neighing when the brook horse understood that his trick had failed. Until this day, a deep track can be seen in the field. (Hellström 1985:16)}}

==Germany==
The German ''Nix'' and ''Nixe'' (and ''Nixie'') are types of river [[merman]] and [[mermaid]] who may lure men to drown, like the Scandinavian type, akin to the Celtic [[Melusine]] and similar to the Greek [[Siren (mythology)|Siren]]. The German epic ''[[Nibelungenlied]]'' mentions the Nix in connection with the [[Danube]], as early as 1180 to 1210.

Nixes in folklore became [[Sprite (creature)|water sprites]]&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Grimm 1835:17:11.&lt;/ref&gt; who try to lure people into the water. The males can assume many different shapes, including that of a human, fish, and snake. The females bear the tail of a fish. When they are in human forms, they can be recognised by the wet hem of their clothes. The Nixes are portrayed as malicious in some stories but harmless and friendly in others.

By the 19th century [[Jacob Grimm]] mentions the Nixie to be among the "[[Sprite (creature)|water-sprites]]" who love music, song and dancing, and says "Like the sirens, the Nixie by her song draws listening youth to herself, and then into the deep."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; According to Grimm, they can appear human but have the barest hint of animal features: the nix had "a slit ear", and the Nixie "a wet skirt". Grimm thinks these could symbolise they are "higher beings" who could [[Shapeshifting|shapeshift]] to animal form.&lt;ref&gt;Grimm 1835:33:2.&lt;/ref&gt;

One famous Nixe of recent [[German folklore]], deriving from 19th-century literature, was [[Lorelei]]; according to the legend, she sat on the rock at the [[Rhine]] which now bears her name, and lured fishermen and boatmen to the dangers of the reefs with the sound of her voice. In Switzerland there is a legend (myth) of a sea-maid or Nixe that lived in [[Lake Zug]] (the lake is in the Canton of Zug).

''[[The Yellow Fairy Book]]'' by [[Andrew Lang]] includes a story called "[[The Nixie of the Mill-Pond]]" in which a malevolent spirit that lives in a mill pond strikes a deal with the miller that she will restore his wealth in exchange for his son. This story is taken from the Tales of Grimm.

The legend of [[Heer Halewijn]], a dangerous lord who lures women to their deaths with a magic song, may have originated with the Nix.

{{See also|Lorelei}}
{{See also|Wagner's Rhinemaidens}}
Alternate names (kennings) for the female German Nixe are Rhine maidens ({{lang-de|link=no|Rheintöchter}}) and [[Lorelei]].

In a fictional depiction, the '''Rhine maidens''' are among the [[protagonist]]s in the four-part Opera ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]'' by the composer [[Richard Wagner]], based loosely on the nix of the ''Nibelungenlied''.

The Rhine maidens [[Wellgunde]], [[Woglinde]], and [[Floßhilde]] ([[Flosshilde]]) belong to a group of characters living in a part of nature free from human influence.  [[Jörð|Erda]] and the [[Norns]] are also considered a part of this 'hidden' world.

They are first seen in the first work of the Nibelungen cycle, ''[[Das Rheingold]]'', as guardians of the ''Rheingold'', a treasure of gold hidden in the [[Rhine|Rhein]] river.  The dwarf [[Alberich]], a [[Nibelung]], is eager to win their favour, but they somewhat cruelly dismiss his flattery.  They tell him that only one who is unable to love can win the ''Rheingold''.  Thus, Alberich curses love and steals the ''Rheingold''.  From the stolen gold he forges a [[Ring (jewellery)|ring]] of power. Further on in the cycle, the Rhine maidens are seen trying to regain the ring and transform it back into the harmless ''Rheingold''. But no one will return the ring to them; not even the supreme god [[Odin|Wotan]], who uses the ring to pay the giants Fasolt and Fafner for building [[Valhalla]], nor the hero [[Sigurd|Siegfried]], when the maidens appear to him in the third act of ''[[Götterdämmerung]]''. Eventually [[Brynhildr|Brünnhilde]] returns it to them at the end of the cycle, when the fires of her funeral pyre cleanse the ring of its curse.

Descendants of German immigrants to Pennsylvania sometimes refer to a mischievous child as being "nixie".

The '''Nigerian Institute of Architects''' ('''NIA''') is a [[professional body]] for [[architects]] primarily in [[Nigeria]].

==History==
The idea for the formation of an independent professional architect's organization in Nigeria was first conceived and motivated by three architects. In 1958, an 8 member study group was formed to carry out detailed planning for the establishment of the Institute which ultimately culminated in inauguration of the [[Institute]]. The Nigerian Institute of Architects (NIA) was founded on the 1st of April 1960.&lt;ref name="NIA"/&gt;

==Structure==
The NIA is a member organisation of professional Architects, with the objective of promoting the practice of the profession of Architecture in [[Nigeria]]. It has approximately 6000 full members, associates, graduates and student members in 32 State Chapters.&lt;ref name="NIA"&gt;[http://www.nigerianinstituteofarchitects.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=45&amp;Itemid=82] Accessed 2012 - 01 -25&lt;/ref&gt; It is a member of the [[International Union of Architects]] and a founding member of both the Commonwealth Association of Architects and the Africa Union of Architects.&lt;ref name="NIA" /&gt;  It is a non-governmental organization, but performs some statutory functions on behalf of the Architects Registration Council of Nigeria, and cooperates with governmental and non-governmental agencies and institutions.
The NIA conducts examinations with the Architects Registration Council of Nigeria, and may be called to arbitrate in cases of dispute or liability.

==Background==
The NIA was conceived by three Nigerian architects and founded on 1 April 1960, as an association of independent professional architects with the aims and objectives of fostering friendship amongst members, cater for their welfare and establish mutual support and cooperation amongst them. The NIA had 13 members initially, which had now grown to about 6000 in 5 classes of membership including Fellows, Full members, Associates, Graduates and Students members, in 31 Chapters.&lt;ref&gt;[https://nia.ng/about-us/ About Us], Nigerian Institute of Architects. Retrieved 30 September 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nigerian Institute of Architects is a member of the [[International Union of Architects]] (UIA), a founding member of both the [[Commonwealth Association of Architects]] (CAA) and the [[Africa Union of Architects]] (AUA).

The '''Nursing Madonna''', '''''Virgo Lactans''''', or '''Madonna Lactans''', is an [[iconography]] of the [[Madonna and Child]] in which the [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Virgin Mary]] is shown [[breastfeeding]] the infant [[Jesus]].

The depiction is mentioned by Pope [[Gregory the Great]], and a mosaic depiction probably of the 12th century is on the facade of [[Santa Maria in Trastevere]] in Rome, though few other examples survive from before the late Middle Ages.  It continued to be found in Orthodox icons (as ''Galaktotrophousa'' in Greek, ''Mlekopitatelnitsa'' in Russian), especially in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tradigo|first=Alfredo|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uODOkMgUZKYC&amp;pg=PA183|title=Icons And Saints of the Eastern Orthodox Church, A Guide to Imagery|page=183|year=2006|publisher=Getty|isbn=9780892368457}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Usage of the depiction seems to have revived with the [[Cistercian Order]] in the 12th century, as part of the general upsurge in [[Mariology|Marian theology]] and devotion.  Milk was seen as "processed blood", and the milk of the Virgin to some extent paralleled the role of the [[Blood of Christ]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Eucharist in Romanesque France: Iconography And Theology|last=Saxon|first=Elizabeth|pages=205-207|year=2006|publisher=Boydell|isbn=9781843832560|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5DwQB4_6tG0C&amp;pg=PA206}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Middle Ages, the middle and upper classes usually contracted breastfeeding out to [[wetnurse]]s, and the depiction of the Nursing Madonna was linked with the [[Madonna of Humility]], a depiction that showed the Virgin in more ordinary clothes than the royal robes shown, for instance, in images of the [[Coronation of the Virgin]], and often seated on the ground.  The appearance of a large number of such depictions in [[Tuscany]] in the early 14th century was something of a visual revolution for the theology of the time, compared to the [[Queen of Heaven]] depictions; they were also popular in [[Iberia]]. After the [[Council of Trent]] in the mid-16th century, clerical writers discouraged nudity in religious subjects, and the use of the Madonna Lactans iconography began to fade away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=From the Pews in the Back|first1=Mary Ann|last1=Hinsdale|first2=Kate|last2=Dugan|first3=Jennifer|last3=Owens|year=2009|isbn=0-8146-3258-0|page=102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another type of depiction, also deprecated after Trent, showed Mary baring her breast in a traditional gesture of female supplication to Christ when asking for mercy for sinners in [[Deesis]] or [[Last Judgement]] scenes. A good example is the fresco at S. Agostino in [[San Gimignano]], by [[Benozzo Gozzoli]], painted to celebrate the end of the plague. {{citation needed|date = October 2013}}

The nursing Virgin survived into the Baroque some depictions of the [[Holy Family]], by [[El Greco]] for example,&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:El Greco - Holy Family with St Anne - WGA10565.jpg|El Greco in Budapest]]&lt;/ref&gt; and narrative scenes such as the ''[[Rest on the Flight into Egypt]]'', for example by [[Orazio Gentileschi]] (versions in Birmingham and Vienna).

==Lactatio Bernardi==
[[File:BernhardClairvaux Lactatio SourceUnknown.jpg|thumbnail|right|Bernard receiving milk from the breast of the Virgin Mary. The scene is a legend which allegedly took place at [[Speyer Cathedral]] in 1146.]]
A variant, known as the '''Lactation of St Bernard''' ('''''Lactatio Bernardi''''' in Latin, or simply '''Lactatio''') is based on a miracle or vision concerning St [[Bernard of Clairvaux]] where the Virgin sprinkled milk on his lips (in some versions he is awake, praying before an image of the Madonna, in others asleep).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=La lactation de saint Bernard: Legende et iconographie|last1=Dewez|first1=Léon|last2=van Iterson|first2=Albert|journal=Citeaux in de Nederlanden|volume=7|year=1956|pages=165–89}}&lt;/ref&gt; In art he usually kneels before a Madonna Lactans, and as Jesus takes a break from feeding, the Virgin squeezes her breast and he is hit with a squirt of milk, often shown travelling an impressive distance. The milk was variously said to have given him wisdom, shown that the Virgin was his mother (and that of mankind generally), or cured an eye infection. In this form the Nursing Madonna survived into [[Baroque art]], and sometimes the [[Rococo]], as in the high altar at [[Kloster Aldersbach]].&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Aldersbach Pfarrkirche - Hochaltar 2 Altarbild.jpg]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Puritan New England Funerary Art''' reached its peak during the 16th and 17th centuries after the arrival of English Puritans in the Colonies. These iconic images such as death’s head and the willow and the urn illustrate the simplistic artistry that the period strived towards. Reasoning for this is because after the Reformation, the English Puritans wished  for greater purity and distance from the Catholic Church.

==Cultural background==

The primary objective was to extol the virtues of paradise and the transformation of the flesh to spirit.  There was a distinct shift that emphasized the inappropriateness of scriptural art.  The narrative style of England had changed to one of emblems. Puritans were adamantly against attributing human form to spiritual beings such as God, angels, or spirits, so iconography such as death was preferable and did not violate the second commandment.

Our modern view of death and burial recoil from the Puritan’s use of coffins, skulls, shovels, barred teeth, and empty eyes that were typically seen on gravestones. To the Puritans, these were traditional symbols brought from England. Death was to be depicted as the transformation from the flesh to the spiritual realm without the gritty naturalistic detail.
Early New England stones have emblems derived from English morality and the baroque style. Later gravestones are simpler and depict the stages between death and new life, where the soul moves from the body.

==Iconic Images==

===Winged Death Head===
Though seemingly frightening, the symbol of death in Puritan New England was much closer to depicting the symbolic voyage from life to death. Death is first a winged head, but with careful analysis of gravestones, there is a distinct transformation to the glorification of the soul. Another common depiction of death is a full skeletal body, typically clad with a scythe or the moon and sun in his hands.

This picture of death was meant to instill the terrors of death. In the corners of a typical stone with this depiction are angels at the top and bats of the underworld at the bottom.  The scythe is most often mid swing among flowers symbolizes the flowering of a man’s life cut off by death and time.

A winged death head can be seen to the right and symbolizes the triumph of death.  A typical image of death has serrated teeth, “hole eyes,” a thin elongated jaw, and a slash for a mouth. This image has been commonly used since Elizabethan times.

Within fifty years the depiction of death changes. The death’s head has become crowned, the lower jaw eliminated, and serrations of teeth appear on the upper row, a characteristic carving of the mid-18th century.  Particularly, the eyes become more animated—almond shaped and with pupils—seeming more soul-like than deathlike. Extra imagery such as foliage, grapes and vines, and hearts suggest new life through sacraments and Resurrection.
This transition cannot be clearly, or easily, seen through the gravestones. The changes are very minute and gradual leaving some stones at a disturbing image in between an empty skull and a lively soul.

===Willow and Urn===
Typically seen as a European symbol, the tree of life has been significant since Sumerian times. The Puritans took this symbol and created their own versions. The tree can be interpreted as life in celestial paradise or as the human life; however, during the 18th century the two were used interchangeably by the New Englanders. In the 19th century, the weeping willow made a distinctive entrance.

The willow suggests a Greek revival in architecture and a shift in emphasis away from the fate of the soul of the deceased, but instead the mourning of those left behind. The urn is a container to hold ashes used by Imperial Roman. Usage of these icons was part of a larger style toward sentimentality in mourning art. This redirected the emotional output of those left behind. Instead of fearing their loved ones damnation, this depiction is much more peaceful. For example, "Here lies the body of" is replaced by "In memory of." There was also a transition from slate to marble.
The evolution of style of death's head, and urn and willow design is to be found in almost every cemetery in New England. The emblems of death shifted as the societal interpretation of life and hereafter changed from terror to peace.

'''Rainbow cup''' ([[German language|German]]: ''Regenbogenschüsselchen'', [[Czech language|Czech]]: ''duhovka'' from ''duha'' - rainbow) is a term for Celtic gold coins found in areas once dominated by the [[La Tène culture]]. According to folk belief, Rainbow cups could be found where a rainbow touched the earth and could often be found in ploughed fields after heavy rainfall. They were thought to bring luck and had many different effects ascribed to them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/brill-s-new-pauly/rainbow-cup-e1019850 Brill’s New Pauly - Rainbow cup]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sequence==
Baldev Mehra (Vishwa Mohan Badola) is an elderly [[Hindu]] man in [[Delhi]], [[India]], and Yusuf ([[M. S. Sathyu|Mysore Shrinivas Sathyu]]) is an elderly [[Muslim]] man in [[Lahore]], [[Pakistan]]. One day Baldev shows his granddaughter Suman (Auritra Ghosh) an old, dated photograph of two children. He tells her that it is himself and his best friend Yusuf when they lived in Lahore prior to the [[Partition of India]] in 1947. In front of his house there was a park with a gate made in the stone age and each evening he and Yusuf would fly kites there and "steal"  [[Jhajariya]]s from Yusuf's [[South Asian sweets|family sweet shop]]. When Partition came, however, [[Partition of India#Independence.2C population transfer.2C and violence|Baldev and his family had to leave for India overnight]]. Many decades later, Baldev still thinks of Yusuf and misses him.

Using details of her grandfather's story, Sumon is able to locate Yusuf's sweet shop in Lahore via her laptop and Google. She connects with his grandson Ali (Syed Shabahat Ali) who helps her to plan a surprise visit from Yusuf on Baldev's birthday.

In case you haven't, it's a Google advertisement, about three and a half minutes, well worth your time.

[[Image:Djelfa, 1.jpg|thumb|[[Neolithic]] art in Djelfa.]]
The rock art of the [[Djelfa]] region in the [[Ouled Naïl Range]] ([[Algeria]]) consists of prehistoric cave paintings and petroglyphs dating from the [[Neolithic]] age which have been recognized since 1914. Following the [[Saharan rock art|Saharan]] [[Atlas Mountains]] they follow on from those, to the west, of [[Rock art of south Oran (Algeria)|south Oran]] (the regions of [[Rock art of Figuig|Figuig]], [[Ain Sefra]], [[El Bayadh]], [[Mechta-Afalou|Afalou]] and Tiaret), to which they are related. Comparable [[rock art|engravings]] have also been described further to the east, in the [[Constantine, Algeria|Constantine (Algeria)]] region.

== Localities and descriptions ==
Some of the engravings of the Djelfa region seem to have been known since the 1850s (El Idrissia). Among the best-known, those of [[Zaccar]] were discovered in 1907, and Flamand described in 1914 the station of Daïet es Stel. In the mid-1960s the active Djelfa Council of Initiatives undertook to record engravings and paintings, and Father F. de Villaret, who accompanied the visitors, thus made known works from some twenty new stations, notably those of Oued el Hesbaïa and [[Aïn Naga]]. In total more than 1,162 engravings have been discovered in the region.

[[Henri Lhote]] referred to these engravings in his major work, ''Les Gravures rupestres du Sud-oranais'', which he published in 1970 in the series of the ''Mémoires du Centre de recherches anthropologiques préhistoriques et ethnographiques'' (CRAPE).&lt;ref&gt;Edited at Algiers by Mouloud Mammeri (Arts et Métiers graphiques, Paris, 210 pages and photographic reproductions).&lt;/ref&gt; For him they could not "be separated archaeologically from those of south Oran, because they show with some variations the same style, the same technical formulae, the same patinations and the same fauna"(p.&amp;nbsp;194). It may therefore be possible to analyse them making use of the hypotheses and the classification which he developed. The engravings of the Djelfa region appeared to him like "foreign works, which are a copying (always of inferior quality) from those of south [[Oran]]", (p.&amp;nbsp;193), a region which for the author was "the principal centre of the rock art of the pre-Saharan regions." Some belong to the earliest stage of the large-scale Hartebeest school, like "The Apollo of Ouled Naïl", others are more recent or indeed (stylistically) more decadent.

Regretting "the misreading of the importance of the south Algerian rock art" in the work of Lhote, P. Huard and L. Allard published in 1976 in ''Lybica'' (CRAPE, Algiers) an important study on ''Les figurations rupestres de la région de Djelfa, Sud Algérois.'' The authors therein recorded forty-three numbered sites or stations which are with some exceptions located near the interior or at the edges of a triangle formed on the north by the town of Djelfa, on the south-west by the village of [[Sidi Makhlouf]] and on the south-east by the town of [[Messaad]].

[[Image:Gravures préhistoriques, Djelfa, carte.jpg|550px|thumb|left]]

Around the road from Djelfa to Laghouat (just south of Sidi Makhlouf) twenty-three stations are shown: no 28 (Zaccar), 38 (Ishak), 39 (Oued el Youhi), 40 (Guelt el Bidha), 30 (Hadjra Sidi Boubakeur), 31 (Sreissir), 32 (Ben Hallouane), 27 (El Gour), 26 (Ben Hadid), 25 (Kheneg Hilal), 24 (Theniet bou Mediouna II), 23 (Theniet bou Mediouna I), 22 (Theniet el Mzab), 21 (Daïet Geklil), 16 (Oued Mergueb), 20 (Djebel Doum), 19 (Safiet el Baroud), 18 (Morhoma), 33 (Oued Remeila), 34 (Rocher des Pigeons "Pigeon Rock"), 41 (Oued Cheguieg), 17 (Oued el Hesbaïa), 42 (Ntsila). Three stations are in addition mentioned to the east of Djelfa: no 1 (Feidjet Elleben), 2 (Sidi Abdallah ben Ahmed), 3 (Argoub Ezzemla). Three other sites are found to the west: n° 37 (Chouchet Esnober), 36 (Koreiker), 35 (El Idrissia).

Around the road from Djelfa to Messaad (by Moudjbara) twelve stations follow roughly from north to south: no 29 (Saouiet), 4 (Aïn Mouilha), 5 (Daïet es Stel), 6 (Hadjra Mokhotma north), 7 (Hadjara Mokhotma south), 10 (Safiet Bou Khenan), 9 (Station de l'Autruche "Ostrich"), 8 (Daïet el Hamra), 11 (Bou Sekkin), 12 (Aïn Naga), 13(Atef el Ghorab), 14 (Oued Tamdit). To the east of Messad two final stations are named: no 43 (Oued el Bouir) and 15 (Amoura).

The engravings are located near dwelling sites, shown by the presence of worked flints and debitage, "stratified in various levels or at the foot of cliffs of reddish sandstone, the [[patina]] of which can become nearly black, which run along the djebels or stand at the edges of the oueds." They are "by-and-large arranged in little separate groups", the monumental friezes or very richly decorated murals like those of Oued el Hesbaïa or [[Aïn Naga]] being "exceptions".

Recognizing that the engravings of the Djelfa region are "similar to those of south Oran by subject and technique", P. Huard and L. Allard judge however that they have a rich cultural content of their own which, notably, show the ancient buffalo as bearers of attributes of the heads, and the fact that almost all the ovines (sheep) are endowed with classic spheroids or horns enclosed in a ring, which are a later stylization of the motif"(p.&amp;nbsp;67). According to these authors "The introduction in the most ancient stage of the south-Oranian of rams with [[spheroid]]s can hardly tally with the south-Algerian material, where the most accomplished depictions are often associated with men in developed costume, whereas others, associated with cattle, are clearly of a pastoral epoch" (p.&amp;nbsp;71).

What is more "The 'bovidian' stage, which would come only in the fourth place in the sequence of the south-Oranian, where it shows a 'decadent' character, is much more developed in the south [[Algeria]]n." Deducing that these evidences "show that in the two sectors, its origin must certainly be more ancient", Huard and Allard prefer to speak "of a pastoral stage of long duration, with cows and sheep"(p.&amp;nbsp;71).

== The "Hunters" Stage ==

[[Image:Djelfa, 2.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Oued el Hesbaïa.]]

In the stage of Hunters the authors gather the depictions of the large wild fauna: ancient [[African Buffalo|buffalo]] (or Hartebeest), elephants, rhinoceros, lions, ostriches and human figures.

Of the seventeen buffalo recorded in the region, twelve belong to the large, naturalistic art and are similar to those of the south-Oranian. They are found at Oued el Hesbaïa (frieze of three buffalo, including one of more than two meters), Aïn Naga (two buffalo in procession), at Station de l'Autruche (buffalo of 1.50 meters surmounted by a hollowed disc), Djebel Doum (buffalo of 2.35 meters of which the left horn supports a "lengthened semi-circular attribute"), Safiet el Baroud, Hadjra Mokhotma north (buffalo of 2.63 meters, where a human figure seems to touch the horns), Kheneg Hilal (buffalo of 1.20 m.) and Ben Hallouane.

Large, medium or small, the twenty-two elephants seem to belong to various ages. The largest (1 to 2 m), naturalistic in style, are found at Aïn Naga, Theniet bou Mediouna I, Oued Remeilia, Aïn Mouilha, Oued el Hesbaïa (where the "[[elephant]] panel", an accumulation of depictions superimposed through the centuries, shows six), Safiet Bou Khenan, [[Zaccar]], Feidjet Elleben and Bou Sekkin.

Seven rhinoceros, of lesser quality and often decadent in style, are recorded at five stations, at Oued Remeila (the oldest), Feidjet Elleben, Bou Sekkin, Aïn Naga, and Oued el Hesbaïa.

Nine representations of Hartebeest antelopes (Bubalis alcelaphus boselaphus) are in naturalistic style. The most famous is that of Zaccar, devoured by a lion (1.50 m in length). A similar scene is found at Daïet el Hamra. At Hadjra Mokhotma north, the animal is confined within a circular trap. Other antelope have been engraved at Safiet el Baroud, Theniet el Mzab and Feidjet Elleben. Otherwise there are numerous antelope-type creatures, often much stylized and in small-scale, like those of Sidi Abdallah ben Ahmed and Safiet bou Khenan, related to the style called ''the Tazina School'', found in south-[[Oran]].

Eighteen in number, the lions represented can be classed into three groups: "naturalistic lions in profile, three times shown in hunting scenes" (Oued el Hesbaïa, Zaccar, Daïet el Hamra, Hadjara Mokhotma north, Oued Remeilia), "fairly large lions with the stylized head facing and the body in profile", "weaker in style and carving method", "late by comparison with the south-Oran prototypes" (Djebel Doum, Kheneg Hilal, Hadjra Mokhotma south), and thirdly the "smaller felines, lightly drawn and generally late", "of mediocre style and carving method"(pp.&amp;nbsp;81–85).

The ostriches, fairly numerous, are (with the exception of the representations at Safiet bou Khenan and at Oued el Hesbaïa) "generally of a poor quality." [[boars]], in a group of three, are on the other hand rare, limited to the stations of El Idrissia (a lost group) and Sreissir.

The human depictions are forty in number notably at Oued el Hesbaïa, El Gour, Theniet bou Mediouna II, Aïn Naga, Daïet es Stel, Oued Remeilia, Safiet bou Khenan, Hadjra Mokhotma south and [[Ben Hadid]]. Authors attribute to them the model of the "twenty-five characteristic traits of physical or psychic valour of the hunter culture" which they have identified "in the [[Nile]] area and in various [[Sahara]]n regions" (p.&amp;nbsp;85).

Thus they explain the images of men under animal skins, the wearing of false tails and phallic protections, masks, the presence of ithyphallic depictions and of men touching animals (buffalo, antelopes and elephants at Hadjra Mokhotma north, Theniet bou Mediouna II and Bou Sekkin). Among the weapons they record bows, long and curved weapons, clubs, a hatchet and a shield. Several traps are depicted as well as the hands. Thus, "all the cultural traits of hunters are attested in the Djelfa region, apart from the lasso and the ''spirale'' (?bolas), which are by compensation strongly represented at [[Tassili]] in the Oued Djerat sector."(p.&amp;nbsp;93).

== Early stages of domestication ==

[[Image:Djelfa, 3.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Aïn Naga.]]

Several antelopes and cattle carry signs of human appropriation, especially collars. But it is above all about thirty representations of rams which belong rather to the world of shepherds than of hunters, stretching "through a long period going all the way forward to an advanced stage of domestication" (p.&amp;nbsp;97). Eight among them are rams with spheroids, of which five are associated with human figures ([[Aïn Naga]], Daïet es Stel, Oued el Hesbaïa, Saouiet).

It is in this group that some of the most famous masterpieces of the region are found, such as the Ram of Aïn Naga, about twice natural size, found by Father F. de Villaret and published by the Djelfa Syndicate of Initiative. The animal, which wears a spheroid framed by feathers, a cheek pendant and a collar with chevrons, is led by a man dressed in a [[loin-cloth]] with buttons, wearing bracelets, whose hair-do falls across the [[nape]] of his neck in three swathes.

Of the other ovines (sc. sheep), sometimes wearing collars, show their horns enclosed in a ring or by discs (only four depictions show only a collar, or appear without attributes). At Hadjra Sidi Boubakeur a group composed of a [[Sheep|ram]], a ewe and a large bull denotes "a well established domestication" (p.&amp;nbsp;106). Other rams can be seen at Khenneg Hilal, Oued el Hesbaïa, Safiet bou Khenan, Theniet el Mzab, Hadjra Mokhotma and [[Aïn Naga]].

The rock art of the Djelfa region shows large naturalistic cattle ([[Zaccar]]) and sub-naturalistic ones (Bou Sekkin), the others dating from the pastoral era. Their horns are similarly closed into a ring and they sometimes wear devices in segments of a circle, or of textile, which are perhaps means of carrying things (Hadjra Sidi Boubakeur, Teniet el Mzab, Hadjra Mohkotma, Ben Hadid, Bou Sekkin, Safiet bou Khenan and Oued Mergueb).

The "pastoral scenes" often associating men and animals are found at Hadjra Sidi Boubakeur, Hadjra Mohkotma sud, Aïn Mouilha (men with "bandes molletières"), Morhoma, Daïet es Stel and Zaccar. Other humanly-signifying depictions, [[ithyphallic]] images and women displaying, are found at Safiet bou Khenan, Theniet bou, Mediouna II, and Daïet el Hamra. [[Image:Djelfa, 1.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Aïn Naga, engraving called "The timid lovers".]]At Theniet el Mzab there is also found the famous engraving of a man with three-segmented hair style and square shirt-front, and at Aïn Naga that of the "timid lovers" in which the man carries an object like a [[haricot]], [[shield]] or [[quiver]] surmounted by [[arrow]]s, (as in south Oran at Khreloua), a hairdo or a headpiece with a tuft of hair falling forwards and with three swathes falling over the neck (a detail which one sees again at Aïn Naga and in south Oran) while the woman shows a carefully maintained hair arrangement, held behind with a clip.

One also finds among the engravings of the Djelfa region hounds and horses of various epochs.

In addition, three sites with [[cave painting]]s are located at Djebel Doum, at the Zaccar south site (several archers, a possibly human figure and tortoises) and at Hadjra Mokhotma south.

In 1968, elements of a [[lithic industry]] belonging to the [[Capsian culture|Capsian]] were discovered ''in situ'' by D. Grébénart at Aïn Naga and dated to 5500 B.C., plus or minus 220.

==The probable ancient regional ecology==
North Africa enjoyed a fertile climate during the subpluvial era; what is now the Sahara supported a [[savanna]] type of ecosystem, with [[elephant]], [[giraffe]], and other grassland and woodland animals now typical of the [[Sahel]] region south of the desert. Historian and Africanist [[Roland Oliver]] has described the scene as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[In] the highlands of the central [[Sahara]] beyond the [[Libyan desert]],... in the great [[massif]]s of the [[Tibesti]] and the [[Hoggar]], the mountaintops, today bare rock, were covered at this period with forests of [[oak]] and [[walnut]], [[Lime (fruit)|lime]], [[alder]] and [[elm]]. The lower slopes, together with those of the supporting bastions — the [[Tassili]] and the [[Tadrart Acacus|Acacus]] to the north, [[Ennedi]] and [[Aïr Mountains|Air]] to the south — carried [[olive]], [[juniper]] and [[Aleppo pine]]. In the valleys, perennially flowing rivers teemed with fish and were bordered by seed-bearing grasslands.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roland Oliver|Oliver, Roland]] (1999), ''The African Experience: From Olduvai Gorge to the 21st Century'' (Series: History of Civilization), London: [[Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson|Phoenix Press]], revised edition, pg 39.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''Royal Army Medical College (RAMC)''' was located on a site south of the [[Tate Gallery]] (now known as Tate Britain) on [[Millbank]], in [[Westminster]], London, overlooking the [[River Thames]]. The college moved from the site in 1999 and the buildings are now occupied by the [[Chelsea College of Arts]].

==History==
[[File:OS Millbank Tate etc 2.jpg|250px|thumb|Ordnance Survey maps of London extract for 1916. This shows clearly the octagonal outline of the former penitentiary surrounding the small site. At the centre is the National Gallery of British Art, afterwards known as the Tate Gallery, and now as [[Tate Britain]], with the college in the south of the site and hospital in the north. Most of the streets remain as at 2012 apart from Bulinga Street, most of which has been built over, and Dundonald Street which has been renamed 'John Islip Street'. There is a 'Census Office' at the rear of the gallery, long since gone.]]

The site, including that of the Tate Gallery (which opened in 1897), was previously occupied by the [[Millbank Prison]] from 1821 to the late 19th century. The college was built by John Henry Townsend and Wilfred Ainslie in Imperial [[Baroque]] style. They also designed the adjoining Regimental Officers’ [[Mess]] and Commandant's House, in [[French Renaissance]] style. The buildings were opened by [[King Edward VII]] and [[Alexandra of Denmark|Queen Alexandra]] on 15 May 1907. A statue of Sir [[James McGrigor]], the father of army medicine, originally at the [[Royal Hospital, Chelsea]] was moved to the grounds in 1907 and then moved again to the [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]] in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/101452265-statue-of-sir-james-robert-mcgrigor-b-g-m-d-at-royal-military-academy-sandhurst-surrey-heath-borough-council-st-michaels-ward#.Wka1l2hl8dU|title=Statue of Sir James Robert McGrigor B. G., M. D. at Royal Military Academy Sandhurst|publisher=British listed buildings|accessdate=29 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Queen Alexandra's Military Hospital]] was built to the north of the Tate Gallery and opened in 1905. [[Cooper Perry|Sir Cooper Perry]] was [[knighted]] in 1903 for helping set up the college.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/35486 |first=H. L. |last=Eason|title=Perry, Sir (Edwin) Cooper (1856–1938)|publisher= Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|year=2004|accessdate= 5 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[World War I|First World War]] the college was used to prepare vaccines, including a vaccine against [[typhoid]] which was developed at the college.

==Origin==
The '''Soundings''' [[podcast]] was started in 2013 by [[Dylan Haskins]], a broadcaster and producer, and singer-songwriter [[Lisa Hannigan]]. The podcast revolves around Hannigan and Haskin's, two Irish expats living in London, reactions to the various “culture, books, music, theatre, films and other weird things that happen."[5] Although each episode the hosts, sometimes joined by guests, discussed their opinions on recent books, films, exhibitions and plays, from the onset Haskins was clear that the Soundings was not a review show stating that '''“People make art to express their ideas and provoke thought and conversation, which is what this show is all about."'''[6] The name Soundings was chosen by Hannigan as a nod to a Leaving Certificate poetry book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hannigan|first1=Lisa|last2=Haskins|first2=Dylan|title=Soundings 1: Blue is the Warmest Colour, Paul Muldoon's rock lyrics and Subcultures Exhibition|website=Soundings podcast|accessdate=2013-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style==
The show quickly won fans for its relaxed style and the chemistry between its co-hosts. As well as discussing current cultural topics the show also featured segments including the "Education of Dylan Haskins" where Hannigan introduced Haskins to a selection of classic films, and the Desensitization of Lisa Hannigan where they sought to test the nerves of the usually skittish Hannigan through a series of tests, including a visit to [[Chislehurst Caves]].

'''''Summer Evening at Skagen Beach – The Artist and his Wife''''' ({{lang-da|Sommeraften ved Skagens strand. Kunstneren og hans hustru}}) is an 1899 painting by [[Peder Severin Krøyer]]. One of the best known paintings of the [[Skagen Painters]], it depicts Krøyer with his wife [[Marie Krøyer|Marie]] and his dog Rap strolling on the beach in the moonlight.

==Background==
{{main|Skagen Painters}}
The Skagen Painters were a close-knit group of mainly Danish artists who gathered each summer from the late 1870s in the fishing village of [[Skagen]] in the far north of [[Jutland]], painting the local fishermen and their own gatherings. P.S. Krøyer arrived there in 1882, quickly becoming the most prominent member of the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skagensmuseum.dk/en/collection/the-artists/ps-kroeyer/|title=P.S. Krøyer (1851-1909)|publisher=Skagens Museum|accessdate=6 August 2014 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1895, in a letter to his friend [[Oscar Björck]], Krøyer wrote "I am also thinking of painting a large portrait of my wife and me together — but for that I shall definitely need good weather, so it won't be this year." In fact it was four years later, in the summer of 1899, that he finally created his large painting. Maybe it was in recognition of 10 years of marriage with [[Marie Krøyer|Marie Triepcke]] as illustrated in other works of family life at the time as well as in a number of the photographs and sketches he used as a basis for the work.&lt;ref name=hirschsprung&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hirschsprung.dk/Image.aspx?id=12&amp;col=7|title=P.S. Krøyer i den Hirschsprungske Samling: Sommerafter ved Skagens Strand. Kunsteren og hans hustru|publisher=Hirschsprung|accessdate=18 August 2014 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Painting description==

The final result nevertheless has a rather melancholic tone. Despite the beautiful surroundings, Marie appears distant, disappearing into the blue moonlight. Even Krøyer's own weak figure seems to be experiencing difficulty in supporting her on his arm while the closest figure of all is Krøyer's faithful dog, Rap. After Krøyer had worked on the painting throughout the summer, he submitted it to the [[Charlottenborg Spring Exhibition]] in 1900.&lt;ref name=hirschsprung/&gt; It was not very well received there, being criticized as banal. In fact, it presents the blue half-light, a favourite with the [[Symbolists]] who believed the twilight hour heralded the coming of death. In 1907, Krøyer conveyed his own feelings about Skagen evenings: "Skagen can look so terribly dull in the bright sunlight ... but when the sun goes down, when the moon rises up out of the sea, ... with the fishermen standing on the beach and the cutters sailing by with loosened sails ... in recent years this has been the time I like most of all."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://extranet.uv.khs.dk/materiale/Dansk%20Opgave%201/www/opg4-hirschsprung/arbejder/234/index.html|title=Sommeraften ved Skagens strand|publisher=Køge Hamdelsskole|accessdate=18 August 2014 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few months after the spring exhibition, Krøyer was admitted to Middelfart Mental Hospital after suffering a nervous breakdown.&lt;ref name=hirschsprung/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2164">The '''Swedish Art Music Society''' ({{Lang|sv|Musikaliska konstföreningen}}) is a non-profit organisation with the aim of publishing Swedish art music. It was founded by Swedish composers in 1859 to facilitate the publishing of Swedish art music, then largely controlled by German publishers.

Each year, one or a couple of pieces of music are selected for publication. Composers include [[Wilhelm Stenhammar|Stenhammar]], [[Amanda Röntgen-Maier|Röntgen-Maier]], [[Hugo Alfvén|Alfvén]], [[Otto Olsson|Olsson]], [[Gunnar de Frumerie|de Frumerie]], [[Dag Wirén|Wirén]], Carlstedt and Welin. Often, contemporary music is chosen, but sometimes the organisation elects to publish older masterpieces which have remained unpublished, such as the recent publication of the symphonies by the Swedish 18th-century composer [[Joachim Nicolas Eggert|Eggert]].

This example of [[Persian people|Persian]] [[Sassanid art]] is located 5&amp;nbsp;km from the city center of [[Kermanshah]]. It is located in the heart of the [[Zagros|Zagros mountain]]s, where it has endured almost 1,700 years of wind and rain. Originally, several sources were visible next to and below the reliefs and arches, some of which are now covered. Sources next to the reliefs still feed a large basin in front of the rock. The site has been turned into an archaeological park and a series of late Sasanian and Islamic column capitals have been brought together (some found at Taq Bostan, others at [[Bisutun]] and Kermanshah).

The carvings, some of the finest and best-preserved examples of Persian sculpture under the Sassanids, include representations of the investitures of [[Ardashir II]] (379–383) and [[Shapur III]] (383–388). Like other Sassanid symbols, Taq-e Bostan, and its relief patterns accentuate power, religious tendencies, glory, honor, the vastness of the court, game and fighting spirit, festivity, joy, and rejoicing.

Sassanid kings chose a beautiful setting for their rock reliefs along an historic [[Silk Road]] caravan route [[waypoint]] and campground. The reliefs are adjacent a sacred springs that empty into a large reflecting pool at the base of a mountain cliff.

Taq-e Bostan and its rock relief are one of the 30 surviving Sassanid relics of the [[Zagros mountains]]. According to [[Arthur Pope]], the founder of Iranian art and archeology Institute in the US, "art was characteristic of the Iranian people and the gift which they endowed the world with."

==Description of the rock reliefs==
The Taq-e Bostan complex comprise a rock relief standing on its own and several more reliefs associated with two rock cut arches. They illustrate the investiture ceremonies of the kings [[Ardashir II]], [[Shapur II]], [[Shapur III]] and [[Khosrau II]]. They also depict the hunting scenes of Khosrau II.

=== Investiture of Ardashir II ===
[[Image:Scene outside the Taq Bostan arch, crowning ceremony of Ardashir II.png|250px|thumb|left|The first scene outside the arch, crowning ceremony of [[Ardashir II]]]]

The first Taq-e Bostan relief, and apparently the oldest, is a rock relief of the crowning ceremony of [[Ardashir II]] (379-383 AD) by his predecessor [[Shapur II]] or Ahura Mazda (although even the middle figure is wearing a Sassanian crown, with the balloon-like top/compartment [apparently to hold their hair in], and the figure to his left is the receiver of the ring; so he could not be Ahura Mazda, either). Researchers long debated the identities of the figures in this relief but is now ascertained that Ardashir II receives the beribboned ring - symbol of royal investiture - from his predecessor Shapur II or Ahura Mazda. There may be a deliberate mixture of the iconography of both identities. The two main figures are standing on the fallen Roman emperor Julianus Apostata (361-363 AD). Ardashir played an important role in his defeat during the reign of Shapur II (309-379 AD). Exceptional within Sasanian art is the fact that this is a portrait, based on the image of Julianus Apostata as it appears on Roman coins. Ardashir II was installed as interim ruler, awaiting the coming of age of the royal heir Shapur III (383-388 AD). The fourth figure is the god Mithra who holds a barsum in his hands and stands on a lotus flower. He is the protector of oaths and is witness to this pact. 
Local beliefs and Persian folk tale interpreted the scene as the victory of the first Sasanian kings on Artabanus IV, the last king of the Parthian dynasty. The Mithra figure became the visual inspiration for representations of the prophet Zoroaster.

The relief panel is approx. 4.07 m wide and 3.9 m high.

=== Shapur II and Shapur III ===

The smaller arch or iwan (Taq-e Bustan II) has on the upper part of the back wall two [[Pahlavi script|Pahlavi]] inscriptions identifying two royal figures as Shapur II (Shapur the Great) and his son Shapur III. They are shown facing each other. The arch's vestibule measures 6 x 5 x 3.6 meters. It has been suggested as having been built during the reign of Shapur III and some put the date of its completion at 385 AD. However, the royal crown of Shapur III does not agree with those on his coins and is closer to that of his predecessor Ardashir II. It has been argued that the texts represent an usurpation of Ardashir's relief by Shapur III. The translation of the inscriptions follows:

'''Shapur II inscription :'''

:''This is the figure of [[Ahura Mazda|Mazda]]-worshipping Lord Shapur, the king of kings of Iran and [[Aniran]], whose race is from the Gods. Son of Mazda-worshipping Lord [[Hormizd II of Persia|Hormizd]], the king of kings of Iran and Aniran, whose race is from the Gods, grandson of Lord [[Narseh of Persia|Nersi]], the [[Shahanshah]] (king of kings).''

The figures of the two kings have been carved in low relief, looking at each other. Each figure is ca. 2.97 meters. Shapur II is on the right and Shapur III is on the left. Their hands are placed on a long straight sword which point downwards. The right hand is holding the grip and the left rests on the sheath. Both figures wear loose trousers, necklaces, curled hair, and a pointed beard ending in a ring.

=== Iwan of Khusrow II ===
The three figures on the back wall of the large ''iwan'' are usually considered to represent [[Khosrau II of Persia|Khosrow Parviz]] flanked by [[Ahura Mazda]] and [[Anahita]]. They are placed above a mounted Persian knight, thought to be Khusrow himself riding his favourite horse, [[Shabdiz]]. There is, however, no unanimity about the exact identification of this late Sasanian king. The two attending figures are sometimes considered to be a priest and a priestess, rather than the gods Ahura Mazda and Anahita themselves.

One of the most impressive reliefs inside the largest grotto or ''ivan'' is the gigantic [[equestrian sculpture|equestrian]] figure of the Sassanid king [[Khosrau II]] (591-628 CE) mounted on his favorite charger, [[Shabdiz]]. Both horse and rider are arrayed in full battle armor.

The front of the rock-cut arch bears delicately carved patterns showing the tree of life or the sacred tree. Above the arch and located on two opposite sides are figures of two winged women with [[Diadem (personal wear)|diadems]].

Equestrian relief panel measured on 16.08.07 approx. 7.45m across by 4.25 m high

===Scene of boar and deer hunting===
[[File:IranTaqIBustanEberjagdKhosrowsII.jpg|thumb|Scene of boar and deer hunting]]
On the right and left wall of the arch, there is a picture of the king's hunting measuring 3.8 X 5.7 meters. From the time of Cyrus the Great to the end of Sassanid period, hunting was one of the most favourite activities of Iranian kings. Therefore, scenes of hunting are frequently found next to those of crownings.

There are two hunting scenes on each side of the ivan. One scene depicts the imperial boar hunt, and in a similar spirit, the other scene shows the king stalking deer. Five elephants flush out the fleeing boars from a marshy lake for the king who stands poised with bow and arrow in hand while being serenaded by female musicians. In the next scene, another boat carries female harpists and shows that the king has killed two large boars. The next boat shows the king standing with a semicircular halo around his head and a loose bow in his hand, meaning the hunt is over. Under this picture, elephants are retrieving the game with their trunks and putting them on their backs. Several episodes of the royal hunt are thus shown at the same time.

These royal hunting scenes are among the most vivid and highly narrative murals immortalized in stone.

Panel depicting boar hunt measured on 16.08.07 as approx. 6.0 m wide x 4.25 m high

Panel depicting deer hunt measured on 16.08.07 as approx. 5.9 m wide x 4.35 m high

=== Dowlatshah Relief ===
Jumping 1300 years in time the upper relief shows the 19th century [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar]] Governor in [[Kermanshah]] city, [[Dowlatshah]] carving a relief in a big arch.

'''The Call to Poetry''' was a one-night [[performance art]] / international poetry gathering event held April 5, 2012 in [[Istanbul]], near [[Taksim Square]], widely promoted and heavily attended by international poets to celebrate the [[history of poetry]] with a dramatic reading of the world’s oldest love poem, which is housed in the [[Istanbul Archaeology Museums]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Istanbul to host celebration of world’s oldest love poem|url=http://www.todayszaman.com/news-276386-istanbul-to-host-celebration-of-worlds-oldest-love-poem.html|newspaper=Today's Zaman|date=April 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Call to Poetry garnered significant interest in Istanbul, the greater Middle East and the US,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ancient Love Poem Sees Light of Day in Istanbul|url=http://www.theworld.org/2012/04/ancient-love-poem-istanbul/|newspaper=PRI's The World|date=April 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; as did a portion of the evening dedicated to poetry of the [[Arab Spring]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hesham Al-Gakh’s Tahrir Square poetry honored in Istanbul|url=http://thedailynewsegypt.com/2012/04/08/hesham-al-gakhs-tahrir-square-poetry-honored-in-istanbul/|newspaper=The Daily News Egypt|date=April 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The poem was intended for a spring fertility ritual and recited by one of his brides.&lt;ref name="Guinness World Records 2007.

== Arab Spring Poetry ==
The Call to Poetry featured readings from contemporary Egyptian poet Hesham Al-Gak, a 2011 contestant on the Arab world's popular [[American Idol]]-style TV program based in [[Abu Dhabi]] called ''[[Prince of Poets]]''. During the Egyptian revolution, Al-Gak used the competition to recite poems critical of Egyptian leaders and departed ''Prince of Poets'''s Abu Dhabi studios to visit [[Cairo]]  to compose and recite verse at the height of protests there.

== Event Organizers ==
Call to Poetry organizer, American writer Dan Boylan cited [[Beat Generation]] figure [[Allen Ginsberg]] as an influence on the evening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Celebrating the World’s Oldest Love Poem in Istanbul on April 5th, 2012|url=http://www.turkishweekly.net/news/133112/celebrating-the-world’s-oldest-love-poem-in-istanbul-on-april-5th-2012-.html|publisher=The Turkish Weekly Journal|accessdate=March 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having met Ginsberg as a teenager, Boylan premiered Istanbul-inspired [[sound poetry]] during the event, which included music and an over-capacity crowd that listened from outside the venue. American journalist David Trilling served as the first Call to Poetry's master of ceremonies and New Zealand Poet Fred Simpon released his book of verse, “Lucky Me!” during the event.

'''''The Clock Without a Face''''' is [[puzzle book]] by Eli Horowitz and [[Mac Barnett]] with illustrations by Scott Teplin. It was published in 2010 by [[McSweeney's]]. The plot of the book revolves around the theft of 12 jeweled numbers from the face of "the Emerald Khroniker," a cursed clock, and with clues to the thief's identity and the whereabouts of the numbers are included throughout the text and in accompanying pictures. The identity of the thieves is revealed on the last page, but the location of the loot is not. The authors hid 12 actual emerald-studded numbers (crafted by [[Anna Sheffield]]) in locations around the United States, and readers are encouraged to search for them using the clues in the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weeklydig.com/arts-entertainment/words/201005/clock-without-face|title=THE CLOCK WITHOUT A FACE |last=Day|first=David|publisher=Weekly Dig|accessdate=2 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://chicago.timeout.com/articles/books/85263/the-clock-without-a-face-scott-teplin-mac-barnett-eli-horowitz-book-review|title=The Clock Without a Face - Scott Teplin, Mac Barnett, Eli Horowitz - Book Review - Time Out Chicago|last=Messinger|first=Jonathan|work=Time Out Chicago|accessdate=2 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2010-04-30/entertainment/20876930_1_book-clock-authors|title=Clues in book will lead to buried treasure|last=Vaziri|first=Aidin|date=April 30, 2010|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|publisher=San Francisco Chronicle|accessdate=2 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WeSat"&gt;{{cite web|title=   Read This Book And Join The Treasure Hunt|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=127790285|work=NPR|accessdate=12 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was designed to be a summer retreat for artists and craftspeople. In 1946 the estate closed and the foundation changed its purpose from a retreat to the bestowing of grants to artists.

In closing down her father's residence after his death, [[George Frederick Kunz]]' daughter, Ruby Zinsser, donated two paintings by [[Louis C. Tiffany]] to the Tiffany Foundation. "In 1935, the family of George F. Kunz donated two Tiffany paintings to the picture gallery." In this, she was following her father's inclination, since he had previously donated a Syrian bracelet and mineral collection to the Foundation in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;Frelinghuysen, Alice Cooney.

'''The Sydney Camera Circle''' was a [[Pictorialism|Pictorialist]] photographic society formed in 1916 in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]]. It was most active before World War II, and was influential on Australian photography for fifty years.

==History==

The Sydney Camera Circle was formed on 28 November 1916 at the Bostock-Little Studio, Phillip Street, Sydney. The founders were [[Cecil Bostock]], [[Harold Cazneaux]], Malcolm McKinnon, James Paton, [[James S. Stening]] and William Stewart White. All six signed a [[manifesto]], pledging to advance and promote a Pictorialist photography devoted to Australian sunlight and shadow as opposed to the greys and ‘dismal’ shadows of European styles.&lt;ref&gt;Harold Cazneaux letter to Jack Cato, National Library of Australia Manuscript MS 5416&lt;/ref&gt; In this ambition they shared the ideals of the [[Heidelberg School]] of Australian painters. The group was dominated by [[Amateur|amateurs]] interested in photography as an art form who shared constructive criticism and support at their meetings, exhibiting their work under the name of The Sydney Camera Circle.

The group continued as an entity until 1978 when membership was dwindling in competition with that of the Australian Photographic Society and the Camera Club of Sydney.

==Selected Exhibitions==

* 14 to 28 February 1921: at the invitation of [[Henri Mallard]], 115 prints were displayed at the Kodak Salon, Sydney with sales totaling £70.&lt;ref&gt;Harringtons Photographic Journal, Tuesday 1 March 1921 Page 22:
"In an exhibition of photographs opened on the 24th February at the Kodak Salon, George Street, Sydney, there are many examples of discerning selection of subject and artistic treatment in reproduction. The whole of the work is by members of the Sydney Camera Circle and includes quite a number of pictures that had been sent for exhibition to London. In pictorial photography the greatest success is achieved in the realm of repose - in capturing glimpses of city or countryside, revealing some of the more restful moments of the passing hour. Some very striking examples of artistic fidelity in this direction are to be seen at the exhibition. The pictures cover a wide field, including photographs of sea and sky, of trees, of shipping, of crowded streets, of almost deserted thoroughfares and so on. Of all these, perhaps, those photographs in which trees form a dominant part of the composition are the most satisfying to the artistic sense. "Sentinels of the Wood" and "Cameo" by Mr J.E. Paton and Mr W.S. White, are exquisite examples of what the artist photographer may accomplish. "Flower Sellers" by Mr C.W. Bostock - a picture which was reproduced in these pages some months ago - is well deserving of contemplation by amateurs, who so often are vexed by the difficulties of strong sunlight and deep shadows. It is a masterly piece of work. Among the pictures of pastoral life, one of stockmen watering their horses at a creek is a happy representation of a typical outback scene. The exhibitors are Messrs. C.W. Bostock, Chas. Wakeford, J.E. Paton, W.S. White, D.J. Webster, Monte Luke, H. Mallard, Arthur Ford, E.N. Poole, C. Laseron and Stanley William Eutrope."&lt;/ref&gt;
* February 1921: Scottish Photographic Federation Salon, Dundee included 60 prints from The Sydney Camera Circle.
* July 1921: London Salon shows 9 prints by 8 members of the Circle.
* October 1921:  Melbourne Arts and Crafts exhibition shows 50 photographs by the members. Kodak Melbourne shows the work in their windows.
* 1922: Colonial Competition 1922. Sydney Camera Circle takes first place with medals awarded to Henri Mallard and Florence Milson by the Amateur Photographer and Photography.
* 12 June to 8 July 1979: [[Art Gallery of New South Wales]] 'Australian Pictorial Photography', S.H. Ervin Gallery, Sydney.
* 14 January to 1 April 1984 Art Gallery of NSW 'The Sydney Camera Circle: The Early Years, 1916 - 1938'.

[[Image:WaterYam.jpg|thumb|right|320px|''Water Yam'', First Edition, 1963]]
'''''Water Yam''''' is an [[artist's book]]&lt;ref&gt;'As a book, Water Yam has a very open structure....' The Century of Artist's Books, Drucker, Granary 2004, p311&lt;/ref&gt; by the American artist [[George Brecht]]. Originally published in Germany, June 1963&lt;ref&gt;Fluxus Codex, Hendricks, Abrams 1989, p216&lt;/ref&gt; in a box designed by [[George Maciunas]] and typeset by [[Tomas Schmit]], it has been re-published in various countries several times since. It is now considered one of the most influential artworks released by [[Fluxus]],&lt;ref name="Dada and Radical Art Online"&gt;[http://members.chello.nl/j.seegers1/flux_files/brecht.html Dada and Radical Art Online]&lt;/ref&gt; the internationalist [[avant-garde]] art movement active predominantly in the 1960s and '70s. The box, sometimes referred to as a ''Fluxbox'' or ''Fluxkit'', contains a large number of small printed cards, containing instructions known as ''[[Event score|event-score]]s'', or ''fluxscores''. Typically open-ended, these scores, whether performed in public, private or left to the imagination, leave a lot of space for chance and indeterminancy, forcing a large degree of interpretation upon the performers and audience. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In some cases [event-scores] would arise out of the creation of the object, while in others the object was discovered and Brecht subsequently wrote a score for it, thus highlighting the relationship between language and perception. Or, in the words of the artist, “ensuring that the details of everyday life, the random constellations of objects that surround us, stop going unnoticed.” The event-score was as much a critique of conventional artistic representation as it was a gesture of firm resistance against individual alienation.&lt;ref name="Dada and Radical Art Online" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The work is considered an important precursor to [[conceptual art]].

==The scores==
[[Image:ThreeLampEvents.jpg|thumb|left|210px|''Three Lamp Event'', part of ''Lantern Extract'', a mail art project within the ''Yam Festival'', 1962,]]
Early editions of ''Water Yam'' collected around 70 event-scores together, created over a four-year period from 1959 to 1963. Later editions would add extra events (up to about 100), as well as a small flick book ''Nut Bone. A Yamfest Movie'', and [[white-on-black]] invitations to contact Brecht via a New York PO Box and arrange 'deliveries and relocations'.

Many of the scores had been used in [[mail art]] events between 1961 and '63, occasionally hand-written, typed or [[hectograph]]ed, more usually typeset; often signed neatly at the bottom of the card. When Maciunas collected the scores together the typeset style was kept, but the signatures were removed. The reliance on [[Bullet (typography)|bullet points]] (•) separating the performances from their title was a feature that remained consistent throughout the versions. The cards are all different sizes.

The scores divide roughly into three sections; the earliest ones, 1959–62, describe events intended to be performed (such as ''Solo for Violin, Viola, Cello or Contrabass'' • Polish, July 1962); a second group of scores from '62-63 tend towards describing the temporary creation of assemblages; (such as ''Chair Event'' • on a white chair a grater, tape measure, alphabet, flag, black and spectral colours, April 1962). The third group, also 1962-63, are more personal and abstract; (such as ''Thursday'' • Thursday, March 1963). When originally published, Maciunas decided to emphasize 14 of the more musical scores (such as the famous ''Drip Music''; A source of dripping water and an empty vessel are arranged so that the water falls into the vessel, January 1962) by printing them on orange cards, whilst the rest (such as ''Keyhole'' •Through either side) were printed on Brecht's more usual plain white card.

==Origins of event-scores==
{{See also|Fluxus#Event score}}

===John Cage and the experimental composition classes===
Brecht met the artist [[Robert Watts (artist)|Robert Watts]] at [[Rutgers University]] in 1957, and through Watts, [[Allan Kaprow]]. The three started to meet regularly for lunch at a local branch of [[Howard Johnson's]], New Jersey. After a meeting with [[John Cage]] organised by Brecht whilst the latter was in New Jersey hunting mushrooms,&lt;ref&gt;Allan Kaprow, quoted in George Brecht Events; A Heterospective, Robinson, Walter König p264&lt;/ref&gt; the three men started to attend Cage's experimental music composition classes at the [[New School for Social Research]] in New York. In the classes, Cage encouraged his students to use chance and games as major elements in the creation of art.  
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"George Brecht's understanding of an intimate situation was far greater than mine. I needed more space to really work. But George really came to life in that situation.... He became a leader; and immediately he influenced not only me, but everybody else: Jackson Maclow, Higgins, Hansen. George Segal stopped by, and so did Dine, Whitman and Oldenburg." Allan Kaprow&lt;ref&gt;Allan Kaprow in conversation with Sidney Simon, early 70's. Quoted in George Brecht Events; A Heterospective, Robinson, Walter König p264&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Initially writing theatrical scores similar to Kaprow's earliest [[Happening]]s, Brecht grew increasingly dissatisfied with the didactic nature of these performances. After performing in one such piece, Cage quipped that he'd "never felt so controlled before."&lt;ref name="findarticles.com"&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0268/is_8_44/ai_n18764245/pg_2 Quoted in George Brecht, by Yve-Alain Bois]&lt;/ref&gt; prompting Brecht  to pare the scores down to [[haiku]]-like statements, leaving space for radically different interpretations each time the piece was performed.

As well as Cage's constructive criticism, Brecht was becoming increasingly interested in [[Marcel Duchamp|Marcel Duchamp's]] theories on art, which he'd written about at length in ''Chance-Imagery'', a text written in 1957 but only published in 1966 by the [[Something Else Press]]. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
It was only while reading Robert Lebel's 1959 monograph on Duchamp and pondering the consequences of the readymade that Brecht truly understood what he was searching for: Just as the readymade is an object lifted from its mere commodity status by being transported into an art context, the "event" would be an act--often a simple one performed daily, such as turning on and off a switch--on which he would cast his spotlight in order to force us to pay attention to it, in order, as the Russian formalists would have said, to "make it strange" and "de-automatize our perception."&lt;ref name="findarticles.com" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
An exhibition of Brecht's work held at the Reuben Gallery, October 1959 ''Toward Events: An Arrangement'' clearly pointed the way: The press release stated that 'art is to become actively rather than passively existent, to be enjoyed as an unfolding experience....works, or 'events,' such as The Dome, The Case, The Cabinet, are presented three dimensionally.'&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in George Brecht Events; A Heterospective, Robinson, Walter König p34&lt;/ref&gt; The final piece in the jigsaw, combining a Duchampian love of chance with a scientific belief in art as research, was an epiphany Brecht had in 1960, in which he decisively separated the artwork from the control of the artist; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"In the Spring of 1960 ... waiting for my wife to come from the house, standing behind my English Ford station wagon, the motor running and the left-turn signal blinking, it occurred to me that a truly 'event' piece could be drawn from the situation." George Brecht.&lt;ref&gt;George Brecht, The Origin of Events, 1970 Quoted in George Brecht Events; A Heterospective, Robinson, Walter König p236&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===The Yam Festival, 1963===
''Yam'' was a name thought up by Brecht and Watts in late 1962 to act as an umbrella project 'for all manner of immaterial, experimental, as yet unclassified forms of expression.'&lt;ref name="George Brecht Events p68"&gt;George Brecht Events; A Heterospective, Robinson, Walter König p68&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically intending to provide a platform for 'art that could not be bought,' the earliest ''Yam'' events involved mailing event cards and other objects stamped with the word 'Yam', or variations, to friends. Designed to increase anticipation, the project reached a head with a month-long series of events in May, 1963, in New York, Rutger's University and [[George Segal|George Segal's]] farm. 
The ''Yam Festival'' was held on a farm in South Brunswick, New Jersey on 19 May 1963 to actions and happenings by artists including [[Dick Higgins]], [[Allan Kaprow]], [[La Monte Young]], and [[Wolf Vostell]].
The festival was organised as a wide ranging series of events taking place throughout the month, whose main objective was to bypass traditional gallery outlets, giving artists and 'receivers' greater freedom. [[Wolf Vostell]] made here his happening ''TV Burying''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medienkunstnetz.de/works/tv-burying/ ''Yam Festival'', 1963, Wolf Vostell, ''TV Burying'']&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"In all of its formats and strategies Brecht's and Watt's ''Yam Festival'' operated as an alternative to the gallery system, producing "art" that could not be bought." Julia Robinson&lt;ref name="George Brecht Events p68" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Artists participating in the festival included [[Alison Knowles]], Allan Kaprow, [[John Cage]], [[Al Hansen]], [[Ay-O]], [[Dick Higgins]], [[La Monte Young]], [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]] and [[Ray Johnson]]. The festival has come to be seen as a proto-fluxus event, involving many of the same artists. ''Yam'' evolved parallel to George Maciunas' ''Fluxfests'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/grove/art/T028714?q=fluxus&amp;search=quick&amp;pos=1&amp;_start=1#firsthit Oxford Art Online, Fluxus essay by Michael Corris, Subscription Only]&lt;/ref&gt; set up with almost identical aims but currently operating only in Europe whilst Maciunas was stationed in Germany. The International Fluxus Festival of the Newest Music (''Festum Fluxorum''), 1962–63, would feature the work of artists such as Cage, [[Raoul Hausmann]] and [[Nam June Paik]]. Brecht's event-scores, including the famous ''Drip Event'', were amongst the pieces Maciunas would perform, along with pieces by Kaprow, Watts, [[Daniel Spoerri]], [[Robert Filliou]], [[Terry Riley]], [[Emmett Williams]], [[Joseph Beuys]], [[Wolf Vostell]] and [[Dick Higgins]].

===Maciunas in Germany===

Clearly aware of the ''Yam Festival'', Maciunas brought together 73 of Brecht's event-scores whilst working as a free-lance designer for the [[Allied Occupation Zones in Germany|US army]] stationed at [[Eppstein#Ehlhalten|Ehlhalten]] near [[Wiesbaden]],&lt;ref&gt;Tomas Schmitt, Maciunas' assistant in 1963 quoted in George Brecht Events; A Heterospective, Robinson, Walter König p276&lt;/ref&gt; and placed them in a box with a fine example of his [[graphic design]] pasted onto the cover. Maciunas referred to the box as 'Brecht's complete works'&lt;ref&gt;Fluxus Codex, Hendricks, Abrams, 1989 p217&lt;/ref&gt; and intended it to be the first in a series compiling works by artists he admired. Few of these intended 'collected works' ever saw the light of day.The use of multiple [[font]]s derived from his interest in experimental [[typography]] by [[Dada]] figures such as [[Hugo Ball]] and Raoul Hausmann, and was to prove crucial in defining a recognisable style for fluxus products. 

Published in spring 1963, the box was designed to be the cheapest and simplest way of disseminating art, and in keeping with Maciunas' beliefs, was neither numbered nor signed, although later editions would be published as limited, numbered editions. The box is the very first ''Fluxkit'', and the only published link between Brecht and Watt's ''Yam Festival'', and Maciunas' ''FluxFests''.

==Later versions==
It has since been re-published a number of times with differing numbers of event-scores, alternate designs on the cover, and housed in various materials, including plastic boxes and wooden ones. It is worth noting that later editions such as the English ''Parrot Impressions'', 1972, or the ''Lebeer Hossmann'' edition, 1986, don't include Maciunas' graphic design, and don't include the word ''Fluxus'' anywhere in or on the work. Ironically, for an object conceived as an "inexpensive, mass-produced unlimited edition (designed) to erode the cultural status of art and to help to eliminate the artist’s ego."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/grove/art/T028714?q=fluxus&amp;hbutton_search.x=0&amp;hbutton_search.y=0&amp;hbutton_search=search&amp;source=oao_gao&amp;source=oao_t118&amp;source=oao_t234&amp;source=oao_t4&amp;search=quick&amp;pos=1&amp;_start=1#firsthit Fluxus]".
