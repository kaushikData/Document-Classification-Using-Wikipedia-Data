'''Ahmad bin Muhammad bin al-Siddiq al-Ghumari''' was a Muslim traditionist and scholar of [[Hadith]] from Morocco.&lt;ref&gt;Mustafa Shah, ''The Hạdīth: Scholarship, perspectives, and criticism'', Routledge, 2010, p. 210&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Ghumari was born on the 27th of [[Ramadan]] in 1320 according to the [[Islamic calendar]], corresponding to December 26, 1902 [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]].&lt;ref name=birth/&gt; He was the older brother of fellow clerics [[Abdullah al-Ghumari]] and [[Abd al-Aziz al-Ghumari]]. As a child, he studied in Morocco's traditional [[madrasa]] system, [[Hafiz (Qur'an)|memorizing]] the entire [[Qur'an]] by heart, in addition to traditional Islamic texts such as [[Alfiya]], [[Ajārūmīya]] and [[Bulugh al-Maram]].

In 1921, he traveled to [[Egypt]] and enrolled in [[Al-Azhar University]], returning to Morocco upon the death of his father.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}} Ghumari went to Egypt a second time in 1931 when his younger brothers Abdullah and Muhammad also enrolled in the university. Due to fears regarding activity of the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] in Egypt, his brother Abdullah was sentenced to ten years in prison on accusations of ties to the group in 1961. Ahmad al-Ghumari, upon hearing the news of his younger brother's long sentence, fell ill and died eight months later.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}}

==Career==
Ghumari was a prolific writer, having authored more than one-hundred books. He was well known for a debate which acrimoniously began between him and fellow hadith scholar [[Muhammad Nasiruddin al-Albani]], and later continued with between Ghumari's younger brother Abdullah and Albani.&lt;ref name=moin&gt;Muhammad Moin, [http://alsonnah.wordpress.com/2011/03/08/ahmed-al-ghumari-on-al-albani/ "Ahmed Al-Ghumari on Al-Albani"]. ''Al-Sunnah'': 8 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the older Ghumari's attestation to Albani's high level of knowledge and respected status in [[Hadith studies]], the nature of the debate between them became personal and involved character attacks.

Like the rest of his family, Ghumari was a leader of the [[Siddiqiyya]] Sufi [[Tariqa|order]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Abd al-Aziz al-Ghumari]], ''Ma Yajuz wa ma la Yajuz fi al-Hayat al-Zawjiyyah'', pg. 9. Amman: Dar al-Fath, 2009. {{ISBN|9789957231309}}&lt;/ref&gt; a branch of the larger [[Shadhili]] order.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} [[Muhammad Taqi-ud-Din al-Hilali]] claimed that al-Ghumari had chosen to live a very simple life and eschewed material excess.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hassan Kettani]], ''Fiqh al-Hafizh Ahmad bin al-Siddiq al-Ghumari'', pg. 58. [[Amman]]: Dar al-Bayariq, 2001. Jordanian National Library #2001/6/1146&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views==
Although a practitioner of [[Sufism]], Ghumari was a strong critic of many Sufis, especially the rival [[Naqshbandi]] [[Tariqa|order]].&lt;ref name=haddad&gt;[[Gibril Haddad]], [http://www.abc.se/home/m9783/ir/f/The%20Ghumari%20School.htm The Ghumari School]. 6 December 2002: Living Islam. Last updated 2 June 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Like [[Ibn Hazm]], Ghumari viewed scholarly [[Ikhtilaf|difference of opinion]] as a curse. Like his brothers, he often used harsh language when responding to intellectual opponents.&lt;ref name=moin/&gt;&lt;ref name=haddad/&gt; Having originally followed the [[Maliki]] [[Madhhab|school of thought]] like most of Muslim scholarship in Morocco, al-Ghumari later switched to the [[Shafi'i]] school for a period and finally opted for absolute [[Ijtihad|independent reasoning]].&lt;ref&gt;Hassan Kettani, ''Fiqh al-Hafizh'', pgs. 61-62.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike most of Moroccan scholarship, al-Ghumari opposed the [[Ash'ari]] school of theology.&lt;ref name =kett62&gt;Hassan Kettani, ''Fiqh al-Hafizh'', pg. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Muhammad Abu Khubza]], among other Moroccan scholars, also claim that al-Ghumari temporarily adhered to the [[Zaidiyyah]] school of [[Shia Islam]].&lt;ref name =kett62/&gt;

'''American Studies Leipzig''' is the name used for the research and teaching institution for [[American Studies]] at [[University of Leipzig]]. A transdisciplinary institute focussing on literature and cultural studies, it is the largest institute for American Studies in [[New states of Germany|Eastern Germany]].

== Significance ==
===Academia===
American Studies Leipzig is the fastest-growing institute for American Studies in Germany that is not located in Berlin. In 2003, the [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright Commission]] endowed a newly created ''Distinguished Chair'' guest professorship, after the CHE research and education thinktank, part of [[Bertelsmann Foundation]], had attested the institute extraordinary quality.
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uni-protokolle.de/nachrichten/id/26785/&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2005, the [[German Academic Exchange Service|DAAD]] further distinguished the institute by creating the ''DAAD Distinguished Chair for American and International Studies'' guest professorship.&lt;ref&gt;http://americanstudies.uni-leipzig.de/faculty/guest_scholars/&lt;/ref&gt; This was intended to honor and further facilitate the institute's eagerness to innovation and its dedication to transatlantic studies.

In 2006, the institute succeeded in winning its third guest professorship in only four years. The ''Picador Chair for Literature'' is the outcome of a series of events by [[Georg von Holtzbrinck Publishing Group]] in cooperation with DAAD. Its purpose is to invite young English-speaking authors to live, write and teach in Leipzig. Thus, American Studies Leipzig is the only German institute for American studies supplementing its program of literary studies teaching with the perspective of actual creative artists, regularly.&lt;ref&gt;http://americanstudies.uni-leipzig.de/news/36&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, the institute features the largest research corpus on the [[New Deal]] in a German university.

===Beyond Academia===
Extra to its meaning for the University of Leipzig, the institute is a component of the cultural scenery of the city of [[Leipzig]]. Featuring regular public readings by American authors, public events like the ''HipHop Awareness Week'' and continuing education of [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] teachers, the institute is a steady component of the general public and educational landscape in Leipzig and its surrounding region.

For issues of American culture and politics, the institute is an important counterpart for regional and national media, who regularly ask members of the institute for commentary concerning current proceedings in the US.

== Main research ==
The programs of American Studies Leipzig focus especially on cultural and literary studies of the [[United States]]. This emphasis is supplemented by the institute's teaching of [[American English]], regular gueast lectures (such as the Fulbright Lecture Series), exchange programs with US universities (among others: [[Mount Holyoke College]], [[University of Miami]] and [[Ohio University]]) and study trips to the US.

Research at the institute focusses on ''[[Ethnicity|Ethnic group]]'', ''[[Gender]]'', ''[[Immigration|Immigration to the United States]]'' and ''[[Popular Culture|Popular culture studies]]''.

Established 1997 and supported by donations, ''Frank Freidel Memorial Library'' features about 15'000 books and periodicals with a topical focus on the [[New Deal]].

'''Anna Maria Bisi''' (1938–1988), known as '''A. M. Bisi''', was an Italian [[archaeologist]] and academic, specialising in the [[Phoenicians]] and [[Punics]]. 

==Life==
Bisi had a single minded career. She was supported by S.Moscato when she obtained her doctorate and after she published "Il

The '''Armazi stele of Serapit''' ({{lang-ka|სერაფიტას არმაზის სტელა}}) or '''Armazi bilingual''' ({{lang-ka|არმაზის ბილინგვა}}) is a funerary [[stele]] with [[bilingual inscription]]s written in [[Ancient Greek]] and [[Armazic language|Armazic]], a local idiom of [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]], found in 1940, at [[Armazi]], near [[Mtskheta]], in the ancient capital of the [[Kingdom of Iberia]]. The stele [[Memorialization|memorialises]] a short-lived Georgian princess named Serapit.&lt;ref&gt;Lang, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; The inscriptions mention Georgian monarchs, [[Pharnavaz I of Iberia]] and [[Pharasmanes II of Iberia]], and other members of [[aristocracy]]. The inscriptions are dated 150 AD.&lt;ref name="Rapp"&gt;Rapp, p. 216&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lang, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inscriptions==
===Ancient Greek inscription===
{{cquote|Serapeitis, daughter of Zeouach the Younger, pitiaxes, wife of Iodmanganos, son of Publicius Agrippa, pitiaxes, who won many battles as ''[[epitropos]]'' of the great king of the Iberians, Xepharnougos. She died, younger than twenty-one years, who had inimitable beauty.&lt;ref name="Rapp"/&gt;}}

===Aramaic inscription===
{{cquote|I am Serapit, daughter of Zewah the Younger, pitiaxes of King [[Pharasmanes II of Iberia|Pharasmanes]], wife of Yodmangan the victorious and winner of many victories, master of the court of King Xepharnougos and the son of Agrippa, master of the court of King Pharasmanes, victorious over the mighty, which [[Pharnavaz I of Iberia|Pharnavaz]] could not accomplish. Serapit was so fine and beautiful that no one was her equal in beauty. And she died in her twenty-first year.&lt;ref name="Rapp"/&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5833">An '''arrest without warrant''' or a warrantless arrest is an [[arrest]] of an individual without the use of an [[arrest warrant]]. 

== In the [[United States]] ==
=== Federal rules ===
In the Federal Government, an arrest without a warrant still requires probable cause - in the case of an arrest without a warrant, probable cause must be promptly filed. &lt;ref&gt;Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, Title II: Rule 5b&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In [[Florida]] ===
In Florida, an arrest without warrant is allowed&lt;ref&gt;Florida Statue 901.15&lt;/ref&gt; when:

* The person has committed a felony or misdemeanor, and the officer has witnessed it 
* A felony has been committed and the officer reasonably believes the person being arrested is the one who has committed it.
* A violation of Chapter 316 (Traffic law violation) has occurred 
* There is probable cause to believe that the person has committed a criminal act which violates a restraining order, such as possession of a firearm despite an injunction against doing so.  
* There is probable cause to believe that the person has committed an act of domestic and/or dating violence
* There is probable cause to believe that the person has committed child abuse
* There is probable cause to believe that battery, criminal mischief, or a violation of a safety zone has occurred
* There is probable cause to believe that a misdemeanor or Felony has been committed, based upon a signed affidavit by a law enforcement officer of the United States Government
* There is probably cause to believe that a violation of pretrial release has occurred, when the original arrest was for an act of domestic or dating violence
* There is probable cause to believe that the person has committed trespass in a secure area of an airport.
* There is probable cause to believe that the person has committed assault upon emergency services
* There is probable cause to believe that the person has committed sexual cyberharassment.

== In the [[United Kingdom]] ==
Section 24,&lt;ref&gt;Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, s24&lt;/ref&gt; as of January 1st 2006, provides that a constable may arrest, without a warrant,  anyone who is about to commit or is currently committing an offence (or anyone the constable has reasonable grounds to believe to be about to commit or currently committing an offence). The constable is also entitled to arrest anyone guilty of an offence or anyone who he reasonably believes to be guilty of an offence. However, the constable must have reasonable grounds that any of the following reasons make it necessary to arrest the person in question: to enable the real name or address of the person in question to be ascertained, or to prevent the person in question -

* causing physical injury to himself/herself or any other person, 
* suffering physical injury,
* causing loss of or damage to property,
* committing an offence against public decency (provided members of the public going about their normal business cannot reasonably be expected to avoid the person in question),
* causing an unlawful obstruction of the highway.
* to protect a child or other vulnerable person from the person in question,
* to allow the prompt and effective investigation of the offence or of the conduct of the person in question,
* to prevent any prosecution for the offence from being hindered by the disappearance of the person in question. 

Section 24A has similar provisions for [[Citizen's arrest|citizens' arrests]] but the reasons permitted for arrest by anyone other than a constable are limited to preventing the person in question from causing injury to the arrestor, themselves or to others; preventing property damage; or preventing the person in question from making off before a constable can assume responsibility for him.

The definition of an arrest, however, is contained in the judgement of [[Lord Diplock]] in ''Holgate-Mohammed v Duke'', where he stated that an arrest is "a continuing act; it starts with the arrester taking a person into his custody, (sc. by action or words restraining him from moving anywhere beyond the arrester's control), and it continues until the person so restrained is either released from custody or, having been brought before a magistrate, is remanded in custody by the magistrate's judicial act." &lt;ref&gt;[1984] AC 437, 441&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Philippine setting, a peace officer or a private person may, without a warrant, arrest a person:

a.   When, in his presence, the person to be arrested has committed, is actually committing, or is attempting to commit an offense;

b.   When an offense has just been committed and he has probable cause to believe, based on personal knowledge of facts or circumstances, that the person to be committed has committed it;

c.   When the person to be arrested is a prisoner who has escaped from a penal establishment or place where he is serving final judgment or temporarily confined while his case is pending, or has escaped while being transferred from one confinement area to another;

d.   Where the accused released on bail attempts to leave the country without court permission;

e.   Violation of conditional pardon, punishable under Article 159 of the Revised Penal Code as a case of evasion of service of sentence; and

f.   Arrest following a Deportation Proceeding by the Immigration Commissioner against illegal and undesirable means.

'''''Beyond Bias and Barriers: Fulfilling the Potential of Women in Academic Science and Engineering''''' ({{ISBN|0309100429}}) is a major report about the status of [[women in science]] from the [[United States National Academy of Sciences]].  Published in 2006, the report closely examines the data, proposed explanations, and possible responses to the relative dearth of women in science and engineering [[higher education in the United States]].

==History==
The report was written by the "Committee on Maximizing the Potential of Women in Academic Science and Engineering", a panel at the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]]. The Committee was chaired by [[Donna E. Shalala]],&lt;ref name="Dean-2006"&gt;Dean, NYT 2006/9/18.&lt;/ref&gt;  and included college presidents, provosts, professors, scientists, and policy analysts.&lt;ref name="Lederman-2006"&gt;Lederman, 2006/9/18.&lt;/ref&gt; Committee members included:  [[Alice M. Agogino]], [[Lotte Bailyn]], [[Robert J. Birgeneau]], [[Ana Mari Cauce]], [[Catherine D. DeAngelis]], [[Denice Denton]] (who committed suicide before the release of the report), [[Barbara Grosz]], [[Jo Handeslman]], [[Nan Keohane]], [[Shirley Malcom]], [[Geraldine Richmond]], [[Alice M. Rivlin]], [[Ruth Simmons]], [[Elizabeth Spelke]], [[Joan Steitz]], [[Elaine Weyuker]], and [[Maria T. Zuber]].&lt;ref name="NAS-2006"&gt;NAS, Sept. 18, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

As is typical with NAS reports, after the Committee drafted the report, it underwent a [[peer review]] process within the NAS, in this case reviewed by another Committee of nineteen members.&lt;ref name="Powledge"&gt;Powledge, 2006/10/13.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conclusions==
The report first notes and documents significant gender gaps throughout the academic pipeline in the sciences, finding that the numbers of women in the sciences decrease "at every educational transition" from high school through fully tenured faculty positions.&lt;ref name="Dean-2006"&gt;Dean, NYT 2006/9/18.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, over the past 30 years women have earned more than 30% of the doctorates in the social and behavioral sciences and more than 20% in the life sciences; but they hold only 15% of the full professorships in those fields.&lt;ref name="NAS-2006"&gt;NAS, Sept. 18, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Powledge"&gt;Powledge, 2006/10/13.&lt;/ref&gt; Minority women are "all but absent from professorships".&lt;ref name="Nelson"&gt;[[Donna Nelson|Dr. Donna J. Nelson]], Christopher N. Brammer, and Heather Rhoads. [http://faculty-staff.ou.edu/N/Donna.J.Nelson-1/diversity/Faculty_Tables_FY07 "A National Analysis of  Minorities in Science and Engineering Faculties at Research Universities."]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Diversity in Science Association and University of Oklahoma, Norman, OK. October 31, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The report then goes on to review ideas about the sources of the gender gaps, ultimately finding that the problem is "unconscious but pervasive bias", "arbitrary and subjective" evaluation processes, and a historic system which bases childrearing and family responsibilities on the concept of a professional spouse with a stay-at-home "[[wife]]".&lt;ref name="Dean-2006"&gt;Dean, NYT 2006/9/18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Singer, Nov. 10, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically the report found significant evidence of bias: women are paid less, promoted more slowly, receive fewer honors, and hold fewer leadership positions.&lt;ref name="NAS-2006"&gt;NAS, Sept. 18, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Although progress has been made in some areas—women are nearly at gender parity with men in entering graduate school in biology; when women are considered for initial promotion to associate professor they succeed at the same rates as men—there are still significant gaps.&lt;ref name="Powledge"&gt;Powledge, 2006/10/13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NAS-BBAB-2006"&gt;''Beyond Bias and Barriers'' (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

The report found that widespread ideas about women's and men's differences were largely irrelevant, including theories advanced such as cognitive abilities or preferences, career aspirations and ambition, or productivity and [[work ethic]] issues.&lt;ref name="Dean-2006"&gt;Dean, NYT 2006/9/18.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Finally, the report reviews a number of potential solutions and makes a variety of recommendations to level the playing field and "stop the leaks" in the leaky pipeline. These steps include
* alteration of academic procedures for hiring and evaluation ("[[tenure|promotion and tenure]]"), at the institutional level;&lt;ref name="Dean-2006"&gt;Dean, NYT 2006/9/18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NAS-2006"&gt;NAS, Sept. 18, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
* additional support for working parents at the institutional level;&lt;ref name="Dean-2006"&gt;Dean, NYT 2006/9/18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NAS-2006"&gt;NAS, Sept. 18, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
* efforts across the field to monitor hiring practices&lt;ref name="NAS-2006"&gt;NAS, Sept. 18, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Powledge"&gt;Powledge, 2006/10/13.&lt;/ref&gt;
* efforts to institute blind-review in [[peer review]] processes to eliminate [[gender bias]]; 
and other efforts.&lt;ref name="Powledge"&gt;Powledge, 2006/10/13.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and influence==
The report was widely well-received,&lt;ref name="Powledge"&gt;Powledge, 2006/10/13.&lt;/ref&gt; received significant media coverage,&lt;ref name="Haak-Agozino-2007"&gt;Haak &amp; Agozino, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and sparked a number of institutional-level meetings in the months after its release. In general its even-handed and data-rich approach was lauded,&lt;ref name="Powledge"&gt;Powledge, 2006/10/13.&lt;/ref&gt; although [[John Tierney (journalist)|John Tierney]], a ''New York Times'' opinion columnist, suggested that the report must have been biased because its committee was largely made up of women.&lt;ref name="Powledge"&gt;Powledge, 2006/10/13.&lt;/ref&gt; In response, [[Donna Shalala]] denied that the gender of the scientists biased their scientific findings, and pointed out that while the committee itself was largely made up of women, the committee's work was [[peer-review]]ed by a [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] committee of 19 that included 10 men.&lt;ref name="Powledge"&gt;Powledge, 2006/10/13.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of educational institutions held meetings or established committees to implement recommendations from the report, including [[Harvard University]], [[M.I.T.]], [[University of Texas]], [[Iowa State University]], [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]], [[Boston University]], [[Stanford University]], and the [[National Science Foundation]],&lt;ref name="Powledge"&gt;Powledge, 2006/10/13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Haak-Agozino-2007"&gt;Haak &amp; Agozino, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Council on Education]] (ACE), a higher education [[umbrella organization]], took the recommendation from the report to monitor hiring practices, and agreed to convene its member organizations to examine ways to do so.&lt;ref name="Powledge"&gt;Powledge, 2006/10/13.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] (AAAS) also convened a meeting at its annual conference.&lt;ref name="Haak-Agozino-2007"&gt;Haak &amp; Agozino, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shekhtman-2006"&gt;Lonnie Shekhtman, [http://www.aaas.org/news/releases/2006/1030wistem.shtml "Experts Meet at AAAS to Evaluate Ways to Recruit and Retain Women in S&amp;T"], ''AAAS News Release'', Oct. 30, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics have pointed out that in comparing the representation of women in the hiring pool (recent PhD recipients) versus among recent hires (assistant professors), approximations were used as mentioned in Notes on page 17 of the report; these overestimated both the representation and the utilization of women.  One was taking the representation of women among professors from the Survey of Earned Doctorates; as noted in the report, this ignored all professors who received their PhDs abroad.  Also data from the Survey of Earned Doctorates represent samples of those surveyed.  A third approximation is introduced by combining disciplines which show opposite trends in the utilization of their hiring pools, such as chemistry and chemical engineering.  More accurate data and comparisons are available from the [[Nelson Diversity Surveys]]&lt;ref name="Nelson"/&gt; (Table 11), which give more accurate comparisons by including all professors regardless of national origin, by getting populations instead of samples, and by treating the disciplines separately.&lt;ref name="Nelson"/&gt;

A '''connotation''' is a commonly understood [[culture|cultural]] or [[emotional]] association that some word or phrase carries, in addition to its explicit or literal [[meaning (philosophy of language)|meaning]], which is its [[denotation]].

A connotation is frequently described as either positive or negative, with regard to its pleasing or displeasing emotional connection. For example, a stubborn person may be described as being either ''strong-willed'' or ''pig-headed''; although these have the same literal meaning (''stubborn''), ''strong-willed'' connotes admiration for the level of someone's will (a positive connotation), while ''pig-headed'' connotes frustration in dealing with someone (a negative connotation).

==Usage==

"Connotation" branches into a mixture of different meanings. These could include the contrast of a word or phrase with its primary, [[Literal and figurative language|literal]] meaning (known as a [[denotation]]), with what that word or phrase specifically denotes. The connotation essentially relates to how anything may be associated with a word or phrase, for example, an implied value judgement or feelings.

It is often useful to avoid words with strong connotations (especially [[pejorative]] or [[wikt:disparaging|disparaging]] ones) when striving to achieve a [[Objectivity (philosophy)|neutral point of view]]. A desire for more positive connotations, or fewer negative ones, is one of the main reasons for using [[euphemism]]s.&lt;ref&gt;
Note that not all theories of [[linguistic meaning]] honor the distinction between literal meaning and (this kind of) connotation. See [[literal and figurative language]].&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Examples==
{|
| [[Image:Cartoony heart.svg|100px|left|Example seven
.]]
The denotation is a [[Representation (arts)|representation]] of a cartoon heart. The connotation is a '''symbol''' of love and affection.
|-
|-
| [[Image:Cartoony red rose.svg|left|100px|right|Example one.]]
The denotation of this example is a red [[rose]] with a green [[Plant stem|stem]]. The connotation is that it is a '''[[symbol]]''' of passion and love – this is what the rose represents.
|-
|}

==Logic==

In [[logic]] and [[semantics]], ''connotation'' is roughly synonymous with ''[[intension]]''. Connotation is often contrasted with ''[[denotation]]'', which is more or less synonymous with ''[[extension (semantics)|extension]]''. Alternatively, the connotation of the word may be thought of as the set of all its possible referents (as opposed to merely the actual ones). A word's ''denotation'' is the collection of things it refers to; its connotation is what it implies about the things it is used to refer to. The denotation of dog is (something like) four-legged canine carnivore. So saying, "You are a dog" would imply that you were ugly or aggressive rather than stating that you were canine.

The '''Crypt of Civilization''' is a sealed airtight chamber built between 1937 and 1940 at [[Oglethorpe University]] in [[Brookhaven, Georgia]], in [[Metro Atlanta]]. The {{Convert|2000|cuft|adj = on}} room contains numerous artifacts and documents, and is designed for opening in the year 8113 AD.&lt;ref name="crypt1"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-864|title= The New Georgia Encyclopedia &amp;mdash; Crypt of Civilization|accessdate= 2008-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="crypt3"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://crypt.oglethorpe.edu/history/|title= History of the Crypt of Civilization|accessdate= 2015-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 50th anniversary year of its sealing, the ''[[Guinness Book of World Records]]'' cited the crypt as the "first successful attempt to bury a record of this culture for any future inhabitants or visitors to the planet Earth."&lt;ref name="crypt2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Guinness Book of World Records (1990)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beginnings==

[[Thornwell Jacobs]] (1877&amp;ndash;1956), referred to as "the father of the modern [[time capsule]]", claimed to be the first in [[modern history|modern times]] to conceive the idea of consciously preserving man-made objects for posterity by placing them in a sealed repository.&lt;ref name="crypt1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="crypt2"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.oglethorpe.edu/about_us/crypt_of_civilization/|title= The Crypt of Civilization at Oglethorpe University|accessdate= 2008-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oglethorpe University president Thornwell Jacobs in an article of November 1936 ''Scientific American'' magazine.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jarvis, p. 350&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="trivia1"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.trivia-library.com/b/time-capsules-in-america-crypt-of-civilization.htm|title= Time Capsules in America Crypt of Civilization|accessdate= 2008-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jacobs's inspiration for the project was sparked by the Egyptian pyramid and tomb openings in the 1920s.  He was struck by the scarcity of historical information available from these ancient civilizations and imagined having a "running story" of the customs of human life from the beginning to the 1930s modern culture.&lt;ref name="crypt1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="shorthistory1"&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=1HbNQT3EWhcC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;lpg=PA16&amp;dq=Crypt+of+Civilization+&amp;ct=result#PPA18,M1|title= We Were Here: A Short History of Time Capsules By Patricia Seibert, p. 16-24|accessdate= 2008-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the claim that 4241 BC (July 19) is the "earliest fixed date" has been discredited&lt;ref name=Grimal&gt;Grimal, Nicolas. ''A History of Ancient Egypt.'' p.52. Librairie Arthéme Fayard, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; since Jacobs, he noted that 6,177 years had passed between when the Egyptian calendar was established in 4241 BC and the present year (AD 1936).  This figure served as the rationale for setting the opening of the crypt for 8113, as it was 6,177 years away.

Jacobs’s Crypt of Civilization intrigued America and was duplicated by many others.&lt;ref name="crypt1"/&gt;  In the mid-1930s, [[George Edward Pendray]], a public relations executive for the [[Westinghouse Electric Company]], was given an assignment to come up with a promotional event for the [[1939 New York World's Fair]].&lt;ref name="crypt1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="crypt3"/&gt; Pendray, also an amateur [[rocketeer]], suggested burying a "time capsule", a sealed rocket-shaped vessel made of a metal alloy called "cupaloy". The [[Westinghouse Time Capsules|Westinghouse time capsule]] is a {{convert|7|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} rocket-shaped tube with a metal exterior that encapsulated articles in a [[Pyrex]] inner tube.&lt;ref name="crypt3"/&gt; Pendray’s project was originally named a "time bomb", but the name was later changed to ''[[time capsule]]''. Pendray’s time capsule is scheduled to be opened in under 61 centuries.&lt;ref name="crypt1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="crypt3"/&gt;

== Construction ==
The Crypt of Civilization chamber is positioned on Appalachian granite bedrock located in the foundation of Phoebe Hearst Memorial Hall, a granite Gothic-style academic building at Oglethorpe University.&lt;ref name="crypt1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="crypt3"/&gt; The room was converted from a swimming pool from 1937 to 1940, and the walls were lined with enamel plates embedded in pitch.&lt;ref name="crypt1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="crypt3"/&gt;

The room is {{Convert|20|ft}} long, {{Convert|10|ft}} high and {{Convert|10|ft}} wide. The chamber is under a stone roof seven feet thick and lies over a two-foot stone floor.&lt;ref name="crypt3"/&gt; It is sealed with a stainless steel door welded in place.&lt;ref name="crypt1"/&gt;

[[Thomas Kimmwood Peters]] (1884&amp;ndash;1973) supervised construction and served as its [[archivist]].&lt;ref name="crypt1"/&gt;

==Artifacts==

The [[National Bureau of Standards]], Washington, D.C., gave professional and technical advice for the artifacts and construction of the crypt.&lt;ref name="crypt3"/&gt; The bureau also recommended how artifacts should be stored.&lt;ref name="crypt1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="crypt3"/&gt; Many artifacts are stored in stainless steel receptacles lined with glass and filled with an [[inert gas]] to prevent aging, a concept later carried over to the [[Westinghouse Time Capsules]]. The chamber resembles a cell of an Egyptian pyramid with artifacts positioned on shelves and the floor.&lt;ref name="crypt1"/&gt; The walls are lined with plaques containing illustrations by [[George L. Carlson]] in the form of [[pictograph]]s that "tell the history of communications and explain how to access the treasures buried in the tomb."&lt;ref&gt;Paul Tumey, "[http://www.tcj.com/figuring-out-george-carlson-part-1/ Figuring Out George Carlson]". ''The Comics Journal'', October 9, 2013. ([http://www.tcj.com/figuring-out-george-carlson-part-2/ Part 2 here.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the artifacts for the Crypt of Civilization were donated, including contributions from King [[Gustav V of Sweden]] and [[Eastman Kodak]].&lt;ref name="crypt3"/&gt; Suggestions for items to include in the crypt included items varying from "a pair of garters" to "a can opener" to "a dry martini complete with olive".&lt;ref&gt;Literary Digest, October 31, 1936, pp. 19&amp;ndash;20&lt;/ref&gt;

Included in the crypt are airtight receptacles containing microfilm on cellulose acetate film containing more than 800 classic works of literature, including the [[Bible]], the [[Quran]], [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'', and [[Inferno (Dante)|Dante's ''Inferno'']].&lt;ref name="crypt3"/&gt; There are approximately 640,000 pages included.&lt;ref name="shorthistory1"/&gt; A backup metal film system resides in the crypt as well.&lt;ref name="crypt1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="crypt3"/&gt; An original copy of the script for ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone With the Wind]]'' was donated by movie producer [[David O. Selznick]] to be included as well.&lt;ref name="crypt1"/&gt;

The crypt also contains voice recordings of historical figures such as [[Adolf Hitler]], [[Joseph Stalin]], [[Benito Mussolini]], and [[Franklin Roosevelt]]. Unusual sound clips were also included, such as the cartoon character [[Popeye the Sailor]] and a champion [[Hog Calling|hog caller]].&lt;ref name="crypt1"/&gt;

Jacobs addressed those who will open the crypt in AD 8113 in a note hoping for future efforts for preservation, saying, "The world is engaged in burying our civilization forever, and here in this crypt we leave it to you."&lt;ref name="crypt1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="crypt3"/&gt;

Peters placed electric [[microfilm reader]]s and [[Image projector|projector]]s in the vault to enable viewing and listening to these recordings. He provided a generator operated by a windmill to drive the apparatus, as well as a seven-power magnifier to read the microfilm records by hand in the event that the current form of electricity is not in use in AD 8113.&lt;ref name="crypt1"/&gt; Peters even included some current-day scientific instruments.&lt;ref name="trivia1"/&gt;

Unusual artifacts included are [[seed]] samples, [[dental floss]], the contents of a woman's purse, some [[Artie Shaw]] records, an electric [[toaster]], a [[pacifier]], a specially sealed bottle of [[Budweiser beer]], a [[typewriter]], a [[radio]], a [[cash register]], an [[adding machine]], a set of [[Lincoln Logs]], and plastic toys of [[Donald Duck]], the [[Lone Ranger]], and a [[Black doll]].&lt;ref name="crypt1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="crypt3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="trivia1"/&gt;

Some of the last items placed in the Crypt of Civilization were steel plates of the ''[[Atlanta Journal]]'' newspaper reporting on [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="crypt1"/&gt;

==Promotion==
Jacobs spoke on nationwide radio on [[NBC]] in New York City in 1937 to promote the crypt. A dedication ceremony on the Oglethorpe University campus, led by David Sarnoff of the [[Radio Corporation of America]] occurred in May, 1938. Peters included segments of Paramount newsreel films of this occasion in the crypt as well as film he had created about the crypt entitled ''The Stream of Knowledge'' (1938).&lt;ref name="crypt1"/&gt;

On May 25, 1940, Jacobs and Peters sealed the crypt in a solemn ceremony that was broadcast by Atlanta's [[WSB (AM)|WSB]] radio.&lt;ref name="crypt3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="crypt2"/&gt; Notable figures present at the ceremony included Dr. Amos Ettinger, Dr. M. D. Collins, Mayor [[William B. Hartsfield]], [[Ivan Allen, Jr.]], [[Clark Howell]], Governor [[Eurith D. Rivers]], and Postmaster General [[James A. Farley]].&lt;ref name="crypt3"/&gt;  The door was welded shut, and a plaque was fused to it with a '''''Message to the Generations of 8113''''' from Jacobs.

''This Crypt contains memorials of the civilization which existed in the United States and the world at large during the first half of the twentieth century. In receptacles of stainless steel, in which the air has been replaced by inert gases, are encyclopedias, histories, scientific works, special editions of newspapers, travelogues, travel talks, cinema reels, models, phonograph records, and similar materials from which an idea of the state and nature of the civilization which existed from 1900 to 1950 can be ascertained. No jewels or precious metals are included.''

''We depend upon the laws of the county of DeKalb, the State of Georgia, and the government of the United States and their heirs, assigns, and successors, and upon the sense of sportsmanship of posterity for the continued preservation of this vault until the year 8113, at which time we direct that it shall be opened by authorities representing the above governmental agencies and the administration of Oglethorpe University. Until that time we beg of all persons that this door and the contents of the crypt within may remain inviolate.''&lt;ref name="Interesting1"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.damninteresting.com/?p=414|title= Damn Interesting article on "The Crypt of Civilization"|accessdate= 2008-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peters included a machine called a "[[Language Integrator]]" in front of the sealed chamber to teach the openers how to speak English, which was another concept carried on to the [[Westinghouse Time Capsules]].&lt;ref name="crypt1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="shorthistory1"/&gt;

An entry from Jacobs's diary in April, 1937, reads, "We have been in 'Time' . . . 'Reader's Digest', [[Walter Winchell]]'s radio column ... and in newspapers from London to Australia.''&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs autobiography 1945, p. 512&lt;/ref&gt;

==After sealing==

There have been numerous retrospectives on the Crypt of Civilization by the [[Associated Press]], [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[NBC]], [[CNN]], [[NPR]], the [[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution|''Atlanta Journal and Constitution'']], ''[[The New York Times]]'' and others since the seal date.

After the sealing of the crypt in 1940, media organizations continued to re-visit the crypt in news stories every decade.

The [[International Time Capsule Society]] was formed at Oglethorpe University in 1990 on the fiftieth anniversary of the sealing of the Crypt of Civilization.&lt;ref name="crypt3"/&gt; This organization studies the variety of time capsules created worldwide.&lt;ref name="crypt1"/&gt;

The Crypt of Civilization regained prominence in millennium observances from 1999 to 2001. It was featured on television and covered by numerous newspapers.&lt;ref name="crypt1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="crypt3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="crypt2"/&gt;

The crypt was featured in an episode of ''[[Life After People|Life After People: The Series]]'' on the [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]].

[[Image:Babe Ruth Red Sox 1918.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Babe Ruth]], also known as "The Bambino", in his earlier days as a pitcher for the Red Sox]]
{{external media|image1=[http://boston.cbslocal.com/2012/03/02/red-sox-might-still-be-without-championship-if-new-playoff-system-were-in-effect-in-04/ Picture of the graffitied "reverse curve" road sign]|image2=[http://www.boston.com/sports/baseball/redsox/gallery/the_day_after?pg=3 Removal of the sign] (then re-graffitied to read "reverse'''d''' the curse") by a crew including Governor [[Mitt Romney]], following Boston's 2004 World Series victory.}}

The '''Curse of the Bambino''' was a [[superstition]] evolving from the failure of the [[Boston Red Sox]] [[baseball]] team to win the [[World Series]] in the 86-year period from 1918 to 2004. While some fans took the [[sports-related curses|curse]] seriously, most used the expression in a [[tongue-in-cheek]] manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shaughnessy|2005|pp=8–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This misfortune began after the Red Sox sold star player [[Babe Ruth]], sometimes nicknamed as "The [[wikt:Special:Search/bambino|Bambino]]", to the [[New York Yankees]] in the off-season of 1919–1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shaughnessy|1990|pp=31–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before that point, the Red Sox had been one of the most successful professional baseball franchises, winning [[1903 World Series|the first World Series]] and amassing five World Series titles.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shaughnessy|1990|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the sale, they went without a title for nearly a century as the previously lackluster Yankees became one of the most successful franchises in North American professional sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shaughnessy|2005|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The curse became a focal point of the [[Yankees–Red Sox rivalry]] over the years.

Talk of the curse as an ongoing phenomenon ended in 2004, when the Red Sox came back from a 0–3 best-of-seven deficit to beat the Yankees in the [[2004 American League Championship Series]] (ALCS) and then went on to sweep the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] to win the [[2004 World Series]].&lt;ref name="Sweep"&gt;{{harvnb|Shaughnessy|2005|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The curse had been such a part of Boston culture that when a "reverse curve" road sign on [[Longfellow Bridge]] over the city's busy [[Storrow Drive]] was graffitied to read "Reverse The Curse",&lt;ref name="Sign"&gt;{{harvnb|Shaughnessy|2005|p=231}}&lt;/ref&gt; officials left it in place until after the Red Sox won the 2004 Series. After the Red Sox won the last game of the World Series that year, the road sign was edited to read "Curse Reversed" in celebration.&lt;ref name="Sign"/&gt;

==Lore==
[[Image:Harry-frazee.jpg|thumb|right|[[Harry Frazee]] sold Babe Ruth to the Yankees.|upright]]
Although it had long been noted that the selling of Ruth had been the beginning of a decline in the Red Sox' fortunes, the term "curse of the Bambino" was not in common use until the publication of the book ''The Curse of the Bambino'' by [[Dan Shaughnessy]] in 1990.&lt;ref name="Lore"/&gt; It became a key part of Red Sox lore in the media thereafter, and Shaughnessy's book became required reading in some high school English classes in New England.&lt;ref name="Lore"&gt;{{harvnb|Shaughnessy|2005|pp=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ding-Dong, Curse is Dead|date=October 28, 2004|first=Kevin|last=Kernan|newspaper=New York Post|page=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the title drought dated back to {{wsy|1918}}, the sale of Ruth to the Yankees was completed January 3, 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shaughnessy|1990|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In standard curse lore, Red Sox owner and theatrical producer [[Harry Frazee]] used the proceeds from the sale to finance the production of a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[musical theater|musical]], usually said to be ''[[No, No, Nanette]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shaughnessy|2005|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, Frazee backed many productions before and after Ruth's sale, and ''No, No, Nanette'' did not see its first performance until five years after the Ruth sale and two years after Frazee sold the Red Sox. In 1921, Red Sox manager [[Ed Barrow]] left to take over as [[general manager (baseball)|general manager]] of the Yankees. Other Red Sox players were later sold or traded to the Yankees as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shaughnessy|2005|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neither the lore, nor the debunking of it, entirely tells the story. As [[Leigh Montville]] wrote in ''The Big Bam: The Life and Times of Babe Ruth'', the production ''No, No, Nanette'' had originated as a non-musical stage play called ''My Lady Friends'', which opened on Broadway in December 1919.&lt;ref name="Montville"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Big Bam: The Life and Times of Babe Ruth|publisher=Random House|year=2006|pages=161–164|first=Leigh|last=Montville|authorlink=Leigh Montville}}&lt;/ref&gt; That play had, indeed, been financed as a direct result of the Ruth deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shaughnessy|1990|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various researchers, including Montville and Shaughnessy, have pointed out that Frazee had close ties to the Yankees owners, and that many of the player deals, as well as the mortgage deal for Fenway Park itself, had to do with financing his plays.&lt;ref name="Montville"/&gt;

Yankee fans taunted the Red Sox with chants of "1918!" one weekend in September 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pennant Chases in East Still Flying High, West All but Flagged|date=September 25, 1990|first=Mark|last=Maske|newspaper=The Washington Post|page=E3|quote=Yankees fans had taunted the Red Sox all weekend with chants of "1918, 1918!"—the last time Boston won the World Series—and the Red Sox are not allowed by long-suffering New Englanders to forget the pain they have wrought with years of excruciating near misses.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The demeaning chant echoed at [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]] each time the Red Sox were there.&lt;ref name="Shaughnessy-1918!Chant"/&gt; Yankee fans also taunted the Red Sox with signs saying "1918!", "CURSE OF THE BAMBINO", pictures of Babe Ruth, and wearing "1918!" T-shirts each time they were at the Stadium.&lt;ref name="Shaughnessy-1918!Chant"&gt;{{harvnb|Shaughnessy|2005|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Frommer|Frommer|2004|pp=18, 78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Cursed" results==
Before Ruth left Boston, the Red Sox had won five of the first fifteen World Series, with Ruth pitching for the {{wsy|1916}} and {{wsy|1918}} championship teams (he was with the Sox for the [[1915 World Series]] but the manager used him only once, as a pinch-hitter, and he did not pitch). The Yankees had not played in any World Series up to that time. In the 84 years after the sale, the Yankees played in 39 World Series, winning 26 of them, twice as many as any other team in Major League Baseball. Meanwhile, over the same time span, the Red Sox played in only four World Series and lost each in seven games.&lt;ref name="Lore"/&gt;

Even losses that occurred many years before the first mention of the supposed curse, in 1986,&lt;ref name="Lore"/&gt; have been attributed to it. Some of these instances are listed below:
* In [[1946 Boston Red Sox season|1946]], the Red Sox appeared in their first [[1946 World Series|World Series]] since the sale of Babe Ruth and were favored to beat the [[St. Louis Cardinals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shaughnessy|1990|pp=63–64}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series went to a seventh game at [[Sportsman's Park]] in [[St. Louis]]. In the bottom of the eighth inning, with the score tied at 3–3, the Cardinals had [[Enos Slaughter]] on first base and [[Harry Walker]] at the plate. On a [[hit and run (baseball)|hit and run]], Walker hit a double to very short left-center field. Slaughter [[Slaughter's Mad Dash|ran through the third base coach's stop sign]] and beat Boston shortstop [[Johnny Pesky]]'s relay throw to home plate.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shaughnessy|1990|pp=66–68}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some say Pesky hesitated on the throw, allowing Slaughter to score, but Pesky always denied this charge. Film footage is inconclusive, except that it shows Pesky in bright sunlight and Slaughter in shadow. Boston star [[Ted Williams]], playing with an injury, was largely ineffective at bat in his only World Series.
* In [[1948 Boston Red Sox season|1948]], the Red Sox finished the regular season tied for first place,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bombers Bow, 5-1; Red Sox End Yanks' Flag Chances When Kramer Pitches a 5-Hitter|newspaper=The New York Times|date=October 3, 1948|first=John|last=Drebinger|page=S1|authorlink=John Drebinger}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shaughnessy|1990|p=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; only to lose the pennant to the [[Cleveland Indians]] in the major leagues' first-ever [[1948 American League tie-breaker game|one-game playoff]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Indians Win American League Flag, Beating Red Sox in Play-Off, 8-3|first=John|last=Drebinger|newspaper=The New York Times|date=October 5, 1948|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[1949 Boston Red Sox season|1949]], the Red Sox needed to win just one of the last two games of the season to win the pennant,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Frommer|Frommer|2004|p=319}}&lt;/ref&gt; but lost both games to the Yankees,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Vaccaro|2005|pp=322–325}}&lt;/ref&gt; who would go on to win a record five consecutive World Series from {{wsy|1949}} to {{wsy|1953}}.
* In [[1967 Boston Red Sox season|1967]], the Red Sox surprisingly reversed the awful results of the [[1966 Boston Red Sox season|1966]] season by [[1967 Boston Red Sox season|winning the American League pennant]] on the last weekend of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shaughnessy|1990|pp=98–99}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[1967 World Series|World Series]], they once again faced the Cardinals, and just as in 1946, the Series went to a seventh game. St. Louis won the deciding contest, 7–2, behind their best pitcher [[Bob Gibson]]; Gibson defeated Boston ace [[Jim Lonborg]], who was pitching on short rest and was ineffective. Gibson even hit a home run against Lonborg in the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shaughnessy|1990|p=102}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[1975 Boston Red Sox season|1975]], the Red Sox won the pennant and met the [[Big Red Machine|dynastic]] [[Cincinnati Reds]] in the [[1975 World Series|World Series]]. The Red Sox won Game 6 on a famous [[walk-off home run]] by catcher [[Carlton Fisk]], setting the stage for the deciding Game 7. Boston took a quick 3–0 lead, but the Reds tied the game. In the top of the ninth, the Reds brought in the go-ahead run on a [[Joe Morgan]] single that scored [[Ken Griffey, Sr.]], winning what is regarded as one of the greatest World Series ever played.
* In [[1978 Boston Red Sox season|1978]], the Red Sox held a 14-game lead in the [[American League East]] over the Yankees on July 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shaughnessy|2005|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Yankees subsequently caught fire, eventually tying Boston atop the standings on September 10 after sweeping a four-game series at [[Fenway Park]], an event known to Red Sox fans as the "Boston Massacre."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shaughnessy|1990|p=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six days later, the Yankees held a {{frac|3|1|2}} game lead over the Red Sox, but the Sox won 12 of their next 14 games to overcome that deficit and force a [[1978 American League East tie-breaker game|one-game playoff]] on October 2 at Fenway Park. The memorable moment of the game came when light-hitting Yankee shortstop [[Bucky Dent]] cracked a three-run home run in the seventh inning that hit the top of the left field wall (the [[Green Monster]]) and skipped out of the park, giving New York a 3–2 lead. The Yankees held on to win the playoff game, 5–4, eventually winning the [[1978 World Series|World Series]].
* In Game 6 of the [[1986 World Series]], Boston (leading the series three games to two) took a 5–3 lead in the top of the 10th inning. Red Sox reliever [[Calvin Schiraldi]] retired the first two batters, putting the team within one out (and shortly within one strike) of winning the World Series. However, the [[New York Mets]] scored three runs, tying the game on a wild pitch from [[Bob Stanley (baseball player)|Bob Stanley]] and winning it when Boston first baseman [[Bill Buckner]] allowed a ground ball hit by the Mets' [[Mookie Wilson]] to roll through his legs, scoring [[Ray Knight]] from second base. In the seventh game, the Red Sox took an early 3–0 lead, only to lose, 8–5. The collapses in the last two games prompted [[George Vecsey|Vecsey]]'s articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shaughnessy|1990|p=175}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shaughnessy|2005|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sports of the Times: The World Series '86; Red Sox: 68 Years and Counting |date=October 26, 1986 |first=George |last=Vecsey |newspaper=The New York Times |page=A3 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/26/sports/sports-of-the-times-the-world-series-86-red-sox-68-years-and-counting.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6QYHMjqtI?url=http://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/26/sports/sports-of-the-times-the-world-series-86-red-sox-68-years-and-counting.html |archivedate=June 23, 2014 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=SPORTS OF THE TIMES; Babe Ruth Curse Strikes Again |date=October 28, 1986 |first=George |last=Vecsey |newspaper=The New York Times |page=D33 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/28/sports/sports-of-the-times-babe-ruth-curse-strikes-again.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6QYHcCUiT?url=http://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/28/sports/sports-of-the-times-babe-ruth-curse-strikes-again.html |archivedate=June 23, 2014 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[1988 American League Championship Series|1988]] and [[1990 American League Championship Series|1990]], the Red Sox advanced to the American League Championship Series, only to suffer four-game sweeps both times at the hands of the [[Oakland Athletics]]. They were also swept by the Cleveland Indians in the [[1995 American League Division Series|1995]] AL Division Series in three games (extending their postseason losing streak to a major-league record 13 games), lost again to the Indians in the [[1998 American League Division Series|1998]] ALDS three games to one, and were defeated by the Yankees four games to one in the [[1999 American League Championship Series|1999]] ALCS.&lt;ref name="Frommer-Pages180-182"&gt;{{harvnb|Frommer|Frommer|2004|pp=180–182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boston held a 5–2 lead in the eighth inning, and manager [[Grady Little]] opted to stay with starting pitcher [[Pedro Martínez]] rather than go to the bullpen.&lt;ref name=AaronBoone/&gt; New York rallied against the tired Martínez, scoring three runs on a single and three doubles to tie the game.&lt;ref name=AaronBoone/&gt; In the bottom of the 11th inning, [[Aaron Boone]] launched a solo home run against [[knuckleball]]ing Boston starter [[Tim Wakefield]] (pitching in relief) to win the game and the pennant for the Yankees.&lt;ref name=AaronBoone&gt;{{cite news|title=Heartbreak again Yankees beat Red Sox, 6-5, on 11th-inning homer to capture AL pennant|date=October 17, 2003|first=Dan|last=Shaughnessy|newspaper=Boston Globe|page=A1|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/sports/2003/10/17/heartbreak-again-yankees-beat-red-sox-walkoff/Cu4Bh2GAtUFxyC0yf8CQPO/story.xml|authorlink=Dan Shaughnessy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attempts to break the curse==

Red Sox fans attempted various methods over the years to exorcise their famous curse. These included placing a Boston cap atop [[Mt. Everest]] and burning a Yankees cap at its base camp; hiring professional exorcists and [[Father Guido Sarducci]] to "purify" Fenway Park; spray painting a "Reverse Curve" street sign on [[Storrow Drive]] to change it to say "Reverse the Curse" (the sign was not replaced until just after the 2004 World Series win); and finding a piano owned by Ruth that he had supposedly pushed into a pond near his [[Sudbury, Massachusetts]] farm, [[Home Plate Farm]].{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

In [[Ken Burns]]' 1994 documentary ''[[Baseball (documentary)|Baseball]]'', former Red Sox pitcher [[Bill Lee (left-handed pitcher)|Bill Lee]] suggested that the Red Sox should exhume the body of [[Babe Ruth]], transport it back to Fenway and publicly apologize for trading Ruth to the Yankees.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

Some declared the curse broken during a game on August 31, 2004, when a foul ball hit by [[Manny Ramírez]] flew into Section 9, Box 95, Row AA and struck a boy's face, knocking two of his teeth out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Brian|last=McGrory|title=Taking teeth out of curse?|newspaper=Boston Globe|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2004/09/02/taking_teeth_out_of_curse/?page=full|date=September 2, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; 16-year-old Lee Gavin, a Boston fan whose favorite player was Ramirez, lived on the Sudbury farm owned by Ruth. That same day, the Yankees suffered their worst loss in team history, a 22–0 clobbering at home against the Cleveland Indians.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shaughnessy|2005|p=159}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Slide of the Yankees: Pinstripes Punished|date=September 1, 2004|first=Steve|last=Popper|newspaper=The New York Times|page=D1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Indians 22, Yankees 0|first=Ronald|last=Blum|agency=Associated Press|date=August 31, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some fans also cite a comedy curse-breaking ceremony performed by musician [[Jimmy Buffett]] and his warm-up team (one dressed as Ruth and one dressed as a [[witch doctor]]) at a Fenway concert in September 2004. Just after being traded to the Red Sox, [[Curt Schilling]] appeared in an advertisement for the [[Ford F-150]] pickup truck [[hitchhiking]] with a sign indicating he was going to Boston. When picked up, he said that he had "an 86-year-old curse" to break.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shaughnessy|2005|pp=83–91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==End of the curse==
{{further|2004 Boston Red Sox season|2004 American League Championship Series|2004 World Series}}
In [[2004 Boston Red Sox season|2004]], the Red Sox once again met the Yankees in the [[2004 American League Championship Series|American League Championship Series]]. The Red Sox lost the first three games, including losing Game 3 at [[Fenway Park|Fenway]] by the lopsided score of 19–8.&lt;ref name="19-18"&gt;{{harvnb|Shaughnessy|2005|p=193}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=19-8&gt;{{cite news|last=Shaughnessy|first=Dan|title=Red Sox on brink of elimination as Yanks pound them, 19–8|url=http://articles.boston.com/2004-10-17/news/29196690_1_jason-varitek-fenway-sox-season|newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]]|date=October 17, 2004|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120527222551/http://articles.boston.com/2004-10-17/news/29196690_1_jason-varitek-fenway-sox-season|archivedate=May 27, 2012|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Red Sox then faced the [[2004 St. Louis Cardinals season|St. Louis Cardinals]], the team to whom they had lost in {{wsy|1946}} and {{wsy|1967}}, and led throughout the series, winning in a four-game sweep.&lt;ref name="Sweep"/&gt; Cardinals shortstop [[Édgar Rentería]], who wore the same number as Ruth (3), hit the final out of the game.&lt;ref name="Sweep"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shaughnessy|first=Dan|title=YES!!!

==Antisemitism==
Glenn Stout argues that the idea of a "curse" was indirectly influenced by [[antisemitism]], although that aspect was not part of its modern usage; he even says "This does not mean that ... anyone who writes or speaks of the Curse today -- as a journalist or a fan -- is either anti-Semitic or even remotely aware of the anti-Semitic roots of the Curse."&lt;ref name="Hate"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/print?id=1894516&amp;type=story |title=Curse Born of Hate |date=October 3, 2004 |first=Glenn |last=Stout |publisher=ESPN |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050103041541/http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/print?id=1894516&amp;type=story |archivedate=January 3, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because Frazee was from New York and involved in theatre, it was assumed he was Jewish (he was actually a [[Presbyterian]]). Though Frazee was well respected in Boston, [[Henry Ford]]'s ''[[The Dearborn Independent|Dearborn Independent]]'' ran a series of articles purporting to expose how Jews were "destroying America", and among these were articles lambasting Frazee, saying that with his purchase of the Red Sox "another club was placed under the smothering influences of the 'chosen race.'"&lt;ref name="Hate"/&gt; These articles turned the tide of both baseball owners and public opinion against Frazee, and [[Fred Lieb]]'s vilification of Frazee in his history of the Red Sox portrayed him implicitly as a Jew.&lt;ref name="Hate"/&gt; Stout argues that this hatred indirectly created the atmosphere where the "curse" could be accepted.

==In popular culture==
{{In popular culture|date=December 2017}}
{{unreferenced|section|date=December 2017}}
===Non-fiction works===
*The 2004 Red Sox season was the subject of several non-fiction books, including ''[[Faithful (book)|Faithful: Boston Red Sox Fans Chronicle the Historic 2004 Season]]'', whose authors Stewart O'Nan and [[Stephen King]] decided to write the book before the season began, and ''Reversing the Curse'' by Dan Shaughnessy of ''The Boston Globe''.
* In the fall of 2003, HBO produced a documentary called ''The Curse of the Bambino'', featuring commentary from native Boston celebrities such as [[Denis Leary]], narrated by [[Ben Affleck]]. After the 2004 World Series, the ending of the documentary was re-filmed with a number of the same celebrities and it was retitled ''Reverse of the Curse of the Bambino'', narrated by [[Liev Schreiber]].

===Fiction===
* The British memoir ''[[Fever Pitch]]'', about author [[Nick Hornby]]'s obsession with the [[Arsenal FC]] English [[football (soccer)|soccer]] team, was adapted into an [[Fever Pitch (2005 film)|American film of the same name]] by the [[Farrelly brothers]]. The American adaptation was about an obsessive Red Sox fan. It was made during the 2004 World Series, which forced the filmmakers to rework the story; the Red Sox were not originally supposed to make it to the World Series.
* In the movie ''[[50 First Dates]]'', [[Adam Sandler]]'s character Henry Roth reminds his girlfriend about what happened in [[2003 Boston Red Sox season|2003]] including a screen capture showing the Red Sox winning the World Series, until the next clip shows the title 'just kidding'. The movie was released in February 2004 and, by coincidence, the Red Sox eventually won the World Series later that year.
* On the television show ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'', [[Jack Shephard|Jack]] and his father [[Christian Shephard|Christian]] often use the phrase "That's why the Sox will never win the damn series" to describe fate. In [[Lost (season 3)|season 3]], [[Ben Linus|Ben]] shows the end of the 2004 game to try to convince Jack that the [[Others (Lost)|Others]] have contact with the outside world.
* An episode of the children's TV series ''[[Arthur (TV series)|Arthur]]'' titled "The Curse of the Grebes" has Elwood City's baseball team losing two of its games in the world championship series due to events based directly on Bucky Dent's homer and Bill Buckner's error. The episode states that the team hadn't won a championship in 87 years and that their opponents, the Crown City Kings, had won 25 since then. Johnny Damon, Edgar Renteria, and [[Mike Timlin]] all voice caricatures of themselves. The Kings resembled the Yankees while the Grebes resemble the Red Sox.
* In the movie ''[[Moneyball (film)|Moneyball]]'', [[Brad Pitt]]'s character [[Billy Beane]] talks to the Boston Red Sox' owner about a job as GM after taking the [[2002 Oakland Athletics season|Oakland A's]] to a 20-game winning streak. When the Red Sox' owner asks Billy Beane why he returned his call, he says because he wants to help them end the Curse of the Bambino.

===Music===
* The [[Ben Harper]] song "Get It Like You Like It" includes the lines "But [[Johnny Damon]] swung his bat. Grand Slam. That was that. An 86-year curse is gone."
* [[James Taylor]] "Angels of Fenway" (Album - ''[[Before This World]]'') released June 15, 2015. Taylor sings "86 summers gone by. Bambino put a hex on the Bean. We were living on a tear and a sigh. In the shadow of the Bronx machine..."

===Other===
* At [[WrestleMania XIV]] in 1998, guest ring announcer [[Pete Rose]] taunted the Boston crowd about the curse (Rose was on the [[1975 Cincinnati Reds season|Cincinnati Reds]] team that beat Boston in the [[1975 World Series]]) before he was tombstoned by [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]].
* After New York's defeat, the Curse was poked fun at during the [[Weekend Update (sketch)|''Weekend Update'']] segment of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', when the ghost of Babe Ruth explains that he left during Game Four with the ghosts of [[Mickey Mantle]] and [[Rodney Dangerfield]] to go drinking.

===Video games===
* In the ''[[Fallout (series)|Fallout]]'' universe, one of the events in the Timeline Divergence is that the "curse" was never broken and the Boston Red Sox never won the World Series, even up to 2077. Newspaper articles in ''[[Fallout 4]]'' show that the Red Sox were up 3-0 against [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas]] in 2077; Game 4 was scheduled for the day the nuclear bombs would fall.

The '''''Defensor minor''''' is a work by [[Marsilius of Padua]] written around 1342. The Defensor minor is a restatement and defense of Marsilius's best known work, the ''[[Defensor pacis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Nederman, Cary J. [http://www.cambridge.org/us/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=0521408466 Marsiglio of Padua: 'Defensor minor' and 'De translatione imperii']&lt;/ref&gt; 

The text discusses civil and [[ecclesiastical]] jurisdiction, the [[Confession (religion)|confession]], [[penance]], [[indulgence]]s, the [[Crusades]], [[pilgrimage]]s, [[plenitudo potestatis]], legislative power, the origin of the sovereignty, [[wedding]], and [[divorce]].

==Civil jurisdiction==
With regard to jurisdiction, Marsilius distinguishes between divine and human laws, the first event which is independent of any human will and on the conduct of man in view of the afterlife, the second which determines the will of the people, endowed with coercive power and not modifiable by any clergyman.

This applies also to the Pope that even with his decrees may waive the law, manifestation of the people's sovereignty. While the beneficiaries of the two laws are identical, its object and purpose are different. The one seeks the good of the soul and the other cares for earthly well-being, with the result that the church is denied the power to make laws, even in the persistent silence of human legislation. The same applies to amendments and changes, which should remain solely with the people. The only thing that is relevant to the clergy is the non-legal rules that affect morality and resolve themselves into simple counsels and take effect with counsellors.

==The clergy==
The task and the main function of the clergy is to teach the sacred texts and preparing souls for the afterlife. The Church has repeatedly stated that for the sinner there is no other system of redemption from sin but confession. Marsilius, in an effort to bring man to God, regardless of any broker, says that confession should be done directly to God and that salvation comes only by true repentance. This anticipates what will be one of the tenets of Protestantism. The necessity of this Sacrament, that is only recommended and not required, is not detected from the Holy Scriptures. Only sincere repentance to the outside of any denominational gives you that peace in the soul that is the prelude of eternal salvation.  Absolution from sin belongs only to God and the priest, who may do so, does so only within the Church. ''Sufficit soli Deo confiteri peccata ipsa, videlicet recognoscendo, et de ipsis poenitendo cum proposito talia alterius non committendi.'' 
These words can be regarded as harbingers of what will be the principles of the Lutheran Reformation.

''Sufficit sola contritio et vera poenitentia de commisso absque omni confessione facta vel fienda sacerdoti, ut immediate absolvatur per Deum.'' Marsilio does not exclude absolutely confession: he says only that it is useful but not essential,  which it would be if it were a precept, therefore  he also denies the priestly power to inflict penalties.
Only contrition frees from sin not repentance of any material or spiritual character almost like a compensation for the sin.''Quamvis in hoc saeculo nullam realem aut personalem satisfactionem exhibeat pro peccatis.''

The term '''exorbitant privilege''' refers to the benefit the [[United States]] has due to its own currency (i.e., the [[United States dollar|US dollar]]) being the international [[reserve currency]]. Accordingly, the US would not face a [[balance of payments crisis]], because it purchased imports in its own currency. Exorbitant privilege as a concept cannot refer to currencies that have a regional reserve currency role, only global reserve currencies.{{clarify|date=July 2012}}

Academically, the exorbitant privilege literature analyzes two empiric puzzles, the position and the income puzzle. The position puzzle consists of the difference between the (negative) U.S. [[net international investment position]] (NIIP) and the accumulated U.S. current account deficits, the former being much smaller than the latter. The income puzzle consists of the fact that despite a deeply negative NIIP, the U.S. income balance is positive, i.e. despite having much more liabilities than assets, earned income is higher than interest expenses.&lt;ref&gt;Curcuru, S. E., Thomas, C. P., &amp; Warnock, F. E. (2013). On Return Differentials. ''International Finance Discussion Papers'', 1077, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
The term was coined in the 1960s by [[Valéry Giscard d'Estaing]], then the French [[Minister of Finance (France)|Minister of Finance]].&lt;ref name="books.google.fr"&gt;Barry Eichengreen, ''Exorbitant Privilege: The Rise and Fall of the Dollar and the Future of the International monetary system''[https://books.google.com/books?id=TIlpAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA4]&lt;/ref&gt; It is frequently mis-attributed to [[Charles de Gaulle]], who is said to have had similar views.

==Opposition in France==
In the [[Bretton Woods system]] put in place in 1944, U.S. dollars were convertible to gold. In France, it was called "America's exorbitant privilege"&lt;ref name="books.google.fr"/&gt; as it resulted in an "asymmetric financial system" where foreigners "see themselves supporting American living standards and subsidizing American multinationals". As American economist [[Barry Eichengreen]] summarized: "It costs only a few cents for the Bureau of Engraving and Printing to produce a $100 bill, but other countries had to pony up $100 of actual goods in order to obtain one."&lt;ref name="books.google.fr"/&gt; In February 1965 President Charles de Gaulle announced his intention to exchange its U.S. dollar reserves for gold at the official exchange rate. He sent the French Navy across the Atlantic to pick up the French reserve of gold and was followed by several countries. As it resulted in considerably reducing U.S. gold stock and U.S. economic influence, it led U.S. President [[Richard Nixon]] to end unilaterally the convertibility of the dollar to gold on August 15, 1971 (the "[[Nixon Shock]]"). This was meant to be a temporary measure but the dollar became permanently a floating [[fiat money]] and in October 1976, the U.S. government officially changed the definition of the dollar; references to gold were removed from statutes.&lt;ref&gt;Eugène White, Dominique Simard, Michael Bordo, ''La France et le système monétaire de Bretton Woods '' [http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/ecofi_0987-3368_1993_num_26_3_2015]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Garritsen de Vries, ''The International Monetary Fund, 1966–1971'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=5oUS9M1kzOEC&amp;pg=PA61]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Different attempts have been made across time to assess the validity of the exorbitant privilege hypothesis by estimating whether a statistically significant difference between the return on U.S. assets and liabilities exists. These endeavors encountered a major empirical problem in the unavailability of long time series on capital gains, which are required due to capital gains' volatility. In response to this issue, two approaches have developed: (1) the construction of long time series based on historical assumptions and (2) the focus on specific categories for which high-quality data exists.

In the academic literature, three waves of research trying to assess the existence of exorbitant privilege are distinguished by Curcuru et al. (2013). The first wave occurred during the pre-crisis [[Great Moderation]]&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Obstfeld &amp; Rogoff (2005), Lane &amp; Milesi-Ferretti (2005), Meissner &amp; Taylor (2006), and Gourinchas &amp; Rey (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; and found, following the first research approach, significant annual return differentials favoring U.S. claims in a range between 2.7% and 3.7%, with Gourinchas and Rey (2007a) and Lane and Milesi-Ferretti (2005) finding particularly large differences for returns on both equity and debt assets. The first wave method consists of estimating capital gains by calculating the difference between the annual change in the U.S. international position and U.S. net capital outflows. The residual change not explained by capital flows is assumed to correspond to the capital gain.

The second wave of research on the returns differentials literature, written during pre-crisis times and published during the [[Financial crisis of 2007–08|crisis]], emerged due to criticism of how the data was handled.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Lane &amp; Milesi-Ferretti (2009), Curcuru, Dvorak &amp; Warnock (2008), Curcuru, Thomas &amp; Warnock (2009), and Gourinchas &amp; Rey (2007b).&lt;/ref&gt; This criticism alleged inconsistencies in data revisions between stocks and flows, which were then (mis-)attributed to "Other changes". Consequently, it was argued that this estimation approach would not calculate capital gains, but rather the sum of capital gains and other changes. Another problem is the extent of gains in the FDI category, wherein data is estimated. The second wave addresses these issues and finds substantially smaller differentials, ranging from -0.7% to 0.6%, using the second research approach.

The recent availability of new data finally spawned the third wave of research on returns differentials.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Forbes (2010), Habib (2010), Gourinchas, Rey &amp; Govillot (2010), and Gohrband &amp; Howell (2010).&lt;/ref&gt; This literature found comparatively high return differentials ranging up to 6.9% (Forbes (2010)) and attributed the difference more to differentials in capital gains than in yields (Habib (2010)). These findings have however since then come under criticism by Curcuru et al. (2013) who criticize Forbes (2010) for her focus on a sample situated in a period of solely dollar depreciation and Habib (2010) for using a first wave methodology. Revised estimates for Forbes (2010) accounting for the exchange rate effect find a difference of 4.6%, especially in FDI. More recent research by Curcuru et al. (2013) and Gohrband and Howell (forthcoming) estimates overall return differentials of 1.9% and 1.7%, respectively.

==Negative influences of being a reserve currency==

There are also negatives of being a reserve currency. Mainly, that it leads to a higher exchange rate, thereby reducing the competitiveness of export-reliant businesses abroad.

==Trivia==
The phrase became the title of a 2010 book by economist [[Barry Eichengreen]], examining the future prospects for the US dollar's dominance in international trade.&lt;ref&gt;''Exorbitant privilege: The Rise and Fall of the Dollar and the Future of the International Monetary System'' http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Economics/International/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780199753789&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''fibula''' (/ˈfɪbjʊlə/, plural '''fibulae''' /ˈfɪbjʊli/) is a brooch or pin for fastening garments. The fibula developed in a variety of shapes, but all were based on the [[safety-pin]] principle.  Technically, the Latin term, [[wikt:fibula#Latin|fibulae]], refers to [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] brooches; however, the term is widely used to refer to brooches from the entire [[ancient]] and [[early medieval]] world that continue Roman forms. Nevertheless, its use in English is more restricted than in other languages, and in particular post-Roman brooches from the [[British Isles]] are just called brooches (for example, the [[penannular brooch]]es), where in German they would probably be ''fibulae''.

[[File:Bronze_cloak_pin_ca._2200_BC.jpg|thumb|upright|A cloak pin]]
Unlike most modern brooches, fibulae were not only decorative; they originally served a practical function: to fasten [[clothes|clothing]], such as [[cloak]]s. Fibulae replaced straight [[pin]]s that were used to fasten clothing in the [[Neolithic]] period and the [[Bronze Age]]. In turn, fibulae were replaced as clothing fasteners by [[button]]s in the Middle Ages. Their descendant, the modern safety pin, remains in use today. In [[ancient Rome]] and other places where Latin was used, the same word denoted both a brooch and the [[fibula|fibula bone]] because a popular form for brooches and the shape of the bone were thought to resemble one another.

There are hundreds of different types of fibulae. They are usually divided into families that are based upon historical periods, geography, and/or cultures. Fibulae are also divided into classes that are based upon their general forms.

Lost fibulae, usually fragments, are frequently dug up by amateur coin and relic hunters using [[metal detector]]s.

== Construction ==

Most fibulae are made of [[bronze]] (more properly "[[copper]] [[alloy]]") or [[iron]], or both. Some fibulae are made of [[precious metal]]s such as [[silver]] or [[gold]]. Most fibulae are made of only one or two pieces. Many fibulae are decorated with [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]], [[semi-precious stone]]s, [[glass]], [[Coral (precious)|coral]] or [[bone]].

== Components ==
[[File:Silver fibula (brooch) from Værløse, Zealand, Denmark (DR EM85;123).jpg|thumb|Detail of the [[Elder Futhark]] [[Runic alphabet|runic]] inscription on the pinholder of the 3rd-century AD [[Værløse Fibula]] followed by a [[swastika]].]]
Fibulae were composed of four components: The body, pin, spring, and hinge.

===Body===
The body of a fibula is known as either the bow or the plate, depending on the basic form. A bow is generally long and narrow, and often arched. A plate is flat and wide. Plates could be solid or openwork. The body was often decorated. The head is the end of the fibula with the [[Spring (device)|spring]] or [[hinge]]. The foot is the end of the fibula where the pin closes. Depending on the type of fibula, and the [[culture]] in question, the head of the fibula could be worn facing up, down or sideways.

===Pin===
The pin that is used to fasten the [[clothing]] is either a continuation of the fibula's body or a separate piece attached to the body. The fibula is closed by connecting the end of the pin to a catch plate, or pin rest.

===Spring===
The body and pin meet at either a spring or [[hinge]]. The earliest design is the spring which provides tension to the pin. The spring could be unilateral or bilateral. A unilateral spring winds around in one direction only. Unilateral springs are the earliest type, first appearing around the 14th century BC. Bilateral springs wind in one or more loops on one side of the pin and then cross over or under the bow and continue with more loops on the other side. They appeared around the 6th century BC. Bilateral springs can be very short, with only one or two revolutions per side, or up to 10&amp;nbsp;cm long. Most bilateral springs are made of one piece of metal and therefore have a spring cord, a piece of wire extending from one end of the spring to the other. The spring cord can pass in front of or behind the fibulae body. Bilateral springs wrap around a pin or axle. These are usually made of iron even if the rest of the fibula and spring is copper alloy. In the 1st century AD some fibulae had springs that were concealed under a metal cover that was an extension of the fibula body. These are known as covered springs, or hidden springs.

===Hinge===
In the late 1st century BC or early 1st century AD a new design appeared in some bow type fibulae. A separate pin was attached to the head-end of the bow with a small hinge. In the second half of the 1st century AD, hinges were introduced to plate type fibulae. One or two small plaques were cast on the back of the plate and a pin was attached to them by a small hinge. Previously, plate type fibulae had bilateral springs attached to the back. In the 3rd century AD, the hinge was placed in the centre of a long transverse bar creating the famous [[crossbow]] fibula design. A few fibulae from a much earlier date also had hinges, although this design feature was very rare and soon died out for nearly five centuries. For example, the [[Asia Minor]] Decorated Arc Fibula (Blinkenberg Type XII Variation 16) dating to the 5th century BC.

It is important to note that different types of fibula construction were used contemporaneously. Though the introduction of the hinge was later than the introduction of the spring, the spring remained in use long after the hinge was introduced. Therefore, a given fibula with hinge is not necessarily more recent than one with a spring.

== Use ==

Fibulae were originally used to fasten [[clothing]]. They represent an improvement on the earlier straight [[pin]] which was less secure and could fall out. While the head of the earlier straight pin was often decorated, the bow or plate of the fibula provided a much increased scope for decoration. Among some [[culture]]s, different fibula designs had specific [[symbolic meaning]]s. They could refer to a status or profession such as single woman, married woman, man, warrior, or chief. Some Roman-era fibulae may symbolize specific ranks or positions in the [[Roman legion]]s or auxiliary. In some cultures, fibulae were worn in pairs and could be linked by a length of chain. The Romans also used [[fibula (penile)|fibulas to fasten the foreskin]] above the penis, thus hiding the glans, this was done both to show modesty and in the belief that it helped preserve the voice.

== Historical development ==

=== Bronze Age fibulae ===
[[File:Fibulae01.JPG|right|thumb|Early fibulae.&lt;br /&gt;10th – 8th centuries BC]]

'''The first fibulae design''', violin bow fibulae (''drahtbugel'' in German), appeared in the [[late Bronze Age]]. This simple design, with a unilateral spring, looks remarkably like a modern [[safety pin]]. The violin bow fibula has a low flat arch; the body runs parallel to the pin so it resembles a [[violin]] bow. The bow could be round, square, or flat and ribbon-like in cross-section. Some had simple punched or incised decoration on the bow. Violin bow fibula, such as the Peschiera type and the Unter-Radl type, was introduced in the 14th century BC (Late Mycenean III era) by the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenean]]s on the Greek [[Peloponnesus]]. The fibula soon spread to [[Crete]], [[Cyprus]] and [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenean]] trading posts in [[Sicily]].

There were several variants of the violin bow fibula. The bow could bend, or [[zig-zag]] from side to side while still remaining flat and parallel to the pin. These variants, such as the Grunwald type and the Hanua type, were found in the 12th and 11th centuries BC. In another variant, the bow, while still flat, widened out into an oval or diamond shape (blattbugel in German). These variants, such as the Kreuznach type and Reisen type, were found in the 12th to 10th centuries BC.
[[File:Violin bow fibula .jpg|thumb|10th century BC]]

'''The second major design''' of fibulae has a high, rounded [[arch]] (''bogen'' in German) instead of the low flat arch of the violin bow fibula. At first, the bow was thin. In later variants the bow was made of thicker metal or of two pieces of thin [[wire]] twisted together. These rounded bow fibulae were first found in the 12th century BC, but lasted in use in some places for more than five centuries.
[[File:Fibulae02.JPG|right|thumb|Early bow fibulae.&lt;br /&gt;8th – 6th centuries BC]]

'''The third Bronze Age design''' of fibula consisted of horizontal wire [[spiral]]s. The spectacle fibula (brillen in German) consisted of two spirals joined together. It resembles a pair of [[spectacles]] or eye [[glasses]]. These fibulae, such as the Haslau type and the St. Lucija type, were found in the 9th to 7th centuries BC. Some spectacle fibula were very large with spirals up to 10&amp;nbsp;cm across. A variant that appeared in the 6th century BC had four small spirals with a square, or squarish, cover plate on the middle, the Vierpass type.

The [[Villanovan culture]] in [[Italy]] introduced a series of variations of the bow fibula in the 8th and 7th centuries BC. In these so-called Italianate fibulae, the bow begins, at the head, with a semi-circular form, but bends at its apex to angle straight down to the foot that was often lengthened and extended. The bow was often decorated with moulded knobs or spikes. The rear half of the bow was sometimes bent into a wavy, kinked shape. The latter variants were known as [[serpentine shape|serpentine]] fibulae.

Meanwhile, the 8th and 7th centuries BC saw the introduction of the so-called [[Phrygia]]n bow fibulae in [[Asia Minor]]. These fibulae had a near-perfect semi-circular arch sometimes decorated with knobs or round flanges. In the same period, the Hand or Arm fibula spread from [[Cyprus]], where it appears to have originated, to [[Syria]], [[Assyria]] and [[Persia]]. In this design the bow was bent 90 degrees at the apex giving the fibula a [[triangular]] shape when viewed from the side. The bow was usually decorated with a series of rings and dots. The catch plate usually had the form of a hand, making the entire fibula resemble an arm.

In the 7th and 6th centuries BC, a series of variations of the bow fibula appeared in the southern [[Balkans]], known variously as [[Greece|Greek]], [[Ancient Macedonians|Macedonian]], or [[Thracian]] bow fibulae. The high arched bow of these fibulae had large fins or knobs. The bow usually ended in a very large triangular or square catch plate. Some of the large square catch plates were decorated with complex incised [[geometric]] or figural designs. Some of the fibula had a flat back indicating that they were likely cast in simple, open [[mould]]s.

=== Iron Age fibulae ===

The [[Iron Age]] saw an expansion in the use of fibulae. The rounded bow fibula underwent several variations and were usually highly decorated with incised or moulded [[geometric]] designs. In one variation, the foot of the fibula that had previously terminated at the end of the arch with a simple catch plate, lengthened significantly. These extended foot fibulae, such as the Kahn type and the Pauken type, were found in the 7th to 5th centuries BC. The first long, bilateral springs appeared on some of these variants in the [[Hallstatt]] D2 era (5th century BC). These fibulae, such as the Doublezier type, looked similar to the Roman-era [[crossbow]] fibulae but were not the latter’s direct precursor.

[[File:Fibulae03.JPG|right|thumb|More early fibulae.&lt;br /&gt;7th – 5th centuries BC]]
[[File:Dacian fibulae Cluj Musem 1st century BC.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Typical silver Dacian fibulae 1st century BC (Museum of Transylvania Cluj Romania]]

In another variation of the rounded bow fibula, the bow became fat and swollen-looking. In many of these [[Leech]] Bow, or Sanguisaga, fibulae the catch plate became large and triangular. Another variant, the Certossa type, had a small square or ribbon cross-section bow and a short bilateral spring (possibly the first use of a bilateral spring). Certossa fibulae are almost always very small.

In the [[La Tene]] I, or La Tene A to B2, era (4th to 3rd centuries BC), fibula design became relatively standardised over a large geographic area, although minor stylistic variations and differences in decoration remained. The La Tene I fibula usually had a narrow bow. The spring that could be either unilateral or bilateral, was wound in a fairly large diameter circle. The foot was turned up and usually ended in a decorated knob or with an applied [[bead]] or stone. In some cases the raised foot was bent back towards the bow, although it did not touch the bow. The Thraco-Getic fibula is a variant found in the eastern [[Balkans]] and used by the [[Getae]]. The fibula's foot is vertical and ends in a small knob, though later models had a sinuous, s-shaped profile.

[[File:La Tene, Thraco-Getic and Nauheim Fibulae.jpg|right|thumb|La Tene era fibulae.&lt;br /&gt;4th – 1st centuries BC]]

The La Tene I era also saw the introduction of the first animal, or [[zoomorphic]], designs. These included [[birds]] and [[horse]]s and could either be flat, with a short bilateral spring on the back, or [[dimension|three-dimensional]] ("in the round") with a long bilateral spring at the head.

In the La Tene II, or La Tene C era (2nd century BC), the foot of the fibula actually bent back to touch the bow and was wrapped around it. Many La Tene II fibulae had long bilateral springs. It is important to be aware that this type of construction was in use several centuries later in the tied-foot and returned-foot types of fibulae. These latter types are sometimes known as pseudo-La Tene fibulae.

In the La Tene III, or La Tene D era (1st century BC), the raised foot was no longer wrapped around the bow but was attached directly to it by [[casting]] or [[welding]] creating a loop above the foot. In one variant, the Nauheim type, the bow widened into a flat triangle or diamond. In another variant, the Schussel type, the ribbon-like bow widened at the head into a rounded [[arrowhead]] shape that covered the spring.

===Roman-era fibulae===

====The 1st century AD====

File:Fibulae08.JPG|Kraftig Profilierte fibulae.&lt;br /&gt;1st – 2nd centuries AD
&lt;/gallery&gt;

The rapid spread of the [[Roman Empire]] by the 1st century AD resulted in a tremendous growth in the number and design of fibulae throughout [[Europe]] and the [[Near East]]. The spread of technologically advanced workshops in the Roman Empire led to more complex fibula designs. Bows were cast in more complex forms, hinges appeared alongside bilateral springs and a wide variety of plate designs were introduced.

One of the first fibula designs of the Roman-era began in the [[La Tene]] III era, in the late 1st century BC. The Straight Wire fibula, also known as the Soldier’s type or [[Roman legion|Legionnaire]]'s type, is a very plain design. It resembles the violin bow fibula of over one thousand years earlier except that the bow has slightly more of an arch and the spring in (short) bilateral not unilateral. The Straight Wire fibula is found through the 1st century AD.

In the 1st century AD, for the first time, several fibula designs originated in [[Roman Britain]]. Perhaps the most distinctive British fibula design was the Dolphin. This was actually a series of designs including the Polden Hill type, the Langton Down type, the Colchester type and the T-Shaped type. Dolphin fibulae have a smooth arched bow that tapers from the head to end in a long point. The long bilateral spring is covered. From the top the Dolphin fibula looks like a T or the late-Roman [[crossbow]] fibula. From the side it resembles a leaping [[dolphin]].

[[File:Fibulae09.JPG|150px|thumb|Roman era plate fibulae.&lt;br /&gt;1st century AD]]
Another British design was the Hod Hill type. Usually quite small, Hod Hill fibulae have a shallow arched bow that appears to be made up of lumpy segments. Many Hod Hill fibulae have a pair of small side [[lug (knob)|lug]]s.

The Fantail fibula, which have a short bow that flares into a flat, wide fan-shaped foot, were common in Britain and on the European continent. The Fantail design lasted into the 2nd century AD. A common and widespread design was the Augen (or Eye) fibula, which has a longer bow and a long, flat, wide foot. It has a short bilateral spring. Many Augen fibulae are decorated with a pair of ringed dots, or eyes, on the flat foot. Augen fibulae appear to have been introduced to the [[Roman Empire]] by [[Germanic peoples]], notably [[Marcomanni]], serving as [[Roman auxiliaries]].

The Aucissa fibula was another widespread design. It has a high semi-circular arched bow that extended into a short foot. The bow is flat and wide and has a rounded central ridge. The bow ends, at the head, in a hinge. The Aucissa was one of the first fibulae to use a hinge instead of a spring. The foot ends in a rounded knob. Many Aucissa fibulae have the word “AVCISSA” moulded above the hinge. This is thought to be the name of a [[workshop]].

The 1st century AD saw several other bow variations. The Wolf or Wolf’s Head fibula has a flat, ribbon-like bow that widens into a square section at the head. The common design of two circles and a [[Chevron (insignia)|chevron]] near the rear of the bow is often interpreted as a [[wolf]]’s head. The [[Thracian]] Anchor type has a wide [[crescent]] at the head giving the fibula an [[anchor]] shape. The Thracian Anchor type is also called the Illyrian and is found in [[Pannonia]] ([[Hungary]]), [[Dacia]] ([[Romania]]) and [[Serbia]].

The late 1st century AD saw the introduction of the Kraftig Profilierte group of fibula designs. Kraftig Profilierte fibulae have a wide fan-, or [[bell (instrument)|bell]]-shaped head and a long thin pointy foot. They have long bilateral hinges. There are three main variations of the Kraftig Profilierte fibula. The North Pannonian Double Knot type, found in [[Pannonia]] has two knobs, or knots, on the bow. The Single Knot type, found in the central [[Balkans]], has a single knob. The Black Sea type, found in the [[steppes]] north of the [[Black Sea]], has a thin body, with no flaring near the head, and two knots. Kraftig Profilierte fibulae were found in the late 1st to late 2nd centuries AD and are mostly associated with the [[Przeworsk]] proto-[[Goths|Gothic]] culture.

The 1st century AD saw the widespread use of plate fibulae. Plate fibulae consist of a flat plate. Since there is little space between the fibula body and the pin (there is no arch to the body), plate fibulae could not be used to fasten much material and were therefore mainly [[decorative]]. Most plate fibulae have a hinge assembly on the back. Plate fibulae are generally associated with women’s [[Grave (burial)|grave]]s. The most common forms of plate fibula in the 1st century AD were round (disc), diamond, oval and lunula ([[crescent]]- or moon-shaped).

==== The 2nd century AD ====

&lt;/gallery&gt;

In [[Roman Britain]] the fibula designs common in the 1st century AD continued to some extent into the second, although usually in more complex variations. A new design, the Head Stud type, has a long bow with a [[wikt:stud#Etymology 2|stud]], or occasionally a ring, at the head.

The Knee fibula, a common design in the 2nd century AD, originated in Roman [[Pannonia]] (modern [[Hungary]]). With its short, fat bow that incorporates a 90 degree bend, [[archeologists]] thought it resembled a [[knee]] and leg. Many Knee fibulae have small rectangular, or larger semi-circular head plates. Knee fibulae appear, like the Augen type, to have been introduced into the [[Roman Empire]] by [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] allies. Despite their small size, their appearance in [[Roman military]] graves implies that the Knee fibula was the most popular fibula among Roman soldiers in the 2nd century AD. They are rarely found outside military sites or contexts.

The Pannonian Trumpet fibula has a wide flaring head like the bell of a [[trumpet]]. However, unlike a straight trumpet, the Pannonian Trumpet fibula is sharply bent near the head. This [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] design was found in and around [[Pannonia]] but was exported as widely as [[Roman Britain|Britain]].

The P-Shaped type is another common 2nd-century AD fibula design that originated among the [[Germanic peoples]]. The P-Shaped fibula, or Almgren Type 162, has a semi-circular arch and a long foot that curves back under itself to return to the base of the arch. They have bilateral springs. The bows of P-Shaped fibulae are usually semi-circular in cross-section and are decorated with ribs. P-Shaped fibulae were found from the 2nd to the early 4th centuries.

There were other bow fibula variations of the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD. The Divided Bow type has an arched bow and a long foot. The arch was made up of two, or even three, separate, but parallel, arches. These arches are either wide and flat or narrow and tall. The Trident fibula has a rounded arch and long foot and a wide, flat head plate with three points. The entire fibula looks like a [[trident]]. Claims that this was the standard fibula of the [[Roman navy]] are unfounded.

The use of plate fibulae continued in the 2nd century CE. Simple flat shapes were replaced with [[vitreous enamel|enamelled]] versions or more complex shapes. These included animal ([[zoomorphic]]) shapes ([[birds]], [[horses]], [[rabbits]], flies, etc.), letters or words, abstract [[symmetrical]] or [[asymmetrical]] designs (including the so-called [[Celt]]ic Trumpet designs), and [[skeuomorphic]] designs ([[symbol]]ic designs). Most designs continued in use throughout the 2nd and 3rd centuries. In one later variation during this time, the Tutulus type, the circular disc plate was extended upwards to form a [[cone]].

====The 3rd to 4th centuries AD====

The use of [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]]led [[inlay]] continued until the end of the 3rd century AD.

[[File:Fibulae13.JPG|right|thumb|P-shaped fibulae.&lt;br /&gt;3rd – 5th centuries AD]]

A variation of the P-shaped fibula, the tied foot fibula has a foot that returns to the bow but then wraps, or ties, around the bow. Many Tied Foot fibulae have long bilateral springs. The tied foot fibula was found in the 3rd and 4th centuries AD and is associated with the [[Wielbark Culture|Wielbark]] [[Goths|Gothic]] culture.

The classic fibula of the late-Roman era, and in fact the best known of all fibula types, is the [[crossbow]] type. The crossbow fibula consists of a highly arched semi-circular bow, usually of squarish cross-section, and a long flat foot. The fibula has a wide transverse bar (or arms) at the head containing the pin-hinge. Crossbow fibulae usually have three round or onion-shaped knobs: one at the head and one at each end of the transverse bar.

[[File:Fibulae15.JPG|left|thumb|Crossbow fibulae.&lt;br /&gt;3rd – 5th centuries AD]]

The first crossbow fibulae, from the early 3rd century AD, has short, thin arms, no knobs, a long bow and a short foot. The later crossbow fibulae have been divided into groups by several [[archeologist]]s including Keller, Prottel and Soupault. Type I, dating to the 3rd and 4th centuries, has small, simple knobs and a foot that is shorter than the bow. Type II, dating to the 4th century, has larger knobs and a foot that is approximately the same length as the bow. Type III, also dating to the 4th century, has a foot that is longer than the bow. There are several variants of the Type III based on the decoration of the foot: dotted circles, [[Chevron (insignia)|chevron]]s, or [[curlicue]]s. Another variant, dating to the 4th and 5th centuries, the Bugelkopf type, has no transverse bar, or arms at all but retains the round knob at the head.

=== Post-Roman fibulae ===

[[File:Fibulae16.JPG|right|thumb|Post-Roman fibulae.&lt;br /&gt;5th – 10th centuries AD]]
[[File:Brooches.JPG|left|thumb|High status Frankish brooches in the [[British Museum]], France 5th Century AD]]
There are numerous types of post-Roman fibulae. The so-called [[Goths|Gothic]] group of bow fibulae have a round or triangular flat head plate, often with 3, 5 or 7 knobs, a small arched bow and a long flat diamond shaped foot. They were widely used by the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] [[Visigoths]], [[Ostrogoths]], and [[Gepids]], and the non-Germanic [[Slavs]] and [[Avars (Carpathians)|Avars]], and are found over a wide part of southern and western Europe in the 5th and 6th centuries AD. There are also a wide variety of [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] fibulae from the 5th to 7th century such as the equal-arm type and the small-long type. Most [[Viking]] fibulae are variations on the ring or annular design (see below).

=== Ring fibulae and penannular brooches ===
[[File:Ireland 2010 etc 029 (2).jpg|thumb|left|The pseudo-penannular  [[Tara Brooch]], the most ornate of Irish brooches, also decorated on the back (see article). Early 8th century.]]
{{main article|Penannular brooch}}

The ring, or annular, fibula or brooch is extremely hard to date as the design for utilitarian pieces was almost unchanged from the 2nd to the 14th centuries AD. If there is decoration, this is likely to indicate whether a given ring fibula is Roman-era fibula or a  medieval brooch.

The [[penannular brooch]], with an incomplete ring and two terminals, originally a common utilitarian clothes fastening, normally of [[base metal]], in Iron Age and [[Roman Britain]] developed in the post-Roman period into highly elaborate and decorative marks of status in Ireland and Scotland, made in precious metals and often decorated with gems, and worn by men and women, as well as the clergy as part of their [[vestment]]s when conducting services.  The finest period is from the 8th and 9th centuries, before the Vikings disrupted the societies.  Ornate Irish examples in the period are usually "pseudo-penannular"; in fact closed rings, but imitating the penannular form.  Examples like the [[Tara Brooch]] are among the most spectacular pieces of jewellery of the Early Medieval period. When the Vikings began to raid and settle the British Isles, they took to wearing these brooches, but now in plain silver.  The thistle and bossed types were the most popular styles, both developing out of earlier Celtic styles.  The post-Roman types are not called "fibulae" in English, though they are in other languages.

=== Medieval brooches ===
[[File:Bulesølje med Hellig Olaf.JPG|thumb| Brooch of gilded silver featuring  Saint Olav in the center with an ax in his left hand.  ([[National Museum of Denmark]] in Copenhagen)]] 
There is a huge variety of [[medieval]] brooch types (the term fibula is rarely used for medieval items). The two most common are ring brooches, including square and lobed or flower designs as well as round ones, and flat plate brooches, or [[badge]]s, in the form of people or animals, with specialized types such as [[pilgrim badge]]s or [[livery badge]]s, which were often produced in large quantities in cheap metals such as lead, but also in very expensive forms such as the [[Dunstable Swan Jewel]].  However these are mostly purely decorative, or worn to denote something about the wearer, and were probably not much used for fastening.

In [[photography]] and [[graphic arts]] a '''flopped image''' is a technical term for a static or moving image that is generated by a mirror-reversal of an original image across a vertical axis.  This is opposed to a ''[[flipped image]]'', which means an image reversed across a horizontal axis.  ''Flopping'' can be used to improve the subjective [[aesthetic]] appeal of the image in question.

== Use in advertising ==
There are two main uses in advertising, one practical, and one subjective.  On a practical level, images of cars are often flopped to ensure cars look appropriate for left-hand-drive or right-hand-drive markets. This allows the results of a single production shoot to be used across markets, allowing a cost saving. On a subjective level, the direction in which a person is looking or a car appears to be travelling may be regarded as important. When placing a picture on a page of text, it is usual for depictions of people to face into the text, rather than off the page; thus, when compositing a page, a picture may be flopped so it may be placed either side of a column of text.

== Use in art ==
Cultural considerations come into play&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; a picture of a person eating with their left hand may be flopped for publication in a Muslim publication, due to the strong taboo against eating with the left hand in Muslim society. Similarly, [[Vincent van Gogh]] took the trouble to etch some of his originals in mirror-reversed form so that when printed, people in the image would appear, correctly, as right-handed.

An example of ''flopping'' is the use of [[Joseph Southall|Joseph Edward Southall's]] painting ''Fishermen and Boat'' as part of the art associated with [[Kate Bush]]'s album [[Aerial (album)|Aerial]].  The picture is flopped, and the name "AERIAL" added to the boat.

== Image flipping ==
[[Image:Billykid.jpg|right|thumb|160px|Billy the Kid. ''(Flopped [[tintype]] photo)'']]
A common movie [[blooper]] is a flopped image, usually and erroneously called "[[flipped image]]s". Flopped images are common because they can be used to correct continuity errors between shots and are hard to see without extensive examination, whereas flipped images are very obvious. Examples of these can be found on several movie blooper sites.

One of the most famous flopped images is this picture of [[Billy the Kid]] carrying a [[Winchester Rifle|Model 1873 Winchester]] rifle and a pistol belt with the pistol on his left. This led people to believe he was left-handed, but it was later revealed to be a flopped image due to the cartridge loading gate on the rifle being on the wrong side.&lt;ref&gt;The loading gate on a Model 1873 Winchester lever action rifle is on the right side of the receiver.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Great Manson Farm''' is a property on the northern outskirts of [[Monmouth]], [[Monmouthshire]], [[Wales]], in the [[Buckholt, Monmouthshire|Buckholt]] area. It is in the Manson Lane neighbourhood, within the electoral division of Dixton with Osbaston. During the course of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, members of the Clarke, Goode, Clark, Dampier, and Morgan families resided at Great Manson Farm, at which time the reported size of the farm varied from 170 to 200 acres. The property is remarkable for the presence of three [[grade II listed]] buildings, including a barn with medieval origins.

However, the large barn was initially a stone structure from the late medieval period, circa 1450. While a hall and a passage from the medieval period still exist, the associated windows did not survive. In the hall, the post-medieval, circa 1600 ceiling and large fireplace with a stone [[lintel (architecture)|lintel]] are still present. The stonework of the fireplace was modified in the eighteenth century. In the passage, early woodwork is gone; however, the late medieval, pointed arches of the doorways survive. The remains of the original structure were altered and enlarged in the eighteenth century to function as a barn, circa 1760. The barn was the subject of "A Historical Report on Great Manson Barn," written in 2003 and donated to the [[Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales]].&lt;ref name=cofleinLB/&gt;

The old cider house is also referred to as the [[granary]] or mill house.&lt;ref name=planning/&gt;&lt;ref name=cofleinLB/&gt;&lt;ref name=cofleinOCH/&gt; It was built in 1763, and bears a stone on its gable end with that date. The cider house was constructed of red sandstone [[rubble]]. Its roof is of asbestos sheeting, and there is a central entrance flanked by windows. In addition, at the right gable end of the mill house, there are stone stairs up to a door with a small bay to the left. The ground floor features a rare, round, stone and wood cider mill. The building continued to function as a cider house into the middle of the twentieth century.&lt;ref name=cofleinLB/&gt;&lt;ref name=cofleinOCH&gt;{{cite web|title=Old Cider House, Great Manson Farm|url=http://www.coflein.gov.uk/en/site/413844/details/OLD+CIDER+HOUSE,+GREAT+MANSON+FARM/|work=coflein.gov.uk|publisher=Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales|accessdate=13 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1959 Great Manson Farm has been owned and farmed by the Miles family. Despite the conversion of the yard and traditional barns to residential dwellings, the farmhouse is still occupied by the family and Great Manson is run as a non intensive sheep farm.

[[File:Hammer of Thor (monument).jpg|200px|left|thumb|The Hammer of Thor monument]]
[[File:Hammer of thor.svg|200px|right|thumb|A [[silhouette]] showing the approximate size and shape of the monument.]]
'''The Hammer of Thor''' is a {{convert|3.3|m|ft|1}} tall, t-shaped, man-made rock formation, located along the [[Arnaud River]] in the [[Ungava Peninsula]], Quebec, Canada. It was discovered in 1964 by an [[archaeologist]] who thought it was erected by [[Vikings]].&lt;ref name="Lee"&gt;{{cite book |last=Lee |first=Thomas E. |title= Archaeological investigations of a longhouse, Pamiok Island, Ungava, 1970 |publisher=Centre d'études nordiques de l'Université Laval |year=1971 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He named it "The Hammer of Thor", in reference to the hammer-wielding [[Thor]] of [[Norsemen|Norse]] culture. Today some scholars{{who|date=September 2018}} believe that it is more likely to be an artifact of [[Inuit]] culture, an [[inuksuk]] or stone landmark.

==Description==
The Hammer of Thor consists of three rocks stacked on top of each other—a vertical shaft, a cross piece, and a capstone. The vertical column, or shaft, measures about {{convert|8|ft|m|2}} tall; the cross piece is about {{convert|4.5|ft|m|2}} long; and the capstone is {{convert|14|in|cm|2}} in height.&lt;ref name="C1=117118"/&gt; The entire monument stands about {{convert|3.3|m|ft|1}} high;&lt;ref name="D1=136"&gt;[[#D1|de Figueiredo 2005]]: p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; and has been estimated to weigh about {{convert|4000|lb|kg|lk=on}}.&lt;ref name="C1=117118"&gt;[[#C1|Colombo 1988]]: pp. 117–118.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is located on the northern bank of the [[Arnaud River]] (formerly known as [[Payne River]]), about {{convert|15|mi|km|1}} above [[Payne Bay]], near the western coast of [[Ungava Bay]], in the [[Ungava Peninsula]], [[Quebec]], Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Peake |first=Michael |date=Spring 2004 |title=A Thor Point in Ungava |journal=Che-Mun |publisher=Ottertooth.com |issue=116 |page=1 |url=http://www.ottertooth.com/che-mun/116/116-1.htm |accessdate=September 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="C1=117118"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Laco&gt;Lester Kovac/Lynette Chubb: [http://sites.google.com/site/landltrips/Trips/vachon-river-2010 Vachon River 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Colombo"&gt;{{cite book | last = Colombo | first = John Robert | authorlink = John Robert Colombo | title = [[Mysterious Canada: Strange Sights, Extraordinary Events, and Peculiar Places]] | year = 1988 | publisher = [[Doubleday Canada]] | isbn = 0-385-25150-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Figueiredo"&gt;{{cite book | last = de Figueiredo | first = Dan | title = Weird Canada: Strange, Wacky, Bizarre &amp; Absurd | year = 2006 | publisher = Blue Bike Books | isbn = 1-897278-04-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery==
The monument was discovered in 1964 by [[archaeologist]] [[Thomas E. Lee]], during an [[anthropological]] expedition to [[Ungava Peninsula|Ungava]]. It had been standing for many years, and no one in the area knew who had erected it. Inuit tradition held that it predated their arrival in the area. Lee considered it to be European in appearance, and considered it to be proof that the Norse inhabited the Ungava region about a thousand years before. Lee thought it looked like a hammer and named the monument "The Hammer of Thor".&lt;ref name="C1=117118"/&gt;

Given growing knowledge about and appreciation for [[Inuit]] culture, contemporary scholars believe this work is as likely to be an [[inuksuk]], a stone landmark, erected by Inuit.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

[[File:Index Librorum Prohibitorum 1.jpg|thumb|Title page of ''Index Librorum Prohibitorum'' (Venice 1564)]]
The '''''Index librorum prohibitorum''''' ({{lang-en|List of Prohibited Books}}) was a list of publications deemed [[heresy|heretical]], or contrary to [[morality]] by the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith|Sacred Congregation of the Index]] (a former [[Dicastery]] of the [[Roman Curia]]) and thus [[Catholic Church|Catholics]] were [[Book censorship|forbidden]] to read them.&lt;ref name="PFGrendler"/&gt;  

There were scattered attempts to censor individual books before the sixteenth century, notably the ninth-century ''Decretum Glasianum'', but none of these were either official or widespread.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lenard |first1=Max |title=On the origin, development and demise of the ''Index librorum prohibitorum'' |journal=Journal of Access Services |date=2006 |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=51–63 |doi=10.1300/J204v03n04_05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much later, a first version (the ''Pauline Index'') was promulgated by [[Pope Paul IV]] in 1559, which Paul F. Grendler believed marked "the turning-point for the freedom of enquiry in the Catholic world", and which lasted less than a year, being then replaced by what was called the ''Tridentine Index'' (because it was authorized at the [[Council of Trent]]), which relaxed aspects of the ''Pauline Index'' that had been criticized and had prevented its acceptance.&lt;ref name="PFGrendler"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=jJnyxg3xxTEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Cambridge+History+of+Renaissance+Philosophy,+Charles+B.+Schmitt,&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=FdZlU8HDFaXm7AbPkIHQBw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Cambridge%20History%20of%20Renaissance%20Philosophy%2C%20Charles%20B.%20Schmitt%2C&amp;f=false Grendler, Paul F. "Printing and censorship" in ''The Cambridge History of Renaissance Philosophy''], Charles B. Schmitt, ed. (Cambridge University Press, 1988, {{ISBN|978-0-52139748-3}}) pp. 45–46&lt;/ref&gt;

The 20th and final edition appeared in 1948, and the ''Index'' was formally abolished on 14 June 1966 by [[Pope Paul VI]].&lt;ref name=Hubert168&gt;''The Church in the Modern Age'', (Volume 10) by Hubert Jedin, John Dolan, Gabriel Adriányi 1981 {{ISBN|082450013X}}, page 168&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kusukawa |first1=Sachiko |title=Galileo and Books |url=http://www.hps.cam.ac.uk/starry/galbooks.html |website=Starry Messenger |language=EN |date=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The aim of the list was to protect the faith and morals of the faithful by preventing the reading of theologically, culturally, and politically disruptive books. Books thought to contain such errors included works by astronomers such as [[Johannes Kepler]]'s ''[[Epitome astronomiae Copernicanae]]'', which was on the Index from 1621 to 1835, and by philosophers, like [[Immanuel Kant]]'s ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]''. The various editions of the ''Index'' also contained the rules of the Church relating to the reading, selling and pre-emptive censorship of books—editions and [[Bible translations|translations of the Bible]] that had not been approved by the Church could be banned.&lt;ref&gt;''Index Librorum Prohibitorum'', 1559, Regula Quarta ("Rule 4")&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Latin Church]] [[canon law (Roman Catholic Church)|canon law]] still recommends that works concerning sacred Scripture, theology, canon law, church history, and any writings which specially concern religion or morals, be submitted to the judgment of the local [[Ordinary (officer)|ordinary]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P2P.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 827 §3]&lt;/ref&gt; The local ordinary consults someone whom he considers competent to give a judgment and, if that person gives the ''[[nihil obstat]]'' ("nothing forbids") the local ordinary grants the ''[[imprimatur]]'' ("let it be printed").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P2P.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 830]&lt;/ref&gt; Members of [[religious institute]]s require the ''[[imprimi potest]]'' (it can be printed) of their major superior to publish books on matters of religion or morals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P2P.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 832]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the scientific theories in works that were on early editions of the Index have long been routinely taught at Catholic universities worldwide; for example, the general prohibition of books advocating [[heliocentrism]] was only removed from the ''Index'' in 1758, but already in 1742 two Minims mathematicians had published an edition of [[Isaac Newton]]'s ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia Mathematica]]'' (1687) with commentaries and a preface stating that the work assumed heliocentrism and could not be explained without it.&lt;ref&gt;John L.Heilbron, ''Censorship of Astronomy in Italy after Galileo'' (in McMullin, Ernan ed., ''The Church and Galileo'', University of Notre Dame Press, Notre Dame, 2005, p. 307, IN. {{ISBN|0-268-03483-4}})&lt;/ref&gt; The burning at the stake of [[Giordano Bruno]],&lt;ref&gt;Paula Findlen, [http://www.thenation.com/doc/20080929/findlen "A Hungry Mind: Giordano Bruno, Philosopher and Heretic"], ''The Nation'', September 10, 2008.

==Background and history==
===European restrictions on the right to print===
[[File:Handtiegelpresse von 1811.jpg|thumb|160px|left|Printing press from 1811, [[Munich]], Germany.]]
The historical context in which the ''Index'' appeared involved the early restrictions on printing in Europe. The refinement of [[moveable type]] and the [[printing press]] by [[Johannes Gutenberg]] around 1440 changed the nature of book publishing, and the mechanism by which information could be disseminated to the public.&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan, Marshall (1962), The Gutenberg Galaxy: The Making of Typographic Man (1st ed.), University of Toronto Press, {{ISBN|978-0-8020-6041-9}} page 124&lt;/ref&gt;  Books, once rare and kept carefully in a small number of libraries, could be mass-produced and widely disseminated.

In the 16th century, both the churches and governments in most European countries attempted to regulate and control printing because it allowed for rapid and widespread circulation of ideas and information. The [[Protestant Reformation]] generated large quantities of polemical new writing by and within both the Catholic and Protestant camps, and religious subject-matter was typically the area most subject to control.  While governments and church encouraged printing in many ways, which allowed the dissemination of [[Bible]]s and government information, works of dissent and criticism could also circulate rapidly. As a consequence, governments established controls over printers across Europe, requiring them to have official licenses to trade and produce books.&lt;ref name="MacQueen 2007 34"&gt;{{Cite book |last=MacQueen |first=Hector L. |last2=Waelde |first2=Charlotte |last3=Laurie |first3=Graeme T. |title=Contemporary Intellectual Property: Law and Policy |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2007 |page=34 |url=https://www.google.com/books?id=_Iwcn4pT0OoC&amp;dq=contemporary+intellectual+property&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |isbn=978-0-19-926339-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="de Sola Pool 1983 14"&gt;{{Cite book |last=de Sola Pool |first=Ithiel |title=Technologies of freedom |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=1983 |page=14 |url=https://www.google.com/books?id=BzLXGUxV4CkC&amp;pg=PA15&amp;dq=Areopagitica+freedom+of+speech+britain&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=36#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |isbn=978-0-674-87233-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The early versions of the ''Index'' began to appear from 1529 to 1571. In the same time frame, in 1557 the [[English Crown]] aimed to stem the flow of dissent by chartering the [[Stationers' Company]]. The right to print was restricted to two universities and to the 21 existing printers in the [[city of London]], which had between them 53 [[printing presses]].

The French crown also tightly controlled printing, and the printer and writer [[Etienne Dolet]] was burned at the stake for atheism in 1546. The 1551 [[Edict of Châteaubriant]] comprehensively summarized censorship positions to date, and included provisions for unpacking and inspecting all books brought into France.&lt;ref&gt;''The Rabelais encyclopedia'' by Elizabeth A. Chesney 2004 {{ISBN|0-313-31034-3}} pages 31–32&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The printing press as an agent of change'' by Elizabeth L. Eisenstein 1980 {{ISBN|0-521-29955-1}} page 328&lt;/ref&gt; The 1557 [[Edict of Compiègne]] applied the death penalty to heretics and resulted in the burning of a noblewoman at the stake.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Jean Knecht, ''The Rise and Fall of Renaissance France: 1483–1610'' 2001, {{ISBN|0-631-22729-6}} page 241&lt;/ref&gt; Printers were viewed as radical and rebellious, with 800 authors, printers and book dealers being incarcerated in the [[Bastille]] before it was stormed in 1789.&lt;ref name="de Sola Pool 1983 15"&gt;{{Cite book |last=de Sola Pool |first=Ithiel |title=Technologies of freedom |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=1983 |page=15 |url=https://www.google.com/books?id=BzLXGUxV4CkC&amp;pg=PA15&amp;dq=Areopagitica+freedom+of+speech+britain&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=36#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |isbn=978-0-674-87233-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; At times, the prohibitions of church and state followed each other, e.g. [[René Descartes]] was placed on the Index in the 1660s and the French government prohibited the teaching of [[Cartesianism]] in schools in the 1670s.&lt;ref&gt;''A companion to Descartes'' by Janet Broughton, John Peter Carriero 2007 {{ISBN|1-4051-2154-8}} page&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Statute of Anne|Copyright Act 1710]] in Britain, and later copyright laws in France, eased this situation. However, historian Eckhard Höffner claims that copyright laws and their restrictions acted as a barrier to progress in those countries for over a century, since British publishers could print valuable knowledge in limited quantities for the sake of profit; while the German economy prospered in the same time frame since there were no restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/international/zeitgeist/0,1518,710976,00.html Der Spiegel August 18 2010 article: No Copyright Law]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Geschichte und Wesen des Urheberrechts'' (History and nature of copyright) by Eckhard Höffner, July 2010 (in German) {{ISBN|3-930893-16-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early indexes (1529–1571)===
[[File:Index 1557.jpg|thumb|160px|Title page of the first Papal Index, ''Index Auctorum et Librorum'', published in 1557 and then withdrawn.]]
The first list of the kind was not published in [[Rome]], but in Catholic [[Habsburg Netherlands|Netherlands]] (1529); [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] (1543) and [[Paris]] (1551) under the terms of the [[Edict of Châteaubriant]] followed this example. By mid-century, in the tense atmosphere of wars of religion in Germany and France, both Protestant and Catholic authorities reasoned that only control of the press, including a catalog of prohibited works, coordinated by ecclesiastic and governmental authorities could prevent the spread of heresy.&lt;ref name="Schmitt 1991:45"&gt;Schmitt 1991:45.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Roman ''Index'' was printed in 1557 under the direction of [[Pope Paul IV]] (1555–1559), but then withdrawn for unclear reasons.&lt;ref name="Forbes 70"/&gt; In 1559, a new index was finally published, banning the entire works of some 550 authors in addition to the individual proscribed titles:&lt;ref name="Forbes 70"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=drKSeeGU_1oC&amp;pg=PA70 ''Studies in the History of Venice'' by Brown Horatio Robert Forbes p.70]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;They included everything by [[Pietro Aretino]], [[Machiavelli]], [[Erasmus]] and [[Rabelais]] (Schmitt 1991:45).&lt;/ref&gt; "The Pauline Index felt that the religious convictions of an author contaminated all his writing."&lt;ref name="Schmitt 1991:45"/&gt; The work of the censors was considered too severe and met with much opposition even in Catholic intellectual circles; after the [[Council of Trent]] had authorised a revised list prepared under [[Pope Pius IV]], the so-called ''Tridentine Index'' was promulgated in 1564; it remained the basis of all later lists until [[Pope Leo XIII]], in 1897, published his ''Index Leonianus''.

The [[blacklisting]] of some Protestant scholars even when writing on subjects a modern reader would consider outside the realm of [[dogma]] meant that, unless they obtained a [[dispensation (Catholic Church)|dispensation]], obedient Catholic thinkers were denied access to works including: botanist [[Conrad Gesner]]'s ''[[Historiae animalium (Gesner)|Historiae animalium]]''; the botanical works of [[Otto Brunfels]]; those of the medical scholar [[Janus Cornarius]]; to [[Christoph Hegendorff]] or [[Johann Oldendorp]] on the theory of law; Protestant geographers and cosmographers like [[Jacob Ziegler]] or [[Sebastian Münster]]; as well as anything by Protestant theologians like [[Martin Luther]], [[John Calvin]] or [[Philipp Melanchthon]].&lt;ref&gt;These authors are instanced by Schmitt 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;  Among the inclusions was the [[Libri Carolini]], a theological work from the 9th century court of [[Charlemagne]], which was published in 1549 by Bishop Jean du Tillet and which had already been on two other lists of prohibited books before being inserted into the Tridentine Index.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7rjenNXferEC&amp;pg=PA90 Paul Oskar Kristeller (editor), ''Itinerarium Italicum''] (Brill 1975 {{ISBN|978-90-0404259-9}}), p. 90&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sacred Congregation of the Index (1571–1917)===
In 1571, a special [[congregation (Roman Curia)|congregation]] was created, the '''Sacred Congregation of the Index''', which had the specific task to investigate those writings that were denounced in [[Rome]] as being not exempt of errors, to update the list of Pope Pius IV regularly and also to make lists of required corrections in case a writing was not to be condemned absolutely but only in need of correction; it was then listed with a mitigating clause (e.g., ''donec corrigatur'' (forbidden until corrected) or ''donec expurgetur'' (forbidden until purged)).{{cn|date=June 2017}}

Several times a year, the congregation held meetings. During the meetings, they reviewed various works and documented those discussions. In between the meetings was when the works to be discussed were thoroughly examined, and each work was scrutinized by two people. At the meetings, they collectively decided whether or not the works should be included in the Index. Ultimately, the pope was the one who had to approve of works being added or removed from the Index. It was the documentation from the meetings of the congregation that aided the pope in making his decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Heneghan |first1=Thomas |title=Secrets Behind The Forbidden Books |journal=America |date=2005 |volume=192 |issue=4 |url=http://americamagazine.org/issue/517/article/secrets-behindthe-forbidden-books |accessdate=27 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140726125102/http://americamagazine.org/issue/517/article/secrets-behindthe-forbidden-books |archivedate=26 July 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Galileo before the Holy Office.jpg|thumb|left|[[Galileo]] being condemned in 1633.]]
This sometimes resulted in very long lists of corrections, published in the ''Index Expurgatorius'', which was cited by [[Thomas James]] in 1627 as "an invaluable reference work to be used by the curators of the [[Bodleian library]] when listing those works particularly worthy of collecting".&lt;ref&gt;
{{citation |title=Encyclopedia on Censorship |first1=Jonathan |last1=Green |first2=Nicholas J. |last2=Karolides |page=257 |publisher=Facts on File, Inc |year=2005 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bunHURgi7FcC&amp;pg=PA257}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Prohibitions made by other congregations (mostly the Holy Office) were simply passed on to the Congregation of the Index, where the final [[decree]]s were drafted and made public, after approval of the [[Pope]] (who always had the possibility to condemn an author personally—there are only a few examples of such condemnation, including those of [[Lamennais]] and [[George Hermes|Hermes]]).{{cn|date=June 2017}}

An update to the Index was made by Pope [[Leo XIII]], in the 1897 apostolic constitution [[Officiorum ac Munerum]], known as the "Index Leonianus".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03519d.htm Catholic encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent editions of the Index were more sophisticated; they graded authors according to their supposed degree of toxicity, and they marked specific passages for expurgation rather than condemning entire books.&lt;ref&gt;Lyons, Martyn. (2011). Books: A Living History. Los Angeles, CA: Getty Publications. {{ISBN|978-1-60606-083-4}}, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Sacred Congregation of the Inquisition]] of the Roman Catholic Church later became the [[Holy Office]], and since 1965 has been called the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]]. The Congregation of the Index was merged with the Holy Office in 1917, by the Motu Proprio "Alloquentes Proxime" of Pope Benedict XV; the rules on the reading of books were again reelaborated in the new ''Codex Iuris Canonici''. From 1917 onward, the Holy Office (again) took care of the Index.{{cn|date=June 2017}}

===Holy Office (1917–1966)===
While individual books continued to be forbidden, the last edition of the Index to be published appeared in 1948. This 20th&lt;ref name=EB&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/285220/Index-Librorum-Prohibitorum Encyclopædia Britannica: ''Index Librorum Prohibitorum'']&lt;/ref&gt; edition contained 4,000 titles censored for various reasons: [[heresy]], moral deficiency, [[Human sexuality|sexual]] explicitness, and so on. That some [[Atheism|atheist]]s, such as [[Schopenhauer]] and [[Nietzsche]], were not included was due to the general ([[Council of Trent|Tridentine]]) rule that [[Heresy|heretical]] works (''i.e.'', works that contradict Catholic dogma) are [[ipso facto]] forbidden. Some important works are absent simply because nobody bothered to denounce them.&lt;ref&gt;"The works appearing on the Index are only those that ecclesiastical authority was asked to act upon" ([http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/285220/Index-Librorum-Prohibitorum Encyclopædia Britannica: Index Librorum Prohibitorum).]&lt;/ref&gt;  Many actions of the congregations were of a definite [[political]] content.&lt;ref&gt;"The entanglement of Church and state power in many cases led to overtly political titles being placed on the Index, titles which had little to do with immorality or attacks on the Catholic faith.  For example, a history of Bohemia, the Rervm Bohemica Antiqvi Scriptores Aliqvot ... by Marqvardi Freheri (published in 1602), was placed on the Index not for attacking the Church, but rather because it advocated the independence of Bohemia from the (Catholic) Austro-Hungarian Empire.  Likewise, The Prince by Machiavelli was placed in the Index in 1559 after it was blamed for widespread political corruption in France (Curry, 1999, p.5)" ([http://www.unc.edu/~dusto/dusto_prague_paper.pdf David Dusto, ''Index Librorum Prohibitorum: The History, Philosophy, and Impact of the Index of Prohibited Books'').] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020043824/http://www.unc.edu/~dusto/dusto_prague_paper.pdf |date=2012-10-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the significant listed works of the period was the Nazi philosopher [[Alfred Rosenberg]]'s ''[[Myth of the Twentieth Century]]'' for scorning and rejecting "all dogmas of the Catholic Church, indeed the very fundamentals of the Christian religion".&lt;ref name="Richard Bonney pp. 122"/&gt;

===Abolition (1966)===
On 7 December 1965, Pope Paul VI issued the Motu Proprio ''[[Integrae servandae]]'' that reorganized the Holy Office as the ''Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Paul VI, Pope|date=1965-12-07|title=Integrae servandae|website=vatican.va|url=http://w2.vatican.va/content/paul-vi/en/motu_proprio/documents/hf_p-vi_motu-proprio_19651207_integrae-servandae.html|accessdate=2016-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Index was not listed as being a part of the newly constituted congregation's competence, leading to questioning whether it still was. This question was put to Cardinal [[Alfredo Ottaviani]], pro-prefect of the congregation, who responded in the negative.&lt;ref&gt;''L'Osservatore della Domenica'', 24 April 1966, pg. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Cardinal also indicated in his response that there was going to be a change in the Index soon.

A June 1966 Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith [[Notification (Holy See)|notification]] announced that, while the ''Index'' maintained its moral force, in that it taught Christians to beware, as required by the natural law itself, of those writings that could endanger faith and morality, it no longer had the force of [[ecclesiastical positive law]] with the associated penalties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith|date=1966-06-14|title=Notification regarding the abolition of the Index of books|website=vatican.va|location=|publisher=|url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_19660614_de-indicis-libr-prohib_en.html|access-date=2016-07-10|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307041622/http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_19660614_de-indicis-libr-prohib_en.html|archivedate=2014-03-07|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope and impact==
===Censorship and enforcement===
The ''Index'' was not simply a reactive work. Roman Catholic [[author]]s had the opportunity to defend their writings and could prepare a new edition with necessary corrections or deletions, either to avoid or to limit a [[Ban (law)|ban]]. Pre-publication censorship was encouraged.{{cn|date=June 2017}}

The ''Index'' was enforceable within the [[Papal States]], but elsewhere only if adopted by the civil powers, as happened in several Italian states.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=rl96-_JKQvkC&amp;pg=PA236 Stephen G. Burnett, ''Christian Hebraism in the Reformation Era''] (Brill 2012 {{ISBN|978-9-00422248-9}}), p. 236&lt;/ref&gt; Other areas adopted their own lists of forbidden books. In the [[Holy Roman Empire]] book censorship, which preceded publication of the ''Index'', came under control of the Jesuits at the end of the 16th century, but had little effect, since the German princes within the empire set up their own systems.&lt;ref name=Febvre/&gt; In France it was French officials who decided what books were banned&lt;ref name=Febvre&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=9opxcMjv4TUC&amp;pg=PA245 Lucien Febvre, Henri Jean Martin, ''The Coming of the Book: The Impact of Printing 1450–1800''] (Verso 1976 {{ISBN|978-1-85984108-2}}), pp. 245–246&lt;/ref&gt; and the Church's ''Index'' was not recognized.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=W7ZKc_okFDkC&amp;pg=PA11 John Michael Lewis, ''Galileo in France''] (Peter Lang 2006 {{ISBN|978-0-82045768-0}}), p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Spain had its own ''Index Librorum Prohibitorum'', which corresponded largely to the Church's,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=jJnyxg3xxTEC&amp;pg=PA48 C. B. Schmitt, Quentin Skinner, Eckhard Kessler, ''Renaissance Philosophy']' (Cambridge University Press 1988 {{ISBN|978-0-52139748-3}}), p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; but also included a list of books that were allowed once the forbidden part (sometimes a single sentence) was removed or "expurgated".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=HKcrSTBD0W8C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Bernardo de Sandoval, Archbishop of Toledo ''Index Librorum et Expurgatorium'' (Louis Sanchez Typography,  Madrid 1612) Regla XII ]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Continued moral obligation===
On 14 June 1966, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith responded to inquiries it had received regarding the continued moral obligation concerning books that had been listed in the Index. The response spoke of the books as examples of books dangerous to faith and morals, all of which, not just those once included in the Index, should be avoided regardless of the absence of any written law against them. The Index, it said, retains its moral force "inasmuch as" (''quatenus'') it teaches the conscience of Christians to beware, as required by the natural law itself, of writings that can endanger faith and morals, but it (the Index of Forbidden Books) no longer has the force of ecclesiastical law with the associated censures.&lt;ref&gt;"Haec S. Congregatio pro Doctrina Fidei, facto verbo cum Beatissimo Patre, nuntiat Indicem suum vigorem moralem servare, quatenus Christifidelium conscientiam docet, ut ab illis scriptis, ipso iure naturali exigente, caveant, quae fidem ac bonos mores in discrimen adducere possint; eundem tamen non amplius vim legis ecclesiasticae habere cum adiectis censuris" (''Acta Apostolicae Sedis'' 58 (1966), p. 445).  Cf. [http://cctld.it/storia/informazione/index/notificatio_14_6_66.pdf Italian text published, together with the Latin, on ''L'Osservatore Romano'' of 15 June 1966])&lt;/ref&gt;

The congregation thus placed on the conscience of the individual Christian the responsibility to avoid all writings dangerous to faith and morals, while at the same time abolishing the previously existing ecclesiastical law and the relative censures,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicculture.org/culture/library/dictionary/index.cfm?id=35670 ''Post litteras apostolicas'']&lt;/ref&gt; without thereby declaring that the books that had once been listed in the various editions of the Index of Prohibited Books had become free of error and danger.

In a letter of 31 January 1985 to Cardinal [[Giuseppe Siri]], regarding the book ''[[The Poem of the Man-God]]'', Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger (then Prefect of the Congregation, who later became [[Pope Benedict XVI]]), referred to the 1966 notification of the Congregation as follows: "After the dissolution of the Index, when some people thought the printing and distribution of the work was permitted, people were reminded again in ''L'Osservatore Romano'' (15 June 1966) that, as was published in the ''Acta Apostolicae Sedis'' (1966), the Index retains its moral force despite its dissolution. A decision against distributing and recommending a work, which has not been condemned lightly, may be reversed, but only after profound changes that neutralize the harm which such a publication could bring forth among the ordinary faithful."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ewtn.com/expert/answers/poem_of_the_man.htm Poem of the Man-God]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Changing judgments===

In the course of centuries, editions of the Index Librorum Prohibitorum saw deletions as well as additions of content. Thus writings by [[Antonio Rosmini-Serbati]] were placed on the Index in 1849 but were removed by 1855, and [[Pope John Paul II]] mentioned Rosmini's work as a significant example of "a process of philosophical enquiry which was enriched by engaging the data of faith".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/encyclicals/documents/hf_jp-ii_enc_14091998_fides-et-ratio_en.html Encyclical ''Fides et ratio''], 74&lt;/ref&gt; The 1758 edition of the Index removed the general prohibition of works advocating [[heliocentrism]] as a fact rather than a hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;McMullin, Ernan, ed. The Church and Galileo. Notre Dame, IN: University of Notre Dame Press. 2005. {{ISBN|0-268-03483-4}}. pp. 307, 347&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the ideas that were part of the charges of heresy (along with many other purely religious ones) against [[Giordano Bruno]], who in 1600 was burned alive at the stake in [[Campo de' Fiori]] in [[Rome]], now form some of the foundations of modern [[cosmology]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2008/08/25/080825crbo_books_acocella?currentPage=all New Yorker Magazine, August 25, 2008: ''The Forbidden World'']&lt;/ref&gt;

With the changing standards by which items are judged as immoral and with books being produced in some countries at a rate of one every few minutes, the maintenance of any kind of Index would have proven almost impossible, in any case.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Shattuck 1997 ''Forbidden Knowledge: From Prometheus to Pornography'' {{ISBN|0-15-600551-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/18/books/the-last-word-how-many-books-are-too-many.html?pagewanted=1 New York Times: ''How Many Books are Too Many?''

[[Charles Darwin]]'s works were never included.&lt;ref&gt;Rafael Martinez, professor of the philosophy of science at the Santa Croce Pontifical University in Rome, in speech reported on [http://www.cinews.ie/article.php?artid=5793 Catholic Ireland net] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090607000752/http://www.cinews.ie/article.php?artid=5793 |date=2009-06-07 }} Accessed 26 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt; 

In many cases, an author's ''opera omnia'' (his complete works) were forbidden. Most of these were inserted in the Index at a time when the Index itself stated that the prohibition of someone's ''opera omnia'' did not cover works whose contents did not concern religion and were not forbidden by the general rules of the Index, but this explanation was omitted in the 1929 edition, an omission that was officially interpreted in 1940 as meaning that thenceforth "''opera omnia''" covered all the author's works without exception.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Tie0hkcrpg4C&amp;pg=PA36 Jesús Martínez de Bujanda, ''Index librorum prohibitorum: 1600–1966''] (Droz 2002 {{ISBN|2-600-00818-7}}), p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

Cardinal Ottaviani stated in April 1966 there was too much contemporary literature and the Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith could not keep up with it.&lt;ref&gt;''[[L'Osservatore della Domenica]], 24 April 1966, pg. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Itzan''' is a [[Maya civilization|Maya]] archaeological site located in the [[Municipalities of Guatemala|municipality]] of [[La Libertad, El Petén|La Libertad]] in the [[Petén Department]] of [[Guatemala]].&lt;ref name=Ponciano1991-232&gt;Ponciano 1991, p.232.&lt;/ref&gt; Various small structures at the site were destroyed in the 1980s during oil exploration activities by Sonpetrol and Basic Resources Ltd, prompting rescue excavations by archaeologists.&lt;ref name=Ponciano1991-232/&gt; In spite of its small size, the site appears to have been the most politically important centre in its area, as evidenced by its unusually large quantity of monuments and the size of its major architecture.&lt;ref&gt;Ponciano 1991, pp.234-235.&lt;/ref&gt;

The site was first occupied in the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Middle Preclassic]], with occupation continuing to the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Late Classic]].&lt;ref&gt;Román de León &amp; Johnston 1992, pp.50, 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
The ruins are {{convert|25|km|mi}} northwest of the [[Dos Pilas]] archaeological site on the bank of a minor tributary of the [[Pasion River]].&lt;ref name=Sharer387&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006 , p.387.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coe 1999, p.152.&lt;/ref&gt; The city was on a natural hilltop surrounded by ravines and seasonal swamps.&lt;ref name=Ponciano1991-234&gt;Ponciano 1991, p.234.&lt;/ref&gt; The tributary of the Pasion River has its origin in [[Laguna Itzan]], a small lake to the east of the site.&lt;ref name=Ponciano1991-234/&gt; A spring to the west of the site appears to have been a permanent watersource for the city.&lt;ref name=Ponciano1991-234/&gt; Itzan is situated roughly halfway between the Classic Period cities of [[Altar de Sacrificios]] and [[Seibal]], and is located about {{convert|14|km|mi}} northeast of the former.&lt;ref name=Roman50&gt;Román de León &amp; Johnston 1992, p.50.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Houston, p.3.&lt;/ref&gt; The site is located approximately {{convert|50|km|mi}} west of the modern town of [[Sayaxché]] and {{convert|8|km|mi}} north of the Pasion River.&lt;ref name=Roman50/&gt;

==History==
Itzan was continuously occupied from the Middle Preclassic through to the Late Classic, with much reduced activity during the Early Classic, with the latter period only being evidenced by a single burial accompanied by a ceramic plate.&lt;ref&gt;Román de León &amp; Johnston 1992, p.56.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hieroglyphic Stairway 2 at the Late Classic period kingdom of Dos Pilas records that in 652 AD the powerful city of [[Calakmul]] seized control of Itzan,&lt;ref&gt;Fahsen et al 2003, p.689.&lt;/ref&gt; and Dos Pilas itself also won a major victory over the city.&lt;ref&gt;Demarest 2006, p.139.&lt;/ref&gt; Itzan may also have gone to war against [[El Chorro (Maya site)|El Chorro]].&lt;ref&gt;Houston, p.4.&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[lady of Itzan|noblewoman from Itzan]] became the main wife of  [[B'alaj Chan K'awiil]], a king of Dos Pilas, and their son was [[Itzamnaaj B'alam|Itzamnaaj Balam]].&lt;ref name=Sharer387/&gt; The collapse of the aggressive Dos Pilas kingdom in the late 8th century AD apparently benefited Itzan, which then experienced a period of renewed activity.&lt;ref&gt;Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

The site was discovered in February 1968 by Dennis and Louisa Wheeler, two [[Peace Corps]] volunteers.&lt;ref name=Ponciano1991-234/&gt; The ruins were then explored by archaeologists of the [[Seibal|Ceibal Project]] in 1978, who only spent a few hours at the site.&lt;ref name=Ponciano1991-234/&gt;

==Site description==
Itzan was a small city but was considered by archaeologists to have characteristics that made excavation worthwhile.&lt;ref name=Ponciano1991-234/&gt; Initial investigations recorded a number of carved monuments and large structures, some standing up to {{convert|7|m|ft}} high.&lt;ref name=Ponciano1991-234/&gt; The site core was mapped in 1986, when archaeologists noted that a number of carved monuments had been damaged by looters and that some of the buildings had been cut by looters' trenches.&lt;ref name=Ponciano1991-234/&gt; Various monument pieces that had been cut by looters were transferred to the departmental capital [[Flores, El Petén|Flores]] with the intention of later moving them to [[Guatemala City]].&lt;ref&gt;Ponciano 1991, p.235.&lt;/ref&gt;

The centre of the site is grouped around the North and South Plazas, both of which are open plazas, and the closed West and East Plazuelas which are completely enclosed by architecture.&lt;ref&gt;Román de León &amp; Johnston 1992, p.52.&lt;/ref&gt;

The site core includes a formal acropolis, large plazas and a large amount of [[stele|stelae]] and altars, totalling at least 25 monuments, all of which have been moved from their original locations by looters in order to excavate below them.&lt;ref name=Ponciano1991-234/&gt; Most of these monuments were originally positioned in open plazas in front of the largest structures.&lt;ref name=Ponciano1991-234/&gt; The remains of [[Maya writing|hieroglyphic texts]] were found associated with the North and South Stairways of the West Plaza.&lt;ref&gt;Ponciano 1991, pp.234-235.&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the Late Classic period acropolis was built upon earlier Preclassic structures.&lt;ref&gt;Román de León &amp; Johnston 1992, pp.54-55.&lt;/ref&gt;

The site periphery between {{convert|3.6|to|4|km|mi}} south of the site core included at least three groups of simple perishable Late Classic residential structures laid out around central patios, without being built upon platforms, suggesting that the population of the site was greater than initially thought based on the site's monumental architecture.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston et al 1992, pp.131, 134, 144.&lt;/ref&gt; The entire settled area of Itzan occupies a ridge in a strip about {{convert|300|m|ft}} wide by {{convert|7|km|mi}} long, with the site core being situated near the centre of this zone.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston et al 1992, p.134.&lt;/ref&gt; A modern road cuts through the area of settlement.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston et al 1992, p.134.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stela 17''' includes a hieroglyphic text that mentions lords of Itzan and of the nearby city of Altar de Sacrificios. It also contains a section of damaged text that may indicate warfare between Itzan and the site of El Chorro.&lt;ref&gt;Houston, pp.3-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stela 20''' is fragmented. A large piece was found to the northwest of the acropolis.&lt;ref&gt;Román de León &amp; Johnston 1992, p.55.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kenneth E. Naylor, Jr.''' (February 27, 1937 – March 10, 1992) was an [[Americans|American]] [[Linguistics|linguist]] and [[Slavic studies|Slavist]], one of the leading experts on [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]] and [[South Slavic languages]] in general.

==Biography==
Naylor received his A.B. degree in French linguistics from [[Cornell University]] in 1958 and A.M. in General Linguistics from [[Indiana University]] in 1960. At Indiana, he began to study Slavic with professor [[Edward Stankiewicz]], who became his mentor and close friend.

When Stankiewicz moved to the [[University of Chicago]], Naylor followed him. There, after studying in [[Novi Sad]], [[Yugoslavia]], under a Yugoslav Government Exchange Fellowship and an NDFL Title VI Fellowship for Serbo-Croatian from the United States government, he received his doctorate in Russian and South Slavic linguistics in 1966.

He served as an assistant professor at the [[University of Pittsburgh]] from 1964 to 1966, and began teaching Slavic linguistics at the [[Ohio State University]] in 1966. At the time of his death in 1992, he was the Acting Director of the [[Center for Slavic and East European Studies]] at
Ohio State.

==Work==
Naylor received numerous awards, grants, and fellowships from many sources, including the [[American Council of Learned Societies]], the [[Fulbright program]], and the countries of [[Bulgaria]] and Yugoslavia, from which he was awarded medals of honor (the ''Jubilee Medal'' and the ''Order of the Yugoslav Flag with Golden Wreath'', respectively). In 1982, under the auspices of the Fulbright-Hays Program, he held a Senior Lecturership as a guest professor at the [[University of Novi Sad]]. In 1990, he testified before the [[United States House of Representatives]], Foreign Affairs Committee, on ethnic rivalry in Yugoslavia and the development of the [[Serbo-Croatian language]].

His research centered on the Serbo-Croatian language and on South Slavic languages in general, but especially in their [[Balkan]] context. He edited two volumes of ''The American Bibliography of Slavic and East European Studies'' (1967 and 1968/1969), was guest editor of Volume 1 of ''[[Folia Slavica]]'' (1977), and was co-editor of ''Slavic Linguistics and Poetics: Studies for Edward Stankiewicz on his 60th Birthday'' (Slavica, 1982). In addition, he served as editor of the journal ''[[Balkanistica]]'', producing the first five volumes (1975–1977, 1980, and 1981). The overwhelming majority of his 100-plus articles, reviews, and edited works focused on Serbo-Croatian and Balkan linguistics, with several notable and much quoted ones among them.

A collection of 18 of his most important papers on Serbo-Croatian and Balkan sociolinguistics, translated into Serbo-Croatian, was published posthumously in Belgrade, under the title ''Sociolingvistički problemi među Južnim Slovenima'' (Prosveta, 1996), containing as well an overview of his life by Milorad Radovanović and an appreciation of his scholarly career by [[Pavle Ivić]].

==Legacy==
In his honor, the ''Kenneth E. Naylor Professorship of South Slavic Linguistics'' was created officially on November 5, 1993 at The Ohio State University.

The first Naylor Lecture was delivered on May 28, 1998 by [[Victor Friedman]], Professor and Chair of the Department of Slavic Languages and Literatures at the [[University of Chicago]], who spoke on the subject of ''Linguistic Emblems and Emblematic Languages: On Language as Flag in the Balkans''. The success of that lecture led to the idea of making it public beyond the reaches of the audience on that day, and thus was born the ''Kenneth E. Naylor Memorial Lecture Series in South Slavic Linguistics''.

A carefully polished and more fully developed version of Professor Friedman's lecture was published in 1999 as the first number in the series. The second publication in this series came in 2000, when [[Ronelle Alexander]], Professor of Slavic Languages and Literatures at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], refining and augmenting her 1999 Naylor Lecture, ''In Honor of Diversity: The Linguistic Resources of the Balkans'', turned it into a detailed overview of Balkan Slavic dialectology, together with a fifty-page bibliography of relevant works. [[Wayles Browne]], Professor of
Linguistics at [[Cornell University]] and the third Naylor lecturer on May 19, 2000, published for the first time a paper he wrote in Croatian in 1973 on a subject that Naylor himself had written on, namely accent classes of the Serbo-Croatian noun, especially as revealed through loanwords.

'''Kit houses in Michigan''' were a type of housing that was largely developed in the US state of [[Michigan]] throughout the first half of the 20th century. Michigan was home to the [[The Aladdin Company|Aladdin Company]], the first and longest-lived manufacturer of [[kit houses in North America]], who had sales "in every part of the world, from Saskatchewan to Tahiti".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.neh.gov/humanities/1998/septemberoctober/feature/built-in-day |title=Built in a Day: Capturing the era of catalog architecture|first=Ronica|last=Roth|date=September–October 1998|volume=19|issue=5|journal=Humanities|publisher=[[National Endowment for the Humanities]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lewis and Sterling, two other major manufacturers of kit houses, were also based in Michigan.

Starting with Aladdin's simple [[knock-down kit|knock-down]] models, these kit houses quickly evolved into full-size homes that were based on the architectural styles of the period. Unlike pre-fabricated homes, these homes were shipped in thousands of individual parts that had to be constructed on-site. The introduction of pre-cut lumber pieces helped to expedite the construction process. Shipping pre-cut home parts across the United States, these companies turned Michigan into the "center of kit-home manufacturing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D2ApWhVWSaUC&amp;q=center+of+kit-home+manufacturing#v=snippet&amp;q=center%20of%20kit-home%20manufacturing&amp;f=false|page=57 |title=American Nightmare: How Government Undermines the Dream of Homeownership|first=Randal|last=O'Toole|publisher=[[Cato Institute]]|year=2012|isbn=1937184897}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of the homes manufactured by these companies and other kit house manufacturers like [[Sears Catalog Home|Sears]], Gordon-Van Tine and Wardway can be found in communities across the state of Michigan. These include clusters of homes and rare models that are notable in the history of kit houses, the oldest of which are now over 100 years old.

==History==
Among the first kit house companies was the Aladdin Company, based in [[Bay City, Michigan|Bay City]], which started producing kit houses and other domestic buildings in 1906. Aladdin sold large orders of kit houses to companies in the extraction and manufacturing fields who used them to create neighborhoods of kit houses for employees of those companies. By 1918, 2.4% of all US housing starts could be credited to homes purchased from Aladdin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qzh2MGebNtcC&amp;q=aladdin#v=snippet&amp;q=aladdin&amp;f=false|page=113 |title=On Frank Lloyd Wright's Concrete Adobe: Irving Gill, Rudolph Schindler and the American Southwest|first=Donald Leslie |last=Johnson|publisher=[[Ashgate Publishing]]|year=2013|isbn=1409428176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lumber for early Aladdin homes was provided by the Lewis company of Bay City. In 1913, Lewis began to produce their own line of kit houses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historichousecolors.com/documents/LewisHomes.pdf |format= PDF |title= The House that Lewis Built |first1= Sally |last1= Linvell Bund |first2=Robert|last2=Schweitzer|publisher=Historic House Colors|accessdate=October 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1915, the International Mill &amp; Timber Company of Bay City began selling kit houses under the Sterling brand. The presence of three major manufacturers of kit houses was due in part to [[Bay City, Michigan#History|Bay City's history]] relation to the timber industry. This capacity to process large amounts of timber allowed these companies to easily supply the volume of lumber necessary for kit houses.

Unlike other kit house manufacturers that went out of the kit home business due to the Great Depression or the advent of World War II, all three Michigan-based companies continued to manufacture kit houses for a number of decades, with Lewis and Sterling closing in the 1970s and Aladdin being the last to close in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.historichousecolors.com/documents/CB-0908-BungalowBasics-AladdinBung.pdf |format= PDF |title=Magic in a Box: Aladdin Bungalows|first=Robert|last=Schweitzer|journal=Cottages &amp; Bungalows|date=August–September 2009|pages=72–76}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several smaller companies including the McClure Company of Saginaw also produced kit houses that were sold around the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://sites.google.com/site/cheverlyhistory/Home/mcclure-houses-in-cheverly|title=McClure Houses in Cheverly|accessdate=October 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Aladdin, Lewis and Sterling were all based in Bay City and the city's neighborhoods feature many kit houses from all three companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://canabaycity.org/ |title=Home|publisher=Center Avenue Neighborhood Association|year=2013|accessdate=October 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include some of the largest kit house models from these companies that were built for executives of the kit house manufacturers. Other communities that have notable collections of existing kit houses include [[Ann Arbor]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aaobserver.aadl.org/aaobserver/36080 |title=Ann Arbor's Kit Homes|first1=Grace|last1=Shackman|first2=Rob|last2=Schweitzer|work=[[Ann Arbor Observer]]|date=January 1991|accessdate=November 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://impressions.washtenawhistory.org/impressions_199103o.pdf |format= PDF |title=Mail Order Kit Homes: More and More Examples Identified Locally|work=Washtenaw Impressions|date=March 1991|pages=2–5|accessdate=October 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=impressive&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.searshomes.org/index.php/2013/03/07/ann-arbor-a-bunch-of-kit-homes/ |title=Ann Arbor: An Impressive Ensemble of Kit Homes|date=March 7, 2013|accessdate=October 23, 2014|publisher=Sears Modern Homes}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Berkley, Michigan|Berkley]], [[Clawson, Michigan|Clawson]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.clawsonhistoricalsociety.org/galleries_kit_homes.html |title=Homes by Mail: Kit Houses in Clawson|publisher=Clawson Historical Society|accessdate=October 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Detroit, Pontiac, Waterford, Flint, and [[Ypsilanti]].

Michigan manufacturers and their competitors produced "streets lined with houses" in Ypsilanti, outside of the architectural norms set out in Marcus Whiffen's quintessential ''American Architecture Since 1780''.&lt;ref name=schweitzer&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rKoLHrcwe2MC&amp;q=streets+lined+with+houses#v=snippet&amp;q=streets%20lined%20with%20houses&amp;f=false|title=America's Favorite Homes: Mail-Order Catalogues as a Guide to Popular Early 20th-century Houses|page=13|first1=Robert |last1=Schweitzer|first2=Michael W.

A '''language barrier''' is a figurative phrase used primarily to refer to linguistic barriers to [[communication]], i.e. the difficulties in communication experienced by people or groups speaking different [[languages]], or even [[dialect]]s in some cases.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/language-barrier "language barrier"] in the Collins English Dictionary.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|language barrier}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://guides.co/g/the-seven-barriers-of-communication/37300 "Examples of Language Barriers"] in ''The Seven Barriers of Communication.'' [Accessed 5 March 2017].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Communication ==
Typically, little [[communication]] occurs unless one or both parties learn a new [[language]], which requires an investment of much time and effort. People travelling abroad often encounter a language barrier.

The people who come to a new country at an adult age, when language learning is a cumbersome process, can have particular difficulty "overcoming the language barrier". Similar difficulties occur at multinational meetings, where interpreting services can be costly, hard to obtain, and prone to error.

In 1995, 24,000 of the freshmen entering the California State University system reported English was their second language; yet only 1,000 of these non-active speakers of English tested proficient in college-level English (Kahmi-Stein&amp;Stein,1999). Numbers such as these make it evident that it is crucial for instruction librarians to acknowledge the challenges that language can present. Clearly use of English is a key complicating factor in international students' use of an American university library. 
Language difficulties affect not only information-gathering skills but also help-seeking behaviors. Lack of proficiency in English can be a major concern for international students in their library use as it relates to asking for and receiving assistance. Lee (1991), herself a former international student, explains that international students tend to be acquiescent and believe that school is the one place in the English-speaking world where they should be able to compete on an equal basis. International students are receptive and strongly motivated. For international students, concerned with proper sentence structure and precise vocabulary, this alteration of words and positions can be much more baffling than it is to native English speakers. The use of synonyms, a necessity in keyword searching, is difficult to master, especially for students with limited English vocabulary (F. Jacobson, 1988). In 2012, The Rosetta Foundation declared April 19 the international [[The Rosetta Foundation#History|"No Language Barrier Day"]]. The idea behind the day is to raise international awareness about the fact that it is not languages that represent barriers: languages should not be removed, they are not a barrier - to the contrary, they should be celebrated. It is access to translation services that is the barrier preventing communities from accessing and sharing information across languages. The annual celebration of this day aims to raise awareness about and to grow global community translation efforts.

== Migration ==

Language barriers also influence migration. Emigrants from a country are far more likely to move to a destination country which speaks the same language as the emigrant's country. Thus, most British emigration has been to [[Australia]], [[Canada]], or [[New Zealand]], most Spanish emigration has been to [[Latin America]], and Portuguese emigration to [[Brazil]]. Even if the destination country does not speak the emigrant's language, it is still more likely to receive immigration if it speaks a language ''related'' to that of the emigrant. The most obvious example is the great [[European colonization of the Americas|migration of Europeans to the Americas]]. The [[United States]], with its dominant [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] [[English language]], attracted primarily immigrants from [[Northern Europe]], where Germanic tongues were spoken or familiar. The most common backgrounds in the United States are German, Irish, and English, and the vast majority of Scandinavian emigrants also moved to the United States (or English-speaking Canada). Southern Europeans, such as Italians, were more likely to move to Latin American countries; today, people of Italian descent are the second-largest ethnic background in [[Argentina]], [[Uruguay]], and [[Brazil]], after Spanish and (in Brazil) Portuguese, but rank fourth in the United States among European groups. In the past decade, [[Romanians]] have primarily chosen Italy and Spain as emigration destinations, with Germany, the largest Western European country, ranking a distant third.

===Auxiliary languages as a solution===
Since the late 1800s, [[auxiliary languages]] have been available to help overcome the language barrier. They were traditionally written or ''constructed'' by a person or group. Originally, the idea was that two people who wanted to communicate could learn an auxiliary language with little difficulty and could use this language to speak or write to each other.

In the first half of the twentieth century, a second approach to auxiliary languages emerged: that there was no need to construct an auxiliary language, because the most widely spoken languages already had many words in common. These words could be developed into a simple language. People in many countries would understand this language when they read or heard it, because its words also occurred in their own languages. 

This approach addressed a perceived limitation of the available auxiliary languages: the need to convince others to learn them before communication could take place. The newer auxiliary languages could also be used to learn ethnic languages quickly and to better understand one's own language.

Examples of traditional auxiliary languages, sometimes called ''schematic languages'', are [[Esperanto]], [[Ido (language)|Ido]], and [[Volapük]]. Examples of the newer approach, sometimes called ''naturalistic languages'', are [[Interlingua]], [[Occidental language|Occidental]], and [[Latino Sine Flexione]]. Only Esperanto and Interlingua are widely used today, although Ido is also in use.

===Language barrier for international students in the United States===
Now, more and more students prefer to study abroad. Along other challenges of international travel, language barrier has become one of the greatest problems for international students, especially in America. Much research exists that shows the difficulties imposed by language barriers for these students, including helplessness and excess stress. Selvadurai mentioned the issue of language barriers, the dentification of classroom atmosphere, and faculty-student relationship difficulties for international students in his research, which was published in 1998. Of all the factors, he said that language is “the first barrier encountered by international students” (154).&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=f06ad517-6e3d-43b8-b51c-a320e43e76ab%40sessionmgr115&amp;vid=4&amp;hid=1111]{{dead link|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Chen, counseling instructor at the [[University of British Columbia]], not only will a language barrier cause anxiety for international students -- second language anxiety, educational stressors, and sociocultural stressors were identified by Chen as the three biggest challenges for international students (51-56).&lt;ref&gt;http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?sid=a6f80516-393d-4e60-a351-db19a3547d09%40sessionmgr104&amp;vid=1&amp;hid=112&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=aph&amp;AN=5179999&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition, students are also likely to experience social isolation, prejudice, and discrimination, "Foreign students rank negative attitudes and a lack of cultural sensitivity among US nationals as the greatest perceived barriers to successful intergroup relations."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Spencer-Rodgers|first=Julie|year=2002|title=Attitudes toward the culturally different: The role of intercultural communication barriers, affective responses...|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Julie_Spencer-Rodgers/publication/223370553_Attitudes_toward_the_culturally_different_The_role_of_intercultural_communication_barriers_affective_responses_consensual_stereotypes_and_perceived_threat/links/54b1c6520cf2318f0f93ef2a.pdf|journal=International Journal of Intercultural Relations|volume=|pages=23|via=ResearchGate|doi=10.1016/s0147-1767(02)00038-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; These students often face prejudice, isolation and discrimination because of the lack of second language proficiency, which in turn causes psychological problems within these individuals. International students cite experiencing negative issues such as, "awkwardness, anxiousness, uneasiness, self-consciousness, defensiveness, suspicion, hostility, and superiority" as well as positive outcomes such as, "admiration, respectfulness, happiness, comfortableness, confidence, interest, curiosity and inspiration."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There is some advice that has been discussed by scholars, to help international students ease into socially different environments. To alleviate the stress that these students experience, some scholars have suggested dealing with the problems with a positive attitude, while also advising the students to reach out for problem-solving resources, especially during their orientation period (Olivas and Li 219-220).&lt;ref&gt;http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?vid=4&amp;hid=112&amp;sid=cec043fd-a3f4-4fb4-a431-d03052bd7f26%40sessionmgr110&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=aph&amp;AN=22698184 &lt;/ref&gt;
As professor S.G. Nelson said in 1991 in his book,"''How Language is Life''", "Language is much more than a vocabulary of words. Language is how people express their feelings and show their individuality, and when different age groups are together, people of all ages must learn how to act around other groups."

===Language dominance after colonisation===
[[Nigeria]] was a British [[colony]] and was forced to use English. Nigerians spoke English rather than their own languages, and the use of English is rapidly spreading among the upper classes. The role of English in education is important, and English dominates the printed media. 
Although [[Education in Nigeria]] uses Nigerian languages, most Nigerians are more literate in English.

It is also exemplified throughout other British commonwealth or past colonised countries. It is also prevalent in the noncolonised countries that it has but with an underdeveloped economy whose education is limited and basic, such as Botswana. Other examples besides English include Portuguese in [[Angola]] and French in [[Mauritius]].

== Other uses of term ==

* SIL discusses "language as a major barrier to literacy" if a speaker's language is unwritten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sil.org/literacy/lit90/mothtong.htm |title=Mother Tongues: Breaking the language barrier |publisher=Sil.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Misconceptions ==

It is sometimes assumed that when multiple languages exist in a setting, there must therefore be multiple language barriers. Multilingual societies generally have [[lingua franca]]s and traditions of its members learning more than one language, an adaptation; while not entirely removing barriers of understanding, it belies the notion of impassable language barriers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nwaolikpe|first1=Nancy|first2=Onyinyechi|title=Culture and Nigerian Identity in the Print Media|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1476893534|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, there are an estimated 300 different languages spoken in London alone, but members of every ethnic group on average manage to assimilate into British society and be productive members of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phon.ucl.ac.uk/home/estuary/multiling.htm |title=Multilingual London |publisher=Phon.ucl.ac.uk |date=1999-03-29 |accessdate=2012-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''dinosaur park''' usually refers to a [[theme park]] in which several life-size sculptures or models of prehistoric animals, especially [[dinosaur]]s are displayed. The first dinosaur park worldwide was [[Crystal Palace Dinosaurs]], which opened in London in 1854. From 1977–1991 the largest dinosaur park in Europe was the [[Traumlandpark]] in Bottrop-Kirchhellen. The two biggest dinosaur [[theme park]]s in Germany today are the [[Dinosaur Park (Münchehagen)|Dinosaur Park at Münchehagen]] (Dinopark) and the [[Dinosaur Park (Kleinwelka)|Dinosaur Park at Kleinwelka]] with its neighbouring dinosaur garden of Großwelka. In addition there are also individual models in the open air as well as various dinosaur museums. Other dinosaur parks are listed below:

'''''Lone Survivor: The Eyewitness Account of Operation Redwing and the Lost Heroes of SEAL Team 10''''' (2007) is a [[non-fiction]] book written by [[Marcus Luttrell]] with assistance from novelist and ghostwriter [[Patrick Robinson (author)|Patrick Robinson]] and published by [[Little, Brown and Company]]. The narrative takes place in [[Afghanistan]], where the reader follows Marcus Luttrell and a group of [[U.S. Navy SEALs]].&lt;ref&gt;Amazon.com. Web. 15 Nov. 2009.&lt;https://www.amazon.com/Lone-Survivor-Eyewitness-Account-Operation/dp/0316067598&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It has since seen a 2013 [[Lone Survivor|film adaptation of the same name]], with [[Mark Wahlberg]] starring as Luttrell.

==Synopsis==
At the beginning of the book, Marcus Luttrell describes his childhood and his training to prepare for the [[Navy SEAL]]s with Billy Shelton. After joining the U.S. Navy and completing SEAL training, Luttrell describes his posting in Afghanistan, in the [[Hindu Kush]] mountains of the [[Kunar province]]. With him are the rest of [[SDVT-1]] (SEAL Delivery Vehicle Team 1), except [[Shane E. Patton]], for whom Danny Dietz was substituted. Their mission, [[Operation Red Wings]], was to observe a village and capture or kill a leading [[Taliban]] member thought to be allied with [[Osama bin Laden]].

One night in June 2005, while hiding out, the team encountered three shepherds, including a boy. The team debated killing the shepherds, but after a vote, team leader [[Michael P. Murphy|Michael Murphy]] decided to uphold the [[rules of engagement]] and let the shepherds go. About an hour later, the four SEALs were surrounded by a number of Taliban warriors. ''[[The New York Times]]'' sums up the story: {{quote|Mr. Luttrell was the only one of four men on the mission to survive after a violent clash with dozens of Taliban fighters.

Eight members of the SEALs and eight Army special operations soldiers who came by helicopter to rescue the original four were shot down, and all aboard were killed.

Luttrell was then rescued by a group of Afghan [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] villagers who harbored him in their homes for several days, protecting him from the Taliban and ultimately helping him to safety."|The New York Times, August 9, 2007&lt;ref name="Rich"&gt;{{cite news

==Reception==
Reviews of the book have been mostly positive. Conservative commentators [[Glenn Beck]] and [[Michelle Malkin]] have spoken their support. The book was also showcased on [[NBC]]'s ''[[Today (U.S. TV series)|The Today Show]]'' and [[CNN]]. The ''[[Washington Post]]'' wrote: "If you're looking for a true story that showcases both American heroism and Afghani [sic] humanity, Marcus Luttrell's ''Lone Survivor'' ... may be the book for you."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Accuracy==
There is some debate about the exact numbers of Taliban forces involved in the engagement, among other mistakes by some sources. In Luttrell's own official after-action report filed with his superiors after his rescue, he estimated the size of the Taliban force to be around 20–35. Initial [[Intelligence assessment|intel]] estimates were approximately 10-20.&lt;ref name="Ed_Darack_Marine_Corps_Gazette"/&gt; Official media reports from the military estimated the size of the Taliban force to be around 20, while in the Medal of Honor (MOH) citation for LT Michael P. Murphy, the Navy cited 30–40 enemies.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.navy.mil/moh/mpmurphy/oc.html |title=Official Citation |publisher=Navy.mil |date=June 28, 2005 |accessdate=2011-06-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090113085927/http://www.navy.mil/moh/mpmurphy/oc.html |archivedate=January 13, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Summary of Action related to the same MOH, the Navy cites an "enemy force of more than 50 anti-coalition militia".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.navy.mil/moh/mpmurphy/soa.html |title=Summary of Action |publisher=Navy.mil |date=June 28, 2005 |accessdate=2011-06-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140114090628/http://www.navy.mil/moh/mpmurphy/soa.html |archivedate=January 14, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book, ''Victory Point: Operations Red Wings and Whalers – the Marine Corps' Battle for Freedom in Afghanistan'', military journalist [[Ed Darack]] cites a military intelligence report stating the strength of the Taliban force to be 8–10, compared to the more than 200 claimed by Patrick Robinson in ''Lone Survivor''.

==Film adaptation==
{{main|Lone Survivor}}
Major studios including [[Warner Bros.]], [[Sony Pictures Entertainment|Sony Pictures]], [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]], [[DreamWorks]], and [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]] all put in bids for the film rights, with Universal eventually securing the rights in August 2007 for more than $2 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Finke|first=Nikki|title=‘Lone Survivor’ Book To Be Universal Film|url=http://www.deadline.com/2007/08/lone-survivor-book-to-be-a-universal-movie/|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|publisher=[[PMC (company)|PMC]]|date=August 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a June 2012 interview about his new book, ''Service: A Navy SEAL at War'', Luttrell was asked, "is a movie going to be made about ''Lone Survivor''"? He replied, "We will start shooting this September [2012]. It will star [[Mark Wahlberg]] who I spoke to a couple of times by phone. I want to make sure that the movie is true to the book. Most people get their information from movies and TV and don't read, so I want to make sure this movie is as realistic as possible."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blackfive.net/main/2012/06/review-interview-marcus-luttrells-service-a-navy-seal-at-war.html] June 2012 Blackfive.net interview&lt;/ref&gt;

The film, ''[[Lone Survivor]]'', stars [[Mark Wahlberg]], [[Taylor Kitsch]], [[Ben Foster]], [[Emile Hirsch]], [[Eric Bana]], and [[Alexander Ludwig]] and was released on January 10, 2014. It was directed by [[Peter Berg]].&lt;ref&gt;Tatiana Siegel, "Peter Berg's 'Lone Survivor' Boarded by Broadway and Film Financier Norton Herrick," ''The Hollywood Reporter'', November 14, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==
Margrit Brückner was born during the [[Aftermath of World War II|aftermath of war]] at [[Mennighüffen]]&lt;ref name="Bock2015"/&gt; or [[Rinteln]],&lt;ref name=MBlautTSP/&gt; in the countryside between [[Bielefeld]] and [[Hannover]].   She studied [[Sociology]] at [[Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz|Mainz]], [[Goethe University Frankfurt|Frankfurt]] and the [[London School of Economics]] between 1966 and 1972.&lt;ref name="Bock2015"/&gt;   In 1979 she accepted an appointment as a Professor for Sociology and Women's Studies at the [[Frankfurt University of Applied Sciences|Fachhochschule Frankfurt am Main (as the Applied Sciences University was then known)]].   At Frankfurt she participated actively in the [[Sozialistischer Deutscher Studentenbund|Socialist Student League]].   In 1969 she joined with others to establish the first "Frankfurt Women's Council" (''"Frankfurter Weiberrat"''),&lt;ref name=MBlautTSP/&gt; described later by one authority as "the nucleus of the Frankfurt women's movement".&lt;ref name=DankesredeMB&gt;{{cite web|work="... dem Nukleus der Frankfurter Frauenbewegung"|pages=19-22|title=Tony Sender Preis ... Dankesrede von Margrit Brückner|date=September 2014|publisher=Frauenreferat Frankfurt am Main|url=https://www.frankfurt.de/sixcms/media.php/738/Dokumentation-Tony-Sender-Preis_2013.pdf|accessdate=29 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a sixteen year old she had been a beneficiary of a new schools exchange programme and spent time at a school in a small town in the [[United States]], enabling her to improve her English language skills and acclimatize to the very different unwritten social rules governing the behaviour of school-age girls.&lt;ref name=DankesredeMB/&gt;   She returned across the Atlantic after receiving her first degree, undertaking a two year research stay at the Institute for the Study of Social Change ([[University of California]]). Brückner then received her doctorate from [[Goethe University Frankfurt|Frankfurt University]] in 1983.   Adumbrating her subsequent academic career, her [[:de:Elisabeth-Selbert-Preis|prize-winning]]&lt;ref name=MBlautFHSF/&gt; dissertation was entitled "Liebe der Frauen – über das Verhältnis von Weiblichkeit und Misshandlung" (''loosely "Love of women - on the relationship of the female condition and abuse"'').&lt;ref name=MBlautFHSF&gt;{{cite web|title=Margrit Brückner macht häusliche Gewalt sichtbar: Die Pionierin wird mit Symposium verabschiedet|work= Pressemitteilung von: Fachhochschule Frankfurt am Main|date=22 June 2012|url=https://www.openpr.de/news/642878/Margrit-Brueckner-macht-haeusliche-Gewalt-sichtbar-Die-Pionierin-wird-mit-Symposium-verabschiedet.html|publisher=Fachhochschule Frankfurt am Main|accessdate=30 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;   She also trained to become group analyst and supervisor (''" Gruppenanalytikerin und Supervisorin"''), terms which even she has subsequently struggled to translate into English.&lt;ref name=MBiGmJG/&gt;   It was again at [[Goethe University Frankfurt|Frankfurt University]] that in 2000 she received her [[habilitation]] (higher academic qualification), also receiving [[:de:Lehrberechtigung |"Venia legendi" (''loosely: "teaching rights"'')]] in [[Sociology]].   She has continued to teach and support sociology students at [[Frankfurt University of Applied Sciences|the Hochschule in Frankfurt]] up to and beyond her retirement in 2012.&lt;ref name=MBlautTSP/&gt;  Her research and campaigning work has continued to focus on care-work and care-networks, along with the life situations of women working in the sexual services field.

Since 2001, with Monika Simmel-Joachim, she has chaired the working group on [[Domestic violence]], an expert crime-prevention group established by the [[:de:Hessisches Ministerium der Justiz|regional Ministry for Justice]].&lt;ref name=HaeuslicheGewalt&gt;{{cite web|title=Konfliktfeld Häusliche Gewalt: Transformationsprozesse und Perspektiven der Frauenhausarbeit|author= Margrit Brückner|date=23 March 2018|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-658-20295-8_3|publisher= Springer International Publishing AG., CH-Cham|accessdate=29 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AMA Code of Medical Ethics.png|thumb|AMA Code of Medical Ethics]]

'''Medical ethics''' is a system of moral principles that apply values to the practice of clinical medicine and in scientific research. Medical ethics is based on a set of values that professionals can refer to in the case of any confusion or conflict. These values include the respect for autonomy, non-maleficence, beneficence, and justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Beauchamp|first=J.|year=2013|title=Principles of Biomedical Ethics|url=|journal=Principles of Biomedical Ethics|volume=7|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such tenets may allow doctors, care providers, and families to create a treatment plan and work towards the same common goal without any conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weise|first=Mary|year=2016|title=Medical Ethics Made Easy|url=http://journals.lww.com/professionalcasemanagementjournal/Abstract/2016/03000/Medical_Ethics_Made_Easy.5.aspx|journal=Professional Case Management|volume=21|issue=2|pages=88–94|via=|doi=10.1097/ncm.0000000000000151|pmid=26844716|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170401055745/http://journals.lww.com/professionalcasemanagementjournal/Abstract/2016/03000/Medical_Ethics_Made_Easy.5.aspx|archivedate=2017-04-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note that these four values are non-hierarchical, meaning no one principle routinely “trumps” another.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://depts.washington.edu/bioethx/tools/princpl.html|title=Bioethic Tools: Principles of Bioethics|website=depts.washington.edu|access-date=2017-03-21|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170510052851/http://depts.washington.edu/bioethx/tools/princpl.html|archivedate=2017-05-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term medical ethics first dates back to 1803, when English author and physician [[Thomas Percival]] published a document describing the requirements and expectations of medical professionals within medical facilities. The Code of Ethics was then adapted in 1847, relying heavily on Percival’s words.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Riddick|first=Frank|year=2003|title=The Code of Medical Ethics of the American Medical Association|pmc=3399321|journal=The Ochsner Journal|volume=5|issue=2|pages=6–10|via=|pmid=22826677}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years in 1903, 1912, and 1947, revisions have been made to the original document.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The practice of Medical Ethics is widely accepted and practiced throughout the world.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

There are several other codes of conduct. [[Hippocratic Oath|The Hippocratic Oath]] discusses basic principles for medical professionals. This document dates back to the fifth century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Riddick|first=Frank|date=Spring 2003|title=The Code of Medical Ethics of the American Medical Association|pmc=3399321|journal=The Ochsner Journal|volume=5 |issue=2|pages=6–10|pmid=22826677}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both [[Declaration of Helsinki|The Declaration of Helsinki]] (1964) and [[Nuremberg Code|The Nuremberg Code]] (1947) are two well-known and well respected documents contributing to medical ethics. Other important markings in the history of Medical Ethics include ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' in 1973 and the development of Hemodialysis in the 1960s. As this field continues to develop and change throughout history, the focus remains on fair, balanced, and moral thinking. Medical ethics encompasses a practical application in clinical settings as well as scholarly work on its history, philosophy, and sociology.

==History==
{{See also|List of medical ethics cases}}
Historically, [[Western world|Western]] medical ethics may be traced to guidelines on the [[duty]] of physicians in antiquity, such as the [[Hippocratic Oath]], and early [[Christian]] teachings. The first code of medical ethics, ''[[Formula Comitis Archiatrorum]]'', was published in the 5th century, during the reign of the [[Ostrogoths|Ostrogothic]] king [[Theodoric the Great]]. In the medieval and early modern period, the field is indebted to [[Medicine in the medieval Islamic world|Islamic scholarship]] such as [[Al-Ruhawi|Ishaq ibn Ali al-Ruhawi]] (who wrote the ''Conduct of a Physician'', the first book dedicated to medical ethics), [[Avicenna]]'s [[The Canon of Medicine|Canon of Medicine]] and [[Muhammad ibn Zakariya ar-Razi]] (known as Rhazes in the West), [[Judeo-Islamic philosophies (800–1400)|Jewish thinkers]] such as [[Maimonides]], [[Roman Catholic]] [[scholasticism|scholastic]] thinkers such as [[Thomas Aquinas]], and the case-oriented analysis ([[casuistry]]) of Catholic [[moral theology]]. These intellectual traditions continue in [[Catholic ethics|Catholic]], [[Islamic ethics#Medical ethics|Islamic]] and [[Jewish medical ethics]].

By the 18th and 19th centuries, medical ethics emerged as a more self-conscious discourse. In England, [[Thomas Percival]], a physician and author, crafted the first modern code of medical ethics. He drew up a pamphlet with the code in 1794 and wrote an expanded version in 1803, in which he coined the expressions "medical ethics" and "medical jurisprudence".&lt;ref&gt;[http://ethics.iit.edu/perspective/pers19_1fall99_2.html ''Codes of Ethics: Some History'', Center for the Study of Ethics in the Professions at IIT] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206204827/http://ethics.iit.edu/perspective/pers19_1fall99_2.html |date=2012-02-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are some who see Percival's guidelines that relate to physician consultations as being excessively protective of the home physician's reputation. Jeffrey Berlant is one such critic who considers Percival's codes of physician consultations as being an early example of the anti-competitive, "guild"-like nature of the physician community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berlant|first=Jeffrey|title=Profession and Monopoly: a study of medicine in the United States and Great Britain|journal=Medical History|volume=20|issue=3|pages=342|year=1975|isbn=978-0-520-02734-3|pmc=1081816}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Percival|first=Thomas|title=Medical ethics|publisher=John Henry Parker|pages=49–57 esp section 8 p. 52|url=https://books.google.com/?id=yVUEAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=medical+ethics|year=1849}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1815, the [[Apothecaries Act 1815|Apothecaries Act]] was passed by the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]. It introduced compulsory apprenticeship and formal qualifications for the apothecaries of the day under the license of the Society of Apothecaries. This was the beginning of regulation of the medical profession in the UK.

In 1847, the [[American Medical Association]] adopted its first [[ethical code|code of ethics]], with this being based in large part upon Percival's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uab.edu/reynolds/MajMedFigs/Percival.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-10-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060704201058/http://www.uab.edu/reynolds/MajMedFigs/Percival.htm |archivedate=2006-07-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; While the secularized field borrowed largely from Catholic medical ethics, in the 20th century a distinctively [[Mainline (Protestant)|liberal Protestant]] approach was articulated by thinkers such as [[Joseph Fletcher]]. In the 1960s and 1970s, building upon [[liberal theory]] and [[procedural justice]], much of the discourse of medical ethics went through a dramatic shift and largely reconfigured itself into [[bioethics]].&lt;ref&gt;Walter, Klein eds. ''The Story of Bioethics: From seminal works to contemporary explorations''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Well-known medical ethics cases include:
* [[Acres of Skin|Albert Kligman's dermatology experiments]]
* [[Deep sleep therapy]]
* [[Doctors' Trial]]

Since the 1970s, the growing influence of ethics in contemporary medicine can be seen in the increasing use of [[Institutional Review Board]]s to evaluate experiments on human subjects, the establishment of hospital ethics committees, the expansion of the role of clinician ethicists, and the integration of ethics into many medical school curricula.&lt;ref name="pmid19737406"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lakhan SE, Hamlat E, McNamee T, Laird C |title=Time for a unified approach to medical ethics |journal=Philosophy, Ethics, and Humanities in Medicine |volume=4 |issue=3 |year=2009 |pmid=19737406 |doi=10.1186/1747-5341-4-13 |page=13 |pmc=2745426}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Values==
A common framework used in the analysis of medical ethics is the "four principles" approach postulated by [[Tom Beauchamp]] and [[James Childress]] in their textbook ''Principles of biomedical ethics''. It recognizes four basic moral principles, which are to be judged and weighed against each other, with attention given to the scope of their application. The four principles are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gillon|first=R|title=Medical ethics: four principles plus attention to scope|journal=British Medical Journal|year=1994|volume=309|issue=184|pages=184|doi=10.1136/bmj.309.6948.184|pmc=2540719}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Respect for [[Autonomy#Medicine|autonomy]] – the patient has the right to refuse or choose their treatment. 
* [[Beneficence (ethics)|Beneficence]] – a practitioner should act in the best interest of the patient.
* Non-maleficence – to not be the cause of harm. Also, "Utility" - to promote more good than harm
* [[Justice (ethics)|Justice]] – concerns the distribution of scarce health resources, and the decision of who gets what treatment.

===Autonomy===
The principle of autonomy views the rights of an individual to self-determination. This is rooted in society's respect for individuals' ability to make informed decisions about personal matters with [[freedom]]. Autonomy has become more important as social values have shifted to define medical quality in terms of outcomes that are important to the patient and their family rather than medical professionals. The increasing importance of autonomy can be seen as a social reaction against the "[[paternalism|paternalistic]]" tradition within healthcare.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Murgic|first1=L.|last2=Hébert|first2=P.C.|last3=Sovic|first3=S.|last4=Pavlekovic|first4=G.|title=Paternalism and autonomy: views of patients and providers in a transitional (post-communist) country|journal=BMC Medical Ethics|volume=16|issue=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have questioned whether the backlash against historically excessive paternalism in favor of patient autonomy has inhibited the proper use of [[soft paternalism]] to the detriment of outcomes for some patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Pollard | first1 = B. J. | title = Autonomy and paternalism in medicine | journal = The Medical Journal of Australia | volume = 159 | issue = 11–12 | pages = 797–802 | year = 1993 | pmid = 8264472}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The definition of autonomy is the ability of an individual to make a rational, un-influenced decision. Therefore, it can be said that autonomy is a general indicator of a healthy mind and body. The progression of many terminal diseases are characterized by loss of autonomy, in various manners and extents. For example, dementia almost always results in the loss of autonomy. Dementia is a chronic and progressive disease that attacks the brain and affects the ability to make judgments, can induce memory loss, cause a decrease in rational thinking and affect orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Burla|first=Claudia|date=2014|title=Alzheimer, Dementia and the living will: a proposal|pmc=4078222|journal=Medicine, Healthcare and Philosophy|volume=17.3|issue=3|pages=389–395|doi=10.1007/s11019-014-9559-8|pmid=24737537}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Psychiatrists and clinical psychologists are often asked to evaluate a patient's capacity for making life-and-death decisions at the end of life. Persons with a psychiatric condition such as delirium or clinical depression may lack capacity to make end-of-life decisions. For these persons, a request to refuse treatment may be taken in the context of their condition. Unless there is a clear advance directive to the contrary, persons lacking mental capacity are treated according to their best interests. This will involve an assessment involving people who know the person best to what decisions the person would have made had they not lost capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bma.org.uk/advice/employment/ethics/mental-capacity/assessing-mental-capacity |title=Assessing mental capacity |publisher=BMA |date= |accessdate=2018-05-24 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180525062740/https://www.bma.org.uk/advice/employment/ethics/mental-capacity/assessing-mental-capacity |archivedate=2018-05-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Persons with the mental capacity to make end-of-life decisions may refuse treatment with the understanding that it may shorten their life.

===Beneficence===
The term beneficence refers to actions that promote the well being of others. In the medical context, this means taking actions that serve the best interests of patients and their families. However, uncertainty surrounds the precise definition of which practices do in fact help patients.

[[James Childress]] and [[Tom Beauchamp]] in ''Principle of Biomedical Ethics'' (1978) identify beneficence as one of the core values of [[healthcare ethics]]. Some scholars, such as [[Edmund D. Pellegrino|Edmund Pellegrino]], argue that beneficence is the ''only'' fundamental principle of medical ethics. They argue that healing should be the sole purpose of medicine, and that endeavors like [[cosmetic surgery]] and [[euthanasia]] are severely unethical and against the [[Hippocratic Oath]].

===Non-maleficence===
{{Main|Primum non nocere}}
The concept of non-maleficence is embodied by the phrase, "first, do no harm," or the Latin, ''[[primum non nocere]]''. Many consider that should be the main or primary consideration (hence ''primum''): that it is more important not to harm your patient, than to do them good, which is part of the hippocratic oath that doctors take.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jotterand|first=Fabrice|date=2005-01-01|title=The Hippocratic Oath and Contemporary Medicine: Dialectic Between Past Ideals and Present Reality?|url=https://academic.oup.com/jmp/article-abstract/30/1/107/893486|journal=The Journal of Medicine and Philosophy|language=en|volume=30|issue=1|pages=107–128|doi=10.1080/03605310590907084|pmid=15814370|issn=0360-5310|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180408015006/https://academic.oup.com/jmp/article-abstract/30/1/107/893486|archivedate=2018-04-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is partly because enthusiastic practitioners are prone to using treatments that they believe will do good, without first having evaluated them adequately to ensure they do no harm to the patient. Much harm has been done to patients as a result, as in the saying, "The treatment was a success, but the patient died." It is not only more important to do no harm than to do good; it is also important to ''know'' how likely it is that your treatment will harm a patient. So a physician should go further than not prescribing medications they know to be harmful—he or she should not prescribe medications (or otherwise treat the patient) unless s/he knows that the treatment is unlikely to be harmful; or at the very least, that patient understands the risks and benefits, and that the likely benefits outweigh the likely risks.

In practice, however, many treatments carry some risk of harm. In some circumstances, e.g. in desperate situations where the outcome without treatment will be grave, risky treatments that stand a high chance of harming the patient will be justified, as the risk of not treating is also very likely to do harm. So the principle of ''non-maleficence'' is not absolute, and balances against the principle of [[#Beneficence|''beneficence'']] (doing good), as the effects of the two principles together often give rise to a ''double effect'' (further described in next section). Even basic actions like taking a blood sample or an injection of a drug cause harm to the patient's body. [[Euthanasia]] also goes against the principle of beneficence because the patient dies as a result of the medical treatment by the doctor.
[[File:Turning the Mind Inside Out Saturday Evening Post 24 May 1941 a detail 2.jpg|thumb|Dr. Watts putting on gloves before surgery.]]

====Double effect====
{{Main|Principle of double effect}}
''Double effect'' refers to two types of consequences that may be produced by a single action,&lt;ref&gt;[http://medical.webends.com/kw/Double%20Effect Medical.Webends.com &gt; Double effect] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100905010101/http://medical.webends.com/kw/Double%2BEffect |date=2010-09-05 }} Retrieved September 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and in medical ethics it is usually regarded as the combined effect of beneficence and non-maleficence.&lt;ref&gt;Page 424 in:{{cite book|title=Primary hematology|author=Tefferi, Ayalew|publisher=Humana Press|year=2001|isbn=978-0-89603-664-2|location=Totowa, NJ|pages=|doi=|oclc=|accessdate=}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=vYqJoUFFM2wC&amp;pg=PA424&amp;lpg]&lt;/ref&gt;

A commonly cited example of this phenomenon is the use of [[morphine]] or other [[analgesic]] in the dying patient. Such use of morphine can have the beneficial effect of easing the pain and suffering of the patient while simultaneously having the maleficent effect of shortening the life of the patient through the deactivation of the respiratory system.&lt;ref name = Randall&gt;{{vcite book | author = Randall F | chapter = Ethical issues in cancer pain management | editor = Sykes N, Bennett MI &amp; Yuan C-S | title = Clinical pain management: Cancer pain | edition = 2nd | isbn = 978-0-340-94007-5 | publisher = Hodder Arnold | location = London | pages = 93–100 | year = 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Respect for human rights===

The [[human rights]] era started with the formation of the [[United Nations]] in 1945, which was charged with the promotion of human rights. The [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (1948) was the first major document to define human rights. Medical doctors have an ethical duty to protect the human rights and [[human dignity]] of the patient so the advent of a document that defines human rights has had its effect on medical ethics.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite web | author=World Medical Association | home=http://www.wma.net | title=Principal features of medical ethics | url=http://www.wma.net/en/30publications/30ethicsmanual/pdf/chap_1_en.pdf | date= | accessdate=3 November 2015 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304190742/http://www.wma.net/en/30publications/30ethicsmanual/pdf/chap_1_en.pdf | archivedate=4 March 2016 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most codes of medical ethics now require respect for the human rights of the patient.

The [[Council of Europe]] promotes the [[rule of law]] and observance of [[human rights in Europe]]. The Council of Europe adopted the ''European Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine'' (1997) to create a uniform code of medical ethics for its 47 member-states. The Convention applies [[international human rights law]] to medical ethics. It provides special protection of physical integrity for those who are unable to consent, which includes children. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
No organ or tissue removal may be carried out on a person who does not have the capacity to consent under Article 5.&lt;ref&gt;Article 20(1). ''[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/164.htm European Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109110632/http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/Treaties/html/164.htm |date=2013-11-09 }}'' (1997). Adopted at Oviedo, 4 April 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
As of December 2013, the Convention had been ratified or acceded to by twenty-nine member-states of the Council of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/ChercheSig.asp?NT=164&amp;CM=8&amp;DF=30/11/2013&amp;CL=ENG Table of Ratifications and Accessions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203061719/http://www.conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/ChercheSig.asp?NT=164&amp;CM=8&amp;DF=30%2F11%2F2013&amp;CL=ENG |date=2013-12-03 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO) also promotes the protection of human rights and [[human dignity]]. According to UNESCO, "Declarations are another means of defining norms, which are not subject to ratification. Like recommendations, they set forth universal principles to which the community of States wished to attribute the greatest possible authority and to afford the broadest possible support." UNESCO adopted the ''Universal Declaration on Human Rights and Biomedicine'' to advance the application of international human rights law in medical ethics. The Declaration provides special protection of human rights for incompetent persons. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In applying and advancing scientific knowledge, medical practice and associated technologies, human vulnerability should be taken into account. Individuals and groups of special vulnerability should be protected and the personal integrity of such individuals respected.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO. [http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=31058&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171010174232/http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID%3D31058%26URL_DO%3DDO_TOPIC%26URL_SECTION%3D201.html |date=2017-10-10 }}. Adopted by the UNESCO General Conference at Paris, 19 October 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Conflicts==

===Between autonomy and beneficence/non-maleficence===
Autonomy can come into conflict with beneficence when patients disagree with recommendations that healthcare professionals believe are in the patient's best interest. When the patient's interests conflict with the patient's welfare, different societies settle the conflict in a wide range of manners. In general, Western medicine defers to the wishes of a mentally competent patient to make their own decisions, even in cases where the medical team believes that they are not acting in their own best interests. However, many other societies prioritize beneficence over autonomy.

Examples include when a patient does not want a treatment because of, for example, religious or cultural views. In the case of [[euthanasia]], the patient, or relatives of a patient, may want to end the life of the patient. Also, the patient may want an [[Unnecessary health care|unnecessary treatment]], as can be the case in [[hypochondria]] or with [[cosmetic surgery]]; here, the practitioner may be required to balance the desires of the patient for medically unnecessary potential risks against the patient's informed autonomy in the issue. A doctor may want to prefer autonomy because refusal to please the patient's self-determination would harm the [[doctor-patient relationship]].

Individuals' capacity for informed decision-making may come into question during resolution of conflicts between autonomy and beneficence. The role of surrogate medical decision makers is an extension of the principle of autonomy.

On the other hand, autonomy and beneficence/non-maleficence may also overlap. For example, a breach of patients' autonomy may cause decreased confidence for medical services in the population and subsequently less willingness to seek help, which in turn may cause inability to perform beneficence.

The principles of autonomy and beneficence/non-maleficence may also be expanded to include effects on the relatives of patients or even the medical practitioners, the overall population and economic issues when making medical decisions.

===Euthanasia===
{{Main|Euthanasia}}

{{POV section|date=February 2012}}

There is disagreement among American physicians as to whether the non-maleficence principle excludes the practice of euthanasia. Euthanasia is currently legal in the states of Washington DC, California, Colorado, Oregon, Vermont, and Washington. Around the world, there are different organizations that campaign to change legislation about the issue of [[physician-assisted death]], or PAD. Examples of such organizations are the [[Hemlock Society]] of the United States and the [[Dignity in Dying]] campaign in the United Kingdom. These groups believe that doctors should be given the right to end a patient’s life only if the patient is conscious enough to decide for themselves, is knowledgeable about the possibility of alternative care, and has willingly asked to end their life or requested access to the means to do so.

This argument is disputed in other parts of the world. For example, in the state of Louisiana, giving advice or supplying the means to end a person’s life is considered a criminal act and can be charged as a felony. In state courts, this crime is comparable to manslaughter. The same laws apply in the states of Mississippi and Nebraska.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://site.ebrary.com/lib/michstate/reader.action?docID=10021934|title=Euthanasia, Ethics and Public Policy: an Argument against Legislation|last=Keown|first=John|date=2002|website=Protest ebrary|access-date=}}{{dead link|date=August 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Informed consent==
{{Main|Informed consent}}
{{citations needed|section|date=November 2018}}
Informed consent in ethics usually refers to the idea that a person must be fully informed about and understand the potential benefits and risks of their choice of treatment. A correlate to "informed consent" is the concept of [[informed refusal]]. An uninformed person is at risk of mistakenly making a choice not reflective of his or her values or wishes. It does not specifically mean the process of obtaining consent, or the specific legal requirements, which vary from place to place, for capacity to consent. Patients can elect to make their own medical decisions or can delegate decision-making authority to another party. If the patient is incapacitated, laws around the world designate different processes for obtaining informed consent, typically by having a person appointed by the patient or their [[next of kin]] make decisions for them. The value of informed consent is closely related to the values of [[autonomy]] and truth telling.

==Confidentiality==
{{Further|Confidentiality}}
Confidentiality is commonly applied to conversations between doctors and patients. This concept is commonly known as patient-physician privilege. Legal protections prevent physicians from revealing their discussions with patients, even under oath in court.

Confidentiality is mandated in [[United States|America]] by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=Health_Insurance_Portability_and_Accountability_Act|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; known as [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act|HIPAA]] , specifically the Privacy Rule, and various state laws, some more rigorous than HIPAA. However, numerous exceptions to the rules have been carved out over the years. For example, many states require physicians to report gunshot wounds to the police and impaired drivers to the Department of Motor Vehicles. Confidentiality is also challenged in cases involving the diagnosis of a sexually transmitted disease in a patient who refuses to reveal the diagnosis to a spouse, and in the termination of a pregnancy in an underage patient, without the knowledge of the patient's parents. Many states in the U.S. have laws governing parental notification in underage abortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncsl.org/IssuesResearch/Health/AbortionLaws/tabid/14401/Default.aspx#parent|title=Legislative News, Studies and Analysis - National Conference of State Legislatures|first=National Conference of State|last=Legislatures|website=www.ncsl.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100224232857/http://www.ncsl.org/IssuesResearch/Health/AbortionLaws/tabid/14401/Default.aspx#parent|archivedate=2010-02-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncsl.org/programs/health/aborlaws.htm |title=National Conference of State Legislatures &gt; Abortion Laws &gt; Parental Involvement in Minors' Abortions |publisher=Webarchive.loc.gov |date= |accessdate=2018-05-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20090429230410/http://www.ncsl.org/programs/health/aborlaws.htm |archivedate=2009-04-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, medical ethics has viewed the duty of confidentiality as a relatively non-negotiable tenet of medical practice. More recently, critics like Jacob Appel have argued for a more nuanced approach to the duty that acknowledges the need for flexibility in many cases.&lt;ref&gt;Appel, JM. Must My Doctor Tell My Partner? Rethinking Confidentiality In the HIV Era, ''Medicine and Health Rhode Island'', Jun 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Confidentiality is an important issue in [[primary care ethics]], where physicians care for many patients from the same family and community, and where third parties often request information from the considerable medical database typically gathered in primary health care.

==Control and resolution==
To ensure that appropriate ethical values are being applied within hospitals, effective [[hospital accreditation]] requires that ethical considerations are taken into account, for example with respect to physician integrity, [[conflict of interest]], research ethics and [[organ transplantation]] ethics.

===Guidelines===
There is much documentation of the history and necessity of the Declaration of Helsinki. The first code of conduct for research including medical ethics was the Nuremberg Code. This document had large ties to Nazi war crimes, as it was introduced in 1947, so it didn’t make much of a difference in terms of regulating practice. This issue called for the creation of the Declaration. There are some stark differences between the Nuremberg Code and the Declaration of Helsinki, including the way it is written. Nuremberg was written in a very concise manner, with a simple explanation. The Declaration of Helsinki is written with a thorough explanation in mind and including many specific commentaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goodyear|first=Micheal D.E|date=2007|title=The Declaration of Helsinki|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1777992607|journal=British Medical Journal|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, [[General Medical Council]] provides clear overall modern guidance in the form of its 'Good Medical Practice' statement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gmc-uk.org/guidance/good_medical_practice/index.asp |title=Good medical practice - GMC |publisher=Gmc-uk.org |date= |accessdate=2018-05-24 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081221112745/http://www.gmc-uk.org/guidance/good_medical_practice/index.asp |archivedate=2008-12-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other organizations, such as the [[Medical Protection Society]] and a number of university departments, are often consulted by British doctors regarding issues relating to ethics.

===Ethics committees===
Often, simple communication is not enough to resolve a conflict, and a hospital [[ethics committee]] must convene to decide a complex matter.

These bodies are composed primarily of healthcare professionals, but may also include [[philosopher]]s, lay people, and [[clergy]] – indeed, in many parts of the world their presence is considered mandatory in order to provide balance.

With respect to the expected composition of such bodies in the USA, Europe and Australia, the following applies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chrcrm.org/main/modules/pageworks/index.php?page=015&amp;id=231]{{dead link|date=September 2017|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
U.S. recommendations suggest that Research and Ethical Boards (REBs) should have five or more members, including at least one scientist, one non-scientist, and one person not affiliated with the institution. The REB should include people knowledgeable in the law and standards of practice and professional conduct. Special memberships are advocated for handicapped or disabled concerns, if required by the protocol under review.

The European Forum for Good Clinical Practice (EFGCP) suggests that REBs include two practicing physicians who share experience in biomedical research and are independent from the institution where the research is conducted; one lay person; one lawyer; and one paramedical professional, e.g. nurse or pharmacist. They recommend that a quorum include both sexes from a wide age range and reflect the cultural make-up of the local community.

The 1996 Australian Health Ethics Committee recommendations were entitled, "Membership Generally of Institutional Ethics Committees". They suggest a chairperson be preferably someone not employed or otherwise connected with the institution. Members should include a person with knowledge and experience in professional care, counseling or treatment of humans; a minister of religion or equivalent, e.g. Aboriginal elder; a layman; a laywoman; a lawyer and, in the case of a hospital-based ethics committee, a nurse.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The assignment of philosophers or religious clerics will reflect the importance attached by the [[society]] to the basic values involved. An example from [[Sweden]] with [[Torbjörn Tännsjö]] on a couple of such committees indicates [[secular]] trends gaining influence.

==Medical ethics in an online world==
In increasing frequency, medical researchers are researching activities in online environments such as discussion boards and bulletin boards, and there is concern that the requirements of informed consent and privacy are not applied, although some guidelines do exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Eysenbach G, Till JE |title=Ethical issues in qualitative research on internet communities |journal=BMJ |volume=323 |pages=1103–05 |year=2001 |doi=10.1136/bmj.323.7321.1103 |pmid=11701577 |issue=7321 |pmc=59687 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One issue that has arisen, however, is the disclosure of information. While researchers wish to quote from the original source in order to argue a point, this can have repercussions when the identity of the patient is not kept confidential. The quotations and other information about the site can be used to identify the patient, and researchers have reported cases where members of the site, bloggers and others have used this information as 'clues' in a game in an attempt to identify the site.&lt;ref name="Bruckman A 2002 217–31"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bruckman A|title=Studying the amateur artist: A perspective on disguising data collected in human subjects research on the Internet |journal=Ethics and Information Technology |volume=4 |pages=217–31 |year=2002 |doi=10.1023/A:1021316409277 |issue=3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some researchers have employed various methods of "heavy disguise."&lt;ref name="Bruckman A 2002 217–31"/&gt; including discussing a different condition from that under study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Turkle S|title=Constructions and Reconstructions of Self in Virtual Reality |journal=Mind, Culture, and Activity |volume=1 |issue=3 | pages=158–67 |year=1994 |doi=10.1080/10749039409524667}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Turkle S|title=Multiple subjectivity and virtual community at the end of the Freudian century |journal=Sociological Inquiry |volume=67 |issue=1 | pages=72–84 |year=1997 |doi=10.1111/j.1475-682X.1997.tb00430.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural concerns==
Culture differences can create difficult medical ethics problems. Some cultures have [[Spiritualism (beliefs)|spiritual]] or magical theories about the origins and cause of disease, for example, and reconciling these beliefs with the tenets of [[Medicine|Western medicine]] can be very difficult.

===Truth-telling===
Some cultures do not place a great emphasis on informing the patient of the diagnosis, especially when the diagnosis is serious. American doctors rarely used truth-telling especially in medical cases, up until the 1970s.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} In medicine{{clarify|date=October 2015}}, the principle of [[informed consent]] now takes precedence over other ethical values.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}. Additionally, The WMA International Code of Medical Ethics explicitly states, "A physician shall...report to the appropriate authorities those physicians who practice unethically or incompetently or who engage in fraud or deception."&lt;ref name="Medical ethics manual"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Williams|first1=John|title=Medical Ethics Manual|date=2015|publisher=World Medical Association|location=Ferney-Voltaire Cedex, France|isbn=978-92-990079-0-7|edition=3rd|url=http://www.wma.net/en/30publications/30ethicsmanual/pdf/ethics_manual_en.pdf|accessdate=February 11, 2016}}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=Ost316 |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also the conflict with physicians who are tempted to report made up incidents or make an incident worse than what it was for their own personal motives. In vice versa, a physician might be hesitant to report an incident because of personal friendship he or she may have with his or her colleague.&lt;ref name="Medical ethics manual" /&gt;

===Online business practices and privacy===
Healthcare websites have the responsibility to ensure that the private medical records of their online visitors are secure from being marketed and monetized into the hands of drug companies, occupation records, insurancers. The delivery of diagnosis online leads patients to believe that doctors in some parts of the country are at the direct service of drug companies, finding diagnosis as convenient as what drug still has patent rights on it.&lt;ref&gt;Rains S. A. Bosch L. A. Privacy and Health in the Information Age: A Content Analysis of Health Web Site Privacy Policy Statements. Health Communication. 2009 Vol. 24 s.l.&lt;/ref&gt; Physicians and drug companies are found to be competing for top ten search engine ranks to lower costs of selling these drugs with little to no patient involvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prnewsnow.com/Public_Release/Managed_Care_And_HMO/209319.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-09-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202045045/http://www.prnewsnow.com/Public_Release/Managed_Care_And_HMO/209319.html |archivedate=2008-12-02 |df= }}

&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Medical ethics#cite note-39|&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;]]

With the expansion of internet healthcare platforms, online practitioner legitimacy and privacy accountability face unique challenges such as e-paparazzi, online information brokers, industrial spies, unlicensed information providers that work outside of traditional medical codes for profit. The American Medical Association (AMA) states that medical websites have the responsibility to ensure the health care privacy of online visitors and protect patient records from being marketed and monetized into the hands of insurance companies, employers, and marketers. [[Medical ethics#cite note-40|[40]]]With the rapid unification of healthcare, business practices, computer science and e-commerce to create these online diagnostic websites, efforts to maintain health care system’s ethical confidentiality standard need to keep up as well. Over the next few years, the Department of Health and Human Services have stated that they will be working towards lawfully protecting the online privacy and digital transfers of patient Electronic Medical Records (EMR) under The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). [[Medical ethics#cite note-41|[41]]]

=== Humanitarian medical volunteerism ===
One concern regarding the intersection of medical ethics and humanitarian medical aid is how such assistance can be as harmful as it is helpful to the community being served. One such example being how political forces may control how foreign humanitarian aid can be utilized in the region it is meant to be provided in. This would be congruous in situations where political strife could lead such aid being used in favor of one group over another. Another example of how foreign humanitarian aid can be misused in its intended community includes the possibility of dissonance forming between a foreign humanitarian aid group and the community being served.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wisnewski|first=Jeremy|date=December 2015|title=Perceiving Sympathetically: Moral Perception, Embodiment, and Medical Ethics|doi=10.1007/s10912-015-9349-1|pmid=26164290|journal=Journal of Medical Humanities|volume=36|issue=4|pages=309–319}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of this could include the relationships being viewed between aid workers, style of dress, or the lack of education regarding local culture and customs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Asgary, Junck|first=Ramin, Emily|year=2013|title=New trends of short-term humanitarian medical volunteerism: professional and ethical considerations|url=|journal=Journal of Medical Ethics|volume=39|issue=10|pages=625–631|via=ProQuest|doi=10.1136/medethics-2011-100488|pmid=23236086}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conflicts of interest==
Physicians should not allow a [[conflict of interest]] to influence medical judgment. In some cases, conflicts are hard to avoid, and doctors have a responsibility to avoid entering such situations. Research has shown that conflicts of interests are very common among both academic physicians&lt;ref name="pmid12533125"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bekelman JE, Li Y, Gross CP |title=Scope and impact of financial conflicts of interest in biomedical research: a systematic review |journal=JAMA |volume=289 |issue=4 |pages=454–65 |year=2003 |pmid=12533125 |doi=10.1001/jama.289.4.454}}&lt;/ref&gt; and physicians in practice.&lt;ref name="pmid17374816"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ross JS, Lackner JE, Lurie P, Gross CP, Wolfe S, Krumholz HM |title=Pharmaceutical company payments to physicians: early experiences with disclosure laws in Vermont and Minnesota |journal=JAMA |volume=297 |issue=11 |pages=1216–23 |year=2007 |pmid=17374816 |doi=10.1001/jama.297.11.1216}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pew Charitable Trusts has announced the Prescription Project for "academic medical centers, professional medical societies and public and private payers to end conflicts of interest resulting from the $12 billion spent annually on pharmaceutical marketing".{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

===Referral===
Doctors who receive income from referring patients for medical tests have been shown to refer more patients for medical tests.&lt;ref name="pmid1406882"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1056/NEJM199211193272107 |vauthors=Swedlow A, Johnson G, Smithline N, Milstein A |title=Increased costs and rates of use in the California workers' compensation system as a result of self-referral by physicians |journal=N Engl J Med |volume=327 |issue=21 |pages=1502–6 |year=1992 |pmid=1406882}}&lt;/ref&gt; This practice is proscribed by the American College of Physicians Ethics Manual.&lt;ref name="pmid9518406 | "&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jordan, M. C. |title=Ethics manual. Fourth edition.

===Vendor relationships===
{{See also|Pharmaceutical marketing#To health care providers}}
Studies show that doctors can be influenced by drug company inducements, including gifts and food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Güldal D, Semin S |title=The influences of drug companies' advertising programs on physicians |journal=Int J Health Serv |volume=30 |issue=3 |pages=585–95 |year=2000 |pmid=11109183 |doi=10.2190/GYW9-XUMQ-M3K2-T31C}}&lt;/ref&gt; Industry-sponsored [[Continuing Medical Education]] (CME) programs influence prescribing patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wazana A |title=Physicians and the pharmaceutical industry: is a gift ever just a gift? |journal=JAMA |volume=283 |issue=3 |pages=373–80 |year=2000 |pmid=10647801 |doi=10.1001/jama.283.3.373|pmc=1488237 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many patients surveyed in one study agreed that physician gifts from drug companies influence prescribing practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Blake R, Early E |title=Patients' attitudes about gifts to physicians from pharmaceutical companies |journal=J Am Board Fam Pract |volume=8 |issue=6 |pages=457–64 |year=1995 |pmid=8585404}}&lt;/ref&gt; A growing movement among physicians is attempting to diminish the influence of pharmaceutical industry marketing upon medical practice, as evidenced by Stanford University's ban on drug company-sponsored lunches and gifts. Other academic institutions that have banned pharmaceutical industry-sponsored gifts and food include the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, University of Michigan, University of Pennsylvania, and Yale University.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.montereyherald.com/mld/montereyherald/living/health/16680875.htm ''LA Times'', "Drug money withdrawals: Medical schools review rules on pharmaceutical freebies"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312091308/http://www.montereyherald.com/mld/montereyherald/living/health/16680875.htm |date=2007-03-12 }}, posted 2/12/07, accessed 3/6/07&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/Research/OPC/Policy_Industry_Interaction/policy_interaction_industry.html ''JH Medicine Policy on Interaction with Industry''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111205021038/http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/Research/OPC/Policy_Industry_Interaction/policy_interaction_industry.html |date=2011-12-05 }} effective date July 1, 2009, accessed July 20, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Treatment of family members===
The [[American Medical Association]] (AMA) states that "Physicians generally should not treat themselves or members of their immediate family".&lt;ref&gt;American Medical Association Journal of Ethics May 2012, Volume 14, Number 5: 396-397&lt;/ref&gt; This code seeks to protect patients and physicians because professional objectivity can be compromised when the physician is treating a loved one. Studies from multiple health organizations have illustrated that physician-family member relationships may cause an increase in diagnostic testing and costs.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Chen FM, Feudtner C, Rhodes LA, Green LA | year = 2001 | title = Role conflicts of physicians and their family members: rules but no rulebook | url = | journal = Western Journal of Medicine | volume = 175 | issue = 4| pages = 236–239 | pmid=11577049| pmc = 1071568}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many doctors still treat their family members. Doctors who do so must be vigilant not to create conflicts of interest or treat inappropriately.&lt;ref name="pmid1922224"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1056/NEJM199110313251806 |vauthors=La Puma J, Stocking C, La Voie D, Darling C |title=When physicians treat members of their own families.

An analysis of the practice of physicians' treating their own families |journal=JAMA |volume=267 |issue=13 |pages=1810–2 |year=1992 |pmid=1545466 |doi=10.1001/jama.267.13.1810}}&lt;/ref&gt; Physicians that treat family members need to be conscious of conflicting expectations and dilemmas when treating relatives, as established medical ethical principles may not be morally imperative when family members are confronted with serious illness.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Sexual relationships===
Sexual relationships between doctors and patients can create ethical conflicts, since sexual consent may conflict with the [[fiduciary]] responsibility of the physician. Out of the many disciplines in current medicine, there are studies that have been conducted in order to ascertain the occurrence of Doctor-Patient sexual misconduct. Results from those studies appear to indicate that certain disciplines are more likely to be offenders than others. Psychiatrists and Obstetrician-Gynecologists for example, are two disciplines noted for having a higher rate of sexual misconduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Collier|first=Roger|date=March 2016|title=When the doctor-patient relationship turns sexual|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?p=AONE&amp;u=msu_main&amp;id=GALE&amp;#124;A444400220&amp;v=2.1&amp;it=r&amp;sid=summon&amp;authCount=1|journal=Canadian Medical Association Journal|volume=188|issue=4|pages=247–248|doi=10.1503/cmaj.109-5230|pmid=26858353|pmc=4771530}}&lt;/ref&gt; The violation of ethical conduct between doctors and patients also has an association with the age and sex of doctor and patient. Male physicians aged 40–49 and 50–59 years are two groups that have been found to be more likely to have been reported for sexual misconduct, while women aged 20–39 have been found to make up a significant portion of reported victims of sexual misconduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=AbuDagga, Wolfe, Carome, Oshel|first=Azza, Sidney, Michael, Robert|date=February 2016|title=Cross-Sectional Analysis of the 1039 U.S. Physicians Reported to the National Practitioner Data Bank for Sexual Misconduct, 2003–2013|journal=PLOS One|volume=11|issue=2|pages=e0147800|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0147800|pmid=26840639|pmc=4739584}}&lt;/ref&gt; Doctors who enter into sexual relationships with patients face the threats of losing their [[medical license]] and prosecution. In the early 1990s, it was estimated that 2-9% of doctors had violated this rule.&lt;ref name="pmid1441462"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gartrell N, Milliken N, Goodson W, Thiemann S, Lo B |title=Physician-patient sexual contact. Prevalence and problems |journal=West J Med |volume=157 |issue=2 |pages=139–43 |year=1992 |pmid=1441462 |pmc=1011231}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual relationships between physicians and patients' relatives may also be prohibited in some jurisdictions, although this prohibition is highly controversial.&lt;ref&gt;JM Appel. May Physicians Date Their Patients’ Relatives? Rethinking Sexual Misconduct &amp; Disclosure After Long v. Ostroff, Medicine &amp; Health, Rhode Island, May 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==Futility==
{{Further|Futile medical care}}
The concept of medical futility has been an important topic in discussions of medical ethics. What should be done if there is no chance that a patient will survive but the family members insist on advanced care? Previously, some articles defined futility as the patient having less than a one percent chance of surviving. Some of these cases are examined in court.

Advance directives include [[living wills]] and durable [[power of attorney|powers of attorney]] for health care. (''See also [[Do Not Resuscitate]] and [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]]'') In many cases, the "expressed wishes" of the patient are documented in these directives, and this provides a framework to guide family members and [[health care]] professionals in the decision-making process when the patient is incapacitated. Undocumented expressed wishes can also help guide decisions in the absence of advance directives, as in the [[Quinlan case]] in Missouri.

"Substituted judgment" is the concept that a family member can give consent for treatment if the patient is unable (or unwilling) to give consent themselves. The key question for the decision-making surrogate is not, "What would you like to do?", but instead, "What do you think the patient would want in this situation?".

Courts have supported family's arbitrary definitions of futility to include simple biological survival, as in the [[Baby K]] case (in which the courts ordered a child born with only a brain stem instead of a complete brain to be kept on a ventilator based on the religious belief that all life must be preserved).

In some hospitals, medical futility is referred to as "non-beneficial care."

[[Baby Doe Law]] establishes state protection for a disabled child's right to life, ensuring that this right is protected even over the wishes of parents or guardians in cases where they want to withhold treatment.

'''Midtown Atlanta''', or '''Midtown''', is a [[Urban area|high-density]] commercial and residential neighborhood of [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].  The exact geographical extent of the area is ill-defined due to differing definitions used by the city, residents, and local business groups.  However, the commercial core of the area is anchored by a series of [[High-rise building|high-rise]] office buildings, condominiums, hotels, and high-end retail along [[Peachtree Street]] between [[North Avenue (Atlanta)|North Avenue]] and 17th Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.midtownatl.com/_files/docs/spi-16-regulations-&amp;-design-guidelines_rdcd.pdf|title=Midtown Atlanta|last=|first=|date=2013|website=|publisher=Midtown Alliance|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Midtown, situated between [[Downtown Atlanta|Downtown]] to the south and [[Buckhead]] to the north, is the second-largest business district in [[Atlanta metropolitan area|Metro Atlanta]].  In 2011, Midtown had a resident population of 41,681 and a business population of 81,418.&lt;ref name="alliance"&gt;[http://www.midtownatl.com/_files/docs/midtown-demographics.pdf "Midtown Demographics", ''Midtown Alliance'' site, published 1/24/2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

Midtown attracts over 6 million visitors annually,&lt;ref name="midtownalliance.org"&gt;[http://www.midtownalliance.org/Documents/midtown_community.pdf Midtown Alliance, ''Midtown Market Report, 2007''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071021115222/http://www.midtownalliance.org/Documents/midtown_community.pdf|date=2007-10-21}}.  Retrieved June 3, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; mostly in connection with large annual events such [[Atlanta Pride]], the [[Atlanta Dogwood Festival]], and [[Music Midtown]].   Since the 1990s, Midtown has also been a primary area for high-density development due to the area's mass transit options, urban street grid, and desirability.&lt;ref name="midtownalliance.org" /&gt;

==Geography and nomenclature==
The definition and meaning of "Midtown" has varied over time, expanding from an original concept of a small neighborhood midway between Downtown and Buckhead. Boundary definitions vary by the source. In many cases, Midtown is a quasi-legal entity for zoning, law enforcement, and tax purposes. It is defined by the City of Atlanta to include the business district along Peachtree Street as well as [[Midtown Historic District (Atlanta, Georgia)|Historic Midtown]], the residential area east of [[Piedmont Avenue (Atlanta)|Piedmont Avenue]] and to the south of Piedmont Park. The Midtown Alliance defines a larger, "Greater Midtown" area of approximately four square miles. This includes the area within the city's definition, but splitting it into the sub-areas '''Midtown Core''' and '''Midtown Garden District''', i.e. [[Historic Midtown]]. It also includes the neighborhoods of [[Ansley Park]], [[Sherwood Forest (Atlanta)|Sherwood Forest]], [[Atlantic Station]], [[Home Park (Atlanta)|Home Park]], and [[Loring Heights (Atlanta)|Loring Heights]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.midtownatl.com/_files/docs/midtown-demographics.pdf "Demographics", Midtown Alliance]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.midtownatl.com/life/residential-neighborhoods/midtown-neighborhoods "Neighborhoods", Midtown Alliance]&lt;/ref&gt;

The area has gone by other names in the past. An 1897 source refers to the area as North Atlanta, which would later be the name of today's city of [[Brookhaven, Georgia|Brookhaven]]. The 1897 "North Atlanta" encompassed (roughly) most of today's Midtown, [[Georgia Tech]], and [[English Avenue]].&lt;ref&gt;"Suburbs will not be annexed now: The Rice measure tabled by Council yesterday afternoon", ''Atlanta Constitution'', October 27, 1897. North Atlanta was defined as the area including today's Midtown between Myrtle St. in the [[Midtown Historic District (Atlanta, Georgia)|Midtown Historic District]] and Cherry St., now inside the Georgia Tech campus, as far north as 14th St (then called Wilson Ave.); most of what is now the Georgia Tech campus, south of what was then 5th Street; and the area west of Georgia Tech, south of Jefferson St., as far west as Ashby St. (now Lowery Blvd.), including today's English Avenue neighborhood.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/atlantayesterday00horn/atlantayesterday00horn_djvu.txt "City limits extended to take in Pittsburg, Reynoldstown, Bellwood and North Atlanta" in  John R.

==History==
[[File:Midtown Atlanta 1895.jpeg|thumb|left|Map of part of Midtown Atlanta, 1895]]
The southern half of Midtown between 8th Street and North Ave was originally purchased by [[Richard Peters (Atlanta)|Richard Peters]] in 1848 to use the pine forest there for fuel for his downtown flour mill. Over the next 40 years, Peters slowly subdivided sections of these land lots off for a gridded residential area and built his own home there on Peachtree at 4th Street. His son, Edward, built his home on the block bounded by North Avenue, [[Piedmont Avenue (Atlanta)|Piedmont Avenue]], Ponce de Leon Avenue, and Myrtle Street. The home, now called [[Edward C. Peters House|Ivy Hall]], was restored by the Savannah College of Art &amp; Design in 2008 and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/nr//travel/atlanta/pet.htm|title=National Park Service: Edward C. Peters House | publisher= National Park Service |accessdate=2010-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], Peachtree between what is now 8th and 12th streets was still about a mile beyond the city limits, which ended at Pine Street.&lt;ref&gt;[[Atlanta ward system]]&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[American Civil War]] a shantytown named [[Tenth Street (Atlanta)|Tight Squeeze]] developed at Peachtree at what is now 10th Street. It was infamous for vagrancy, desperation, robberies of merchants transiting the settlement.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=hBgF5_3xzEQC&amp;pg=PA746 ''Atlanta and Environs: A Chronicle of Its People and Events, 1820s-1870s'', p.746, Franklin M. Garrett]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=2MqTAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA19 ''Wicked Atlanta: The Sordid Side of Peach City History'', p.19, Laurel-Ann Dooley]&lt;/ref&gt; As Atlanta grew ever further outwards from its historic center, mansions were constructed along Peachtree Street and the area around [[Tenth Street (Atlanta)|10th]] was known as [[Tenth Street (Atlanta)|Blooming Hill]]. Cross streets were built and residential development began around 1880. Piedmont Park was established with the [[Piedmont Exposition]] of 1887, followed by the [[Cotton States and International Exposition]] of 1895, lending the area new prominence. Electric streetcar lines extended along Piedmont Avenue by 1895 and along Peachtree Street (to [[Brookwood (Atlanta)|Brookwood]]) by 1900.&lt;ref name=jones&gt;[http://tomitronics.com/old_buildings/margaretmitchell/history.html Tommy H. Jones, "Margaret Mitchell House: Historical Context"]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1904, development on [[Ansley Park]] began.&lt;ref name=jones/&gt; By the 1920s, [[Tenth Street (Atlanta)|Tenth and Peachtree]] had become the nexus of a [[Tenth Street (Atlanta)|significant shopping district]] for the surrounding neighborhood.&lt;ref&gt;[http://preservemidtownatlanta.org/MidtownHistory.html Tommy Jones, "Midtown History", Midtown Local Historic District site] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120120190543/http://preservemidtownatlanta.org/MidtownHistory.html |date=2012-01-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1910 ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' listed Peachtree Street in Midtown as one of the finest residential areas of the city, along with Ponce de Leon Circle (now Ponce de Leon Avenue), [[Washington-Rawson|Washington Street]], and [[Inman Park]].

The [[Downtown Connector]] freeway opened in the 1950s, and the blocks between Williams Street and Techwood Drive were demolished to make way for it. In 1959 [[Lenox Square]] and in 1964, [[Ansley Mall]] opened, and the [[Tenth Street (Atlanta)|Tenth Street shopping district]] went into decline. By the late 1960s, Peachtree Street between Eighth and Fourteenth Streets had become a center of hippie culture known as [[Tenth Street (Atlanta)|The Strip]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thestripproject.com/TheStripProject/Peachtree_Strip.html The Strip].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jones/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mankin, Bill.

Large-scale commercial development began with [[Colony Square]], the first [[mixed-use development]] in the Southeast, which was built between 1969 and 1973. The [[Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority|MARTA]] subway line opened in 1981. In the 1980s, many older properties were demolished, some remaining vacant for decades. High-density commercial and residential development took root in the north–south corridor along Peachtree and West Peachtree. The BellSouth Center (1982), now the [[AT&amp;T Midtown Center]], was long the landmark skyscraper in the area. However, commercial development escalated after 1987, when [[One Atlantic Center]] was completed.

[[File:Oct 5 003.jpg|thumb|right|Bungalows in the Midtown Historic District]]
The 2000s decade saw the construction of numerous high-rise condo buildings in Midtown, such as the [[Spire (Atlanta)|Spire]], Viewpoint, and [[1010 Midtown]]. In 2006, then-Mayor [[Shirley Franklin]] set in motion a plan to make the 14-block stretch of [[Peachtree Street]] a street-level shopping destination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.midtownalliance.org/RET_Vision.htm|title=Expert: Peachtree Poised to Be Next Great Shopping Street|publisher=Midtown Alliance|accessdate=2007-06-26|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070530120727/http://www.midtownalliance.org/RET_Vision.htm|archivedate=2007-05-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.midtownalliance.org/RET_ICSC.html|title=Mayor to Retailers: Peachtree Is Open for Business|publisher=Midtown Alliance|accessdate=2007-06-26|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070530103050/http://www.midtownalliance.org/RET_ICSC.html|archivedate=2007-05-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2004 opening of the Seventeenth Street Bridge over the [[Downtown Connector]] reconnected Midtown with the west side of the city and to the [[Atlantic Station]] mixed-use development, which was built on the former site of the Atlantic Steel company.

The Midtown Alliance, a group of volunteers, employees, and business and community members, was formed in 1978 in order to work towards improving the overall quality of life in Midtown and transform it into an ideal place for people to actively live, work, and play. Activities of the Alliance include improving the neighborhood safety, developing area arts and education programs, and building community leaders. The master plan from the Alliance, called Blueprint Midtown, is credited with fueling the economic resurgence that has helped the once downtrodden Midtown area transform over the past number of years into a popular neighborhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ajc.com/cobb/content/metro/northfulton/stories/2007/12/12/blueprints_1213_web.html |title=Business Coalition wants new master plan for Ga. 400 |accessdate=2007-12-12 |date=2007-12-12 |work=[[Atlanta Journal Constitution]] }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture and historic districts==
[[File:Fox Theatre Atlanta.jpg|thumb|The [[Fox Theatre (Atlanta, Georgia)|Fox Theatre]], a cultural icon of Atlanta]]
In the early 1980s, Midtown Atlanta was a blighted area mainly consisting of parking lots. By 1987, [[One Atlantic Center]] was built on the corner of West Peachtree Street and 14th Street, which kick-started the redevelopment of the area. Some contemporary buildings of note are:
*[[High Museum of Art]] by [[Richard Meier]] and [[Renzo Piano]]
*[[One Atlantic Center]] by [[Philip Johnson]]
*[[1100 Peachtree]]
*[[1180 Peachtree]]
*[[AT&amp;T Midtown Center]]

*[[Promenade II]]
*[[Spire (Atlanta)|Spire]]

In the area surrounding [[Peachtree Street]], very little of the original architecture was preserved. Some of the notable exceptions listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] include the [[Margaret Mitchell House]], [[Rhodes Hall]], [[Edward C. Peters House]], and the [[Academy of Medicine (Atlanta, Georgia)|Academy of Medicine]].

Historic districts include the [[Fox Theatre Historic District]] and [[Midtown Historic District (Atlanta, Georgia)|Historic Midtown]]; both are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. The Fox Theatre Historic District comprises the [[Fox Theater (Atlanta)|Fox Theatre]] (Oliver Vinour et al., 1929), [[William Lee Stoddart]]'s [[Georgian Terrace Hotel]] (1911), Stoddart's [[Italianate architecture|Italianate]] Ponce de Leon Apartments (1913), and the [[Hotel Indigo Atlanta Midtown|Cox-Carlton Hotel]] (1925). Historic Midtown, which includes most of Midtown east of [[Piedmont Avenue (Atlanta)|Piedmont Avenue]], is noted for its [[bungalow]]s and [[Queen Anne style architecture|Queen Anne]] style houses.

==Parks and recreation==
[[File:Bridge over lake clara meer.JPG|thumb|Bridge over Lake Clara Meer in Midtown's Piedmont Park]]
Midtown's focal point is the expansive greenspace of [[Piedmont Park]], which underwent a major expansion in 2011. The park is surrounded by the Midtown business district to its west, Ansley Park to its northwest, the [[BeltLine]], [[Morningside-Lenox Park|Morningside]], and [[Virginia Highland]] to its east, and the Midtown Historic District to its south. The [[Atlanta Botanical Garden]] adjoins the Park.

The [[BeltLine]] is a {{convert|22|mi|km|adj=mid|-long}} trail circling the older neighborhoods of central Atlanta which will be developed in stages. The BeltLine [[Eastside Trail]] connects Piedmont Park (at the intersection of 10th and Monroe) to the [[Inman Park]] [[Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority|MARTA]] station at DeKalb Avenue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://clatl.com/freshloaf/archives/2010/06/19/1534336-beltline-gets-5-million-for-piedmont-park-dekalb-ave-bike-trail Thomas Wheatley, "Beltline gets $5 million for Piedmont Park-DeKalb Ave. bike trail", Creative Loafing, 2010-06-19]&lt;/ref&gt; The [https://archive.is/20110814081230/http://artonthebeltline.org/ "Art on the BeltLine"] project has resulted in the installation of several contemporary art pieces on the trail.

== Midtown Ecodistrict ==
Ecodistricts are being implemented in leading cities around the world and Midtown has just completed a process to create [[Atlanta]]'s first ecodistrict.

The Midtown Ecodistrict was created in 2012 as a platform for the community to collaborate on initiatives that results in improved environmental and economic performance. The program focuses on measurement on sustainability methods throughout the company. Green operational practices in the areas of energy, water, transportation and waste were implemented in an effort to make Midtown one of the most livable, vibrant and sustainable districts in the country.

In 2014, Midtown Alliance (who created the ecodistrict) decided to highlight business and buildings in Midtown that have made a significant commitment to green practices. This district is heavily urbanized ([[building]]s, shops, [[skyscraper]] and [[hotel]]s). Midtown also serves cyclists and pedestrians with 5 miles of bike lanes. The restaurants established in Midtown are recycling and composting at least 95% . 50 recycling cans have been installed.

The '''Mummification Museum''' is an [[archaeological museum]] in [[Luxor]], [[Upper Egypt]]. It is dedicated to the art of [[Ancient Egypt]]ian [[Mummy|mummification]].

==Location==
The museum is located in the city of Luxor, the ancient [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]]. It stands on the [[corniche]] in front of the Mina Palace Hotel, situated to the north of the [[Luxor Temple]] overlooking the [[Nile]] river.

==Aim==
The museum is intended to provide visitors with an understanding of the ancient art of mummification.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lonelyplanet.com/egypt/nile-valley/luxor/sights/museums-galleries/mummification-museum&lt;/ref&gt; The Ancient Egyptians applied [[embalming]] techniques to many species, not only to dead humans. [[Animal mummy|Mummies]] of [[Cats in ancient Egypt|cats]], fish and crocodiles are on display in this unique museum, where one can also get an idea of the tools used.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lonelyplanet.com/egypt/nile-valley/luxor/sights/museums-galleries/mummification-museum&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The story of this museum began when the Egyptian president decreed that the responsibility of the former visitor centre building was to be transferred from the tourism ministry to that of culture (and, specifically, the [[Supreme Council of Antiquities]]). 
It was opened by [[Hosni Mubarak|President Hosni Mubarak]] in 1997.

==Halls==
[[File:Mummy Masaherta Smith.JPG|thumb|The mummy of the [[21st Dynasty]] [[High Priest of Amun]], [[Masaharta]], formerly housed at the [[Egyptian Museum]]]]
The museum, located in the former visitor center,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lonelyplanet.com/egypt/nile-valley/luxor/sights/museums-galleries/mummification-museum&lt;/ref&gt; covers an area of 2035 m² 
and contains the following elements:

*Hall of artifacts 
*Lecture hall 
*Video room 
*Cafeteria

The hall of artifacts is divided into two parts, the first one is ascended corridor through which the visitor could have a look on ten tablets were drawn from the papyri of [[Papyrus of Ani|Ani]] and [[Hu-nefer]] that displayed in the [[British Museum]] in London. Most of these tablets throw lights on the funeral journey from death to burial. The second part of the museum began from the end of the corridor and the visitor could see more than sixty pieces, which are displayed in 19 well-advanced cases.

In those 19 display cases, the artefacts are concentrated on eleven topics:

*[[Egyptian mythology|Gods of ancient Egypt]]
*Embalming materials 
*Organic materials 
*Embalming fluid
*Tools of mummification 
*[[Canopic jar]]s 
*[[Ushabti]]s
*[[Amulet]]s 
*Coffin of Padiamun 
*Mummy of [[Masaharta]] 
*Mummified animals

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3929">''''Nighthawking'''' is a term used by Britain's metal detecting community to describe the theft of archaeological artifacts from protected archaeological sites and areas under the cover of darkness.

==Nighthawking and the law==
Nighthawking breaks the law on a number of points:

#''[[Trespass]]'': Nighthawking is often performed on private land where permission to survey and dig has been refused. Any disturbance with the land or dispersal of any substance makes it aggravated trespass which is more routinely prosecuted.
#''Digging on scheduled sites'': Digging on any sites which are [[scheduled monument]]s without prior consent from the [[Secretary of State]] for [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport|Culture, Media and Sport]] is illegal.
#Declaration of treasure: The [[Treasure Act 1996]] requires all finds that are legally defined as treasure to be declared to a local coroner or the police within 14 days. Nighthawkers rarely declare their finds due to the method of acquisition. Breach of this law can result in a £5,000 fine, a term of imprisonment up to three months or both.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.opsi.gov.uk/ACTS/acts1996/1996024.html&lt;/ref&gt;
#''[[Theft]]'': In Britain, ownership of finds on private lands, unless declared treasure, rests with the land owners.

==Impact on metal detecting in the United Kingdom==
Nighthawkers, being criminals, are distinct from law-abiding [[Metal detector#As a hobby|metal detectorists]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://nighthawking.thehumanjourney.net/prd.htm NightHawks - more info&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hobbyist]] groups as The National Council for Metal Detecting&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ncmd.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[Federation of Independent Detectorists]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://fid.newbury.net/html/code.htm The Federation of Independent Detectorists&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; are not to be confused with such criminal activity. Furthermore, it has been claimed, but not proven,  that nighthawkers use such groups as a method of obtaining information about archaeological sites. It has also been claimed that criminal gangs have been directed to archaeological sites by rogue archaeologists seeking a share of ill-gotten spoils.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

Despite the similarities between the two groups, nighthawking has not had a detrimental effect on the reputation of legitimate metal detectorists, who are held in high esteem having contributed over 812,000 items to the records of the Portable Antiquities Scheme.

==Nighthawking and the Oxford Archaeology study==

Nighthawking was the subject of a study&lt;ref&gt;[http://thehumanjourney.net//index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=192&amp;Itemid=40 Nighthawks Study&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  undertaken by [[Oxford Archaeology]] and collectively funded by [[English Heritage]], [[Cadw]], [[Historic Scotland]], [[National Museum]], [[National Museum of Wales]] and the [[Portable Antiquities Scheme]]. The primary aim of the study,  '' 'Nighthawks and Nighthawking: Damage to Archaeological Sites in the United Kingdom and Crown Dependencies caused by illegal searching and removal of antiquities' '', was to assess the level of damage caused by Nighthawking to British archaeological heritage and to study the adequacy of current law in dealing with Nighthawking. The review, which cost the taxpayer £66,000,  proved that over the ten-year study period, attacks on archaeological sites equated to fewer than 1.5 incidents a month and was far from the crimewave some archaeologists believed it to be.

Other relevant bodies associated with the study are [[Archaeology Guernsey]], [[Jersey Heritage Trust]], [[Manx National Heritage]], [[National Museums Scotland]] and the [[Northern Ireland Environment Agency]].

'''Prehistoric warfare''' refers to [[war]] that occurred between societies without [[recorded history]].

The existence — and even the definition — of war in humanity's hypothetical [[state of nature]] has been a controversial topic in the [[history of ideas]] at least since [[Thomas Hobbes]] in [[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|''Leviathan'']] (1651) argued a [[Bellum omnium contra omnes|"war of all against all"]], a view directly challenged by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] in a ''[[Discourse on Inequality]]'' (1755) and ''[[The Social Contract]]'' (1762).

[[File:Bifaz de Atapuerca (TG10).jpg|thumb|Quartzite hand axe]]

According to cultural anthropologist and ethnographer [[Raymond C. Kelly]], the earliest [[hunter-gatherer]]  societies of ''[[Homo erectus]]'' population density was probably low enough to avoid armed conflict. The development of the throwing-[[spear]], together with ambush hunting techniques, made potential violence between hunting parties very costly, dictating cooperation and maintenance of low population densities to prevent competition for resources. This behavior may have accelerated the [[Early hominin expansions out of Africa|migration out of Africa]] of ''H. erectus'' some 1.8 million years ago as a natural consequence of conflict avoidance.

Some scholars believe that this period of "Paleolithic warlessness" persisted until well after the appearance of ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' some 200,000 years ago, ending only at the occurrence of economic and social shifts associated with [[sedentism]], when new conditions incentivized organized raiding of settlements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kelly|first1=Raymond C.|authorlink1=Raymond C.

but there are depictions of human beings pierced with arrows

==Epipaleolithic==
The most ancient [[archaeological record]] of what could have been a prehistoric massacre is at the site of [[Jebel Sahaba]], committed by the [[Natufians]] against a population associated with the [[Qadan culture]] of far northern [[Sudan]]. 
The cemetery contains a large number of skeletons that are approximately 13,000 to 14,000 years old, almost half of them with [[arrowhead]]s embedded in their skeletons, which indicates that they may have been the casualties of warfare.&lt;ref&gt;Antoine D., Zazzo A., Freidman R., "Revisiting Jebel Sahaba: New Apatite Radiocarbon Dates for One of the Nile Valley’s Earliest Cemeteries", ''American Journal of Physical Anthropology Supplement'' 56: 68 (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.britishmuseum.org/violence-and-climate-change-in-prehistoric-egypt-and-sudan/ |title=Violence and climate change in prehistoric Egypt and Sudan |date=14 July 2014 |first=Renée |last=Friedman |publisher=[[British Museum]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been noted that the violence, if dated correctly, likely occurred in the wake of a local ecological crisis.&lt;ref&gt;https://muse.jhu.edu/article/2060/pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

At the site of [[Nataruk]] in Turkana, Kenya, numerous 10,000-year-old human remains were found with possible evidence of major traumatic injuries, including obsidian bladelets embedded in the skeletons, that should have been lethal. According to the original study, published in January 2016, the region was a "fertile lakeshore landscape sustaining a substantial population of hunter-gatherers" where pottery had been found, suggesting storage of food and [[sedentism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Inter-group violence among early Holocene hunter-gatherers of West Turkana, Kenya|url = http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nature16477|journal = Nature|pages = 394–398|volume = 529|issue = 7586|doi = 10.1038/nature16477|first = M.

The initial report concluded that the bodies at Nataruk were not interred, but were preserved in the positions the individuals had died at the edge of a lagoon. However, evidence of blunt-force cranial trauma and lack of interment have been called into question, casting doubt upon the assertion that the site represents early intragroup violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stojanowski|first1=Christopher M.|last2=Seidel|first2=Andrew C.|last3=Fulginiti|first3=Laura C.|last4=Johnson|first4=Kent M.|last5=Buikstra|first5=Jane E.|title=Contesting the massacre at Nataruk|journal=Nature|volume=539|issue=7630|doi=10.1038/nature19778|pmid=27882979|pages=E8–E10|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Morella (combate-de-arquero.png|thumb|Cave painting of a battle between archers, Morella la Vella, Spain.]]
The earliest, limited evidence for war in [[Mesolithic Europe]] likewise dates to ca. 10,000 years ago, and episodes of warfare appear to remain "localized and temporarily restricted" during the Late Mesolithic to Early Neolithic period in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Fry (2013), [https://books.google.com/books?id=RnIRDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA199#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 199].&lt;/ref&gt;

A group of three archers encircled by a group of four is found in Cueva del Roure,   Morella la Vella, Castellón, Valencia.

Early war was influenced by the development of [[Bow (weapon)|bow]]s, [[mace (bludgeon)|maces]], and [[Sling (weapon)|sling]]s. The bow seems to have been the most important weapon in early warfare, in that it enabled attacks to be launched with far less risk to the attacker when compared to the risk involved in [[Mêlée|mêlée combat]].  While there are no cave paintings of battles between men armed with clubs, the development of the bow is concurrent with the first known depictions of organized warfare consisting of clear illustrations of two or more groups of men attacking each other.  These figures are arrayed in lines and columns with a distinctly garbed leader at the front. Some paintings even portray still-recognizable [[military tactics|tactics]] like [[flanking maneuver|flankings]] and [[List of military tactics#Offensive tactics|envelopment]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Keeley, War Before Civilization, 1996, Oxford University Press, pg.45, Fig. 3.1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neolithic==
Systemic warfare appears to have been a direct consequence of the [[sedentism]] as it developed in the wake of the [[Neolithic Revolution]].
An important example is the massacre of [[Talheim Death Pit]] (near [[Heilbronn]], [[Germany]]), dated right on the cusp of the beginning European Neolithic, at 5500 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Lee (2015), [https://books.google.com/books?id=hbyYCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA18  p. 18].&lt;/ref&gt;
More recently, a similar site was discovered at Schöneck-Kilianstädten, with the remains of the victims showing "a pattern of intentional mutilation".&lt;ref&gt;Christian Meyer et al., "The massacre mass grave of Schöneck-Kilianstädten reveals new insights into collective violence in Early Neolithic Central Europe", PNAS   vol. 112 no. 36 (2015),  11217–11222, doi: 10.1073/pnas.1504365112.
&lt;/ref&gt;
While the presence of such massacre sites in the context of Early Neolithic Europe is undisputed, diverging definitions of "warfare proper" (i.e. planned campaigns sanctioned by society as opposed to spontaneous massacres) has led to  scholarly debate on the existence of warfare in the narrow sense prior to the development of city states in 20th-century archaeology. In the summary of Heath (2017), accumulating archaeology has made it "increasingly harder" to argue for the absence of organised warfare in Neolithic Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Julian Maxwell Heath, ''Warfare in Neolithic Europe '' (2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

Warfare in pre-Columbian North America has served as an important comparandum in the archaeological study of the indirect evidence for warfare in the Neolithic. A notable example is the massacre at the [[Crow Creek Site]] in [[South Dakota]] (14th century).&lt;ref&gt;[http://perfectirishgifts.com/blog/2008/06/prehistoric_massacres_the_twin.html The Perfect Gift: Prehistoric Massacres.

==Chalcolithic to Bronze Age==
{{anchor|Bronze Age}}
[[File:Museum of ScotlandDSCF6306.jpg|thumb|Bronze swords from the [[Museum of Scotland]].]]

The onset of the [[Copper Age|Chalcolithic]] (Copper Age) saw the introduction of copper weapons.   Organised warfare between early [[Cities of the Ancient Near East|city state]]s was in existence by the mid-5th millennium BC.  Excavations at [[Mersin]], [[Anatolia]] show the presence of fortifications and soldiers' quarters by 4300 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Martin A. Nettleship, Dale Givens, ''War, its Causes and Correlates'',  Walter de Gruyter (1975), [https://books.google.com/books?id=E00Fihw6CosC&amp;pg=PA300  p. 300].&lt;/ref&gt;

Excavation work undertaken in 2005 and 2006 has shown that [[Hamoukar]] was destroyed by warfare by around 3500 BC-—probably the earliest urban warfare attested so far in the archaeological record of the [[Ancient Near East|Near East]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-news.uchicago.edu/citations/05/051216.hamoukar-nyt.html "Archaeologists Unearth a War Zone 5,500 Years Old"]&lt;/ref&gt; Continued excavations in 2008 and 2010 expand on that.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oi.uchicago.edu/pdf/nn211.pdf], Clemens D. Reichel, Excavations at Hamoukar Syria, in Oriental Institute Fall 2011 News and Notes, no. 211, pp. 1-9,  2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Military conquests expanded city states under Egyptian control. [[Babylonia]] and later [[Assyria]] built empires in Mesopotamia while the [[Hittite Empire]] ruled much of Anatolia.
[[Chariot]]s appear in the 20th century BC, and become central to warfare in the [[Ancient Near East]] from the 17th century BC. The [[Hyksos]] and [[Kassites|Kassite]] invasions mark the transition to the Late Bronze Age. [[Ahmose I]] defeated the Hyksos and re-established Egyptian control of Nubia and [[Canaan]], territories again defended by [[Ramesses II]] at the [[Battle of Kadesh]], the greatest chariot battle in history. The raids of the [[Sea Peoples]] and the renewed disintegration of Egypt in the [[Third Intermediate Period of Egypt|Third Intermediate Period]] marks the end of the Bronze Age.

[[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean Greeks]] (c. 1600-1100 BC) invested in the development of [[Military of Mycenaean Greece|military infrastructure]], while military production and logistics were supervised directly from the palatial centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Palaima|first1=Tom|title=Mycenaean Militarism from a Textual Perspective|journal=Polemos: Warfare in the Aegean Bronze Age (Aegaeum)|date=1999|volume=19|pages=367–378| url=http://www.utexas.edu/research/pasp/oldsite/publications/pdf/militarism.pdf|accessdate=14 October 2015|ref=harv}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The most identifiable piece of Mycenaean armor was the [[boar's tusk helmet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schofield|first=Louise|title=The Mycenaeans|year=2006|location=Los Angeles, CA|publisher=J.

The Bronze Age in China traverses the protohistoric and historic periods.  Battles utilizing foot and chariot infantry took place regularly between powers in the North China Plain.

==Iron Age==

{{Main|Ancient warfare}}

Early Iron Age events like the [[Dorian invasion]], [[Magna Graecia|Greek colonialism]] and their interaction with [[Phoenicia]]n and [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] forces lie within the prehistoric period. [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] warrior societies of the [[Migration period]] engaged in [[endemic warfare]] (see also [[Thorsberg moor]]). [[Anglo-Saxon warfare]] lies on the edge of historicity, its study relying primarily on archaeology with the help of only fragmentary written accounts.

==Endemic warfare==

{{Main|Endemic warfare}}

In warlike cultures, war is often ritualized with a number of [[taboo]]s and practices that limit the number of casualties and the duration of the conflict. This type of situation is known as [[endemic warfare]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} Among tribal societies engaging in endemic warfare, conflict may escalate to actual warfare occasionally for reasons such as conflict over resources or for no readily understandable reason.

As a [[Philosophy of education|teaching methodology]], process drama developed primarily from the work of [[Brian Way]], [[Dorothy Heathcote]] and [[Gavin Bolton]]&lt;ref&gt;Bolton, G. M. (1979) ''Towards a theory of drama in education''. Longman, London.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bolton, G. M. (1984) ''Drama as education''. Longman, London.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bolton, G. M.

M. and Dorothy Heathcote (1995) ''Drama for Learning: Dorothy Heathcote's Mantle of the Expert Approach to Education (Dimensions of Drama Series)''. Heinemann Drama.&lt;/ref&gt; and through the work of other leading [[drama]] practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, Norah and Juliana Saxton (1987) ''Teaching Drama: A Mind of Many Wonders.'' Trans-Atlantic Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Neelands, Jonothan and Tony Goode (2000) ''Structuring Drama Work: A handbook of available forms in theatre and drama''.

Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Patrice Baldwin|Baldwin, Patrice]] (1991) ''Stimulating drama: Cross curricular approaches to drama in the primary school.''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cecily O'Neill]] describes process drama being used to explore a problem, situation, theme or series of related ideas or themes through the use of the artistic medium of unscripted drama. Process drama was described by O'Mara (1999) as" a dynamic way of working that requires teachers to reflect-in-action",&lt;ref&gt;O'Mara, Joanne. 1999. Unravelling the Mystery: A Study of Reflection-in-Action in Process Drama Teaching.Thesis (PhD Doctorate), Griffith University, Brisbane. Accessible at: https://www120.secure.griffith.edu.au/rch/items/427f6837-6772-8177-ddc0-5a341ddb544d/1/ &lt;/ref&gt; constantly dealing with unique situations that require novel approaches.&lt;ref&gt;Schön, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; It has its roots in dramatic play, where normally developing children in every [[culture]] in the world will create their own imagined worlds, often with the co-participation of an [[empathy|empathetic]] adult (usually the parent) in role.

Process drama in school settings usually involves the whole class working with the teacher in role in a made-up [[scenario]].  When they are working in process drama, the students and teachers work together to create an imaginary dramatic world within which issues are considered and problems can be solved. In this world they work together to explore problems and issues such as, "How do communities deal with change?", "How do we accept other people into our community?" or themes such as environmental [[sustainability]], betrayal, truth and other [[ethical]] and moral issues. Sometimes the work may begin as light-hearted, but the teacher always layers more dramatic tension and complexity into the work as the teacher is aiming for a [[pedagogical]] outcome. Students learn to think beyond their own points of view and consider multiple perspectives on a topic through playing different roles. For instance, if the issue being discussed is logging a forest, they may play the [[Lumberjack|loggers]], people who live in the forest community and [[environmentalist]]s. Playing a range of positions encourages them to be able to recast themselves as the "other" and to consider life from that viewpoint, thereby creating complexity and enabling us to explore multiple dimensions of the topic.  Process drama does what the character [[Atticus Finch]] advocates: the ability to work for [[social justice]] comes from the ability to understand another perspective—to be able to try on someone else's shoes and walk around in them for a while. Process drama allows us to "try on" other people's shoes, to walk the paths they tread and to see how the world looks from their point of view.

Process drama is also suggested as a tool to promote literacy development through opportunities for dramatic play in early childhood settings within which children speak for a range of purposes in role.&lt;ref&gt;Sun, Ping-Yun.

A '''rhinestone''', '''paste''' or '''diamante''' is a [[diamond simulant]] originally made from [[rock crystal]] but since the 19th century from [[Lead_glass|crystal glass]] or polymers such as [[Polymethyl methacrylate|acrylic]].

== Original ==

Originally, rhinestones were rock crystals gathered from the river [[Rhine]], hence the name, although some were also found in areas like the [[Alps]], but today the name "rhinestone" applies only to varieties of lead glass known as [[crystal glass]]. The availability was greatly increased in the 18th century when the [[Alsace|Alsatian]] [[jeweller]] [[Georg Friedrich Strass]] had the idea to imitate diamonds by coating the lower side of lead glass with metal powder. Hence, rhinestones are called ''strass'' in many [[Languages of Europe|European languages]].

As opposed to the classic rhinestones, which had a metal powder coating on the bottom side only, several companies have opted to mass-produce iridescent lead glass, by reducing the metal coating thickness and apply it uniformly, not using metal powder with a binder but by applying various forms of metal deposition (thin foil, vapor deposition, etc): [[Favrile glass]] by [[Louis Comfort Tiffany|Tiffany]] in 1894, [[Carnival glass]] under the name "Iridrill" by [[Fenton Art Glass Company|Fenton]] in 1908, "Aurora Borealis" glass by [[Swarovski]] in 1956 and [[Physical vapor deposition|PVD-coated]] [[dichroic glass]] in the late 20th century, amongst many other decorative lead glasses coated with a thin metal layer sold under various commercial names such as "rainbow glass", "aurora glass" and such.

Rhinestones can be used as imitations of diamonds, and some manufacturers even manage to partially reproduce the glistening effect real diamonds have in the sun.

== Compositions ==

Typically, crystal rhinestones have been used on [[costumes]], apparel and [[jewelry]]. Crystal rhinestones are produced mainly in [[Austria]] by [[Swarovski]] and in [[Czech Republic|the Czech Republic]] by [[Preciosa (corporation)|Preciosa]] and a few other glassworks in northern Bohemia. In the US, these are sometimes called "Austrian crystal".

The rhinestone-studded Nudie suit was invented by [[Nudie Cohn]] in the 1940s, an Americanization of the [[matador]]'s "[[Traje de luces|suit of lights]]". Rhinestone material is often used as an alternative to [[sequin]].

== In popular culture ==

Liberal use of rhinestones was associated with [[country music]] [[singer]]s, as well as with singer [[Elvis Presley]] and pianist [[Liberace]]. In 1974 [[David Allan Coe]] released the album ''[[The Mysterious Rhinestone Cowboy]]'' and referred to himself as The Rhinestone Cowboy again in the 1977 song "Longhaired Redneck". In 1975 [[Glen Campbell]] had a top hit with the song "[[Rhinestone Cowboy]]" and became known as the "Rhinestone Cowboy".  That song served as the basis for the 1984 movie ''[[Rhinestone (film)|Rhinestone]]'', starring [[Sylvester Stallone]] and [[Dolly Parton]]. [[Gorillaz]] has also released a single by the name of "[[Rhinestone Eyes]]". The closing track on Madvillain's Madvillainy is called Rhinestone Cowboy.

==Sizing guide==
Rhinestones are sized by using the term "ss", or stone size, followed by a number to indicate size (e.g. 8ss is equivalent to 2.3&amp;nbsp;mm diameter, 10ss is 2.8&amp;nbsp;mm).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clothingdictionary.com/rhinestones_and_rhinestone_jewelry.htm |title=Rhinestones and Rhinestone Jewelry |publisher=Clothingdictionary.com |date= |accessdate=6 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; SS is more commonly used for apparel means, while PP (or pearl plate) is used for jewelry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewelrymaking-beads-library.com/rhinestone-size.html |title=Rhinestone Size - SS Size and PP size |publisher=Jewelrymaking-beads-library.com |date= |accessdate=6 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hot-fix rhinestones==
Hot-fix rhinestones, also called heat-transfer rhinestones, are mainly used for apparel. The flat bottom of the stone has a glue backing and, when heated, melts onto the surface of the clothing. These can be adhered using a regular iron, however, it is recommended to use a [[heat press]], as they are able to reach higher temperatures (standard transfers require temperatures of up to {{convert|350|-|400|F|C|disp=flip|sigfig=2}}) while applying heavy pressures resulting in a more professional quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.swarovski-professional.com/en-WORLD/application/hotfix-application |title= Swarovski Hotfix Applikation |publisher=[[Swarovski|Swarovski]] |date= |accessdate=22 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sara Yorke Stevenson''' (February 19, 1847 – November 14, 1921) was an [[United States|American]] [[Archaeology|archaeologist]] specializing in [[Egyptology]], one of the founders of the [[University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology]], [[suffragist]] and women's rights activist, and a columnist for the [[Philadelphia Public Ledger]].

As a scholar, Stevenson published books and articles on Egyptology and the material culture of the ancient [[Near East]], as well as a memoir about the reign of [[Maximilian I of Mexico]]. She was the first curator of the Egyptian Collection at the Penn Museum and played an important role in acquiring much of the collection itself. As a women's rights activist, she served as the first president of the [[Equal Franchise Society]] and the Civic Club of [[Philadelphia]]. She was the first woman to receive an honorary degree from the [[University of Pennsylvania]], the first woman to lecture at the [[Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology|Peabody Museum]] at [[Harvard University]], and the first female member of the Jury of Awards for Ethnology at the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in [[Chicago]].

== Personal Life ==

=== Childhood &amp; Early life ===
Sara Yorke Stevenson's parents were Edward Yorke (December 20, 1798-1868) and Sarah Hanna Yorke, who married in [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]] in 1834 and who moved to [[Paris]] during the 1840s. They both came from established families: her mother's family owned a large cotton plantation and her father was a cotton broker.&lt;ref name="Biddle2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Notable Women of Pennsylvania|date=1942|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|editor1-last=Biddle|editor1-first=Gertrude|location=Philadelphia|pages=234–236|editor2-last=Lowrie|editor2-first=Sarah Dickson}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jordan3" /&gt;

Edward Yorke was born in Philadelphia and moved to New Orleans to represent the Yorke &amp; Macalister law firm. In Louisiana he was involved in the establishment of the public school system in New Orleans. He became interested in business ventures, including the introduction of gas to Paris, and a trans-isthmian railway in [[Tehuantepec]]. He died of paralysis in [[Vermont]] in 1868. Sarah Hanna was born in [[Alabama]] and moved with her family to New Orleans.&lt;ref name="Jordan3"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/colonialfamilies02jord/page/1614|title=Colonial Families of Philadelphia|last=|first=|date=1911|publisher=Lewis Publishing Company|year=|isbn=|editor1-last=Jordan|editor1-first=John W.|location=NY|pages=|chapter=York[sic]-Stille Family}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to Sara, their youngest child, Edward and Sarah Hanna Yorke had four other children:

* Edward Yorke: born in New Orleans; educated in engineering at the [[École Centrale]] in Paris; married Jane Heard; died by drowning in 1884.
* Ellen Yorke: born in New Orleans, married Captain Charles Blanchot in 1865.
* Ogden Yorke: born in New Orleans; educated in engineering at the École Centrale in Paris; killed by [[Brigandage|brigands]] while working on the Isthmian Railway in 1862.
* Mary Yorke: born in Paris, France; married Maurice Kingsley.

==== France ====
Sara Letitia Yorke was born in the Rue de Courcelles in Paris on February 19, 1847. Sara's parents moved back to the [[United States|States]] when she was only ten, leaving their daughters to attend boarding school in [[France]]. She lived in Paris from 1858 through 1862 under the guardianship of [[:fr:Achille_Jubinal|M. Achille Jubinal]], who inspired Stevenson's early interest in archaeology and Egyptology.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=zLVPs0MHlEQC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR5&amp;dq=sara+yorke+stevenson&amp;ots=n7P4UP0eZt&amp;sig=_j7SktTH2b5MwXRiTAt7IOjqh7E#v=onepage&amp;q=sara%20yorke%20stevenson&amp;f=false|title=Philadelphia and the Development of Americanist Archaeology|last=Fowler|first=Don D.|last2=Wilcox|first2=David R.|date=2003-09-15|publisher=University of Alabama Press|isbn=9780817313128|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time she met the [[Charles de Morny, Duke of Morny|Duke of Morny]], half-brother of Napoleon and prominent figure in the [[Second French intervention in Mexico|French Intervention in Mexico]], a conflict with which she would soon become profoundly familiar. In 1862, Sara departed France for Mexico by sea, about which she wrote:

''There were only forty passengers on board, and, comparatively speaking, little of the animation that usually precedes the outgoing of an ocean steamer. I found without difficulty the French banker and his Mexican wife who had kindly consented to chaperon me during my lonely journey; and I soon discovered that she and I were the only women passengers on board.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/maximilian-in-mexico-a-womans-reminiscences-of-the-french-intervention-1862-1867/oclc/253209699?referer=br&amp;ht=edition|title=Maximilian in Mexico: a woman's reminiscences of the French intervention 1862-1867|last=Stevenson|first=Sara Yorke|date=1899|publisher=Century Co. (DeVinne Press)|location=New York|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Mexico ====
In 1862 the Yorke family moved to [[Tacubaya]], a suburb of [[Mexico City]], following the murder of Sara's brother Ogden. In [[Mexico]] she attended many social gatherings of the newly appointed Empress of Mexico [[Charlotte of Belgium]] and her husband Maximilian. Stevenson's first-hand account of the [[Second Mexican Empire]], ''Maximilian in Mexico: A Woman's Reminiscences of the French Intervention 1862-1867'' (New York, 1899)'','' gave great insight into the inner workings of court life during that time. [[C. M. Mayo|C.M. Mayo]] commented on this book was the "most lucid, informed, and balanced...of all the English language memoirs of the Second Empire/French Intervention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://maximilian-carlota.blogspot.com/2010/10/maximilian-in-mexico-womans.html|title=Maximilian and Carlota: A Blog for Researchers: Maximilian in Mexico: A Woman's Reminiscences of the French Intervention 1862 - 1867 by Sara Yorke Stevenson|last=Mayo|first=C. m|date=2010-10-05|website=Maximilian and Carlota|access-date=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sara Yorke Stevenson and her mother, Sarah Hanna Yorke, appear in Mayo's novel [http://www.cmmayo.com/last-prince-of-the-mexican-empire.html The Last Prince of the American Empire].

==== United States ====
In 1867, the Yorke family relocated to [[Vermont]]. Sara's father died only a year later, in 1868, and soon afterwards, at the age of twenty-one, Sara Yorke moved to [[Philadelphia]] to live with two of her uncles and an aunt on the Yorke side of her family.&lt;ref name="Jordan3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Marriage &amp; Family ===
Sara Yorke married [[Cornelius Stevenson]], a Philadelphia lawyer, on June 30, 1870.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Married|date=July 1, 1870|work=Philadelphia Inquirer|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cornelius Stevenson was born in Philadelphia on January 14, 1842, the only son of Adam May and Anna Smith (Philips) Stevenson. He served as a private in the First Troop, Philadelphia City Cavalry during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].&lt;ref name="Jordan3" /&gt;

Sara Yorke Stevenson and Cornelius Stevenson had one child, [[William Yorke Stevenson]] (1878-1922) who married [[Christine Wetherill Stevenson|Christine Wetherill Rice]].&lt;ref name="Jordan3" /&gt;

=== Death ===
[[File:Sara_Yorke_Stevenson_tribute_plate.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Sara_Yorke_Stevenson_tribute_plate.jpg|thumb|Sara Yorke Stevenson Tribute Plate]]
Sara Yorke Stevenson died on November 14, 1921. In February 1922, a tribute to Stevenson was included in the Pennsylvania Museum Bulletin that described her as follows:&lt;blockquote&gt;To us there will always rise, at the mention of Mrs. Stevenson's name, the dignified little figure with the black bag out of which she brought, like the unexpected mother in the Swiss Family Robinson, precisely the thing needed at the moment. For wise counsel, for tolerance, for understanding sympathy, we all of us came to her and never were refused. Her counsel was based on an experience of the world which included half a century of real intimacy with brilliant and wise people who sought her as a companion; it was poignant with interludes of the Mexican capital, Parisian days and Egyptian excavations.  It was invariably moral and direct, but tempered with a worldliness that was never the counsel of the fear of consequences. Her tolerance, while it seemed almost  universal, balked at glossing over a sham or condoning insincerity. If she did not always suffer fools gladly she was generally able to contrive some amusement from them  to shorten their discourse by a quick turn of wit.&lt;ref name="Bulletin2" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The Sara Yorke Stevenson papers were removed from the home of [[Frances Anne Wister]] and donated to [[La Salle University|LaSalle University]]'s [[Connelly Library]] as a part of the [[Owen Wister]] Collection by the David Prince Estate. She is buried at the [[Laurel Hill Cemetery]] in Philadelphia. 

== Professional and Civic Life ==

=== Civic Societies ===
Stevenson played a leading role in several local [[Civic society|civic societies]] (aka [[Civil society|civil societies]], or groups of community of citizens often linked by collective interests and activities) including serving as the founder and first president of the [[Equal Franchise Society of Philadelphia]], co-founder and two-term president of the [[Civic Club of Philadelphia]] (a group of women who advocated for civic reform and improvement), the president of the [[Acorn Club]] for 25 years, president of the Contemporary Club, and chair of the [[French War Relief Committee]] of the [[Emergency Aid of Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lasalle.edu/ConnellyLibrary/speccoll/Inventories/SaraYorkeStevensonPapers.pdf|title=Sara Yorke Stevenson Papers|last=|first=|date=|website=Connelly Library Special Collections|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; She also served on the Women's Centennial Committee of the [[Centennial Exposition|Philadelphia Centennial Exhibition]] of 1876, which created an exhibition known as the "Women's Building" that showcased "for the first time, at an international exposition, the intimate bonds, shared values, and material achievements of women" and was hailed as a milestone in the women's movement of the 19th century.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite thesis|last=MOON|first=VAN NESS, CHRISTINE|title=THE FURNESS-MITCHELL COTERIE:  ITS ROLE IN PHILADELPHIA'S INTELLECTUAL LIFE AT THE TURN OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY (PENNSYLVANIA)|date=1985|publisher=University of Pennsylvania|url=https://repository.upenn.edu/dissertations/AAI8523463/|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The Furness-Mitchell Coterie ====
[[File:Sara_Yorke_Stevenson_Portrait_-_young.gif|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Sara_Yorke_Stevenson_Portrait_-_young.gif|thumb|Early Portrait of Sara Yorke Stevenson]]
Stevenson was part of a group of internationally known Philadelphia elite scholars, known as the [[Furness-Mitchell Coterie]], who were a driving force in many areas, especially [[anthropology]], during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.  The group included musicians, physicians, writers, scholars, anthropologists, and educators and was "unusual in its acceptance of accomplished women as intellectual equals".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Because of her involvement in the coterie, Stevenson was able to form close relationships and work collaboratively with other members of the group, including [[H.H. Furness]], [[Owen Wister]], [[Silas Weir Mitchell (physician)|S. Weir Mitchell]], [[Talcott Williams]], and [[Agnes Irwin (educator)|Agnes Irwin]].

==== The Equal Franchise Society of Philadelphia ====

Stevenson established the [[Equal Franchise Society]] of Pennsylvania, in recognition of the difficulties women faced in obtaining the right to vote. She served as president until 1910 and first vice president until the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Federal Suffrage Amendment]] passed in 1920.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  In 1910, the Equal Franchise Society of Philadelphia republished the speech entitled "Shall Women Have the Right to Vote?", originally delivered by [[Wendell Phillips|Wendell Philipps]] in Worcester, MA in 1851. In the forward of the publication, Stevenson (signed only as 'S.Y.S.'), reflected on the ongoing struggle for women's suffrage, writing:&lt;blockquote&gt;A Chinese philosopher, a disciple of Laotse, once said: “Man is like a child born at midnight who when he sees the sunrise, thinks there was no yesterday.” There are many persons in the community even today, who regard the present movement in favor of equal suffrage as a transitory, hysterical agitation of a demagogic nature, of which the impulse has been received in the United States from the outbreaks of militant partisans in England. In the minds of these persons, the movement in the past is vaguely associated with eccentric clothing and more or less ridicule; in the present, with the restlessness of what is regarded as an unwomanly demonstration.

While believers in equal suffrage in this country have taken advantage of the interest aroused in every part of the world by the news from the militant suffragists of England, the movement can claim a respectable history and a fairly long pedigree. If in the last century the pioneers in the demand for “Women's Rights” in England found strength in the support of such men as John Stuart Mill, their American sisters found among others an outspoken champion in another clear thinker— Wendell Phillips.

The principle of equality is generally admitted—the question of expediency still faces us. In reprinting Wendell Phillips’ admirable address, the intention therefore, is to make clear the relation of the present movement to its historical background. While listening to the words of a strong man who, in 1851, had the courage to support an unpopular cause in the interest of justice and fair play, it is hoped that encouragement will be given to those who today are fighting in the ranks. - S.

What we need to do today is not to slaughter men and parties who do not happen to think as we do … but to educate them, teach them to see, to know, to love, to feel, to grow."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.archives.upenn.edu/histy/features/women/quote1.html|title=Quotations, 1750-1900, from Women at Penn, University of Pennsylvania University Archives|website=www.archives.upenn.edu|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

=== Anthropology &amp; Egyptology ===
[[File:Sara_Yorke_Stevenson_Working.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Sara_Yorke_Stevenson_Working.jpg|thumb|Sara Yorke Stevenson Working]]
In the 1880s anthropology was still emerging as an established academic discipline, and universities were beginning to develop and formalize their anthropology departments. Stevenson became involved in Egyptological pursuits through her membership in the American branch of the Egypt Exploration Fund, which was founded in 1882 by [[Amelia Edwards]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Throughout her career, Stevenson made several trips overseas, although she never carried out her own archaeological fieldwork. She contributed to the collections of what is now the University of Pennsylvania' Museum of Anthropology and Archaeology as the first curator of the Egyptian and Mediterranean section, a position to which she was appointed in 1890.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.penn.museum/sites/expedition/women-archaeologists-in-the-early-days-of-the-museum/|title=Expedition Magazine  {{!}} Women Archaeologists in the Early Days of the Museum|website=www.penn.museum|language=en|access-date=2018-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Anthropological Work in America", an article in the July 1892 issue of ''[[Popular Science|Popular Science Monthly]]'',  declared that Stevenson "is perhaps [America's] only lady [[Egyptology|Egyptologist]]. Her lectures in [[Egypt|Egyptian]] subjects have made a sensation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Starr|first1=Frederick|date=July 1892|title=Anthropological Work in America|url=https://archive.org/stream/popularsciencemo41newy#page/296/mode/2up/search/stevenson|journal=Popular Science Monthly|volume=41|issue=22|pages=296–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; She mentored with [[Frederick Ward Putnam]], who had just established [[Harvard]]'s anthropology department, along with [[Franz Boas]], [[Zelia Nuttall]], and [[Alice Fletcher]]. Stevenson's interests were very wide and ranged from cultural diffusion to [[Sociocultural evolution|cultural evolution]].

In 1892 Putnam supported Stevenson's appointment to the Jury of Awards for [[Ethnology]] during the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. A special act had to be passed to allow a woman to serve this position; Stevenson was elected vice president of the jury. In 1894 Stevenson was the first woman to speak at the [[Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology|Peabody Museum]] on "Egypt at the Dawn of History". She was president of the [[Oriental Club of Philadelphia]], the Contemporary Club, president and secretary Pennsylvania Chapter of the [[Archeological Institute of America|Archaeological Institute of America]], and was founder and officer of the University Archaeological Association, the American Folk-Lore Society, and the [[American Exploration Society]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.brown.edu/Research/Breaking_Ground/introduction.php|title=Sara Yorke Stevenson 1847- 1922|last=Lesko|first=Barbara S.|date=|website=Breaking Ground: Women in Old World Archaeology|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was also a member of the Numismatic and Antiquarian Society of Philadelphia and in 1895 was one of the first two women admitted to the [[American Philosophical Society]]. Stevenson also joined the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1884 and was nominated a Fellow in 1895.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1894, Stevenson was the first woman to receive an honorary doctorate degree from the University of Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; She also received an honorary degree from Temple University, and medals from the National Institute of Social Sciences Association.

Of Stevenson's role, [[Langdon Warner]] stated: "“If women today find no difficulty in being recognized as scholars, and if their counsel is demanded in Museums, it is due to Mrs. Stevenson in a far greater measure than our casual generation will ever know."

==== University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology ====
Stevenson played a pivotal role in the establishment of the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology ([[Penn Museum]]). In 1891, Stevenson, William Pepper, [[Talcott Williams]], and [[Joseph Coates]] were appointed by the University Archaeological Association to create the Department of Archaeology and Paleontology. Stevenson then served on the governing board from its start (1892) until 1905 (secretary 1894-1904; president 1904-05).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; During her tenure, she contributed to the building of the "Free Museum of Science and Art", which was first dedicated in 1899 and which eventually became the Penn Museum. She served as the curator of the Egyptian and Mediterranean section of the museum from 1890 to 1905. In her position as curator, Stevenson was concerned with collections acquisitions and in 1898 she travelled to Egypt and purchased 42 cases of artifacts for the American Exploration Society, mostly from the ancient site of [[Dendera|Dendereh]], including the Penn Museum's first [[papyrus]].&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite thesis|last=MOON|first=VAN NESS, CHRISTINE|title=THE FURNESS-MITCHELL COTERIE:  ITS ROLE IN PHILADELPHIA'S INTELLECTUAL LIFE AT THE TURN OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY (PENNSYLVANIA)|date=1985|publisher=University of Pennsylvania|url=https://repository.upenn.edu/dissertations/AAI8523463/|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
[[File:Sara_Yorke_Stevenson_working.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Sara_Yorke_Stevenson_working.jpg|thumb|Stevenson in her office at the Penn Museum]]
In 1905, Stevenson, along with more than 125 supporters, resigned from her position at the museum following controversy surrounding [[Hermann Volrath Hilprecht|Herman Hilprecht]]'s personal appropriations and fraudulent publication of antiquities. Hilprecht was cleared of charges but Stevenson never returned to her position at the museum.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

As noted in her Penn Museum biography: "As one of the principal founders of the University Museum, one whose contributions to the building program of the Museum was essential to its success, Stevenson set a powerful example for generations of women to follow.[http://www.archives.upenn.edu/people/1800s/stevenson_sara_yorke.html "]

=== Journalism ===

[[File:Summerfairesign.JPG|thumb|Signs warning of prohibited activities; an example of a social control]]
'''Social control''' is a [[concept]] within the [[Discipline (academia)|disciplines]] of the [[social sciences]].&lt;ref name="M. Innes"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6yXo5ARzFaMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Understanding+Social+Control:+Crime+and+Social+Order+in+Late+Modernity&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAGoVChMI5JDpgL75xgIVS-0UCh0FRg_z#v=onepage&amp;q=Understanding%20Social%20Control%3A%20Crime%20and%20Social%20Order%20in%20Late%20Modernity&amp;f=false|author=M.

[[Sociology|Sociologists]] identify two basic forms of social control:
# ''Informal means of control'' – [[Internalisation (sociology)|Internalization]] of [[norm (sociology)|norm]]s and [[value (ethics)|value]]s by a process known as [[socialization]], which is "the process by which an individual, born with behavioral potentialities of enormously wide range, is led to develop actual behavior which is confined to the narrower range of what is acceptable for him by the [[Social group|group standards]]."&lt;ref&gt;Lindzey, Gardner (Ed), (1954). Handbook of social psychology. I. Theory and method. II. Special fields and applications. (2 vols)., (pp. II, 655-692). Oxford, England: Addison-Wesley Publishing Co., xx, 1226 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Formal means of social control'' – External [[sanctions (law)|sanctions]] enforced by government to prevent the establishment of [[Lawlessness|chaos]] or [[anomie]] in society. Some theorists, such as [[Émile Durkheim]], refer to this form of control as [[regulation]].

As briefly defined above, the means to enforce social control can be either informal or formal.&lt;ref name=Poore&gt;Poore, S. [http://www.hewett.norfolk.sch.uk/curric/soc/crime/s_contro.htm Overview of Social Control Theories] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070822133540/http://www.hewett.norfolk.sch.uk/curric/soc/crime/s_contro.htm |date=2007-08-22 }}.

Ross]] argues that [[belief]] systems exert a greater control on human behavior than laws imposed by government, no matter what form the beliefs take.&lt;ref name = Ross&gt;Ross, E.A. 2009 (1901).

==Definition of the concept==
Roodenburg identifies the concept of social control as a classical concept.&lt;ref name="H. Roodenburg"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YZ1Ty4dxHQ8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=social+control&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiW2-HgnrTJAhWJHxoKHU9XDgcQ6AEIIzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=social%20control&amp;f=false|author=H. Roodenburg|title=text|publisher=published by Ohio State University Press 2004, {{ISBN|0814209688}} |accessdate=2015-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the concept of social control has been around since the formation of organized sociology, the meaning has been altered over time. Originally, the concept simply referred to society's ability to [[Regulation|regulate itself]].&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Sociological Theory and Social Control|author=Morris Janowitz|journal=American Journal of Sociology|volume=81|number=1|date=Jul 1975|pages=82–108|publisher=The University of Chicago Press Article|jstor=2777055|doi=10.1086/226035}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the 1930s, the term took on its more modern meaning of an individual's conversion to [[conformity]].&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt; Academics began to study [[Social control theory]] as a separate field in the early 20th century.

The concept of social control is related to the notion of [[social order]], a concept identified as existing in the following areas of society:&lt;ref name="M. Innes"/&gt;

==Informal==

===Social values===
Social values present in individuals are products of informal social control, exercised implicitly by a society through particular [[customs]], [[social norm|norms]], and [[mores]]. Individuals internalize the values of their society, whether conscious or not of the indoctrination. [[Traditional values|Traditional society]] relies mostly on informal social control embedded in its customary [[culture]] to socialize its members.

===Sanctions===
Informal sanctions may include [[shame]], [[Appeal to ridicule|ridicule]], [[sarcasm]], [[criticism]], and disapproval, which can cause an individual to stray towards the social norms of the society. In extreme cases sanctions may include social [[discrimination]] and [[social exclusion|exclusion]]. Informal social control usually has more effect on individuals because the social values become [[internalized]], thus becoming an aspect of the individual's [[Personality psychology|personality]].

Informal sanctions check '[[deviant]]' behavior.  An example of a negative sanction comes from a scene in the Pink Floyd film ''[[The Wall]]'', whereby the young protagonist is ridiculed and verbally [[abuse]]d by a high school teacher for writing poetry in a mathematics class. Another example from the movie ''[[About a Boy (film)|About a Boy]]'', when a young boy hesitates to jump from a high springboard and is ridiculed for his fear. Though he eventually jumps, his behavior is controlled by shame.&lt;ref&gt;Holland G., Skinner B. F. ''The Analysis of behaviour (The autoinstructing program)''. McGraw-Hill N. Y., 1961, Lesson 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reward and punishment===
{{see also|Mesolimbic pathway|Reward system}}

Informal controls reward or [[Punishment|punish]] acceptable or unacceptable behavior (i.e., [[deviance (sociology)|deviance]]) and are varied from individual to individual, group to group, and society to society. For example, at a [[Women's Institutes (British)|Women's Institute]] meeting, a disapproving look might convey the message that it is inappropriate to flirt with the minister. In a [[Organized crime|criminal gang]], on the other hand, a stronger sanction applies in the case of someone threatening to inform to the police of illegal activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

===Theoretical bias within the modern media===
Theorists such as [[Noam Chomsky]] have argued that [[systemic bias]] exists in the modern media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Powerful ideological, economic and religious [[lobbyists]] have often used school systems and centralized electronic communications to influence [[public opinion]].

==Formal==

===Historically===
Social control developed together with civilization, as a rational measure against the uncontrollable forces of nature, which [[tribe|tribal]] organisations were at prey to, within archaic tribal societies.&lt;ref name="D.S. McIntosh "&gt;{{cite book |jstor=1952567|author=D.S. McIntosh |title=DOI: 10.2307/1952567 (p.619)|publisher=published by The American Political Science Review  September 1963 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[divine right of kings|Rulers]] have [[Legitimation|legitimately]] used [[torture]] as a means of [[mind control]]  as well as [[murder]], [[imprisonment]] and [[exile]] to remove from public space anyone the state authorities deemed undesirable.

In the [[Age of Enlightenment]], harsh penalties for [[crimes]] and [[civil disobedience]] were criticized by [[List of civil rights leaders|philosophers]] such as [[Cesare Beccaria]] and [[Jeremy Bentham]], whose work inspired [[reform movement]]s. These movements eventually led to the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] in 1948, which informs most western [[jurisdictions]] and the similar [[Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam]] in 1990.

The word ''[[crime]]''  became part of the [[vocabulary]] of the [[English language]] via [[Old French]], during the [[Middle Ages]], and within the [[Middle English]] of the language.&lt;ref name="B. Hanawalt, D. Wallace"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1pIdd74zfZ4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=social+control&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi-9M7dyLXJAhWJ2hoKHehcChg4ChDoAQgnMAI#v=onepage&amp;q=social%20control&amp;f=false|author= B.

In history, [[religion]] provided a moral influence on the community and each person, providing an internal [[locus of control]] oriented toward a [[morality]], so that each person was empowered to have a degree of control over themselves within society. As [[Auguste Comte]] instituted sociology ([[The Course in Positive Philosophy|1830-1842]]), already certain thinkers predicted the discontinuation of a perceived ''false consciousness'' intrinsic to religious belief.  Nevertheless, within the twentieth century, social scientists presumed that religion was still a principal factor of social control.&lt;ref name="R. Stark, W.S. Bainbridge"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eVt4yqoeP0YC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=social+control&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiSmpfmu7XJAhWLcBoKHSBoCMAQ6AEIRzAH#v=onepage&amp;q=social%20control&amp;f=false|author=R.

Comte, and those who preceded him, were breathing the air of a [[revolution]] in the latter part of the eighteenth century ([[French Revolution]]) to bring about a so-called  enlightened way of being in society, which brought about a new [[liberty]] for the individual, without the constraints of an over-seeing [[aristocracy]].&lt;ref&gt;G.S. Wood - [https://books.google.com/books?id=AWI8fmyhN5IC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Liberty&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwipj6nByrXJAhUIcBoKHV2jAwsQ6AEISjAI#v=onepage&amp;q=Liberty&amp;f=false text] published by [[Oxford University Press]] September 26, 2009, 800 pages, {{ISBN|0199741093}}  [[Political Science]] [Retrieved 2015-11-29]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context social control through penal and correctional services, the ''rehabilatative ideal'' (Francis Allen 1964) is a key idea that formed within the 20th century—the first principle of which is that behavior is first caused by things that happened before ("Human behaviour is a product of antecedent causes").&lt;ref name="T.G. Blomberg, K. Lucken"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bcu2lfSlUGkC&amp;pg=PA101&amp;dq=rehabilitative+ideal&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjriv66_rfJAhWCzRoKHT7aDH4Q6AEIMjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=rehabilitative%20ideal&amp;f=false|author=T.G.

===Techniques===
[[Law]] is a technique used for the purposes of social control.&lt;ref name="Roscoe Pound"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1sCffAYNpu0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=social+control&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiSmpfmu7XJAhWLcBoKHSBoCMAQ6AEIQTAG#v=onepage&amp;q=social%20control&amp;f=false|author=R. Pound|title=text|publisher=published by Transaction Publishers 1942 (reprint, revised), {{ISBN|1560009160}},  Powell lectures |accessdate=2015-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, there are certain laws regarding appropriate sexual relationships and these are largely based on societal values. Historically, homosexuality has been criminalised. In modern times, this is no longer an offence and this is due to shifts in society's values. Howerever, there are still laws regarding age of consent and incest, as these are still deemed as issues in society that require means of control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.palgraveconnect.com/pc/doifinder/10.1057/9781137476159.0009|title=Roffee, James (2015).

A mechanism of social control occurs through the use of selective incentives.&lt;ref&gt;B. Janky, K.

Oberschall, in his work, identifies three elements to the pragmatics of social control as they exist in our current society. These are, confrontational control, such as  [[riot control]] and [[crowd control]], preventative measures to deter non-normal behaviors, which is legislation outlining expected boundaries for behavior,  and measures complementary to preventative measures, which amount to punishment of criminal offences.&lt;ref name="Anthony Oberschall"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JT8761v8-x4C&amp;pg=PA111&amp;dq=social+control+riot+control&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAmoVChMIxrnl-tD5xgIVATwUCh3RJQJZ#v=onepage&amp;q=social%20control%20riot%20control&amp;f=false|author=Anthony Oberschall|title=Social Movements: Ideologies, Interests, and Identities|publisher=Transaction Publishers 1995, 402 pages, {{ISBN|1412834368}}|accessdate=2015-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cities can implement park exclusion orders (prohibiting individuals from frequenting some or all of the parks in a city for an extended period due to a previous infraction), trespass laws (privatizing areas generally thought of as public so police can to choose which individuals to interrogate), and off-limit orders (Stay Out of Drug Areas (SODA) and Stay Out of Areas of Prostitution (SOAP) that obstruct access to these spaces). These are just a few of the new social control techniques cities use to displace certain individuals to the margins of society.&lt;ref name="eight" /&gt; Several common themes are apparent in each of these control mechanisms. The first is the ability to spatially constrain individuals in their own city. Defying any of the above statutes is a criminal offense resulting in possible incarceration.&lt;ref name="eight" /&gt; Though not all individuals subjected to an exclusion order obey it, these individuals are, at the very least, spatially hindered through decreased mobility and freedom throughout the city.&lt;ref name="ten" /&gt; This spatial constrain on individuals leads to disruption and interference in their lives. Homeless individuals generally frequent parks since the area provides benches for sleeping, public washrooms, occasional public services, and an overall sense of security by being near others in similar conditions. Privatizing areas such as libraries, public transportation systems, college campuses, and commercial establishments that are generally public gives the police permission to remove individuals as they see fit, even if the individual has ethical intent in the space. Off-limit orders attempting to keep drug addicts, prostitutes, and others out of concentrated areas of drug and sex crimes commonly restricts these individuals' ability to seek social services beneficial to rehabilitation, since these services are often located within the SODA and SOAP territories.&lt;ref name="ten" /&gt;

====Broken windows theory in the United States====
In the United States, early societies were able to easily expel individuals deemed undesirable from public space through [[vagrancy (people)|vagrancy]] laws and other forms of banishment. In the 1960s and 1970s, however, these exclusion orders were denounced as unconstitutional in America&lt;ref name="nine"&gt;Herbert, Steve and Katherine Beckett. 2009. Zoning out disorder: Assessing contemporary practices of urban social control. ''Studies in Law, Politics, and Society''. 47: 1-25.&lt;/ref&gt; and consequently were rejected by the US Supreme Court.&lt;ref name="eight"&gt;Beckett, Katherine and Steve Herbert. 2008. Dealing with disorder: Social control in the post-industrial city. ''Theoretical Criminology''. 12: 5-30.&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of [[broken windows theory]] in the 1980s transformed the concepts cities used to form policies, to circumvent the previous issue of unconstitutionality.&lt;ref&gt;Harcourt, Bernard and Jens Ludwig. 2005. Broken windows: New evidence from New York City and a five-city [[social experiment]]. ''The University of Chicago Law Review''. 73: 271-320.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the theory, the environment of a particular space signals its health to the public, including to potential vandals. By maintaining an organized environment, individuals are dissuaded from causing disarray in that particular location. However, environments filled with disorder, such as broken windows or graffiti, indicate an inability for the neighborhood to supervise itself, therefore leading to an increase in criminal activity.&lt;ref name="tented"&gt;Ranasinghe, Prashan. 2010. Public disorder and its relation to the community-civility-consumption triad: A case study on the uses and users of contemporary urban public space. ''Urban Studies''. 48: 1925-1943.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of focusing on the built environment, policies substantiated by the Broken Windows Theory overwhelmingly emphasize undesirable human behavior as the environmental disorder prompting further crime.&lt;ref name="eight" /&gt; The civility laws, originating in the late 1980s and early 1990s, provide an example of the usage of this latter aspect of the Broken Windows Theory as legitimization for discriminating against individuals considered disorderly in order to increase the sense of security in urban spaces.&lt;ref name="nine" /&gt; These civility laws effectively criminalize activities considered undesirable, such as sitting or lying on sidewalks, sleeping in parks, urinating or [[drinking in public]], and begging,&lt;ref name="ten"&gt;Beckett, Katherine and Steve Herbert. 2010. Penal boundaries: Banishment and the expansion of punishment. ''Law and Social Inquiry''. 35: 1-38.&lt;/ref&gt; in an attempt to force the individuals doing these and other activities to relocate to the margins of society.&lt;ref name="eight" /&gt; Not surprisingly then, [[criminalization of homelessness|these restrictions disproportionally affect the homeless]].&lt;ref name="eight" /&gt;

Individuals are deemed undesirable in urban space because they do not fit into [[norm (social)|social norms]], which causes unease for many residents of certain neighborhoods.&lt;ref&gt;England, Marcia. Stay out of drug areas: Drugs, othering, and regulation of public space in Seattle, Washington. ''Space and Polity''. 12: 197-213.&lt;/ref&gt; This fear has been deepened by the Broken Windows Theory and exploited in policies seeking to remove undesirables from visible areas of society.&lt;ref name="tented" /&gt; In the [[post-industrial society|post-industrial city]], concerned primarily with retail, tourism, and the service sector,&lt;ref name="eight" /&gt; the increasing pressure to create the image of a livable and orderly city has no doubt aided in the most recent forms of social control.&lt;ref name="nine" /&gt; These new techniques involve even more intense attempts to spatially expel certain individuals from urban space since the police are entrusted with considerably more power to investigate individuals, based on suspicion rather than on definite evidence of illicit actions.&lt;ref name="ten" /&gt;

==Recent developments==
In the decades leading up to the end of the 1980s, an increased prevalence of the [[Individualism|individual]] as a feature within society led to many new [[List of psychotherapies|therapies]], suggesting the use of therapy as a means of social control (Conrad &amp; Scheider, 1980: Mechanic 1989).&lt;ref&gt;A.V.

==Explicit stereotypes==
Explicit stereotypes are those people who are willing to verbalize and admit to other individuals. It also refers to stereotypes that one is aware that one holds, and is aware that one is using to judge people. People can attempt to consciously control the use of explicit stereotypes, even though their attempt to control may not be fully effective.

==Implicit stereotypes==

In [[social psychology]], a stereotype is any thought widely adopted about specific types of individuals or certain ways of behaving intended to represent the entire group of those individuals or behaviors as a whole.&lt;ref name="McGarty Yzerbyt et al.

==Etymology==
The term ''stereotype'' comes from the [[French language|French]] adjective ''stéréotype'' and derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] words στερεός ([[wikt:στερεός|''stereos'']]), "firm, solid"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dstereo%2Fs στερεός],
Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt; and τύπος ([[wikt:τύπος|''typos'']]), ''impression'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dtu%2Fpos τύπος], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt; hence "solid impression on one or more [[idea]]/[[theory]]."

The term comes from the [[Printing industry|printing trade]] and was first adopted in 1798 by [[Firmin Didot]] to describe a printing plate that duplicated any [[typographic|typography]]. The duplicate printing plate, or the stereotype, is used for printing instead of the original.

Outside of printing, the first reference to "stereotype" was in 1850, as a noun that meant ''image perpetuated without change''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=stereotype|title=stereotype - Origin and meaning of stereotype by Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was not until 1922 that "stereotype" was first used in the modern psychological sense by American journalist [[Walter Lippmann]] in his work ''[[Public Opinion (book)|Public Opinion]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Kleg| first1= Milton |title= Hate Prejudice and Racism |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=yKrrSa7WqNwC&amp;pg=PA135 |year= 1993 |publisher= State University of New York Press |location= Albany |pages= 135&amp;ndash;137 | isbn= 978-0-585-05491-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship with other types of intergroup attitudes==
Stereotypes, [[prejudice]], and [[discrimination]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2015/11/25/news/economy/racial-discrimination-work/index.html|title=Working while brown: What discrimination looks like now|last=Vega|first=Tanzina|work=CNNMoney|access-date=2018-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; are understood as related but different concepts.&lt;ref name="Fiske1998"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Fiske |first1= Susan T. |authorlink1= |authorlink2= |editor-first= Daniel T. |editor-last= Gilbert |editor2-first= Susan T. |editor2-last= Fiske |editor3-first= Gardner | editor3-last=Lindzey |title= The Handbook of Social Psychology |url= |edition= 4th |volume= Volume Two |year= 1998 |publisher= [[McGraw-Hill]] |location= Boston, Mass. |isbn= 978-0-19-521376-8 |page= 357 |pages= |chapter= Stereotyping, Prejudice, and Discrimination |chapterurl= https://books.google.com/books?id=w27pSuHLnLYC&amp;pg=PA357 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Denmark"&gt;{{cite book |last= Denmark |first1= Florence L. |authorlink1= |authorlink2= |editor1-first= Irving B. |editor1-last= Weiner |editor2-first= W.

(1994)"/&gt; Stereotypes are regarded as the most [[Cognition|cognitive]] component and often occurs without conscious awareness, whereas prejudice is the [[Affect (psychology)|affective]] component of stereotyping and discrimination is one of the behavioral components of prejudicial reactions.&lt;ref name="Fiske1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Denmark"/&gt;&lt;ref name="faculty.washington.edu"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Devine |first1= Patricia G. |year= 1989 |title= Stereotypes and Prejudice: Their Automatic and Controlled Components |journal= Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume= 56 |issue= 1 |pages= 5&amp;ndash;18 |doi= 10.1037/0022-3514.56.1.5 |url= http://faculty.washington.edu/donnaw/Devine%201989.pdf |accessdate=  }}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this tripartite view of intergroup attitudes, stereotypes reflect expectations and beliefs about the characteristics of members of groups perceived as different from one's own, prejudice represents the [[emotional]] response, and discrimination refers to actions.&lt;ref name="Fiske1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Denmark"/&gt;

Although related, the three concepts can exist independently of each other.&lt;ref name="Denmark"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tajfel (1981)"/&gt; According to [[Daniel Katz (psychologist)|Daniel Katz]] and Kenneth Braly, stereotyping leads to racial prejudice when people emotionally react to the name of a group, ascribe characteristics to members of that group, and then evaluate those characteristics.&lt;ref name="Katz &amp; Braly (1935)"/&gt;

Possible prejudicial effects of stereotypes&lt;ref name="Cox et al. (2012)"/&gt; are:
* Justification of ill-founded prejudices or ignorance
* Unwillingness to rethink one's attitudes and behavior 
* Preventing some people of stereotyped groups from entering or succeeding in activities or fields&lt;ref name=Tilcsik&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Tilcsik |first1= András |year= 2011 |title= Pride and Prejudice: Employment Discrimination against Openly Gay Men in the United States |journal= [[American Journal of Sociology]] |volume= 117 |issue= 2 |pages= 586–626 |doi= 10.1086/661653 |url= |pmid=22268247|hdl= 1807/34998 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
[[File:Mixed stereotype content model (Fiske et al.).png|thumb|300px|[[Stereotype content model]], adapted from [[Susan Fiske|Fiske]] et al. (2002): Four types of stereotypes resulting from combinations of perceived warmth and competence.]]
Stereotype content refers to the attributes that people think characterize a group. Studies of stereotype content examine what people think of others, rather than the reasons and mechanisms involved in stereotyping.&lt;ref name="operario&amp;fiske"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Operario |first1= Don |authorlink1= |last2= Fiske  |first2= Susan T. |authorlink2= |editor1-first= Rupert |editor1-last= Brown |editor1-link= |editor2-first= Samuel L |editor2-last= Gaertner |title= Blackwell Handbook of Social Psychology: Intergroup Processes |url= |edition= |year= 2003 |publisher= [[Wiley-Blackwell|Blackwell]] |location= Malden, MA |isbn= 978-1-4051-0654-2 |page= |pages= 22&amp;ndash;44 |chapter= Stereotypes: Content, Structures, Processes, and Context |chapterurl= https://books.google.com/books?id=Wfx55Z-Dw10C&amp;pg=PA22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early theories of stereotype content proposed by social psychologists such as [[Gordon Allport]] assumed that stereotypes of [[Ingroups and outgroups|outgroups]] reflected uniform [[antipathy]].&lt;ref name="fiske et al. 2002"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Fiske |first1= Susan T. |last2= Cuddy |first2= Amy J.

By contrast, a newer [[Stereotype content model|model of stereotype content]] theorizes that stereotypes are frequently ambivalent and vary along two dimensions: warmth and competence. Warmth and competence are respectively predicted by lack of [[competition]] and [[Social status|status]]. Groups that do not compete with the in-group for the same resources (e.g., college space) are perceived as warm, whereas high-status (e.g., economically or educationally successful) groups are considered competent. The groups within each of the four combinations of high and low levels of warmth and competence elicit distinct emotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Dovidio |first1= John F. |authorlink1= |last2= Gaertner |first2= Samuel L. |authorlink2= |editor1-first= Fiske |editor1-last= Susan T. |editor2-first= Daniel T. |editor2-last= Gilbert |editor3-first= Gardner | editor3-last=Lindzey |title=Handbook of Social Psychology |url= |edition= 5th |volume= Volume Two |year= 2010 |publisher= John Wiley |location= Hooboken, N.J. |isbn= 978-0-470-13747-5 |page= 1085 |pages= |chapter= Intergroup Bias |chapterurl= https://books.google.com/books?id=Pye5IkCFgRYC&amp;pg=PA1085&amp;lpg=PA1084 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The model explains the phenomenon that some out-groups are admired but disliked, whereas others are liked but disrespected. This model was empirically tested on a variety of national and international [[Sample (statistics)|samples]] and was found to reliably predict stereotype content.&lt;ref name="fiske et al. 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Cuddy |first1= Amy J.

==Functions==
Early studies suggested that stereotypes were only used by rigid, repressed, and authoritarian people. This idea has been refuted by contemporary studies that suggest the ubiquity of stereotypes and  it was suggested to regard stereotypes  as collective group beliefs, meaning that people who belong to the same social group share the same set of stereotypes.&lt;ref name="Tajfel (1981)"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Tajfel |first1= Henri |authorlink1= |authorlink2= |editor1-first= John C. |editor1-last= Turner |editor1-link= |editor2-first= Howard |editor2-last= Giles |title= Intergroup behaviour |url= |edition= |series= |volume= |year= 1981 |publisher= [[Wiley-Blackwell|Blackwell]] |location= Oxford |isbn= 978-0-631-11711-7 |page= |pages= 144&amp;ndash;167 |chapter= Social stereotypes and social groups |chapterurl= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern research asserts that full understanding of stereotypes requires considering them from two complementary perspectives: as shared within a particular culture/subculture and as formed in the mind of an individual person.&lt;ref&gt;Macrae CN, Stangor C, Hewstone M. (eds.) "Stereotypes and stereotyping." 1995, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationship between cognitive and social functions===
Stereotyping can serve cognitive functions on an interpersonal level, and social functions on an intergroup level.&lt;ref name="Cox et al. (2012)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tajfel (1981)"/&gt; For stereotyping to function on an intergroup level (see social identity approaches: [[social identity theory]] and [[self-categorization theory]]), an individual must see themselves as part of a group and being part of that group must also be salient for the individual.&lt;ref name="Tajfel (1981)"/&gt;

Craig McGarty, Russell Spears, and Vincent Y. Yzerbyt (2002) argued that the cognitive functions of stereotyping are best understood in relation to its social functions, and vice versa.&lt;ref name="McGarty Spears et al. (2002)"&gt;{{cite book |last1= McGarty |first1= Craig |authorlink1= |last3= Yzerbyt |first3= Vincent Y. |authorlink2= |last2= Spears | first2= Russel |editor1-link= |others= |title= Stereotypes as explanations: The formation of meaningful beliefs about social groups |url= |edition= |volume= |year= 2002 |publisher= Cambridge University Press |location= Cambridge |isbn= 978-0-521-80047-1 |page= |pages= 186&amp;ndash;199|chapter= Conclusion: stereotypes are selective, variable and contested explanations |chapterurl= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cognitive functions===
Stereotypes can help make sense of the world. They are a form of categorization that helps to simplify and systematize information. Thus, information is more easily identified, recalled, predicted, and reacted to.&lt;ref name="Tajfel (1981)"/&gt; Stereotypes are categories of objects or people. Between stereotypes, objects or people are as different from each other as possible.&lt;ref name="McGarty Yzerbyt et al. (2002)"/&gt; Within stereotypes, objects or people are as similar to each other as possible.&lt;ref name="McGarty Yzerbyt et al. (2002)"/&gt;

[[Gordon Allport]] has suggested possible answers to why people find it easier to understand categorized information.&lt;ref name="Allport (1954)"&gt;{{cite book |title= The Nature of Prejudice |last= Allport |first= Gordon W. |authorlink= Gordon Allport |year= 1954 |publisher= [[Addison-Wesley]] |location= Cambridge, MA |isbn= 978-0-201-00175-4 |page= 189 |pages= |accessdate= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; First, people can consult a category to identify response patterns. Second, categorized information is more specific than non-categorized information, as categorization accentuates properties that are shared by all members of a group. Third, people can readily describe objects in a category because objects in the same category have distinct characteristics. Finally, people can take for granted the characteristics of a particular category because the category itself may be an arbitrary grouping.

A complementary perspective theorizes how stereotypes function as time- and energy-savers that allow people to act more efficiently.&lt;ref name="McGarty Yzerbyt et al. (2002)"/&gt; Yet another perspective suggests that stereotypes are people's biased perceptions of their social contexts.&lt;ref name="McGarty Yzerbyt et al. (2002)"/&gt; In this view, people use stereotypes as shortcuts to make sense of their social contexts, and this makes a person's task of understanding his or her world less cognitively demanding.&lt;ref name="McGarty Yzerbyt et al. (2002)"/&gt;

===Social functions: social categorization===
In the following situations, the overarching purpose of stereotyping is for people to put their collective self (their in-group membership) in a positive light:&lt;ref name="Haslam et al. (2002)"&gt;Haslam, S. A., Turner, J. C., Oakes, P. J., Reynolds, K. J., &amp; Doosje, B. (2002). From personal pictures in the head to collective tools in the word: how shared stereotypes allow groups to represent and change social reality. In C. McGarty, V. Y. Yzerbyt, &amp; R. Spears (Eds.). Stereotypes as explanations: The formation of meaningful beliefs about social groups (pp. 157-185). Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
*when stereotypes are used for explaining social events
*when stereotypes are used for justifying activities of one's own group ([[ingroups and outgroups|ingroup]]) to another group ([[ingroups and outgroups|outgroup]])
*when stereotypes are used for differentiating the ingroup as positively distinct from outgroups

====Explanation purposes====
[[File:Antisemitic_caricature_1873.jpg|150px|thumb|An anti-semitic 1873 caricature depicting the stereotypical physical features of a Jewish male.]]
As mentioned previously, stereotypes can be used to explain social events.&lt;ref name="Tajfel (1981)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Haslam et al. (2002)"/&gt; [[Henri Tajfel]]&lt;ref name="Tajfel (1981)"/&gt; described his observations of how some people found that the anti-Semitic contents of [[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]] only made sense if Jews have certain characteristics. Therefore, according to Tajfel,&lt;ref name="Tajfel (1981)"/&gt; Jews were stereotyped as being evil and yearning for world domination to match the anti-Semitic ‘facts’ as presented in The Protocols of the Elders of Zion.

====Justification purposes====
People create stereotypes of an outgroup to justify the actions that their in-group has committed (or plans to commit) towards that outgroup.&lt;ref name="Tajfel (1981)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Allport (1954)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Haslam et al. (2002)"/&gt; For example, according to Tajfel,&lt;ref name="Tajfel (1981)"/&gt; Europeans stereotyped Turkish, Indian, and Chinese people as being incapable of achieving financial advances without European help. This stereotype was used to justify European colonialism in Turkey, India, and China.

====Intergroup differentiation====
An assumption is that people want their ingroup to have a positive image relative to outgroups, and so people want to differentiate their ingroup from relevant outgroups in a desirable way.&lt;ref name="Tajfel (1981)"/&gt; If an outgroup does not affect the ingroup’s image, then from an image preservation point of view, there is no point for the ingroup to be positively distinct from that outgroup.&lt;ref name="Tajfel (1981)"/&gt;

People can actively create certain images for relevant outgroups by stereotyping. People do so when they see that their ingroup is no longer as clearly and/or as positively differentiated from relevant outgroups, and they want to restore the intergroup differentiation to a state that favours the ingroup.&lt;ref name="Tajfel (1981)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Haslam et al.

===Social functions: self-categorization===
Stereotypes can emphasize a person’s group membership in two steps: Stereotypes emphasize the person’s similarities with ingroup members on relevant dimensions, and also the person’s differences from outgroup members on relevant dimensions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; People change the stereotype of their ingroups and outgroups to suit context.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Once an outgroup treats an ingroup member badly, they are more drawn to the members of their own group.&lt;ref&gt;Cadinu, Mara, et al. “Comparing Self-Stereotyping with In-Group-Stereotyping and Out-Group-Stereotyping in Unequal-Status Groups: The Case of Gender.” Comparing Self-Stereotyping with In-Group-Stereotyping and Out-Group-Stereotyping in Unequal-Status Groups:The Case of Gender, doi:10.1080/15298868.2012.712753.&lt;/ref&gt; This can be seen as members with in a group are able to relate to each other though a stereotype because of identical situations. A person can embrace a stereotype to avoid humiliation such as failing a task and blaming it on a stereotype.&lt;ref&gt;Burkley, Melissa, and Hart Blanton. “Endorsing a Negative in-Group Stereotype as a Self-Protective Strategy: Sacrificing the Group to Save the Self.” 13 Oct. 2006, doi:10.1016/j.jesp.2007.01.008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social functions: social influence and consensus===
Stereotypes are an indicator of ingroup consensus.&lt;ref name="Haslam et al. (2002)"/&gt; When there are intragroup disagreements over stereotypes of the ingroup and/or outgroups, ingroup members take collective action to prevent other ingroup members from diverging from each other.&lt;ref name="Haslam et al. (2002)"/&gt;

John C. Turner proposed in 1987&lt;ref name="Haslam et al. (2002)"/&gt; that if ingroup members disagree on an outgroup stereotype, then one of three possible collective actions follow: First, ingroup members may negotiate with each other and conclude that they have different outgroup stereotypes because they are stereotyping different subgroups of an outgroup (e.g., Russian gymnasts versus Russian boxers). Second, ingroup members may negotiate with each other, but conclude that they are disagreeing because of categorical differences amongst themselves. Accordingly, in this context, it is better to categorise ingroup members under different categories (e.g., Democrats versus Republican) than under a shared category (e.g., American). Finally, ingroup members may influence each other to arrive at a common outgroup stereotype.

==Formation==
Different disciplines give different accounts of how stereotypes develop: Psychologists may focus on an individual's experience with groups, patterns of communication about those groups, and intergroup conflict. As for sociologists, they may focus on the relations among different groups in a social structure. They suggest that stereotypes are the result of conflict, poor parenting, and inadequate mental and emotional development. Once stereotypes have formed, there are two main factors that explain their persistence. First, the cognitive effects of schematic processing (see [[schema (psychology)|schema]]) make it so that when a member of a group behaves as we expect, the behavior confirms and even strengthens existing stereotypes. Second, the affective or emotional aspects of prejudice render logical arguments against stereotypes ineffective in countering the power of emotional responses.&lt;ref&gt;Aronson, E., Wilson, T. D., &amp; Akert, R. M. (2010). Social Psychology (7th edition). New York: Pearson.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Correspondence bias===
{{Main|Correspondence bias}}
''Correspondence bias'' refers to the tendency to ascribe a person's behavior to [[disposition]] or personality, and to underestimate the extent to which situational factors elicited the behavior. Correspondence bias can play an important role in stereotype formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1= Mackie |first1= Diane M. |last2= Hamilton |first2= David L. |last3= Susskind |first3= Joshua |last4= Rosselli |first4= Francine |editor1-first= C.

For example, in a study by Roguer and Yzerbyt (1999) participants watched a video showing students who were randomly instructed to find arguments either for or against [[euthanasia]]. The students that argued in favor of euthanasia came from the same law department or from different departments. Results showed that participants attributed the students' responses to their attitudes although it had been made clear in the video that students had no choice about their position. Participants reported that group membership, i.e., the department that the students belonged to, affected the students' opinions about euthanasia. Law students were perceived to be more in favor of euthanasia than students from different departments despite the fact that a pretest had revealed that subjects had no preexisting expectations about attitudes toward euthanasia and the department that students belong to. The attribution error created the new stereotype that law students are more likely to support euthanasia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1= Rogier |first1= Anouk |last2= Yzerbyt |first2= Vincent |title= Social attribution, correspondence bias, and the emergence of stereotypes |year= 1999 |journal= Swiss Journal of Psychology |volume= 58 |issue= 4 |pages= 233&amp;ndash;240 |doi= 10.1024/1421-0185.58.4.233 |url= http://www.psor.ucl.ac.be/personal/yzerbyt/Rogier%20&amp;%20Yzerbyt%20SJP%201999.pdf |accessdate= 5 April 2013 |doi-broken-date= 2018-09-19 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130729071003/http://www.psor.ucl.ac.be/personal/yzerbyt/Rogier%20%26%20Yzerbyt%20SJP%201999.pdf |archive-date= 29 July 2013 |dead-url= yes |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nier et al. (2012) found that people who tend to draw dispositional inferences from behavior and ignore situational constraints are more likely to stereotype low-status groups as incompetent and high-status groups as competent. Participants listened to descriptions of two fictitious groups of [[Pacific Islander]]s, one of which was described as being higher in status than the other. In a second study, subjects rated actual groups&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; the poor and wealthy, women and men &amp;ndash; in the United States in terms of their competence. Subjects who scored high on the measure of correspondence bias stereotyped the poor, women, and the fictitious lower-status Pacific Islanders as incompetent whereas they stereotyped the wealthy, men, and the high-status Pacific Islanders as competent. The correspondence bias was a significant predictor of stereotyping even after controlling for other measures that have been linked to beliefs about low status groups, the [[just-world hypothesis]] and [[social dominance orientation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1= Nier |first1= Jason A. |last2= Bajaj |first2= Priya |last3= McLean |first3= Meghan C. |last4= Schwartz |first4= Elizabeth |title= Group status, perceptions of agency, and the correspondence bias: Attributional processes in the formation of stereotypes about high and low status groups |year= 2012 |journal= [[Group Processes &amp; Intergroup Relations]] |volume= 16|issue= 4|pages= 1&amp;ndash;12 |doi= 10.1177/1368430212454925 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Illusory correlation===
{{main|Illusory correlation}}
Research has shown that stereotypes can develop based on a cognitive mechanism known as illusory correlation&amp;nbsp;– an erroneous inference about the relationship between two events.&lt;ref name="McGarty Yzerbyt et al. (2002)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mullen&amp;johnson"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Mullen |first1= Brian |last2= Johnson |first2= Craig |year= 1990 |title= Distinctiveness-based illusory correlations and stereotyping: A meta-analytic integration |journal= [[British Journal of Social Psychology]] |volume= 29 |issue= 1 |pages= 11–28 |doi= 10.1111/j.2044-8309.1990.tb00883.x |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Meiser |first1= Thorsten |authorlink1= |authorlink2= |editor1-first= Klaus |editor1-last= Fiedler |editor1-link= |editor2-first= Peter |editor2-last= Justin |title= Information Sampling and Adaptive Cognition |url=|edition= |series= |volume= |year= 2006 |publisher= Cambridge University Press |location= Cambridge |isbn= 978-0-521-83159-8 |page= |pages= 183–209 |chapter= Contingency Learning and Biased Group Impressions |chapterurl= https://books.google.com/books?id=RMZL_2H8A4kC&amp;pg=PA183}}&lt;/ref&gt; If two statistically infrequent events co-occur, observers overestimate the frequency of co-occurrence of these events. The underlying reason is that rare, infrequent events are distinctive and [[Salience (neuroscience)|salient]] and, when paired, become even more so. The heightened salience results in more attention and more effective [[Encoding (memory)|encoding]], which strengthens the belief that the events are [[Correlation|correlated]].&lt;ref name="hamilton&amp;gifford"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Hamilton |first1= David L. |last2= Gifford |first2= Robert K. |year= 1976 |title= Illusory correlation in interpersonal perception: A cognitive basis of stereotypic judgments |journal= [[Journal of Experimental Social Psychology]] |volume= 12 |issue= 4 |pages= 392–407 |doi= 10.1016/S0022-1031(76)80006-6 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Berndsen et al.

In the intergroup context, illusory correlations lead people to misattribute rare behaviors or traits at higher rates to [[minority group]] members than to majority groups, even when both display the same proportion of the behaviors or traits. [[Black people]], for instance, are a minority group in the [[United States]] and interaction with blacks is a relatively infrequent event for an average [[white American]]. Similarly, undesirable behavior (e.g. [[crime]]) is statistically less frequent than desirable behavior. Since both events "blackness" and "undesirable behavior" are distinctive in the sense that they are infrequent, the combination of the two leads observers to overestimate the rate of co-occurrence.&lt;ref name="hamilton&amp;gifford"/&gt; Similarly, in workplaces where women are underrepresented and negative behaviors such as errors occur less frequently than positive behaviors, women become more strongly associated with mistakes than men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Moskowitz |first1= Gordon B. |authorlink1= Gordon Moskowitz |authorlink2= |editor1-link= |others= |title= Social Cognition: Understanding Self and Others |url=  https://books.google.com/books?id=_-NLW8Ynvp8C&amp;pg=PA182 |edition=  |volume=  |year= 2005 |publisher= [[Guilford Press]] |location= New York |isbn= 978-1-59385-085-2 |page= 182 |pages= |chapter= |chapterurl=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a landmark study, David Hamilton and Richard Gifford (1976) examined the role of illusory correlation in stereotype formation. Subjects were instructed to read descriptions of behaviors performed by members of groups A and B. Negative behaviors outnumbered positive actions and group B was smaller than group A, making negative behaviors and membership in group B relatively infrequent and distinctive. Participants were then asked who had performed a set of actions: a person of group A or group B. Results showed that subjects overestimated the frequency with which both distinctive events, membership in group B and negative behavior, co-occurred, and evaluated group B more negatively. This despite the fact the proportion of positive to negative behaviors was equivalent for both groups and that there was no actual correlation between group membership and behaviors.&lt;ref name="hamilton&amp;gifford"/&gt; Although Hamilton and Gifford found a similar effect for positive behaviors as the infrequent events, a [[Meta-analysis|meta-analytic]] review of studies showed that illusory correlation effects are stronger when the infrequent, distinctive information is negative.&lt;ref name="mullen&amp;johnson"/&gt;

Hamilton and Gifford's distinctiveness-based explanation of stereotype formation was subsequently extended.&lt;ref name="Berndsen et al. (2002)"/&gt; A 1994 study by McConnell, Sherman, and Hamilton found that people formed stereotypes based on information that was not distinctive at the time of presentation, but was considered distinctive at the time of judgement.&lt;ref name="McConnell et al. (1994)"/&gt; Once a person judges non-distinctive information in memory to be distinctive, that information is re-encoded and re-represented as if it had been distinctive when it was first processed.&lt;ref name="McConnell et al. (1994)"/&gt;

===Common environment===
One explanation for why stereotypes are shared is that they are the result of a common environment that stimulates people to react in the same way.&lt;ref name="McGarty Yzerbyt et al. (2002)"/&gt;

The problem with the ‘common environment’ is that explanation in general is that it does not explain how shared stereotypes can occur without direct stimuli.&lt;ref name="McGarty Yzerbyt et al. (2002)"/&gt; Research since the 1930s suggested that people are highly similar with each other in how they describe different racial and national groups, although those people have no personal experience with the groups they are describing.&lt;ref name="Katz &amp; Braly (1933)"/&gt;

===Socialization and upbringing===
Another explanation says that people are [[Socialisation|socialised]] to adopt the same stereotypes.&lt;ref name="McGarty Yzerbyt et al. (2002)"/&gt; Some psychologists believe that although stereotypes can be absorbed at any age, stereotypes are usually acquired in early childhood under the influence of parents, teachers, peers, and the media.

If stereotypes are defined by social values, then stereotypes only change as per changes in social values.&lt;ref name="McGarty Yzerbyt et al. (2002)"/&gt; The suggestion that stereotype content depend on social values reflects [[Walter Lippman]]'s argument in his 1922 publication that stereotypes are rigid because they cannot be changed at will.&lt;ref name="Katz &amp; Braly (1935)"/&gt;

Studies emerging since the 1940s refuted the suggestion that stereotype contents cannot be changed at will. Those studies suggested that one group’s stereotype of another group would become more or less positive depending on whether their intergroup relationship had improved or degraded.&lt;ref name="Katz &amp; Braly (1935)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Meenes (1943)"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Meenes |first1= Max |year= 1943 |title= A Comparison of Racial Stereotypes of 1935 and 1942 |journal= [[Journal of Social Psychology]] |volume= 17 |issue= 2 |pages= 327&amp;ndash;336 |doi= 10.1080/00224545.1943.9712287 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Haslam et al.

For example, after WWII, Black American students held a more negative stereotype of people from countries that were the United States’s WWII enemies.&lt;ref name="Katz &amp; Braly (1935)"/&gt; If there are no changes to an intergroup relationship, then relevant stereotypes do not change.&lt;ref name="Oakes et al. (1994)"&gt;Oakes, P. J., Haslam, S. A., &amp; Turner, J. C. (1994). Stereotyping and social reality. Oxford: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intergroup relations===
According to a third explanation, shared stereotypes are neither caused by the coincidence of common stimuli, nor by socialisation. This explanation posits that stereotypes are shared because group members are motivated to behave in certain ways, and stereotypes reflect those behaviours.&lt;ref name="McGarty Yzerbyt et al. (2002)"/&gt; It is important to note from this explanation that stereotypes are the consequence, not the cause, of intergroup relations. This explanation assumes that when it is important for people to acknowledge both their ingroup and outgroup, they will emphasise their difference from outgroup members, and their similarity to ingroup members.&lt;ref name="McGarty Yzerbyt et al. (2002)"/&gt;

==Activation==
The dual-process model of cognitive processing of stereotypes asserts that automatic activation of stereotypes is followed by a controlled processing stage, during which an individual may choose to disregard or ignore the stereotyped information that has been brought to mind.&lt;ref name="faculty.washington.edu"/&gt;

A number of studies have found that stereotypes are activated automatically. [[Patricia Devine]] (1989), for example, suggested that stereotypes are automatically activated in the presence of a member (or some symbolic equivalent) of a stereotyped group and that the unintentional activation of the stereotype is equally strong for high- and low-prejudice persons. Words related to the cultural stereotype of blacks were presented [[Subliminal stimuli|subliminally]]. During an ostensibly unrelated [[Impression formation|impression-formation]] task, subjects read a paragraph describing a race-unspecified target person's behaviors and rated the target person on several trait scales. Results showed that participants who received a high proportion of racial words rated the target person in the story as significantly more hostile than participants who were presented with a lower proportion of words related to the stereotype. This effect held true for both high- and low-prejudice subjects (as measured by the Modern Racism Scale). Thus, the racial stereotype was activated even for low-prejudice individuals who did not personally endorse it.&lt;ref name="faculty.washington.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Devine |first= Patricia G. |authorlink1= |last2= Monteith |first2= Margo J. |authorlink2= |editor1-first= Shelly |editor1-last= Chaiken |editor1-link= |editor2-first= Yaacov |editor2-last= Trope |others= |title= Dual-Process Theories in Social Psychology |url= |edition= |volume= |year= 1999 |publisher= Guilford Press |location= New York |isbn= 978-1-57230-421-5 |page= |pages= 341&amp;ndash;342 |chapter= Automaticty and Control in Stereotyping |chapterurl= https://books.google.com/books?id=5X_auIBx99EC&amp;pg=PA341}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bargh 1994"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Bargh |first= John A. |authorlink1= John Bargh |authorlink2= |editor1-first= Robert S. |editor1-last= Wyer |editor1-link= |editor2-first= Thomas K. |editor2-last= Srull |others= |title= Handbook of Social Cognition |url= |edition= 2nd |volume= Two |year= 1994 |publisher= Lawrence Earlbaum |location= Hillsdale, NJ |isbn= 978-0-8058-1056-1 |page= 21 |pages= |chapter= The Four Horsemen of Automaticity: Awareness, Intention, Efficiency, Control in Social Cognition |chapterurl= https://books.google.com/books?id=5ncW0DyNqVwC&amp;pg=PA21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies using alternative priming methods have shown that the activation of gender and age stereotypes can also be automatic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Banaji |first1= Mahzarin R. |last2= Hardin |first2= Curtis D. |year= 1996 |title= Automatic Stereotyping |journal= [[Psychological Science (journal)|Psychological Science]] |volume= 7 |issue= 3 |pages= 136&amp;ndash;141 |doi= 10.1111/j.1467-9280.1996.tb00346.x |url= http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~mrbworks/articles/1996_PsySci.pdf |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Perdue |first1= Charles W. |last2= Gurtman |first2= Michael B. |year= 1990 |title= Evidence for the automaticity of ageism |journal= Journal of Experimental Social Psychology |volume= 26 |issue= 3 |pages= 199&amp;ndash;216 |doi= 10.1016/0022-1031(90)90035-K |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent research suggested that the relation between category activation and stereotype activation was more complex.&lt;ref name="Bargh 1994"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Brown |first1= Rupert |authorlink1= |authorlink2= |editor1-link= |others= |title= Prejudice: Its Social Psychology |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=PygYKbRoZjcC&amp;pg=PA88 |edition= 2nd |year= 2010 |publisher= [[Wiley-Blackwell]] |location= Oxford |isbn= 978-1-4051-1306-9 |page= |pages= 88 |chapter= |chapterurl= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lepore and Brown (1997), for instance, noted that the words used in Devine's study were both neutral category labels (e.g., "Blacks") and stereotypic attributes (e.g., "lazy"). They argued that if only the neutral category labels were presented, people high and low in prejudice would respond differently. In a design similar to Devine's, Lepore and Brown [[Priming (psychology)|primed]] the category of African-Americans using labels such as "blacks" and "West Indians" and then assessed the differential activation of the associated stereotype in the subsequent impression-formation task. They found that high-prejudice participants increased their ratings of the target person on the negative stereotypic dimensions and decreased them on the positive dimension whereas low-prejudice subjects tended in the opposite direction. The results suggest that the level of prejudice and stereotype endorsement affects people's judgements when the category&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; and not the stereotype per se &amp;ndash; is primed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Lepore |first1= Lorella |last2= Brown |first2= Rupert |year= 1997 |title= Category and Stereotype Activation: Is Prejudice Inevitable? |journal= Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume= 72 |issue= 2 |pages= 275&amp;ndash;287 |doi= 10.1037/0022-3514.72.2.275 |url= http://www.atkinson.yorku.ca/~jsteele/PDF/Optional%20Readings/Lepore_Brown_JPSP_1997.pdf |accessdate=  |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140102191944/http://www.atkinson.yorku.ca/~jsteele/PDF/Optional%20Readings/Lepore_Brown_JPSP_1997.pdf |archive-date= 2 January 2014 |dead-url= yes |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research has shown that people can be trained to activate [[Counterstereotype|counterstereotypic]] information and thereby reduce the automatic activation of negative stereotypes. In a study by Kawakami et al. (2000), for example, participants were presented with a category label and taught to respond "No" to stereotypic traits and "Yes" to nonstereotypic traits. After this training period, subjects showed reduced stereotype activation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Kawakami |first1= Kerry |year= 2000 |title= Just say no (to stereotyping): effects of training in the negation of stereotypic associations on stereotype activation |journal= Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume= 78 |issue= 5 |pages= 871&amp;ndash;888|doi= 10.1037/0022-3514.78.5.871  |url= |pmid=10821195|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gawronski et al. 2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Gawronski |first1= Bertram |year= 2008 |title= When "Just Say No" is not enough: Affirmation versus negation training and the reduction of automatic stereotype activation |journal= Journal of Experimental Social Psychology |volume= 44 |issue= 2 |pages= 370–377 |doi= 10.1016/j.jesp.2006.12.004 |url= |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; This effect is based on the learning of new and more [[positive stereotype]]s rather than the negation of already existing ones.&lt;ref name="Gawronski et al. 2008"/&gt;

In another experiment, Bargh, Chen, and Burrows also found that because the stereotype about blacks includes the notion of aggression, subliminal exposure to black faces increased the likelihood that randomly selected white college students reacted with more aggression and hostility than participants who subconsciously viewed a white face.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1= Bargh |first1= John A. |last2= Chen |first2= Mark |last3= Burrows |first3= Lara |title= Automaticity of Social Behavior: Direct Effects of Trait Construct and Stereotype Activation on Action |year= 1996 |journal= Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume= 71 |issue= 2 |pages= 230&amp;ndash;244 |url= http://www.yale.edu/acmelab/articles/bargh_chen_burrows_1996.pdf |accessdate= 10 June 2013 |doi= 10.1037/0022-3514.71.2.230 |pmid=8765481|citeseerx= 10.1.1.320.8563 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Correll et al. (2002) showed that activated stereotypes about blacks can influence people's behavior. In a series of experiments, black and white participants played a [[video game]], in which a black or white person was shown holding a [[gun]] or a harmless object (e.g., a [[mobile phone]]). Participants had to decide as quickly as possible whether to shoot the target. When the target person was armed, both black and white participants were faster in deciding to shoot the target when he was black than when he was white. When the target was unarmed, the participants avoided shooting him more quickly when he was white. Time pressure made the shooter bias even more pronounced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1= Correll |first1= Joshua |last2= Park |first2= Bernadette |last3= Judd |first3= Charles M. |last4= Wittenbrink |first4= Bernd |title= The Police Officer's Dilemma: Using Ethnicity to Disambiguate Potentially Threatening Individuals |year= 2002 |journal= Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume= 83 |issue= 6 |pages= 1314&amp;ndash;1329 |url= http://defiant.ssc.uwo.ca/undergraduate/psych2720e/the%20police%20officer%27s%20dilemma.pdf |accessdate= 10 June 2013 |doi= 10.1037/0022-3514.83.6.1314|citeseerx= 10.1.1.466.7243 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects==

===Attributional ambiguity===
{{main|Attributional ambiguity}}
Attributive ambiguity refers to the uncertainty that members of stereotyped groups experience in interpreting the causes of others' behavior toward them. Stereotyped individuals who receive negative [[feedback]] can [[Attribution (psychology)|attribute]] it either to personal shortcomings, such as lack of ability or poor effort, or the evaluator's stereotypes and prejudice toward their social group. Alternatively, positive feedback can either be attributed to personal merit or discounted as a form of [[sympathy]] or [[pity]].&lt;ref name="zemore-fiske-kim"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Zemore |first1= Sarah E. |authorlink1= |last2= Fiske |first2= Susan T. |authorlink2= |last3= Kim |first3= Hyun-Jeong |editor1-first= Thomas |editor1-last= Eckes |editor1-link= |editor2-first= Hanns Martin |editor2-last= Trautner |title= The Developmental Social Psychology of Gender |url= |edition= |volume=  |year= 2000 |publisher= Lawrence Erlbaum Associates |location= Mahwah, NJ |isbn= 978-0-585-30065-8 |page= |pages=229&amp;ndash;230 |chapter= Gender Stereotypes and the Dynamics of Social Interaction |chapterurl= https://books.google.com/books?id=yJ43_5tJGycC&amp;pg=PA229 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="crocker-major-steele"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Crocker |first1= Jennifer |authorlink1= |last2= Major |first2= Brenda |authorlink2= |last3= Stelle |first3= Claude |editor1-first= Daniel T. |editor1-last= Gilbert |editor1-link= |editor2-first= Susan T. |editor2-last= Fiske |editor3-first= Gardner |editor3-last= Lindzey |title= The Handbook of Social Psychology |url= |edition= 4th |series= |volume= Volume Two |year= 1998 |publisher= Oxford University Press |location= Oxford |isbn= 978-0-19-521376-8 |page= |pages= 519&amp;ndash;521 |chapter= Social Stigma |chapterurl= https://books.google.com/books?id=w27pSuHLnLYC&amp;pg=PA519 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Whiteley |first1= Bernard E. |authorlink1= |last2= Kite |first2= Mary E. |authorlink2= |editor1-link= |others= |title= The Psychology of Prejudice and Discrimination |url=  https://books.google.com/books?id=mXSJEjl4uZYC&amp;pg=PA428 |edition= 2nd |series= |volume= |year= 2010 |publisher= Wadsworth Cengage Learning |location= Belmont, CA |isbn= 978-0-495-59964-7 |page= |pages= 428&amp;ndash;435 |chapter= |chapterurl= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jennifer Crocker|Crocker]] et al. (1991) showed that when black participants were evaluated by a white person who was aware of their race, black subjects mistrusted the feedback, attributing negative feedback to the evaluator's stereotypes and positive feedback to the evaluator's desire to appear unbiased. When the black participants' race was unknown to the evaluator, they were more accepting of the feedback.&lt;ref name="Crocker et al."&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Crocker |first1= Jennifer |last2= Voelkl |first2= Kristin |last3= Testa |first3= Maria |last4= Major |first4= Brenda |year= 1991 |title= Social stigma: The affective consequences of attributional ambiguity |journal= [[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] |volume= 60 |issue= 2 |pages= 218&amp;ndash; 228|doi= 10.1037/0022-3514.60.2.218 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Attributional ambiguity has been shown to affect a person's [[self-esteem]]. When they receive positive evaluations, stereotyped individuals are uncertain of whether they really deserved their success and, consequently, they find it difficult to take credit for their achievements. In the case of negative feedback, ambiguity has been shown to have a protective effect on self-esteem as it allows people to assign blame to external causes. Some studies, however, have found that this effect only holds when stereotyped individuals can be absolutely certain that their negative outcomes are due to the evaluators's prejudice. If any room for uncertainty remains, stereotyped individuals tend to blame themselves.&lt;ref name="crocker-major-steele"/&gt;

Attributional ambiguity can also make it difficult to assess one's skills because performance-related evaluations are mistrusted or discounted. Moreover, it can lead to the belief that one's efforts are not directly linked to the outcomes, thereby depressing one's [[motivation]] to succeed.&lt;ref name="zemore-fiske-kim"/&gt;

[[Claude Steele|Claude M. Steele]] and Joshua Aronson conducted the first experiments showing that stereotype threat can depress intellectual performance on [[standardized test]]s. In one study, they found that black college students performed worse than white students on a verbal test when the task was framed as a measure of intelligence. When it was not presented in that manner, the performance gap narrowed. Subsequent experiments showed that framing the test as diagnostic of intellectual ability made black students more aware of negative stereotypes about their group, which in turn impaired their performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Steele |first1= Claude M. |last2= Aronson |first2= Joshua |title= Stereotype threat and the intellectual test performance of African Americans |journal= Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume= 69 |issue= 5 |pages= 797–811 |date=November 1995 |pmid= 7473032 |doi= 10.1037/0022-3514.69.5.797 |url= http://users.nber.org/~sewp/events/2005.01.14/Bios+Links/Good-rec2-Steele_&amp;_Aronson_95.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stereotype threat effects have been demonstrated for an array of social groups in many different arenas, including not only academics but also sports,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Stone |first1= Jeff |last2= Lynch |first2= Christian I. |last3= Sjomeling |first3= Mike |last4= Darley |first4= John M. |title= Stereotype threat effects on Black and White athletic performance |journal= Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume= 77 |issue= 6 |year= 1999 |pages= 1213–1227 |doi= 10.1037/0022-3514.77.6.1213 |citeseerx= 10.1.1.687.5039 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[chess]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Maass |first1= Anne |last2= D'Ettole |first2= Claudio |last3= Cadinu |first3= Mara |title= Checkmate?

{{ISBN|0-275-96103-6}},Praeger Publishers, 88 Post Road West, Westport, CT 06881, pages 513-515: "the phenomenon of stereotype threat can be explained in terms of a
more general construct, test anxiety, which has been studied since the early days
of psychometrics. Test anxiety tends to lower performance levels on tests
in proportion to the degree of complexity and the amount of mental effort they
require of the subject. The relatively greater effect of test anxiety in the black
samples, who had somewhat lower SAT scores, than the white subjects in the
Stanford experiments constitutes an example of the Yerkes-Dodson law ... by conducting the same type of experiment using exclusively white (or black)
subjects, divided into lower- and higher-ability groups, it might be shown that
the phenomenon attributed to stereotype threat has nothing to do with race as
such, but results from the interaction of ability level with test anxiety as a

===Self-fulfilling prophecy===
{{Main|Self-fulfilling prophecy}}
Stereotypes lead people to expect certain actions from members of social groups. These stereotype-based expectations may lead to self-fulfilling prophecies, in which one's inaccurate expectations about a person's behavior, through social interaction, prompt that person to act in stereotype-consistent ways, thus confirming one's erroneous expectations and validating the stereotype.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Kassin |first1= Saul M. |authorlink1= |last2= Fein |first2= Steven |authorlink2= |last3= Markus |first3= Hazel Rose |editor1-link= |others= |title= Social psychology |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=3aCdjhGxDjgC&amp;pg=PA172 |edition= 8th |volume= |year= 2011 |publisher= Wadsworth, [[Cengage Learning]] |location= Belmont, CA |isbn= 978-0-495-81240-1 |page= |pages= 172 |chapter= |chapterurl= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Brown |first1= Rupert |authorlink1= |authorlink2= |editor1-link= |others= |title= Prejudice: Its Social Psychology |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=PygYKbRoZjcC&amp;pg=PA94 |edition= 2nd |year= 2010 |publisher= Wiley-Blackwell |location= Oxford |isbn= 978-1-4051-1306-9 |page= |pages= 94&amp;ndash;97 |chapter= |chapterurl= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1= Chen |first1= Mark |last2= Bargh |first2= John A. |year= 1997 |title= Nonconscious Behavioral Confirmation Processes: The Self-Fulfilling Consequences of Automatic Stereotype Activation |journal= [[Journal of Experimental Social Psychology]] |volume= 33 |issue= 5 |pages= 541–560 |doi= 10.1006/jesp.1997.1329 |url= http://www.yale.edu/acmelab/articles/Chen_Bargh_1997.pdf |accessdate= 5 April 2013 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130522080900/http://www.yale.edu/acmelab/articles/Chen_Bargh_1997.pdf |archive-date= 22 May 2013 |dead-url= yes |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Word, [[Mark Zanna|Zanna]], and Cooper (1974) demonstrated the effects of stereotypes in the context of a [[job interview]]. White participants interviewed black and white subjects who, prior to the experiments, had been trained to act in a standardized manner. Analysis of the videotaped interviews showed that black job applicants were treated differently: They received shorter amounts of interview time and less eye contact; interviewers made more speech errors (e.g., [[Stuttering|stutters]], sentence incompletions, incoherent sounds) and physically distanced themselves from black applicants. In a second experiment, trained interviewers were instructed to treat applicants, all of whom were white, like the whites or blacks had been treated in the first experiment. As a result, applicants treated like the blacks of the first experiment behaved in a more nervous manner and received more negative performance ratings than interviewees receiving the treatment previously afforded to whites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Word |first1= Carl O. |last2= Zanna |first2= Mark P. |last3= Cooper |first3= Joel |year= 1974 |title= The nonverbal mediation of self-fulfilling prophecies in interracial interaction |journal= Journal of Experimental Social Psychology |volume= 10 |issue= 2 |pages= 109&amp;ndash;120 |doi= 10.1016/0022-1031(74)90059-6 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1977 study by Snyder, Tanke, and [[Ellen S. Berscheid|Berscheid]] found a similar pattern in social interactions between men and women. Male [[Undergraduate education|undergraduate students]] were asked to talk to female undergraduates, whom they believed to be [[Physical attractiveness|physically attractive]] or unattractive, on the phone. The conversations were taped and analysis showed that men who thought that they were talking to an attractive woman communicated in a more positive and friendlier manner than men who believed that they were talking to unattractive women. This altered the women's behavior: Female subjects who, unknowingly to them, were perceived to be physically attractive behaved in a friendly, likeable, and sociable manner in comparison with subjects who were regarded as unattractive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Snyder |first1= Mark |last2= Tanke |first2= Elizabeth D. |last3= Berscheid |first3= Ellen |year= 1977 |title= Social perception and interpersonal behavior: On the self-fulfilling nature of social stereotypes |journal= Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume= 35 |issue= 9 |pages= 656&amp;ndash;666 |doi= 10.1037/0022-3514.35.9.656 |url= http://jefferson.library.millersville.edu/reserve/COMM301_Paul_SocialPerception.pdf |accessdate=  |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120617031954/http://jefferson.library.millersville.edu/reserve/COMM301_Paul_SocialPerception.pdf |archive-date= 17 June 2012 |dead-url= yes |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2005 study by J. Thomas Kellow and Brett  D. Jones looked at the effects of self-fulfilling prophecy on African American and Caucasian high school freshman students. Both white and black students were informed that their test performance would be predictive of their performance on a statewide, high stakes [[standardized test]]. They were also told that historically, white students had outperformed black students on the test. This knowledge created a self-fulfilling prophecy in both the white and black students, where the white students scored statistically significantly higher than the African American students on the test. The [[stereotype threat]] of underperforming on standardized tests effected the African American students in this study.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kellow|first=Thomas|date=February 2008|title=The Effects of Stereotypes on the Achievement Gap: Reexamining the Academic Performance of African American High School Students|journal=Journal of Black Psychology|volume=34|pages=94-120|doi=10.1177/0095798407310537|citeseerx=10.1.1.553.9188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Discrimination===
Because stereotypes simplify and justify social reality, they have potentially powerful effects on how people perceive and treat one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Banaji |first1= Mahzarin R. |authorlink1= Mahzarin Banaji |authorlink2= |editor1-first= Neil |editor1-last= Smelser |editor1-link= |editor2-first= Paul |editor2-last= Baltes |title= International Encyclopedia of the Social and Behavioral Sciences |url= |edition= |volume= |year= 2002 |publisher= [[Pergamon Press|Pergamon]] |location= New York |isbn= 978-0-08-043076-8 |doi= 10.1016/B0-08-043076-7/01754-X |page= |pages= 15100–15104 |chapter= The Social Psychology of Stereotypes |chapterurl= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, stereotypes can lead to [[discrimination]] in labor markets and other domains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Fiske |first1= Susan T. |authorlink1= |last2= Lee |first2= Tiane L. |authorlink2= |editor1-first= Arthur P |editor1-last= Brief |editor1-link= |others= |title= Diversity at Work |url= |edition= |volume= |year= 2008 |publisher= Cambridge University Press |location= New York |isbn= 978-0-521-86030-7 |page= |pages= 13&amp;ndash;52|chapter= Stereotypes and prejudice create workplace discrimination |chapterurl= https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=8edJmBsyRHwC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Tilcsik (2011) has found that employers who seek job applicants with stereotypically male [[Heterosexuality|heterosexual]] traits are particularly likely to engage in discrimination against [[gay]] men, suggesting that discrimination on the basis of [[sexual orientation]] is partly rooted in specific stereotypes and that these stereotypes loom large in many labor markets.&lt;ref name=Tilcsik/&gt; Agerström and Rooth (2011) showed that automatic [[obesity]] stereotypes captured by the [[Implicit Association Test]] can predict real hiring discrimination against the obese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Agerström |first1= Jens |last2= Rooth |first2= Dan-Olof |year= 2011 |title= The role of automatic obesity stereotypes in real hiring discrimination |journal= Journal of Applied Psychology |volume= 96 |issue= 4 |pages= 790&amp;ndash;805 |doi= 10.1037/a0021594 |pmid= 21280934 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, experiments suggest that gender stereotypes play an important role in judgments that affect [[Recruitment|hiring]] decisions.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Davison |first1= Heather K. |last2= Burke |first2= Michael J. |year= 2000 |title= Sex Discrimination in Simulated Employment Contexts: A Meta-analytic Investigation |journal= Journal of Vocational Behavior |volume= 56 |issue= 2 |pages= 225–248 |doi= 10.1006/jvbe.1999.1711 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Rudman |first= Laurie A. |last2= Glick |first2= Peter |year= 2001 |title= Prescriptive Gender Stereotypes and Backlash toward Agentic Women |journal= [[Journal of Social Issues]] |volume= 57 |issue= 4 |pages= 743–762 |doi= 10.1111/0022-4537.00239 |url= https://wesfiles.wesleyan.edu/courses/PSYC-309-clwilkins/Week3/Rudman.Glick.2001.pdf |accessdate=  |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20121106121608/https://wesfiles.wesleyan.edu/courses/PSYC-309-clwilkins/Week3/Rudman.Glick.2001.pdf |archive-date= 6 November 2012 |dead-url= yes |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Self-stereotyping===
{{Main|Self-stereotyping}}
Stereotypes can affect self-evaluations and lead to self-stereotyping.&lt;ref name="Cox et al. (2012)"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Sinclair |first1= Stacey |authorlink1= |last2= Huntsinger |first2= Jeff |authorlink2= |editor1-first= Shana |editor1-last= Levin |editor1-link= |editor2-first= Colette |editor2-last= Van Laar |title= Stigma and Group Inequality: Social Psychological Perspectives |url= |edition= |series= Claremont Symposium on Applied Social Psychology |volume= |year= 2006 |publisher= [[Taylor &amp; Francis|Lawrence Erlbaum Associates]] |location= Mahwah, NJ |isbn= 978-0-8058-4415-3 |page= 239 |pages= |chapter= The Interpersonal Basis of Self-Stereotyping |chapterurl= https://books.google.com/books?id=7WtgXfECza8C&amp;pg=PA239 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, Correll (2001, 2004) found that specific stereotypes (e.g., the stereotype that women have lower mathematical ability) affect women's and men's evaluations of their abilities (e.g., in math and science), such that men assess their own task ability higher than women performing at the same level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Correll |first1= Shelley J. |year= 2001 |title= Gender and the career choice process: The role of biased self-assessments |journal= American Journal of Sociology |volume= 106 |issue= 6 |pages= 1691&amp;ndash;1730 |doi= 10.1086/321299 |url= http://www.chaire-crsng-inal.fsg.ulaval.ca/fileadmin/docs/documents/Article/Gender_and_career_choice_process_2001.pdf |accessdate=  |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110912043942/http://www.chaire-crsng-inal.fsg.ulaval.ca/fileadmin/docs/documents/Article/Gender_and_career_choice_process_2001.pdf |archivedate= 12 September 2011 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Correll |first1= Shelley J. |year= 2004 |title= Constraints into Preferences: Gender, Status, and Emerging Career Aspirations |journal= [[American Sociological Review]] |volume= 69 |issue= 1 |pages= 93&amp;ndash;113 |doi= 10.1177/000312240406900106 |url= http://people.uncw.edu/maumem/soc500/Correll2004.pdf |accessdate= |citeseerx= 10.1.1.520.8370 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, a study by Sinclair et al. (2006) has shown that Asian American women rated their math ability more favorably when their ethnicity and the relevant stereotype that Asian Americans excel in math was made salient. In contrast, they rated their math ability less favorably when their gender and the corresponding stereotype of women's inferior math skills was made salient. Sinclair et al. found, however, that the effect of stereotypes on self-evaluations is [[Mediation (statistics)|mediated]] by the degree to which close people in someone's life endorse these stereotypes. People's self-stereotyping can increase or decrease depending on whether close others view them in stereotype-consistent or inconsistent manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Sinclair |first1= Stacey |last2= Hardin |first2= Curtis D. |last3= Lowery |first3= Brian S. |title= Self-Stereotyping in the Context of Multiple Social Identities |journal= Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |year= 2006 |volume= 90 |issue= 4 |pages= 529–542 |doi= 10.1037/0022-3514.90.4.529 |url= http://psych.princeton.edu/psychology/research/sinclair/pubs/self%20stereo%20and%20multiple%20identities.PDF |accessdate=  |pmid= 16649853 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140827125537/http://psych.princeton.edu/psychology/research/sinclair/pubs/self%20stereo%20and%20multiple%20identities.PDF |archive-date= 27 August 2014 |dead-url= yes |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stereotyping can also play a central role in depression, when people have negative self-stereotypes about themselves, according to [[William T. L. Cox|Cox]], [[Lyn Yvonne Abramson|Abramson]], [[Patricia Devine|Devine]], and Hollon (2012).&lt;ref name="Cox et al. (2012)"/&gt; This depression that is caused by prejudice (i.e., "deprejudice") can be related to a group membership (e.g., Me–Gay–Bad) or not (e.g., Me–Bad). If someone holds prejudicial beliefs about a stigmatized group and then becomes a member of that group, they may internalize their prejudice and develop depression. People may also show prejudice internalization through self-stereotyping because of negative childhood experiences such as verbal and physical abuse.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

=== Substitute for observations ===
Stereotypes are traditional and familiar symbol clusters, expressing a more or less complex idea in a convenient way. They are often simplistic pronouncements about gender, racial, ethnic, and cultural backgrounds and they can become a source of misinformation and delusion. For example, in a school when students are confronted with the task of writing a theme, they think in terms of literary associations, often using stereotypes picked up from books, films, and magazines that they have read or viewed.

The danger in stereotyping lies not in its existence, but in the fact that it can become a substitute for observation and a misinterpretation of a [[cultural identity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=HAYAKAWA|first=S. I.|date=1950|title=RECOGNIZING STEREOTYPES AS SUBSTITUTES FOR THOUGHT|jstor=42581302|journal=ETC: A Review of General Semantics|volume=7|issue=3|pages=208–210}}&lt;/ref&gt; Promoting [[information literacy]] is a pedagogical approach that can effectively combat the entrenchment of stereotypes. The necessity for using information literacy to separate multicultural "fact from fiction" is well illustrated with examples from literature and media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://search.proquest.com/openview/c9296b8ae9e329bdded001fbbe51f7a4/1?pq-origsite|title=Using information literacy to promote critical thinking - ProQuest|website=search.proquest.com|access-date=2018-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role in art and culture==
{{refimprove section|date=February 2012}}
[[File:TheUsualIrishWayofDoingThings.jpg|thumb|200px|American political cartoon titled ''The Usual Irish Way of Doing Things'', depicting a drunken Irishman lighting a powder keg and swinging a bottle. Published in ''[[Harper's Weekly]]'', 1871.]]Stereotypes are common in various cultural [[Media (communication)|media]], where they take the form of dramatic [[stock character]]s. The instantly recognizable nature of stereotypes mean that they are effective in [[advertising]] and [[situation comedy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tedb.byu.edu/?page_id=35|title=Lesson 2 – Stock Characters {{!}} BYU Theatre Education Database|last=|first=|date=|website=tedb.byu.edu|access-date=2018-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander Fedorov (2015) proposed a concept of media stereotypes analysis. This concept refers to identification and analysis of stereotypical images of people, ideas, events, stories, themes and etc. in media context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fedorov|first1=Alexander|title=Media Stereotypes Analysis in the Classroom at the Student Audience|journal=European Journal of Contemporary Education|date=2015|volume=12|issue=2|page=158|doi=10.13187/ejced.2015.12.158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The characters that do appear in movies greatly effect how people worldwide perceive gender relations, race, and cultural communities. Because approximately 85% of worldwide ticket sales are directed toward Hollywood movies, the American movie industry has been greatly responsible for portraying characters of different cultures and diversity to fit into stereotypical categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Kevin|date=January 2008|title="The Little State Department": Hollywood and the MPAA's Influence on U.S. Trade Relations|url=https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1671&amp;context=njilb|journal=Northwestern Journal of International Law &amp; Business|volume= 28| issue = 2|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has led to the spread and persistence of gender, racial, ethnic, and cultural stereotypes seen in the movies.&lt;sup&gt;[[Stereotype#cite note-89|[89]]]&lt;/sup&gt;

For example, portrayals of [[Latin America]]ns in film and print media are restricted to a narrow set of characters. Latin Americans are largely depicted as sexualized figures such as the Latino [[Machismo|macho]] or the Latina vixen, [[gang]] members, (illegal) immigrants, or entertainers. By comparison, they are rarely portrayed as working professionals, business leaders or politicians.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood films]], there are several Latin American stereotypes that have historically been used. Some examples are El Bandido, the Halfbreed Harlot, The Male Buffoon, The Female Clown, The Latin Lover, The Dark Lady, The Wise Old Man, and The Poor Peon. Many hispanic characters in hollywood films consists of one or more of these basic stereotypes, but it has been rare to view Latin American actors representing characters outside of this stereotypical criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berg|first=Charles|date=Summer 1990|title=Stereotyping in films in general and of the Hispanic in Particular|url=http://eds.b.ebscohost.com.libproxy.unh.edu/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=1&amp;sid=2022b66f-786b-4950-82f4-c9f5272dc9eb%40sessionmgr103|journal=The Howard Journal of Communications|volume=2|pages=294–296}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Media stereotypes of women first emerged in the early 20th century. Various stereotypic depictions or "types" of women appeared in magazines, including Victorian ideals of femininity, the [[New Woman]], the [[Gibson Girl]], the [[Femme fatale]], and the [[Flapper]].&lt;sup&gt;[[Stereotype#cite note-88|[88]]]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=COLTRANE|first=SCOTT|last2=ADAMS|first2=MICHELE|date=|title=Work–Family Imagery and Gender Stereotypes:Television and the Reproduction of Difference|url=|journal=Journal of Vocational Behavior|volume=50|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stereotypes are also common in video games, with women being portrayed as stereotypes such as the "[[damsel in distress]]" or as [[sexual object]]s (see [[Gender representation in video games]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://msu.edu/~pengwei/Mou&amp;Peng_gender%20and%20racial%20stereotype.pdf|title=Gender and Racial Stereotypes in Popular Video Games|last=Mou|first=Yi|last2=Peng|first2=Wei|date=|website=Michigan State University|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies show that minorities are portrayed most often in stereotypical roles such as athletes and gangsters (see [[Race and video games|Racial representations in video games]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Burgess|first=Melinda|last2=Dill|first2=Karen|date=15 Sep 2011|title=Playing With Prejudice: The Prevalence and Consequences of Racial Stereotypes in Video Games|url=|journal=Media Psychology|volume= 14|issue=3|pages=289-311|doi=10.1080/15213269.2011.596467|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[literature]] and [[art]], stereotypes are [[cliché]]d or predictable characters or situations. Throughout history, storytellers have drawn from stereotypical characters and situations to immediately connect the audience with new tales.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Auracher|first=Jan|last2=Hirose|first2=Akiko|date=2017|title=The Influence of Reader's Stereotypes on the Assessment of Fictional Characters|jstor=10.5325/complitstudies.54.4.0795|journal=Comparative Literature Studies|volume=54|issue=4|pages=795–823|doi=10.5325/complitstudies.54.4.0795|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Uses of Literacy''''' is a book written by [[Richard Hoggart]] and published in 1957, examining the [[influence of mass media]] in the United Kingdom. The book has been described as a key influence in the history of English and [[media studies]] and in the founding of [[cultural studies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nate.org.uk/index.php?page=3&amp;rev=164|title=Welcome - NATE|website=NATE|accessdate=9 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ISBN=0415079063|title=Culture, media, language: working papers in cultural studies, 1972-79|first=Stuart|last=Hall|publisher=Routledge|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Massification of culture==
''The Uses of Literacy'' was an attempt to understand the changes in [[British culture|culture in Britain]] caused by "massification". It has been described as marking a "watershed in public perception of culture and class and shifted academic parameters".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|editor=Sue Owen|title=Richard Hoggart and Cultural Studies|year=2008|ISBN=9780230545458}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hoggart's argument is that "the mass publicists" were made "more insistently, effectively and in a more comprehensive and centralised form today than they were earlier" and "that we are moving towards the creation of a mass culture, that the remnants of what was at least in part an urban culture 'of the people' are being destroyed".&lt;ref name="librarything.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.librarything.com/work/15276|title=The Uses of Literacy by Richard Hoggart|website=LibraryThing.com|accessdate=9 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The "drift"==
In his study Hoggart looks at [[pulp magazine|pulp fiction]], popular magazines and newspapers and the movies and finds in all of these, "drift". He documents the break-up of the old, class culture, lamenting the loss of the close-knit communities and their replacement by the emerging manufactured mass culture. Key features of this are the tabloid newspapers, advertising, and the triumph of Hollywood. These "alien" phenomena have colonized local communities and robbed them of their distinctive features. Hoggart's attack is not on popular culture; rather it is on mass culture which is imposed from above. "Popular culture" being self-created has a fundamental integrity and evolves according to its own laws and dictates, not as a result of the mass media.&lt;ref name="librarything.com"/&gt;

{{Political anthropology|expanded=Basic concepts}}

A '''tribal chief''' is the leader of a [[tribe|tribal society]] or [[chiefdom]].

==Description==
Tribal societies with [[social stratification]] under a single (or [[Diarchy|dual]]) leader emerged in the [[Neolithic]] period out of earlier tribal structures with little stratification, and they remained prevalent throughout the [[Iron Age]].

In the case of  [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] tribal societies existing within larger colonial and post-colonial states, tribal chiefs may represent their tribe or ethnicity in a form of [[self-government]].

The most common types are the chairman of a council (usually of "[[Elder (administrative title)|elder]]s") and/or a broader [[popular assembly]] in "parliamentary" cultures, the war chief (may be an alternative or additional post in war time), the hereditary chief, and the politically dominant [[medicineman]] (in "[[theocracy|theocratic]]" cultures).

The term is usually distinct from chiefs at lower levels, such as [[village headman|village chief]] (geographically defined) or [[clan chief]] (an essentially genealogical notion). The descriptive "tribal" requires an ethno-cultural identity (racial, linguistic, religious etc.) as well as some political (representative, legislative, executive and/or judicial) expression. In certain situations, and especially in a [[Colonialism|colonial]] context, the most powerful member of either a [[confederation]] or a [[federation]] of such tribal, clan or village chiefs would be referred to as a [[paramount chief]]. This term has largely fallen out of use, however, and such personages are now often called [[king]]s.

A woman who holds a chieftaincy in her own right or who derives one from her marriage to a male chief has been referred to alternatively as a '''chieftainess''', a '''chieftess''' or, especially in the case of the former, a '''chief'''.

==History==
[[File:Arminius1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Arminius]], a chieftain of the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] [[Cherusci]] tribe who defeated three [[Roman legions]] in the [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest]].]]
Anthropologist [[Elman Service]] distinguishes two stages of tribal societies: simple societies organized by limited instances of social rank and prestige, and more stratified societies led by chieftains or tribal kings ([[chiefdom]]s). Historically, tribal societies represent an intermediate stage between the [[band society]] of the [[Paleolithic]] stage and [[civilization]] with centralized, super-regional government based in [[Cities of the Ancient Near East|cities]]. Stratified tribal societies led by tribal kings thus flourished from the [[Neolithic]] stage into the [[Iron Age]], albeit in competition with civilisations and [[empire]]s beginning in the [[Bronze Age]]. 
An important source of information for tribal societies of the Iron Age is [[Greco-Roman ethnography]], which describes tribal societies surrounding the urban, imperialist civilisation of the [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] and [[Roman era|Roman]] periods.

After the collapse of the Western Roman Empire, tribal kingdoms were again established over much of Europe in the wake of the [[Migration period]]. By the [[High Middle Ages]], these had again coalesced into super-regional monarchies.

Tribal societies remained prevalent in much of the [[New World]]. Exceptions to tribal societies outside of Europe and Asia were Paleolithic or Mesolithic band societies in [[Oceania]] and in parts of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]. Europeans forced centralized governments onto these societies during [[colonialism]], but in some instances tribes have retained or regained partial self-government.

==Modern states or regions providing an organized form of tribal chiefships==

===Arabia===
Arabs, in particular peninsular [[Tribes of Arabia|Arabs]] and nomadic Bedouins, are largely organized in tribes, many of whom have official representatives in governments. Tribal chiefs are known as [[Sheikh]]s, though this term is also sometimes applied as an honorific title to spiritual leaders of Sufism.
===Bolivia===
The [[Afro-Bolivian community|Afro-Bolivian people]], a recognized ethnic constituency of Bolivia, are led by a 
[[Afro-Bolivian monarchy|king]] whose title is also recognized by the Bolivian government.

===Botswana===
In Botswana, the reigning chiefs of the various tribes are legally empowered to serve as advisers to the government as members of the [[Ntlo ya Dikgosi]], the national [[House of Chiefs]]. In addition to this, they also serve as the ex officio chairs of the tribal ''kgotlas'', meetings of all of the members of the tribes, where political and social matters are discussed.

===Canada===
{{main|band government}}
The band is the fundamental unit of governance among the [[First Nations in Canada]] (formerly called "Indians").  Most bands have elected chiefs, either directly elected by all members of the band, or indirectly by the band council, these chiefs are recognized by the Canadian state under the terms of the [[Indian Act]].  As well, there may be traditional hereditary or charismatic chiefs, who are usually not part of the Indian Act-sanctioned formal government.  There were 614 bands in Canada in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/eng/1100100016202/1100100016204 Frequently Asked Questions About Aboriginal Peoples] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922104948/http://www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/eng/1100100016202/1100100016204 |date=2013-09-22 }}. Aadnc-aandc.gc.ca (2010-09-15). Retrieved on 2013-07-28.&lt;/ref&gt;  There is also a national organization, the [[Assembly of First Nations]], which elects a "national chief" to act as spokesperson of all First Nations bands in Canada.

===Ghana===
The offices and traditional realms of the chiefs of Ghana are constitutionally protected by the republican constitution of the country. The chiefs serve as custodians of all traditional lands and the cultures of the traditional areas. They also serve as members of the Ghanaian [[National House of Chiefs]].

===Nigeria===
Although the [[Nigerian traditional rulers]] aren't mentioned in Nigeria's current constitution, they derive their powers from various so-called ''Chiefs laws'' and are therefore legally recognized. They usually serve as members of each federating state's [[State Council of Traditional Rulers and Chiefs]].

===Oceania===
The [[Solomon Islands]] have a Local Court Act which empowers chiefs to deal with crimes in their communities, thus assuring them of considerable effective authority.

===Philippines===
Apo Rodolfo Aguilar (Kudol I) serves as the chieftain of the [[Tagbanwa people|Tagbanwa]] tribes people living in Banuang Daan and Cabugao settlements in Coron Island, Palawan, Philippines. His position is recognized by the Filipino government.

===South Africa===
Such figures as the [[king of the Zulu Nation]] and the [[Rain Queen]] are politically recognized in South Africa because they derive their status, not only from tribal custom, but also from the Traditional Leadership Clause of the country's current constitution.

===Uganda===
The pre-colonial states that existed in what is today Uganda were summarily abolished following independence from [[Great Britain]]. However, following constitutional reforms in 1993, a number of them were restored as politically neutral constituencies of the state by the government of [[Yoweri Museveni]]. Such figures as the [[Kabaka of Buganda]] and the [[Omukama of Toro]] typify the Ugandan chieftaincy class.

===United States===
{{further|Tribe (Native American)}}

====Historical cultural differences between tribes====
Generally, a tribe or nation is considered to be part of an [[ethnic group]], usually sharing cultural [[Value (personal and cultural)|value]]s. 
For example, the forest-dwelling [[Chippewa]] historically built dwellings from the bark of trees, as opposed to the [[Great Plains]]-dwelling tribes, who would not have access to trees, except by trade, for example for [[lodgepole pine|lodgepole]]s. Thus, the tribes of the Great Plains might typically dwell in skin-covered [[tipi]]s rather than bark lodges. But some Plains tribes built their lodges of earth, as for example the [[Pawnee people|Pawnee]].{{ref|FieldMuseum}} The [[Pueblo people]], meanwhile, built their dwellings of stone and earth.

====Political power in a tribe====
A chief might be considered to hold all political power, say by oratory or by example. But on the North American continent, it was historically possible to evade the political power of another by migration. The [[Mingo]]s, for example, were [[Iroquois]] who migrated further west to the sparsely populated [[Ohio Country]] during the 18th century. Two Haudenosaunee, or Iroquois, [[Hiawatha]] and [[the Great Peacemaker]], formulated a [[Iroquois constitution|constitution]] for the Iroquois Confederation.

The tribes [[Indian Wars|were pacified]] by units of the United States Army in the nineteenth century, and were also subject to forced schooling in the decades afterward. Thus, it is uncommon for today's tribes to have a purely Native American cultural background, and today Native Americans are in many ways simply another ethnicity of the secular American people. Because formal education is now respected, some like [[Peter MacDonald (Navajo leader)|Peter MacDonald]], a Navajo, left their jobs in the mainstream U.S. economy to become chairpeople of their tribal councils or similar self-government institutions.

Not all tribal leaders need be men; [[Wilma Mankiller]] was a well-known Chief of the Cherokee Nation. Also, though the fount of power might be the chief, he or she is typically not free to wield power without the consent of a council of elders of some kind. For example: [[Cherokee]] men were not permitted to go to war without the consent of the council of women.

Tribal government is an official form of government in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://firstgov.gov/Government/State_Local/Tribal_Sites.shtml |title=A-Z Index of Tribal Governments, A &amp;#124; USA.gov |publisher=Firstgov.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; as it is in a number of countries around the world.

Historically, the U.S. government treated tribes as seats of political power, and made treaties with the tribes as legal entities. Be that as it may, the territory of these tribes fell under the authority of the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] as reservations held in trust for the tribes. Citizenship was formerly considered a tribal matter. For example, it was not until 1924 that the [[Pueblo people]] were granted U.S. citizenship, and it was not until 1948 that the Puebloans were granted the right to vote in state elections in New Mexico. In Wisconsin, the [[Menominee Nation]] has its own county [[Menominee County, Wisconsin]] with special car license plates; 87% of the county's population is Native American.

Mainstream Americans often find pride and comfort in realizing that at least part of their ethnic ancestry is Native American, although the connection is usually only sentimental and not economic or cultural. Thus, there is some political power in one's ability to claim a Native American connection (as in the [[Black Seminole]]).

====Economic power in a tribe====
Because the Nations were sovereign, with treaty rights and obligations, the Wisconsin tribes innovated [[Indian gaming]] in 1988,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20051231031253/http://www.jsonline.com/news/state/dec05/381080.asp]&lt;/ref&gt; that is, on-reservation gambling casinos, which have since become a [[United States dollar|US$]]14&amp;nbsp;billion industry nationwide. This has been imitated in many of the respective states that still have Native American tribes. The money that this generates has engendered some political scandal. For example, the [[Tiwa people|Tigua]] tribe, which fled their ancestral lands in New Mexico during the Pueblo revolt of 1680, and who then settled on land in [[El Paso County, Texas]], has paid&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Myers |first=Lisa |url=http://msnbc.msn.com/id/7575874/ |title=4.2 million dollars in political contributions in Texas |publisher=MSNBC |date=2005-04-20 |accessdate=2012-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; for a low probable return to the tribe because of the [[Jack Abramoff]] publicity.

Many of the tribes use professional management for their money. Thus, the [[Mescalero Apache]] renovated their Inn of the Mountain Gods to include gambling as well as the previous tourism, lodging, and skiing in the older Inn.

The Navajo nation defeated bids to open casinos in 1994, but by 2004 the [[Shiprock]] casino was a ''[[fait accompli]]''.
