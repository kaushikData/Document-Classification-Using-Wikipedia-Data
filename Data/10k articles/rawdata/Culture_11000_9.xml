'''''A Beautiful Mind''''' is the original [[soundtrack album]], on the Decca Records label, of the 2001 film ''[[A Beautiful Mind (film)|A Beautiful Mind]]'' starring [[Russell Crowe]], [[Jennifer Connelly]] (who won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her role as "Alicia Nash"), [[Christopher Plummer]] and [[Paul Bettany]]. The original [[Film score|score]] and [[song]]s were composed and conducted by [[James Horner]].

The album garnered nominations for the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score]] and the [[Academy Award for Best Original Score]]. Music critics felt that the musical score fit the film well, but believed it to be similar to several of Horner's previous films.

==Development==
Composer [[James Horner]] was a frequent collaborator with [[Ron Howard]], the director of ''A Beautiful Mind''. Horner desired to feature vocals reminiscent of being midway between a girl and woman,&lt;ref name=NPR&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-51458075.html |title=Analysis: Film scores for "A Beautiful Mind" and "A.I.: Artificial Intelligence" |publisher=[[National Public Radio]] |first=Lynn|last=Neary |date=March 10, 2002 |accessdate=January 12, 2014}} {{Subscription needed}}&lt;/ref&gt; and wrote the score specifically for 15-year-old [[Welsh people|Welsh]] singer [[Charlotte Church]]. In an interview, she stated that it was "one of the most haunting and beautiful [things] I have ever performed."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-79349220.html |title=Charlotte Has an Oscar in Her Beautiful Mind |work=[[The Mail on Sunday]] |first=Katie|last=Nicholl|date=October 21, 2001 |accessdate=January 12, 2014}} {{Subscription needed}}&lt;/ref&gt; To convey "the beauty of mathematics," Horner decided to use the idea of a [[kaleidoscope]], as its "patterns are always changing, and things move very quickly, but in moving so quickly, they create other patterns that move very slowly underneath."&lt;ref name=DailyVariety/&gt; He added that these changing patterns were conveyed with the piano and Church's voice.&lt;ref name=DailyVariety&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-83030727.html |title=Magic lies in the methods: This year's crop of possible contenders use mix of traditional and unusual scoring elements |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Daily Variety]] |first=Jon |last=Burlingame |date=January 23, 2002 |accessdate=January 12, 2014}} {{Subscription needed}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing for ''Empire'' magazine, Danny Graydon gave the soundtrack four out of five stars. He thought the score contained elements of Horner's previous films ''[[Sneakers (1992 film)|Sneakers]]'' (1992) and ''[[Bicentennial Man (film)|Bicentennial Man]]'' (1999), but said "if you can forgive that, this is a clever, masterful and romantic score that captures a brilliant mind in conflict."&lt;ref name=EmpireReview&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?SID=7787 |title=Empire's A Beautiful Mind Soundtrack Review |work=Empire |first=Danny |last=Graydon |accessdate=January 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the tracks "Creating Government Dynamics" and "Cracking The Russian Codes", Graydon opined that Church's "poignant vocals mix well with the frenetic piano and strings to represent Nash’s brilliance," and wished that her voice had been used more in the film.&lt;ref name=EmpireReview/&gt;

Dan Goldwasser of [[Soundtrack.net]] also found similarities to the score in ''Bicentennial Man'', but thought Horner's work fit the film regardless, explaining "it effectively underscores the drama and romance, and even provides a few bits of tension for the action scene."&lt;ref name=Soundtrackreview/&gt; Goldwasser concluded that "while it all works well in the film, there is enough about this score that just seemed to {{sic}} 'familiar' to make it stand out.&lt;ref name=Soundtrackreview/&gt; Contributing to [[National Public Radio]], Andy Trudeau believed Church's particular voice adds a "human element. It's the sound that, I think, gives a sense of--the center of this character, if you will. I think it's the soul. And it's trying to be normal in a way, and underneath it it's trying to be crazy."&lt;ref name=NPR/&gt;

Horner's score garnered nominations for the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-321700.html |title=Harrison Ford To Be Honored At Golden Globes |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=January 20, 2002 |accessdate=January 12, 2014}} {{Subscription needed}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Academy Award for Best Original Score]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4616983.html |title=And the Nominees Are... |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |date=December 21, 2001 |accessdate=January 12, 2014}} {{Subscription needed}}&lt;/ref&gt; It lost the Golden Globe to the film ''[[Moulin Rouge!]]'' and the Oscar to ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]''.

==Definition==
"Art music" is mostly used to refer to music descending from the tradition of Western [[classical music]]. Authors associated with the [[New musicology|critical musicology]] movement and popular music studies, such as [[Philip Tagg]], tend to reject the elitism associated with art music; he refers to it as one of an "axiomatic triangle consisting of 'folk', 'art' and 'popular' musics".&lt;ref name="Analysing Popular Music 1982, p.41"&gt;Philip Tagg, "Analysing Popular Music: Theory, Method and Practice", ''Popular Music'' 2 (1982): 41.&lt;/ref&gt; He explains that each of these three is distinguishable from the others according to certain criteria.&lt;ref name="Analysing Popular Music 1982, p.41"/&gt; According to Bruno Nettl, "Western classical music" may also be synonymous with "art music", "canonic music, "cultivated music". "serious music", as well as the more flippantly used "real music" and "normal music".&lt;ref name="Nettl1995"/&gt; Musician [[Catherine Schmidt-Jones]] defines art music as "a music which requires significantly more work by the listener to fully appreciate than is typical of popular music". In her view, "[t]his can include the more challenging types of jazz and rock music, as well as Classical".&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Schmidt-Jones, "[http://cnx.org/content/m11421/latest/ What Kind of Music Is That?]", from the website Connexions, last edited by Catherine Schmidt-Jones on 10 January 2007 8:58 am US/Central, retrieved on 12 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term may also refer to:

* Some forms of [[jazz]], excluding most forms generally considered popular music.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} Jazz is generally considered popular music.{{Contradiction-inline|date=May 2018}} ([[Theodor W. Adorno|Adorno]] for example refers to jazz as some kind of popular music),&lt;ref&gt;Theodor W.

* Music that is highly formalized, that is, in which all or most musical elements are specified in advance, usually in written notation, as opposed to being improvised or otherwise left up to the performer's discretion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Quinta Rambert|title=Making new: an improvisation R&amp;D|url=http://www.rambert.org.uk/explore/news-and-blog/blog/making-new-an-improvisation-rd/|publisher=Rambert|accessdate=18 March 2017|quote=Western art music is actually quite unusual in its emphasis on notation.}}{{Unreliable source?|date=May 2018|reason=self-published website.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "art music" refers primarily to classical traditions (including contemporary as well as historical classical music forms) that focus on formal styles, invite technical and detailed deconstruction&lt;ref name="Siron p. 242"/&gt; and criticism, and demand focused attention from the listener. In strict western practice, art music is considered primarily a written musical tradition,&lt;ref name="Arnold, Denis 1983 p. 111"/&gt; preserved in some form of [[Musical notation|music notation]], as opposed to being transmitted orally, by rote, or in recordings (like [[popular music|popular]] and [[traditional music]]).&lt;ref name="Arnold, Denis 1983 p. 111"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Philip Tagg, "Analysing Popular Music: Theory, Method and Practice", ''Popular Music'' 2 (1982): 37–67, here 41–42.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular music==

There have been continual attempts throughout the history of popular music to make a claim for itself as art rather than as popular culture, and a number of music styles that were previously understood as "popular music" have since been categorized in the art or classical category.&lt;ref name="Wall2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tim Wall|title=Studying Popular Music Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tEeBAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA42|year=2013|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-1-4462-9101-6|pages=42–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the academic Tim Wall, the most significant example of the struggle between [[Tin Pan Alley]], African-American, vernacular, and art discourses was in jazz. As early as the 1930s, artists attempted to cultivate ideas of "symphonic jazz", taking it away from its perceived vernacular and black American roots. Following these developments, histories of popular music tend to marginalize jazz, partly because the reformulation of jazz in the art discourse has been so successful that many (as of 2013) would not consider it a form of popular music.&lt;ref name="Wall2013"/&gt;

In the second half of the 20th century, there was a large-scale trend in American culture toward blurring the boundaries between art and [[pop music]].&lt;ref name="Edmon"/&gt; Beginning in 1966, the degree of social and artistic dialogue among [[rock music]]ians dramatically accelerated for bands who fused elements of composed music with the oral musical traditions of rock.&lt;ref name="Holm"/&gt; During the late 1960s and 1970s, [[progressive rock|progressive-rock]] bands represented a form of [[crossover music]] that combined rock with high art musical forms either through quotation, allusion, or imitation.&lt;ref name="Edmon"&gt;{{cite book|pp=317, 1233|editor=Jacqueline Edmondson|title=Music in American Life: An Encyclopedia of the Songs, Styles, Stars, and Stories that Shaped our Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TQPXAQAAQBAJ|year=2013|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-39348-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Progressive music]] may be equated with explicit references to aspects of art music, sometimes resulting in the reification of rock as art music.&lt;ref name="Holm"&gt;{{cite book|pp=85–87|editor=Kevin Holm-Hudson|title=Progressive Rock Reconsidered|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JQCPAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA275|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-71022-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While progressive rock is often cited for its merging of [[high culture]] and [[low culture]], few artists incorporated literal classical themes in their work to any great degree, as author Kevin Holm-Hudson explains: "sometimes progressive rock fails to integrate classical sources ... [it] moves continuously between explicit and implicit references to genres and strategies derived not only from European art music, but other cultural domains (such as East Indian, Celtic, folk, and African) and hence involves a continuous aesthetic movement between [[formalism (art)|formalism]] and [[eclecticism]]".&lt;ref name="Holm"/&gt;

'''Artificial muscle''' is a generic term used for actuators, materials or devices that mimic natural [[muscle]] and can reversibly contract, expand, or rotate within one component due to an external stimulus (such as voltage, current, pressure or temperature).&lt;ref name="Mirvakili2013"&gt;{{cite thesis |type=M.A.Sc |first=Seyed M. |last=Mirvakili |title=Niobium Nanowire Yarns and Their Application as Artificial Muscle |publisher=[[University of British Columbia]] |date=2013 | url=http://hdl.handle.net/2429/44257|accessdate=3 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three basic actuation responses – contraction, expansion, and rotation – can be combined together within a single component to produce other types of motions (e.g. bending, by contracting one side of the material while expanding the other side). Conventional motors and [[pneumatic]] linear or rotary actuators do not qualify as artificial muscles, because there is more than one component involved in the actuation.

Due to their high flexibility, versatility and power-to-weight ratio compared with traditional rigid actuators, artificial muscles have the potential to be a highly disruptive [[emerging technology]].

==Comparison with natural muscles==
While there is no general theory that allows for actuators to be compared, there are "power criteria" for artificial muscle technologies that allow for specification of new actuator technologies in comparison with natural muscular properties. In summary, the criteria include [[Stress (mechanics)|stress]], [[Strain (materials science)|strain]], [[strain rate]], cycle life, and [[elastic modulus]]. Some authors have considered other criteria (Huber et al., 1997), such as actuator density and strain resolution.&lt;ref name="Tondu2007"&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Artificial Muscles for Humanoid Robots, Humanoid Robots, Human-like Machines |chapter-url=http://www.intechopen.com/download/pdf/163 |first=Bertrand |last=Tondu |pages=89–122 |title=Humanoid Robots: Human-like Machines |editor-first=Matthias |editor-last=Hackel |publisher=InTech |year=2007 |isbn=978-3-902613-07-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2014, the most powerful artificial muscle fibers in existence can offer a hundredfold increase in power over equivalent lengths of natural muscle fibers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://io9.com/scientists-just-created-some-of-the-most-powerful-muscl-1526957560|title=Scientists just created some of the most powerful muscles in existence|publisher=[[io9]]|date=20 February 2014|accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers measure the speed, [[energy density]], power, and efficiency of artificial muscles; no one type of artificial muscle is the best in all areas.&lt;ref name="Herkewitz"/&gt;

==Types==
Artificial muscles can be divided into three major groups based on their actuation mechanism.&lt;ref name="Mirvakili2013"/&gt;

===Electric field actuation===
{{main|Electroactive polymers}}
Electroactive polymers (EAPs) are polymers that can be actuated through the application of electric fields. Currently, the most prominent EAPs include piezoelectric polymers, dielectric actuators (DEAs), electrostrictive graft [[elastomers]], [[liquid crystal]] elastomers (LCE) and ferroelectric polymers. While these EAPs can be made to bend, their low capacities for torque motion currently limit their usefulness as artificial muscles. Moreover, without an accepted standard material for creating EAP devices, commercialization has remained impractical. However, significant progress has been made in EAP technology since the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cohen|first=Yoseph|title=Electroactive Polymers (EAPs)|url=http://electrochem.cwru.edu/encycl/art-p02-elact-pol.htm|accessdate=1 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ion-based actuation====
Ionic EAPs are polymers that can be actuated through the diffusion of ions in an electrolyte solution (in addition to the application of electric fields). Current examples of ionic electroactive polymers include polyelectrode gels, ionomeric polymer metallic composites (IPMC), conductive polymers and electrorheological fluids (ERF). In 2011, it was demonstrated that twisted [[carbon nanotube]]s could also be actuated by applying an electric field.&lt;ref name="Foroughi2011"&gt;{{cite journal

 | doi = 10.1126/science.1211220
|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electric power actuation===
Twisted and coiled [[polymer]] (TCP) muscles also known as supercoiled polymer (SCP) are coiled polymer that can be actuated by [[electric power]] &lt;ref name="TCP muscle"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jafarzadeh |first1=Mohsen |last2=Gans |first2=Nicholas |last3=Tadesse |first3=Yonas |title=Control of TCP muscles using Takagi–Sugeno–Kang fuzzy inference system |journal=Mechatronics |date=August 2018 |volume=53 |page= |pages=124–139 |doi=10.1016/j.mechatronics.2018.06.007 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957415818300965}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A TCP muscle look like a [[Helix|helical]] [[Spring (device)|spring]]. TCP muscles are usually made from [[silver]] coated [[Nylon]]. TCP muscle can also made from other [[Electrical resistance and conductance|electrical conductance]] coat such as gold. TCP muscles should be under a load to keep the muscle extended. The electrical energy transforms to thermal energy due to electrical resistance, which also known as [[Joule heating]], Ohmic heating, and resistive heating. As the temperature of the TCP muscle increases by Joule heating, the polymer contracts and it causes the muscle contraction. &lt;ref name="TCP muscle"/&gt;.

===Pneumatic actuation===
{{main|Pneumatic artificial muscles}}
Pneumatic artificial muscles (PAMs) operate by filling a pneumatic bladder with pressurized air. Upon applying gas pressure to the bladder, isotropic volume expansion occurs, but is confined by braided wires that encircle the bladder, translating the volume expansion to a linear contraction along the axis of the actuator. PAMs can be classified by their operation and design; namely, PAMs feature pneumatic or hydraulic operation, overpressure or underpressure operation, braided/netted or embedded membranes and stretching membranes or rearranging membranes. Among the most commonly used PAMs today is a cylindrically braided muscle known as the McKibben Muscle, which was first developed by J. L. McKibben in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brl.ee.washington.edu/BRL_Pubs/Pdfs/Th024.pdf|title=Artificial Muscles: Actuators for Biorobotic Systems|date=1999|publisher=University of Washington|format=PDF|accessdate=21 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thermal actuation===

====Fishing line====
Artificial muscles constructed from ordinary [[fishing line]] and sewing thread can lift 100 times more weight and generate 100 times more power than a human muscle of the same length and weight.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Artificial muscles based on fishing line already cost orders of magnitude less (per pound) than shape-memory alloy or carbon nanotube yarn; but currently have relatively poor efficiency.&lt;ref name="Herkewitz"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Individual [[macromolecule]]s are aligned with the fiber in commercially available [[polymer]] fibers. By winding them into coils, researchers make artificial muscles that contract at speeds similar to human muscles.&lt;ref name="cooper"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

A (untwisted) polymer fiber, such as polyethelene fishing line or nylon sewing thread, unlike most materials, shortens when heated—up to about 4% for a 250 K increase in temperature. By twisting the fiber and winding the twisted fiber into a coil,
heating causes the coil to tighten up and shorten by up to 49%. Researchers found another way to wind the coil such that heating causes the coil to lengthen by 69%.&lt;ref&gt;

One application of thermally-activated artificial muscles is to automatically open and close windows, responding to temperature without using any power.&lt;ref name="cooper" /&gt;

Tiny artificial muscles composed of twisted [[carbon nanotube]]s filled with [[paraffin wax|paraffin]] are 200 times stronger than human muscle.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

====Shape-memory alloys====
{{main|Shape-memory alloy}}
Shape-memory alloys (SMAs), liquid crystalline elastomers, and metallic alloys that can be deformed and then returned to their original shape when exposed to heat, can function as artificial muscles. Thermal actuator-based artificial muscles offer heat resistance, impact resistance, low density, high fatigue strength, and large force generation during shape changes. In 2012, a new class of electric field-activated, [[electrolyte]]-free artificial muscles called "twisted yarn actuators" were demonstrated, based on the thermal expansion of a secondary material within the muscle's conductive twisted structure.&lt;ref name="Mirvakili2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lima2012"&gt;{{cite journal

==Control systems==
{{main|Control theory}}
The three types of artificial muscles have different constraints that affect the type of control system they require for actuation. It is important to note, however, that control systems are often designed to meet the specifications of a given experiment, with some experiments calling for the combined use of a variety of different actuators or a hybrid control schema. As such, the following examples should not be treated as an exhaustive list of the variety of control systems that may be employed to actuate a given artificial muscle.

===Voltage control===
The twisted and coiled polymer (TCP) muscles can be modeled by [[first-order]] [[Linear time-invariant theory|linear time-invariant]] [[State-space representation|state spaces]] when input is electrical voltage, with accuracy more than 85%. Therefore, A TCP muscles can be easily controlled by a digital [[PID controller]]&lt;ref name="TCP muscle"/&gt;. A fuzzy controller can be used to speed up the PID controller &lt;ref name="TCP muscle"/&gt;.

===EAP control===
EAPs offer lower weight, faster response, higher power density and quieter operation when compared to traditional actuators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mavroidis|first=Constantinos|title=Nonlinear Force Control of Dielectric Electroactive Polymer Actuators|url=http://www.coe.neu.edu/Research/robots/papers/SPIE2010_2.pdf|accessdate=4 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both electric and ionic EAPs are primarily actuated using feedback control loops, better known as closed-loop control systems.&lt;ref&gt;Baohua Qi ; Wen Lu and Benjamin R. Mattes
"Control system for conducting polymer actuators", Proc. SPIE 4695, Smart Structures and Materials 2002: Electroactive Polymer Actuators and Devices (EAPAD), 359 (10 July 2002). {{DOI|10.1117/12.475183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pneumatic control===
Currently there are two types of pneumatic artificial muscles (PAMs). The first type has a single bladder surrounded by a braided sleeve and the second type has a double bladder.

====Single bladder surrounded by a braided sleeve====
Pneumatic artificial muscles, while lightweight and inexpensive, pose a particularly difficult control problem as they are both highly nonlinear and have properties, such as temperature, that fluctuate significantly over time. PAMs generally consist of rubber and plastic components. As these parts come into contact with each other during actuation, the PAM's temperature increases, ultimately leading to permanent changes in the structure of the artificial muscle over time. This problem has led to a variety of experimental approaches. In summary (provided by Ahn et al.), viable experimental control systems include PID control, adaptive control (Lilly, 2003), nonlinear optimal predictive control (Reynolds et al., 2003), variable structure control (Repperger et al., 1998; Medrano-Cerda et al.,1995), gain scheduling (Repperger et al.,1999), and various soft computing approaches including neural network Kohonen training algorithm control (Hesselroth et al.,1994), neural network/nonlinear PID control (Ahn and Thanh, 2005), and neuro-fuzzy/genetic control (Chan et al., 2003; Lilly et al., 2003).

Control problems regarding highly nonlinear systems have generally been addressed through a trial-and-error approach through which "fuzzy models" (Chan et al., 2003) of the system's behavioral capacities could be teased out (from the experimental results of the specific system being tested) by a knowledgeable human expert. However, some research has employed "real data" (Nelles O., 2000) to train up the accuracy of a given fuzzy model while simultaneously avoiding the mathematical complexities of previous models. Ahn et al.'s experiment is simply one example of recent experiments that use modified genetic algorithms (MGAs) to train up fuzzy models using experimental input-output data from a PAM robot arm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ahn|first=Kyoung|title=Hybrid Control of a Pneumatic Artificial Muscle (PAM) Robot Arm Using an Inverse NARX Fuzzy Model|url=http://www4.hcmut.edu.vn/~hphanh/paper8.pdf|accessdate=4 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Double bladder====
This actuator consists of an external membrane with an internal flexible membrane dividing the interior of the muscle into two portions. A tendon is secured to the membrane, and exits the muscle through a sleeve so that the tendon can contract into the muscle. A tube allows air into the internal bladder, which then rolls out into the external bladder. A key advantage of this type of pneumatic muscle is that there is no potentially frictive movement of the bladder against an outer sleeve.

===Thermal control===
SMA artificial muscles, while lightweight and useful in applications that require large force and displacement, also present specific control challenges; namely, SMA artificial muscles are limited by their hysteretic input-output relationships and bandwidth limitations. As Wen et al. discuss, the SMA phase transformation phenomenon is "hysteretic" in that the resulting output SMA strand is dependent on the history of its heat input. As for bandwidth limitations, the dynamic response of an SMA actuator during hysteretic phase transformations is very slow due to the amount of time required for the heat to transfer to the SMA artificial muscle. Very little research has been conducted regarding SMA control due to assumptions that regard SMA applications as static devices; nevertheless, a variety of control approaches have been tested to address the control problem of hysteretic nonlinearity.

Generally, this problem has required the application of either open-loop compensation or closed-loop feedback control. Regarding [[open-loop control]], the [[Preisach model]] has often been used for its simple structure and ability for easy simulation and control (Hughes and Wen, 1995). As for [[closed-loop control]], a passivity-based approach analyzing SMA closed loop stability has been used (Madill and Wen, 1994). Wen et al.'s study provides another example of closed-loop feedback control, demonstrating the stability of closed-loop control in SMA applications through applying a combination of force feedback control and position control on a flexible aluminum beam actuated by an SMA made from [[Nitinol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wen|first=John|title=Feedback Control Using Shape Memory Alloy Actuators|url=http://cats-fs.rpi.edu/~wenj/papers/sma_98.pdf|accessdate=3 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
Artificial muscle technologies have wide potential applications in [[biomimetic]] machines, including robots, industrial actuators and [[powered exoskeleton]]s. EAP-based artificial muscles offer a combination of light weight, low power requirements, resilience and agility for locomotion and manipulation.&lt;ref name=MuscleApps&gt;{{cite book|url=http://ebooks.spiedigitallibrary.org/mobile/content.aspx?bookid=146&amp;sectionid=31570721|title=Electroactive Polymer (EAP) Actuators as Artificial Muscles: Reality, Potential, and Challenges (Second Edition)|chapter=EAP Applications, Potential, and Challenges|editor=Bar-Cohen, Yoseph|date=2004|publisher=SPIE Digital Library|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Future EAP devices will have applications in aerospace, automotive industry, medicine, robotics, articulation mechanisms, entertainment, animation, toys, clothing, haptic and tactile interfaces, noise control, transducers, power generators, and smart structures.&lt;ref name=Apps2&gt;{{cite web|last=Cohen|first=Yoseph|title=Electroactive Polymers (EAP's)|url=http://electrochem.cwru.edu/encycl/art-p02-elact-pol.htm|publisher=Caltech|accessdate=1 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pneumatic artificial muscles also offer greater flexibility, controllability and lightness compared to conventional pneumatic cylinders.&lt;ref name="PAM-Daerden-Lefeber"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lucy.vub.ac.be/publications/Daerden_Lefeber_EJMEE.pdf|title=Pneumatic Artificial Muscles: actuators for robotics and automation|format=PDF|author=Frank Daerden|author2=Dirk Lefeber|publisher=[[Vrije Universiteit Brussel]], Department of Mechanical Engineering|date=2002|accessdate=24 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most PAM applications involve the utilization of McKibben-like muscles.&lt;ref name="PAM-Daerden-Lefeber"/&gt; Thermal actuators such as SMAs have various military, medical, safety, and robotic applications, and could furthermore be used to generate energy through mechanical shape changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lin|first=Richard|title=Shape Memory Alloys|url=http://www.stanford.edu/~richlin1/sma/sma.html|accessdate=3 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In books ==
===Novels===
The fictional novel ''Gideon's March'' by [[J. J. Marric]], was published in 1962 by [[Hodder and Stoughton]] in London, the year ''before'' the Kennedy assassination. Inspector George Gideon learns of a plot to assassinate President Kennedy during a state visit to London. The assassination is to take place during a parade, by means of a bomb; the assassin, called O'Hara, is a Southern bigot who hates the President for his Roman Catholic faith and his civil-rights initiatives.

[[J. G. Ballard]] wrote a 1967 short-short story titled "[[The Day of Forever|The assassination of John Fitzgerald Kennedy considered as a downhill motor race]]."

''[[The Illuminatus! Trilogy]]'' first published in 1975 by [[Robert Shea]] and [[Robert Anton Wilson]] depicts the assassination scene, with several would-be assassins trying to kill Kennedy simultaneously.

''Sherlock Holmes in Dallas'' (Dodd, Mead 1980) by Edmund Aubrey, brings the renowned consulting detective out of his Sussex retirement to investigate the Kennedy assassination.

[[Don DeLillo]]'s 1988 novel ''[[Libra (novel)|Libra]]'' is a fictional imagining of the assassination, with Lee Harvey Oswald as the protagonist.

[[James Ellroy]]'s [[Underworld USA Trilogy]], particularly the 1995 novel ''[[American Tabloid]]'', constructs a fictional narrative involving several characters who have part in the Kennedy assassination.

In [[William Harrington (Author)|William Harrington]]'s 1994 novel ''Columbo: The Grassy Knoll'' Lieutenant [[Columbo]] solves the Kennedy Assassination after a talk-show host is murdered before an exposé.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Grassy Knoll (Columbo)|url=https://www.amazon.com/Grassy-Knoll-Columbo-William-Harrington/dp/0812530241|website=Amazon|accessdate=July 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Grassy Knoll|url=http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1706599.The_Grassy_Knoll|website=Goodreads|accessdate=July 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1996 ''Doctor Who'' spin-off novel ''[[Who Killed Kennedy]]'' features the Doctor's enemy the [[Master (Doctor Who)|Master]] attempting to kill Oswald before the assassination as Kennedy's survival would trigger a chain reaction in history that could wipe the Doctor from existence, requiring journalist James Stevens to go back in time and kill Kennedy himself (acting as both gunmen at different points in his life, as Oswald's rifle had a misaligned targeting scope that prevented him delivering the fatal shot from the Book Depository on the first trip).

District Attorney [[Jim Garrison]]'s fictional novel, ''The Star Spangled Contract'' (1976), and [[Taylor Caldwell]]'s ''[[Captains and the Kings]]'' are both based in part on a conspiratorial view of the Kennedy assassination.

=== Comic books ===

In the first album of [[Jean van Hamme]] and [[William Vance]]'s comic book series ''[[XIII (comics)|XIII]]'' the title character XIII is shown to be the alleged assassin of U.S. President William B. Sheridan, who was murdered in his car during an official presidential visit to a city. The events are clearly based on JFK's assassination. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.lambiek.net/artists/v/vance.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] universe, Kennedy's true assassin is the [[Red Skull]], the son of [[Ultimate Captain America|Captain America]]. [[Ultimate Nick Fury|Nick Fury]] muses that the assassination of Kennedy was the Skull's way of showing that he would no longer take orders from America.

In the 2008-2009 series ''[[The Umbrella Academy: Dallas]]'' by [[Gerard Way]] and [[Gabriel Bá]], the Kennedy assassination is a central plot element. The series initially takes place in a timeline where the assassination never happened, until an organisation of time-travelling assassins go back to 1963 to kill Kennedy. When the Umbrella Academy intercept the gunmen, The Rumour, disguised as [[Jacqueline Kennedy]], uses her powers to make Kennedy's head explode.

== In movies, television, and stage ==

The 1966 [[Emile de Antonio]] documentary ''[[Rush to Judgment]]'', based on [[Mark Lane (author)|Mark Lane]]'s book, shows Lane interviewing witnesses who claim the shots came from the [[grassy knoll]] instead of the [[Texas School Book Depository]].

[[Andy Warhol]]'s 1966 film ''[[Since (film)|Since]]'' recreated the assassination from multiple perspectives with participants from [[The Factory]].&lt;ref name="Murphy2012"/&gt; ''Since'' is heavily improvised and explores the media portrayal of the assassination.&lt;ref name="Murphy2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=J.J.

The 1967 satirical play ''[[MacBird!]]'' by Barbara Garson superimposes the events of the assassination on the general plot structure of Shakespeare's ''[[Macbeth]],'' with Kennedy becoming murdered king "Ken O'Dunc" and Lyndon Johnson the treacherous title character. The mockery of the play's name is derived from Johnson's propensity to refer to his wife Claudia as "Lady Bird" and his elder daughter as "Lynda Bird." Garson insisted that her play was a satire and not intended to suggest seriously that Johnson had had a hand in the assassination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/04/AR2006090400993.html | work=The Washington Post | first=Jane | last=Horwitz | title=She Hopes 'MacBird' Flies in a New Era | date=September 5, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tonino Valerii]]'s 1969 [[Spaghetti Western]] film ''[[The Price of Power]]'', starring [[Giuliano Gemma]] and [[Van Johnson]], was the first filmed drama to present a critical perspective on the Kennedy assassination; although it dramatises the [[assassination of James A. Garfield]], it reflects the events and [[John F. Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories|conspiracy theories]] surrounding Kennedy's death.&lt;ref name=Cox&gt;{{cite book|last=[[Alex Cox|Cox, Alex]]|title=10,000 Ways to Die: A Director's Take on the Spaghetti Western|publisher=Oldcastle Books |date=2009|isbn=978-1842433041}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Miller (director)|David Miller]]'s 1973 film ''[[Executive Action (film)|Executive Action]]'' is the first conspiracy theory-based [[Hollywood]]-made dramatization of the Kennedy assassination.&lt;ref name=Cox /&gt;

In 1975, a [[San Francisco]]-based group of artists called [[Ant Farm (group)|Ant Farm]] reenacted the Kennedy assassination in Dealey Plaza, and documented it in a video called ''[[The Eternal Frame]]''.

The 1978 made-for-television movie, ''[[Ruby and Oswald]]'', generally followed the official record as presented by the [[Warren Commission]] of the actions of [[Lee Harvey Oswald]] and [[Jack Ruby]] on the weekend of the assassination.

French director [[Henri Verneuil]]'s 1979 movie ''[[I as in Icarus]]'' (the story is based in a fictional country with fictional characters but the events are clearly linked with the assassination of John F. Kennedy, including amateur footage similar to the [[Zapruder film]])

The 1983 [[NBC]] TV mini series ''[[Kennedy (TV miniseries)|Kennedy]]'', which focuses on the Kennedy Presidency, showed the assassination in graphic detail.

In the 1984 movie ''[[Flashpoint (1984 film)|Flashpoint]]'', a [[United States Border Patrol]] agent finds a car containing the body of a man he believed participated in a conspiracy to kill President Kennedy and was murdered and robbed of the money he received for doing so.

The 1985 ''[[The Twilight Zone (1985 TV series)|Twilight Zone]]'' episode "Profile in Silver" depicts a time traveler who is a descendant of Kennedy attend and meddle in the timeline continuum by accident.

[[Nigel Turner]]'s 1988, 1991, 1995 and 2003 continuing documentary ''[[The Men Who Killed Kennedy]]'' explores [[John F. Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories|conspiracy theories]] of the assassination.

[[Oliver Stone]]'s 1991 dramatic film ''[[JFK (film)|JFK]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Cullather has discussed "The Movie Version" of John F. Kennedy's assassination in Nicholas Cullather, "History, Conspiracy, and the Kennedy Assassination," ''Retrieving the American Past'', ed. Marc Horger (New York: Pearson Custom Publishing, 2005), 301-330.&lt;/ref&gt; based in part upon the book ''[[On the Trail of the Assassins]]'' by former [[New Orleans|Orleans Parish]] ([[Louisiana]]) District Attorney [[Jim Garrison]], who unsuccessfully prosecuted [[Clay Shaw]] for conspiracy relating to the assassination in 1969.

The 1991 TV mini-series ''[[A Woman Named Jackie]]'' showed the assassination from Jackie Kennedy's perspective.

The 1992 drama film ''[[Love Field (film)|Love Field]]'' features [[Michelle Pfeiffer]] as Lurene Hallett, a Dallas hairdresser, attempting to travel to Washington to attend [[State funeral of John F. Kennedy|John F. Kennedy's funeral]]. Though the movie encompasses other issues besides the assassination, it portrays one facet of the public reaction to the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E0CE4DD1431F932A25751C1A964958260&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=love%20field%20review&amp;st=cse | work=The New York Times | first=Janet | last=Maslin | title=Review/Film; Michelle Pfeiffer in a Tale of a 1960's Interracial Friendship | date=December 11, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1992 film ''[[Ruby (1992 film)|Ruby]]'' is an exploration of certain conspiracy theories surrounding the JFK assassination from [[Jack Ruby]]'s perspective.

[[The Boyfriend (Seinfeld)]]: This 1992 episode of the series featured a [[pastiche]] of the assassination featuring the "[[single bullet theory]]" made famous in [[JFK (film)|JFK]] and an essential part of the assassination.  In the episode [[Cosmo Kramer|Kramer]] and [[Newman (Seinfeld)|Newman]] accuse former [[New York Mets|Mets]] player [[Keith Hernandez]] of spitting on them following a 1988 loss at home.

The 1993 thriller film ''[[In the Line of Fire]]'', starring [[Clint Eastwood]], hinges around the JFK assassination. Set in present-day 1993, the film is about a psychopath who plans to assassinate the current President of the United States. Eastwood's character is Secret Service agent Frank Horrigan, the last remaining active agent who was on duty in November 1963, guarding Kennedy in Dallas. Horrigan is consumed with guilt over his failure to react quickly enough to the first shot in Dallas, and becomes obsessed with defeating a young man who has resolved to become a new assassin on the same level as Lee Harvey Oswald or [[John Wilkes Booth]].

The 1993 TV movie ''[[Fatal Deception: Mrs. Lee Harvey Oswald]]'' is a biopic about [[Marina Oswald Porter]], the widow of Lee Harvey Oswald.

The ''[[X-Files]]'' episode "[[Musings of a Cigarette Smoking Man]]" (1996) places a young [[Cigarette Smoking Man|cigarette smoking man]] as the assassin, shooting from a sewer drain located near the grassy knoll after setting up Oswald as his patsy. He also assassinates [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] while framing [[James Earl Ray]] in the episode.

The 1997 comedic short film ''[[My Dinner With Oswald]]'', directed by [[Paul Duane]] and written by [[Donald Clarke (screenwriter)|Donald Clarke]], focuses on a re-creation of the assassination at a [[Dublin]] dinner party.

The 1997 dark-comedy dramatic film ''[[The House of Yes]]'' stars [[Parker Posey]] and [[Josh Hamilton (actor)|Josh Hamilton]] as twins Jacqueline, nicknamed "Jackie-O", and Marty.  She has the same old mental health issues and he brings home a new fiancée for Thanksgiving.  Mayhem ensues including adding incest to their favorite childhood "game" of obsessively re-enacting the [[John F. Kennedy assassination]].

In ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode [[Mayored to the Mob]], the character Leavelle who trains Homer Simpson at "Leavelle's Bodyguard Academy," is based on Texan detective [[Jim Leavelle]], as he appeared when escorting [[Lee Harvey Oswald]] when Oswald was shot by [[Jack Ruby]].&lt;ref name=Hauge&gt;{{cite video |people=Hauge, Ron |date=2007 |title=The Simpsons The Complete Tenth Season DVD commentary for the episode "Mayored to the Mob" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leavelle trains the bodyguards by pretending to shoot their protectee from a grassy knoll on a cart. This is a reference to the [[Dealey Plaza#Grassy knoll|grassy knoll]] at the site of President [[John F. Kennedy]]’s [[John F. Kennedy assassination|assassination]], [[Dealey Plaza]] and a scene from the Kennedy assassination film ''[[Executive Action (film)|Executive Action]]'' (1973).&lt;ref name="Hauge"/&gt; In the episode "[[Diatribe of a Mad Housewife]]", Homer and Marge Simpson decide to make their own novel: "Who Really Killed JFK", with Homer's theory being that Lee Harvey Oswald wanted to steal "the Jack Ruby", but then refutes his own idea when Marge tells him that Jack Ruby was a man, not a jewel.

The 2002 comedy horror film ''[[Bubba Ho-tep]]'' (based on the [[Bubba Ho-Tep (novella)|1994 novella of the same name]]) features [[Ossie Davis]] playing an assassination-obsessed character with a scale model of Dealey Plaza, and photos of the various players on his wall who claims he is Kennedy. He also claimed that after he recovered from the assassination attempt, his skin was dyed black and was abandoned by [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] in a nursing home.

The 2002 [[mockumentary]] film ''[[Interview With the Assassin]]'' presents the assassination and resultant conspiracy theories with a terminally ill former [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] named Walter Ohlinger who claims that he was the second gunman behind the fence on the grassy knoll and was paid by unidentified government agents for doing so, who are now attempting to silence him for exposing the truth. His ex-wife then tells the interviewer he was also mentally ill and was nowhere near Dallas on the day of the assassination.

Kennedy's assassination is briefly referenced, in the 2007 Disney film ''[[National Treasure: Book of Secrets]]''. The title refers to a book supposedly written and maintained by every American President, containing hidden knowledge from U.S. history. Upon being found, a brief section of the book contains photos and handwritten notes, hinting at a government conspiracy.

The 2007 film ''[[Shooter (2007 film)|Shooter]],'' features [[Levon Helm]]'s character Mr. Rate talking to [[Mark Wahlberg]] and [[Michael Peña|Michael Pena]] about conspiracies and says "Them boys on the grassy knoll, they were dead within three hours. Buried in the damn desert. Unmarked graves out past Terlingua.", referencing the Kennedy assassination.  When asked how he knows this, he replies, "Still got the shovel!"

[[Zack Snyder]]'s 2009 movie ''[[Watchmen (film)|Watchmen]]'', based on the 1986–87 [[DC Comics]] limited [[Watchmen|series of the same name]] by [[Alan Moore]] and [[Dave Gibbons]], during the opening credits sequence portrays [[List of Watchmen characters#The Comedian|The Comedian]], one of the members of the Watchmen, as Kennedy's assassin; he's shown firing the fatal headshot from the grassy knoll behind [[Abraham Zapruder]].

The 2009 ''[[Mad Men]]'' episode "The Grownups" focused on the characters' reaction to JFK’s assassination and the subsequent events in their personal lives.

The 2010 ''[[Bones (TV series)|Bones]]'' episode "The Proof in the Pudding" has the characters being forced by the Secret Service to identify cause of death on a highly classified skeleton they later identify as JFK. They determine that JFK was shot twice in the head from two different angles suggesting a second shooter. This causes Booth to question his trust in the government until Bones performs another test that determines this skeleton suffered from a bone disorder JFK didn't suffer from, meaning this wasn't JFK. After the skeleton was returned Bones admits in private that JFK had Scarlet Fever as a child and that could have created a false-positive on her test but they were all better off not knowing for certain if that really was JFK.

The 2013 docudrama ''[[Parkland (film)|Parkland]]'' follows the actions of several people closely related to the assassination from November 22–25, 1963, including the [[SS-100-X|Presidential limousine]], the staff of [[Parkland Memorial Hospital]]'s trauma room, the Secret Service and FBI agents, [[Abraham Zapruder]], and [[Lee Harvey Oswald]]'s family.

The 2013 TV movie ''[[Killing Kennedy (film)|Killing Kennedy]]'', an adaptation of the [[Bill O'Reilly (political commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]] and [[Martin Dugard (author)|Martin Dugard]] book ''[[Killing Kennedy|Killing Kennedy: The End of Camelot]]'', dramatizes the presidency and assassination of Kennedy, as well as the life of Lee Harvey Oswald in the years leading up to the assassination.

The 2014 movie ''[[X-Men: Days of Future Past]]'' featured some scenes set in 1973 which reveal that [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] has been in prison beneath the Pentagon since 1963 for his apparent role in the Kennedy assassination. Magneto maintains his innocence by claiming he was trying to save Kennedy's life because he claims that Kennedy was one of them (mutants) but his efforts were interrupted by the police who arrested him. Xavier held his assassination against Magneto for a while due to a similar incident involving the loss of his legs back in [[X-Men: First Class]] and even claimed to Logan that Erik always had a way with guns.

The 2016 film ''[[Jackie (2016 film)|Jackie]]'' follows the aftermath of the assassination from [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis|Jaqueline Kennedy's]] (played by [[Natalie Portman]]) perspective.

"The Suspicious Assassination of JFK", released September 29, 2017, was episode 10 of season 2 of [[BuzzFeed]] web series, ''[[BuzzFeed Unsolved]]: True Crime'' in which the various theories surrounding the assassination were discussed.

== In music ==

The 1968 [[Rolling Stones]] song "[[Sympathy for the Devil]]" references both John and brother Robert's assassinations with the lyric, "I shouted out / Who killed the Kennedys? / When after all / It was you and me."

The 1978 [[Misfits (band)|Misfits]] single "[[Bullet (Misfits song)|Bullet]]" describes the events around the assassination, stating that "Texas is the reason" for his death in lyrics directed towards [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis|Jacqueline Kennedy]], in addition to sexual demands.

The English rock duo [[Godley &amp; Creme]] song "Lonnie" is the 7th track on the 1980 album ''[[Ismism]]'' featuring lyrics about a man named Lonnie Garamond who kills Kennedy with a camera gun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lonnie Lyrics|url=http://www.metrolyrics.com/lonnie-lyrics-godley-and-creme.html|website=MetroLyrics|publisher=EMI|accessdate=July 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Human League]] song "[[Dare (album)#.22Seconds.22|"Seconds"]]" from their 1981 album ''[[Dare (album)|Dare]]'' deals directly with the Kennedy assassination and is directed at Lee Harvey Oswald.&lt;ref name="Pemberton"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/pictures/16-inspiring-songs-that-honor-jfk-20131119/the-human-league-seconds-0767340 |title=16 Inspiring Songs That Honor JFK: The Human League, 'Seconds' |last=Pemberton |first=Pat |date=November 19, 2013 |website=rollingstone.com |publisher=Rolling Stone |accessdate=December 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; When playing live, the group regularly projected slides onto the background of the stage, and would play this song in front of images of Kennedy and the assassination in Dallas.&lt;ref name="Pemberton"/&gt;

[[Paul Simon|Paul Simon's]] 1983 song "[[The Late Great Johnny Ace]]" references Kennedy's assassination among other famous deaths.

The [[Was (Not Was)]] songs "11 Miles An Hour" and "11 MPH (Abe Zapp Ruder Version)" on respective International and US-Japan releases of their 1988 album ''[[What Up, Dog?]]'' is about the JFK assassination and the speed the car was going, as well as referencing [[Abraham Zapruder]] and the [[Zapruder film]] of the event.

The 1990 Broadway musical ''[[Assassins (musical)|Assassins]]'', written by [[Stephen Sondheim]] and John Weidman, climaxes as the ghosts of [[John Wilkes Booth]], [[Leon Czolgosz]], [[Charles J. Guiteau|Charles Guiteau]], and other "would be" assassins including [[John Hinckley]], appear before a suicidally depressed Lee Harvey Oswald, and convince him that the only way for him to truly connect with his country is to share his pain and disillusionment with it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/07/19/specials/sondheim-assassins.html?module=Search&amp;mabReward=relbias%3Ar |title=Theater: Sondheim's 'Assassins': Insane Realities of History | work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The music video for "[[The Ballad of Peter Pumpkinhead]]" by [[Alternative Rock]] group [[XTC]] on their 1992 album ''[[Nonsuch (album)|Nonsuch]]'' reenacts some events of the day of Kennedy's assassination drawing parallels with the death of [[Jesus Christ]].

The 1998 [[Steve Gillette]] song "Two Men in the Building" on his album ''Texas &amp; Tennessee'' is mostly about the assassination, in fact presenting Steve's own theory about it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://compassrosemusic.com/TwoMenintheBuildingLyrics.asp|title=Two Men in the Building|accessdate=November 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steve is a well-known songwriter, best known as the co-writer of the song ''[[Darcy Farrow]]''.

The 1999 music video "[[Coma White]]" on the 1998 album ''[[Mechanical Animals]]'' by American gothic rock band [[Marilyn Manson]] shows a darker bloodless representation of the [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy]], including his then-fiancée [[Rose McGowan]] as [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis|Jacqueline Kennedy]]. Furthermore, their 2000 album ''[[Holy Wood (In the Shadow of the Valley of Death)]]'' by Marilyn Manson contains numerous references to the Kennedy assassination.

The 2012 music video "[[National Anthem (Lana Del Rey song)|National Anthem]]" by singer-songwriter [[Lana Del Rey]] depicts her as [[Marilyn Monroe]] and [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis|Jacqueline Kennedy]] and shows re-enactments of home videos with [[ASAP Rocky]] as [[John F. Kennedy]] and re-enacting the assassination of the president.

== Alternate history ==
The assassination has been the subject of many [[time travel]] and [[alternate history]] stories in [[science fiction]] film, television and literature, many with Kennedy and/or Oswald surviving or other people in the Presidential limousine dead. Some of these have Governor [[John Connally]] killed in place of Kennedy.

A pair of alternate history films called ''The Trial of Lee Harvey Oswald'' made in 1964 and 1977 have the accused assassin not being killed by [[Jack Ruby]] and standing trial for the murder of President Kennedy. Neither film ends in a verdict: the [[The Trial of Lee Harvey Oswald (1964 film)|earlier movie]] ends after jury instructions, imploring viewers to debate among themselves; while the [[The Trial of Lee Harvey Oswald (1977 film)|latter one]] has him being shot to death while being escorted from his jail cell to the courtroom just after the jury came back from deliberating.

In the 1980 novel ''[[Timescape]]'' by [[Gregory Benford]], Kennedy's assassination was averted by a high school student who interrupted Lee Harvey Oswald at the [[Texas School Book Depository]], attacking the shooter and sending the would-be fatal third shot awry. Although seriously injured, Kennedy survived. This interference created an [[Alternate history|alternate timeline]] in which [[William Scranton]] was the US President in 1974, having defeated [[Robert F. Kennedy]] due to a [[telephone tapping]] scandal.

The 1990 TV movie, ''Running Against Time'', depicts a contemporary schoolteacher ([[Robert Hays]]) who continues to lament the 1966 death of his brother in Vietnam. He's given the chance to go back in time and seeks to prevent the November 1963 assassination, based on the belief that it would prevent [[Lyndon Johnson]] from beginning an escalation of the conflict. However, his attempt results in him being accused of the crime and the subject of a nationwide manhunt. The film is based on the 1986 Stanley Shapiro book.

"Lee Harvey Oswald", the 1992 season opener for the TV series ''[[Quantum Leap (TV series)|Quantum Leap]]'', finds [[Sam Beckett]] leaping into [[Lee Harvey Oswald|Oswald]]'s body. At a critical moment, Al Calavicci prompts him to leap into Secret Service Agent [[Clint Hill (Secret Service)|Clint Hill]]. Hill attempts to reach the President's car before the shots are fired, but he fails to prevent Kennedy's death. Calavicci later reveals that he and Beckett have saved one life – that of Jackie Kennedy, whom Oswald had killed along with the President in the original timeline. This episode was written by series creator [[Donald P. Bellisario]], in response to the Oliver Stone film ''JFK''. Bellisario (who served with Oswald in the [[Marine Corps]]) doesn't believe in a conspiracy; he used supporting evidence from the Warren Commission Report, and had Calavicci speculate that people find it comfortable to believe in a conspiracy, reasoning that if any one person can kill the President of the United States then nobody is safe.

The 1997 episode "[[Tikka to Ride]]" of the ''[[Red Dwarf]]'' comedy TV series, the characters accidentally knock Lee Harvey Oswald out of the fifth-floor window of the Book Depository when they travel back in time to 1963 by mistake, creating an alternate timeline where Kennedy is impeached in 1965 for sharing a mistress with a mafia boss. As a result, [[J. Edgar Hoover]] is blackmailed into running for President by the mob and allows Russia to establish nuclear missiles in Cuba, Kennedy's impeachment traumatising the nation and allowing the USSR to win the space race while the southern states flee due to the fear of missiles from Cuba. Fearing the repercussions of this timeline, but unwilling to kill Kennedy themselves - and with their attempt to redirect Oswald up to the sixth floor before their past selves arrive failing because his trajectory is now too steep for him to do more than wound Kennedy - the characters convince the alternate John F. Kennedy to go back in time and shoot his past self from the grassy knoll, arguing that this action will restore his historical position as a liberal icon ("[[Timeslides]]", an earlier episode of ''Red Dwarf'', also jokingly mentions the possibility of preventing the assassination).

In the 2002 film ''[[Timequest (film)|Timequest]]'', a time-traveler prevents Kennedy's assassination and history takes an alternate course, including the birth of a second son, James Kennedy, who was conceived on the night of November 22, 1963, when Kennedy and his wife return from Dallas. It also has [[Robert F. Kennedy]] becoming President in the late 1970s, with [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] as his Vice President, after both men were saved from their assassinations in 1968 by the same time traveler.

In [[Stephen Baxter (author)|Stephen Baxter]]'s novel ''[[Voyage (novel)|Voyage]]'' (1996), the Dallas assassination attempt only succeeds in crippling Kennedy, but Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy is killed. Kennedy is re-elected in 1964 and commits the United States to landing a manned vessel on [[Mars]], which occurs in 1986. The novel uses the assassination attempt only as the impetus for an alternate history US [[space program]].

[[Jeff Golden]]'s 2008 novel ''Unafraid: A Novel of the Possible'' speculates on what would have happened had the assassination attempt been unsuccessful, with Kennedy serving two full terms as President. ({{ISBN|0595471927}}) Lee Harvey Oswald's rifle jams during the assassination attempt, leaving Kennedy wounded and Governor Connally dead.

In the ''[[Space: 1999]]'' graphic novel, ''Aftershock and Awe'' (2013), the events of the television series are set within an [[alternate history]].  That history diverged from our own when Kennedy escaped assassination by visiting [[Cape Canaveral]] instead of Dallas. His survival led to an accelerated space race and diminished [[Cold War]] tensions, although a limited nuclear exchange occurred between the United States and [[North Korea]] in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Gasska et al: ''Space 1999: Aftershock and Awe:'' Fort Lee, NJ: Archaia: 2013: {{ISBN|1936393883}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2010 book, ''[[TimeRiders#Books|TimeRiders]]'', a training mission involves going back to November 22, 1963, to stop Lee Harvey Oswald from killing JFK. This results in a new timeline in which a large space program sends a mission to Mars on September 10, 2001. The trainees learn that history corrects itself, and Oswald, who was originally a lone gunman, was no longer alone when he shot the President but was part of a [[Conspiracy theories about the death of John F. Kennedy|conspiracy]], thanks to their interference with the timestream.

[[Stephen King]]'s novel ''[[11/22/63]]'', published in 2011, tells about a time traveler trying to stop the assassination. The novel was adapted into a TV series, ''[[11.22.63]]'', in 2016. In both versions, the protagonist succeeds in saving Kennedy, but returns to a dystopian future brought about by his actions, prompting him to return to the past to "reset" the results of his intervention.

In the 1992 anthology ''Alternate Kennedys'', edited by Mike Resnick, 25 science fiction authors imagine alternate histories involving the Kennedys, including speculating upon different outcomes of November 22, 1963.

In [[American Heroes Channel]]'s ''What if? Armageddon 1962'', [[Richard Paul Pavlick|Richard Pavlick]] succeeds in assassinating President-elect Kennedy, and [[Lyndon Johnson]] is sworn in on January 20, 1961. While the [[Bay of Pigs]] invasion goes as it historically did, the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] is different. Having more confidence in his military advisers than Kennedy did, Johnson authorizes military air strikes to take out the missile sites. However, some missiles were hidden from sight and the United States, Cuba and the Soviet Union engage in a nuclear war.

In [[Ken Davenport]]'s 2017 novel ''[[The Two Gates]]'', Kennedy survives with the Dallas shooting with the back-to-throat wound he actually received, but First Lady Jackie is killed by the fatal third shot. The novel deals with speculation as to how Kennedy would've deal with the [[Vietnam War]] had he lived.

In a 2018 episode of the TV series ''[[Timeless (TV series)|Timeless]]'', a young Kennedy is transported to 2018, and before he can be returned to 1934, he is warned not to go to Dallas in 1963. When the time travelers return to 2018, they are told he was killed in [[Austin, Texas]] after two years as president.

== Miscellaneous ==

The card game [[Chrononauts]], which simulates the cause-and-effects of changing history through time-travel, features Kennedy's assassination as a Linchpin card. When flipped (and Kennedy is injured rather than killed), it affects three later Ripple Points: the assassinations of [[Robert F. Kennedy]] and [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] (1968), the [[Apollo 11|Apollo 11 moon landing]] (1969), and Richard Nixon's resignation (1974).

''Reelect JFK'', in which Kennedy is a playable character, set in an [[alternative timeline]], where he survives his assassination attempt, and attempts to seek reelection in 1964, while confronting key political issues such as Vietnam and the Civil Rights Movement, and discovering who was responsible for the assassination attempt on his life.http://www.giantbomb.com/reelect-jfk/3030-5633/

The 2004 video game ''[[JFK Reloaded]]'' puts the player in the role of [[Lee Harvey Oswald]], where the player is then scored on how closely one's version of the [[assassination]] matches the report of the [[Warren Commission]]: first shot missed, second hit JFK and Governor Connally and third on JFK's head. According to the company, the primary aim of the game was "to establish the most likely facts of what happened on 1963-11-22 by running the world’s first mass-participation forensic construction", the theory being that a player could help prove that Lee Harvey Oswald had the "means and the opportunity to commit the crime", and thus help prove the [[Warren Commission]]'s findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2004/nov/22/usnews.games |title=JFK shooting game 'despicable' |work=The Guardian.com |date=November 23, 2004 |access-date=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;


The 2010 video game ''[[Call of Duty: Black Ops]]'' gives hints that the main player character Alex Mason ([[Sam Worthington]]) is [[brainwashing|brainwashed]] by the [[Soviet Union]] into assassinating Kennedy within the context of the video game. An ending cutscene shows Mason was in the crowd of onlookers who watched Kennedy disembark from Air Force One in Lovefield.

In the post-credits scene of the 2016 video game ''[[Mafia III]]'', Lincoln Clay's former CIA handler in Vietnam and Lincoln's intelligence provider in order to take down the Marcano Crime Family, John Donovan, has been invited to a Senate Committee hearing in 1971 to testify his participation in Lincoln's revenge against the Marcanos, Donovan explains that he helped Lincoln was due to evidence that he uncovered that Sal, the boss of the Marcano Crime family, has been one of the conspirators of the assassination of Kennedy, and further evidence states that one of the senators presiding over the hearing as another conspirator, Donovan then later pulls his silenced pistol and kills the senator, stating that he will hunt down those responsible for the death of Kennedy.

[[Nintendo Switch]] ports of both games, and a sequel, ''Bayonetta 3'', were announced in December 2017 during [[The Game Awards 2017]].

''Bayonetta 2'' carries on the action-style gameplay of its predecessor, in which players control the eponymous Bayonetta as she fights against various angelic and demonic forces using combinations of melee attacks and gunplay. Dodging enemy attacks at the last second activates 'Witch Time', slowing down enemies around Bayonetta and allowing players to easily retaliate and solve certain environmental puzzles. Players are also able to use special moves called Torture Attacks, trapping opponents in infernal devices for extra points. Weapon customization from the first game also returns, allowing players to equip combinations of new weapons on both Bayonetta's hands and feet. A large array of weapons can be equipped, including the character's signature guns, a bow, swords and other forms of projectile weapons.&lt;ref name= "IGNpreview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2014/08/08/bayonetta-2-unrelenting-sexy-and-totally-outrageous|title=Bayonetta 2: Unrelenting, Sexy, and Totally Outrageous|author=Otero, Jose|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=2014-08-08|accessdate=2014-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Players earn grades during combat, with the highest 'Pure Platinum' grade achieved by performing high numbers of combos, in the fastest time possible, without being damaged.&lt;ref name= "SilGrading"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siliconera.com/2014/08/05/heres-get-platinum-grade-bayonetta-2/|title=Here’s How You Get A Platinum Grade In Bayonetta 2|author=|publisher=Siliconera|date=2014-08-05|accessdate=2014-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with the previous game, Bayonetta can use Torture Attacks on her enemies, conjured torture devices that finish off single enemies in gruesome ways and grant a bonus to the player.&lt;ref name= "IGNpreview"/&gt;

''Bayonetta 2'' also adds a new gameplay element called Umbran Climax which can be activated when the player has a full magic gauge. Similar to the state of boss fights in the first game, this technique strengthens Bayonetta's attacks and combos with extra Wicked Weaves and Infernal Demon summons for a short period of time. This increases their overall range and damage and also replenishes Bayonetta's health when in use.&lt;ref name= "EuroPreview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-08-08-bayonetta-2-is-a-sequel-to-savour|title=Bayonetta 2 is a sequel to savour|author=Robinson, Martin|publisher=[[Eurogamer]]|date=2014-08-08|accessdate=2014-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://platinumgames.com/2014/02/14/bayonetta-2-coming-to-wii-u-in-2014/ |title=Bayonetta 2 coming to Wii U in 2014! « PlatinumGames Inc |publisher=PlatinumGames.com |date=2014-02-14 |accessdate=2014-06-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140701080957/http://platinumgames.com/2014/02/14/bayonetta-2-coming-to-wii-u-in-2014/ |archive-date=2014-07-01 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="youtube1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdQg43n2OaM |title=Nintendo Direct 2.13.14 |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2014-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==

===Setting and characters===
Most of ''Bayonetta 2'' takes place on the fictional sacred mountain of Fimbulventr and the nearby town of Noatun, which are located in the Middle East. The main character Bayonetta (voiced by Hellena Taylor) travels to the mountain to find the Gates of Hell so that she can save her friend Jeanne (voiced by [[Grey DeLisle-Griffin]]).

Returning characters include Rodin (voiced by [[Dave Fennoy]]), the bartender of ''Gates of Hell'' who supplies Bayonetta with powerful weapons; Luka (voiced by [[Yuri Lowenthal]]), a journalist who provides Bayonetta with valuable information; and Enzo (now voiced by [[John Kassir]], replacing [[Chick Vennera]]), an informant who provides comic relief for the game. New characters include Loki (voiced by Mark Daughtery), an amnesiac boy who guides Bayonetta to the mountain; the Masked Lumen (voiced by [[Crispin Freeman]]), a powerful Sage who is Bayonetta's new rival; and Loptr (voiced by [[TJ Ramini]]), the mysterious Prophet who is apparently allied with the Masked Lumen.

===Story===
A few months after the first ''Bayonetta'', Bayonetta is in the middle of Christmas shopping with Enzo when a group of angels attack the city during a stuntplane flyover. Teaming up with fellow witch and friend Jeanne, she is on the verge of winning the battle until a demon summoning goes wrong. Despite Bayonetta being able to put down the demon, Jeanne is attacked, causing her soul to be claimed by the depths of Inferno. At the same time, a Lumen Sage is brought to the present day by a mysterious figure who promises him the chance for revenge.

Upon a tip from her informant Enzo, Bayonetta heads to the sacred mountain of Fimbulventr. An entrance to the realm of Inferno, the Gates of Hell, is said to be inside and Bayonetta plans to use it to save her friend.&lt;ref name="FamStory"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.famitsu.com/news/201406/26056050.html|title=『ベヨネッタ2』ストーリーやアクションなどの最新情報が到着！　同梱されるWii U版『ベヨネッタ』の追加要素も公開|publisher=''[[Famitsu]]''|date=2014-06-26|accessdate=2014-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bayonetta arrives in Noatun, the city at the foot of the mountain, and meets a boy called Loki who is trying to reach Fimbulventr for reasons he cannot remember. The pair of them strike a deal to travel together as Loki claims his powers will be needed in order to reach the realm to Inferno. Though able to learn some information about Loki's lost memories thanks to Luka, the journey suffers setbacks from angel and demon attacks alike. Both Loki and Bayonetta are also hunted by the masked Lumen Sage and the mysterious Prophet who reveals that he knows Loki. The Prophet also shows Bayonetta a vision of the past that implies the Witch Hunts 500 years ago were not truly caused by Balder.

After narrowly escaping their aggressors, Bayonetta reaches Inferno and travels into its depths to save Jeanne's soul. With the help of Rodin, Bayonetta is able to revive Jeanne's soul back to the human world. However, the masked Sage attacks again and finally reveals his true identity as a young Balder who is trying to hunt down Loki as part of his revenge. Even though she is able to save the boy from Balder's attacks, Loki suddenly loses control of his powers and sweeps both Bayonetta and Balder into a time rift that sends them 500 years into the past. Now in Vigrid during the Witch Hunts, Bayonetta meets her mother Rosa and the two witches work together to fight back against the onslaught of angels. When they become separated, Bayonetta encounters Loptr, a doppelgänger of Loki and the one who would eventually become the Prophet in the present day. Loptr claims that the Eyes of the World, one of which Bayonetta possesses, belong to him. Later meeting with the young Balder, Bayonetta arrives too late to stop Loptr from murdering Rosa. Bayonetta realizes that Loptr is the one that Balder should really be after instead of Loki and that Loptr had brought the Sage to the present day to use as a pawn. The two of them decide to work together and return to the present to stop Loptr's plans. Meanwhile, in the present day, Luka encounters Loki having now escaped from Inferno. Claiming that he now remembers everything, Loki pleads Luka to take him to Fimbulventr.

With the assistance of a revived Jeanne, Bayonetta and Balder reach the top of Fimbulventr and find Loptr having already captured Loki. Loptr explains that he and Loki were once the God of Chaos, Aesir, the true creator of the Eyes of the World. Aesir had split his power amongst humanity to create the Eyes, but had also split his very soul into two halves of good and evil in the process. Loki, the good half, was given the power to control the Eyes directly and Loptr promptly takes that power for his own. Despite their efforts, Loptr takes both of the Eyes from Balder and Bayonetta and transforms into Aesir with the intent to rule over humanity as their god. As the final clash takes place, Loki remembers that Aesir's true power is to erase anything he wants from the world. He uses that power to destroy the Eyes, weakening Loptr and making him easy fodder for the combined summoning Bayonetta, Balder, and Jeanne perform moments later. Loptr, with his body destroyed and only his soul remaining, attempts to escape to another time to try his plan again in an era where the Eyes still exist. Balder stops him and absorbs the evil soul, despite warnings from Loki that doing so will eventually poison his very core. Balder reveals he knows that Bayonetta is his daughter and asks her to stop him should Loptr's evil lead him astray. Realizing that her father's actions during their first meeting were not his own, Bayonetta can only watch as the Sage is returned to his own time. With Loptr and the Eyes gone, Loki says he plans to take a break from the world's affairs but that he and Bayonetta may meet again in the future. He wishes her goodbye and then fades away.

A few days pass since the events at Fimbulventr. Bayonetta and Jeanne are taking advantage of the post holiday sales, watching with amusement at Luka being roped into advertising Rodin's bar. Bayonetta suddenly remembers that she forgot Enzo and promptly sees him crashing down the street in a plane with angels in pursuit. Despite her annoyance at having ruined another dress, Bayonetta teams up with Jeanne to take to battle once again.

In a post-credits scene, Balder is shown returning to his time period, now corrupted by the evil of Loptr's soul. Donning his golden mask from the first game, he begins his plot to reunite the three realms, thus setting up the events of the first ''Bayonetta''.

== Development ==
Shortly after the release of ''Bayonetta'', [[Hideki Kamiya]] discussed with Yusuke Hashimoto ideas for sequels and spin-off games from the title. Despite these discussions, Kamiya believed they would never release a sequel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Keza|last=MacDonald|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2012/09/14/sega-consulting-on-bayonetta-2.aspx|title=Sega Consulting On Bayonetta 2|publisher=Game Informer|accessdate=June 19, 2013|date=September 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Kamiya's Twitter account later stated that he might release the sequel if ''Bayonetta'' sold well. ''Bayonetta 2'' was revealed during a [[List of Nintendo Direct presentations|Nintendo Direct on September 13, 2012]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Keza|last=MacDonald|url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2012/09/13/bayonetta-2-announced-for-wii-u|title=Bayonetta 2 Announced For Wii U|publisher=IGN|date=2012-09-13|accessdate=2013-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for the game's Wii U exclusivity was because Nintendo stepped in with additional funding after it was shelved by [[Sega]].&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/i/moments/963271450370236416&lt;/ref&gt; PlatinumGames producer [[Atsushi Inaba]], responding to complaints by fans of the original game, stated that ''Bayonetta 2'' would not exist if Nintendo had not partnered with the developer to make the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Michael|last=McWhertor|url=http://www.polygon.com/gaming/2012/9/22/3371474/bayonetta-2-would-not-exist-without-nintendo-platinum-games-wii-u|title='Bayonetta 2' would not exist without Nintendo, says PlatinumGames|publisher=Polygon|date=2012-09-22|accessdate=2013-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Work on the game was based on feedback the staff received from the original ''Bayonetta'' to bring various improvements. Nintendo was not involved in the making of the game other than as an "observer" and the staff were pleased with their experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Michael|last=McWhertor|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/197634/going_platinum_bayonetta_2_.php|title=Going Platinum: Bayonetta 2, combat design and the Nintendo angle|publisher=Gamasutra|date=August 6, 2013|accessdate=August 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the improvements made by staff was to the movements of enemies: in the first game, there was a single enemy movement when Bayonetta struck them, while in ''Bayonetta 2'', they have differing animations depending on the direction of Bayonetta's attack.&lt;ref name="PGblogMovement"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://platinumgames.com/2014/07/04/figuring-out-damage-motion/|title=Platinum Blog: Figuring Out Damage Motion|author=Yamaguchi, Takaaki|publisher=[[PlatinumGames]] Blog|date=4 July 2014|accessdate=18 July 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140725085238/http://platinumgames.com/2014/07/04/figuring-out-damage-motion/|archive-date=2014-07-25|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The architecture for the main city environment, Noatun, was based on cities in Belgium and Italy, such as [[Bruges]] (church interiors), [[Brussels]] (the grand buildings), [[Florence]] (city streets and houses) and [[Venice]] (the canal network).&lt;ref name="PGblogCity"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://platinumgames.com/2014/07/18/cities-and-waterways/|title=Platinum Blog: Cities and Waterways|author=Onishi Hiroki|publisher=[[PlatinumGames]] Blog|date=18 July 2014|accessdate=18 July 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140725081551/http://platinumgames.com/2014/07/18/cities-and-waterways/|archivedate=25 July 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a [[List of Nintendo Direct presentations#January 2013|Wii U Direct]] from January 2013, PlatinumGames showed a development trailer for the game. They confirmed game development was going smoothly, but did not go into many gameplay details.&lt;ref name=B2Trailer&gt;{{cite web|title=Bayonetta 2 - Trailer|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUbgRxf3fLg|publisher=Nintendo of America, Inc.|accessdate=6 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A playable demo of the game was featured at Nintendo's booth during [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2013|E3 2013]], following the reveal of the game's first gameplay trailer. A multiplayer mode was also announced, along with the option of a touch-based control scheme and the confirmation that the game will support [[Off-TV Play]].&lt;ref name= "NinOffPlay"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://e3.nintendo.com/games/detail/bayonetta-2/|title=Bayonetta 2 : Nintendo @ E3 2013|publisher=[[Nintendo]]|accessdate=13 June 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130816050453/http://e3.nintendo.com/games/detail/bayonetta-2/|archivedate=16 August 2013|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Nintendo Direct from February 2014,&lt;ref name="youtube1"/&gt; another trailer for the game was released, showing off the new environments players can expect as well as some of the basic story elements of the game. Further gameplay was also released, revealing the use of Japanese voice actors for the Japanese release, new weapons for Bayonetta to use as well as the use of the new youth character as being playable. As of the ''[[List of Nintendo Direct presentations#Special Nintendo Direct editions|Bayonetta 2 Direct]]'', the game was released on September 20, 2014 in Japan and in October 2014 for the rest of the world. At [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2014|E3 2014]], it was announced the game would include a port of the original ''[[Bayonetta]]'', which would include exclusive Nintendo costumes, dual audio voice tracks, and touch controls.&lt;ref name="NA/EUreleasedate"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.siliconera.com/2014/06/11/bayonetta-wii-u-60fps-tv-play-dual-audio/ Bayonetta On Wii U: 60fps, Off-TV Play, Dual Audio - Siliconera&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The original game would be a digital download via the [[Nintendo eShop]] and on a separate disc for retailers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siliconera.com/2014/06/16/bayonetta-2-includes-bayonetta-game-disc-japan/ |title=Bayonetta 2 Includes Bayonetta Game Disc In Japan |publisher=Siliconera |date=2014-06-16 |accessdate=2014-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
{{refimprove section|date=March 2016}}
The music of ''Bayonetta 2'' was composed by a group of members led by Masami Ueda, many of whom returned after being featured on the soundtrack for the first game. Ueda states that he finds the score for ''Bayonetta 2'' much livelier than the one for ''Bayonetta'' and explains they attempted to create new elements in the music by switching out certain instruments for others.

A key difference in the soundtrack between the games is the inclusion of dynamic music for boss fights based on the progression in ''Bayonetta 2''. Ueda states that the music is broken up into phases and are set off by triggers based on animations and other cues in the scene which allow for swells in the music to match up the action onscreen. A similar approach was done for the stage tracks as well, with as many as 10 shorter loops mixed together that transition based on the player's progress through the stage. Compared to the original ''Bayonetta's'' 150 tracks, ''Bayonetta 2'' has 183 tracks with higher audio quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://platinumgames.com/2014/08/29/music-in-bayonetta-2/|title=Music in Bayonetta 2 «  PlatinumGames Inc.|publisher=|access-date=2014-11-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129054313/http://platinumgames.com/2014/08/29/music-in-bayonetta-2/|archive-date=2014-11-29|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the original game, ''Bayonetta 2'' features a cover of an old song but remixed into the signature style of the games, "[[Moon River]]" by Andy Williams. Both the remixed version and the original are included in the game, much like how "[[Fly Me To The Moon]]" was used as the main theme song for ''Bayonetta''. The game's battle theme, "Tomorrow is Mine", was one of the first pieces of music revealed in its entirety during promotion of the game. Both of these songs were performed by Keeley Bumford. Also like the original game, ''Bayonetta 2'' received a five disc original soundtrack, which was released in Japan on October 29, 2014.

===Marketing===
{{Expand section|date=January 2018}}
To [[Video game development#Marketing|market]] the release, Nintendo partnered with [[Playboy]] to set a [[photo shoot]] with [[Playboy Playmate|Playmate]] [[Pamela Horton]] [[cosplay]]ing Bayonetta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Malone|first1=Colin|title=Nintendo partners with Playboy to promote Bayonetta 2|url=http://nintendotoday.com/nintendo-partners-with-playboy-to-promote-bayonetta-2/|accessdate=31 January 2018|work=NintendoToday|date=October 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Bayonetta 2'' received critical acclaim. It received an aggregated score of 91/100 on [[Metacritic]] based on 80 reviews.&lt;ref name="MC"/&gt; The Japanese magazine ''[[Famitsu]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s four reviewers collectively awarded the game a score of 38 out of 40.&lt;ref name="Fam"/&gt; ''[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]'' awarded ''Bayonetta 2'' a score of 10 out of 10. The magazine's reviewer described it as "a riotous, spectacular work of the highest order of camp" and praised the game for the extent of its customisability and for refining problematic elements from the first ''Bayonetta'', with tighter pacing and the removal of "sudden, mid-cinematic, instafail [[Quick time event|QTEs]]". The reviewer concluded, "This is a game that you can complete in ten hours, but play and replay forever. … It is a masterclass in combat design, in videogame variety, in the balance between accessibility and depth."&lt;ref name="Edge"/&gt; [[GameSpot]] reviewer Mark Walton said the game "will be remembered as an absolute classic" and awarded it a perfect 10/10, the seventh game in the site's history to receive that score.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/gamespots-complete-list-of-10-10-reviews-and-how-t/1100-6422955/|title=GameSpot's Complete List of 10/10 Reviews and How Those Scores Are Decided|work=gamespot.com|publisher=CBS Interactive|date=October 15, 2014|accessdate=October 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chris Carter from [[Destructoid]] also rated it a 10/10, where he declared it as "one of the finest action games of all time", alongside ''[[Devil May Cry 3]]''.&lt;ref name="Destruct"/&gt;

Several reviews agreed that the game was an improvement on its predecessor, despite acknowledgement that its combat mechanics were largely unchanged: [[Eurogamer]]&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Martin Robinson concluded, "''Bayonetta 2''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s biggest disappointment may be that it's an iterative sequel, but it's not such a problem when it's iterating on genius."&lt;ref name="Eurogamer"/&gt; [[IGN]]&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Jose Otero commented that its art direction and pacing "make ''Bayonetta 1'' look poor by comparison,"&lt;ref name="IGN"/&gt; while [[GameTrailers]] called it "sharpened to a nearly flawless degree" compared to its predecessor, praising the variety in addition to the style mixed with the gameplay, where the game "thrives on throwing players into complete madness and letting them conquer it."&lt;ref name="GameTrailers"/&gt; Chris Carter at Destructoid stated "Four years later and Platinum hasn't lost its edge with ''Bayonetta 2''. It's just as stylish and as fun as ever"&lt;ref name="Destruct"/&gt;

Of the game's new features, the co-operative online Tag Climax mode was welcomed by GameSpot&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Mark Walton&lt;ref name="GSpot"/&gt; and by Eurogamer&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Martin Robinson, who praised it for requiring the player to gain a deep understanding of the combo scoring system;&lt;ref name="Eurogamer"/&gt; however, IGN&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Otero commented that the fun it provides was restricted to short bursts, and [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Arthur Gies found the mode's co-operative mechanics at odds with its competitive focus on scoring.&lt;ref name="IGN"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Polygon"/&gt; Otero and Robinson both criticized the game's optional [[touchscreen]]-based control system, intended to improve accessibility for new players, as very limited in comparison to the game's main control scheme.&lt;ref name="Eurogamer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IGN"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5149">[[Image:Fitzgerald, Saturday evening post.png|thumb|The cover of the ''[[Saturday Evening Post]]'' (May 1, 1920) containing "Bernice Bobs Her Hair".  The issue marked the first time Fitzgerald's name appeared on the cover.]]

"'''Bernice Bobs Her Hair'''" is a [[short story]] by [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]], written in [[1920 in literature|1920]] and first published in the ''[[Saturday Evening Post]]'' in May of that year. It appeared shortly thereafter in the collection ''[[Flappers and Philosophers]]''.

== Background ==
The story was based on letters Fitzgerald sent to his younger sister, Annabel, advising her on how to be more attractive to young men. The original text was much longer, but Fitzgerald cut nearly 3000 words and changed the ending to make the story more attractive to publishers.

== Summary ==
The story concerns Bernice, a wealthy girl from [[Eau Claire, Wisconsin]], who goes to visit her cousin Marjorie for the month of August. Marjorie feels that Bernice is a drag on her social life, and none of the boys wants to dance with Bernice.

Bernice overhears a conversation between Marjorie and Marjorie's mother in which the younger girl complains that Bernice is socially hopeless. The next morning, Bernice threatens to leave town, but when Marjorie is unfazed, Bernice relents and agrees to let Marjorie turn her into a society girl. Marjorie teaches Bernice how to hold interesting conversations, how to flirt with even unattractive or uninteresting boys to make herself seem more desirable, and how to dance. Bernice's best line is teasing the boys with the idea that she will soon [[bob cut|bob her hair]], and they will get to watch.  

The new Bernice is a big hit with the boys in town with her new attitude, especially with Warren, a boy Marjorie keeps around as her own but neglects. When it becomes clear that Warren has shifted his interest from Marjorie to Bernice, Marjorie sets about humiliating Bernice by tricking her into going through with bobbing her hair. When Bernice comes out of the barbershop with the new hairdo, her hair is flat and strange. The boys suddenly lose interest in her, and Bernice realizes that she was tricked.

Marjorie's mother points out that Bernice's haircut, which was then seen only with "liberated" women, would cause a scandal at an upcoming party held in her and Marjorie's honor. Bernice, deciding it would be best to leave the town before the party the next day, packs her trunk in the middle of the night and decides to leave on a train at 1 a.m.

Before she goes, she sneaks into Marjorie's room and cuts off her cousin's two braids, taking them with her on her run to the station and throwing them onto Warren's front porch.

== Name ==
The name of the title character echoes that of [[Berenice II of Egypt]], whose legendary sacrifice of her golden tresses resulted in the victory of her husband in war and the gods giving her an honor; her tresses being placed into the heavens, as the constellation [[Coma Berenices]].&lt;ref&gt;McDonough, Chris.

Accessed June 21, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

The story was converted into a [[one-act play]] by D.D. Brooke for The Dramatic Publishing Company. It was adapted into a musical by Adam Gwon and Julia Jordan.

The [[Ireland|Irish]] [[pop music|pop]] group [[The Divine Comedy (band)|The Divine Comedy]] turned the story into a song on its [[1993 in music|1993]] album ''[[Liberation (The Divine Comedy album)|Liberation]]''.

'''''Better Off Dead''''' is a 1985 American [[Teen film|teen]] [[romantic comedy]] film starring [[John Cusack]] and written and directed by [[Savage Steve Holland]]. It tells the story of high school student Lane Myer who is [[Suicide crisis|suicidal]] after his girlfriend breaks up with him shortly before Christmas.

==Plot==
In the town of Greendale in [[northern California]], high school student Lane Myer's two main interests are skiing and his girlfriend of six months, Beth. Shortly before Christmas, Beth dumps Lane for the handsome and popular captain of the ski team, Roy Stalin. Roy is an arrogant bully who unfairly rejects Lane at ski team tryouts. Beth also criticizes Lane's car, an old station wagon. Although Lane also owns a disabled 1967 [[Chevrolet Camaro|Camaro]], he has not been able to get it running.

Lane lives in a suburban development with his mother, Jenny, a ditzy housewife who routinely concocts creepy (and creeping) family meals; his genius little brother, Badger, who never speaks but at the age of "almost 8" can build powerful lasers and attract trashy women from “How-to” books; and his lawyer father, Al, who daily tries to stop the menacing paperboy, Johnny, from damaging his garage with thrown newspapers. Furthermore, Johnny claims that the Myers owe him two dollars for newspapers, and persistently hounds Lane yelling "I want my two dollars!" Lane also regularly encounters two Korean [[drag racing|drag racers]], one of whom learned to speak English by listening to [[Howard Cosell]].

Lane cannot get past Beth's rejection and decides that death is the only way out of his misery. He makes several half-hearted attempts at suicide, which all comically fail. With the help of his best friend, Charles de Mar, (who in lieu of not being able to get "real drugs" in their small town, constantly inhales everyday substances like [[Jell-O]], snow, and [[nitrous oxide]] in a whipped cream can) Lane tries to ski the K-12, the highest peak in town, in hopes of getting Beth back but wipes out. Lane is further embarrassed when he gets fired from his humiliating fast food job at Pig Burgers in front of Roy and Beth, who are there on a date. To top it all, he increasingly begins to suffer from neurotic hallucinations owing to the mounting frustrations in his life.

As Lane attempts to either end his life or win back his ex-girlfriend, he gradually gets to know a new girl: a French foreign-exchange student named Monique, who has a crush on him. She is staying with Lane's overbearing neighbor Mrs. Smith, who continually tries to force Monique into being a girlfriend for her socially backward son Ricky.  The pair are so annoying that she pretends she cannot speak English.  Monique, a [[Los Angeles Dodgers|Dodgers]] fan, turns out to be an excellent auto mechanic and skier who helps Lane fix his Camaro and tries to build his confidence. When Roy insults Monique, Lane challenges him to a ski race down the K-12, with the winner to be captain of the ski team. Monique helps Lane prepare for the race, which he ultimately wins despite losing one ski and being pursued by Johnny. Beth rushes to embrace Lane at the finish line, but he rejects her and, after besting Ricky (who attempts to keep Lane from rescuing Monique from the restraints of his mother) in a ski-pole swordfight, drives off with Monique in his Camaro. Lane and Monique are last seen kissing at home plate at [[Dodger Stadium]], with Johnny bicycling towards them, while in a mid-credit scene Badger demolishes his house by launching a home-made space shuttle from his room.

==Production==
Parts of the film were shot in [[Alta, Utah|Alta]], [[Brighton, Utah|Brighton]], and [[Snowbird, Utah|Snowbird]] in [[Utah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=D'Arc|first1=James V.|title=When Hollywood came to town: a history of moviemaking in Utah|date=2010|publisher=Gibbs Smith|location=Layton, Utah|isbn=9781423605874|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;A dream sequence was produced in stop-motion where hamburgers comes alive. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxZfFgizACw&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
[[Siskel &amp; Ebert]] gave the film two thumbs down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.filmarcade.net/2008/06/savage-steve-holland-talks-about-better.html |title=Savage Steve Holland talks about "Better Off Dead" &amp; "One Crazy Summer" at the Aero Theater – Written by Ben Kenber |publisher=FilmArcade.net |date= |accessdate=2011-11-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005121648/http://www.filmarcade.net/2008/06/savage-steve-holland-talks-about-better.html |archivedate=2011-10-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bill Cosford of ''[[The Miami Herald]]'' wrote, "''Better Off Dead'' has the body of a tired teen comedy but the soul of an inspired student film; it's the first movie in a long time to interrupt itself periodically with flights of animated fancy. At one point, romantic foreshadowing is accomplished by a "clay-mation" sequence featuring cheeseburgers in love. At another, a lovesick teen draws a cartoon picture of his faithless girlfriend, and the drawing tells him to get lost."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.metacritic.com/critic/bill-cosford |author= Cosford, Bill |date= 17 Oct 1985 |title= Better Off Dead |publisher= ''The Miami Herald'' |accessdate= June 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Savage Steve Holland, Cusack did not like the film and walked out of a screening as both were making ''[[One Crazy Summer]]'', later confronting Holland saying ''Better Off Dead'' "was the worst thing I have ever seen. I will never trust you as a director ever again, so don't speak to me." Holland claimed that Cusack felt he had been made to look foolish and that his comments "made me not care about movies anymore".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesneeze.com/mt-archives/000134.php The Sneeze – Better Off Dead Tribute] Interview with Savage Steve Holland&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in a 2013 [[Reddit]] "Ask Me Anything" chat, Cusack, when asked if he hated filming ''Better Off Dead'', responded, "No, I just thought it could have been better, but I think that about almost all my films. I have nothing against the film.... Glad people love it still."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19cdc3/hey_its_john_cusack_im_here_talk_to_about_freedom/c8mqhps/ Reddit Ask Me Anything] Hey, it's John Cusack, I'm here to talk about Freedom of the Press Foundation, among other things. Ask Me Anything.&lt;/ref&gt;

As of October 2018, ''Better Off Dead'' holds a rating of 75% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 24 reviews with the consensus: "''Better Off Dead'' is an anarchic mix of black humor and surreal comedy anchored by John Cusack's winsome, charming performance."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1002213_better_off_dead?&lt;/ref&gt;

The film's [[soundtrack]] was produced primarily by [[Rupert Hine]].

The opening track, "With One Look (The Wildest Dream)", was produced by Hine and features Cy Curnin and Jamie West-Oram of [[The Fixx]] on lead vocals and guitars respectively. Hine had previously worked with Curnin and West-Oram, and also contributed vocals to the song. The following track, "Arrested By You", as well as "Better Off Dub (Title Music)" and "Race The K-12 (Instrumental)" were performed solely by Hine.

"Dancing in Isolation" features [[Terri Nunn]] of [[Berlin (band)|Berlin]] on lead vocals. Hine produced the song and was reportedly under consideration to produce an album for Berlin.

"Come to Your Rescue" was performed by Thinkman, a group formed by, and including, Hine for the purpose of restoring his solo career without the music press knowing about it. West-Oram also provided guitar work to this song, as well as the instrumental "The Falcon Beat".

The only two tracks on the CD without Hine's involvement are "A Little Luck" and "One Way Love (Better Off Dead)." ''[[Valley Girl (film)|Valley Girl]]'''s [[Elizabeth Daily]], credited on the soundtrack as E. G. Daily, sang lead vocals on both songs and also performed them in the film during the high school dance scene.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8547">'''Black Star''', also known as '''Black Star Publishing Company''', was started by refugees from [[Germany]] who had established photographic agencies there in the 1920s. Today it is a New York City-based photographic agency with offices in London and in [[White Plains, New York]].  It is known for [[photojournalism]], corporate assignment [[photography]] and [[stock photography]] services worldwide. It is noted for its contribution to the history of photojournalism in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Neubauer|first1=Hendrik|title=Black Star: 60 years of photojournalism|date=1997|publisher=Könemann|location=Köln|isbn=3-89508-250-3|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was the first privately owned picture agency in the [[United States]], and introduced numerous new techniques in photography and illustrated journalism. The agency was closely identified with [[Henry Luce]]'s magazines ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' and ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''.&lt;ref&gt;C. Zoe Smith, "Black Star Picture Agency: Life's European Connection," ''Journalism History'' (1986), 13#1, pp. 19-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Black Star was formed in December 1935.&lt;ref name=Torosian39&gt;{{cite book|last1=Torosian|first1=Michael|title=Black Star : the Ryerson University historical print collection of the Black Star Publishing Company : portfolio selection and chronicle of a New York photo agency|date=2013|publisher=Lumiere Press|location=Toronto|isbn=978-0-921542-18-6|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The three founders were Kurt Safranski, Ernest Mayer and Kurt Kornfeld. In 1964, the company was sold to Howard Chapnick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Howard Chapnick, 74, Photo Agency Chief|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/05/29/nyregion/howard-chapnick-74-photo-agency-chief.html|accessdate=September 4, 2015|work=New York Times|date=May 29, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The three founders; Safranski, Mayer and Kornfeld were German Jews who fled Berlin during the Nazi regime. They brought with them a wealth of knowledge and some new ideas for the American press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=C. Zoe|title=History of the Mass Media in the United States an Encyclopedia.|date=2013|publisher=Taylor and Francis|location=Hoboken|isbn=1135917426|page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Safranski was a graphic designer and editor for the ''[[Berliner Illustrirte Zeitung]]'' ''(BIZ)'',  which was part of the ''Ullstein'' publishing house. During the early 1930s, ''[[Ullstein Verlag]]'' was Germany's largest publisher of books, newspapers and magazines. ''BIZ's'' circulation was over one million.  While an editor at ''BIZ'', Safranski was using two or more photos placed together to create a story which surpassed the need for text. Not only was this visually appealing, but it attracted more readers as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chapnick|first1=Howard|title=Truth Needs No Ally|date=1994|publisher=University of Missouri Press|isbn=0826209556|page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

This drew the attention of the top American mass media publishers. [[William Randolph Hearst]], a powerful media mogul of the day, was intrigued by the European advances in photography and printing. Hearst invited Safranski over to the United States to produce a dummy magazine using photos to tell the stories. Hearst liked the proposed idea but initially didn't move forward on it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pizzitola|first1=Louis|title=Hearst Over Hollywood: Power, Passion, and Propaganda in the Movies|date=2002|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=0231116462|page=306}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mayer then brought to idea to the experimental editorial department of [[Henry Luce]], the largest publisher of the day, with periodicals such as ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' and ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]''.  Luce collaborated with Black Star to produce a new weekly magazine called [[Life (magazine)|''Life'']].  ''Life'' would use artistic photos in a new format. These pictures would be large and take up the majority of the page. They could capture not only a moment in time, but an emotion and story that would be paramount to the text. Prior to this, photojournalism in the U.S. was relegated to regional newspapers where text was more important than photos.  Photos would sometimes be staged or posed or re-created to help a news article.  But this all changed with the advent of the 35mm camera.  The [[Leica Camera|Leica]], which was developed in Germany in 1925, was a small and easier to use camera.  Advances in half-tone printing made using photographs in periodicals easier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Collins|first1=Ross|title=A Brief History of Photography and Photojournalism|url=https://www.ndsu.edu/pubweb/~rcollins/242photojournalism/historyofphotography.html|website=North Dakota State University|accessdate=September 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Safranski and Mayer were already familiar with photographers who used this new technology to capture more candid moments.

Mayer owned the publishing company and photo agency, ''Mauritius'', in Berlin.  Forced by the Nazis to sell his business, he brought negatives, and connections to European photographers with him to the United States. The contacts included the notable photographers [[:de:Paul Wolff|Dr. Paul Wolff]]  and [[Fritz Goro]]. These contacts with European-based photographers, and the photographic negatives he brought with him, became the foundation for the new business.&lt;ref name=Torosian39 /&gt;  

Kornfeld was a literary agent back in his native Germany where he had a talent for bringing together authors and editors.  Originally the idea for the company was to be a publishing house and a photo agency just like Mayer's ''Mauritius''. However, the publishing business never took off and more profit was to be found in selling photos. Even though he had no experience with photography, Kornfeld became Black Star's best picture agent.  He had a talent for creating rapport between client and artist.  Therefore, Kornfeld handled their most important client, ''Life'' magazine, providing up to 200 photos a week.

Although ''Life'' was the agency's most high-profile client, Black Star also served other periodicals, newspapers, advertisers and publishers. Its stock of iconic photography represents a pictorial history of the 20th century beginning in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carlebach|first1=Michael|title=Encyclopedia of Twentieth-CentuPphotography|date=2005|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=1579583938|page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; This archive was anonymously donated to [[Ryerson University]] in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Torosian|first1=Michael|title=Black Star : the Ryerson University historical print collection of the Black Star Publishing Company : portfolio selection and chronicle of a New York photo agency|date=2013|publisher=Lumiere Press|location=Toronto|isbn=978-0-921542-18-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Noted Black Star photographers include [[Robert Capa]], [[Andreas Feininger]], [[Germaine Krull]], [[Philippe Halsman]], [[Martin Munkácsi]], [[Kurt Severin]], [[W. Eugene Smith]], [[Marion Post Wolcott|Marion Post-Wolcott]], [[Bill Brandt]], [[Henri Cartier-Bresson]], [[Charles Moore (photographer)|Charles Moore]], [[James Nachtwey]], [[Lee Lockwood]], [[Mario Giacomelli]] and [[Spider Martin]].

In 2003, Black Star's archive of 292,000 prints, created by more than 6,000 photographers was acquired by [[Jimmy Pattison]], a Canadian businessperson. In 2005, he donated it to [[Ryerson University]] in Toronto. In 2012, the Ryerson Image Centre was opened to house the collection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macleans.ca/economy/business/the-world-as-it-was/ ''Maclean's'' magazine, "Ryerson University wishes upon a shooting Black Star" by Sara Angel, September 27, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

Corporate assignment photography has become the largest segment of Black Star's business. The company claims to have captured more photographic images for more annual reports than any other photo agency or service.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2290">[[File:Comerford Crown.png|thumb|Comerford Crown, picture from: Dublin Penny Journal, Vol. 1, No. 9, August 25, 1832]]

The '''Comerford Crown''' or '''Ikerrin Crown''' is the name of a lost archaeological relic probably dating from the [[Bronze Age]] that was in the possession of the noble  [[Comerford Family]] from its discovery in 1692 in [[Ireland]], later removal from Ireland, and possible loss by that family while living in exile in France during the [[Reign of Terror]] (c. 1793).

The crown was an encased gold cap or crown which was discovered at the [[Devil's Bit]], [[Co. Tipperary]], in 1692.&lt;ref name=CF&gt;[http://comerfordfamily.blogspot.com/2009/07/comerford-profiles-9-joseph-comerford-d.html Comerford Profiles 9: Joseph Comerford (d. 1729), Marquis d’Anglure (with picture of the crown)], 2009-07-15, The Comerford Family History Blog&lt;/ref&gt; Joseph Comerford bought it and saved it from being melted down. Other similar antiquities (see: [[Golden hat]]) have been discovered elsewhere in Europe and have dated from the Bronze Age. 

The crown weighed about five ounces, and may have been melted down for its intrinsic value during the Reign of Terror.&lt;ref name=CF /&gt;

The eventual fate of the crown rescued by Comerford remains a mystery. The crown appears to have survived in safe hands for long time after his death. In his ''Histoire d’Irlande'' (1758), the Abbé MacGeoghegan, described this gold crown as being in the shape of a bonnet, and added: “This curious part of antiquity was sold to Joseph Comerford and must be preserved in the Castle of [[Anglure]], where he had bought the estate.”&lt;ref name="CF"/&gt;

Supporting the theory the crown survived the Reign of Terror is a contributor to the ''[[Dublin Penny Journal]]'' who in August 1832 claimed that the crown was then still preserved in the Château d’Anglure. However, Dr Czernicki, whose father bought the Chateau d’Anglure in 1832 from Monsieur Tissandier, said: “I never heard anyone speak about the piece of antiquity that you refer to."&lt;ref name="CF"/&gt;

It is therefore generally considered to have been lost and probably melted down during the French Revolution.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6135">{{Expand German|Tanzverbot|date=November 2012}}
'''Dancing bans''' are legal or religious prohibitions against dancing, which have been applied at various times in various jurisdictions around the world. Even more controversial than recreational or artistic dancing have been sexually suggestive forms such as [[lap dancing]], [[topless dancing]], and [[rave]] dancing.

==Legal bans==
''Tanzverbot'' is the German term for "dancing ban". In Germany and Switzerland, dancing on some holidays is banned by most [[German states|state]] or [[Swiss cantons|canton]] governments. These occasions are certain [[Christianity|Christian]] and secular holidays aimed at mourning or contemplation, such as [[Good Friday]], [[All Saints' Day]] (from its association with [[All Souls' Day]] practices) or memorial days like [[Volkstrauertag]]. The German and Swiss dancing bans prohibit public parties, but not dancing in one's private residence.

Until 1999, an ordinance in [[Pound, Virginia]] required that dance hall permits not be granted "to anyone who is not a proper person, nor to a person who is not a person of good moral character". After community opposition to granting him a permit, a lawsuit by William Elam, owner of the Golden Pine restaurant, resulted in the ordinance being struck down as unconstitutionally vague and infringing on free expression protected by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]]. A replacement ordinance drafted more narrowly prompted a 2001 lawsuit from Elam, though the restaurant later went out of business after revocation of its alcohol license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sullivan-county.com/identity/dance_pound.htm|title=Pound, Virginia Bans Dancing?|accessdate=2012-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sullivan-county.com/z/gpine.htm|title=Part 2: ABC revokes Golden Pine restaurant's license to sell alcohol|accessdate=2012-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1926, the [[New York City Cabaret Law]] has prohibited dancing in all spaces open to the public that sell food and/or drink with the exception of those who obtain a cabaret license. This law was still enforced until it was repealed in 2017. 

Between 1985 and 2002, a [[Seattle|Seattle, Washington]] law called the [[Teen Dance Ordinance]] enacted strict legal requirements for those wishing to have dancing by youth under the age of 21, effectively banning events that would feature young people dancing.

===Historic bans===
From the 1830s to 1950s, [[play party (U.S. traditional)|play parties]] became popular as a means to circumvent restrictions on dancing.

The events of the [[Footloose (1984 film)|1984 film ''Footloose'']] were inspired by a dancing ban in the heavily [[Southern Baptist Convention|Southern Baptist]] town of [[Elmore City, Oklahoma]], which lasted until 1980.
==Religious bans==
===Christianity===
Various Christian groups believe that dancing is either inherently sinful or that certain forms of dancing could lead to sinful thoughts or activities, and thus proscribe it either in general or during religious services. These include some adherents of [[Mennonite]], [[Hutterite]], [[Baptist]], [[Seventh-day Adventist]], and [[Holiness movement]] sects. [[Jehovah's Witness]]es disfavor events where there might be sexually suggestive dancing or excessive drinking of alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://defendingjehovahswitnesses.blogspot.com/2012/01/how-do-jehovahs-witnesses-view-dancing.html|title=How Do Jehovah's Witnesses View Dancing?|accessdate=2012-11-17|date=2012-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the [[Church of the Nazarene]] recommends against "All forms of dancing that detract from spiritual growth and break down proper moral inhibitions and reserve."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://media.premierstudios.com/nazarene/docs/Manual2005_09.pdf|title=Manual|page=51|year=2005–2009|author=Church of the Nazarene|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130302214359/http://media.premierstudios.com/nazarene/docs/Manual2005_09.pdf|archivedate=2013-03-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Christian churches determine doctrine locally and may be non-denominational, and these vary on their stances on social dancing.

In contrast, some strains of [[Charismatic Christianity]] practice rituals in which the [[Holy Spirit]] is believed to cause spontaneous dancing, among other behaviors. [[Mormonism]] has embraced social dancing to some degree since its founding.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |contribution-url= http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cdm/ref/collection/EoM/id/5654 |contribution= Dance |pages= 354-355 |last= Jacobson |first= Phyllis C. |editor-last= Ludlow |editor-first= Daniel H |editor-link= Daniel H. Ludlow |year= 1992 |title= [[Encyclopedia of Mormonism]] |location= New York |publisher= [[Macmillan Publishing]] |isbn= 0-02-879602-0 |oclc= 24502140 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;
===Islam===
In Islam, [[Salafists]] and [[Wahhabis]] consider dancing in general to be ''[[haram]]'' (forbidden).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.philly.com/2012-08-31/news/33500441_1_music-and-dance-couples-dances-anti-dance|date=2012-08-31|title=Does Islam ban dancing and music?|agency=Slate|author=Brian Palmer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conservative Islamic and [[Orthodox Jewish]] traditions prohibit contact between men and women in public (especially those not married to each other), and thus in these societies men and women either dance separately or not at all.

In contrast, [[Sufism]] encourages dancing, for example [[Sufi whirling]] and dancing to celebrate [[Mela Chiraghan]]. This has resulted in conflict in areas influenced by the [[Taliban]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/04/07/pakistani-festival-dancer_n_183960.html|accessdate=2012-11-17|date=2009-05-08|title=Pakistani Festival Dancers Banned By Religious Group|author=Stuart Whatley|work=Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Destination Canada''', formerly the '''Canadian Tourism Commission''' (CTC; {{lang-fr|Commission canadienne du tourisme}} (CCT)), was created in 1995 to promote [[tourism in Canada]].  It is a [[Crown corporation]], wholly owned by the [[Government of Canada]], which reports to the [[Minister of Small Business and Tourism]] and the [[Minister of Innovation, Science and Economic Development]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.appointments-nominations.gc.ca/prflOrg.asp?OrgID=TRC&amp;lang=eng&lt;/ref&gt;

Destination Canada states that it "is dedicated to promoting the growth and profitability of the Canadian tourism industry by [[marketing]] Canada as a desirable travel destination and providing timely and accurate information to the Canadian tourism industry to assist in its decision making." It also claims to "recognise that the greatest source of tourism knowledge and expertise rests with the tourism industry itself. Therefore, Destination Canada designs, delivers and funds marketing and research initiatives in [[partnership]] with [[Province|provincial]] and regional tourism associations, government agencies, hoteliers, tour operators, airlines and attractions managers."

It has operated marketing campaigns in [[Australia]], [[Brazil]], [[China]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[India]], [[Japan]], [[South Korea]], [[Mexico]], the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en-corporate.canada.travel/Where-We-Market|title=Where We Market Canada|publisher=Canada Tourism Commission|accessdate=2010-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization is headed by a 10-person [[board of directors]] which is overseen by a President and Chief Executive Officer, chosen from the combined private and public sector nature of the industry to represent the various [[regions of Canada]] as well as the country's [[demographics of Canada|demographic]] composition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.destinationcanada.com/about-ctc/our-leadership|title=Our Leadership|publisher=Canada Tourism Commission|accessdate=2016-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dialogic pedagogy''' is a [[Pedagogy|theory and practice of teaching]] in which [[dialogue]] is central. Teachers and students are in an [[equitable distribution|equitable]] relationship and listen to multiple points of view.

== History ==
Although modern interest in dialogic pedagogy seems to emerge only in the 1960s, it was a very old and probably widespread educational practice. Perhaps one of the best known examples of dialogic pedagogy in the Ancient times is the [[Socratic method]] described by his student [[Plato]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Complete works|last=Plato|first=|publisher=Hackett Pub.|year=1997|isbn=|location=Indianapolis, IN|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, dialogic practices and dialogic pedagogy existed in [[Ancient Greece]], before, during, and after [[Socrates]]' time, possibly in other forms than those depicted by Plato.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The spiritual art of dialogue: Mastering communication for personal growth, relationships, and the workplace|last=Apatow|first=Robert|publisher=Inner Traditions|year=1998|isbn=|location=Rochester, VT|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been a long tradition of dialogic pedagogy, called [[Chavrusa|Chavruta/Chavrusa/Havruta]], in [[Yeshiva|Jewish Yeshivas]], involving dialogic studies of Talmudic texts, that goes back to the eras of the Tannaim ([[Rabbi]]s of the [[Mishnaic Hebrew|Mishnaic]] period, 10-220 CE).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/723016390|title=The social structure of the rabbinic movement in Roman Palestine|last=Hezser|first=Catherine|publisher=Mohr Siebeck|year=1997|isbn=3161467973|location=Tübingen|pages=|oclc=723016390}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economist [[Amartya Sen]] argues that dialogic pedagogy has been well situated within the Indian religious and civic traditions and spread across Asia with the rise of Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/936760401|title=The argumentative Indian: Writings on Indian history, culture and identity|last=Sen|first=Amartya|publisher=Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux|year=2005|isbn=9780374105839|location=New York|pages=|oclc=936760401}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In more recent times, [[Mikhail Bakhtin]] introduced the idea of [[dialogism]], as opposed to "monologism", to literature.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/682085417|title=Problems of Dostoevsky's poetics|last=Bakhtin|first=Mikhail M.|publisher=Univ. of Minnesota Press|year=1999|isbn=0816612285|location=Minneapolis|pages=|oclc=682085417}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paulo Freire]]'s work, ''[[Pedagogy of the Oppressed]]'' introduced these ideas to educational theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dialogic Pedagogy: The Importance of Dialogue in Teaching and Learning|first1=David|last1=Skidmore|first2=Kyoko|last2=Murakami|publisher=Multilingual Matters|year=2016|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=fKq-DAAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formats ==
There are a number of formats of instruction, that have been recognized as "[[dialogic]]" (as opposed to "monologic").
* Interactional: Dialogue involves a high student-teacher talk ratio, short utterances/turns, and interactive exchanges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/881659890|title=Better than best practice : developing teaching and learning through dialogue|last=Lefstein|first=Adam|last2=Snell|first2=Julia|publisher=Routledge|year=2013|isbn=9780415618434|location=New York|pages=|oclc=881659890}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Question-answer: Dialogue involves either a teacher asking students questions and eliciting answers from the students or students asking questions and eliciting answers from the teacher and/or one another.&lt;ref&gt;Matusov, E., Bell, N., &amp; Rogoff, B. (2002). Schooling as cultural process: Shared thinking and guidance by children from schools differing in collaborative practices. In R. Kail &amp; H. W. Reese (Eds.), ''Advances in Child Development and Behavior'' (Vol. 29, pp. 129-160). New York: New York: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Conversational: Instructional dialogue is modeled after natural mundane everyday conversations.&lt;ref&gt;Echevarria, J., Silver, J., &amp; Hayward, D. (1995). ''Instructional conversations: Understanding through discussion'' (video). Santa Cruz, CA: Regents of the University of California.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Without authority: Dialogic guidance occurs among equal peers as authority distorts dialogic processes. [[Jean Piaget]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/924614460|title=Sociological studies|last=Piaget|first=Jean|last2=Smith|first2=Leslie|publisher=Routledge|year=1995|isbn=0415107806|location=London|pages=|oclc=924614460}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the first scholar who articulated this position.

==Types==
There are a number of types of dialogic pedagogy, that is, where the form and the content is recognized as "dialogic".

# IPD is understood as ''a dialogic regime of the participants' testing ideas and searching for the boundaries of personally-vested truths''.

[[File:Types of dialogic pedagogy.gif|thumb|The map of the existing dialogic pedagogy approaches]]

== Instrumental ==
[[File:Curricular endpoints.gif|thumb|Curricular space of conventional (monologically manipulative) education.]]
Instrumental dialogic pedagogy uses dialogue for achieving non-dialogic purposes, usually making students arrive at certain preset learning outcomes. For example, Nicolas Burbules defines dialogue in teaching instrumentally as facilitating new understanding, "Dialogue is an activity directed toward discovery and new understanding, which stands to improve the knowledge, insight, or sensitivity of its participants".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/751084796|title=Dialogue in teaching : theory and practice|last=Burbules|first=Nicholas C.|publisher=Teachers College, Columbia University|year=1993|isbn=0807732427|location=New York|pages=xii|oclc=751084796}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The teacher presets the endpoint of the lesson, for example, "At the end of the lesson, the students will be able to understand/master the following knowledge and skills." However, the teacher's method of leading students to the endpoint can be individualised both in instruction techniques and in time taken. Different students are "closer" or further" from the endpoint and require different strategies to get them there. Thus, for Socrates to manipulate [[Meno]] to the preset endpoint - what is virtue is not known and problematic - is not the same to manipulate Anytus to the same endpoint. It takes different and individualized instructional strategies.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Socrates,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Paulo Freire]]&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/644285558|title=Pedagogy in process: The letters to Guinea-Bissau|last=Freire|first=Paulo|publisher=Seabury Press|year=1978|isbn=0816493391|location=New York|pages=|oclc=644285558}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/807541070|title=Pedagogy of the oppressed|last=Freire|first=Paulo|publisher=Continuum|year=1986|isbn=0826400477|location=New York|pages=|oclc=807541070}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Vivian Paley]]&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/717662839|title=You can't say you can't play|last=Paley|first=Vivian Gussin|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1992|isbn=9780674965904|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=|oclc=717662839}}&lt;/ref&gt; all strongly critique the idea of preset endpoints however in practice they often set endpoints.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/883875231|title=Journey into dialogic pedagogy|last=Matusov|first=Eugene|publisher=Nova Science Publishers|year=2009|isbn=9781606925355|location=Hauppauge, NY|pages=86|oclc=883875231}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Instrumental dialogic pedagogy remains influential and important for scholars and practitioners of dialogic pedagogy field.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Some appreciate its focus on asking good questions, attendance to subjectivity, use of provocations and contradictions, and the way it disrupts familiar and unreflected relations. However, others are concerned about the teacher's manipulation of the student's consciousness and its intellectualism.{{cn|date=October 2017}}

== Non-instrumental ==
In contrast to instrumental approaches to dialogic pedagogy, non-instrumental approaches to dialogic pedagogy view dialogue not as a pathway or strategy for achieving meaning or knowledge but as the medium in which they live.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/802611350|title=Rethinking Bakhtin: Extensions and challenges.|last=Morson|first=Gary Saul|last2=Emerson|first2=Caryl|publisher=Northwestern University Press|year=1989|isbn=0810108100|location=Evanston, IL|pages=|oclc=802611350}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/260117031|title=Beyond discourse : education, the self, and dialogue|last=Sidorkin|first=Alexander M.|publisher=State Univ. of New York Press|year=1999|isbn=0791442489|location=Albany, NY|pages=|oclc=260117031}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Bakhtin, meaning is understood as living in the relationship between a genuine question seeking for information and a sincere answer aiming at addressing this question.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/898560430|title=Speech genres and other late essays|last=Bakhtin|first=Mikhail M.|publisher=University of Texas Press|year=1986|isbn=9780292775602|location=Austin, TX|pages=|oclc=898560430}}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-instrumental dialogic pedagogy focuses on "eternal damn final questions".{{cn|date=October 2017}} It is interested in the mundane only because it can give it the material and opportunity to move to the sublime. This is seen, for example, in the work of [[Christopher Phillips]].&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/792941820|title=Socrates café : a fresh taste of philosophy|last=Phillips|first=Christopher|publisher=W.W. Norton|year=2002|isbn=039332298X|location=New York|pages=|oclc=792941820}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The non-instrumental "epistemological dialogue", a term introduced by Alexander Sidorkin,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; is a purified dialogue to abstract a single main theme, a development of a main concept, and unfold the logic. According to Sidorkin,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; ontological dialogic pedagogy priorities human ontology in pedagogical dialogue:

Sociolinguist Per Linell&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/604015614|title=Approaching dialogue : talk, interaction and contexts in dialogical perspectives|last=Linell|first=Per|publisher=J. Benjamins Publishing Company|year=1998|isbn=1556198523|location=Philadelphia|pages=|oclc=604015614}}&lt;/ref&gt; and educational philosopher Alexander Sidorkin&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; evidence a non-instrumental ecological approach to dialogic pedagogy that focuses on the dialogicity&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; of the mundane everyday social interaction, its non-constrained nature, in which participants can have freedom to move in and out of the interaction, and the absence or minimum of pedagogical violence. Using the metaphor of "free-range kids", [[Lenore Skenazy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/268790698|title=Free-range kids : giving our children the freedom we had without going nuts with worry|last=Skenazy|first=Lenore|publisher=Jossey-Bass|year=2009|isbn=9780470471944|location=San Francisco|pages=|oclc=268790698}}&lt;/ref&gt; defines the participants in this ecological dialogue as free-range dialogic participants.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3769">[[File:Coat of arms of Venezuela (1871).svg|thumb|200px|[[Coat of arms of Venezuela]] in 1871 with the phrase ''Dios y Federación'']]

'''''Dios y Federación''''' ({{lang-en|God and Federation}}) is considered the traditional [[Motto|state motto]] of [[Venezuela]]. It was first used as the rallying cry of the rebel forces during the [[Federal War]], and it was subsequently incorporated into the country's [[Coat of arms of Venezuela|coat of arms]] after the conflict ended in 1863.&lt;ref&gt;Carrera, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
According to an account by historian [[José Gil Fortoul]], two [[France|French]] adventurers who had joined the forces of General [[Ezequiel Zamora]] near [[Barinas State|Barinas]] initially suggested that the customary ''...your humble servant'' &lt;ref&gt;Spanish: ''Soy de usted atento servidor''&lt;/ref&gt; [[valediction]] in written communications be replaced with ''[[Liberté, égalité, fraternité]]'', which was finally modified to ''Dios y Federación''. The phrase subsequently became emblematic of the rebel movement.&lt;ref&gt;Gallegos quoting Fortoul, p. 247&lt;/ref&gt;

After the signing of the [[Treaty of Coche]] in April 1863 and the establishment of the new government by the victorious rebels, General [[Juan Crisóstomo Falcón]] modified the official seal from 1836, replacing the word ''Liberty'' in the central ribbon with ''Dios y Federación''. The phrase would be used in subsequent redesigns of the seal until July 1930, when a decree replaced it with ''Estados Unidos de Venezuela'',&lt;ref&gt;Carrera, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; in reference to the [[First Republic of Venezuela]].

==Later use==
Although without legal basis, the phrase has been traditionally considered the country's motto, even after it was officially abandoned. Today, its significance is more political than historical, since for many people in Venezuela it represents the desire to see a return to the decentralized federal system, away from the centralist and authoritarian regimes of recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eluniversal.com/2009/03/21/opi_art_dios-y-federacion_1309192.shtml|title=Dios y Federación|last=Pino Iturrieta|first=Elías|date=March 21, 2009|publisher=El Universal|language=Spanish|accessdate=12 January 2013|location=Caracas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The motto is still featured in the coat of arms of the state of Barinas. It was part of the state flag of [[Falcón]] until 2006, and it is still used in official documents by the Judicial branch of Venezuela. ''Dios y Federación'' was also used occasionally in official communications by the government of [[Alta California]] in the 1820s.&lt;ref&gt;Hittel, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Encebollado''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''cooked with onions'') is a [[fish stew]] from [[Ecuador]], where it is regarded as a national dish. Although known throughout Ecuador, the dish is most popular in the country's coastal region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gastronomiaperu.com/noticias/detalles.php?d=2534 |title=El encebollado, un plato que evolucionó con los marineros españoles de antaño |trans-title=Encebollado, a dish that evolved with Spanish sailors of yesteryear |last=Martin |first=Herrera |date=7 October 2007 |website=Gastronomiaperu.com |language=Spanish |accessdate=16 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://recetaecuatoriana.com/2009/02/encebollado-de-pescado/|title=Receta Ecuatoriana   – Encebollado de pescado|website=Recetaecuatoriana.com|accessdate=2 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://especiales.eluniverso.com/sabor-guayaquil/platos/encebollado/] {{dead link|date=October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is served with boiled [[cassava]] and pickled red onion rings. A dressing of onion is prepared with fresh tomato and spices such as pepper or coriander leaves. It is commonly prepared with [[albacore]], but [[tuna]], [[billfish]], or [[bonito]] may also be used. It may be served with ripe avocado.

Its possible origins come from the [[Basques|Basque]] dish by the name of ''[[marmitako]]''.

Encebollado is usually served with [[Chifle|banana chips]], plantains, or bread as side dishes. It may be garnished with lime juice and chili sauce. People in Ecuador eat it for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Restaurants that sell only this dish start serving it in the early morning.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="39457">[[File:Face Negotiation Theory.jpg|thumb|Face Negotiation Theory: Face-Maintenance Framework]]
'''Face-Negotiation Theory''' was a theory first proposed by [[Penelope Brown|Brown]] and [[Stephen Levinson|Levinson]] (1978) to understand how people from different cultures manage rapport and disagreements. The theory posits "face", or self-image, as a universal phenomenon that pervades across cultures. In conflicts, one's face is threatened; and thus the person tends to save or restore his or her face. This set of communicative behaviors, according to the theory, is called "facework".  Since people frame the situated meaning of "face" and enact "facework" differently from one culture to the next, the theory poses a cultural-general framework to examine facework negotiation.

==Background==
Face-negotiation theory is primarily based on the research of Brown and Levinson. In this theory, "face" is a metaphor for self-image, which originates from two Chinese conceptualizations: lien and mien-tzu. Lien is the internal moral face that involves shame, integrity, debasement, and honor issues. Mien-tzu, on the other hand, is the external social face that involves social recognition, position, authority, influence and power.&lt;ref&gt;Hu, 1944&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ting-1998&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ting-Toomey|last2=Kurogi|title=Facework competence in intercultural conflict: An updated face-negotiation theory|journal=International Journal of Intercultural Relations|date=1998|volume=22|issue=2|pages=187–225|doi=10.1016/s0147-1767(98)00004-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Erving Goffman]] situated [[Face (sociological concept)|"face"]] in contemporary Western research and conceptualized the terms lien and mien-tzu as identity and ego..&lt;ref&gt;Goffman, 1967&lt;/ref&gt;  He noted that face is a concern for one's projected image that is both immediate and spontaneous and is tied to the dynamics of social interaction.&lt;ref&gt;Rogan &amp; Hammer, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;  Correspondingly, "facework" denotes actions taken to maintain consistency between the self and public line. Further research by Penelope Brown and [[Stephen Levinson]] on [[Politeness theory|politeness]] suggests that the desire for face is a universal concern.&lt;ref&gt;Brown &amp; Levinson, 1978&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;West, Turner &amp; Zhao, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Brown and Levinson further suggest that face can refer to two wants of the individual- the positive face that necessitates approval by others and the negative face that requires that one's actions or thoughts are unimpeded by others. Thus participants wants are of more importance than the interaction itself in face saving view of politeness. In fact, researchers Brown and Levinson posit that face is something that "is emotionally invested, and can be lost, maintained, or enhanced, and must be constantly attended to in interaction".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.604.3117&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|title=Download Limit Exceeded|website=citeseerx.ist.psu.edu|access-date=2017-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ting-Toomey expands this thinking and conceptualizes face as an individual's claimed sense of favorable social self-image in a relational and network context.&lt;ref name=Ting-1988&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ting-Toomey|authorlink1=Intercultural conflict styles: A face negotiation theory|editor1-last=Kim|editor1-first=Y.Y.|editor2-last=Gudykunst|editor2-first=W.B.|title=Theories in intercultural communication|date=1988|publisher=Sage|location=Newbury Park, CA|pages=213–238}}&lt;/ref&gt; Facework is defined as clusters of communicative behaviors that are used to enact self-face and to uphold, challenge/threaten, or support the other person's face.&lt;ref name="Ting-1998"/&gt;

With these concepts and frameworks, face-negotiation theory investigates intercultural conflict styles. The perceived or actual conflict differences revolve around three issues: content, relational, and identity.&lt;ref&gt;Wilmot &amp; Hocker, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;  Content conflict refers to the substantive issues external to the individual involved. Relational conflict refers to how individuals define, or would like to define, the particular relationship in that particular conflict episode. Identity-based conflict concerns issues of issues of identity confirmation-rejection, respect-disrespect, and approval-disapproval.&lt;ref name=Ting-2005&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ting-Toomey|authorlink1=The matrix of face: An updated face-negotiation theory|editor1-last=Gudykunst|editor1-first=W.B.|title=Theorizing about intercultural communication|date=2005|publisher=Sage|location=Newbury Park, CA|pages=71–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this way, identity issues are tided closely to culture-based face-orientation factors. A face-threatening episode is an identity expectancy violation episode. Thus, the face-negotiation theory views conflict, intercultural conflict in particular, as a situation that demands active facework management from the two interdependent conflict parties.

The theory has gone through multiple iterations since its creation. There is a 1988 version of seven assumptions and 12 propositions,&lt;ref name="Ting-1988"/&gt; a 1998 version of seven assumptions and 32 propositions,&lt;ref name=Ting-1998 /&gt; and most recent the 2005 version of seven assumptions and 24 propositions.&lt;ref name="Ting-2005"/&gt;

==Components==

===Assumptions===
Face and facework are universal phenomena.&lt;ref name=Ting-handbook&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ting-Toomey|authorlink1=Translating conflict face-negotiation theory into practice|editor1-last=Landis|editor1-first=Dan|editor2-last=Bennett|editor2-first=Janet M.|editor3-last=Bennett|editor3-first=Millton J.|title=Handbook of Intercultural Training|date=2004|publisher=Sage|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|pages=217–248}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Face-Negotiation Theory perspective stresses the impact of culture on the situated meaning of face and the enactment of facework. Thus, the theory assumes that:&lt;ref name=Ting-2005 /&gt;
#Communication in all cultures is based on maintaining and negotiating face.
#Face is problematic when identities are questioned.
#Differences in individualistic vs. collectivistic and small vs. large power distance cultures profoundly shape face management.
#Individualistic cultures prefer self oriented facework, and collectivistic cultures prefer other oriented facework.
#Small power distance cultures prefer an "individuals are equal" framework, whereas large power distance cultures prefer a hierarchical framework.
#Behavior is also influenced by cultural variances, individual, relational, and situational factors.
#Competence in intercultural communication is a culmination of knowledge and mindfulness.

===Taxonomies===
Face-negotiation theory primarily deals with five sets of themes: face orientation or concerns, face movements, facework interaction strategies, conflict communication styles, and face content domains.&lt;ref name=Ting-1998 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ting-1988 /&gt; In the 2005 version of theory, the five thematic clusters are referred as "core taxonomies".&lt;ref name=Ting-2005 /&gt;

====Face orientations====

The orientation of face determines the focus with which the face negotiator will direct her or his attention and energy of the conflict messages.&lt;ref name=Ting-2005 /&gt; Because of different concerns, caused by different underlying cultural values, face negotiators may orient towards self-face (one's own image), other face (the other conflict party's image) or mutual face (both parties' image and/or the image of the relationship).&lt;ref name=Ting-1988 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ting-Toomey, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, in [[Individualism|individualist]] cultures, such as the United States, Germany, and Great Britain, there is great value on personal rights, freedoms and the "do it yourself" attitude.  In [[Collectivism|collectivist]] cultures such as Japan, Saudi Arabia, and Colombia, more value is placed on "we" vs. "I".  The needs of the group outweigh the needs of the individual.  One-third of the world lives in an individualist society, while the other two thirds are identified with collectivist cultures.

Face orientation also involves the concept of [[Hofstede's cultural dimensions theory|power distance]].  People from large power distance cultures accept unequal power distributions, are reliant on established hierarchy, and understand that rewards and sanctions are based on social position.  People from small power distance cultures value equal power distributions, symmetric relations, and rewards and sanctions based on performance.  The United States is an example of a small power distance culture, while Japan embodies a large power distance culture.

Drawing on research of [[Geert Hofstede]], face-negotiation theory notes that while individualism and power distance are two separate dimensions, they are correlated. Highly individualistic cultures tend to be low in power distance, and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;Hofstede, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

====Face movements====

Face movement refers to the options that a negotiator faces in choosing whether to maintain, defend and/or upgrade self-face versus other-face in a conflict episode. There are four opportunities a mediator has in regards to their concern for self-face, your personal image and other-face, the counterpart's image of themselves that define face movements:
#If there is a high level of concern for both self-face and other-face, the result is mutual-face protection.
#If there is a low level of concern for both self-face and other-face, the result is mutual-face obliteration.
#If there is a high level of concern for self-face but a low level of concern for other-face, the result is self-face defense.
#If there is a high level of concern for other-face but a low level of concern for self-face, the result is other-face defense.

Ting-Toomey asserts that several conditions must be perceived as severe in order for a negotiator to feel his face is threatened; the importance of the culturally approved facework that is violated, feelings of mistrust because of a large distance between cultures, the importance of the conflict topic, the power distance between the two parties, and the perception of the parties as outgroup members are all conditions which must be made salient for face-threatening communication to occur.&lt;ref name=Ting-2005 /&gt; Whether or not a person engages in a conflict depends on how face-threatening the situation is perceived.

In an individualistic culture, the more self-face threatening the conflict, the more likely the individual will engage in an attack.  In a collectivistic culture, where mutual-face concern is important, avoidance of conflict may prevail in order for the situation to be defused. Collectivistic communicators may also require a third-party negotiation to make progress in finding a resolution.

====Facework interaction strategies====

On a broad level, individualistic cultures operate with a more direct, low-context facework with importance placed on verbal communication and nonverbal gestures for emphasis.  Collectivistic cultures operate in a more indirect, high context facework emphasizing nonverbal subtleties.  There are three prevalent facework strategies: dominating, avoiding, and integrating.  Dominating facework is characterized by trying to maintain a credible image with the goal of winning the conflict.  Avoiding facework attempts to preserve harmony in the relationship by dealing with the conflict indirectly.  Integrating facework focuses on content resolution and maintaining the relationship.&lt;ref name=Ting-2005 /&gt;

Along the face concern/orientation dimension, facework is at play before (preventative), during, and after (restorative) the situation.  Preventative facework is an attempt to minimize face-loss before the threat occurs.  Preventative strategies include credentialing, appealing for suspended judgment, pre-disclosure, pre-apology, hedging, and disclaimers.&lt;ref name="Culpach"&gt;Culpach &amp; Metts, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;  Collectivistic cultures tend to employ more preventative strategies than individualistic cultures.  Restorative facework attempts to repair face that was lost.  Restorative strategies include excuses, justifications, direct aggression, humor, physical remediation, passive aggressiveness, avoidance, and apologies.&lt;ref name="Culpach" /&gt;  Individualistic cultures are more likely to use restorative facework than collectivistic cultures.

Facework differs from conflict styles by employing face-saving strategies which can be used prior to, during, or after a conflict episode and can be used in a variety of identity-threatening and identity-protection situations.  These strategies are focused on relational and face identity beyond conflict goal issues.  Conflict styles are specific strategies used to engage or disengage from a conflict situation.  Preventative and restorative face-work strategies are typically employed when one's face is being threatened.

====Conflict communication styles====

Conflict style consists of learned behaviors developed through socialization within one's culture.  Rahim&lt;ref&gt;Rahim, 1983&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rahim, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; based his classification of conflict styles into two dimensions.  The first dimension demonstrates the concern for self, how important it is for the individual to maintain their own face or that of their culture (this is rated on a high to low continuum) and the second is concern for others, how important is it to the individual to help them maintain their own face (also rated on a high to low continuum). The two dimensions are combined to create five styles for dealing with conflict. The individual will choose a style of handling conflict based on the importance of saving their face and that of the face of the other. 
#'''Dominating''': One person's position or goal above the other.
#'''Avoiding''': Eluding the conflict topic, the conflict party, or the conflict situation altogether.
#'''Obliging''': High concern for the other person's conflict interest above a person's own interest. 
#'''Compromising''': A give-and-take concession approach in order to reach a midpoint agreement.
#'''Integrating''': A solution closure that involves high concern for one's self and high concern for the other.

In 2000 Ting-Toomey, Oetzel, and Yee-Jung incorporated three additional conflict communication styles to the original five.&lt;ref&gt;Ting-Toomey et al., 2000&lt;/ref&gt; These three have further enhanced conflict communication across cultures.

#'''Emotional Expression'''-Articulating a persons feelings in order to deal with and control conflict.
#'''Third Party Help'''-Resolving conflicts by enlisting additional help to manage communication.
#'''Passive Aggressive'''-Reacting to conflict in a roundabout way, placing blame indirectly.

Other researchers used a different way to group the conflict tactics. Ting-Toomey (1983) grouped strategies into three categories of tactics for handling conflict; integrative, distributive and passive-indirect.

Integrative conflict tactics incorporated integrating and compromising styles and is reflective of mutual-face and the need for a solution. Those who chose this tactic work with the other person involved in the conflict to get the best possible solution for both parties. Examples of Integrative tactics may include listening to the other, respecting their feelings, and providing their own personal viewpoints in a manner that assists in the negotiation.

Distributive conflict tactics use the dominating style of handling conflict, and emphasizes the individuals own power over the other. This style reflects self-face. Passive-indirect conflict tactics are consistent with obliging and avoiding styles of handling conflict and reflects other-face.

====Face content domains====

Face content domains refer to the different topics an individual will engage in facework on. Individuals have different face wants or face needs in a diverse range of communicative situations.&lt;ref name=Ting-2005 /&gt; There are six domains that an individual will operate in:
#'''Autonomy'''-represents our need for others to acknowledge our independence, self-sufficiency, privacy, boundary, nonimposition, control issues, and our consideration of other's autonomy face needs
#'''Inclusion'''-our need to be recognized as worthy companions, likeable, agreeable, pleasant, friendly, cooperative
#'''Status'''-need for others to admire our tangible and intangible assets or resources: appearance, attractiveness, reputation, position, power, and material worth
#'''Reliability'''-need for others to realize that we are trustworthy, dependable, reliable, loyal, and consistent in words and actions
#'''Competence'''-need for others to recognize our qualities or social abilities such as intelligence, skills, expertise, leadership, team-building, networking, conflict mediation, facework, and problem-solving skills
#'''Moral'''-need for others to respect our sense of integrity, dignity, honor, propriety, and morality

===Theoretical propositions===
The heart of Face Negotiation Theories are 24 propositions.  They are based on the seven assumptions and five taxonomies that have been proven in numerous cases and studies.  They describe facework on three levels of communication: cultural, individual, and situational.

''Cultural-level propositions&lt;ref name=Ting-2005 /&gt;''

#Individualistic cultures predominantly express self-face maintenance interests than collectivistic culture members do.
#Collectivistic cultures are more concerned with other-face maintenance than members of individualistic cultures.
#Members of collectivist cultures are more concerned with mutual-face maintenance than individualistic cultures.
#Members of individualistic cultures predominantly use direct and dominating facework strategies in conflict
#Collectivistic cultures tend to use avoidance strategies more than individualistic cultures do.
#Members of collectivistic cultures use more integrative facework strategies than individualistic culture members do.
#Individualistic cultures prefer dominating/competing conflict styles more than collectivistic cultures do.
#Individualistic cultures use more emotionally expressive conflict styles than collectivistic cultures do.
#Individualistic cultures use more aggressive conflict styles than members of collectivistic cultures.
#Collectivistic cultures use more avoidance techniques than members of individualistic cultures.
#Collectivistic cultures use more obliging conflict styles than members of individualistic cultures.
#Collectivistic cultures utilize compromising styles of conflict more than members of individualistic cultures.

''Individual-level propositions&lt;ref name=Ting-2005 /&gt;''

#Independent self is positively associated with self-face concern.
#Interdependent self is positively associated with other-/mutual-face concern.
#Self-face maintenance is associated with dominating/competing conflict style.
#Other-face maintenance is associated with avoiding/obliging conflict style.
#Other-face maintenance is associated with compromising/integrating conflict style.
#Independent self–construal is associated with dominating/competing conflict style.
#Interdependent self-construal is associated with obliging/avoiding.
#Interdependent self-construal is associated with compromising/integrating.
#Bi-construal is associated with compromising/integrating.
#Ambivalent is associated with neglect/third-party.

''Situational-level propositions&lt;ref name=Ting-2005 /&gt;''

#Individualist or independent-self personalities tend to express a greater degree of self-face maintenance concerns and less other-face maintenance concern in dealing with both ingroup and outgroup conflicts situations.
#Collectivist or interdependent-self personalities express a greater degree of other-face concerns with ingroup members and a greater degree of self-face maintenance concerns with outgroup members in intergroup conflict situations.

===Intercultural facework competence===
Reflecting on the final assumption, intercultural facework competence consists of another component of face-negotiation theory. 
Facework competence is conceptualized as an optimal integration of knowledge, mindfulness and communication skills in managing self's and other's face-related concerns.&lt;ref name=Ting-1998 /&gt; To act competently in an intercultural conflict episode, the theory posits that individuals have to enhance their cultural knowledge and mindfulness in applying context-sensitive facework interaction skills.

====Knowledge dimension====

Knowledge here refers to the process of in-depth understanding of  phenomenon via a range of information gained through conscious learning and personal experiences. Building block concepts include: (1) individualism-collectivism, (2) power distance. (3) two contrastive "self/face" models, and (4) facework communication styles.&lt;ref name=Ting-1998 /&gt;

====Mindfulness dimension====

Mindfulness means attending to one's internal assumptions, cognitions and emotions and simultaneously attuning attentively to the other's assumptions, cognitions and emotions while focusing the five senses.&lt;ref&gt;Thich, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; To be mindful of intercultural facework differences, we have to learn to see the unfamiliar behavior from a fresh context.&lt;ref name=Ting-handbook /&gt; Thus, on a general level, mindfulness demands creative thinking and living.

==Applications==
As an intercultural communication theory, face-negotiation theory was first tested in and applied to the field of intercultural training and conflicts. However, researchers from other areas also find this theory applicable and relevant. Recent applications and examinations of the theory include following studies.

===Intercultural conflict training===

One direct application of face-negotiation theory is the design of intercultural conflict training frameworks. Part of the objective of face-negotiation theory, according to Ting-Toomey, is in fact to translate the theory into a viable framework for mindful intercultural conflict training.&lt;ref name=Ting-handbook /&gt;

More specifically, intercultural conflict training revolves around international business negotiation, intercultural conflict mediation, managing intercultural miscommunication, and developing intercultural conflict competencies. Adapting face-negotiation theory, and also in combination with various communication researches such as Critical Incident, Intergroup Negotiation Simulation etc., Ting-Toomey designed a detailed three-day training session. Agenda outline, along with in class activities, lecture themes, and exercises, is provided in her design as well.

===Face concerns in interpersonal conflict===

This study by the author of the theory Stella Ting-Toomey and, Department of communication and Journalism at the University of New Mexico, John G. Oetzel was done in order to discover if face was indeed a factor in determining "culture's influence on conflict behavior" (Ting-Toomey &amp; Oetzel, 2003).  There were 768 people from four different countries who partook in the study. The cultures represented were China, Germany, Japan, and the United States. China and Japan representing the collectivist countries and Germany and the United States as the individualist countries. Each contributor was given a survey in which they were to explain interpersonal conflict.&lt;ref name="Ting-Toomey"&gt;Ting-Toomey &amp; Oetzel, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;
The largest findings are as follows.
#"Cultural individualism-collectivism had direct and indirect effects on conflict styles."&lt;ref name="Ting-Toomey" /&gt;
#"Independent self-construal related positively with self-face and interdependent self-construal related positively with other-face."&lt;ref name="Ting-Toomey" /&gt;
#"Self-face related positively with dominating conflict styles and other-face related positively with avoiding and integrating styles."&lt;ref name="Ting-Toomey" /&gt;
#"Face accounted for all of the total variance explained (100% of 19% total explained) in dominating, most of the total variance explained in integrating (70% of 20% total explained) when considering face concerns, cultural individualism-collectivism, and self-construals."&lt;ref name="Ting-Toomey" /&gt;

===Face and facework in conflicts with parents and siblings===

This study implemented by the author of this theory Stella Ting-Toomey, John Oetzel, Martha Idalia Chew-Sanchez, Richard Harris, Richard Wilcox, and Siegfried Stumpf observed how facework in conflict with parents and siblings is affected by culture, self-concept, and power distance. There were 449 people from four different countries and cultures that participated. Germany, Japan, Mexico, and the United States were the countries used in the study. The survey looked at 3 apprehensions of face and 11 behaviors of "facework". The results are as follows.
#"Self-construals had strong effects on face concerns and facework with independence positively associated with self-face and dominating facework and interdependence positively associated with other- and mutual-face and integrating and avoiding facework behaviors."&lt;ref name="Ting-Oetzel"&gt;Ting-Toomey, Oetzel, Chew-Sanchez, Harris, Wilcox, &amp;Stumpf, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;
#"Power distance had small, positive effects on self-face, other-face, avoiding facework, and dominating facework."&lt;ref name="Ting-Oetzel" /&gt;
#"National culture had small to medium effects with individualistic, small power distance cultures having more self-face and mutual-face and using more dominating and integrating facework and less avoiding facework."&lt;ref name="Ting-Oetzel" /&gt;
#"Germans have more self-face and used defending more than U.S. Americans."&lt;ref name="Ting-Oetzel" /&gt;
#"Japanese used more expression than Mexicans."&lt;ref name="Ting-Oetzel" /&gt;
#"Individuals in conflict with parents were more likely to use respect and expression and less likely to use aggression, pretend, and third party than individuals in conflict with siblings."&lt;ref name="Ting-Oetzel" /&gt;

===Face negotiation with mothers===

Motherhood of the Construction of "Mommy Identity" – Heisler &amp; Ellis Face Negotiation Theory suggests that, "USA culture simultaneously encourages connection and autonomy among individuals."&lt;ref&gt;Heisler &amp; Ellis, 2008, pp. 448.&lt;/ref&gt; Mothers do not want to be vulnerable so there is a "face" that is developed in the culture of mothers. Heisler and Ellis did a study on the "face" and reasons for face in motherhood. The results portrayed that the main reasons for keeping "face" in a culture of mothers are:

# Acceptance and approval: There is a fear of criticism and rejection by others. There is the avoidance face which deflects others attention. Acceptance face attracts attention.
# Personal Reasons: There are many internal pressures that mothers face. These include the guilt that they do not spend enough time with their children, insecurities and values they have are not being in met, and their self-esteem is low because of the fear of judgment.
# Mentoring/helping others: Mothers put on a face in order to appear as a good mother figure to younger mothers that look up to them. There are cultural expectations that can contribute to personal expectations for how mothers should act. Women's thoughts on mothering are not their own original ideas. They take on a lot of societal pressures. An example would be, if a mother's child acts poorly in public, it makes the mother look bad.

Motherhood and "face": Results from the same study showed that mothers participate in "Mommy face work." Depending on who they are talking to or interacting with. Mothers said to put on their highest face with friends, spouses, mothers and other family members.

===Physician communication in the operating room===
Kristin Kirschbaum applied face-negotiation theory to the [[health communication]] context, and specifically in the operating room environment.&lt;ref&gt;Kirschbaum, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In the research, a survey was administered to anesthesiologists and surgeons at a teaching hospital in the southwestern United States to measure three variables commonly associated with face-negotiation theory: conflict-management style, face concern, and self-construal.
The results strongly support the theory, and significant positive correlations were found between independent self-construal and self-face concern for anesthesiologists and surgeons. Specific to this health communication context, the research shows differences between the two groups of operating-room physicians: surgeons are potentially more other-face oriented and that anesthesiologists are potentially more independently oriented. Further, both anesthesiologists and surgeons recognize the importance of collaboration as surgical team members.

The survey also finds that specific terms were contextually inappropriate for this population, e.g. the terms pride, dignity, or credibility demonstrated a need for error correlation. This suggests unique considerations of language. Along this line of thinking, the research recommends physician communication training to address both unique language considerations and different orientations to face concern and self-construal.

===Safe sex negotiation===
Gust Yep, noticing the potential vulnerability and emotional volatility of sexual interaction, applied face-negotiation theory to the safe sex negotiation context.&lt;ref&gt;Yep, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

The study integrates various components of face-negotiation theory, and eight propositions are derived from empirical testing in intimate communication scenarios including East-West romantic dyads. The research is based on preliminary observations on personal interviews with two Asian women, aiming to predict intimate communication patterns between Asian women and Euro-American men. Specifically, low-high context and individualism-collectivism frameworks are used to draw the eight propositions.

'''&lt;big&gt;Face Saving in Business Request Emails&lt;/big&gt;'''

A study conducted on the exchange of business emails between Chinese &amp; American business associates presented how the structure of email requests affected the person's face &amp; impacted how the associates viewed the request. It was observed that direct requests in an email threatened the face of the recipient &amp; sender. It resulted in loss of face because the recipient was denied autonomy and acted in a socially unacceptable manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=1&amp;sid=8f3e42a6-3912-425a-b23f-0ea1e50e4b18@sessionmgr4009|title=Saving Face: Reactions to Cultural Norm Violations in Business Request Emai...: EBSCOhost|website=web.a.ebscohost.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Face Threat &amp; Disability ===
A research was conducted to gauge how disabled persons interact with able bodied individuals with regards to protecting one’s face and self-identity. The study considered students with not only physical disability but also disabilities not visually identifiable such as heart conditions and hearing impairment. Those with disabilities were threatened by the way others treated them and hence they chose more face-saving strategies. For instance, communication apprehension was noted in students with a hearing impairment and they reported less disclosure in the conversation. In fact, the study found that disabled students viewed asking help from able bodied individuals as a face threatening act.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com.proxy.library.georgetown.edu/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=1&amp;sid=2994eace-95ee-4ef4-836b-8bc5e3f9b6c9@sessionmgr4010|title=Off-campus Access Login|website=web.a.ebscohost.com.proxy.library.georgetown.edu|access-date=2017-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Responding to Unethical Communication ===
A research in people’s reaction to unethical communication revealed that people use Face Threatening Acts in order to counter the apprehension in communication. According to Bisel et al. (2011), ‘denying unethical communication challenges both positive and negative face of the hearer”. An expression of disapproval threatens a person’s positive face which indicates the hearer’s need for approval and it impacts the person’s negative face because it affects the person’s autonomy. 

The study put forth a research question of associating politeness strategies and unethical communication. The strategies considered were don’t’ do the face threatening act, negative politeness, positive politeness and bald on strategy. The unethical communication was classified as one that was either deceptive, manipulative, exploitative, intrusive or coercive. The ideal strategic responses have been highlighted in the figure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com.proxy.library.georgetown.edu/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=1&amp;sid=aa4d04da-073a-41a5-8b98-5e9a8ff68e7c@sessionmgr4009|title=Off-campus Access Login|website=web.a.ebscohost.com.proxy.library.georgetown.edu|access-date=2017-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Face Saving in Artwork Reviews ===
A research was conducted to study the use of face saving and face threatening acts in reviewing artwork. For the study, twelve reviews from the periodical Literatūra ir menas (Literature and Art) were randomly selected. The source for the research analysis was between 1970 -1975.

It was observed that reviewers generally had the face of the artist in mind before presenting their reviews. When presenting a negative review, reviewers threatened the positive face of the artist and hence also presented positive feedback in order to ‘save face’ of the artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com.proxy.library.georgetown.edu/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=1&amp;sid=dbcd0891-58af-4084-a3ba-49718c0532fc@sessionmgr4006|title=Off-campus Access Login|website=web.a.ebscohost.com.proxy.library.georgetown.edu|access-date=2017-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Face Concerns and the Intent to Apologize ===
A study was conducted among 317 Chinese and American participants to determine how the cultural variation between the two affected the intention to apologize. The cultural norms were categorized as the individualistic and collectivist cultures. According to Hofstede (1980), an individualistic culture lays emphasis on the identity of the “I” while collectivist cultures place more importance on the “we” and the harmony in groups. 

Apology, according to Goffman (1971), is the “offender’s device to remedy a social breach and to re-establish social harmony”. This study also took into account culture when trying to understand the intention to apologize. 

The cultural differences were more prominent especially as the intention took into account if the member (whose face was threatened by an act and thus necessities an apology) was an in-group or an out-group member. The study thus found that Chinese participants had a greater intention to apologize especially if their act threatened the positive face of the other individual. On the other hand, the U.S participants had the intention to apologize when their act threatened the negative face of the person.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com.proxy.library.georgetown.edu/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=1&amp;sid=9e9b619e-dd86-400d-a1dc-0de0aa7dd4b9@sessionmgr4007|title=Off-campus Access Login|website=web.a.ebscohost.com.proxy.library.georgetown.edu|access-date=2017-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5898">In [[sociology]], '''feminization''' is the shift in [[gender role]]s and [[sex role]]s in a society, group, or organization towards a focus upon the [[feminine]]. It can also mean the incorporation of women into a group or a profession that was once dominated by men. &lt;ref name="douglas"&gt;Ann Douglas (1977). ''The Feminization of American Culture''. Farrar, Straus and Giroux {{ISBN|0-374-52558-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Potential examples of feminization in society==
* Feminization of education – Majority female teachers, a female majority of students in higher education and a curriculum which is better suited to the learning process of women.&lt;ref&gt;Carole Leathwood, Barbara Read, 'Gender and the Changing Face of Higher Education: A Feminized Future?', Open University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-335-22714-3}}, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Feminization of the workplace — Lower paying female-dominated occupations such as; (1) food preparation, food-serving and other food-related occupations, and (2) personal care and service. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Snarr, C. Melissa. “Women's Working Poverty: Feminist and Religious Alliances in the Living Wage Movement.” Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion, vol. 27, no. 1, 2011, pp. 75–93. JSTOR, JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/10.2979/jfemistudreli.27.1.75.&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Introduction of feminization ==
Defining the term "feminization" can be complicated due to its meaning being unstable, as it can be portrayed as either a social process or as a critique of a process. Feminization has two basic meanings. The first concerns a person who was not initially feminine but becomes feminine later in their life through the perceptions of both the individual and those around them. According to gender theorist [[Judith Butler]], a person's gender is not solely an act of will or self-description, as it is also shaped by the people who describe, categorize, and treat the person according to their own perceptions of their gender. The second meaning of the term feminization describes when a person who originally had feminine qualities begins to incorporate more feminine attributes into their personality in some way, shape, or form. The term has often been used to describe females, however over time it shifted to where the term can be used to describe the process of someone or something becoming more feminine by adopting feminine qualities.&lt;ref name="Myth"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Imhoff | first = Sarah | title = The myth of American Jewish feminization | journal = Jewish Social Studies | volume = 21 | issue = 3 | pages = 126&amp;ndash;152 | publisher = [[Indiana University Press]] | doi = 10.2979/jewisocistud.21.3.05 | jstor = 10.2979/jewisocistud.21.3.05 | date = Spring–Summer 2016 | url = https://scholarworks.iu.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/2022/21871/The%20Myth%20of%20American%20Jewish%20Feminization.pdf?sequence=1 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Feminization of poverty ==
Women are more likely than men to live below the poverty line, a phenomenon known as the feminization of poverty. The 2015 poverty rates for men and women in the U.S. were 10% and 15% respectively. Women are less likely to pursue advanced degrees  and tend to have low paying jobs. It has been argued that even with the same level of education and occupational role, women earn much less than men,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/followup/session/presskit/fs1.htm|title=Beijing +5 – Women 2000: Gender Equality, Development and Peace for the 21st Century Twenty-third special session of the General Assembly, 5-9 June 2000|website=www.un.org|access-date=2017-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; although other sources have disputed the idea of a wage gap in American society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/harvard-prof.-takes-down-gender-wage-gap-myth/article/2580405|title=Harvard prof. takes down gender wage gap myth|last=Schow|first=Ashe|website=The Washington Examiner|date=January 13, 2016|accessdate=May 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Feminization of the labor force ==
Feminization of the labor force in present day associations is inescapable in that females make up half of the labor force and the revelation of them as a potential profitable asset.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.in/anisha-motwani/the-feminization-of-workp_b_8258716.html|title=Why The Feminisation Of The Workplace Is Good News For Everyone|work=Huffington Post India|access-date=2017-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Post war there has been almost a movement of women flowing into the workforce in the North America and Europe economies with women making considerable advances in balancing the workforce when comparing women and men's job status and pay rates. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/1320929|title=Feminization of the labor force : paradoxes and promises in SearchWorks catalog|website=searchworks.stanford.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Feminization and the living wage movement ==
Feminists of the modern day living wage movement began in Baltimore, Maryland in the early 1990's right in the very heart and depths of the struggling urban poor. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Around this same time, Baltimore churches became involved in providing the poor with needed social services. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Even though national prosperity and rising stock markets seemed to be showing growth, more and more full-time workers were relying on soup kitchens, low-income housing assistance, and thrift store purchases for clothing. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Their jobs did not pay enough to keep families above the poverty line. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Whole communities became known as the "working poverty."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The '''General Rules for the Interpretation of the Harmonized System''' ("GRI") are the rules that govern the classification of goods under the [[Harmonized System|Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System]] (HS). 

== Application ==

There are 6 General Rules in all, which must be applied in consecutive order.

# GRI 1 prescribes how to classify products at the 4-digit Heading level, based on the wording of the headings and the relative HS Section and Chapter Notes.
# GRI 2 prescribes how to classify both incomplete and unassembled goods, and mixtures and combinations of goods.
# GRI 3 prescribes how to classify products that are, prima facie, classifiable under two different HS headings.
# GRI 4 prescribes how to classify products that cannot be classified according to GRI’s 1, 2, and 3.
# GRI 5 prescribes how to classify packaging.
# GRI 6 prescribes how to classify products at the 6-digit subheading level, based on the wording of the subheadings and the relative HS Section and Chapter Notes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4132">[[Image:Grylan1.svg|thumb|A  rendering of a classic depiction of Grýla]]

'''Grýla''' is a mythical [[giantess]] living in the mountains of [[Iceland]]. Most of the stories told about Gryla were to frighten bad children,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icct.info/news/yuletide-brunch-and-visit-from-gryla Gryla story as retold by Icelandic Canadian Club of Toronto] Retrieved 24 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt; and her name is mentioned in [[Snorri Sturluson]]'s thirteenth century ''[[Edda]]''.

==The Christmas Monster==
Grýla was not directly linked to Christmas until the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-20799889 Five Scary Visitors in the night] Retrieved 24 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt; By that time she had become the mother of the [[Yule Lads]]. Terry Gunnell hypothesizes that the medieval custom of dressing as Grýla may be related to other visiting traditions&lt;ref&gt;''Grýla, Grýlur, Grøleks And Skeklers: Medieval Disguise Traditions in the North Atlantic'' Terry Gunnell&lt;/ref&gt; such as Julebukk or the [[Yule Goat]] and that her name may mean "threat" or "threatening".

(The earliest mention we have translating her name is [[Sverris saga]] written in the late 1100s however, where the author titles a section Grýla and explains that it means "Bugbear."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160709044321/http://northvegr.org:80/sagas%20annd%20epics/kings%20sagas/the%20saga%20of%20king%20sverri%20of%20norway/002.html Sverissaga - The Saga of King Sverri of Norway] ''"Prologue" section of the text''&lt;/ref&gt;)

She has the ability to detect children who are misbehaving year-round. During Christmas time, she comes from the mountains to search nearby towns for her meal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jol.ismennt.is/english/gryla-terry-gunnell.htm ''Grýla, Grýlur, Grøleks And Skeklers'' (Christmas in Iceland 2000)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061013092028/http://jol.ismennt.is/english/gryla-terry-gunnell.htm |date=2006-10-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She leaves her cave and hunts for the children.  She devours children as her favorite snack. Her favorite dish is a stew of naughty kids for which she has an insatiable appetite. According to legend, there is never a shortage of food for Gryla.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icelandreview.com/icelandreview/daily_news/Iceland_Ogress_Gains_Worldwide_Attention_0_395707.news.aspx Iceland Ogress Gains WorldWide Attention] Retrieved 24 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

According to folklore Grýla has been married three times.  Her third husband Leppalúði is said to be living with her in their cave in the [[Dimmuborgir]] lava fields, with the big black [[Yule Cat]] and their sons. As Christmas approaches, Grýla sets off looking for naughty boys and girls. The Grýla legend has appeared in many stories, poems, songs and plays in Iceland and sometimes Grýla dies at the end of the story.

== In popular culture ==
Grýla was featured in an article by ''[[The Onion]]'', a satirical news site, citing her as the cause of the [[2010 eruptions of Eyjafjallajökull]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theonion.com/articles/gryla-responsible-for-the-years-biggest-volcanic-e,18620/ "Grýla - Responsible For The Year's Biggest Volcanic Eruption"]. ''The Onion''. Retrieved 24 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2012, [[Stuff Monsters Like]], a satirical blog inspired by horror films, posted an article entitled "Monsters Like Holiday Stew", in which they referenced Grýla's appetite for small children.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stuffmonsterslike.com/2012/12/23/183-monsters-like-holiday-stew/ "183. Monsters Like Holiday Stew"]. Stuff Monsters Like.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|History of Western civilization}}

'''Western civilization''' describes the development of human civilization beginning in [[Ancient Greece]], and generally spreading westwards. However, [[Western culture|Western civilization]] in its more strictly defined European sphere traces its roots back to Rome and the Western [[Mediterranean]]. It can be strongly associated with nations linked to the former [[Western Roman Empire]] and with Medieval [[Western Christendom]].

From Ancient Greece sprang belief in [[democracy]], and the pursuit of intellectual inquiry into such subjects as truth and beauty; from Rome came lessons in government administration, martial organization, engineering and law; and from Ancient Israel sprang [[Christianity]] with its ideals of the brotherhood of humanity. Strong cultural contributions also emerged from the pagan [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]], [[Celts|Celtic]], [[West Slavic peoples|Wendic]], [[Finnic peoples|Finnic]], [[Baltic people|Baltic]] and [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] peoples of pre-Christian Europe. Following the 5th century [[Fall of Rome]], Europe entered the [[Middle Ages]], during which period the [[Catholic Church]] filled the power vacuum left in the West by the fallen Roman Empire, while the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] (Byzantine Empire) endured for centuries.

==Origins of the notion of "East" and "West"==
The [[East-West dichotomy|opposition of a European "West" to an Asiatic "East"]] has its roots in [[Classical Antiquity]], with the [[Persian Wars]] where the [[Classical Greece|Greek]] city states (depicted as the west) were opposing the expansion of the [[Achaemenid Empire]] (depicted as the east). The Biblical opposition of [[Land of Israel|Israel]] and [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Assyria]] from a European perspective was recast into these terms by early Christian authors such as [[Jerome]], who compared it to the [[Migration period|"barbarian" invasions]] of his own time (see also [[Assyria and Germany in Anglo-Israelism]]).

The "East" in the [[Hellenistic period]] was the [[Seleucid Empire]], with Greek influence stretching as far as [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom|Bactria]] and [[Indo-Greeks|India]], besides [[Scythia]] in the [[Pontic steppe]] to the north. In this period, there was significant cultural contact between the Mediterranean and the East, giving rise to syncretisms like [[Greco-Buddhism]]. The establishment of the [[Byzantine Empire]] around the 4th century established a political division of Europe into East and West and laid the foundations for divergent cultural directions, confirmed centuries later with the [[East–West Schism|Great Schism]] between [[Eastern Orthodox]] Christianity and [[Roman Catholic]] Christianity.

==The Mediterranean and the Ancient West==
The earliest [[civilization]]s which influenced the development of the West were those of [[Mesopotamia]], the area of the [[Tigris–Euphrates river system]], largely corresponding to modern-day Iraq, northeastern Syria, southeastern Turkey and southwestern Iran: the [[cradle of civilization]]. An [[Neolithic Revolution|agricultural revolution]] began here around 10,000 years ago with the domestication of animals like sheep and goats and the appearance of new wheat hybrids, notably [[bread wheat]], at the completion of the [[Last glacial period|last Ice Age]], which allowed for a transition from [[nomad]]ism to village settlements and then cities like [[Jericho]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jacob Bronowski]]; ''The Ascent of Man''; Angus &amp; Robertson, 1973 {{ISBN|0-563-17064-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Sumer]]ians, [[Akkadian Empire|Akkad]]ians, [[Babylonia]]ns and [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] all flourished in this region. Soon after the Sumerian civilization began, the [[Nile River]] valley of [[ancient Egypt]] was unified under the [[Pharaoh]]s in the 4th millennium BC, and civilization quickly spread through the [[Fertile Crescent]] to the eastern coast of the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and throughout the [[Levant]]. The [[Phoenicians]], [[Israelite]]s and others later built important states in this region.

The ancient peoples of the [[Mediterranean]] heavily influenced the origins of [[Western civilisation]]. The [[Mediterranean Sea]] provided reliable shipping routes linking Asia, Africa and Europe along which political and religious ideas could be traded along with raw materials such as timber, copper, tin, gold and silver as well as agricultural produce and necessities such as wine, olive oil, grain and livestock. By 3100BC, the [[Egyptians]] were employing sails on boats on the [[Nile River]] and the subsequent development of the technology, coupled with knowledge of the wind and stars allowed naval powers such as the [[Phoenicians]], Greeks, [[Carthaginians]] and Romans to navigate long distances and control large areas by commanding the sea. Cargo galleys often also employed slave oarsmen to power their ships and slavery was an important feature of the ancient Western economy.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Geoffrey Blainey; ''A Very Short History of the World''; Penguin Books, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, the great ancient capitals were linked — cities such as: [[Athens]], home to [[Athenian democracy]], and the [[Greek philosophers]] [[Aristotle]], [[Plato]] and [[Socrates]]; the city of [[Jerusalem]], the Jewish capital, where [[Jesus of Nazareth]] preached and was executed around AD 30; and the city of [[Rome]], which gave rise to the [[Roman Empire]] which encompassed much of [[Europe]] and the Mediterranean. Knowledge of Greek, Roman and Judeo-Christian influence on the development of Western civilization is well documented because it attached to literate cultures, however, Western history was also strongly influenced by less literate groups such as the Germanic, Scandinavian and Celtic peoples who lived in Western and Northern Europe beyond the borders of the Roman world. Nevertheless, the Mediterranean was the centre of power and creativity in the development of ancient Western civilisation. Around 1500 BC, metallurgists learned to smelt iron ore, and by around 800BC, iron tools and weapons were common along the [[Aegean Sea]], representing a major advance for warfare, agriculture and crafts in Greece.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

[[File:Sanzio 01 Plato Aristotle.jpg|thumb|The [[Greek philosophers]] [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] in ''[[The School of Athens]]'' by [[Raphael]].]]The earliest urban civilizations of Europe belong to the Bronze Age [[Minoan civilization|Minoans]] of Crete and [[Mycenaean Greece]], which ended around the 11th century BC as Greece entered the [[Greek Dark Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A765146-54&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ancient Greece]] was the civilization belonging to the period of [[History of Greece|Greek history]] lasting from the [[Archaic Greece|Archaic period]] of the 8th to 6th centuries BC to 146 BC and the [[Roman Republic|Roman]] conquest of Greece after the [[Battle of Corinth (146 BC)|Battle of Corinth]]. [[Classical Greece]] flourished during the 5th to 4th centuries BC. Under [[Classical Athens|Athenian]] leadership, Greece successfully repelled the military threat of [[Persian Wars|Persian invasion]] at the battles of [[Battle of Marathon|Marathon]] and [[Battle of Thermopylae|Thermopylae]]. The [[Athenian Golden Age]] ended with the defeat of Athens at the hands of [[Sparta]] in the [[Peloponnesian War]] in 404 BC.

By the 6th century BC, Greek colonists had spread far and wide — from the Russian [[Black Sea]] coast to the Spanish Mediterranean and through modern Italy, North Africa, Crete, Cyprus and Turkey. The [[Ancient Olympic Games]] are said to have begun in 776BC and grew to be a major cultural event for the citizens of the Greek diaspora, who met every four years to compete in such sporting events as running, throwing, wrestling and chariot driving. Trade flourished and by 670BC the barter economy was being replaced by a money economy, with Greeks minting coins in such places as the island of [[Aegina]]. [[Poultry]] arrived from India around 600BC and would grow to be a European staple. The [[Hippocratic Oath]], historically taken by doctors swearing to practice medicine ethically, is said to have been written by the Greek [[Hippocrates]], often regarded as the father of western medicine, in [[Ionic Greek]] (late 5th century BC),&lt;ref&gt;The Hippocratic oath: text, translation and interpretation By Ludwig Edelstein Page 56 {{ISBN|978-0-8018-0184-6}} (1943)
&lt;/ref&gt;

The Greek city states competed and warred with each other, with Athens rising to be the most impressive. Learning from the Egyptians, Athenian art and architecture shone from 520 to 420BC and the city completed the [[Parthenon]] around 447BC to house a statue of their city goddess [[Athena]]. The Athenians also experimented with [[democracy]]. Property owners assembled almost weekly to make speeches and instruct their temporary rulers: a council of 500, chosen by lot or lottery, whose members could only serve a total of 2 years in a lifetime, and a smaller, high council from whom one man was selected by lottery to preside from sunset to the following sunset.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

[[File:Tragic comic masks - roman mosaic.jpg|thumb|Tragic Comic Masks of Ancient [[Greek Theatre]] represented in the [[Hadrian's Villa]] mosaic|left]]Thus, the citizens' assembly shared power and prevented lifetime rulers from taking control. Military chiefs were exempt from the short term requirement however and were elected, rather than chosen by lot. Eloquent [[Public speaking|oratory]] became a Greek art form as speakers sought to sway large crowds of voters. Athenians believed in 'democracy' but not in equality and excluded women, slaves, the poor and foreign from the assembly. Notions of a general "brotherhood of man" were yet to emerge.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

[[Ancient Greek philosophy]] arose in the 6th century BC and continued through the Hellenistic period, at which point Ancient Greece was incorporated into the Roman Empire. It dealt with a wide variety of subjects, including [[political philosophy]], [[ethics]], [[metaphysics]], [[ontology]], [[logic]], [[biology]], [[rhetoric]], and [[aesthetics]]. [[Plato]] was a [[Classical Greece|Classical]] Greek [[philosopher]], [[mathematician]] and writer of philosophical dialogues. He was the founder of the [[Platonic Academy|Academy]] in [[Ancient Athens|Athens]] which was the first institution of higher learning in the [[Western world]]. Inspired by the admonition of his mentor, [[Socrates]], prior to his unjust execution that "the unexamined life is not worth living", Plato and his student, the [[political science|political scientist]] [[Aristotle]], helped lay the foundations of [[Western philosophy]] and science.&lt;ref name="Br"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Plato|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plato's sophistication as a writer is evident in his [[Socratic dialogues]].

In [[classics|classical]] tradition, [[Homer]] is the ancient Greek [[Epic poetry|epic]] [[poet]], author of the ''[[Iliad]]'', the ''[[Odyssey]]'' and other works. Homer's epics stand at the beginning of the [[western canon]] of literature, exerting enormous influence on the history of [[fiction]] and [[literature]] in general.

[[File:BattleofIssus333BC-mosaic-detail1.jpg|thumb|[[Alexander the Great]]]]
[[Alexander the Great]] (356BC-323BC) was a Greek king of [[Macedon]] and the creator of one of the largest empires in [[ancient history]]. He was tutored by the philosopher Aristotle and, as ruler, broke the power of Persia, overthrew the Persian king [[Darius III]] and conquered the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]].{{cref|ii}} His [[Macedonian Empire]] stretched from the [[Adriatic sea]] to the [[Indus river]]. He died in [[Babylon]] in 323&amp;nbsp;BC and his empire did not long survive his death. Nevertheless, the settlement of Greek colonists around the region had long lasting consequence and Alexander features prominently in Western history and mythology.&lt;ref&gt;Yenne, W. ''Alexander the Great: Lessons from History's Undefeated General.'' Palmgrave McMillan, 2010. 244 p.&lt;/ref&gt;

The city of [[Alexandria]] in Egypt, which bears his name and was founded in 330BC, became the successor to Athens as the intellectual cradle of the Western World. The city hosted such leading lights as the mathematician [[Euclid]] and anatomist [[Herophilus]]; constructed the great [[Library of Alexandria]]; and translated the [[Hebrew]] Bible into Greek (called the [[Septuagint]] for it was the work of 70 translators).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The ancient Greeks excelled in engineering, science, logic, politics and medicine. Classical [[Culture of Greece|Greek culture]] had a powerful influence on the Roman Empire, which carried a version of it to many parts of the [[Mediterranean region]] and Europe, for which reason Classical Greece is generally considered to be the seminal culture which provided the foundation of [[Western culture|Western civilization]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard Tarnas, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=0n2C299jeOMC&amp;lpg=PA25&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;f=false The Passion of the Western Mind]'' (New York: Ballantine Books, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Colin Hynson, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=hmweq2TyxvsC&amp;lpg=PT5&amp;pg=PT5#v=onepage&amp;f=false Ancient Greece]'' (Milwaukee: World Almanac Library, 2006), 4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carol G. Thomas, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=NAwVAAAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;f=false Paths from Ancient Greece]'' (Leiden, Netherlands: E. J. Brill, 1988).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ancient Rome]] was a civilization that grew out of a small agricultural community, founded on the [[River Tiber]], on the [[Italian Peninsula]] as early as the 10th century BC. Located along the [[Mediterranean Sea]], and centered at the city of Rome, the Roman Empire became one of the largest empires in the [[Ancient history|ancient world]].&lt;ref&gt;Chris Scarre, ''The Penguin Historical Atlas of Ancient Rome'' (London: [[Penguin Books]], 1995).&lt;/ref&gt; In its centuries of existence, Roman civilization shifted from a [[monarchy]] to an [[oligarchy|oligarchic]] [[Roman Republic|republic]] to an increasingly [[autocracy|autocratic]] [[Roman Empire|empire]]. It came to dominate [[South-Western Europe]], [[South-Eastern Europe]]/the [[Balkans]] and the [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean region]] through conquest and [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]].
[[File:Pont du Gard BLS.jpg|thumb|[[Pont du Gard]], a [[Roman aqueduct]] built {{Circa|19 BC}}|left]]

Originally ruled by Kings who ruled the settlement and a small area of land nearby, the Romans established a republic in 509BC that would last for five centuries. Initially a small number of families shared power, later representative assemblies and elected leaders ruled. Rome remained a minor power on the Italian peninsula, but found a talent for producing soldiers and sailors and, after subduing the [[Sabines]], [[Etruscans]] and [[Piceni]] began to challenge the power [[Carthage]]. By 240BC, Rome controlled the formerly Greek controlled island of [[Sicily]]. Following the 207BC defeat of the bold Carthaginian general [[Hannibal]], who had led an army spearheaded by war elephants over the Alps into Italy, the Romans were able to expand their overseas empire into North Africa. Roman engineers built arterial roads throughout their empire, beginning with the [[Appian Way]] through Italy in 312BC. Along such roads marched soldiers, merchants, slaves and citizens to all corners of a flourishing mercantile empire. Roman engineering was so formidable that roads, bridges and aqueducts survive in impressive scale and quantity to the present day. According to the historian [[Geoffrey Blainey]], the population of the Imperial capital was probably the first in the world to approach one million people. It eventually consisted of monumental public buildings, such as the [[Colosseum]] (dedicated to sport), the bathhouses (dedicated to leisure) and the [[Roman Forum]] dedicated to civic affairs. Slavery helped power the economy, but also created occasional tension — as in the slave rebellion led by [[Spartacus]] which was put down in 71BC.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
[[File:Statue-Augustus.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Augustus]], first [[Roman emperor|emperor of Rome]]]]

[[Julius Caesar]] (100BC-44BC) was a Roman [[general]] and [[politician|statesman]] who played a critical role in the gradual transformation of the Roman Republic into the Roman Empire. Conspirators who feared he was seeking to re-establish a monarchy assassinated him on the floor of the [[Roman Senate]] in 44BC. His anointed successor [[Augustus Caesar]] outmaneuvered his opponents to reign as a de facto emperor from 27BC. His successors became all-powerful and demanded veneration as gods. Rome entered its period of Imperial rule and stability (albeit often marred by occasional bouts of apparent insanity by various god-emperors) returned to the Empire.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Roman civilization and [[History of Rome|history]] contributed greatly to the development of government, law, war, art, literature, architecture, technology, [[Constantine I and Christianity|religion]], and language in the [[Western world]]. [[Ecclesiastical Latin]], the Roman Catholic Church’s official language, remains a living legacy of the classical world to the contemporary world but the Classical languages of the Ancient Mediterranean influenced every European language, imparting to each a learned vocabulary of international application. It was, for many centuries, the ''international [[lingua franca]]'' and Latin itself evolved into [[Romance languages|the Romance languages]], while Ancient Greek evolved into [[Modern Greek]]. [[Latin influence in English|Latin]] and [[English words of Greek origin|Greek continue to influence English]], not least in the specialised vocabularies of science, technology and the law.

While the historicity of these accounts is not considered precise, the stories of the Hebrew Bible have been an inspiration for vast quantities of [[Western art]], literature and scholarship.

[[File:Bloch-SermonOnTheMount.jpg|thumb|upright|Depiction of [[Jesus]]' [[Sermon on the Mount]] by [[Carl Heinrich Bloch]]]]

Around 1000BC, the Israelites had a period of power under [[King David]] who captured [[Jerusalem]]. His son [[King Solomon]] constructed the first magnificent [[Solomon's Temple|Temple at Jerusalem]] for the worship of [[Jehovah|God]]. The Jews rejected the [[polytheism]] common to that age and would worship only [[Yahweh|God]], whose [[Ten Commandments]] instructed them on how to live. These commandments remain influential in the West and prohibited theft, lying and adultery; called for worship of only one God; and for respect and honour for parents and neighbours. The Jews observed [[Shabbat|Sabbath]] as a "day of rest" (called "one of the first wide-ranging laws of social-welfare in the world" by the historian [[Geoffrey Blainey]]). In 587BC, the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]] of [[Nebuchadnezzar II]] destroyed the Temple and the Jewish leaders [[Babylonian captivity|went into exile]] to return a century later to face a succession of foreign rulers: Persian and Greek.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Judaism's texts, traditions and values play a major role in later [[Abrahamic religions]], including [[Christianity]], [[Islam]] and the [[Baha'i Faith]].&lt;ref name="oppapers1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/judaism.htm |title=Judaism page, Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance |publisher=Religioustolerance.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many aspects of Judaism have also influenced [[secular]] Western [[ethics]] and law.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;d=1356351 Jewish Contributions to Civilization: An Estimate] (book)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 63BC, [[Judea]] became part of the Roman Empire and, around 6BC [[Jesus]] was born to a Jewish family in the town of [[Nazareth]], as a consequence of which, worship of the god of Israel would come to spread through, and later dominate, the Western World.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Later the Western calendar would be divided into [[Before Christ]] (BC) (meaning before Jesus was born) and [[Anno Domini]] (AD).

[[Christianity]] [[Jewish Christians#Jewish origin of Christianity|began as a Jewish sect]] in the mid-1st century arising out of the life and teachings of [[Jesus|Jesus of Nazareth]]. The life of Jesus is recounted in the [[New Testament view on Jesus' life|New Testament]] of the [[Bible]], one of the bedrock texts of Western Civilisation.&lt;ref&gt;[[BBC]], [http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/ ''BBC—Religion &amp; Ethics—566, Christianity'']&lt;/ref&gt; According to the New Testament, Jesus was raised as the son of the Nazarenes [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] (called the "Blessed Virgin" and "Mother of God") and her husband [[Saint Joseph]] (a carpenter). Jesus' birth is commemorated in the festival of [[Christmas]]. Jesus learned the texts of the Hebrew Bible and like his contemporary [[John the Baptist]], became an influential wandering preacher. He gathered [[Twelve Disciples]] to assist in his work. He was a persuasive teller of [[parable]]s and moral philosopher. In orations such as his ''[[Sermon on the Mount]]'' and stories such as ''[[Parable of the Good Samaritan|The Good Samaritan]]'' and his declaration against hypocrisy "[[Jesus and the woman taken in adultery|Let he who is without sin cast the first stone]]", Jesus called on followers to worship God, act without violence or prejudice and care for the sick, hungry and poor. He criticized the privilege and hypocrisy of the religious establishment which drew the ire of religious and civil authorities, who persuaded the Roman Governor of the [[Iudaea Province|province of Judaea]], [[Pontius Pilate]], to have him executed for subversion. In Jerusalem, around AD 30 Jesus was [[crucified]] (nailed alive to a wooden cross) and died.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; According to the Bible, his body disappeared from his tomb three days later, because he had been [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrected from the dead]]. The festival of [[Easter]] recalls this event.

[[File:Greco, El - Sts Peter and Paul.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Saint Peter]] and [[Saint Paul]] by the artist [[El Greco]]]]
[[File:Nicaea icon.jpg|thumb|upright|Icon depicting the [[Constantine I|Roman Emperor Constantine]] (centre) and the [[bishop]]s of the [[First Council of Nicaea]] (325) holding the [[Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed|Niceno–Constantinopolitan Creed of 381]]]]

The early followers of Jesus, including [[Saint]]s [[St Paul|Paul]] and [[St Peter|Peter]] carried a new [[theology]] concerning him throughout the Roman Empire and beyond, sowing the seeds of such institutions as the [[Catholic Church]], of which Saint Peter is remembered as the first [[Pope]]. Saint Paul, in particular, emphasised the universality of the faith and the religion moved beyond the Jewish population of the Empire and [[Asia Minor]]. Later Jesus was called "Christ" (meaning "anointed one" in Greek), and thus his followers became known as ''Christians''. Christians often [[Persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire|faced persecution]] from authorities or antagonistic populations during these early centuries, particularly for their refusal to join in [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|worshiping the emperors]]. The Emperor [[Nero]] famously blamed them for the [[Great Fire of Rome]] in AD 64 and condemned them to ''[[Damnatio ad bestias]]'', a form of capital punishment in which people were maimed to death by animals in the circus arena.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Nevertheless, carried through the synagogues, merchants and missionaries across the known world, the new religion quickly grew in size and influence. [[Emperor Constantine]]'s [[Edict of Milan]] in AD 313 ended the persecutions and his own conversion to Christianity was a significant turning point in history.&lt;ref&gt;Religion in the Roman Empire, Wiley-Blackwell, by James B. Rives, page 196&lt;/ref&gt; In AD 325, Constantine conferred the [[First Council of Nicaea]] to gain consensus and unity within Christianity, with a view to establishing it as the religion of the Empire. The council composed the [[Nicean Creed]] which outlined a profession of the Christian faith. Constantine instigated Sunday as [[Christian Sabbath|Sabbath]] and "day of rest" for Roman society (though initially this was only for urban dwellers).

The population and wealth of the Roman Empire had been shifting east, and the division of Europe into a Western (Latin) and an Eastern (Greek) part was prefigured in the division of the Empire by the Emperor [[Diocletian]] in AD 285. Around 330, Constantine established the city of [[Constantinople]] as a new imperial city which would be the capital of the Byzantine Empire. Possessed of mighty fortifications and architectural splendour, the city would stand for another thousand years as a "Roman Capital". The [[Hagia Sophia]] Cathedral (later converted to a [[mosque]] following the [[Fall of Constantinople]] in 1453) is one of the greatest surviving examples of [[Byzantine architecture]], with its vast dome and interior of [[mosaic]]s and [[marble]] pillars, it was so richly decorated that the [[Emperor Justinian]], the last emperor to speak Latin as a first language, is said to have proclaimed upon its completion in 562: "Solomon, I have surpassed thee!".

The city of Rome itself never regained supremacy and was [[Sack of Rome (410)|sacked by the Visigoths]] in 410 and the [[Sack of Rome (455)|Vandals in 455]]. Although cultural continuity and interchange would continue between these Eastern and Western Roman Empires, the [[history of Christianity]] and Western culture took divergent routes, with a final [[East–West Schism|Great Schism]] separating [[Roman Catholicism|Roman]] and [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern]] Christianity in 1054.

When the [[Western Roman Empire]] was starting to disintegrate, [[St Augustine]] was [[Bishop]] of [[Hippo Regius]].&lt;ref name="WDL"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/8787/ |title = Bona, Algeria |website = [[World Digital Library]] |year = 1899 |accessdate = 2013-09-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a [[Latin]]-speaking [[philosopher]] and [[theologian]] who lived in the Roman [[Africa Province]]. His writings were very influential in the development of [[Western Christianity]] and he developed the concept of the Church as a spiritual [[New Jerusalem#Christianity|City of God]] (in [[City of God (book)|a book of the same name]]), distinct from the material Earthly City.&lt;ref name="CC"&gt;{{cite book | last = Durant | first = Will | title = Caesar and Christ: a History of [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] Civilization and of Christianity from Their Beginnings to A.D. 325 | publisher = MJF Books | location = New York| year = 1992 | isbn = 1-56731-014-1 |authorlink=Will Durant}}&lt;/ref&gt; His book [[Confessions (St. Augustine)|Confessions]], which outlines his sinful youth and conversion to Christianity, is widely considered to be the first autobiography written in the canon of [[Western Literature]].

==The fall of Rome==
{{Main|Fall of the Western Roman Empire}}
In 476 the western Roman Empire, which had ruled modern-day [[Italy]], [[France]], [[Spain]], [[Portugal]] and [[England]] for centuries, collapsed due to a combination of economic decline, and drastically reduced military strength which allowed invasion by [[barbarian]] [[tribe]]s originating in southern [[Scandinavia]] and modern-day northern [[Germany]]. Historical opinion is divided as to the reasons for the fall of Rome, but the [[societal collapse]] encompassed both the gradual disintegration of the political, economic, military, and other social institutions of Rome as well as the barbarian invasions of Western Europe.

In England, several [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribes]] invaded, including the [[Angles]] and [[Saxons]]. In [[Gaul]] (modern-day France, Belgium and parts of Switzerland) and [[Germania Inferior]] (The Netherlands), the [[Franks]] settled, in [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]] the [[Visigoths]] invaded and Italy was conquered by the [[Ostrogoths]].

The slow decline of the Western Empire occurred over a period of roughly three centuries, culminating in 476, when [[Romulus Augustus]], the last [[Roman Emperors|Emperor]] of the Western Roman Empire, was deposed by [[Odoacer]], a Germanic chieftain. Some modern historians question the significance of this date,&lt;ref&gt;Arnaldo Momigliano, echoing the trope of the sound a tree falling in the forest, titled an article in 1973, "La caduta senza rumore di un impero nel 476 d.C." ("The noiseless fall of an empire in AD 476").&lt;/ref&gt; and not simply because [[Julius Nepos]], the legitimate emperor recognized by the East Roman Empire, continued to live in [[Salona]], [[Dalmatia]], until he was assassinated in 480. More importantly, the [[Ostrogoths]] who succeeded considered themselves upholders of the direct line of Roman traditions and, as the historian [[Edward Gibbon]] noted, the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] continued until the [[Fall of Constantinople]] on May 29, 1453.

''Homestuck'' begins when thirteen-year-old [[List of Homestuck characters#John Egbert|John Egbert]] receives a beta copy of an upcoming computer game, ''Sburb'', in the mail. Installing and running the game on his computer triggers a [[meteor shower|meteor storm]] to fall on his house in real life, which he survives only by being transported to a planet in another dimension known as the Incipisphere. As John's friends [[List of Homestuck characters#Rose Lalonde|Rose Lalonde]], [[List of Homestuck characters#Dave Strider|Dave Strider]], and [[List of Homestuck characters#Jade Harley|Jade Harley]] join him in the game, they learn that they have unwittingly triggered the destruction of Earth, and that it is their duty to play the game to create a new universe.

As they begin to explore the world of ''Sburb'', John and his friends are harassed by a group of twelve [[Internet troll]]s who have played a version of the game before. Further contact with the trolls reveals that they are not human at all, but an alien species actually called "trolls". As the trolls gradually become more important to the story, the narrative shifts to a side [[story arc]] exploring the nature of troll society and the specific sequence of events that led to this group to enter the troll version of ''Sburb''. The trolls' arc concludes with them winning their game and originally creating the humans' universe.

As the story returns to focus on the humans, the two species start to cooperate to salvage the kids' doomed game session. As the kids' actions accidentally bring about an unbeatable enemy called Jack Noir, they learn about a game mechanism called the "scratch" with which the humans can reset their session.

By executing the Scratch, the kids create a reset version of their universe, in which their places have been swapped with those of their ancestors. As a result, John's grandmother, Jane Crocker, who had died before the story began, is fifteen years old and the protagonist of the new arc. She leads her three friends Roxy Lalonde, Dirk Strider, and Jake English — the mother, brother, and grandfather of Rose, Dave, and Jade, respectively — through their own session of the game, while the original humans and surviving trolls journey to the new session over the course of three years.

Upon uniting in the new session, the kids and trolls enact a plan to finally create a new universe and to defeat Lord English, a purportedly-invincible villain threatening all of reality. Their plan is opposed by the Condesce, the sinister former empress of the trolls now in service to Lord English, as well as the still-dangerous Jack Noir who also escaped from the original doomed session. Matters complicate further as John develops new powers allowing him to [[Retroactive continuity|retcon]] previous events within the ''Homestuck'' narrative.

The plan fails, and only John, Roxy, and one of the trolls, [[List of Homestuck characters#Terezi Pyrope|Terezi]], survive. Under Terezi's guidance, John retcons key events in the narrative, preventing events leading to the plan's failure from occurring. In the retconned narrative, the kids and trolls defeat the Condesce and Jack Noir and create the new universe. The comic ends with Lord English facing off against an army of ghosts and with the kids and trolls about to enter the newly created universe. Illustrations in the closing credits feature [[Snapchat]] stories of the kids in their roles as rulers of a new universe, the last of which involves twenty-year-old John smashing his phone's screen with a hammer in response to a Snapchat from the adolescent Lord English.

==Style and development==
The basic premise of the comic has been described as inspired by games like ''[[The Sims]]'', ''[[Spore (2008 video game)|Spore]]'' and ''[[EarthBound]]''.&lt;ref name="McGown"&gt;{{cite web |last=McGown |first=Justin |title=Homestuck fans prepare for webcomic release |work=[[The Tartan]] |publisher=[[Carnegie Mellon]] |date=October 17, 2011 |url=http://thetartan.org/2011/10/17/pillbox/comics |accessdate=October 23, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Inside the strange, brave new world of Homestuck |first=Lauren Rae |last=Orsini |url=http://www.dailydot.com/society/inside-webcomic-homestuck-guide-interviews/ |newspaper=[[The Daily Dot]] |date=August 2, 2012 |accessdate=January 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As in Hussie's prior webcomic ''[[MS Paint Adventures#Problem Sleuth|Problem Sleuth]]'', the adventure is characterized by [[time travel]], mystery, a complex fictional universe, and frequent references to pop culture and previous adventures. Changes from previous stories include an emphasis on contemporary society, such as [[Online game|online gaming]] and [[Internet culture]], which contrasts with the historical settings of ''MS Paint Adventures'' comics ''Bard Quest'' and ''Problem Sleuth''.&lt;ref name="Meeks"&gt;{{cite web | last = Meeks | first = Elijah | title = Interview with Andrew Hussie, Creator of Homestuck | work = Digital Humanities Specialist | publisher = Stanford University Libraries &amp; Academic Information Resources | date = December 3, 2010 | url = https://dhs.stanford.edu/social-media-literacy/interview-with-andrew-hussie-creator-of-homestuck/ | accessdate = April 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, this adventure introduced complex [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] animations and Flash and [[HTML5]] games, many making use of music and assets contributed by other artists.&lt;ref name="Beta"&gt;{{cite news |title=A Noob’s Guide to Homestuck, the Favorite Webcomic of Internetty Teens Everywhere |first=Jessica |last=Roy |url=http://betabeat.com/2012/09/a-noobs-guide-to-homestuck-the-favorite-webcomic-of-internetty-teens-everywhere/ |newspaper=[[Betabeat]] |date=September 10, 2012 |accessdate=September 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This represented a step-up from previous adventures which exclusively used [[GIF]] images for animation.&lt;ref name="Kotaku"&gt;{{cite web |last=Baio |first=Andy |title=Arcade Improv: Humans Pretending to Be Videogames |work=[[Kotaku]] |date=November 9, 2011 |url=http://kotaku.com/5858062/arcade-improv-humans-pretending-to-be-videogames |accessdate=November 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial style of the webcomic was developed to be advanced by fan contributions, with the fans deciding what actions the characters would take. However, once the fan base had grown significantly by 2010.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} Hussie moved away from this style because the fan input method had grown "too unwieldy and made it difficult ... to tell a coherent story." While Hussie now controlled the main plot of the story and the characters' actions, he still "visit[ed] fan [[blog]]s and [[Internet forum|forums]]" to figure out small things to add into ''Homestuck''.&lt;ref name="Faircloth"&gt;{{cite news |title=Stuck on Homestuck: How Andrew Hussie Turned a Tumblr Craze Into a Teenage Empire |first=Kelly |last=Faircloth |url=http://betabeat.com/2012/10/tumblr-andrew-hussie-homestuck-kickstarter-game-adventure-text-teens-young-adult/|publisher=[[The New York Observer]] |newspaper=Betabeat |date=October 3, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121005192003/http://betabeat.com/2012/10/tumblr-andrew-hussie-homestuck-kickstarter-game-adventure-text-teens-young-adult|archive-date=October 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hussie first launched an early version of ''Homestuck'', the ''Homestuck'' Beta, on April 10, 2009.{{r|O'Malley}} The ''Homestuck'' Beta was made using Flash and ran from April 10–12.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Homestuck BETA |url=http://www.mspaintadventures.com:80/?s=5 |website=MS Paint Adventures |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210155027/http://www.mspaintadventures.com:80/?s=5 |archivedate=2015-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Adventure Log |url=http://www.mspaintadventures.com:80/?viewlog=5 |website=MS Paint Adventures |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100407210413/http://www.mspaintadventures.com:80/?viewlog=5 |archivedate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Homestuck BETA |url=https://www.homestuck.com/beta |website=homestuck.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pauses ===
Although the majority of ''Homestuck'' was posted serially, with pages irregularly added over the course of each day, Hussie decided in 2013 to add the final acts in one update. He named the time period he was taking to finish the story a "Gigapause". Hussie explained that he wanted to have the ability to tell the remainder of the story in a [[Nonlinear narrative|nonlinear fashion]] by writing and illustrating the storyline and then revising the chronology.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} Various large pauses have happened since.
* On October 16, 2013, the "Gigapause" began.&lt;ref name="Hussie 2013"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mspaintadventures.com/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019164429/http://www.mspaintadventures.com/ |archivedate=October 19, 2013 |title=Gigapause: Commence |date=October 17, 2013 |first=Andrew |last=Hussie |publisher=MS Paint Adventures |accessdate=October 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hussie announced that the hiatus had almost reached its conclusion on September 27, 2014, although he had not fully completed the story.&lt;ref name="Hussie 2014"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mspaintadventures.com/ |title=Giga-Almost-Unpause, Probably. |date=September 27, 2014 |first=Andrew |last=Hussie |publisher=MS Paint Adventures |accessdate=October 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 16, 2014, ''Homestuck'' "Gigaunpaused", and server crashes occurred as a multitude of fans visited the site.&lt;ref name="Atlantic"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/02/a-story-that-could-only-be-told-online/385895/|publisher=''The Atlantic''|title=A Story That Could Only Be Told Online|last=Min|first=Lilian|date=February 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On January 19, 2015, Hussie announced another pause, which lasted until April 13, 2015. Though officially unnamed, Hussie humorously offered "Minigigapause", "Megapause 2: Back in the Megasaddle", and "Microterapause" as possible titles.&lt;ref name="Hussie 2015"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mspaintadventures.com/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150120122800/http://mspaintadventures.com/ |archivedate=January 20, 2015 |title=Minigigapause |date=January 19, 2015 |first=Andrew |last=Hussie |publisher=MS Paint Adventures |accessdate=November 4, 2015 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On August 12, 2015, Hussie announced the "Omegapause", stating, "It will be done when it's done. As for when that is, I don't have any concrete projections. Maybe it will all drop some time next year? ... I guess we will have to wait and see."&lt;ref name="Hussie 2015.2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mspaintadventures.com/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150813122600/http://www.mspaintadventures.com/ |archivedate=August 13, 2015 |title=Omegapause |date=August 12, 2015 |first=Andrew |last=Hussie |publisher=MS Paint Adventures |accessdate=November 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This pause lasted until March 28, 2016.&lt;ref name="Hussie 2016"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mspaintadventures.com/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160329033046/http://www.mspaintadventures.com/ |archivedate=March 29, 2016 |title=EOA6 - 99% |date=March 28, 2016 |first=Andrew |last=Hussie |publisher=MS Paint Adventures |accessdate=March 29, 2016 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 13, 2016 — exactly seven years after ''Homestuck'' began — Hussie released the final chapter of the webcomic: a nine-minute-long animated short titled "[S] ACT 7". Hussie stated that an [[epilogue]] to the webcomic may be released at some point in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicsbeat.com/homestuck-ends-its-seven-year-run-with-a-nine-minute-cartoon/|publisher=''Comics Beat''|title=Homestuck ends its seven-year run with a nine-minute cartoon|last=MacDonald|first=Heidi|author-link=Heidi MacDonald|date=April 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/14/webcomic-homestuck-ends-7-year-run|publisher=''[[IGN]]''|title=Webcomic Homestuck Ends 7 Year Run|last=Macy|first=Seth G.|date=April 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 25, 2016, the comic updated with a [[Closing credits|credit sequence]] and more panels in the form of a [[Snapchat]] story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=010029|title=MS Paint Adventures |date=October 17, 2013 |first=Andrew |last=Hussie |publisher=MS Paint Adventures |accessdate=November 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Side projects ==
A significant amount of merchandise has been sold through Hussie's shop, company, and record label What Pumpkin, including "T-shirts, hoodies, pins, books" and fan art prints. Fans have also been "recruited" to make music for the webcomic. The [[Music of Homestuck|music has been bundled into albums]], with ten major soundtrack albums having been released thus far, in addition to eighteen side albums.&lt;ref name="Faircloth"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Behind the wonderful and weird soundtrack to Homestuck |first=Lauren Rae |last=Orsini |url=http://www.dailydot.com/culture/homestuck-music-clark-powell/ |newspaper=[[The Daily Dot]] |date=September 3, 2012 |accessdate=September 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 13, 2014, the fifth anniversary of ''Homestuck'', ''Paradox Space'', an anthology spin-off webcomic, was launched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://robot6.comicbookresources.com/2014/06/paradox-space-homestuck-outsourced/|publisher=''[[Comic Book Resources]]''|title=‘Paradox Space': ‘Homestuck’ outsourced|last=Cruz|first=Larry|date=June 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Sweet Bro and Hella Jeff'' ===
Early in ''Homestuck'', Hussie introduced a webcomic contained within the main story titled ''Sweet Bro and Hella Jeff''. The webcomic, drawn within ''Homestuck'' by character Dave Strider, is intentionally poorly made.&lt;ref name="Cruz 2014"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://robot6.comicbookresources.com/2014/09/the-ironic-awfulness-off-sweet-bro-and-hella-jeff/ |title=The ironic awfulness off ‘Sweet Bro and Hella Jeff’ |date=September 19, 2014 |first=Larry |last=Cruz |publisher=''Comic Book Resources'' |work=Robot 6 |accessdate=October 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The comic strips have become independent of ''Homestuck'': a mockup of the website on which Dave Strider hosts the comic [http://www.mspaintadventures.com/sweetbroandhellajeff/ is available on the MSPaintAdventures website]. [[TopatoCo]] produced a print publication collecting the strips. The press release from TopatoCo described ''Sweet Bro and Hella Jeff'' as "the worst comic strip ever".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Sweet Bro and Hella Jeff Hardcover PRESS RELEASE |url=http://topatoco.tumblr.com/post/41062657345/sweet-bro-and-hella-jeff-hardcover-press-release |location= Easthampton, Massachusetts |publisher=TopatoCo |date=January 20, 2013 |accessdate=November 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, TopatoCo announced a second ''Sweet Bro and Hella Jeff'' book, co-written by [[Dril]], co-drawn by [[KC Green]], and funded through [[Kickstarter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |author=Holly Rowland |title=Sweet Bro and Hella Jeff and the Quest for the Missing Spoon |url=http://makethatthing.com/sweetbro/|publisher=TopatoCo |date=November 16, 2017 |accessdate=December 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Video game ===
{{main article|Hiveswap}}
On September 4, 2012, Hussie announced a Kickstarter to raise funds to develop a ''Homestuck'' video game with a (then-unannounced) game studio (later revealed to be [[The Odd Gentlemen]]).&lt;ref name=Kickstarter&gt;{{cite web|title=Homestuck Adventure Game|url=http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/14293468/homestuck-adventure-game?ref=discover_rec|work=MS Paint Adventures|publisher=[[Kickstarter]]|accessdate=September 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TheOddGentlemen"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oddgentlemen.tumblr.com/post/89512388164/the-odd-gentlemen-are-making-the-homestuck-game |title=The Odd Gentlemen are making the Homestuck Game |publisher=The Odd Gentlemen |date=June 21, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140913075838/http://blog.theoddgentlemen.com/post/89512388164/the-odd-gentlemen-are-making-the-homestuck-game |archivedate=September 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Development began in 2013, with the finished product expected in 2014.

This interest in the webcomic led to a friendship with Andrew Hussie and resulted in the creation of a new character, Rufioh, with Basco's "typing quirks and personality".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=From Homestuck to Hollywood, actor Dante Basco breaks the mold |first=Aja |last=Romano |url=http://www.dailydot.com/entertainment/dante-basco-hang-loose-homestuck-interview/ |newspaper=[[The Daily Dot]] |date=December 21, 2012 |accessdate=January 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a temporary hiatus was announced in early July 2012, fans of the webcomic began creating a multitude of fake [[screenshot]]s of a fictional [[anime|anime version]] of ''Homestuck'', with some including subtitles and [[Digital on-screen graphic|logos]] of various Japanese TV channels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Diehard Webcomic Fans Invent Fake Anime |author=John Funk |url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/118313-Diehard-Webcomic-Fans-Invent-Fake-Anime |newspaper=[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]] |date=July 6, 2012 |accessdate=July 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and impact==
Lauren Rae Orsini, in an interview with Andrew Hussie, asked Hussie whether, because of the immense size of ''Homestuck'' and its fandom, with more than 5,000 pages and 128 characters, Hussie considered himself in control of the comic. Hussie responded that he felt ''Homestuck'' was "still under my control", but that the background of ''Homestuck'' as a movement "is not under my control, and never really was."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Behind Andrew Hussie' Homestuck Adventure Game |author=Lauren Rae Orsini |url=http://www.dailydot.com/entertainment/homestuck-andrew-hussie-interview/ |newspaper=[[The Daily Dot]] |date=September 7, 2012 |accessdate=September 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Orsini also suggested, in a separate article, that the effort put forward by people who finish ''Homestuck'' is an example of [[effort justification]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Is Homestuck the "Ulysses" of the Internet? |author=Lauren Rae Orsini |url=http://www.dailydot.com/culture/homestuck-ulysses-james-joyce-internet/ |newspaper=[[The Daily Dot]] |date=September 6, 2012 |accessdate=September 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Homestuck'' was compared to [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' by [[PBS]]' Idea Channel due to the webcomic's length and complexity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Is Homestuck the Ulysses of the Internet? |author=Mike Rugnetta |url=https://pbslearningmedia.org/resource/e34478cb-854d-483e-a99c-dbceed3e9623/is-homestuck-the-ulysses-of-the-internet/ |newspaper=[[PBS]] Idea Channel |date=September 5, 2012 |accessdate=September 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lori Henderson of the ''[[School Library Journal]]'' described ''Homestuck'' as being "mostly black and white with splashes of color and a minimal amount of animation", but said that it worked for the webcomic, and that because the "characters are a little goofy-looking and are often shown without arms", it only "adds to the charm".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=A Mom’s Adventures in Homestuck Part 1 |author=Lori Henderson |url=http://blog.schoollibraryjournal.com/goodcomicsforkids/2012/09/11/a-moms-adventures-in-homestuck-part-1/ |newspaper=[[School Library Journal]] |date=September 11, 2012 |accessdate=September 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mordicai Knode of [[Tor Books]] explained that ''Homestuck'' has to be discussed separately between what it is as a webcomic and what its plot actually is. Comparing it to [[hypertext fiction]] and the genre's attempted use in physical novels like ''[[Pale Fire]]'' and ''[[House of Leaves]]'', Knode concluded that "''Homestuck'' is the first great work of genuinely hypertext fiction. If that puts it in the same breath as ''Ulysses'', then so be it."&lt;ref name="Knode" /&gt;

[[Bryan Lee O'Malley]], creator of the graphic novel series ''[[Scott Pilgrim]]'', described ''Homestuck'' as a "massive undertaking of deftly-handled long-term serialized storytelling. It's well-written and thoughtful. It has things to say".&lt;ref name="O'Malley"&gt;{{cite news|title='Scott Pilgrim' Guy Interviews 'Homestuck' Guy: Bryan Lee O'Malley On Andrew Hussie |author=[[Bryan Lee O'Malley]] |url=http://www.comicsalliance.com/2012/10/02/homestuck-interview-andrew-hussie-bryan-lee-omalley-ms-paint-adventures/ |newspaper=Comics Alliance |date=October 2, 2012 |accessdate=October 6, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130308091741/http://www.comicsalliance.com/2012/10/02/homestuck-interview-andrew-hussie-bryan-lee-omalley-ms-paint-adventures/ |archivedate=March 8, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Born in [[Vernon, Utah]], Bennion received her B.A. in Anthropology at the [[Utah State University]], an M.A. in Social Organization at [[Portland State University]], and her Ph.D. in Cultural Anthropology at the [[University of Utah]]. She splits her time between her home in Vermont and a cabin in the [[Beartooth Mountains]] of [[Montana]].

In 1994, Bennion received a Dean’s Scholarship Award for her ethnography, published by [[Oxford University Press]], ''Women of Principle: Female Networking in Contemporary Mormon Polygyny''. At the time of book's publication, Bennion was an assistant professor of anthropology at the [[Utah Valley University]]. With her appointment to Lyndon State College, in Northeast Vermont, she received the Vermont Women in Higher Education Scholarship and the Carol E. Moore Merit Award. Most recently, she was recognized as an individual of distinction for her latest comprehensive look at polygamy, ''Polygamy in Primetime'', published in 2012 with [[Brandeis University Press]]. The book covers twenty years of ethnographic work, examining the variability within fundamentalist polygamist societies in the [[Intermountain West]].

==Professional work==

Until the last decade, North American polygamy was seriously examined by only a handful of scholars, including Bennion. In her first book, ''Women of Principle'', she recorded the experiences of female converts in the [[Apostolic United Brethren|Montana Allredite order]], finding that many women are attracted to polygamy because of the socioeconomic support it offers, replacing a rather difficult life in the mainstream where their status as divorcees, single mothers, widows, and "unmarriageables" limited their access to good men and the economic and spiritual affirmation that comes from a community of worship.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author1= KJ Anderson |author2= Janet Bennion |title= Women of Principle |journal= [[Utopian Studies]] |volume= 11 |issue= 2 |year= 2000 |url= |jstor= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to using polygamy as a tool for marginalized women to marry and improve their social standing, she found that women in some communities hold positions of religious or political power in the community, often exercising considerable independent power. They can raise their children with minimal oversight by their husband, manage their household, and work in the all-important female support networks. Finally, [[Mormon fundamentalism]] balances the deprivations and difficulties of the lives of polygamous wives with a promise of an afterlife as queens and priestesses. In ''Desert Patriarchy'', Bennion examines the lives of women in the [[Church of the Firstborn of the Fulness of Times|LeBaron polygamous group]], located in northern [[Mexico]], where she finds an interplay of the desert and the unique social traditions and gender dynamics embedded in Anglo patriarchal fundamentalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Mark Metzler |last=Sawin  |url=https://byustudies.byu.edu/showtitle.aspx?title=7498 |title=Desert Patriarchy: Mormon and Mennonite Communities in the Chihuahua Valley, by Janet Bennion |journal=[[BYU Studies]] |volume=44 |issue=2 |year=2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022041028/https://byustudies.byu.edu/showtitle.aspx?title=7498 |archivedate=2013-10-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bennion identifies the variability in all four major polygamous movements in the West in her latest volume, ''Polygamy in Primetime'' (2012), finding that some Mormon women experience more individual satisfaction within the dynamics of a polygamous family than they could in any other marital form. ''Polygamy in Primetime'' responds to [polygamy’s] new visibility [in the media] with an overview of the subject that, despite occasional academic language, will appeal to general readers seeking more details than the soap operatics of ''Big Love'' can provide.&lt;ref name=Harrison&gt;{{cite news |first= Margot |last= Harrison |date= November 14, 2012 |title= Love Plus |url= http://www.7dvt.com/2012love-plus |newspaper= [[Seven Days (newspaper)|Seven Days]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her early work, she produced the first ethnography of modern-day Mormon polygyny in her masters' thesis. For her dissertation, she explored the factors contributing to female conversion patterns and investigating the intimacies between co-wives in the holy wedding ceremony which bonds women to each other and to one man. She also contributed to several chapters in books. Her examination of the atrocities following the [[Texas]] raid on the [[YFZ Ranch]], where 460 children were removed from their homes is found in Cardell Jacobson's anthology and in her Mellen book. Her analysis of O'Dea's shortcomings in evaluating the experiences of women can be found in another of Cardell Jacobson's works. Bennion also evaluating the factors causing [[Sexual assault|sexual molestation]] among Mormon polygynists in an Oxford work.

'''Kiehl's LLC''' is an American [[cosmetics]] brand retailer that specializes in premium skin, hair, and body care products. It started as a single [[pharmacy]] in [[Manhattan]] at [[Third Avenue]] and [[List of numbered streets in Manhattan#10th to 13th Streets|East 13th Street]] in 1851. Kiehl's was purchased by the [[L'Oréal Group]] in 2000 and currently has more than 250 retail stores worldwide, and over 1,000 points of sale supplemented by sales in high-end [[department store]]s, select airport locations, as well as independent stockists. In contrast to its market competitors, Kiehl's is distinguished for its unorthodox marketing approach, exceptionally large male clientele base, and its products' simple and straightforward packaging &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://imthemoisturizer.com/review-kiehls-facial-fuel-energizing-moisture-treatment-for-men |title=Review: Kiehl's Facial Fuel Energizing Moisture Treatment for Men |publisher=The Moisturizer |accessdate=21 November 2018 |date=5 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==History==
===Foundation===
[[File:Pear Tree Corner Circa 1900.jpg|thumb|The corner of Third and East 13th Street, known as "Pear Tree Corner," in what is now the [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]] of Manhattan circa 1900, where Kiehl's has been located since its founding in 1851.]]
[[File:Klaus Heidegger and Jami Morse Heidegger.jpg|thumb|Co-presidents [[Klaus Heidegger]] and Jami Morse Heidegger in 2014.]]
Founded in 1851 by John Kiehl, Kiehl's began as a [[Homeopathy|homeopathic]] pharmacy located at [[Third Avenue|3rd Avenue]] and 13th Street in the East Village of New York City. In 1921, Irving Morse, a former apprentice and [[Russian Jewish]] émigré who had studied [[pharmacology]] at [[Columbia University]], purchased the store. Morse was involved in the development of many Kiehl's products that are still popular today, including Blue Astringent Herbal Lotion and Creme de Corps.&lt;ref name="shopper"&gt;{{cite news |title=Critical Shopper; Grand Old Apothecary, Version 2.0  |author=Mike Albo |newspaper=The New York Times |date=18 January 2007 | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9904EFDC1130F93BA25752C0A9619C8B63}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="obit"&gt;{{cite news |title=Neighborhood Report: East Side; Farewell To the Man Behind Kiehl's |author=Monte Williams |newspaper=The New York Times |date=7 May 1995 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/07/nyregion/neighborhood-report-east-side-farewell-to-the-man-behind-kiehl-s.html?scp=16&amp;sq=kiehl%27s&amp;st=cse }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Irving's son, Aaron Morse, who also studied [[pharmacology]] at [[Columbia University]] and was a former [[World War II]] pilot,{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} took over the store in the 1960s. The younger Morse was credited for propelling Kiehl's from obscurity in the 1950s to international recognition as an upscale natural cosmetics shop in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="shopper"/&gt;&lt;ref name="obit"/&gt; Aaron transitioned the store from the traditional pharmaceuticals his father preferred to develop skin care lines. After he died in 1995, his desk and some of his vintage motorcycles were prominently showcased in the store.&lt;ref name="obit"/&gt;

By then, Aaron's daughter, Jami Morse Heidegger, had been operating the business since 1988. Described as "a clever marketer," she relied on [[Word of mouth#Word-of-mouth marketing|word of mouth]] and extensive free samples and gifts to market Kiehl's products, rather than traditional advertising.&lt;ref name="shopper"/&gt;

===Acquisition by L'Oréal===
In April 2000, the [[Economy of France|French]] beauty and cosmetics company [[L'Oréal]] acquired Kiehl's for between $100–$150 million. L'Oréal had pursued the purchase of the company for more than two years but the real catalyst for a deal came when Kiehl's had difficulty handling the growing volume of orders due to the company's growing popularity. Morse Heidegger, then president of Kiehl's, said, "We took a long hard look at the situation, and we felt that in order to keep up with the demand, in order to not be out of stock, in order to fulfill our destiny, if you will, we needed to take on a partner."&lt;ref name="acquisition"&gt;{{cite news |title=Kiehl's Cosmetics Company Bought by France's L'Oreal |author=Constance L.

With the purchase, L'Oréal stated it planned "to increase the brand's presence but maintain it as a luxury line rather than a mass-market one." Kiehl's would also be expanded internationally.&lt;ref name="acquisition"/&gt; At the same time, Kiehl's newly appointed president Michelle Taylor said, "The thing most important to me is to keep Kiehl's true to what it is. Respect for old-fashioned values is really who we are."&lt;ref name="counter"&gt;{{cite news |title= Counterintelligence; New Owners Let Kiehl's Be Kiehl's |author=Alex Witchel |newspaper=The New York Times |date=12 August 2001 |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2001/08/12/style/counterintelligence-new-owners-let-kiehl-s-be-kiehl-s.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upshaw writes, "The Kiehl's way of 'selling' is not to sell at all… They believe the products will do what they do and no hype will change that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Truth: The New Rules for Marketing in a Skeptical World |last=Upshaw |first=Lynn B. |year=2007 |publisher=AMACOM  |location=New York, NY |isbn= 978-0-8144-7376-4 |page=48 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=dNXULFZSK8MC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA48 |accessdate=23 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Donations, most prominently in charity event gift bags, also attract customers.&lt;ref name="counter"/&gt;

Allan Mottus, the editor of the cosmetics industry magazine ''[[The Informationist]]''[[The Informationist|,]] stated, "The Kiehl's store always attracted a cutting-edge younger-crowd."&lt;ref name="counter"/&gt; Compared to other cosmetics stores, Kiehl's is also known for appealing to an exceptionally large male clientele, which represents 30 to 40 percent of the company's customer base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Truth: The New Rules for Marketing in a Skeptical World |last=Upshaw |page=49 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=dNXULFZSK8MC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA49 |accessdate=23 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In cities like New York and [[Los Angeles]], nearly half of all customers are men.

There's no intimidating hocus-pocus. It feels authentic and fun."&lt;ref name="malemarket"/&gt;

===Philanthropy===
Kiehl's is recognized for its [[philanthropy|philanthropic activities]].

"'''Land of the Free'''" is the [[national anthem]] of [[Belize]]. The words were written by [[Samuel Alfred Haynes]] and the music by [[Selwyn Walford Young]] in 1963. It was officially adopted in 1981.

==Lyrics==
:O, [[Belize|Land of the Free]] by the [[Caribbean Sea|Carib Sea]],
:Our manhood we pledge to thy liberty!
:No [[United Kingdom|tyrants]] here linger, despots must flee
:This tranquil haven of democracy
:The blood of our sires which hallows the sod,
:Brought freedom from slavery, [[British Honduras|oppression's rod]] 
:By the might of truth, and the grace of [[God]],
:No longer shall we be hewers of wood.

Chorus:
:''Arise! ye sons of the [[Baymen]]'s clan,''
:''Put on your armour, clear the land!''
:''Drive back [[United Kingdom|the tyrants]], let despots flee -''
:''Land of the Free by the [[Caribbean Sea|Carib Sea]]!''

:Nature has blessed thee with wealth untold,
:O'er mountains and valleys where prairies roll;
:Our fathers, the Baymen, valiant and bold
:Drove back [[United Kingdom|the invader]]; this heritage hold
:From proud [[Hondo River (Belize)|Rio Hondo]] to old [[Sarstoon River|Sarstoon]],
:Through coral isle, over blue lagoon;
:Keep watch with [[Flag of Belize|the angels]], [[Flag of Belize|the stars and moon]];
:For freedom comes tomorrow's noon.

:(Chorus)

== History and criticism ==

=== Samuel Haynes ===
Haynes participated in [[World War I]] as part of the colonial effort for [[Great Britain]] and encountered much abuse and ridicule along with his fellow workers. On his return to Belize he became a part of workers' movements in Belize and is readily identified with the 1919 Ex-Servicemen's Riot that began on 22 July. After that riot was suppressed, Haynes began organising Belize's branch of the [[Universal Negro Improvement Association]] (UNIA) and facilitated the visit of its head [[Marcus Garvey]] of [[Jamaica]]. Garvey recruited Haynes to work with him in the U.S., a move that rendered the UNIA in Belize leaderless for much of the 1920s and that indirectly contributed to the Isaiah Morter controversy. Haynes most likely wrote the anthem as an answer to colonialism's stifling of Belizeans' identity. The lofty language and uplifting lyrics referenced Belize's former status as a slave society indebted to profits from forestry, cleverly linking it to the end of Belize's colonial period, a process that culminated on 21 September 1981. The song was originally titled "Land of the Gods", a salute to the proliferation of organised religion in Belize.

=== Exalting by the PUP ===
With the arrival of the nationalist movement led by the [[People's United Party]], the search was on for new symbols of Belizean identity. The PUP had defied the colonial order by singing "[[God Bless America]]" instead of the royal anthem "[[God Save the King]]" (or Queen). At independence, the ruling PUP named "Land of the Free" Belize's official anthem and played it at emotional independence ceremonies on 21 September. Most Belizeans agreed with the choice but lamented that it had not been put to a vote of Belizean residents.

=== Common complaints since ===
The anthem has come under fire from critics who charge that its language is archaic and does not appeal to a new generation of Belizeans who are in any case too young to remember [[Samuel Alfred Haynes|Samuel Haynes]].

Some have argued that the anthem is too [[Masculinism|male-centric]]. Lyrics such as "Our manhood we pledge to thy liberty" suggest the song was originally intended to be sung only by men. ''[[Amandala]]'' correspondent Naomi Burn suggested that "manhood" be replaced by "honour" so that the lyrics would have more relevance for women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Burn|first1=Naomi|title=We need a new national anthem – for all Belizeans|url=http://amandala.com.bz/news/we-need-a-new-national-anthem-for-all-belizeans/|accessdate=May 2, 2016|work=Amandala|date=August 24, 2006|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been noted that women are never mentioned in the anthem, only men.&lt;ref name="Rosberg"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rosberg|first1=Michael|last2=Catzim-Sanchez|first2=Adele|title=Women in Politics: Seeking Opportunities for Leadership in Belize|url=http://nationalwomenscommission.org/Publications/Women%20in%20Politics%20-%20Seeking%20Opportunities%20for%20Leadership%20in%20Belize.pdf|publisher=National Women's Commission|accessdate=May 2, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150629231928/http://nationalwomenscommission.org/Publications/Women%20in%20Politics%20-%20Seeking%20Opportunities%20for%20Leadership%20in%20Belize.pdf|archivedate=June 29, 2015|location=Belize|page=71|date=March 2001|isbn=9768111658}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1998 survey of approximately 2,000 Belizean women asked how important it was to include women in the national anthem. 14.6% answered "most important", 19.7% answered "somewhat important", and 63.4% answered "not very important".&lt;ref name="Rosberg"/&gt;

Nationalist writers have argued that the anthem's references to the Baymen ignore the multi-cultural diversity of Belize today and have proposed a number of replacements. The most recent complaint of this nature was leveled by [[Maya peoples|Maya]]-[[Mestizo]]-born correspondent Clinton Luna, who suggested that the phrase "sons of the Belizean soil" should replace "sons of the Baymen's clan" in the chorus in recent issues of the ''[[Amandala]]'' weekly newspaper.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} The newspaper itself has previously argued to the same effect. However, ''Amandala'' contributor Henry Gordon countered in a later issue that nothing in the anthem represents any sort of bias to any ethnic group in Belize.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

Belizeans speak a wide range of languages including English, Spanish, three different [[Mayan languages|Mayan dialects]], as well as native languages spoken by its [[Ethnic Chinese in Belize|diverse Chinese-speaking people]], [[Garinagu]], [[Asian Indians in Belize|East Indian population]], [[Mennonites in Belize|Mennonite community]]. The anthem, in formal English, has been memorised by generations of children, but not necessarily understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bracken|first1=Amy|title=Creole Anthem|url=https://www.pri.org/stories/2011-09-21/creole-anthem|accessdate=20 July 2017|publisher=''[[Public Radio International]]''|date=21 September 2011|location=Minneapolis, Minnesota}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because Kriol is the language that binds all Belizeans together, regardless of the origin of their first language, [[Leela Vernon]] translated the song into Kriol in 2011 with the hope that the meaning behind the words would be better understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Badillo|first1=Gerry|title=The Belize National Anthem in Creole Leela Vernon Style|url=http://www.ambergristoday.com:80/content/stories/2011/november/04/belize-national-anthem-creole-leela-vernon-style|accessdate=20 July 2017|publisher=''[[Ambergris Today]]''|date=4 November 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160414050907/http://www.ambergristoday.com/content/stories/2011/november/04/belize-national-anthem-creole-leela-vernon-style|archivedate=14 April 2016|location=San Pedro Town, Belize|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In author [[Zee Edgell]]'s ''[[Beka Lamb]]'', [[Beka Lamb (character)|the title character]] and her friend [[Toycie Qualo]] sing the full version of the original song, '''Land of the Gods''' (of which the two opening and closing lines are mentioned in the story), while parodying the political meetings then being held by the PIP, a reference to the PUP, in [[Belize City]]. Edgell acknowledged permission to use the song at the front of the book.
* The anthem was prominently featured in [[2005 Belize unrest|demonstrations in Belize in 2005]].
* Belizeans normally stand at attention facing forward, headgear off, while singing or facing someone singing the national anthem.

==Controversies==
As in other countries, several World Heritage sites in Japan have been marked by controversy. The [[Hashima Island|Hashima]] (Gunkanjima/Battleship Island) former coal mine has been the subject of the most controversy because of the Japanese government's refusal to acknowledge its wartime history of forced labor by Korean and Chinese prisoners. Recent academic research has questioned the Japanese government's compliance with UNESCO regulations and requirements with respect to the Hashima site.&lt;ref&gt;https://apjjf.org/2018/01/Palmer.html&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|UNESCO]] designated [[Shiretoko National Park|Shiretoko]] a [[World Heritage Site]], advising to develop the property jointly with the [[Kuril Islands]] of [[Russia]] as a transboundary "World Heritage Peace Park". However, Shiretoko's listing as Natural Heritage was seen by the Indigenous [[Ainu people|Ainu]] as contradicting the long history of Ainu settlement in the park area.&lt;ref&gt;M. Hudson, M. Aoyama, “Occupational apartheid and national parks: the Shiretoko world heritage site,” in F. Kronenberg, N. Pollard, D. Sakellariou, eds. Occupational Therapies Without Borders: Towards an Ecology of Occupation Based Practices (Edinburgh: Elsevier), pp. 247-255&lt;/ref&gt;.Controversies over the [[Hidden Christian Sites in the Nagasaki Region]] have also been widely discussed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.drustvo-antropologov.si/AN/PDF/2017_3/Anthropological_Notebooks_XIII_3_Delakorda.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; After two professors at the Mt. Fuji World Heritage Centre, Shizuoka were controversially forced to quit their jobs due to academic and racial harassment by officials of [[Shizuoka prefecture]] government in March 2018, comments on social media called for the cancellation of Mt. Fuji's World Heritage inscription.&lt;ref&gt;「富士山世界遺産センター、２教授退職しピンチ」[Mt.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5988">'''Lumino Kinetic art''' involves, as the name suggests, light and movement.  It is a subset and an art historical term in the context of the more established [[kinetic art]], which in turn is a subset of [[new media art]].  The historian of art [[Frank Popper]] views the evolution of this type of art as evidence of "aesthetic preoccupations linked with technological advancement" and a starting-point in the context of high-technology art.&lt;ref&gt;Popper (1993)&lt;/ref&gt; [[László Moholy-Nagy]] (1895–1946), a member of the [[Bauhaus]], and influenced by [[Constructivism (art)|constructivism]] can be regarded as one of the fathers of Lumino kinetic art. [[Light sculpture]] and moving sculpture are the components of his ''Light-Space Modulator'' (1922–30), One of the first [[Light art]] pieces which also combines [[kinetic art]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ArtistWorks?cgroupid=999999961&amp;artistid=1649&amp;page=1&amp;sole=y&amp;collab=y&amp;attr=y&amp;sort=default&amp;tabview=bio Tate bio] Retrieved January 17, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hatjecantz.de/controller.php?cmd=artdictionary&amp;id=32] Retrieved January 17, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The origins of the term itself are multiple. There was an early [[cybernetic art]]ist, [[Nicolas Schöffer]], who developed walls of light, prisms, and video circuits under the term in the 50s.&lt;ref name=Nouveaux&gt;{{cite web |title= Glossary - Kinetic art|url= http://www.newmedia-art.org/english/glossaire.htm|work= |publisher= New Media Encyclopedia|accessdate=13 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Artist/engineer [[Frank Malina]] came up with the [[Lumidyne]] system of lighting (CITE), and his work ''Tableaux mobiles'' (moving paintings) is an example of Lumino Kinetic art of that period.&lt;ref name=Nouveaux/&gt;  Later, artist [[Nino Calos]] worked with the term "Limino-kinetic paintings. (CITE). Artist [[György Kepes]] was also experimenting with lumino-kinetic works.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Art Online&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Ellis D Fogg]] is also associated with the term as a "lumino kinetic sculptor".
In the 1960s various exhibits involved Lumino Kinetic art, inter alia ''Kunst-Licht-Kunst'' at the Stedelijk Van Abbemuseum in Eindhoven in 1966, and ''Lumière et mouvement'' at the [[Musée National d'Art Moderne|Musée d'Art Moderne]] &lt;!-- pls check validity of link --&gt; de la Ville de Paris in 1967.&lt;ref name=Nouveaux/&gt;

Lumino Kinetic art was also aligned with [[Op art]] in the late 60s because the moving lights were spectacular and psychedelic.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book |title= Summer of love: psychedelic art, social crisis and counterculture in the 1960s|last= Grunenberg|first= Christoph  |authorlink= |author2=Jonathan Harris |year= 2005|publisher= Liverpool University Press, 2005|location= |isbn= 0-85323-919-3|page= |pages= |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=lfXljzVwkJcC&amp;pg=PA291&amp;dq=%22lumino%22+art&amp;lr=&amp;ei=AbV-SqKFKpmSywSK5tjACg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22lumino%22%20art&amp;f=false|accessdate=13 August 2009}} 
&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Frank Popper]] views it as an art historical term in the context of kinetic art; he states that "there is no lumino kinetic art after the early 70s; it stands as a precursor to other contemporary cybernetic, robotic, new media-based arts, and is limited to a very small number of (male) European avant-garde artists (part of the [[New Tendencies]] movement)".&lt;ref&gt;

'''''MicroMega''''' is a political, cultural, social and economic [[newsmagazine]] published [[bimonthly]] in Rome, Italy. The title ''MicroMega'' is probably inspired by a tale by [[Voltaire]].

==History and profile==
''MicroMega'' was founded in March 1986 by the editors [[Giorgio Ruffolo]] and [[Paolo Flores d'Arcais]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rosi Braidotti|title=After Poststructuralism: Transitions and Transformations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qWl_BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA319|accessdate=9 January 2015|date=11 September 2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-54681-8|page=319}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine is published by the [[Gruppo Editoriale L'Espresso]] and is based in Rome. Its editor is Paolo Flores d'Arcais.

During the first years, the magazine had a subtitle: "le ragioni della sinistra" ("the reasons of the Left"). Later this subtitle was removed. Each number has now a different title, inspired by a discussion theme.

Given its format, which includes long essays and articles, the journal tends to cater to an intellectual elite. Journalist [[Marco Travaglio]] is one of its better known contributors. Many philosophers, social scientists and men and women of science and other leading figures have written on this paper, including [[Massimo Cacciari]], [[Joseph Ratzinger]], [[Bruno Forte]], [[Michele Santoro]], [[Gianni Vattimo]], [[Leszek Kołakowski]], [[Marcel Gauchet]], [[Margherita Hack]] and [[Walter Veltroni]].

The magazine was issued monthly from 20 February to 20 April 2006, then weekly (over an eight-week period) during the 2006 Italian political campaign. In this time, it was issued with the title ''La primavera di MicroMega''. In 2007, the magazine returned to the original bimonthly format.

''MicroMega'' has an average circulation of 25,000/30,000 copies. In 2006, some issues sold more than 100,000 copies.

On 8 July 2008, ''MicroMega'' organised a rally against [[Silvio Berlusconi]]'s attempt to limit the power of the judiciary by getting parliament to pass a law that granted individuals occupying the four highest offices of the land (retroactive) immunity from prosecution during their mandate: they are the President of the Republic, the Prime Minister, the Speaker of the House of Deputies and the Speaker of the Senate. As prime minister, Berlusconi is thus be protected from prosecution until he leaves office. Roughly 100,000 people gathered in Rome's Piazza Navona to express their indignation at the new law and in defence of democracy. In 2009 that law was judged unconstitutional and repealed by the [[Constitutional Court of Italy|Constitutional Court]].

{{Islam}}
There is a wide range of '''[[Muslim]] attitudes toward [[terrorism]]'''. A number of surveys over the years have found that majorities of Muslims oppose attacks against civilians, and some have found greater support in specific countries and situations.

==Condemnation and opposition==
{{See also|Islamic terrorism#Criticism of Islamic terrorist ideology}}

In the article "Why are there no condemnations from Muslim sources against terrorists?" [[Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance]] summarizes:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/islfatwa.htm |title=Why are there no condemnations from Muslim sources against terrorists? |publisher=Religioustolerance.org |accessdate=2016-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|A common complaint among non-Muslims is that Muslim religious authorities do not condemn terrorist attacks. The complaints often surface in letters to the editors of newspapers, on phone-in radio shows, in Internet mailing lists, forums, etc. A leader of an evangelical Christian para-church group, broadcasting over Sirius Family Net radio, stated that he had done a thorough search on the Internet for a Muslim statement condemning terrorism, without finding a single item.

Actually, there are lots of fatwas and other statements issued which condemn attacks on innocent civilians. Unfortunately, they are largely ignored by newspapers, television news, radio news and other media outlets.}}

Some Muslims have spoken out against 9/11.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guleninstitute.org/news/97-gs-condemnation-message-of-terrorism.html |title=Gülen's Condemnation Message of Terrorism |author=[[Fethullah Gülen]] |publisher=Gülen Institute |date=2001-09-12 |accessdate=2014-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kurzman.unc.edu/islamic-statements-against-terrorism/ |title=Islamic Statements Against Terrorism |author=[[Charles Kurzman]] |publisher=[[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] |date=2012-03-15 |accessdate=2014-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.muhajabah.com/otherscondemn.php |title=Muslims Condemn Terrorist Attacks |publisher=Muhajabah.com |accessdate=2014-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2007 [[Pew Research Center]] study of several nations throughout the Muslim world showed that opposition to suicide bombing in the Muslim world is increasing, with a majority of Muslims surveyed in 10 out of the 16 of the countries responding that suicide bombings and other violence against civilians is "never" justified, though an average of 38% believe it is justified at least rarely. Opposition to [[Hamas]] was the majority opinion in only 4 out of the 16 countries surveyed, as was opposition to Hezbollah.&lt;ref name=pew&gt;{{cite web |year=2007 |url=http://www.pewglobal.org/2007/07/24/a-rising-tide-lifts-mood-in-the-developing-world/ |title=A Rising Tide Lifts Mood in the Developing World |work=Pew Global Attitudes Project |publisher=Pew Research Center |accessdate=2013-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pew Research Study did not include Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Afghanistan, Tunisia, Libya, and Algeria in the survey, although densely populated Muslim countries such as Pakistan, Egypt, Indonesia, and Bangladesh were included.

A [[YouGov]] survey for the [[Daily Telegraph]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=King |first=Anthony |date=2005-07-23 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1494648/One-in-four-Muslims-sympathises-with-motives-of-terrorists.html |title=One in four Muslims sympathises with motives of terrorists |work=News |publisher=Telegraph Group Limited |accessdate=2006-06-25 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; published two weeks after the [[7 July 2005 London bombings|July 2005 bombings]] in the [[London Underground]], showed that 88% of British Muslims were opposed to the bombings, while 6% (about 100,000 individuals) fully supported them, and one British Muslim in four expressed some sympathy with the motives of the bombers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icmresearch.co.uk/pdfs/2006_february_sunday_telegraph_muslims_poll.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012033038/http://www.icmresearch.co.uk/pdfs/2006_february_sunday_telegraph_muslims_poll.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-10-12 |title=Muslims Poll |publisher=ICM Research |date=February 2006 |accessdate=10 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2007 poll found that one Muslim in four thought the Government had staged the bombings and framed the Muslims convicted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1553657/77-bombs-staged-say-one-in-four-Muslims.html |title=7/7 bombs staged, say one in four Muslims |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=2007-06-05 |accessdate=2014-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2011 study by Pew Research showed that 64% of Muslim Americans thought that there was not much or no support among them for extremism, while 6% thought there was a great deal, and 15% thought there was a fair amount.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.people-press.org/2011/08/30/muslim-americans-no-signs-of-growth-in-alienation-or-support-for-extremism/ |title=Muslim Americans: No Signs of Growth in Alienation or Support for Extremism |publisher=[[Pew Research Center for the People and the Press]] |date=2011-08-30 |accessdate=2014-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2015 survey showed that most Muslims in many Muslim-majority countries view the [[Islamic State of Iraq and Syria]] unfavorably; these views were especially common in Jordan and Lebanon. In Pakistan, 62% of Muslims polled offered no opinion on ISIS. The same survey showed that most Muslims consider violence against nonbelievers to be "rarely or never justified."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/02/27/muslims-and-islam-key-findings-in-the-u-s-and-around-the-world/ | title=Muslims and Islam: Key findings in the U.S. and around the world | work=Pew Research Center | date=27 February 2017 | accessdate=21 May 2017 | author=Lipka, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri issued the [[Fatwa on Terrorism]], endorsed by [[Al-Azhar University]] in Cairo, Egypt.

In 2008 the 9 killed Mumbai militants who perpetrated the [[2008 Mumbai attacks]] were refused an Islamic burial by influential Muslim Jama Masjid Trust who stated 'People who committed this heinous crime cannot be called Muslim'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.scotsman.com/world/Mumbai-killers-to-be-denied.4748630.jp Mumbai killers to be denied a muslim burial], ''[[The Scotsman]]'', 2008-12-01&lt;/ref&gt;

===Northwest Airlines Flight 253===
The bombing attempt on [[Northwest Airlines Flight 253]] was condemned by Muslim groups. In Canada, a group of Canadian and U.S. Islamic leaders issued a [[fatwa]], or religious edict, condemning any attacks by extremists or terrorists on the United States or Canada and declaring that an attack by extremists on the two countries would constitute an attack on Muslims living in North America. "In our view, these attacks are evil, and Islam requires Muslims to stand up against this evil," said the fatwa signed by the 20 imams associated with the [[Islamic Supreme Council of Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.islamicsupremecouncil.com/iscc-fatwa-against%20terrorism.htm |title=Attack on Canada and the United States is Attack on Muslims Too |publisher=[[Islamic Supreme Council of Canada]] |date=2010-01-08 |accessdate=2014-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; It concludes that Muslims "must expose any person, Muslim or non-Muslim, who would cause harm to fellow Canadians or Americans". One of the imams was reported saying: "it is religious obligation upon Muslims, based upon the Qur'anic teachings, that we have to be loyal to the country where we live". The fatwa also indicated that religious leaders have a duty to show others around the world that Muslims in Canada and the U.S. "have complete freedom to practice Islam" and that "any attack on Canada and the United States is an attack on the freedom of Canadian and American Muslims."&lt;ref name="star"&gt;{{cite news |title=Twenty imams issue fatwa against attacks in Canada or the U.S. |url=https://www.thestar.com/News/Canada/article/748234--twenty-imams-issue-fatwa-against-attacks-in-canada-or-the-u-s |accessdate=Jan 29, 2011 |newspaper=Toronto Star |date=Jan 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cbc&gt;{{cite news |title=Attack on Canada, U.S. is attack on Muslims: imams |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2010/01/08/canada-muslim-fatwa-attack-canada-united-states.html |accessdate=January 29, 2011 |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |date=January 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[2011 Alexandria bombing]]===
As gesture of solidarity with the country's Coptic Christian minority, Egyptian Muslims showed up at churches on the eve of the Coptic Christmas on 6 January 2011 during mass service forming a "human shield" against any possible further attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |publisher=Fox News Channel |title=Egypt's Muslims Attend Coptic Christmas Mass, Serving as 'Human Shields' |url=http://nation.foxnews.com/coptic-christians/2011/01/15/egypts-muslims-attend-coptic-christmas-mass-serving-human-shields |date=January 15, 2011 |accessdate=2011-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In the days before the mass, Muslims and Copts joined together in a show of solidarity that included street protests, rallies, and widespread Facebook unity campaigns calling for an "Egypt for All".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/95/3351/Egypt/Attack-on-Egypt-Copts/Ministers-and-movie-stars-turned-out-for-troublefr.aspx |title=In Egypt, ministers and movie stars turn out for trouble-free Christmas mass |work=[[Al-Ahram]] |date=7 January 2011 |accessdate=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Lebanon, separate condemnations came from the [[Sunni]] Mufti of the Republic Mohammad Qabbani and Deputy Head of the [[Shiite]] Supreme Council Abdul Amir Qabalan.&lt;ref name="iLoubnan"&gt;{{cite news |title=Lebanese Leaders Condemn Alexandria Church Massacre |url=http://www.iloubnan.info/politics/actualite/id/53775 |accessdate=1 January 2011 |newspaper=iLoubnan |date=1 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hamas has also condemned the bombing in Alexandria, assigning the blame to hidden hands that do not wish well for Egypt and its Muslim and Christian people and seek to inflame sectarian strife. Hamas in its statement sent condolences to Egypt and the victims' families, and hoped that facts would be disclosed the soonest and that those responsible would be brought to justice.&lt;ref name="Hamas condemns"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://abna.ir/data.asp?lang=3&amp;id=219398 |title=Hamas condemns Alexandria church bombing |publisher=Ahlul Bayt News Agency |date=2011-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the attacks, [[Amr Khaled]], an influential Egyptian Muslim preacher, launched a campaign to fight sectarian incitement made on the internet, which he believed to be a cause of the violence witnessed on New Year's Eve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/3406/Egypt/Politics-/Amr-Khaled-calls-for-Facebook-users-to-fight-secta.aspx |title=Amr Khaled calls for Facebook users to fight sectarianism |work=Al-Ahram |date=8 January 2011 |accessdate=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2010, thousands of Yemeni tribesmen vowed to back the government's efforts in its battles against [[Al-Qaeda]] and promised to fight alongside the troops. Chieftain Naji bin Abdul-Aziz al-Shaif of the northern powerful Bakeel tribe and the organizer of the rally stated: "We will fight against al-Qaida group as it harmed the reputation of the country, Yemeni tribes and Muslims...We expressed our sorrow to all countries and people who were harmed by al-Qaida and we demanded President Ali Abdullah Saleh to handle the situation and we will stand by him."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Yemeni tribesmen voice support for fight against al-Qaida |url=http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90001/90777/90854/7192595.html? |accessdate=January 29, 2011 |newspaper=People's Daily Online |date=November 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Iranian Ayatollah [[Ozma Seyyed Yousef Sanei]] issued a [[fatwa]] (ruling) that suicide attacks against civilians are legitimate only in the context of war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |year=2006 |url=http://www.adnki.com/index_2Level.php?cat=Terrorism&amp;loid=8.0.245083220&amp;par=0 |title=Iran: Ayatollah Issues Fatwa Against Suicide Attacks |publisher=adn kronos international |accessdate=2006-06-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311032307/http://www.adnki.com/index_2Level.php?cat=Terrorism&amp;loid=8.0.245083220&amp;par=0 |archivedate=March 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abdelrahman al-Rashid, a Muslim and the managing director of Arab news channel [[Al-Arabiya]], stated that "It is a certain fact that not all Muslims are terrorists, but it is equally certain, and exceptionally painful, that almost all terrorists are Muslims" and blamed radical clerics for hijacking the peace-loving and tolerant religion of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Arab journalist attacks radical Islam |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3632462.stm |date=2004-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Statistics compiled by the United States government's Counterterrorism Center present a more complicated picture. 21% of fatalities of known and specified terrorist incidents in 2006 were attributed to Islamic extremists.&lt;ref name="NCTC 2006"&gt;{{cite web |title=Excerpt: NCTC Report on Terrorist Incidents – 2006 |url=https://www.fbi.gov/stats-services/publications/terror_06.pdf |publisher=National Counterterrorism Center |date=2007-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; A majority of over-all incidents were considered of either "unknown/unspecified" or a secular political nature.&lt;ref name="NCTC 2006" /&gt; The vast majority of the "unknown/unspecified" terrorism fatalities did however happen in Islamic regions such as Iraq, Afghanistan and India.&lt;ref name="NCTC 2006" /&gt;

According to the ''[[Country Reports on Terrorism]] 2011'' published in 2012 by the U.S. [[National Counterterrorism Center]] (NCTC), "Sunni extremists accounted for the greatest number of terrorist attacks and fatalities for the third consecutive year. More than 5,700 incidents were attributed to Sunni extremists, accounting for nearly 56 percent of all attacks and about 70 percent of all fatalities."&lt;ref name=nctc&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/j/ct/rls/crt/2011/195555.htm |title=Country Reports on Terrorism 2011 |author=[[National Counterterrorism Center]] |publisher=[[United States Department of State]] |date=31 July 2012 |accessdate=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report said that in 2011, a total of 10,283 terrorism attacks across the world killed 12,533 people. Terrorism was also blamed for 25,903 injuries and 5,554 kidnappings.  According to the NCTC, of the 12,533 terrorism-related deaths worldwide, 8,886 were perpetrated by "Sunni extremists", 1,926 by "secular/political/anarchist" groups, 1,519 by "unknown" factions, 170 by a category described as "other", and 77 by "Neo-Nazi/Fascist/White Supremacist" groups.&lt;ref name=nctc/&gt;

==Demonstrations in support==

Upon Osama bin Laden's death, some Muslims in the UK came out on the streets in support of bin Laden, praising him as an Islamic hero and condemned the role of the US and the West in killing him. The protest was organised by the activist [[Anjem Choudary]], who earlier praised both [[7 July 2005 London bombings|7/7]] and the [[September 11 attacks]], and was later jailed for his support of [[ISIS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/news/862613-extremists-hold-osama-bin-laden-funeral-at-us-embassy-in-london#ixzz1jMK5lHCV |title=Extremists hold Osama bin Laden 'funeral' at US Embassy in London |publisher= Metro.co.uk |date= May 7, 2011 |accessdate=January 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=conviction1&gt;{{cite news|title=Radical cleric Anjem Choudary guilty of inviting IS support|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-37098751|accessdate=16 August 2016|work=BBC News|date=16 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Polls==
===Gallup polls===
A [[Gallup poll]] published in 2011, "suggests that one's religious identity and level of devotion have little to do with one's views about targeting civilians."&lt;ref name="views"&gt;{{cite web |title=Views of Violence |url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/157067/views-violence.aspx |publisher=Gallup |accessdate=31 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results of the survey suggested that "human development and governance - not piety or culture" were the strongest factors in explaining the public's view of violence toward civilians.&lt;ref name=views/&gt; In a Gallup World Poll in 2011, residents of the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]] (OIC) member states were less likely to justify the targeting and killing of civilians than residents of non-OIC states:&lt;ref name="views"/&gt;

* In Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) member states, 18% believe military attacks on civilians justified and 14% believe individual attacks on civilians justified.
* In non-OIC states, 24% believe military attacks on civilians justified and 17% believe individual attacks on civilians justified.

In a regional breakdown, Gallup found that [[North America]]ns were most likely to justify military attacks on civilians, while residents of the [[MENA]] ([[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]]) region were most likely to oppose them. When asked about whether it is justifiable for the military to target and kill civilians:&lt;ref name="views"/&gt;

* In [[Asia]], 58% said it is never justifiable, 12% said it is sometimes justifiable, and 15% said it depends.
* In the [[post-Soviet states]], 56% said it is never justifiable, 8% said it is sometimes justifiable, and 20% said it depends.
* In the MENA (Middle East and North Africa) region, 85% said it is never justifiable, 9% said it is sometimes justifiable, and 4% said it depends.
* In [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], 66% said it is never justifiable, 17% said it is sometimes justifiable, and 11% said it depends.
* In the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], 50% said it is never justifiable, 47% said it is sometimes justifiable, and 2% said it depends.
* In [[Europe]], 69% said it is never justifiable, 12% said it is sometimes justifiable, and 11% said it depends.

In another 2011 Gallup poll, they surveyed [[Americans]], and found that [[Muslim Americans]] were less likely to justify the targeting and killing of civilians than other Americans.&lt;ref name="gallup"&gt;http://www.gallup.com/poll/148763/muslim-americans-no-justification-violence.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Esposito]], using poll data from [[Gallup (company)|Gallup]], wrote in 2008 that Muslims and Americans were equally likely to reject violence against civilians. He also found that those Muslims who support violence against civilians are no more religious than Muslims who do not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Excerpt: 'Who Speaks for Islam?' |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=87860378 |publisher=[[NPR]] |date=2008-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; A later 2011 Gallup World Poll found that, in the MENA (Middle East and North Africa) region, "those who reject military and individual attacks on civilians are more likely to say religion is an important part of their daily lives."&lt;ref name=views/&gt;

===Other polls===
According to an [[ICM Research]] poll in 2006, 20% of British Muslims felt sympathy with the [[7 July 2005 London bombings|July 7 terrorist]] bombers' "feelings and motives", although 99 per cent thought the bombers were wrong to carry out the attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1510866/Poll-reveals-40pc-of-Muslims-want-sharia-law-in-UK.html |title=Poll reveals 40pc of Muslims want sharia law in UK |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=19 February 2006 |accessdate=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another poll by NOP Research in 2006, almost one in four British Muslims believe that the 7/7 attacks on London were justified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/many-british-muslims-put-islam-first/ |title=Many British Muslims Put Islam First |publisher=[[CBS News]] |date=14 August 2006 |accessdate=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2005 Pew Research study, that involved 17,000 people in 17 countries showed support for terrorism was declining in the Muslim world along with a growing belief that Islamic extremism represents a threat to those countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|year=2005|url=http://pewglobal.org/reports/display.php?ReportID=248|title=Islamic Extremism: Common Concern for Muslim and Western Publics|work=Pew Global Attitudes Project|publisher=Pew Research Center|accessdate=June 25, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2005 ''[[The Daily Telegraph|Daily Telegraph]]'' survey&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=King|first=Anthony|authorlink=Anthony King (professor)|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1494648/One-in-four-Muslims-sympathises-with-motives-of-terrorists.html|title=One in four Muslims sympathises with motives of terrorists|publisher=The Daily Telegraph|location=London|date=23 July 2005|accessdate=August 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that 88% of Muslims said the [[7 July 2005 London bombings|July 2005 bombings]] in the London Underground were unjustified, while 6% disagreed. However it also found that 24% of British Muslims showed some sympathy with the people who carried out the attacks.

Polls taken by Saudi owned [[Al Arabiya]] and [[The Gallup Organization|Gallup]] suggested moderate support for the September 11 terrorist attacks within the [[Arab world]], with 36% of Arabs polled by Al Arabiya saying the 9/11 attacks were morally justified, 38% disagreeing and 26% of those polled being unsure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2011/09/10/166274.html Arab polling], Al Arabiya&lt;/ref&gt; A 2008 study, produced by Gallup, found similar results with 38.6% of Muslims questioned believing the 9/11 attacks were justified.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/just-like-us-really Just Like Us!

==Western perspectives==
[[Michael Scott Doran]] wrote in the journal ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'' that Islam seemed to be polarised between pro-Western and pro-jihadi mentalities, enabling a clear divide between opponents and proponents of violent action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/57618/michael-scott-doran/somebody-elses-civil-war |author=[[Michael Scott Doran]] |title=Somebody Else's Civil War |journal=[[Foreign Affairs]] |issue=January/February 2002 |accessdate=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The  [[International Crisis Group]] wrote in their 2005 report ''Understanding Islamism'' that Islamic ideological and political spectrums were far more diverse than this idea suggests.  American policy is unpopular among some Muslims, the report argued, yet this hostility did not directly translate to support for or participation in global jihad, and for political [[Islamists]] who support non-violent measures it could not be assumed that they are in agreement with Western agendas.&lt;ref name="International"&gt;International Crisis Group.

'''Omar Yussef''' is a fictional character and the hero of a series of crime novels by Welsh writer [[Matt Beynon Rees]].

== Life and Times ==
According to the novels, Omar Yussef Subhi Sirhan, also known as Abu Ramiz (the father of Ramiz), was born in 1948 in [[Malha]], a destroyed Palestinian village south of [[Jerusalem]] (''The Collaborator of Bethlehem'', Soho Crime, New York, February 2007). His father, the village mukhtar, or headman, fled with his family and the other villagers, on the creation of the Israeli state in the spring of that year. The Sirhan family went to the Dehaisha Refugee Camp, set up in fields south of [[Bethlehem]]. Omar’s father rented a home and Omar continues to lease the same stone house.

Omar attended Damascus University and became involved in student politics. It was at University that he met Khamis Zeydan, a young Palestinian nationalist and a refugee from the coastal town of [[Jaffa]], who later became police chief in Bethlehem. Omar’s adherence to the Pan-Arab [[Ba'ath Party]] earned him the suspicion of the Jordanian regime. In early 1967 Omar was arrested by Jordanian police in Bethlehem and accused of murder. Omar later said the charges were false and that he had been jailed by political opponents eager to smear him (''A Grave in Gaza'', Soho Crime, New York, February 2008).

While traveling home at the end of the university semester in 1968, Omar met Maryam Hassan. Maryam was an educated young woman from a prominent family in the village of Mash’had outside [[Nazareth]]. She had relatives in the Bethlehem area and was on her way to visit them, when she encountered Omar in a taxi near the West Bank town of [[Jenin]]. They were married the following year.

On his return from university, Omar abandoned politics in favor of a quiet career as a history teacher. He taught at the school run by the Freres of St. John de la Salle in Bethlehem until the early 1990s. The school’s pupils were drawn from the local Muslim and Christian populations. He was forced out of the school after a confrontation with a local schools inspector who considered Omar too critical of the new Palestinian Authority. Omar took a job at the United Nations Relief and Works Basic School for Girls in Dehaisha camp. The job was a step down in prestige from the Freres School, but it drew Omar into closer contact with the poorest refugees of Bethlehem and alerted him to their sufferings. Eventually this led him to reject the quiet life he had led and to attempt to confront the corruption and violence that engulfed his town.

Omar and Maryam have three sons. Ramiz, the eldest, runs a cellphone business in Bethlehem. He’s married to Sara and has three children, Nadia (Omar’s favorite grandchild), Little Omar, and Reem. Omar’s second son, Zuheir, lives in Britain, where he teaches Islamic history at the University of Wales. The youngest son, Ala, is a computer salesman in New York.

Since his student days, Omar had been a heavy drinker and a compulsive smoker. Health problems in his mid-forties forced him to quit both. He continues to be in poor health, however, with shaking hands and arthritic joints.

'''Palácio de Ferro''' ({{lang-en|Iron Palace}}) is a historical building in the [[Angola]]n capital [[Luanda]], ''believed to have been designed and built by &amp;ndash; or by someone associated with &amp;ndash; [[Gustave Eiffel]]'', builder of the world-famous icons, the [[Eiffel Tower]] in Paris and the [[Statue of Liberty]] in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.france24.com/en/20090122-luanda-breathes-new-life-once-rusty-iron-palace|date=2009-01-22 |author= Louisse Redvers|title=Luanda breathes new life into once-rusty Iron Palace|publisher=France 24 |accessdate=2009-01-23 }} {{Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of the structure is shrouded in mystery since no official record of it exists. It is believed to have been pre-built in the 1890s in France and was destined to be placed in [[Madagascar]] via boat. Instead, the building ended-up in [[Angola]]'s [[Skeleton Coast]] after the ship carrying it was drifted by the notorious [[Benguela]] currents. [[Portuguese empire|Portuguese rulers]] of the colony then claimed the ship along with all its contents, including the palace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.blnz.com/news/2009/01/22/Luanda_breathes_life_into_once-rusty_9775.html|date=2009-01-21 |title=Luanda breathes new life into once-rusty Iron Palace|publisher=BLNZ |accessdate=2009-01-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] era, the building had a great deal of prestige and it was used as an art center. But after the [[Angolan War of Independence|independence of Angola]], the palace was left in neglect with its surrounding area eventually ending up as a [[parking lot]]. It was also heavily damaged during the [[Angolan Civil War]] leaving some of its structures in a rusted and rotting condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.info7.com.mx/noticia.php?id=75584&amp;secc=7|date=2009-01-21 |title=Brasileños restauraron 'Palacio de Hierro' de Angola, con diseño de Eiffel|publisher=Info7 |accessdate=2009-01-23 }} ([[Spanish language|Spanish]])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://g1.globo.com/Noticias/PopArte/0,,MUL962028-7084,00-BRASILEIROS+RESTAURAM+PALACIO+DE+FERRO+DE+ANGOLA.html|date=2009-01-19 |title=Brasileiros restauram "Palácio de Ferro" de Angola |publisher=Globo.com |accessdate=2009-01-23 }}([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]])&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, the building is undergoing a renovation funded by profits from Angola's [[oil]] boom with the help of Brazilian construction companies, as many of the reclaimed iron balustrades and floor tiles were individually renovated in [[Rio de Janeiro]]. It now stands as the symbol of the city's rebirth as well as a point of social reference for the future. The [[Ministry of Culture (Angola)|Ministry of Culture of Angola]] is still deciding whether the building is to become a [[diamond]] museum or a restaurant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://ph.news.yahoo.com/afp/20090122/tls-angola-architecture-france-brazil-aeafa1b.html |date=2009-01-23 |title=Luanda breathes new life into once-rusty Iron Palace |publisher=Yahoo!

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7544">'''Phenomenography''' is a [[qualitative research]] [[methodology]], within the [[Paradigm|interpretivist paradigm]], that investigates the qualitatively different ways in which people experience something or think about something.&lt;ref name="Marton1986"&gt;Marton, F. (1986). Phenomenography - A research approach investigating different understandings of reality. ''Journal of Thought'', 21(2), 28-49.&lt;/ref&gt; It is an approach to educational research which appeared in publications in the early 1980s.&lt;ref name="Marton1986" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Marton1981"&gt;Marton, F. (1981). Phenomenography - describing conceptions of the world around us. ''Instructional Science'', 10(1981), 177-200.&lt;/ref&gt; It initially emerged from an [[empirical]] rather than a theoretical or philosophical basis.&lt;ref name="Akerlind2005"&gt;Åkerlind, G. (2005). Variation and commonality in phenomenographic research methods. ''Higher  Education Research &amp; Development'', 24(4), 321-334.&lt;/ref&gt;

While being an established methodological approach in education for several decades, phenomenography has now been applied rather extensively in a range of diverse disciplines such as environmental management, computer programming, workplace competence, and internationalization practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Teeter|first=Preston|last2=Sandberg|first2=Jorgen|date=2016|title=Constraining or Enabling Green Capability Development? How Policy Uncertainty Affects Organizational Responses to Flexible Environmental Regulations|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-8551.12188/full|journal=British Journal of Management|volume=|issue=|doi=10.1111/1467-8551.12188|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
  
==Overview==
Phenomenography's [[Ontology|ontological]] assumptions are [[Subjectivism|subjectivist]]: the world exists and different people construct it in different ways and from a non-dualist viewpoint (viz., there is only one world, one that is ours, and one that people experience in many different ways).&lt;ref name="Bowden2005"&gt;Bowden, J. (2005). Reflections on the phenomenographic research process. In ''Doing Developmental Phenomenography'', J. Bowden &amp; P. Green (Eds). Qualitative Research Methods Series. Melbourne, Victoria: RMIT University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MartonBooth1997"&gt;Marton, F., &amp; Booth, S. (1997). ''Learning and Awareness''. New Jersey: Lawerence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; Phenomenography's research object has the character of knowledge; therefore its ontological assumptions are also [[Epistemology|epistemological]] assumptions.&lt;ref name="Svensson1997"&gt;Svensson, L. (1997). Theoretical foundations of phenomenography. ''Higher Education Research &amp; Development'', 16(2): 159-171.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Uljens1996"&gt;Uljens, M. (1996). On the philosophical foundation of phenomenography. In G. Dall'Alba &amp; B. Hasselgren (Ed.), ''Reflections on Phenomenography'' (pp. 105–130). Goteborg: Acta Universitatis Gothenburgensis.&lt;/ref&gt;

Its emphasis is on description. Its data collection methods typically include close interviews with a small, purposive sample of subjects, with the researcher "working toward an articulation of the interviewee’s reflections on experience that is as complete as possible".&lt;ref name="MartonBooth1997" /&gt; Description is important because our knowledge of the world is a matter of meaning and of the qualitative similarities and differences in meaning as it is experienced by different people.&lt;ref name="Svensson1997" /&gt;

A phenomenographic data analysis sorts perceptions which emerge from the data collected into specific "categories of description."&lt;ref name="Marton1986" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Marton1981" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Akerlind2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Uljens1996" /&gt; The set of these categories is sometimes referred to as an "outcome space."  These categories (and the underlying structure) become the phenomenographic essence of the phenomenon.&lt;ref name="Uljens1996" /&gt; They are the primary outcomes and are the most important result of phenomenographic research.&lt;ref name="Marton1986"/&gt; Phenomenographic categories are logically related to one another, typically by way of hierarchically inclusive relationships,&lt;ref name="Marton1986" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MartonBooth1997" /&gt; although linear and branched relationships can also occur.&lt;ref name="Akerlind2005" /&gt; That which varies between different categories of description is known as the "dimensions of variation."

The process of phenomenographic analysis is strongly [[iterative]] and comparative. It involves continual sorting and resorting of data and ongoing comparisons between the data and the developing categories of description, as well as between the categories themselves.&lt;ref name="Akerlind2005"/&gt;

A phenomenographic analysis seeks a "description, analysis, and understanding of . . . experiences".&lt;ref name="Marton1981" /&gt; The focus is on variation: variation in both the perceptions of the phenomenon, as experienced by the actor, and in the "ways of seeing something" as experienced and described by the researcher.&lt;ref name="Pang1999"&gt;Pang, M. (1999). ''Two faces of variation: On continuity in the phenomenographic movement''. Paper presented at the 8th Biennial Conference of the European Association for Research in Learning and Instruction, Goteborg, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is described as phenomenography's "theory of variation."&lt;ref name="Pang1999" /&gt; Phenomenography allows researchers to use their own experiences as data for phenomenographic analysis;&lt;ref name="Uljens1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Saljo1996"&gt;Säljö, R. (1996). Minding action - conceiving of the world versus participating in cultural practices. In Dall'Alba &amp; Hasselgren (Eds.), ''Reflections on phenomenography - towards a methodology?'' Goteborg: Acta Universitatis Gothoburgensis.&lt;/ref&gt; it aims for a collective analysis of individual experiences.&lt;ref name="Akerlind2005"/&gt;

==Emphasis on description==

Phenomenographic studies usually involve contextual groups of people and data collection involves individual description of understanding, often through interview. Analysis is whole group orientated since all data is analysed together with the aim of identifying possible conceptions of experience related to the phenomenon under investigation, rather than individual experiences.  There is emphasis on detailed analysis of description which follows from an assumption that conceptions are formed from both the results of human action and from the conditions for it. Clarification of understanding and experience depends upon the meaning of the conceptions themselves.&lt;ref name="Svensson1997" /&gt; The object of phenomenographic study is not the [[phenomenon]] per se but the relationship between the actors and the phenomenon.&lt;ref name="Bowden2005" /&gt;

==Distinguished from phenomenology==

Phenomenography is not [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]]. Phenomenographers, on the other hand, adopt an empirical orientation and they investigate the experiences of others.&lt;ref name="MartonBooth1997"/&gt;  The focus of interpretive phenomenology is upon the essence of the phenomenon, whereas the focus of phenomenography is upon the essence of the experiences and the subsequent perceptions of the phenomenon.&lt;ref name="Hitchcock2006"&gt;Hitchcock, L. (2006): ''Methodology in computing education: a focus on experiences''. Proceedings of the 19th Annual NACCQ Conference, 7–10 July 2006, Wellington New Zealand.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10660">{{Wiktionary|Quibble}}
In terms of fiction, a '''quibble''' is a [[plot device]], used to fulfill the exact verbal conditions of an agreement in order to avoid the intended meaning. Typically quibbles are used in legal bargains and, in [[fantasy]], magically enforced ones.&lt;ref name="grant"&gt;John Grant and John Clute, ''The Encyclopedia of Fantasy'', "Quibbles" p 796 {{ISBN|0-312-19869-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; When used in a real life argument, it is termed a [[Loki's Wager]].

== Examples ==
[[William Shakespeare]] used a quibble in ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]''.  [[Portia (Merchant of Venice)|Portia]] saves [[Antonio (Merchant of Venice)|Antonio]] in a court of law by pointing out that the agreement called for a [[pound of flesh]], but no blood, and therefore [[Shylock]] can collect only if he sheds no blood, which is not physically possible.

A [[deal with the Devil|pact with the Devil]] commonly contains clauses that allow the devil to quibble over what he grants, and equally commonly, the maker of the pact finds a quibble to escape the bargain.&lt;ref name="grant" /&gt;

In [[Norse mythology]], [[Loki]], having [[Loki's wager|bet his head]] with [[Brokk]] and lost, forbids Brokk to take any part of his neck, saying he had not bet it; to avenge himself Brokk instead sews Loki's lips shut.&lt;ref name="grant" /&gt;

The Savoy Operas by [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] frequently feature quibbles; [[W. S. Gilbert]] had read law and had practised briefly as a [[barrister]], and regarded the minor technicalities of the law that typically gave rise to quibbles to be highly characteristic of the legalistic Victorian British society satirized in his works. For instance, in ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'', Frederick's terms of indenture bind him to the pirates until his twenty-first birthday; the pirates point out that he was born on February 29 (a leap year) and will not have his twenty-first birthday until he is eighty-four, and so compel him to rejoin them.

When the hero of the [[Child ballad]] ''[[The Lord of Lorn and the False Steward]]'' is forced to trade places with an impostor and swear never to reveal the truth to anyone, he tells his story to a horse while he knows that the heroine is eavesdropping. In the similar [[fairy tale]] ''[[The Goose Girl]]'', the princess pours out her story to an iron stove, but not knowing that the king is listening.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Tatar, ''The Annotated Brothers Grimm'', p 320 W. W. Norton &amp; company, London, New York, 2003 {{ISBN|0-393-05848-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Piers Anthony]]'s [[fantasy world]] [[Xanth]], the law forbids reigning queens, thereby excluding a Sorceress from ruling. But when in ''[[Night Mare]]'' one Magician after another falls to an invasion's hostile magic and it appears that no more Magicians exist to take the throne, the last Magician king observes that although the law forbids reigning queens, it nowhere states that the post of king is reserved to males.  Hence, several Sorceresses reign as King.

Quibbles are the theme of ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'' episode "[[The Man in the Bottle]]". A genie freed from a bottle grants a couple four wishes, warning that every wish has consequences. One of the man's wishes is to be in a position of great power, the leader of a modern and powerful country who cannot be voted out of office. The genie turns him into [[Adolf Hitler]] during his [[Death of Adolf Hitler|final days]] in [[World War II]].

In the ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' episode "[[The Circle (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|The Circle]]", [[Benjamin Sisko|Captain Sisko]] is ordered to evacuate the titular station against his better judgment. However, he notices that his superiors did not specify the extent of the evacuation, so he orders a complete evacuation of all their equipment, which will take far longer and necessitate some officers staying on the station in the face of an impending siege, giving them a chance to fight back. Likewise, "[[The Way of the Warrior (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|The Way of the Warrior]]", Sisko is forbidden to tell the [[Cardassian]]s about an imminent invasion of their empire by the [[Klingon]]s. However, if the Klingons take Cardassia, the [[United Federation of Planets|Federation]] and [[Bajor]] will be put at risk, so he calls in the station's resident [[Elim Garak|Cardassian tailor/spy]] to measure him for a suit while he discusses the imminent invasion with his senior officers.

In ''The Shadow Thieves'', by [[Anne Ursu]], Hades, attempting to banish the traitorous Philonecron, uses the words "You may never set foot in the Kingdom of the Dead again." Philonecron later gets around Hades's binding proclamation by having servants carry him into the Underworld.

In the 2002 film ''[[Spider-Man (2002 film)|Spider-Man]]'', [[Peter Parker]] faces professional wrestler Bonesaw McGraw after seeing a newspaper advertisement specifying "$3000 for 3 minutes in the ring." Though Parker wins the match in two minutes, the promotion's crooked promoter only pays him $100 citing that since Parker did not last three minutes in the ring, Parker did not fulfil the required conditions and was therefore unable to receive the full $3000.

In 2003’s ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl]]'', the main antagonist [[Hector Barbossa]] demonstrates this multiple times throughout the film. The most notable instance is mid-way through the film, where the main protagonists are forced to [[Walking the plank|walk the plank]] despite Barbossa agreeing to set them free. Barbossa explains this by clarifying that [[Will Turner]] “failed to specify when or where”.

In ''[[A Game of Thrones]]'', drawing a sword or spilling blood is forbidden in the city of Vaes Dothrak. However, killing someone is not explicitly forbidden. This is evident when Khal Drogo melts some of his gold medallions, has his men restrain Viserys, and pours the molten gold on him, killing him without drawing a sword or spilling blood.
V
In ''[[Mark of Athena]]'', a group of Eidolons are forced to swear to never possess the protagonists. Instead, they possess other people and objects nearby to trap three of them.

== Prophecies and spells ==
{{See also|Foreshadowing}}
When [[Croesus]] consulted the [[Pythia]], he was told that going to war with [[Cyrus the Great]] would destroy a great empire. Croesus assumed that the seer meant that the Persian Empire would be destroyed and Croesus would triumph. He proceeded to attack the Persians, believing victory was assured. In the end, however, the Persians were victorious, and the empire destroyed was not Cyrus's but Croesus's.

In Shakespeare's ''[[Macbeth]]'', Macbeth believes that he is invincible because the [[Three Witches]] give him the prophecy that "none of woman born shall harm [him]."  In the final battle of the play, [[Macduff (thane)|Macduff]] is able to kill Macbeth, because Macduff reveals that he was "from his mother's womb untimely ripp'd"&lt;ref name="grant" /&gt; — born via a [[Caesarean section]]. In a second prophecy, Macbeth is told that he has nothing to fear until Great Birnam Wood comes to Dunsinane Hill. He feels safe since he knows that forests cannot move, but is overcome when the English army, shielded with boughs cut from Birnam Wood, advances on his stronghold at Dunsinane.

In ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', the [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elf]] [[Glorfindel]]'s prophecy states that "not by the hand of man will the [[Witch-king of Angmar]] fall." The Witch-king is slain by [[Éowyn]], a woman, during the battle of the Pelennor Fields. She is aided by [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]], a male hobbit&lt;ref name="grant" /&gt; who distracted him by stabbing him with a Numenorean blade, as the Ring Wraiths are harmed by such swords.

In ''[[Ruddigore]]'', the baronets are cursed to die if they do not commit a horrible crime every day, but failing to commit such a crime is committing [[suicide]], a horrible crime (a realization that brings them all back to life).

In [[Terry Pratchett]]'s ''[[Moving Pictures (novel)|Moving Pictures]]'', a book is said to inflict terrible fates on any man opening it, but causes only mild annoyance to [[The Librarian (Discworld)|the Librarian]], who is in fact an [[orangutan]].&lt;ref name="grant" /&gt;

In ''[[The Return of Jafar]]'', the sequel to Disney's film ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'', the main villain [[Jafar (Aladdin)|Jafar]], after becoming a genie, is unable to use his powers to directly kill living beings. However, he is able to use his powers to create situations that ''could'' kill or harm his enemies, including possibly torture as Jafar darkly suggests, "you would be surprised what you can live through." Jafar also frames Aladdin for the death of the Sultan and even impersonates [[Princess Jasmine]] ordering his execution by proxy.

[[Jack Sparrow]] (from the ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean]]'' movies) promised to be Davy Jones' slave for 100 years in exchange for receiving the ''[[Black Pearl]]'' (a ship) and being made captain of that ship, for thirteen years. When Jones reminds Sparrow of his debt, Jack argues that he wasn't captain during those thirteen years, for a mutiny quickly occurred and he was abandoned on an island by his crew. To that, Davy Jones replies that regardless of this, he still owes him his soul, for he has been introducing himself as ''Captain'' Jack Sparrow during those thirteen years (and indeed, it is a running gag in the movies that each time he is called "Jack Sparrow", Jack will correct the other by saying "''Captain'' Jack Sparrow").

In ''[[Death Note]]'', the [[Shinigami (Death Note)|Shinigami]] [[Ryuk (Death Note)|Ryuk]] warns the protagonist [[Light Yagami]] to "Don't think that a human who's used the Death Note can go to heaven or hell".&lt;ref&gt;''Death Note'' chapter 1, page 24&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the series it is revealed that there's no heaven or hell and that all humans, no matter what they did in life, are equal in death.&lt;ref&gt;''Death Note'' chapter 107, page 15&lt;/ref&gt; When a human dies, the human goes to "Mu" (Nothingness),&lt;ref&gt;''Death Note'' chapter 107, pages 18–19&lt;/ref&gt; or rather ceases to exist. What Ryuk tried to say to Light at the beginning of the series was that not even a human who's used the Death Note can go to heaven or hell; like all other humans, when that human dies, it will cease to exist.

In [[Leven Thumps and the Gateway to Foo]], it's impossible to kill anyone intentionally in Foo; Sabine gets around this by causing third parties to take action which, unknown to them, will kill his intended victims.

'''Rock music''' is a broad genre of [[popular music]] that originated as "[[rock and roll]]" in the United States in the early 1950s, and developed into a range of different styles in the 1960s and later, particularly in the United Kingdom and in the United States.&lt;ref name=studwell&gt;W.E. Studwell and D.F. Lonergan, ''The Classic Rock and Roll Reader: Rock Music from its Beginnings to the mid-1970s'' (Abingdon: Routledge, 1999), {{ISBN|0-7890-0151-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{allmusic|explore|genre/pop-rock-d20|Pop/Rock}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has its roots in 1940s and 1950s rock and roll, a style which drew heavily on the genres of [[blues]], [[rhythm and blues]], and from [[country music]]. Rock music also drew strongly on a number of other genres such as [[electric blues]] and [[folk music|folk]], and incorporated influences from [[jazz]], [[classical music|classical]] and other musical styles. Musically, rock has centered on the [[electric guitar]], usually as part of a [[rock group]] with [[electric bass]], [[drum kit|drums]], and one or more [[singer]]s. Typically, rock is [[song]]-based music usually with a [[Time signature|4/4 time signature]] using a [[verse–chorus form]], but the genre has become extremely diverse. Like [[pop music]], lyrics often stress romantic love but also address a wide variety of other themes that are frequently social or political.

By the late 1960s "classic rock"&lt;ref name=studwell/&gt; period, a number of distinct rock music subgenres had emerged, including hybrids like [[blues rock]], [[folk rock]], [[country rock]], [[raga rock]], and [[jazz-rock]], many of which contributed to the development of [[psychedelic rock]], which was influenced by the [[counterculture of the 1960s|countercultural]] [[psychedelia|psychedelic and hippie scene]]. New genres that emerged included [[progressive rock]], which extended the artistic elements; [[glam rock]], which highlighted showmanship and visual style; and the diverse and enduring subgenre of [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]], which emphasized volume, power, and speed. In the second half of the 1970s, [[punk rock]] reacted by producing stripped-down, energetic social and political critiques. Punk was an influence in the 1980s on [[New wave music|new wave]], [[post-punk]] and eventually [[alternative rock]]. From the 1990s alternative rock began to dominate rock music and break into the mainstream in the form of [[grunge]], [[Britpop]], and [[indie rock]]. Further fusion subgenres have since emerged, including [[pop punk]], [[electronic rock]], [[rap rock]], and [[rap metal]], as well as conscious attempts to revisit rock's history, including the [[garage rock]]/[[post-punk revival|post-punk]] and [[techno-pop]] revivals at the beginning of the 2000s.

Rock music has also embodied and served as the vehicle for cultural and social movements, leading to major subcultures including [[mod (subculture)|mods]] and [[rocker (subculture)|rockers]] in the UK and the [[hippie]] counterculture that spread out from San Francisco in the US in the 1960s. Similarly, 1970s [[punk culture]] spawned the [[goth subculture|goth]], [[Punk subculture|punk]], and [[emo]] subcultures. Inheriting the folk tradition of the [[protest song]], rock music has been associated with political activism as well as changes in social attitudes to race, sex and drug use, and is often seen as an expression of youth revolt against adult [[consumerism]] and [[conformity]].

The sound of rock is traditionally centered on the [[guitar amplifier|amplified]] [[electric guitar]], which emerged in its modern form in the 1950s with the popularity of rock and roll.&lt;ref&gt;J.M. Curtis, ''Rock Eras: Interpretations of Music and Society, 1954–1984'' (Madison, WI: Popular Press, 1987), {{ISBN|0-87972-369-6}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;68–73.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, it was influenced by the sounds of [[electric blues]] guitarists.&lt;ref name=campbell&gt;Michael Campbell &amp; James Brody, [https://books.google.com/books?id=RK-JmVbv4OIC&amp;pg=PA80 Rock and Roll: An Introduction], pp. 80–81&lt;/ref&gt; The sound of an electric guitar in rock music is typically supported by an electric [[bass guitar]], which pioneered in jazz music in the same era,&lt;ref&gt;{{source in source |author=R.C. Brewer |title=Bass Guitar |editor=Shepherd |year=2003 |page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; and percussion produced from a [[drum kit]] that combines drums and cymbals.&lt;ref&gt;{{source in source |author=R. Mattingly |title=Drum Set |editor=Shepherd |year=2003 |page=361}}&lt;/ref&gt; This trio of instruments has often been complemented by the inclusion of other instruments, particularly keyboards such as the [[piano]], the [[Hammond organ]], and the [[synthesizer]].&lt;ref&gt;P. Théberge, ''Any Sound you can Imagine: Making Music/Consuming Technology'' (Middletown, CT, Wesleyan University Press, 1997), {{ISBN|0-8195-6309-9}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;69–70.&lt;/ref&gt; The basic rock instrumentation was derived from the basic [[blues]] band instrumentation (prominent [[lead guitar]], second chordal instrument, bass, and drums).&lt;ref name=campbell/&gt; A group of musicians performing rock music is termed as a [[rock band]] or a [[rock group]]. Furthermore,  it typically consists of between three (the [[power trio]]) and five members. Classically, a rock band takes the form of a [[quartet]] whose members cover one or more roles, including [[vocals|vocalist]], [[lead guitar]]ist, [[rhythm guitar]]ist, [[bass guitarist]], [[drummer]], and often [[keyboard player]] or other [[instrumentalist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{source in source |author=D. Laing |title=Quartet |editor=Shepherd |year=2003 |page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rock music is traditionally built on a foundation of simple unsyncopated rhythms in a 4/4 [[Meter (music)|meter]](This can be seen in Common Crisis' hit song "Sling Your Hook"), with a repetitive snare drum [[Backbeat (music)|back beat]] on beats two and four.&lt;ref name=Ammer2004&gt;C. Ammer, ''The Facts on File Dictionary of Music'' (New York: Infobase, 4th edn., 2004), {{ISBN|0-8160-5266-2}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;251–52.&lt;/ref&gt; Melodies often originate from older [[musical modes]] such as the [[Dorian mode|Dorian]] and [[Mixolydian]], as well as [[Major scale|major]] and [[Minor mode|minor]] modes. Harmonies range from the common [[Triad (music)|triad]] to parallel [[perfect fourth]]s and [[Perfect fifth|fifths]] and dissonant harmonic progressions.&lt;ref name=Ammer2004/&gt; Since the late 1950s&lt;ref&gt;Michael Campbell &amp; James Brody (2007), ''Rock and Roll: An Introduction'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=RK-JmVbv4OIC&amp;pg=PA117 p. 117]&lt;/ref&gt; and particularly from the mid 1960s onwards, rock music often used the [[Verse-chorus form|verse-chorus structure]] derived from blues and folk music, but there has been considerable variation from this model.&lt;ref&gt;J. Covach, "From craft to art: formal structure in the music of the Beatles", in K. Womack and Todd F. Davis, eds, ''Reading the Beatles: Cultural Studies, Literary Criticism, and the Fab Four'' (New York: SUNY Press, 2006), {{ISBN|0-7914-6715-5}}, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; Critics have stressed the eclecticism and stylistic diversity of rock.&lt;ref&gt;T. Gracyk, ''Rhythm and Noise: an Aesthetics of Rock'', (London: I.B. Tauris, 1996), {{ISBN|1-86064-090-7}}, p. xi.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of its complex history and its tendency to borrow from other musical and cultural forms, it has been argued that "it is impossible to bind rock music to a rigidly delineated musical definition."&lt;ref&gt;P. Wicke, ''Rock Music: Culture, Aesthetics and Sociology'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1990), {{ISBN|0-521-39914-9}}, p. x.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike many earlier styles of popular music, rock lyrics have dealt with a wide range of themes, including romantic love, sex, rebellion against "[[The Establishment]]", social concerns, and life styles.&lt;ref name=Ammer2004/&gt; These themes were inherited from a variety of sources such as the [[Tin Pan Alley]] pop tradition, folk music, and rhythm and blues.&lt;ref&gt;B.A. Farber, ''Rock 'n' roll Wisdom: What Psychologically Astute Lyrics Teach About Life and Love'' (Westport, CT: Greenwood, 2007), {{ISBN|0-275-99164-4}}, pp. xxvi–xxviii.&lt;/ref&gt; Music journalist [[Robert Christgau]] characterizes rock lyrics as a "cool medium" with simple diction and repeated refrains, and asserts that rock's primary "function" "pertains to music, or, more generally, [[noise in music|noise]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Robert Christgau|Christgau, Robert]]|editor-last=McKeen|editor-first=William|editor-link=William McKeen|year= 2000|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pJaU7NnALYYC&amp;pg=PA562#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Rock &amp; Roll Is Here to Stay: An Anthology|publisher=[[W.W.

Waksman, ''Instruments of Desire: the Electric Guitar and the Shaping of Musical Experience'' (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2001), {{ISBN|0-674-00547-3}}, p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, it has also been seen to articulate the concerns of this group in both style and lyrics.&lt;ref&gt;S. Frith, ''Taking Popular Music Seriously: Selected Essays'' (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2007), {{ISBN|0-7546-2679-2}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;43–44.&lt;/ref&gt; Christgau, writing in 1972, said in spite of some exceptions, "rock and roll usually implies an identification of male sexuality and aggression".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Christgau|first=Robert|date=11 June 1972|url=https://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/news/nd720611.php|title=Tuning Out, Tuning In, Turning On|newspaper=[[Newsday]]|accessdate=17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the term “rock” started being used in preference to “rock and roll” from the late-1960s, it has usually been contrasted with pop music, with which it has shared many characteristics, but from which it is often distanced by an emphasis on musicianship, live performance, and a focus on serious and progressive themes as part of an ideology of [[Authenticity (philosophy)|authenticity]] that is frequently combined with an awareness of the genre's history and development.&lt;ref name=Warner2003&gt;T. Warner, ''Pop Music: Technology and Creativity: Trevor Horn and the Digital Revolution'' (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2003), {{ISBN|0-7546-3132-X}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;3–4.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Simon Frith]], rock was “something more than pop, something more than rock and roll” and “[r]ock musicians combined an emphasis on skill and technique with the romantic concept of art as artistic expression, original and sincere".&lt;ref name=Warner2003/&gt; In the new millennium, the term ''rock'' has occasionally been used as a [[blanket term]] including forms like [[pop music]], [[reggae music]], [[soul music]], and even [[hip hop]], which it has been influenced with but often contrasted through much of its history.&lt;ref&gt;R. Beebe, D. Fulbrook and B. Saunders, "Introduction" in R. Beebe, D. Fulbrook, B. Saunders, eds, ''Rock Over the Edge: Transformations in Popular Music Culture'' (Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 2002), {{ISBN|0-8223-2900-X}}, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==1950s: Rock and roll==

{{See also|Origins of rock and roll|Rockabilly}}

The foundations of rock music are in rock and roll, which originated in the United States during the late 1940s and early 1950s, and quickly spread to much of the rest of the world. Its immediate origins lay in a melding of various [[African-American music|black musical]] genres of the time, including [[rhythm and blues]] and [[gospel music]], with [[country music|country and western]].&lt;ref name="Bogdanov2002BrithofR&amp;R"&gt;R. Unterberger, "Birth of Rock &amp; Roll", in [[#CITEREFBogdanovWoodstraErlewine2002|Bogdanov et al., 2002]], pp.&amp;nbsp;1303–04.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951, [[Cleveland|Cleveland, Ohio]] disc jockey [[Alan Freed]] began playing rhythm and blues music (then termed "[[race record|race music]]") for a multi-racial audience, and is credited with first using the phrase "rock and roll" to describe the music.&lt;ref&gt;T.E. Scheurer, ''American Popular Music: The Age of Rock'' (Madison, WI: Popular Press, 1989), {{ISBN|0-87972-468-4}}, p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt;

Debate surrounds which record should be considered the [[first rock and roll record]]. Contenders include [[Goree Carter]]'s "[[:File:Goree Carter - Rock Awhile.ogg|Rock Awhile]]" (1949);&lt;ref name="palmer19"&gt;[[Robert Palmer (writer)|Robert Palmer]], "Church of the Sonic Guitar", pp.&amp;nbsp;13–38 in Anthony DeCurtis, ''Present Tense'', [[Duke University Press]], 1992, p. 19. {{ISBN|0-8223-1265-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jimmy Preston]]'s "[[Rock the Joint]]" (1949), which was later [[cover version|covered]] by [[Bill Haley &amp; His Comets]] in 1952;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Bill Dahl |title=Jimmy Preston |journal=Allmusic |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/p115739 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/67EOmJC71?url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/p115739 |archivedate=27 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and "[[Rocket 88]]" by [[Jackie Brenston]] and his Delta Cats (in fact, [[Ike Turner]] and his band the [[Kings of Rhythm]]), recorded by [[Sam Phillips]] for [[Sun Records]] in 1951.&lt;ref name=Campbell2008&gt;M.

It has also been argued that "[[That's All Right (Mama)]]" (1954), [[Elvis Presley]]'s first single for Sun Records in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], could be the first rock and roll record,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=N.

Other artists with early rock and roll hits included [[Chuck Berry]], [[Bo Diddley]], [[Fats Domino]], [[Little Richard]], [[Jerry Lee Lewis]], and [[Gene Vincent]].&lt;ref name=Campbell2008/&gt; Soon rock and roll was the major force in American record sales and [[crooner]]s, such as [[Eddie Fisher (singer)|Eddie Fisher]], [[Perry Como]], and [[Patti Page]], who had dominated the previous decade of popular music, found their access to the pop charts significantly curtailed.&lt;ref&gt;R.S. Denisoff, W.L. Schurk, ''Tarnished Gold: the Record Industry Revisited'' (New Brunswick, NJ: Transaction, 3rd edn., 1986), {{ISBN|0-88738-618-0}}, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rock and roll has been seen as leading to a number of distinct subgenres, including rockabilly, combining rock and roll with "hillbilly" country music, which was usually played and recorded in the mid-1950s by white singers such as [[Carl Perkins]], Jerry Lee Lewis, [[Buddy Holly]] and with the greatest commercial success, Elvis Presley.&lt;ref name=AllmusicRbilly&gt;{{Citation|last= |title=Rockabilly |journal=Allmusic |url={{Allmusic|class=explore|id=style/d187|pure_url=yes}} |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5wQb3jHWo?url=http://www.allmusic.com/explore/style/d187 |archivedate=11 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast [[doo wop]] placed an emphasis on multi-part vocal harmonies and meaningless backing lyrics (from which the genre later gained its name), which were usually supported with light instrumentation and had its origins in 1930s and 1940s African American vocal groups.&lt;ref name="R. Shuker, 2005 p. 35"&gt;R. Shuker, ''Popular Music: the Key Concepts'' (Abingdon: Routledge, 2nd edn., 2005), {{ISBN|0-415-34770-X}}, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Acts like [[the Crows]], [[the Penguins]], [[the El Dorados]] and [[the Turbans]] all scored major hits, and groups like [[the Platters]], with songs including "[[The Great Pretender]]" (1955),{{sfn |Gilliland |1969 |loc=show 5, track 3}} and [[the Coasters]] with humorous songs like "[[Yakety Yak]]" (1958),{{sfn |Gilliland |1969 |loc=show 13}} ranked among the most successful rock and roll acts of the period.&lt;ref name=Bogdanov2002DooWop/&gt;

The era also saw the growth in popularity of the [[electric guitar]], and the development of a specifically rock and roll style of playing through such exponents as Chuck Berry, [[Link Wray]], and [[Scotty Moore]].&lt;ref&gt;J.

Commentators have traditionally perceived a decline of rock and roll in the late 1950s and early 1960s. By 1959, the death of Buddy Holly, [[The Big Bopper]] and [[Ritchie Valens]] in a plane crash, the departure of Elvis for the army, the retirement of Little Richard to become a preacher, prosecutions of Jerry Lee Lewis and Chuck Berry and the breaking of the [[payola]] scandal (which implicated major figures, including Alan Freed, in bribery and corruption in promoting individual acts or songs), gave a sense that the rock and roll era established at that point had come to an end.&lt;ref name=Campbell2008p99&gt;M.

The term ''pop'' has been used since the early 20th century to refer to popular music in general, but from the mid-1950s it began to be used for a distinct genre, aimed at a youth market, often characterized as a softer alternative to rock and roll.&lt;ref name=Firth2001&gt;S.

Also significant was the advent of [[soul music]] as a major commercial force.

[[File:Sullivan Beach Boys.jpg|thumb|left|[[The Beach Boys]] performing in 1964]]

The instrumental rock and roll of performers such as [[Duane Eddy]], Link Wray and [[the Ventures]] was developed by [[Dick Dale]], who added distinctive "wet" [[reverb]], rapid alternate picking, and [[Middle Eastern music|Middle Eastern]] and [[Music of Mexico|Mexican]] influences. He produced the regional hit "[[Let's Go Trippin']]" in 1961 and launched the surf music craze, following up with songs like "[[Misirlou]]" (1962).&lt;ref name="blair2"/&gt; Like Dale and his [[Del-Tones]], most early surf bands were formed in Southern California, including the [[Bel-Airs]], the [[The Challengers (band)|Challengers]], and [[Eddie &amp; the Showmen]].&lt;ref name="blair2"&gt;J.

Surf music achieved its greatest commercial success as vocal music, particularly the work of [[the Beach Boys]], formed in 1961 in Southern California. Their early albums included both instrumental surf rock (among them covers of music by Dick Dale) and vocal songs, drawing on rock and roll and [[doo wop]] and the close harmonies of vocal pop acts like the [[Four Freshmen]].{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Their first chart hit, "[[Surfin']]" in 1962 reached the ''Billboard'' top 100 and helped make the surf music craze a national phenomenon.&lt;ref name=Bogdanov2002Beachboys&gt;W.

By the end of 1962, what would become the British rock scene had started with [[beat music|beat groups]] like [[The Beatles]], [[Gerry &amp; the Pacemakers]] and [[The Searchers (band)|the Searchers]] from Liverpool and [[Freddie and the Dreamers]], [[Herman's Hermits]] and [[the Hollies]] from Manchester.

Chambers, ''Urban Rhythms: Pop Music and Popular Culture'' (Basingstoke: Macmillan, 1985), {{ISBN|0-333-34011-6}}, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; and particularly those from London like [[the Rolling Stones]] and [[the Yardbirds]], were much more directly influenced by rhythm and blues and later blues music.&lt;ref&gt;J.R.

Beat bands tended towards "bouncy, irresistible melodies", while early [[British blues]] acts tended towards less sexually innocent, more aggressive songs, often adopting an anti-establishment stance. There was, however, particularly in the early stages, considerable musical crossover between the two tendencies.&lt;ref name=Bogdanov2002BI/&gt; By 1963, led by the Beatles, beat groups had begun to achieve national success in Britain, soon to be followed into the charts by the more rhythm and blues focused acts.&lt;ref name=Bogdanov2002BritishR&amp;B&gt;R.

The style had been evolving from regional scenes as early as 1958. "Tall Cool One" (1959) by [[The Wailers (rock band)|The Wailers]] and "[[Louie Louie]]" by [[the Kingsmen]] (1963) are mainstream examples of the genre in its formative stages.&lt;ref&gt;

Although the first impact of the British Invasion on American popular music was through beat and R&amp;B based acts, the impetus was soon taken up by a second wave of bands that drew their inspiration more directly from American [[blues]], including the Rolling Stones and the Yardbirds.&lt;ref&gt;H.S. Macpherson, ''Britain and the Americas: Culture, Politics, and History'' (Oxford: ABC-CLIO, 2005), {{ISBN|1-85109-431-8}}, p. 626.&lt;/ref&gt; British blues musicians of the late 1950s and early 1960s had been inspired by the acoustic playing of figures such as [[Lead Belly]], who was a major influence on the Skiffle craze, and [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]].&lt;ref&gt;V. Coelho, ''The Cambridge Companion to the Guitar'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003), {{ISBN|0-521-00040-8}}, p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; Increasingly they adopted a loud amplified sound, often  centered on the electric guitar, based on the [[Chicago blues]], particularly after the tour of Britain by [[Muddy Waters]] in 1958, which prompted [[Cyril Davies]] and guitarist [[Alexis Korner]] to form the band [[Blues Incorporated]].&lt;ref name=Bogdanov2003BluesRock&gt;R. Uterberger, "Blues Rock", in V. Bogdanov, C. Woodstra, S.T.

The other key focus for British blues was [[John Mayall]]; his band, [[John Mayall &amp; the Bluesbreakers|the Bluesbreakers]], included [[Eric Clapton]] (after his departure from the Yardbirds) and later [[Peter Green (musician)|Peter Green]]. Particularly significant was the release of ''[[Blues Breakers with Eric Clapton]] (Beano)'' album (1966), considered one of the seminal British blues recordings and the sound of which was much emulated in both Britain and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;T. Rawlings, A. Neill, C. Charlesworth and C. White, ''Then, Now and Rare British Beat 1960–1969'' (London: Omnibus Press, 2002), {{ISBN|0-7119-9094-8}}, p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt; Eric Clapton went on to form supergroups Cream, [[Blind Faith]] and [[Derek and the Dominos]], followed by an extensive solo career that helped bring blues rock into the [[Mainstream (terminology)|mainstream]].&lt;ref name=Bogdanov2003BluesRock/&gt; Green, along with the Bluesbreaker's rhythm section [[Mick Fleetwood]] and [[John McVie]], formed Peter Green's [[Fleetwood Mac]], who enjoyed some of the greatest commercial success in the genre.&lt;ref name=Bogdanov2003BluesRock/&gt; In the late 1960s [[Jeff Beck]], also an alumnus of the Yardbirds, moved blues rock in the direction of heavy rock with his band, [[the Jeff Beck Group]].&lt;ref name=Bogdanov2003BluesRock/&gt; The last Yardbirds guitarist was [[Jimmy Page]], who went on to form ''The New Yardbirds'' which rapidly became [[Led Zeppelin]]. Many of the songs on their first three albums, and occasionally later in their careers, were expansions on traditional blues songs.&lt;ref name=Bogdanov2003BluesRock/&gt;

In America, blues rock had been pioneered in the early 1960s by guitarist [[Lonnie Mack]],&lt;ref&gt;P. Prown, H.P. Newquist and J.F. Eiche, ''Legends of Rock Guitar: the Essential Reference of Rock's Greatest Guitarists'' (Milwaukee, WI: Hal Leonard Corporation, 1997), {{ISBN|0-7935-4042-9}}, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; but the genre began to take off in the mid-1960s as acts developed a sound similar to British blues musicians. Key acts included [[Paul Butterfield]] (whose band acted like Mayall's Bluesbreakers in Britain as a starting point for many successful musicians), [[Canned Heat]], the early [[Jefferson Airplane]], [[Janis Joplin]], [[Johnny Winter]], [[the J. Geils Band]] and [[Jimi Hendrix]] with his [[power trios]], the Jimi Hendrix Experience and [[Band of Gypsys]], whose guitar virtuosity and showmanship would be among the most emulated of the decade.&lt;ref name=Bogdanov2003BluesRock/&gt; Blues rock bands from the southern states, like the [[Allman Brothers Band]], [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]], and [[ZZ Top]], incorporated country elements into their style to produce distinctive [[Southern rock]].&lt;ref name=Bogdanov2002SouthernRock&gt;R. Unterberger, "Southern Rock", in [[#CITEREFBogdanovWoodstraErlewine2002|Bogdanov et al., 2002]], pp.&amp;nbsp;1332–33.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early blues rock bands often emulated jazz, playing long, involved improvisations, which would later be a major element of progressive rock. From about 1967 bands like Cream and the Jimi Hendrix Experience had moved away from purely blues-based music into [[psychedelic music|psychedelia]].&lt;ref name="amg" /&gt; By the 1970s, blues rock had become heavier and more riff-based, exemplified by the work of Led Zeppelin and [[Deep Purple]], and the lines between blues rock and [[hard rock]] "were barely visible",&lt;ref name="amg" /&gt; as bands began recording rock-style albums.&lt;ref name="amg"&gt;{{Citation|last= |title=Blues-rock |journal=Allmusic |url={{Allmusic|class=explore|id=style/d50|pure_url=yes}} |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5wR7EB7K0?url=http://www.allmusic.com/explore/style/d50 |archivedate=12 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The genre was continued in the 1970s by figures such as [[George Thorogood]] and [[Pat Travers]],&lt;ref name=Bogdanov2003BluesRock/&gt; but, particularly on the British scene (except perhaps for the advent of groups such as [[Status Quo (band)|Status Quo]] and [[Foghat]] who moved towards a form of high energy and repetitive [[boogie rock]]), bands became focused on [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] innovation, and blues rock began to slip out of the mainstream.&lt;ref&gt;P.

By the 1960s, the scene that had developed out of the [[American folk music revival]] had grown to a major movement, utilising traditional music and new compositions in a traditional style, usually on acoustic instruments.&lt;ref name=Mitchell2007p95&gt;G.

Mitchell, ''The North American Folk Music Revival: Nation and Identity in the United States and Canada, 1945–1980'' (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2007), {{ISBN|0-7546-5756-6}}, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; Dylan had begun to reach a mainstream audience with hits including "[[Blowin' in the Wind]]" (1963) and "[[Masters of War]]" (1963), which brought "[[protest song]]s" to a wider public,&lt;ref&gt;J.E. Perone, ''Music of the Counterculture Era American History Through Music'' (Westwood, CT: Greenwood, 2004), {{ISBN|0-313-32689-4}}, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; but, although beginning to influence each other, rock and folk music had remained largely separate genres, often with mutually exclusive audiences.&lt;ref name=Bogdanov2002FolkRock&gt;R. Unterberger, "Folk Rock", in [[#CITEREFBogdanovWoodstraErlewine2002|Bogdanov et al., 2002]], pp.&amp;nbsp;1308–09.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early attempts to combine elements of folk and rock included the Animals' "[[House of the Rising Sun]]" (1964), which was the first commercially successful folk song to be recorded with rock and roll instrumentation&lt;ref&gt;J.E. Perone, ''Mods, Rockers, and the Music of the British Invasion'' (Oxford: ABC-CLIO, 2009), {{ISBN|0-275-99860-6}}, p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Beatles "[[I'm a Loser]]" (1964), arguably the first Beatles song to be influenced directly by Dylan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=R.

These acts directly influenced British performers like Donovan and [[Fairport Convention]].&lt;ref name=Bogdanov2002FolkRock/&gt; In 1969 Fairport Convention abandoned their mixture of American covers and Dylan-influenced songs to play traditional English folk music on electric instruments.&lt;ref&gt;M. Brocken, ''The British Folk Revival 1944–2002'' (Ashgate, Aldershot, 2003), {{ISBN|0-7546-3282-2}}, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; This British folk rock was taken up by bands including [[Pentangle (band)|Pentangle]], [[Steeleye Span]] and [[the Albion Band]], which in turn prompted Irish groups like [[Horslips]] and Scottish acts like the [[JSD Band]], Spencer's Feat and later [[Five Hand Reel]], to use their traditional music to create a brand of [[Celtic rock]] in the early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;C. Larkin, ''The Guinness Encyclopedia of Popular Music'' (London: Guinness, 1992), {{ISBN|1-882267-04-4}}, p. 869.&lt;/ref&gt;

Folk rock reached its peak of commercial popularity in the period 1967–68, before many acts moved off in a variety of directions, including Dylan and the Byrds, who began to develop [[country rock]].&lt;ref&gt;G.W. Haslam, A.H. Russell and R. Chon, ''Workin' Man Blues: Country Music in California'' (Berkeley CA: Heyday Books, 2005), {{ISBN|0-520-21800-0}}, p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the hybridization of folk and rock has been seen as having a major influence on the development of rock music, bringing in elements of psychedelia, and helping to develop the ideas of the singer-songwriter, the protest song and concepts of "authenticity".&lt;ref name=Bogdanov2002FolkRock/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;K.

In the late 1960s jazz rock emerged as a distinct subgenre out of the blues rock, psychedelic and progressive rock scenes, mixing the power of rock with the musical complexity and improvisational elements of jazz. [[AllMusic]] states that the term jazz-rock "may refer to the loudest, wildest, most electrified fusion bands from the jazz camp, but most often it describes performers coming from the rock side of the equation." Jazz rock "...generally grew out of the most artistically ambitious rock subgenres of the late '60s and early '70s", including the [[singer-songwriter]] movement.&lt;ref name="AMJazzRock" /&gt; Many early US rock and roll musicians had begun in jazz and carried some of these elements into the new music. In Britain the subgenre of blues rock, and many of its leading figures, like [[Ginger Baker]] and [[Jack Bruce]] of the [[Eric Clapton]]-fronted band [[Cream (band)|Cream]], had emerged from the [[British jazz]] scene. Often highlighted as the first true jazz-rock recording is the only album by the relatively obscure New York-based [[the Free Spirits]] with ''Out of Sight and Sound'' (1966). The first group of bands to self-consciously use the label were R&amp;B oriented white rock bands that made use of jazzy horn sections, like [[Electric Flag]], Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears and [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]], to become some of the most commercially successful acts of the later 1960s and early 1970s.&lt;ref name=Bogdanov2002JazzRock/&gt;

British acts to emerge in the same period from the blues scene, to make use of the tonal and improvisational aspects of jazz, included [[Nucleus (band)|Nucleus]]&lt;ref&gt;I. Carr, D. Fairweather and B.

From the psychedelic rock and the Canterbury scenes came Soft Machine, who, it has been suggested, produced one of the artistically successfully fusions of the two genres. Perhaps the most critically acclaimed fusion came from the jazz side of the equation, with [[Miles Davis]], particularly influenced by the work of Hendrix, incorporating rock instrumentation into his sound for the album ''[[Bitches Brew]]'' (1970). It was a major influence on subsequent rock-influenced jazz artists, including [[Herbie Hancock]], [[Chick Corea]] and [[Weather Report]].&lt;ref name=Bogdanov2002JazzRock/&gt; The genre began to fade in the late 1970s, as a mellower form of fusion began to take its audience,&lt;ref name=AMJazzRock&gt;{{Citation|last= |title=Jazz-Rock Music Genre Overview |journal=Allmusic |url=http://www.allmusic.com/explore/style/jazz-rock-d2776 |archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/5wRb6iIh2?url=http://www.allmusic.com/explore/style/jazz-rock-d2776 |archivedate =12 February 2011 |deadurl=no|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but acts like [[Steely Dan]],&lt;ref name=AMJazzRock/&gt; Frank Zappa and [[Joni Mitchell]] recorded significant jazz-influenced albums in this period, and it has continued to be a major influence on rock music.&lt;ref name=Bogdanov2002JazzRock&gt;R.

Roots rock is the term now used to describe a move away from what some saw as the excesses of the psychedelic scene, to a more basic form of rock and roll that incorporated its original influences, particularly country and folk music, leading to the creation of country rock and Southern rock.&lt;ref&gt;P. Auslander, ''Liveness: Performance in a Mediatized Culture'' (Abingdon: Routledge, 2008), {{ISBN|0-415-77353-9}}, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966 Bob Dylan went to [[Nashville]] to record the album ''[[Blonde on Blonde]]''.&lt;ref name=Wolff2000/&gt; This, and subsequent more clearly country-influenced albums, have been seen as creating the genre of [[country folk]], a route pursued by a number of largely acoustic folk musicians.&lt;ref name=Wolff2000&gt;K. Wolff and O. Duane, ''Country Music: The Rough Guide'' (London: Rough Guides, 2000), {{ISBN|1-85828-534-8}}, p. 392.&lt;/ref&gt; Other acts that followed the back-to-basics trend were the Canadian group [[the Band]] and the California-based [[Creedence Clearwater Revival]], both of which mixed basic rock and roll with folk, country and blues, to be among the most successful and influential bands of the late 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;R. Unterberger, "The Band", and S.T. Erlewine, "Creedence Clearwater Revival", in [[#CITEREFBogdanovWoodstraErlewine2002|Bogdanov et al., 2002]], pp.&amp;nbsp;61–62, 265-66.&lt;/ref&gt; The same movement saw the beginning of the recording careers of Californian solo artists like [[Ry Cooder]], [[Bonnie Raitt]] and [[Lowell George]],&lt;ref&gt;B. Hoskyns, ''Hotel California: The True-Life Adventures of Crosby, Stills, Nash, Young, Mitchell, Taylor, Browne, Ronstadt, Geffen, the Eagles, and Their Many Friends'' (John Wiley and Sons, 2007), {{ISBN|0-470-12777-5}}, pp. 87–90.&lt;/ref&gt; and influenced the work of established performers such as the Rolling Stones' ''[[Beggar's Banquet]]'' (1968) and the Beatles' ''[[Let It Be (The Beatles album)|Let It Be]]'' (1970).&lt;ref name=Bogdanov2002Psych/&gt;

[[File:Eagles.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A color photograph of four members of the Eagles on stage with guitars|The [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]] during their 2008–2009 [[Long Road out of Eden Tour]] ]]
In 1968, [[Gram Parsons]] recorded ''[[Safe at Home]]'' with the [[International Submarine Band]], arguably the first true [[country rock]] album.&lt;ref name=Bogdanov2002C-Rock&gt;R. Unterberger, "Country Rock", in [[#CITEREFBogdanovWoodstraErlewine2002|Bogdanov et al., 2002]], p. 1327.&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year he joined the Byrds for ''[[Sweetheart of the Rodeo]]'' (1968), generally considered one of the most influential recordings in the genre.&lt;ref name=Bogdanov2002C-Rock/&gt; The Byrds continued in the same vein, but Parsons left to be joined by another ex-Byrds member [[Chris Hillman]] in forming [[the Flying Burrito Brothers]] who helped establish the respectability and parameters of the genre, before Parsons departed to pursue a solo career.&lt;ref name=Bogdanov2002C-Rock/&gt; Bands in California that adopted country rock included Hearts and Flowers, [[Poco]], [[New Riders of the Purple Sage]],&lt;ref name=Bogdanov2002C-Rock/&gt; the [[Beau Brummels]],&lt;ref name=Bogdanov2002C-Rock/&gt; and the [[Nitty Gritty Dirt Band]].&lt;ref&gt;B.

The founders of Southern rock are usually thought to be the Allman Brothers Band, who developed a distinctive sound, largely derived from [[blues rock]], but incorporating elements of [[boogie]], soul, and country in the early 1970s.&lt;ref name=Bogdanov2002SouthernRock/&gt; The most successful act to follow them were Lynyrd Skynyrd, who helped establish the "[[Good ol' boy]]" image of the subgenre and the general shape of 1970s' guitar rock.&lt;ref name=Bogdanov2002SouthernRock/&gt; Their successors included the fusion/progressive instrumentalists [[Dixie Dregs]], the more country-influenced [[Outlaws (band)|Outlaws]], jazz-leaning [[Wet Willie]] and (incorporating elements of R&amp;B and gospel) the [[Ozark Mountain Daredevils]].&lt;ref name=Bogdanov2002SouthernRock/&gt; After the loss of original members of the Allmans and Lynyrd Skynyrd, the genre began to fade in popularity in the late 1970s, but was sustained the 1980s with acts like [[.38 Special (band)|.38 Special]], [[Molly Hatchet]] and [[the Marshall Tucker Band]].&lt;ref name=Bogdanov2002SouthernRock/&gt;

Glam rock emerged from the English psychedelic and art rock scenes of the late 1960s and can be seen as both an extension of and reaction against those trends.&lt;ref name=Shuker2005pp124-5/&gt; Musically diverse, varying between the simple rock and roll revivalism of figures like [[Alvin Stardust]] to the complex art rock of Roxy Music, and can be seen as much as a fashion as a musical subgenre.&lt;ref name=Shuker2005pp124-5&gt;R.

Auslander, ''Performing Glam Rock: Gender and Theatricality in Popular Music'' (Ann Arbor, MI: University of Michigan Press, 2006), {{ISBN|0-7546-4057-4}}, pp. 57, 63, 87 and 141.&lt;/ref&gt; Glam is most noted for its sexual and gender ambiguity and representations of [[androgyny]], beside extensive use of theatrics.&lt;ref name=AllmusicGR&gt;{{Citation|last= |title=Glam rock |journal=Allmusic |url={{Allmusic|class=explore|id=style/d388|pure_url=yes}} |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5wS7OGLm4?url=http://www.allmusic.com/explore/style/d388 |archivedate=12 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; It was prefigured by the showmanship and gender-identity manipulation of American acts such as [[the Cockettes]] and [[Alice Cooper]].&lt;ref&gt;P. Auslander, ''Performing Glam Rock: Gender and Theatricality in Popular Music'' (Ann Arbor, MI: University of Michigan Press, 2006), {{ISBN|0-472-06868-7}}, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

The origins of glam rock are associated with [[Marc Bolan]], who had renamed his folk duo to [[T. Rex (band)|T. Rex]] and taken up electric instruments by the end of the 1960s. Often cited as the moment of inception is his appearance on the UK TV programme ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' in December 1970 wearing glitter, to perform what would be his first number 1 single "[[Ride a White Swan]]".&lt;ref&gt;P. Auslander, ''Performing Glam Rock: Gender and Theatricality in Popular Music'' (Ann Arbor, MI: University of Michigan Press, 2006), {{ISBN|0-472-06868-7}}, p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1971, already a minor star, [[David Bowie]] developed his Ziggy Stardust persona, incorporating elements of professional make up, mime and performance into his act.&lt;ref name=Auslander2006p72&gt;P.

Inglis, ed., ''Performance and Popular Music: History, Place and Time'' (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2006), {{ISBN|0-7546-4057-4}}, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; These performers were soon followed in the style by acts including Roxy Music, [[The Sweet|Sweet]], [[Slade]], [[Mott the Hoople]], [[Mud (band)|Mud]] and [[Alvin Stardust]].&lt;ref name=Auslander2006p72/&gt; While highly successful in the single charts in the UK, very few of these musicians were able to make a serious impact in the United States; Bowie was the major exception becoming an international superstar and prompting the adoption of glam styles among acts like [[Lou Reed]], [[Iggy Pop]], [[New York Dolls]] and [[Jobriath]], often known as "glitter rock" and with a darker lyrical content than their British counterparts.&lt;ref name=Auslander2006p80&gt;P.

From the late 1960s it became common to divide mainstream rock music into soft and hard rock.

From the late 1960s the term "heavy metal" began to be used to describe some hard rock played with even more volume and intensity, first as an adjective and by the early 1970s as a noun.&lt;ref&gt;R.

[[Led Zeppelin]] added elements of [[fantasy]] to their riff laden blues-rock, [[Deep Purple]] brought in symphonic and medieval interests from their progressive rock phase and [[Black Sabbath]] introduced facets of the [[gothic rock|gothic]] and [[Musical mode|modal harmony]], helping to produce a "darker" sound.&lt;ref name=Walser1993p10&gt;R.

Rock, mostly the heavy metal genre, has been criticized by some [[Christianity|Christian]] leaders, who have condemned it as immoral, anti-Christian and even demonic.&lt;ref&gt;J.J. Thompson, ''Raised by Wolves: the Story of Christian Rock &amp; Roll'' (Toronto: ECW Press, 2000), {{ISBN|1-55022-421-2}}, pp. 30–31.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Christian rock began to develop in the late 1960s, particularly out of the [[Jesus movement]] beginning in Southern California, and emerged as a subgenre in the 1970s with artists like [[Larry Norman]], usually seen as the first major "star" of Christian rock.&lt;ref&gt;J.R.

Punk rock was developed between 1974 and 1976 in the United States and the United Kingdom. Rooted in garage rock and other forms of what is now known as protopunk music, punk rock bands eschewed the perceived excesses of mainstream 1970s rock.&lt;ref name=BogdanovPunk&gt;J. Dougan, "Punk Music", in [[#CITEREFBogdanovWoodstraErlewine2002|Bogdanov et al., 2002]], pp.&amp;nbsp;1335–36.&lt;/ref&gt; They created fast, hard-edged music, typically with short songs, stripped-down instrumentation, and often political, anti-establishment lyrics. Punk embraces a [[DIY ethic|DIY (do it yourself) ethic]], with many bands self-producing their recordings and distributing them through informal channels.&lt;ref&gt;A. Rodel, "Extreme Noise Terror: Punk Rock and the Aesthetics of Badness", in C. Washburne and M. Derno, eds, ''Bad Music: The Music We Love to Hate'' (New York: Routledge), {{ISBN|0-415-94365-5}}, pp. 235–56.&lt;/ref&gt;

By late 1976, acts such as the [[Ramones]] and [[Patti Smith]], in New York City, and the [[Sex Pistols]] and [[the Clash]], in London, were recognized as the vanguard of a new musical movement.&lt;ref name=BogdanovPunk/&gt; The following year saw punk rock spreading around the world. Punk quickly, though briefly, became a major cultural phenomenon in the United Kingdom. For the most part, punk took root in local scenes that tended to reject association with the mainstream. An associated [[punk subculture]] emerged, expressing youthful rebellion and characterized by distinctive [[Punk fashion|clothing styles]] and a variety of [[Punk ideologies|anti-authoritarian ideologies]].&lt;ref&gt;R. Sabin, "Rethingking punk and racism", in R. Sabin, ed., ''Punk Rock: So What?: the Cultural Legacy of Punk'' (Abingdon: Routledge, 1999), {{ISBN|0-415-17029-X}}, p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the beginning of the 1980s, faster, more aggressive styles such as hardcore and [[Oi!]] had become the predominant mode of punk rock.&lt;ref&gt;H.A. Skott-Myhre, ''Youth and Subculture as Creative Force: Creating New Spaces for Radical Youth Work'' (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2009), {{ISBN|1-4426-0992-3}}, p. xi.&lt;/ref&gt; This has resulted in several evolved strains of hardcore punk, such as [[D-beat]] (a distortion-heavy subgenre influenced by the UK band [[Discharge (band)|Discharge]]), [[anarcho-punk]] (such as [[Crass (band)|Crass]]), [[grindcore]] (such as [[Napalm Death]]), and [[crust punk]].&lt;ref&gt;T.

If hardcore most directly pursued the stripped down aesthetic of punk, and new wave came to represent its commercial wing, post-punk emerged in the later 1970s and early 1980s as its more artistic and challenging side. Major influences beside punk bands were [[the Velvet Underground]], Frank Zappa and [[Captain Beefheart]], and the New York-based [[no wave]] scene which placed an emphasis on performance, including bands such as [[James Chance and the Contortions]], [[DNA (American band)|DNA]] and [[Sonic Youth]].&lt;ref name="Bogdanov2002PostPunk"&gt;S.T. Erlewine, "Post Punk", in [[#CITEREFBogdanovWoodstraErlewine2002|Bogdanov et al., 2002]], pp. 1337–8.&lt;/ref&gt; Early contributors to the genre included the US bands [[Pere Ubu]], Devo, [[the Residents]] and [[Talking Heads]].&lt;ref name="Bogdanov2002PostPunk"/&gt;

The first wave of British post-punk included [[Gang of Four (band)|Gang of Four]], [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]] and [[Joy Division]], who placed less emphasis on art than their US counterparts and more on the dark emotional qualities of their music.&lt;ref name="Bogdanov2002PostPunk"/&gt; Bands like Siouxsie and the Banshees, [[Bauhaus (band)|Bauhaus]], [[the Cure]], and [[the Sisters of Mercy]], moved increasingly in this direction to found Gothic rock, which had become the basis of a major [[sub-culture]] by the early 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;L.M.E.

Bibby, ''Goth: Undead Subculture'' (Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 2007), {{ISBN|0-8223-3921-8}}, p. 239.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar emotional territory was pursued by Australian acts like [[The Birthday Party (band)|the Birthday Party]] and [[Nick Cave]].&lt;ref name="Bogdanov2002PostPunk"/&gt; Members of Bauhaus and Joy Division explored new stylistic territory as [[Love and Rockets (band)|Love and Rockets]] and [[New Order (band)|New Order]] respectively.&lt;ref name="Bogdanov2002PostPunk"/&gt; Another early post-punk movement was the industrial music&lt;ref&gt;C.

The second generation of British post-punk bands that broke through in the early 1980s, including [[The Fall (band)|the Fall]], [[the Pop Group]], [[the Mekons]], [[Echo and the Bunnymen]] and the [[Teardrop Explodes]], tended to move away from dark sonic landscapes.&lt;ref name="Bogdanov2002PostPunk"/&gt; Arguably the most successful band to emerge from post-punk was Ireland's [[U2]], who incorporated elements of religious imagery together with political commentary into their often anthemic music, and by the late 1980s had become one of the biggest bands in the world.&lt;ref&gt;F.W.

American working-class oriented heartland rock, characterized by a straightforward musical style, and a concern with the lives of ordinary, [[blue-collar]] American people, developed in the second half of the 1970s. The term heartland rock was first used to describe [[American Midwest|Midwestern]] [[arena rock]] groups like [[Kansas (band)|Kansas]], [[REO Speedwagon]] and Styx, but which came to be associated with a more socially concerned form of roots rock more directly influenced by folk, country and rock and roll.&lt;ref&gt;R. Kirkpatrick, ''The Words and Music of Bruce Springsteen'' (Santa Barbara, CA: Greenwood, 2007), {{ISBN|0-275-98938-0}}, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been seen as an American Midwest and [[Rust Belt]] counterpart to West Coast country rock and the Southern rock of the American South.&lt;ref&gt;G.

Exemplified by the commercial success of singer songwriters [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[Bob Seger]], and [[Tom Petty]], along with less widely known acts such as [[Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes]] and [[Joe Grushecky|Joe Grushecky and the Houserockers]], it was partly a reaction to post-industrial urban decline in the East and Mid-West, often dwelling on issues of social disintegration and isolation, beside a form of good-time rock and roll revivalism.&lt;ref name=AllmusicHeartland/&gt; The genre reached its commercial, artistic and influential peak in the mid-1980s, with Springsteen's ''[[Born in the USA]]'' (1984), topping the charts worldwide and spawning a series of top ten singles, together with the arrival of artists including [[John Mellencamp]], [[Steve Earle]] and more gentle singer-songwriters such as [[Bruce Hornsby]].&lt;ref name=AllmusicHeartland/&gt; It can also be heard as an influence on artists as diverse as [[Billy Joel]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=J.A.

Heartland rock faded away as a recognized genre by the early 1990s, as rock music in general, and blue collar and white working class themes in particular, lost influence with younger audiences, and as heartland's artists turned to more personal works.&lt;ref name=AllmusicHeartland/&gt; Many heartland rock artists continue to record today with critical and commercial success, most notably Bruce Springsteen, Tom Petty and John Mellencamp, although their works have become more personal and experimental and no longer fit easily into a single genre. Newer artists whose music would perhaps have been labelled heartland rock had it been released in the 1970s or 1980s, such as Missouri's [[The Bottle Rockets|Bottle Rockets]] and Illinois' [[Uncle Tupelo]], often find themselves labeled [[alt-country]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=S.

The term alternative rock was coined in the early 1980s to describe rock artists who did not fit into the mainstream genres of the time. Bands dubbed "alternative" had no unified style, but were all seen as distinct from mainstream music. Alternative bands were linked by their collective debt to punk rock, through hardcore, New Wave or the post-punk movements.&lt;ref name=Bogdanov2002USAlternative&gt;S.T.

Few of these early bands achieved mainstream success, although exceptions to this rule include R.E.M., the Smiths, and the Cure. Despite a general lack of spectacular album sales, the original alternative rock bands exerted a considerable influence on the generation of musicians who came of age in the 1980s and ended up breaking through to mainstream success in the 1990s. Styles of alternative rock in the U.S. during the 1980s included [[jangle pop]], associated with the early recordings of R.E.M., which incorporated the ringing guitars of mid-1960s pop and rock, and college rock, used to describe alternative bands that began in the college circuit and college radio, including acts such as [[10,000 Maniacs]] and [[the Feelies]].&lt;ref name=Bogdanov2002USAlternative/&gt; In the UK Gothic rock was dominant in the early 1980s, but by the end of the decade indie or dream pop&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Twee as Fuck: The Story of Indie Pop |first= |last=N.

Disaffected by commercialized and highly produced pop and rock in the mid-1980s, bands in [[Washington (state)|Washington state]] (particularly in the [[Seattle]] area) formed a new style of rock which sharply contrasted with the mainstream music of the time.&lt;ref name="allmusic grunge"&gt;{{Citation|last= |title=Grunge |journal=Allmusic |date= |url={{Allmusic|class=explore|id=style/d2679|pure_url=yes}} |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5wT8KwMkr?url=http://www.allmusic.com/explore/style/d2679 |archivedate=13 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The developing genre came to be known as "grunge", a term descriptive of the dirty sound of the music and the unkempt appearance of most musicians, who actively rebelled against the over-groomed images of other artists.&lt;ref name="allmusic grunge"/&gt; Grunge fused elements of [[hardcore punk]] and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] into a single sound, and made heavy use of guitar [[distortion (guitar)|distortion]], [[Distortion (music)|fuzz]] and [[audio feedback|feedback]].&lt;ref name="allmusic grunge"/&gt; The lyrics were typically apathetic and angst-filled, and often concerned themes such as social alienation and entrapment, although it was also known for its dark humor and parodies of commercial rock.&lt;ref name="allmusic grunge"/&gt;

Bands such as [[Green River (band)|Green River]], [[Soundgarden]], [[Melvins]] and [[Skin Yard]] pioneered the genre, with [[Mudhoney]] becoming the most successful by the end of the decade.

The term post-grunge was coined for the generation of bands that followed the emergence into the mainstream and subsequent hiatus of the Seattle grunge bands. Post-grunge bands emulated their attitudes and music, but with a more radio-friendly commercially oriented sound.&lt;ref name=AllMusicPostgrunge/&gt; Often they worked through the major labels and came to incorporate diverse influences from jangle pop, pop-punk, [[alternative metal]] or hard rock.&lt;ref name=AllMusicPostgrunge/&gt; The term post-grunge originally was meant to be pejorative, suggesting that they were simply musically derivative, or a cynical response to an "authentic" rock movement.&lt;ref name=Grierson/&gt; Originally, grunge bands that emerged when grunge was mainstream and were suspected of emulating the grunge sound were pejoratively labelled as post-grunge.&lt;ref name=Grierson/&gt; From 1994, former Nirvana drummer [[Dave Grohl]]'s new band, the [[Foo Fighters]], helped popularize the genre and define its parameters.&lt;ref name=Bogdanov2002FooFighters&gt;S.T. Erlewine, "Foo Fighters", in [[#CITEREFBogdanovWoodstraErlewine2002|Bogdanov et al., 2002]], p. 423.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some post-grunge bands, like [[Candlebox]], were from Seattle, but the subgenre was marked by a broadening of the geographical base of grunge, with bands like Los Angeles' [[Audioslave]], and Georgia's [[Collective Soul]] and beyond the US to Australia's [[Silverchair]] and Britain's [[Bush (band)|Bush]], who all cemented post-grunge as one of the most commercially viable subgenres of the late 1990s.&lt;ref name=Bogdanov2002USAlternative/&gt;&lt;ref name=AllMusicPostgrunge/&gt; Although male bands predominated post-grunge, female solo artist [[Alanis Morissette]]'s 1995 album ''[[Jagged Little Pill]]'', labelled as post-grunge, also became a multi-platinum hit.&lt;ref name=Bogdanov2002Alanis&gt;S.T. Erlewine, "Alanis Morissette", in [[#CITEREFBogdanovWoodstraErlewine2002|Bogdanov et al., 2002]], p. 761.&lt;/ref&gt; Post-grunge morphed during the late 1990s as post-grunge bands like [[Creed (band)|Creed]] and [[Nickelback]] emerged.&lt;ref name=Grierson/&gt; Bands like Creed and Nickelback took post-grunge into the 21st century with considerable commercial success, abandoning most of the angst and anger of the original movement for more conventional anthems, narratives and romantic songs, and were followed in this vein by newer acts including [[Shinedown]], [[Seether]], [[3 Doors Down]] and [[Puddle of Mudd]].&lt;ref name=Grierson&gt;{{Citation|last=T.

The origins of 1990s pop punk can be seen in the more song-oriented bands of the 1970s punk movement like [[the Buzzcocks]] and [[the Clash]], commercially successful new wave acts such as [[the Jam]] and [[the Undertones]], and the more hardcore-influenced elements of alternative rock in the 1980s.&lt;ref name=LambPunkPop&gt;{{Citation

A second wave of pop punk was spearheaded by [[Blink-182]], with their breakthrough album ''[[Enema of the State]]'' (1999), followed by bands such as [[Good Charlotte]], [[Simple Plan]] and [[Sum 41]], who made use of humour in their videos and had a more radio-friendly tone to their music, while retaining the speed, some of the attitude and even the look of 1970s punk.&lt;ref name=LambPunkPop/&gt; Later pop-punk bands, including [[All Time Low]], [[5 Seconds Of Summer]], [[the All-American Rejects]] and [[Fall Out Boy]], had a sound that has been described as closer to 1980s hardcore, while still achieving commercial success.&lt;ref name=LambPunkPop/&gt;

In the 1980s the terms indie rock and alternative rock were used interchangeably.&lt;ref name=AllMusicIndie/&gt; By the mid-1990s, as elements of the movement began to attract mainstream interest, particularly grunge and then Britpop, post-grunge and pop-punk, the term alternative began to lose its meaning.&lt;ref name=AllMusicIndie/&gt; Those bands following the less commercial contours of the scene were increasingly referred to by the label indie.&lt;ref name=AllMusicIndie/&gt; They characteristically attempted to retain control of their careers by releasing albums on their own or small independent labels, while relying on touring, word-of-mouth, and airplay on independent or college radio stations for promotion.&lt;ref name=AllMusicIndie&gt;{{Citation|last= |title=Indie rock |journal=Allmusic |date= |url=http://www.allmusic.com/explore/style/d2687 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5wTaUVdId?url=http://www.allmusic.com/explore/style/d2687 |archivedate=13 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Linked by an ethos more than a musical approach, the indie rock movement encompassed a wide range of styles, from hard-edged, grunge-influenced bands like [[the Cranberries]] and [[Superchunk]], through do-it-yourself experimental bands like [[Pavement (band)|Pavement]], to punk-folk singers such as [[Ani DiFranco]].&lt;ref name=Bogdanov2002USAlternative/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bogdanov2002UKAlternative/&gt; It has been noted that indie rock has a relatively high proportion of female artists compared with preceding rock genres, a tendency exemplified by the development of feminist-informed [[Riot Grrrl]] music.&lt;ref&gt;M.

By the end of the 1990s many recognisable subgenres, most with their origins in the late 1980s alternative movement, were included under the umbrella of indie.

===Post-hardcore and emo===
{{Main|Post-hardcore|Emo}}
{{See also|Screamo}}

Post-hardcore developed in the US, particularly in the Chicago and Washington, DC areas, in the early to mid-1980s, with bands that were inspired by the do-it-yourself ethics and guitar-heavy music of hardcore punk, but influenced by post-punk, adopting longer song formats, more complex musical structures and sometimes more melodic vocal styles.&lt;ref name=AMPost-Hardcore&gt;{{Citation|last= |title=Post-hardcore |journal=Allmusic |date= |url=http://www.allmusic.com/explore/style/post-hardcore-d12962 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ytGUEiba?url=http://www.allmusic.com/explore/style/post-hardcore-d12962 |archivedate=23 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Emo also emerged from the hardcore scene in 1980s Washington, D.C., initially as "emocore", used as a term to describe bands who favored expressive vocals over the more common abrasive, barking style.&lt;ref name=AllMusicEmo&gt;{{Citation|last= |title=Emo |journal=Allmusic |date= |url={{Allmusic|class=explore|id=style/d4525|pure_url=yes}} |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5wWXsBzzX?url=http://www.allmusic.com/explore/style/d4525 |archivedate=15 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The early emo scene operated as an underground, with short-lived bands releasing small-run vinyl records on tiny independent labels.&lt;ref name=AllMusicEmo/&gt; Emo broke into mainstream culture in the early 2000s with the platinum-selling success of Jimmy Eat World's ''[[Bleed American]]'' (2001) and [[Dashboard Confessional]]'s ''[[The Places You Have Come to Fear the Most]]'' (2003).&lt;ref name=DeRogatis2003&gt;{{Citation|last=J.

In the early 2000s, a new group of bands that played a stripped down and back-to-basics version of guitar rock, emerged into the mainstream. They were variously characterised as part of a garage rock, post-punk or new wave revival.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=H.

Roach, ''This Is It-: the First Biography of the Strokes'' (London: Omnibus Press, 2003), {{ISBN|0-7119-9601-6}}, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; Because the bands came from across the globe, cited diverse influences (from traditional blues, through New Wave to grunge), and adopted differing styles of dress, their unity as a genre has been disputed.&lt;ref&gt;E.J.

Simpson, ''The Rough Guide to Cult Pop'' (London: Rough Guides, 2003), {{ISBN|1-84353-229-8}}, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

The commercial breakthrough from these scenes was led by four bands: [[the Strokes]], who emerged from the New York club scene with their début album ''[[Is This It]]'' (2001); [[the White Stripes]], from Detroit, with their third album ''[[White Blood Cells (album)|White Blood Cells]]'' (2001); [[the Hives]] from Sweden after their compilation album ''[[Your New Favourite Band]]'' (2001); and [[The Vines (band)|the Vines]] from Australia with ''[[Highly Evolved]]'' (2002).&lt;ref&gt;P.

In the 2000s, as computer technology became more accessible and [[music software]] advanced, it became possible to create high quality music using little more than a single [[laptop computer]].&lt;ref name="S.

Emmerson, ''Living Electronic Music'' (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2007), {{ISBN|0-7546-5548-2}}, pp. 80–81.&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in a massive increase in the amount of home-produced electronic music available to the general public via the expanding internet,&lt;ref&gt;R. Shuker, ''Popular Music: the Key Concepts'' (Abingdon: Routledge, 2nd edn., 2005), {{ISBN|0-415-34770-X}}, pp. 145–48.&lt;/ref&gt; and new forms of performance such as laptronica&lt;ref name="S.

Emmerson, ''Living Electronic Music'' (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2007), {{ISBN|0-7546-5548-2}}, p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; These techniques also began to be used by existing bands and by developing genres that mixed rock with digital techniques and sounds, including indie electronic, electroclash, dance-punk and new rave.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

==Social impact==
{{Main|Social effects of rock music}}

Different subgenres of rock were adopted by, and became central to, the identity of a large number of [[sub-culture]]s. In the 1950s and 1960s, respectively, British youths adopted the [[Teddy Boys|Teddy Boy]] and [[Rocker (subculture)|Rocker]] subcultures, which revolved around US rock and roll.&lt;ref name="Brake; 1990; 73-9"/&gt; The [[counterculture of the 1960s]] was closely associated with [[psychedelic rock]].&lt;ref name="Brake; 1990; 73-9"&gt;M.

Cunningham and S.V. Lab, ''Dress and Popular Culture'' (Madison, WI: Popular Press, 1991), {{ISBN|0-87972-507-9}}, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; Out of the punk scene, the [[Goth subculture|Goth]] and [[Emo]] subcultures grew, both of which presented distinctive visual styles.&lt;ref&gt;L.M.E.

When an international rock culture developed, it supplanted [[Film|cinema]] as the major sources of fashion influence.&lt;ref name="Bruzzi et al; 2000; 260"&gt;S. Bruzzi and P. C. Gibson, ''Fashion Cultures: Theories, Explorations, and Analysis'' (Abingdon: Routledge, 2000), {{ISBN|0-415-20685-5}}, p. 260.&lt;/ref&gt; Paradoxically, followers of rock music have often mistrusted the world of fashion, which has been seen as elevating image above substance.&lt;ref name="Bruzzi et al; 2000; 260"/&gt; Rock fashions have been seen as combining elements of different cultures and periods, as well as expressing divergent views on sexuality and gender, and rock music in general has been noted and criticised for facilitating greater sexual freedom.&lt;ref name="Bruzzi et al; 2000; 260"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G. Lipsitz, ''Time Passages: Collective Memory and American Popular Culture'' (Minneapolis MI: University of Minnesota Press, 2001), {{ISBN|0-8166-3881-0}}, p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; Rock has also been associated with various forms of [[drug]] use, including the [[amphetamine]]s taken by mods in the early to mid-1960s, through the [[LSD]], [[mescaline]], [[hashish]] and other hallucinogenic drugs linked with [[psychedelic rock]] in the late 1960s and early 1970s; and sometimes to [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], [[cocaine]] and [[heroin]], all of which have been eulogised in song.&lt;ref&gt;R. Coomber, ''The Control of Drugs and Drug Users: Reason or Reaction?'' (Amsterdam: CRC Press, 1998), {{ISBN|90-5702-188-9}}, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P.

Rock has been credited with changing attitudes to race by opening up [[African-American culture]] to white audiences; but at the same time, rock has been accused of [[Cultural appropriation|appropriating]] and exploiting that culture.&lt;ref&gt;M. Fisher, ''Something in the Air: Radio, Rock, and the Revolution that Shaped a Generation'' (Marc Fisher, 2007), {{ISBN|0-375-50907-0}}, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M.T. Bertrand, ''Race, Rock, and Elvis'' (Chicago IL: University of Illinois Press, 2000), {{ISBN|0-252-02586-5}}, pp. 95–96.&lt;/ref&gt; While rock music has absorbed many influences and introduced Western audiences to different musical traditions,&lt;ref&gt;J.

Street, eds, ''The Cambridge Companion to Pop and Rock'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2001), {{ISBN|0-521-55660-0}}, pp. 272–89.&lt;/ref&gt; the global spread of rock music has been interpreted as a form of [[cultural imperialism]].&lt;ref&gt;R. Shuker, ''Understanding Popular Music'' (Abingdon: Routledge, 1994), {{ISBN|0-415-10723-7}}, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; Rock music inherited the folk tradition of [[protest song]], making political statements on subjects such as war, religion, poverty, civil rights, justice and the environment.&lt;ref&gt;T.E. Scheurer, ''American Popular Music: The Age of Rock'' (Madison, WI: Popular Press, 1989), {{ISBN|0-87972-468-4}}, pp. 119–20.&lt;/ref&gt; Political activism reached a mainstream peak with the "[[Do They Know It's Christmas?]]" single (1984) and [[Live Aid]] concert for Ethiopia in 1985, which, while successfully raising awareness of world poverty and funds for aid, have also been criticised (along with similar events), for providing a stage for self-aggrandisement and increased profits for the rock stars involved.&lt;ref&gt;D. Horn and D. Bucley, "Disasters and accidents", in J. Shepherd, ''Continuum Encyclopedia of Popular Music of the World: Media, Industry and Society'' (London: Continuum, 2003), {{ISBN|0-8264-6321-5}}, p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its early development rock music has been associated with rebellion against social and political norms, most obviously in early rock and roll's rejection of an adult-dominated culture, the counterculture's rejection of consumerism and conformity and punk's rejection of all forms of social convention,&lt;ref&gt;P. Wicke, ''Rock Music: Culture, Aesthetics and Sociology'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2nd edn., 1995), {{ISBN|0-521-39914-9}}, pp. 91–114.&lt;/ref&gt; however, it can also be seen as providing a means of commercial exploitation of such ideas and of diverting youth away from political action.&lt;ref&gt;E.T. Yazicioglu and A.F. Firat, "Clocal rock festivals as mirrors into the futures of cultures", in R.W. Belk, ed., ''Consumer Culture Theory'' (Bingley: Emerald Group Publishing, 2007), {{ISBN|0-7623-1446-X}}, pp. 109–14.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role of women===
{{Main|Women in music#Popular music}}
[[File:Suzi Quatro plays a bass guitar while she sings at AIS Arena.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.75|[[Suzi Quatro]] is a singer, bassist and bandleader. When she launched her career in 1973, she was one of the few prominent women instrumentalists and bandleaders.]]

Professional women instrumentalists are uncommon in rock genres such as heavy metal. According to Schaap and Berkers, "playing in a band is largely a male homosocial activity, that is, learning to play in a band is largely a peer-based ... experience, shaped by existing sex-segregated friendship networks.&lt;ref&gt;J. Schaap and P. Berkers, "Grunting Alone? Online Gender Inequality in Extreme Metal Music", ''Journal of the International Association for the Study of Popular Music'', vol.4(1) (2014), pp. 101–02.&lt;/ref&gt; They note that rock music "is often defined as a form of male rebellion vis-à-vis female bedroom culture".&lt;ref name="SchaapandBerkers2014p102"&gt;J. Schaap and P. Berkers. "Grunting Alone? Online Gender Inequality in Extreme Metal Music", ''Journal of the International Association for the Study of Popular Music'', Vol.4 (1), (2014), p. 102,&lt;/ref&gt; In popular music, there has been a gendered "distinction between public (male) and private (female) participation" in music.&lt;ref name="SchaapandBerkers2014p102"/&gt; "several scholars have argued that men exclude women from bands or from the bands' rehearsals, recordings, performances, and other social activities".&lt;ref name="SchaapandBerkers2014p104"&gt;J. Schaap and P. Berkers, "Grunting Alone? Online Gender Inequality in Extreme Metal Music", ''Journal of the International Association for the Study of Popular Music'', Vol.4(1), (2014), p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; "Women are mainly regarded as passive and private consumers of allegedly slick, prefabricated{{snd}}hence, inferior{{snd}}pop music..., excluding them from participating as high status rock musicians".&lt;ref name="SchaapandBerkers2014p104"/&gt; One of the reasons that there are rarely mixed gender bands is that "bands operate as tight-knit units in which homosocial solidarity{{snd}}social bonds between people of the same sex...{{snd}}plays a crucial role".&lt;ref name="SchaapandBerkers2014p104"/&gt; In the 1960s rock music scene, "singing was sometimes an acceptable pastime for a girl, but playing an instrument ... simply wasn't done".&lt;ref name="rebeatmag.com"&gt;{{cite web|first=Erika|last=White |url=http://www.rebeatmag.com/music-history-primer-3-pioneering-female-songwriters-of-the-60s/ |title=Music History Primer: 3 Pioneering Female Songwriters of the '60s &amp;#124; REBEAT Magazine |publisher=Rebeatmag.com |date=28 January 2015 |accessdate=20 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"The rebellion of rock music was largely a male rebellion; the women{{snd}}often, in the 1950s and '60s, girls in their teens{{snd}}in rock usually sang songs as personæ utterly dependent on their macho boyfriends...". Philip Auslander says that "Although there were many women in rock by the late 1960s, most performed only as singers, a traditionally feminine position in popular music". Though some women played instruments in American [[all-female bands|all-female garage rock bands]], none of these bands achieved more than regional success. So they "did not provide viable templates for women's on-going participation in rock".&lt;ref name="Auslander2004"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Auslander | first = Philip | date = 28 January 2004 | title = I Wanna Be Your Man: Suzi Quatro's musical androgyny | journal = Popular Music | volume = 23 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–16 | location = United Kingdom | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] | format = PDF | doi = 10.1017/S0261143004000030 | accessdate = 25 April 2012 | url = http://lmc.gatech.edu/~auslander/publications/quatro.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130524032035/http://lmc.gatech.edu/~auslander/publications/quatro.pdf | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 24 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In relation to the gender composition of [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal bands]], it has been said that "[h]eavy metal performers are almost exclusively male"&lt;ref name="Brake 1990 87–91"&gt;{{cite book |last=Brake |first=Mike |editor1-last=Frith |editor1-first=Simon |editor2-last=Goodwin |editor2-first=Andrew  |title=On Record: Rock, Pop and the Written Word |publisher=Routledge |date=1990  |pages=87–91 |chapter=Heavy Metal Culture, Masculinity and Iconography |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "...at least until the mid-1980s"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Walser |first=Robert |date=1993 |title=Running with the Devil:Power, Gender and Madness in Heavy Metal Music |url= |location= |publisher=Wesleyan University Press |page=76 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; apart from "...exceptions such as [[Girlschool]]".&lt;ref name="Brake 1990 87–91"/&gt; However, "...now [in the 2010s] maybe more than ever–strong metal women have put up their dukes and got down to it",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Eddy |first=Chuck |date=1 July 2011 |title=Women of Metal |journal=Spin |location= |publisher=SpinMedia Group}}&lt;/ref&gt; "carv[ing] out a considerable place for [them]selves."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kelly |first=Kim |date=17 January 2013 |title=Queens of noise: heavy metal encourages heavy-hitting women |journal=The Telegraph|volume= |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Suzi Quatro]] emerged in 1973, "no other prominent female musician worked in rock simultaneously as a singer, instrumentalist, songwriter, and bandleader".&lt;ref name="Auslander2004"/&gt; According to Auslander, she was "kicking down the male door in rock and roll and proving that a female ''musician''&amp;nbsp;... and this is a point I am extremely concerned about&amp;nbsp;... could play as well if not better than the boys".&lt;ref name="Auslander2004"/&gt;

An [[all-female band]] is a musical group in genres such as rock and blues which is exclusively composed of [[female musician]]s. This is distinct from a [[girl group]], in which the female members are solely vocalists, though this terminology is not universally followed.&lt;ref&gt;For example, vocalists [[Girls Aloud]] are referred to as a "girl band" in [http://www.ok.co.uk/fashion/view/8555/Meet-the-duo-dressing-Girls-Aloud ''OK'' magazine] and the [https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/nov/09/girlsaloud-thexfactor ''Guardian''], while [[Girlschool]] are termed a "girl group" at the [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0320918/bio ''imdb''] and [https://archive.is/20120728103723/http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/entertainment/music/reviews/the-hedrons-13401497.html?startindex=-1 ''Belfast Telegraph''].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gare Metz décor 16.png|thumb|280px|A statue of Roland at [[Metz]] railway station, France.]]
'''Roland''' ([[Frankish language|Frankish]]: "*Hrōþiland"; [[Latin]]: "Hruodlandus", "Rotholandus"; [[Italian language|Italian]]: "Orlando", "Rolando"&lt;!---Italian has to be put because of Boiardo, Ariosto and Pulci's works about Orlando---&gt;; died 15 August 778) was a [[Franks|Frankish]] military leader under [[Charlemagne]] who became one of the principal figures in the literary cycle known as the [[Matter of France]]. The historical Roland was military governor of the [[Breton March]], responsible for defending [[Francia]]'s frontier against the [[Bretons]]. His only historical attestation is in [[Einhard]]'s ''[[Vita Karoli Magni]]'', which notes he was part of the Frankish rearguard killed by rebellious [[Basques]] in Iberia at the [[Battle of Roncevaux Pass]].

The story of Roland's death at Roncevaux Pass was embellished in later [[medieval literature|medieval]] and [[Renaissance literature]]. The first and most famous of these epic treatments was the [[Old French]] ''[[Chanson de Roland]]'' of the eleventh century.

Two masterpieces of Italian Renaissance poetry, the ''[[Orlando Innamorato]]'' and ''[[Orlando Furioso]]'' (by [[Matteo Maria Boiardo]] and [[Ludovico Ariosto]]), are further detached from history than the earlier ''Chansons'', similarly to the later ''[[Morgante]]'' by [[Luigi Pulci]]. Roland is poetically associated with his sword [[Durendal]], his horse [[Veillantif]], and his [[Olifant (instrument)|oliphant]] horn.

==History==
[[File:Blason imaginaire Roland.svg|thumbnail|[[Attributed arms]] according to [[Michel Pastoureau]]
:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Pastoureau| first =Michel| authorlink =Michel Pastoureau| title =L'Art de l'héraldique au Moyen Âge| publisher =éditions du Seuil| date =2009| location =Paris| pages =197| language =French| isbn =978-2-02-098984-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Échiqueté d'argent et de sable'']]
The only historical mention of the actual Roland is in the ''[[Vita Karoli Magni]]'' by [[Charlemagne]]'s courtier and biographer [[Einhard]]. Einhard refers to him as ''Hruodlandus Brittannici limitis praefectus'' ("Roland, prefect of the borders of Brittany"), indicating that he presided over the [[Breton March]], [[Francia]]'s border territory against the [[Bretons]].&lt;ref&gt;''Hruodlandus'' is the earliest [[Medieval Latin|Latinised]] form of his [[Frankish language|Frankish]] name, ''Hruodland''. It was later Latinised as ''Rolandus'' and has been translated into many languages for literary purposes: [[Italian language|Italian]]: ''Orlando'' or ''Rolando'', [[Dutch language|Dutch]]: ''Roeland'', [[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''Roldán'' or ''Rolando'', [[Basque language|Basque]]: ''Errolan'', [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]: ''Roldão'' or ''Rolando'', [[Occitan language|Occitan]]: ''Rotland'', [[Catalan language|Catalan]]: ''Rotllant'' or ''Rotllà''.&lt;/ref&gt; The passage, which appears in Chapter 9, mentions that ''Hroudlandus'' (a Latinization of the Frankish ''*Hrōþiland'', from ''*hrōþi'', "praise"/"fame" and *''land'', "country") was among those killed in the Battle of Roncevaux Pass:
{{quote|While he was vigorously pursuing the [[Saxon Wars|Saxon war]], almost without a break, and after he had placed garrisons at selected points along the border, [Charles] marched into [[Spain]] [in 778] with as large a force as he could mount. His army passed through the [[Pyrenees]] and [Charles] received the surrender of all the towns and fortified places he encountered. He was returning [to Francia] with his army safe and intact, but high in the Pyrenees on that return trip he briefly experienced the [[Basques]]. That place is so thoroughly covered with thick forest that it is the perfect spot for an ambush. [Charles's] army was forced by the narrow terrain to proceed in a long line and [it was at that spot], high on the mountain, that the Basques set their ambush. [...] The Basques had the advantage in this skirmish because of the lightness of their weapons and the nature of the terrain, whereas the Franks were disadvantaged by the heaviness of their arms and the unevenness of the land. Eggihard, the overseer of the king's table, Anselm, the count of the palace, and Roland, the lord of the [[Breton March]], along with many others died in that skirmish. But this deed could not be avenged at that time, because the enemy had so dispersed after the attack that there was no indication as to where they could be found.&lt;ref&gt;Dutton, Paul Edward, ed. and trans. ''Charlemagne's Courtier: The Complete Einhard'', pp. 21-22.  Peterborough, Ontario, Canada: Broadview Press, 1998. [http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/ein.html Einhard at the Latin Library].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Roland was evidently the first official appointed to direct Frankish policy in [[Bretons|Breton]] affairs, as local [[Franks]] under the [[Merovingian]] dynasty had not previously pursued any specific relationship with the Bretons. Their frontier castle districts such as [[Vitré, Ille-et-Vilaine]], south of [[Mont Saint-Michel]], are now divided between Normandy and Brittany. The distinctive culture of this region preserves the present-day [[Gallo language]] and legends of local heroes such as Roland. Roland's successor in ''Brittania Nova'' was [[Guy of Nantes]], who like Roland, was unable to exert Frankish expansion over [[Brittany]] and merely sustained a Breton presence in the [[Carolingian Empire]].

According to legend, Roland was laid to rest in the basilica at [[Blaye]], near [[Bordeaux]], on the site of the citadel.

[[Image:Grandes chroniques Roland.jpg|thumb|400px|The eight phases of ''[[The Song of Roland]]'' in one picture.]]
[[File:Bodleian Libraries, La Chanson de Roland 1r.jpg|thumb|300px|Composed in 1098, the first page of the ''[[Chanson de Roland]]'' (Song of Roland).]]
Roland was a popular and iconic figure in medieval Europe and its [[minstrel]] culture. Many tales made him a nephew of [[Charlemagne]], and turned his life into an [[Epic poetry|epic tale]] of the noble [[Christian]] killed by [[Islam]]ic forces, which forms part of the medieval [[Matter of France]].

The tale of Roland's death is retold in the eleventh-century poem ''[[The Song of Roland]]'', where he is equipped with the [[Olifant (instrument)|olifant]] (a signalling horn) and an unbreakable sword, enchanted by various Christian relics, named [[Durendal]]. The ''Song'' contains a highly romanticized account of the Battle of Roncevaux Pass and Roland's death, setting the tone for later fantastical depiction of Charlemagne's court.

It was adapted and modified throughout the Middle Ages, including an influential Latin prose version ''[[Historia Caroli Magni]]'' (latterly known as the ''Pseudo-Turpin Chronicle''), which also includes Roland's battle with a Saracen giant named [[Ferracutus]] who is only vulnerable at his navel. The story was later adapted in the anonymous Franco-Venetian epic ''L'Entrée d'Espagne'' (c.1320) and in the 14th-century Italian epic ''La Spagna'', attributed to the Florentine Sostegno di Zanobi and likely composed between 1350–1360.

Other texts give further legendary accounts of Roland's life. His friendship with [[Olivier (The Song of Roland)|Olivier]] and his engagement with Olivier's sister [[Aude (character)|Aude]] are told in ''[[Girart de Vienne]]'' by [[Bertrand de Bar-sur-Aube]].  Roland's youth and the acquisition of his horse [[Veillantif]] and sword are described in ''[[Aspremont (chanson de geste)|Aspremont]]''. Roland also appears in ''[[Quatre Fils Aymon]]'' where he is contrasted with [[Renaud de Montauban]] against whom he occasionally fights.

In [[Norway]], the tales of Roland are part of the 13th century ''[[Karlamagnús saga]]''.

In the ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' [[Dante]] sees Roland, named Orlando as it is usual in Italian literature, in the Heaven of [[Mars]] together with others who fought for the faith.

Roland appears in ''[[Entrée d'Espagne]]'', a 14th-century Franco-Venetian chanson de geste (in which he is transformed  into a [[knight errant]], similar to heroes from the [[King Arthur|Arthurian]] [[Romance (heroic literature)|romances]]) and ''[[La Spagna]]'', a 14th-century Italian epic.

From the fifteenth century onwards, he appears as a central character in a sequence of Italian verse romances as "Orlando", including ''[[Morgante]]'' by [[Luigi Pulci]], ''[[Orlando Innamorato]]'' by [[Matteo Maria Boiardo]], and ''[[Orlando furioso]]'' by [[Ludovico Ariosto]]. (See below for his later history in Italian verse.) The ''Orlandino'' of [[Pietro Aretino]] then waxed satirical about the "cult of personality" of Orlando the hero. The Orlando narrative inspired several composers, amongst whom were [[Claudio Monteverdi]], [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]], [[Antonio Vivaldi]] and [[George Frideric Handel]], who composed an Italian-language [[opera]] with ''[[Orlando (opera)|Orlando]]''.

In [[Germany]], Roland gradually became a symbol of the independence of the growing cities from the local nobility. In the late Middle Ages many cities featured defiant [[Roland (statue)|statues of Roland]] in their marketplaces. The Roland in [[Wedel]] was erected in 1450 as symbol of market and [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic]] justice, and the [[Bremen Roland|Roland statue]] in front of [[Bremen City Hall]] (1404) has been listed together with the city hall itself on the [[UNESCO]] list of [[World Heritage Site]]s since 2004.

In [[Aragón]] there are several placenames related to Roldán or Rolando: la Breca de Roldán (in Spanish la Brecha de Roldán, in French [[La Brèche de Roland]]) and [[Salto d´o Roldán]] (in Spanish [[El Salto de Roldán]]).

In [[Catalonia]] Roland (or ''Rotllà'', as it is rendered in Catalan) became a legendary giant. Numerous places in Catalonia (both North and South) have a name related to ''Rotllà''. In step with the trace left by the character in the whole Pyrenean area, Basque ''Errolan'' turns up in numerous legends and place-names associated with a mighty giant, usually a heathen, capable of launching huge stones. The [[Basque language|Basque]] word ''erraldoi'' (giant) stems from ''Errol(d)an'', as pointed out by the linguist [[Koldo Mitxelena]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |coauthors= |title=Mintzoaren memoria |work=El País |page= |date=2004-09-13 |accessdate=31 July 2014 |quote= |url=http://elpais.com/diario/2004/09/13/paisvasco/1095104406_850215.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Faroe Islands]] Roland appears in the ballad of [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg_418mWCJE&amp;feature=player_embedded "Runtsivalstríðið" (Battle of Roncevaux)]

A statue of Roland also stands in the city of [[Rolândia]] in Brazil. This city was established by German immigrants, many of whom were refugees from Nazi Germany, who named their new home after Roland to represent freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

The '''science of team science''' ('''SciTS''') field encompasses both conceptual and methodological [[Strategy|strategies]] aimed at understanding and enhancing the processes and outcomes of collaborative, team-based [[research]]. It is useful to distinguish between team science (TS) initiatives and the science of team science (SciTS) field.&lt;ref name="pmid18619407"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Stokols | first=Daniel | last2=Hall | first2=Kara L. | last3=Taylor | first3=Brandie K. | last4=Moser | first4=Richard P. | title=The Science of Team Science | journal=American Journal of Preventive Medicine | publisher=Elsevier BV | volume=35 | issue=2 | year=2008 | issn=0749-3797 | doi=10.1016/j.amepre.2008.05.002 | pmid=18619407|pages=S77–S89|url=https://webfiles.uci.edu/dstokols/Pubs/AJPM-Science%20of%20Team%20Science%20Intro.pdf?uniq=-ftp6c5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stokols Misra Moser Hall 2008 pp. S96–S115"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Stokols | first=Daniel | last2=Misra | first2=Shalini | last3=Moser | first3=Richard P. | last4=Hall | first4=Kara L. | last5=Taylor | first5=Brandie K. | title=The Ecology of Team Science | journal=American Journal of Preventive Medicine | publisher=Elsevier BV | volume=35 | issue=2 | year=2008 | issn=0749-3797 | doi=10.1016/j.amepre.2008.05.003 | pages=S96–S115|url=https://webfiles.uci.edu/dstokols/Pubs/AJPM-Ecology%20of%20Team%20Science.pdf?uniq=-ftp6bz}}&lt;/ref&gt; Team science initiatives are designed to promote collaborative, and often cross-disciplinary (which includes multi-, [[interdisciplinary|inter]]-, and transdisciplinary) approaches to answering research questions about particular phenomena. The SciTS field, on the other hand, is concerned with understanding and managing circumstances that facilitate or hinder the effectiveness of collaborative science, and evaluating the outcomes of collaborative science. Its principal units of analysis are the [[research]], [[training]], and community-based translational initiatives implemented by both public and private sector organizations.

The SciTS field focuses on understanding and enhancing the antecedent conditions, collaborative processes, and outcomes associated with team science initiatives, including their scientific discoveries, educational outcomes, and translations of research findings into new practices, [[Patent|patents]], products, technical advances, and policies.

==History==
Since the 1990s, there has been a growing interest and investment in large-scale, team-based research initiatives to address complex and multifaceted problems that require cross-disciplinary collaboration.&lt;ref name="pmid18619407"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid17431139"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Wuchty S |author2=Jones BF |author3=Uzzi B | title=The increasing dominance of teams in production of knowledge. | journal=Science | year= 2007 | volume= 316 | issue= 5827 | pages= 1036–9 | pmid=17431139 | doi=10.1126/science.1136099 | pmc= | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&amp;tool=sumsearch.org/cite&amp;retmode=ref&amp;cmd=prlinks&amp;id=17431139 | bibcode=2007Sci...316.1036W }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid18845711"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Jones BF |author2=Wuchty S |author3=Uzzi B | title=Multi-university research teams: shifting impact, geography, and stratification in science. | journal=Science | year= 2008 | volume= 322 | issue= 5905 | pages= 1259–62 | pmid=18845711 | doi=10.1126/science.1158357 | pmc= | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&amp;tool=sumsearch.org/cite&amp;retmode=ref&amp;cmd=prlinks&amp;id=18845711 | bibcode=2008Sci...322.1259J }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rise in team science parallels the increase in specialization among scientists. The rapid growth and accumulation of specialized knowledge in multiple fields has created a substantial need to establish partnerships among scientists and practitioners drawn from several different fields in order to address complex [[Natural environment|environmental]], [[social]], and public [[health]] problems.&lt;ref name="pmid17431139"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid18845711"/&gt;

The interdiscipline of SciTS initially emerged from practical concerns on the part of funding agencies, which needed to gauge the performance of team science, understand its added value, determine the return on investment of large research initiatives, and inform science policy&lt;ref name="pmid18619407"/&gt; The term "science of team science" was first introduced in October, 2006, at a conference called The Science of Team Science: Assessing the Value of Transdisciplinary Research, hosted by the [[National Cancer Institute]], in Bethesda, Maryland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cancercontrol.cancer.gov/brp/scienceteam/index.html National Cancer Institute, Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences Web site.] Accessed May 12, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The emerging SciTS field was further developed in a supplement to the ''[[American Journal of Preventive Medicine]]'', published in July 2008. Two years later, the First Annual International Science of Team Science (SciTS) Conference was held on April 22–24, 2010 in Chicago, Illinois, organized by the [[Northwestern University]] Clinical and Translational Sciences (NUCATS) Institute. The Chicago conference brought together team science investigators and practitioners from a broad range of disciplines, including [[translational science|translational research]]; [[organizational behavior]]; [[Social psychology (psychology)|social]], [[Cognitive psychology|cognitive]], and [[health psychology]]; communications; complex systems; evaluation science; technology; and management.

As a nascent field of inquiry, the terminology, methodologies, and outcomes of SciTS are still being debated and defined, and new hypotheses regarding the most effective strategies for implementing and sustaining team science are beginning to be tested and the results published. While the SciTS literature base is currently limited, the field is founded on a substantial body of knowledge of team research conducted by scholars in diverse fields such as organizational science, community health promotion, and social psychology, as well as from groups outside academia, including business and the military. SciTS research findings are starting to be translated into evidence-based tools and support structures that aim to improve the efficiency and success of team science initiatives.&lt;ref name="pmid18619407"/&gt;

In 2013, the National Academy of Sciences established a National Research Council Committee on the Science of Team Science to evaluate the current state of knowledge and practice in the SciTS field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Science of Team Science | website=National Academies Web Server sites.nationalacademies.org | date=2013-01-11 | url=http://sites.nationalacademies.org/DBASSE/BBCSS/CurrentProjects/DBASSE_080231 | ref={{sfnref | National Academies Web Server sites.nationalacademies.org | 2013}} | access-date=2018-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A Committee report was published in 2015.&lt;ref name="Enhancing the Effectiveness of Team Science p. "&gt;{{cite book | title=Enhancing the Effectiveness of Team Science | publisher=National Academies Press | publication-place=Washington, D.C. | date=2015-07-15 | isbn=978-0-309-31682-8 | doi=10.17226/19007 | page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods==
The methods and measures used to evaluate team science are complex and evolving with the interdiscipline of SciTS.&lt;ref name="pmid18619407"/&gt; The definition of a successful team may be different depending on the [[Project stakeholder|stakeholder]]. For example, [[Funding of science|funding agencies]] may be more interested in performance measures related to the translation of team research findings to practical applications, whereas team researchers may use the number of publications produced and amount grant funding obtained to gauge the success of a team science endeavor. In addition, the method of evaluation and metrics of success may vary at different points during the team research project. Short-term measures may include indicators of synergistic output, whereas long-term measures may be related to the impact of the research on the evolution of a discipline or the development of public policy.

SciTS uses both qualitative and quantitative methods to evaluate the antecedent conditions, collaborative processes, and outcomes associated with team science, as well as the organizational, social, and political context that influences team science.&lt;ref name="pmid18619407"/&gt; These methods include approaches such as surveys, ethnographic observation, case studies, and interviews of members of science teams; [[social network analysis|social network]], mapping and visualization techniques (e.g., graphical representations of collaboration formation and dissolution, geographic distribution of collaborators, funding patterns, patent awards, time to production and commercialization, etc.); and [[bibliometrics|bibliometric]] analyses (e.g., assessment of co-authored papers and grants).{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

The field would benefit from science agencies and associated policies to put into place advanced computational infrastructures, which will enable the analysis of terabytes of data to identify the factors that contribute to or hinder the success of science teams.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} Ideally, evaluation of team science initiatives is performed in real time, during active collaborations, so that the information results can be fed back to the scientific team to enhance its efficiency and effectiveness.

==Tools==
Scientists engaged in team science collaborations have traditionally relied on [[heuristics]] to make team science work. Through only their own experiences—what might be called the art of team science—they have tried to discern what facilitates team science and what obstacles stand in the way of a collaboration’s success. By studying the practice of team science, SciTS researchers aim to develop a set of evidence-based tools and recommendations that can then be used to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of team science initiatives. For example, SciTS researchers may identify approaches to facilitate the formation and function of successful collaborative science teams, remove inter-institutional barriers to team science, support effective collaboration among researchers who work together within a team, and develop team science training programs.&lt;ref name="pmid18619407"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fiore SM. Interdisciplinarity as teamwork: how the science of teams can inform team science. ''Small Group Res''. 2008;39:251–277.&lt;/ref&gt;

Progress is being made on a few fronts toward the development of practical tools and recommendations to support the team science process. The SciTS research community is working toward the creation of an evidence base for the development of a set of "effective practices", which can be incorporated into team science training to ensure that the next generation of scientists develops the skills necessary to engage in effective team science. Several groups are developing team science "[[Toolbox|toolboxes]]" or "[[List of toolkits|toolkits]]" that provide resources that can assist researchers with the collaborative science process, including guiding questions that support discussion on collaborative goals and common metrics of success and assigning individual tasks and responsibilities; guidelines for developing a shared "[[language]]" that can be used among researchers from different disciplinary backgrounds; models for communications infrastructure that can support geographically dispersed collaborations; tools for assessing team members' readiness to collaborate; curricula for training team members in skills for team science; and model "[[prenuptial agreements]]" for collaborators that can help to establish agreement on rights to authorship and patents that result from scientific collaborations. Other groups are developing online social networking tools to help scientists identify potential collaborators, and creating centralized databases of measures and instruments that can be used by SciTS researchers, program evaluators, or those who are engaged in team science to assess the processes and outcomes of team science initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;Ombudsman.

A '''shirt''' is a cloth garment for the upper body (from the neck to the waist).

Originally an [[undergarment]] worn exclusively by men, it has become, in [[American English]], a catch-all term for a broad variety of upper-body garments and undergarments. In [[British English]], a shirt is more specifically a garment with a [[collar (clothing)|collar]], sleeves with [[cuff]]s, and a full vertical opening with buttons or snaps (North Americans would call that a "[[dress shirt]]", a specific type of "collared shirt"). A shirt can also be worn with a [[necktie]] under the shirt collar.

== History ==
The World's Oldest preserved garment, discovered by [[Flinders Petrie]], is a "highly sophisticated" linen shirt from a First Dynasty Egyptian tomb at [[Tarkhan (Egypt)|Tarkan]], c. 3000 BC: "the shoulders and sleeves have been finely pleated to give form-fitting trimness while allowing the wearer room to move. The small fringe formed during weaving along one edge of the cloth has been placed by the designer to decorate the neck opening and side seam."&lt;ref&gt;Barber, Elizabeth Wayland (1994). ''Women's Work. The first 20,000 Years'', p.135.Norton &amp; Company, New York. {{ISBN|0-393-31348-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The shirt was an item of clothing that only men could wear as underwear, until the twentieth century.&lt;ref name="William L. Brown III 1999. p. 7"&gt;William L. Brown III, "Some Thoughts on Men's Shirts in America, 1750-1900", Thomas Publications, Gettysburg, PA 1999. {{ISBN|1-57747-048-6}}, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the women's [[chemise]] was a closely related garment to the men's, it is the men's garment that became the modern shirt.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dorothy K. Burnham]], "Cut My Cote", Royal Ontario Museum, Toronto, Ontario 1973. {{ISBN|0-88854-046-9}}, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Middle Ages]], it was a plain, undyed garment worn next to the skin and under regular garments. In medieval artworks, the shirt is only visible (uncovered) on humble characters, such as [[shepherd]]s, prisoners, and [[Penance|penitents]].&lt;ref&gt;C. Willett and Phillis Cunnington, ''The History of Underclothes'', Dover Publications Inc., New York 1992. {{ISBN|0-486-27124-2}} pp. 23–25&lt;/ref&gt;  In the seventeenth century, men's shirts were allowed to show, with much the same [[Eroticism|erotic]] import as visible underwear today.&lt;ref&gt;C. Willett and Phillis Cunnington, ''The History of Underclothes'', Dover Publications Inc., New York 1992. {{ISBN|0-486-27124-2}} pp. 54&lt;/ref&gt; In the eighteenth century, instead of underpants, men "relied on the long tails of shirts ... to serve the function of drawers.&lt;ref&gt;Linda Baumgarten, "What Clothes Reveal: The Language of Clothing in Colonial and Federal America", The Colonial Williamsburg Foundation, Williamsburg, Virginia, in association with the [[Yale University Press]], New Haven, Connecticut 2002, {{ISBN|0-300-09580-5}}, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;  Eighteenth-century costume historian [[Joseph Strutt (engraver and antiquary)|Joseph Strutt]] believed that men who did not wear shirts to bed were indecent.&lt;ref&gt;Linda Baumgarten, "What Clothes Reveal: The Language of Clothing in Colonial and Federal America", The Colonial Williamsburg Foundation, Williamsburg, Virginia, in association with the [[Yale University Press]], New Haven, Connecticut 2002, {{ISBN|0-300-09580-5}}, pp. 20-22&lt;/ref&gt;  Even as late as 1879, a visible shirt with nothing over it was considered improper.&lt;ref name="William L. Brown III 1999. p. 7"/&gt;

The shirt sometimes had frills at the neck or cuffs.  In the sixteenth century, men's shirts often had [[embroidery]], and sometimes frills or [[lace]] at the neck and cuffs and through the eighteenth century long neck frills, or [[Jabot (neckwear)|jabots]], were fashionable.&lt;ref&gt;C. Willet and Phillis Cunnington, "The History of Underclothes", Dover Publications Inc., New York 1992. {{ISBN|0-486-27124-2}} pp. 36–39&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C. Willet and Phillis Cunnington, "The History of Underclothes", Dover Publications Inc., New York 1992. {{ISBN|0-486-27124-2}} pp. 73&lt;/ref&gt; Coloured shirts began to appear in the early nineteenth century, as can be seen in the paintings of [[George Caleb Bingham]].  They were considered casual wear, for lower-class workers only, until the twentieth century.  For a gentleman, "to wear a sky-blue shirt was unthinkable in 1860 but had become standard by 1920 and, in 1980, constituted the most commonplace event."&lt;ref&gt;Michel Pastoureau and Jody Gladding (translator), "The Devil's Cloth: A History of Stripes", Columbia University Press, New York 2001 {{ISBN|0-7434-5326-3}}, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;

European and American women began wearing shirts in 1860, when the [[Garibaldi shirt]], a red shirt as worn by the freedom fighters under [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]], was popularized by [[Eugénie de Montijo|Empress Eugénie]] of France.&lt;ref&gt;Anne Buck, "Victorian Costume", Ruth Bean Publishers, Carlton, Bedford, England 1984. {{ISBN|0-903585-17-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Young, Julia Ditto, "The Rise of the Shirt Waist", ''[[Good Housekeeping]]'', May 1902, pp. 354–357&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the nineteenth century, the ''[[Century Dictionary]]'' described an ordinary shirt as "of cotton, with linen bosom, wristbands and cuffs prepared for stiffening with starch, the collar and wristbands being usually separate and adjustable".

The first documented appearance of the expression “To give the shirt off one’s back,” happened in 1771 as an idiom that indicates extreme desperation or generosity and is still in common usage. In 1827 Hannah Montague, a housewife in upstate New York, invents the [[detachable collar]]. Tired of constantly washing her husband’s entire shirt when only the collar needed it, she cut off his collars and devised a way of attaching them to the neckband after washing. It wasn't until the 1930s that [[collar stays]] became popular, although these early accessories resembled tie clips more than the small collar stiffeners available today. They connected the collar points to the necktie, keeping them in place &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gant.com/shirtguide/shirt-history |title=History Of The Shirt :: Shirt Guide |publisher=Gant US |accessdate=2016-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=External link appears to be [[WP:SPAM]]|date=September 2016}}

== Types ==
[[File:Shirt-types.svg|thumb|upright|Three types of shirt]]
* [[Camp shirt]] – a loose, straight-cut, short sleeved shirt or [[blouse]] with a simple placket front-opening and a "camp collar".
* [[Dress shirt]] – shirt with a formal (somewhat stiff) collar, a full-length opening at the front from the collar to the hem (usually buttoned), and sleeves with cuffs
* [[White shirt]] - usually dress shirt which its colour is white
** [[Dinner shirt]] – a shirt specifically made to be worn with male evening wear, e.g. a [[black tie]] or [[white tie]].
** [[Guayabera]] – an embroidered dress shirt with four pockets.
* [[Poet shirt]] – a loose-fitting shirt or blouse with full bishop sleeves, usually with large frills on the front and on the cuffs.
* [[T-shirt]] – also "tee shirt", a casual shirt without a collar or buttons, made of a stretchy, finely knit fabric, usually cotton, and usually short-sleeved. Originally worn under other shirts, it is now a common shirt for everyday wear in some countries.
** Long-sleeved T-shirt – a T-shirt with long sleeves that extend to cover the arms.
** [[Ringer T-shirt]] – tee with a separate piece of fabric sewn on as the collar and sleeve hems
** [[Crop top|Halfshirt]] – a high-hemmed T-shirt
** [[Sleeveless shirt]] – a shirt manufactured without sleeves, or one whose sleeves have been cut off, also called a tank top
***[[A-shirt]] or '''vest or singlet''' (in [[British English]]) – essentially a sleeveless shirt with large armholes and a large neck hole, often worn by labourers or athletes for increased movability.
*** [[Camisole]] – woman's undershirt with narrow straps, or a similar garment worn alone (often with [[brassiere|bra]]). Also referred to as a '''cami''', '''shelf top''', '''spaghetti straps''' or '''strappy top'''
* [[Polo shirt]] (also '''tennis shirt''' or '''golf shirt''') – a pullover soft collar short-sleeved shirt with an abbreviated button placket at the neck and a longer back than front (the "tennis tail").
** [[Rugby shirt]] –  a long-sleeved polo shirt, traditionally of rugged construction in thick cotton or wool, but often softer today
** [[Henley shirt]] –  a collarless polo shirt
* Baseball shirt ([[Jersey (clothing)#In sports|jersey]])&amp;nbsp;– usually distinguished by a three quarters sleeve, team insignia, and flat waist seam
* [[Sweatshirt]] – long-sleeved athletic shirt of heavier material, with or without [[Hoodie|hood]]
* [[Tunic]] – primitive shirt, distinguished by two-piece construction. Initially a men's garment, is normally seen in modern times being worn by women
* [[Shirtwaist]] – historically (circa. 1890–1920) a woman's tailored shirt (also called a "tailored waist") cut like a man's dress shirt;&lt;ref&gt;For example, see Laura I. Baldt, A.M., ''Clothing for Women: Selection, Design and Construction'', J.B. Lippincott Company, Philadelphia, PA 1924 (second edition), p. 312&lt;/ref&gt; in contemporary usage, a woman's dress cut like a men's dress shirt to the waist, then extended into dress length at the bottom
* [[Nightshirt]] – often oversized, ruined or inexpensive light cloth undergarment shirt for [[sleep]]ing.
* [[Halter top]] – a shoulderless, sleeveless garment for women. It is mechanically analogous to an [[apron]] with a string around the back of the neck and across the lower back holding it in place.
* Top shirt&amp;nbsp;– a long-sleeved collarless polo shirt 
* Heavy shirt&amp;nbsp;– a shirt with the heavy size that covers up under the neck
* [[Infant bodysuit|Onesie]] or diaper shirt&amp;nbsp;– a shirt for [[infant]]s which includes a long back that is wrapped between the legs and buttoned to the front of the shirt
* [[Tube top]] (in [[American English]]) or boob tube (in [[British English]])&amp;nbsp;– a shoulderless, sleeveless "tube" that wraps the torso not reaching higher than the armpit, staying in place by elasticity or by a single strap that is attached to the front of the tube
* Punishment shirts were special shirts made for the condemned, either those cursed supernaturally, such as the poisoned shirt that killed [[Creusa (daughter of Creon)]], the [[Shirt of Nessus]] used to kill [[Hercules]], those used to execute people in ancient Rome, such as the [[Tunica molesta]], and those used in church heresy trials, such as the [[Shirt of Flame]], or the [[Sanbenito]]


== Parts of shirt ==
Many terms are used to describe and differentiate types of shirts (and upper-body garments in general) and their construction. The smallest differences may have significance to a cultural or occupational group. Recently, (late twentieth century, into the twenty-first century) it has become common to use tops as a form of advertisement. Many of these distinctions apply to other upper-body garments, such as [[Coat (clothing)|coats]] and [[sweaters]].

=== Shoulders and arms ===

==== Sleeves ====
{{Main|sleeves}}
Shirts may:
* have no covering of the shoulders or arms&amp;nbsp;– a [[tube top]] (not reaching higher than the armpits, staying in place by elasticity)
* have only shoulder straps, such as [[spaghetti strap]]s
* cover the shoulders, but without [[sleeve]]s
* have shoulderless sleeves, short or long, with or without shoulder straps, that expose the shoulders, but cover the rest of the arm from the biceps and triceps down to at least the elbow
* have short sleeves, varying from cap sleeves (covering only the shoulder and not extending below the armpit) to half sleeves (elbow length), with some having quarter-length sleeves (reaching to a point that covers half of the biceps and triceps area)
* have three-quarter-length sleeves (reaching to a point between the elbow and the wrist)
* have long sleeves (reaching a point to the wrist to a little beyond wrist)

==== Cuffs ====
{{Main|cuff}}
Shirts with long sleeves may further be distinguished by the [[cuff]]s:
* no [[button (clothing)|button]]s&amp;nbsp;– a closed placket cuff
* buttons (or analogous fasteners such as [[snap fastener|snaps]])&amp;nbsp;– single or multiple. A single button or pair aligned parallel with the [[cuff]] hem is considered a [[button cuff]]. Multiple buttons aligned perpendicular to the [[cuff]] hem, or parallel to the [[placket]] constitute a [[barrel cuff]].
* buttonholes designed for [[cufflink]]s
** a [[French cuff]], where the end half of the [[cuff]] is folded over the [[cuff]] itself and fastened with a [[cufflink]]. This type of [[cuff]] has four buttons and a short [[placket]].
** more formally, a link cuff&amp;nbsp;– fastened like a [[French cuff]], except is not folded over, but instead hemmed, at the edge of the sleeve.
* asymmetrical designs, such as one-shoulder, one-sleeve or with sleeves of different lengths.

=== Lower hem ===
* hanging to the [[waist]]
* leaving the [[navel|belly button]] area [[Nudity|bare]] (much more common for women than for men). See [[halfshirt]].
* covering the [[crotch]]
* covering part of the legs (essentially this is a [[dress]]; however, a piece of clothing is perceived either as a shirt (worn with [[trousers]]) or as a dress (in [[Western culture]] mainly worn by women)).

== Types of fabric ==
There are two main categories of fibres used: natural fibre and man-made fibre (synthetics or petroleum based).
Some natural fibres are linen, the first used historically, [[hemp]], [[cotton]], the most used, [[ramie]], [[wool]], [[silk]] and more recently [[bamboo]] or [[Soy fabric|soya]]. Some synthetic fibres are [[polyester]], [[tencel]], [[viscose]], etc. Polyester mixed with cotton (poly-cotton) is often used. Fabrics for shirts are called shirtings. The four main weaves for shirtings are [[plain weave]], [[oxford (cloth)|oxford]], [[twill]] and [[satin]]. [[Broadcloth]], [[poplin]] and [[end-on-end]] are variations of the plain weave. After weaving, [[finishing (textiles)|finishing]] can be applied to the fabric.

== Shirts and politics ==
{{See also|Political colour}}
In the 1920s and 1930s, [[fascists]] wore different coloured shirts:
* [[Black shirts]] were used by the [[Italian Fascism|Italian fascists]], and in Britain, Finland and Germany and Croatia. The party leaders of [[Dravidar Kazhagam]] in India wear only black shirts to symbolise atheism.
* [[Brownshirts]] were worn by German Nazis of the SA.
* The [[Blueshirts]] was a fascist movement in Ireland and Canada, and the colour of the Portuguese ''[[National Syndicalists (Portugal)|Nacional Sindicalistas]]'', the Spanish ''[[Falange Española]]'', the French ''[[Solidarité Française]]'', and the Chinese [[Blue Shirts Society]].
* [[Greenshirts (disambiguation)|Green shirts]] were used in Hungary, Ireland, Romania, Brazil and Portugal.
* ''[[Camisas Doradas]]'' (golden shirts) were used in [[Mexico]].
* Red shirts were worn by the racist and antisemitic Bulgarian [[Ratniks]].
* [[Silver Shirts]] were worn in the United States of America.
* Grey shirts were worn by members of the [[Fatherland League (Norway)|Fatherland League]] in Norway.

In addition, [[redshirt (disambiguation)|red shirts]] have been used to symbolize a variety of different political groups, including [[Garibaldi]]'s Italian revolutionaries, nineteenth century American street gangs, and [[socialist]] militias in Spain and Mexico during the 1930s.

Different colored shirts signified the major opposing sides that featured prominently in the [[2008 Thai political crisis]], with red having been worn by the supporters of the populist [[People's Power Party (Thailand)|People's Power Party]] (PPP), and yellow being worn by the supporters of the royalist and anti-[[Thaksin Shinawatra]] movement the [[People's Alliance for Democracy]] (PAD). Each side is commonly referred to as the 'red shirts' and 'yellow shirts' respectively, though the later opponents of the later Thaksin supporting groups have largely ceased wearing yellow shirts to protest rallies.

In the UK, the [[Social Credit]] movement of the thirties wore green shirts.

'''Shuadit''' (also spelled ''Chouhadite'', ''Chouhadit'', ''Chouadite'', ''Chouadit'', and ''Shuhadit''), also called '''Judæo-Occitan''' or less accurately '''Judæo-Provençal''' or '''Judæo-Comtadin''', is the [[Occitan language|Occitan]] dialect historically spoken by [[History of the Jews in France|French Jews]]. Though written in Hebrew script, the dialect was mutually intelligible with the Occitan spoken by non-Jews (Banitt 1963, Pansier 1925, Guttel &amp; Aslanov 2006:560).&lt;ref&gt;Hammarström (2015) Ethnologue 16/17/18th editions: a comprehensive review: online appendices&lt;/ref&gt;

Shuadit is known from documents dating to as early as the 11th century in France, and after suffering drastic declines beginning with the charter of the [[Inquisition]] in France, it finally [[language death|died out]] with its last known speaker in 1977.

==Literature==
Shuadit writings came in two distinct varieties, religious texts and popular prose, and they were written by adapting the [[Hebrew script]].

Religious texts contained a significantly higher incidence of [[loanwords]] from [[Hebrew]]s and reflected an overall more "educated" style, with many words also from [[Old French]], [[Franco-Provençal language|Franco-Provençal]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Aramaic]] and [[Latin]]. The texts include a fragment of a 14th-century poem lauding Queen [[Esther]], and a woman's [[siddur]] containing an uncommon blessing, found in few other locations (including medieval [[Lithuanian Jews|Lithuania]]), thanking [[God in Judaism|God]], in the [[List of Jewish prayers and blessings|morning blessings]], not for making her "according to His will" (שעשני כרצונו ''she'asani kirtzono'') but for making her as a woman.

The extant texts comprising the collections of popular prose used far fewer borrowings and were essentially [[Occitan]] written with the Hebrew script. This may have simply reflected Jews' then-prevalent avoidance of the [[Latin alphabet]], which was widely associated with oppressive Christian régimes. The texts demonstrate the extent to which the Jewish community of [[Provence]] was familiar with Hebrew as well as the extent to which the community was integrated into the larger surrounding [[Christian culture]] of the region.

==Phonology==
Shuadit had a number of phonological characteristics unlike all other [[Jewish languages]]. The name "Shuadit" literally means "Jewish" and is the [[Occitan]] pronunciation of the Hebrew word "Yehudit" (initial *j became {{IPA|/ʃ/}}, and *h was often elided between vowels).

In words inherited from Hebrew and Aramaic, the letters ''samekh'', ''sin'' and ''thav'' were all pronounced {{IPA|/f/}}, the same as ''fe''. The conjecture is that the first two {{IPA|/s/}} phonemes merged with the {{IPA|/θ/}} phoneme, which then merged with the phoneme {{IPA|/f/}}. That observation gives particular validity to the theory that Shuadit is an outgrowth of a much older [[Judaeo-Latin]] language, rather than an independent development within southern [[France]], as the second step also occurred during the development of Latin from [[Proto-Italic]].

In words derived from Latin, there was a tendency to [[diphthong]]ise {{IPA|/l/}} after [[plosive]]s and to delateralize {{IPA|/ʎ/}} to {{IPA|/j/}}. Also, both {{IPA|/ʒ/}} and {{IPA|/ʃ/}},  as well as {{IPA|/dʒ/}} and {{IPA|/tʃ/}}, merged to the single phoneme {{IPA|/ʃ/}}.  Thus, the Provençal words ''plus'', ''filho'', and ''juge'' were respectively ''pyus'', ''feyo'', and ''šuše'' in Shuadit.

==Evidence==

A fundamental source for inferring information about the [[phonology]] of Shuadit is the comedy ''Harcanot et Barcanot''. (See ''Pansier'' in the [[#References|References]] section.)

Emperor [[Pedro II of Brazil]] recorded a number of bilingual Hebrew-Shuadit religious [[poem]]s.

==Decline==

In 1498, the [[History of the Jews in France|French Jews]] were formally expelled from [[France]]. Although the community was not finally compelled to depart until 1501, much of the community had by then become dispersed into other regions, notably [[Genoa]], and the underdeveloped regions of [[Germany]]. However, the [[Comtat Venaissin]] was then under the direct control of the [[Pope]], and a small Jewish community continued to live there in relative isolation. From the time of the [[French Revolution]], when French Jews were permitted to live legally anywhere in France as full citizens, the status of Shuadit began to decline rapidly. The last known native speaker, [[Armand Lunel]], died in 1977.

{{Japanese name|Soga}}

'''Soga Monogatari''' ({{lang|ja|{{linktext|曽我|物語}}}}) is a Japanese ''[[monogatari]]'' (or ''gunkimono''), the [[epic poetry|epic]] tale of two brothers. It was dramatized based on the incident 'Revenge of Soga Brothers'. The story is often known as ''The (illustrated) Tale of the Soga Brothers'' or ''The revenge of the Soga brothers''. It is sometimes written as ''Soga Monogatari Zue'' (''The Tale of the Soga brothers in pictures''). It is regarded by some as the last of the ''[[Gunki monogatari]]'' or great "war tales".

The brothers are Soga Jūrō and Soga Gorō. Jūrō being the older of the two. When the boys were younger they were known as Ichimanmaru and Hakoomaru. In Japanese the Soga brothers are described as Soga kyodai. Their names are also written as Soga no Gorō and Soga no Jūrō. The name Soga is the name of their stepfather, which became their surname after their mother remarried. The name of their biological [[father]] was Kawazu-Saburō.

==Authorship==
''The Tale of the Soga Brothers'' origin cannot be traced to a single creator.  Like most of these historical stories, it is the result of the compounding of (often differing) versions passed down through an oral or other tradition. The origin of the story may be true, but the story is probably [[Romanticism|romanticised]]. In some versions of the story it is only revealed at the end that the main character is actually one of the brothers.

==Theme==
''The Tale of the Soga Brothers'' is an example of "blood [[revenge]]", similar to a [[Feud|vendetta]].

==Plot==
Events take place in [[Japan]] in the [[12th century]]. The general accepted version is that the father of the two boys was killed (the reasons differ, but it was probably an argument over [[Land law|land rights]]) when they were infants. As adults they became skilled fighters intent on avenging their father and retrieving his sword Tomokirimaru. The villain is usually Kudō Suketsune, a [[Bastard feudalism|retainer]] of the ''[[shōgun]]'' (probably [[Minamoto no Yoritomo]]). Jūrō is killed in the fighting as is Kudō Suketsune. Gorō dies later (by [[Capital punishment|execution]]).

==In popular culture==
The story has been the subject of many [[Noh]], [[kabuki]] and [[bunraku]] performances. There are also updated versions such as [[Sukeroku]] (''The Flower of Edo'') (an [[18th century]] kabuki play, which is regarded as one of the ''[[Kabuki Jūhachiban]]''). It is also said that the Soga tales in ''[[Kōwakamai]]'' are based on this tale.

The story and its performers have been popular subjects for [[Woodblock printing|woodblock prints]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hiroshige.org.uk/hiroshige/historical_subjects/soga_brothers/soga_brothers.htm The Tale of the Soga brothers by [[Hiroshige|Andō Hiroshige]]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[netsuke]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/Lot/four-ivory-netsuke-19th-century-5073449-details.aspx An example sold by [[Christie's]] in [[Amsterdam]] in 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[okimono]].

The story has also been the subject of a number of films.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1029158/ An example of a 1915 film on the IMDb website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1068856/ An example of a 1920 film on the IMDb website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notes==
In Japan there are many statues of the brothers (such as the famous statue in the [[Hachiman Jinja]] in [[Kawazu, Shizuoka]]). According to tradition they were buried at the foot of [[Mount Fuji]], there is a sculpture of their tombs among the stone statues in [[Hakone]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hakone.or.jp/en/midokoro/sekifutsugun.html The Stone Statues on the Hakone Tourism Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Otodome Falls]] is one of the locations in a version of the tale from the [[Kamakura period]].

There is no relation with the [[Soga clan]].

==Translations==
The story was translated by Thomas J. Cogan.&lt;ref&gt;The Tale of the Soga Brothers; Cogan, Thomas J.; [[University of Tokyo Press]]; November 18, 1987; Hardcover: 336 pages; {{ISBN|978-0860084112}}&lt;/ref&gt; This translation was reviewed by Laurence Kominz in the [[Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2719304?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents Review in the Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies on [[JSTOR]]]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is spoken as a mother tongue by [[Somalis]] in [[Greater Somalia]] and the [[Somali diaspora]]. Somali is an official language of [[Somaliland]], [[Somalia]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.somalilandlaw.com/Somaliland_Constitution_Text_only_Eng_IJSLL.pdf Constitution of the Republic of Somaliland&lt;/ref&gt; a national language in [[Djibouti]], and a working language in the [[Somali Region]] of [[Ethiopia]]. It is used as an adoptive language by a few neighboring ethnic minority groups and individuals. The Somali language is written officially with the [[Somali Latin alphabet|Latin alphabet]].

==Classification==
{{main|Afroasiatic languages|Cushitic languages}}
Somali is classified within the Cushitic branch of the Afroasiatic family; specifically, as [[Lowland East Cushitic languages|Lowland East Cushitic]] along with [[Afar language|Afar]] and [[Saho language|Saho]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lewis|1998|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Somali is the best-documented Cushitic language,&lt;ref name="lm22"/&gt; with academic studies of the language dating back to the late 19th century.&lt;ref name="d9"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Dubnov|2003|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geographic distribution==
Somali is spoken by Somalis in [[Somalia]], [[Somaliland]], [[Djibouti]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Yemen]], [[Kenya]], and by the [[Somali diaspora]]. It is also spoken as an adoptive language by a few ethnic minority groups and individuals in these areas.

Somali is the second most widely spoken Cushitic language after [[Oromo language|Oromo]].&lt;ref name="s3"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Saeed|1999|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2006, there were approximately 16.6 million speakers of Somali, of which around 8.3 million resided in Somalia.&lt;ref name="eth"&gt;{{cite web | title = Somali | publisher = [[SIL International]]| date = 2013 | url = http://www.ethnologue.com/language/som | accessdate = May 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The language is spoken by an estimated 95% of the country's inhabitants,&lt;ref name="d9" /&gt; and also by a majority of the population in Djibouti.&lt;ref name="lm22"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lecarme|Maury|1987|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the start of the [[Somali Civil War]] in the early 1990s, the Somali-speaking diaspora increased in size, with newer Somali speech communities forming in parts of the [[Middle East]], [[North America]] and [[Europe]].&lt;ref name="eth" /&gt;

Constitutionally, Somali and [[Arabic]] are the two [[List of official languages by country and territory|official languages]] of Somalia.&lt;ref name="Frspc"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Federal Republic of Somalia - Provisional Constitution|url=http://www.somaliweyn.com/pages/news/Aug_12/Somalia_Constitution_English_FOR_WEB.pdf|accessdate=13 March 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130124010543/http://www.somaliweyn.com/pages/news/Aug_12/Somalia_Constitution_English_FOR_WEB.pdf|archivedate=24 January 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Somali has been an official national language since January 1973, when the [[Supreme Revolutionary Council (Somalia)|Supreme Revolutionary Council]] (SRC) declared it the [[Somali Democratic Republic]]'s primary language of administration and education. Somali was thereafter established as the main language of academic instruction in [[Form (education)|forms 1 through 4]], following preparatory work by the government-appointed Somali Language Committee. It later expanded to include all 12 forms in 1979. In 1972, the SRC adopted a [[Somali Latin alphabet|Latin orthography]] as the official national alphabet over several other writing scripts that were then in use. Concurrently, the [[Italian language|Italian]]-language daily newspaper ''Stella d'Ottobre'' was nationalized, renamed to ''Xiddigta Oktoobar'' ("The October Star"), and began publishing in Somali.&lt;ref name="Ammon"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Ammon|Hellinger|1992|pp=128–131}}&lt;/ref&gt; The state-run [[Radio Mogadishu]] has also broadcast in Somali since 1943.&lt;ref name="d10"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Dubnov|2003|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the regional public networks the [[Puntland TV and Radio]] and [[Somaliland National TV]], as well as [[Eastern Television Network]] and [[Horn Cable Television]], among other private broadcasters, air programs in Somali.&lt;ref name="Smmhctv"&gt;{{cite web|title=Somali Media Mapping Report|url=http://www.printfriendly.com/print?url=http://somali-media.so/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/2014_05_01_Somali-Media-Mapping-Report.pdf|publisher=Somali Media Mapping|accessdate=31 August 2014}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Somali is recognized as an official working language in the [[Somali Region]] of Ethiopia.&lt;ref name="Llicuv"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kizitus Mpoche, Tennu Mbuh, eds.|title=Language, literature, and identity|year=2006|publisher=Cuvillier|isbn=3-86537-839-0|pages=163–164|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PNEiAQAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it is not an official language of [[Djibouti]], it constitutes a major national language there. Somali is used in television and radio broadcasts,&lt;ref name="d9" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ethndjib"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ethnologue - Djibouti - Languages|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/country/DJ/languages|publisher=Ethnologue|accessdate=25 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the government-operated [[Radio Television of Djibouti|Radio Djibouti]] transmitting programs in the language from 1943 onwards.&lt;ref name="d10" /&gt;

The Somali language is regulated by the [[Regional Somali Language Academy]], an intergovernmental institution established in June 2013 in [[Djibouti (city)|Djibouti City]] by the governments of Djibouti, Somalia and Ethiopia. It is officially mandated with preserving the Somali language.&lt;ref name="Crslalid"&gt;{{cite web|title=Regional Somali Language Academy Launched in Djibouti|url=http://www.comesaria.org/site/en/news_details.php?chaine=regional-somali-language-academy-launched-in-djibouti&amp;id_news=17578&amp;id_article=119|publisher=COMESA Regional Investment Agency|accessdate=28 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Varieties==
{{main|Somali languages}}
[[File:Distribution-of-Somali-dialectals.png|thumb|Distribution of Somali dialectal groups in the Horn of Africa]]
Somali linguistic varieties are broadly divided into three main groups: Northern, [[Benadiri Somali|Benadir]] and [[Maay language|Maay]].&lt;ref name="Dalby2"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Dalby|1998|p=571}}&lt;/ref&gt; Northern Somali (or Nsom&lt;ref name="Lamberti2"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://dspace-roma3.caspur.it/bitstream/2307/3034/1/Map%20of%20the%20Somali%20Dialects%20in%20the%20Somali%20Democratic%20Republic.pdf|title=Map of Somali dialects in the Somali Democratic Republic|last=Lamberti|first=Marcello|date=1986|publisher=H.

[[File:Shaxmednuradc1.ogg|thumb|left|upright=0.81|Speech sample in Standard Somali (an Islamic discourse containing many Arabic loanwords)]]
Benadir (also known as Coastal Somali) is spoken on the central [[Indian Ocean]] seaboard, including [[Mogadishu]]. It forms a relatively large group. The dialect is fairly [[mutually intelligible]] with Northern Somali.&lt;ref name="s4"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Saeed|1999|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Northern_Somali_Dialects.png|thumb|Northern Somali (Nsom) dialect subgroups]]
Maay is principally spoken by the Digil and Mirifle ([[Rahanweyn]] or Sab) clans in the southern regions of Somalia.&lt;ref name="Dalby2"/&gt; Its speech area extends from the southwestern border with Ethiopia to a region close to the coastal strip between Mogadishu and [[Kismayo]], including the city of [[Baidoa]].&lt;ref name="s4" /&gt; Maay is not mutually comprehensible with Northern Somali, and it differs in sentence structure and phonology.&lt;ref name="Ethnymm"&gt;{{cite web|title=Maay - A language of Somalia|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/language/ymm|publisher=Ethnologue|accessdate=7 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also not generally used in education or media. However, Maay speakers often use Standard Somali as a lingua franca,&lt;ref name="s4" /&gt; which is learned via mass communications, internal migration and urbanization.&lt;ref name="Ethnymm"/&gt;

Maay is closely related with the [[Jiiddu language|Jiddu]], [[Dabarre language|Dabarre]], [[Garre language|Garre]] and [[Tunni language|Tunni]] varieties that are also spoken by smaller Rahanweyn communities. Collectively, these languages present similarities with Oromo that are not found in mainstream Somali. Chief among these is the lack of pharyngeal sounds in the Rahanweyn/Digil and Mirifle languages, features which by contrast typify Somali. Although in the past frequently classified as dialects of Somali, more recent research by the linguist [[Mohamed Diriye Abdullahi]] has shown that these varieties, including Maay, constitute separate Cushitic languages.&lt;ref name="Diriye"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Abdullahi|2001|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The degree of divergence is comparable to that between [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P5AZyEhMtbkC|title=Saints and Somalis: Popular Islam in a Clan-based Society|last=Lewis|first=I.

The consonants {{IPA|/b d̪ g/}} often weaken to {{IPA|[β ð ɣ]}} intervocalically.&lt;ref name="s8"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Saeed|1999|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The retroflex plosive {{IPA|/ɖ/}} may have an implosive quality for some speakers, and intervocalically it can be realized as the flap {{IPA|[ɽ]}}.&lt;ref name="s8" /&gt; Some speakers produce {{IPA|/ħ/}} with [[epiglottal trill]]ing.&lt;ref name="g14"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Gabbard|2010|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA|/q/}} is often [[epiglottal]]ized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Edmondson|Esling|Harris|n.d.|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The language has five basic [[vowel]]s. Each has a front and back variation as well as long or short versions. This gives a distinct 20 pure vowel sounds. It also exhibits three tones: high, low and falling. Vowels harmonize within a harmonic group, so all vowels within the group must either be front or back. The Somali orthography does not distinguish between the front and back variants of vowels, however, as there are few minimal pairs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ling.upenn.edu/courses/Spring_1998/ling202/atr.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The syllable structure of Somali is (C)V(C). Root [[morpheme]]s usually have a mono- or di-syllabic structure.

Pitch is phonemic in Somali, but it is debated whether Somali is a [[pitch accent]] or [[tonal language|tonal]] language.&lt;ref name="Ceolotw"&gt;{{cite book|last=Keith Brown|first=Sarah Ogilvie|title=Concise Encyclopedia of Languages of the World|year=2010|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=0080877753|page=987|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F2SRqDzB50wC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andrzejewski (1954) posits that Somali is a tonal language,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Andrzejewski|first1=Bogumit Witalis|title="Is Somali a Tone-language?", Proceedings of the Twenty-Third International Congress of Orientalists|date=1954|publisher=Royal Asiatic Society|pages=367–368|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/proceedings-of-the-twenty-third-international-congress-of-orientalists-texte-imprime-cambridge-21st-28th-august-1954/oclc/496050266|accessdate=26 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas Banti (1988) suggests that it is a pitch accent language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Banti|first1=Giorgio|title="Two Cushitic Systems: Somali and Oromo nouns", Autosegmental Studies on Pitch Accent|date=1988|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=3110874261|pages=11–50|url=http://www.ddl.ish-lyon.cnrs.fr/colloques/3L_2008/3LCourseMaterial/African%20(Cushitic)%20topics%20-%20M.%20Mous/cushTone/Banti%20Two%20Cushitic%20systems.pdf|accessdate=26 May 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171011132347/http://www.ddl.ish-lyon.cnrs.fr/colloques/3L_2008/3LCourseMaterial/African%20(Cushitic)%20topics%20-%20M.%20Mous/cushTone/Banti%20Two%20Cushitic%20systems.pdf|archive-date=11 October 2017|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Morphology===
Somali is an [[agglutinative]] language, and also shows properties of [[inflection]]. Affixes mark many grammatical meanings, including aspect, tense and case.&lt;ref name="d11"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Dubnov|2003|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Somali has an old prefixal verbal inflection restricted to four common verbs, with all other verbs undergoing inflection by more obvious suffixation. This general pattern is similar to the stem alternation that typifies [[Egyptian Arabic|Cairene Arabic]].&lt;ref name="Kraska"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kraska|first=Iwona|title=Analogy: the relation between lexicon and grammar|year=2007|publisher=Lincom Europa|isbn=3895868981|page=140|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FFxiAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Changes in pitch are used for grammatical rather than lexical purposes.&lt;ref name="s21"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Saeed|1999|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes distinctions of gender, number and case.&lt;ref name="s21" /&gt; In some cases, these distinctions are marked by tone alone (e.g. ''Ínan'', "boy"; ''inán'', "girl").&lt;ref name="s19"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Saeed|1999|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Somali has two sets of pronouns: independent (substantive, emphatic) pronouns and clitic (verbal) pronouns.&lt;ref name="s68"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Saeed|1999|p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; The independent pronouns behave grammatically as nouns, and normally occur with the suffixed article -ka/-ta (e.g. ''adiga'', "you").&lt;ref name="s68" /&gt; This article may be omitted after a conjunction or focus word. For example, ''adna'' meaning "and you..." (from ''adi''-''na'').&lt;ref name="s68" /&gt; Clitic pronouns are attached to the verb and do not take nominal morphology.&lt;ref name="s72"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Saeed|1999|p=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; Somali marks [[clusivity]] in the first person plural pronouns; this is also found in a number of other East Cushitic languages, such as [[Rendille language|Rendille]] and Dhaasanac.&lt;ref name="w43"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Weninger|2011|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As in various other Afro-Asiatic languages, Somali has gender polarity whereby plural nouns usually take the opposite gender agreement of their singular forms.&lt;ref name="Tosco"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tosco|first=Mauro|author2=Department of Anthropology |author3=Indiana University |title=Is There an "Ethiopian Language Area"?|journal=Anthropological Linguistics|year=2000|volume=42|issue=3|page=349|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MOZoAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=8 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="zp389"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Zwicky|Pullum|1983|p=389}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the plural of the masculine noun ''dibi'' ("bull") is formed by converting it into feminine ''dibi''.&lt;ref name="Tosco"/&gt; Somali is unusual among the world's languages in that the object is unmarked for case while the subject is marked, though this feature is found in other Cushitic languages such as Oromo.&lt;ref name="Saeed84"&gt;{{cite book|last=John I. Saeed|title=The Syntax of Focus &amp; Topic in Somali|year=1984|publisher=H. Buske|isbn=3871186724|page=66|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JxoOAAAAYAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Syntax===
Somali is a [[subject–object–verb]] (SOV) language.&lt;ref name="eth"/&gt; It is largely [[Head-directionality parameter|head final]], with [[postposition]]s and with obliques preceding verbs.&lt;ref name="hn253"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Heine|Nurse|2000|p=253}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are common features of the Cushitic and Semitic Afroasiatic languages spoken in the Horn region (e.g. [[Amharic language|Amharic]]).&lt;ref name="Wedekind"&gt;{{cite book|last=Klaus Wedekind|first=Charlotte Wedekind, Abuzeinab Musa|title=A learner's grammar of Beja (East Sudan): grammar, texts and vocabulary (Beja-English and English-Beja)|year=2007|publisher=Rüdiger Köppe Verlag|isbn=3896455729|page=10|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vs4XAQAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Somali noun phrases are head-initial, whereby the noun precedes its modifying adjective.&lt;ref name="hn253" /&gt;&lt;ref name="s164173"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Saeed|1999|pp=164, 173}}&lt;/ref&gt; This pattern of general head-finality with head-initial noun phrases is also found in other Cushitic languages (e.g. Oromo), but not generally in Ethiopian Semitic languages.&lt;ref name="hn253" /&gt;&lt;ref name="f53"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Fisiak|1997|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Somali uses three [[focus (linguistics)|focus]] markers: ''baa'', ''ayaa'' and ''waxa(a)'', which generally mark new information or contrastive emphasis.&lt;ref name="s117"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Saeed|1999|p=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Baa'' and ''ayaa'' require the focused element to occur preverbally, while ''waxa(a)'' may be used following the verb.&lt;ref name="s240"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Saeed|1999|p=240}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vocabulary==
[[File:Somlangbooks.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.81|Somali language books on display.]]
Somali [[loanword]]s can be divided into those derived from other Afroasiatic languages (mainly Arabic), and those of [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] extraction (mainly Italian).&lt;ref name="d71" /&gt;

Somali's main lexical borrowings come from Arabic, and are estimated to constitute about 20% of the language's vocabulary.&lt;ref name="l25"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Laitin|1977|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a legacy of the Somali people's extensive social, cultural, commercial and religious links and contacts with nearby populations in the Arabian peninsula. Arabic loanwords are most commonly used in religious, administrative and education-related speech (e.g. ''aamiin'' for "faith in God"), though they are also present in other areas (e.g. ''kubbad-da'', "ball").&lt;ref name="d71"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Dubnov|2003|p=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soravia (1994) noted a total of 1,436 Arabic loanwords in Agostini a.o. 1985,&lt;ref name="Versteegh"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Versteegh|2008|p=273}}&lt;/ref&gt; a prominent 40,000-entry Somali dictionary.&lt;ref name="s5"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Saeed|1999|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the terms consisted of commonly used nouns. These lexical borrowings may have been more extensive in the past since a few words that Zaborski (1967:122) observed in the older literature were absent in Agostini's later work.&lt;ref name="Versteegh"/&gt; In addition, the majority of personal names are derived from Arabic.&lt;ref name="s2"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Saeed|1999|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Somali language also contains a few Indo-European loanwords that were retained from the colonial period.&lt;ref name="Ammon"/&gt; Most of these lexical borrowings come from [[English language|English]] and [[Italian language|Italian]] and are used to describe new objects or modern concepts (e.g. ''telefishen-ka'', "television"; ''raadia-ha'', "radio").&lt;ref name="d73"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Dubnov|2003|p=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are as well 300 directly [[Romance languages|Romance]] loans, such as ''garawati'' for "tie" (from the [[Italian language|Italian]] ''{{lang|it|cravatta}}'').

Indeed the most used loanwords from the Italian are "ciao" as a friendly salute, "dimuqraadi" from Italian "democratico" (democratic), "mikroskoob" from "microscopio (microscope), "Jalaato" from "gelato" (ice cream), "baasto" from "pasta" (pasta), "bataate" from "patate" (potato), "bistoolad" from "pistol" (pistol), "fiyoore" from "fiore" (flower) and "injinyeer" from "ingegnere" (engineer)&lt;ref&gt;[http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:7Thq_9SLAjEJ:dspace-roma3.caspur.it/bitstream/2307/1021/5/06_A.%2520M.%2520MIONI%2520-%2520Italian%2520and%2520english%2520loanwords%2520in%2520somali.pdf+&amp;cd=3&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us Italian and English Loanwords in Somali, by Alberto Mioni]&lt;/ref&gt;. Somalis call their calendar months as Soon, soonfur, siditaal, carafa....but these changed recently{{When|date=November 2018}}. Furthermore, all the months in Somalian language are now loaned words from the Italian, like "Febraayo" that comes from "febbraio" (February){{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}.

Additionally, Somali contains lexical terms from [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Urdu]] and [[Hindi]] that were acquired through historical trade with communities in the [[Near East]] and [[South Asia]] (e.g. ''khiyaar'' "cucumber" from {{lang-fa|خيار}} ''khiyār'').&lt;ref name="d73"/&gt; Some of these words were also borrowed indirectly via Arabic.&lt;ref name="d73"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Admmahe"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Sheik-ʻAbdi|1993|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of a broader governmental effort to ensure and safeguard the primacy of the Somali language, the past few decades have seen a push in Somalia toward replacement of loanwords in general with their Somali equivalents or [[neologism]]s. To this end, the Supreme Revolutionary Council during its tenure officially prohibited the borrowing and use of English and Italian terms.&lt;ref name="Ammon"/&gt;

==Writing system==
{{main|Somali alphabets}}
[[File:Ciismaniya.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Osmanya alphabet|Osmanya]] writing script for Somali.]]
Archaeological [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavations]] and research in Somalia uncovered [[Ancient inscriptions in Somalia|ancient inscriptions]] in a distinct [[writing system]].&lt;ref name="MOIANG"&gt;Ministry of Information and National Guidance, Somalia, ''The writing of the Somali language'', (Ministry of Information and National Guidance: 1974), p.5&lt;/ref&gt; In an 1878 report to the [[Royal Geographical Society]] of Great Britain, scientist [[Johann Maria Hildebrandt]] noted upon visiting the area that "we know from ancient authors that these districts, at present so desert, were formerly populous and civilised[...] I also discovered ancient ruins and rock-inscriptions both in pictures and characters[...] These have hitherto not been deciphered."&lt;ref&gt;Royal Geographical Society (Great Britain), ''Proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society of London'', Volume 22, "Mr. J. M. Hildebrandt on his Travels in East Africa", (Edward Stanford: 1878), p. 447.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Somalia's Ministry of Information and National Guidance, this script represents the earliest written attestation of Somali.&lt;ref name="MOIANG"/&gt;

Besides Ahmed's Latin script, other orthographies that have been used for centuries for writing the Somali language include the long-established [[Arabic script]] and [[Wadaad writing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Omniglot - Somali writing scripts|url=http://www.omniglot.com/writing/somali.htm|publisher=Omniglot|accessdate=8 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Bogumił Andrzejewski]], this usage was limited to Somali clerics and their associates, as sheikhs preferred to write in the liturgical Arabic language. Various such historical manuscripts in Somali nonetheless exist, which mainly consist of Islamic poems ([[qasida]]s), recitations and chants.&lt;ref name="Andrezewski130131"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Andrezewski|first1=B. W.|title=In Praise of Somali Literature|publisher=Lulu|isbn=1291454535|pages=130–131|url=http://www.google.com/books?id=90CdBQAAQBAJ&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|accessdate=17 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among these texts are the Somali poems by Sheikh Uways and Sheikh Ismaaciil Faarah. The rest of the existing historical literature in Somali principally consists of translations of documents from Arabic.&lt;ref name="Andrezewski232"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Andrezewski|first1=B. W.|title=In Praise of Somali Literature|publisher=Lulu|isbn=1291454535|page=232|url=http://www.google.com/books?id=90CdBQAAQBAJ&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|accessdate=17 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then a number of writing systems have been used for transcribing the Somali language. Of these, the [[Somali Latin alphabet]], officially adopted in 1972, is the most widely used and the official.&lt;ref&gt;Economist Intelligence Unit (Great Britain), ''Middle East annual review'', (1975), p.229&lt;/ref&gt; The script was developed by the Somali linguist [[Shire Jama Ahmed]] specifically for the Somali language, and uses all letters of the English Latin alphabet except ''p'', ''v'' and ''z''. There are no [[diacritic]]s or other special characters except the use of the apostrophe for the [[glottal stop]], which does not occur word-initially. There are three consonant [[Digraph (orthography)|digraphs]]: DH, KH and SH. Tone is not marked, and front and back vowels are not distinguished.

Writing systems developed in the twentieth century include the [[Osmanya alphabet|Osmanya]], [[Borama alphabet|Borama]] and [[Kaddare alphabet]]s, which were invented by [[Osman Yusuf Kenadid]], [[Abdurahman Sheikh Nuur]] and [[Hussein Sheikh Ahmed Kaddare]], respectively.&lt;ref name="laitin"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Laitin|1977|pp=86–87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Superpower''' is a [[popular culture]] term for an imaginary [[superhuman]] ability. They are most frequently used in [[pulp magazine]]s, [[comic book]]s, [[science fiction]], [[television program]]s, and [[film]]s as the key attribute of a [[superhero]]. The concept originated in [[American comic book]]s and [[pulp magazines]] of the 1930s and 1940s, and has gradually worked its way into other genres and media.

== Definition ==
There is no rigid definition of a "superpower." In popular culture, it may be used to describe anything from minimal exaggeration of normal human traits to [[magic in fiction|magic]], flight, super strength, projection of destructive energy beams and force fields, invulnerability, telepathy, telekinesis, teleportation, super speed, or weather control.

Generally speaking, exceptional-but-not-superhuman fictional characters like [[Batman]], [[Iron Man]], [[Green Arrow]], and [[Punisher|the Punisher]] may be classified as superheroes even though they do not have any actual superhuman abilities. Similarly, characters with superhuman abilities derived from artificial, external sources, like the [[Six Million Dollar Man]]'s bionic limbs, [[Green Lantern]]'s [[Power ring (DC Comics)|power ring]], and Tony Stark's [[Iron Man armor]], may be described as having superpowers, but are not necessarily superhuman.

==Explanations in fiction==
In fiction, seemingly impossible superpowers are often given scientific, quasi-scientific, pseudoscientific, or supernatural explanations. Superpowers based on possible current or future technology, such as mechanized suits, rockets, [[bionics]] and [[genetic manipulation]], are typically explained using science and [[science fiction]]. Superpowers based on [[psychic]] and [[paranormal]] phenomena, for example, are typically explained using supernatural/otherworldly ideas, parapsychology, or even pseudoscience. Other superpowers may be explained using [[mythology]].

== Superpower diversification ==
[[File:CharacterProfile1.jpg|thumb|[[Role-playing games]] often described superpowers in terms of numeric values.]]
The 1970s brought the development of [[role-playing game]]s like ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ptgptb.org/0001/history1.html|title=RPG History Part One|website=ptgptb.org|access-date=2016-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Superhero-themed games soon followed, but within the [[game mechanics]] of [[role-playing game system]]s, issues such as the name or visible effects of a form of attack became apparent. The ''[[Champions (role-playing game)|Champions]]'' role-playing game handled this by describing powers by their effects rather than their causes; for example, a laser and a lightning bolt were both considered to be forms of a ranged attack. Another issue was that some powers were simply more useful than others in terms of gameplay; ''Champions'' handled this as well by assigning each power a "value" in a point system, with more powerful or useful abilities costing more points to "buy." ''Champions'' also gave players options to modify their characters' powers, allowing each character's abilities to be unique. This system has influenced many other similar games since.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

In the 1980s, Marvel Comics began publishing their ''[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe]]'' series, in which the powers of their characters were explained in great detail, often using scientific and [[pseudo-scientific]] terms. Issues of persecution in relation to the possession of superpowers have also been expanded upon; an example of this is the persecution of mutants in the ''X-Men'' series.

==In manga and anime==
Superpowers are a commonly used concept in [[manga]] and [[anime]], particularly in the [[shonen]] genre. They are often featured in popular manga and anime such as [[Attack on Titan]], [[My Hero Academia]], [[HunterxHunter]], [[Naruto]], and [[Code Geass]]. The types of powers featured vary from anime to anime. Some anime, such as [[Dragon Ball Z]], feature many different characters who have the same types of powers; others, such as [[One Piece]], feature characters with a wide range of different powers, with many powers being unique to only one or a few characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.anime-planet.com/characters/tags/superpowers|title=Superpowers Characters {{!}} Anime-Planet|website=www.anime-planet.com|access-date=2016-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Surplus Record''' is the leading independent [[business directory]] of surplus, new, and used [[machine tool]]s, [[machinery]], and [[Industry|industrial]] equipment in the United States. It was founded in 1924 by '''Thomas P. Scanlan'''.

The monthly directory, hundreds of pages long, has been referred to as "the bible of the used and surplus capital equipment industry".&lt;ref name="Obituary"/&gt; Postings were included online in the 1980s and online auctions started in 1999. A year later, in April 2000, FreeMarkets Inc. (Nasdaq: FMKT), a leading B2B eMarketplace, announced that it completed the acquisition of iMark.com Inc. including assets of Surplus Record Inc., as well as SR Auction Inc. The acquisitions were integrated with FreeMarkets' existing asset business to form the FreeMarkets AssetExchange, a leading B2B eMarketplace for buying and selling new and used assets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/freemarkets-announces-definitive-agreement-to-acquire-surplus-record-and-sr-auction-73189787.html] PR Newswire&lt;/ref&gt;

The Record's listings have included more than 70,000 industrial assets such as metalworking and fabricating machine tools, chemical and process equipment, cranes, air compressors, pumps, motors, circuit breakers, generators, transformers, turbines. More than 1,000 businesses list with the online [http://www.surplusrecord.com/index.html Surplus Record].

'''''The Hoax''''' is a 2006 American [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] starring [[Richard Gere]], directed by Swedish filmmaker [[Lasse Hallström]]. The screenplay by [[William Wheeler (screenwriter)|William Wheeler]] is based on the book of the same title by [[Clifford Irving]]. It recounts Irving's elaborate hoax of publishing an [[Clifford Irving#Fake autobiography of Howard Hughes|autobiography of Howard Hughes]] that he purportedly helped write, without ever having talked with Hughes. The film was ranked as one of the Top 10 of the year by the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' and ''[[Newsweek]].''

The screenplay was considerably different from the book. Hired as a technical adviser to the film, Irving was displeased with the product and later asked to have his name removed from the credits.

==Plot==
In 1971, publishing executives at [[McGraw-Hill]] express an interest in Clifford Irving's novel, ''Rudnick's Problem.'' ''Fake!'', his previous book about art forger [[Elmyr de Hory]], had sold poorly. Irving believes he has a breakout work, but the publisher decides against releasing the book after a ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' editor deems it unsatisfactory.

Vacationing with his friend and researcher [[Richard Suskind]], Irving is ejected from his hotel at 1 a.m, after eccentric billionaire [[Howard Hughes]] arrives and demands the entire building be vacated. Returning to [[New York City]] to meet with his publishers, Irving finds he has been reduced to meeting with an assistant. Irving storms into the board room, says his new project will be the "book of the century", and threatens to take it elsewhere. He struggles to come up with a topic fit for his grandiose claim. Seeing a cover story on Hughes, he decides to make him the subject. 

Irving tells McGraw-Hill that Hughes has recruited him to help write his autobiography, and shows forged handwritten notes from Hughes as proof. Handwriting experts confirm the notes as genuine, and the publishers strike a $500,000 deal for the book. Irving believes that the reclusive Hughes is unlikely to sue him, and that his eccentricities can be used to deflect any denials of authenticity for the book. 

At the time Irving is having marital problems with his artist wife Edith; he has had an affair. Irving assures Edith he will be faithful as he leaves to begin research with Suskind. To fool experts, the two men devote days to studying documents pertaining to Hughes. They illicitly obtain a copy of a draft biography of [[Noah Dietrich]], a retired Hughes aide, which provides details that add to the apparent authenticity of their work. Irving recites passages into a tape recorder while in character as Hughes, dressing like the millionaire and adding a mustache during these sessions.

As work on the book progresses, Irving receives a box containing scandalous material about questionable dealings between Hughes and President [[Richard Nixon]]. He believes that Hughes sent the package and convinces himself that Hughes wants this damaging material included in the book, as a sign he supports the work. 

As the publication date draws near, Irving elaborates his hoax, staging an "aborted" meeting between Hughes and the publishers. Hughes has officially denied that he was involved in the work, but the McGraw-Hill executives are convinced it is genuine. They begin to think it will be a bestseller and Irving works to gain larger payments for himself and (purportedly) Hughes. Irving and Edith concoct a scheme for her to deposit Hughes' check, payable to H. R. Hughes, into a Swiss bank account, using a forged passport with the name Helga R. Hughes.

The continuing drama makes Irving increasingly paranoid. He has alcohol-fueled fantasies about being kidnapped by Hughes' people. His affair with Van Pallandt continues, and the pressure of keeping up a pretense of fidelity with his wife adds to his stress. In what is implied to be a favor to Nixon, Hughes goes public via a televised conference call and denies any knowledge of Irving or the book. Irving is arrested and agrees to cooperate if Edith is granted [[immunity from prosecution|immunity]]. At a press conference, a government spokesman announces Irving, Edith, and Suskind have received short jail sentences.

An overheard radio report details a sudden wave of legal decisions in favor of Hughes. Irving believes this indicates that his book had been used to place the president in debt to Hughes. A fleeting scene set inside the Nixon White House suggests that Nixon's preoccupation with Hughes led directly to the [[Watergate scandal|burglary and wiretapping of Democratic Headquarters at the Watergate Hotel]]. Historians and political analysts dispute this.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/news/watergate-aviator-connection/ "Watergate Aviator connection"], CBS News&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
Portions of the film were shot in the [[Coachella Valley]], California.&lt;ref name=Filming&gt;{{cite web |title=Coachella Valley Feature Film Production 1920–2011 |url=http://www.visitpalmsprings.com/page/filming-in-palm-springs/126939 |work=Filming in Palm Springs |accessdate=October 1, 2012 |author=Palm Springs Visitors Center |location=Palm Springs, CA |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305201810/http://www.visitpalmsprings.com/page/filming-in-palm-springs/126939 |archivedate=March 5, 2016 |df= }} ♦ [http://visitpalmsprings.com/stream/126941?mode=Download Download]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }} ([[Portable Document Format|Downloadable PDF file]])&lt;/ref&gt; Irving was hired by the producers as technical adviser. The screenplay was changed considerably from the book, and Irving was unhappy with the result. He said, "after reading the final script I asked that my name be removed from the movie credits."&lt;ref name="CliffordIrving.com"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071224024956/http://www.cliffordirving.com/movie.php CliffordIrving.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==

[[A.O. Scott]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' said the film was "for the most part a jumpy, suspenseful caper, full of narrow escapes, improbable reversals and complicated intrigue. But it has a sinister, shadowy undertow, an intimation of dread that lingers after Irving’s game is up."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=A. O. Scott |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/2007/04/06/movies/06hoax.html |title=''New York Times'' review |publisher=Movies.nytimes.com |date=2007-04-06 |accessdate=2011-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kenneth Turan]] of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' said the film was "an unexpectedly satisfying fantasia of reality and imagination, a meditation on the nature of lies and deception, on how we come to embrace not the truth but what it suits us to believe ... sharply written ... and gracefully directed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calendarlive.com/printedition/calendar/cl-et-hoax6apr06,0,1743288.story |title=''Los Angeles Times'' review |publisher=Calendarlive.com |date=2007-04-06 |accessdate=2011-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Travers]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' rated the film 3 1⁄2 out of four stars and described it as a "devilish and devastating [[satire]]." He added, "Gere gives 'em the old razzle-dazzle with his roguish charm and sharp comic timing. The surprise is the unexpected feeling he brings to this challenging role."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/movie/9474909/review/14030358/the_hoax ''Rolling Stone'' review] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081005075623/http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/movie/9474909/review/14030358/the_hoax |date=October 5, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deborah Young of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' describe the film as a "breezy, fast-paced, somewhat loose-ended account [that] offers a surprisingly layered vehicle for a maniacally conniving Richard Gere, backed up by a superb Alfred Molina as his accomplice."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Young |first=Deborah |url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117931886.html?categoryid=31&amp;cs=1&amp;p=0 |title=''Variety'' review |publisher=Variety.com |date=2006-10-15 |accessdate=2011-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was ranked as one of the Top 10 of the year by the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' and ''[[Newsweek]].'' On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has received an 85% positive rate, based on 151 reviews,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1159135-hoax/ |title=RottenTomatoes.com |publisher=RottenTomatoes.com |date=2007-09-25 |accessdate=2011-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; while on [[Metacritic]], the film scored 70 out of 100, based on 37 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/hoax |title=Metacritic.com |publisher=Metacritic.com |date=2007-04-06 |accessdate=2011-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Box office==
''The Hoax'' was given a limited opening in 235 theaters in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] on April 6, 2007 and earning $1,449,320 on its opening weekend. It eventually grossed $7,164,995 in the US and Canada and $4,607,188 in foreign markets for a total worldwide box office of $11,772,183.&lt;ref name="bom"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=hoax.htm |title=BoxOfficeMojo.com |publisher=BoxOfficeMojo.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accolades==
The [[London Film Critics Circle]] nominated Alfred Molina for British Supporting Actor of the Year, and Richard Gere was nominated for the [[Satellite Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy]].

==Comparison to book and persons==
While the major events portrayed did take place, the film takes several [[dramatic license|dramatic liberties]]. It eliminates all scenes from the book set in [[Ibiza]], where Irving owned a farmhouse and wrote much of the book. 

The author described the film as "a historically cockeyed story" and decried its characterizations as inaccurate. He was unhappy with being portrayed as "desperate and humorless, a washed-up hack writer who lives in a conservative New York suburb." Irving observed, "The movie misses the point that the Howard Hughes hoax was a live-action adventure story concocted by two middle-aged [[hippie]] [[Expatriate|expat]] writers and a Swiss heiress. Edith, my then-wife, a woman of great zest, is portrayed as a dull hausfrau, and [[Nina van Pallandt]], my Danish mistress, as barely one level above a New York hotel hooker. Dick Suskind, witty friend and co-conspirator, is offered to the public as a self-righteous, sweaty buffoon. The scenes that deal with Movie Clifford feuding with Movie Dick, getting him drunk and hiring a [[bargirl]] to seduce him, are totally fictional. The Hughes people mailing the package of files to me is also made up."&lt;ref name="CliffordIrving.com"/&gt;

'''''The Night Eternal''''' is a 2011 [[vampire literature|vampire]] [[horror fiction|horror]] novel by [[Guillermo del Toro]] and [[Chuck Hogan]]. It is the final novel in ''The Strain Trilogy'' beginning with ''[[The Strain]]'' and continuing with ''[[The Fall (del Toro / Hogan novel)|The Fall]]''.

==Plot==

Two years have passed since the vampires, led by the Master, used [[nuclear weapon|atomic weapons]] to create a [[nuclear winter]], which blocked the sun and allowed the vampires to move freely, except for a few hours a day. The vampires restructured society as a [[police state]]. The strongest and the most influential humans were exterminated and those who were spared were made slaves. The weak were forced into camps to harvest their blood.

A few survivors manage to resist the vampire occupation. [[Epidemiologist]] Dr Ephraim Goodweather grows distant from his friends. The Master, occupying the body of rock star Gabriel Bolivar, adopted Goodweather's son Zach as his [[protégé]] and is grooming the boy to be his next host body. Goodweather's lover, Dr Nora Martinez, left him for exterminator Vasiliy Fet. Following the death of his friend Abraham Setrakian, Fet struggles to decipher the ''Occido Lumen'', a tome holding the key to defeating the Master. He is aided by Mr Quinlan, the vengeful [[Dhampir|half-vampire]] who was created when the Master infected his then-pregnant human mother.

Flashbacks to biblical times reveal the origins of the vampire race. The seven Ancients, including the Master, arose from [[Azrael|Ozryel]] - the [[archangel]] of death. Ozryel was one of the three angels that God sent to destroy the cities of [[Sodom and Gomorrah]] for their wickedness. Ozryel was overpowered by blood lust while he destroyed the cities, being particularly enthralled by blood itself. When committing other atrocities necessary for cleansing the world he had not actually glimpsed blood prior to destroying these cities. Soon after, he betrayed and attacked Michael, in order to drink his fellow archangel's blood.  Appalled by Ozryel's actions, God punished him by having the other archangels cut his body into seven pieces and scattering them across the Earth. Over time, Ozryel's blood leaked from the burial sites and became sentient, spawning the Ancient Ones. The Master was the last to spawn, from Ozryel's throat.

Goodweather deciphers the ''Occido Lumen'' and determines that the Master originated on one of the [[Thousand Islands]] located in [[Lake Ontario]]. The survivors detonate a nuclear weapon on the island, killing Goodweather, Zach, Mr Quinlan, and the Master. After the explosion, Nora and Vasily witness a reunion of the purified Ozryel with [[Gabriel]] and [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]], who had come to take Ozryel back to [[Heaven]]. The return was only made possible by Mr Quinlan, who brought the Ancients' ashes with him after following the instructions he read in the Lumen. After the Master's death, the remaining vampires disintegrate and the surviving humans are able to rebuild society.

==Reception==
[[Stephen King]] wrote: "Although there is a certain amount of dispensable hugger-mugger about vampires in [[Rome]] and [[archangel]]s located in [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Sodom]],the main attractions here is the resistance fighters' fierce dedication to their cause. [[Tragic hero|Heroes of tragic dimension]] are rare in popular fiction, but Goodweather fills the void perfectly. [...] The action is non-stop and the fantasy element is anchored in enough satisfying detail to make it believable. [... ] There's something about seeing vampires massing for an attack in a [[Wendy's]] parking lot, an act making them more real."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Toro|first1=Guillermo Del|last2=Hogan|first2=Chuck|title=The Night Eternal|url=https://www.amazon.com/Night-Eternal-Strain-Trilogy/dp/0061558273|website=Amazon|publisher=Harper|accessdate=January 22, 2013|language=English|date=26 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]''{{'}}s [[Alan Cheuse]] wrote: "The novel comes to us in a weird, loose style in which multiple view points proliferate, constantly shifting and re-forming the story, resembling nothing less than montage of fear-making moments that we love to hate."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cheuse|first1=Alan|authorlink=Alan Cheuse|title='The Night Eternal,' by Del Toro and Hogan: review|url=http://www.sfgate.com/books/article/The-Night-Eternal-by-Del-Toro-and-Hogan-review-2324101.php|website=SFGate|accessdate=22 January 2013|date=5 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This belongs to the 'post [[Sangam period|Sangam]] period' corresponding to between 100 – 500 CE. ''Tiṉaimozhi Aimpatu'' contains fifty poems written by the poet Kannan Chenthanaar.

The poems of ''Tiṉaimoḻi Aimpatu'' deal with ''agam'' (internal) subjects. ''Agam'' in the [[Sangam literature]] denotes the subject matters that deal with the intangibles of life such as human emotions, love, separation, lovers' quarrels, etc. The poems of ''Tiṉaimozhi Aimpatu'' are categoriesed into ten poems for each of the five ''thinai'', or [[Sangam landscape|landscape]] of Sangam poetry and describe in detail the situation and emotions specific to each landscape. The five landscapes of Sangam poetry are ''mullai'' – forest, ''kurinji'' – mountains, ''marutham'' – farmland, ''paalai'' – arid land and ''neithal'' – seashore.
