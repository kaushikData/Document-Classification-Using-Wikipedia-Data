The '''1985 Summer Universiade''', also known as the XIII Summer [[Universiade]], took place in [[Kobe]], [[Japan]].

==Mascot==

The mascot of the Kobe Universiade, "Unitan", designed by Osamu Tezuka, is a red-crested white [[Crane (bird)|crane]], symbolic of Japan and a good omen. The name was chosen from some 8,000 suggestions received from throughout the country. The name is derived from a combination of 'uni' from 'Universiade' and 'tan' from the Japanese name for red-crested crane, namely 'tancho-tsuru'.

==Gender test==
The [[Chromatin|sex chromatin]] test was used at these games to decide on participants' gender; Spanish hurdler [[Maria José Martínez-Patiño]] was declared a man and thus ruled ineligible for the women's events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Ruth Padawer |title=The Humiliating Practice of Sex-Testing Female Athletes |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/03/magazine/the-humiliating-practice-of-sex-testing-female-athletes.html?_r=0 |quote= |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=June 28, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ljungqvist&gt;{{cite book|last=Ljungqvist|first=A.|editor=Barbara L.

{{Yemeni Crisis (2011–present)}}
The '''aftermath of the Houthi takeover in Yemen''' refers to developments following the [[Houthis]]' takeover of the Yemeni capital of [[Sana'a]] and dissolution of the [[politics of Yemen|government]], which eventually led to a [[Yemeni civil war (2015–present)|civil war]] and the [[Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen]].

After seizing the capital in September 2014, the Houthis (Ansar Allah) obtained the resignations of President [[Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi]], Prime Minister [[Khaled Bahah]], and the cabinet in January 2015 and then moved to dissolve [[House of Representatives (Yemen)|parliament]] and instate a [[Revolutionary Committee (Yemen)|Revolutionary Committee]] to govern Yemen on 6 February 2015.&lt;ref name="shifting"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/26/world/middleeast/yemeni-parliament-cancels-meeting-on-presidents-resignation.html?_r=0|author=Mona El-Naggar|title=Shifting Alliances Play Out Behind Closed Doors in Yemen|year=2015|website=New York Times|accessdate=15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2015/02/yemen-houthi-rebels-announce-presidential-council-150206122736448.html|publisher=Al Jazeera|title=Yemen's Houthi rebels announce government takeover|date=6 February 2015|accessdate=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite their military successes and an alleged alliance with the former ruling [[General People's Congress (Yemen)|General People's Congress]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.alarabiya.net/en/perspective/analysis/2014/10/23/Eyeing-return-Yemen-s-ousted-Saleh-helps-Houthis-.html|publisher=Al Arabiya|title=Eyeing return, Yemen's ousted Saleh aids Houthis|date=23 October 2014|accessdate=22 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hub"&gt;{{cite news|agency=Reuters|title=Forces loyal to president seize parts of Yemen's economic hub|date=16 February 2015|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/02/16/us-yemen-security-idUSKBN0LK0R320150216|accessdate=16 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Houthis faced widespread domestic and international opposition to the coup and they assented to United Nations–led talks on a power-sharing deal.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-31359001|publisher=BBC News|title=Yemen talks hit by walkouts over Houthi 'threats'|date=10 February 2015|accessdate=10 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/security-council-hold-emergency-meeting-yemen-28984416|publisher=ABC News|title=UN Security Council OKs Resolution Against Yemen Rebels|first=Cara|last=Anna|date=15 February 2015|accessdate=15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least one analyst went so far as to suggest the Houthis' declaration "fizzled" in the days after it was announced, although they have Iran's material support and [[Ali Abdullah Saleh]]'s political support.&lt;ref name="Charles Schmit 2015"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mei.edu/content/at/yemens-ansar-allah-causes-and-effects-its-pursuit-power|author=Charles Schmit|title=Yemen's Ansar Allah: Causes and Effects of Its Pursuit of Power|year=2015|website=American Institute of Yemeni Studies|accessdate=15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 February 2015, one month after Houthi militants confined him to his residence in Sana'a, Hadi slipped out of the capital and traveled to [[Aden]], the old capital of [[South Yemen]]. In a televised address from his hometown, he declared that the Houthi takeover was illegitimate and indicated he remained the constitutional president of Yemen.&lt;ref name="plans"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2015/02/21/world/yemen-unrest/index.html|publisher=CNN|title=Yemen's Hadi flees house arrest, plans to withdraw resignation|date=21 February 2015|accessdate=21 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="unconst"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/02/yemen-leader-hadi-leaves-sanaa-weeks-house-arrest-150221090018174.html|publisher=Al Jazeera|title=Yemen's Hadi says Houthis decisions unconstitutional|date=21 February 2015|accessdate=21 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="malay"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/News/World/2015/02/22/Yemens-ousted-president-Hadi-calls-for-Houthis-to-quit-capital/|work=The Star|title=Yemen's ousted president Hadi calls for Houthis to quit capital|date=22 February 2015|accessdate=21 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hadi's ex-ministers were released by the Houthis on 16 March as a "goodwill gesture".&lt;ref name="freepm"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/03/yemen-houthis-free-prime-minister-house-arrest-150316100312247.html|publisher=Al Jazeera|date=16 March 2015|accessdate=16 March 2015|title=Yemen's Houthis free prime minister from house arrest}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 March, Hadi officially proclaimed Aden to be the temporary capital of Yemen, until his pledged recapture of Sana'a.&lt;ref name="capital"/&gt; Within days, however, a [[Southern Yemen offensive (2015)|Houthi-led military campaign]] wrested much of southern Yemen from Hadi's loyalists, prompting Hadi to flee his presidential palace in Aden&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/gregorydjohnsen/is-yemen-about-to-turn-into-a-regional-battleground?bftw=world#.abPmpj8zk|agency=BuzzFeed|title=Is Yemen About To Turn into A Regional Battleground?|first=Gregory|last=Johnson|date=25 March 2015|accessdate=25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Saudi Arabia]] to [[2015 military intervention in Yemen|launch airstrikes]] against Houthi positions throughout the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-32061632|agency=BBC News|title=Saudi Arabia launches military operation in Yemen - envoy|date=26 March 2015|accessdate=25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{Main|2014–15 Yemeni coup d'état}}
{{See also|Battle of Sana'a (2014)}}
The Houthis took control of much of [[North Yemen|northern Yemen]] by mid-2014. After President Hadi announced an unpopular cut to fuel subsidies, [[Abdul-Malik al-Houthi]] called for demonstrations. In September 2014, the protests gave way to [[Battle of Sana'a (2014)|full-blown fighting]] between Houthi militants and army forces loyal to General [[Ali Mohsen al-Ahmar]] in the capital city of [[Sana'a]].

In January 2015, Houthi forces assaulted the presidential palace and private residence of Hadi, placing the president and his ministers under virtual house arrest while demanding further concessions. Hadi and his cabinet resigned on 22 January.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-30936940|publisher=BBC|title=Yemen crisis: President resigns as rebels tighten hold|date=22 January 2015|accessdate=22 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three weeks later, on 6 February, the Houthis declared the [[House of Representatives (Yemen)|House of Representatives]] defunct and named a Revolutionary Committee led by [[Mohammed Ali al-Houthi]] as the acting authority in Yemen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Middle-East/2015/Feb-06/286654-yemens-houthi-rebels-announce-they-are-taking-over-the-country-dissolve-parliament.ashx|work=The Daily Star|title=Yemen's Houthis dissolve parliament, take over power|date=6 February 2015|accessdate=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political developments==
[[File:Jamal Benomar at Chatham House.jpg|upright|thumbnail|right|[[Jamal Benomar]], the United Nations special envoy to Yemen.]]

===In Sana'a===
====Cross-factional talks====
UN envoy [[Jamal Benomar]] mediated talks between the Houthis and other major factions in Yemen after the "constitutional declaration". However, the talks were hampered after delegates from the [[Nasserist Unionist People's Organisation]] and [[Al-Islah (Yemen)|Al-Islah]] reportedly walked out, claiming they were threatened by a Houthi representative.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Benomar announced a tentative agreement on 20 February that included the continuation of the [[House of Representatives (Yemen)|House of Representatives]] and the formation of a "people's transitional council" that would represent southerners, women, youth, and other minority groups.&lt;ref name="agreeon"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/02/yemen-feuding-parties-agree-transitional-council-150220065456873.html|publisher=Al Jazeera|date=20 February 2015|accessdate=19 February 2015|title=Yemen feuding parties agree on transitional council}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 February, the [[Southern Movement]] pulled out of negotiations on a political solution to the crisis. Hadi suggested moving the talks to [[Riyadh]], the Saudi Arabian capital, instead of continuing to hold them in Houthi-controlled Sana'a. However, the Houthis and GPC rejected the idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.yementimes.com/en/1864/news/4938/Houthis-GPC-No-talks-outside-Sana%E2%80%99a.htm|work=Yemen Times|title=HOUTHIS, GPC: NO TALKS OUTSIDE SANA’A|date=2 March 2015|accessdate=3 March 2015|first=Ali Ibrahim|last=Al-Moshki}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Hadi refused to participate in the UN talks while the Houthis held Sana'a on 4 March, Houthi fighters seized the headquarters of the [[National Dialogue Conference]], which Hadi had ordered to relocate to Aden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.voanews.com/content/reu-yemen-houthis-seize-national-dialogue-headquarters/2668927.html|title=Yemen's Houthis Seize National Dialogue HQ|date=5 March 2015|accessdate=5 March 2015|publisher=Voice of America}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Captive government officials====
On 16 February, former Yemeni President [[Ali Abdullah Saleh]]'s [[General People's Congress (Yemen)|General People's Congress]] (GPC) said it would accept the Houthi decree dissolving parliament. The same day, Benomar and [[Nadia Al-Sakkaf]]reportedly visited Hadi, still under house arrest in Sana'a.&lt;ref name="hub"/&gt; Hadi escaped Sana'a and fled to Aden five days later.&lt;ref name="weeks"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/02/yemen-leader-hadi-leaves-sanaa-weeks-house-arrest-150221090018174.html|publisher=Al Jazeera|title=Yemeni leader leaves Sanaa after weeks of house arrest|date=21 February 2015|accessdate=21 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 February, the Houthis ordered ex-Prime Minister [[Khaled Bahah]] and the cabinet to return to work, but they refused. The group threatened to place them under arrest and criminally charge them if they did not change their minds.&lt;ref name="charge"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/yemens-shiite-rebels-threaten-to-arrest-charge-ministers/2015/02/23/bfaccb48-bb5b-11e4-9dfb-03366e719af8_story.html|work=The Washington Post|date=23 February 2015|accessdate=23 February 2015|title=Yemen's Shiite rebels threaten to arrest, charge ministers}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Houthis also reportedly tried without success to get the House of Representatives to meet and formally approve Hadi's resignation.

HOUTHIS REJECT HADI'S LETTER TO PARLIAMENT|first=Ali Ibrahim|last=Al-Moshki|date=25 February 2015|accessdate=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 March, Ali Abdullah Saleh, the chairman of the General People's Congress, harshly criticised Hadi at a news conference in Sana'a. Saleh accused Hadi, his former vice president, of destroying the country and urged him to go into exile.&lt;ref name="exile"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/03/yemen-leader-asks-president-hadi-exile-150310134751759.html|publisher=Al Jazeera|title=Ex-Yemen leader asks President Hadi to go into exile|date=10 March 2015|accessdate=11 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Aden, Yemen Port.jpg|thumbnail|right|[[Aden]] became the southern refuge and temporary capital city for [[Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi]] and his government in the aftermath of the Houthi takeover.]]
A number of members of the dissolved parliament met in [[Aden]] on 15 February and declared it to be Yemen's new capital due to the "occupation" of Sana'a. They also called on the [[Gulf Cooperation Council]] to intervene with force against the Houthis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/02/yemen-meeting-called-security-scare-150215075459345.html|publisher=Al Jazeera|title=Anti-Houthi Yemenis call on GCC to intervene|date=15 February 2015|accessdate=15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The leaders of the [[Aden Governorate|Aden]], [[Lahij Governorate|Lahij]], and [[Al Mahrah Governorate|Mahrah]] governorates declared a joint "administrative, security, and political leadership" opposing the Houthi takeover.&lt;ref name="timesofoman"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesofoman.com/News/47326/Article-Yemens-Houthi-militiamen-defy-threats|agency=Times of Oman|title=Yemen's Houthi militiamen defy 'threats'|date=15 February 2015|accessdate=15 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150215214418/http://www.timesofoman.com/News/47326/Article-Yemens-Houthi-militiamen-defy-threats|archive-date=15 February 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fighters under the command of Hadi's brother Nasser claimed to have seized Aden's TV station and several government buildings in the port city by 16 February, although Governor [[Abdel-Aziz bin Habtour]] denied the station had been taken over.&lt;ref name="hub"/&gt;

Hadi, the former president, reportedly traveled to Aden on 21 February.&lt;ref name="weeks"/&gt; It was not immediately clear whether he evaded house arrest or was allowed to leave for the first time in a month,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/02/21/us-yemen-security-idUSKBN0LP08F20150221|agency=Reuters|title=Yemen ex-president released from house arrest|date=21 February 2015|accessdate=21 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fmr"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/22/world/africa/yemens-former-president-flees-capital.html?_r=0|work=The New York Times|title=Yemen's Former Leader, Held by Rebels, Leaves Capital|date=21 February 2015|accessdate=21 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; with some reports indicating that he escaped—in one telling, he disguised himself as a woman and stowed away on a food truck,&lt;ref name="fmr"/&gt; while in another, he was freed by special forces—and others suggesting he was released as part of an agreement between the Houthis and other factions.&lt;ref name="newgovt"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aawsat.net/2015/02/article55341755/hadi-to-form-new-government-declare-aden-as-capital-of-yemen-sources|agency=Asharq al-Awsat|title=Hadi to form new government, declare Aden as capital of Yemen: sources|date=23 February 2015|accessdate=24 February 2015|first=Arafat|last=Madabish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://extra.globo.com/noticias/mundo/presidente-do-iemen-deixa-capital-do-pais-15402932.html|work=O Globo|language=Portuguese|title=Presidente do Iêmen deixa a capital do país|date=21 February 2015|accessdate=21 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon arriving in Aden, Hadi gave a televised address condemning the coup and saying all Houthi actions since 21 September 2014 were invalid and unconstitutional.&lt;ref name="plans"/&gt;&lt;ref name="unconst"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Almasdar Online|url=http://almasdaronline.com/article/68372|title=عاجل|language=Arabic|date=21 February 2015|accessdate=21 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He delivered the address under the title of [[President of Yemen|president]].&lt;ref name="malay"/&gt; In his speech, Hadi called for a resumption of the [[National Dialogue Conference]] in either Aden or [[Taiz]], cities outside the Houthis' [[Houthis#Administration|zone of control]].&lt;ref name="unconst"/&gt;&lt;ref name="malay"/&gt; The following day, he met with several southern governors.

Although he established himself in Aden, Hadi was suspicious of [[Ali Abdullah Saleh]] loyalists and Houthi sympathisers even within his hometown. He issued a decree on 2 March reassigning General [[Abdul-Hafez al-Saqqaf]] from the Special Security Forces in Aden to a bureaucratic position. However, al-Saqqaf refused to comply with the decree, amid reports that he did not view Hadi as Yemen's legitimate president.&lt;ref name="tensions"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.yementimes.com/en/1867/news/4960/Tensions-remain-high-in-Aden-over-SSF-position.htm|agency=The Yemen Times|title=TENSIONS REMAIN HIGH IN ADEN OVER SSF POSITION|date=11 March 2015|accessdate=31 March 2015|first=Ali Ibrahim|last=Al-Moshki}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After an [[Battle of Aden Airport|attack]] on [[Aden International Airport]] by al-Saqqaf's commandos, as well as a missile strike by a Houthi jet on his presidential palace, on 19 March, Hadi gave a televised address urging all factions to participate in mediated talks on the country's future in [[Riyadh]] and predicting that the Houthis' "Iranian agenda" would fail.&lt;ref name="cnn"/&gt; On 21 March, he also officially declared Aden to be Yemen's "economic and temporary capital" due to the Houthi occupation of Sana'a, which he pledged would be retaken.&lt;ref name="capital"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dw.de/yemens-president-hadi-declares-new-temporary-capital/a-18332197|publisher=Deutsche Welle|title=Yemen's President Hadi declares new 'temporary capital'|date=21 March 2015|accessdate=21 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just days later, however, Hadi fled Aden as Houthi forces [[Southern Yemen offensive (2015)#25 March|advanced on the city]] on 25 March.

[[File:Attukal pongala1.JPG|thumb|Women gathering as part of Attukal pongala]]
'''Attukal Pongala''' is a 10-day festival celebrated at the [[Attukal Temple]], [[Thiruvananthapuram]], [[Kerala, India]], during which there is a huge gathering of millions of women on the ninth day. These women prepare a divine food made of rice in earthen pots and offer it to the Goddess of the Temple.

The festival is marked as the largest annual gathering of women by the Guinness World Records. This is the first Pongala festival in Kerala. The ceremony was set up in Guinness Book of World Records on February 23, 1997, when 1.5 million women participated in Pongala.&lt;ref name="hindu"&gt;{{cite news|title=Ponkala makes it to Guinness|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/ponkala-makes-it-to-guinness/article3061478.ece|agency=The Hindu|date=2012-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, a new Guinness World Records celebrated 2.5 million attendance.&lt;ref name="Guinness"&gt;{{cite web|title=Largest gathering of women|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/largest-annual-gathering-of-women|website=Guinness World Records|publisher=Guinness World Records}}&lt;/ref&gt; This temple is also known by the name [[Sabarimala]] of women.&lt;ref name="newkerala"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ponmelil|first1=V.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Some Editions of the Bannawag Magazine.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Some copies of ''Bannawag'' issues]] --&gt;

'''''Bannawag''''' ([[Iloko]] word meaning "dawn") is a Philippine weekly magazine published in the [[Philippines]] by Liwayway Publications Inc. It contains serialized novels/comics, [[short stories]], poetry, essays, news features, entertainment news and articles, among others, that are written in Ilokano, a language common in the northern regions of the Philippines.

''Bannawag'' has been acknowledged as one foundation of the existence of contemporary Iloko literature. It is through the ''Bannawag'' that every [[Ilokano writers|Ilokano writer]] has proved his mettle by publishing his first Iloko short story, poetry, or essay, and thereafter his succeeding works, in its pages. The magazine is also instrumental in the establishment of [[GUMIL Filipinas]], the umbrella organization of Ilokano writers in the Philippines and in other countries.

==History==
Bannawag magazine was conceived in 1934 when [[Magdaleno A. Abaya]] of Candon, Ilocos Sur, who was then a member of the editorial staff of the Graphic magazine, an English weekly published by the Roces Publications, presented the concept of an Ilokano publication to the management of the Graphic magazine. [[Don Ramos Roces]], the owner-publisher of Graphic magazine and other vernacular magazines which included [[Liwayway]], [[Bisaya]] and [[Hiligaynon language|Hiligaynon]], scoffed at the idea when Abaya presented the proposal to put a magazine for Ilocanos.

But Abaya did not lose hope until Don Ramos gave his consent-with condition that the first issues were only for a try-out, that after one or two months without improvement in the sales, it will be stopped. Abaya was elated and hurried to find willing companions to help him run  the magazine. In the end, he was able to persuade Mauro Peña to be the magazine's assistant and news editor, [[Francisco Fuentecilla]] of Zambales as assistant and news editor,; and Benjamin Gray, also of [[Candon]], [[Ilocos Sur]], as proofreader. Thus, Bannawag or "Dawn," or the Iloko equivalent of Liwayway, was born.

Bannawag's first issue on November 3, 1934 had a production run of 10,000 copies with a selling price of PHP 0.10 per copy. The magazine was an instant success beyond the belief of Don Ramon, and he allowed the continued publication of the magazine.

During the Second World War, the combined U.S. and Philippine Commonwealth ground troops to fought by the Japanese Imperial forces led by General Tomoyuki Yamashita around the fall the battles started the liberation in Northern Luzon in 1945.

When Roces Publications was sold to [[Hans M. Menzi]] in 1966, the name was changed to Liwayway Publishing, Inc. Thirty nine years later, in 2005, the publication of Bannawag was transferred to [[Manila Bulletin]] Publishing Corporation. [[Clesencio B. Rambaud]], [[Prudencio Gar. Padios]] and [[Juan Al. Asuncion]] were tasked to man Bannawag. However, Padios migrated to [[Canada]] in October 2006 and [[Ariel S. Tabag]] of [[Sta. Teresita, Cagayan]] was recruited to fill in the vacancy,

==New Bannawag==
''Bannawag'' underwent significant metamorphosis when its publication when taken over by the Manila Bulletin, from its content, color, quality of paper used, page layout, and other aspects to keep up with the needs of the times. These changes made the magazine more prestigious in its tasks in bringing entertainment, information, and inspiration to millions of readers in the language spoken  by hardly Ilocanos and in depicting the different aspects of the Ilocano character.

Recently, it was picked up by the department of education as one of the important references of the educational system in Ilocano-speaking areas in the country.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

==Present==
''Bannawag'' has gone a long way from its 10-centavo cost for each edition in the 1930s and is moving vigorously to live up the past as an important part of today and tomorrow's dream of the Ilocanos.

==Diamond jubilee==
&lt;!-- note: Bannawag is not yet online (provide URL of its site if it's now online, please... and the diamond anniversary is yet to happen.
It goes online on February 2, 2008 to face a wider audience. It has celebrated its Diamond Anniversary on November 3, 2009.
--&gt;
''Bannawag'' celebrated its [[diamond jubilee]] on November 3, 2009. In celebration of this, ''Bannawag'' launched the planting of Bannawag Diamond Jubilee trees in municipal parks and lots, school sites, and other public spaces.  Jim Domingo, a retired professor and university official of [[Cagayan State University]], was instrumental in the planting.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8184">{{for|the song Bui Doi|Miss Saigon}}
The Vietnamese term '''bụi đời''' ("dust of life") refers to [[vagrancy (people)|vagrants]] in the city, or, '''''trẻ bụi đời''''' to [[street children]] or juvenile gangs. From 1989, following a song in the musical ''[[Miss Saigon]]'', '''"Bui-Doi"'''&lt;ref&gt;Theater Yearbook 1990-1991: The Complete Broadway and Off-Broadway ... - Page 26 Otis L. Guernsey, Jeffrey Sweet - 2000 "Nowhere is the dichotomy of good intentions and cheesy realization more blatant then in the song "Bui-Doi," an appeal on behalf of the outcast, half-breed illegitimate offspring Americans left behind in Southeast Asia."&lt;/ref&gt; came to popularly refer  to [[Amerasian]] children left behind in Vietnam after the [[Vietnam War]].

==Rural poor coming to the towns==
[[File:Dust of Life (1957 film poster).jpg|thumb|right|222px|1957 film poster ''Dust of Life''.]]
The term ''bụi đời'' ("dust of life") originally referred to the starving people of the countryside taking refuge in towns, in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Philippe M. F. Peycam - ''The Birth of Vietnamese Political Journalism: Saigon, 1916-1930'' Page 24 2012 "Often referred to as bụi đời [dust of life], they were described by the communist newspaper of the 1930s, La Lutte, as the "starving people from the countryside taking refuge in towns." 42 Owing to the lack of heavy industry, ...&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''trẻ bụi đời'' "young vagrants," now refers to street children or juvenile gang members. It is intended to bring to mind an image of a child abandoned and moving about without purpose, like dust. In Vietnamese, it has no racial connotation. Vietnamese refer to Amerasians as ''Mỹ lai'' (mixed American and Vietnamese), ''con lai'' (mixed-race child), or ''người lai'' (mixed-race person).

The connection to mixed-race parentage given in Western media, from connection with ''Miss Saigon'', is not widely known in Vietnam today. The term ''bụi đời'' in Vietnam today refers to any people, but usually young men, who live on the street or live as wanderers. A related verb ''đi bụi'' ("go dust") means someone who has left their home, usually due to arguments with their family, to take on the ''bụi đời'' wandering or street life.

==Miss Saigon and Amerasian orphans==
In the West, the term '''Bui-Doi''' became widely known from the use in the dialogue, and particularly the song title "Bui-Doi", of the 1989 musical ''Miss Saigon'' by [[Claude-Michel Schönberg]] and [[Alain Boublil]], which opened in 1991 on [[Broadway theater|Broadway]], and, until its closing in 2001, was the eleventh longest running Broadway musical in musical theater history. The song "Bui-Doi" had lyrics written by Alain Boublil and Richard Maltby, Jr. They took the term ''bụi đời'' to mean not Vietnamese [[street children]], but the [[Amerasian]] offspring of American soldiers and Vietnamese mothers abandoned at the end of the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Bernstein, Gaylyn Studlar  Visions of the East: Orientalism in Film - Page 167  1997 "Here, the character John (an army friend of the male lead) stands facing the audience in front of a lectern on a dimly lit and bare stage. As he sings the number "Bui Doi" (dust of life), a collage of children's images is projected onto ...."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Theater Mania guide to musical theater recordings - Page 244 Michael Portantiere, TheaterMania.com (Firm) - 2004 "The French-speaking librettist Boublil's collaboration with Richard Maltby, Jr. yielded lyrics that are awkwardly ... Although it's difficult to pick the nadir of the score, a good candidate is "Bui Doi," a shamelessly manipulative plea on behalf of ..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. Andrew Lambert ''Beginning a Prayer Life'' Page 18 - 2009 "In Vietnam, children like me (Amerasians) were called Bụi Đời "dust of life" and we were hated and ostracized by Vietnamese society. I was left with another Vietnamese family for which my mother was to regularly pay what she could."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mixed race children in Vietnam==
{{main|Amerasian}}
The majority of mixed race people after the Vietnam war were Amerasians or children of Vietnamese mothers and military or civilian men from the United States. Amerasians born during the [[Vietnam War]] (1964–75) could be the issue of anything from long-term unions to rape. Due to the large sex industry brought on by the military economy, Amerasians were predominantly seen as off-spring of GI fathers and [[Prostitution in Vietnam|prostitute mothers]].  Life was frequently difficult for such Amerasians; they existed as pariahs in [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] society. Often, they would be persecuted by the communist government and sometimes even sold into prostitution as children.&lt;ref name=FrontPage&gt;{{cite web|last=Benge|first=Michael|title=The Living Hell of Amerasians|url=http://archive.frontpagemag.com/readArticle.aspx?ARTID=6535|publisher=[[FrontPage Magazine]]|accessdate=8 January 2011|date=22 November 2005|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140301204219/http://archive.frontpagemag.com/readArticle.aspx?ARTID=6535#|archive-date=2014-03-01|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the [[Amerasian Homecoming Act]] of 1988, a Vietnamese Amerasian could obtain a U.S. visa on the basis of appearance alone. Amerasians gained the attention of con artists who claimed to be their relatives in the hope of obtaining visas.&lt;ref name="Trin"&gt;''Surviving twice: Amerasian children of the Vietnam War'' By Trin Yarborough, p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; About 23,000 Amerasians immigrated to the U.S. under this act.

In the United States, ''bui doi'', or the term "dust of life", again referred to the criminal class, where the youths included newly transplanted Vietnamese and Amerasians.&lt;ref&gt;''The bubbling cauldron: race, ethnicity, and the urban crisis'' By Michael P. Smith, Joe R. Feagin, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; The misuse of the word ''bui doi'' also migrated to the United States and was appropriated by the mainstream.

==In popular culture==

The 1977 made-for-TV movie "Green Eyes" was a fictional movie about an American veteran who makes a trip back to Southeast Asia to search for his son from a liaison with a Vietnamese woman.  He encounters a boy with green eyes who insists that he must be half American and thus eligible to go to America.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

The 1994 documentary film ''Bui doi: Life Like Dust'' uses the term to describe Ricky Phan, a Vietnamese refugee who turned to a life of crime after escaping from Vietnam to California.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.idfa.nl/industry/tags/project.aspx?id=31e3f335-4486-4672-b646-91ddae0d7f59&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2004 movie ''[[The Beautiful Country]]'' depicts the life of a fictional ''bui doi'' and his efforts to become reunited with his American father. The prologue to The Beautiful Country opens with a definition: "Bui Doi: 'less than dust' Term used to describe Vietnamese children with American fathers."&lt;ref&gt;Soil and Culture - Page 92 Edward R. Landa, Christian Feller - 2010 "The prolog to The Beautiful Country (2004) is a definition: "Bui Doi: "less than dust" Term used to describe Vietnamese children with American fathers" The film follows such a Vietnamese young man, Binh, from his escape from Vietnam to ... "&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2014 movie ''[[Noble (film)|Noble]]'', a true life story of Christina Noble, who overcomes the harsh difficulties of her childhood in Ireland to find her calling by helping the bụi đời on the streets of Ho Chi Minh City.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

A '''cat organ''' or '''cat piano''' ({{lang-de|Katzenorgel}} or ''Katzenklavier'', {{lang-fr|orgue à chats}} or ''piano à chats/piano chats'') is a hypothetical [[musical instrument]] which consists of a line of [[cat]]s fixed in place with their tails stretched out underneath a [[keyboard instrument|keyboard]] so that they [[cat communication|cry out]] when a key is pressed. The cats would be arranged according to the natural [[pitch (music)|tone]] of their voices.

==Origins==

There is no official record of a cat organ actually being built; rather it is described in literature as a bizarre concept. "The details of the cat organ present it clearly as an instrument cat lovers might wish was a fictional horror."&lt;ref name="Betancourt"&gt;Betancourt, Michael (2011). {{Cite web |url=http://vagueterrain.net/content/2011/05/birth-sampling |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-04-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602011022/http://vagueterrain.net/content/2011/05/birth-sampling# |archive-date=2013-06-02 |dead-url=bot: unknown |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The instrument is used in stories which criticize the cruelty of royalty while the [[piganino]], a similar instrument using pigs, has been used to criticize the poor.

This instrument was described by the French writer [[Jean-Baptiste Weckerlin]] in his book ''Musiciana, extraits d’ouvrages rare ou bizarre'' (Musiciana, descriptions of rare or bizarre inventions):&lt;ref&gt;Weckerlin, Jean-Baptiste (1877). ''Musiciana, extraits d'ouvrages rare ou bizarre'', p.349. Paris: Garnier Freres. Cited in {{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=diEVidYxO7cC&amp;pg=PA195 |title=The Tiger In The House |first=Carl|last=Van Vechten|isbn=9781417967445 |date=2004-10-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|When the King of Spain [[Philip II of Spain|Felipe II]] was in [[Brussels]] in 1549 visiting his father the [[Emperor Charles V]], each saw the other rejoicing at the sight of a completely singular procession. At the head marched an enormous bull whose horns were burning, between which there was also a small devil. Behind the bull a young boy sewn into a bear skin rode on a horse whose ears and tail were cut off. Then came the archangel Saint Michael in bright clothing, and carrying a balance in his hand.

The most curious was on a chariot that carried the most singular music that can be imagined. It held a bear that played the organ; instead of pipes, there were sixteen cat heads each with its body confined; the tails were sticking out and were held to be played as the strings on a piano, if a key was pressed on the keyboard, the corresponding tail would be pulled hard, and it would produce each time a lamentable [[meow]]. The historian [[Juan Christoval Calvete]], noted the cats were arranged properly to produce a succession of notes from the octave... ([[chromatic scale|chromatically]], I think).

This abominable orchestra arranged itself inside a theatre where monkeys, wolves, deer and other animals danced to the sounds of this infernal music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weckerlin|first=Jean-Baptiste|authorlink=Jean-Baptiste Weckerlin|title=Musiciana, extraits d’ouvrages rare ou bizarre|location=Paris|date=1877|page=349}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The instrument was described by German physician [[Johann Christian Reil]] (1759–1813) for the purpose of treating patients who had lost the ability to focus their attention. Reil believed that if they were forced to see and listen to this instrument, it would inevitably capture their attention and they would be cured: "A fugue played on this instrument--when the ill person is so placed that he cannot miss the expression on their faces and the play of these animals--must bring Lot's wife herself from her fixed state into conscious awareness."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.uchicago.edu/research/jnl-crit-inq/issues/v24/v24n3.richards.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2007-05-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606101253/http://www.uchicago.edu/research/jnl-crit-inq/issues/v24/v24n3.richards.html# |archive-date=2011-06-06 |dead-url=bot: unknown |df= }} from Richards, Robert J. "Rhapsodies on a Cat-Piano, or [[Johann Christian Reil]] and the Foundations of Romantic Psychiatry", 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

The instrument was first described by [[Athanasius Kircher]] in his 1650 work ''Musurgia Universalis'', though the lack of an image may have left doubt in the minds of some writers. (''The New York Times'', for example, has carried an article claiming he described the instrument,&lt;ref name=NYT1&gt;{{Citation | last = Boxer| first = Sarah| title = A Postmodernist Of the 1600s Is Back in Fashion| newspaper = The New York Times | publication-place = New York| date = 25 May 2002| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/25/arts/a-postmodernist-of-the-1600-s-is-back-in-fashion.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm }}&lt;/ref&gt; and another stating he did not describe it in ''Musurgia Universalis''.&lt;ref name=NYT2&gt;{{Citation | last = Schuessler| first = Jennifer| title = A 17th-Century Genius, a Quack, or Perhaps Both | newspaper = The New York Times | publication-place = New York| date = 30 December 2012| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/31/books/a-man-of-misconceptions-by-john-glassie.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;). His description appears in Book 6, Part 4, Chapter 1, under the heading "Corollaria," (emphasis added):

[[Image:katzenkavalier.jpg|right|250px|thumb|from Gaspar Schott, ''Magia Naturalis'' (1657)]]

The citation is noted by Kircher's student [[Gaspar Schott]] in ''Magia Naturalis naturae et artis,'' Part 2, Book 6, Pragmatia 2, titled "Felium Musicam exhibere [Cat Concert]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Gaspar|last=Schott|authorlink=Gaspar Schott|title=Magia universals naturae et artis|date=1657}}: [http://lhldigital.lindahall.org/cdm/ref/collection/philsci/id/20194 Text] and [http://lhldigital.lindahall.org/cdm/ref/collection/philsci/id/20194 Image] at Linda Hall Library.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern citations and reconstructions==
[[Michael Betancourt]] compares the [[sampling (music)|sampling]] of cats' meows used in [[Jingle Cats]]' albums, ''Meowy Christmas'' (1993) and ''Here Comes Santa Claws'' (1994), to the cat organ,&lt;ref name="Betancourt"/&gt; in that both require cats, but diminish each performer's importance.

Kircher notes that the instrument can be used to reduce the melancholy of princes by moving them to laughter, almost exactly the situation that occurred in 2010 when [[Prince Charles]] was greatly amused by a performance of the tune "[[Over the Rainbow]]" on an instrument recreated using [[squeaky toy]] cats by [[Henry Dagg]] for a [[garden party]] held at [[Clarence House]] supporting Charles's [[Start Initiative|Start]] initiative for sustainable living.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-11273342 |title=Prince Charles' laughter over 'cat organ' |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=11 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1310898/Prince-Charles-interviewed-Daybreak-Adrian-Chiles-Christine-Bleakley.html |title=Please stop, one's sides are splitting! |first=Fay|last=Schlesing |date=11 September 2010 |journal=[[Daily Mail]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2009, [[The People's Republic of Animation]], a professional animation studio, released an animation titled ''[[The Cat Piano]]''. This work tells the tale of a city of cats whose musicians are kidnapped by a human in order to make a cat piano. This short film has received several awards, as well as nominations for awards. The Academy announced that it was shortlisted for an Oscar for Best Animated Short. However, it was not nominated.

The result of the [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|United Kingdom European Union Referendum of 2016]] was a victory for the "Leave" campaign, amassing a total of 51.9% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/25/world/europe/britain-brexit-european-union-referendum.html|title=Britain Votes to Leave E.U.; Cameron Plans to Step Down|last=Erlanger|first=Steven|date=23 June 2016|work=|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-07-15|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This meant that the outcome was in favour of the [[United Kingdom]] to leaving the [[European Union]], a decision and process that has commonly referred to as "[[Brexit]]". Consequently, [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|UK Prime Minister]] [[Theresa May]] [[United Kingdom invocation of Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union|triggered Article 50]] on 29 March 2017, starting the process of British withdrawal from the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/mar/29/theresa-may-triggers-article-50-with-warning-of-consequences-for-uk|title=May triggers article 50 with warning of consequence for UK|last=Walker|first=Peter|last2=Asthana|first2=Anushka|date=2017-03-29|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-11-24|last3=Stewart|first3=Heather}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The result provoked considerable debate as to the factors that contributed to the victory, with various theories and explanations being put forth. This page provides an overview of the different claims being made.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/britain/21702228-areas-lots-migrants-voted-mainly-remain-or-did-they-explaining-brexit-vote|title=Explaining the Brexit vote|last=|first=|date=16 July 2016|work=|newspaper=The Economist|issn=0013-0613|access-date=2016-07-15|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/personal-values-brexit-vote/|title=It’s NOT the economy, stupid: Brexit as a story of personal values|last=|first=|date=7 July 2016|website=|publisher=|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 'Leave' represented more popular positions ==
The 'Leave' campaign campaigned primarily on issues relating to sovereignty and migration,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36375492|title=EU referendum: Vote Leave focuses on immigration|publisher=BBC News|access-date=2016-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas the remain campaign focused on the economic impacts of leaving the EU. This choice of key positions is significant since [[Ipsos MORI]] survey data on which issues Britons felt to be 'important issues facing Britain today' shows that immediately prior to the vote, more people cited both the EU (32%) and migration (48%) as important issues than cited the economy (27%).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/3748/Concern-about-immigration-rises-as-EU-vote-approaches.aspx|title=Ipsos MORI {{!}} Poll {{!}} Concern about immigration rises as EU vote approaches|website=www.ipsos-mori.com|access-date=2016-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sovereignty ===

{{See also|Democratic deficit in the European Union}}
On the day of the referendum [[Michael Ashcroft|Lord Ashcroft]]'s polling team questioned 12,369 people who had completed voting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lordashcroftpolls.com/2016/06/how-the-united-kingdom-voted-and-why/|title=How the United Kingdom voted on Thursday... and why - Lord Ashcroft Polls|website=lordashcroftpolls.com|access-date=2016-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; This poll produced data that showed that 'Nearly half (49%) of leave voters said the biggest single reason for wanting to leave the [[European Union]] was “the principle that decisions about the UK should be taken in the UK”. The sense that EU membership took decision making further away from 'the people' in favour of domination by regulatory bodies is seen as having been a strong motivating factor for leave voters wanting to end or reverse the process of EU influence in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jennings|first=Will|last2=Lodge|first2=Martin|date=2018-05-31|title=Brexit, the tides and Canute: the fracturing politics of the British state|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/13501763.2018.1478876|journal=Journal of European Public Policy|language=en|pages=1–18|doi=10.1080/13501763.2018.1478876|issn=1350-1763}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Immediately prior to the vote, Ipsos MORI data showed that Europe was the third most highly ranked problem by Britons who were asked to name the most important issues facing the country, with 32% of respondents naming it as an issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/3748/Concern-about-immigration-rises-as-EU-vote-approaches.aspx|title=Ipsos MORI {{!}} Poll {{!}} Concern about immigration rises as EU vote approaches|website=www.ipsos-mori.com|access-date=2016-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Immigration ===
Lord Ashcroft's election day poll of 12,369 voters also discovered that 'One third (33%) [of leave voters] said the main reason was that leaving "offered the best chance for the UK to regain control over immigration and its own borders."'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lordashcroftpolls.com/2016/06/how-the-united-kingdom-voted-and-why/|title=How the United Kingdom voted on Thursday... and why - Lord Ashcroft Polls|website=lordashcroftpolls.com|access-date=2016-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Immediately prior to the referendum, data from Ipsos-Mori showed that immigration/migration was the most cited issue when Britons were asked 'What do you see as the most/other important issue facing Britain today?', with 48% of respondents mentioning it when surveyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/3748/Concern-about-immigration-rises-as-EU-vote-approaches.aspx|title=Concern about immigration rises as EU vote approaches|website=www.ipsos-mori.com|access-date=2016-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the decade before the Brexit [[referendum]] there was a significant increase in migration from EU countries, as outlined by the [[Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford|Migration Observatory]]:
'Inflows of EU nationals migrating to the UK stood at 268,000 in 2014, up from 201,000 in 2013. EU inflows were mainly flat for the 1991–2003 period, averaging close to 61,000 per year.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/briefings/migration-flows-a8-and-other-eu-migrants-and-uk|title=EU Migration to and from the UK |website=www.migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk|access-date=2016-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[The Economist]]'', areas that saw increases of over 200% in foreign-born population between 2001 and 2014 saw a majority of voters back leave in 94% of cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/britain/21702228-areas-lots-migrants-voted-mainly-remain-or-did-they-explaining-brexit-vote|title=Explaining the Brexit vote|newspaper=The Economist|issn=0013-0613|access-date=2016-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Economist concluded 'High numbers of migrants don’t bother Britons; high rates of change do.' Consistent with that notion, research suggests that areas that saw significant influx of migration from Eastern Europe following the accession of 12 mainly Eastern European countries to the [[European Union]] in 2004 saw significant growth in support for [[UKIP]] and more likely to vote to leave the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.trfetzer.com/does-migration-cause-extreme-voting/ |title= Does Migration Cause Extreme Voting?|last=Becker and Fetzer|date=October 2016|work= University of Warwick|access-date= 27 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Academic research investigating differences in Brexit vote among local authorities concluded that the Brexit vote was bigger in areas that had seen a large rise in the proportion of immigrants between 2004 and 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1360780417724067|title= Investigating Differences in Brexit-vote Among Local Authorities in the UK: An Ecological Study on Migration- and Economy-related Issues'|first=Peter|last=Tammes|date=September 2017|work= Sociological Research Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goodwin and Milazzo say that "in areas where there were previously few migrants, increases in immigration will have a more noticeable effect—and will be more likely to influence political behaviour" whereas ethnically diverse areas will perceive additional immigration as having little effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goodwin|first=Matthew|last2=Milazzo|first2=Caitlin|date=2017-06-08|title=Taking back control? Investigating the role of immigration in the 2016 vote for Brexit|url=https://doi-org.ueaezproxy.uea.ac.uk:2443/10.1177/1369148117710799|journal=The British Journal of Politics and International Relations|volume=19|issue=3|pages=450–464|doi=10.1177/1369148117710799|issn=1369-1481}}&lt;/ref&gt; They go on to explain that the non-British population of [[Boston, Lincolnshire|Boston in Lincolnshire]] became 16 times larger between 2005 and 2015, rising from 1,000 to 16,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goodwin|first=Matthew|last2=Milazzo|first2=Caitlin|date=2017-06-08|title=Taking back control?

Investigating the role of immigration in the 2016 vote for Brexit|url=https://doi-org.ueaezproxy.uea.ac.uk:2443/10.1177/1369148117710799|journal=The British Journal of Politics and International Relations|volume=19|issue=3|pages=450–464|doi=10.1177/1369148117710799|issn=1369-1481}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also argue that their data suggests that if Boston had experienced the UK average level of demographic change then the vote in favour of 'leave' would have been reduced by nearly 15% and they even suggest that areas such as [[West Lancashire (UK Parliament constituency)|West Lancashire]] may have had a majority for 'remain' if residents had experienced the average rate of demographic change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goodwin|first=Matthew|last2=Milazzo|first2=Caitlin|date=2017-06-08|title=Taking back control? Investigating the role of immigration in the 2016 vote for Brexit|url=https://doi-org.ueaezproxy.uea.ac.uk:2443/10.1177/1369148117710799|journal=The British Journal of Politics and International Relations|volume=19|issue=3|pages=450–464|doi=10.1177/1369148117710799|issn=1369-1481}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their research demonstrates why it is believed that the issue of immigration strongly affected voters' decisions.

== Demographic and cultural factors ==

=== Age of voters ===
It has been argued that the result was caused by differential voting patterns among younger and older people. According to [[Opinium Research LLP|Opinium]], 64% of eligible people aged 18–24 voted, whereas 90% of eligible individuals over 65 voted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/09/young-people-referendum-turnout-brexit-twice-as-high|title=EU referendum: youth turnout almost twice as high as first thought|last=Helm|first=Toby|date=10 July 2016|website=The Guardian|publisher=|access-date=2016-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is argued that older voters were more likely to vote 'leave' due to having experienced life in the UK prior to 1973, [[Accession of the United Kingdom to the European Communities|when the UK joined]] the [[European Economic Community]] which later became the [[European Union|EU]], and this memory as well as any potential nostalgia may have influenced their decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ac-els-cdn-com.ueaezproxy.uea.ac.uk:2443/S0176268016302701/1-s2.0-S0176268016302701-main.pdf?_tid=6d0f5f92-9d05-43af-a925-8cb10a9b5f00&amp;acdnat=1542971310_613ca2b974d36bfaf6625ddbc32b4aa0|title=On the causes of Brexit|last=Arnorsson|first=Agust and Gylfi Zoega|date=2017|website=European Journal of Political Economy|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=Nov 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, polls by [[Ipsos MORI|Ipsos-Mori]], [[YouGov]] and [[Michael Ashcroft|Lord Ashcroft]] all assert that 70-75% of under 25s voted remain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://fullfact.org/europe/how-did-young-people-vote-brexit-referendum/|title=How did young people vote in the Brexit referendum?|work=Full Fact|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore it has been argued that a higher turnout of older people and a lower turnout of younger people affected the overall result of the referendum as the older generation was more in favour of 'leave' than the 'remain' favouring younger voters. Additionally according to YouGov, only 54% of 25-49 year olds voted 'remain', whilst 60% of 50-64 year olds and 64% of over 65s voted 'leave' meaning that the support for 'remain' was not as strong outside the youngest demographic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2016/06/27/how-britain-voted|title=How Britain Voted {{!}} YouGov|access-date=2018-11-26|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The 'order versus openness' divide ===
Academic Eric Kaufman notes the relatively strong correlation between a voter's support for the [[death penalty]] and their choice to vote 'leave'.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/personal-values-brexit-vote/|title=It’s NOT the economy, stupid: Brexit as a story of personal values|last=|first=|date=7 July 2016|website=|publisher=|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; He says that this highlights a social division that he calls 'order versus openness'. He further argues that 'The order-openness divide is emerging as the key political cleavage, overshadowing the [[left–right politics|left-right economic dimension]]'.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

It is argued that data from the British Election Study suggests that support for the death penalty is an example of how valuing 'order' over 'openness' could have affected voting behaviour in the referendum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-36803544|title=The link between Brexit and the death penalty|last=Burton|first=Alex|date=2016-07-17|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-11-26|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who valued 'order' were more likely to support the death penalty and vote 'leave' than those who were 'pro-remain' and against the death penalty, which are stances considered to value 'openness' more.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-36803544|title=The link between Brexit and the death penalty|last=Burton|first=Alex|date=2016-07-17|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-11-26|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== The 'left behind' ===
[[Matthew Goodwin]] and Rob Ford coined the term 'The Left Behind' to refer to 'older, white, socially conservative voters in more economically marginal neighbourhoods'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/25/left-behind-eu-referendum-vote-ukip-revolt-brexit|title=Older ‘left-behind’ voters turned against a political class with values opposed to theirs|last=Ford|first=Rob|date=25 June 2016|website=The Guardian|publisher=|access-date=2016-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Analysing data the day after the Referendum, Ford concluded that 'Such voters had turned against a [[political class]] they saw as dominated by [[cultural liberalism|socially liberal]] university graduates with values fundamentally opposed to theirs, on identity, Europe – and particularly immigration.' This was described in as "if you've got money, you vote in... if you haven't got money, you vote out".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/commentisfree/2016/jun/24/divided-britain-brexit-money-class-inequality-westminster|title='If you've got money, you vote in ... if you haven't got money, you vote out'|last=Harris|first=John|date=24 June 2016|website=The Guardian|publisher=|access-date=2016-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many other academics have also suggested the link between voting 'leave' and a rejection of [[neoliberalism]] and [[Globalization|globalisation]] and the sense of economic insecurity that some members of society have felt as a result of these economic processes. Bateman suggests that today's globalised world has contributed to the feeling of fast-paced changes in society and the economy, leading to the sense of being 'left behind', which she argues motivated some voters to vote 'leave'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ukandeu.ac.uk/brexit-two-centuries-in-the-making/|title=Brexit: two centuries in the making - UK in a changing Europe|date=2016-11-23|work=UK in a changing Europe|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar manner to the arguments of Goodwin, Ford and Bateman it has also been suggested that both economically and socially 'left behind' groups "are united by a general sense of insecurity, pessimism and marginalisation", increasingly feeling as though liberalised society as well as the UK and European [[The Establishment|establishments]] do not represent their interests or share their concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goodwin|first=Matthew, J., and Oliver Heath|date=July-September 2016|title=The 2016 Referendum, Brexit and the Left Behind: An Aggregate-level Analysis of the Result|url=https://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=0&amp;sid=32b0a0b2-cff0-4ee6-a9cb-790da19bc438%40pdc-v-sessmgr03|journal=The Political Quarterly|volume=87|pages=323-332|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The left-behind hypothesis is furthered using data on the EU referendum result across electoral wards level as well as across local authorities, suggesting that especially areas with high degrees of social deprivation and low educational attainment strongly voted in favour of leaving the EU.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/economics/research/centres/cage/manage/publications/305-2016_becker_fetzer_novy.pdf|title='Who Voted for Brexit?

=== Britons felt less integrated with the EU than other European citizens ===
Academics James Dennison and Noah Carl argue that 'the most important phenomenon to be explained vis-à-vis the referendum result in our view is that a sizable {{sic}} Eurosceptic faction has remained extant in Britain over the last four decades'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2016/07/24/ultimate-causes-of-brexit/|title=Ultimate causes of Brexit|last=|first=|date=24 July 2016|website=|publisher=|access-date=2016-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using data from the [[Eurobarometer]] survey they showed that fewer Britons considered themselves European than any other EU nationality. Furthermore, they show that British trading patterns, capital flows and emigration patterns were the least Europeanised of any EU member state.

[[John Curtice]] says that if voters "felt that membership of the EU undermined Britain's distinctive identity were more likely to vote for Leave" and goes on to report that the same was true for voters "with a weak sense of European identity".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Curtice|first=John|date=2017-07-26|title=Why Leave Won the UK's EU Referendum|url=https://doi.org/10.1111/jcms.12613|journal=JCMS: Journal of Common Market Studies|language=en|volume=55|pages=19–37|doi=10.1111/jcms.12613|issn=0021-9886}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such research implies that how attached voters felt to either Britain or to the EU influenced their decision, voting in favour of whichever identity they felt more strongly attached to.

Furthermore in terms of integration, Britain had developed a reputation of being "an awkward partner" in Europe due to its reluctance to fully embrace European integration, opting-out of the [[Schengen Area]] and the [[euro]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thompson|first=Helen|date=2017|title=Inevitability and contingency: The political economy of Brexit.|url=https://content.ebscohost.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&amp;P=AN&amp;K=124022782&amp;S=R&amp;D=a9h&amp;EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Seqa44zOX0OLCmr1CeprRSsqa4SrKWxWXS&amp;ContentCustomer=dGJyMPGut1GxrrBQuePfgeyx43zx|journal=The British Journal of Politics and International Relations|volume=19|pages=434-449|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that Britain's reservations about European integration, as well as its historical stance of remaining less integrated than other EU states, laid the groundwork for the potential that Britain would decide to exit the bloc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thompson|first=Helen|date=2017|title=Inevitability and contingency: The political economy of Brexit.|url=https://content.ebscohost.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&amp;P=AN&amp;K=124022782&amp;S=R&amp;D=a9h&amp;EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Seqa44zOX0OLCmr1CeprRSsqa4SrKWxWXS&amp;ContentCustomer=dGJyMPGut1GxrrBQuePfgeyx43zx|journal=British Journal of Politics and International Relations|volume=19|pages=434-449|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== General identity issues ===

The [[World Economic Forum]] 2017 acknowledged in its Global Risks Report that "the Brexit and President-elect Trump victories featured (...) appeals to sovereignty rooted in national identity and pride" and that it would "be challenging to find political narratives and policies that can repair decades-long cultural fault-lines".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://reports.weforum.org/global-risks-2017/part-1-global-risks-2017/|title=Part 1 - Global Risks 2017|last=|first=|website=|publisher=|access-date=2017-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Presentational factors during the campaign ==

=== Misleading information ===
[[File:Vote Leave poster, Omagh.jpg|thumb|A "Vote Leave" poster in [[Omagh]] saying "We send the EU £50 million every day. Let's spend it on our NHS instead."]]
[[Michael Dougan]], Professor of [[European Union law|European Law]] at the [[University of Liverpool]], in a viral video of one of his lectures prior to the referendum, described the Leave campaign as peddling "dishonesty on an industrial scale".

Perhaps the most commonly criticised claim by the Leave campaign was that voting to leave the EU would allow for increased spending on the NHS of £350m a week.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.channel4.com/factcheck/factcheck-send-350m-week-brussels/22804|title=FactCheck: do we really send £350m a week to Brussels?|website=blogs.channel4.com|access-date=2016-07-31|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160708115949/http://blogs.channel4.com/factcheck/factcheck-send-350m-week-brussels/22804|archivedate=8 July 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itv.com/news/update/2016-04-15/vote-leave-unveils-first-billboard-of-referendum-campaign/ Vote Leave's early claim that the '350 million' will go to the NHS]&lt;/ref&gt;

Vote Leave claimed that the UK sends £350 million to the EU every week.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://digital.library.lse.ac.uk/objects/lse:paf829reh|title=Let's give our NHS the £350 million the EU takes every week {{!}} LSE Digital Library|website=digital.library.lse.ac.uk|access-date=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Treasury's own statement of the UK's contribution to the EU is that the net amount is £6.27 billion per annum. Divided by 52, this is approximately £120 million per week (net amount). Sir [[John Major]] claimed that Vote Leave had deliberately misled voters by using the gross contribution to the EU before the automatically deducted [[UK Rebate]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36454732 Major attacks Vote Leave 'deceit' as Johnson defends campaign] BBC News&lt;/ref&gt; The gross contribution is the amount the UK would pay under the standard formula before any discounts and rebates. The UK currently gets a 40% discount from the gross contribution which was negotiated by [[Margaret Thatcher]] in the 1980s (worth about £144 million) - but reduced by a new formula agreed by [[Tony Blair]] in the early 2000s - plus various agricultural, economic development and scientific research 'rebates' (worth approximately a further £96 million).&lt;ref&gt;Source: HMRC&lt;/ref&gt;

Elements of the Leave campaign have been identified as exemplifying "[[post-truth politics]]", in which debate is framed largely by [[appeal to emotion|appeals to emotion]] rather than the details of [[Public policy|policy]] or objective factual analysis.&lt;ref name="WaPo"&gt;{{cite news|title=Why the post-truth political era might be around for a while|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/06/16/why-the-post-truth-political-era-might-be-around-for-a-while/|author=Daniel Z.

=== Branding and wording choices ===
It has been argued that the 'Leave' brand was stronger and more effective than the 'Remain' brand. According to Mike Hind, a marketing professional, "The Britain Stronger In Europe brand was stillborn. On the basis of preparation, presentation and messaging, it deserved the kicking it got."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/epicfail-how-britain-stronger-europe-blew-basics-pr-marketing-hind|title=#epicfail How Britain Stronger In Europe blew it on the basics of PR &amp; marketing communications|date=18 July 2016|access-date=2016-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally behavioural practitioner Warren Hatter argues that 'Leave' as a word places a lower cognitive load on observers than 'Remain a member of'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://warrenhatter.wordpress.com/2016/07/20/the-brexit-referendum-through-a-behavioural-lens/|title=The Brexit Referendum Through a Behavioural Lens|last=Hatter|first=Warren|date=20 July 2016|website=The Ripple Effect|access-date=2016-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Prospect theory ===
Economics writer Chris Dillow has argued that, among other factors, [[Prospect theory|Prospect Theory]] may explain the surprising willingness of many voters to take a path widely viewed as the more risky of two (change vs status quo). In his words Prospect Theory 'Tells us that people who feel they’ve lost want to gamble to break even. This is why they back longshots on the last race of the day or why they hold onto badly performing stocks. People who had lost out from globalization, or felt discomforted by immigration, voted Leave because they felt they had little to lose from doing so.'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://evonomics.com/anger-elites-channelled-towards-voting-brexit/|title=Why Anger at Elites Was Channelled Towards Voting for Brexit - Evonomics|date=5 July 2016|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vote Leave analysis ===
[[Dominic Cummings]], Campaign Director of [[Vote Leave]] wrote in [[The Spectator]] in January 2017 on "how the Brexit referendum was won".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2017/01/dominic-cummings-brexit-referendum-won/|title=Dominic Cummings: how the Brexit referendum was won|publisher=The Spectator|date=2017-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He wrote: "Leave won because 1) three big forces [the [[European migrant crisis|immigration crisis]], the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|2008 financial crisis]] and the [[European debt crisis|euro crisis]]] created conditions in which the contest was competitive, AND 2) Vote Leave exploited the situation imperfectly but effectively, AND 3) [[David Cameron|Cameron]]/[[George Osborne|Osborne]] made big mistakes. If just one of these had been different, it is very likely IN would have won." 

"Pundits and MPs kept saying ‘why isn’t Leave arguing about the economy and living standards’. They did not realise that for millions of people, £350m/NHS was about the economy and living standards – that’s why it was so effective. It was clearly the most effective argument not only with the crucial swing fifth but with almost every demographic. Even with [[UK Independence Party|UKIP]] voters it was level-pegging with immigration. Would we have won without immigration? No. Would we have won without £350m/NHS? All our research and the close result strongly suggests No."

"If [[Boris Johnson|Boris]], [[Michael Gove|Gove]], and [[Gisela Stuart|Gisela]] had not supported us and picked up the baseball bat marked ‘Turkey/NHS/£350 million’ with five weeks to go, then 650,000 votes might have been lost."

== Historic policy decisions ==

=== Decision not to impose tougher migration restrictions ===
It has been claimed that the role of migration as a key factor in driving voting behaviour at the referendum originates from the relatively high levels of net migration into the UK in the last decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36574526|title=Eight reasons Leave won the UK's referendum on the EU|publisher=BBC News|access-date=2016-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular it is claimed that the decision not to impose restrictions on EU migrants after the addition of the 'A8' (Eastern European) countries to the EU in 2004&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/briefings/migration-flows-a8-and-other-eu-migrants-and-uk|title=EU Migration to and from the UK {{!}} The Migration Observatory|website=www.migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk|access-date=2016-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; (at a time when other European countries did impose such restrictions) contributed to a spike in migration levels that underpins contemporary voter attitudes.

=== European Migrant Crisis ===

[[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Donald Trump]] stated that [[German Chancellor]] [[Angela Merkel]]'s decision to open her country's borders for more than a million refugees and illegal immigrants was a "catastrophic mistake" and "the final straw that broke the camel's back", allowing the Leave campaign to win.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-38632485|title=Donald Trump says Merkel made 'catastrophic mistake' on migrants|last=|first=|date=16 January 2017|work=BBC|newspaper=|access-date=2017-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/donald-trump-times-bild-interviews-angela-merkel-germany-catastophic-mistake-refugees-a7528926.html|title=Donald Trump accuses Angela Merkel of making 'catastrophic mistake' on refugees|last=Nienaber|first=Michael |date=16 January 2017|work=|newspaper=The Independent|access-date=2017-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2017/01/15/politics/donald-trump-europe-immigration-merkel-brexit-interview/|title=Trump hints at European immigration restrictions|last=Krieg|first=Gregory|date=16 January 2017 |work=CNN|newspaper=|access-date=2017-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst campaigning for the [[GOP|Republican Party]] nomination for the upcoming [[2016 U.S. presidential election]], Trump already made similar statements prior to the EU referendum and immediately afterwards. For example, at a rally in [[Ashburn, Virginia]], [[United States|US]] he also suggested that more countries would leave the EU because of Merkel's decision. 

Whilst this is an example of Trump stating his opinion, there is evidence that the migrant crisis played a role in the outcome of the referendum. As already stated in this article immigration concerns were influential in voters' decisions and Goodwin and Milazzo assert that such concerns were "likely sharpened by the continuation of historically unprecedented levels of net migration and the arrival of a pan-European refugee crisis in 2015".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goodwin|first=Matthew|last2=Milazzo|first2=Caitlin|date=2017-06-08|title=Taking back control? Investigating the role of immigration in the 2016 vote for Brexit|url=https://doi-org.ueaezproxy.uea.ac.uk:2443/10.1177/1369148117710799|journal=The British Journal of Politics and International Relations|volume=19|issue=3|pages=450–464|doi=10.1177/1369148117710799|issn=1369-1481}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the migration crisis may have influenced the referendum result by intensifying a factor (immigration concerns) that was already seen as a motivation to vote 'leave'.  

Furthermore, [[Nigel Farage]] and long-term [[Euroscepticism|Eurosceptic]] party [[UK Independence Party|UKIP]] used images from the migrant crisis during their campaign due to the increased immigration anxiety the crisis caused, prompting criticism from some "Leave" and "Remain" supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2016/06/brexit-anti-immigration-ukip-poster-raises-questions-160621112722799.html|title=Brexit: UKIP's 'unethical' anti-immigration poster|last=Safdar|first=Anealla |date=28 June 2016|work=Al Jazeera|newspaper=|access-date=2017-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/19/eu-referendum-campaigning-resumes-as-jeremy-corbyn-and-michael-g2/|title=EU referendum: George Osborne compares Ukip ‘breaking point’ migration poster to Nazi propaganda|last=Riley-Smith|first=Ben|date=19 June 2016|work=|newspaper=The Telegraph|access-date=2017-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leading Leave campaigner [[Michael Gove]] said that it was "the wrong thing to do", whilst then-Chancellor [[George Osborne]] of the Remain side stated that the poster "had echoes of literature used in the 1930s" in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/19/eu-referendum-campaigning-resumes-as-jeremy-corbyn-and-michael-g2/|title=EU referendum: George Osborne compares Ukip ‘breaking point’ migration poster to Nazi propaganda|last=Riley-Smith|first=Ben|date=2016-06-19|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2018-11-30|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt; Criticism aside, the decision to use the migrant crisis to win votes for 'leave', suggests that the crisis was at the very least seen as something that had the potential to affect the referendum outcome.

== The role of the media ==

{{further|Euromyth}}
''[[The Guardian]]'' journalist [[Jane Martinson]] noted that many of the UK's biggest selling newspapers, ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' and the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' in particular, but also including ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' and ''[[Daily Express]]'', have been Eurosceptic for many years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jun/24/mail-sun-uk-brexit-newspapers |title= Did the Mail and Sun help swing the UK towards Brexit? |last=Martinson |first=Jane |date=24 June 2016 |work= The Guardian |access-date= 15 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The implication of this{{says who?|date=December 2018}} is that the political stance of the print media could have shaped the public's opinion before the referendum.

The [[BBC]] was also criticised by many remain-supporting pundits for [[false balance]] which helped give the leave campaign credibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/24/dont-blame-bbc-for-brexit-false-balance|title=A truly balanced view from the BBC: don’t blame us for Brexit|last=Harding|first=James|date=24 September 2016|work= The Guardian |access-date=24 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leading up to and during the EU referendum campaign, ''[[Daily Mail]], [[the Daily Telegraph]], [[Daily Express]]'' and ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' were all pro-Leave. Curtice argues that as these were "more popular" newspapers, their support not only provided credibility to the Leave campaign but also meant that there would be "sympathetic coverage" for its pro-Brexit arguments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Curtice|first=John|date=2017-07-26|title=Why Leave Won the UK's EU Referendum|url=https://doi.org/10.1111/jcms.12613|journal=JCMS: Journal of Common Market Studies|language=en|volume=55|pages=19–37|doi=10.1111/jcms.12613|issn=0021-9886}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seaton explains that long-term anti-EU reporting, demonisation of foreign nationals and the working class in mainstream media could have made the public more susceptible to pro-Brexit arguments, as well as having "shaped the debate".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Seaton|first=Jean|date=July-September 2016|title=Brexit and the Media.|url=https://content.ebscohost.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&amp;P=AN&amp;K=118000477&amp;S=R&amp;D=a9h&amp;EbscoContent=dGJyMNHX8kSepq84wtvhOLCmr1CeprVSs6m4TLCWxWXS&amp;ContentCustomer=dGJyMPGut1GxrrBQuePfgeyx43zx|journal=The Political Quarterly|volume=87|pages=333-337|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seaton also comments on the effect of social media on the referendum, which played a much more prominent role in the campaign and the vote than in previous votes in the UK. Seaton argues that social media was highly influential in shaping voters' opinions as social media enables users to "get more of what you like" whilst being able to "avoid exposure to what you disagree with" on a platform that is "driven by popularity".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Seaton|first=Jean|date=July-September 2016|title=Brexit and the Media.|url=https://content.ebscohost.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&amp;P=AN&amp;K=118000477&amp;S=R&amp;D=a9h&amp;EbscoContent=dGJyMNHX8kSepq84wtvhOLCmr1CeprVSs6m4TLCWxWXS&amp;ContentCustomer=dGJyMPGut1GxrrBQuePfgeyx43zx|journal=The Political Quarterly|volume=87|pages=333-337|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==

Mapping the [[plasmasphere]] around Earth may provide important insight for protecting both humans and electronics from radiation damage during long space journeys. It will also demonstrate low-thrust trajectory control techniques, such as multiple lunar flybys, within the Earth-Moon [[Lagrangian point]]s (EML).&lt;ref name=ASU/&gt;&lt;ref name='ISSL 2017'/&gt;&lt;ref name='Partners 2016'&gt;[https://www.nasa.gov/exploration/systems/sls/international-partners-provide-cubesats-for-sls-maiden-flight International Partners Provide Science Satellites for America’s Space Launch System Maiden Flight].

==Scientific payload==
[[File:Equuleus_IAU.svg|thumbnail| Several of EQUULEUS's instruments are named after the constellations that neighbor [[Equuleus]].]]

===PHOENIX===
''EQUULEUS''{{'}} scientific payload features a small [[Ultraviolet astronomy|UV telescope]] named PHOENIX (Plasmaspheric Helium ion Observation by Enhanced New Imager in eXtreme ultraviolet) that will operate in the high-energy [[extreme ultraviolet]] wavelengths. It consists of an entrance mirror of 60&amp;nbsp;mm diamemeter, and a [[Photon counting|photon counting device]]. The reflectivity of the mirror is optimized for the emission line of [[Helium hydride ion|helium ion]] (30.4&amp;nbsp;nm wavelength), which is the relevant component of the Earth's [[plasmasphere]].&lt;ref name='PHOENIX'&gt;[http://issl.space.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/equuleus/en/mission/phoenix/ Plasmaspheric Helium ion Observation by Enhanced New Imager in eXtreme ultraviolet]. EQUULEUS mission home page. Intelligent Space Systems Laboratory, The University of Tokyo. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The plasmasphere is where various phenomena are caused by the electromagnetic disturbances by the [[solar wind]]. By flying far from the Earth, the PHOENIX telescope will provide a global image of the Earth's plasmasphere and contribute to its spatial and temporal evolution.&lt;ref name='PHOENIX'/&gt;

===DELPHINUS===

DELPHINUS (DEtection camera for Lunar impact PHenomena IN 6U Spacecraft), or DLP, for short is a camera connected to the PHOENIX telescope to observe lunar impact flashes and near-Earth asteroids, as well as potential 'mini-moons' while positioned at the Earth-Moon [[Lagrangian point|Lagrangian point L2]] (EML2) halo orbit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://issl.space.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/equuleus/en/mission/delphinus/ DELPHINUS]. Intelligent Space Systems Laboratory, The University of Tokyo. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Theoretically, NEOs approaching Earth can be briefly caught within Earth's gravity well, and although in terms of [[orbital mechanics]] the object's movements is still centered around the sun, to an observer on Earth it will move as if it is a moon of the planet.&lt;ref name="dlppage"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://issl.space.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/equuleus/mission/delphinus/ |title=DELPHINUS |publisher=Intelligent Space Systems Laboratory |access-date=2017-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; One example of such an object is [[2006 RH120]], which orbited Earth between 2006 and 2007. If a mini-moon or NEO that can be rendezvoused by EQUULEUS is identified, the CubeSat will attempt a flyby.&lt;ref name="dlppage" /&gt; This payload occupies about 0.5 units out of the total 6 units volume.&lt;ref name=ASU/&gt; The results will contribute to the risk evaluation for future infrastructure or human activity on the lunar surface.&lt;ref name=ASU/&gt;

===CLOTH===

The instrument named CLOTH (Cis-Lunar Object Detector within Thermal Insulation) will detect and evaluate the [[meteoroid]] impact [[flux]] in the [[cislunar space]] by using dust detectors mounted on the exterior of the spacecraft. The goal of this instrument is to understand the size and spatial distribution of dust solid objects in the cislunar space.&lt;ref name=ASU&gt;[https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/smallsat/2017/all2017/33/ EQUULEUS: Mission to Earth - Moon Lagrange Point by a 6U Deep Space CubeSat].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8519">The '''critical load''' is the maximum [[Structural load|load]] which a [[column]] can bear while staying straight. It is given by the [[formula]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://mechanicalc.com/reference/column-buckling|title=Column Buckling|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:[[File:ColumnEffectiveLength.png|thumb|343x343px|''Fig. 1: Column effective length factors for Euler's critical load. In practical design, it is recommended to increase the factors as shown above.'']]&lt;math&gt;P_{cr}=\frac{\pi^2 EI}{(KL)^2}&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;P_{cr}&lt;/math&gt; = Euler's critical load (longitudinal compression load on column),
:&lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; = [[modulus of elasticity]] of column material,
:&lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; = minimum [[area moment of inertia]] of the cross section of the column,
:&lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; = unsupported [[length]] of column,
:&lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; = [[:File:ColumnEffectiveLength.png|column effective length factor]]

&lt;math&gt;   &lt;/math&gt;

This formula was derived in [[1757]], by the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[mathematician]] [[Leonhard Euler]]. The column will remain straight for loads less than the critical load. The "critical load" is the greatest load that will not cause lateral deflection (buckling). For loads greater than the critical load, the column will deflect laterally. The critical load puts the column in a state of [[Instability|unstable]] equilibrium. A load beyond the critical load causes the column to [[Failure|fail]] by [[buckling]]. As the load is increased beyond the critical load the lateral deflections increase, until it may fail in other modes such as yielding of the material. Loading of columns beyond the critical load are not addressed in this article.

Around 1900, J. B. Johnson showed that at low slenderness ratios an [[Johnson's parabolic formula|alternative formula]] should be used.

== Assumptions of the model ==
The following assumptions are made while deriving Euler’s formula:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://engineering.myindialist.com/2015/twelve-viva-questions-on-columns-and-struts/#.VzmNfvl97cs|title=Questions on Columns and Struts|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The [[material]] of the column is homogeneous and [[Isotropy|isotropic]].
# The compressive load on the column is axial only.
# The column is free from initial [[Stress (mechanics)|stress]].
# The [[weight]] of the column is neglected.
# The column is initially straight (no eccentricity of the axial load).
# Pin joints are [[friction]]-less (no moment constraint) and fixed ends are rigid (no rotation deflection).
# The [[Cross section (geometry)|cross-section]] of the column is uniform throughout its length.
# The direct stress is very small as compared to the [[bending]] stress (the material is compressed only within the elastic range of strains).
# The length of the column is very large as compared to the cross-sectional dimensions of the column. 
# The column fails only by buckling. This is true if the compressive stress in the column does not exceed the [[yield strength]] &lt;math&gt;\sigma_y&lt;/math&gt; (see figure 2):&lt;br /&gt;    [[File:FIG2.png|thumb|294x294px|''Fig. 2: Critical stress vs slenderness ratio for steel, for E=200GPa, Yield strength=240MPa'']]&lt;math&gt;   &lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;\sigma=\frac{P_{cr}}{A}=\frac{\pi^2E}{(L_e/r)^2}&lt;\sigma_y&lt;/math&gt;

For slender columns, critical stress is usually lower than yield stress, and in the elastic range. A stocky column would, on the contrast, have a critical buckling stress higher than the yield, i.e. it yields in shortening prior the virtual elastic buckling onset.


Where:

&lt;math&gt;L_e/r&lt;/math&gt; - Slenderness ratio

&lt;math&gt;L_e&lt;/math&gt; - The effective length, &lt;math&gt;L_e=KL&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; - Radius of gyration, &lt;math&gt;r=\sqrt{{\operatorname{I}\!\over\operatorname{A}\!}}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; - Moment of inertia

&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; - Area cross section

== Mathematical Derivation - Pin Ended Column ==

The following model applies to columns simply supported at each end (&lt;math&gt;K=1&lt;/math&gt;).

Firstly, we will put attention to the fact there are no reactions in the hinged ends, so we also have no shear force in any cross-section of the column. The reason for no reactions can be obtained from [[symmetry]] (so the reactions should be in the same direction) and from moment equilibrium (so the reactions should be in opposite directions).

Using the [[free body diagram]] in the right side of figure 3, and making a summation of moments about point A:

&lt;math&gt;\Sigma M= 0  \Rightarrow  M(x)+Pw=0 &lt;/math&gt;

where w is the lateral deflection.

According to [[Euler–Bernoulli beam theory]], the [[Deflection (engineering)|deflection]] of a beam is related with its [[bending moment]] by:
 
 &lt;math&gt;M = -EI\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^2w}{\mathrm{d}x^2} &lt;/math&gt;,

so:
[[File:Pin ended column under the effect of Buckling load.png|thumb|475x475px|''Fig. 3: Pin ended column under the effect of Buckling load'']]
&lt;math&gt;EI\frac{d^2w}{dx^2}+Pw=0 &lt;/math&gt;

Let  &lt;math&gt;\lambda^2=\frac{P}{EI} &lt;/math&gt;, so:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2w}{dx^2}+\lambda ^2 w=0 &lt;/math&gt;

We get a classical homogeneous second-order [[ordinary differential equation]].

The general solutions of this equation is: &lt;math&gt;w(x)= Acos(\lambda x) + Bsin(\lambda x) &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;A &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B &lt;/math&gt; are constants to be determined by [[boundary conditions]], which are:
* Left end pinned &lt;math&gt;  \rightarrow w(0)= 0  \rightarrow A=0 &lt;/math&gt;
* Right end pinned &lt;math&gt;  \rightarrow w(l)= 0  \rightarrow Bsin(\lambda l)=0 &lt;/math&gt;
[[File:FIG4.png|thumb|355x355px|''Fig. 4: First three modes of buckling loads'']]
If &lt;math&gt;  B=0 &lt;/math&gt;, no bending moment exists and we get the [[trivial solution]] of &lt;math&gt;  w(x)=0 &lt;/math&gt;.

However, from the other solution  &lt;math&gt;  sin(\lambda l)=0 &lt;/math&gt;  we get &lt;math&gt;  \lambda _nl=n\pi &lt;/math&gt;, for &lt;math&gt;  n=0,1,2... &lt;/math&gt;

Together with &lt;math&gt;\lambda^2=\frac{P}{EI} &lt;/math&gt; as defined before, the various critical loads are:

&lt;math&gt;P_{n}=\frac{n^2 \pi^2 EI}{l^2} &lt;/math&gt;, for &lt;math&gt;  n=0,1,2... &lt;/math&gt;

and depending upon the value of &lt;math&gt;  n &lt;/math&gt;, different buckling [[Longitudinal mode|mode]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s are produced&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.aeromech.usyd.edu.au/AMME2301/Documents/Chapter09.pdf|title=Buckling of Columns|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as shown in figure 4. The load and mode for n=0 is the nonbuckled mode.

Theoretically, any buckling mode is possible, but in the case of a slowly applied load only the first modal shape is likely to be produced.

'''The critical load of Euler''' for a pin ended column is therefore:   &lt;math&gt;P_{cr}=\frac{\pi^2 EI}{l^2}&lt;/math&gt;

and the obtained shape of the buckled column in the first mode is: &lt;math&gt;w(x)=  Bsin\Bigl({\pi \over l} x\Bigr) &lt;/math&gt;.

== Mathematical Derivation - General Approach ==
[[File:FIG 5.png|thumb|400x400px|''Fig. 5: forces and moments acting on a column'']]
The differential equation of the axis of a beam&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Theory of Elastic Stability, 2 ed., McGraw-Hill|author1=Timoshenko, S. P. |author2=Gere, J. M. |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher=|year=1961|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^4 w }{dx^4}+\frac{P }{EI}\frac{d^2 w }{dx^2}=\frac{q }{EI}&lt;/math&gt;

For a column with axial load only, the lateral load &lt;math&gt;q(x)&lt;/math&gt; vanishes and substituting &lt;math&gt;\lambda^2=\frac{P}{EI} &lt;/math&gt; , we get:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^4 w }{dx^4}+\lambda^2\frac{d^2 w }{dx^2}=0&lt;/math&gt;

This is a homogeneous fourth-order differential equation and its general solution is &lt;math&gt;w(x)= A\sin(\lambda x) + B\cos(\lambda x)+Cx+D &lt;/math&gt;

The four constants &lt;math&gt;A,B,C,D &lt;/math&gt; are determined by the boundary conditions (end constraints) on &lt;math&gt;w(x) &lt;/math&gt;, at each end. There are three cases:
# Pinned end:  &lt;math&gt; w= 0  &lt;/math&gt;  and  &lt;math&gt; M= 0  \rightarrow {d^2w \over dx^2}=0 &lt;/math&gt;
# Fixed end:  &lt;math&gt; w= 0  &lt;/math&gt;  and  &lt;math&gt; {dw \over dx}=0 &lt;/math&gt;
# Free end:    &lt;math&gt; M= 0  \rightarrow {d^2w \over dx^2}=0 &lt;/math&gt;     and        &lt;math&gt; V= 0  \rightarrow {d^3w \over dx^3}+\lambda^2{dw \over dx}=0 &lt;/math&gt;
Using each time a different combination of these BCs, [[Eigen value problem|eigenvalue problem]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s are obtained. Solving those, we get the values of Euler's critical load for each one of the cases presented in Figure 1.

After intital reports in February 2018,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Granger|first1=Anthony|url=https://eurovoix.com/2018/02/04/eurovision-choir-year-return-2019/|title=Eurovision Choir of the Year to Return in 2019|website=eurovoix.com|publisher=Eurovoix|accessdate=4 February 2018|date=4 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was confirmed on 8 July 2018 that the second edition of the Eurovision Choir of the Year will be held in the Swedish city of Gothenburg at the 12,000-seat [[Scandinavium]] arena.&lt;ref name="Hosts"/&gt; Construction of the arena began in 1969 after decades of setbacks, and was inaugurated on 18 May 1971. Scandinavium is the home arena for [[Frölunda HC]] of the [[Swedish Hockey League]], and venue for the annual [[Göteborg Horse Show]]. The venue also hosted the [[1985 Eurovision Song Contest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://eurovision.tv/event/gothenburg-1985|title=Gothenburg 1985 - Eurovision Song Contest Lisbon 2018|website=eurovision.tv|accessdate=8 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format==
Competing countries who are members of the [[European Broadcasting Union]] (EBU) are eligible to participate in the Eurovision Choir of the Year. Nine countries participated at the inaugural event in {{Escyr|2017|Choir}}. Each competing country was represented by a professional choir, and each performed a [[choral]] piece lasting no more than six minutes in length. Each piece may include singular or several musical works or of a free genre; but must contain national or regional influence from the participating country.

==History==

Event chain methodology is an extension of traditional Monte Carlo simulation of project schedules where uncertainties in task duration and costs are defined by statistical distribution.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; For example, task duration can be defined by three point estimates: low, base, and high. The results of analysis is a risk adjusted project schedule, crucial tasks, and probabilities that project will be completed on time and on budget. Defining uncertainties using statistical distribution provide accurate results if there is a reliable historical data about duration and cost of similar tasks in previous projects. Another approach is to define uncertainties using risk events or risk drivers, which can be assigned to different tasks or resources.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Information about probabilities and impact of such events is easier to elicit, which improves accuracy of analysis. Risks can be recorded in the [[Risk register]]. Event chain methodology was first proposed in the period of 2002-2004.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Event Chain Methodology is based on six principles and has a number of outcomes.

==Principles==

===Moment of risk and state of activity===

[[File:EventChainDiagramForOneActivity.png|thumb|355px|Event chain diagram for one activity]]Activities (tasks) are not a continuous uniform procedure. Tasks are affected by external events, which transform an activity from one state to another. One of the important properties of an event is the moment when an event occurs during the course of an activity. This moment, when an event occurs, in most cases is probabilistic and can be defined using [[statistical distribution]]. The original state is called a ground state, other states are called excited states. For example, if the team completes their job on activity, they can move to other activities. The notion of an activity's state is important because certain events can or cannot occur when activity is in certain state. It means that the state of an activity is subscribed to the events. Events can be local, affecting particular tasks or resources, or global affecting all tasks or resources.

===Event chains===

Events can be related to other events, which will create event chains. These event chains can significantly affect the course of the project. 
For example, requirement changes can cause an activity to be delayed. To accelerate the activity, the project manager allocates a resource from another activity, which then leads to a missed deadline. Eventually, this can lead to the failure of the project. It could be different relationship between events. One event can trigger one or multiple events.

Events can be correlated with each other without one triggering another one. In this case if one risk has occurred, another one will occur and vice versa. One event assigned in one activity can execute another activity or group of activities. In many cases it the execution of risk response plans. For example, event “structural defect is discovered” can cause one or many activities “Repair”. Events can cause other events to occur either immediately or with a delay. The delay is a property of the event subscription. The delay can be deterministic, but in most cases, it is probabilistic. Also risks can be transferred from one activity to another. To define event chains, we need to identify a "sender", the event that initiates the chain of events. The sender event can cause one or more events that effect multiple activities. These are called "receiver" events. In turn, the receiver events can also act as sender events.

===Event chain diagrams===
[[File:EventChainDiagramExample1.png|355px|thumb|Example of event chain diagram: local and global threats and opportunities with different probabilities and impacts]]
[[Event chain diagram]] is a visualization that shows the relationships between events and tasks and how the events affect each other.&lt;ref&gt;Virine, Lev &amp; McVean, Jason. (2004). Visual Modeling of Business Problems: Workflow and Patterns, In Proceedings of 2004 Winter Simulation Conference, Washington DC.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
Virine, Lev &amp; Rapley, Lisa. (2003). Visualization of Probabilistic Business Models, In Proceedings of 2003 Winter Simulation Conference, New Orleans, LA.&lt;/ref&gt; The simplest way to represent these chains is to depict them as arrows associated with certain tasks or time intervals on the Gantt chart. Here are a few important rules:

*Event chains diagrams present events as arrows on the Gantt charts.  
*Arrows pointing down are threats. Arrows pointing up are opportunities. 
*Issues are shown as an arrow within a circle. Color of the issue arrow is red (dark).
*Closed or transferred risks are shown using dashed lines. Color of arrow is white. Closed issue is shown in the circle with dashed border line. 
*Excited states are represented by elevating the associated section of the bar on the Gantt chart. 
*Colors represent the calculated impact of the risk. Higher impacts are red or darker shade. Low impacts are green or lighter shade. The size of the arrow represents probability.
*Event chains are shown as lines connecting arrows depicting events.
*Event chains may trigger another activity. In this case event chain line will be connected with the beginning of activity with optional arrow.
*Event chains may trigger a group of activities. In this case this group of activities will be surrounded by the box or frame and event chain line will be connected to the corner of the box or first activity within a frame.
By using event chain diagrams to visualize events and event chains, the modeling and analysis of risks and uncertainties can be significantly simplified.

[[File:EventChainDiagramExample.png|355px|thumb|Example of event chain diagram with critical event chain and activity triggered by event]]
Another tool that can be used to simplify the definition of events is a state table. Columns in the state table represent events; rows represent the states of an activity. Information for each event in each state includes four properties of event subscription: probability, moment of event, excited state, and impact of the event.

===Monte Carlo simulation===
Once events and event chains are defined, quantitative analysis using [[Monte Carlo simulation]] can be performed to quantify the cumulative effect of the events.&lt;ref&gt;Goran Avlijas. (2018). Examining the Value of Monte Carlo Simulation for Project Time Management. Management:Journal of Sustainable Business and Management Solutions in Emerging Economies. 10.7595/management.fon.2018.0004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kashyap, Heena. (2016). Risk Analysis and Estimation of Schedule Using Monte Carlo Simulation. International Journal Of Engineering And Computer Science. 10.18535/ijecs/v5i9.42&lt;/ref&gt; Probabilities and impacts of risks assigned to activities are used as input data for Monte Carlo simulation of the project schedule.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, T. "Why Monte Carlo simulations of project networks can mislead". Project Management Journal, Vol 35. Issue 3, (2004): 53-61&lt;/ref&gt; In most projects it is necessary to supplement the event based variance with uncertainties as distributions related to duration, start time, cost, and other parameters.

In Event chain methodology, risk can not only affect schedule and cost, but also other parameters such as safety, security, performance, technology, quality, and other objectives. In other words one event can belong to different categories.&lt;ref&gt;Agarwal, Ruchi. and Virine, Lev. (2017). Monte Carlo Project Risk Analysis. In Raydugin, Y. (ed) Handbook of Research on Leveraging Risk and Uncertainties for Effective Project Management. IGI Global; 1 edition&lt;/ref&gt; The result of the analysis would show risk exposure for different categories as well as integrated project risk score for all categories. This integrated project risk score is calculated based on relative weights for each risk category.

===Critical event chains===
Monte Carlo simulation provides the capability, through sensitivity analysis, to identify single or chains of events. These chains of events can be identified by analyzing the correlations between the main project parameters, such as project duration or cost, and the event chains. These  are called “critical events” or “critical chains of events”. By identifying critical events or critical chains of events, we can identify strategies to minimize their negative effects: Avoid, Transfer, Mitigate, or Accept. Event and event chain ranking is performed for all risk categories (schedule-related and non-schedule) as part of one process. Integrated risk probability, impact and score can be calculated using weights for each risk category.

===Project control with event and event chains===
Monitoring the activity's progress ensures that updated information is used to perform the analysis. During the course of the project, the probability and time of the events can be recalculated based on actual data. The main reason for  performance tracking is forecasting an activity’s duration and cost if an activity is partially completed and certain events are assigned to the activity. Event chain methodology reduces the risk probability and impact automatically based on the percent of work completed. Advanced analysis can be performed using a Bayesian approach. It is possible to monitor the chance that a project will meet a specific deadline. This chance is constantly updated as a result of the Monte Carlo analysis. Critical events and event chains can be different at the various phases of the project

==Phenomena==

===Repeated activities===
[[File:RepeatedActivity.jpg|thumb|320px|right|Repeated Activity]]Sometimes events can cause the start of an activity that has already been completed. This is a very common scenario for real life projects; sometimes a previous activity must be repeated based on the results of a succeeding activity. Event chain methodology simplifies modeling of these scenarios The original project schedule does not need to be updated, all that is required is to define the event and assign it to an activity that points to the previous activity. In addition, a limit to the number of times an activity can be repeated must be defined.

===Event chains and risk response===
[[File:MitigationPlan.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Mitigation plan]]If an event or event chain occurs during the course of a project, it may require some risk response effort. 
Risk response plans execution are triggered by events, which occur if an activity is in an excited state. Risk response events may attempt to transform the activity from the excited state to the ground state. Response plans are an activity or group of activities (small schedule) that augment the project schedule if a certain event occurs. The solution is to assign the response plan to an event or event chain. The same response plan can be used for one or more events.

===Resource allocation based on events===
One potential event is the reassignment of a resource from one activity to another, which can occur under certain conditions. For example, if an activity requires more resources to complete it within a fixed period, this will trigger an event to reallocate the resource from another activity. Reallocation 
of resources can also occur when activity duration reaches a certain deadline or the cost exceeds a certain value. Events can be used to model different situations with resources, e.g. temporary leave, illness, vacations, etc.

{{other uses|Expiration date (disambiguation)}}
An '''expiration date''' or '''expiry date''' is a previously determined date after which something should no longer be used, either by [[operation of law]] or by exceeding the anticipated [[shelf life]] for perishable goods. Expiration dates are applied to selected food products and to some other manufactured products like infant car seats where the age of the product may impact its safe use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://beta.theglobeandmail.com/globe-drive/culture/commuting/have-you-checked-the-expiration-date-on-your-childs-car-seat/article580971/|title=Have you checked the expiration date on your child's car seat? - The Globe and Mail|date=20 April 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arbitrary expiration dates are also commonly applied by companies to product [[coupons]], promotional offers and [[credit cards]]. In these contexts, the expiration date is chosen for business reasons or to provide some security function rather than any product safety concern. 

Expiration date is often abbreviated EXP or ED.  The legal definition and usage of the term expiration date will vary between countries and products.

===Best before===
[[File:Expiration Tag.jpg|thumb|A [[Bread clip|tag]] sealing a bag of [[hot dog bun]]s displays a ''best before'' date of February 29.]]
''Best before'' or ''best by'' dates appear on a wide range of frozen, dried, tinned and other foods. These dates are only advisory and refer to the quality of the product, in contrast with ''use by'' dates, which indicate that the product may no longer be safe to consume after the specified date.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060421171954/http://www.eatwell.gov.uk/foodlabels/labellingterms/bestbefore/ Food Standards Agency - Eat well, be well - Best before&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Food kept after the ''best before'' date will not necessarily be harmful, but may begin to lose its optimum flavour and texture. Eggs are a special case, since they may contain [[salmonella]] which multiplies over time; they should therefore be eaten before the ''best before'' date, which is, in the USA, a maximum of 45 days after the eggs are packed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shell Eggs from Farm to Table|url=http://www.fsis.usda.gov/fact_sheets/Focus_On_Shell_Eggs/index.asp#18|work=Food Safety and Inspection Service|publisher=[[United States Department of Agriculture]]|accessdate=2012-09-08|date=2011-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes the packaging process involves using pre-printed labels, making it impractical to write the ''best before'' date in a clearly visible location. In this case, wording like ''best before see bottom'' or ''best before see lid'' might be printed on the label and the date marked in a different location as indicated.

===Use by===

Generally, foods that have a ''use by'' date written on the packaging must not be eaten after the specified date. This is because such foods usually go bad quickly and may be injurious to health if spoiled. It is also important to follow storage instructions carefully for these foods (for example, if they specify that the product must be [[refrigeration|refrigerated]]).

Bathroom products and toiletries usually state a time in months from the date the product is opened, by which they should be used. This is often indicated by a [[Period-after-opening symbol|graphic of an open tub]], with the number of months written inside (e.g., "12M" means use the product within 12 months of opening).&lt;ref name=orus1&gt;{{cite journal|last=Orus|first=Pilar|author2=Sonia Leranoz |title=Current trends in cosmetic microbiology|journal=International Microbiology|date=June 2005|volume=8|issue=2|url=http://scielo.isciii.es/scielo.php?pid=S1139-67092005000200001&amp;script=sci_arttext&amp;tlng=en|accessdate=6 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, some food products say "eat within X days of opening".

===Open dating===
''Open dating'' is the use of a date stamped on the package of a food product to help determine how long to display the product for sale. This benefits the consumer by ensuring that the product is of best quality when sold. An open date does not supersede a [[Shelf life#Use by|use-by date]], if shown, which should still be followed.&lt;ref name="USDA-FAQ"&gt;{{cite web|title=Food_Product_Dating|url=http://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/food-safety-education/get-answers/food-safety-fact-sheets/food-labeling/food-product-dating/food-product-dating|accessdate=2015-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sell by / display until===
These dates are intended to help keep track of the stock in stores. Food that has passed its ''sell by'' or ''display until'' date, but has not yet reached its use by / best before date will still be edible, assuming it has been stored correctly. It is common practice in large stores to throw away such food, as it makes the stock control process easier; another common practice is for wholesalers to repurchase the expired product and resell it to [[discount store]]s at much lower [[closeout (sale)|clearance sale]] prices. These practices reduce the risk of customers unknowingly buying food without looking at the date, only to find out the next day that they cannot use it. Tampering with the posted date is illegal in many countries.

Most stores will [[stock rotation|rotate stock]] by moving the products with the earliest dates to the front of shelving units, which encourages customers to buy them first and hopefully saves them from having to be either marked down or thrown away, both of which would result in financial loss.

==Canada==
An expiration date on '''food''' differs from a best-before date. According to the [[Canadian Food Inspection Agency]] "Expiration dates are required only on certain foods that have strict compositional and nutritional specifications which might not be met after the expiration date."

In Canada expiration dates must be used on the following food items (list and comments copied from
CFIA website):

*formulated liquid diets (nutritionally complete diets for people using oral or tube feeding methods)
*foods represented for use in a very low-energy diet (foods sold only by a pharmacist and only with a written order from a physician)
*meal replacements (formulated food that, by itself, can replace one or more daily meals)
*nutritional supplements (food sold or represented as a supplement to a diet that may be inadequate in energy and essential nutrients)
*human milk substitutes (infant formula)

The concern is that after the expiration date has passed, the food may not have the same nutrient content as specified on the packaging and for the listed regulated products, the nutritional content is quite important. The CFIA recommends that food should be discarded and should not be bought, sold or eaten beyond the stated expiration date.  This contrasts with a best before date which is an indication of how long properly stored prepackaged food is expected to retain its "freshness, taste, nutritional value, or any other qualities claimed by the manufacturer." Passing a best before date is not necessarily a reason to discard the food. "Sell by" and "manufactured on" dates are related concepts that may guide the consumer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inspection.gc.ca/food/information-for-consumers/fact-sheets-and-infographics/date-labelling/eng/1332357469487/1332357545633|title=Date Labelling on Pre-packaged Foods|publisher=Government of Canada, Canadian Food Inspection Agency, Public Affairs|website=www.inspection.gc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Non-food items''' may also carry an expiration date. For example, in Canada, all children are required to be secured in an [[infant car seat]] while in a motor vehicle that is in motion. Users are required by law to follow manufacturer's directions. There is no specific law that requires an expiration date, but all [[Transport Canada]] approved car seats sold in Canada carry a manufacturer applied expiration date that ranges between 6 and 9 years from date of manufacture. The rational is that car seats are subjected to heat, cold, sun exposure, abuse by the children, and long term storage between children, all of which can degrade the structure and function of the car seat and cause a failure during a crash event. Further, beyond the expiration date the manufacturer will no longer be monitoring the safety of the seat through testing. Transport Canada advises to destroy an expired car seat and dispose of it at a landfill or recycling facility. Never give an expired seat to someone else or to charity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://beta.theglobeandmail.com/globe-drive/culture/commuting/have-you-checked-the-expiration-date-on-your-childs-car-seat/article580971/?|title=Have you checked the expiration date on your child's car seat?|date=20 April 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vicarseattechs.com/2013/why-do-car-seats-expire/|title=Why Do Car Seats Expire? And How Long is Mine Good For?|publisher=The Globe and Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
The [[Food and Drug Administration]] in the United States notes that "[a] principle of U.S. food law is that foods in U.S. commerce must be wholesome and fit for consumption".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/aboutfda/transparency/basics/ucm210073.htm|title=FDA Basics - Did you know that a store can sell food past the expiration date?|publisher=Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition|website=www.fda.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the agency also states:

{{quote|With the exception of infant formula, the laws that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) administers do not preclude the sale of food that is past the expiration date indicated on the label. FDA does not require food firms to place "expired by", "use by" or "best before" dates on food products. This information is entirely at the discretion of the manufacturer.}}

Most expiration dates are used as guidelines based on normal and expected handling and exposure to temperature. Use prior to the expiration date does not guarantee the safety of a food or drug, and a product is not necessarily dangerous or ineffective after the expiration date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Flynn|first1=Dan|title=Letter From the Editor: When Does Food Expire?|url=http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2015/03/letter-from-the-editor-when-does-food-expire/#.WS3L5cm1sUE|website=Food Safety News|publisher=Marler Clark|accessdate=30 May 2017|date=25 Mar 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[United States Department of Agriculture]], "canned foods are safe indefinitely as long as they are not exposed to freezing temperatures, or temperatures above 90 °F (32.2° C). If the cans look okay, they are safe to use. Discard cans that are dented, rusted, or swollen. High-acid canned foods (tomatoes, fruits) will keep their best quality for 12 to 18 months; low-acid canned foods (meats, vegetables) for 2 to 5 years". {{convert|80|F}}.&lt;ref name="USDA-FAQ"&gt;{{cite web|title=Food_Product_Dating|url=http://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/food-safety-education/get-answers/food-safety-fact-sheets/food-labeling/food-product-dating/food-product-dating|accessdate=2015-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Sell by date" is a less ambiguous term for what is often referred to as an "expiration date". Most food is still edible after the expiration date.&lt;ref name=CA-EXP&gt;''See'' {{cite web |url=http://www.consumeraffairs.com/nutrition/expiration_dates.htm |title=Expiration dates |publisher=Consumer Affairs |accessdate=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A product that has passed its shelf life might still be safe, but quality is no longer guaranteed. In most food stores, waste is minimized by using [[stock rotation]], which involves moving products with the earliest sell by date from the warehouse to the sales area, and then to the front of the shelf, so that most shoppers will pick them up first and thus they are likely to be sold before the end of their shelf life. This is important, as consumers enjoy fresher goods, and furthermore some stores can be fined for selling out of date products; most if not all would have to mark such products down as [[Food waste|wasted]], resulting in a financial loss.

The expiration date of pharmaceuticals specifies the date the manufacturer guarantees the full potency and safety of a drug. Most medications continue to be effective and safe for a time after the expiration date. A rare exception is a case of renal tubular acidosis purportedly caused by expired [[tetracycline]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 1395800 | pmid=15266231 | volume=6 | title=Recycling expensive medication: why not? | journal=MedGenMed | pages=4 | last1 = Pomerantz | first1 = JM}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study conducted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration covered over 100 drugs, prescription and over-the-counter. The study showed that about 90% of them were safe and effective as long as 15 years past their expiration dates. Joel Davis, a former FDA expiration-date compliance chief, said that with a handful of exceptions - notably nitroglycerin, insulin and some liquid antibiotics - most expired drugs are probably effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

'''FiraTàrrega''' (also ''Fira de Teatre al Carrer de Tàrrega'') is the international market&lt;ref&gt;JUÁREZ RUBIO, Francisco; RIBALTA, Mike. "Fira de Teatre al Carrer de Tàrrega. A performing arts market" Pages 153 - 170, into ''Facets of contemporary event management. Theory &amp; practice for event success.'' International University of Applied Sciences Bad Honnef. Bonn: 2008. {{ISBN|978-3-86796-027-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; for performing arts that takes place every year in [[Tàrrega]] during the second weekend in September. Founded in 1981, it is a great shop window of what is going on in performing arts, with special emphasis on street arts, visual and unconventional shows. As a meeting place and an international point of reference for debate, the main objective of FiraTàrrega is to boost the performing arts market, opening the door to the internationalisation of the companies. Other more specific objectives are the accompaniment and promotion of creations by emergent artists, encouraging training, focused on artistic creation and culture management and on generating strategic alliances to develop transnational street art circuits or productions.

The Fira de Teatre al Carrer de Tàrrega was born in 1981 thanks to the initiative of the then Mayor of Tarrega, Eugeni Nadal, and as the result of a confluence of ideas: that of converting the town's local festival into a grand fiesta; encouraging the people to take part and get involved and put the whole town to the service of a concrete project, in this case, for the theatre. To carry out this project, Nadal had, from the outset, the complicity of Xavier Fàbregas, Head of Servei de Cinematografia i Teatre at the [[Generalitat de Catalunya]] and Joan Font, director of [[Comediants]].

At that precise historic moment, a series of factors contributed to getting this initial project of the ground:

*Politically, the restoration of democratic town councils after the first local elections, promoted the popular festivals and regained the street as a physical space for collective meetings and celebrations.
*In the cultural field, theatre companies and musical groups who reinforced this idea appeared in Catalonia. These include Comediants, founded in 1978, [[Vol Ras]] in 1980, [[La Vella Dixieland]] or [[El Tricicle]]. At the beginning of the 80s [[La Fura dels Baus]], [[La Cubana]], etc., also appeared.
*Geographically, Tàrrega is a town near the important urban centres but far enough away to mean staying there for a greater or lesser time.
*The calendar was also an element to keep in mind when organising la Fira. The fact that it coincided with the end of summer and the last weekend before the schools went back favoured the attendance.
*Finally, the medieval layout of the town allowed the organisers to concentrate the venues in the centre, which centralised the shows and bunched the audience together, making them into protagonists in the event.

{{Campaignbox Ganghwa Island War}}
The '''Ganghwa Island incident''' or the Japanese '''Battle of Ganghwa''' ({{lang-ko|운요호 사건 [雲揚號事件]}} ''Unyo-ho sageon'' meaning "''[[Japanese gunboat Un'yō|Un'yō]]'' incident"; {{lang-ja|[[:ja:江華島|江華島]]{{linktext|事件}}}} ''Kōkatō jiken''), was a purposely armed clash between the [[Joseon dynasty|Joseon dynasty of Korea]] and Japan which occurred in the vicinity of [[Ganghwa Island]] on September 20, 1875. It was a form of [[gunboat diplomacy]] and this incident  occurred intentionally for the purpose of opening [[Korea]].{{sfn|Duus|1998|p=43}}

==Background==
In the second half of the 19th century, the Korean peninsula was the scene of a power struggle between several imperial powers including the [[Russian Empire|Russians]] and the [[French colonial empire|French]], as well as the Chinese and the Japanese.

The [[Meiji Restoration]] of 1868 ended the 265-year-old feudalistic [[Tokugawa shogunate]] in [[Japan]]. The new government of [[Japan]] sent a messenger holding a letter with the sovereign's message which informed of the founding of a new administration of [[Japan]] to the government of Korea [[Joseon]] dynasty on December 19, 1868.

However, the Koreans refused to receive the letter because it contained the [[Chinese characters]] '''[[wiktionary:皇|皇]]''' ("royal, imperial") and '''[[wiktionary:勅|勅]]''' ("imperial decree").{{sfn|Duus|1998|p=31}} According to the political system of the day, only the [[Chinese emperor]] was allowed to use these characters, as they signified the imperial authority of [[China]].{{sfn|Duus|1998|p=31}} Hence, their use by a Japanese sovereign was considered unacceptable to the Koreans, as it implied he was an equal of the emperor of [[Qing dynasty|China]].{{sfn|Duus|1998|p=31}}

The Chinese suggested to the Koreans to receive the sovereign letter from [[Japan]], because [[China]] knew the power of [[Japan]] at that moment.&lt;ref&gt;OH, Bonnie. ''Sino-Japanese Rivalry in Korea''. p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; Despite government-level negotiations held in 1875 at [[Busan|Pusan]], no substantial progress was made. Instead, tension grew as the Koreans continued to refuse to recognize Japan's claims of equality with China and Japanese politicians insisted on the conquest of the Joseon dynasty to solve social problems in Japan.

==Engagement at Ganghwa island==
[[File:UnyoBattle.jpg|thumb|The landing of the forces of the ''[[Japanese gunboat Un'yō|Un'yō]]'' at [[Ganghwa Island]]. Japanese woodblock print.]]
[[Ganghwa Island]],  had been a site of violent confrontations between Korean forces and foreign forces in the previous decade. In 1866, the island was briefly occupied during the [[French Campaign against Korea, 1866|French expedition against Korea]], and in 1871 the site of an [[Sinmiyangyo|American expedition]]. The memories of those confrontations were very fresh, and there was little question that the Korean garrison would shoot at any approaching foreign ship.

On the morning of September 20 1875, the [[Japanese gunboat Un'yō|''Un'yō'']] under the command of [[Inoue Yoshika]] was dispatched to survey Korean coastal waters. While surveying the Western coast of Korea, the Japanese put ashore a party on Ganghwa Island to request water and provisions.{{sfn|Duus|1998|p=43}} When the shore batteries of the Korean forts  fired on the ''Un'yō'', the Japanese response was swift and severe.{{sfn|Duus|1998|p=43}} After bombarding the Korean fortifications, the Japanese landed a shore party that torched several houses on the island and engaged Korean troops. Armed with modern rifles, they made quick work of the Koreans who carried matchlock muskets; consequently, thirty-five Korean soldiers were killed.{{sfn|Duus|1998|p=43}} News of the incident did not reach Tokyo until September 28, but the following day the [[Dajōkan]] decided to dispatch gun boats to Pusan to protect Japanese residents there. It also began deliberating whether or not to send a mission to Korea to settle the incident.{{sfn|Duus|1998|p=43}}

==Aftermath==
The number of casualties of the incident were recorded at 35 of the Joseon Dynasty with two Japanese soldiers wounded. In addition, 16 Korean naval personnel were captured by Japan. Many weapons were also looted. After the incident, the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] blockaded the immediate area and requested an official apology from the Joseon government, which was concluded with the dispatch of the [[Kuroda Kiyotaka|Kuroda]] mission and the signing of the [[Treaty of Ganghwa]] on February 27, 1876, which opened the Korean Peninsula to Japanese and foreign trade.

'''''Good Bye, Lenin!''''' is a 2003 German [[Tragicomedy|tragicomedy film]], directed by [[Wolfgang Becker]]. The cast includes [[Daniel Brühl]], [[Katrin Saß]], [[Chulpan Khamatova]], and [[Maria Simon]]. The story follows a family in [[East Germany]]; the mother (Saß) is dedicated to the socialist cause and falls into a coma shortly before the [[Peaceful Revolution|1989 revolution]]. When she is revived eight months later, her son (Brühl) attempts to protect her from fatal shock by concealing the [[fall of the Berlin Wall]] and the [[collapse of socialism]].

Most scenes were shot at the [[Karl-Marx-Allee]] in Berlin and around [[Plattenbau]]ten near [[Alexanderplatz]]. ''Good Bye, Lenin!'' received numerous honours, including the [[European Film Award for Best Film]] and [[German Film Award for Best Feature Film]].

==Plot==
The film is set in [[East Berlin]], from October 1989 to just after [[German reunification]] a year later.

Alex lives with his sister, Ariane, his mother, Christiane, and Ariane's infant daughter, Paula. Alex's father abandoned the family and fled to [[West Germany|the West]] in 1978; his mother filled the void left by her marriage by joining the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|Socialist Unity Party]] and devoting her time to advocating for citizens and matters of public interest. While Christiane believes in the ability of socialism to improve Germany and the world, her children are more cynical. Alex is disgusted with the drab celebration of East Germany's 40th anniversary and participates in an [[Monday demonstrations in East Germany|anti-government demonstration]]. There he meets a girl, but they are separated by the [[Volkspolizei]] before they can properly introduce themselves.

When Christiane sees Alex being arrested, she suffers a near-fatal heart attack and falls into a coma. While visiting his mother in the hospital, Alex encounters the girl he met in the demonstration, Lara, a nurse from the [[Soviet Union]] who is caring for his mother. Alex and Lara soon begin dating and develop a close bond.

Shortly afterward, [[Erich Honecker]] resigns from office, the [[Berlin Wall]] falls, and capitalism comes to East Berlin. The TV repair shop where Alex works closes, and he gets a job selling and installing satellite dishes for a West German firm. There, he befriends a coworker, Denis Domaschke, who is an aspiring filmmaker. When Ariane's university closes, she works at a [[Burger King]] drive-through; she begins dating the store manager, Rainer, who soon moves into their apartment.

After eight months, Christiane awakens from her coma, but she is severely weakened and her doctor warns that any shock might cause another, possibly fatal, heart attack. Alex realizes that the news of [[Die Wende|recent events]] would be too much for her to bear and decides to maintain the illusion that things are as before in the [[German Democratic Republic]]. To do so, Alex, Ariane, and Lara get the apartment's old East German furniture and decor out of storage, dress in their old clothes, and repackage new Western products in old East German jars. Their deception is successful, though increasingly complicated as Christiane occasionally witnesses strange occurrences, such as a gigantic [[Coca-Cola]] advertisement banner on an adjacent building that she sees through her bedroom window. With Denis' help, Alex edits old tapes of East German [[Aktuelle Kamera|news broadcasts]] and creates fake broadcasts to explain these odd events. Meanwhile, Alex and Ariane's attempts to exchange their mother's life savings, all in [[East German mark]]s, for [[Deutsche Mark|West German marks]] are unsuccessful as the deadline for exchanges passes before they find where Christiane was keeping the money.

Christiane eventually gains strength and wanders outside one day while Alex is asleep. She sees all her neighbors' old furniture piled up in the street, new West German cars for sale in a lot next door, advertisements for Western corporations, and a statue of [[Lenin]] being flown away by a helicopter. Alex and Ariane quickly take her home and show her a fake newscast explaining East Germany is now accepting refugees from the West following a severe [[economic crisis]] there.

Soon after, the family goes to inspect their [[dacha]] in the countryside at Christiane's suggestion. While they are there, Christiane reveals her own secret: Her husband had fled because his refusal to join the ruling party had made his life and job increasingly difficult, and the plan had been for the rest of the family to join him. Christiane, fearing the [[Government of East Germany|government]] would take Alex and Ariane away from her if things went wrong, chose to stay. Contrary to what she told her children, their father wrote many letters to them, which she hid away. As she regrets the decision and declares her wish that she could see her husband one last time to make amends, Christiane relapses and is taken back to the hospital.

Alex meets his father, Robert, who has remarried, has two children with his new wife, and now lives in [[West Berlin]]. He convinces him to see Christiane one last time, stating he should say he was moved to return East to see his dying wife. Under pressure to reveal the truth about the fall of the East, Alex creates a final fake news segment, convincing a taxi driver (who is or resembles the cosmonaut [[Sigmund Jähn]], the first German in space and Alex's childhood hero) to act in the false news report as the new leader of East Germany and to give a speech about opening the borders to the West. However, Christiane already knows the truth (Lara tried to convince her about the real political developments earlier the same day). Nevertheless, she reacts fondly to her son's effort, without mentioning anything.

Christiane dies two days later: She outlives the GDR, passing away three days after full official German reunification. Alex, Ariane, Lara, Denis, and Robert scatter her ashes in the wind using an old toy rocket Alex made with his father during his childhood.

==Soundtrack==
{{Main|Good Bye Lenin! (soundtrack)}}
The [[film score]] was composed by [[Yann Tiersen]], except the version of "Summer 78" sung by [[Claire Pichet]]. Stylistically, the music is very similar to Tiersen's earlier work on the [[Amélie (soundtrack)|soundtrack to ''Amélie'']]. One piano composition, "Comptine d'un autre été : L'après-midi", is used in both films.

Several famous GDR songs are featured. Two children, members of the [[Ernst Thälmann Pioneer Organisation]], sing ''[[Unsere Heimat]]'' (Our Homeland). Friends of Christiane (living in the same building) follow with ''{{lang|de|Bau Auf! Bau Auf!}}'' (Build Up! Build Up!), another anthem of the [[Free German Youth]]. The final fake newscast with Sigmund Jähn features a rousing rendition of the GDR national anthem, ''[[Auferstanden aus Ruinen]]''.

==Reception==
The film received strong positive reviews, holding a rating of 90% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]]. ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' gave the film four stars out of five with a verdict of, "An ingenious little idea that is funny, moving and—gasp!—even makes you think."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/review.asp?DVDID=9862 |title=Empire's Good Bye Lenin!

'''Gotland Game Conference''' ('''GGC'''), originally '''Gotland Game Convention''' and later '''Gotland Game Awards''', is a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[Video game development|game development]] competition for students. The event is held annually and marks the end of the academic year for the students at the Department of Game Design at [[Campus Gotland]], [[Uppsala University]]. Here they can showcase everything that they have learned during the year to a jury consisting of professionals from the game development industry, the gaming press and academia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About GGC|url=http://www.gotlandgameconference.com/2011/info/about-ggc/|website=Gotland Game Conference 2011|accessdate=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable people who have been a part of the jury include [[game design]] guru [[Ernest W. Adams]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Gotland Game Awards!|url=http://news.designersnotebook.com/2008_06_01_archive.html|website=The Designer's Notebook News}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the father of [[MUD]]s [[Richard Bartle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GGA 2008 Jury|url=http://www.gotlandgameawards.se/gga08/?page_id=6|website=Gotland Game Awards 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GGA 2009 Jury|url=http://www.gotlandgameawards.se/gga09/jury|website=Gotland Game Awards 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The Department of Game Design on Gotland, Visby, has hosted a public event for displaying student projects since at least 2002&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://game.speldesign.uu.se/blog/revive-theme-park-2002/|title=Revive / Theme Park 2002|last=Benjaminsson|first=Ulf|date=2002-05-18|website=|access-date=2018-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=260&amp;artikel=425019|title=Utställningen där man ska röra föremålen|last=|first=|date=2004-06-04|website=|publisher=Swedish Radio|access-date=2018-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The event found a stable structure and was branded "'''Gotland Game Awards'''" in 2006&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Edge Magazine (October 2009)|last=|first=|publisher=|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=142-143}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gotland Game Awards in EDGE Magazine!|url=http://www.gotlandgameawards.se/gga09/2009/09/16/gotland-game-awards-in-edge-magazine/|website=Gotland Game Awards 2009|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and re-branded "'''Gotland Game Conference'''" in 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://game.speldesign.uu.se/blog/gotland-game-conference-2011/|title=Gotland Game Conference 2011|last=Benjaminsson|first=Ulf|date=2011-06-02|website=Department of Game Design|access-date=2018-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://game.speldesign.uu.se/blog/what-happened-to-the-gga/|title=What happened to the GGA|last=Benjaminsson|first=Ulf|date=2011-03-25|website=Department of Game Design|access-date=2018-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;, when a presentation track was added and the event opened to public participation. In 2017 the GGC added an international summit for game educators&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gotlandgameconference.com/2017/game-educators-summit/|title=Game Educators Summit (2017)|last=Benjaminsson|first=Ulf|date=2017-02-15|website=Gotland Game Conference|access-date=2018-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; - with the intention of annually gathering game educations from across the world to collaborate and share experiences.  

==The event==

The event can be seen as consisting of four separate parts (spanning over multiple days);

*Public presentation of student projects to an international jury of developers, designers, academics, journalists etc.
*Followed by The Gotland Game Conference + showfloor, where all student games are made available to the jury and general audience. 
**The conference + show floor is roughly [http://game.speldesign.uu.se/blog/gotland-game-conference-2011/ modeled after the Game Developers Conference], but features only a single track of lectures.
*The Award Ceremony
*The GGC Party where students, jury and faculty celebrate their work and end of the school year.

Group-IB's head office is located in [[Moscow, Russia]].

== History ==
[[File:Ilya Sachkov.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Ilya Sachkov]], the founder]]
Group-IB was founded in 2003 by a group of students of [[Bauman Moscow State Technical University]], headed by [[Ilya Konstantinovich Sachkov]]. They were acting as an agency for investigating cyber-attacks. Since then, Group-IB has been involved in a range of incident response and investigations across the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-taiwan-cyber-atms-idUSKBN14P0CX |title=Taiwan ATM heist linked to European hacking spree: security firm |author=Jim Finkle and J.R. Wu |date=January 5, 2017 |website= |publisher=[[Reuters]] |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; actively cooperating with international partners to detect perpetrators and bring them to justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.group-ib.com/index.php/7-novosti/940-group-ib-supports-interpol-in-disrupting-dorkbot-botnet |title=Group-IB supports INTERPOL in disrupting Dorkbot botnet |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=December 17, 2015 |website= |publisher=Group-IB |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Group-IB participated in the first successful [[cybercrime]] case in Russia where the organizers of the criminal groups were identified and arrested. These criminals were involved in financial theft from bank accounts using [[malware]] for PCs, mobile devices, [[phishing]] attacks, and targeted attacks on financial institutions in Russia. The company is generally involved in a series of international operations and leverages close cooperation with international law enforcement agencies to get the criminals wherever they hide. According to Group-IB, up to 80% of all high-profile investigation cases in the field of high-tech crime in Russia are supported by Group-IB experts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.group-ib.com/about.html |title=About Group-IB |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website= |publisher=Group-IB |access-date= |quote="80% of high-profile cybercrimes in Russia and CIS are investigated by Group-IB"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Group-IB established the largest computer [[forensics]] laboratory in [[Eastern Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bankinfosecurity.com/russian-police-bust-alleged-bank-malware-gang-a-9163 |title=Russian Police Bust Alleged Bank Malware Gang |last=Schwartz |first=Mathew J. |date=June 2, 2016 |website=bankinfosecurity.com |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 the company established its [[Computer Emergency Response Team]] (CERT)—the first round-the-clock computer security incident response team in Eastern Europe, called CERT-GIB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2032336/researchers-find-new-pointofsale-malware-called-blackpos.html |title=Researchers find new point-of-sale malware called BlackPOS |last=Lucian |first=Constantin |date=March 28, 2013 |website=pcworld.com |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the status of a Competent Security Organization recognized by [[Coordination Center for TLD RU]] (administrator of the national top-level domains [[.ru]] and [[.рф]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://cctld.ru/en/news/news_detail.php?ID=3366&amp;sphrase_id=138576 |title=Group-IB to help combating cibercrime in domains .РФ and .RU |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2011-12-23 |website= |publisher=[[Coordination Center for TLD RU]] |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and collaboration with CERTs worldwide, the company has developed a series of effective [[intellectual property]] protection services.

Group-IB successfully protected the [[2014 Winter Olympics|Sochi 2014 Olympic]] brand, products and ticket sales,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.group-ib.ru/testimonials/sochi.pdf |title=Sochi 2014 Commemorative certificate |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2014 |website= |publisher=[[International Olympic Committee]] |access-date= |quote= |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; blocked pirated links to TV series and movies owned by [[Sony Pictures]], [[Paramount Pictures]], [[Fox TV]] series', [[Discovery Channel]], Amedia (which has exclusive rights to HBO TV series in Russia),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.group-ib.com/index.php/7-novosti/828-internet-criminalists-how-russias-main-cyber-detective-agency-is-organized |title=Internet criminalists: how Russia’s main cyber detective agency is organized |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website= |publisher=Group-IB |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as fraudulent websites abusing brands of popular banks and payment systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnews.ru/news/line/qiwi_i_groupib_obedinili_usiliya_dlya |title=Qiwi и Group-IB объединили усилия для защиты электронных платежей |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2014-04-10 |website=cnews.ru |publisher= |access-date= |quote= |language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2012, Group-IВ has been developing their Early Warning System to provide cyber defence to companies around the world. In 2015 [[Gartner]] included Group-IB's core product—Group-IB Intelligence—in the top 7 global threat intelligence solutions along with products developed by [[IBM]], [[FireEye]], [[RSA Security|RSA]] and [[Check Point]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gartner.com/doc/2874317/market-guide-security-threat-intelligence |title=Market Guide for Security Threat Intelligence Services |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=14 October 2014 |website= |publisher=[[Gartner]] |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2007, Group-IB has been cooperating with [[Microsoft]]. In 2015, the two companies presented joint research on the economic impact of cyber-attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rbth.com/business/2016/04/14/russia-loses-33-billion-to-cyber-attacks_584971 |title=Russia loses $3.3 billion to cyber attacks |last=Kuchma |first=Anna |date=April 14, 2016 |website= |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Group-IB is a resident of the Moscow-based [[Skolkovo Foundation]] (dubbed "Russian [[Silicon Valley]]"). As part of Skolkovo innovative projects, Group-IB created the so-called "CyberCop", a global counter-cybercrime system.

The company has also established an additional office in [[Innopolis]]—a [[science park]] in [[Tatarstan]], Russia.

== Technology ==
According to Gartner, "being involved in the most high-profile investigations allows Group-IB to get more information about cybercriminals, their relationships and other intelligence".&lt;ref name="Gartner" /&gt; In addition to investigation materials and forensics expertise, GIB's threat data collection is based on the high-tech infrastructure that includes:
* compromised data tracking and data extraction from [[botnet]]s; automatic search and monitoring of "underground" forums;
* vast databases of known cyber criminals and gangs that identify intersections and analyzes [[social graphs]];
* identification of new threats using behavioral analysis and machine learning technology;
* detection of infections, attempts of remote control and other indications of fraud schemes targeting clients of [[online banking]] and Internet portals without installation on client devices;
* detection of [[phishing]] resources and rogue mobile applications and extraction of their phishing kits—modules designed to store and transmit stolen data.

=== Early Warning System for Cyber Defence ===

GIB Intelligence service uses personalized information for security strategy planning, making time-sensitive decisions and tweaking protection tools. It gives time for incidents prevention allowing to urgently discover theft of clients and employees' identifiers, to track modifications of tactics and tools used by criminal groups potentially interested in a company and to prioritize threats based on expert [[Forecasting|forecast]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ixbt.com/news/soft/index.shtml?18/34/85 |title=Российские киберпреступники получили в 2013 г. почти $2,5 млрд |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2014-10-15 |website= |publisher=[[Vedomosti]] |access-date= |quote= |language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TDS is a hardware and software unit preventing infection and vulnerabilities usage in corporate networks. The TDS sensors track suspicious activities in a corporate network while the CERT-GIB experts reveal critical threats and immediately inform the information security service and help to put a stop to an incident evolving. TDS Polygon allows to start in an isolated environ suspicious [[Computer file|file]]s downloaded by users or received in mail and to obtain an objective conclusion of the degree of their harmfulness based on a classification formed through computerized training pattern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.anti-malware.ru/analytics/Market_Analysis/protection-market-against-targeted-attacks-review |title=Обзор рынка защиты от целевых атак |author=Иван Бойцов |date=2016-10-26 |website=anti-malware.ru |publisher= |access-date= |quote= |language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Major threats detected by Group-IB ==

=== Lazarus: state-sponsored attack ===
In May 2017 Group-IB issued a report that proved there is a connection between Lazarus group who stole $18 mln from [[Bangladesh Bank|Bangladesh Central Bank]], conducted a number of attacks on Polish banks, as well as attempted to infect hundreds of financial organizations in 30 countries around the globe, including European Central Bank, Central Banks of Russia, Brazil and Venezuela – with North Korea. Company experts made a research of the complex technological infrastructure, communications channels, and concealment techniques, presented new evidence of Lazarus attribution to North Korea and revealed details of the attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/05/30/nork_spy_agency_lazarus_group_attribution/ |title=NORK spy agency blamed for Bangladesh cyberheist, Sony Pictures hack |last=Leyden |first=John |date=30 May 2017 |website= |publisher=[[The Register]] |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cobalt: logical attacks===
In July 2016, a group of masked cyber-criminals "jackpotted" 34 ATMs operated by First Bank, one of Taiwan's largest banks. The perpetrators stole T$83.27 (over $2m USD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/thai-bank-shuts-down-half-its-atms-after-eastern-european-cyber-gang-heist-1577806 |title=Thai bank shuts down half its ATMs after 'Eastern European cyber-gang' heist |last=Murdock |first=Jason |date=August 24, 2016 |website= |publisher=[[International Business Times]] |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Surveillance footage|CCTV footage]], the thieves used cellphones to trigger the ATMs to automatically dispense money. Group-IB experts were the first to discover the "jackpotting" attack tactics used by the Cobalt gang to force ATMs to spit out cash using malware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cyber-banks-atms-idUSKBN13G24Q?il=0 |title=Hackers target ATMs across Europe as cyber threat grows |last=Finkle |first=Jim |date=2016-11-21 |website= |publisher=[[Reuters]] |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Group-IB released a report "Cobalt: Logical attacks on ATMs" that provided a detailed analysis of the attack scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.group-ib.com/cobalt.html |title=Cobalt: logical attacks on ATMs |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2016 |website= |publisher=Group-IB |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; To get into the bank's internal network, hackers used spear phishing emails with a malicious attachment. The emails purported to come from the European Central Bank, the ATM maker [[Wincor Nixdorf]], and local banks. After establishing control over the bank's internal network, the criminals searched for network segments, from which they could gain access to ATMs and workstations of bank employees who control ATMs. Once access to ATMs was obtained, they uploaded a specific software to them, allowing criminals to control cash dispensers.

===Corkow===
In February 2016, Group-IB published a report titled "Analysis of attacks against trading and bank card systems" about the first major successful attack on a trading system provoking major exchange volatility. In February 2015, the Corkow criminal group infected a trading system terminal of [[Kazan]]-based Energobank using a specialized [[Trojan software]] resulting in trades of more than $400 million. The hackers moved the ruble-dollar rate more than 15 percent in minutes on the [[Moscow Exchange]]. The bank claimed losses of 244 million rubles ($3.2 million) due to the trades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-02-08/russian-hackers-moved-currency-rate-with-malware-group-ib-says |title=Russian Hackers Moved Ruble Rate With Malware, Group-IB Says |last= |first= |date=2016-02-08 |website= |publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buhtrap===
In March 2016 Group-IB published a report on activity of the Buhtrap criminal group that managed to conduct 13 successful attacks against Russian banks for a total amount of 1.8 billion rubles ($25.7 million) from August 2015 to February 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.vedomosti.ru/finance/articles/2016/03/18/634123-hakeri-rossiiskih-bankov |title=Хакеры украли $25 млн у 13 российских банков |last=Kantyshev |first=Pavel |date=2016-03-18 |website= |publisher=[[Vedomosti]] |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The high effectiveness of these attacks was achieved due to spear phishing mailouts, including those sent acting as the [[Central Bank of Russia]], which were used by criminals to gain access to the corporate network. Criminals obtained access to computers running the Automated Working Station of the Central Bank Client (AWS CBC), a free software that delivers payment documents on behalf of the Central Bank, and performed fraudulent transactions acting as the bank. The attack scheme outlined in the report published by Group-IB was later used to perform thefts via SWIFT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-03-17/new-russian-hacker-cell-hit-13-banks-since-august-group-ib-says |title=New Russian Hacker Cell Hit 13 Banks Since August, Group-IB Says |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2016-03-17 |website= |publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buhtrap was the first hacker group using a network worm to infect the overall bank infrastructure that significantly increased the difficulty of removing all malicious functions from the network. As a result, banks had to shut down the whole infrastructure, because the worm was able to gain full control over the network using a single infected machine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.group-ib.com/buhtrap-report.html |title=Buhtrap: the evolution of targeted attacks against financial institutions |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2016 |website= |publisher=Group-IB |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anunak/Carbanak===
In late 2014 Fox-IT and Group-IB jointly released a report on the Anunak (aka Carbanak) hacker group that had stolen more than 1 billion rubles from over 50 Russian banks. In Europe Anunak attacked [[Point of sale|POS terminals]] of large retail store chains with data of several million clients infected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.forbes.ru/tekhnologii/internet-i-svyaz/276227-brat-po-krupnomu-kak-odna-gruppirovka-khakerov-ograbila-bolee-50 |title=Брать по-крупному: группировка хакеров ограбила более 50 банков |author=Pavel Sedakov, Dmitry Filonov |date=2014-12-22 |website= |publisher=[[Forbes]] |access-date= |quote= |language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group has not performed successful thefts since early 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.group-ib.com/index.php/7-novosti/939-high-tech-crime-trends-2015 |title=High-Tech Crime Trends 2015 |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website= |publisher=Group-IB |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reverse ATM Attack===
In autumn 2015,  a novel technique of targeted attacks called a "reverse ATM attack" that allowed criminals to steal money from ATMs. "[[Money mule]]s" (criminal payment agents) would deposit small sums into unembossed cards with legitimate accounts, immediately withdrawing what they'd put in. They also took a receipt from the ATM, which contained a payment reference number and the amount withdrawn. That information was sent to hackers who would use the data and their access to thousands of point of sale terminals, primarily based in the USA and the Czech Republic, to create "a reversal operation" on a terminal that tricked the bank into believing the withdrawal of funds had been cancelled. At the point of sale terminal, this looked as though goods were returned or a payment was declined, whilst to the banks it appeared the ATM withdrawal had been cancelled. Funds were returned to the account, though the perpetrators had already taken the cash. The process was repeated until there was no money remaining in the target ATM. During these attacks criminals managed to steal 252 million rubles ($3.8 million) from five large Russian banks. The fraud can no longer be perpetrated due to additional security systems implemented by banks with the assistance from VISA and Mastercard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/42272/cyber-crime/reverse-atm-hack-method.html |title=Russian criminals Steal $4 Million In cash with a new technique dubbed reverse ATM Attack. |last=Paganini |first=Paganini |date=November 26, 2015 |website=securityaffairs.co |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===ISIS  hacker attacks on Russian resources===
According to the report released by Group-IB in March 2015, hackers from the self-proclaimed [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIS) attacked 600 Russian Internet resources in 2014. Criminals primarily [[Website defacement|defaced]] websites placing pictures and video with ISIS propaganda. Hackers are believed to have attacked not only government organizations, banks and popular resources, but also galleries and schools. These attacks were chaotic and massive; researchers believe that they were aimed to gain experience and perform reconnaissance of the [[Internet in Russia|Russian Internet]]. According to Group-IB's report, these attacks were performed not just by ISIS cyber division, [[Islamic State Hacking Division|Cyber Caliphate]], but by 3 more criminal groups called Team System Dz, FallaGa Team and Global Islamic Caliphate totalling over 40 members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/237031-isis-hackers-have-hit-hundreds-of-russian-websites |title=ISIS hackers have hit hundreds of Russian websites |last=Bennett |first=Cory |date= |website= |publisher=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]] |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notable public investigations ==

===Exploits: Blackhole (Paunch)===
In Autumn 2013 Group-IB supported investigative activity that resulted in the arrest of Dmitry Fedotov, known under the nickname Paunch, the author of the infamous [[Blackhole exploit kit|Blackhole exploit pack]], which was, at the time, used to conduct 40% of infections worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/12/who-is-paunch/ |title=Who Is Paunch? |last= |first= |date=December 2013 |website=krebsonsecurity.com |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The criminal was sentenced to 7 years in prison according to the national legislation in April 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/blackholes-paunch-sentenced-to-7/ |title=Blackhole's Paunch Sentenced to 7 Years in Russian Penal Colony |last=Seals |first=Tara |date=2016-04-19 |website=infosecurity-magazine.com |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attacks on legal entities: Carberp, Germes, Hodprot===
In 2012 law enforcement agencies, with assistance from Sberbank and Group-IB, arrested the largest criminal gang in Russia. In two years, the group managed to infect over 1.5 million computers worldwide and steal approximately $250 million from bank accounts. In total, over 100 banks suffered from their attacks throughout the world. Group-IB engaged their partners in the Netherlands and Canada in the investigation, which enabled the company to identify the full chain of actors including the organizer, who owned the [[botnet]], operators, and cashers ("[[money mule]]s").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.group-ib.com/index.php/7-novosti/627-members-of-the-largest-criminal-group-engaged-in-online-banking-fraud-are-detained |title=Members of the largest criminal group engaged in online banking fraud are detained |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website= |publisher=Group-IB |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first case in Russia when all members of the criminal group were arrested; the leaders were sentenced to between 5 and 8 years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.securityweek.com/russian-authorities-claim-capture-mastermind-behind-carberp-banking-trojan |title=Russian Authorities Claim Capture of Mastermind Behind Carberp Banking Trojan |author=Fahmida Y. Rashid |date=April 4, 2013 |website=securityweek.com |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year members of other criminal groups, who used Carberp modifications to attack individuals and companies, were arrested. In the summer of 2012 a hacker known as Germes (aka Arashi) was arrested. He was a creator of one of the largest global botnets that had infected over 6 million computers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cso.com.au/article/428671/russian_carberp_botnet_kingpin_arrested_/ |title=Russian Carberp botnet kingpin arrested |author=Liam Tung |date=June 26, 2012 |website=cso.com.au |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this, 7 members of the Hodprot criminal group were detained. One of the oldest Russian hacker gangs is known to have stolen approximately 125 million rubles from Russian bank accounts. All members of the criminal group were arrested, even though they are known to have used control servers located abroad – in the Netherlands, Germany, France and the USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.welivesecurity.com/2012/06/04/carberp-and-hodprot-six-more-gang-members-held/ |title=Carberp and Hodprot: six more gang members held |last=Harley |first=David |date=2012-06-04 |website=welivesecurity.com |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Android Trojans: "5th Reich", WapLook, Cron===
In April 2015 members of a hacker group, which had infected over 340,000 Android-based devices to steal money from bank accounts, were arrested with assistance of Group-IB and Sberbank. Hackers dubbed their malware "the fifth [[Reich]]" and used Nazi symbols in the control system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ren.tv/novosti/2015-04-13/kiber-fashisty-iz-chelyabinskoy-oblasti-ispolzovali-virus-5-reyh |title=Кибер-фашисты из Челябинской области использовали вирус "5 рейх" |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2015-04-13 |website= |publisher=[[REN TV]] |access-date= |quote= |language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hackers distributed the malware via SMS messages containing a link to download a program masked as [[Adobe Flash Player]]. The Trojan enabled hackers to intercept SMS notifications from banks and furtively confirm money transfer to hackers' accounts. The attack scheme was similar to that used by WapLook, the first criminal group members which were arrested for money theft from individuals using malicious mobile apps in Russia. Group leaders were arrested in September 2014 with assistance from Group-IB. In May 2017 Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs announced the arrest of Cron gang that had infected more than 1 mln smartphones. Group-IB provided expert support to the investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-cyber-banks-idUSKBN18I0VE |title=Hackers hit Russian bank customers, planned international cyber raids |last=Stubbs |first=Jack |date=2017-05-22 |website= |publisher=[[Reuters]] |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cron Banking Trojan spread itself in two ways—via SMS, when the user clicked on the link in the message and installed a malicious application, or disguised as a legitimate application Navitel, Framaroot, Pornhub, Avito etc. The hackers infected up to 3,500 smartphones daily, and managed to steal about $1 mln in total.

===Phishing: Popelysh brothers===
In June 2015, twin brother hackers were reportedly arrested in [[St. Petersburg, Russia]], as part of a police operation assisted by Group-IB. Over 4 years, the Popelysh brothers had stolen money from client accounts of [[VTB Bank|VTB24]] online banking using a fake bank page to grab client data. This was the first case in Russia, when legal proceedings were taken against criminals using phishing schemes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28956">There is no commonly agreed single definition of “[[cybercrime]]”. It refers to illegal [[internet]]-mediated activities that often take place in global electronic networks.&lt;ref name="Weiping Chang"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/1h8030xypwgu9y5r/|title=An International Perspective on Fighting Cybercrime | doi=10.1007/3-540-44853-5_34 | journal=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|pages=379–384}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cybercrime is "international" or "transnational" – there are ‘no cyber-borders between countries'.&lt;ref name="Fortinet"&gt;[http://whitepapers.hackerjournals.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/FIGHTING-CYBERCRIME.pdf Guillaume Lovet Fortinet, Fighting Cybercrime: Technical, Juridical and Ethical Challenges，VIRUS BULLETIN CONFERENCE，2009]&lt;/ref&gt; '''International cybercrimes '''often challenge the effectiveness of domestic and international law and law enforcement. Because existing laws in many countries are not tailored to deal with cybercrime, criminals increasingly conduct crimes on the Internet in order to take advantages of the less severe punishments or difficulties of being traced. No matter, in developing or developed countries, governments and industries have gradually realized the colossal threats of cybercrime on economic and political security and public interests. However, complexity in types and forms of cybercrime increases the difficulty to fight back. In this sense, fighting cybercrime calls for international cooperation. Various organizations and governments have already made joint efforts in establishing global standards of legislation and law enforcement both on a regional and on an international scale. [[China–United States relations|China–United States cooperation]] is one of the most striking progress recently, because they are the top two source countries of cybercrime.

Information and communication technology (ICT) plays an important role in helping ensure interoperability and security based on global standards. General countermeasures have been adopted in cracking down cybercrime, such as legal measures in perfecting legislation and technical measures in tracking down crimes over the network, Internet [[content control]], using public or private [[proxy server|proxy]] and [[computer forensics]], [[encryption]] and plausible deniability, etc.&lt;ref name="Fortinet"/&gt; Due to the heterogeneity of law enforcement and technical countermeasures of different countries, this article will mainly focus on legislative and regulatory initiatives of international cooperation.

==Typology==
In terms of cybercrime, we may often associate it with various forms of Internet attacks, such as [[hacker (computer security)|hacking]], [[Trojan horse (computing)|Trojans]], [[malware]] ([[keyloggers]]), [[botnet]], Denial-of-Service ([[DoS]]), [[E-mail spoofing|spoofing]], [[phishing]], and [[vishing]]. Though cybercrime encompasses a broad range of illegal activities, it can be generally divided into five categories:

===Intrusive Offences ===

'''Illegal Access''':  “[[Hacker (computer security)|Hacking]]” is one of the major forms of offences that refers to unlawful access to a computer system.

'''Data Espionage''': Offenders can intercept communications between users (such as e-mails) by targeting communication infrastructure such as fixed lines or wireless, and any Internet service (e.g., e-mail servers, chat or [[VoIP]] communications).

'''Data Interference''': Offenders can violate the integrity of data and interfere with them by deleting, suppressing, or altering data and restricting access to them.

===Content-related offences===

'''Pornographic Material''' ('''Child-Pornography'''): Sexually related content was among the first content to be commercially distributed over the Internet.

'''[[Racism]], [[Hate Speech]], Glorification of Violence''': Radical groups use mass communication systems such as the Internet to spread propaganda.

'''[[religious offense|Religious Offences]]''': A growing number of websites present material that is in some countries covered by provisions related to religious offences, e.g., anti-religious written statements.

'''[[E-mail spam|Spam]]''': Offenders send out bulk mails by unidentified source and the mail server often contains useless advertisements and pictures.

===Copyright and trademark-related offences===

'''Common copyright offences''': cyber [[copyright infringement]] of software, music or films.

'''Trademark violations''': A well-known aspect of global trade. The most serious offences include [[phishing]] and [[domain name|domain]] or name-related offences, such as [[cybersquatting]].

===Computer-related offences===

'''Fraud''': online auction fraud, [[advance fee fraud]], [[credit card fraud]], [[Internet banking]]

'''[[Forgery]]''': manipulation of digital documents.

'''[[Identity theft]]''': It refers to stealing private information including [[Social Security Number]]s (SSN), passport numbers, Date of birth, addresses, phone numbers, and passwords for non-financial and financial accounts.

===Combination offences===

'''[[Cyberterrorism]]''': The main purposes of it are propaganda, information gathering, preparation of real-world attacks, publication of training material, communication, terrorist financing and attacks against critical infrastructure.

'''[[Cyberwarfare]]''': It describes the use of ICTs in conducting warfare using the Internet.

'''Cyberlaundering''': Conducting crime through the use of virtual currencies, online casinos etc.&lt;ref name="understand"&gt;[http://www.itu.int/ITU-D/cyb/cybersecurity/docs/itu-understanding-cybercrime-guide.pdf Understanding Cybercrime: A Guide for Developing Countries，ITU Telecommunication Development Sector，2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Threats==

Similar to conventional crime, economic benefits, power, revenge, adventure, ideology and lust are the core driving forces of cybercrime. Major threats caused by those motivations can be categorized as following:

Economic security, reputation and social trust are severely challenged by cyber fraud, [[counterfeiting]], [[impersonation]] and concealment of identity, [[extortion]], electronic [[money laundering]], [[copyright infringement]] and [[tax evasion]].

Public interest and national security is threatened by dissemination of offensive material —e.g., pornographic, defamatory or inflammatory/intrusive communication— [[cyber stalking]]/harassment, Child pornography and paedophilia, electronic vandalism/terrorism.

Privacy, domestic and even diplomatic information security are harmed by unauthorized access and misuse of ICT, denial of services, and illegal interception of communication.&lt;ref name="wipul"&gt;Wipul Jayawickrama, Cyber Crime—Threats, Trends and Challenges, Computer Security Week 2008, Info Shield, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Domestic, as well as international security are threatened by cybercrime due to its transnational characteristic. No single country can really handle this big issue on their own. It is imperative for us to collaborate and defend cybercrime on a global scale.

==International trends==
As more and more criminals are aware of potentially large economic gains that can be achieved with cybercrime, they tend to switch from simple adventure and vandalism to more targeted attacks, especially platforms where valuable information highly concentrates, such as computer, mobile devices and the [[Cloud computing|Cloud]]. There are several emerging international trends of cybercrime.

*'''Platform switch''': Cybercrime is switching its battle ground from Windows-system PCs to other platforms, including mobile phones, tablet computers, and [[VoIP]]. Because a significant threshold in vulnerabilities has been reached. PC vendors are building better security into their products by providing faster updates, patches and user alert to potential flaws. Besides, global mobile devices’ penetration—from smart phones to tablet PCs—accessing the Internet by 2013 will surpass 1 billion, creating more opportunities for cybercrime. The massively successful banking Trojan, [[Zeus]] is already being adapted for the mobile platform. [[Smishing]], or SMS phishing, is another method cyber criminals are using to exploit mobile devices, which users download after falling prey to a social engineering ploy, is designed to defeat the SMS-based [[two-factor authentication]] most banks use to confirm online funds transfers by customers. [[VoIP]] systems are being used to support vishing (telephone-based phishing) schemes, which are now growing in popularity.
*'''Social engineering''' scams: It refers to a non-technical kind of intrusion, in the form of e-mails or social networking chats, that relies heavily on human interaction and often involves fooling potential victims into downloading malware or leaking personal data. [[Social engineering (security)|Social engineering]] is nevertheless highly effective for attacking well-protected computer systems with the exploitation of trust. Social networking becomes an increasingly important tool for cyber criminals to recruit [[money mule]]s to assist their money laundering operations around the globe. Spammers are not only spoofing social networking messages to persuade targets to click on links in emails — they are taking advantage of users’ trust of their social networking connections to attract new victims.
*'''Highly targeted''': The newest twist in "hypertargeting" is malware that is meant to disrupt industrial systems — such as the [[Stuxnet]] network worm, which exploits zero-day vulnerabilities in Microsoft. The first known copy of the worm was discovered in a plant in Germany. A subsequent variant led to a widespread global outbreak.&lt;ref name="cisco"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/vpndevc/security_annual_report_2010.pdf|title=Cisco 2010 Annual Security Report, Cisco, 2010|publisher=|accessdate=21 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Dissemination and use of malware''': malware generally takes the form of a virus, a worm, a Trojan horse, or spyware. In 2009, the majority of malware connects to host Web sites registered in the U.S.A. (51.4%), with China second (17.2%), and Spain third (15.7%). A primary means of malware dissemination is email. It is truly international in scope.
*'''Intellectual property theft (IP theft)''': It is estimated that 90% of the software, DVDs, and CDs sold in some countries are counterfeit, and that the total global trade in counterfeit goods is more than $600 billion a year. In the USA alone, IP theft costs businesses an estimated $250 billion annually, and 750,000 jobs.&lt;ref name="sean"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.uoregon.edu/faculty/shoar/docs/profpres/trendscberdubai.pdf|title=University of Oregon School of Law|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International legislative responses and cooperation==

===International responses===

'''''G8'''''

Group of Eight ([[G8]]) is made up of the heads of eight industrialized countries: the U.S., the United Kingdom, Russia, France, Italy, Japan, Germany, and Canada.

In 1997, G8 released a Ministers' Communiqué that includes an action plan and principles to combat cybercrime and protect data and systems from unauthorized impairment. G8 also mandates that all law enforcement personnel must be trained and equipped to address cybercrime, and designates all member countries to have a point of contact on a 24 hours a day/7 days a week basis.&lt;ref name="Weiping Chang"/&gt;

'''''United Nations'''''

In 1990 the [[UN General Assembly]] adopted a resolution dealing with computer crime legislation.
In 2000 the UN GA adopted a resolution on combating the criminal misuse of information technology.
In 2002 the UN GA adopted a second resolution on the criminal misuse of information technology.&lt;ref name="regional"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itu.int/ITU-D/projects/ITU_EC_ACP/hipcar/events/2010/wg1/docs_wk1/Marco_Gercke_Regional_and_International_Trends_in_Information_Society_Issues_HIPCAR_WG-1_workshop01_20100308.pdf|title=ITU Projects|work=ITU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''ITU'''''

The [[International Telecommunication Union]] (ITU), as a specialized agency within the United Nations, plays a leading role in the standardization and development of telecommunications and cybersecurity issues. The ITU was the lead agency of the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS).

In 2003, Geneva Declaration of Principles and the Geneva Plan of Action were released, which highlights the importance of measures in the fight against cybercrime.

In 2005, the [[Tunis Commitment]] and the Tunis Agenda were adopted for the Information Society.

'''''Council of Europe'''''

[[Council of Europe]] is an international organisation focusing on the development of human rights and democracy in its 47 European member states.

In 2001, the [[Convention on Cybercrime]], the first international convention aimed at Internet criminal behaviors, was co-drafted by the Council of Europe with the addition of USA, Canada, and Japan and signed by its 46 member states. But only 25 countries ratified later. [8] It aims at providing the basis of an effective legal framework for fighting cybercrime, through harmonization of cybercriminal offences qualification, provision for laws empowering law enforcement and enabling international cooperation.

===Regional responses===

'''APEC'''

[[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]] (APEC) is an international forum that seeks to promote promoting open trade and practical economic cooperation in the Asia-Pacific Region.
In 2002, APEC issued Cybersecurity Strategy which is included in the Shanghai Declaration. The strategy outlined six areas for co-operation among member economies including legal developments, information sharing and co-operation, security and technical guidelines, public awareness, and training and education.

'''OECD'''

The [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) is an international economic organisation of 34 countries founded in 1961 to stimulate economic progress and world trade.

In 1990, the Information, Computer and Communications Policy (ICCP) Committee created an Expert Group to develop a set of guidelines for information security that was drafted until 1992 and then adopted by the OECD Council. In 2002, OECD announced the completion of "Guidelines for the Security of Information Systems and Networks: Towards a Culture of Security".

'''European Union'''
[[File:Coat of arms of the European Cybercrime Centre.svg|thumb|The [[Logo|coat of arms]] of the [[European Cybercrime Centre]]]]
In 2001, the [[European Commission]] published a communication titled "Creating a Safer Information Society by Improving the Security of Information Infrastructures and Combating Computer-related Crime".

In 2002, EU presented a proposal for a “Framework Decision on Attacks against Information Systems”. The Framework Decision takes note of Convention on Cybercrime, but concentrates on the harmonisation of substantive criminal law provisions that are designed to protect infrastructure elements.

'''Commonwealth'''

In 2002, the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] presented a model law on cybercrime that provides a legal framework to harmonise legislation within the Commonwealth and enable international cooperation. The model law was intentionally drafted in accordance with the [[Convention on Cybercrime]].&lt;ref name="understand"/&gt;

'''ECOWAS'''

The [[Economic Community of West African States]] (ECOWAS) is a regional group of west African Countries founded in 1975 it has fifteen member states. In 2009, ECOWAS adopted the Directive on Fighting Cybercrime in ECOWAS that provides a legal framework for the member states, which includes substantive criminal law as well as procedural law.&lt;ref name="regional"/&gt;

'''GCC'''

In 2007, the Arab League and Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) recommended at a conference seeking a joint approach that takes into consideration international standards.

===Voluntary industry response===

During the past few years, [[public-private partnerships]] have emerged as a promising approach for tackling cybersecurity issues around the globe. Executive branch agencies (e.g., the [[Federal Trade Commission]] in US), regulatory agencies (e.g., [[Australian Communications and Media Authority]]), separate agencies (e.g., [[ENISA]] in the EU) and industry (e.g., [[MAAWG]], …) are all involved in partnership.

In 2004, the [[London Action Plan]] was founded, which aims at promoting international spam enforcement cooperation and address spam related problems, such as online fraud and deception, phishing, and dissemination of viruses.&lt;ref name="london"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.londonactionplan.org/?q=node/1|title=London Action Plan – International Cybersecurity Enforcement Network|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Case analysis==

===U.S.===
According to [[Sophos]], the U.S. remains the top-spamming country and the source of about one-fifth of the world's spam. Since fighting cybercrime involves great amount of sophisticated legal and other measures, only milestones rather than full texts are provided here.

====Legal and regulatory measures====

The first federal computer crime statute was the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1984 (CFAA).

In 1986, Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) was an amendment to the federal wiretap law.

“National Infrastructure Protection Act of 1996”.

“Cyberspace Electronic Security Act of 1999”.

“Patriot Act of 2001”.

Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) was enacted in 1998.

Cyber Security Enhancement Act (CSEA) was passed in 2002.

Can-spam law issued in 2003 and subsequent implementation measures were made by FCC and FTC.&lt;ref name="spam"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sans.org/reading_room/whitepapers/legal/federal-computer-crime-laws_1446|title=Maxim May, Federal Computer Crime Laws, SANS Institute Reading Room, 2004|publisher=|accessdate=21 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 the USA passed the Anti-Phishing Act which added two new crimes to the US Code.&lt;ref name="trend"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.odpp.nsw.gov.au/speeches/IAP%20-%2013th%20Annual%20Conference%20-%20New%20Technologies.pdf|title=Nicholas Cowdery AM QC, Emerging Trends in Cyber Crime, 13th Annual Conference – New Technologies in Crime and Prosecution: Challenges and Opportunities, International Association of Prosecutors, Singapore, 2008|publisher=|accessdate=21 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the Obama Administration released Cybersecurity Report and policy.
Cybersecurity Act of 2010, a bill seeking to increase collaboration between the public and the private sector on cybersecurity issues.&lt;ref name="wiki"&gt;[[Computer security]]&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of agencies have been set up in the U.S. to fight against cybercrime, including the FBI, National Infrastructure Protection Center, National White Collar Crime Center, Internet Fraud Complaint Center, Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section of the Department of Justice (DoJ), Computer Hacking and Intellectual Property Unit of the DoJ, and Computer Emergency Readiness Team/Coordination Center (CERT/CC) at Carnegie-Mellon, and so on.&lt;ref name="Fortinet"/&gt;

CyberSafe is a public service project designed to educate end users of the Internet about the critical need for personal computer security.&lt;ref name="sean"/&gt;

====Technical measures====
[[Cloud computing]]: It can make infrastructures more resilient to attacks and functions as data backup as well. However, as the Cloud concentrates more and more sensitive data, it becomes increasingly attractive to cybercriminals.

Better [[encryption]] methods are developed to deal with phishing, smishing and other illegal data interception activities.

The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] has set up special technical units and developed [[Carnivore]], a [[computer and network surveillance|computer surveillance]] system which can intercept all packets that are sent to and from the ISP where it is installed, to assist in the investigation of cybercrime.&lt;ref name="Fortinet"/&gt;

====Industry collaboration====
[[Public-private partnership]]: in 2006, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ([[ICANN]]) signed an agreement with the United States Department of Commerce ([[United States Department of Commerce]]) that they partnered through the [[Multistakeholder Model]] of consultation.

In 2008, the second annual [[Cyber Storm II|Cyber Storm]] conference was exercised, involving nine states, four foreign governments, 18 federal agencies and 40 private companies.&lt;ref name="threat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carlisle.army.mil/DIME/documents/CyberThreatsReport2009%5B1%5D.pdf|title=Emerging Cyber Threats Report for 2009, Georgia Tech Information Security Centre, 2008|publisher=|accessdate=21 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, [[National Cyber Security Alliance]]’s public awareness campaign was launched in partnership with the U.S. Department of [[Homeland Security]], the [[Federal Trade Commission]], and others.&lt;ref name="cisco"/&gt;

Incentives for ISP: Though the cost of security measures increases, Internet Service Providers ([[ISP]]) are encouraged to fight against cybercrime to win consumer support, good reputation and brand image among consumer and peer ISP as well.&lt;ref name="JMB"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308596109000986|title=Cybersecurity: Stakeholder incentives, externalities, and policy options|first1=Johannes M.|last1=Bauer|first2=Michel J.

====International cooperation====

USA has signed and also ratified [[Convention on Cybercrime]].

United States has actively participated in G8/OECD/APEC/[[Organization of American States|OAS]]/U.S.-China cooperation in cracking down international cyber crime.

====Future challenges====

[[Privacy]] in tracking down cybercrime is being challenged and becomes a controversial issue.

[[Public-private partnership]]. As the U.S. government gets more involved in the development of IT products, many companies worry this may stifle their innovation, even undermining efforts to develop more secure technology products. New legislative proposals now being considered by the U.S. Congress could be potentially intrusive on private industry, which may prevent enterprises from responding effectively to emerging and changing threats. Cyber attacks and security breaches are increasing in frequency and sophistication, they are targeting organizations and individuals with malware and anonymization techniques that can evade current security controls. Current perimeter-intrusion detection, signature-based malware, and anti-virus solutions are providing little defense. Relatively few organizations have recognized organized cyber criminal networks, rather than hackers, as their greatest potential cyber security threat; even fewer are prepared to address this threat.&lt;ref name="dell"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deloitte.com/assets/Dcom-UnitedStates/Local%20Assets/Documents/AERS/us_aers_Deloitte%20Cyber%20Crime%20POV%20Jan252010.pdf|title=Cyber crime: a clear and present danger combating the fastest growing cyber security threat, Delloitte, 2010|publisher=|accessdate=21 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===

In January 2009, China was ranked No.3 spam-producing country in the world, according to data compiled by security vendor [[Sophos]]. Sophos now ranks China as spam producer No.20, right behind Spain.&lt;ref name="china"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.networkworld.com/|title=Welcome to Network World.com|work=Network World}}&lt;/ref&gt;

China's [[underground economy]] is booming with estimated 10 billion RMB in 2009. [[Hacker (computer security)|Hacking]], [[malware]] and [[spam (electronic)|spam]] are immensely popular. With patriotic [[hacktivism]], people hack to defend the country.&lt;ref name="yip"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/21801/|title=An investigation into Chinese cybercrime and the underground economy in comparison with the West.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Legal and regulatory measures====

Criminal Law – the basic law identifies the law enforcement concerning cybercrime.

In 2000, the Decision on Internet Security of the Standing Committee of the NPC was passed.

In 2000, China issued a series of Internet rules that prohibit anyone to propagate pornography, virus and scams.

In 2003, China signed UN General Assembly Resolution 57/239 on “Creation of a global culture of cybersecurity”.

In 2003, China signed Geneva Declaration of Principles of the World Summit on the Information Society.

In 2006, an anti-spam initiative was launched.

In July 2006, the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF), which included China, issued a statement that its members should implement cybercrime and cybersecurity laws “in accordance with their national conditions and by referring to relevant international instruments”.

In 2009, ASEAN-China framework agreement on network and information security emergency response were adopted.

In 2009, agreement within the Shanghai Cooperation Organization on information security was made.&lt;ref name="war"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ewi.info/china%E2%80%99s-cybersecurity-and-pre-emptive-cyber-war|title=China’s Cybersecurity and Pre-emptive Cyber War, EastWestInstitute|publisher=|accessdate=21 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Technical measures====

[[Internet censorship]]: China has made it tougher to register new Internet domains and has put on stricter [[content control]] to help reduce spam.&lt;ref name="china"/&gt;

"[[Golden Shield]] Project" or "The [[Great Firewall]] of China": a national Internet control and censorship project.
In 2009, [[Green Dam]] software: It restricts access to a secret list of sites, and monitors users’activity.&lt;ref name="trend"/&gt;

[[Operating system]] change: China is trying to get around this by using [[Linux]], though with a lot of technical impediments to solve.&lt;ref name="law"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinaeconomicreview.com/node/43615|title=China outlaws cyber crime|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Industry collaboration====

Internet Society of China — the group behind China's anti-spam effort — is working on standards and better ways of cooperating to fight cybercrime.

ISPs have become better at working with customers to cut down on the spam problem.&lt;ref name="china"/&gt;

====International cooperation====

In 2005, China signed up for the London Action Plan on spam, an international effort to curb the problem.

Anti-Spam “Beijing Declaration”2006 International Anti-Spam Summit was held.

The APEC Working Group on Telecommunications agreed an action plan for 2010–2015 that included “fostering a safe and trusted ICT environment”.

In January 2011, the United States and China committed for the first time at head of state level to work together on a bilateral basis on issues of cybersecurity. "Fighting Spam to Build Trust" will be the first effort to help overcome the trust deficit between China and the United States on cybersecurity. Cyber Security China Summit 2011 will be held in Shanghai.&lt;ref name="war"/&gt;

====Achievement and future challenges====

Successfully cracking down spam volume in 2009. However, insufficient criminal laws and regulations are great impediments in fighting cybercrime. A lack of electronic evidence laws or regulations, low rank of existing internet control regulations and technological impediments altogether limit the efficiency of Chinese governments' law enforcement.&lt;ref name="now"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icclr.law.ubc.ca/china_ccprcp/files/Presentations%20and%20Publications/47%20The%20Current%20Situation%20of%20Cybercrime%20in%20China_English.pdf|title=Zhang Jianwen, The Current Situation of Cybercrimes in China, National Prosecutors College, 2006|publisher=|accessdate=21 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Josip Križaj''' (13 March 1911 – October 8, 1948), also known by the [[Italianization|Italianized]] name ''Giuseppe Krizai'', nicknamed ''Pepi'', was a [[Slovenes|Slovene]] ([[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]]) military pilot and a veteran of the [[Spanish Civil War]].

Križaj was born in [[Kopriva, Sežana|Kopriva]] on the [[Karst Plateau]], then part of the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] county of [[Gorizia and Gradisca]]. After [[World War I]], the region became part of the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Kingdom of Italy]] and Križaj became an Italian citizen. Already at a young age he showed a passion for flight, which led him to pursue a pilot's course at the royal officer school in [[Capua]] near [[Naples]], [[Italy]].

Due to his Slovene ethnic origins, he was not allowed into the regular [[Regia Aeronautica|Italian Royal Air Force]], but he was nevertheless granted a place in the reserves. Because of the physical hardships endured during the training and his pro-[[Slovenia]]n and pro-Yugoslav national political stance, he flew a [[Fiat AS.1]]  airplane on 25 June 1932 from [[Udine]] to [[Ljubljana]], crossing the border of [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], which led to much media interest. In 1934, he became a Yugoslav citizen. Following the outbreak of the [[Spanish Civil War]], he joined the [[Yugoslav volunteers in the Spanish Civil War|Yugoslav volunteers]] that fought on the side of the [[Spanish II Republic|Spanish Republic]]. He was a member of the [[Squadron España]], and was shot down once and captured during the war. After his return to Yugoslavia, he moved to [[Serbia]], where he lived during [[World War II]].

After the war, he became a [[SFR Yugoslav Air Force]] military pilot. His life ended on 8 October 1948, when his aircraft, a [[Yakovlev Yak-3]], crashed into Mount [[Snežnik]] in southwestern Slovenia because of poor visibility in dense fog. 

Today, the [[Ajdovščina]] Flying Club is named after Josip Križaj, and there is a monument to him at [[Portorož Airport]].

==Plot==
Japari Park is a large zoo home to extant species, [[endangered species|endangered]] species, [[extinction|extinct]] species, [[List of cryptids|cryptids]] and some [[legendary creature]]s. Due to a mysterious substance known as "Sandstar", many of the animals have become [[Moe anthropomorphism|anthropomorphized]] into girls known as {{nihongo|Friends|フレンズ|Furenzu}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet|number=578558338595598336|user=yosRRX|title=...|date=March 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The manga follows a park keeper named Nana who looks after the various Friends in Japari Park. In the anime, a girl known only as Kaban wakes up in Japari Park with no recollection of who she is or how she got there and encounters a Serval friend. Together, they set out on an adventure to find out what kind of animal Kaban is, passing through multiple regions of Japari Park and meeting new Friends along the way.

After receiving another message from Mirai mentioning "four gods", the girls reach the top of the mountain where Sandstar forms. It is there that Raccoon and Fennec catch up to them, with Raccoon claiming that Kaban had stolen her hat, although she returns it after hearing about all of her good deeds. As the girls follow Mirai's instructions to dig up four tablets representing the four gods, the black Cerulean below starts absorbing Sandstar Raw from the mountain to grow larger. With the four tablets in place, the girls manage to put up a filter to stop the Cerulean absorbing more Sandstar Raw. Determined to protect the park, Kaban comes up with a plan to use the boat to lure the Cerulean into the ocean. When the plan goes awry and Serval gets swallowed up by the Cerulean, however, Kaban dives in to pull Serval out before luring the Cerulean away, sacrificing herself in the process.

Meanwhile, Lucky Beast, breaking his rule of not speaking directly to Friends due to a human being in danger, sends a transmission to all of the other Friends, who join Serval in confronting the Cerulean and rescuing Kaban. Despite being eaten by the Cerulean, which would normally turn a Friend back into its original animal form, Kaban, having been a Human Friend to begin with, just ends up returning to normal. However, Lucky Beast sacrifices himself to bring the Cerulean out on the boat, sinking into the ocean along with it, although Kaban manages to find his A.I. still intact. One month later, as a big party is held at an amusement park, Raccoon explains how Kaban became a Friend after Sandstar landed on her hat, which originally belonged to Mirai and contained a strand of human hair from her head. After receiving one more message from Mirai, Kaban sets sail in search of other humans, with Serval and the other Friends deciding to follow after her.

===Stage play===
A stage play adaptation of ''Kemono Friends'' with an original storyline ran at the Shinagawa Prince Hotel Club eX in Tokyo from 2017 June 14 to 18. Hiroki Murakami directed the play and penned the script while some of the characters were portrayed by the same actors who voiced them in the anime series. It ran again from 2018 January 13 to 21.

==Reception==
===Anime===
Initial criticisms often latched onto the 3D CGI animation style and character design. Critic [[Hiroki Azuma (critic)|Hiroki Azuma]] reported on Twitter that he stopped watching partway through the first episode. However, its popularity increased explosively after the release of the fourth episode.&lt;ref name="2017-02-16 jcast"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.j-cast.com/2017/02/16290754.html|title=アニメ「けものフレンズ」が突如大ブレイク 社会現象か虚像か、巡りバトル|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Referring to the simplistic and childish but addictive nature of the show, it has been described (in ironic disapproval) as "causing one's IQ to melt" and "lowering one's intelligence".&lt;ref name="2017-02-15 netorabo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nlab.itmedia.co.jp/nl/articles/1702/15/news135.html|title=「けもフレ」円盤入り書籍の予約がAmazonランキングで1位に　KADOKAWA内は「けもフレ」がほぼ総なめ|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2017-02-15 huffington post"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.jp/2017/02/15/kemono-frends-nhk_n_14783606.html|title=「けものフレンズ」で動物園に行く人が増加？ NHK報道に多摩動物園の反応は|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its low production quality, the anime series earned praise from critics and viewers in Japan due to its well crafted storyline and characters, becoming a fad in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interest/2017-04-01/tv-tokyo-head-praises-kemono-friends-as-series-concludes/.114143|title=TV Tokyo Head Praises Kemono Friends as Series Concludes|work=Anime News Network|access-date=2018-11-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nick Creamer of ''[[Anime News Network]]'' gave the series an overall grade of B, praising the worldbuilding and criticizing the visual aspects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/kemono-friends/.114176|title= Kemono Friends|first= Nick|last= Creamer|date= April 3, 2017|accessdate= April 4, 2017|work= [[Anime News Network]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Multiple phrases and exclamations from the anime have become popular keywords on [[Twitter]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animatetimes.com/news/details.php?id=1486624170|title=ネット上の『けものフレンズ』ブームにえらいひとから一言!? - アニメイトタイムズ|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2017-02-16 jcast"/&gt; ''Kemono Friends''-related phrases have been tweeted by the accounts of [[Sharp Corporation|Sharp]] and [[Warner Bros.|Warner Bros.

The first episode of many anime shows are available for free viewing on [[Niconico Douga]]. The first episode of ''Kemono Friends'' quickly surpassed the first episode of ''[[Is the Order a Rabbit?]]'' (9 million views as of September 2017; uploaded on April 16, 2014) as well as other popular shows like ''[[Attack on Titan]]'' in total views. By February 5, it had surpassed 1 million views, by April 4, it had surpassed 5 million views, and by August 24, it had reached a record-breaking 10 million views.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://dic.nicovideo.jp/a/%E3%81%91%E3%82%82%E3%81%AE%E3%83%95%E3%83%AC%E3%83%B3%E3%82%BA%201%E8%A9%B1%E3%80%8C%E3%81%95%E3%81%B0%E3%82%93%E3%81%AA%E3%81%A1%E3%81%BB%E3%83%BC%E3%80%8D|title=けものフレンズ　1話「さばんなちほー」とは (ケモノフレンズイチワサバンナチホーとは) [単語記事] - ニコニコ大百科|work=ニコニコ大百科|access-date=2017-09-26|language=ja-JP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The week after episode 12 and around the time episodes would normally air, demand for an episode 13 reached Twitter's international trends list,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nlab.itmedia.co.jp/nl/articles/1704/04/news135.html|title=「けものフレンズ13話」Twitterでトレンド入り　放送終了に耐えられないフレンズたちが……|work=ねとらぼ|access-date=2018-11-10|language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the episode 12.1 short that was uploaded that day (April 5) had reached over 1 million views on both Niconico and YouTube by April 7.

Multiple other ''Kemono Friends'' merchandise topped Amazon rankings upon announcement.&lt;ref name="2017-02-15 netorabo" /&gt; The unexpected popularity of the show created a shortage in supply and reservations had to be placed on backorder.&lt;ref name="2017-02-16 jcast" /&gt;

It was reported on [[NHK]]'s News Check 11 that an increase in the number of visits to zoos rose as a direct result of inspired viewers of ''Kemono Friends''.&lt;ref name="2017-02-15 huffington post"/&gt; ''Kemono Friends'' has also participated in multiple promotional events with zoos and other establishments, such as posting boards in the image of the franchise's anthropomorphized animals near their real-life counterparts. One of the results of this was a [[Humboldt penguin]] named [[Grape-kun]] ({{Lang-ja|グレープ君}}) at the Saitama [[Tobu Zoo]] that appeared to have fallen in love with its ''Kemono Friends'' depiction, display mating behavior towards the board. The popularity of this unusual incident was substantial, such that the penguin was featured on the ''[[Obi (publishing)|obi]]'' of the fourth guidebook, and the board was not removed after the promotion ended. Grape-kun died on October 12, 2017 beside the cutout.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-news-from-elsewhere-41608350|title=Japan mourns anime-loving penguin|date=2017-10-13|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-10-14|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==

===Dispute between Kadokawa and Yaoyorozu===

On September 25, 2017, the director of the anime, Tatsuki, revealed on Twitter that Kadokawa had decided to replace him for the production of the second season; fan response included immense condemnation of Kadokawa and widespread support of Tatsuki, as Tatsuki is regarded as being a highly instrumental part of the anime's charm and success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite tweet|user=MomentsJapan|number=912278764586856448|title=「突然ですが、けものフレンズのアニメから外れる事になりました。」とたつき監督（@irodori7）https://twitter.com/i/moments/912276626947182592 …|last=モーメント|first=Twitter|date=2017-09-25|website=@MomentsJapan|language=ja|access-date=2017-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite tweet|user=MomentsJapan|number=912316547539943430|title=海外のフレンズもショックを受けている様子…。 #NoTatsukiNoTanoshi https://twitter.com/i/moments/912312642085064705 …|last=モーメント|first=Twitter|date=2017-09-25|website=@MomentsJapan|language=ja|access-date=2017-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite tweet|user=MomentsJapan|number=912554397082595328|title=「たつき監督辞めないで！」一晩で2万人以上の署名。 #けものフレンズhttps://twitter.com/i/moments/912543690274496512 …|last=モーメント|first=Twitter|date=2017-09-25|website=@MomentsJapan|language=ja|access-date=2017-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nlab.itmedia.co.jp/nl/articles/1709/25/news112.html|title=「突然ですが、けものフレンズのアニメから外れる事になりました」たつき監督がTwitterで報告　ファンに衝撃広がる|work=ねとらぼ|access-date=2017-09-26|language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fans left angry comments en masse towards Kadokawa on Niconico Douga's stream of the first episode, with some declaring that they would cancel their Niconico Douga premium membership with the service in response to Tatsuki's firing, as Dwango [Niconico's owner] and Kadokawa are both child companies of [[Kadokawa Dwango]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nlab.itmedia.co.jp/nl/articles/1709/26/news066.html|title=

This led to further backlash against Kadokawa, with accusations that they had used the actresses to deflect blame from the company itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interest/2017-09-27/fans-take-to-change.org-to-bring-back-former-kemono-friends-director/.121885|title=Fans take to Change.org to bring back former Kemono Friends director|work=[[Anime News Network]]|access-date=2017-09-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7405">'''Animaze -  Montreal International Animation Film Festival''' is an annual film festival in [[Montreal, Quebec]], Canada dedicated to the celebration of animation in all forms.  Now going into its fourth year the next edition will take place August 17–21, 2017. ANIMAZE presents animated film of all genres from around the world which may have limited theatrical releases.

The festival's premier edition was held on November 18–20, 2011 and was built around core events&lt;ref name=Sound-17-1-2012&gt;{{cite web|title=Welcome the first annual Animaze Animation Film Festival|url=http://www.soundonsight.org/welcome-the-first-annual-animaze-animation-film-festival/|work=Sight on Sound|publisher=Sound On Sight|accessdate=17 January 2012|author=Ricky in Blog, Film Fests|date=Nov 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  which all subsequent editions will contain:

* An international film festival and industry conference including masterclasses  
* Augmented and virtual reality content and symposium and 360º Dome
* An international student short film contest

==International film contest==
Animaze's first objective is to bring animation professionals from around the world together, to showcase animated content from around the world in the hub of animation industry.  Animaze awards a various  prize to the winning films as determined by a panel of judges and a "Audience Favorite" as determined by the viewers.&lt;ref name=Sound-17-1-2012 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Brew-21-1-2012&gt;{{cite web|title=Animaze Animation Film Festival Announces Its First Edition |url=http://www.cartoonbrew.com/biz/animaze-animation-film-festival-announces-its-first-edition.html/ |work=Cartoon Brew|publisher=Cartoon Brew|accessdate=21 January 2012|author=Chris Arrant|date=Sep 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Animaze-21-1-2012&gt;{{cite web|title=Animaze Festival Official Website|url=http://www.animazefestival.com/ |publisher=Animaze Festival|accessdate=21 January 2012|author=Michael Dahan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Saturday morning cartoon charity show==
In an effort to give back to the community, Animaze Festival dedicates one of its shows for a charity screening that pays tribute to an important era in North American animation, the Saturday Morning Cartoon. Each year, Animaze selects a year and a specific television network and highlights the best shows from that line-up with all the proceeds going towards the charity of their choice.&lt;ref name=Sound-17-1-2012 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Brew-21-1-2012 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Animaze-21-1-2012 /&gt;

==Student shorts contest==
To help get local talent involved in the festival, Animaze holds a Student Shorts contest for animation schools in and around the Montreal area. This event pits school vs. school in an old fashion battle-royal. Each school must submit a collection of shorts from its student body and the schools are judged by their cumulative submission. The judges for this event are representatives from each of the schools in which they rate all the shorts entered except those from their own institution. The school who's combined shorts acquire the highest grade wins the top prize which is an Oscar type trophy and bragging rights for the year as the "Best Animation School" in town.&lt;ref name=Sound-17-1-2012 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Brew-21-1-2012 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Animaze-21-1-2012 /&gt;

The contest also recognizes and honors the 3 individual shorts that scored the highest overall mark. The individual winners receive an award certificate and prizes to help them in the progression of their studies.

The grand prize awarded is held in high regards by the film schools as they are not being judged or awarded a prize from the Animaze Festival but rather from amongst their peers and it is the other schools that declare the winning animation program.

==Master class==
Animaze Festival invites a guest director to address important issues within the animation industry. The lecture is preceded by a feature which the guest speaker was involved with.&lt;ref name=Sound-17-1-2012 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Brew-21-1-2012 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Animaze-21-1-2012 /&gt;

==Classic film tribute==
To honor animated films of yesteryear, Animaze plays tribute to ground-breaking film which is celebrating an anniversary by screening it again for its fans on the big screen. If possible, the film will be shown in it original 35mm and people involved in the film's creation will be invited to the event.&lt;ref name=Sound-17-1-2012 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Brew-21-1-2012 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Animaze-21-1-2012 /&gt;

Chemically, mecamylamine is a secondary [[aliphatic]] [[amine]], with a pK&lt;sub&gt;aH&lt;/sub&gt; of 11.2&lt;ref name="pmid13476377"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Schanker LS, Shore PA, Brodie BB, Hogben CA |title=Absorption of drugs from the stomach. I. The rat |journal=J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. |volume=120 |issue=4 |pages=528–39 |year=1957 |pmid=13476377 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pharmacology and clinical applications==
Mecamylamine has been used as an orally-active [[ganglionic blocker]] in treating [[autonomic dysreflexia]] and [[hypertension]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = T. O. Soine | date = 1966 | title = Textbook of Organic Medicinal and Pharmaceutical Chemistry | edition = 5th| editor = C. O. Wilson, O. Gisvold and R. F. Doerge | pages = 468–546 | location = Philadelphia | publisher = Lippincott}}&lt;/ref&gt; but, like most ganglionic blockers, it is more often used now as a research tool.

Mecamylamine is also sometimes used as an [[antiaddictive]] drug to help people stop smoking tobacco,&lt;ref name="pmid12080428"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Shytle RD, Penny E, Silver AA, Goldman J, Sanberg PR |title=Mecamylamine (Inversine): an old antihypertensive with new research directions |journal=J Hum Hypertens |volume=16 |issue=7 |pages=453–7 |date=July 2002 |pmid=12080428 |doi=10.1038/sj.jhh.1001416}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is now more widely used for this application than it is for lowering blood pressure. This effect is thought to be due to its blocking [[Alpha-3 beta-4 nicotinic receptor|α3β4]] [[nicotinic receptors]] in the brain. It has also been reported to bring about sustained relief from tics in [[Tourette syndrome]] when a series of more usually used agents had failed.{{medcn|date=October 2016}}

In a recent double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase II trial in Indian patients with major depression, (''S'')-mecamylamine (TC-5214) appeared to have efficacy as an [[Augmentation (psychiatry)|augmentation]] therapy. This is the first substantive evidence that shows that compounds where the primary pharmacology is antagonism to neuronal nicotinic receptors will have antidepressant properties.&lt;ref name="pmid19040552"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Lippiello PM, Beaver JS, Gatto GJ, etal |title=TC-5214 (S-(+)-mecamylamine): a neuronal nicotinic receptor modulator with antidepressant activity |journal=CNS Neurosci Ther |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=266–77 |year=2008 |pmid=19040552 |doi=10.1111/j.1755-5949.2008.00054.x |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid17016705"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rabenstein RL, Caldarone BJ, Picciotto MR |title=The nicotinic antagonist mecamylamine has antidepressant-like effects in wild-type but not beta2- or alpha7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit knockout mice |journal=Psychopharmacology |volume=189 |issue=3 |pages=395–401 |date=December 2006 |pmid=17016705 |doi=10.1007/s00213-006-0568-z |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; TC-5214 is currently in Phase III of clinical development as an add-on treatment and on stage II as a monotherapy treatment for major depression. The first results reported from the Phase III trials showed that TC-5214 failed to meet the primary goal and the trial did not replicate the effects that had been encouraging in the Phase II trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=John Carroll |url=http://www.fiercebiotech.com/story/key-aztargacept-depression-drug-flunks-first-phase-iii-test/2011-11-08 |title=Key AZ/Targacept depression drug flunks first Phase III test |publisher=Fiercebiotech.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.businessweek.com/article.asp?documentKey=1376-LUBZKL6JIJVL01-1OBSNUJNAR30QM320MFNHCQ74T |title=Targacept Shares Fall After Depression Medicine Misses Goal |publisher=News.businessweek.com |date=2007-01-15 |accessdate=2011-11-09 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Development is funded by Targacept and AstraZeneca.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astrazeneca.com/cs/Satellite?blobcol=urldata&amp;blobheader=application%2Fpdf&amp;blobheadername1=Content-Disposition&amp;blobheadername2=MDT-Type&amp;blobheadervalue1=inline%3B+filename%3DDownload-pipeline-summary.pdf&amp;blobheadervalue2=abinary%3B+charset%3DUTF-8&amp;blobkey=id&amp;blobtable=MungoBlobs&amp;blobwhere=1285619440126&amp;ssbinary=true |title=AstraZeneca Pipeline as of the 27th of January 2011 |date= |accessdate=2011-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It did not produce meaningful, beneficial results on patients as measured by changes on the [[Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale]] after eight weeks of treatment as compared with placebo.

(''S'')-(+)-Mecamylamine [[Dissociation constant|dissociates]] more slowly from [[alpha-4 beta-2|α4β2]] and [[alpha-3 beta-4|α3β4]] receptors than does the (''R'')-(−)-[[enantiomer]].&lt;ref name="pmid11303054"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Papke RL, Sanberg PR, Shytle RD |title=Analysis of mecamylamine stereoisomers on human nicotinic receptor subtypes |journal=J.

Mecamylamine was brought to market by [[Merck &amp; Co.]] in the 1950s; in 1996 Merck sold the asset to [[Layton Bioscience]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shytle|first1=RD|last2=Penny|first2=E|last3=Silver|first3=AA|last4=Goldman|first4=J|last5=Sanberg|first5=PR|title=Mecamylamine (Inversine): an old antihypertensive with new research directions.|journal=Journal of human hypertension|date=July 2002|volume=16|issue=7|pages=453–7|doi=10.1038/sj.jhh.1001416|pmid=12080428|url=http://www.nature.com/jhh/journal/v16/n7/full/1001416a.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, Targacept acquired it from Layton, intending to repurpose it for CNS conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Press release: Targacept, Inc.

[[Monaco]]'s entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2004]] in [[Istanbul]] was the first after a twenty-five-year break. Broadcaster [[Télé Monte Carlo|TMC]] decided it was time for a comeback to the contest by the country who had previously won in 1971. An internal jury chose singer [[Maryon]] to represent the country with the song "Notre Planète" ("Our Planet") sung in [[French language|French]]. Because of Monaco's absence from the contest, they had to compete in the semi-final (incidentally this was the first televised Eurovision semi-final). The country only managed a 19th place with 10 points and therefore did not qualify for the final. The voting from Monaco during the semi-final was declared invalid because of the lack of votes cast and so a back-up jury had to be used for both the semi-final and the final.

It was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://landmarkhunter.com/137635-mt-horeb-opera-block/|title=Mt. Horeb Opera Block|publisher=Landmark Hunter.com|accessdate=2012-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The building has hosted theatrical troupes, dances and political rallies. It began showing movies after 1907.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/hp/register/viewSummary.asp?refnum=89000068|title=Mt.

The '''Nine Years' War''' or '''Tyrone's Rebellion'''&lt;ref&gt;''Tyrone's Rebellion: The Outbreak of the Nine Years War in Tudor Ireland''. Hiram Morgan. Boydell Press (1993).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Nine Years War, 1593-1603: O'Neill, Mountjoy and the military revolution, ''. James O'Neill. Four Courts Press (2017).&lt;/ref&gt; took place in Ireland from 1593 to 1603. It was fought between the forces of [[Gaels|Gaelic]] [[Irish people|Irish]] chieftains [[Hugh O'Neill, 2nd Earl of Tyrone|Hugh O'Neill]] of [[Kings of Tír Eoghain|Tír Eoghain]], [[Hugh Roe O'Donnell]] of [[Kings of Tír Chonaill|Tír Chonaill]] and their allies, against [[Kingdom of England|English]] [[Kingdom of Ireland|rule in Ireland]]. The war was fought in all parts of the country, but mainly in the northern province of [[Ulster]]. It ended in defeat for the Irish lords, which led to their exile in the [[Flight of the Earls]], and to the [[Plantation of Ulster]].

The war against O'Neill and his allies was the largest conflict fought by England in the [[Elizabethan era]]. At the height of the conflict (1600–1601) more than 18,000 soldiers were fighting in the English army in Ireland.&lt;ref name="Falls, Elizabeth pg 49"&gt;Falls, Elizabeth's irish Wars, pg 49&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, the English army assisting the Dutch during the [[Eighty Years' War]] was never more than 12,000 strong at any one time.&lt;ref name="Falls, Elizabeth pg 49"/&gt;

==Causes==
The Nine Years' War was caused by the clashes between the Gaelic Irish lord Hugh O'Neill and the [[Tudor conquest of Ireland|advance of the English state in Ireland]], from control over [[the Pale]] to ruling the whole island. In resisting this advance, O'Neill managed to rally other Irish [[clans|septs]] who were dissatisfied with English government and some [[Catholics]] who opposed the spread of [[Protestantism]] in Ireland.

===Rise of Hugh O'Neill===
[[File:Hugh O'Neill, 1608.jpg|thumb|left|Hugh O'Neill, 2nd Earl of Tyrone]]
[[Hugh O'Neill, 2nd Earl of Tyrone|Hugh O'Neill]] came from the powerful Ó Néill sept of [[Tyrone]], which dominated the centre of the northern province of [[Ulster]]{{ref|3|3}}. His father, Matthew O'Neill, [[Baron Dungannon]], was the reputed son of [[Conn O'Neill, 1st Earl of Tyrone|Conn O'Neill the Lame]], the first O'Neill to be created [[Earl of Tyrone]] by the [[The Crown|English Crown]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Mac Nevin, James Duffy, ''The Confiscation of Ulster, in the Reign of James the First, Commonly Called The Ulster Plantation'' (Dublin:  1840), p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; Matthew O'Neill was murdered, and [[Séan Ó Néill|Seán 'An Díomais' Ó Néill]] banished the child Hugh O'Neill from [[Ulster]].  The Hovenden family brought Hugh up in [[the Pale]], and the English authorities sponsored him as a reliable lord. In 1587 Hugh O'Neill persuaded [[Queen Elizabeth I]] to make him Earl of Tyrone (or ''Tir Eoghain''), the English title his grandfather had held. However, the real power in Ulster lay not in the legal title of Earl of Tyrone, but in the position of '''The Ó Néill''', or chief of the O'Neills, then held by [[Turlough Luineach Ó Neill]]. This position commanded the obedience of all the O'Neills and their dependants in central Ulster; in 1595. Only after Turlough Luineach O'Neill died in September 1595 could Hugh O'Neill be inaugurated as 'the O'Neill'.

From [[Hugh Roe O'Donnell]], his ally, Hugh O'Neill enlisted Scottish mercenaries (known as [[Redshank (soldier)|Redshanks]]). Within his own territories, O'Neill was entitled to limited military service from his sub-lords or ''uirithe''. He also recruited his tenants and dependants into military service and tied the peasantry to the land to increase food production (see [[Kern (soldier)|Kern]]).&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Canny, Hugh O'Neill and the Changing Face of Gaelic Ulster&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, he hired large contingents of Irish mercenaries (known as ''buanadha'') under [[leader]]s such as Richard Tyrell. To arm his soldiers, O'Neill bought [[muskets]], ammunition and [[pike (weapon)|pikes]] from Scotland and England. From 1591, O'Donnell, on O'Neill's behalf, had been in contact with [[Philip II of Spain]], appealing for military aid against their common enemy and citing also their shared [[Catholicism]]. With the aid of Spain, O'Neill could arm and feed over 8,000 men, unprecedented for a Gaelic lord, and so was well prepared to resist any further English attempts to govern Ulster.&lt;ref&gt;
Hiram Morgan, ''Tyrone's Rebellion'', Suffolk 1993, p19.
&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=February 2016}}

===Crown advances into Ulster===
By the early 1590s, the north of Ireland was attracting the attention of Lord Deputy Fitzwilliam, who had been charged with bringing the area under crown control. A provincial presidency was proposed; the candidate for office was [[Henry Bagenal]], an English colonist settled in [[Newry]], who would seek to impose the authority of the crown through [[sheriff]]s to be appointed by the Dublin government. O'Neill had eloped with Bagenal's sister, Mabel, and married her against her brother's wishes; the bitterness of this episode was made more intense after Mabel's early death a few years after the marriage, when she was reportedly in despair about her husbands's neglect and his mistresses{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}.

In 1591, Fitzwilliam broke up the MacMahon lordship in [[Monaghan]] when The MacMahon, hereditary leader of the [[sept]], resisted the imposition of an English sheriff; he was hanged and his lordship divided. There was an outcry, with several sources alleging corruption against Fitzwilliam, but the same policy was soon applied in [[Longford]] (territory of the [[O'Farrell]]s) and [[East Breifne]] ([[Cavan]] — territory of the [[O'Reilly]]s). Any attempt to further the same in the [[Hugh O'Neill, Earl of Tyrone|O'Neill]] and [[O'Donnell]] territories was bound to be resisted by force of arms.

The most significant difficulty for English forces in confronting O'Neill lay in the natural defences that [[Ulster]] enjoyed. By land there were only two viable points of entry to the province for troops marching from the south: at [[Newry]] in the east, and [[Sligo]] in the west – the terrain in between was largely mountains, woodland, bog and marshes.  Sligo Castle was held by the [[O'Conor|O'Connor]] sept, but suffered constant threat from the O'Donnells; the route from Newry into the heart of Ulster ran through several easily defended passes and could only be maintained in wartime with a punishing sacrifice by the Crown of men and money.

The English did have a foothold within Ulster, around [[Carrickfergus]] north of [[Belfast Lough]], where a small colony had been planted in the 1570s; but here too the terrain was unfavorable for the English, since [[Lough Neagh]] and the [[river Bann]], the lower stretch of which ran through the dense forest of Glenconkeyn, formed an effective barrier on the eastern edge of the O'Neill territory. A further difficulty lay in the want of a port on the northern sea coast where the English might launch an amphibious attack into O'Neill's rear. The English strategic situation was complicated by interference from Scots clans, which were supplying O'Neill with soldiers and materials and playing upon the English need for local assistance, while keeping an eye to their own territorial influence in [[Route, County Antrim|the Route]] (modern [[County Antrim]]).

==War breaks out==
In 1592 [[Hugh Roe O'Donnell]] had driven an English sheriff, Captain Willis, out of his territory, Tir Chónaill (now part of [[County Donegal]]). In 1593, Maguire supported by Troops out of Tyrone led by Hugh O'Neill's brother, Cormac MacBaron, had combined to resist Willis' introduction as Sheriff into Maguire's [[Fermanagh]]. After Willis was expelled from Fermanagh Maguire with the aid of MacBaron launched a punishing raids into northern Connacht, burning villages around Ballymote castle.&lt;ref&gt;James O'Neill, Maguire's revolt but Tyrone's war: proxy war in Fermanagh 1593-4, Seanchas Ard Mhacha, vol. 26, no. 1 (2016), pp 44-5&lt;/ref&gt; 
. Maguire launched a more ambitious raid into Connacht during June, when he clashed with forces led by the governor of Connacht, Sir Richard Bingham, but the English were beaten back and Maguire continued to spoil thorough Roscommon before returning north. Initially O'Neill assisted the English, hoping to be named as Lord President of Ulster himself. [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]], though, had feared that O'Neill had no intention of being a simple landlord and that his ambition was to usurp her authority and be "a Prince of Ulster". For this reason she refused to grant O'Neill provincial presidency or any other position which would have given him authority to govern Ulster on the crown's behalf. Once it became clear that Henry Bagenal was marked to assume the presidency of Ulster, O'Neill accepted that an English offensive was inevitable, and so joined his allies in open rebellion in February 1595, with an attack on the English fort on the [[River Blackwater, Northern Ireland|River Blackwater]].

Later in 1595 O'Neill and O'Donnell wrote to King [[Philip II of Spain]] for help, and offered to be his [[vassal]]s. He also proposed that his cousin [[Archduke Albert, sovereign of the Habsburg Netherlands|Archduke Albert]] be made Prince of Ireland, but nothing came of this.&lt;ref&gt;Certificate given by Captain Alonso Cobos to the Irish Catholics, 15 May 1596 (Cal. S. P. Spain, 1587–1603, p.169); O'Neill and O'Donnell to Philip II, 16 May 1596 (ibid, p. 620)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucc.ie/celt/Proclamation.pdf Morgan H., "FAITH AND FATHERLAND OR QUEEN AND COUNTRY"; Dúiche Néill: Journal of the O¹Neill country historical society, 1994]&lt;/ref&gt; Philip II replied encouraging them in January 1596.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.irishinspain.org/archivos/philip_eghernan.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110206024001/http://www.irishinspain.org/archivos/philip_eghernan.pdf |archivedate=6 February 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[2nd Spanish Armada|unsuccessful armada]] sailed in 1596; the war in Ireland became a part of the wider [[Anglo-Spanish War (1585–1604)|Anglo-Spanish War]].

===Irish victory at Yellow Ford===
The English authorities in [[Dublin Castle]] were slow to comprehend the scale of the rebellion. After failed negotiations in 1595, English armies tried to break into Ulster but were repulsed by a trained army including musketeers in prepared positions; after a stinging defeat at the [[Battle of Clontibret]], successive English offensives were driven back in the following years. At the [[Battle of the Yellow Ford]] in 1598 up to 2,000&amp;nbsp;English troops were killed after being attacked on the march to [[Armagh]]. The rest were surrounded in Armagh itself but negotiated safe passage for themselves in return for evacuating the town. O'Neill's personal enemy, Sir Henry Bagenal, had been in command of the army and was killed during the early engagements. It was the heaviest defeat ever suffered by the English army in Ireland up to that point.

The victory prompted uprisings all over the country, with the assistance of mercenaries in O'Neill's pay and contingents from Ulster, and it is at this point that the war developed in its full force. Hugh O'Neill appointed his supporters as chieftains and earls around the country, notably James Fitzthomas Fitzgerald as the [[Earl of Desmond]] and [[Florence MacCarthy]] as the [[MacCarthy Mór]]. In Munster as many as 9,000 men came out in rebellion. The [[Plantations of Ireland|Munster Plantation]], the colonisation of the province with English settlers, was dealt a serious blow; the colonists, among them [[Edmund Spenser]], fled for their lives.

Only a handful of native lords remained consistently loyal to the crown and even these found their kinsmen and followers defecting to the rebels. However all the fortified cities and towns of the country sided with the English colonial government. Hugh O'Neill, unable to take walled towns, made repeated overtures to inhabitants of [[the Pale]] to join his rebellion, appealing to their Catholicism and to their alienation from the Dublin government and the provincial administrations. For the most part, however, the [[Old English (Ireland)|Old English]] remained hostile to their hereditary Gaelic enemies.&lt;ref&gt;Colm Lennon, Sixteenth Century Ireland, The Incomplete Conquest, p322, "Despite the proclamations of O'Neill... there is little evidence that the townsfolk and Pale gentry were in sympathy with the Ulster chieftain's war, and in this they had the backing of leading Jesuits such as Father Richard Field SJ. Whatever about their common Catholicism, the links with the Spanish monarchy were strongly eschewed by the vast majority of those of Old English origin in Ireland."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Earl of Essex's command===
{{main|Essex in Ireland}}
In 1599, [[Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex]] arrived in Ireland with over 17,000&amp;nbsp;English troops. He took the advice of the Irish privy council, to settle the south of the country with garrisons before making an attempt on Ulster, but this dissipated his forces and he ended up suffering numerous setbacks on a desultory progress through south Leinster and Munster. He spent almost all of his time in Ireland awaiting transport that he had been promised before setting out, it being the only effective way of reaching his stated objective of Lough Foyle; however, a lack of administrative efficiency in England caused his plans to go awry and the requisite pack animals and ships were never sent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2281.1959.tb01621.x | volume=32 | title=The Earl of Essex and Ireland, 1599 | year=1959 | journal=Historical Research | pages=1–23 [21] | last1 = Henry | first1 = L. W.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Those expeditions he did organise were disastrous, especially an expedition crossing the Curlew mountains to [[Sligo]], which was mauled by O'Donnell at the [[Battle of Curlew Pass]]. Thousands of his troops, shut up in unsanitary garrisons, died of diseases such as [[typhoid]] and [[dysentery]].

When he did turn to Ulster, Essex entered a parley with O'Neill and agreed a truce that was heavily criticised by his enemies in London, despite Elizabeth's admission soon afterward that it was "so seasonably made...as great good...has grown by it."&lt;ref&gt;[Secretary Cecil to the lords justices of Ireland, 6 November 1599 (Cal. S.P.Ire., 1599-1600, p. 235).]&lt;/ref&gt; Anticipating a recall to England, he set out for London in 1599 without the Queen's permission, where he was executed after attempting a court [[putsch]]. He was succeeded in Ireland by [[Charles Blount, 1st Earl of Devon|Lord Mountjoy]], who proved to be a far more able commander, though his greater success could just as well have been because he was provided with all of the administrative support Essex lacked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2281.1959.tb01621.x | volume=32 | title=The Earl of Essex and Ireland, 1599 | year=1959 | journal=Historical Research | pages=1–23 [22] | last1 = Henry | first1 = L. W.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, two veterans of Irish warfare, [[George Carew, 1st Earl of Totnes|George Carew]] and [[Arthur Chichester]], were given commands in Munster and Ulster respectively.

In November 1599 O'Neill sent a 22-paragraph document to Queen Elizabeth, listing his terms for a peace agreement. These called for a self-governing Ireland with restitution of confiscated lands and churches, freedom of movement and a strong Roman Catholic identity. In respect of Irish sovereignty he now accepted English overlordship, but requested that the viceroy ".. be at least an [[earl]], and of the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|privy council of England]]". Elizabeth's adviser [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Sir Robert Cecil]] wrote "[[utopia|Ewtopia]]" on the document.&lt;ref&gt;Calendar of State Papers relating to Ireland, 1599–1600 (London 1899) 279–281.&lt;/ref&gt;

===End of the Rebellion in Munster===
George Carew, the English Lord President of Munster, managed more or less to quash the rebellion in Munster by mid-1601, using a mixture of conciliation and force. By the summer of 1601 he had retaken most of the principal castles in Munster and scattered the Irish forces. He did this by negotiating a pact with [[Florence MacCarthy]], the principal Gaelic Irish leader in the province, which allowed MacCarthy to be neutral, while Carew concentrated on attacking the force of James Fitzthomas Fitzgerald, who commanded the main rebel force. As a result, while MacCarthy resisted English raiding parties into his territory, he did not come to Fitzthomas's aid, despite urgings from O'Neill and O'Donnell to do this.&lt;ref name="theirishstory.com"&gt;http://www.theirishstory.com/2011/04/13/the-maccarthys-and-the-nine-years-war-in-munster-1595-1603/&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 1600, Carew launched an offensive against Fitzthomas's forces. The English routed Fitzthomas’ forces at Aherlow and in November, Carew reported to London that he had, over the summer, killed 1,200 'rebels' and taken the surrenders of over 10,000. Carew also weakened Florence MacCarthy's position by recruiting a rival MacCarthy chieftain, Donal, to English service.&lt;ref name="theirishstory.com"/&gt;

In June 1601, James Fitzthomas was captured by the English forces. Shortly afterwards, Carew had Florence MacCarthy arrested after summoning him for negotiations. Both Fitzthomas and MacCarthy were held captive in the [[Tower of London]], where both eventually died. Most of the rest of the local lords submitted, once the principal native leaders had been arrested. O'Neill's mercenaries had been expelled from the province.&lt;ref name="theirishstory.com"/&gt;

===Battle of Kinsale and the collapse of the rebellion===
[[File:Sir Charles Blount c 1594.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Charles Blount, 8th Baron Mountjoy, c. 1594]]
{{main|Siege of Kinsale}}
Mountjoy managed to penetrate the interior of Ulster by seaborne landings at [[Derry]] (then belonging to [[County Coleraine]]) under [[Henry Docwra, 1st Baron Docwra of Culmore|Henry Docwra]] and Carrickfergus under Arthur Chichester. Dowcra and Chichester, helped by [[Niall Garve O'Donnell]], a rival of Hugh Roe, devastated the countryside in an effort to provoke a famine and killed the civilian population at random.

Their military assumption was that without crops and people or cattle, the rebels could neither feed themselves nor raise new fighters.&lt;ref&gt;S.J.Connolly, Contested Island, Ireland 146-1630, p253 "Part of Mountjoy's strategy for wearing down Tyrone and the other rebel lords was a relentless assault on the peasantry who gave their power its economic base. As his men moved into Tyrone's territory, they systematically cut down standing corn, seized or burnt harvested crops and butchered or carried off livestock. They also killed anyone they came across".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lennon, 16th Century Ireland, p299,"His attritional methods included the establishment of provocative garrisons, campaigning in winter, and the winning over disaffected followers of the confederates"&lt;/ref&gt; This attrition quickly began to bite, and it also meant that the Ulster chiefs were tied down in Ulster to defend their own territories.

Although O'Neill managed to repulse another land offensive by Mountjoy at the [[Battle of Moyry Pass]] near [[Newry]] in 1600, his position was becoming desperate.

In 1601, the long promised Spanish expedition finally arrived in the form of 3,500 soldiers at [[Kinsale]], [[County Cork|Cork]], virtually the southern tip of Ireland. Mountjoy immediately besieged them with 7,000 men. O'Neill, O'Donnell and their allies marched their armies south to sandwich Mountjoy, whose men were starving and wracked by disease, between them and the Spaniards. During the march south, O'Neill devastated the lands of those who would not support him.

The English force might have been destroyed by hunger and sickness but the issue was decided in their favour at the [[Battle of Kinsale]]. On the 5/6 January 1602, O'Donnell, against the wishes and advice of O'Neill,{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://celt.ucc.ie/published/T100080.html|title=Beatha Aodha Ruaidh Uí Dhomhnaill|website=celt.ucc.ie|access-date=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; took the decision to attack the English. Forming up for a surprise attack, the Irish chiefs were themselves surprised by a cavalry charge, resulting in a rout of the Irish forces. The Spanish in Kinsale surrendered after their allies' defeat.

The Irish forces retreated north to Ulster to regroup and consolidate their position. The Ulstermen lost many more men in the retreat through freezing and flooded country than they had at the actual battle of Kinsale. The last rebel stronghold in the south was taken at the [[Siege of Dunboy]] by [[George Carew Totnes|George Carew]].

Hugh Roe O'Donnell left for Spain pleading in vain for another Spanish landing. He died in 1602 probably due to poisoning by an English agent. His brother assumed leadership of the O'Donnell clan. Both he and Hugh O'Neill were reduced to guerrilla tactics, fighting in small bands, as Mountjoy, Dowcra, Chichester and Niall Garbh O'Donnell swept the countryside. The English scorched earth tactics were especially harsh on the civilian population, who died in great numbers both from direct targeting and from famine.&lt;ref&gt;Lennon, p301, "Mountjoy aimed at the abject submission of O'Neill in the field. Tyrone itself was constricted by the spoiling tactics of the Lord Deputy...with famine conditions resulting in the winter of 1602–1603&lt;/ref&gt;

===End of the War===
In 1602 O'Neill [[Burning of Dungannon|destroyed his capital at Dungannon]] due to the approach of Mountjoy's forces, and withdrew to hide in the woods. In a symbolic gesture Mountjoy smashed the O'Neills' inauguration stone at [[Tullyhogue Fort|Tullaghogue]]. [[Famine]] soon hit Ulster as a result of the English scorched earth strategy. O'Neill's uirithe or sub-lords (O'Hagan, O'Quinn, MacCann) began to surrender and [[Rory O'Donnell, 1st Earl of Tyrconnell|Rory O'Donnell]], Hugh Roe's brother and successor, surrendered on terms at the end of 1602. However, with a secure base in the large and dense forests of [[Tir Eoghain]], O'Neill held out until 30 March 1603, when he surrendered on good terms to Mountjoy, signing the [[Treaty of Mellifont]]. [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] had died on 24 March.

Although the war had effectively ended with the signing of the Treaty of Mellifont, its final battles were fought during the English invasion of [[West Breifne]] in April 1603, which remained the sole holdout Irish kingdom following O'Neill's capitulation. The kingdom was ruled by [[Brian Oge O'Rourke|Brian Óg O'Rourke]], one of the alliance's chief lieutenants and leader of the Irish forces during the [[Battle of Curlew Pass]]. He failed to secure any concessions from the treaty as his half-brother [[Teigue O'Rourke|Tadhg O'Rourke]] had fought with the English during the war and was granted lordship of West Breifne in return. Following a twelve-day siege, a force of 3,000 men led by Tadhg, [[Henry Folliott, 1st Baron Folliott|Henry Folliott]] and [[Rory O'Donnell, 1st Earl of Tyrconnell|Rory O'Donnell]] eventually brought the area, and thus all of Ireland, under English control on 25 April 1603.

==Aftermath==
The leaders of the rebellion received good terms from the new King of England, [[James I of England|James I]], in the hope of ensuring a final end of the draining war that had brought England close to bankruptcy. O'Neill, O'Donnell and the other surviving Ulster chiefs were granted full pardons and the return of their estates.  The stipulations were that they abandon their Irish titles, their private armies, and their control over their dependents, and that they swear loyalty only to the Crown of England.  In 1604, Mountjoy declared an amnesty for rebels all over the country.  The reason for this apparent mildness was that the English could not afford to continue the war any longer. Elizabethan England did not have a standing army, nor could it force its Parliament to pass enough taxation to pay for long wars. Moreover, it was already involved in a war in the [[Spanish Netherlands]]. As it was, the war in Ireland (which cost over £2 million) came very close to [[National bankruptcy|bankrupting]] the English exchequer by its close in 1603.

Irish sources claimed that as many as 60,000 people had died in the Ulster famine of 1602–3 alone. This is likely to be a major overestimate, as in 1600 the total adult population of Ulster has been estimated at only 25,000 to 40,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;M. Perceval-Maxwell: ''The Scottish Migration to Ulster in the Reign of James 1.'' Belfast, Ulster Historical Foundation. 1999. Page 17.&lt;/ref&gt; An Irish death toll of over 100,000 is possible. At least 30,000 English soldiers died in Ireland in the Nine Years' War, mainly from disease. So the total death toll for the war was certainly at least 100,000 people, and probably more.

Although O'Neill and his allies received good terms at the end of the war, they were never trusted by the English authorities and the distrust was mutual. O'Neill, O'Donnell and the other Gaelic lords from Ulster left Ireland in 1607 in what is known as the "[[Flight of the Earls]]". They intended to organise an expedition from a Catholic power in Europe, preferably Spain, to restart the war but were unable to find any military backers.

Spain had signed the [[Treaty of London (1604)|Treaty of London]] in August 1604 with the new [[Stuart dynasty]] and did not wish to reopen hostilities. Further, a Spanish fleet had just been destroyed by a [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] fleet in the [[Battle of Gibraltar (1607)|Battle of Gibraltar]] in April 1607. In 1608 Sir [[Cahir O'Doherty]], who had previously fought on the Crown's side against Tyrone, launched [[O'Doherty's Rebellion]] when he [[Burning of Derry|attacked and burnt Derry]]. O'Doherty was defeated and killed at the [[Battle of Kilmacrennan]] and the rebellion quickly collapsed.

In 1608 the absent earls' lands were confiscated for trying to start another war, and were soon colonised in the [[Plantation of Ulster]]. The Nine Years' War was therefore an important step in the English and Scottish colonisation of Ulster.

The '''Ohio State Fair''' is one of the largest [[State fair|State Fair]]s in the [[United States]]. The event is held in [[Columbus, Ohio]] during late July through early August. As estimated in a 2011 economic impact study conducted by Saperstein &amp; Associates; the State Fair contributes approximately 68.5 million [[United States dollar|dollars]] to the state's economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2013/07/21/gird-your-arteries-its-fair-time.html | title = Gird your arteries: It’s Ohio State Fair time | accessdate = 2015-09-18 | date = 2015-07-21 | work = Columbus Dispatch}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, attendance was 982,305, the Fair's highest 12-day attendance on record.&lt;ref name='attendance' /&gt;

From the very first three-day Fair in 1850 in [[Cincinnati, Ohio|Cincinnati]] to the 12-day exposition of today (from 1981-2003, the Fair lasted 17 days), the Ohio State Fair has celebrated Ohio's products, its people, and their accomplishments. The Fair vast programme offers concerts, sports competitions, exhibitions, horse show, numerous rides, and lots of food stalls&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rove.me/to/midwest/ohio-state-fair|title=Ohio State Fair|publisher=rove.me}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The concert series lineup is usually announced in late February or early March&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tripsavvy.com/experience-the-ohio-state-fair-798932|title=Experience the Ohio State Fair|publisher=TripSavvy}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==History==
In 1846, the [[Ohio General Assembly|Ohio Legislature]] created the 53-member [[Ohio Department of Agriculture|Ohio State Board of Agriculture]].  One of the Board's first acts was to establish a District Fair. The resulting 1847 District Fair at [[Wilmington, Ohio]] and the 1848 District Fair at [[Xenia, Ohio]] were both successful, leading to the planning of a State Fair.

The first Ohio State Fair was planned for September 1849, but an outbreak of [[Cholera|Asiatic cholera]] forced cancellation of those plans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3IJtVP9WnXEC&amp;lpg=PA304&amp;dq=Morrow%20Ohio&amp;pg=PA300#v=onepage&amp;q=Morrow%20Ohio&amp;f=false | title=This Day in Ohio History | publisher=Emmis Books | date=2005 | accessdate=21 November 2013 | author=Goodman, Rebecca | pages=300}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, autumn dates were chosen to lessen the risk of cholera.  Even so, the superintendent of grounds, Darius Lapham, died of the disease just a few weeks before the opening date. &lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ohiostatefair.com/memory-wall/ | title = Our History | accessdate = 2017-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Camp Washington, Cincinnati]] (two miles north of downtown [[Cincinnati, Ohio]]) was the site for the first Ohio State Fair, October 2–4, 1850.  The site was described as 8–10 acres with grassy slopes, shade trees, and numerous tents. The grounds were enclosed by a {{convert|10|ft|m|sing=on}}-high board fence.  Cattle were tethered to a railing along the carriage road. &lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

The railroads offered strong support to the early State Fairs.  Special rates were offered whereby exhibits were transported without charge, and the exhibitor rode for half fare.  Several Central Ohioans contributed to the support of the first Fair, including [[Alfred Kelley]], owner of the [[Columbus and Xenia Railroad]].&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

Cash premiums at the first Fair did not exceed $20, with the exception of an award of $50 given to essayists on the topic "Improving the Soil." {{citation needed|date=July 2012}} During the early State Fairs, winners received medals, not ribbons, as awards. In 1850, the silver medal was valued at $3.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

The public was admitted only on the second and third day of the first Fair.  Day one was devoted to setting up and judging.  Admission was twenty cents, but exhibitors could buy a $1 badge for admission of their families.  A visitor could also buy a $1 badge, which admitted one gentleman and two ladies.  The two-day attendance was estimated at 25,000 to 30,000 people.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

Transportation around Ohio was difficult.  Therefore, the majority of exhibitors came from close proximity to the Fair.  Officials reasoned that moving the Fair ought to increase interest and attendance.

Over the next 22 years, the Fair was held in the following cities: &lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

From 1874 until 1885, the site of Columbus' Franklin Park served as home to the Ohio State Fair.  Finally, in 1886, the Fair moved to its current location to what is currently called the Ohio Expo Center and State Fairgrounds.  The main entrance to the site was at the southwest corner of the grounds along Woodard Avenue.  It is now along 11th Avenue.

=== 2017 ride accident ===
On July 26, 2017, the opening day of the 2017 Fair, a [[Frisbee (ride)|swinging ride]] known as Fire Ball broke apart mid-swing, flinging passengers out of the ride. One rider, 18-year-old Tyler Jarrell, was flung {{convert|50|feet|m}} and killed on impact. Seven other riders were seriously injured, two of whom were reported to be in critical condition. The ride had been inspected earlier in the day and cleared for operation. The [[Ohio Department of Agriculture]] and [[Ohio State Highway Patrol]] have begun an investigation into the incident, and the Fair announced that it would not operate any rides on July 27 until they are all re-inspected by state authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/entry/ohio-state-fair-ride-malfunction_us_59793d21e4b02a8434b3d691|title=1 Dead, 7 Injured When Fire Ball Ride Flies Apart At Ohio State Fair|date=2017-07-26|work=HuffPost|access-date=2017-07-27|language=en-CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.wcpo.com/news/state/state-ohio/ohio-state-fair-ride-video-video-shows-moment-fire-ball-ride-broke-mid-swing-killing-1|title=Ohio State Fair ride video: Video shows moment Fire Ball ride broke mid-swing, killing 1|date=2017-07-27|work=[[WCPO-TV|WCPO.com]]|publisher=[[E.

'''Pierre Brassau''' was a [[chimpanzee]] and the subject of a 1964 [[hoax]] perpetrated by Åke "Dacke" Axelsson, a journalist at the Swedish [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] ''[[Göteborgs-Tidningen]]''. Axelsson came up with the idea of exhibiting a series of paintings made by a non-human [[primate]], under the pretense that they were the work of a previously unknown human French artist named "Pierre Brassau", in order to test whether [[critic]]s could tell the difference between true [[avant-garde]] [[modern art]] and the work of a [[chimpanzee]].&lt;ref name=museum&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hoaxes.org/archive/permalink/pierre_brassau_monkey_artist/ |title=Pierre Brassau, Monkey Artist |publisher=The Museum of Hoaxes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Pierre Brassau" was in fact a four-year-old [[common chimpanzee]] named Peter from Sweden's [[Borås Djurpark]] zoo.&lt;ref name="TIME"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,870835,00.html | title=Zoo Story | journal=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=February 1964 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Axelsson had persuaded Peter's 17-year-old keeper to give the chimpanzee a brush and paint. After Peter had created several paintings, Axelsson chose the best four and arranged to have them exhibited at the Gallerie Christinae in [[Gothenburg|Göteborg, Sweden]].&lt;ref name=museum/&gt; While one critic observed that "only an ape could have done this", most praised the works.&lt;ref name=museum /&gt; Rolf Anderberg of the ''[[Göteborgs-Posten]]'' wrote, "Brassau paints with powerful strokes, but also with clear determination. His brush strokes twist with furious fastidiousness. Pierre is an artist who performs with the delicacy of a ballet dancer."&lt;ref name=museum /&gt;&lt;ref name="ecc"&gt;{{cite web|title=Avantgarde artist Pierre Brassau|url=http://ecclesiastes911.net/story/pierre_brassau.html|publisher=ecclesiastes911.net|accessdate=27 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lemarquis"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lemarquis|first1=Pierre|title=Portrait du cerveau en artiste|date=2012|publisher=Odile Jacob|location=Paris|isbn=978-2-7381-7850-3|page=69|url=https://books.google.pl/books?id=aaHWFdhhHoAC&amp;pg=PA290|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the hoax was revealed, Rolf Anderberg insisted that Peter's work was "still the best painting in the exhibition". A private collector bought one of the works for [[US$]]90 ({{Inflation|fmt=eq|cursign=$|US|90|1964}}).&lt;ref name=museum/&gt;&lt;ref name=ecc /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lemarquis" /&gt;

In 1969 Peter was transferred to the [[Chester Zoo]] in England.&lt;ref name=museum/&gt;

==Arrests==
On 23 March 2012: Seven of 17 people have been arrested as a result of an operation by the Ankara Chief Public Prosecutor of the Special Authority against RedHack. The group claimed in a statement that those arrested had no ties with the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bianet.org/bianet/bianet/137088-redhack-orgutunden-yedi-tutuklama |title=RedHack "Örgütünden" Yedi Tutuklama |publisher=bianet |date= |accessdate=2014-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 July 2012: The public prosecutor made an application to evaluate RedHack as a "armed separatist terrorist organization".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radikal.com.tr/turkiye/redhack_resmen_teror_orgutu_ilan_edildi-1093352 |title=Redhack resmen terör örgütü ilan edildi - Türkiye Haberleri |publisher=Radikal |date= |accessdate=2014-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 October 2012: The application from 5 July was accepted and the public prosecutor has requested a penalty of about 8.5 to 24 years for alleged members. There were still 3 students in detention after four of seven arrested people were released. The case was postponed to 26 November 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radikal.com.tr/turkiye/savci_e_devlete_saldiri_da_terordur-1103345 |title=Savcı: E-devlet'e saldırı da terördür - Türkiye Haberleri |publisher=Radikal |date= |accessdate=2014-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 November 2012: Three students accused of being a member of the group were released. The court postponed the case to 26 February 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haberturk.com/gundem/haber/797773-redhack-davasinda-karar |title=RedHack üyesi olduğu iddiasıyla tutuklan ve 24 yıl hapis cezası-En Son Güvenlik Haberleri-HABERTÜRK |publisher=Haberturk.com |date=2012-11-26 |accessdate=2014-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 February 2013: The court decided to postpone the case to 3 June 2013. Reason for this was that the chief justice was still searching for "experts which are needed for the IT part of the case".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/gundem/22686027.asp |title=Bilirkişi bulamadılar - Hürriyet GÜNDEM |publisher=Hurriyet.com.tr |date=2013-02-26 |accessdate=2014-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 May 2013: The Ankara Deputy Attorney General stated under the Anti-Terrorism Act that the actions of RedHack "did not involve violence" and with the lack of jurisdiction the Attorney General passed the case to the Cyber Crimes Investigation Unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/gundem/23242468.asp |title=Savcılık: "RedHack terör örgütü değil" - Hürriyet GÜNDEM |publisher=Hurriyet.com.tr |date= |accessdate=2014-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 May 2013: After the group's leaking of classified documents which proved the Turkish government's carelessness of the Reyhanli bombings on 11 May, Private Utku Kali, who was serving at that time at the Amasya Commands, was arrested. After Kali denied being a member of the hacktivist group and leaking the documents, he was released.

'''Rock the Universe''' is an annual [[Christian rock festival]] that takes place at [[Universal Studios Florida]]. It started in 1998, and it used to take place in September. Since 2019, the festival is celebrated on the first weekend of February.

The festival has had three stages over the years. The main one is located on the entrance for the Rip, Ride, and Rock It roller coaster. The ''Hollywood Stage'' is by the Central Park area and the lake, close to the middle of the park. ''Praise and Worship Stage'' is located in the Animal Planet Theater.

The '''Royal Caledonian Ball''' is a [[Ball (dance party)|ball]] held annually in London for the benefit of Scottish charities. With few exceptions, the Royal Caledonian Ball has been held annually since 1849, and is the oldest charity ball in the world.&lt;ref name="scotsman"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ross|first1=Peter|title=The Royal Caledonian Ball keeps it reel in London|url=http://www.scotsman.com/what-s-on/theatre-comedy-dance/the-royal-caledonian-ball-keeps-it-reel-in-london-1-2926441|accessdate=1 April 2015|work=[[The Scotsman]]|date=12 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered the highlight of the [[Season (society)|London season]].&lt;ref name="scotsman2"&gt;{{cite news|title=Plenty of space to swing your sporran|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/plenty-of-space-to-swing-your-sporran-1-532354|accessdate=1 April 2015|work=[[The Scotsman]]|date=23 May 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The ball dates to the 1840s, when [[George Murray, 6th Duke of Atholl|George, Duke of Atholl]] and his wife [[Anne Murray, Duchess of Atholl|Anne]] wanted to entertain their Scottish friends residing in London.&lt;ref name="clarkmcginn"&gt;Clark McGinn, ''The Ultimate Guide to Being Scottish: Put Your First Foot Forward'', Luath Press, 2014, p. 245 [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=e7JD-WoRojoC&amp;pg=PA245&amp;dq=%22Royal+Caledonian+Ball%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Hg3RVIO2Jov8ywPjlYFo&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Royal%20Caledonian%20Ball%22&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; By 1849, it had become a fundraiser for Scottish charities helping vulnerable schoolchildren, the homeless, and cancer patients.&lt;ref name="clarkmcginn"/&gt;

The Royal Caledonian Ball has been held every year, except during the [[Second Boer War|Boer War]], [[World War I]] and [[World War II]], and following the death of King [[Edward VII]] on 6 May 1910.

The ball has been under the royal patronage since Edward VII. Since the 1930s, the event has been held at the [[Grosvenor House Hotel]] on [[Park Lane, London]].&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.royalcaledonianball.com/history/|publisher=Royal Caledonian Ball|accessdate=1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Queen is often in attendance.&lt;ref name="glasgowherald"/&gt;

In recent years, the ball has been featured in the ''Bystander'' section of ''[[Tatler]]''.&lt;ref name="bystanderjuly2008"&gt;[http://www.tatler.com/bystander/events/2008/july/the-royal-caledonian-ball#!/2099/image/1 Bystander: Mayfair: Royal Caledonian Ball], ''[[Tatler]]'', 1 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bystanderjune2009"&gt;[http://www.tatler.com/bystander/events/2009/june/the-royal-caledonian-ball#!/2032/image/1 Bystander: Mayfair: Royal Caledonian Ball], ''[[Tatler]]'', 1 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bystanderjune2010"&gt;[http://www.tatler.com/bystander/events/2010/june/the-royal-caledonian-ball#!/1923/image/1 Bystander: Mayfair: Royal Caledonian Ball], ''[[Tatler]]'', 1 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bystanderjune2012"&gt;[http://www.tatler.com/bystander/events/2012/june/the-royal-caledonian-ball#!/7427/image/1 Bystander: Mayfair: Royal Caledonian Ball], ''[[Tatler]]'', 8 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bystanderjuly2013"&gt;[http://www.tatler.com/bystander/events/2013/july/royal-caledonian-ball#!/11431/image/1 Bystander: Mayfair: Royal Caledonian Ball], '''''Tatler''''', 16 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bystanderjuly2014"&gt;[http://www.tatler.com/bystander/events/2014/july/the-caledonian-ball#!/14824/image/1 Bystander: Mayfair: The Caledonian Ball], ''[[Tatler]]'', 22 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="futureofscotland"&gt;Sophia Money-Coutts, [http://www.tatler.com/news/articles/september-2014/the-future-of-scotland The Future of Scotland?], ''[[Tatler]]'', 8 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dance and dress==
The Royal Caledonian Ball [[dress code]] stipulates that male attendees wear [[Highland dress#Highland formal wear|Highland evening dress]], evening tails with [[white tie]], or [[mess dress]]. Women should wear floor-length evening dress or mess dress; [[tartan]] sashes are encouraged.&lt;ref name="scotsman"/&gt;

The event is known for its [[Scottish country dance|Scottish country dancing]], and it is traditional for ball attendees to dance every [[Reel (dance)|reel]]:&lt;ref name="scotsman2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Reels|url=http://www.royalcaledonianball.com/reels/|publisher=Royal Caledonian Ball|accessdate=1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, the [[Duke of Atholl|Duke]] and Duchess of Atholl are the first couple to start the dance, followed by his private army, the [[Atholl Highlanders]].&lt;ref name="glasgowherald"&gt;'Royal Caledonian Ball: Regimental Reels for Reels', ''[[The Glasgow Herald]]'', 22 April 1963 [https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&amp;dat=19630422&amp;id=smxAAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=kaMMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3705,3542537]&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, men wore full evening [[tartan]] while women were dressed in while, with a tartan sash.&lt;ref name="angela"&gt;Angela Lambert, ''1939: The Last Season of Peace'', [[A &amp; C Black]], 2011 [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=q8GZ2yUhvQQC&amp;pg=PT98&amp;dq=%22Royal+Caledonian+Ball%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Hg3RVIO2Jov8ywPjlYFo&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Royal%20Caledonian%20Ball%22&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, it was the only socially acceptable opportunity to wear full tartan outside Scotland.&lt;ref name="angela"/&gt;

==Charities==
The ball supports numerous charities in Scotland and has raised an estimated £3 million since its inception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=London’s Royal Caledonian Ball supports small Scottish charities|url=http://www.theedinburghreporter.co.uk/2013/11/londons-royal-caledonian-ball-supports-small-scottish-charities/|accessdate=1 April 2015|work=The Edinburgh Reporter|date=14 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the charities the ball supports are [[Queen Victoria School]] in [[Dunblane]], [[Erskine (charity)|Erskine Hospital]], and St Catherine’s Homeless Project in [[Edinburgh]].&lt;ref name="scotsman2"/&gt;

[[File:Roosevelt Inönü and Churchill in Cairo cph.3b15312.jpg|thumb|240px|[[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]], [[Ismet Inönü|İnönü]] and [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]] at the Second Cairo Conference, which was held between December 4–6, 1943.]]

The '''Second Cairo Conference''' of December 4–6, 1943, held in [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]], addressed [[Turkey]]'s possible contribution to the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] in [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=Matloff&gt;[http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/sp1943-44/chapter16.htm U.S. Army: "Strategic Planning for Coalition Warfare, 1943-1944" by Maurice Matloff, Chapter XVI, pp. 379-380.] Center of Military History, United States Army, Washington D.C., 1990. Library of Congress Catalog Card Number 53-61477. First Printed 1959-CMH Pub 1-4.&lt;/ref&gt; The meeting was attended by President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] of the [[United States]], Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] of the [[United Kingdom]], and President [[İsmet İnönü]] of the [[Turkey|Republic of Turkey]].&lt;ref name=Matloff/&gt;

Until 1941, both Roosevelt and Churchill maintained the opinion that Turkey's continuing neutrality would serve the interests of the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] by blocking the [[Axis powers of World War II|Axis]] from reaching the strategic oil reserves of the [[Middle East]]. But the early victories of the Axis until the end of 1942 caused Roosevelt and Churchill to re-evaluate a possible Turkish participation in the war on the side of the Allies.&lt;ref name=Matloff/&gt; Turkey had maintained a decently-sized Army and Air Force throughout the war, and especially Churchill wanted the Turks to open a new front in the [[Balkans]].&lt;ref name=Matloff/&gt; On January 30, 1943, Churchill had secretly met with İnönü inside a train wagon at the Yenice Station, 23 kilometers outside of [[Adana]] in [[Turkey]], to discuss the issue (see the [[Adana Conference]].)&lt;ref name=Matloff/&gt;

Roosevelt, on the other hand, still believed that a Turkish attack would be too risky and an eventual Turkish failure would have disastrous effects for the Allies.&lt;ref name=Matloff/&gt;

İnönü knew very well the hardships which his country had to suffer during 11 years of incessant war (the [[Italo-Turkish War]], the [[Balkan Wars]], the [[World War I|First World War]], and the [[Turkish War of Independence]]) between 1911 and 1922, and was determined to keep Turkey out of another war as long as he could. İnönü also wanted assurances on financial and military aid for Turkey, as well as a guarantee that the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]] would stand beside Turkey in case of a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] invasion of the [[Turkish Straits]] after the war, as [[Joseph Stalin]] had openly expressed.&lt;ref name=Matloff/&gt; The fear of a Soviet invasion and Stalin's unconcealed desire to control the [[Turkish Straits]] eventually caused Turkey to give up its principle of [[neutrality (international relations)|neutrality in foreign relations]] and join [[NATO]] in 1952.

[[File:Second Cairo Conference.jpg|thumb|240px|Roosevelt and İnönü got what they wanted, while Churchill was a bit disappointed of the result.]]

Perhaps the biggest reason for Turkey's hesitation to immediately join the war on the side of the Allies was the eventual reduction of the amount of financial and military aid which Churchill had promised in Adana.&lt;ref name=Matloff/&gt; By December 1943 the Anglo-American authorities felt the overall situation had changed so fundamentally that a much smaller scale of assistance than that provided in the Hardihood Agreement of the spring of 1943 would be necessary.&lt;ref name=Matloff/&gt; The British proposed a reduced scale of Aid Plan Saturn.&lt;ref name=Matloff/&gt; The Turks, on the other hand, wished to make certain that upon their entry into the war they would be strong enough to defend their homeland and they doubted that the new plan would fully meet their security needs.&lt;ref name=Matloff/&gt; Churchill, faced with [[Operation Overlord]] only six months away, reluctantly concluded that the resources demanded and the time required for strengthening Turkey could not be conceded.&lt;ref name=Matloff/&gt; The U.S. Chiefs of Staff and their planners, on the other hand, felt relieved that this possible threat to concentration on Operation Overlord had at last been removed.&lt;ref name=Matloff/&gt;

At the end of the conference, it was decided that Turkey's neutrality should be maintained.&lt;ref name=Matloff/&gt; It was also decided to build the [[Incirlik Air Base]] near Adana for possible [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] air operations in the region, but construction works began after the end of the Second World War.&lt;ref name=Matloff/&gt; Incirlik Air Base later played an important role for [[NATO]] during the [[Cold War]]. Another decision was to postpone Operation Anakim against [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] in [[Burma]].&lt;ref name=Matloff/&gt;

Both Roosevelt and İnönü got what they wanted, while Churchill was a bit disappointed, because he believed that an active Turkish participation in the war would quicken the German defeat by hitting their ''"soft underbelly"'' in the southeast.

Turkey eventually joined the war on the side of the Allies on 23 February 1945, after it was announced at the [[Yalta Conference]] that only the states which were formally at war with [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] and [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] by 1 March 1945 would be admitted to the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;Mustafa Aydın, SAM, "Turkish Foreign Policy: Framework and Analysis", Center for Strategic Research, 2004, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Turkey didn't directly participate in a military conflict; limiting its participation to providing materials and supplies for the Allies, and imposing political and economic sanctions on the Axis states.

'''Snarf''' is a term used by computer programmers meaning to grab a large document, file, content, or data, and use it without the author (owner)'s permission. In the [[UNIX]] community the term means the acquisition of a file or set of files across a network. It also refers to using [[command line]] tools to transfer files through the [[HTTP]], [[Gopher (protocol)|gopher]], [[Finger protocol|finger]], and [[FTP]] protocols without user interaction, and to a method of achieving [[cache coherence]] in a [[multiprocessing]] computer architecture through observation of writes to cached data.

An example of a snarf is the [[Evil twin (wireless networks)|Evil twin attack]], using a simple shell script running software like AirSnarf&lt;ref name="shmoo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://airsnarf.shmoo.com|title='Airsnarf' - A rogue AP setup utility |accessdate=2012-11-03 |author=Potter, Bruce G. |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=1996-10-16  | |website=The Shmoo Group |pages=1 |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote=Airsnarf is a simple rogue wireless access point setup utility designed to demonstrate how a rogue AP can steal usernames and passwords from public wireless hotspots.

Wireless clients that associate to a snarf access point will receive an IP, DNS, and gateway and appear completely normal. Users will have all of their DNS queries resolve to the attacker's [[IP number]], regardless of their DNS settings, so any website they attempt to visit will bring up a snarf "splash page", requesting a username and password. The username and password entered by unsuspecting users will be mailed to root@localhost. The reason this works is:
#Legitimate access points can be impersonated and/or drowned out by rogue access points, and
#Users without a means to validate the authenticity of access points will nevertheless give up their hotspot credentials when asked for them

A '''story paper''' is a periodical [[publication]] similar to a literary magazine, but featuring illustrations and text stories, and aimed towards children and teenagers. Also known in Britain as "boys' weeklies", story papers were phenomenally popular before the outbreak of the [[Second World War]].

Among the most well-known British story paper was ''[[Boy's Own Paper]]'', which ran from 1879 to 1967.

==Beginnings==
The first known edition of what would later become known as a "story paper" was ''The Young Gentleman's Magazine'', published in 1777. The first story paper to really take off was ''The Boys' and Girls' Penny Magazine'', first published in September 1832.

In 1866, Charles Stephens began selling ''Boys of England'' on the English streets for a penny—the first "[[penny dreadful]]". Story papers in this style minimized the expense of writing in order to produce an extremely cheap product. Strictly speaking, the "penny dreadful" died off by the turn of the century, but this term was still used to refer to story papers throughout their history. The ''[[Halfpenny Marvel]]'', first published in 1893, was "founded to counteract the pernicious influences of the Penny Dreadfuls", according to its title page. A book about these weeklies (also called "bloods" because of their savage contents) was created in 1948 by [[E. S. Turner]], called ''Boys Will be Boys''.

==Golden Age==
[[Image:The Boy's Own Paper, front page, 11 April 1891.jpg|thumb|250px|''The Boy's Own Paper'', front page, 11 April 1891]]
Denis Gifford designated the period between [[World War I]] and [[World War II]] as the "Golden Age" of story papers. Sales of the story papers were at their highest during these years, as were the fecundity of the authors, the range in genre of magazines, and the colourful variety of the heroes. The most famous story paper hero, [[Sexton Blake]], reached his apex during these years.

World War II caused chaos in Britain, and among other things the story papers had to be shut down as funds were redirected to the war. This is known as the ''Dark Ages'' for story papers, and nearly all of the papers ceased printing in 1939 or 1940.

==Silver Age and modern comics==
In the 1950s and 1960s, some story papers such as the ''Rover'' briefly flourished, but television had a growing influence on the attentions of British children. Mergers between publishing houses finished off the remaining story papers, or modified them to become comic books, in the 1970s. Rover was the last survivor and ceased publishing in 1973.&lt;ref name=Kibble-White20&gt;{{cite book |last=Kibble-White |first=Graham |year=2005 |title=The Ultimate Book of British Comics 70 years of mischief, mayhem and cow pies |publisher=Allison &amp; Busby limited |isbn=0749082119 |page=20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format and politics==
[[George Orwell]]'s essay, ''[[Boys' Weeklies]]'', outlines the general themes of the story paper in the "Golden Age". As far as Orwell could tell, Britain was the only country in Europe in which story papers were produced. ''[[The Gem]]'' and ''[[The Magnet]]'', the oldest of their kind, featured school serials always centred on a group of characters any reader could identify with. More recent story papers focused on adventure and intrigue, and had a large teenage readership. 

According to Orwell, all of the English papers published at the time were stuck in the 1910s and had an underlying conservative slant, which taught children to be deferential to the upper-class. He suggested socialist values could be just as exciting if they followed the story paper format.

There were story papers for children of both sexes, although there was a broad overlap in the actual readership of the two.

The '''Tanglewood Symposium''' was a conference that took place from July 23 to August 2, 1967, in [[Lenox, MA|Tanglewood, Massachusetts]]. It was sponsored by the [[MENC: The National Association for Music Education|Music Educators National Conference]] (MENC) in cooperation with the [[Berkshire Music Center]], the [[Theodore Presser Foundation]], and the School of Fine and Applied Arts of [[Boston University]]. The purpose was to discuss and define the role of [[music education]] in contemporary American society and to make recommendations to improve the effectiveness of music instruction. Participants included [[sociologist]]s, scientists, [[labor leader]]s, [[educators]], representatives of corporations, musicians, and people involved with other aspects of music.

==The Symposium==
Position papers had been published in the March and April 1967 issues of the ''Music Educators Journal''. The papers served as the bases for discussion at the 1967 MENC divisional conferences and for the Tanglewood Symposium. The sessions were moderated by Max Kaplan, [[Wiley Lee Housewright]] (1913–2003), Allen P. Britton, [[David P. McAllester]], and Karl D. Ernst. Three broad questions were considered:
* What are the characteristics and desirable ideologies for an emerging and [[postindustrial society]]?
* What are the values and unique functions of music and other arts for individuals and communities in such a society?
* How may these potentials be attained?

==The Tanglewood Declaration==
The Tanglewood Symposium is summarized in the statement entitled "The Tanglewood Declaration," which provided a philosophical basis for future developments in music education. Of particular importance, the Declaration called for music to be placed in the core of the school curriculum.

*a.	Music serves best when its integrity as an art is maintained.
*b.	Music of all periods, styles, forms, and cultures belongs in the curriculum. The musical repertory should be expanded to involve music of our time in its rich variety, including currently popular teenage music and avant-garde music, American folk music, and the music of other cultures.
*c.	Schools and colleges should provide adequate time for music programs ranging from pre-school through adult or continuing education.
*d.	Instruction in the arts should be a general and important part of education in the senior high school.
*e.	Developments in educational technology, educational television, programmed instruction, and computer-assisted instruction should be applied to music study and research.
*f.	Greater emphasis should be placed on helping the individual student to fulfill his needs, goals, and potentials.
*g.	The music education profession must contribute its skills, proficiencies, and insights toward assisting in the solution of urgent social problems as in the "inner city" or other areas with culturally deprived individuals.
*h.	Programs of teacher education must be expanded and improved to provide music teachers who are specially equipped to teach high school courses in the history and literature of music, courses in the humanities and related arts, as well as teachers equipped to work with the very young, with adults, with the disadvantaged, and with the emotionally disturbed.&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to Music Education, 3rd Edition, Hoffer, Charles R.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Technical Service Council''' was set up to combat the "[[brain drain]]" of Canadian engineers to the [[United States]], when over 20% of the graduating classes were emigrating.  [[Ireland]], [[India]], [[New Zealand]] and even [[Switzerland]] have had similar problems.

In 1927, Canadian industry financed the Council, whose directors concluded that a non-profit employment service that was free to graduates might minimize emigration.  The service survived the Depression, played a part in recruiting scientists and engineers for war work, pioneered outplacement and expanded to include other professional occupations.  It financed major studies of the supply of and demand for engineers and offered free-job-hunting courses to professionals.

Although started in [[Toronto]], the Council eventually had offices in [[Montreal]], [[Winnipeg]], [[Calgary]], [[Edmonton]] and [[Vancouver]] before becoming bankrupt in 1994.  It may have reduced the brain drain during its first 20 or 25 years, but it's not possible to judge its later record.

== History ==

=== Beginning ===

In the 1920s over 20% of Canadian engineering graduates emigrated to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Personal letter from Robert A. Bryce to Neil A. Macdougall, May 19, 1955.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TSC&gt;Annual Report, Technical Service Council/Le Conseil de Placement Professionnel, Toronto, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, jobs in the U.S. were both much more numerous and more varied than in Canada.  Meanwhile, the number of graduates soared, Canadian employers were unconvinced of the value of engineering degrees and new graduates complained of the lack of jobs.

Robert A. Bryce, president of Macassa Mines Ltd. and Prof. [[H.E.T. Haultain]] of the [[University of Toronto]] resolved to act. In April 1927 they and Rev.Canon H.J. Cody, chairman of the board of governors of the University of Toronto, invited the chief executives of major firms to a dinner at the National Club in Toronto.  After hearing how the loss of talent could hamper industry, each of the 12 executives promised $1,000 to fund a non-profit organization to combat the "brain drain". The brain drain, the selling of science to employers and Canadian nationalism were tightly intertwined ideas.  The firm was called the Technical Service Council.&lt;ref name=Enros&gt;Enros, Philip C., "The  Technical Service Council's Origins: A 'Patriotic Experiment' in Selling Engineers", Journal of Canadian Studies, Vol. 24, No. 4 1989-90 Winter, {{ISSN|0021-9495}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rolsa Eric Smythe was hired to run the Council. Appropriately, he was a Canadian engineer who had been working in Detroit. (3)

After a study of placement operations in other countries and consultation with employers, the directors decided that engineers would not respond to urges to stay in Canada.  Instead the Technical Service Council would find jobs for them by operating a free (to graduates) placement service.&lt;ref name=TSC/&gt; Employers would be invited to donate to the service, although later some companies used the service without contributing.

=== Objectives ===

The objectives were: To retain for Canada young Canadians educated along technical and scientific lines; to bring graduates of universities and technical institutions into practical contact with Canadian industry; to submit to universities the recommendations of industry concerning scientific courses and to aid industry in technical and scientific employment problems.&lt;ref name=TSC1952&gt;Technical Service Council pamphlet, circa 1952.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early operations ===

A small office was opened in Toronto in 1928 with $30,000 "seed money" from 30 firms to finance a three-year experiment.&lt;ref name=PR1954&gt;Progress Report 1954, Technical Service Council pamphlet.&lt;/ref&gt; Between July and December, 159 job hunters registered, 185 jobs were listed by employers and 81 engineers were placed by the staff of two.&lt;ref&gt;name=Enros, Philip C. "The Technical Service Council's Origins: a 'Patriotic Experiment' in Selling Engineers"&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Great Depression]] soon arrived, wiping out many jobs. Some graduates were placed in welcome, but undemanding jobs, like street car conductor. Raising money was difficult and the Council  survived only because of grants from the government of [[Ontario]] in 1932-34 and sometimes, Smythe's forgoing his salary.  It was decided to ask those who had found jobs through the TSC to make donations.  This produced some money, but the organization had a hand-to-mouth existence until 1957, apart from the [[World War II]] years. (3)

By June 30, 1933, over 1,180 personnel had been placed, 110 of whom were repatriated Canadians.  Expenses for the first five years of operations
were $44,988.&lt;ref&gt;"The Technical Service Council - a Report Covering the First Five-Year Period, June 30th, 1928 to June 30th, 1933."&lt;/ref&gt; In 1933, 111 men and women were placed by the Council's staff of two.&lt;ref name=TSC/&gt;

Even then it was clear that engineers needed business knowledge.  The Council persuaded the [[University of Western Ontario]] to offer a diploma course in management for engineers.&lt;ref name=TSC/&gt; Then such a course was novel, if not unique. In 1951 numerous employers and graduates in [[ceramic engineering]] were surveyed on behalf of the [[University of Saskatchewan]] to estimate future demand. Some time later a similar survey was made for the University of Toronto.  As a result of these studies, both universities discontinued their ceramic engineering programs.&lt;ref&gt;"Ceramic Engineers". ''Clay Products News'', Jan. 1952.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1938, in response employers' demand for "one-stop service", the Council expanded to include executives, accountants, marketing, production and personnel staff.&lt;ref name=TSC/&gt; A year later, the economy had improved, but the Council's placements were mainly in [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]], where Canada's industry was concentrated.

=== Wartime years ===

Job vacancies soared with the start of World War II.  Shipyards, steel mills, armaments and munitions factories, aircraft manufacturers and construction companies urgently needed engineers.  Few engineers even considered emigrating to the United States because of patriotic reasons and the plethora of jobs.

The Technical Service Council was the only placement service allowed to operate during the war.&lt;ref name=TSC/&gt; Its  bank of professionals was such an important national resource that 15 recruiters from Defence Industries Ltd., the major munitions manufacturer, were loaned to the Council.&lt;ref name=TSC/&gt;

===Post-war activities ===

After the war, veterans were entitled to free university tuition.  Therefore, record numbers of engineers were graduated in 1949 and 1950.&lt;ref&gt;"Employment Outlook Promising", ''5TO Engineers' Newsletter'', prepared by the Technical Service Council, Nov. 10, 1950.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Engineering Employment at Record Level", Technical Service Council news release N12/50, Nov. 17, 1950.&lt;/ref&gt; Graduates of Western and Maritime universities, both in areas with limited industry, greatly outnumbered local vacancies.  Many engineers moved to Ontario, Quebec and the United States.  About 2,500 professional men emigrated to the United States in 1950 alone.&lt;ref name=pastures&gt;"Are Those Pastures Greener?"  Unsigned editorial in ''The Globe &amp; Mail'', Toronto, May 6, 1952.  Reprinted by the Technical Service Council.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, one study showed that the exodus of technically trained graduates dropped from 27% of the graduating classes in 1927 to under 10% in 1951.&lt;ref name=someone&gt;"Someone Has Done Something about Canada's Loss of Skills," unsigned editorial, ''The Telegram'', Toronto, Oct. 5, 1951.  Reprinted by the Technical Service Council.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pioneering work was done on group interviews and recruitment advertising in 1950-52.&lt;ref name=Macdougall&gt;Macdougall, Neil A. "Make Your Personnel Advertising Dollars Count", ''Personnel'', May, 1952.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Group Oral in Canada", ''Canadian Personnel &amp; Industrial Relations Journal'', April, 1956.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter study showed how employers could increase response to their ads. The Federal government engaged the Council to write a handbook on the job market for immigrants while the Ontario Government asked the Council to appraise opportunities for prospective immigrants from [[Great Britain]].

Canadian industry contributed more than $300,000 to the Council between 1927 and 1953.&lt;ref name="PR1954" /&gt; During the same period, employers listed 16,533 job vacancies.&lt;ref name=TSC1952/&gt; 6,817 men with special training were placed in key positions in business and industry.&lt;ref name="PR1954"/&gt; The Council registered and interviewed 24,607 men with higher education.&lt;ref name="PR1954"/&gt; The qualifications of each were carefully cross-indexed and maintained for employers.&lt;ref name="PR1954"/&gt; An additional 100,000 individuals were interviewed to assess qualifications and give free vocational advice. The average cost per placement rose from $50 to $100 between 1948 and 1954.&lt;ref name="PR1954"/&gt;

Between 1951 and 1956, 3,072 engineers, equivalent to 31% of graduating classes in engineering, emigrated to the United States.&lt;ref name=Ex-Canadian&gt;"Ex-Canadian Engineers Could Staff World's Largest Missile Centre", Technical Service Council news release N1/57, Nov. 14, 1957.&lt;/ref&gt; They could have staffed the largest missile centre in the Western World.&lt;ref name=Ex-Canadian/&gt; In 1951 the equivalent of 11% of the graduating classes in engineering left for the United States.  In 1956, as immigrants were less likely to be drafted, the percentage had soared to 46%.&lt;ref name=Ex-Canadian/&gt;

In 1957 the Council almost collapsed, but it was revived by new management who increased placement fees.

Shortages of engineers and scientists in Canada often coincided with equally acute shortages in the United States.  American companies then recruited actively in Canada, as they did following the 1959 cancellation of Canada's much-vaunted [[Avro Arrow]] jet fighter. In addition, Canadians completing post-graduate training in the U.S. often found getting a job locally easier than searching for one in distant Canada.&lt;ref name=reversing&gt;''Reversing the Brain Drain'', a report for the Ministry of State, Science and Technology, Technical Service Council, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962 a branch in [[Montreal]] called Technical Service Council/Le Conseil de Placement Professionnel was opened.  It was followed by others in [[Winnipeg]], [[Calgary]], [[Edmonton]] and [[Vancouver]].&lt;ref name=TSC/&gt;

=== Outplacement and other activities ===

The Council was one of the pioneers of [[outplacement]] (then called relocation counselling) in Canada.&lt;ref name=TSC/&gt;&lt;ref name=Macdougall/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Feature article on relocation counselling work by Technical Service Council and another consultant.  Title and author unknown.  ''Harvard Business Review''.  Circa 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; Its first contract in 1970 eventually developed into a significant activity.  In addition to individual counselling, free office services and other benefits, clients were given ''How to Job Hunt Effectively,'' a substantial hand and work book.&lt;ref name=Harvey&gt;Harvey, Edward B. and Murthy, K.S.R., ''Engineering Supply &amp; Demand, 1988-1998'', Technical Service Council, Toronto, 1988.  {{ISBN|0-920924-32-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The book was also available to the public and over 5,000 copies were sold.

From 1967 regular one-day employment interviewing courses for line managers were run in major cities.  Students received written critiques of their interviews with actors.

By 1971 out-of-work university graduates were so numerous that free "How to Job Hunt" courses were held in several cities.&lt;ref name=TSC/&gt; As another public service, over $200,000. was spent researching and publishing ten-year forecasts of the supply of and demand for engineering graduates in 1975 and again in 1988.  Both studies were intended to improve understanding of the job market, candidate mobility and help minimize "mismatch".&lt;ref name=Harvey/&gt; They were provided free to Canadian universities and sold at below cost to employers.&lt;ref name=TSC/&gt;

In the same year, an executive search division, Bryce, Haultain &amp; Associates, was opened and named after two of the Council's co-founders.&lt;ref name=TSC/&gt;

===Later placement activities===

By 1976 the Council had placed over 16,000 men and women.&lt;ref name=TSC/&gt; An equal number were estimated to have rejected job offers from the Council's client companies.  Studies showed that 25% of job listings were never filled from any source.  Employers' reasons included budget cuts, inability to find someone who filled the job specifications, candidates' high asking salaries, reorganizations and a belated realization that existing staff could do the job.

In 1976 573 firms were members.&lt;ref name=TSC/&gt; Annual membership fees were mainly $100 to $500., depending upon company size and usage.  Placement fees were kept low in order to attract job listings.   The greater the choice of vacancies, the more likely candidates were to stay in Canada.  Placement fees for member companies were 4% to 5% of the placement's annual income.&lt;ref name=TSC/&gt; Commercial [[employment agencies]] charged 20% to 30%.&lt;ref name=TSC/&gt;

Over 17,000 engineers and scientists emigrated from Canada to the United States between 1960 and 1979. The number of engineers emigrating declined from 1,209 in 1967 to only 289 in 1977, and the number of chemists emigrating dropped from 156 to 58 during the same period.&lt;ref&gt;" 'Brain Drain' Surge Feared", ''Toronto Star'', July 17, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; However, engineers and scientists emigrating increased from 727 in 1982 to 1,433 in 1985.&lt;ref name=reversing/&gt;

Active job listings reached 4,328 in June 1981,an astonishing figure for such a clearing house.&lt;ref name=jobs&gt;{{Citation
  | last = Technical Service Council
  | title = 
  | newspaper = Ontario Technologist
  | pages = 
  | date = Summer 1981
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Orders plummeted when Prime Minister [[Pierre Trudeau]]'s highly controversial [[National Energy Program]] took effect.  About half the Council's staff was laid off.

Nevertheless, between 1928 and 1988, over 46,000 men and women had received job offers from about 1,700 of the Council's employer clients.&lt;ref name=Harvey/&gt;

Frequent dramatic swings in the job market caused the Council to build a financial reserve equal to two times' annual operating expenses.&lt;ref name=TSC/&gt; The reserve was over three times' expenses in December, 1991, but the Council was declared bankrupt in September, 1994.&lt;ref&gt;Technical Service Council Financial Statements, Dec. 31, 1992, Doane Raymond, auditors.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evaluation of results ==

From 1928 to 1939, job vacancies were mainly advertised locally so job hunters had difficulty learning of distant jobs.  The Maritimes and West had so little industry that their substantial engineering graduating classes had to seek positions elsewhere. Employers seldom sought professionals through the Federal employment service while universities had tiny or non-existent placement services.  This lack of job information made the Council's numerous industrial contacts especially important to job hunters.  The exodus of technically trained Canadians is said to have dropped from 27% of graduating classes in 1927 to under 10% in 1951 &lt;ref name=someone/&gt; and 5% in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;"The Story of TSC - a Unique Placement Service", ''The Professional Engineer and Engineering Digest'', May, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;

Any evaluation of the later years is difficult.  The number of job vacancies and job hunters both increased.  But often supply and demand were out of sync, encouraging emigration.  Universities devoted more resources to placing their graduates, but often gave little attention to experienced graduates.  Commercial employment agencies expanded, but few lasted five years because of the erratic job market.  Eventually, one and then another national newspaper spread news of distant vacancies.  Although graduates had better information than ever, the Council was still busy.  Despite this, 2,500 professional men moved to the United States in 1950 alone.&lt;ref name=pastures/&gt; It is impossible to judge the Council's impact on the "brain drain" since then.

The Ministry of State, Science and Technology asked the Council to study the feasibility of a National Register of Canadians in research-oriented occupations who are working or studying out of the country.&lt;ref name=reversing/&gt; The study found that 65% of employers contacted had a strong or moderate interest in a register.  It was estimated that only one or two per cent of candidates would find jobs through the register.  Neither the register nor a free handbook on job hunting in Canada would get at the reasons why many Canadians do not return: a perceived lack of opportunities in their specialty and lack of research support in Canada.&lt;ref name=reversing/&gt;

The study noted that efforts by the Association of Medical Colleges of Canada and the [[Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada]] to recruit Canadians in the U.S. had failed.  In 1986 twenty British firms advertised for British-trained engineers in [[North America]].  The ads produced 6,500 replies and about 1,800 job offers.  Only 89 offers were accepted at what was considered an uneconomical cost.&lt;ref name=reversing/&gt;

'''''The Widower''''' is a British [[television]] [[miniseries]] originally broadcast in three one-hour installments on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] in 2014. The series portrays the life and crimes of convicted murderer [[Malcolm Webster (murderer)|Malcolm Webster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/presscentre/press-releases/reece-shearsmith-and-sheridan-smith-widower |title=Reece Shearsmith and Sheridan Smith in The Widower &amp;#124; presscentre |publisher=Itv.com |date=2014-01-09 |accessdate=2014-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; ITV described the show as: "The Widower tells how, over a 13-year period, a seemingly mild-mannered [[nurse]], Malcolm Webster, set about [[poisoning]] and murdering his first wife, attempting to do the same to his second wife and moving on to a further scheme to deceive his third fiancée."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotsman.com/what-s-on/tv-radio/tv-drama-to-focus-on-malcolm-webster-murders-1-3262761 |title=TV drama to focus on Malcolm Webster murders |publisher=The Scotsman |date=2014-01-10 |accessdate=2014-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series was written by Jim Barton and [[Jeff Pope]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Armstrong |first=Stephen |url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2014-03-17/why-is-the-widower-writer-jeff-pope-drawn-to-tales-of-passion-and-poison |title=The Widower: Malcolm Webster is evil, yet two women willingly married him |publisher=Radiotimes.com |date=2014-03-17 |accessdate=2014-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

 |ShortSummary    = Malcolm marries Claire. The film opens with him praising his 'darling Claire'. Shortly after they are married she requests to see all his debts. He responds by drugging her with [[Temazepam]] and murdering her in a staged [[car crash]]. Several years later he moves to [[New Zealand]] where he marries Felicity, whom he also starts drugging. He clearly plans to murder her by pushing her off a cliff but changes his mind when he finds out she is [[pregnant]]. Malcolm has no money and is in major debt, but doesn't tell Felicity. Felicity reluctantly agrees to a joint bank account with Malcolm.

 |ShortSummary    = Everyone survives the fire. Malcolm manages to convince Felicity that she had spilt nail varnish remover on a chair, which ultimately caused the fire. She reveals to her father that her doctor is concerned about her liver (Malcolm has been drugging her). She narrowly escapes Malcolm attempting to murder her in another staged car accident. She discovers he has stolen almost her entire savings and has taken out numerous [[life insurance]] policies in her name. He returns to the United Kingdom, where he meets Simone.

 |ShortSummary    = Malcolm is now living with Simone. Charlie Henry, a Detective Inspector, is investigating him. He (Malcolm) is arrested for stealing funds from the angling club, of which he is treasurer. He is also charged with possession of a firearm without a licence and stealing a laptop. The prosecutor refuses to proceed with the first two charges and in court the third is dismissed on a technicality. An examination of Claire's [[liver]] establishes that she was drugged and a re-investigation of the hospital fire shows that Malcolm started it. This enables Charlie to re-open the investigation of Claire's death. The [[police]] present Simone with an [[Death threat#Osman warning, letter or notice|Osman letter]] telling her that Malcolm has a wife and son in New Zealand and that they believe she is in grave danger. She ends their relationship after giving him money and getting him to admit he lied about having leukemia. A year later, Malcolm is arrested for Claire's murder. Simone, a yachtswoman, is shocked to discover that Malcolm had sabotaged her [[lifejacket]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/03/31/the-widower-review-episode-3-reece-shearsmith_n_5065507.html |title='The Widower' Episode 3 Review - Malcolm Webster Finally Runs Out Of Lies |publisher=Huffingtonpost.co.uk |date=2014-03-31 |accessdate=2014-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The YoungCuts Film Festival''' is a [[Montreal]]-based international [[film festival]], whose mandate is to advance the careers of young filmmakers. ''The Festival'' was created to identify and help talented young people begin their [[film]] and [[television]] careers by providing exposure and recognition of their works. The annual event selects the best 100 films submitted by filmmakers 25 years old and under for screening at the annual festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |authorlink= |author= Kathryn Greenaway |title= Driven to direct |url= http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/preview/story.html?id=3aecc24e-8dbe-4e89-adbd-7a3dcbd4f198 |work= Montreal Gazette |location= |id= |pages= |page= |date= August 17, 2007 |accessdate=2010-05-05 |quote= |archiveurl= |archivedate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Melora |last= Koepke |title= YoungCuts Film Festival traffics in talent |url= http://www.hour.ca/film/film.aspx?iIDArticle=12698 |publisher= Montreal Hour Newspaper |pages= |page= |date= August 16, 2007 |accessdate=2010-05-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Originally launched as the ''[[Toronto International Teen Movie Festival]]'' in 2001, the event was reorganized and re-launched as ''the YoungCuts Film Festival'' in 2005. In August 2006, the festival added [[Montreal]] as a venue and became bilingual, featuring 50 films including English and French titles.  ''The Festival'' began to receive more submissions from around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Isa |last= Tousignant   |title= YoungCuts Fest is back with a new slew of up-and-comers |url=http://www.hour.ca/film/film.aspx?iIDArticle=9997   |publisher= Montreal Hour Newspaper |pages= |page= |date=  August 17, 2006 |accessdate=2010-05-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, ''the Festival'' made Montreal its permanent home.  ''The Festival'' also set a goal to increase the quantity and quality of films submitted to the festival. As a result, the festival expanded from 4 days to 8 and the number of films presented expanded from 50 to 100. ''The Festival'' has grown significantly since its inception, and has been actively supported by a number of television and film professionals including [[Tom Sizemore]], [[Lalaine]], [[Chris Potter (actor)|Chris Potter]], [[Maxim Roy]], and [[Frédérick De Grandpré]].

Since its inception, ''YoungCuts'' has been asked to use its expertise to recruit young film makers for various projects and competitions including the [[National Film Board]]’s “Make Shorts Not War”, ''Air Canada's en Route Film Festival'' and the ''Pepsi Access'' competitions.

''The Festival'' has received the support of a number of major companies.  Its sponsors have included [[Pepsi]], [[Nokia]], [[Astral Media]], [[High Fidelity HDTV]], [[Avid Technology|Avid]], [[Quebecor]], [[Tribute (magazine)|Tribute Magazine]] and the [[City of Montreal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.hifihdtv.ca/12-08-2008.php |title= High Fidelity HDTV Sponsors the Opening Night Gala of the YoungCuts Film Festival |accessdate=2010-05-05 |work= |publisher= High Fidelity HDTV  |date= August 12, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.colorectal-cancer.ca/en/events-and-raising/ccac-fund-events/ |title= YoungCuts Film Festival |accessdate=2010-05-05 |publisher= Canadian Colorectal Cancer Web Site |date= August 14, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Kathryn |last= Greenaway |authorlink= |author= |coauthors= |title= Short, sweet and by the under-25 |url= http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/arts/story.html?id=df924843-b1e1-439a-93ef-fe68b7d05029 |publisher= Montreal Gazette Newspaper |date= August 15, 2008 |accessdate=2010-05-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Al |last= Kratina |title= YoungCuts Film Festival: Nokia Best Teen Film |url= http://communities.canada.com/montrealgazette/blogs/thecinefiles/archive/2008/08/17/youngcuts-film-festival-nokia-best-teen-film-award.aspx |publisher= Montreal Gazette Newspaper  |date= August 17, 2008 |accessdate=2010-05-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Thomas Knyvet, 1st Baron Knyvet''' ({{IPAc-en|n|ɪ|v|ɪ|t}}; or Knevytt, Knyvett, Knevett, Knevitt; 1545&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://kindred.stanford.edu/#/kin/full/none/none/I3415// |title=Sir Thomas Knyvett Baron Knyvett of Escrick PC - I3415 - Individual Information - PhpGedView |publisher=Stanford.edu |accessdate=2017-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; – 27 July 1622) was an English courtier and Member of Parliament who played a part in foiling the [[Gunpowder Plot]].

Thomas Knyvet was the second son of Sir Henry Knyvet of [[Charlton, Brinkworth|Charlton]], [[Wiltshire]], and Anne Pickering, daughter of Sir Christopher Pickering of [[Killington, Cumbria|Killington]], [[Westmorland]]. His niece, [[Catherine Knyvet]], was married to [[Thomas Howard, 1st Earl of Suffolk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/auden/cgi-bin/auden/individual.php?pid=I592&amp;ged=auden-bicknell.ged&amp;tab=0 |title=Catherine Knyvett - I592 - Individual Information - PhpGedView |publisher=Stanford.edu |accessdate=2012-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended [[Jesus College, Cambridge|Jesus College]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=KNVT564T|name=Knyvet, Thomas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a Gentleman of the [[Privy Chamber]] to [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]], and in 1592 was made [[Master at Arms]]. He was elected [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Thetford (UK Parliament constituency)|Thetford]] in 1601.

On 21 July 1597 Knyvet married Elizabeth Hayward, the daughter of [[Rowland Hayward|Sir Rowland Hayward]] and widow of Richard Warren of Claybury, [[Essex]]. He was granted the manor of [[Stanwell]] in 1603.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |editor-last=Reynolds |editor-first=Susan |year=1962 |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=22239 |title=Stanwell: Manors |publisher=Institute of Historical Research |work=A History of the County of Middlesex: Volume 3: Shepperton, Staines, Stanwell, Sunbury, Teddington, Heston and Isleworth, Twickenham, Cowley, Cranford, West Drayton, Greenford, Hanwell, Harefield and Harlington |accessdate=3 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was knighted in 1604.&lt;ref name=no10&gt;{{cite web |title=Early Inhabitants of 10 Downing Street |url=http://www.number10.gov.uk/history-and-tour/early-inhabitants-2/ |publisher=UK Government |accessdate=28 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120129164251/http://www.number10.gov.uk/history-and-tour/early-inhabitants-2/ |archivedate=29 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Knyvet was the most active intervener in foiling the [[Gunpowder Plot]]. On the evening of 26&amp;nbsp;October 1605, the Catholic [[William Parker, 4th Baron Monteagle|Lord Monteagle]] received an anonymous letter warning him to stay away from Parliament during the opening, and to "retyre youre self into yowre contee whence yow maye expect the event in safti for&amp;nbsp;... they shall receyve a terrible blowe this parleament".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Northcote Parkinson|1976|pp=68–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Monteagle's letter was shown to King James. The [[James VI and I|King]] ordered Knyvet to conduct a search of the cellars underneath Parliament, which he carried out with [[Edmund Doubleday]] in the early hours of 5&amp;nbsp;November. [[Guy Fawkes]] was arrested by Knyvet whilst leaving the cellar shortly after midnight.  Inside, the barrels of gunpowder were discovered hidden under piles of firewood and coal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Northcote Parkinson|1976|p=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After foiling the plot Knyvet was given charge of the education of the short-lived [[Mary Stuart (1605–1607)|Princess Mary]]. By royal grant of a peerage he entered the [[House of Lords]] as Baron Knyvet of [[Escrick]], [[Yorkshire]] in 1607.  He was appointed a [[Privy Council]]lor, Member of the Council to [[Anne of Denmark|Queen Anne]], and [[Warden of the Mint]]. In 1613, the manor of [[Staines upon Thames|Staines]] was granted him outright.&lt;ref name=sr&gt;{{Cite web |editor-last=Reynolds |editor-first=Susan |year=1962 |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=22226 |title=Staines: Manors |publisher=Institute of Historical Research |work=A History of the County of Middlesex: Volume 3: Shepperton, Staines, Stanwell, Sunbury, Teddington, Heston and Isleworth, Twickenham, Cowley, Cranford, West Drayton, Greenford, Hanwell, Harefield and Harlington |accessdate=3 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He maintained a long-running feud with [[Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford]]. Knyvet's niece, [[Anne Vavasour]], was the Earl's mistress, and on 21 March 1581 bore his illegitimate son, Edward Vere. On numerous occasions, servants on either side were killed.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} On one occasion, Knyvet injured Oxford, apparently in the leg.

When Lord Knyvet died in July 1622 his will provided for the foundation of a free-school in [[Stanwell]] — the [[Thomas Knyvett College|Lord Knyvet School]] was founded in 1624. An effigy of him and his wife features in the [[chancel]] of Stanwell's [[Church of St Mary, Stanwell|St Mary's parish church]].&lt;ref&gt;{{NHLE|num=1187042|accessdate=3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Knyvet House==
{{see also|10 Downing Street}}
Knyvet occupied as his London [[Townhouse (Great Britain)|townhouse]] the first house known on the site of [[10 Downing Street]], the modern-day residence of the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]], in a large timber and brick building with an L-shaped garden.&lt;ref name=no10 /&gt; It was first leased to him in 1581 by [[Queen Elizabeth I]] at which point it became known as '''Knyvet House''', and his lifetime lease was extended in 1604 to extend to his heirs.&lt;ref name=no10 /&gt; The house was described by the parliamentary commissioners in 1650 as:

:“...built part wth Bricke and part wth Tymber and Flemish qalle and covered with Tyle, consistinge of a Large and spacious hall, [[wainscoting|wainscoted round]], well Lighted, and Paved wth brick Pavements, two parls whereof one is Wainscoted round from the [[wikt:ceiling|seelinge]] to ye floor, one Buttery, one seller, one Large kitchen well paved with stone and well fitted and Joynted and well fitted wth dreser boards….

Also 6 more Roomes and 3 Closetts in the same flore all well lighted and seeled. And in the second story 4 garretts...”

The house passed to his niece, Elizabeth Hampden, in whose lifetime, whether purposefully it adopted her surname and whose nephew was [[Oliver Cromwell]].&lt;ref name=no10 /&gt; After the lease expired on Hampden House and garden in 1682, [[Sir George Downing, 1st Baronet|George Downing]] redeveloped the site and adjoining premises.

'''Triplemanía XXIII''' was a [[professional wrestling]] [[pay-per-view]] (PPV) produced by the [[Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide]] (AAA) [[Professional wrestling promotion|promotion]]. It took place on August 9, 2015, at [[Mexico City Arena|Arena Ciudad de México]] in [[Mexico City]], [[Mexico]]. The event was the twenty-third year in a row that AAA has held a [[Triplemanía]] show, and was the thirtieth show held under the Triplemanía name since 1993 as AAA held multiple Triplemanía shows some years.  The annual Triplemanía show is AAA's biggest show of the year, serving as the culmination of major storylines and feature wrestlers from all over the world competing in what has been described as AAA's version of [[WrestleMania]] or their [[Super Bowl]] event.

The main event was billed as a "Dream match" between two of the biggest names in ''lucha libre'', a [[Professional wrestling match types#Variations of singles matches|singles match]] between [[Rey Mysterio|Rey Mysterio Jr.]] and [[Myzteziz]]. A second match, a ''[[Lucha de Apuestas]]'' "hair vs. hair" match between [[Alberto Del Rio|El Patrón Alberto]] and [[Brian Cage]] was confirmed at the AAA television taping on July 10. The show was the final mach of ''lucha libre'' legend [[Villano III]] as he teamed up with his brothers [[Villano IV]] and [[Villano V]] to take on ''[[Los Psycho Circus]]'' and three additional matches. The show received very negative reviews both due to technical difficulties throughout the show and the quality of several of the matches on the show.

===Storylines===

AAA has traditionally included a [[Professional wrestling tag team match types#Multiple man teamed matches|''Relevos Atómicos de Locura'']], or "Atomic Madness" match as part of their major shows for years as a homage to AAA founder [[Antonio Peña]] who created the concept years prior. In a ''Relevos Atómicos de Locura'' match each team represents the four distinct type of wrestlers that work for AAA, Male, Female, ''[[Mini-Estrella]]'' and ''[[Exótico]]''. While the match is a mixed-gender match there are no rules to limit the interaction between the teams so males wrestle females, ''Mini-Estrellas'' wrestle ''Exótico'' and so on. For the 2015 show AAA paired up [[Drago (wrestler)|Drago]] (male), [[Goya Kong]] (female), [[Dinastía]] (''Mini-Estrella'' and [[AAA World Mini-Estrella Championship|AAA World Mini-Estrella Champion]]) and [[Pimpinela Escarlata]] (''Exótico'') on the '''tecnico'' side to take on [[Daga (wrestler)|Daga]] (male), [[Sexy Star]] (female), [[Mini Psycho Clown]] (''Mini-Estrella'') and [[Mamba (wrestler)|Mamba]] (''Exótico''). The two ''Exótico'' had fought on opposite sides of various ''Relevos Atómicos de Locura'' matches for years, as far back as the 2014 [[Rey de Reyes (2014)|Rey de Reyes]] ("King of Kings").&lt;ref name=RdR2014MT&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.mediotiempo.com/mas-deportes/lucha-libre/noticias/2014/03/04/listo-el-cartel-de-rey-de-reyes | title = Listo el cartel de Rey de Reyes | date=March 4, 2014 | accessdate=March 5, 2014 | work=MedioTiempo | language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goya Kong had only recently joined AAA making the Triplemanía XXIII her first major AAA appearance.

In the weeks leading up to Triplemanía XXIII AAA announced their intentions to induct El Hijo del Perro Aguayo (The Son of [[Perro Aguayo]]) , sometimes referred to as "Perro Aguayo Jr." into their [[Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide#Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] at Triplemanía.&lt;ref name=2015HoF&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thegladiatores.com/?p=13540 | title=El Hijo del Perro Aguayo al salón de la Fama AAA | date=July 30, 2015 | accessdate=July 31, 2015 | work=The Gladiatores | language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aguayo made his professional wrestling debut on June 18, 1995 at [[Triplemanía III-B]].&lt;ref name="Trip3B"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/mexico/aaa/triple.html#iii-b | title = Asistencia Asesoría y Administración TripleManía | accessdate = March 21, 2015 | publisher = ProWrestlingHistory.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having worked for AAA's biggest rival [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre]] (CMLL) for years El Hijo del Perro Aguayo returned to AAA 2010 at [[Triplemanía XVIII]] leading his ''[[Los Perros del Mal]]'' group in an invasion storyline.

The English language broadcast of Triplemanía XXIII experienced extended periods of time with audio problems, at times neither of the commentators were heard, at other times only [[Matt Striker]] could be heard and at one point there was a prolonged buzzing sound on the English language broadcast. It has not been confirmed if the Spanish language broadcast suffered from the same audio issues.&lt;ref name=PWTM23/&gt; The broadcast also suffered from some video issues especially early in the fourth match of the night involving Blue Demon Jr., La Parka, Electroshock and Mesisas.&lt;ref name=PWTM23/&gt; The Triplemanía XXIII stage set resembled the nose of a large cargo plane with wrestlers walking down steps through an opening in the front of the plan, then proceeding down what was described as the ''[[Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation]]'' runway, a ramp that resembled an airport runway.
[[File:Sin cara firmando autografos.jpg|left|thumb|[[Místico|Myzteziz]], the other half of the "Dream Match" main event, who turned ''rudo'' after the match]]
For his entrance prior to the main event Myzteziz was lowered from the ceiling wearing a harness, holding a pose similar to that of Ethan Hunt (portrayed by [[Tom Cruise]]) from the first ''[[Mission Impossible (film)|Mission Impossible]]'' movie. Once he landed on the ground and was unhooked he revealed a half black/half white version of his normal wrestling gear, alluding to comments made prior to the show that he may or may not work as a ''tecnico'' for the match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mediotiempo.com/mas-deportes/lucha-libre/noticias/2015/08/06/voy-a-humillar-a-rey-mysterio-myzteziz | title=Voy a humillar a Rey Mysterio: Myzteziz | date=August 6, 2015  | accessdate=August 10, 2015 | work=MedioTiempo | publisher=[[MSN]] | language=Spanish | first= Apolo | last=Valdés}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially Rey Mysterio Jr. took control of the match, much to Myzteziz's frustration, with Myzteziz only gaining control of the match by using punches, kicks and other ''rudo'' tactics. This drew boos from the crowd as they were vocally behind Rey Mysterio Jr. At one point during the match Myzteziz slammed Rey Mysterio Jr. onto of the English Language commentator's table, and at another point he [[suplex]]ed Mysterio Jr. out of the ring, through a table. At one point Rey Mysterio Jr. threw Myzteziz into one of the ring posts, making it look like Myzteziz hit his head on the metal. While the cameras were focusing on Rey Mysterio Jr. Myzteziz made it look like the impact had cut his forehead open as blood (or a similar red substance) covered the white portion of his mask. Once the two wrestlers returned to the ring Rey Mysterio Jr. started to tear at Myzteziz's mask, tearing it open around the eye holds. Late in the match Rey Mysterio Jr. managed to apply Myzteziz's finishing hold, the ''La Mistica'' [[Professional wrestling holds#Fujiwara armbar|Fujiwara armbar]], on Myzteziz but did not gain a submission from the move. Later on Mysterio Jr. managed to apply ''La Mistica'' once more, this time with Myzteziz being forced to tap out. As Mysterio Jr. celebrated on the floor Averno, Pentagón Jr. and [[Joe Lider]] ran to the ring to attack Myzteziz while he was down. When Rey Mysterio Jr. noticed the attack he entered the ring and helped Myzteziz fight off the ''rudo'' trios. When Mysterio Jr. offered a handshake Myzteziz spit a liquid in Mysterio's eyes and then declared that he did not care about the fans or Rey Mysterio Jr. He later challenged Mysterio to put his mask on the line in a ''Luchas de Apuestas'' match. As the show went off the air Myzteziz declined to join [[Konnan]]'s ''[[La Sociedad]]'', stating he was on his own.&lt;ref name=PWTM23/&gt;&lt;ref name=WrestleViewTM23/&gt;&lt;ref name=TM23SL/&gt;

==Reception==
In the minutes after the PPV ended ''Lucha Libre'' journalist Apolo Valdés, who writes for the sports website ''MedioTiempo'' commented on Twitter that he really did not like the show, he only liked the cage match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://twitter.com/apolovaldes/status/630565056242020352 | title=La verdad no me gustó #TriplemaniaXXIII sólo me gustó la de jaula, la estelar sólo los momentos finales | first=Apolo | last=Valdés | publisher=[[Twitter]] | date=August 9, 2015 | accessdate=August 9, 2015 | language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Josh Boutwell, reviewing the show for wrestleview stated the second match of the night involving ''Los Villanos'' was a "trainwreck". He also noted that the ''Apuestas'' match was "awesome" and that the main event was a great match despite a couple of clunky spots." He also noted that the PPV broadcast suffered from several technical issues, primarily with the sound on the English commentary and occasionally also issues with the picture quality. In the end he gave the Mysterio/Myzteziz match four stars out of five and rated the entire show as a "C+".&lt;ref name=WrestleViewTM23/&gt; James Caldewell of the Pro Wrestling Torch noted that the cage match "felt disorganized with so many people involved and a lot of standing around". Following the conclusion of the main event he commented that "more aimed at the live audience than translating to PPV". His final conclusion was " Not a recommended PPV. The last two matches had star-power and stories to carry the event once the technical difficulties were worked out, but the live atmosphere and significance of the event just did not seem to translate to PPV".&lt;ref name=PWTM23/&gt; Richard Gallegos, when writing an editorial for ''SuperLuchas'' Magazine, called Triplemanía XXIII "a disaster", both due to technical issues but also due to the fact that they were presenting a show to the US audience which have very little back story or build to four of the six matches, citing the ''Los Villanos''/''Los Psycho Circus'' match as one of the worst matches of the year. Summarizing he called it a "terrible experience" and that the production crew was a "monumental failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://superluchas.com/2015/08/10/el-desastre-llamado-triplemania-23/ | title=El desastre llamado Triplemania 23 | first=Ricardo | last=Gallegos | date=August 10, 2015 | accessdate=August 11, 2015 | work=SuperLuchas | language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dave Meltzer]] of the ''[[Wrestling Observer Newsletter]]'' called the event "one of the worst PPV shows of all-time", stating "[t]his was a misfire to the level it's probably best for them to regroup and not try this again for some time". He gave the ''Los Villanos''/''Los Psycho Circus'' match a "minus five star" rating, calling it "one of the worst matches [he had] ever seen". He gave the main event three and three quarter stars out of five, his highest rating of the night. Meltzer, who had been approached by AAA to work as part of the English announcing team for the event, also stated that while he had sympathy for the announcers for the technical issues, he would not want them back, calling Matt Striker "terrible throughout" and stating that Hugo Savinovich was "off his game" in regard to clueing fans in on the storylines behind the matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = Meltzer | first = Dave | authorlink = Dave Meltzer | date = August 17, 2015 | title = August 17, 2015 Wrestling Observer Newsletter: Summerslam build, Unions courting UFC fighters, more | journal = [[Dave Meltzer#Wrestling Observer Newsletter|Wrestling Observer Newsletter]] | location = [[Campbell, California]] | issn = 1083-9593 | pages=14–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Readers of the ''Wrestling Observer Newsletter'' voted the match between ''Los Psycho Circus'' and ''Los Villanos'' the 2015 [[List of Wrestling Observer Newsletter awards#Worst Worked Match of the Year|Worst Match of the Year]] and the entire event as the Worst Major Wrestling Show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = Meltzer | first = Dave | authorlink = Dave Meltzer | date = January 25, 2016 | title = January 25, 2016 Wrestling Observer Newsletter: 2015 Observer Awards Issue | journal = [[Wrestling Observer Newsletter]] | location = [[Campbell, California]] | issn = 1083-9593 | page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4278">'''University of Redwood''' is a fictitious college claiming to be located in Oregon in the United States.  It can be confused with [[Reed College]] in [[Portland, Oregon]], or the [[College of the Redwoods]] in [[Eureka, California]].

The Redwood website copies the Reed website, except it substitutes the institution's name.&lt;ref name=wsj&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704692904576166833446761162|title=College Cries Foul Over a Copycat|first=Kevin|last=Helliker|work=Wall Street Journal|date=February 26–27, 2011|page=A3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, on at least the About page, the copiers failed and at one point left the Reed name intact.&lt;ref name=che&gt;{{citation |url=http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/reed-college-seeks-to-stop-copycat-web-site/29999?sid=at|title=Reed College Seeks to Stop Copycat Web Site| work=Wired Campus blog | publisher=Chronicle of Higher Education|first=Ben |last=Wieder|date=February 24, 2011| accessdate=2011-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The street address and phone numbers for Reed's Cooley Art Gallery remain intact on the Redwood site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uredwood.com/cooley_gallary.php|title=Cooley Gallery - Redwood University|publisher=Redwood University|accessdate=2011-02-27|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110227005821/http://uredwood.com/cooley_gallary.php|archivedate=2011-02-27 }} copied from {{cite web|url=http://www.reed.edu/gallery/|title=Cooley Gallery - Reed College|publisher=Reed College|accessdate=2011-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; At one point, the entire faculty directory of Reed was listed on the Redwood site.&lt;ref name=wsj/&gt; While Reed was founded by Simeon and Amanda Reed, Redwood was founded by Simeon and Amanda Redwood.&lt;ref name=che/&gt;&lt;ref name=kgw&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kgw.com/news/local/Reed-College-Website-Cloned-By-Scammers-117025028.html|title=Reed College website cloned by scammers in China|first=Wayne |last=Havrelly|date=February 27, 2011|work=KGW News|accessdate=2011-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As first reported by ''Inside Higher Ed'',&lt;ref&gt;http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2011/02/24/qt#252136&lt;/ref&gt; at least one man living in China created the Redwood site in June 2010.&lt;ref name=kgw/&gt; Reed first discovered the Redwood site in October 2010 and sent letters to Redwood's [[internet service provider]] under the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] demanding that the [[copyright]]ed materials be taken down.  The site was removed within a few days.&lt;ref name=che/&gt;  However, the site was restored in November when its owners claimed that the infringing materials were removed.&lt;ref name=che/&gt; Reed officials rediscovered the site in January 2011; as of February 2011 they once again were able to have the site taken down.&lt;ref name=che/&gt;  According to Martin Ringle, chief technology officer of Reed, the site could be used to collect admission application fees fraudulently from Asian students.&lt;ref name=wsj/&gt; Upon receiving an application, "a shrewd scammer could wait several weeks, then issue a rejection letter, and the student would never know" that Redwood did not exist.&lt;ref name=wsj/&gt; Ringle claimed he found Redwood mentioned on Asian higher-education [[blog]]s.&lt;ref name=wsj/&gt;

The Redwood website lists a mailing address in [[Torrance, California]], that belongs to a [[mail-forwarding]] company.&lt;ref name=wsj/&gt; That company forwards the mail to [[China]].&lt;ref name=kgw/&gt; It also lists a [[fax]] number with a [[area code 650|650 area code]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uredwood.com/|title=University of Redwood|publisher=University of Redwood|accessdate=2011-02-27|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110213023612/http://uredwood.com/|archivedate=2011-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is assigned to the Bay Area south of [[San Francisco, California]].

'''World War II in Yugoslav Macedonia''' started with the [[Axis occupation of Yugoslavia]]. [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonian]] communist Partisans of the [[People's Liberation Army of Macedonia]], part of the [[Yugoslav Partisan movement]], started a political and [[military campaign]] on 11 October 1941 to resist the occupation of [[Vardar Macedonia]] by Bulgarian, German, Italian, and Albanian forces. Officially, the area was called then [[Vardar Banovina]], because the very name ''Macedonia'' was prohibited in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Bloxham, The Final Solution: A Genocide, OUP Oxford, 2009, {{ISBN|0199550336}}, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chris Kostov, Contested Ethnic Identity: The Case of Macedonian Immigrants in Toronto, Peter Lang, 2010, {{ISBN|3034301960}}, p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Bulgaria switched sides in the war [[Bulgarian coup d'état of 1944|in September 1944]], the Bulgarian 5th. Army stationed in Macedonia, moved back to the old borders of Bulgaria. In the early October the newly formed [[Bulgarian People's Army]] together with the [[Red Army]] reentered occupied Yugoslavia to blocking the German forces withdrawing from Greece. Vardar Macedonia was liberated in end of November when [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|communist Yugoslavia]] was established. 

The operation was called the '''National Liberation War of Macedonia''' ({{lang-mk|Народноослободителна борба на Македонија, Narodnoosloboditelna borba na Makedonija}}) by the Partisans, in line with the greater [[Yugoslav People's Liberation War]], but combatants also developed further aspirations over the geographic region of [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]]. It marked the defeat of [[Bulgarian nationalism]] and  the victory of [[Macedonism]] in the area.

==Background==
The [[Balkan Wars]] in [[First Balkan War|1912]] and [[Second Balkan War|1913]], and the [[World War I]] (1914-1918) divided the region of Macedonia amongst the [[Kingdom of Greece]], the [[Kingdom of Bulgaria]] and the [[Kingdom of Serbia]]. The territory was up until that time part of the Ottoman Empire. In those days, the majority of the [[Slavic speakers in Ottoman Macedonia]] considered themselves to be a part of the [[Bulgarian Millet|Bulgarian people]].&lt;ref&gt;During the 20th century, Slavo-Macedonian national feeling has shifted. At the beginning of the 20th century, Slavic patriots in Macedonia felt a strong attachment to Macedonia as a multi-ethnic homeland. They imagined a Macedonian community uniting themselves with non-Slavic Macedonians... Most of these Macedonian Slavs also saw themselves as Bulgarians. By the middle of the 20th. century, however Macedonian patriots began to see Macedonian and Bulgarian loyalties as mutually exclusive. Regional Macedonian nationalism had become ethnic Macedonian nationalism... This transformation shows that the content of collective loyalties can shift.[https://books.google.com/books?id=6RveDmHbIv8C&amp;pg=PA147 ''Region, Regional Identity and Regionalism in Southeastern Europe, Ethnologia Balkanica Series'', Klaus Roth, Ulf Brunnbauer, LIT Verlag Münster, 2010, p. 127.], {{ISBN|3825813878}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"At the end of the World War I there were very few historians or ethnographers, who claimed that a separate Macedonian nation existed... Of those Slavs who had developed some sense of national identity, the majority probably considered themselves to be Bulgarians, although they were aware of differences between themselves and the inhabitants of Bulgaria... The question as of whether a Macedonian nation actually existed in the 1940s when a Communist Yugoslavia decided to recognize one is difficult to answer. Some observers argue that even at this time it was doubtful whether the Slavs from Macedonia considered themselves to be a nationality separate from the Bulgarians.

Danforth, Princeton University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|0-691-04356-6}}, pp. 65-66.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Until the late 19th century both outside observers and those Bulgaro-Macedonians who had an ethnic consciousness believed that their group, which is now two separate nationalities, comprised a single people, the Bulgarians. Thus the reader should ignore references to ethnic Macedonians in the Middle ages which appear in some modern works. In the Middle ages and into the 19th century, the term ‘Macedonian’ was used entirely in reference to a geographical region. Anyone who lived within its confines, regardless of nationality could be called a Macedonian...Nevertheless, the absence of a national consciousness in the past is no grounds to reject the Macedonians as a nationality today." "The Early Medieval Balkans: A Critical Survey from the Sixth to the Late Twelfth Century," John Van Antwerp Fine, University of Michigan Press, 1991, {{ISBN|0472081497}}, pp. 36–37.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1912 until 1915 the territory of [[Vardar Macedonia]] remained within the territory of Serbia. In the parts administred by Serbia the new authorities forced out most of the Bulgarian priests and teachers, and began implementing a forceful state-sponsored [[Serbianisation]] of Slavic-speaking Macedonians. It was occupied by Kingdom of Bulgaria during World War I between 1915 and 1918. Afterwards it was restored back to Serbia and consequently included as part of the [[Vardar Banovina]] in the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]. During that period, there were two main autonomist agendas. The right-wing [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization]] (IMRO) led by Ivan Mihailov, was in favor of the creation of a pro-Bulgarian Macedonian state under German and Italian protection.

The leftist [[IMRO (United)]] group, who merged with the communists prior to the beginning of the war, favored creation of an independent "Soviet Macedonia" within a Balkan Federation. This option was supported by [[Pavel Shatev]], [[Dimitar Vlahov]], [[Metodi Shatorov]], [[Panko Brashnarov]], and others. However such Macedonian activists, who came from the Bulgarian Communist Party, never managed to get rid of their pro-Bulgarian bias.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, S. and R. King Yugoslav Communism and the Macedonian Question, Archon Books (June 1971), p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the interwar period in Vardar Macedonia, some young locals repressed by the Serbs, tried to find a separate Macedonian way of national development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bNvbHCUs3tUC&amp;pg=PA229&amp;dq=macedonian+consciousness+vardar+macedonia+interwar+period&amp;hl=bg&amp;ei=KI3bTv_1H8Sp-gayu9XKDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=macedonian%20consciousness%20vardar%20macedonia%20interwar%20period&amp;f=false |title=Politics, power, and the struggle for democracy in South-East Europe|author1=Karen Dawisha|author2=Bruce Parrott|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|date=1997|isbn=0-521-59733-1|page=229}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the existence of considerable Macedonian national consciousness prior to the middle of 1940s is disputed.&lt;ref&gt;Loring M.

==Occupation of Macedonia==

===Invasion of Yugoslavia===
Fearing an invasion of the World War II [[Axis Powers]], Regent [[Prince Paul of Yugoslavia]] signed the [[Tripartite Pact]] on 25 March 1941, pledging cooperation with the Axis.

On 27 March, the regime of Prince Paul was overthrown by a military [[Yugoslav coup d'état|coup d'état]] with British support. The 17-year-old [[Peter II of Yugoslavia]] was declared to be of age and placed in power. General [[Dušan Simović]] became his Prime Minister. The Kingdom of Yugoslavia withdrew its support for the Axis ''de facto'' without formally renouncing the Pact. On 6 April 1941 the German armed forces (''[[Wehrmacht]]'') launched the [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invasion of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] and quickly conquered it.

===Division Macedonian region of southern Yugoslavia===
A division of Vardar Macedonia then part of so called [[Vardar Banovina]] was drawn up on 19 and 20 April 1941. Bulgarian troops entered the central and eastern parts and seized most of the banovina, including parts of Eastern Sebia and of today Kosovo. The prominent force which occupied most of the area was the [[Fifth Army (Bulgaria)|5th Army]]. The westernmost parts of Macedonia were occupied by the fascist [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Kingdom of Italy]].

===Collaborationist organizations===
'''Bulgarian action committees''' – After the defeat of the Yugoslav army, a group of [[Macedonian Bulgarians]] headed by Spiro Kitincev arrived in Macedonia and started preparations for the coming of the Bulgarian army and administration in Macedonia.&lt;ref name="Ѓорѓи Малковски"&gt;''Профашистичките и колаборационистичките организации и групи во Македонија 1941–1944 година'' Ѓорѓи Малковски.

'''Ivan Mihailov's IMRO in Macedonia''' – After the military [[Bulgarian coup d'état of 1934]] the new Bulgarian government banned IMRO as a terrorist organization. [[Ivan Mihailov]] fled to Italy, where he made contact with the Italian fascist authorities and with members of the German secret service ([[Gestapo]]). After the defeat of Yugoslavia, Mihailov went to [[Zagreb]] and spent the war there with [[Ante Pavelić]]. He revitalized parts of his old organisation and ordered them to enter Vardar Macedonia and infiltrate the local Bulgarian administration, waiting for an opportunity to take over control and create a pro-German Macedonian state. Although Nazi Germany gave Bulgaria the right to annex the greater part of Vardar Macedonia, the Gestapo had contacts with Mihailov and his men in Bulgaria and Vardar Macedonia. This was in order to have a "reserve card" in case of things going wrong in Bulgaria{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}.

Composed of former IMRO-activists, the first kontračeta was formed in [[Veles (city)|Veles]] in the end of 1942 in order to limit [[Partisan (military)|partisan]] and Serbian Chetnik Movement activities in the region.

==1941 – Beginning of the resistance movement==
[[File:MetodiShatarov.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Metodija Shatorov was the leader of Macedonian communists in 1941. He refused to  contact with CPY and chose to join BCP. Later his supporters were heavily repressed for their anti-Yugoslav political positions.]]
In 1941 the regional committee of the [[Communist Party of Yugoslavia]] (RC of CPY) for Vardar Macedonia was headed by [[Metodi Shatorov]] ("Sharlo") from [[Prilep]]. After the Bulgarian  takeover of [[Vardarska Banovina]] in April 1941, the Macedonian communists fell in the sphere of influence of the BCP under Sharlo's leadership.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6WC5AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=Shatorov+bulgarian&amp;dq=Shatorov+bulgarian&amp;lr=&amp;hl=bg&amp;pgis=1 ''Historical dictionary of the Republic of Macedonia''],  Valentina Georgieva, Sasha Konechni, Scarecrow Press, 1998, {{ISBN|0-8108-3336-0}}, p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt; When the directive for the organization of an armed resistance movement in all regions of occupied Yugoslavia was issued, Sharlo disobeyed the order.&lt;ref name="По врвулиците"&gt;"По врвулиците на македонската историја" Иван Катарџиев. Скопје, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; Sharlo answered the Central Committee (CC) of the CPY that the situation in Macedonia did not allow an immediate engagement with military action, but rather first propaganda activity should occur, and afterward formation of military units. On the other hand, he refused to define the Bulgarian forces as occupiers (contrary to instructions from [[Belgrade]]) and called for the incorporation of the local Macedonian Communist organizations into the [[Bulgarian Communist Party]] (BCP). The Macedonian Regional Committee refused to remain in contact with CPY and linked up with BCP. Sharlo refused to distribute a proclamation of the YCP which called for military action against Bulgarians.&lt;ref&gt;"Зборник докумената и података о народоослободплачком рату jугословенских народа", т. VII, кн. 1, Борбе у Македониjи. Београд, 1952, с. XII и 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

At that time, the [[Comintern]] had a different agenda for the resolution of the fate of Macedonia – an independent Macedonian state governed by a majority population of [[ethnic Macedonians]]. This idea was confirmed by the Resolution of the Comintern from 1934, and was supported by the BCP, the [[Communist Party of Greece]] (CPG), and the CPY. In 1939 the CPY started promoting the idea of formation of a Macedonian state, but within a Yugoslav federation. Shatorov was opposed to the second option and was a partisan of the Comintern agenda, which proposed a creation of a "Soviet Macedonia".&lt;ref name="НОБ на Македонија"&gt;"НОБ на Македонија" Јован Поповски. Скопје, 1962&lt;/ref&gt; While the Bulgarian Communists avoided organizing mass armed uprising against the Bulgarian authorities, the Yugoslav Communists insisted that no liberation could be achieved without an armed revolt.

Because of this conflict within the RC of CPY in Macedonia, in Vardar Macedonia there was no resistance movement. At the start of World War II, the Comintern supported a policy of [[non-intervention]], arguing that the war was an imperialist war between various national ruling classes. But when the [[USSR]] was attacked by Nazi Germany, the Comintern issued a directive ordering the beginning of communist resistance movements in all fascist occupied territories in Europe, so the RC of CPY for Macedonia began organizing resistance in their area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kroraina.com/knigi/partiz.html Кои беа партизаните во Македонија] Никола Петров, Скопје, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; The RC, headed by Shatorov, immediately ordered the formation of [[Partisan (military)|partisan]] units, the first of which was formed in the Skopje region on 22 August 1941, and attacked Bulgarian guards on 8 September 1941 in Bogomila, near Skopje. At that time, with the help of the Comintern and of [[Joseph Stalin]] himself a decision was taken and the Macedonian Communists were attached to CPY.&lt;ref&gt;Open Society Archives – Folder Report: 79-4-361 Vukmanovic Describes Conflict with Bulgarians, Slobodan Stankovic, 11 February 1971 [http://files.osa.ceu.hu/holdings/300/8/3/text/79-4-361.shtml]&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after this Shatorov lost his popularity within the CPY and was discredited.

People loyal to the CPY were next appointed as leaders of the RC with [[Lazar Koliševski]] as a secretary.&lt;ref name="Вчера и денес: Македонија"&gt;"Вчера и денес: Македонија" Јован Павловски, Мишел Павловски. Скопје, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; He was sent in September in Skopje. The new leadership began formation of partisan detachments. Armed insurgents from the Prilep Partisan Detachment attacked Axis occupied zones in the city of [[Prilep]], notably a Bulgarian [[police station]], on 11 October 1941.&lt;ref name="Вчера и денес: Македонија" /&gt; This date is considered to be the symbolic beginning of the Macedonian Resistance. The Prilep detachment was active until December 1941, when it split in three groups – the first in Skopje, the second in Tikves, and the third in Bitola. However, in November the new leader of the RC - Koliševski was arrested and sentenced to death by a Bulgarian military court. He wrote two appeals for clemency to Bulgarian Tsar and to Defense Minister, insisting on his Bulgarian origin. As result his death sentence was commuted to life imprisonment, and Koliševski was send to a prison in Pleven, Bulgaria.

While the Sharlo's leadership was terminated, the vestiges of his policy among part of the local communist activists were preserved. After the arrest of [[Lazar Koliševski]] in November, the new executive body of the Macedonian Regional Committee continued to share Shatorov's pro-Bulgarian ideas and re-established close contact with the BCP.&lt;ref&gt;Roumen Daskalov, Diana Mishkova eds., Entangled Histories of the Balkans - Volume Two,	BRILL, 2013, {{ISBN|9004261915}}, p. 534.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bane Andreev]] of Veles, a new party secretary for Macedonia, expressed this same ideology. He thought that the Macedonian people believe in Bulgaria's role as liberator and that no Macedonian wants to fight against the Bulgarian soldiers. That the Macedonians should respond positively to the mobilization call being carried out by the Bulgarian authorities and join the Bulgarian army.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia Jugoslavie'' volume 7, 1955, p. 686.&lt;/ref&gt; Tito did not agree with that. During the spring of 1942 Andreev was arrested by Bulgarian police.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitar Bechev, Historical Dictionary of the Republic of Macedonia, Scarecrow Press, 2009, {{ISBN|0810862956}}, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, a factionalist struggle between the pro-Bulgarian and the pro-Yugoslav lines exacerbated. Thus [[Cvetko Uzunovski]] created a provisional regional committee that tried to take over the pro-Bulgarian faction, but without much success.&lt;ref&gt;Ivo Banac, With Stalin Against Tito: Cominformist Splits in Yugoslav Communism, Cornell University Press, 1988, {{ISBN|0801421861}}, pp. 196-197.&lt;/ref&gt; This policy changed since 1943 with the arrival of the Tito's envoy [[Montenegrin Serb]] [[Svetozar Vukmanović-Tempo]].

In the beginning of 1942, several new [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisan]] detachments were formed. In May 1942 in the village of [[Lisec (Tetovo Municipality)|Lisec]], the [[Veles (city)|Veles]] partisan detachment ''Pere Toshev'' was formed. It had three successful battles against the Bulgarian police: on Mount Lisec, in [[Kriva Krusha]], and [[Vojnica]]. In July this detachment merged with the newly formed 2nd Prilep detachment under the name ''Dimitar Vlahov''. The detachment had several successful battles on Mount [[Mukos]]. In November 1942 in [[Crveni Steni]] near Prilep, the 3rd Prilep detachment ''Gjorce Petrov'' was formed.&lt;ref name="Партизанските одреди"&gt;"Партизанските одреди на Народноослободителната војска на Македонија во ослободителната војна и револуцијата 1941–1944" Миле Тодоровски.

[[File:Debar,_beganje_pred_balisti,_1942.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Reception of refugees, escaped from Albanian occupation zone in Macedonia (Debar, 1942), in Ohrid, Bulgarian occupation zone.]]
On 22 April 1942 in the village of [[Lavci]], near [[Bitola]], the ''Pelister'' detachment was formed. It was involved in several battles against the Bulgarians, but in November it was dispersed as the result of a battle against a much stronger Bulgarian army and police force near [[Orehovo (Macedonia)|Orehovo]], when 2/3 of its forces were killed. On 6 June 1942 in the village of [[Zlatari (Resen Municipality)|Zlatari]] on [[Bigla]] Mountain, the Bitola-[[Prespa]] partisan detachment ''Dame Gruev'' was formed. This unit engaged in some very successful political agitation and had several military successes, such as an attack on the troops in the village of [[Smilevo]] on 2 August 1942, and an attack on the police station in [[Kažani]]. In November 1942, the detachment split in three groups – the first remained on Bigla, the second went to northern Prespa, and the third went to southern Prespa. The third group of the ''Dame Gruev'' detachment mobilized men from the ethnic Macedonian villages in [[Mala Prespa]] and succeeded in liberating territory in Mala Prespa and part of Greek Prespa. This was the first territory liberated by Macedonian partisans during the war.&lt;ref name="НОБ на Македонија" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Партизанските одреди" /&gt;

On 16 April 1942 the [[Krushevo]] detachment ''Pitu Guli'' was formed which waged several battles against the Bulgarian army and police, the most important of which were the battles in [[Pribilci]], [[Kocishte]] and [[Cer, Macedonia|Cer]]. In September 1942 the 2nd Bitola detachment ''Jane Sandanski'' was formed. The fighters of this detachment conducted political speeches in the villages and made sneak attacks on Bulgarian troops such as an attack on the railway station in [[Beranci]] in December 1942. In October 1942 the ''Shar Planina'' partisan detachment was formed near [[Tetovo]] out of Macedonian and Albanian communists. This detachment had success promoting [[Brotherhood and Unity]] among the people in Tetovo. In 1942, in the village of [[Mavrovo (village)|Mavrovo]], the ''Mavrovo'' partisan detachment was formed.

In 1942 a group of young communists from [[Shtip]] assembled on [[Plackovica]] Mountain in order to form a detachment, but the group was located and destroyed by the Bulgarian police before they could receive their weapons. Groups of communists that were planning to form partisan detachments were arrested due to informants in [[Strumica]] and [[Kočani]]. The successful actions of the Bulgarian secret police prevented the creation of partisan units in eastern Macedonia in 1942.

Partisan activity was coordinated by the Headquarters of the National Liberation Partisan Detachments of Macedonia (HQ of NLPDM), which was established in July 1942 by Macedonian communists of the CPY and was headed by [[Mihailo Apostolski]].&lt;ref name="Вчера и денес: Македонија" /&gt;

==1943==
[[File:Ustanak u Jugoslaviji 1943.png|thumb|250px|Resistance in Yugoslavia after the [[capitulation of Italy]], September 1943. In Macedonia the partisan activity is concentratet in former Italian occupation zone ceded to Albania.]]

===Support from the CC of the CPY===
Although several Macedonian partisan detachments were formed through the end of 1942 which fought battles against the Bulgarian, Italian, [[Nazi Germany|German]] and Albanian occupation forces and despite Sofia's ill-managed administration, most Macedonian Communists had yet to be lured to Yugoslavia. Between 1941 and 1943, Tito have sent five emissaries to Macedonia, to persuade his ill-disciplined comrades, but their efforts had limited success, and the Regional Committee was de facto under the control of the BCP.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitris Livanios, The Macedonian Question: Britain and the Southern Balkans 1939-1949, OUP Oxford, 2008, {{ISBN|0191528722}}, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; To change that, in the beginning of 1943 the [[Montenegrins (ethnic group)|Montenegrin]] [[Svetozar Vukmanović-Tempo]] was sent as an assistant to the HQ of the Macedonian partisan forces. Tempo tried  to organize an energetic struggle against the occupying forces. He was supposed to set up a Macedonian Communist Party within the framework of the Yugoslav one. One of his objectives was to destroy the influence of the BCP in Macedonia and to fight against any form of [[autonomism]]. He would have to "Macedonianize" the struggle’s form and content,  and to give it an ethnic Macedonian facade. One of his main achievements was also that the wartime pro-Bulgarian trend receded into the background of pro-Yugoslav one. Kolisevski was able to capitalize on the growing contradictions towards Bulgarian authorities, which during 1942 were involved into a policy of centralization, contradicting their initial agenda to respect Macedonian autonomy. Yugoslav communists proclaimed as their aim the issue of unification of the three regions of Macedonia – Yugoslav, Greek and Bulgarian, and so managed to get also Macedonian nationalists.

===Formation of the Communist Party of Macedonia (CPM)===
[[File:Italo-Bulgarian 1941.jpg|thumb|250px|Italian and Bulgarian military on the border between Albania and Bulgaria in Macedonia in front of dismantled machine gun Schwarzlose.]]
The leadership of the Regional Committee of the CPY for Macedonia decided to establish a separate Macedonian Communist Party which would be representative of the will of the Macedonian people in the anti-fascist struggle for national liberation. The [[Communist Party of Macedonia]] (CPM) was formed on 19 March 1943 in Tetovo. The first Central Committee (CC of the CPM) was composed as of Yugoslav communists as [[Strahil Gigov]], [[Kuzman Josifovski Pitu]], [[Cvetko Uzunovski]], [[Mara Naceva]] and [[Bane Andreev]].&lt;ref name="Историја на МК"&gt;"Историја на Македонскиот Народ" Александар Стојановски, Иван Катарџиев, Данчо Зографски. Скопје, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

After making a detailed analysis of the military and political situation in the country, the CC of the CPM decided to be directly involved in the fighting and to be stationed side by side with the troops on the battlefield.  The territory of [[Vardar Macedonia]] was divided into five operative zones, and efforts were made to make direct contact with the liberation movements in Albania, Bulgaria and Greece.

Adding to the existing eleven, eight new Macedonian partisan detachments were formed in the summer of 1943 as more and more people entered the ranks of the partisans. They managed to create strongholds in the regions of [[Debarca]], [[Prespa]], [[Kumanovo]], [[Tikvesh]], and [[Gevgelija]]. This allowed for the expansion of the National Liberation Committees and the creation of larger military units, as decided at a conference in Prespa on 2 August 1943. Regular large military units (battalions and brigades) were created as part of the [[People's Liberation Army of Macedonia]] (MNOV). Preparations began for the formation of the [[ASNOM|Anti-Fascist Assembly for the People's Liberation of Macedonia (ASNOM)]], which governed Macedonia from August 1944 until the end of World War II.

===Formation of the People's Liberation Army of Macedonia===
{{Main article|People's Liberation Army of Macedonia}}
[[File:Bataljon Stiv Naumov, 1943.jpg|thumb|250px|Partisans of the battalion "[[Stiv Naumov]]", set up in November 1943 in [[Prespa|Gorna Prespa]].]]
Creation of larger Macedonian military units started immediately after the Prespa conference. The first one to be created was the ''Mirče Acev'' Battalion, which was formed on 18 August 1943 on Mount Slavej.&lt;ref name="НОБ на Македонија"/&gt; On 24 September 1943 on Mount [[Kožuf]] the battalion ''Straso Pindzur'' was formed, on 30 September the ''Debar Youth'' battalion, on 11 November near Bitola the ''Stiv Naumov'' battalion, and on 1 December the [[Kumanovo]] battalion ''Orce Nikolov''.&lt;ref name="Партизанските одреди" /&gt;

On 8 September Italy capitulated. Italian garrisons disarmed by the MNOV included those in [[Gostivar]], [[Debar]], [[Kicevo]] and [[Ljubojno]]. Some were attacked by units of the MNOV while they were trying to reach the Albanian border and flee Macedonia. The arms and ammunition that were captured gave the opportunity to create new battalions and even brigades. After the disarming of the Italians, a vast territory was liberated which stretched from Gostivar to the north of [[Struga]] and [[Ohrid]]. The freed territory included the towns Debar and Kicevo.&lt;ref name="Историја на Македонскиот народ"&gt;"Историја на Македонскиот народ" том.3&lt;/ref&gt;

In the freed territories a provisional people's authority was established, led by the National Liberation Committees. Meetings were being held everywhere propagating the causes of the National Liberation Struggle and the right of Macedonians and other nationalities to self-determination. The first schools in which the [[Macedonian language]] was taught were created in this free territory in 1943. The whole population, both male and female, was included in the struggle – the men were mobilized in militias and were given short military training and the women were organized in the [[Women's Antifascist Front of Macedonia]]).&lt;ref name="Историја на Македонскиот народ" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ослободителната војна"&gt;"Ослободителната војна на Македонскиот народ (1941–1944)" Михајло Апостолски. Скопје, 1965&lt;/ref&gt;
In October 1943 the HQ of the People's Liberation Army of Macedonia issued a manifesto to the Macedonian people and all other nationalities in Macedonia (as stated in the manifesto: [[Aromanians]], Albanians and [[Turkish people|Turks]]) to join the fight of the Macedonian National Liberation Army to win freedom and create a free [[Socialist Republic of Macedonia]]. The manifesto also called for struggle against the reactionary Serbian, Albanian and Bulgarian elements ([[Chetniks]], Balli Kombëtar and IMRO agents).&lt;ref&gt;"Документи за борбата на Македонскиот народ за независност", том II.

[[File:The Holocaust Museum in Skopje 29.JPG|250px|right|thumb|Original wagon used for transport of the Macedonian Jews - on display at the [[Holocaust Museum in Skopje]], Republic of Macedonia.]]
During the Summer of 1943, meetings were held between representatives of the [[National Liberation Front (Greece)]] and the [[Military history of Albania during World War II#The beginning of the Albanian Communist Party and the National Liberation Movement|Albanian resistance]]. [[Svetozar Vukmanović-Tempo]] put forward the idea of a joint [[Balkan]] Headquarters to exercise supreme control over the partisan movements in Yugoslavia, Albania, Bulgaria, and Greece. Tempo asked for recognition of the ethnic Macedonian people's right to self-determination, as well as permission for the partisans from Vardar Macedonia to extend their activity among the Slavic-speaking population in Greek Macedonia. As a result, the [[SNOF|Slavic-Macedonian National Liberation Front]] (SNOF) was established in 1943 in Greek Macedonia by ethnic Macedonian communists, members of the [[Communist Party of Greece]] (KKE).

On 11 November 1943 in the village of [[Slivovo, Republic of Macedonia|Slivovo]] the First Macedonian-Kosovo Brigade was formed out of three Macedonian battalions and one battalion from fascist Italian occupied [[Kosovo]]. Regions controlled by the partisans now included [[Debarca municipality|Debarca]], [[Mavrovo and Rostuša municipality|Mavrovo, and Rostuša]], within Italy's occupied territory.

Immediately after the establishment of the free territory in western Vardar Macedonia, the German command made an incursion into the areas held by the provisional authority. The problem for the Germans was the fact that the free territory was cutting off communications between [[Skopje]] and [[Kastoria|northeastern Greece]]. After assembling two divisions and artillery units, the Macedonian forces started operations to re-capture the territory.  The struggle lasted more than two months, with the most important battles being at [[Buković]], [[Debarca]], [[Kicevo]] and Slivovo. The town of Kicevo was recaptured by the Germans in the beginning of November, but three days later it once again fell to Macedonian partisan hands, to be later re-captured for the second time by the German troops.

The High Command of the People's Liberation Army of Macedonia together with the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Macedonia decided to take evasive maneuvers in order to avoid total destruction of the Macedonian forces because of the overwhelming number of enemy troops engaged. Only few small units were left behind. After more than two months of constant battles, in December 1943 the Macedonian MNOV together with the CC of the CPM started a massive retreat through Prespa and after a 13-day march entered Greek Macedonia.

Bulgaria managed to save its entire 48,000-strong Jewish population during World War II from deportation to [[Nazi concentration camps]], but under German pressure those Jews from their newly annexed territories without Bulgarian citizenship were deported, such as those from Vardar Macedonia and [[Western Thrace]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/article.php?lang=en&amp;ModuleId=10006804 ''The Holocaust in Macedonia: Deportation of Monastir Jewry''] [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]]&lt;/ref&gt; The Bulgarian government was responsible for the roundup and deportation of over 7,000 Jews in Skopje and [[Bitola]].

The Bulgarian authorities created a special [[Gendarmerie]] force which received almost unlimited power to pursue the Communist partisans in the whole kingdom. The gendarmes became notorious for carrying out atrocities against captured partisans and their supporters{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}. Harsh rule by the occupying forces and a number of [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] victories showing that the Axis might lose the war encouraged more Macedonians to support the Communist Partisan resistance movement of Josip Broz Tito.

Many former IMRO members assisted the Bulgarian authorities in fighting Tempo's partisans.  With the help of the Bulgarian government and former IMRO members, several pro-Bulgarian paramilitary detachments ([[Uhrana]]) were organized in occupied Greek Macedonia in 1943. These were led by Bulgarian officers originally from Greek Macedonia and charged with protecting the local population in the zones under German and Italian control. Around this time [[Ivan Mihailov]] of IMRO had plans which envisaged the creation of a Macedonian state under German control. He was a follower of the idea of a united Macedonian state with a dominant Bulgarian element.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vest.com.mk/default.asp?id=3372&amp;idg=1&amp;idb=215&amp;rubrika=Revija Beсник "Вест", Година:1 Број:215 Сабота 3/24/2001]&lt;/ref&gt; It was anticipated by the Germans that members of IMRO would form the core of the armed forces of a future Independent Macedonia led by Ivan Mihailov.

==1944 and aftermath==

===February Campaign===
[[File:Miting u oslobođenom Kičevu 26. IX 1943.jpg|thumb|230px|Public rally in liberated Kičevo after capitulation of Italy in Albanian zone, 26 September 1943.]]
After passing through the whole of western Greek Macedonia, the main forces of the People's Liberation Army of Macedonia were stationed in the [[Almopia]] region in Greece close to the Yugoslav border. The Partisan detachments that were active in Gevgelia and Tikvesh also crossed the border into northern Greece and met with the main forces of the MNOV. Several meetings were held with members of [[Greek People's Liberation Army|ELAS]] and the [[Greek Communist Party]]. One of the decisions was the creation of wider partisan detachments composed of the ethnic Macedonian minority in Greece. On 20 December 1943 in the village of [[Fustani]] in the [[Pella]] district of Greece, the Second Macedonian Assault Brigade was formed out of the 3 battalions of the 3rd operative zone. The Bulgarian ''Hristo Botev'' partisan battalion of the MNOV was formed out of captured and escaped Bulgarian soldiers. It was under the command of the HQ of MNOV. The rest of the fighters that were not included in the First Macedonian-Kosovo Assault Brigade and the Second Macedonian Assault Brigade (the ''Hristo Botev'' and ''Stiv Naumov'' battalion together with several smaller partisan detachments) were organized into the so-called "Third Group of Battalions". The provisional HQ of the reorganized MNOV was stationed in the village of Fustani in the Pella district. Because the massive concentration of MNOV troops in the Moglena district was jeopardizing the [[Axis powers|Axis]] communication to [[Thessaloniki]], Bulgarian and German forces launched an incursion against the MNOV in Moglena and at Mount Kozuv. The fighting lasted from 26 December till 18 January. All Axis attacks were repelled, and Mount Kozuf remained a free territory held by the MNOV.&lt;ref name="Мегленската област"&gt;"Мегленската област во народноослоодителното движење на Егејска Македонија", Христо Андоновски.

[[File:Da živi bratstvo makedonskog i albanskog naroda.jpg|thumb|250px|Albanian and Macedonian Partisans marching with a transparant. It reads: "To live the fraternity of the Macedonian and Albanian people!"]]
After the fight for Mount Kozuf, the Headquarters of the MNOV decided to launch a three-phase offensive in central and eastern Vardar Macedonia against the fascist occupation forces – known as the "February March". In accordance with the February March plan, on 31 January 1944 the First Macedonian-Kosovo Assault Brigade started marching towards the [[Veles (city)|Veles]] and [[Porech]] regions, but immediately after crossing the border, the Brigade was attacked by two Bulgarian divisions. After constant fighting in cold weather, on 14 February the brigade returned to [[Greek Macedonia]]. Although it did not fulfill its mission because of the energetic counter-attacks of the Bulgarians, the First Brigade engaged two divisions of the Bulgarian 5th Army in that region. This opened a gap for the Third Group of Brigades together with CPM and the HQ of MNOV to pass through eastern Macedonia. The Second Macedonian Assault Brigade conducted incursions from 31 January till mid 1944 from [[Kozuf]] to [[Gevgelia]] and [[Demir Kapija]] regions, disrupting the Bulgarian authority in the villages and closing Bulgarian schools. On 31 January the Third Group of Brigades together with the HQ of the MNOV and the CC of the CPM started marching from the village of Zborsko to eastern Vardar Macedonia. 23 days later, after 400&amp;nbsp;km of travel through five mountain ranges in terrible weather and constant engagements with Bulgarian army units, the Third Group of Battalions was in partisan held territory near [[Kumanovo]]. There it made contacts with the forces in [[Pčinja District]] and the [[Bulgarian resistance movement during World War II|Bulgarian Resistance]].&lt;ref name="Историја на МК" /&gt; The ''Hristo Botev'' battalion, which was until then under the command of the MNOV of Macedonia, was transferred to the Bulgarian resistance command.

The 3rd Battalion Group merged with the two existing Macedonian battalions in [[Kumanovo]] region and formed the famous Third Macedonian Assault Brigade in the Kumanovo village of [[Zegljane]] on 26 February 1944.&lt;ref name="Дневник 1" /&gt; After its formation, the Third Macedonian Assault Brigade became the biggest partisan formation in Macedonia and Southern Serbia.

In [[South Morava]], [[Serbs|Serbian]] [[Chetniks]] held the terrain, supported by the Germans. The Chetniks prevented the communists from organising in that area. After a meeting in [[Prohor Pčinjski]] monastery it was decided the command of the South Moravian and Kosovo partisan detachments would be given to the HQ of MNOV of Macedonia, as it was the most organized and most experienced. The first objective of the HQ of MNOV after the expansion of its command region was the destruction of the Chetnik movement in Macedonia and Pčinja District, starting with the Chetniks stationed in Vardar Macedonia.

===Destruction of the Vardar Chetnik Corps===
As of 1941, attempts were made to create a Serbian loyalist movement in Vardar Macedonia. A few bands were formed in [[Veles (city)|Veles]], [[Prilep]] and [[Strumica]], mainly by war veterans and by former Chetnik leaders. These groups were few in numbers, decentralized, and some were formed under their own initiative.  By mid 1942 all of them were destroyed by units of the Bulgarian army. At the beginning of 1943, in order to organize a strong Chetnik force in Vardar Macedonia, and in order to destroy the group influenced by [[Kosta Pecanac]], [[Draža Mihailović]] sent in Lieutenant [[Milivoje Trbić]]. He quickly organized local committees in [[Skopje]], Veles, [[Kicevo]] and [[Gostivar]] and started recruiting volunteers among the [[Serbs of Macedonia]]. Soon the [[Vardar Chetnik Corps]] (VCC) was formed headed by [[Stojan Krstić]] (a native of Prilep), which had about 8,000 fighters in Vardar Macedonia.&lt;ref name="НОБ на Македонија" /&gt;

After the formation of the first battalions of the Macedonian National Liberation Army, the VCC directed all of its efforts to destroying the liberation movement of the Macedonian people. The [[Porech]] Chetnik Brigade terrorized the villages that supported the partisans and started conducting forced mobilization{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}. This stimulated anger against the Chetniks and pushed more volunteers into the ranks of the partisan army. In December 1943 the High Command gave [[Hristijan Todorovski Karpoš]] the task of destroying the Chetniks in the [[Skopska Crna Gora]] region in Skopje and [[Kozjak (Kumanovo)|Kozjak]] in [[Kumanovo]]. With detachments from Kumanovo and Skopje, he attacked the Chetniks in three battles, the most important of which occurred near the village of [[Dragomance]] at the end of 1943. This battle brought to an end the Chetnik presence in the Kumanovo region. By end of January the Chetniks in Kicevo and Skopska Crna Gora were disarmed by the MNOV. The Porech Chetnik brigade also capitulated, and those fighters entered the ranks of the Porech partisan battalion.&lt;ref&gt;"Четничката организација на Дража Михајловиќ во Прилеп и Прилепско" (Зборник: Прилеп и Прилепско во НОВ 1944–1945, I/2) Фиданова Славка. Скопје, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; After being defeated in Dragomance and Porech, the remaining Chetniks from various scattered brigades merged and concentrated in the Kozjak area on the border with Serbia, where they managed to occupy all of the villages.

The Serbian Chetniks holding the mountain villages in Kozjak presented a real obstacle for the Partisans, depriving them of the strategic mountain areas in their struggle against the Bulgarian army. Also, the Vardar Chetnik Corps started a massive attack on the Partisans, which made the situation even worse.

At the end of January 1944, the High Command of the MNOV decided to launch an offensive, with the intention of destroying the VCC. On 29 February 1944 the partisans of the Third Macedonian Assault Brigade attacked the Chetnik flanks from north, west and south, while the Hristo Botev detachment hit the Chetniks from the east. In the battle for the village of [[Sejac]], the Vardar Chetnik Corps was totally destroyed, suffering 53 casualties (46 shot by partisans and 7 drowned in the river [[Pčinja (river)|Pčinja]] while attempting to flee). 97 Chetniks, including 5 officers, were captured in the action. On 3 March 1944 in the village of [[Novo Selo (Trgovište)|Novo Selo]], Partisan fighters destroyed the remaining force, capturing 30 Chetniks and more than 100 rifles and ammunition. The Serbian Chetniks suffered 12 dead, including Stojan Krstić, their commander. After these decisive battles Draža Mihailović's Chetnik organization ceased to exist as a powerful force in Macedonia.&lt;ref name="НОБ на Македонија" /&gt; Various local Chetnik bands, decentralized and acting on their own accord, such as the Porech Chetniks, continued to operate in certain parts of Macedonia but they were generally scattered and disorganized.

===Actions in northern Vardar Macedonia and south-eastern Serbia===
[[File:Balli Kombetar Debar.jpg|thumb|[[Balli Kombëtar]] forces in [[Debar]]|267x267px]]
The February March campaign of 1944 had a great political and moral impact. The whole Bulgarian 5th Army, all of the Bulgarian police, as well as the army regiments stationed in [[Kjustendil]] and [[Blagoevgrad|Gorna Dzumaja]] were engaged in the battles. After the February March, the Bulgarian government was forced to change its strategy – organization of the fighting would no longer be the responsibility of the police but of the army, and all organizations would be obliged to help the army.

After the operations which ended with the destruction of the Chetniks in Macedonia, the HQ of the MNOV, now acting as supreme commander of the partisan units in Vardar Macedonia, Kosovo and South Morava, decided to engage in three new attacks on the Bulgarian police and administration. On 26 April 1944 the Third Macedonian Assault Brigade together with the Kosovo detachment successfully attacked the city of [[Ristovac]], where 130 Bulgarian soldiers were killed and 20 captured by the Macedonian partisans. On 3 April 1944 the 3rd Macedonian Assault Brigade attacked the mining town of [[Zletovo]], where about 100 miners entered the ranks of the brigade.

===Spring Offensive===
[[File:Делегати на АСНОМ.jpg|thumb|mini|left|200px|Delegates arriving on the first plenary session of ASNOM in August 1944.]]
Because of increased partisan activity, the main supply lines for the German Army group "E" stationed in Greece and Albania were constantly ambushed and jeopardized. In order to obtain control over the supply lines and the wider areas around them, the Bulgarian and German armies organized an offensive in Macedonia and south-east Serbia, as part of the Seventh Anti-Partisan Offensive, also known as the [[Raid on Drvar]]. In this offensive the occupation authorities mobilised the Bulgarian 5th Army, additional Bulgarian troops from Bulgaria, Chetnik forces from [[Vlasotince]] and [[Leskovac]], Greek reactionary PAO units, Albanian Balli Kombëtar from western Macedonia and the whole German [[garrison]] from Kilkis, making a total of 60,000 military and administrative personnel in the area.&lt;ref&gt;Narodnooslobodilachka vojska Jugoslavije. Pregled Razvoja oruzhanih snaga narodnooslobodilachkog pokreta, 1941–45, Belgrade, 1982, 590–815&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, the HQ of the MNOV was making plans to liberate western Macedonia and sent the 1st Macedonian-Kosovo Assault Brigade there. Pushing towards [[Debarca]], the 1st Macedonian-Kosovo Assault Brigade had clashes with the Bulgarians and Germans in [[Zavoj]] and [[Velmej]]. The Germans obtained reinforcements and on 8 May 1944 they counter-attacked. The fighting ended on 20 May 1944 with the Germans being pushed out of the region. After recapturing the Debarca area, more reinforcements became available, so the brigade was split in two brigades – the 1st Macedonian and 1st Kosovo Assault Brigades. Also, two smaller detachments were formed and charged with the objective of spreading the insurrection in [[Azot (region)|Azot]] and [[Porech]].&lt;ref name="Ослободителната војна" /&gt;

Under his leadership, the pro-Bulgarian Regional committee of the communists in Macedonia was disbanded and they were bound up with the Yugoslav communists.]]
In order to prevent the Germans and Bulgarians from taking total control of the action, the MNOV decided to make surprise attacks on enemy positions and to try to exhaust the enemy any way they could. The 2nd Macedonian Assault Brigade was sent to conduct several actions in [[Povardarie]] (central Macedonia) and [[Pelagonia]] near Prilep and Bitola. From 25 April until 22 June 1944, the 2nd Macedonian Assault Brigade attacked enemy forces, positions and garrisons at [[Gradeshnica]], [[Tikveš]], [[Konopište (Macedonia)|Konopishte]], [[Demir Kapija]], [[Strmashevo]], [[Kavadarci]] and [[Negotino]].&lt;ref name="Ослободителната војна" /&gt;

The longest battles were conducted in eastern Macedonia and Pčinja District, where the main German supply lines ([[Vardar]] and [[Great Morava|Morava]]) and those of the Bulgarians (Skopje-Sofia) were jeopardized. The main forces of the occupying armies were concentrated in that area. This position not only controlled the main communication lines, but positioned them to attack the Macedonian, south Serbian, and Bulgarian resistance movements which were stationed in north-eastern Macedonia. In order to confuse the enemy, the MNOV ordered a surprise attack by the 3rd Macedonian Assault Brigade on the city of [[Kratovo, Macedonia|Kratovo]]. After a half-day battle, Kratovo fell into the hands of the partisans.&lt;ref name="НОБ на Македонија" /&gt; The attack and liberation of Kratovo had a great political and military impact in a time when the Germans and Bulgarians were starting a massive offensive, but it did not stop the Nazis. The 3rd Macedonian Assault Brigade was forced to leave Kratovo three days later, and was involved in many clashes with the Axis armies making while their way 10&amp;nbsp;km north of [[Kilkis]] in Greece. There they rested, reorganized, and started a [[counter-offensive]] against the Bulgarians and Germans, battling from Kilkis through eastern Macedonia, passing into Serbia all the way to [[Crna Trava]], where together with the 6th South Moravian Brigade they engaged the enemy in the final battles of this offensive.&lt;ref name="Историја на МК" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ослободителната војна" /&gt;

In the two months of fighting during the Spring Offensive the Axis forces suffered many casualties. In western Macedonia there were 672 killed and 76 captured Axis soldiers, in central Macedonia (Povardarie) there were 180 killed and 88 captured, in eastern Macedonia and south-eastern Serbia there were over 1,060 killed and 498 captured. A large amount of weapons and ammunition was seized.&lt;ref name="НОБ на Македонија" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Историја на МК" /&gt; The newly conscripted men from the freed territories as well as the captured firearms were used to form new brigades and divisions. On 23 July 1944 in Plackovica, the 4th Macedonian Assault Brigade was formed, and was sent to eastern Macedonia in order to make contact with the resistance movement in western Bulgaria.&lt;ref&gt;Шеесет години од формирањето на Четвртата македонска НОУ бригада – Раде Гогов-Црноречки [http://217.16.70.245/default.aspx?pBroj=1531&amp;stID=19407&amp;pR=9]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the beginning of August in Porech the 5th Macedonian Assault Brigade was formed. One week after its formation it managed to destroy the remains of the Porech Chetniks. In western Macedonia the 6th Macedonian Assault Brigade was formed and was immediately given the assignment of clearing the armed forces of the Balli Kombëtar from western Macedonia. By the end of August four new brigades were formed out of newly recruited volunteers – the 7th, 8th, 9th and 10th Assault Brigades. In the village of Sheshkovo the 1st Macedonian Division was formed out of these new brigades.

===ASNOM===
[[File:41va Divizija, 1944.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Formation of a new Partisan detachment near the village of [[Sheshkovo]] in August 1944.]]
On 2 August 1944, on the 41st anniversary of the [[Ilinden Uprising]], the first session of the newly created [[Anti-Fascist Assembly of the National Liberation of Macedonia]] (ASNOM) was held at the St. [[Prohor Pčinjski]] monastery.

In spite of Tito's hopes to the contrary, the presiding committee of ASNOM was dominated by elements that were not known for their pro-Yugoslav sentiments. To the displeasure of those preferring joining the [[SFRJ|Yugoslav Socialist Federation]], [[Metodija Andonov-Čento]] was elected president and [[Panko Brashnarov]] (former member of [[IMRO (United)|IMRO]]) vice-president. The assembly tried to secure as much independence as possible for Yugoslav Macedonia and gave priority to the unification of the three parts of Macedonia.&lt;ref name="Spyridon Sfetas"&gt;Spyridon Sfetas – Autonomist Movements of the Slavophones in 1944. The Attitude of the Communist Party of Greece and the Protection of the Greek-Yugoslav Border, pg. 7 [http://www.macedonian-heritage.gr/downloads/library/Sfetas01.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Several sources state that Chento had made plans for creating an independent Macedonia which would be backed by the USA.&lt;ref name="Chento USA"&gt;Ченто беше за обединета Македонија под протекторат на Америка: Советски документи за дејноста на претседателот на заседанието на АСНОМ [http://217.16.70.245/?pBroj=1539&amp;stID=19947&amp;pR=15]&lt;/ref&gt;

А [[manifesto]] was written outlining the future plans of ASNOM for an independent Macedonian state and declaring the [[Macedonian language]] as the official language of Macedonia.

ASNOM was the governing body of Macedonia from its formation until the end of World War II.

==="Maximalists" and "Minimalists"===

The Manifesto of ASNOM eventually became a compromise between the "maximalists" and the "minimalists" – the unification of the Macedonian people was discussed and propagandized but the decision was ultimately reached that Vardar Macedonia would become a part of the new Communist Yugoslavia.

The proponents of the "maximalist" line were in favor of the creation of an independent United Macedonian state which would have ties with Yugoslavia, but not necessarily inclusion in a Yugoslav Federation. Proponents of this option included Metodija Andonov-Čento, as well as prominent figures of the former IMRO (United) such as Pavel Shatev, Panko Brashnarov, and others. They saw joining Yugoslavia as a form of Serbian dominance over Macedonia, and preferred membership in a Balkan Federation or else complete independence.&lt;ref name="Spyridon Sfetas" /&gt;

Proponents of the "minimalist" line were also for the creation of a Macedonian state, but within the Yugoslavian federation.

These differences were visible in the ASNOM discussions, but they especially came into the open after the final liberation of Macedonia. It must be added that both "maximalist" and "minimalist" lines within the National Liberation Movement in Vardar Macedonia supported the existence of a separate Macedonian identity and were in favor of the creation of a separate state in which the [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonian people]] would have their homeland. The greatest difference between the two lines was whether Macedonia should join Yugoslavia, or exist as an independent country.

===Failed attempt to create Macedonian puppet state===
[[File:Map Nazi 1944.jpg|250px|left|thumb|Map of the Balkan military theater during September 1944 – January 1945.]]
By August 1944, the Soviet Army was approaching the Balkans.

[[File:XV Makedonski korpus, 1945.jpg|250px|thumb|right|XV Macedonian corps on the way to Syrmian Front in January, 1945.]]
In October 1944 more new brigades were formed: In Veles, Skopje and Kumanovo regions, the new 12th, 16th and 18th Assault Brigades were formed; in eastern Macedonia the 13th, 14th, 19th, 20th and 21st Assault Brigades;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.strumicaonline.com/new/display_article.php?aid=3#15 Strumica in WW2]&lt;/ref&gt; and in western Macedonia the 15th Macedonian Assault Brigade. By the end of October 1944 in Vardar Macedonia there were 21 Macedonian, one [[Kosovo|Kosovar]], one Albanian, and the 1st Aegean Macedonian brigade (composed of 1500 armed former [[National Liberation Front (Macedonia)#Slavic-Macedonian National Liberation Front|Slavic-Macedonian National Liberation Front]] (SNOF) members that crossed the border into Vardar Macedonia after [[Greek People's Liberation Army|ELAS]] ordered the dissolution of their unit). The 1st Macedonian Cavalry Brigade and the 1st Macedonian Automobile Brigade were formed using captured equipment, arms, vehicles, and horses. From August until the beginning of November three Engineering Brigades were formed which started repairing the roads. The new brigades were grouped in six new divisions, which made the total force of the People's Liberation Army of Macedonia three Corps composed of seven divisions, consisting of some 66,000 Macedonian Partisans.&lt;ref&gt;Macedonia, its people and history, Stoyan Pribichevich, Pennsylvania State University Press, 1982, {{ISBN|0-271-00315-4}}, p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt; By mid-November 1944 the Germans were completely dislodged from Macedonia, and organs of "People's Authority" were established. The German Brigade ''Angermiler'' was positioned at the [[Kačanik Gorge]]. Skopje was defended by elements of the 22nd Infantry Division and parts of the 11th Luftwaffe Division (which was mainly involved in the fighting in eastern Macedonia), and units from other divisions. Skopje was liberated on 13 November by the 42nd and 50th Macedonian Divisions. After the liberation of Skopje, the HQ of the MNOV sent one artillery and 12 Assault Brigades to western Macedonia, where they enjoyed a decisive victory over the armed forces of the [[Balli Kombëtar]]. After fierce fighting, [[Kicevo]] was liberated on 16 November, [[Gostivar]] on 18 November and [[Tetovo]] on 19 November. During these the MNOV killed or captured 13,000 armed Balli Kombëtar troops (about 90% of their forces).&lt;ref name="НОБ на Македонија" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Историја на МК" /&gt; On 19 November 1944, with the liberation of Tetovo and Gostivar, the Vardar region of Macedonia was completely liberated. Because of constant clashes with the MNOV the retreat of German Army Group E was blocked for 14 days, and during the final operations for the liberation of Macedonia the German troops had considerable loss of manpower and material: The 22nd Grenadier and 11th Luftwaffe Divisions suffered 10% casualties and a 15% loss of equipment.&lt;ref name="Историја на МК" /&gt;

Macedonia gained the respect of its allies through its contribution to the victory over fascism. It gained recognition of the newly established Macedonian Republic by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]], even though within the framework of the Yugoslavian Federation. And through the National Liberation War of Macedonia, for the first time in modern history, the Macedonian people managed to obtain their statehood, nation and language. These events marked the defeat of the [[Bulgarian nationalism]] and  the victory of the [[Macedonism]] in the area.&lt;ref&gt;Macedonia and the Macedonians: A History, Andrew Rossos, Hoover Press, 2008, {{ISBN|9780817948832}}, p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversy===

[[File:Lazar Koliševski, foto.jpg|180px|thumb|right|[[Lazar Kolishevski]] became in late 1944 the Prime Minister of the SR Macedonia. He started a policy fully implementing the pro-Yugoslav line and took hard measures against any opposition.]]

After the liberation the [[Presidium]] of the Anti-Fascist Assembly for the People's Liberation of Macedonia ([[ASNOM]]), which was the governing body of Macedonia, made several statements and actions that were contradictory to the decisions of the Anti-Fascist Council of the People's Liberation of Yugoslavia ([[AVNOJ]]), the Yugoslav executive authority. Tito's General Headquarters sent orders asking the forces of the MNOV to participate in the fighting in the [[Syrmian Front]]  for the final liberation of Yugoslavia. President Metodija Andonov-Čento and his associates debated whether to send the troops to Srem and help liberate Yugoslavia or to advance the troops under his command toward [[Greek Macedonia]] in order to "unify the Macedonian people" into one country.&lt;ref&gt;Методија Андонов – Ченто, Mакедонски Народен Трибун. Ристе Бунтески. Скопје. 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Officers loyal to Andonov-Čento mutinied in the garrison stationed in [[Skopje Fortress]], but the mutiny was suppressed by armed intervention. A dozen officers were shot on the spot, with others sentenced to life imprisonment. Andonov-Čento and his close associates were trying to minimize the ties with Yugoslavia as far as possible and promoted the [[United Macedonia|unification of the Macedonian people into one state]], which was contrary to the decisions of AVNOJ.&lt;ref&gt;Не му се судеше на Ченто, му се судеше на АСНОМ. Урнати табуата за Методија Андонов Ченто.[http://www.makedonskosonce.com/broevis/2005/sonce565_566.pdf/22_24_cento.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; As result Andonov-Čento was replaced by [[Lazar Kolishevski]], who started fully implementing the pro-Yugoslav line. 

The new leadership of the People's Republic of Macedonia headed by Lazar Kolishevski confirmed the decisions of AVNOJ, and Macedonia joined Yugoslavia.  Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, and Slovenia eventually all became part of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] .&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.winne.com/macedonia/bf01.html World Investment News] Macedonia, Historical Events&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unet.com.mk/mian/uprising.htm Unet.com.mk] Uprising!&lt;/ref&gt; The Macedonian national feelings were already ripe at that time as compared to 1941. Subsequently, to wipe out the remaining [[bulgarophile]] sentiments, the new Communist authorities persecuted the right-wing nationalists with the charges of "great-Bulgarian chauvinism".&lt;ref&gt;Contested Ethnic Identity: The Case of Macedonian Immigrants in Toronto, 1900-1996, Chris Kostov , Peter Lang, 2010, {{ISBN|3034301960}}, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; The next task was also to break up all the organisations that opposed the idea of Yugoslavia. So even older left-wing politicians, who were at some degree pro-Bulgarian oriented, were purged from their positions, then isolated, arrested and  imprisoned on fabricated charges, as foreign agents, demanding greater independence, forming of conspirative political groups and the like.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1jSg3lxgSy8C&amp;pg=PA16&amp;lpg=PA16&amp;dq=the+second+session+asnom+lazar&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wUpBqNDmW3&amp;sig=9YdE95VMyj9BWM39iDLrWcN-xz8&amp;hl=bg#v=onepage&amp;q=second%20session%20asnom&amp;f=false Historical dictionary of the Republic of Macedonia], Dimitar Bechev, Scarecrow Press, 2009, {{ISBN|0-8108-5565-8}}, pp. 15-16.&lt;/ref&gt; Besides, many people went throughout the [[labor camp]] of [[Goli Otok]] in the middle 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://catnyp.nypl.org/search/tGoli+Otok.+English/tgoli+otok+english/-2%2C-1%2C0%2CB/frameset&amp;FF=tgoli+otok+english&amp;1%2C1%2C Goli Otok: the island of death : a diary in letters] by Venko Markovski, New York, [[Columbia University Press]], 1984&lt;/ref&gt; The number of the victims is estimated to 50 000, including those killed, imprisoned, deported, sent to forced labor, tortured, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Zoran Todorovski, “Humanosta na makedonskiot komunizam,”  Utrinski vesnik, February 2, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The gloriﬁcation of the Yugoslav Partisan movement became one of the main components of the post-war Yugoslav political propaganda. Despite that, before the Summer of 1944, the Macedonian Partisans were not significant military force. Their activity did not differ from the typically Balkan “[[hajduk]]” traditions as ambushes and lack of military planning. They were ill-equipped and did not have good training. The Partisans received more weapons after the events of the September 9, 1944 when Bulgarian military equipment fell into their hands. On the other hand, it became clear in the autumn of 1944, that  the Bulgarian army was the real force behind the driving the Germans out of eastern Serbia and Macedonia. However the ofﬁcial Yugoslav and later [[Historiography in the Republic of Macedonia|Macedonian historiography]], has played down their role by political grounds. For example, according to Macedonian sources Bulgarians did even not participate in the operations for the capture of Skopje. Nevertheless Skopje was seized not without the decisive role of the Bulgarian troops.&lt;ref&gt;Livanios, Dimitris, The Macedonian Question: Britain and the Southern Balkans 1939-1949, Oxford University Publishing, 2008, {{ISBN|0191528722}}, pp. 118-141.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Palairet, Macedonia: A Voyage through History (Vol. 2), Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2016, {{ISBN|1443888494}}, p. 212.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karl Hnilicka: Das Ende auf dem Balkan 1944/45 – Die militärische Räumung Jugoslaviens durch die deutsche Wehrmacht, Musterschmidt, Göttingen 1970.
