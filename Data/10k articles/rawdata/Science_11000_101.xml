'''{{mp|2011 KW|48}}''', temporarily designated '''VNH0004''', is a [[trans-Neptunian object]] from the [[Inner classical belt|inner classical]] part of the [[Kuiper belt]], located in the outermost region of the [[Solar System]]. It measures approximately {{convert|77|km|mi|sp=us}} in diameter.

The object was first observed on 29 May 2011, during the New Horizons KBO Search ({{small|[[IAU code#266|266]]}}) conducted by astronomers using the [[Subaru Telescope]] at the [[Mauna Kea Observatory]] on Hawaii, United States.&lt;ref name="MPC-object" /&gt; It was later observed by the ''[[New Horizons]]'' space probe from afar in January 2015.&lt;ref name="New-Horizons-2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="New-Horizons-2012" /&gt;

== Orbit and classification ==

{{mp|2011 KW|48}} orbits the Sun at a distance of 32.4–42.7&amp;nbsp;[[Astronomical unit|AU]] once every 229 years and 10 months (83,950 days; [[semi-major axis]] of 37.5&amp;nbsp;AU). Its orbit has an [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of 0.14 and an [[orbital inclination|inclination]] of 3.6[[Degree (angle)|°]] with respect to the [[ecliptic]].&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt;

This object was observed 12 times by the [[Mauna Kea Observatories|Mauna Kea]] (8) and [[Las Campanas Observatory|Las Campanas]] (4) observatories over a period of about 33.8 days between 29 May and 2 July 2011. Because of this short period of observation, its current orbit is extremely uncertain.&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MPC-object" /&gt;

== ''New Horizons'' ==

Between 4–15 January 2015,&lt;ref name="New-Horizons-2015" /&gt; the ''[[New Horizons]]'' spacecraft actively observed this object – then temporarily designated {{mp|VNH0004}} – at a distance of about {{convert|0.5|AU|e6km+e6mi|abbr=unit}}.&lt;ref name="New-Horizons-2012" /&gt; While this was too far to resolve surface features or perform spectroscopic analyses of its composition, the spacecraft was able to search for possible satellites and observe its [[phase curve (astronomy)|phase curve]].&lt;ref name="New-Horizons-2012" /&gt; If {{mp|2011 KW|48}} were {{convert|100|km|mi|-1|sp=us}} wide, it would have appeared approximately 0.11&amp;nbsp;arcseconds wide to ''New Horizons''.

== Physical characteristics ==

Based on an [[absolute magnitude]] of 8.8,&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt; and an assumed [[astronomical albedo|albedo]] of 0.09, the ''Johnston{{'s}} archive'' estimates a mean-diameter of approximately {{convert|77|km|mi|sp=us}}.&lt;ref name="johnstonsarchive-TNO-list" /&gt; As of 2018, no rotational [[lightcurve]] of {{mp|2011 KW|48}} has been obtained from photometric observations. The object's [[rotation period]], [[Poles of astronomical bodies|pole]] and shape remain unknown.&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lcdb" /&gt;

== Numbering and naming ==

As of 2018, this [[minor planet]] has not been [[LOMP|numbered]] or [[List of named minor planets (numerical)|named]].&lt;ref name="MPC-object" /&gt;

== Education and early career ==
Goswami spent her undergraduate years (1998) at the [[University of Michigan]], where she focused on how early [[whale]]s transitioned from the land to the water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://trowelblazers.com/anjali-goswami/|title=Anjali Goswami {{!}} TrowelBlazers|website=trowelblazers.com|access-date=2018-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; After this, she spent time in India at the [[Bandhavgarh National Park]] conducting field work.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.ucl.ac.uk/museums/2014/11/14/18th-grant-lecturer-anjali-goswami/|title=18th Grant Lecturer: Anjali Goswami {{!}}  UCL Museums &amp; Collections Blog|website=blogs.ucl.ac.uk|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also conducted field work in Madagascar, Chile, Peru, and Western U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://vertpaleo.org/the-Society/Awards/Past-Award-Winners/2004-(Predoctoral-Fellowship-Grant)-Anjali-Goswami.aspx|title=2004-(Predoctoral-Fellowship-Grant)-Anjali-Goswami|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''&lt;nowiki/&gt;''

In 2005 Goswami earned her doctorate at the [[University of Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://evbio.uchicago.edu/people/alumni/|title=Alumni - Committee on Evolutionary Biology {{!}} The University of Chicago|website=evbio.uchicago.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her thesis, titled ''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'The Evolution of Morphological Integration In the Mammalian Skull''', studied the morphological integration, phenotypic modularity, and developmental trait correlations in 107 species of mammals. These 107 species (98 are extant and 9 are fossil based) include representatives of the [[monotreme]]s, [[Placentalia|placentals]], and [[marsupial]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://catalog.lib.uchicago.edu/vufind/Record/5721212|title=Holdings: The evolution of morphological integration in the mammalian skull /|website=catalog.lib.uchicago.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6249">In [[economics]], '''Beckstrom's law''' is a model or [[theorem]] formulated by [[Rod Beckstrom]]. It purports to answer "the decades-old question of 'how valuable is a network'", and states in summary that "The value of a network equals the net value added to each user’s transactions conducted through that network, summed over all users."

According to its creator, this law can be used to value any network be it [[social network]]s, [[computer network]]s, [[support group]]s and even the [[Internet]] as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slideshare.net/RodBeckstrom/economics-of-networks-beckstrom-national-cybersecurity-center-department-of-homeland-security Economics of Networks]&lt;/ref&gt; This new model values the network by looking from the edge of the network at all of the transactions conducted and the value added to each.

It states that one way to contemplate the value the network adds to each transaction is to imagine the network being shut off and what the additional transactions costs or loss would be. It can thus be compared to the value of a [[pizza delivery]] service offered to its customers. If the pizza delivery service shut down, then the social value generated by its deliveries declines, and people will either go hungry or elsewhere. Similarly, a potluck derives its total enjoyment value from the net value produced by each participant's dish. The success of such a gathering hinges on increasing the number of independent guests and their pots, thereby maximizing the amount of "luck" any one guest would have to achieve a satisfactory meal. Assuming one pot per person, a potluck with a set maximum number of guests could produce only a relatively small amount of total potential group satisfaction.

Beckstrom's Law differs from [[Metcalfe's law]], [[Reed's law]] and other concepts that proposed that the value of a network was based purely on the size of the network, and in [[Metcalfe's law]], one other variable. 

According to Rod Beckstrom, the most significant improvement when using Beckstrom's Law instead of Metcalfe's Law, is the applicability to current experiences on the Internet. Metcalfe's Law does not account for service degradation due to a high number of users or bad actors who steal value from the network. &lt;ref&gt; Lemos, Robert. 2009.

== As an explicit economic model ==

The net present value ''V'' of any network ''j'' to any individual ''i'' is equal to the sum of the net present value of the benefit of all transactions less the net present value of the costs of all transactions on the network over any given period of time ''t'', as shown in the following equation. The value of the entire network is the summary of the value to all users, who are defined as all parties doing transactions on that network.

:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{i=1}^n  V_{i,j} = \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{k=1}^m \frac{B_{i,j,k}-C_{i,j,k}}{(1+r_k)^{t_k}} &lt;/math&gt;

where:

: &lt;math&gt;\sum V_{i,j} &lt;/math&gt; = value of a network ''j'' to all users

: ''V''&lt;sub&gt;''i'',''j''&lt;/sub&gt; = net present value of all transactions to user ''i'' with respect  to network ''j'', over any time period
: ''i'' identifies one user of the network
: ''j'' identifies one network 
: ''k'' identifies one transaction
: ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''i'',''j'',''k''&lt;/sub&gt; = the benefit value of transaction ''k'' to individual ''i'' with respect to network ''j''
: ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''i'',''j'',''k''&lt;/sub&gt; = the cost of transaction ''k'' to individual ''i'' with respect to network ''j''
: ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; = the discount rate of interest to the time of transaction ''k''
: ''t''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; = the elapsed time in years to transaction ''k''
: ''n'' = number of individuals
: ''m'' = number of transactions

==Application to the real world==
Beckstrom's Law gives an indication on community dynamics that affect the experience of the individual. If consumers use services that are based on funding by a community of people, every member of that community is contributing to delivering the service. As more members join the community they aid funding the services through their contributions, however, these member also demand a services by themselves which ultimately can lead to delays and deteriorating quality of the community service. For example, a larger number of members of a golf club lead to more revenue of the golf club, but a larger number of members aids to overcrowding golf courses and delays which has a negative effect on the golfing experience. Beckstrom's Law provides a model that could identify the point at which the marginal effect of each new member's contribution is zero and where adding an additional member makes everybody else worse off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=T.

'''''Big Bang: The most important scientific discovery of all time and why you need to know about it''''' is a book written by [[Simon Singh]] and published in 2004 by Fourth Estate.

''Big Bang'' chronicles the history and development of the [[Big Bang]] model of the universe, from the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] scientists who first measured the distance to the sun to the 20th century detection of the [[Cosmic microwave background radiation|cosmic radiation]] still echoing the dawn of time.

The book discusses how different theories of the universe evolved, along with a personal look at the people involved.

== Before Big Bang theories ==
The book takes up how the inaccuracies of the theories of Copernicus and Galileo lead them to be dismissed. Copernicus and Galileo used false arguments to persuade people that the earth went in circles around the Sun, and that the Sun was the center of the universe. Both these statements were alien to the public at the time, and are still alien to a modern public. Only the finally mathematically correct interpretation of [[Kepler]] made the theories accepted, within a single generation. As Singh points out, the old generation must die before a new theory can be accepted.

== The Big Bang theory evolves ==

In parallel to the evolution of the Big Bang theory, the book tells the personal stories of the people who played a part in advancing it, both by [[hypothesis]] and by [[experiment]]. These include [[Einstein]], for his General Relativity, [[Alexander Alexandrovich Friedman|Friedmann]] for first discovering that this theory led to an expanding universe, [[Georges Lemaître|Lemaître]] who concluded independently of Friedman discovered an expanding universe, and then that the theory must lead to an initial event of creation, which is the Big Bang theory we know today, [[Edwin Hubble|Hubble]] for observing that the universe expanded, thereby confirming Friedman and Lemaître, [[George Gamow|Gamow]], [[Ralph Asher Alpher|Alpher]], [[Robert Herman|Herman]], [[Martin Ryle|Ryle]], [[Arno Allan Penzias|Penzias]] and [[Robert Woodrow Wilson|Wilson]], among many others.

Another theme of the book is the [[scientific method]] itself: how [[serendipity]], curiosity, theory and observation come together to expand our understanding of the world.

One of the most interesting points in the book is how Einstein initially dismissed the theory out of hand. Such was his authority in the scientific community that none dared oppose him, thereby stifling research in this area for many years. However, when Hubble confirmed the theory, Einstein was quick to endorse both Lemaître and his theories.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14391">'''Causal decision theory''' is a mathematical theory intended to determine the set of [[rational choice]]s in a given situation. In informal terms, it maintains that the rational choice is that with the best [[expected value|expected]] [[Causality|causal]] consequences. This theory is often contrasted with [[evidential decision theory]], which recommends those actions that provide the best expected outcome conditional on one’s best evidence about the world.

==Informal description==

Very informally, causal decision theory advises decision makers to make the decision with the best expected causal consequences. The basic idea is simple enough: if eating an apple will cause you to be happy and eating an orange will cause you to be sad then you would be rational to eat the apple. One complication is the notion of ''expected'' causal consequences. Imagine that eating a good apple will cause you to be happy and eating a bad apple will cause you to be sad but you aren't sure if the apple is good or bad. In this case you don't know the causal effects of eating the apple. Instead, then, you work from the ''expected'' causal effects, where these will depend on three things: (1) how likely you think the apple is to be good and how likely you think it is to be bad; (2) how happy eating a good apple makes you; and (3) how sad eating a bad apple makes you. In informal terms, causal decision theory advises the agent to make the decision with the best expected causal effects.

==Formal description==

In a 1981 article, Allan Gibbard and William Harper explained causal decision theory as maximization of the expected utility &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; of an action &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; "calculated from probabilities of [[Counterfactual conditional|counterfactuals]]":&lt;ref name="GibbardHarper"&gt;{{Citation

:&lt;math&gt;
U(A)=\sum\limits_{j} P(A &gt; O_j) D(O_j),
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;D(O_j)&lt;/math&gt; is the desirability of outcome &lt;math&gt;O_j&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P(A &gt; O_j)&lt;/math&gt; is the counterfactual probability that, if &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; were done, then &lt;math&gt;O_j&lt;/math&gt; would hold.

==Difference from evidential decision theory==

[[David Kellogg Lewis|David Lewis]] proved&lt;ref name=Lewis1976&gt;{{Citation
 | doi = 10.2307/2184045
 | title = Probabilities of conditionals and conditional probabilities
 | year = 1976
 | author = Lewis, D.
 | journal = The Philosophical Review
 | pages = 297–315| volume = 85

 | jstor = 2184045
}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the probability of a conditional &lt;math&gt;P(A &gt; O_j)&lt;/math&gt; does not always equal the conditional probability &lt;math&gt;P(O_j | A)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;In fact, Lewis proved a stronger result: "if a class of probability functions is closed under conditionalizing, then there can be no probability conditional for that class unless the class consists entirely of trivial probability functions," where a ''trivial probability function'' is one that "never assigns positive probability to more than two incompatible alternatives, and hence is at most four-valued [...]."&lt;/ref&gt; If that were the case, causal decision theory would be equivalent to evidential decision theory, which uses conditional probabilities.

Gibbard and Harper showed that if we accept two axioms (one related to the controversial [[principle of the conditional excluded middle]]&lt;ref name=Shaffer2009&gt;{{Citation
 | title = Decision Theory, Intelligent Planning and Counterfactuals
 | year = 2009
 | author = Shaffer, Michael John

}}&lt;/ref&gt;), then the [[statistical independence]] of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A &gt; O_j&lt;/math&gt; suffices to guarantee that &lt;math&gt;P(A &gt; O_j) = P(O_j | A)&lt;/math&gt;. However, there are cases in which actions and conditionals are not independent. Gibbard and Harper give an example in which King David wants Bathsheba but fears that summoning her would provoke a revolt.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Further, David has studied works on psychology and political science which teach him the following: Kings have two personality types, charismatic and uncharismatic. A king's degree of charisma depends on his genetic make-up and early childhood experiences, and cannot be changed in adulthood. Now, charismatic kings tend to act justly and uncharismatic kings unjustly. Successful revolts against charismatic kings are rare, whereas successful revolts against uncharismatic kings are frequent. Unjust acts themselves, though, do not cause successful revolts; the reason uncharismatic kings are prone to successful revolts is that they have a sneaky, ignoble bearing. David does not know whether or not he is charismatic; he does know that it is unjust to send for another man's wife. (p. 164)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In this case, evidential decision theory recommends that David abstain from Bathsheba, while causal decision theory—noting that whether David is charismatic or uncharismatic cannot be changed—recommends sending for her.

When required to choose between causal decision theory and evidential decision theory, philosophers usually prefer causal decision theory.&lt;ref&gt;Weirich, Paul, "Causal Decision Theory", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2016 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &amp;lt;https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2016/entries/decision-causal/&amp;gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
===Vagueness===
The theory of causal decision theory (CDT) does not itself specify what algorithm to use to calculate the counterfactual probabilities.&lt;ref name=Shaffer2009 /&gt; One proposal is the "imaging" technique suggested by Lewis:&lt;ref name=Lewis1981&gt;{{Citation
 | doi = 10.1080/00048408112340011
 | title = Causal decision theory
 | url = http://www.informaworld.com/index/739194078.pdf

 | author = Lewis, D.
 | journal = Australasian Journal of Philosophy

 | volume = 59
 | issue = 1
 | accessdate = 2009-05-29
}}&lt;/ref&gt; To evaluate &lt;math&gt;P(A &gt; O_j)&lt;/math&gt;, move probability mass from each possible world &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; to the closest possible world &lt;math&gt;w_A&lt;/math&gt; in which &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; holds, assuming &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is possible. However, this procedure requires that we know what we would believe if we were certain of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;; this is itself a conditional to which we might assign probability less than 1, leading to regress.&lt;ref name=Shaffer2009 /&gt;

===Counterexamples===
There are innumerable "counterexamples" where, it is argued, a straightforward application of CDT fails to produce a defensibly "sane" decision. Philosopher Andy Egan argues this is due to a fundamental disconnect between the intuitive rational rule, "do what you expect will bring about the best results", and CDT's algorithm of "do whatever has the best expected outcome, holding fixed our initial views about the likely causal structure of the world." In this view, it is CDT's requirement to "hold fixed the agent’s unconditional credences in dependency hypotheses" that leads to irrational decisions.&lt;ref name=Egan2007 /&gt;

An early alleged counterexample is [[Newcomb's problem]]. Because your choice of one or two boxes can't causally affect the Predictor's guess, causal decision theory recommends the two-boxing strategy.&lt;ref name="GibbardHarper" /&gt; However, this results in getting only $1,000, not $1,000,000. Philosophers disagree whether one-boxing or two-boxing is the "rational" strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bellos|first1=Alex|title=Newcomb's problem divides philosophers. Which side are you on?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/alexs-adventures-in-numberland/2016/nov/28/newcombs-problem-divides-philosophers-which-side-are-you-on|accessdate=27 July 2017|work=The Guardian|date=28 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar concerns may arise even in seemingly-straightforward problems like the [[prisoner's dilemma]],&lt;ref name=Lewis1979&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially when playing opposite your "twin" whose choice to cooperate or defect correlates strongly, but is not caused by, your own choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Howard|first1=J.

In the "Death in Damascus" scenario, an anthropomorphic "Death" predicts where you will be tomorrow, and goes to wait for you there. As in Newcomb's problem, we postulate that Death is a reliable predictor. A CDT agent would be unable to process the correlation, and may as a consequence make irrational decisions:&lt;ref name=Egan2007 /&gt;&lt;ref name=binding&gt;Meacham, Christopher JG. "Binding and its consequences."

Another recent counterexample is the "Psychopath Button":&lt;ref name=Egan2007&gt;{{Citation

&lt;blockquote&gt;Paul is debating whether to press the ‘kill all psychopaths’ button. It would, he thinks, be much better to live in a world with no psychopaths. Unfortunately, Paul is quite confident that only a psychopath would press such a button. Paul very strongly prefers living in a world with psychopaths to dying. Should Paul press the button?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Egan, "pretty much everyone" agrees that Paul should not press the button, yet CDT endorses pressing the button.&lt;ref name=Egan2007 /&gt;

Philosopher Jim Joyce, perhaps the most prominent modern defender of CDT,&lt;ref&gt;Wedgwood, Ralph. "Gandalf’s solution to the Newcomb problem." Synthese (2013): 1-33.&lt;/ref&gt; argues that CDT naturally is capable of taking into account any "information about what one is inclined or likely to do as evidence". This interpretation of CDT would require solving additional issues: How can a CDT agent avoid stumbling into having beliefs related to its own future acts, and thus becoming provably inconsistent via [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|Gödelian incompleteness]] and [[Löb's theorem]]? How does the agent standing on a cliff avoid inferring that if he were to jump, he would probably have a parachute to break his fall?&lt;ref name=sep&gt;Weirich, Paul, "Causal Decision Theory", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2016 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &amp;lt;https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2016/entries/decision-causal/&amp;gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joyce, James M. "Regret and instability in causal decision theory." Synthese 187.1 (2012): 123-145.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alternatives to causal and evidential decision theory ==
Some scholars believe that a new decision theory needs to be built from the ground up. Philosopher Christopher Meacham proposes "Cohesive Expected Utility Maximization": An agent "should perform the act picked out by a comprehensive strategy which maximizes cohesive expected utility". Meacham also proposes this can be extended to "Global Cohesive Expected Utility Maximization" to enable [[superrationality]]-style cooperation between agents.&lt;ref name=soares&gt;Soares, Nate, and Benja Fallenstein.

Philosophical studies 149.1 (2010): 49-71.&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of AI, bitcoin pioneer Wei Dai proposes "updateless decision theory", which adds to globally cohesive mechanisms the admittedly difficult concept of "logical counterfactuals" to avoid being blackmailed:&lt;ref name=soares/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Consider an agent that would pay up in response to a counterfactual blackmail. The blackmailer would predict this and blackmail the agent. Now, instead, consider an agent that would refuse to pay up in response to a counterfactual blackmail... The blackmailer would predict this too, and so would not blackmail the agent. Therefore, if we are constructing an agent that might encounter counterfactual blackmail, then it is a better overall policy to construct an agent that would refuse to pay up when blackmailed in this way.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It is an open question whether a satisfactory formalization of logical counterfactuals exists.&lt;ref&gt;Nate Soares and Benja Fallenstein. Counterpossibles as necessary for

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11532">British science fiction writer [[Arthur C. Clarke]] formulated three [[adage]]s that are known as '''Clarke's three laws''', of which the third law is the best known and most widely cited. They were part of his ideas in his extensive writings about the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Physics of Invisibility: A Story of Light and Deception|last=Beech|first=Martin|publisher=Springer Science+Business Media|year=2012|isbn=9781461406150|location=New York|pages=190}}&lt;/ref&gt; These so-called laws include:

#{{Anchor|Clarke's first law}} When a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something is possible, he is almost certainly right. When he states that something is impossible, he is very probably wrong.
#{{Anchor|Clarke's second law}} The only way of discovering the limits of the possible is to venture a little way past them into the impossible.
#{{Anchor|Clarke's third law}} Any sufficiently advanced [[technology]] is indistinguishable from [[Magic (supernatural)|magic]].

== Origins ==
One account claimed that Clarke's "laws" were developed after the editor of his works in French started numbering the author's assertions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Quote Verifier: Who Said What, Where, and When|last=Keyes|first=Ralph|publisher=St. Martin's Press|year=2006|isbn=9780312340049|location=New York|pages=217}}&lt;/ref&gt; All three laws appear in Clarke's essay "Hazards of Prophecy: The Failure of Imagination", first published in ''Profiles of the Future'' (1962).&lt;ref&gt;"'Hazards of Prophecy: The Failure of Imagination'" in the collection ''Profiles of the Future: An Enquiry into the Limits of the Possible'' (1962, rev. 1973), pp. 14, 21, 36.&lt;/ref&gt; However, they were not published at the same time. Clarke's first law was proposed in the 1962 edition of the essay, as "Clarke's Law" in ''Profiles of the Future''.

The second law is offered as a simple observation in the same essay but its status as Clarke's second law was conferred by others. It was initially a derivative of the first law and formally became Clarke's second law where the author proposed the third law in the 1973 revision of ''Profiles of the Future,'' which included an acknowledgement''.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Believing Brain: From Ghosts and Gods to Politics and Conspiracies---How We Construct Beliefs and Reinforce Them as Truths|last=Shermer|first=Michael|publisher=Henry Holt and Company, LLC|year=2011|isbn=9780805091250|location=New York|pages=358}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also here that Clarke wrote about the third law in these words: "As three laws were good enough for [[Isaac Newton|Newton]], I have modestly decided to stop there".

The third law, despite being latest stated by a decade, is the best known and most widely cited. It appears only in the 1973 revision of the "Hazards of Prophecy" essay&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Profiles of the Future: An Inquiry into the Limits of the Possible|last=Clarke|first=Arthur C.|publisher=Popular Library|year=1973|isbn=9780330236195|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It echoes a statement in a 1942 story by [[Leigh Brackett]]: "Witchcraft to the ignorant, … simple science to the learned".&lt;ref&gt;"The Sorcerer of Rhiannon", ''[[Astounding]]'' February 1942, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier examples of this sentiment may be found in ''[[Wild Talents]]'' (1932) by [[Charles Fort]]: "...a performance that may some day be considered understandable, but that, in these primitive times, so transcends what is said to be the known that it is what I mean by magic," and in the short story ''[[The Hound of Death]]'' (1933) by [[Agatha Christie]]: "The supernatural is only the natural of which the laws are not yet understood."

Clarke gave an example of the third law when he said that while he "would have believed anyone who told him back in 1962 that there would one day exist a book-sized object capable of holding the content of an entire library, he would never have accepted that the same device could find a page or word in a second and then convert it into any typeface and size from Albertus Extra Bold to Zurich Calligraphic", referring to his memory of "seeing and hearing [[Lynotype|Linotype]] machines which slowly converted ‘molten lead into front pages that required two men to lift them’".&lt;ref name="Gooden2015"/&gt;

== Proposed fourth law ==
A fourth law has been proposed for the canon, despite Clarke's declared intention of stopping at three laws. [[Geoff Holder]] quotes: "For every expert, there is an equal and opposite expert,"&lt;ref&gt;Holder, Geoff (2009). ''101 Things to Do with a Stone Circle''. The History Press, 2009. Holder offers as his source Clarke's ''Profiles of the Future'' (Millennium Edition, 1999, paperback edition page 143, {{ISBN|0-575-40277-6}}).&lt;/ref&gt; which is part of American economist [[Thomas Sowell]]'s "For every expert, there is an equal and opposite expert, but for every fact there is not necessarily an equal and opposite fact", from his 1995 book ''[[The Vision of the Anointed]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[ Massimo Pigliucci]], ''Nonsense on Stilts: How to Tell Science from Bunk'', 2010, {{ISBN|0226667871}}; an epigraph to Chapter 12, [https://books.google.com/books?id=aC8Baky2qTcC&amp;pg=PA279 p. 279]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Variants of the third law ==

The third law has inspired many [[snowclone]]s and other variations:

'''''Cosmic Jackpot''''', also published under the title '''''The Goldilocks Enigma: Why is the Universe Just Right for Life?''''',&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=9hxsTybfLWsC Google Books: The Goldilocks Enigma]&lt;/ref&gt; is a 2007 non-fiction book by physicist and cosmologist [[Paul Davies]], describing the idea of a [[fine-tuned Universe]].

==The Enigma==
{{main article|Fine-tuned Universe}}
In ''Cosmic Jackpot'', Davies argues that certain universal [[Dimensionless physical constant|fundamental physical constants]] are precisely adjusted to make life in the Universe possible: that we have, in a sense, won a "cosmic [[Progressive jackpot|jackpot]]," and that conditions are "just right" for life, as in [[The Story of the Three Bears]]. As Davies writes elsewhere, "There is now broad agreement among physicists and cosmologists that the universe is in several respects 'fine-tuned' for life."&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Davies]], "How bio-friendly is the universe?" ''International Journal of Astrobiology, vol. 2, no. 2 (2003): 115.&lt;/ref&gt;

After explaining this enigma, Davies discusses possible solutions, such as the [[anthropic principle]], the idea of a [[multiverse]] which contains many different universes (including our "just right" one), and the idea of [[intelligent design]].

==The Multiverse==
{{main article|Multiverse}}
Davies also discusses a number of other ideas connected with the "[[multiverse]]." Much like a pencil falling to the ground from its tip in a trade off of symmetry for stability, Davies writes that the Big Bang could have established a complex but stable universe (or multiverse) from [[symmetry breaking]] as the heat radiation in "space" lowered abruptly past the [[Curie Point]].

{{short description| Gas law describing pressure contributions of component gases in a mixture }}

[[File:Dalton's law of partial pressures.png|thumb|An illustration of Dalton's law using the gases of air at sea level.]]
In [[chemistry]] and [[physics]], '''Dalton's law''' (also called '''Dalton's law of partial pressures''') states that in a mixture of non-reacting gases, the total  [[pressure]] exerted is equal to the sum of the [[partial pressure]]s of the individual gases.&lt;ref name="Silberberg"&gt;{{cite book |last=Silberberg |first=Martin S. |date=2009 |title=Chemistry: the molecular nature of matter and change |edition=5th |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=Boston |isbn=9780073048598 |page=206 |ref=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[empirical]] law was observed by [[John Dalton]] in 1801 and published in 1802.&lt;ref&gt;J. Dalton (1802), [https://books.google.com/books?id=3qdJAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA595#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Essay IV.  On the expansion of elastic fluids by heat,"] ''Memoirs of the Literary and Philosophical Society of Manchester'', vol. 5, pt. 2, pages 595–602; see page 600.&lt;/ref&gt; and is related to the [[ideal gas|ideal]] [[gas laws]].

==Formula==
Mathematically, the pressure of a mixture of non-[[chemical reaction|reactive]] gases can be defined as the summation:

:&lt;math&gt;p_\text{total} = \sum_{i=1}^n p_i&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; or &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;p_\text{total} = p_1+p_2+p_3+\cdots+p_n&lt;/math&gt;

where ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''p&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' represent the partial pressures of each component.&lt;ref name="Silberberg" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;p_{i} =p_\text{total} x_i&lt;/math&gt;

where ''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the [[mole fraction]] of the ''i''th component in the total mixture of ''n'' components.

==Volume-based concentration==
The relationship below provides a way to determine the [[concentration|volume-based concentration]] of any individual gaseous component

:&lt;math&gt;p_i =p_\text{total} c_i&lt;/math&gt;

where ''c&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the concentration of the ''i''th component.

Dalton's law is not strictly followed by real gases, with the deviation increasing with pressure. Under such conditions the volume occupied by the molecules becomes significant compared to the free space between them. In particular, the short average distances between molecules increases [[intermolecular force]]s between gas molecules enough to substantially change the pressure exerted by them, an effect not included in the ideal gas model.

The book '''''Environmental Principles and Policies: An Interdisciplinary Introduction''''', written by Professor [[Sharon Beder]], examines six well-known environmental and social principles that have been used at the international and national level. It uses them to evaluate the new wave of market-based policy instruments that have been introduced in many countries.{{cite needed|date=March 2016}}

==Six principles==
The six principles discussed in the book are:

* the [[Sustainability|sustainability principle]]
* the [[polluter pays principle]]
* the [[precautionary principle]]
* the [[Social equity|equity principle]]
* the [Human rights|human rights principles]]
* the [[Public participation|participation principle]]{{cite needed|date=March 2016}}

==Interdisciplinary approach==

This book on environmental policy-making takes a critical and interdisciplinary approach. Rather than merely setting out policy options in a descriptive way, it evaluates policies from different perspectives. This enables readers to gain a thorough understanding of important principles and current policies, and also to be able to apply the various principles and critically evaluate them.{{cite needed|date=March 2016}}

==The author==

Professor Beder was included in a list of "Australia's most influential engineers", published by ''Engineers Australia'' in 2004.  She was also included in ''Bulletin Magazine's'' "Smart 100" in 2003.{{cite needed|date=March 2016}}

'''Exploratory engineering''' is a term coined by [[K. Eric Drexler]] to describe the process of designing and analyzing detailed hypothetical models of systems that are not feasible with current technologies or methods, but do seem to be clearly within the bounds of what science considers to be possible within the narrowly defined scope of operation of the hypothetical system model. It usually results in [[paper prototypes|paper]] or [[video prototype]]s, or (more likely nowadays) [[computer simulation|computer model]]s that are as convincing as possible to those that know the relevant science, given the lack of experimental confirmation. By analogy with [[protoscience]], it might be considered a form of '''protoengineering'''.

==Usage==

Due to the difficulty and necessity of anticipating results in such areas as [[genetic modification]], [[climate change]], [[molecular engineering]], and [[megascale engineering]], parallel fields such as [[bioethics]], [[climate engineering]] and hypothetical [[molecular nanotechnology]] sometimes emerge to develop and examine hypotheses, define limits, and express potential solutions to the anticipated technological problems. Proponents of exploratory engineering contend that it is an appropriate initial approach to such problems.

[[Engineering]] is concerned with the design of a solution to a practical problem. A [[scientist]] may ask "why?" and proceed to research the answer to the question. By contrast, engineers want to know how to solve a problem, and how to implement that solution. Exploratory engineering often posits that a highly detailed solution exists, and explores the putative characteristics of such a solution, while holding in abeyance the question of how to implement that solution. If a point can be reached where the attempted implementation of the solution is addressed using the principles of [[engineering physics]], the activity transitions from protoengineering to actual engineering, and results in success or failure to implement the design.

==Requirements==

Unlike the [[scientific method]] which relies on [[peer review]]ed [[experiment]]s which attempt to prove or disprove a falsifiable [[hypothesis]], exploratory engineering relies on [[peer review]], [[simulation]] and other methods employed by scientists, but applies them to some hypothetical artifact, a specific and detailed hypothesized design or process, rather than to an abstract model or theory. Because of the inherent lack of experimental [[falsifiability]] in exploratory engineering, its practitioners must take particular care to avoid falling into practices analogous to [[cargo cult science]], [[pseudoscience]], and [[pathological science]].

==Criticism==

Exploratory engineering has its critics, who dismiss the activity as mere armchair speculation, albeit with computer assist. A boundary which would take exploratory engineering out of the realm of mere speculation and define it as a realistic design activity is often indiscernible to such critics, and at the same time is often inexpressible by the proponents of exploratory engineering. While both critics and proponents often agree that much of the highly detailed simulation effort in the field may never result in a physical device, the dichotomy between the two groups is exemplified by the situation in which proponents of [[molecular nanotechnology]] contend that many complicated molecular machinery designs will be realizable after an unspecified [http://www.foresight.org/EOC/Engines.pdf "assembler breakthrough"] envisioned by [[K. Eric Drexler]], while critics contend that this attitude embodies wishful thinking equivalent to that in the famous [[Sidney Harris (cartoonist)|Sidney Harris]] cartoon ({{ISBN|0-913232-39-4}}) "And then a miracle occurs" published in the American Scientist magazine. In summary the critics contend that a hypothetical model which is both self-consistent and consistent with the laws of science concerning its operation, in the absence of a path to build the device modeled, provides no evidence that the desired device can be built. Proponents contend that there are so many potential ways to build the desired device that surely at least one of those ways will not display a critical flaw preventing the device from being built.

==Science fiction==

Both proponents and critics often point to [[science fiction]] stories as the origin of exploratory engineering. On the positive side of the science fiction ledger, the ocean-going [[submarine]], the [[telecommunications satellite]], and other inventions were anticipated in such stories before they could be built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Science in Science Fiction: 83 SF Predictions that Became Scientific Reality|author=Robert Bly|url=https://books.google.com/books?pg=PA1 |page=1|date=2005|isbn=1-932100-48-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the negative side of the same ledger, other science fiction devices such as the [[space elevator]] may be forever impossible because of basic [[strength of materials]] issues or due to other difficulties, either anticipated or unanticipated.

'''Extensional viscosity ''' (also known as '''elongational viscosity''') is a [[viscosity]] coefficient when applied [[Stress (physics)|stress]] is [[extensional stress]].&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, H.A. "A handbook of elementary rheology", Institute of non-Newtonian Fluid Mechanics, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;
:This parameter is often used for characterizing polymer solutions.
''Extensional viscosity'' can be measured using rheometers that apply ''extensional stress''. [[Acoustic rheometer]] is one example of such devices.

:&lt;math&gt;\eta_e = \frac{\sigma_n}{\dot{\varepsilon}}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\eta_e\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is the '''extensional viscosity''' or '''elongational viscosity'''
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_n\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is the '''normal stress''': &lt;math&gt;\sigma_n = \frac{F}{A}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\dot{\varepsilon}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is the '''rate of strain''': &lt;math&gt;\dot{\varepsilon} = \frac{1}{L}\frac{dL}{dt}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

For a [[Newtonian Fluid]], the uniaxial elongational viscosity is three times the shear viscosity which can be derived using the [[continuity equation]] for incompressible fluids.

:&lt;math&gt;\eta_e = 3\eta\,\!&lt;/math&gt; (Trouton's Ratio)

The '''Foundation for Agronomic Research''' (FAR) is a non-profit (501(c)(3) research and education foundation, created in 1980 by the Board of Directors of the Potash &amp; Phosphate Institute (PPI) to expand its research efforts beyond that possible with PPI’s resources and mandate. The mission of FAR is to improve the economic vigor and sustainability of agriculture in North America and around the world, while protecting and enhancing the environment.

FAR facilitates research and education programs in cooperation with [[International Plant Nutrition Institute]] (IPNI). FAR’s effectiveness is enhanced by the IPNI agronomic staff. They are capable,respected scientists who work closely with a variety of stakeholders, monitor research projects, and assist in the interpretation and extension of results.

FAR works to integrate a broad spectrum of interests and to assemble multi-regional projects with multi-disciplinary research teams.

*FAR focuses on factors that limit crop production or that have the potential to impact the environment.
*IPNI/FAR supported research addresses all plant nutrients and various other practices like tillage, residue management, crop rotation, plant population, and [[crop protection]].
*FAR research initiatives address complex questions related to cropping systems, food production, and crop quality.
*FAR publications and FAR’s website present key issues and new information.
*FAR and IPNI sponsor a variety of educational programs, such as the popular [[InfoAg Conference]] series. 
*Working with Extension, commodity organizations, Certified Crop Advisers, and other organizations, FAR‘s outreach programs are designed to quickly get practical information to people who can put it to work in the field.

The '''Four Thieves Vinegar Collective''' is an [[anarchist]] [[Do-it-yourself biology|biohacking]] group founded in 2015 by Michael Laufer. They have published instructions for the "EpiPencil", an [[epinephrine]] [[autoinjector]], and the "Apothecary MicroLab", a [[do-it-yourself]] (DIY) device intended to make a variety of [[medication]]s, most notably [[pyrimethamine]] (Daraprim). They have been widely criticized by the medical community for causing potential harm to patients with the DIY instructions, but Laufer defends people's right to attempt their own medical treatment.

==History==
Laufer, who is trained in [[mathematics]] rather than medicine, decided to form the group in 2008 during a [[graduate school]] trip to [[El Salvador]]. While visiting a local medical clinic he learned that despite the existence of many [[clandestine chemistry]] labs producing [[methamphetamine]] and [[MDMA]], the clinic was out of [[oral contraceptives]]. He investigated the possibility of DIY pharmaceuticals which culminated in the founding of Four Thieves in 2015.&lt;ref name="gizmodo"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Brown |first1=Kristen |title=A DIY Pharmaceutical Revolution Is Coming—If It Doesn’t Kill Us First |url=https://gizmodo.com/a-diy-pharmaceutical-revolution-is-coming-if-it-doesn-t-1796865404 |website=[[Gizmodo]] |accessdate=31 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He took the name from [[four thieves vinegar]], a legendary [[Plague (disease)|plague]] cure.&lt;ref name="sa"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Piller |first1=Charles |title=An Anarchist Is Teaching Patients to Make Their Own Medications |url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/an-anarchist-is-teaching-patients-to-make-their-own-medications/ |website=[[Scientific American]] |accessdate=31 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four Thieves had formerly partnered with [[Chematica]] to develop recipes for the group's medication,&lt;ref name="parallax" /&gt; but this ended and they lost access to information and software they had been given after pharmaceutical company [[Merck Group|Merck]] bought the startup.&lt;ref name="vice" /&gt;

==Members==
Four Thieves' membership is generally composed of technically-trained people, but does not include medical professionals.&lt;ref name="vice" /&gt;

==Views==
Laufer has compared his work to that of [[Women on Waves]], a group that provides [[Abortifacient|abortion medication]] to women in areas where [[abortion]] is illegal.&lt;ref name="parallax"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Rosenblatt |first1=Seth |title=Hacker targets Big Pharma with homebrew meds |url=https://www.the-parallax.com/2016/07/25/hacker-targets-big-pharma-homebrew-meds/ |website=The Parallax |accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; His motivation in founding the group is to provide medication to people when it is too expensive for them to afford, is illegal to acquire, or is unavailable due to it treating an [[orphan disease]]. He believes that providing lifesaving medication to any that need it justifies violating [[intellectual property]] rights of pharmaceutical companies, and supports [[cognitive liberty]].&lt;ref name="vice"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Oberhaus |first1=Daniel |title=Meet the Anarchists Making Their Own Medicine |url=https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/43pngb/how-to-make-your-own-medicine-four-thieves-vinegar-collective |website=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]] |accessdate=31 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==EpiPencil==
In 2016 after the price for an [[EpiPen]] was raised from $57 to $318 by its manufacturer [[Mylan]], Four Thieves released instructions for how to build an "EpiPencil", a homemade [[epinephrine]] [[autoinjector]] that can be built for $30.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Condliffe |first1=Jamie |title=It Costs $30 to Make a DIY EpiPen, and Here’s the Proof |url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/602422/it-costs-30-to-make-a-diy-epipen-and-heres-the-proof/ |website=[[MIT Technology Review]] |accessdate=31 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is made from three off-the-shelf parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Laufer |first1=Mixæl |title=Introducing the EpiPencil |url=https://fourthievesvinegar.org/blog/2016/09/introducing-the-epipencil |website=Four Thieves Vinegar Collective |accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been criticized for potential danger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Weill |first1=Kelly |title=Please Do Not Hack Your Own EpiPen |url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/please-do-not-hack-your-own-epipen |website=[[The Daily Beast]] |accessdate=31 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theresa Eisenman, a spokeswoman for the [[United States]] [[Food and Drug Administration]], stated that using such a device is a "potentially dangerous practice".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Leonard |first1=Kimberly |title=EpiPen Alternative? Meet the $30, DIY EpiPencil |url=https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2016-09-23/epipen-alternative-meet-the-30-diy-epipencil |website=[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]] |accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The device is not known to have actually been used.&lt;ref name="sa" /&gt;

==Apothecary MicroLab==
Four Thieves has released instructions for building an "Apothecary MicroLab", a DIY device claimed to be able to synthesize a variety of medications. The group released instructions how how to manufacture [[pyrimethamine]] (Daraprim) from [[acetonitrile]], [[ethyl bromide]], and [[dicyandiamide]] with it.&lt;ref name="gizmodo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="parallax" /&gt; Laufer claims that it can also be used to make [[naloxone]], [[cabotegravir]], [[mifepristone]], and [[misoprostol]].&lt;ref name="vice" /&gt; Jeremiah Johnson, a researcher at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], has stated that using it would be very dangerous as it could create the wrong drug or the wrong dose.&lt;ref name="gizmodo" /&gt; [[Eric von Hippel]], an [[economist]] at MIT who supports DIY medication, has stated that the design could create chemical byproducts as well as or instead of the intended medication.&lt;ref name="vice" /&gt;

Laufer claims that they have successfully synthesized cabotegravir, an experimental new [[integrase inhibitor]], and asked [[heroin]] dealers to cut their product with it in order to help lower the rates of [[HIV]] infection among heroin users.&lt;ref name="vice" /&gt;

==Reception==
Jose Gomez-Marquez, who is researching pharmaceuticals at MIT, has stated his belief that the group is more about publicity than medication, and is concerned about the danger of unvetted information being published.&lt;ref name="gizmodo" /&gt; [[Vinay Prasad]], a professor of medicine at [[Oregon Health &amp; Science University]], believes that DIY medication is "foolhardy".&lt;ref name="sa" /&gt;

[[Josiah Zayner]], another biohacker, believes that the group's work is more symbolic than anything else.&lt;ref name="sa" /&gt;

Chemist [[Derek Lowe (chemist)|Derek Lowe]] described the Vice magazine on the collective as "largely bullshit".&lt;ref name=science-anarchist-drugs-for-all&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/07/30/anarchist-drugs-for-all-yeahboy|title=Anarchist Drugs For All. Yeahboy.|publisher=[[Science (journal)|Science]]|last=Lowe|first=Derek|date=30 July 2018|access-date=1 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He noted that they had synthesized known substances rather than producing new ones.&lt;ref name=science-anarchist-drugs-for-all/&gt; He also pointed out that their proposal to combat [[Hepatitis C]] could accidentally cause treatement-resistant strains of Hepatitis C.&lt;ref name=science-anarchist-drugs-for-all/&gt;

==Legal status==
Patricia Zettler, a former [[Lawyer|attorney]] at the FDA, believes that Four Thieves' work is legal because they are only providing information rather than drugs themselves.&lt;ref name="sa" /&gt;

"'''Galileo'''" is a song written by [[Emily Saliers]] and recorded and performed by [[folk rock]] group the [[Indigo Girls]]. It was released in 1992 on their platinum-selling fourth studio album ''[[Rites of Passage (Indigo Girls album)|Rites of Passage]]''. It reached #10 on the [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] Modern Rock Tracks chart, the first song by the Indigo Girls to break the top ten on any chart.

The song is about [[reincarnation]], partially through the lens of the story of [[Galileo|Galileo Galilei]], the 17th century physicist, mathematician, astronomer, and philosopher who played a major role in the [[scientific revolution]]. The song's chorus invokes both [[Existentialism#Angst|existential angst]] and Galileo's genius with "How long till my soul gets it right/Can any human being ever reach the highest light/I call on the resting soul of Galileo/King of night vision, king of insight", referencing both the clarity of physical vision made possible through his modernizations of the [[telescope]] and his support of [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicanism]], which stated that the Sun, rather than the Earth, was the center of the universe. The song has frequently closed concerts since its premiere in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Introduction==
Geography is a systematic study of the Universe and its features. Traditionally, geography has been associated with [[cartography]] and place names. Although many geographers are trained in [[toponymy]] and [[Cartography|cartology]], this is not their main preoccupation. Geographers study the [[space]] and the [[temporal database]] distribution of phenomena, processes, and features as well as the [[interaction]] of humans and their [[Natural environment|environment]].&lt;ref name="Hayes-Bohanan"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://webhost.bridgew.edu/jhayesboh/environmentalgeography.htm|title=What is Environmental Geography, Anyway?|last=Hayes-Bohanan|first=James|date=29 September 2009|website=webhost.bridgew.edu|publisher=[[Bridgewater State University]]|access-date=10 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because space and place affect a variety of topics, such as [[economics]], [[health]], [[climate]], [[plant]]s and [[animal]]s, geography is highly interdisciplinary. The interdisciplinary nature of the geographical approach depends on an attentiveness to the relationship between physical and human phenomena and its spatial patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/An_Introduction_to_Settlement_Geography.html?id=DLpzQgAACAAJ|title=An introduction to Settlement Geography|last=Hornby|first=William F.|last2=Jones|first2=Melvyn|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=978-0521282635|publication-date=29 June 1991|pages=|quote=|access-date=10 November 2016|via=|date=1991-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text= Names of places...are not geography...know by heart a whole [[gazetteer]] full of them would not, in itself, constitute anyone a [[geographer]]. Geography has higher aims than this: it seeks to classify phenomena (alike of the natural and of the political world, in so far as it treats of the latter), to compare, to generalize, to ascend from effects to causes, and, in doing so, to trace out the laws of nature and to mark their influences upon man. This is 'a description of the world'—that is Geography. In a word Geography is a Science—a thing not of mere names but of argument and reason, of cause and effect.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, William. (1863). ''The Study of Geography''. Lecture delivered at King's College, London by Sir Marc Alexander. Quoted in {{Cite book|last=Baker |first=J.N.L |date=1963 |title=The History of Geography |publisher=Basil Blackwell |location=Oxford |pages=66 |isbn=978-0853280224}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=[[William Hughes (geographer)|William Hughes]], 1863}}

Geography as a discipline can be split broadly into two main subsidiary fields: [[human geography]] and [[physical geography]]. The former largely focuses on the [[built environment]] and how humans create, view, manage, and influence space. The latter examines the natural environment, and how [[organism]]s, climate, [[soil]], [[water]], and [[landform]]s produce and interact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=What is geography? |work=AAG Career Guide: Jobs in Geography and related Geographical Sciences |publisher=American Association of Geographers |url=http://www.aag.org/Careers/What_is_geog.html |accessdate=October 9, 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061006152742/http://www.aag.org/Careers/What_is_geog.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = October 6, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The difference between these approaches led to a third field, [[environmental geography]], which combines physical and human geography and concerns the interactions between the environment and humans.&lt;ref name="Hayes-Bohanan"/&gt;

==Branches==

===Physical geography===
{{Main|Physical geography}}

Physical geography (or physiography) focuses on geography as an [[Earth science]]. It aims to understand the physical problems and the issues of [[lithosphere]], [[hydrosphere]], [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]], [[pedosphere]], and global [[flora]] and [[fauna]] patterns ([[biosphere]]).

{{Main|Integrated geography}}

Environmental [[Integrated geography|geography]] is concerned with the description of the spatial interactions between humans and the [[Natural environment|natural world]]. It requires an understanding of the traditional aspects of physical and human geography, as well as the ways that human societies conceptualize the environment. Environmental geography has emerged as a bridge between the human and the physical geography, as a result of the increasing specialisation of the two sub-fields. Furthermore, as human relationship with the environment has changed as a result of [[globalization]] and [[technological change]], a new approach was needed to understand the changing and dynamic relationship. Examples of areas of research in the environmental geography include: [[emergency management]], [[environmental management]], [[sustainability]], and [[political ecology]].

===Geomatics===
{{Main|Geomatics}}

[[File:Geabios3d.jpg|thumb|right|Digital Elevation Model (DEM)]]
[[Geomatics]] is concerned with the application of computers to the traditional spatial techniques used in [[cartography]] and [[topography]]. Geomatics emerged from the [[quantitative revolution]] in geography in the mid-1950s. Today, geomatics methods include [[spatial analysis]], [[geographic information system|geographic information systems (GIS)]], [[remote sensing]], and [[global positioning system|global positioning systems (GPS)]]. Geomatics has led to a revitalization of some geography departments, especially in Northern America where the subject had a declining status during the 1950s.

===Regional geography===
{{Main|Regional geography}}

Regional geography is concerned with the description of the unique characteristics of a particular region such as its natural or human elements. The main aim is to understand, or define the uniqueness, or character of a particular region that consists of natural as well as human elements. Attention is paid also to [[regionalisation|regionalization]], which covers the proper techniques of space [[delimitation]] into regions.

===Related fields===
* [[Urban planning]], [[regional planning]], and [[spatial planning]]: Use the science of geography to assist in determining how to develop (or not develop) the land to meet particular criteria, such as safety, beauty, economic opportunities, the preservation of the built or natural heritage, and so on. The planning of towns, cities, and rural areas may be seen as [[applied geography]].
* [[Regional science]]: In the 1950s, the regional science movement led by [[Walter Isard]] arose to provide a more quantitative and analytical base to geographical questions, in contrast to the descriptive tendencies of traditional geography programs. Regional science comprises the body of knowledge in which the spatial dimension plays a fundamental role, such as [[regional science|regional economics]], [[resource management]], [[location theory]], [[urban planning|urban]] and [[regional planning]], [[transport]] and [[communication]], [[human geography]], population distribution, [[landscape ecology]], and environmental quality.
* [[Planetary science|Interplanetary Sciences]]: While the discipline of geography is normally concerned with the [[Earth]], the term can also be informally used to describe the study of other worlds, such as the [[planet]]s of the [[Solar System]] and even beyond. The study of systems larger than the Earth itself usually forms part of [[Astronomy]] or [[Cosmology]]. The study of other planets is usually called [[planetary science]]. Alternative terms such as [[Geology of Mars|areology]] (the study of Mars) have been proposed but are not widely used.

==Techniques==
As spatial interrelationships are key to this synoptic science, [[map]]s are a key tool. Classical [[cartography]] has been joined by a more modern approach to geographical analysis, computer-based [[geographic information system]]s (GIS).

In their study, geographers use four interrelated approaches:
* Systematic&amp;nbsp;– Groups geographical knowledge into categories that can be explored globally.
* Regional&amp;nbsp;– Examines systematic relationships between categories for a specific region or location on the planet.
* Descriptive&amp;nbsp;– Simply specifies the locations of features and populations.
* Analytical&amp;nbsp;– Asks ''why'' we find features and populations in a specific geographic area.

===Cartography===
[[File:Cook chart of New Zealand.jpg|thumb|[[James Cook]]'s 1770 chart of [[New Zealand]]]]
{{Main|Cartography}}

Cartography studies the representation of the Earth's surface with abstract symbols (map making). Although other subdisciplines of geography rely on maps for presenting their analyses, the actual making of maps is abstract enough to be regarded separately. Cartography has grown from a collection of drafting techniques into an actual science.

Cartographers must learn [[cognitive psychology]] and [[ergonomics]] to understand which symbols convey information about the Earth most effectively, and [[behaviorism|behavioural psychology]] to induce the readers of their maps to act on the information. They must learn [[geodesy]] and fairly advanced [[mathematics]] to understand how the [[Figure of the Earth|shape of the Earth]] affects the distortion of map symbols projected onto a flat surface for viewing. It can be said, without much controversy, that cartography is the seed from which the larger field of geography grew. Most geographers will cite a childhood fascination with maps as an early sign they would end up in the field.

===Geographic information systems===
{{Main|Geographic information system}}
&lt;!-- the section's use of a singular verb for a seemingly plural noun is intentional. The name of the academic subject is "Geographic information systems". If you didn't care about parallel construction, you could precede the following with THE SUBJECT OF ---&gt;
Geographic information systems (GIS) deal with the storage of information about the Earth for automatic retrieval by a computer, in an accurate manner appropriate to the information's purpose. In addition to all of the other subdisciplines of geography, GIS specialists must understand [[computer science]] and [[database]] systems. GIS has revolutionized the field of cartography: nearly all mapmaking is now done with the assistance of some form of [[List of GIS software|GIS software]]. GIS also refers to the science of using GIS software and GIS techniques to represent, analyse, and predict the spatial relationships. In this context, GIS stands for ''geographic information science''.

===Remote sensing===
{{Main|Remote sensing}}
Remote sensing is the science of obtaining information about Earth features from measurements made at a distance. Remotely sensed data comes in many forms, such as [[satellite imagery]], [[aerial photography]], and data obtained from hand-held sensors. Geographers increasingly use remotely sensed data to obtain information about the Earth's [[land surface]], ocean, and atmosphere, because it: (a) supplies objective information at a variety of spatial scales (local to global), (b) provides a synoptic view of the area of interest, (c) allows access to distant and inaccessible sites, (d) provides spectral information outside the visible portion of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]], and (e) facilitates studies of how features/areas change over time. Remotely sensed data may be analysed either independently of, or in conjunction with other digital data layers (e.g., in a geographic information system).

===Quantitative methods===
{{Main|Geostatistics}}

[[Geostatistics]] deal with [[Numerical data|quantitative data]] analysis, specifically the application of statistical methodology to the exploration of geographic phenomena. Geostatistics is used extensively in a variety of fields, including [[hydrology]], [[geology]], [[petroleum]] exploration, weather analysis, [[urban planning]], [[logistics]], and [[epidemiology]]. The mathematical basis for geostatistics derives from [[cluster analysis]], [[linear discriminant analysis]] and [[non-parametric statistics|non-parametric statistical tests]], and a variety of other subjects. Applications of geostatistics rely heavily on [[geographic information system]]s, particularly for the [[interpolation]] (estimate) of unmeasured points. Geographers are making notable contributions to the method of quantitative techniques.

===Qualitative methods===
{{Main|Ethnography}}
Geographic qualitative methods, or ethnographical research techniques, are used by human geographers. In [[cultural geography]] there is a tradition of employing [[qualitative research]] techniques, also used in [[anthropology]] and [[sociology]]. [[Participant observation]] and in-depth interviews provide human geographers with qualitative data.

The ideas of [[Anaximander]] (c. 610–545 BC): considered by later Greek writers to be the true founder of geography, come to us through fragments quoted by his successors. Anaximander is credited with the invention of the [[gnomon]], the simple, yet efficient Greek instrument that allowed the early measurement of [[latitude]]. [[Thales of Miletus|Thales]] is also credited with the prediction of eclipses. The foundations of geography can be traced to the ancient cultures, such as the ancient, medieval, and early modern [[History of China|Chinese]]. The [[ancient Greece|Greeks]], who were the first to explore geography as both [[art]] and [[science]], achieved this through [[History of cartography|Cartography]], [[Greek philosophy|Philosophy]], and [[Ancient Greek literature|Literature]], or through [[History of mathematics|Mathematics]]. There is some debate about who was the first person to assert that the [[Spherical Earth|Earth is spherical]] in shape, with the credit going either to [[Parmenides]] or [[Pythagoras]]. [[Anaxagoras]] was able to demonstrate that the profile of the Earth was circular by explaining [[eclipse]]s. However, he still believed that the Earth was a flat disk, as did many of his contemporaries. One of the first estimates of the radius of the Earth was made by [[Eratosthenes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/A_Concise_History_of_Solar_and_Stellar_P.html?id=nRtUait0qTgC|title=A Concise History of Solar and Stellar Physics|first=Jean-Louis|last2=Tassoul|first2=Monique|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|year=2004|isbn=978-0691117119|location=London|pages=|quote=|access-date=10 November 2016|via=|author=Tassoul}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first rigorous system of [[Geographic coordinate system|latitude and longitude]] lines is credited to [[Hipparchus]]. He employed a [[sexagesimal]] system that was derived from [[Babylonian mathematics]]. The meridians were sub-divided into 360°, with each degree further subdivided into 60 ([[minute of arc|minutes]]). To measure the longitude at different locations on Earth, he suggested using eclipses to determine the relative difference in time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tmth.edu.gr/en/aet/3/58.html|title=Hipparchus of Rhodes|last=|first=|date=2001|website=tmth.edu.gr|publisher=[[Thessaloniki Science Center and Technology Museum]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720120522/http://www.tmth.edu.gr/en/aet/3/58.html|archive-date=20 July 2008|dead-url=yes|accessdate=10 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The extensive mapping by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] as they explored new lands would later provide a high level of information for [[Ptolemy]] to construct detailed [[atlas]]es. He extended the work of [[Hipparchus]], using a grid system on his maps and adopting a length of 56.5 miles for a degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.math.rutgers.edu/~cherlin/History/Papers2000/sullivan.html|title=Mapmaking and its History|last=Sullivan|first=Dan|date=2000|website=|publisher=[[Rutgers University]]|accessdate=10 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 3rd century onwards, [[History of China|Chinese]] methods of geographical study and writing of geographical literature became much more comprehensive than what was found in Europe at the time (until the 13th century).&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 512"/&gt; Chinese geographers such as [[Liu An]], [[Pei Xiu]], [[Jia Dan]], [[Shen Kuo]], [[Fan Chengda]], [[Zhou Daguan]], and [[Xu Xiake]] wrote important treatises, yet by the 17th century advanced ideas and methods of Western-style geography were adopted in China.

During the [[Middle Ages]], the [[Decline of the Roman Empire|fall of the Roman empire]] led to a shift in the evolution of geography from [[Europe]] to the [[Muslim world|Islamic world]].&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 512"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Needham|first=Joseph|year=1959|title=Mathematics and the Sciences of the Heavens and the Earth|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Science_and_Civilisation_in_China_Volume.html?id=jfQ9E0u4pLAC|journal=Science and Civilization in China|location=Taipei|publisher=Caves Books, Ltd.|volume=3|page=512|isbn=978-0521058018|access-date=10 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Geography in medieval Islam|Muslim geographers]] such as [[Muhammad al-Idrisi]] produced detailed world maps (such as [[Tabula Rogeriana]]), while other geographers such as [[Yaqut al-Hamawi]], [[Abu Rayhan Biruni]], [[Ibn Battuta]], and [[Ibn Khaldun]] provided detailed accounts of their journeys and the geography of the regions they visited. Turkish geographer, [[Mahmud al-Kashgari]] drew a world map on a linguistic basis, and later so did [[Piri Reis]] ([[Piri Reis map]]). Further, Islamic scholars translated and [[interpreting|interpreted]] the earlier works of the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] and the [[ancient Greece|Greeks]] and established the [[House of Wisdom]] in [[Baghdad]] for this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.islamicity.com/education/ihame/default.asp?Destination=/education/ihame/20.asp|title=Science and Scholarship in Al-Andalus|last=|first=|date=|website=IslamiCity.com|publisher=IslamiCity|accessdate=10 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ahmed ibn Sahl al-Balkhi|Abū Zayd al-Balkhī]], originally from [[Balkh]], founded the "Balkhī school" of terrestrial mapping in [[Baghdad]].&lt;ref name="E61-3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Edson|first=Evelyn|last2=Savage-Smith|first2=Emilie|title=Medieval Views of the Cosmos|journal=International Journal of the Classical Tradition|date=Winter 2007|volume=13:3|pages=61–63|jstor=30222166}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suhrāb, a late tenth century Muslim geographer accompanied a book of geographical coordinates, with instructions for making a rectangular world map with [[equirectangular projection]] or cylindrical equidistant projection.&lt;ref name = E61-3/&gt;{{Verify source|date=October 2011}}

He often combined astronomical readings and mathematical equations, in order to develop methods of pin-pointing locations by recording degrees of [[latitude]] and [[longitude]]. He also developed similar techniques when it came to measuring the heights of [[mountain]]s, depths of the [[valley]]s, and expanse of the [[horizon]]. He also discussed [[human geography]] and the [[planetary habitability]] of the [[Earth]]. He also calculated the [[latitude]] of Kath, [[Khwarezm]], using the maximum altitude of the Sun, and solved a complex [[Geodesy|geodesic]] equation in order to accurately compute the [[Earth's circumference]], which was close to modern values of the Earth's circumference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://academic.emporia.edu/aberjame/histgeol/biruni/biruni.htm|title=Abu Rayhan al-Biruni|last=Aber|first=James Sandusky|date=2003|website=academic.emporia.edu|publisher=[[Emporia State University]]|access-date=10 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His estimate of 6,339.9&amp;nbsp;km for the [[Earth radius]] was only 16.8&amp;nbsp;km less than the modern value of 6,356.7&amp;nbsp;km.

The European [[Age of Discovery]] during the 16th and the 17th centuries, where many new lands were discovered and accounts by European explorers such as [[Christopher Columbus]], [[Marco Polo]], and [[James Cook]] revived a desire for both accurate geographic detail, and more solid theoretical foundations in Europe. The problem facing both explorers and geographers was finding the latitude and longitude of a geographic location. The problem of latitude was solved long ago but that of longitude remained; agreeing on what zero meridian should be was only part of the problem. It was left to [[John Harrison]] to solve it by inventing the chronometer [[Harrison Number Four|H-4]] in 1760, and later in 1884 for the [[International Meridian Conference]] to adopt by convention the [[Greenwich meridian]] as zero meridian.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=bz4GyOioMF4C&amp;pg=RA1-PA164#v=onepage|title=Voyages that changed the world|last=Aughton|first=Peter|publisher=[[Penguin Group]]|year=2009|isbn=978-1847240040|location=|page=164|quote=|access-date=10 November 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 18th and the 19th centuries were the times when geography became recognized as a discrete [[List of academic disciplines|academic discipline]], and became part of a typical [[university]] curriculum in [[Europe]] (especially [[Paris]] and [[Berlin]]). The development of many geographic societies also occurred during the 19th century, with the foundations of the [[Société de Géographie]] in 1821,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.socgeo.org/la-societe/qui-sommes-nous|title=Société de Géographie, Paris, France|last=|first=|date=|website=socgeo.org|publisher=Société de Géographie|language=French|accessdate=10 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Royal Geographical Society]] in 1830,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rgs.org/AboutUs/about+us.htm |title=About Us |last= |first= |date= |website=rgs.org |publisher=[[Royal Geographical Society]] |accessdate=10 November 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161018192946/http://www.rgs.org/AboutUs/About%2Bus.htm |archivedate=18 October 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Russian Geographical Society]] in 1845,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rgo.org.ru/ |title=Русское Географическое Общество (основано в 1845 г.) |last= |first= |date= |website=rgo.org.ru |publisher=[[Russian Geological Society]] |language=Russian |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120524183911/http://www.rgo.org.ru/ |archive-date=2012-05-24 |dead-url=yes |accessdate=10 November 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[American Geographical Society]] in 1851,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://americangeo.org/history/|title=History|last=|first=|date=|website=Amergeog.org|publisher=The American Geographical Society|accessdate=10 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161017130118/http://americangeo.org/history/|archive-date=2016-10-17|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[National Geographic Society]] in 1888.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/p/io/unesco/members/48805.htm|title=National Geographic Society|last=|first=|date=|website=state.gov|publisher=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=10 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The influence of [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Alexander von Humboldt]], [[Carl Ritter]], and [[Paul Vidal de la Blache]] can be seen as a major turning point in geography from a philosophy to an academic subject.

Over the past two centuries, the advancements in technology with computers have led to the development of [[geomatics]] and new practices such as participant observation and geostatistics being incorporated into geography's portfolio of tools. In the West during the 20th century, the discipline of geography went through four major phases: [[environmental determinism]], [[regional geography]], the [[quantitative revolution]], and [[critical geography]]. The strong interdisciplinary links between geography and the sciences of [[geology]] and [[botany]], as well as [[economics]], [[sociology]] and [[demographics]] have also grown greatly, especially as a result of [[earth system science]] that seeks to understand the world in a holistic view.

'''Heinrich Harder''' (2 June 1858 – 5 February 1935) was a German [[artist]] and an art professor at the [[Prussian Academy of Arts]] in [[Berlin]].&lt;ref&gt;Bénézit, E. ''Dictionnaire critique et documentaire des peintres, sculpteurs, dessinateurs et graveurs de tous les temps et de tous les pays par un groupe d'écrivains spécialistes français et étrangers'' Paris : Gründ, c1999 (new edition)&lt;/ref&gt;

Heinrich Harder, as a [[landscape painting|landscape painter]], exhibited paintings inspired by the scenery of [[Lüneburg]], [[Mecklenburg]], the [[Harz]] mountains, [[Sweden]] and [[Switzerland]], at the ''Grosse Berliner Kunstausstellung'' in 1891.

He also illustrated [[natural history]] articles. These included a series accompanying [[Wilhelm Bölsche]] articles on earth history for ''[[Die Gartenlaube]]'', a weekly magazine. He also illustrated 60 dinosaur and other prehistoric animal collecting cards for the [[Reichardt Cocoa Company]], titled "Tiere der Urwelt" with accompanying text by Wilhelm Bölsche.

In 1913, Harder designed a series of mosaics on the facade of the aquarium of the [[Berlin Zoological Garden|Berlin Zoo]]. They show primeval creatures like dinosaurs and ammonites.

The '''Horologium Supercluster''', also known as the '''Horologium-Reticulum Supercluster''', is a massive [[supercluster]] spanning around 550 million light-years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/superc/hor.html|title=The Horologium Supercluster|website=www.atlasoftheuniverse.com|access-date=2018-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has a mass of around 10&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt; [[sun|solar masses]], similar to that of the [[Laniakea Supercluster]], which houses the [[Milky Way]]. It is centered on coordinates [[right ascension]] {{RA|03|19}} and [[declination]] {{DEC|&amp;minus;50|02}}, and spans an angular area of 12° × 12°.&lt;ref name=apj130_3/&gt;

The nearest part of the supercluster is 700 million [[light-year]]s away from Earth, while the far end of it is 1.2 billion light-years. It is visible in the [[constellation]]s [[Horologium (constellation)|Horologium]] and [[Eridanus (constellation)|Eridanus]]. The Horologium Supercluster has about 5,000 [[galaxy group]]s (30,000 giant galaxies and 300,000 [[dwarf galaxies]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/superc/hor.html|title=The Horologium Supercluster|website=www.atlasoftheuniverse.com|access-date=2018-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; It includes the galaxy cluster [[Abell 3266]].

'''''In the Presence of Dinosaurs ''''' is book that was published in 2000 by John Colagrande and Larry Felder.

==Details==

''In the Presence of Dinosaurs'' focuses predominantly on the dinosaurs of North America over the course of five different time periods and details the flora, fauna, geology and geography of each time period in a manner akin to a naturalist's viewpoint. The book is divided into seven chapters, each supplemented with illustrations regarding the prominent animals and plants in each time and area.  

===Chapter 1: New World Order=== 
The first chapter focuses on the rise of life in North America after the [[Permian Extinction]] during the [[Triassic]]. The rise of archosaurs as one of the predominant groups is highlighted, along with their competitors, the therapsids. Pterosaurs are shown beginning to take flight. 

Animals mentioned: 
*[[Sharovipteryx]] (illustrated) 
*[[Preondactylus]] (illustrated)
*[[Garjainia]] (illustrated) 
*[[Eoraptor]] (illustrated)
*[[Cynognathus]] (illustrated) 
*[[Megazostrodon]] (illustrated)

===Chapter 2: Veiled Woodlands=== 
This second chapter focuses on the areas that will become the [[Petrified Forest]] during the Triassic. Here, Phytosaurs such as [[Rutiodon]] and Rauisuchians such as [[Postosuchus]] dominate as the region's top predators and Aetosaurs and Dicynodonts play the role of the local large herbivores. Dinosaurs such as [[Coelophysis]] and [[Fabrosaurs]] also dwell here but are considered uncommon animals in the ecosystem. 

Animals mentioned:  
*[[Rutiodon]] 
*[[Placerias]] 
*[[Calyptosuchus]] 
*[[Desmatosuchus]] 
*[[Postosuchus]] 
*[[Hesperosuchus]] 
*[[Icarosaurus]] 
*[[Fabrosaurids]] (real genus not disclosed) 
*[[Metoposaurus]] 
*[[Eudimorphodon]] 
*[[Coelophysis]]

===Chapter 3: Rift Valley=== 
The third chapter focuses on the Early Jurassic rift valleys and lake ecosystems. By this time, the dinosaurs now completely dominate the landscape, and their adaptations that allow them to survive this unpredictable, drought and forest fire-prone environment are discussed.  

Animals mentioned: 
*Coelophysis (species unknown) 
*[[Semionotus]] 
*[[Ammosaurus]]  
*[[Anchisaurus]] 
*[[Dilophosaurus]] 
*[[Diplurus]] 
*[[Fabrosaurids]] 
*[[Trithelodonts]] (illustrated only) 

===Chapter 4: Plains Dominion=== 
Chapter 4 takes place during the Late Jurassic ([[Tithonian]] stage), and focuses on the iconic fauna of the time period, such as [[Apatosaurus]], [[Allosaurus]], and [[Stegosaurus]] among others. Also discussed is how the changing of the wet and dry seasons effect the wildlife and how sauropods influence the landscape. 

Animals mentioned: 
*[[Comodactylus]] 
*[[Mesadactylus]] 
*[[Apatosaurus]] 
*[[Brachiosaurus]] 
*[[Camarasaurus]] 
*[[Stegosaurus]] 
*[[Camptosaurus]]
*[[Othnielia]] 
*[[Ceratosaurus]]  
*[[Allosaurus]] 
*[[Ornitholestes]]
*[[Coelurus]] 
*[[Dryolestida]] (referred to as pantotheres)

===Chapter 5: Wandering Shores=== 
The fifth chapter deals with the [[Niobrara Sea]] during the [[Campanian]] Stage of the Late Cretaceous. The speculative habits of animals such as [[Hesperornis]] and [[Pteranodon]] are examined, and the influence of the sea is discussed. 

Animals mentioned: 
*[[Hydrotherosaurus]] (illustrated only) 
*[[Elasmosaurus]]  
*[[Cretoxyrhina]] (illustrated only)
*[[Hesperornis]] 
*[[Pteranodon]] 
*[[Apsopelix]] 
*[[Nyctosaurus]] 
*[[Ichthyornis]] 
*[[Archelon]] 
*[[Tylosaurus]] 
*[[Ammonites]] 

===Chapter 6: Corridor=== 
Corridor discusses the biodiversity of the dinosaurs of the Campanian stage of [[Laramidia]], the possible migrations they might have made to feed and reproduce, and how those migrations effect both local wildlife and the environment.  

Animals mentioned: 
*[[Parasaurolophus]] 
*[[Corythosaurus]] 
*[[Chasmosaurinae]] 
*[[Centrosaurinae]] 
*[[Hadrosaurus]] 
*[[Tyrannosauridae]] (species not mentioned) 
*[[Troodon]] 
*[[Dromaeosaurus]]  
*[[Ornithomimidae]] 
*[[Hypsilophodontidae]] 

===Chapter 7: Glens of Hell Creek=== 
In this last chapter, the impact of [[Tyrannosaurus]] on its environment and fellow animals is discussed and how it in turn is affected by its prey. 

Animals mentioned: 
*[[Tyrannosaurus]] 
*[[Edmontosaurus]] 
*[[Triceratops]] 
*[[Ankylosaurus]] 
*[[Ornithomimidae]] 
*[[Dromaeosauridae]]
*[[Troodontidae]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4324">The '''interviewer effect''' (also called '''interviewer variance''' or '''interviewer error''') is the distortion of response to a personal or telephone interview which results from differential reactions to the social style and personality of interviewers or to their presentation of particular questions. The use of fixed-wording questions is one method of reducing interviewer bias. Anthropological research and case-studies are also affected by the problem, which is exacerbated by the self-fulfilling prophecy, when the researcher is also the interviewer it is also any effect on data gathered from [[interview]]ing people that is caused by the behavior or characteristics (real or perceived) of the interviewer.

Interviewer effects can also be associated with the characteristics of the interviewer, such as race. Whether black respondents are interviewed by white interviewers or black interviewers has a strong impact on their responses to both attitude questions and behavioral ones. In the latter case, for example, if black respondents are interviewed by black interviewers in pre-election surveys, they are more likely to actually vote in the upcoming election than if they are interviewed by white interviewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Barbara A. Anderson|author2=Brian D. Silver|author3=Paul R. Abramson|lastauthoramp=y|title=The Effects of Race of the Interviewer on Measures of Electoral Participation by Blacks in SRC National Election Studies|journal=Public Opinion Quarterly|volume=52|issue=1|date=Spring 1988|pages=53–83|doi= 10.1086/269082}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, the race of the interviewer can also affect answers to factual questions that might take the form of a test of how informed the respondent is. Black respondents in a survey of political knowledge, for example, get fewer correct answers to factual questions about politics when interviewed by white interviewers than when interviewed by black interviewers. This is consistent with the research literature on [[stereotype threat]], which finds diminished test performance of potentially stigmatised groups when the interviewer or test supervisor is from a perceived higher status group.

Interviewer effects can be mitigated somewhat by randomly assigning subjects to different interviewers, or by using tools such as computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI).&lt;ref name="Groves1986"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Groves|first=Robert M.|author2=Lou J.

'''Jorge E. Bobone''' (1901 – October 21, 1958) was an [[Argentina|Argentinian]] [[astronomer]].

He performed his work at the ''Observatorio Nacional Argentino'' in [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]], established in the 1870s&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oac.uncor.edu/&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Benjamin Apthorp Gould]] and now belonging to the [[Universidad Nacional de Córdoba]].

Between 1928 and 1954 he published multiple papers in the ''Astronomical Journal'' and the ''Astronomische Nachrichten''. The majority of his papers were regarding photographic observations of [[comet]]s, the [[ephemerides]] of [[Himalia (moon)|Jupiter VI]], and some [[asteroid]]s.

The crater [[Bobone (crater)|Bobone]] on the [[Moon]] and the [[asteroid]] [[2507 Bobone]] were named after him.&lt;ref&gt;Schmadel, Lutz; ''Dictionary of Minor Planet Names, Volume 1'', Springer, 2003, page 205&lt;/ref&gt;

| Flag of the [[City of Hobart]]
| The flag of Hobart City Council, of Tasmania, Australia. Designed in 1951 by Hobart architect and alderman, I.G. Anderson and first flown in 1953.

The star is derived from the arms of Lord Hobart, 4th Earl of Buckinghamshire (1760-1816), Secretary of State for War and the Colonies at the time of colonial settlement (1804), and after whom Hobart is named. The colour used on the arms Lord Hobart was, in fact, sable (black), rather than blue.

The red lion is from the Tasmanian flag - and its location at the top of the shield signifies Hobart's position as the Capital City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.hobartcity.com.au/Council/About-Council/Hobart-Coat-of-Arms | title=Hobart Coat of Arms - City of Hobart, Tasmania Australia | accessdate=20 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three intersecting lines in the flag represent the city's three rivers (North Esk, South Esk and Tamar) and the two rectangles in the lines represent tin ingots. The strip across the top with the jagged edge is green to represent the city's parks, gardens and surrounding countryside. Waratah flowers at the top symbolise all flowers and similar beauties of nature. The ingots are included because Launceston used to be a large tin smelting centre. The little circle at the river junction is Launceston.

| Flag of the [[City of Newcastle]]
|The colours are brown over green, taken from the shoulder patch of a Battalion raised in the Newcastle/Hunter region. The shield has a gold chief, containing a black diamond, a white sheep's fleece banded gold and a black wheel, representing the principal pursuits of the area: coal mining, farming and grazing, and industry and trade. Below this, the field is green, with a blue downward pointed triangle (pile) bordered gold, portraying a port with the waters of the sea thrusting into the green land. Fertility is emphasised by the gold border. The crest is a lighthouse, for the Nobby's Head lighthouse at the entrance to the harbour, and sits on a helmet with mural crown (city status) and blue, green and gold mantling. The arms stand on a compartment depicting the golden sand and white waves of the city's beaches (with a scroll inscribed "Enterprise") and are supported by two seagulls with mural crowns (the setting and nature of the city).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/au-ns-ne.html|title=City of Newcastle (NSW, Australia)|website=www.crwflags.com|access-date=2016-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| The flag is a horizontal triband of three colours – white, gold and blue. The top third features three designs. In the top left the arms belong to Thomas Townshend, Viscount Sydney, after whom the city was named. The English Naval Flag in the centre acknowledges the role Arthur Philip played in Sydney's foundation. The red cross is overlaid with a globe and two stars – the principal features of James Cook's Arms, which were granted as a posthumous honour for his service in mapping Australia. The arms in the top right belong to the first Lord Mayor of Sydney, Thomas Hughes. It was during his term of office that the title of Mayor became Lord Mayor, and the official coat of arms for the city was granted. The remaining field of the flag features a ship under full sail, an allusion to the prominence of Sydney as a maritime port.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sydney's flag and flower|url=http://www.cityofsydney.nsw.gov.au/learn/sydneys-history/civic-history/symbols-of-the-city/sydney-flag-and-flower|publisher=City of Sydney|accessdate=26 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rushes''' ('''''[[Juncus]]''''' species) are used as food plants by the [[larva]]e of several [[Lepidoptera]] species:

==[[phagy|Monophagous]]==
Species which feed exclusively on ''Juncus''

[[Coleophoridae]]

==[[phagy|Polyphagous]]==
Species which feed on ''Juncus'' and other plants

[[Batrachedridae]]
* ''[[Batrachedra arenosella]]'' (suspected; larval food habits not well known)

[[Coleophoridae]]
* Several ''[[Coleophora]]'' case-bearer species:
** ''[[Coleophora glaucicolella|C. glaucicolella]]''
** ''[[Coleophora viridicuprella|C. viridicuprella]]'' &amp;ndash; possibly monophagous on ''Juncus''; recorded on [[compact rush]] (''J. conglomeratus''), [[common rush]] (''J. effusus''), [[saltmarsh rush]] (''J. gerardii'') and hard rush (''[[Juncus inflexus|J. inflexus]]''), and perhaps others

This is a '''list''' of '''institutes''' providing '''research''' of the '''Muisca'''. The three most important [[List of universities in Bogotá|universities in Bogotá]] have a department of anthropology to study the indigenous cultures of Colombia. While international research compared to the [[Inca Empire|Inca]], [[Aztec Empire|Aztec]] and [[Maya civilization|Maya]] is quite limited, various other universities have provided knowledge about the Muisca and their culture.

'''Mobilehydricity''' is the process of using hydrogen gas as an [[energy carrier]] to power any type of electrical or mechanical device. An [[energy carrier]] is a substance or system that moves energy in a usable form from one place to another. Electricity is the most well-known energy carrier. We use electricity to move the energy in coal, uranium, and other energy sources from power plants to homes and businesses. We also use electricity to move the energy in gasoline to power our vehicles. The down side is that coal, uranium and gasoline are all resources which are in limited supply and when burned emit toxic pollution to our environment. Using hydrogen as a supplement energy carrier makes sense because it is plentiful and its only waste byproduct is water.

Since hydrogen doesn't exist on earth naturally as a gas, we must extract it from other elements. We can separate hydrogen atoms from water, biomass, or natural gas molecules. The two most common methods for producing hydrogen are steam reforming and water electrolysis 
(water splitting).

[[Steam reforming]] is currently the least expensive method of producing hydrogen and accounts for about 95 percent of the hydrogen produced in the United States. It is used in industries to separate hydrogen atoms from carbon atoms in methane (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;). Because methane 
is a fossil fuel, the process of steam reforming results in greenhouse gas emissions that are linked with global warming.
 
[[Water electrolysis]] is a process that splits hydrogen from water. It results in no emissions but it is currently a very expensive process. New technologies are being developed all the time. Just a few years ago it became economically feasible to generate hydrogen from self-contained modules called disseminators. These units are now small enough to be attached to portable generators, outdoor cooking grills, and even cars.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12448">'''Moral foundations theory''' is a [[social psychological]] theory intended to explain the origins of and variation in human moral reasoning on the basis of innate, modular foundations. It was first proposed by the psychologists [[Jonathan Haidt]] and Jesse Graham, building on the work of cultural anthropologist [[Richard Shweder]]; and subsequently developed by a diverse group of collaborators, and popularized in Haidt's book ''[[The Righteous Mind]]''.

The original theory proposed five foundations: Care/Harm, Fairness/Cheating, Loyalty/Betrayal, Authority/Subversion, and Sanctity/Degradation; however, its authors envisioned the possibility of including more.

Although the initial development of moral foundations theory focused on cultural differences, subsequent work with the theory has largely focused on political ideology. Various scholars have offered moral foundations theory as an explanation of differences among political [[progressives]] ([[Liberalism|liberals]] in the American sense), [[conservatives]], and [[libertarians]], and have suggested that it can explain variation in opinion on politically charged issues such as same sex marriage and abortion.

The two main sources are ''The Pragmatic Validity of Moral Pluralism''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~jessegra/papers/GHKMIWD.inpress.MFT.AESP.pdf Moral Foundations Theory: The Pragmatic Validity of Moral Pluralism]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Mapping the Moral Domain''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~jessegra/papers/GNHIKD.2011.Mapping%20the%20moral%20domain.JPSP.pdf Mapping the Moral Domain]&lt;/ref&gt; In the first Haidt and Graham describe their work as looking, as anthropologists, at the evolution of morality and finding the common ground between each variation. In the second they describe and defend their method, known as the Moral Foundations Questionnaire. Through various trials and a participation population that consisted of over 11 thousand people, from all ages and political beliefs, they were able to find results that supported their prediction.

==Origins==
Moral foundations initially arose as a reaction against the developmental rationalist theory of morality associated with [[Lawrence Kohlberg]] and [[Jean Piaget]]. Building on Piaget's work, Kohlberg argued that children's moral reasoning changed over time, and proposed an explanation through his six [[Kohlberg's stages of moral development|stages of moral development]]. Kohlberg's work emphasized justice as the key concept in moral reasoning, seen as a primarily cognitive activity, and became the dominant approach to moral psychology, heavily influencing subsequent work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Donleavy|first=Gabriel|title=No Man's Land: Exploring the Space between Gilligan and Kohlberg|journal=Journal of Business Ethics|date=July 2008|volume=80|issue=4|pages=807–822|jstor=25482183|doi=10.1007/s10551-007-9470-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Haidt&gt;{{cite book|last=Haidt|first=Jonathan|title=The Righteous Mind: Why Good People are Divided By Politics and Religion|year=2012|publisher=Pantheon Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0-307-37790-6|pages=9–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haidt writes that he found Kohlberg's theories unsatisfying from the time he first encountered them in graduate school because they "seemed too cerebral" and lacked a focus on issues of [[emotion]].

In contrast to the dominant theories of morality in psychology, the anthropologist Richard Shweder developed a set of theories emphasizing the cultural variability of moral judgments, but argued that different cultural forms of morality drew on "three distinct but coherent clusters of moral concerns", which he labeled as the ethics of autonomy, community, and divinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shweder|first=Richard|author2=Jonathan Haidt|title=Commentary to Feature Review: The Future of Moral Psychology: Truth, Intuition, and the Pluralist Way|journal=Psychological Science|date=November 1993|volume=4|issue=6|page=363|jstor=40062563|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.1993.tb00582.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shweder's approach inspired Haidt to begin researching moral differences across cultures, including fieldwork in Brazil and Philadelphia. This work led Haidt to begin developing his [[Social intuitionism|social intuitionist]] approach to morality. This approach, which stood in sharp contrast to Kohlberg's rationalist work, suggested that "moral judgment is caused by quick moral intuitions" while moral reasoning simply serves as a post-hoc rationalization of already formed judgments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Haidt|first=Jonathan|title=The Emotional Dog and Its Rational Tail: A Social Intuitionist Approach to Moral Judgement|journal=Psychological Review|date=October 2001|volume=108|issue=4|page=817|url=http://www.nd.edu/~wcarbona/Haidt%202001.pdf|doi=10.1037/0033-295x.108.4.814}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haidt's work and his focus on quick, intuitive, emotional judgments quickly became very influential, attracting sustained attention from an array of researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miller|first=Greg|title=The Roots of Morality|journal=Science|date=9 May 2008|volume=320|issue=5877|pages=734–737|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/320/5877/734.full|doi=10.1126/science.320.5877.734}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Haidt and his collaborators worked within the social intuitionist approach, they began to devote attention to the sources of the intuitions that they believed underlay moral judgments. In a 2004 article published in the journal [[Daedalus (journal)|Daedalus]], Haidt and Craig Joseph surveyed works on the roots of morality, including the work of [[Donald Brown (anthropologist)|Donald Brown]], [[Alan Fiske]], [[Shalom Schwartz]], and Shweder. From their review, they suggested that all individuals possess four "intuitive ethics", stemming from the process of [[human evolution]] as responses to adaptive challenges. They labelled these four ethics as suffering, hierarchy, reciprocity, and purity.  According to Haidt and Joseph, each of the ethics formed a module, whose development was shaped by culture.  They wrote that each module could "provide little more than flashes of affect when certain patterns are encountered in the social world", while a cultural learning process shaped each individual's response to these flashes. Morality diverges because different cultures utilize the four "building blocks" provided by the modules differently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Haidt|first=Jonathan|author2=Craig Joseph|title=Intuitive ethics: how innately prepared intuitions generate culturally variable virtues|journal=Daedalus|date=Fall 2004|volume=133|issue=4|pages=55–66|url=http://faculty.virginia.edu/haidtlab/articles/haidt.joseph.2004.intuitive-ethics.pub035.pdf|doi=10.1162/0011526042365555}}&lt;/ref&gt; This article became the first statement of moral foundations theory, which Haidt, Joseph, and others have since elaborated and refined.

==The five foundations==
* ''Care'': cherishing and protecting others; opposite of ''harm''
* ''Fairness'' or ''proportionality'': rendering justice according to shared rules; opposite of ''cheating''
* ''Loyalty'' or ''ingroup'': standing with your group, family, nation; opposite of ''betrayal''
* ''Authority'' or ''respect'': submitting to tradition and legitimate authority; opposite of ''subversion''
* ''Sanctity'' or ''purity'': abhorrence for disgusting things, foods, actions; opposite of ''degradation''

A sixth foundation, ''liberty'' (opposite of ''oppression'') was theorized by [[Jonathan Haidt]] in ''[[The Righteous Mind]]'', chapter eight, in response to the need to differentiate between proportionality fairness and the objections he had received from conservatives and [[Libertarianism in the United States|libertarians]] (United States usage) to coercion by a dominating power or person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0042366|journal=PLOS One|last1=Iyer|first1=Ravi|first2=Spassena|last2=Koleva|first3=Jesse|last3=Graham|first4=Peter|last4=Ditto|first5=Jonathan|last5=Haidt|accessdate=2017-09-21|title=Understanding Libertarian Morality: The Psychological Dispositions of Self-Identified Libertarians|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0042366|volume=7|year=2012|page=e42366}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Haidt noted that the latter group's moral matrix relies almost entirely on the ''liberty'' foundation.

==Applications==

=== Political ideology===
[[File:MFQResultsExample2.jpg|thumb|Results of the Moral Foundations Questionnaire]]
Researchers have found that people's sensitivities to the five moral foundations correlate with their political ideologies. Using the Moral Foundations Questionnaire, Haidt and Graham found that liberals are most sensitive to the Care and Fairness foundations, while conservatives are equally sensitive to all five foundations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Haidt|first=Jonathan|last2=Graham|first2=Jesse|year=2011|title=Mapping Moral Domain|url=|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=101|issue=2|pages=366–385|via=|doi=10.1037/a0021847|pmc=3116962}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Libertarians have been found to be sensitive to the proposed Liberty foundation.&lt;ref name="Haidt" /&gt; According to Haidt, this has significant implications for political discourse and relations. Because members of two political camps are to a degree blind to one or more of the moral foundations of the others, they may perceive morally-driven words or behavior as having another basis—at best self-interested, at worst evil, and thus demonize one another.&lt;ref name="Moyers"&gt;{{cite AV media

Researchers postulate that the moral foundations arose as solutions to problems common in the [[Evolutionary psychology|ancestral hunter-gatherer environment]], in particular intertribal and intra-tribal conflict. The three foundations emphasized more by conservatives (Loyalty, Authority, Sanctity) bind groups together for greater strength in intertribal competition while the other two foundations balance those tendencies with concern for individuals within the group. With reduced sensitivity to the group moral foundations, progressives tend to promote a more [[universalist]] morality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sinn | first1 = J. S. | last2 = Hayes | first2 = M. W. | year = 2017 | title = Replacing the Moral Foundations: An Evolutionary‐Coalitional Theory of Liberal‐Conservative Differences | url = | journal = Political Psychology | volume = 38 | issue = 6| pages = 1043–1064 | doi=10.1111/pops.12361}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cross-cultural differences===
Haidt's initial field work in Brazil and Philadelphia in 1989, and [[Odisha]], India in 1993, showed that moralizing indeed varies among cultures, but less than by social class (e.g. education) and age. Working-class Brazilian children were more likely to consider both taboo violations and infliction of harm to be morally wrong, and universally so. Members of traditional, [[collectivist]] societies, like political conservatives, are more sensitive to violations of the community-related moral foundations. Adult members of so-called WEIRD (western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic) societies are the most [[individualistic]], and most likely to draw a distinction between harm-inflicting violations of morality and violations of convention.&lt;ref name="Haidt" /&gt;

Subsequent investigations of moral foundations theory in other cultures have found broadly similar correlations between morality and political identification to those of the US. In Korea and Sweden, the patterns were the same, with varying magnitudes.&lt;ref name="Kim1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kim|first=Kisok|author2=Je-Sang Kang|author3=Seongyi Yun|title=Moral intuitions and political orientation: Similarities and differences between Korea and the United States|journal=Psychological Reports|date=August 2012|volume=111|issue=1|pages=173–185|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0050092|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0050092}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Science outreach''', also called '''Education and Public Outreach''' ('''EPO''' or '''E/PO''') or simply '''public outreach''',{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} is an [[umbrella term]] for a variety of activities by [[research institute]]s, [[University|universities]], and institutions such as [[science museum]]s, aimed at promoting [[Public awareness of science|public awareness (and understanding) of science]] and making informal contributions to [[science education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Varner, Johanna|title=Scientific outreach: toward effective public engagement with biological science|journal=BioScience|volume=64|issue=4|year=2014|pages=333–340|doi=10.1093/biosci/biu021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope and history==

While there have always been individual scientists interested in educating the public, science outreach has recently become more organized. For example, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration ([[NASA]]) now requires all of its projects to organize suitable outreach activities.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} Also working to inform the public are organizations such as Communicating Astronomy to the Public&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.communicatingastronomy.org/meetings/ Communicating Astronomy to the Public]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Washington Declaration on Communicating Astronomy to the Public&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrao.edu/ccap/conf_wash.shtml Washington Declaration on Communicating Astronomy to the Public]&lt;/ref&gt; that organize conferences for the public on science issues and make efforts to put outreach on a more general institutional footing.

Recently, an increasing number of projects have hired designated outreach scientists (part-time or full-time) that handle public relations for their project. There are also specialized outreach providers such as the Education branch of the [[Space Science Institute]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spacescience.org/education/index.html Education branch of the Space Science Institute]&lt;/ref&gt; in Boulder, Colorado and the [[NASA Education and Public Outreach Group at Sonoma State University|Education and Public Outreach Group]] at [[Sonoma State University]] which offer to organize a project's outreach activities on a contractual basis.

In addition to outreach by research institutions, an important part of informal science education are outreach programs such as [[science museum]]s and [[science festival]]s.

==Examples of science outreach activities==

Science outreach can take on a variety of forms.

===Public talks/lectures/discussions===
[[File:Universum für Alle - New book showcases ESO images.jpg|thumb|Universum für Alle: 70 short popular lectures at [[Heidelberg University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New Book Showcases ESO Images|url=http://www.eso.org/public/announcements/ann12091/|accessdate=3 December 2012|newspaper=ESO Announcements}}&lt;/ref&gt; ]]

Lectures are probably the oldest form of science outreach, dating back to the 1820s when [[Michael Faraday]] organized the first of the [[Royal Institution|Royal Institution's]] [[Royal Institution Christmas Lectures|Christmas Lectures]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The RI Christmas Lectures (Royal Institution Website)| url=http://www.rigb.org/rimain/events/christmaslectures.jsp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public talks can be part of a lecture series, given at a [[science festival]] or in cooperation with a special interest group such as a local [[astronomy club]]. Public presentations can have a variety of formats, including straightforward lecture formats with or without [[Scientific demonstration|experimental demonstrations]], guided live interviews, and discussions with several participants and a moderator. There are also less formal initiatives such as [[Café Scientifique]], in which a café or bar is the venue for regular meetings involving guest scientists that come to talk about their work or take part in discussions with members of the public.

===Visiting primary and secondary schools===

School students and teachers are an important target group for science outreach. Outreach activities can include scientists visiting schools, giving talks at assemblies, discussions with students, or participation in events such as [[career fair]]s and science and technology camps.  One organization that focuses on this kind of science outreach is [[Robogals]]. Many universities also have science outreach programs that are dedicated to building relationships between high school students, university scientists, and K-12 teachers. A few of the most prominent university science outreach programs include Carolina Science Outreach,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Carolina Science Outreach | url=http://www.csousc.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Vanderbilt Student Volunteers for Science,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Vanderbilt Student Volunteers for Science | url=http://studentorgs.vanderbilt.edu/vsvs/}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Rockefeller University Science Outreach Program,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Rockefeller University Science Outreach Program | url=http://www.rockefeller.edu/outreach/}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Present Your Ph.D. Thesis to a 12-Year Old Outreach Project at University of Texas in Austin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Science Educational Outreach Programs That Benefit Students and Scientists | url=http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002368}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Stanford University Office of Science Outreach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Stanford University Office of Science Outreach| url=http://oso.stanford.edu/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using Canada as an example, it has been estimated that with sufficient organization, every classroom from kindergarten through graduation could in practice receive a visit from one or more scientists annually with participation from only 10-15% of the scientific enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;Bechara J. Saab, [http://www.hypothesisjournal.com/?p=902 "Engaging the Clutch of the Science Communication Continuum – Shifting Science Outreach into High Gear"], ''Hypothesis'' Volume 8 Issue 1 (September 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples of science outreach programs in Canada include: [[Let's Talk Science]], [[Actua (Canadian charity)|Actua]], [[Chemical Institute of Canada|The Chemical Institute of Canada]], and [[Science Rendezvous]]. 

===Workshops/schools for teachers and/or students===
[[File:Cover of the ALMA radioastronomy manual.jpg|thumb|Cover of the [[Atacama Large Millimeter Array|ALMA]] [[radioastronomy]] manual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ALMA Material for Teachers|url=http://www.eso.org/public/announcements/ann15052/|accessdate=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Inviting groups of school students to a research institution for a workshop is another popular form of outreach.  Formats range from a one-day visit to more involved week-long events such as [[Perimeter Institute]]'s International Summer School for Young Physicists, a two-week-long programs for a total of a hundred Canadian and international students from grade 11.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perimeterinstitute.ca/Outreach/Education/ISSYP_Overview International Summer School for Young Physicists]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another method of science outreach invites school teachers to participate in workshops where they are able to learn effective strategies to engage students in science. This approach was especially embraced by the [[Canadian Space Agency]] which held an annual "Space Educators" conference up until 2012 to provides teachers with access to resources to educate their students in space-related science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Canadian Space Agency Educators Resources | url=http://www.asc-csa.gc.ca/eng/educators/default.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Supporting science fairs and similar events===
[[File:Cloud chamber as science for general public.jpg|thumb|One of the major goals of [[science festival]]s is to make [[science]] more accessible to [[general public]]. [[Cloud chamber]]s are popular at [[science fair]]s for their ability to visualize otherwise [[invisible]] [[radiation]] that surrounds us.]]
Besides organizing independent events, many outreach organizations sponsor existing events that promote sciences awareness. A notable examples are [[science fair]]s, [[public science]] events in which working scientists can participate both as judges and as sponsors of student projects.

=== Online aggregation of science activities, resources, and programs ===
The internet is a rich source of science activities, resources, and programs. For example, research laboratories often maintain educational outreach projects aimed at translating their science into something meaningful for the general public, often [[K–12|K-12]] students, as an effort to increase research broader impacts required by funding agencies such as the NSF.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/od/oia/special/broaderimpacts/|title=Broader Impacts - National Science Foundation|website=www.nsf.gov|access-date=2016-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; These may include activities using fast-growing plants that exhibit distinctive mutants with unique [[phenotype]]s useful to teach K-12 students about both Mendelian and molecular genetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fpsc.wisc.edu/program/index.shtm|title=FPsc: genetics, evolution, modern genetic sciences|website=fpsc.wisc.edu|access-date=2016-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some institutions and organizations maintain large&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://science.wisc.edu/|title=Home {{!}} science.wisc.edu {{!}} University of Wisconsin–Madison|website=science.wisc.edu|access-date=2016-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; or small&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sanfordlab.org/education/updates|title=Education and Outreach {{!}} Sanford Underground Research Facility|website=www.sanfordlab.org|access-date=2016-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; aggregations of their activity resources,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sanfordlab.org/education/curriculum-modules|title=Curriculum Modules {{!}} Sanford Underground Research Facility|website=www.sanfordlab.org|access-date=2016-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; outreach programs,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://science.wisc.edu/outreachprograms.htm|title=Outreach Programs {{!}} science.wisc.edu {{!}} University of Wisconsin–Madison|website=science.wisc.edu|access-date=2016-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; upcoming events calendars,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://today.wisc.edu/events/feed/2/|title=Science / UW-Madison Events Calendar|website=today.wisc.edu|access-date=2016-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and partnering programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://science.wisc.edu/sciencealliance.htm|title=Science Alliance {{!}} science.wisc.edu {{!}} University of Wisconsin–Madison|website=science.wisc.edu|access-date=2016-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Spanish National Research Council'''&lt;ref&gt;Although this is the name officially used as translation in the website of the institution, the actual word-by-word translation would be ''High Council of Scientific Research''&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-es|Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas}}, '''CSIC''') is the largest public institution dedicated to research in [[Spain]] and the third largest in [[Europe]]. Its main objective is to develop and promote research that will help bring about scientific and technological progress, and it is prepared to collaborate with Spanish and foreign entities in order to achieve this aim.

CSIC plays an important role in scientific and technological policy, since it encompasses an area that takes in everything from basic research to the transfer of knowledge to the productive sector. Its research is driven by its centres and institutes, which are spread across all the autonomous regions. CSIC has 6% of all the staff dedicated to Research and Development in Spain, and they generate approximately 20% of all scientific production in the country.&lt;ref name="Rodrigo Montero, 2009"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.congreso.es/public_oficiales/L9/CONG/DS/CO/CO_244.PDF#page=4 |title=Comparecencia del Director General del CSIC, ante el Congreso de los Diputados, para informar sobre el funcionamiento y los resultados del CSIC y su aportación a la investigación|website=Congreso.es|accessdate=2017-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also manages a range of important facilities; the most complete and extensive network of specialist libraries, and also has joint research units.

Significant latest research by CSIC is the [[Temperature and Winds for InSight]] (TWINS) module, which is a component of NASA's ''[[InSight]]'' Mars lander, which landed successfully on November 26, 2018. TWINS will monitor weather at the Mars landing site.

==Origins==
The CSIC was created in 1939 by the recently victorious [[Francoist]] regime from the assets of the ''Junta para la Ampliación de Estudios'' (JAE) (1907–1939), born within the [[Institución Libre de Enseñanza]] and inspired in the [[Karl Christian Friedrich Krause|Krausist]] philosophy. The initial mandate of the CSIC was to ''restore the classical and Christian unity of the sciences that was destroyed in the 18th century'' ("la restauración de la clásica y cristiana unidad de las ciencias destruida en el siglo XVIII").&lt;ref name="El Pais, 2015"&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://elpais.com/elpais/2015/07/24/ciencia/1437736052_945031.html?rel=epr |title=La ciencia que desmanteló Franco|website=Elpais.com|accessdate=2017-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="El Pais, 2015b"&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://elpais.com/elpais/2014/11/24/ciencia/1416857980_556372.html |title=El CSIC se olvida de su herencia franquista|website=Elpais.com|accessdate=2017-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; From its 1939 foundation to his 1966 death, its head was [[José María Albareda]], one of the first members of the [[Opus Dei]] and a close friend of its founder, [[Josemaría Escrivá]]. José María Albareda was ordained a priest in 1959, and at his death was succeeded as head of CSIC by Manuel Lora-Tamayo, then the Education minister of [[Francisco Franco|Franco]].

==Duties==
According to the Statute’s article 5 of CSIC State Agency,&lt;ref name="BOE 2008"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boe.es/aeboe/consultas/bases_datos/doc.php?coleccion=iberlex&amp;id=2008/00591 |title=Real Decreto 1730/2007 de 21 de diciembre por el que se crea la Agencia Estatal Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas y se aprueba su Estatuto|website=Boe.es|accessdate=2017-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; the current objectives and functions of the CSIC are:

==Scientific-technical areas==
Its multidisciplinary and multisectorial nature means CSIC covers all fields of knowledge. Its activity is organised around eight scientific-technical areas:

* Area 1. humanities and social sciences&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csic.es/web/guest/humanidades-y-ciencias-sociales|title=humanidades y ciencias sociales|work=Csic.es}}&lt;/ref&gt;in 17 centres
* Area 2. biology and [[biomedical science]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csic.es/web/guest/biologia-y-biomedicina|title=biología y biomedicina|work=Csic.es}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 22 centres
* Area 3. natural resources&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csic.es/web/guest/recursos-naturales|title=recursos naturales|work=Csic.es}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 24 centres
* Area 4. [[Agricultural sciences]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csic.es/web/guest/ciencias-agrarias|title=ciencias agrarias|work=Csic.es}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 23 centres
* Area 5. [[Physical Science]] and physical technology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csic.es/web/guest/ciencia-y-tecnologias-fisicas|title=ciencia y tecnologías físicas|work=Csic.es}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 24 centres

==Large facilities==
CSIC  manages the "Singular Scientific and Technological Infrastructures" (ICTS) which are facilities involving relatively high investment and maintenance costs in relation to R&amp;D investment budgets in their field. The science community and society at large can access them, which is justified by their importance and strategic nature, and for this reason they receive each year many national as well as foreign researchers. These large facilities are recognised and supported by the [[European Union]].

CSIC administers the following 6 Spanish ICTS facilities:
* [[Calar Alto Observatory|Calar Alto Astronomical Observatory]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caha.es/|title=Calar Alto Astronomical Observatory|work=Caha.es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2185">A '''spherically symmetric spacetime''' is a [[spacetime]] whose [[isometry group]] contains a subgroup which is [[Isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the [[rotation group SO(3)]] and the [[Group action#Orbits and stabilizers|orbits]] of this group are 2-spheres (ordinary 2-dimensional [[sphere]]s in 3-dimensional [[Euclidean space]]). The isometries are then interpreted as rotations and a spherically symmetric spacetime is often described as one whose metric is "invariant under rotations". The spacetime metric induces a metric on each orbit 2-sphere (and this induced metric must be a multiple of the metric of a 2-sphere).

Spherical symmetry is a characteristic feature of many solutions of [[Einstein's field equations]] of [[general relativity]], especially the [[Schwarzschild solution]]. A spherically symmetric spacetime can be characterised in another way, namely, by using the notion of [[Killing vector fields]], which, in a very precise sense, [[symmetries in general relativity|preserve the metric]]. The isometries referred to above are actually [[local diffeomorphism|local flow diffeomorphisms]] of Killing vector fields and thus generate these vector fields. For a spherically symmetric spacetime &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, there are precisely 3 rotational Killing vector fields. Stated in another way, the dimension of the [[projective vector fields|Killing algebra]] is 3 
:&lt;math&gt;\dim K(M) = 3&lt;/math&gt;.

It is known (see [[Birkhoff's theorem (relativity)|Birkhoff's theorem]]) that any spherically symmetric solution of the [[vacuum field equations]] is necessarily isometric to a subset of the maximally extended [[Schwarzschild solution]]. This means that the exterior region around a spherically symmetric gravitating object must be [[static spacetime|static]] and [[asymptotically flat]].

==Description==
Written by a minor proponent of the genre, the purpose of the book is to assist readers to understand the basics of becoming a science fiction author. It describes the various subgenres, writing techniques, and what is entailed with authoring such a piece. Then it describes the publishing business starting with agents, contracts and publishers.

==Reception==
''SFRevu'', in its review, wrote that "the road to publication would be made considerably smoother by the information in this book."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfrevu.com/ISSUES/2001/0101/9981%20Idiots%20Guide%20to%20Publishing%20SF/Idiots%20Guide%20to%20Publishing%20SF.htm ''SFRevu''. Review by Ernest Lilley, 2001 (issue 1, vol. 1)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:The Tech Museum of Innovation 01718.JPG|thumb|left|The Tech during the ''[[Magnificent Desolation: Walking on the Moon 3D|Magnificent Desolation: Walking on the Moon]]'' exhibit, 2010.]]
Planning began in 1978 by members of the Junior League of Palo Alto and later assistance by the San Jose Junior League. The first {{convert|20000|sqft|adj=on}} temporary exhibit finally opened in 1990 "The Garage" as it was named, opened in San Jose's former convention center. On October 31, 1998, it opened a brand-new {{convert|132000|sqft|adj=on}} facility and has had 4,000,000 visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The museum is composed of three floors, each with its own significance. The ground floor includes The Tech Store, The Tech Cafe, the IMAX® Dome Theater and a recreational area that is reserved for special events. The Tech's architecture is the work of Mexican architect [[Ricardo Legorreta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Herhold|first=Scott|title=Herhold: Designer of two San Jose museums dies in Mexico|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_19660901|publisher=San Jose Mercury News|accessdate=13 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four major theme galleries fill the Upper Level and Lower Level of the museum: Communication, Exploration, Innovation and Life Tech. These galleries are constantly being revamped and changed to fit the theme movies and exhibits. On the Lower Level there is also a public piece of artwork titled ''Origin'', which is inside a {{convert|45|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} cylinder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Origin|url=http://www.sanjoseculture.org/public_art/collections/Tech%20Museum%20-%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf|publisher=City of San Jose|accessdate=11 March 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140311062627/http://www.sanjoseculture.org/public_art/collections/Tech%20Museum%20-%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf|archivedate=11 March 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tech Museum of Innovation reflects its social context, capturing Silicon Valley's celebration of technology with a fascination with what the museum's literature refers to as the "gizmos and gadgets" produced by Valley companies. Early reviews, however, criticized The Tech for failing to provide a coherent direction or message.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Perrin|first=Andrew|title=Making Silicon Valley : Culture, Representation, and Technology at the Tech Museum|journal=The Communication Review|year=2002|volume=5|issue=2|page=91|doi=10.1080/10714420212479}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibits==
[[File:The Tech Museum of Innovation 2 2016-05-14.jpg|thumb|The Tech's [[Google Earth]] exhibit.]]
[[File:The Tech Museum of Innovation 3 2016-05-14.jpg|thumb|right|An atrium at The Tech.]]
The Tech has many exhibits dealing with energy efficiency, customization, exploration and genetics.

The Tech Museum of Innovation offers a new approach to viewing galleries from a wide variety of different media. The majority of these exhibits are interactive and allows the viewer to engage in the learning experience. The Tech also has joint partnerships with local attractions, ranging from jazz festivals to the Global Festival of Art.

The [[IMAX]] Dome Theater &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kaplan|first=Tracey|title=Michael L.

It is Northern California's only domed IMAX Theater and can seat up to 280 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imax.com/theatres/t/hackworth-imax-dome-the-tech-museum/|publisher=IMAX|accessdate=5 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social robots===
The Tech has an interactive exhibit where people can design and build robots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Deinzer|first=Erin Caslavka|title=Places where you can interact with robots|url=http://www.sfgate.com/travel/fiveplaces/article/Places-where-you-can-interact-with-robots-5295740.php|publisher=SF Gate|accessdate=11 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Tech Studio===
The Tech created an open-to-the-public workshop space where the in-house prototypers build new exhibits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chan|first=Norman|title=Exhibit Design at The Tech Museum of Innovation|url=http://www.tested.com/art/makers/460508-exhibit-design-tech-museum-innovation/|publisher=Tested.com|accessdate=2 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Temporary exhibitions===
On special occasions The Tech will rent out Parkside Hall from the City of San José to host special larger exhibits. In 2007, this hall was the home to the exhibit known as Body Worlds 2, which brought in over 280,000 guests.  In winter of 2008, there was a special Leonardo da Vinci exhibit (called Leonardo: 500 Years into the Future) that displayed some of his inventions, findings and pictures. It ended January 25, 2009, after a three-week extension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thetech.org/leonardo/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090121122802/http://thetech.org/leonardo/ |archivedate=2009-01-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tech formerly hosted [[Star Wars: Where Science Meets Imagination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Alton|first=Elizabeth|title='Star Wars: Where Science Meets Imagination' Makes Its Final Stop |url=http://entertainmentdesigner.com/news/museum-design-news/star-wars-where-science-meets-imagination-makes-its-final-stop-at-the-silicon-valley-tech-museum-of-innovation/|publisher=Entertainment Designer|accessdate=7 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Tech Virtual===
The Tech Virtual launched in December 2007. On June 4, 2008, the world's first museum exhibits developed using this open source method opened in the museum's own Virtual Test Zone gallery.
The seven exhibits, all contributed under a Creative Commons license and prototyped in the virtual world of Second Life, became part of the museum's Art, Film, Music and Games exhibition. The Virtual Test Zone gallery itself is a prototype exhibit area that will consistently feature virtual-to-real-world exhibits on specific themes resulting from The Tech Virtual programs.

==Management==
The Tech is a registered 501(c)(3) [[nonprofit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Tech Museum of Innovation|url=http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&amp;orgid=4557|publisher=Charity Navigator}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Tech Awards===

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18527">This is a '''[[timeline]] of [[subatomic particle]] discoveries''', including all particles thus far discovered which appear to be [[elementary particle|elementary]] (that is, indivisible) given the best available evidence.  It also includes the discovery of [[composite particle]]s and [[antiparticle]]s that were of particular historical importance.

More specifically, the inclusion criteria are:
* Elementary particles from the [[Standard Model]] of [[particle physics]] that have so far been observed.  The Standard Model is the most comprehensive existing model of particle behavior.  All Standard Model particles including the [[Higgs boson]] have been verified, and all other observed particles are combinations of two or more Standard Model particles.
* Antiparticles which were historically important to the development of particle physics, specifically the [[positron]] and [[antiproton]].  The discovery of these particles required very different experimental methods from that of their ordinary matter counterparts, and provided evidence that ''all'' particles had antiparticles&amp;mdash;an idea that is fundamental to [[quantum field theory]], the modern mathematical framework for particle physics.  In the case of most subsequent particle discoveries, the particle and its anti-particle were discovered essentially simultaneously.
* Composite particles which were the first particle discovered containing a particular elementary constituent, or whose discovery was critical to the understanding of particle physics.

| [[William Herschel]] discovers "heat rays"
|-
|1801
| [[Johann Wilhelm Ritter]] made the hallmark observation that invisible rays just beyond the violet end of the visible spectrum were especially effective at lightening [[silver chloride]]-soaked paper. He called them "oxidizing rays" to emphasize [[Reactivity (chemistry)|chemical reactivity]] and to distinguish them from "heat rays" at the other end of the invisible spectrum (both of which were later determined to be [[photons]]). The more general term "chemical rays" was adopted shortly thereafter to describe the oxidizing rays, and it remained popular throughout the 19th century. The terms chemical and heat rays were eventually dropped in favor of '''[[ultraviolet]]''' and '''[[infrared]]''' [[radiation]], respectively.&lt;ref name="hockberger"&gt;

'''Wilhem de Haan''' (7 February 1801 in [[Amsterdam]] – 15 April 1855 in [[Leiden]]) was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[zoologist]]. He specialised in the study of insects and [[crustacean]]s, and was the first keeper of [[invertebrate]]s at the Rijksmuseum in [[Leiden]], now [[Naturalis]]. He was forced to retire in 1846, when he was partially [[paralysis|paralysed]] by a spinal disease. He was responsible for the invertebrate volume of [[Philipp Franz von Siebold|Siebold]]'s ''[[Fauna Japonica]]'', which was published in 1833, and introduced the western world for the first time to [[Japanese wildlife]]. He named a great many new taxa, and several taxa are named in his honour.

He published significant work on both mantids and phasmids (1842).

The role of women in and affiliated with [[NASA]] has varied over time. Their earliest roles were restricted to supportive or administrative jobs, but by the end of the space program there were [[List of female astronauts|women astronauts]].

==History==
Women first worked in support as administrators, computerists, secretaries, doctors, psychologists, and later engineers. In the 1970s NASA started recruiting women and minorities for the space program with little success. Some of the women who worked in these roles included Mary Shep Burton, Gloria B. Martinez, Cathy Osgood, and Shirley Hunt who all worked in the computer division, and Sue Erwin, Lois Ransdell, and Maureen Bowen who worked as secretaries for various members of the Mission and Flight Control teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kranz|first1=Gene|title=Failure is Not an Option|date=2000|publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]]|location=NewYork, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 1977 the recruitment slowly began to increase after they had [[Nichelle Nichols]] help with recruitment. Part of the advantage she had in recruitment for the space program was that her role as Lieutenant Uhura on [[Star Trek]] helped inspire girls to attempt to become [[astronaut]]s at NASA when they grew up. One of the girls inspired was [[Mae Jemison]] who was the first Black woman astronaut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nichols|first1=Nichelle|title=Beyond Uhura|date=1994|publisher=[[G. P. Putnam's Sons]]|location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another important woman was [[Ellen Ochoa]] who joined NASA in 1988 and became the first Hispanic woman to become an astronaut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Posada-Swaffert|first1=Angela|title=A Place in the Stars; Ellen Ochoa relentlessly pursued her dream|agency=Hispanic|publisher=Hispanic Publishing Corporation|date=June 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some issues NASA faced in recruiting women as well as minorities for the space program was that throughout NASA's history the astronauts had always been white men. This was at least partially caused by the restrictive academic requirements for the earlier astronauts. Originally the astronauts, aside from the specific training from NASA, were required to have master's degrees in various sciences such as engineering so that they could deal with issues that came up during or after the spaceship was launched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Phelps|first1=J. Alfred|title=They Had A Dream|date=1994|publisher=Presidio Press|location=Novato, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another part of the issue was that NASA similar to other businesses, did not look specifically for women to work for them outside of specific areas until the government ratified the Equal Employment Opportunity Act. This discredited NASA with women and minorities when they did try to recruit them as they did not believe NASA actually meant what it said in the recruitment drives. This led to NASA hiring Nichelle Nichols as a recruitment consultant and as the face of their new recruitment drive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nichols|first1=Nichelle|title=Beyond Uhura|date=1994|publisher=G. P. Putnam's Sons|location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; After which the recruitment rates for women and minorities increased and eventually led to women astronauts of various ethnic backgrounds.

'''Xploration Station''' is an [[United States|American]] [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] [[Block programming|programming block]] that is programmed by [[Steve Rotfeld Productions]], distributed by [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], and debuted on September 13, 2014. It airs weekends (typically on Saturday mornings), primarily on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]-affiliated stations. Aimed towards teenagers, the block consists of four half-hour shows focusing on the [[STEM fields]] of [[science]], [[technology]], [[engineering]] and [[mathematics]]. All of the programs in the two-hour block are produced to meet federally mandated [[Children's Television Act|educational programming]] guidelines&lt;ref name="stem block"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fox Stations Add SRP's Two-Hour STEM Block|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/syndication-and-distribution/fox-stations-add-srps-two-hour-stem-block/128024|author=Paige Albiniak|periodical=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]]|publisher=[[NewBay Media]]|date=December 17, 2013|accessdate=June 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; (stations carrying the block continue to provide [[E/I]]-compliant programs acquired from the [[broadcast syndication|syndication]] market to comply with the full three-hour requirement defined by the [[Federal Communications Commission]] for television stations to devote to educational programming each week).

==History==
On December 17, 2013, Steve Rotfeld Productions announced that it would launch a two-hour syndicated block of live-action educational programs under the working title ''Xploration Nation'', with [[Fox Television Stations]] and [[Tribune Broadcasting]] initially set to carry the block across their respective Fox owned-and-operated and affiliated stations. The block, aimed towards teenagers between 13 and 16 years of age, features programs focused on the [[STEM fields]] – such as [[marine biology]], [[astronomy]] and [[animal science]].&lt;ref name="stem block"/&gt;&lt;ref name="xploration"&gt;{{cite web|title=Steve Rotfield Clears New Science and Technology Two Hour E/I Block With FOX Station Group|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2013/12/18/steve-rotfield-clears-new-science-and-technology-two-hour-ei-block-with-fox-station-group/223509/|author=Amanda Kondolojy|website=[[TV by the Numbers]]|publisher=[[Zap2It]] ([[Tribune Digital Ventures]]|date=December 18, 2013|accessdate=June 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Production on one of the four shows, ''Xploration Outer Space'', began in April 2014.&lt;ref name="Outer Space"/&gt; The block, by then renamed ''Xploration Station'', premiered on September 13, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Emily Calandrelli’s new frontier|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/television/2014/09/13/outer-space-scholar-emily-calandrelli-new-frontier/uFPENrdORpthchyYyqYmiJ/story.html|author=Kelly Gifford|newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]]|publisher=Boston Globe Media Partners, LLC|date=September 13, 2014|accessdate=October 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Fox [[owned-and-operated station]]s, ''Xploration Station'' replaced ''[[Weekend Marketplace]]'', a two-hour block of [[infomercial]]s first introduced in January 2009 following the discontinuation of [[4Kids TV]] due to conflicts between Fox and the block's programmer [[4Licensing Corporation|4Kids Entertainment]].&lt;ref name="stem block"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fox Ends Saturday-Morning Cartoons|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/25/business/media/25kidstv.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|date=November 24, 2008|accessdate=January 11, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403021926/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/25/business/media/25kidstv.html |archivedate=April 3, 2015&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Longform ads replace kid fare on Fox|url=http://www.variety.com/VR1117996360.html|author=Michael Schneider|periodical=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Reed Business Information]]|date=November 23, 2008|accessdate=December 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several of the Fox stations that initially picked up the block had previously declined to carry the network's former children's programming blocks ([[Fox Kids]], FoxBox and 4Kids TV) and ''Weekend Marketplace'' – particularly, those owned by the core Fox and Tribune groups that [[1994 United States broadcast TV realignment|affiliated with the network in the mid-1990s]] under [[New World Pictures#New World Communications|New World Communications]] ownership.

On January 20, 2015, Fox Television Stations renewed the block for the group's Fox owned-and-operated stations through 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fox O&amp;Os Renew ‘Xploration Station’|url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/82349/fox-oos-renew-xploration-station|website=TVNewsCheck|publisher=NewsCheck Media|date=January 20, 2015|accessdate=January 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the more notable holdouts for ''Xploration Station'' in its first two seasons was Fox's largest affiliate group, [[Sinclair Broadcast Group]], which has several already existing contracts with other E/I production companies to give them compliant programming to meet the standards throughout a chain which consists of numerous network affiliates; Sinclair's Fox stations instead continue to carry ''Weekend Marketplace'' (the sole exception is [[WLUK-TV]] in [[Green Bay, Wisconsin|Green Bay]], which carries ''Xploration Station'' through an agreement struck prior to the December 2014 closure of Sinclair's purchase of the station and [[The CW|CW]]-affiliated sister [[WCWF]] from [[LIN Media]]). This was rectified in September 2016, when Sinclair began to carry ''Xploration Station'' on their Fox stations and two other Sinclair stations associated with a netlet under a five-year agreement with Steve Rotfeld Productions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sinclair to Partner With SRP for 'Xploration Station' Starting Fall 2016|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/syndication-and-distribution/sinclair-partner-srp-xploration-station-starting-fall-2016/138880|author=Paige Albiniak|periodical=Broadcasting &amp; Cable|publisher=NewBay Media|date=March 17, 2015|accessdate=March 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The block was made available international with the pick up of non-US distribution by [[Temple Street Productions#Boat Rocker Media|Boat Rocker Rights]] in February 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brzoznowski|first1=Kristin|title=Fox’s Syndicated Science Block Xploration Station to Go Global|url=http://worldscreen.com/tvreal/foxs-syndicated-science-block-xploration-station-to-go-global/|accessdate=September 10, 2016|work=TV Real|publisher=WSN, Inc.|date=February 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dickens|first1=Andrew|title=Science shows board Boat Rocker|url=http://www.c21media.net/science-shows-board-boat-rocker/|accessdate=September 10, 2016|work=C21 Media|date=February 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the third season starting September 10, 2016, Xploration Station expanded from 2 to 3 hours while only returning 3 shows and adding 3 new shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |last= |first= |date=August 31, 2016 |title=Steve Rotfeld Productions Expands 'Xploration Station' Weekend TV Block to 3 hours for 2016-17 |url=http://www.cbs58.com/story/32938150/steve-rotfeld-productions-expands-xploration-station-weekend-tv-block-to-3-hours-for-2016-17 |location=Philadelphia |publisher=Steve Rotfeld Productions |agency=PRWEB |access-date=September 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2018 Xploration Station won a Daytime Emmy award for its show ''Xploration Earth 2050'' in the category of “Outstanding Special Class Series.”.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mcall.com/news/breaking/mc-nws-lower-mac-emmy-20180429-story.html|title=Lower Macungie man wins Emmy for science show|last=Tatu|first=Christina|work=themorningcall.com|access-date=2018-06-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
