      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8176">The '''1987 Constitution of Ethiopia''' was the third constitution of [[Ethiopia]], and went into effect on 22 February 1987 after a [[Ethiopian constitutional referendum, 1987|referendum]] on 1 February of that year. Its adoption inaugurated the [[People's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia]] (PDRE).

==Contents==
The document consisted of seventeen chapters and 119 articles. The [[preamble]] traced Ethiopia's origins back to antiquity, proclaimed the historical heroism of its people, praised the country's substantial natural and human resources, and pledged to continue the struggle against [[imperialism]], poverty, and hunger. The government's primary concern was proclaimed to be the country's development through the implementation of the [[Program for the National Democratic Revolution]], which [[kasahun ankosa]] had proclaimed in a speech 20 April 1976. In the process, it was assumed that the material and technical bases necessary for establishing socialism would be created.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;

The constitution attempted to situate Ethiopia in the context of the worldwide movement of "[[progressive states]]" and made no direct reference to Africa. Critics claim that the constitution was no more than an abridged version of the [[1977 Soviet constitution]], with the exception of the sweeping powers vested in the presidency. A second difference between the Ethiopian and Soviet constitutions is that the former declared the country to be a [[unitary state]] rather than a union of republics. It was reported that the problem of nationalities was hotly debated in the Constitutional Commission, as well as in the WPE Central Committee, but the regime would not abandon its desire to create a single multiethnic state rather than a federation.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;

The 835-member legislature, the National Shengo, was defined as the highest organ of state power.  Its members were elected to five-year terms.  Executive power was vested in a president, elected by the National Shengo for a five-year term, and a cabinet also appointed by the Shengo.  The president was chairman of the Council of State, which acted for the legislature between sessions.

Actual power, however, rested in the [[Workers' Party of Ethiopia]], defined as the leading force of state and society.  More specifically, actual power rested with Mengistu, who was not only president of the country but general secretary of the WPE.  He and the other surviving members of the Derg dominated the WPE's Politburo.  In essence, the power structure set up by the constitution was a carbon copy of the power structure in other Communist countries.  The party was granted even more power than the government, which acted more or less as a transmission belt for the party. As was the case with other Communist legislatures, the National Shengo was nominally vested with great lawmaking powers, but actually did little more than rubber-stamp decisions already made by the WPE and its Politburo.

The Constitution guaranteed all manner of civil rights and personal freedoms, such as freedom of speech, the press, religion, movement, assembly, and association. Citizens also had the right to a fair trial and a free education. In practice, as in all Communist regimes, the government paid almost no attention to these freedoms. As had been the case during the Derg era, Ethiopia ranked at or near the bottom of most measures of human rights and civil liberties.

==Drafting==
The primary task facing the [[Workers' Party of Ethiopia]] (WPE) following its formation in 1984 was to devise the new national constitution that would inaugurate the PDRE. In March 1986, a 343-member Constitutional Commission was formed to draft a new constitution based on the principles of [[scientific socialism]]. Eventually, the 122 full and alternate members of the WPE Central Committee who had been appointed to its membership dominated the commission.&lt;ref name=cs&gt;{{Country study

|abbr=et
|editor=Thomas P. Ofcansky and LaVerle Berry 
|date=1991

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Constitutional Commission had its origins in the [[Institute for the Study of Ethiopian Nationalities]], which the Provisional Military Administrative Council (better known as the [[Derg]]) had established March 1983 to find solutions to problems resulting from Ethiopia's vast [[Demographics of Ethiopia|ethnic diversity]]. The Institute was staffed mostly by academics from [[Addis Ababa University]], who continued to serve as advisers to the Constitutional Commission. The commission's diverse membership included religious leaders, artists, writers, doctors, academics, athletes, workers, and former nobility. There was also an attempt by those who chose appointees to the commission to make sure that all major ethnic nationalities had representation in the body.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;

For about six months, the commission debated the details of the new constitution. In June 1986, it issued a 120-article draft document. The government printed and distributed 1 million copies to [[kebeles]] and peasant associations throughout the country. During the next two months, the draft was discussed at about 25,000 locations. The regime used this method of discussion to legitimize the constitution-making process and to test the mood of the populace. In some cases, people attended constitutional discussion sessions only after pressure from local WPE [[cadres]], but in other cases attendance was voluntary. Where popular interest was apparent, it centered on issues such as taxes, the role of religion, marriage, the organization of elections, and citizenship rights and obligations. By far the most controversial draft provision was the one that outlawed [[Polygamy in Ethiopia|polygamy]], which caused a furor among [[Islam in Ethiopia|Muslims]]. Few questions were raised about the document's failure to address the nationalities problem and the right to [[self-determination]]. According to government officials, the citizenry submitted more than 500,000 suggested revisions. In August the commission reconvened to consider proposed amendments. In all, the commission accepted ninety-five amendments to the original draft, most of which, however, were cosmetic.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;

==Referendum==
{{main|Ethiopian constitutional referendum, 1987}}
The national referendum on the constitution was held on 1 February 1987, and Mengistu announced the results three weeks later. He reported that 96 percent of the 14 million people eligible to participate (adults eighteen years of age and older) actually voted. Eighty-one percent of the electorate endorsed the constitution, while 18 percent opposed it (1 percent of the ballots were invalid). Although this was the first election in Ethiopia's history based on [[universal suffrage]], the presence of WPE cadres throughout the country ensured that the constitution would be adopted. In [[Tigray (province)|Tigray]] and [[Eritrea]], however, the regime held referendums only in urban centers because much of these territories was controlled by the [[Tigray People's Liberation Front]] and the [[Eritrean People's Liberation Front]], respectively. In other places, such as parts of [[Welo]] and [[Gondar]] regions, the vote took place amid heightened security measures.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;

Although the constitution officially took effect on the same day the PDRE was proclaimed 22 February 1987, it was not until that September the new government was fully in place and the Derg formally abolished.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;

The '''2011 Montreal Museum of Fine Arts theft''' took place in two separate incidents during September and October of that year. In both instances, the same thief took a small ancient stone piece that was openly exhibited, without a protective case, and smuggled it out of [[Montreal Museum of Fine Arts|the museum]]. One has since been recovered; however, the thief remains unidentified and the whereabouts of the other is not known.

On September 3, one day before the anniversary of [[1972 Montreal Museum of Fine Arts robbery|the 1972 robbery of 18 paintings]], a visitor took a [[sandstone]] [[Achaemenid Empire]] [[relief]]. In late October, he returned to take a Roman marble head from its pedestal. The two works were collectively valued at $1.3 million, with the relief accounting for almost all of that amount. 

The museum did not disclose the theft until February 2012 to avoid compromising the joint investigation by its insurance company and [[Sureté du Québec]]'s [[art theft]] unit. [[Security camera]] footage allowed them to obtain a description of the thief; investigators believed he was local. A reward was offered for the return of the works.

In 2013, police were led to Simon Metke, an [[Edmonton]] man who had bought the Achaemenid piece for [[Canadian dollar|CDN$]]1,400 during a visit to Montreal two years earlier, believing it to possibly be a replica, after it was seen on a wall behind him during a [[CBC News|CBC]] interview unrelated to the case.&lt;ref name="Simon Metke arrest"&gt;{{cite news|title=Stolen artifact from Montreal museum recovered in Edmonton|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/stolen-artifact-from-montreal-museum-recovered-in-edmonton-1.2535754|newspaper=[[CBC News]]|date=February 14, 2014|accessdate=August 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum ultimately declined to buy it back from their insurer and it was put on the market in late 2016.&lt;ref name="Royal Academy frieze page"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Charles Saumarez|last2=Philips|first2=Sam|title=What to see at Frieze 2016|url=https://www.royalacademy.org.uk/article/highlights-of-frieze-london-and-masters-2016|publisher=[[Royal Academy of Art]]|date=October 6, 2016|accessdate=August 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charges laid against Metke were disposed with a [[discharge (sentence)|conditional discharge]] after he pled guilty to [[Possession of stolen goods#Canada|possession of stolen property]]. Metke's story inspired a character in [[Kevin Smith]]'s 2016 film ''[[Yoga Hosers]]'', as well as the film's title.&lt;ref name="Globe and Mail Metke story"&gt;{{cite news|last=Pruden|first=Jana|title=The Edmonton man who inspired 'Yoga Hoser' arrested for possession of a $1.2-million ancient statue|url=https://beta.theglobeandmail.com/news/alberta/simon-metke-the-man-thrust-into-a-strange-world-of-canadian-art-theft/article34855605/|newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]]|date=April 28, 2017|accessdate=August 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thefts==
On September 3, 2011, a visitor who came to the museum shortly after it opened removed a {{convert|20|by|21|by|3|cm|in|adj=on}}&lt;ref name="2011 theft story"&gt;{{cite news|last=Knelman|first=Joshua|title=Two valuable artifacts stolen from Montreal museum|url=https://beta.theglobeandmail.com/arts/two-valuable-artifacts-stolen-from-montreal-museum/article546106/|newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]]|date=February 14, 2012|accessdate=August 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[sandstone]] [[relief]] depicting a soldier's head, produced during the [[Achaemenid Empire]], which ruled Persia during the 5th century BCE.&lt;ref name="Press artifact return story"&gt;{{cite news|last=Montgomery|first=Sue|title=Police track down artifact stolen from Museum of Fine Arts|url=https://www.pressreader.com/canada/montreal-gazette/20140214/281651073005626|newspaper=[[Montreal Gazette]]||via=[[PressReader]]|date=February 14, 2014|accessdate=August 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was small and secured to the wall it was on only by an anchor, and otherwise unprotected by glass. The museum staff has not been able to determine how it was removed. Coincidentally, the theft occurred on the day before the 39th anniversary of the only other theft from the museum, the 1972 robbery of 18 paintings, all but one of which are still missing, the largest art theft in Canadian history.&lt;ref name="2011 theft story" /&gt;

The thief returned approximately eight weeks later, in late October, at the same time of day. This time he took a 1st-century Roman marble head, approximately the same size, from its pedestal. Like the earlier piece, it was secured there by an anchor, but otherwise unprotected, not even by a glass case.&lt;ref name="2011 theft story" /&gt;

==Investigation==

}}
When it discovered the pieces, both of which were part of the museum's permanent [[Collection (artwork)|collection]], missing, the museum called the [[Sureté du Québec]]'s (SQ) [[art theft]] unit, the only one in any Canadian provincial police force, and [[AXA]], its insurance company, which also dispatched a team of art-theft specialists. They investigated the case jointly. After reviewing [[security camera]] footage and interviewing museum staff who had been on duty the days of the thefts, they identified a suspect, a man {{convert|5|ft|7|in|cm}} tall who wore a baseball cap and dark jacket as he walked around the museum. They believed he spoke French and lived in the Montreal area.&lt;ref name="2011 theft story" /&gt;

A large poster in front advertises a pop-art exhibit]]
The museum did not publicly disclose the thefts until January 2012 in order to avoid compromising the investigation. When it did inform the news media, it released a description of the suspect and offered rewards for both the thief's identity and the safe return of the missing items.&lt;ref name="2011 theft story" /&gt; It put their combined value at $1.3 million, most of which was accounted for by the older, Achaemenid piece, with the Roman head valued at a mere $40,000.&lt;ref name="CTV recovery story"&gt;{{cite news|title=Police recover item stolen from Fine Arts Museum|url=http://montreal.ctvnews.ca/man-who-bought-stolen-artwork-didn-t-know-it-was-worth-1-2-million-1.1684657|newspaper=[[CTV Television Network|CTV]]|date=February 14, 2014|accessdate=August 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Fossey, an archaeologist, told [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] later that he believed the two pieces had not been stolen to order but simply because they were "small [and] easy to put in the bag."&lt;ref name="CTV recovery story" /&gt; Another expert involved, art-theft investigator Mark Dalrymple, observed that the case was similar to a series of 2004 thefts from the [[Art Gallery of Ontario]] in [[Toronto]], which also involved small objects taken by visitors while the museum was open to the public, objects whose return he had secured. He said the museum was preparing photos for dissemination worldwide. "[N]o matter where in the world these pieces go, no one can sell them", he told ''[[The Globe and Mail]]''. He advised anyone in possession of the missing art to return it immediately.&lt;ref name="2011 theft story" /&gt;

===Sale of relief===
Unbeknownst to Dalrymple or any of the other investigators, by the time he made that statement at least one of the missing pieces had already been sold. In November 2011 Simon Metke, a [[Yoga as exercise|yoga]] teacher from [[Edmonton]], travelled to Montreal for a visit.&lt;ref name="CTV recovery story" /&gt; A friend of his there had told him that someone he knew was selling what he described as a stone sculpture of a soldier, claiming it was a genuine antiquity. As a result of his own recent spiritual explorations, Metke had developed an interest in ancient cultures, and the friend thought he might be interested in buying the sculpture.&lt;ref name="Globe and Mail Metke story" /&gt;
[[File:Achaemenid relief of guard in Montreal Museum of Fine Arts.jpg|right|thumb|The stolen Achaemenid relief that Metke believed was merely a replica|alt=A stone panel with the head of a bearded man seen in profile, the top of his shield, and an upright spear tip on the left]]
When Metke finally saw the sculpture, actually the Achaemenid [[relief]] that had been stolen from the museum a few months earlier, he was at first skeptical. He believed it might actually be a replica, something that he might otherwise find at modern stores that sell home decor. But he appreciated the workmanship that had gone into it.&lt;ref name="CTV recovery story" /&gt;

The seller's asking price was [[Canadian dollar|CDN$]]1,400. According to Metke's friend, the seller was motivated. "This other guy had to pay his child support you know and pay his rent," Metke recalled later. "He edged me on that it was worth a bunch more."&lt;ref name="CTV recovery story" /&gt;

Still, Metke had some lingering doubts about the item. So he did a [[Google]] search on "Are there any [[Mesopotamian]] artifacts missing?" After he had satisfied himself from the results that he was not buying something looted or stolen, he bought the item, believing that, with [[2012 phenomenon|2012]], the last year in the [[Mayan Calendar]], a month away, it was his destiny to acquire the artwork.&lt;ref name="Globe and Mail Metke story" /&gt; "It symbolized part of my spiritual journey to me."&lt;ref name="CBC arrest story"&gt;{{cite news|title=Stolen artifact from Montreal museum recovered in Edmonton|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/stolen-artifact-from-montreal-museum-recovered-in-edmonton-1.2535754|newspaper=[[CBC News]]|date=February 14, 2014|accessdate=August 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He thought "it would have been kind of fun" to take it to an ''[[Antiques Roadshow]]'' production, or go to the [[Middle East]] himself and have it authenticated. For the time being, he packed the piece in his luggage and flew with it back to Edmonton, where the airline briefly lost the suitcase containing the relief upon his arrival. Once it was located, he took it home and put it in a [[meditation]] area he had set up in his living room.&lt;ref name="Globe and Mail Metke story" /&gt;

Later he moved it to a shelf in his bedroom, where he put it amid a collection of ''[[Star Wars (franchise)|Star Wars]]'' action figures, crystals and stuffed animals.&lt;ref name="Globe and Mail Metke story" /&gt; A month after returning to Edmonton, he gave an interview to a [[CBC News]] crew for a story unrelated to the artwork he had just purchased. It was, however, visible on the shelf behind him in some shots.&lt;ref name="CBC arrest story" /&gt;

==Recovery of relief and arrests==
The interview eventually led to a tip to police. In late 2013 they obtained a [[search warrant|warrant to search]] Metke's Edmonton condominium, and in January 2014 executed it. "The sun's coming in through the window, the bougainvillea flowers are glowing, the crystals are making rainbows," recalled Metke.&lt;ref name="Globe and Mail Metke story" /&gt;

A team of [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] (RCMP) from both [[Alberta]] and [[Quebec]], along with the SQ/AXA investigators, quickly located the relief. It was only then that Metke learned it had been stolen, and was indeed an authentic antique artifact 2,500 years old, not a replica. "I don't think he knew it was worth $1.2 million dollars either," he said of the seller.&lt;ref name="CTV recovery story" /&gt; He felt, again, that it was destiny that had brought the relief to him. "[I]t sort of feels like it may have come to me to be protected so that it didn't get destroyed or lost."&lt;ref name="CBC Metke story"&gt;{{cite news|title=Man accused of owning stolen artifact tells his story|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/man-accused-of-owning-stolen-artifact-tells-his-story-1.2536685|newspaper=[[CBC News]]|date=February 13, 2014|accessdate=August 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the arrest, police suggested they had some leads on the identity of the thief.&lt;ref name="CTV recovery story" /&gt; However, as of 2017 no arrests have been made. The whereabouts of the Roman head are also unknown.&lt;ref name="Globe and Mail Metke story" /&gt;

Police charged Metke with [[Possession of stolen goods#Canada|possession of stolen property over $5,000 in value]], possession of the proceeds of a crime, and possessing a controlled substance for the purpose of trafficking, after they also found drugs in the residence. Metke's girlfriend faced the former two charges related to the relief as well.&lt;ref name="CBC arrest story" /&gt; Fossey, who was in Edmonton that day as well, flew home to Montreal with the relief that night. "It's a day I'll never forget, flying back with it in a box at my feet," he said later.&lt;ref name="Press artifact return story" /&gt; 

The museum, however, would have to consider whether to buy it back from AXA, since once it was recovered it became the insurer's legal property; commonly a buyback clause in the policy allows a museum to do this by returning the money paid.

==Trial==
The Crown later [[Stay of proceedings|stayed]] two of the three charges against Metke, and all that it had laid against his girlfriend. In April 2017, he pled guilty to the possession of stolen goods charge. A statement of facts his lawyers agreed on with prosecutors said that while he clearly was unaware the relief had been stolen, he could have done more to assure himself of its [[provenance]]. In return the judge gave him a [[discharge (sentence)|conditional discharge]] with [[probation]] and [[community service]]. Both sides described the case as "unique" and "extraordinary".&lt;ref name="Globe and Mail Metke story" /&gt;

==''Yoga Hosers''==
At the time of Metke's arrest, American filmmaker [[Kevin Smith]] discussed the story on his [[podcast]], ''[[SModcast]]'', amused by Metke's description of the bougainvillea and crystals that morning. His co-host, [[Scott Mosier]], imagined how the RCMP might have spoken to Metke, saying "Open up, yoga [[hoser]]!" The last two words became a minor [[catchphrase]] among their fans.&lt;ref name="Globe and Mail Metke story" /&gt;

In April, Smith announced he was working on a screenplay called ''[[Yoga Hosers]]''. He completed the film in time for the January 2016 [[Sundance Film Festival]]. It was not based on Metke's story, but one character in the film, a [[yoga as exercise|yoga]] instructor named Yogi Bayer, was inspired by Metke. [[Justin Long]], who played Bayer, attempted to contact Metke while preparing for the role; Metke did not respond until after Long had shot his scenes.&lt;ref name="Globe and Mail Metke story" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6749">An '''affirmative action bake sale''' is a type of campus protest event used by student groups to performatively criticize [[affirmative action]] policies by charging students different prices depending on which social or racial group they belong to. It has also been used to raise awareness of racial or sexual wage gaps.

==Methodology==
The [[bake sale]]s offer to sell cookies at different prices depending on the customer's [[Race (classification of humans)|race]] and [[gender|sex]], imitating racial and sexual orientation practices of affirmative action. For example, one such bake sale at the [[University of New Mexico]] charged $1.50 for Asian customers, $1 for whites, and 50 cents for African-Americans and Hispanics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/affirmative-action-bake-sale-charges-students-based-race-article-1.3515715|title=‘Affirmative Action Bake Sale’ charges students based on race|date=2017-09-23|author=Schladebeck, Jessica|work=NY Daily News|access-date=2017-11-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to one bake sale student leader, the goal of the technique is to "bring the issue of affirmative action down to everyday terms."&lt;ref name=DailyBruin&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070208102115/http://www.dailybruin.ucla.edu/news/2003/feb/14/democrats-riled-by-race--gende/ Democrats riled by race-, gender-biased bake sale], Daily Bruin&lt;/ref&gt;

These bake sales have been organized at many schools across the U.S., sometimes annually. Affirmative action bake sales have also taken place at the [[University of Pretoria]] in [[South Africa]], the latest (in 2008) having been forcibly broken up by campus security.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090501140947/http://www.news24.com/News24/South_Africa/News/0%2C%2C2-7-1442_2304390%2C00.html 'AA/BEE' cake sale broken up (News24)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Similarity to Wage Gap Bake Sales==
The [[American Association of University Women]] recommends that [[Equal Pay Day]] be celebrated by hosting an event where women receive a 20% discount in order "to raise awareness and provoke conversation about fair pay".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Holden |first1=Elizabeth |title=How to "Celebrate" Equal Pay Day |url=http://www.aauw.org/resource/how-to-equal-pay-day/ |website=American Association of University Women |accessdate=20 April 2017 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170420210822/http://www.aauw.org/resource/how-to-equal-pay-day/ |archivedate=20 April 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The bake sales have met opposition, drawing crowds of students, sometimes facing opposition or restriction from campus administrations,&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Jones |first=Ashby |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/law/2009/06/23/bucknell-and-the-affirmative-action-bakesale/ |title=Bucknell and the ‘Affirmative-Action Bakesale’ - Law Blog&amp;nbsp;— WSJ |publisher=Blogs.wsj.com |date=2009-06-23 |accessdate=2011-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bucknell.edu/x49604.xml |title=BUCC donut sale rejected by administration &amp;#124;&amp;#124; The Bucknellian &amp;#124;&amp;#124; Bucknell University |publisher=Bucknell.edu |date=2009-04-24 |accessdate=2011-09-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120910212157/http://www.bucknell.edu/x49604.xml |archivedate=2012-09-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thefire.org/article/12461.html |title=John Stossel Discusses Bucknell's 'Affirmative Action Bake Sale' (and His Own) with Fox News' Megyn Kelly; Watch FIRE on 'Stossel' Tonight |publisher=FIRE |date=2010-11-11 |accessdate=2011-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; often being accused of [[racism]], and sometimes even being attacked.&lt;ref name="CNN 2003"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080116131828/http://www.cnn.com/2003/US/West/12/24/affirmative.bake.sale.ap/ Bake sales used to protest affirmative action], CNN, December 24, 2003 BROKEN LINK&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, some administrators have been accused of [[censorship]] and inappropriately advocating a political position.&lt;ref name="CNN 2003"/&gt;

Responding to an affirmative action bake sale being attacked at the University of Washington, the school's Board of Regents President Jerry Grinstein presented the opinion of many opponents of these events when he described "the statements [...] in putting on a bake sale about affirmative action were tasteless, divisive and hurtful to many members of the university community."&lt;ref name="CNN 2003"/&gt; The student leader of a bake sale at UCLA addressed this issue of divisiveness, saying "we wanted to show how affirmative action is racial division, not racial reconciliation."&lt;ref name=DailyBruin /&gt; Similarly, administrators at [[Bucknell University]] claimed that the bake sales violated the [[private university]]'s discrimination policy.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

Other criticisms of the concept claim that these bake sales do not take into account ingrained social factors that favor white people. An opinion column in the ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'' after a similar sale took place at [[Texas A&amp;M University]] held that "Actions like these reinforce the common misconception that affirmative action policies give academically unqualified minority students a get-into-college-free card, and they ignore historical discrimination that denied nonwhites opportunities to be successful at any price, no matter their talents or intelligence." The editorial also praised school officials for not shutting down the sale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

'''Amelia Andersdotter''' (born 30 August 1987, [[Uppsala]]) is a [[Swedish people|Swedish]] politician and former [[Member of the European Parliament]] (2011–2014), elected on the [[Pirate Party (Sweden)|Piratpartiet]] list in the [[European Parliament election, 2009 (Sweden)|2009 election]].

== Personal life ==
Amelia Andersdotter was born on 30 August 1987 at [[Akademiska sjukhuset]] in [[Uppsala]], Sweden, the first of three children. Her mother, Lotta Lille, is a journalist, and her father, Anders Lundquist, is a teacher and chess tutor. Her sisters are Ulrika and Karolina. She also has a half-brother on her father's side, Eirik Lundquist. After graduating at Rosendalsgymnasiet in Uppsala, she attended [[Lund University|university]] in Lund, where she studied [[mathematics]], [[physics]], [[Spanish Language|Spanish]] and [[business law]]. However, Andersdotter was elected before completing her studies.&lt;ref name="Lundagård"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lundagard.se/2009/06/01/amelia-20/ |title=Amelia 2.0 |first=Viktor |last=Ström |date=1 June 2009 |work=Lundagård |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She has lived in many parts of Europe, including [[Lund]], [[Uppsala]], [[Bucharest]], [[Ghent]] and [[Brussels]].

== Political career ==
Andersdotter joined the Piratpartiet shortly after its formation in 2006. From June 2007 to March 2010 she was the international coordinator of [[Ung Pirat]], the party's youth wing. In this capacity she coordinated contacts with other groups in Sweden, other pirate political movements around the world, and the organization's international policy viewpoints.

In 2009, she was named the second candidate on Piratpartiet's list for the [[European Parliament]] elections in June of that year. While Piratpartiet did not gain enough votes for a second MEP under the [[treaty of Nice]], they did get enough votes to award her a seat under the terms of the new [[treaty of Lisbon]] that was to come into effect December that year. [[European Parliament election, 2009#Observer MEPs|Difficulties]] with the ratification process of the treaty of Lisbon meant that the seat would not be granted until December 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://euobserver.com/843/114270 |title=18 new MEPs to arrive next month |work=EUobserver |date=14 November 2011 |accessdate=24 November 2011}}
&lt;/ref&gt; From 2011 to 2014, she was the youngest member of the European Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

In the interim period between her election and her inauguration, she spent much time travelling to different parts of the world talking about her experiences as a young politician and as an advocate of new ideas in information policy. Amongst others the [[Ars Electronica]] festival in [[Linz]], Austria&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://tagr.tv/2010/amelia-andersdotter-repair-democracy-maxwell-salzberg-creating-diaspora/ | title=Amelia Andersdotter: "Repair" democracy |date=2010-09-17 |accessdate=2012-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a visit to [[South Korea]]&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web|url=http://www.ohmynews.com/NWS_Web/View/at_pg.aspx?CNTN_CD=A0001463559&amp;PAGE_CD=N0000&amp;BLCK_NO=3&amp;CMPT_CD=M0009 |title=Illegal downloads?

She also travelled extensively inside Europe during this time, involving herself in the work of Pirate Parties around Europe.

Since her inauguration, she has focused her efforts around information policy. She is a part of the [[Committee on Industry, Research and Energy]]. She is also a substitute member of the [[Committee on International Trade]] and the [[Committee on Budgetary Control]]. She also serves as a full member of the parliamentary delegation to the [[Korean peninsula]], and a substitute member of the delegation for the [[Andean Community of Nations|Andean community]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/108570/Amelia_ANDERSDOTTER.html |title=Amelia ANDERSDOTTER |work=European Parliament |date=1 December 2011 |accessdate=16 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A longtime critic of the [[Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement]], her advice to reject it was carried by the ITRE committee, the first of parliamentary committees to propose a rejection of the agreement. Other committees soon followed in the rejection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-18264856 |title=Acta: Piracy treaty dealt critical blows in EU votes | work = BBC News | date = 31 May 2012 | accessdate = 30 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement was soundly rejected by the European Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/pressroom/content/20120703IPR48247/html/European-Parliament-rejects-ACTA |title=European Parliament rejects ACTA |work= European Parliament |date=2012-07-04 |accessdate= 2012-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other areas she is working on include a proposal for a recast of the Union's Re-use of Public Sector Information Directive where she has publicly criticized the Swedish government for resisting the proposed changes in access and cost regimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dik.se/artikel/13900/sverige-blockerar-utvecklingen-inom-oppen-data%E2%80%A8%E2%80%A8 |title=Sverige blockerar utvecklingen inom öppen data? |first=Amelia |last=Andersdotter |publisher=''DIK'' |date=2012-06-05 |accessdate=2012-07-16 |language=Swedish|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130116043450/http://www.dik.se/artikel/13900/sverige-blockerar-utvecklingen-inom-oppen-data%E2%80%A8%E2%80%A8|archive-date=2013-01-16|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is also a supporter of public investments in fibre-to-the-home infrastructures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ameliaandersdotter.eu/2012/07/13/ambition-required-pushing-for-faster-internet.html |title=Ambition required: pushing for faster internet |first=Julien |last=Bencze |date=2012-06-13 |accessdate=2012-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Articles page1.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The [[Articles of Confederation]]: predecessor to the [[U.S. Constitution]] and  drafted from Anti-Federalist principles]]
'''Anti-Federalism''' was a late-18th century movement that opposed the creation of a stronger U.S. federal government and which later opposed the ratification of the 1787 [[United States Constitution|Constitution]]. The previous constitution, called the [[Articles of Confederation]], gave state governments more authority. Led by [[Patrick Henry]] of Virginia, Anti-Federalists worried, among other things, that the position of president, then a novelty, might evolve into a [[monarchy]]. Though the Constitution was ratified and supplanted the Articles of Confederation, Anti-Federalist influence helped lead to the passage of the [[United States Bill of Rights]].

==Major points==

* They believed the Constitution created a presidency so powerful that it would become a monarchy.

==History==
During the [[American Revolution]] and its immediate aftermath, the term ''federal'' was applied to any person who supported the colonial union and the government formed under the [[Articles of Confederation]]. After the war, the group that felt the national government under the Articles was too weak appropriated the name [[Federalism in the United States|Federalist]] for themselves. Historian Jackson Turner Main wrote, "to them, the man of 'federal principles' approved of 'federal measures,' which meant those that increased the weight and authority or extended the influence of the Confederation Congress."&lt;ref name="Main"&gt;{{cite book |last=Main |first=Jackson Turner |date=1961 |title=The Antifederalists: Critics of the Constitution, 1781-1788 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n0tf43-IUWcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Anti+Federalists&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi-pNCnmI7TAhUIsFQKHSe8A5IQ6AEIOTAG#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |location= |publisher=The University of North Carolina Press |isbn=0-8078-5544-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Federalists moved to amend the Articles, eventually leading to the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]], they applied the term anti-federalist to their opposition. The term implied, correctly or not, both opposition to Congress and unpatriotic motives. The Anti-Federalists rejected the term, arguing that they were the true Federalists. In both their correspondence and their local groups, they tried to capture the term. For example, an unknown anti-federalist signed his public correspondence as "A Federal Farmer" and the New York committee opposing the Constitution was called the "Federal Republican Committee."  However the Federalists carried the day and the name Anti-Federalist forever stuck.&lt;ref name="Main"/&gt; 
  
The Anti-Federalists were composed of diverse elements, including those opposed to the Constitution because they thought that a stronger government threatened the sovereignty and prestige of the states, localities, or individuals; those that saw in the proposed government a new centralized, disguised "monarchic" power that would only replace the cast-off despotism of Great Britain;&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Anti-Federalists|volume=2|page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; and those who simply feared that the new government threatened their personal liberties. Some of the opposition believed that the central government under the Articles of Confederation was sufficient. Still others believed that while the national government under the Articles was too weak, the national government under the Constitution would be too strong. Another complaint of the Anti-Federalists was that the Constitution provided for a centralized rather than federal government (and in ''[[The Federalist Papers]]'', [[James Madison]] admits that the new Constitution has the characteristics of both a centralized and federal form of the government) and that a truly federal form of government was a leaguing of states as under the Articles of Confederation.

During the period of debate over the ratification of the Constitution, numerous independent local speeches and articles were published all across the country. Initially, many of the articles in opposition were written under pseudonyms, such as "Brutus" (likely [[Melancton Smith]]&lt;ref&gt;Zuckert and Webb. ''The Anti-Federalist Writings of the Melancton Smith Circle'' pp. 418–419&lt;/ref&gt;), "Centinel" (likely [[Samuel Bryan]]), and "[[Federal Farmer]]."  Eventually, famous revolutionary figures such as [[Patrick Henry]] came out publicly against the Constitution. They argued that the strong national government proposed by the Federalists was a threat to the rights of individuals and that the [[President of the United States|president]] would become a king. They objected to the federal court system created by the proposed constitution. This produced a phenomenal body of political writing; the best and most influential of these articles and speeches were gathered by historians into a collection known as the ''[[Anti-Federalist Papers]]'' in allusion to the ''[[Federalist Papers]]''.

In many states the opposition to the Constitution was strong (although Delaware, Georgia, and New Jersey ratified quickly with little controversy), and in two states—[[North Carolina]] and [[Rhode Island]]—it prevented ratification until the definite establishment of the new government practically forced their adherence. Individualism was the strongest element of opposition; the necessity, or at least the desirability, of a bill of rights was almost universally felt.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; In [[Rhode Island]], resistance against the Constitution was so strong that civil war almost broke out on July 4, 1788, when anti-federalist members of the [[Country Party (Rhode Island)|Country Party]] led by Judge [[William West (Rhode Island politician)|William West]] marched into [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]] with over 1,000 armed protesters.&lt;ref&gt;Columbian Centinel, July 5, 12, 16, 23, 1788; Pennsylvania Packet, July 30, 1788. (reference to West's anti-Constitution [[Independence Day (United States)|4th of July]] rally)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Anti-Federalists played upon these feelings in the ratification convention in [[Massachusetts]]. By this point, five of the states had ratified the Constitution with relative ease, but the Massachusetts convention was far more disputed and contentious. After a long debate, a compromise (known as the "[[Massachusetts compromise]]") was reached. Massachusetts would ratify the Constitution with recommended provisions in the ratifying instrument that the Constitution be amended with a bill of rights. (The Federalists contended that a conditional ratification would be void, so the recommendation was the strongest support that the ratifying convention could give to a bill of rights short of rejecting the Constitution.)

Four of the next five states to ratify, including [[New Hampshire]], [[Virginia]], and [[New York (state)|New York]], included similar language in their ratification instruments. As a result, once the Constitution became operative in 1789, Congress sent a set of twelve amendments to the states. Ten of these amendments were immediately ratified and became known as the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]], with one of the other two becoming the [[Twenty-seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|27th Amendment]]—almost 200 years later. Thus, while the Anti-Federalists were unsuccessful in their quest to prevent the adoption of the Constitution, their efforts were not totally in vain. The Anti-Federalists thus became recognized as an influential group among the founding fathers of the United States.

With the passage of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, the Anti-Federalist movement was exhausted. Some activists joined the [[Anti-Administration Party]] that James Madison and Thomas Jefferson were forming about 1790–91 to oppose the policies of Treasury Secretary [[Alexander Hamilton]]; this group soon became the [[Democratic-Republican Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kenneth F.Warren|title=Encyclopedia of U.S. Campaigns, Elections, and Electoral Behavior|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zP4wDcT3PeQC&amp;pg=PA176|year=2008|publisher=SAGE Publications|page=176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Candidacy===
A [[perennial candidate]], Jones has run for various elected offices since 1976, but has never won an office. In that year, Jones unsuccessfully ran for mayor of [[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]].&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite news|first1=Lynn|last1=Sweet|first2=Frank|last2=Main|url=https://chicago.suntimes.com/politics/holocaust-denier-arthur-jones-republican-3rd-congressional-district-lipinski-newman/|title=Holocaust denier poised to claim GOP nomination in Illinois race for Congress|work=Chicago Sun-Times|access-date=February 6, 2018|date=February 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, he unsuccessfully ran for [[alderman]] of the [[Chicago City Council|13th Ward of Chicago]].&lt;ref name="auto1" /&gt; Jones has run for the U.S. House of Representatives as a Republican eight times; in 1984, 1992, 1996, 1998, 2006, 2008, 2012, and 2018.&lt;ref name="auto1" /&gt;

In 2017, Jones declared his intent to run for the Republican nomination for Congress from [[Illinois's 3rd congressional district]] in 2018; he was the only declared candidate of that party. His candidacy was repudiated by the [[Illinois Republican Party]]&lt;ref name="SunTimes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JTA"/&gt; and the [[Republican National Committee]]. RNC spokesperson Michael Ahrens stated, "We condemn this candidate and his hateful rhetoric in the strongest possible terms".&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite news|first=Eric|last=Cortellessa|title=Republican National Committee condemns Holocaust-denying GOP House candidate|url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/republican-national-committee-condemns-holocaust-denying-gop-house-candidate/|accessdate=February 6, 2018|date=February 6, 2018|work=[[The Times of Israel]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jones won the primary unopposed on March 20, 2018 and moved on to face Democratic incumbent [[Dan Lipinski]] in the general election.

I like the fact that doesn't have to go hat in hand to Jewish billionaires to get money".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Lorraine|last=Swanson|url=https://patch.com/illinois/oaklawn/holocaust-denier-kicked-illinois-gop-primary-ballot-will-back-trump|title=Holocaust Denier Kicked Off Illinois GOP Primary Ballot Likes Trump - Except for One Little Thing|date=January 26, 2016|work=[[Patch Media|Oak Lawn, IL Patch]]|access-date=February 6, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2018, Jones nonetheless said President Trump "surrounded himself with hordes of Jews", and regrets his 2016 vote.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; At a neo-Nazi meeting in [[Kentucky]], Jones said that Trump "surrounded himself with hordes of Jews including a Jew in his own family, that punk named Jared Kushner", and moved on to say "I'm sorry I voted for the son of a bitch, pardon my English" and that Trump was "nothing but a puppet … this Jew-loving fool", all of which was also captured on video.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

According to the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', it takes thousands more signatures to get ballot-approved as an independent candidate than as a Republican; Jones therefore ran in 2016 as a Republican, but the party disavowed him and found technical reasons for removing him from past ballots.&lt;ref name="SunTimes"/&gt; Again according to the ''Sun-Times'', Jones took countermeasures in 2017 and 2018 for which the party was unprepared, and so his appear on their ballot despite official Republican disapproval.&lt;ref name="SunTimes"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7466">Established in 1698, the '''Attorney-General's Chambers of Bermuda''' is the main legal advisor to the federal government and makes laws accessible to the public. From 1698-1999, the Attorney-General was also the main prosecutor in all criminal matters that pertained to the Bermuda courts. Attorneys-General are appointed by the Governor per the Constitution. All were public officers until 1999 when Lois Browne-Evans was appointed as the island's first political Attorney-General through election. Due to Bermuda's decision to have a political Attorney-General, the Director of Public Prosecutions now handles all criminal matters. Even though there are now two distinct offices, the Attorney-General is also considered Bermuda's Minister of Legal Affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.bm/history-attorney-generals-chambers|title=History of the Attorney-General's Chambers|last=david.wellman|date=2016-03-01|website=www.gov.bm|language=en|access-date=2018-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roles and function==
The Attorney General is a member of the Government and has two separate constitutional roles, a governmental role, in which he acts as a Member of Government in the performance of his duties, and a role as the guardian of the public interest, when he acts independently in a quasi-judicial capacity.

Legal proceedings for and against the State must be taken in the name of the Attorney General (in the case of civil proceedings) and in the name of the State (in the case of criminal proceedings).

The Attorney General has responsibility for the following departments:
**Wholly Owned Enterprises
**Appointment to Quasi Judicial Bodies
**Law Reform
*Office of the Solicitor General
**Civil Litigation
**Legal Advice to the Government
*Office of Chief State Solicitor
**Administrator General

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10554">A '''barefoot lawyer''' (Chinese: 赤脚律师 pinyin: chìjiǎo lǜshī) is a self-taught legal activist in [[China]]. Many barefoot lawyers are peasants who teach themselves enough law to file civil complaints, engage in litigation, and educate fellow citizens about their rights.&lt;ref name="newsweek"&gt;Melinda Liu. [http://www.newsweek.com/2002/03/03/barefoot-lawyers.html "Barefoot lawyers"], Newsweek,  4 March 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; The term is a variation of the "[[barefoot doctor]]"—farmers with minimal formal training who nonetheless provided essential medical services in rural China during the [[Mao Zedong|Mao]] era. Barefoot lawyers provide free legal services, and in many instances take on controversial or politically sensitive cases—such as tackling corruption by local authorities—that more established legal professionals may be reluctant to pursue. Notable examples of barefoot lawyers include the blind self-taught activist [[Chen Guangcheng]], and [[Guo Feixiong]].&lt;ref name="HRW Thin Ice"&gt;[[Human Rights Watch]]. [https://www.hrw.org/en/node/62248/section/6  Walking on Thin Ice] 28 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Ford, [http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Asia-Pacific/2010/0909/China-s-blind-activist-lawyer-Chen-Guangcheng-released-from-prison China's blind activist lawyer, Chen Guangcheng, released from prison], Christian Science Monitor, 9 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tim Johnson, [http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2005/11/15/13041/in-china-lawyers-fighting-for.html In China, lawyers fighting for justice routinely harassed], Knight Ridder Newspapers, 15 November 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Since the [[Legal history of China#1978-1981|legal reforms]] of the late 1970s and 1980s, the [[Communist Party of China]] has moved to embrace the language of the [[rule of law]] and establish a modern [[Court system of the People's Republic of China|court system]]. In the process, it has enacted thousands of new laws and regulations, and embarked on campaigns to publicize the idea that citizens have protection under the law.&lt;ref name="HRW Thin Ice" /&gt; As China’s leadership became cognizant of the importance of the legal system and legal profession to advance economic development, training for lawyers dramatically increased. From 1986 to 1992, the number of lawyers in the country more than doubled from 21,500 to 45,000,  and by 2008 had reached 143,000.&lt;ref&gt;People's Daily Online. [http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90001/90776/90882/6393774.html "China has more than 143,000 lawyers"], 16 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the meteoric growth in the legal profession in China since the 1980s, many rural counties in China have a severe shortage of legal professionals; a 2004 report by China's [[Ministry of Justice of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Justice]] noted that 200 counties did not have a single lawyer.&lt;ref name=ChineseJustice/&gt; This has given rise to several distinct classes of legal workers and activists with varying qualifications who step in to meet the demand for legal professionals and advisors. While licensed lawyers and the less qualified "legal workers" tend to have established ties to authorities and local courts, barefoot lawyers are independent actors.&lt;ref name=Dezalay&gt;Yves Dezalay, [https://www.amazon.com/Lawyers-Rule-Law-Globalization-Development/dp/0415581176 Lawyers and the Rule of Law in an Era of Globalization ], (Routledge, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, unlike most lawyers who gravitate to urban centers, barefoot lawyers tend to be based in rural areas where citizens have limited access to justice. Although they lack the training and professionalism of lawyers, they serve an irreplaceable function of providing "convenient, approachable, and free services" without political constraints, according to You-Tien Hsing and Ching Kwan Lee.&lt;ref name=Hsing&gt;You-Tien Hsing and Ching Kwan Lee, [https://www.amazon.com/Reclaiming-Chinese-Society-Activism-Transformations/dp/0415491398 Reclaiming Chinese Society: The New Social Activism] (Routledge, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Training==
Barefoot lawyers are distinguished from qualified lawyers in that they are often completely self-taught, lack formal training in the legal profession, and are not accredited to practice law. They are also distinct from "legal workers," who are required only to possess high school education plus a six-month legal training program.&lt;ref name=ChineseJustice/&gt; Although they lack legal credentials and formal legal training, barefoot lawyers tend to have a higher level of education and experience than most rural citizens.&lt;ref name="newsweek"/&gt;

The proliferation of barefoot lawyers in China is due, in part, to a provision in Chinese law which allows parties to represent themselves or select their own, unpaid representatives to appear in court on their behalf; the chosen representatives do not need to be licensed lawyers.&lt;ref name=ChineseJustice&gt;Margaret Y. K. Woo, Mary E. Gallagher, [https://www.amazon.com/Chinese-Justice-Dispute-Resolution-Contemporary/dp/1107006244 ''Chinese Justice: Civil Dispute Resolution in Contemporary China''], (Cambridge University Press, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ching Kwan Lee, [https://www.amazon.com/Against-Law-Protests-Rustbelt-Sunbelt/dp/0520250974 ''Against the Law: Labor Protests in China's Rustbelt And Sunbelt''], (University of California Press, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
{{Weiquan Lawyers}}
Barefoot lawyers are known for taking on controversial or politically sensitive cases, such as tackling illegal [[Forced eviction (China)|land grabs]], corruption and abuse of power, or [[Environmental issues in China|environmental disputes]]. In many instances, more legitimate legal workers and lawyers are unwilling to accept these cases, as doing so can result in reprisals.&lt;ref name=ChineseJustice/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Brown, [https://www.amazon.com/Butterfly-Mind-Revolution-Understanding-ebook/dp/B005LPUEUA Butterfly Mind: Revolution, Recovery, and One Reporter's Road to Understanding China], (House of Anansi Press, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; Several barefoot lawyers identify closely with the [[Weiquan]] (rights defending) movement.

Among the notable cases taken on by Weiquan lawyers include [[Chen Guangcheng]]'s effort in 2000 to mobilize 79 villages in his native [[Shandong]] Province to petition against a paper mill that had been polluting a river, killing wildlife and ruining crops. The effort was successful, and resulted in the suspension of the paper mill.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Kahn, [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/20/world/asia/20blind.html?pagewanted=all Advocate for China's Weak Runs Afoul of the Powerful] 20 July 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Chen later earned international recognition for initiating a class-action lawsuit against the staff of a family planning clinic in Shandong province that allegedly forced thousands of people to undergo sterilization or to abort pregnancies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = Chinese to Prosecute Peasant Who Resisted One-Child Policy |work=Washington Post| url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/07/AR2006070701510.html| date = 8 July 2006 | first=Philip P. | last=Pan | accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another case, publicized in ''[[Newsweek]]'', involved barefoot lawyers petitioning authorities to provide compensation to villagers who had been beaten by authorities over a tax dispute.&lt;ref name="newsweek"/&gt;

In addition to litigating cases in court, barefoot lawyers perform a number of other services, such as organizing citizens to petition authorities. A survey in rural [[Henan]] province found that, between 2001 and 2004, more cases were handled by barefoot lawyers than by licensed lawyers.&lt;ref name=ChineseJustice/&gt; Across China, barefoot lawyers and "legal workers" provide more legal services and draft more legal documents than licensed lawyers, and in some areas litigate more civil cases than lawyers.&lt;ref name=Dezalay/&gt;

==Reception==

Scholars of Chinese law and society have described barefoot lawyers as providing legal services and advice that are largely irreplaceable by lawyers and legal workers; in particular, they provide free access to justice in rural areas, and take on administrative cases and politically sensitive cases that many other legal professionals are unwilling to pursue.&lt;ref name=Hsing/&gt;  However, barefoot lawyers have attracted some scorn from licensed lawyers. Urban areas often experience a surplus of licensed lawyers, and many have lobbied to impose more restrictions on the activities of legal workers and barefoot lawyers to reduce market competition.&lt;ref name=Dezalay/&gt; Although alternative legal service providers such as legal workers and barefoot lawyers were at one time encouraged in rural areas to satisfy unmet demand, in recent years they have come under increased control and scrutiny by authorities.&lt;ref name=Dezalay/&gt;

Due to the nature of cases barefoot lawyers sometimes take on—which include challenging official corruption, organizing against abuses of power, or defending victims of forced eviction—they are sometimes met with punitive reprisals by authorities. The barefoot lawyer Guo Feixiong was sentenced to five years in prison in 2007 in what was characterized as a "trial marked with serious procedural irregularities."&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights in China. [http://www.hrichina.org/public/contents/press?revision%5fid=45551&amp;item%5fid=45547 Rights Defender Guo Feixiong Sentenced to 5 years in Prison]. Nov 13 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Family members reported that Guo was tortured in custody, deprived of sleep, and shocked with electric batons.&lt;ref&gt;Radio Free Asia. [http://www.rfa.org/english/news/china_template-20071228.html 'Chinese Rights Lawyer Beaten, Staging Hunger Strike in Prison'], 28 Dec 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Chen Guangcheng was sentenced to over four years in prison after he sought to defend victims of forced sterilization and abortion; following his release, he remained under house arrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-12413660 |title=China activist Chen Guangcheng 'under house arrest' |first=Damian |last=Grammaticas |work=BBC News |date=10 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This article describes the [[blasphemy]] law in the [[United Kingdom]].

==England and Wales==
The [[common law offence]]s of [[blasphemy]] and [[blasphemous libel]] were abolished by the [[Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008]]. See also [[Racial and Religious Hatred Act 2006]].

===Ecclesiastical offences===
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}
The offence of [[blasphemy]] was originally part of [[canon law]]. In 1378, at the command of Pope Gregory XI, persecution of [[John Wycliffe]] and the [[Lollards]] was undertaken. However, the only punishment available to the bishops at the time was excommunication. The clergy, dissatisfied with this, forged an Act of parliament, without the assent of the Lords or Commons, enabling the arrest and imprisonment of heretics. In the following year an attempt was made by Parliament to repeal the Act, which prompted a series of prosecutions, and the repeal failed. Not satisfied with their new powers, further were sought and granted under King Henry IV in 1400. These new powers allowed the bishops to arrest and imprison all preachers of heresy, all schoolmasters infected with heresy, and all owners and writers of heretical books. On refusal to abjure (solemnly renounce) or relapse after abjuration, the heretic could be handed over to civil officers, to be taken to a high place before the people and there be burnt, so that their punishment might strike fear in the hearts and minds of others. In April, 1399, William Sawyer was convicted of heresy and put to penance by his bishop. He was again arrested on 12 February 1400, as a relapsed heretic and was convicted by the Archbishop of Canterbury. Sawyer was burnt on 2 March, eight days before the power to inflict such punishment was granted. There is a long list of those burnt, or hanged and burnt, between 1414 and 1506. In the 17th century, blasphemy was declared a common law offence by the [[Court of King's Bench]], punishable by the common law courts.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

In 1656, the [[Quaker]] [[James Naylor]] was sentenced by the [[Second Protectorate Parliament]] to flogging, to be pilloried, branded on the forehead and the piercing of his tongue by a red-hot poker, and thereafter kept in prison on hard labour indefinitely.

From the 16th century to the mid-19th century, blasphemy against [[Christianity]] was held as an offence against common law.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} When formulating his new [[Church of England]]'s doctrines in the 1530s, [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] made it an offence to say or print any opinion that contradicted the [[Thirty-nine_Articles#Six_Articles_(1539)|Six Articles]] (1539).&lt;ref&gt;Temperman &amp; Koltay, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; Blasphemy was also used as a legal instrument to persecute [[atheist]]s, [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]], and others.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} Ever since 1838, blasphemy was considered to be only a crime against beliefs of the [[Church of England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Temperman |first1=Jeroen |last2=Koltay |first2=András |date=2017 |title=Blasphemy and Freedom of Expression: Comparative, Theoretical and Historical Reflections after the Charlie Hebdo Massacre |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AkY3DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA597 |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=597 |isbn=9781108267991 |accessdate=7 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/3753408.stm |title=Q &amp; A: Blasphemy law |work=BBC News |date=18 October 2004 |accessdate=7 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldselect/ldrelof/95/95w57.htm |title=Submission from the Methodist Church to the Select Committee on Religious Offences in England and Wales, paragraph 3 |work=Hansard |date=5 July 2002 |accessdate=7 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All blasphemies against [[God]], including denying his being or providence, all contumelious reproaches of [[Jesus Christ]], all profane scoffing at the [[Bible|Holy Scriptures]], and exposing any part thereof to contempt or ridicule, were punishable by the temporal courts with death, imprisonment, [[corporal punishment]] and fine. In 1656, two weavers, William Bond and Thomas Hibbord were indicted in [[Wiltshire]] for atheistic statements.&lt;ref name="LWL"&gt;{{cite book|last=Levy|first=Leonard W|title=Blasphemy: Verbal Offense Against the Sacred, from Moses to Salman Rushdie|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=zZu63qz85nsC&amp;lpg=PA167&amp;dq=Alexander%20Agnew%20Dumfries%201656&amp;pg=PA167|year=1995|isbn=0807845159|publisher=University of North Carolina Press |page=167}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May of the same year, Alexander Agnew, known as "Jock of Broad Scotland", was convicted and hanged for blasphemy in [[Dumfries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gray|first=Zachary|title=An Impartial Examination of the Fourth Volume of Mr. Daniel Neal's History of the Puritans|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=p6IAAAAAMAAJ&amp;lpg=PA95&amp;ots=LuGYwa4bAl&amp;dq=Alexander%20Agnew%20May%201656&amp;pg=PA96|year=1739|publisher=Bettenham|pages=92–95}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LWL"/&gt;

''Taylor's Case''&lt;ref&gt;Taylor's Case (1676) 1 Vent 293, (1676) 86 ER 189, (1676) 3 Keb 607&lt;/ref&gt; in 1676 was the first [[law report|reported]] case of the common law offence of blasphemy.&lt;ref&gt;The Law Commission. Offences against religion and public worship. Working paper no. 79. 1981. p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear whether or not there were any unreported earlier cases.&lt;ref&gt;The Law Commission.

The report by Ventris contains the following passage:

{{Blockquote|And [[Sir Matthew Hale|Hale]] said, that such kind of wicked blasphemous words were not only an offence to God and religion, but a crime against the laws, State and Government, and therefore punishable in this Court. For to say, religion is a cheat, is to dissolve all those obligations whereby the civil societies are preserved, and that Christianity is parcel of the laws of England; and therefore to reproach the Christian religion is to speak in subversion of the law.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor's Case (1676) 1 Vent 293, (1676) [http://www.commonlii.org/uk/cases/EngR/1726/773.pdf 86 ER 189]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In ''Rex v [[Thomas Woolston|Woolston]]'',&lt;ref&gt;R v Woolston (1729) Fitzg 64, [http://www.commonlii.org/uk/cases/EngR/1732/87.pdf (1729) 94 ER 655], (1729) 1 [[Barnardiston's King's Bench Reports|Barn KB]] 162, [http://www.commonlii.org/uk/cases/EngR/1744/1562.pdf (1729) 94 ER 112], (1729) 2 Str 834, [http://www.commonlii.org/uk/cases/EngR/1795/1440.pdf (1729) 93 ER 881]&lt;/ref&gt; "the Court declared they would not suffer it to be debated, whether to write against Christianity in general was not an offence punishable in the Temporal Courts at common law: it having been settled so to be in ''Taylor's Case'' in 1 Vent. 293. 3 Keb 607, 621 and in the case of ''The King v Hall'', ante, 416. They desired it might be taken notice of, that they laid their stress upon the word general, and did not intend to include disputes between learned men on particular controverted points."&lt;ref&gt;R v Woolston (1729) 2 Str 834, [http://www.commonlii.org/uk/cases/EngR/1795/1440.pdf (1729) 93 ER 881]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1841 [[Edward Moxon]] was found guilty of the publication of a [[blasphemous libel]] ([[Percy Bysshe Shelley]]'s ''[[Queen Mab (poem)|Queen Mab]]''), the prosecution having been instituted by [[Henry Hetherington]], who had previously been condemned to four months imprisonment for a similar offence, and wished to test the law under which he was punished. In the case of ''Cowan v Milbourn'' (1867) the defendant had broken his contract to let a lecture-room to the plaintiff, on discovering that the intended lectures were to maintain that the character of Christ is defective, and his teaching misleading, and that the Bible is no more inspired than any other book, and the court of exchequer held that the publication of such doctrine was blasphemy, and the contract therefore illegal. On that occasion the court reaffirmed the dictum of Lord Chief Justice Hale, that Christianity is part of the laws of England.
The commissioners on criminal law (sixth report) remarked that although the law forbade all denial of the being and providence of God or the Christian religion, it is only when irreligion assumes the form of an insult to God and man that the interference of the criminal law took place.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1 |wstitle=Blasphemy |volume=4 |pages=43-44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dictum "if the decencies of controversy are observed, even the fundamentals of religion may be attacked without the writer being guilty of blasphemy" was followed in R v Boulter (1908) 72 JP 188.

In the case of ''Bowman v Secular Society'' [1917] AC 406, [[John Hamilton, 1st Viscount Sumner|Lord Sumner]], echoing Hale's remarks in ''Taylor'', summarized the position using the [[Legal Latin|Latin]] phrase, ''deorum injuriae diis curae'', "offences to the gods are dealt with by the gods": blasphemy is an offence against the (Christian) state, and is prohibited because it tends to subvert (Christian) society; offence to God as such is outside the reach of the law.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

The last person in Britain to be sent to prison for blasphemy was [[John William Gott]] on 9 December 1921. &lt;!-- some sources say 1922 or even 1911/12 - Confirmed date 9 December 1921 from The Times of a few weeks later. His case went to appeal early in 1922, and one of his earlier convictions was in 1911; which probably explains the confusion. --&gt; He had three previous convictions for blasphemy when he was prosecuted for publishing two pamphlets entitled ''Rib Ticklers, or Questions for Parsons'' and ''God and Gott''. In these pamphlets Gott satirised the biblical story of Jesus entering Jerusalem ({{bibleverse||Matthew|21:2-7|}}) comparing Jesus to a circus clown. He was sentenced to nine months' hard labour despite suffering from an incurable illness, and died shortly after he was released. The case became the subject of public outrage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last =Travis | first =Alan | authorlink = | coauthors = | title =Blunkett isn't trying to play God | work = | publisher =[[The Guardian]] | date =2001-10-04 | url =https://www.theguardian.com/comment/story/0,,579789,00.html | doi = | accessdate =2007-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1949 speech [[Lord Denning]] placed the blasphemy laws in the past, saying that "it was thought that a denial of Christianity was liable to shake the fabric of society, which was itself founded upon Christian religion. There is no such danger to society now and the offence of blasphemy is a [[dead letter]]".{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

In 1977, however, the case ''[[Whitehouse v Lemon]]'' (involving the periodical ''[[Gay News]]'' publishing [[James Kirkup]]'s poem ''[[The Love that Dares to Speak its Name]]'') demonstrated that the offence of blasphemous libel, long thought to be dormant, was still in force.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last =
| first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title =Gay paper guilty of blasphemy | work =On this day | publisher =[[BBC News]] | date =1977-07-11 | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/july/11/newsid_2499000/2499721.stm | format = | doi = | accessdate =2007-12-05 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the House of Lords appeal [[Lord Scarman]] said that "I do not subscribe to the view that the common-law offence of blasphemous libel serves no useful purpose in modern law. ... The offence belongs to a group of criminal offences designed to safeguard the internal tranquillity of the kingdom."{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

The following cases, in particular, were approved by the House of Lords in ''Whitehouse v Gay News Ltd'':

*''R v Hetherington'' (1841) 4 St Tr (NS) 563, (1841) 5 JP 496, (1841) 4 Jur 529
*''Shore v Wilson'' (1842) 9 Cl &amp; F 524
*''R v Ramsay and Foote'' (1883) 15 Cox 231, (1883) 48 LT 733
*''Bowman v Secular Society Ltd'' [1917] AC 406, 33 TLR 376, 86 LJ Ch 117

Lord Scarman said&lt;ref&gt;Whitehouse v Gay News Ltd [1979] AC 617 at 665, HL&lt;/ref&gt; that in his judgement the modern law of blasphemy was correctly formulated in article 214 of Stephen's Digest of the Criminal Law, Ninth Edition, 1950, which reads:

{{Blockquote|Every publication is said to be blasphemous which contains any contemptuous, reviling, scurrilous or ludicrous matter relating to God, Jesus Christ, or the Bible, or the formularies of the Church of England as by law established. It is not blasphemous to speak or publish opinions hostile to the Christian religion, or to deny the existence of God, if the publication is couched in decent and temperate language. The test to be applied is as to the manner in which the doctrines are advocated and not as to the substance of the doctrines themselves. Everyone who publishes any blasphemous document is guilty of the (offence) of publishing a blasphemous libel. Everyone who speaks blasphemous words is guilty of the (offence) of blasphemy.}}

The [[Human Rights Act 1998]] requires the courts to interpret the law in a way that is compatible with the [[Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms]]. The offence of blasphemous libel is believed by some{{Who|date=May 2010}} to be contrary to the freedom of speech provisions in the Convention. However, just before the introduction of the Human Rights Act 1998, a claim that the blasphemy law is inconsistent with article 10 of the Convention (providing for freedom of expression) was rejected in the case of ''Wingrove v UK'' (1997);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrcr.org/safrica/expression/wingrove_uk.html|title=Judgment |publisher=Council of Europe |date=1996-11-25 |accessdate=2011-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; a case brought by solicitor [[Mark Stephens (solicitor)|Mark Stephens]]. The Court decided that it was within the state's [[margin of appreciation]] for a restriction on free speech.

When the [[BBC]] decided to broadcast ''[[Jerry Springer: The Opera]]'' in January 2005, they received over 63,000 complaints by offended Christian viewers who objected to the show's portrayal of Christian icons (including one scene depicting Jesus professing to be "a bit gay"). The fundamentalist group [[Christian Voice (UK)|Christian Voice]] sought a private blasphemy prosecution against the BBC, but the charges were rejected by [[City of Westminster]] magistrates' court. Christian Voice applied to have this ruling overturned by the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]], but the application was rejected, the court finding that the [[common law]] blasphemy offences specifically did not apply to stage productions (section 2(4) of the [[Theatres Act 1968]]) and broadcasts (section 6 of the [[Broadcasting Act 1990]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = | first = | coauthors = | title =Springer opera court fight fails | work =[[BBC News]] | pages = | language = | publisher =

====Religion to which the offences relate====
In ''R v Gathercole'' (1838), the defendant was convicted of criminal libel for publishing an attack on a Roman Catholic nunnery. Alderson B., in his direction to the jury, said that "a person may, without being liable to prosecution for it, attack Judaism, or Mahomedanism, or even any sect of the Christian religion (save the established religion of the country); and the only reason why the latter is in a different situation from the others is, because it is the form established by law, and is therefore a part of the constitution of the country. In the like manner, and for the same reason, any general attack on Christianity is the subject of a criminal prosecution, because Christianity is the established religion of the country."&lt;ref&gt;R v Gathercole (1838) 2 Lew CC 237 at 254, (1838) 168 ER 1140 at 1145&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Bowman v Secular Society Ltd'' (1917), Lord Sumner said that this was a "strange dictum" because insulting a Jew's religion was no less likely to provoke a fight than insulting an episcopalian's religion.&lt;ref&gt;Bowman v Secular Society Ltd [1917] AC 406 at 460&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Church in Wales]] was disestablished in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Welsh Church Act 1914]], section 1; the [[Welsh Church (Temporalities) Act 1919]], section 2&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985, the Law Commission said that the effect of this was that that Church was no longer "the form established by law" nor "part of the constitution" of the [[Principality of Wales]], within the meaning of those expressions in the dictum from ''R v Gathercole'' set out above. They said that, at that date, there was no authority as to the effect of this, if any, on the law of blasphemy in Wales.&lt;ref&gt;The Law Commission, Offences against religion and public worship, Working paper no. 79, 1981, p.32, note 133&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Whitehouse v Lemon]]'' (as ''Whitehouse v Gay News Ltd'' [1979] when it reached the Law Lords), Lord Scarman said that the offence did not protect the religious beliefs and feelings of non-Christians. He said it was "shackled by the chains of history" in this respect.&lt;ref&gt;Whitehouse v Gay News Ltd [1979] AC 617 at 658, HL&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''R v Chief Metropolitan Stipendiary Magistrate, ex parte Choudhury'' (1991),&lt;ref&gt;R v Chief Metropolitan Stipendiary Magistrate, ex parte Choudhury [1991] 1 QB 429, [1990] 3 WLR 986, [1991] 1 All ER 306, 91 Cr App R 393, [1990] Crim LR 711, [[Divisional Court|DC]]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Divisional Court]] held that the offences prohibited attacks only on the Christian religion, and did not prohibit attacks on the Islamic religion.

It was also held that the failure of these offences to prohibit attacks on non-Christian religions did not violate article 9 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights|Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms]] (which relates to freedom of religion).&lt;ref&gt;Choudhury v United Kingdom (1991) 12 HRLJ 172; R v Chief Metropolitan Stipendiary Magistrate, ex parte Choudhury [1991] 1 QB 429, [1990] 3 WLR 986, [1991] 1 All ER 306, 91 Cr App R 393, [1990] Crim LR 711, [[Divisional Court|DC]]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mode of trial====
At the time of their abolition, blasphemy and blasphemous libel were [[indictable-only offences]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

====Sentence and orders on conviction====
The death penalty for blasphemy was abolished in 1676.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction Act 1677]] (29 Car.2 c.9)&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''R v Woolston'', the defendant was sentenced to a fine of £25 for each of his four discourses (i.e. £100 altogether) and to imprisonment for the term of one year. He was also required to enter into a [[recognizance]] for his good behaviour during his life, himself in the sum of £3000 and by others in the sum of £2000.&lt;ref&gt;''R v Woolston'' (1729) 2 Str 834, [http://www.commonlii.org/uk/cases/EngR/1795/1440.pdf (1729) 93 ER 881 at 882]&lt;/ref&gt; (As to recognizances, see also [[binding over]]).

====Number of prosecutions====
Before 1883, prosecutions were "much more common".&lt;ref&gt;[[Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice]], 1999, para 27-1 at p.2251&lt;/ref&gt; In the years 1883 to 1922 there were five prosecutions.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Whitehouse v Gay News Ltd [1979] AC 617 at 635, HL, per Lord Diplock&lt;/ref&gt; There was an unsuccessful private prosecution in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;The Law Commission, Offences gainst religion and public worship, Working Paper No 79, page 18, note 67&lt;/ref&gt; The next successful prosecution was in 1977.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

====Individual prosecutions, arrests and failures to prosecute====
In England the last prominent 19th century prosecution for blasphemy was the case of ''R v Ramsey and Foote'',&lt;ref&gt;R v Ramsey and Foote (1883) 48 LT 739&lt;/ref&gt; when the editor, publisher and printer of ''[[The Freethinker (journal)|The Freethinker]]'' were sentenced to imprisonment.

Police court proceedings were taken in 1908 against [[Harry Boulter]], a [[Speakers' Corner|Hyde Park]] orator with links to the [[Rationalist]] movement. In June 1909 he was jailed for repeating the offence.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

In February 1925, the Glasgow-based radical [[Guy Aldred]] was arrested in Hyde Park and charged with blasphemy and sedition.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

In 1988, British author [[Salman Rushdie]]'s novel ''[[The Satanic Verses (novel)|The Satanic Verses]]'' was published. Many Muslims considered the book to blaspheme against Islam, and Iranian clerical leader [[Ayatollah Khomeini]] issued a [[fatwa]] in 1989 calling for Rushdie's death, "along with all the editors and publishers aware of its contents".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Ayatollah sentences author to death|publisher=BBC|date=14 February 1989|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/february/14/newsid_2541000/2541149.stm|accessdate=22 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the government was petitioned for Rushdie to be prosecuted for blasphemy. No charges were laid because, as a [[House of Lords]] select committee stated, the law only protects the Christian beliefs as held by the [[Church of England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=First Report Blasphemy |work=Select Committee on Religious Offences in England and Wales |publisher=United Kingdom Parliament Publications and Records |date=2003-06-10 |url=http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/ld200203/ldselect/ldrelof/95/9515.htm |doi= |accessdate=2007-12-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930030905/http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/ld200203/ldselect/ldrelof/95/9515.htm |archivedate=2007-09-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Rushdie case stimulated debate on this topic, with some arguing the same protection should be extended to all religions, while others claimed the UK's ancient blasphemy laws were an anachronism and should be abolished. Despite much discussion surrounding the controversy, the law was not amended.

Michael Newman, a secondary school science teacher and an atheist, was arrested under England’s blasphemy law for selling Wingrove's blasphemous video, ''Visions of Ecstasy'' in February 1992 in Birmingham. He was forced to resign from his school position due to protests from Christian parents. As a result, he became a subject of discussion in the media, including an appearance on Channel Four’s ''Comment''&lt;ref&gt;Channel 4, Comment, 7:50pm[18/08/1992]&lt;/ref&gt; programme in England.&lt;ref&gt;Warren Allen Smith. ''Who's Who in Hell, A Handbook and International Directory for Humanists, Freethinkers, Naturalists, Rationalists, and Non-Theists'', New York: Barricade Books[2000]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, a deliberate and well-publicised public repeat reading of ''[[The Love that Dares to Speak its Name]]'' took place on the steps of [[St Martin-in-the-Fields]] church in [[Trafalgar Square]], but failed to lead to any prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1401051/Erotic-poem-challenges-blasphemy-law.html|title=Erotic poem challenges blasphemy law|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Proposals to amend the law and protests====
The [[Law Commission (England and Wales)|Law Commission]] published a report in 1985 on ''Criminal Law: Offences against Religious and Public Worship''. The report noted that "there is no one agreed definition of blasphemy and blasphemous libel and that it would scarcely be practicable, even if it thought desirable, to amend the common law definition by statute". The authors added that "it is now clear that none of the arguments for retaining a law of blasphemy are sufficiently strong to support this view and each of them is outweighed by other considerations which persuade us that a law of blasphemy is not a necessary part of a criminal code. Moreover, we have no doubt that any replacement offence which might be devised would in practice prove to be unacceptably wide in ambit." The Commission concluded "that the common law offences of blasphemy and blasphemous libel should be abolished without replacement".&lt;ref&gt;The Law Commission No. 145 "[https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/235882/0442.pdf Criminal Law: Offences against Religion and Public Worship]". HC 442 1984-85.&lt;/ref&gt; A minority report sought to create a replacement offence such that citizens should not purposely "insult or outrage the religious feelings of others".

In 2002, a deliberate and well-publicised public repeat-reading of the poem ''[[The Love that Dares to Speak its Name]]'' by [[James Kirkup]] took place on the steps of [[St Martin-in-the-Fields]] church in [[Trafalgar Square]] and failed to lead to any prosecution by the [[Director of Public Prosecutions]]. It suggested Jesus was a homosexual. An earlier reading in 1977 had led to prosecution. Outraged Christians tried to drown out the 2002 reading. "We have won an important victory for free speech and the right to protest", declared human rights campaigner [[Peter Tatchell]]. "No one was arrested. The police didn't even take our names and addresses. The blasphemy law is now a dead letter. If the authorities are not prepared to enforce the law, they should abolish it". A trial would have involved all those who read and published the poem, including several of Britain's leading{{Peacock term|date=August 2011}} writers, academics and MPs. After the event, Tatchell said "The blasphemy law gives the Christian religion privileged protection against criticism and dissent. No other institution enjoys such sweeping powers to suppress the expression of opinions and ideas."&lt;ref&gt;[http://freethinker.co.uk/2007/07/05/farewell-george-melly-1927-2007/ Farewell George Melly (1927-2007)], [http://freethinker.co.u the freethinker]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 May 2002 the [[House of Lords]] appointed a select committee "to consider and report on the law relating to [[Religious offense|religious offences]]". The committee's first report was published in April 2003; it summarised the state of the law in this area, and found that the present law on blasphemy was unlikely to result in successful prosecution. The committee found no consensus on whether a new law against blasphemy was required, but concluded that any law should apply to all faiths.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

====Abolition====
In January 2008, a spokesman for prime minister [[Gordon Brown]] announced that the government would consider supporting the abolition of the blasphemy laws during the passage of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill&lt;!--(common laws are abolished, not repealed)--&gt;. The government consulted with the [[Church of England]] and other churches before reaching a decision. The move followed a letter written to ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' at the instigation of MP [[Evan Harris]] and the [[National Secular Society]] and was signed by leading figures including [[Lord Carey]], former [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], who urged that the laws be abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1574884/Lord-Carey-backs-MPs-over-blasphemy-laws.html|title=Lord Carey backs MPs over blasphemy laws|last=Correspondent|first=James Kirkup, Political|date=2008|access-date=2018-06-28|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 March 2008, an amendment was passed to the [[Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008]] which abolished the common law offences of blasphemy and blasphemous libel in England and Wales. The peers also voted for the laws to be abandoned during March. The Act received royal assent on 8&amp;nbsp;May 2008,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2008/ukpga_20080004_en_1 Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008], see section 79 and Part 5 of Schedule 28.&lt;/ref&gt; and the relevant section came into force on 8 July 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2008/03/uk-house-of-lords-votes-to-abolish.php JURIST – Paper Chase: UK House of Lords votes to abolish criminal blasphemy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090509145839/http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2008/03/uk-house-of-lords-votes-to-abolish.php |date=2009-05-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2008/ukpga_20080004_en_17#pt12-l1g153 Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100806163938/http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2008/ukpga_20080004_en_17#pt12-l1g153 |date=6 August 2010 }}, section 153: Commencement&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |accessdate=2008-05-23 |publisher=Ministry of Justice |title=Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008 implementation |url=http://www.justice.gov.uk/publications/criminal-justice-act-implementation.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081105105702/http://www.justice.gov.uk/publications/criminal-justice-act-implementation.htm |archivedate=2008-11-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

===Statutory offences===
An Act of [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]] (the [[Sacrament Act 1547]]) set a punishment of imprisonment for [[revile|reviling]] the sacrament of the [[Lord's Supper]]. It was repealed by the [[First Statute of Repeal]] in 1553 and revived again in 1558.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

The [[Interregnum (England)|interregnum]] [[Rump Parliament|Parliament]] in 1650, "holding it to be [its] duty, by all good ways and means to propagate the Gospel in this Commonwealth, to advance Religion in all Sincerity, Godliness, and Honesty" passed "An Act against several Atheistical, Blasphemous and Execrable Opinions, derogatory to the honor of God, and destructive to humane Society", known as the Blasphemy Act of 1650 and intended to punish those "who should abuse and turn into Licentiousness, the liberty given in matters of Conscience".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/no-series/acts-ordinances-interregnum/pp409-412 August 1650: An Act against several Atheistical, Blasphemous and Execrable Opinions, derogatory to the honor of God, and destructive to humane Society], accessed 15 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Profane cursing and swearing was made punishable by the [[Profane Oaths Act 1745]], which directed that the offender be brought before a justice of the peace, and fined an amount that depended on his social rank.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} It was repealed by section 13 of the [[Criminal Law Act 1967]].

Those denying the [[Trinity]] were deprived of the benefit of the [[Toleration Act 1688]]. The [[Blasphemy Act 1697]] enacted that if any person, educated in or having made profession of the Christian religion, should by writing, preaching, teaching or advised speaking, deny that the members of the [[Holy Trinity]] were God, or should assert that there is more than one god, or deny the Christian religion to be true, or the Holy Scriptures to be of divine authority, he should, upon the first offence, be rendered incapable of holding any office or place of trust, and for the second incapable of bringing any action, of being guardian or executor, or of taking a legacy or deed of gift, and should suffer three years imprisonment without bail.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

An Act of 1812–1813 excepted from these enactments "persons denying as therein mentioned respecting the Holy Trinity".&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

===Relationship between the common law and statutory offences===
A person offending under the Blasphemy Act 1697 was also indictable at common law. In ''Rex v [[Richard Carlile|Carlile]]'',&lt;ref&gt;R v Richard Carlile (1819) 1 St Tr NS 1387, (1819) 3 B &amp; Ald 161, [http://www.commonlii.org/uk/cases/EngR/1819/682.pdf (1819) 106 ER 621]&lt;/ref&gt; Mr Justice Best said:

{{Blockquote|So far as the Statute of William containing provisions so inconsistent with the common law as to operate as a repeal by implication, as far as it applies to the offence of libel, it seems intended to aid the common law. It is called "An Act for the More Effectual Suppression of Blasphemy and Prophaneness." It would ill deserve that name if it abrogated the common law, inasmuch as, for the first offence, it only operates against those who are in possession of offices, or in expectation of them. The rest of the world might with impunity blaspheme God, and prophane the ordinances and institutions of religion, if the common law punishment is put an end to. But the Legislature, in passing this Act, had not the punishment of blasphemy so much in view as the protecting the Government of the country, by preventing infidels from getting into places of trust. In the age of toleration in which that statute passed, neither churchmen or sectarians wished to protect in their infidelity those who disbelieved the Holy Scriptures. On the contrary, all agreed, that as the system of morals which regulated their conduct was built on these Scriptures, none were to be trusted with offices who shewed they were under no religious responsibility. This Act is not confined to those who libel religion, but extends to those who, in the most private intercourse by advised conversation, admit that they disbelieve the Scriptures. Both the common law and this statute are necessary; the first to guard the morals of the people; the second for the immediate protection of the Government.&lt;ref&gt;R v Carlile (Richard) (1819) 3 B &amp; Ald 161 at 165 to 167, (1819) 106 ER 621 at 623&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Scotland==
By the [[Scots law|law of Scotland]], as it originally stood, the punishment for blasphemy was death,&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; a penalty last imposed on [[Thomas Aikenhead]] in Edinburgh in 1697. By an Act of 1825, amended in 1837, blasphemy was made punishable by fine or imprisonment or both.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; The last prosecution for blasphemy in Scotland was in 1843 when bookseller Thomas Paterson was sentenced at Edinburgh High Court to fifteen months in prison for selling profane placards,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

This being the day on which Mr. Thomas Paterson, bookseller, of No. 8, Holywell street, was to appear at this office and answer to four summonses preferred against him for exhibiting certain profane placards in his window, to the annoyance of the neighbourhood and the public—the court was crowded with persons anxious to hear the charges.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Mr. Twyford was the presiding magistrate. Mr. Hall was also on the bench.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The name of Mr. Paterson having been called within and without the court three times, and no answer having been given.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;}}
According to the 18th–19th century legal writer [[David Hume (advocate)|David Hume]] (nephew of the philosopher), Scots law distinguished between blasphemy, which was uttered in passion generally in the heat of the moment, and other offences which involved the propagation of ideas contrary to religion. It is blasphemy, Hume wrote

{{quote|when it is done in a scoffing and railing manner; out of a reproachful disposition in the speaker, and, as it were, with passion against the Almighty, rather than with any purpose of propagating the irreverent opinion. The like sentiments uttered dispassionately or conveyed in any calm or advised form, are rather a heresy or an apostasy than a proper blasphemy.|[[:wikisource:Commonwealth v. Kneeland|Commonwealth v Kneeland]]}}

The [[Human Rights Act 1998]] applies in Scotland as well as England and Wales, and therefore poses similar challenges to the existing Scottish blasphemy laws as those described above. Additionally, some legal commentators believe that, owing to the long time since successful prosecution, blasphemy in Scotland is no longer a crime,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

The '''Clarifying Lawful Overseas Use of Data Act''' or '''CLOUD Act''' ({{USBill|115|HR|4943}}) is a United States [[Law of the United States#Federal law|federal law]] enacted in 2018 by the passing of the [[Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018]], PL 115-141, section&amp;nbsp;105 [[executive agreement]]s on access to data by foreign governments. Primarily the CLOUD Act amends the [[Stored Communications Act]] (SCA) of 1986 to allow federal law enforcement to compel U.S.-based technology companies via warrant or subpoena to provide requested data stored on servers regardless of whether the data are stored in the U.S. or on foreign soil.

==Background==
The CLOUD Act was introduced following difficulties that the [[Federal Bureau of Investigations]] (FBI) had with obtaining remote data through service providers through SCA warrants, as the SCA was written before cloud computing was a viable technology. The situation was highlighted from a 2013 drug trafficking investigation, during which the FBI issued an SCA warrant for emails that a U.S. citizen had stored on one of [[Microsoft]]'s remote servers in Ireland, which Microsoft refused to provide. The legal challenge led to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] in ''[[Microsoft Corp. v. United States]]''. The FBI contended that Microsoft had full control of the data and should be compelled to turn it over in response to the warrant, but Microsoft argued that the SCA did not cover data stored outside the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/international-business/us-business/us-supreme-court-wrestles-with-microsoft-data-privacy-fight/article38126808/ | publisher = [[Reuters]] | via = [[The Globe and Mail]] | first1 = Lawrence | last1 = Hurley | first2 = Dustin | last2= Volz | title=U.S. Supreme Court wrestles with Microsoft data privacy fight |date=February 27, 2018 | accessdate = April 2, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The challenge identified that while the FBI could request a [[mutual legal assistance treaty]] (MLAT) to aid in data discovery during cross-border law enforcement, the process to acquire a new MLAT if one is not in place, or to process a request through an existing MLAT, can be slow and impede law enforcement efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.zdnet.com/article/how-one-judge-single-handedly-killed-trust-in-the-us-technology-industry/ | title = How one judge single-handedly killed trust in the US technology industry | first = Zack | last =  Whittaker | date = August 1, 2014 | accessdate = April 3, 2018 | work = [[ZDNet]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Congress, primarily led by Senator [[Orrin Hatch]], had attempted to create legislation prior to the CLOUD Act to amend the SCA with the concerns of Microsoft and other technologies companies with respect to foreign privacy rights. The "Law Enforcement Access to Data Stored Abroad Act" (LEADS Act) in 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/technology/237328-the-leads-act-and-cloud-computing | title = The LEADS Act and cloud computing | first = Patrick | last = Maines | date = March 30, 2015 | accessdate = March 23, 2018 | work = [[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the International Communications Privacy Act (ICPA) in 2017 were both previous bills intended to amend the SCA but which failed to gain passage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://thehill.com/policy/technology/344823-senators-introduce-new-bill-to-force-law-enforcement-to-obtain-americans| title = Senate bill would ease law enforcement access to overseas data | first =  Ali | last = Breland | date = August 1, 2017 | accessdate = March 23, 2018 | work = [[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/washington/international-communications-privacy-bill-reintroduced/168676 | title = International Communications Privacy Bill Reintroduced | first  = John | last= Eggerton | date = September 15, 2017 | accessdate = March 23, 2018  |work = [[Broadcasting and Cable]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The CLOUD Act is a culmination of these prior bills. Principally, it asserts that U.S. data and communication companies must provide stored data for U.S. citizens on any server they own and operate when requested by warrant, but provides mechanisms for the companies or the courts to reject or challenge these if they believe the request violates the privacy rights of the foreign country the data is stored in. It also provides an alternative and expedited route to MLATs through "executive agreements"; the [[Federal government of the United States#Executive branch|executive branch]] is given the ability to enter into bi-lateral agreements with foreign countries to provide requested data related to its citizens in a streamlined manner, as long as the [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]], with concurrence of the [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]], agree that the foreign country has sufficient protections in place to restrict access to data related to United States citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/2383/text | title =  S.2383 - CLOUD Act | date =February 6, 2018 | accessdate = April 3, 2018 | publisher = United States Congress }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.natlawreview.com/article/cloud-act-bridging-gap-between-technology-and-law | title = The CLOUD Act, Bridging the Gap between Technology and the Law | first=  Ericka | last = Johnson | date = March 19, 2018 | accessdate = April 3, 2018 | work = [[The National Law Review]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Support==
The CLOUD Act had support of the Department of Justice and of major technology companies like [[Microsoft]], [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], and [[Google]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-bullish-on-congress-inclusion-of-cloud-act-in-funding-bill/ | title = Microsoft bullish on Congress' inclusion of CLOUD Act in funding bill | first = Mary Jo | last = Foley | date = March 22, 2018 | accessdate = April 2, 2018 | work = [[ZDNet]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="salon 032218"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://slate.com/technology/2018/03/cloud-act-microsoft-justice-department-omnibus-spending-bill.html | title = Congress Put the CLOUD Act in Its Spending Bill.

These groups argued that the bill stripped away [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] rights against unreasonable searches and seizures, since the government could enter into data rights sharing agreements with foreign countries and bypass U.S. courts, and affected users would not have to be notified when such warrants were issued.&lt;ref name="salon 032218"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/22/17131004/cloud-act-congress-omnibus-passed-mlat | title = House passes controversial legislation giving the US more access to overseas data | first1 = Russell | last1 = Brandom |first2= Colin |last2= Lecher | date = March 22, 2018 | accessdate = April 2, 2018 | work = [[The Verge]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these groups feared the government would not fully review requests from foreign countries for their citizens stored on servers in the U.S., potentially allowing such data to be used in bad faith in those countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://money.cnn.com/2018/03/31/technology/microsoft-lawsuit-supreme-court-justice-department/index.html | title = Microsoft email privacy case no longer needed, DOJ says | first=  Jackie  |last=  Watters | date = March 31, 2018 | accessdate = April 2, 2018 | work = [[CNN]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Passing==
After being introduced in the [[115th United States Congress]] as H.R.4943, the act was included as section 105 of H.R.1625, the [[Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018]], an [[omnibus spending bill]], which passed both houses of Congress and was signed into law, P.L. 115-141, on March 23, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2018/03/23/trump-threatens-to-veto-omnibus-bill-because-it-does-not-address-daca-recipients/ | title = Trump signs $1.3 trillion spending bill despite veto threat on Twitter | first1 = John | last1 = Wagner | first2 =  Mike  |last2= DeBonis | date = March 23, 2018 | accessdate = March 23, 2018 | work = [[The Washington Post]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 17 2018, the Supreme Court, based on concurring briefs submitted by the Department of Justice, vacated the ''United States v. Microsoft Corp.'' and remanded it back to lower court to do the same, as the Department of Justice was able to secure a new warrant under the CLOUD Act and was no longer pursuing the initial warrant, rendering the case [[mootness|moot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-31/justice-department-asks-high-court-to-drop-microsoft-email-case | title = Justice Department Asks Court to Drop Microsoft Email Case | first = Greg | last= Stohr | date = March 31, 2018 | accessdate = April 2, 2018 | work = [[Bloomberg Businessweek]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/justice-department-asks-supreme-court-to-moot-microsoft-email-case-citing-new-law/2018/03/31/e3c46e60-34f6-11e8-8bdd-cdb33a5eef83_story.html | title = Justice Department asks Supreme Court to moot Microsoft email case, citing new law | first = Ellen | last = Nakashima | date = March 31, 2018 | accessdate = April 2, 2018 | work = [[The Washington Post]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-microsoft/supreme-court-rules-that-microsoft-email-privacy-dispute-is-moot-idUSKBN1HO23S | title = Supreme Court rules that Microsoft email privacy dispute is moot | publisher = [[Reuters]] | date = April 17, 2018 | accessdate = April 17, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Cabinet of the French Consulate''' was formed following the [[Coup of 18 Brumaire]] which replaced the [[French Directory|Directory]] with the [[French Consulate|Consulate]]. The new regime was ratified by the adoption of the [[Constitution of the Year VIII]] on 24 December 1799 and headed by [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] as [[French Consulate|First Consul]], with [[Jean Jacques Régis de Cambacérès]] and [[Charles-François Lebrun]] serving as Second and Third Consuls respectively.

{{SCOTUS series}}
The '''Chief Justice of the United States''' is the [[chief judge]] of the nine-member [[Supreme Court of the United States]], the highest [[Judiciary|judicial]] body in the [[United States]]. As such, the chief justice is the highest-ranking judge of the [[Federal judiciary of the United States|federal judiciary]]—one of the three branches of the [[federal government of the United States|federal government]]. [[Appointments Clause|Article II, Section 2, Clause 2]] of the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] grants [[plenary power]] to the [[President of the United States]] to nominate, and with the [[advice and consent]] (confirmation) of the [[United States Senate]], appoint a chief justice, who serves until they resign, are [[Impeachment in the United States|impeached and convicted]], retire, or die.

The Chief Justice has significant influence in the [[Procedures of the Supreme Court of the United States#Selection of cases|selection of cases for review]], presides when [[oral arguments]] are held, and leads the discussion of cases among the justices. Additionally, when the Court renders an opinion, the chief justice—if in the majority—chooses who writes the Court's opinion. When deciding a case, however, the chief justice's vote counts no more than that of any [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|associate justice]]. 

[[Article One of the United States Constitution#Clause 6: Trial of Impeachment|Article I, Section 3, Clause 6]] of the Constitution designates the chief justice to preside during presidential impeachment trials in the Senate; this has occurred twice. Also, while nowhere mandated, the [[Oath of office of the President of the United States|presidential oath of office]] is typically administered by the Chief Justice.

Additionally, the Chief Justice serves as a spokesperson for the federal government's judicial branch and acts as a [[chief administrative officer]] for the federal courts. The Chief Justice presides over the [[Judicial Conference of the United States|Judicial Conference]] and, in that capacity, appoints the director and deputy director of the [[Administrative Office of the United States Courts|Administrative Office]]. The Chief Justice is also an [[Ex officio member|''ex officio'' member]] of the Board of Regents of the [[Smithsonian Institution]] and, by custom, is elected [[Chancellor (education)|chancellor]] of the board.

Since the Supreme Court was established in 1789, 17 people have served as chief justice. The first was [[John Jay]] (1789–1795). The current chief justice is [[John Roberts]] (since 2005). Four—[[Edward Douglass White]], [[Charles Evans Hughes]], [[Harlan Fiske Stone]], and [[William Rehnquist]]—were previously confirmed for associate justice and subsequently confirmed for chief justice separately.

==Origin, title, and appointment to office==
The United States Constitution does not explicitly establish an office of Chief Justice, but presupposes its existence with a single reference in [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Clause 6: Trial of Impeachment|Article I, Section 3, Clause 6]]: "When the President of the United States is tried, the Chief Justice shall preside." Nothing more is said in the Constitution regarding the office. [[Article Three of the United States Constitution|Article III, Section 1]], which authorizes the establishment of the Supreme Court, refers to all members of the Court simply as "judges". The [[Judiciary Act of 1789]] created the distinctive titles of ''Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States'' and ''Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States''.

In 1866, at the urging of [[Salmon P. Chase]], [[United States Congress|Congress]] restyled the chief justice's title to the current ''Chief Justice of the United States''. The first person whose Supreme Court commission contained the modified title was [[Melville Fuller]] in 1888.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fjc.gov/history/administration/administrative-agencies-office-chief-justice-1789-present|title=Administrative Agencies: Office of the Chief Justice, 1789–present|publisher=Federal Judicial Center|location=Washington, D.C.|accessdate=April 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The associate justices' title was not altered in 1866, and remains as originally created.

The chief justice, like all [[United States federal judge|federal judges]], is [[Appointment and confirmation to the Supreme Court of the United States|nominated by the President and confirmed to office by the U.S. Senate]]. [[Article Three of the United States Constitution|Article III]], Section 1 of the Constitution specifies that they "shall hold their Offices during good Behavior". This language means that the appointments are effectively [[Life tenure|for life]], and that, once in office, justices' tenure ends only when they [[Death|die]], [[Retirement|retire]], resign, or are removed from office through the [[Impeachment in the United States|impeachment process]]. Since 1789, 15 presidents have made a total of 22 [[List of nominations to the Supreme Court of the United States|official nominations]] to the position.&lt;ref name="fas"&gt;{{cite web|last1=McMillion|first1=Barry J.|last2=Rutkus|first2=Denis Steven|date=July 6, 2018|title=Supreme Court Nominations, 1789 to 2017: Actions by the Senate, the Judiciary Committee, and the President|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL33225.pdf|website=fas.org (Federation of American Scientists)|publisher=Congressional Research Service|location=Washington, D.C.|accessdate=August 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The salary of the chief justice is set by Congress; the current (2018) annual salary is $267,000, which is slightly higher than that of associate justices, which is $255,300.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscourts.gov/judges-judgeships/judicial-compensation |title=Judicial Compensation |publisher=Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts |accessdate=January 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of appointing an individual to serve as chief justice is grounded in tradition; while the Constitution mandates that there be a chief justice, it is silent on the subject of how one is chosen and by whom. There is no specific constitutional prohibition against using another method to select the chief justice from among those justices properly appointed and confirmed to the Supreme Court. Constitutional law scholar Todd Pettys has proposed that presidential appointment of chief justices should be done away with, and replaced by a process that permits the Justices to select their own chief justice.&lt;ref name="Pettys"&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Todd E. |last=Pettys |title=Choosing a Chief Justice: Presidential Prerogative or a Job for the Court? |journal=Journal of Law &amp; Politics |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=231–281 |year=2006 |publisher=The University of Iowa College of Law  |url=https://works.bepress.com/todd_pettys/8/ |ssrn=958829 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three [[incumbent]] associate justices have been nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate as chief justice: Edward Douglass White in 1910, Harlan Fiske Stone in 1941, and William Rehnquist in 1986. A fourth, [[Abe Fortas]], was nominated to the position in 1968, but was not confirmed. As an associate justice does not have to resign his or her seat on the Court in order to be nominated as chief justice, Fortas remained an associate justice. Similarly, when associate justice [[William Cushing]] was nominated and confirmed as chief justice in January 1796, but declined the office, he too remained on the Court. Two former associate justices subsequently returned to service on the Court as chief justice. [[John Rutledge]] was the first. President Washington gave him a [[recess appointment]] in 1795. However, his subsequent nomination to the office was not confirmed by the Senate, and he left office and the Court. In 1933, former associate justice Charles Evans Hughes was confirmed as chief justice. Additionally, in December 1800, former chief justice John Jay was nominated and confirmed to the position a second time, but ultimately declined it, opening the way for the appointment of [[John Marshall]].&lt;ref name="fas"/&gt;

==Duties==
Along with his general responsibilities as a member of the Supreme Court, the Chief Justice has several unique duties to fulfill.

===Impeachment trials===
Article I, section 3 of the U.S. Constitution stipulates that the Chief Justice shall preside over impeachment trials of the President of the United States in the U.S. Senate. Two Chief Justices, [[Salmon P. Chase]] and [[William Rehnquist]], have presided over the trial in the Senate that follows an [[impeachment]] of the president – Chase in 1868 over the proceedings against President [[Andrew Johnson]] and Rehnquist in 1999 over the proceedings against President [[Bill Clinton]]. Both presidents were subsequently acquitted.

===Seniority===
Many of the Court's [[Procedures of the Supreme Court of the United States|procedures and inner workings]] are governed by the rules of [[Wiktionary:protocol|protocol]] based on the [[seniority]] of the justices. The chief justice always ranks first in the [[order of precedence]]—regardless of the length of the officeholder's service (even if shorter than that of one or more associate justices). This elevated status has enabled successive chief justices to define and refine both the Court's culture and its judicial priorities.

The chief justice sets the agenda for the weekly meetings where the justices review the petitions for [[certiorari]], to decide whether to hear or deny each case. The Supreme Court agrees to hear less than one percent of the cases petitioned to it. While associate justices may append items to the weekly agenda, in practice this initial agenda-setting power of the chief justice has significant influence over the direction of the court. Nonetheless, a chief justice's influence may be limited by circumstances and the associate justices' understanding of [[Jurisprudence|legal principles]]; it is definitely limited by the fact that he has only a single vote of nine on the decision whether to grant or deny certiorari.&lt;ref name=LIICornell&gt;{{cite web|title=Judiciary|publisher=Legal Information Institute, Cornell Law School|location=Ithaca, New York|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/judiciary| accessdate=May 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UPennLaw&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cross|first1=Frank B.|last2=Lindquist| first2=Stefanie|date=June 2006|volume=154|issue=6|title=The decisional significance of the Chief Justice| journal=University of Pennsylvania Law Review|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Law School|location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania| url=https://www.law.upenn.edu/journals/lawreview/articles/volume154/issue6/CrossLindquist154U.Pa.L.Rev.1665(2006).pdf| pages=1665–1707}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the chief justice's elevated stature, his vote carries the same legal weight as the vote of each associate justice. Additionally, he has no legal authority to overrule the verdicts or interpretations of the other eight judges or tamper with them.&lt;ref name=LIICornell/&gt; The task of assigning who shall write the opinion for the majority falls to the most senior justice in the majority. Thus, when the chief justice is in the majority, he always assigns the opinion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Brien |first=David M. |title=Storm Center: The Supreme Court in American Politics |edition=8th |publisher=W. W. Norton |year=2008 |location=New York |isbn=978-0-393-93218-8 |page=267}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early in his tenure, Chief Justice [[John Marshall]] insisted upon holdings which the justices could unanimously back as a means to establish and build the Court's national prestige. In doing so, Marshall would often write the opinions himself, and actively discouraged dissenting opinions. [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Associate Justice]] [[William Johnson (judge)|William Johnson]] eventually persuaded Marshall and the rest of the Court to adopt its present practice: one justice writes an opinion for the majority, and the rest are free to write their own separate opinions or not, whether concurring or dissenting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Brien |first=David M. |title=Storm Center: The Supreme Court in American Politics |edition=8th |publisher=W. W. Norton |year=2008 |location=New York |isbn=978-0-393-93218-8 |page=115 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The chief justice's formal prerogative—when in the majority—to assign which justice will write the Court's opinion is perhaps his most influential power,&lt;ref name=UPennLaw/&gt; as this enables him to influence the historical record.&lt;ref name=LIICornell/&gt; He "may assign this task to the individual justice best able to hold together a fragile coalition, to an ideologically amenable colleague, or to himself." Opinion authors can have a big influence on the content of an opinion; two justices in the same majority, given the opportunity, might write very different majority opinions.&lt;ref name=UPennLaw/&gt; A chief justice who knows well the associate justices can therefore do much—by the simple act of selecting the justice who writes the opinion of the court—to affect the general character or tone of an opinion, which in turn can affect the interpretation of that opinion in cases before lower courts in the years to come.

Additionally, the chief justice chairs the conferences where cases are discussed and tentatively voted on by the justices. He normally speaks first and so has influence in framing the discussion. Although the chief justice votes first—the Court votes in order of seniority—he may strategically pass in order to ensure membership in the majority if desired.&lt;ref name=UPennLaw/&gt; It is reported that:
{{Quote|Chief Justice [[Warren Burger]] was renowned, and even vilified in some quarters, for voting strategically during conference discussions on the Supreme Court in order to control the Court’s agenda through opinion assignment. Indeed, Burger is said to have often changed votes to join the majority coalition, cast "phony votes" by voting against his preferred position, and declined to express a position at conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=Passing and Strategic Voting on the U.S. Supreme Court|last1=Johnson|first1=Timothy R.|last2=Spriggs II|first2=James F.|last3=Wahlbeck|first3=Paul J.|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.509.6707&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|journal=Law &amp; Society Review| publisher=Law and Society Association, through Wiley|date=June 2005|volume=39|issue=2|pages=349–377|accessdate=May 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Oath of office===
The Chief Justice typically administers the [[oath of office]] at the [[Inauguration Day|inauguration]] of the President of the United States. This is a tradition, rather than a constitutional responsibility of the Chief Justice; the Constitution does not require that the oath be administered by anyone in particular, simply that it be taken by the president. Law empowers any federal and state judge, as well as [[notary public|notaries public]] (such as [[John Calvin Coolidge, Sr.]]), to administer [[oath]]s and [[affirmation in law|affirmations]].

If the Chief Justice is ill or incapacitated, the oath is usually administered by the next senior member of the Supreme Court. Seven times, someone other than the Chief Justice of the United States administered the oath of office to the President.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/pihtml/pioaths.html |title=Presidential Inaugurations: Presidential Oaths of Office |publisher=Memory.loc.gov |date= |accessdate=June 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Livingston (1746-1813)|Robert Livingston]], as Chancellor of the State of New York (the state's highest ranking judicial office), administered the oath of office to [[George Washington]] at his first inauguration; there was no Chief Justice of the United States, nor any other federal judge prior to their appointments by President Washington in the months following his inauguration. [[William Cushing]], an associate justice of the Supreme Court, administered Washington's second oath of office in 1793. [[Calvin Coolidge]]'s [[John Calvin Coolidge, Sr.|father]], a notary public, administered the oath to his son after the death of Warren Harding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historicvermont.org/coolidge/oathrm.html |title=Excerpt from Coolidge's autobiography |publisher=Historicvermont.org |accessdate=May 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This, however, was contested upon Coolidge's return to Washington and his oath was re-administered by Judge [[Adolph A. Hoehling, Jr.]] of the [[U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/2000/winter/abrupt-transition-1.html |title=Prologue: Selected Articles |publisher=Archives.gov |accessdate=May 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[John Tyler]] and [[Millard Fillmore]] were both sworn in on the death of their predecessors by Chief Justice [[William Cranch]] of the Circuit Court of the District of Columbia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://inaugural.senate.gov/history/daysevents/potusswearingin05.cfm |title=Presidential Swearing-In Ceremony, Part 5 of 6 |publisher=Inaugural.senate.gov |accessdate=August 17, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110203094226/http://inaugural.senate.gov/history/daysevents/potusswearingin05.cfm |archivedate=February 3, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chester A. Arthur]] and [[Theodore Roosevelt]]'s initial oaths reflected the unexpected nature of their taking office.  On November 22, 1963, after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Judge [[Sarah T. Hughes]], a federal district court judge of the [[United States District Court]] for the Northern District of Texas, administered the oath of office to then Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson aboard the [[Air Force One|presidential airplane]].

In addition, the Chief Justice ordinarily administers the oath of office to newly appointed and confirmed associate justices, whereas the senior associate justice will normally swear in a new Chief Justice or vice president.

===Other duties===
Since the tenure of [[William Howard Taft]], the office of the Chief Justice has moved beyond just [[Primus inter pares|first among equals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Brien |first=David M. |title=Storm Center: The Supreme Court in American Politics |edition=8th |publisher=W. W. Norton |year=2008 |location=New York |isbn=978-0-393-93218-8 |page=153 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chief Justice also:
*Serves as the head of the federal judiciary.
*Serves as the head of the [[Judicial Conference of the United States]], the chief administrative body of the [[United States federal courts]]. The Judicial Conference is empowered by the [[Rules Enabling Act]] to propose rules, which are then promulgated by the Supreme Court (subject to disapproval by Congress under the [[Congressional Review Act]]), to ensure the smooth operation of the federal courts. Major portions of the [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]] and [[Federal Rules of Evidence]] have been adopted by most state legislatures and are considered canonical by American [[law school]]s.
*Appoints sitting federal judges to the membership of the [[United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court]] (FISC), a "secret court" which oversees requests for surveillance warrants by federal police agencies (primarily the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|F.B.I.]]) against suspected foreign [[intelligence agent]]s inside the United States. (''see ''{{UnitedStatesCode|50|1803}}).
*Appoints the members of the [[Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation]], a special tribunal of seven sitting federal judges responsible for selecting the venue for coordinated pretrial proceedings in situations where multiple related federal actions have been filed in different judicial districts.
*Serves [[ex officio]] as a member of the Board of Regents, and by custom as the [[Chancellor (education)|Chancellor]], of the [[Smithsonian Institution]].
*Supervises the acquisition of books for the [[Law Library of Congress|Law Library]] of the [[Library of Congress]].&lt;ref name="loc history"&gt;{{cite web|title=Jefferson's Legacy: A Brief History of the Library of Congress|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]|url=https://www.loc.gov/loc/legacy/loc.html|date=March 6, 2006|accessdate=January 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike Senators and Representatives who are constitutionally prohibited from holding any other "office of trust or profit" of the United States or of any state while holding their congressional seats, the Chief Justice and the other members of the federal judiciary are not barred from serving in other positions.  Chief Justice John Jay served as a diplomat to negotiate the so-called [[Jay Treaty]] (also known as the Treaty of London of 1794), Justice [[Robert H. Jackson]] was appointed by President Truman to be the U.S. Prosecutor in the Nuremberg trials of leading Nazis, and Chief Justice [[Earl Warren]] chaired [[Warren Commission|The President's Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy]].  As described above, the Chief Justice holds office in the Smithsonian Institution and the Library of Congress.

===Disability or vacancy===
Under {{USC|28|3}}, when the chief justice is unable to discharge his functions, or when that office is vacant, the chief justice's duties are carried out by the most senior associate justice until the disability or vacancy ends.&lt;ref name="Pettys"/&gt; Currently, since August 2018, [[Clarence Thomas]] is the most senior associate justice.

== List of Chief Justices ==
Since the Supreme Court was established in 1789, the following 17 persons have served as Chief Justice:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = U.S. Senate: Supreme Court Nominations: 1789–Present|url = https://www.senate.gov/pagelayout/reference/nominations/Nominations.htm|website = www.senate.gov|access-date = February 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Justices 1789 to Present|url = https://www.supremecourt.gov/about/members_text.aspx|website = www.supremecourt.gov|access-date = January 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{mergefrom|Law costs draftsman|date=July 2017}}
In English law, a '''costs lawyer''' is a legal professional concerned with legal costs who has attained [[rights of audience]] and rights to conduct [[Costs (English law)|costs]] [[litigation]].

Costs lawyers are concerned with all aspects of [[solicitor]] costs that are controlled by both [[statute]] and [[common law]].  They are concerned with [[Costs (law)|costs]] relating to all areas of the law and deal with every conceivable type of legal matter that touches upon the subject of costs. A costs lawyer's skill is as essential to successful [[litigation]] as that of a [[solicitor]] or [[barrister]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

From January 2011, the [[Association of Law Costs Draftsmen]] changed its name to the Association of Costs Lawyers. The [[Association of Costs Lawyers]] was granted Authorised Body Status by The Association of Law Costs Draftsmen Order 2006 (S.I. 2006 no 3333) which came into force on 1 January 2007. 

==Qualification==
From the introduction of costs lawyer status in 2007 until 2011 any [[law costs draftsman]] who had successfully passed the Association of Costs Lawyer's training course, and had worked in costs for at least 5 years, would become a Fellow of the Association. The Fellow was then required to successfully complete an advocacy course to become a costs lawyer.

However the process to become a costs lawyer has changed. Anyone (who is not currently a fellow of the ACL) that now wishes to become a costs lawyer must complete the Association of Costs Lawyers' three-year modular training course and pass both theory and practical exams in order to qualify. In addition they must also have been working in costs for at least 5 years.

==Rights of audience==
Costs lawyers have rights of audience in all proceedings being conducted under Parts 43 - 48 of the [[Civil Procedure Rules]] 1999 and under Part 52 with regard to appeals from detailed assessments before a [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] Judge or a [[Circuit Court]] Judge.

They hold rights of audience in all proceedings at first instance relating to costs before the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]] (and previously the [[House of Lords]]) and the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]].

They also have rights of audience in all determinations as to costs in Community Legal Service regulations, Criminal Defence regulations, under section 16 of the [[Prosecution of Offences Act 1985]] and the costs in Criminal Cases (General) Regulations 1986.

A costs lawyer has the right to litigate under sections 64(3) and (4), 68, 69, 70, 71 and 74 of the [[Solicitors Act 1974]] and any subsequent enactment of provisions thereof.

==Commissioners for oaths==
{{Main|Commissioners for Oaths}}
A costs lawyer has the right to administer oaths and take affidavits under section 113 of the [[Courts and Legal Services Act 1990]].

==Areas of involvement==
The three main areas in which costs lawyers may become involved are:

===Costs payable between parties===
The unsuccessful litigant is usually ordered to pay the successful litigant’s costs and, if those costs cannot be agreed, a detailed bill of costs is prepared and served.  The paying party then has to serve a schedule of points of those items in the bill he wishes to dispute before the bill is lodged at court and a detailed assessment hearing takes place at which the points are argued and a decision made by the court.

A costs lawyer will also usually be involved in the costs management of substantive proceedings, by preparing and managing costs budgets.

===Solicitor and client costs===
These are costs payable by a client to his own solicitor.  Different rules apply to the costs where court proceedings have been commenced, known as contentious business, to those applicable to non-contentious matters such as conveyancing, probate and general advice.  A client who is unhappy with his solicitor's bill has remedies available if he wishes to challenge it.  If either the client or the solicitor is dissatisfied with the outcome of that request or if the bill relates to contentious business, either the client or the solicitor may apply to the court for the bill to be assessed.  A costs lawyer may be instructed to prepare a detailed bill of costs for assessment, to advise on law and procedure and, subsequently, if instructed by a solicitor or a litigant, to argue in support or to oppose the bill.

===Public funded (legal aid) costs===
Where a solicitor is representing a publicly funded client, a detailed bill is usually required to be assessed either by the court or the Legal Services Commission before payment can be made out of the community legal fund to the solicitor.  Whilst such bills are usually assessed without any formal hearing, if an amount has been disallowed in respect of which the solicitor wishes to object, an appointment can be obtained and the matter argued at a hearing.  In criminal cases, the objections to an amount disallowed are usually made in writing and, often, a costs lawyer will be instructed to prepare the written submissions.

==Compliance with rules and regulations==
The ACL has bylaws, a code of conduct, regulations and rules that all members are required to comply with at all times. New members are required to certify that they have read all bylaws, a code of conduct, regulations and rules and agree to be bound by these.

===Continuing professional development===
All members, except retired and affiliate members, are required to undertake 12 hours in continuing professional development each year.

===Insurance===
With the exception of those costs lawyers who work exclusively in a solicitor’s office on a [[PAYE]] basis (i.e. in-house), all members of the association are required to produce proof by declaration from an insurer or broker that either as an individual or as a partner, director or employee of a firm of law costs draftsmen (i.e. freelance) work undertaken is protected by professional indemnity insurance cover to the value of at least £100,000 plus loss of documents cover.

===Journal===
A regular journal called the ''Costs Lawyer'' keeps members up to date with trends in practice, rules and law relating to the assessment of costs and general information.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2905">{{Refimprove|date=September 2016}}
In law, a '''declaration''' ordinarily refers to a [[Legal judgment|judgment]] of the court or an [[arbitration award|award]] of an arbitration tribunal that is a binding adjudication of the rights or other legal relations of the parties which does not provide for or order enforcement.  Where the declaration is made by a court, it is usually referred to as a ''declaratory judgment''.  Less commonly, where declaratory relief is awarded by an [[arbitrator]], it is normally called a ''declaratory award''.

Declaratory relief is most commonly seen in two particular circumstances:
# applications for declarations of legitimacy, in family and [[probate]] legal proceedings; and
# under [[insurance]] policies, for a determination of whether a [[peril]] is covered by a particular policy.

However, applications for declaratory relief in other areas have become more widespread, particularly in Europe. A key feature in relation to this development has been the [[Brussels Regime|Brussels and Lugano Conventions on civil jurisdiction and judgments]] relating to members of the [[European Economic Area]] (EEA).  In certain circumstances, jurisdiction is awarded under the conventions to the courts first seised of the matter. This has led to a rise in defendants taking pre-emptive action by seeking "declarations of non-liability" in a [[race to the courthouse]] to ensure that they choose the court first seised rather than waiting for the claimant to do so.

==Other legal uses==
Declaration is used (sometimes rendered as a verb) in other ways in certain legal systems.
*In some legal systems, a declaration is similar to an [[affidavit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://scripts.martindale.com/litigation-law/article_Buckley-King-A-Legal-Professional_1514598.htm|title=When to Swear and When to Declare: Affidavit or Declaration? |publisher=Martindale-Hubbell |accessdate=2016-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In relation to [[company (law)|companies]], declaration is the first step in relation to distribution and payment of [[dividends]].
*In [[trust law]], a [[settlor]] who declares that he holds certain property on trust is said to make a ''declaration of trust''.
*''[[Dying declaration]]s'' are an exception to the rule against [[hearsay]] in many legal systems.
*''Declarations against interest'' are also an exception to the rule against hearsay in many legal systems.
*A formal ''declaration of default'' is required to enforce creditors' [[security interest|security rights]] in some legal systems.
*An [[interpretative declaration]] is a formal note made by a state upon ratifying a treaty clarifying the state's interpretation of the treaty.

The '''Drug Enforcement Administration''' ('''DEA''') ({{IPAc-en|d|i|.|i|ˈ|eɪ}}) is a [[Federal law enforcement in the United States|United States federal law enforcement agency]] under the [[United States Department of Justice]], tasked with combating [[drug smuggling]] and distribution within the United States. The DEA is the lead agency for domestic enforcement of the [[Controlled Substances Act]], sharing [[concurrent jurisdiction]] with the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI), [[Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] (ICE), [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]] (CBP), and the [[Department of Homeland Security]] (DHS). It has sole responsibility for coordinating and pursuing US drug investigations both domestic and abroad.

==History and mandate==
[[File:Drug Enforcement Administration.svg|thumb|500px|right|Map of the 21 DEA domestic field divisions: 1. Chicago, 2. Detroit, 3.Atlanta, 4. Dallas, 5. Denver, 6. Boston, 7. El Paso, 8. Houston, 9. Los Angeles, 10. Miami, 11. Newark, 12. New Orleans, 13. New York, 14. Philadelphia, 15. Phoenix, 16. San Diego, 17. San Francisco, 18. Seattle, 19. St. Louis, 20. Caribbean, 21. Washington, D.C.]]

The Drug Enforcement Administration was established on July 1, 1973, by Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1973, signed by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Richard Nixon]] on July 28.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://resources.learningforlife.org/exploring/scholarships/pdf/dea.pdf |work=Learning for Life |title=Drug Enforcement Administration: Drug Abuse Prevention Service Award |accessdate=October 9, 2016 |format=PDF |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161020143354/http://resources.learningforlife.org/exploring/scholarships/pdf/dea.pdf |archive-date=October 20, 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It proposed the creation of a single [[List of United States federal agencies|federal agency]] to enforce the [[federal drug laws]] as well as consolidate and coordinate the government's [[drug control]] activities. [[United States Congress|Congress]] accepted the proposal, as they were concerned with the growing availability of drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deamuseum.org/dea_history_book/1970_1975.htm|title=History of the DEA: 1970 – 1975|publisher=deamuseum.org DEA museum|accessdate=April 30, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070928044643/http://www.deamuseum.org/dea_history_book/1970_1975.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = September 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the [[Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs]] (BNDD), the [[Office of Drug Abuse Law Enforcement]] (ODALE); approximately 600 Special Agents of the Bureau of Customs, Customs Agency Service, and other federal offices merged to create the DEA.&lt;ref name=pbs&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/dope/etc/cron.html|title=Marijuana Timeline|accessdate=April 23, 2007|publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the early 1970s, DEA headquarters was located at 1405 I ("Eye") Street NW in downtown Washington, D.C. With the overall growth of the agency in the 1980s (owing to the increased emphasis on federal drug law enforcement efforts) and a concurrent growth in the headquarters staff, DEA began to search for a new headquarters location; locations in [[Arkansas]], [[Mississippi]], and various abandoned military bases around the United States were considered. However, then-[[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[Edwin Meese]] determined that the headquarters had to be located in close proximity to the Attorney General's office. Thus, in 1989, the headquarters relocated to 600–700 Army-Navy Drive in the [[Pentagon City, Arlington, Virginia|Pentagon City]] area of Arlington, Virginia, near the [[Pentagon City (Washington Metro)|Metro station]] with the same name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usdoj.gov/dea/pubs/history/1985-1990.html |title=DEA History Book, 1985–1990 |publisher=[[United States Department of Justice]] |accessdate=August 31, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080622214536/http://www.usdoj.gov/dea/pubs/history/1985-1990.html |archivedate =June 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 19, 1995, [[Timothy McVeigh]] attacked the [[Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building]] in [[Oklahoma City]] because it housed regional offices for the FBI, [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives]] (ATF), and DEA, all of which had carried out raids that he viewed as unjustified intrusions on the rights of the people;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Michel, Lou |author2=Herbeck, Dan|title=American Terrorist}}&lt;/ref&gt; this attack caused the deaths of two DEA employees, one task force member, and two contractors in the [[Oklahoma City bombing]]. Subsequently, the DEA headquarters complex was classified as a Level IV installation under [[United States federal building security]] standards, meaning it was to be considered a high-risk law enforcement target for terrorists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Joseph|title=Anti-Terrorism: Criteria, Tools &amp; Technology|url=http://www.protectiveglazing.org/resources/Anti-Terrorism%20-%20Criteria,%20Tools%20and%20Technology.pdf|website=Protective Glazing|publisher=Applied Research Associates, Inc.|accessdate=1 October 2014|date=2002|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130918143729/http://www.protectiveglazing.org/resources/Anti-Terrorism%20-%20Criteria%2C%20Tools%20and%20Technology.pdf|archive-date=September 18, 2013|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Security measures include hydraulic steel roadplates to enforce [[standoff distance]] from the building, metal detectors, and guard stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cannabisculture.com/articles/1797.html |title=The DEA museum &amp;#124; Cannabis Culture Magazine |publisher=Cannabisculture.com |date=December 15, 2009 |accessdate=August 31, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119062135/http://www.cannabisculture.com/articles/1797.html |archivedate=January 19, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2003, the DEA established a Digital Evidence Laboratory within its Office of Forensic Sciences.&lt;ref name=History&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dea.gov/pubs/history/1999-2003.html |title=1999–2003 |accessdate=June 3, 2007 |publisher=DEA |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070526082104/http://www.dea.gov/pubs/history/1999-2003.html |archivedate=May 26, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organization ==
[[Image:DEA-Agents.jpeg|thumb|Two DEA agents in a [[shooting range|shoot house]] exercise.]]

The DEA is headed by an ''Administrator of Drug Enforcement'' appointed by the President of the United States and confirmed by the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]]. The Administrator reports to the [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] through the [[United States Deputy Attorney General|Deputy Attorney General]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://a257.g.akamaitech.net/7/257/2422/08aug20051500/edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2005/julqtr/pdf/28cfr0.102.pdf |publisher=Department of Justice |title=Title 28, C.F.R., Part 0.102 |page=57 |accessdate=April 28, 2007 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070810114233/http://a257.g.akamaitech.net/7/257/2422/08aug20051500/edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2005/julqtr/pdf/28cfr0.102.pdf |archivedate=August 10, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Administrator is assisted by a Deputy Administrator, the Chief of Operations, the Chief Inspector, and three Assistant Administrators (for the Operations Support, Intelligence, and Human Resources Divisions). Other senior staff include the chief financial officer and the Chief Counsel. The Administrator and Deputy Administrator are the only presidentially-appointed personnel in the DEA; all other DEA officials are career government employees. DEA's headquarters is located in [[Arlington, Virginia]] across from the [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]]. It maintains its own DEA Academy located on the [[Marine Corps Base Quantico]] at [[Quantico, Virginia]] along with the [[FBI Academy]]. It maintains 21 domestic field divisions with 221 field offices and 92 foreign offices in 70 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usdoj.gov/dea/agency/domestic.htm |title=DEA Office Locations |publisher=Drug Enforcement Administration |accessdate=July 9, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080722205257/http://www.usdoj.gov/dea/agency/domestic.htm |archivedate=July 22, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; With a budget exceeding $2 billion, DEA employs over 10,800 people, including over 4,600 Special Agents and 800 Intelligence Analysts. Becoming a Special Agent or Intelligence Analyst with the DEA is a competitive process.

===Special agents===
[[File:Miguelrodriguez-extradition.png|thumb|DEA agents escort Colombian [[drug lord]] [[Miguel Rodríguez Orejuela]] after being extradited to the United States in 2005]]

As of 2017 there were 4,650 special agents employed by the Drug Enforcement Administration. DEA agents' starting salary is $49,746–$55,483. After four years working as an agent, the salary jumps to above $92,592.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Top Careers for Students of Criminology and Criminal Justice|url=http://online.ccj.pdx.edu/resources/infographics/top-careers-for-students-of-criminology-and-criminal-justice-ig/|website=Portland State University|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After receiving a conditional offer of employment, recruits must then complete a 19-week rigorous training which includes lessons in firearms proficiency (including basic marksmanship), weapons safety, tactical shooting, and deadly-force decision training. In order to graduate, students must maintain an academic average of 80 percent on academic examinations, pass the firearms-qualification test, successfully demonstrate leadership and sound decision-making in practical scenarios, and pass rigorous physical-task tests. Upon graduation, recruits earn the title of DEA Special Agent.

The DEA excludes from consideration job applicants who have a history of any use of [[narcotics]] or illicit drugs. Investigation usually includes a polygraph test for special-agent, diversion-investigator, and intelligence research specialist positions.

{{quote|text=Applicants who are found, through investigation or personal admission, to have experimented with or used narcotics or dangerous drugs, except those medically prescribed, will not be considered for employment with the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). Exceptions to this policy may be made for applicants who admit to limited youthful and experimental use of [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]]. Such applicants may be considered for employment if there is no evidence of regular, confirmed usage and the full-field background investigation and results of the other steps in the process are otherwise favorable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usdoj.gov/dea/job/agent/bef_drugQuest.html|publisher=U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration|title=Drug Questionnaire|accessdate=April 28, 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070513034556/http://www.usdoj.gov/dea/job/agent/bef_drugQuest.html|archivedate=May 13, 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The DEA's relatively firm stance on this issue contrasts with that of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], which in 2005 considered relaxing its hiring policy relevant to individual drug-use history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9646619/from/RL.4/ |title=FBI may relax hiring policy on drug use|publisher=MSNBC |date=October 9, 2005 |accessdate=August 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aviation Division===
The DEA Aviation Division or Office of Aviation Operations (OA) (formerly Aviation Section) is an airborne division based in [[Fort Worth Alliance Airport]], Texas. The current OA fleet consists of 106 aircraft and 124 DEA pilots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The DEA shares a communications system with the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] for communication with state and regional enforcement independent of the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] and police information systems and is coordinated by an information command center called the [[El Paso Intelligence Center]] (EPIC) near [[El Paso, Texas]].

=== Special Response Teams ===
[[File:Burning hashish seized in Operation Albatross.jpg|thumb|DEA agents burning hashish seized in Operation Albatross in Afghanistan, 2008.]]

Rapid Response Teams (RRT), previously known as Foreign-Deployed Advisory and Support Teams (FAST), were decommissioned by DEA Acting Administrator Chuck Rosenburg on March 2017 via memorandum.

DEA officially created and standardized its Special Response Team (SRT) program in 2016 to address higher risk tactical operations in the field. DEA mandates that each major domestic office maintains an operational Special Response Team. The SRT Certification Course (SCC) consists of 11 days of SRT Basic and five days of SRT Advanced at the U.S. Army base Fort A. P. Hill in Virginia. The SCC cadre are former operators from the DEA RRT's best and most seasoned agents. The training responsibility for the SRT was transferred to the DEA Office of Training to a newly created training unit with former members of RRT. The SCC course trains SRT candidates in team movement, high-risk entry, tactical weapons proficiency, and principles of dynamic operations.

Some of the SRT missions consist of high-risk arrests, vehicle assault, specialized surveillance, custody of high-profile individuals, dignitary and witness protection, tactical surveillance and interdiction, advanced breaching, tactical training to other police units, and urban and rural fugitive searches.

In the past, DEA had other tactical teams like the High-risk Entry Apprehension Teams (HEAT) in some Field Divisions, and Operation Snowcap Teams (predecessor of FAST). The teams administered by the Mobile Enforcement Section, the Mobile Enforcement Teams (MET), and Regional Enforcement Teams (RET), were mobile investigative units intended to deploy resources to state and local agencies (MET) or DEA Field Divisions (RET) in need of assistance with a particular investigation or trafficking group. These programs ended in the early 2000s.

=== Special Operations Division ===
The DEA Special Operations Division (SOD) is a division within the DEA, which forwards information from wiretaps, intercepts and databases from various sources to federal agents and local law enforcement officials. The SOD came under scrutiny following the [[2013 mass surveillance disclosures]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=How DEA program differs from recent NSA revelations|author=John Shiffman|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/08/05/us-dea-sod-nsa-idUSBRE9740AI20130805|agency=[[Reuters]]|date=August 5, 2013|accessdate=August 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Domestic Cannabis Eradication/Suppression Program ===
The Domestic Cannabis Eradication/Suppression Program (DCE/SP) began funding eradication programs in Hawaii and California in 1979. The program rapidly expanded to include programs in 25 states by 1982. By 1985, all 50 States were participating in the DCE/SP.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dea.gov/ops/cannabis.shtml|title=DEA / Cannabis Eradication|website=www.dea.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the DCE/SP was responsible for the eradication of 3,932,201 cultivated outdoor cannabis plants and 325,019 indoor plants for a total of 4,257,220 marijuana plants. In addition, the DCE/SP accounted for 6,278 arrests and the seizure in excess of $29.7 million of cultivator assets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dea.gov/ops/cannabis.shtml|title=DEA / Cannabis Eradication|website=www.dea.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the DEA spent $73,000 to eradicate marijuana plants in Utah, though they did not find a single marijuana plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/10/07/the-dea-spent-73000-to-eradicate-marijuana-plants-in-utah-it-didnt-find-any/|title=Analysis {{!}} The DEA spent $73,000 to eradicate marijuana plants in Utah.

== Budget ==
In FY 2018 the DEA budget was $2086.6 million&lt;ref&gt;https://www.justice.gov/jmd/page/file/1033151/download&lt;/ref&gt;. $445 million was spent on international enforcement and $1,627 million was spent on Domestic Enforcement.

* Breaking foreign and domestic sources of supply ($1.0149 billion) via domestic cannabis eradication/suppression; domestic enforcement; research, engineering, and technical operations; the Foreign Cooperative Investigations Program; intelligence operations ([[financial intelligence]], [[operational intelligence]], [[strategic intelligence]], and the [[El Paso Intelligence Center]]); and drug and chemical diversion control.
* Reduction of [[drug-related crime]] and violence ($181.8 million) funding state and local teams and mobile enforcement teams.
* [[Demand reduction]] ($3.3 million) via anti-[[Drug legalization|legalization]] education, training for law enforcement personnel, youth programs, support for community-based coalitions, and sports drug awareness programs.

==Firearms==
DEA agents' primary service weapons are the [[Glock 22]] and [[Glock 23]], Remington 870 12-gauge shotgun, and Rock River Arms LAR-15 semi-automatic carbine in 5.56×45mm NATO. Agents may also qualify to carry a firearm listed on an authorized carry list maintained and updated by the Firearms Training Unit (FTU), Quantico, VA.

Special Agents may qualify with their own personally-owned handguns, rifle, and shotgun, and certain handguns are allowed to be used with permission from the FTU. Agents are required to attend tactical and firearms proficiency training quarterly, and to qualify with their handguns twice per year. The DEA has one of the most challenging handgun qualification courses in all of federal law enforcement. Failure to achieve a passing qualification score is the reason for most Academy dismissals and special agents in the field may have their authority to carry a firearm revoked for failure to qualify.

Basic Agent Trainees (BATs) who fail the initial pistol qualification course of fire are placed in a remedial program to receive additional training. In remedial training, BATs receive five extra two-hour range sessions, for a total of 10 more hours of live fire training on their issued sidearm, in order to further aid them in helping pass the pistol qualification. After passing their pistol qualification, Basic Agent Trainees move on to receive formal training on the DEA's standard-issue long guns and will continue to frequently shoot their agency-issued sidearm that they have already qualified on. In all, BATs receive a total of 32 firearms training sessions, when combining classroom instruction, gear issue, and pistol, rifle, and shotgun live fire training at the DEA Academy. They will shoot the qualification courses for all three weapons systems during their initial training, but must pass their final qualification attempts only on their Glock pistols in order to become a Special Agent.

Trained to use shoulder-fired weapons, the Rock River LAR-15, adopted in 2004, and the [[LWRC M6|LWRC M6A2]] is the standard carbine of DEA. The [[Colt 9mm SMG]] was previously issued, but no longer in service. Agents are required to complete a two-day (16-hour) proficiency course in order to carry a shoulder weapon on enforcement operations. They may carry a Rock River LAR-15 or LWRC carbine as authorized, personally-owned weapons, provided they meet the same training and proficiency standards.

==Impact on the drug trade==

=== Registration and licensing ===
[[File:Deakhat.jpg|thumb|"[[Khat|Operation Somalia Express]]" was an 18-month investigation which included the coordinated takedown of a 44-member international narcotics-trafficking organization responsible for smuggling more than 25 tons of [[khat]] from the [[Horn of Africa]] to the United States.]]

The DEA has a registration system in place which authorizes anyone to manufacture, import, export, and distribute by filing [http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/drugreg/reg_apps/225/225_instruct.htm DEA form 225] along with medical professionals, researchers and manufacturers access to "[[Controlled Substances Act|Schedule I]]" drugs, as well as Schedules 2, 3, 4 and 5. Authorized registrants apply for and, if granted, receive a "[[DEA number]]". An entity that has been issued a DEA number is authorized to manufacture (drug companies), distribute, research, prescribe (doctors, [[pharmacist]]s, [[nurse practitioners]] and physician assistants, etc.) or dispense (pharmacy) a controlled substance.

=== Diversion control system ===
Many problems associated with [[drug abuse]] are the result of legitimately-manufactured controlled substances being diverted from their lawful purpose into the illicit drug traffic. Many of the analgesics, depressants and stimulants manufactured for legitimate medical use can often carry potential for dependence or abuse. Therefore, those scheduled substances have been brought under legal control for prevention and population safety. The goal of controls is to ensure that these "controlled substances" are readily available for medical use, while preventing their distribution for illicit distribution and non-medical use. This can be a difficult task, sometimes providing difficulty for legitimate patients and healthcare providers while circumventing illegal trade and consumption of scheduled drugs.

Under federal law, all businesses which manufacture or distribute controlled drugs, all health professionals entitled to dispense, administer or prescribe them, and all [[Pharmacy|pharmacies]] entitled to fill prescriptions must register with the DEA. Registrants must comply with a series of regulatory requirements relating to drug security, records accountability, and adherence to standards.

All of these investigations are conducted by [[Diversion Investigator]]s (DIs). DIs conduct investigations to uncover and investigate suspected sources of diversion and take appropriate civil and administrative actions. Prescription Database Management Programs (PDMP) aid and facilitate investigation and surveillance.

=== MDMA DEA scheduling overturn ===
In 1985 [[MDMA]] and its analogues were under review by the American government as a drug for potential of abuse. During this time, several public hearings on the new drug were held by the DEA. Based on all of the evidence and facts presented at the time, the DEA's administrative law judge did not see MDMA and its analogues as being of large concern and recommended that they be placed in Schedule III. The DEA administrator, expressing concern for abuse potential, overruled the recommendation and ruled that MDMA be put in Schedule I, the [[Controlled Substances Act]]'s most restrictive category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.drugtext.org/library/research/mdma/archive/15/default.htm |title=24 MDMA, Chorles S.

== Criticism ==
{{See also|Criticism of the United States government#Criticism of agencies}}
[[File:DEA badge.PNG|thumb|right|150px|Drug Enforcement Administration 25th Anniversary badge]]
The DEA has been criticized for placing highly restrictive schedules on a few drugs which researchers in the fields of [[pharmacology]] and medicine regard as having medical uses. Critics assert that some such decisions are motivated primarily by political factors stemming from the U.S. government's [[War on Drugs]], and that many benefits of such substances remain unrecognized due to the difficulty of conducting scientific research. A counterpoint to that criticism is that under the [[Controlled Substances Act]] it is the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|Department of Health and Human Services]] (through the [[Food and Drug Administration]] and the [[National Institute on Drug Abuse]]), not the DEA, which has the legal responsibility to make scientific and medical determinations with respect to drug scheduling; no drug can be scheduled if the Secretary of Health and Human Services recommends against it on a scientific or medical basis, and no drug can be placed in the most restrictive schedule ([[List of Schedule I drugs|Schedule I]]) if DHHS finds that the drug has an accepted medical use. [[Jon Gettman]]'s essay ''Science and the End of Marijuana Prohibition'' describes the DEA as "a fall guy to deflect responsibility from the key decision-makers" and opines, "HHS calls the shots when it comes to marijuana prohibition, and the cops at DEA and the general over at [[Office of National Drug Control Policy|ONDCP]] take the heat."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.millionmarijuanamarch.com/mmm1_047.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222202857/http://www.millionmarijuanamarch.com/mmm1_047.htm|date=February 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DEA is also criticized for focusing on the operations from which it can seize the most money,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|ssrn=959869 |title=Policing for Profit: The Drug War's Hidden Economic Agenda |publisher=Papers.ssrn.com |date=January 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; namely the [[organized crime|organized]] cross-border trafficking of [[marijuana]]. Some individuals contemplating the nature of the DEA's charter advise that, based on danger, the DEA should be most focused on cocaine. Others suggest that, based on [[opiate]] popularity, the DEA should focus much more on [[medical prescription|prescription]] opiates used recreationally, which critics contend comes first before users switch to heroin.

[[Medical practitioner|Practitioner]]s who legally prescribe medicine however must possess a valid DEA license. According to federal law the budget of the DEA Diversion Control Program is to be paid by these license fees. In 1984 a three-year license cost $25. In 2009 the fee for a three-year license was $551. Some have likened this approach to license fees unreasonable, "like making pilot licenses support the entire [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) budget."

===Costs===
The total budget of the DEA from 1972 to 2014, according to the agency website, was $50.6 billion. The agency had 11,055 employees in 2014. For the year 2014 the average cost per arrest made was $97,325.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dea.gov/about/history/staffing.shtml |title=DEA Staffing &amp; Budget |publisher=Justice.gov |accessdate=December 18, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150103090908/http://www.dea.gov/about/history/staffing.shtml |archivedate=January 3, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; criticize the very existence of the DEA and the War on Drugs as both hostile, and contrary, to the concept of [[civil liberties]] by arguing that anybody should be free to put any substance they choose into their own bodies for any reason, particularly when legal drugs such as alcohol, tobacco and [[prescription drug]]s are also open to abuse, and that any harm caused by a drug user or addict to the general public is a case of conflicting civil rights. Recurrently, billions of dollars are spent yearly, focusing largely on [[criminal law]] and [[demand reduction]] campaigns, which has resulted in the imprisonments of thousands of U.S. citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usdoj.gov/dea/pubs/pressrel/pr021099.htm |title=News from DEA, News Releases, 02/10/99 |publisher=Usdoj.gov |accessdate=August 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Demand for recreational drugs is somewhat static as the market for most illegal drugs has been saturated, forcing the cartels to expand their market to Europe and other areas than the United States.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} United States federal law registers cannabis as a Schedule I drug.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usdoj.gov/dea/pubs/scheduling.html |title=DEA, Drug Scheduling |publisher=Usdoj.gov |accessdate=August 31, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081020210309/http://www.usdoj.gov/dea/pubs/scheduling.html |archive-date=October 20, 2008 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some groups advocate legalization of certain controlled substances under the premise that doing so may reduce the volume of illicit trafficking and associated crime as well as yield a valuable tax source, although some of the results of drug legalization have raised doubt about some of these beliefs. For example, [[marijuana]] is now available as a [[palliative]] agent, in Canada, with a medical prescription. Yet 86% of Canadians with HIV/AIDS, eligible for a prescription, continue to obtain marijuana illegally (AIDS Care. 2007 Apr;19(4):500-6.) However, this could be due to the availability or quality of illegal cannabis compared to provisions by government sources. Bureaucratic impediments may also discourage patients from actually attempting to receive it from the government.

===Incarceration of Daniel Chong===
An April 2012 DEA raid on a California home led to the [[incarceration of Daniel Chong]] for several days under conditions of neglect. The 23-year-old student attending the [[University of California, San Diego]] was taken into custody along with eight other people when the DEA executed a raid on a suspected [[MDMA]] distribution operation at a residence that he was visiting to celebrate the April 20 cannabis "holiday" known as "[[420 (cannabis culture)|420]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Huus|first='Kari|title=Student's ordeal: How was Daniel Chong lost in DEA detention?|url=http://usnews.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/05/04/11527375-students-ordeal-how-was-daniel-chong-lost-in-dea-detention?|publisher=MSNBC|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120711132108/http://usnews.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/05/04/11527375-students-ordeal-how-was-daniel-chong-lost-in-dea-detention|archivedate=July 11, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Grieco"&gt;{{cite web|last=Grieco|first=Sarah|title=DEA Ignored all my Cries: Student|url=http://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/daniel-chong-ucsd-san-diego-dea-149758275.html|publisher=NBC San Diego}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lovett"&gt;{{cite news|last=Lovett|first=Ian|title=California Man's 'Drug Holiday' Becomes Four-Day Nightmare in Holding Cell|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/03/us/daniel-chong-left-for-days-in-holding-cell.html|work=The New York Times|date=May 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Chong, the DEA agents questioned him and told him that he could go home, one even offering him a ride home, but instead he was transferred to a holding cell and confined for five days without any food or water, although Chong said he ingested a powdery substance that was left for him, which was later found to be methamphetamine.&lt;ref name="Grieco"/&gt; After five days and two suicide attempts, DEA agents found Chong.

On January 24, 2013, Headley, then 52 years old, was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Harry Leinenweber of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois in Chicago to 35 years in prison for his part in the 2008 Mumbai attacks, in which at least 164 victims (civilians and security personnel) and nine attackers were killed.

The DEA was accused in 2005 by the [[Venezuela]]n [[Government of Venezuela|government]] of collaborating with drug traffickers, after which President [[Hugo Chávez]] decided to end any collaboration with the agency. In 2007, after the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] criticized Venezuela in its annual report on drug trafficking, the Venezuelan Minister of Justice reiterated the accusations: "A large quantity of drug shipments left the country through that organization.We were in the presence of a new [[drug cartel]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In his 1996 series of articles and subsequent 1999 book, both titled [[Dark Alliance]], journalist Gary Webb asserts that the DEA helped harbor Nicaraguan drug traffickers. Notably, they allowed [[Oscar Danilo Blandón]] political asylum in the USA despite knowledge of his cocaine trafficking organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Webb|first=Gary|year=1999|pp=177|title=Dark Alliance|publisher=Seven Stories Press|isbn=978-1-888363-93-7|ref=harv|title-link=Dark Alliance}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government of [[Bolivia]] has also taken similar steps to ban the DEA from operating in the country. In September 2008, Bolivia drastically reduced diplomatic ties with the United States, withdrawing its ambassador from the US and expelling the US ambassador from Bolivia. This occurred soon after Bolivian president [[Evo Morales]] expelled all DEA agents from the country due to a revolt in the traditional coca-growing [[Chapare Province]]. The Bolivian government claimed that it could not protect the agents, and Morales further accused the agency of helping incite the violence, which claimed 30 lives. National agencies were to take over control of drug management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2008-11-01/world/bolivia.dea_1_bolivian-government-autonomy-movement-chapare?_s=PM:WORLD|title=Morales: Government will take over for DEA in Bolivia|date=November 1, 2008|publisher=CNN|accessdate=November 2, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121005171533/http://articles.cnn.com/2008-11-01/world/bolivia.dea_1_bolivian-government-autonomy-movement-chapare?_s=PM%3AWORLD|archivedate=October 5, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three years later, Bolivia and the US began to restore full diplomatic ties. However, Morales maintained that the DEA would remain unwelcome in the country, characterising it as an affront to Bolivia's "dignity and sovereignty".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-15649399|title=Bolivia's Morales insists no return for US drug agency|date=November 8, 2011|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=November 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Netherlands, both the Dutch government and the DEA have been criticized for violations of Dutch sovereignty in drug investigations. According to [[Peter R. de Vries]], a Dutch journalist present at the 2005 trial of Henk Orlando Rommy, the DEA has admitted to activities on Dutch soil. Earlier, then Minister of Justice [[Piet Hein Donner]], had denied to the [[States General of the Netherlands|Dutch parliament]] that he had given permission to the DEA for any such activities, which would have been a requirement by Dutch law in order to allow foreign agents to act within the territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Special Operations Division fabricated evidence trails===
In 2013 ''[[Reuters]]'' published a report about the DEA's Special Operations Division (SOD) stating that it conceals where an investigative trail about a suspect truly originates from and [[Parallel construction|creates a parallel set of evidence]] given to prosecutors, judges, and defense lawyers. This DEA program mainly affects common criminals such as drug dealers. The concealment of evidence means the defendant is unaware of how his or her investigation began and will be unable to request a review possible sources of exculpatory evidence. Exculpatory evidence may include biased witnesses, mistakes, or entrapment. Nancy Gertner, a former federal judge who had served from 1994 to 2011 and a [[Harvard Law School]] professor, stated that "It is one thing to create special rules for national security. Ordinary crime is entirely different. It sounds like they are phonying up investigations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=John|last1=Shiffman|first2=Kristina|last2=Cooke|title=Exclusive: U.S. directs agents to cover up program used to investigate Americans|date=Aug 5, 2013|publisher=[[Reuters]]|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/08/05/us-dea-sod-idUSBRE97409R20130805|accessdate=Jun 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andrew O'Hehir of ''[[Salon (magazine)|Salon]]'' wrote that "It’s the first clear evidence that the “special rules” and disregard for constitutional law that have characterized the hunt for so-called terrorists have crept into the domestic criminal justice system on a significant scale."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=O'Hehir|first=Andrew|title=The NSA-DEA police state tango|date=August 10, 2013|publisher=[[Salon (magazine)|Salon]]|url=http://www.salon.com/2013/08/10/the_nsa_dea_police_state_tango/|accessdate=June 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cannabis rescheduling===
A 2014 report by the [[Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies]] and the [[Drug Policy Alliance]] accuses the DEA of unfairly blocking the [[Removal of cannabis from Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act|removal of cannabis]] from [[List of Schedule I drugs (US)|Schedule I]]. The report alleges that the methods employed by the DEA to achieve this include: delaying rescheduling petitions for years, [[Removal of cannabis from Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act#1972 petition|overruling DEA administrative law judges]], and systematically impeding scientific research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The DEA: Four Decades of Impeding And Rejecting Science|url=http://www.drugpolicy.org/resource/dea-four-decades-impeding-and-rejecting-science|publisher=DPA, MAPS|accessdate=14 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DEA continues to refuse the removal of cannabis from Schedule I despite wide-scale acceptance of the substance among the medical community, including 76% of doctors, for the [[Medical cannabis|treatment of various disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grotenhermen|first1=F|last2=Müller-Vahl|first2=K|title=The therapeutic potential of cannabis and cannabinoids.|journal=Deutsches Arzteblatt International|date=Jul 2012|volume=109|issue=29–30|pages=495–501|pmid=23008748|doi=10.3238/arztebl.2012.0495|pmc=3442177}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pamplona|first1=FA|last2=Takahashi|first2=RN|title=Psychopharmacology of the endocannabinoids: far beyond anandamide.|journal=Journal of Psychopharmacology (Oxford, England)|date=Jan 2012|volume=26|issue=1|pages=7–22|pmid=21652605|doi=10.1177/0269881111405357}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Adler|first1=Jonathan N.|last2=Colbert|first2=James A.|title=Medicinal Use of Marijuana — Polling Results|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|date=30 May 2013|volume=368|issue=22|pages=e30|doi=10.1056/NEJMclde1305159|pmid=23718175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Domestic anti-drug advocacy===
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2015}}
The DEA, in addition to enforcement, also regularly engage in advocacy, specifically against rescheduling marijuana, by publishing policy-based papers on certain drugs. Some{{who|date=September 2015}}have criticized the DEA for using tax dollars in what they call an attempt to change public opinion, which they call an overreach from the scope of the agency's job of enforcement, and that by releasing such non-peer-reviewed reports is a transparent attempt to justify its own activities. They have claimed that since the DEA is not, by law, an advocacy group, but a legal enforcement group, that those press releases are tantamount to what they consider domestic propaganda.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

The DEA has taken a particularly strong stance on enforcement of the Controlled Substances Act on persons and organizations acting within state laws that allow [[medical cannabis]] cultivation and distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/01/18/national/main2369758.shtml |title=Feds Raid 11 Medical Marijuana Clinics, DEA Does Not Recognize California Law legalizing medical use of pot |publisher=CBS News |accessdate=August 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; DEA agency executive, Chuck Rosenberg has made negative statements against patients who use medical marijuana.  Chuck Rosenberg has mentioned that he considers medical marijuana to be a "joke."  As a reaction against the negative statements made by Chuck Rosenberg towards medical marijuana, an international online petition has been formed. More than 159,737 signatures have been gathered globally with the intention that Chuck Rosenberg will be fired or forced to resign as head of DEA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rough|first1=Lisa|title=Petition to Fire DEA Chief Gains Traction|url=https://www.leafly.com/news/politics/petition-to-fire-dea-chief-gains-traction|accessdate=June 12, 2017|work=Leafly|date=November 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"The people of California and the County of Santa Cruz have overwhelmingly supported the provision of [[medical marijuana]] for people who have serious illnesses," county Supervisor [[Mardi Wormhoudt]] told the ''[[San Francisco Gate]]''. "These people (blocking the road) are people with AIDS and cancer and other grave illnesses. To attack these people, who work collectively and have never taken money for their work, is outrageous."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stopthedrugwar.org/chronicle-old/441/hincheyvote.shtml |title=Feature: Move to Block DEA Medical Marijuana Raids Heads for House Floor Vote Next Week |publisher=Stopthedrugwar.org |accessdate=August 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2002/09/06/MN212302.DTL&amp;type=printable |title=Santa Cruz officials fume over medical pot club bust / DEA arrests founders, confiscates plants |work=San Francisco Chronicle |date=September 6, 2002 |accessdate=August 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, the Wo/Men's Alliance for Medical Marijuana, with the City and County of Santa Cruz, had sued the DEA, Attorney General [[Michael Mukasey]], and the [[ONDCP]]. The most recent court decision rejected the government's motion to dismiss, which allowed discovery to move forward. The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] hailed the decision as "a first-of-its-kind ruling."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aclu.org/drugpolicy/medmarijuana/36496prs20080820.html |title=Federal Court Rules U.S. Government May Not Deliberately Subvert California's Medical Marijuana Laws |publisher=American Civil Liberties Union|date=August 20, 2008 |accessdate=August 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, the DEA has escalated its enforcement efforts on the recently proliferated Los Angeles area medical cannabis collectives. On July 25, 2007, the DEA raided the California Patients Group, Hollywood Compassionate Collective, and Natural Hybrid (NHI Caregivers) in Hollywood, California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lee|first1=Martin|title=An Industry Emerges: The Rise of Medical Marijuana|url=http://realitysandwich.com/161557/industry_emerges/|website=Reality Sandwich|accessdate=1 October 2014|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier that day, the operators of those collectives participated in a press conference with LA City Council members announcing the City's intention to regulate the collectives and asking the DEA to halt raids on collectives while the City drafted regulations.{{citation needed|date=October 2010}} The dispensary operator of Natural Hybrid (NHI Caregivers) was forced to close down the collective due to the tremendous loss caused by the DEA conducted joint task force raid against them.{{citation needed|date=October 2010}}

== Project Cassandra ==

In 2008 the Special Operations part of the agency launched a multi-agency effort named [[Project Cassandra]]&lt;ref&gt;Meyer, Josh. (18 December 2017). "The secret backstory of how Obama let Hezbollah off the hook". [https://www.politico.com/interactives/2017/obama-hezbollah-drug-trafficking-investigation/ Politico website] Retrieved 24 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; to investigate the Iranian-backed terrorist group [[Hezbollah]] for illicit drug trafficking and terrorist financing. The investigation identified an Iranian cell in the U.S. which worked in concert with a Lebanese bank called the Lebanese Canadian Bank to launder money using the purchase of used automobiles exported to Africa. Project Cassandra also identified hemispheric drug syndicates involved in cocaine trafficking in order to finance Hezbollah terrorism. The Department of Justice issued several sealed indictments, but declined to seize, prosecute, extradite, or further investigate likely targets of these alleged foreign criminal activities operating in the United States due to White House diplomatic objectives involving the international nuclear agreement with Iran.&lt;ref&gt;Meyer, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; On December 22, 2017, the Attorney General [[Jeff Sessions]] ordered a review of prior cases in the project.&lt;ref&gt;Hacohen, Hagay and Wilner, Michael.

In 1999, the DEA opened the Drug Enforcement Administration Museum in [[Arlington, Virginia]]. The original permanent exhibit – Illegal Drugs in America: A Modern History – remains the museum's centerpiece.  The exhibit features "the more than 150 year history of drugs and drug abuse and the DEA," including a considerable collection of drug paraphernalia and an image of a smiling drug vendor under the heading "Jimmy's Joint".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deamuseum.org/ida/index.html|title=Illegal Drugs in America, a Modern History|publisher=DEA Museum Website|accessdate=February 27, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111024173130/http://www.deamuseum.org/ida/index.html|archivedate=October 24, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Edict of Beaulieu''' (also known at the time as the '''Peace of Monsieur''') was promulgated from [[Beaulieu-lès-Loches]]&lt;ref&gt;Beaulieu lies directly across the [[Indre River|Indre]] from [[Loches]].&lt;/ref&gt; on 6 May 1576&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Miquel, p. 314.&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Henry III of France]], who was pressured by [[François, Duke of Anjou|Alençon]]'s support of the [[Protestant]] army besieging Paris that spring. 

The Edict, which was negotiated by the king's brother, ''Monsieur''— [[François, Duke of Anjou|François, duc d'Alençon]], who was now made duc d'Anjou—&lt;ref&gt;"...it was thought that the most important thing was to appease the duke of Alençon, " [[Jacques-Auguste de Thou]] remarked in his ''Histoire universelle'', based on notes he had been accumulating. "Thus his apanage was augmented with the three richest provinces in the kingdom: Berry, Touraine and Anjou." (Quoted by Mack P. Holt, "The King in Parlement: The Problem of the Lit de Justice in Sixteenth-Century France" ''The Historical Journal'' '''31'''.3 [September 1988:507-523] p. 310).&lt;/ref&gt; gave [[Huguenot]]s the right of public worship for their religion, thenceforth officially called the ''religion prétendue réformée'' ("supposed reformed religion"), throughout France, except at Paris and at Court. In eight [[parlement]]s there were also to be established chambers, called the ''mi-partis'' because they were composed of equal numbers of [[Catholic]]s and Huguenots; eight ''places de sûreté'' were to be given to the Huguenots; there was to be a disclaimer of the [[Massacre of St. Bartholomew]], and the families which had suffered from it were to be reinstated. These large concessions to the Huguenots and the approbation given to their political organization led to the formation of the [[Catholic League (French)|Catholic League]], which was organized by Catholics anxious to defend their religion. 

The King held a ''[[lit de justice]]'' in the [[Parlement of Paris]] on 14 May to subvent pending opposition in the strongly Catholic ''parlement''&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre de l'Estoile]] recorded in his diary "This was so odious to the Court, that if the King had not come there in person, it would never have been published" (Quoted Holt 1988:511).&lt;/ref&gt; and to ensure that the Edict was duly inscribed.&lt;ref&gt;According to the papal nuncio, Antonio Maria Salviati, "La corte non voleva emologare le lettere, ma il Re in persona vi è andato..." Holt 1988, ''eo. loc.''.&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1576, however, the States-General of Blois declared itself against the Edict of Beaulieu. Thereupon the Protestants took up arms under the leadership of [[Henry of Navarre]], who, escaping from the Court, had returned to the [[Calvinism]] which he had abjured at the time of the Massacre of St. Bartholomew. The advantage was on the Catholic side, thanks to some successes achieved by the [[François, Duke of Anjou|duc d'Anjou]]. In September 1577, the [[Treaty of Bergerac]], confirmed by the [[Edict of Poitiers]], left the Huguenots the free exercise of their religion only in the [[suburb]]s of one town in each [[bailiwick]] (''bailliage''), and in those places where it had been practiced before the outbreak of hostilities and which they occupied at the current date.

[[File:Without breaking stride, homeward bound commuter as the Staten Island Ferry Terminal reaches for leaflet from street... - NARA - 549907.jpg|thumb|upright|Leaflets being handed out in [[New York City]] (1973)]]
[[File:Flyers sobe 2.jpg|thumb|upright|Hundreds of flyers litter the streets in [[South Beach]], [[Miami]].  Scenes like these are not uncommon in cities known for their [[Nightlife (activity)|nightlife]]]]
[[File:Helmand leaflets350.jpg|thumb|[[Airborne leaflet propaganda|Distribution of leaflets]] over [[Afghanistan]] by the U.S. military in 2010]]
[[File:Flyers in China 02.jpg|thumb|Flyers pasted to a wall in [[Haikou]], [[Hainan]] Province, [[People's Republic of China|China]]]]

A '''flyer''' is a form of [[paper]] [[advertisement]] intended for wide distribution and typically posted or distributed in a public place, handed out to individuals or sent through the mail. In the 2010s, flyers range from inexpensively [[photocopier|photocopied]] leaflets to expensive, glossy, full-color circulars.

==Terminology==
A flyer is also called a "flier", "circular", "handbill", "[[pamphlet]]", "poster", "lit'" (literature), "weekly ad", "catalogue" or "leaflet".{{cn|date=April 2017}}

==Usage==
Flyers may be used by individuals, [[business]]es, not-for-profit organizations or governments to:
* Advertise an event such as a music [[concert]], [[nightclub]] appearance, [[festival]], or political [[Demonstration (people)|rally]]
* Promote a [[Good (economics)|good]]s-selling businesses such as a [[used car]] lot [[discount store]] or a [[Service (economics)|service]] business such as a [[restaurant]] or [[massage parlour]].
* Persuade people about a social, religious, or political message, as in [[evangelism]] or [[political campaign]] activities on behalf of a [[political party]] or candidate during an election. Flyers have been used in armed conflict: for example, [[airborne leaflet propaganda]] has been a tactic of [[psychological warfare]].
* Recruit members for organizations or companies.

Like [[postcard]]s, [[pamphlet]]s and small [[poster]]s, flyers are a low-cost form of [[mass marketing]] or [[communication]]. There are many different flyer formats. Some examples include:
* [[ISO 216#A series|A4]] (roughly [[letterhead]] size)
* A5 (roughly half letterhead size)
* DL ([[compliments slip]] size)
* A6 ([[postcard]] size)

[[File:Commonsense.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Common Sense (pamphlet)|''Common Sense'']] was a pamphlet that was distributed preceding the American Revolution]]
Flyers are inexpensive to produce and they required only a basic [[printing press]] from the 18th century to the 20th century. Their widespread use intensified in the 1990s with the spread of less expensive [[desktop publishing]] systems. In the 2010s, inexpensive black and white flyers can be produced with just a [[personal computer]] and a [[computer printer]]. In the 2010s, the ordering of flyers through traditional printing services has been supplanted by [[Internet]] services. Customers send designs, review proofs online or via e-mail and receive the final products by mail.

Flyers are not a new medium: prior to the [[War of American Independence]] some colonists were outraged with the [[Stamp Act (1765)]] and gathered together in anti-stamp act congresses and meetings. In these congresses they had to win support, and issued handbills and leaflets, pamphlets, along with other written paraphernalia, to do so.

In the 2000s, some jurisdictions have laws or [[Local ordinance|ordinances]] banning or restricting leafleting or flyering in certain locations. Owners of private property may put up signs saying "Post No Bills"; this occurs particularly on wooden fences surrounding building sites or vacant lots.

==Distribution and use==
Flyers are handed out on the [[street]] (a practice known as "flyering" or "leafleting"), distributed door-to-door through the mail, posted on [[bulletin board]]s, put under windshield wipers of cars, given away at events or on the street, or affixed to telephone poles, walls, or other surfaces. Bulletin boards are found on [[college campus]]es, in [[café]]s, community meeting houses, [[laundromat]]s and small markets. Cheap to produce, contemporary flyers are frequently produced in 300&amp;nbsp;[[paper density|g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]] glossy card, whereas a leaflet might be produced on a 130&amp;nbsp;g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;–170&amp;nbsp;g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; weight paper and can be a very effective form of [[direct marketing]].

In the 2010s, some individuals and organizations send flyers through [[e-mail]], a tactic that avoids spending money on paper, printing and mailing or hiring people to post the flyers on telephone poles or hand them out. The electronic [http://www.chapmatin.com/%da%86%d8%a7%d9%be-%d8%aa%d8%b1%d8%a7%da%a9%d8%aa/ flyer] may be embedded into the body of the e-mail or added as an attachment to be opened.

Ultimately, the sailing did not take place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=JTA |date=1 July 2011 |title=Flotilla delayed until next week |url=http://www.jewishjournal.com/israel/article/flotilla_delayed_until_next_week_20110701/ |work=Jewish Journal |accessdate=2 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The flotilla was organized by a coalition of 22 NGOs.  Its name refers to the May 2010 [[Gaza Flotilla Raid|Gaza Freedom Flotilla]]. Their stated goal was to end the blockade of Gaza "completely and permanently".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |date=18 June 2011 |url=http://www.freedomflotilla.eu/en/information/3-freedomflotilla-announcements/129-press-release-from-istanbul |title=Press Release from Istanbul |publisher=Freedomflotilla.eu |accessdate=1 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110625001123/http://freedomflotilla.eu/en/information/3-freedomflotilla-announcements/129-press-release-from-istanbul |archivedate=25 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, 10 ships, with 1,000 activists&lt;ref name="AJN_24Jun2011a"/&gt; were set to sail for Gaza, but by 28 June 2011, the [[List of participants of Freedom Flotilla II|number of expected participants]] had decreased to fewer than 300, plus a few dozen journalists, and by 7 July all but a few dozen activists had returned home.&lt;ref name="Katz-2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Magnezi-28-June-2011"&gt;{{cite news |last=Magnezi |first=Aviel |date=28 June 2011 |title=Fewer than 300 join flotilla |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4088464,00.html |work=Ynetnews |location=Tel Aviv |accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The flotilla was publicly opposed by the United States, France, the United Kingdom, Turkey, Canada, the [[Middle East Quartet]] (consisting of the [[European Union]], Russia, the United Nations, and the United States), and [[United Nations Secretary General]] [[Ban Ki-moon]]. It was publicly supported by [[Hamas]].&lt;ref name="cbc.ca"&gt;{{cite news |date=2 July 2011 |title=Gaza-bound activists vow to complete trek |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/story/2011/07/03/gaza-flotilla.html |work=CBC World News |accessdate=2 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Activists on two ships, one in Greece and one in Turkey, found similar damage to their propeller shafts, and claimed that the ships had been sabotaged by Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/israel-also-sabotaged-irish-ship-say-gaza-flotilla-organizers-1.370434
|title=Israel also sabotaged Irish ship, say Gaza flotilla organizers
|work=Haaretz |location=Israel|accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was reported that the investigation by Turkish authorities on one of the ships determined that there may have been no sabotage at all, and that any damage happened before the boat arrived in Turkey, but these media reports appeared prior to the formal investigation beginning and the Turkish coastguard enquiry has yet to announce its findings. The media reports were disputed by Irish Ship to Gaza, the owner of the vessel.&lt;ref name="apgreece"/&gt;&lt;ref name="greece_blocks_boat"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=4 July 2011 |title=Sabotage of MV Saoirse |url=http://irishshiptogaza.org/?p=746 |work=Blog archive |publisher=Irish Ship to Gaza |accessdate=5 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707062019/http://irishshiptogaza.org/?p=746 |archivedate=7 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Greece forbade the vessels from leaving its ports, citing safety concerns,&lt;ref name="greek"/&gt; but offered to instead send any humanitarian aid to Gaza in its own vessels, under United Nations supervision. Greece's offer was supported by Israel, the Palestinian Authority, and the United Nations, but rejected by the flotilla activists.&lt;ref name="voareject"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bill"/&gt; Subsequently, two flotilla ships, the ''Audacity of Hope'' and ''Tahrir'', disobeyed Greece's orders.  They were intercepted by the Greek coast guard, brought back to shore, and a few activists were arrested. Activists responded by occupying the Spanish embassy in Athens.&lt;ref name="sunk"/&gt;

Only the French ship ''Dignité Al Karama'' managed to approach Gaza. They advised the Greek authorities that their destination was the Egyptian port of [[Alexandria]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://alethonews.wordpress.com/2011/07/18/dignite-al-karama-sailing-to-gaza/ |title=Dignité-Al Karama sailing to Gaza |work=Aletho News |date=18 July 2011 |accessdate=22 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then turned toward Gaza.&lt;ref name="AlJazeera-2011-07-18"/&gt; On 19 July, the ship was intercepted and boarded without incident by Israeli commandos and escorted to the Israeli port of [[Ashdod]].&lt;ref name="BBC-2011-07-19"/&gt;

==Background==
[[Image:Gazaseablocade.png|thumb|250px|Gaza Strip naval blockade area, as published by Israel's Ministry of Transport]]
After the 2007, [[Fatah-Hamas conflict]], Israel and Egypt closed off their respective borders with Gaza, preventing most goods and nearly all people from going in and out.&lt;ref name="NYT_16June2011a"/&gt;

At the end of May 2010 a flotilla of six ships left from Turkey towards the Gaza Strip. The main purpose of the flotilla, according to its organizers, was to bring humanitarian supplies to the Gaza Strip. On 31 May 2010 the [[Gaza flotilla raid|Israeli navy raided the ships]] some 40 kilometres away from Gaza shores. During the takeover, a violent confrontation occurred in which nine activists were killed on one of the ships and several Israeli soldiers were injured as well as dozens of passengers from several ships. At the end of the operation the ships were seized by the Israeli navy and taken to the port of Ashdod.

Following the 2010 Gaza flotilla raid, international outrage contributed to a shift in Israeli policy. Both Israel and Egypt eased their blockade, letting in more goods over land.&lt;ref name="NYT_16June2011a"/&gt; In June 2010 Egypt decided to open the land crossings between Egypt and the Gaza Strip in order to transfer a minimal amount of supplies.

After the events of the 2011 flotilla raid, organizations from several countries declared their intention to send more ships to break the blockade on Gaza. As a result, the Israeli government announced that the any ships attempting to break the blockade of the Gaza Strip would be arrested.

Opinions on the [[Legal assessments of the Gaza flotilla raid#Legality of blockade|legality]] of Israel's blockade of the Gaza strip, as well as on the use of force in international waters to maintain the blockade, are divided.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost1"&gt;{{cite news |last=Lynch |first=Colum |date=1 June 2010 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/06/01/AR2010060102934.html?hpid=topnews |title=Israel's flotilla raid revives questions of international law |work=The Washington Post |accessdate=2 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Hirsch |first=Afua |date=1 June 2010 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/law/afua-hirsch-law-blog/2010/jun/01/gaza-freedom-flotilla-international-law |title=Was the Gaza Flotilla Raid Illegal? |work=The Guardian  |location=London |accessdate=2 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 July 2011, the Greek government offered to bring humanitarian aid to Gaza themselves, but Greece's offer was turned down by the activists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Katz |first=Yaakov |date=4 July 2011 |title=Activists reject Greek offer to send flotilla aid |url=http://www.jpost.com/International/Article.aspx?id=227783 |work=Jerusalem Post |accessdate=7 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==

===Name===
The flotilla was named in memory of [[Vittorio Arrigoni]], an Italian reporter and activist whose killing by suspected members of a Palestinian [[Salafist jihadism|Salafist]] group in Gaza in April 2011 "left the Palestinian activist community stunned." His favourite expression was "Stay Human".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Schwartz |first=Susan |date=2 June 2011 |title=The Stay Human Flotilla to Gaza |url=http://muslimmedianetwork.com/mmn/?p=8577 |location=Farmington, MI |work=Muslim Observer |accessdate=26 June 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002214756/http://muslimmedianetwork.com/mmn/?p=8577 |deadurl=no |archivedate=2 October 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ships===
Originally it was thought that the [[MV Mavi Marmara|MV ''Mavi Marmara'']] would lead the flotilla, but in mid-June, IHH announced that the ship would be unable to sail due to technical issues.&lt;ref name="NYT_17June2011a"&gt;{{cite news |last=Arsu |first=Sebnem |date=17 June 2011 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/18/world/europe/18briefs-Turkey.html |title=Turkey: Aid Ship Won't Join Flotilla |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 10 July 2011, the following ships had planned on sailing to reach Gaza:&lt;ref name="Hass-2011"/&gt;

==Events==

===Preparations===
The IHH announced plans for the new flotilla, again led by the MV ''Mavi Marmara'' to depart for Gaza in June 2011. IHH President [[Fehmi Bülent Yıldırım]] said "Even if we sacrifice shahids (martyrs) for this cause, we will be on the side of justice."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Magnezi |first=Aviel |date=18 May 2011 |title=IHH: Mavi Marmara ready for next flotilla |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4070717,00.html |work=Ynetnews |location=Tel Aviv |accessdate=18 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2011, the IHH conveyed a message to the Israeli government through Turkish Jews that the organization was not interested in another clash with Israel, and a proposal that the ships be inspected in a third-party country, such as Cyprus, before being allowed into Gaza.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Eichner |first=Itamar |date=14 June 2011 |title=IHH sends 'no violence' message to Israel |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4081829,00.html |work=Ynetnews |location=Tel Aviv |accessdate=18 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plans for the new flotilla were met with international opposition. United Nations Secretary-General [[Ban Ki-moon]] urged Mediterranean governments to discourage the new flotilla and send aid through "legitimate crossings and established channels",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author=Reuters |date=27 May 2010 |title=UN chief: Discourage new Gaza flotilla |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4074876,00.html |work=Ynetnews |location=Tel Aviv |accessdate=18 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the United States warned against the flotilla reportedly considered asking Turkey to host a peace summit between Israel and the [[Palestinian National Authority|Palestinian Authority]] provided that it stop it,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author=Ynet |title=US: Peace summit instead of flotilla |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4077939,00.html |work=Ynetnews |location=Tel Aviv |date=3 June 2011 |accessdate=24 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Canada warned its nationals not to participate in the flotilla and called it "provocative".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author=AFP |date=30 May 2011 |title=Canada warns citizens: Avoid Gaza flotilla |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4076037,00.html |work=Ynetnews |location=Tel Aviv |accessdate=18 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turkey urged activists to reconsider the need for a flotilla in light of the newly opened [[Rafah crossing]], but also urged Israel to act wisely and avoid past mistakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Greenberg |first=Hanan |date=15 June 2011 |title=Navy gears for Turkish flotilla  |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4082355,00.html |work=Ynetnews |location=Tel Aviv |accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several Dutch journalists who were due to travel in the flotilla backed out in late June, accusing the organizers of non-transparency, particularly with regard to their relations with [[Hamas]], restrictiveness, dishonesty and "shocking" gullibility. Journalist Eric Beauchemin said, "never have I seen a more closed organization. When we would ask critical questions they would accuse us of being unprofessional. Restrictions were imposed on us that hadn't been agreed upon beforehand."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=van de Poll  |first=Wilfred |date=29 June 2011 |url=http://www.trouw.nl/tr/nl/4492/Nederland/article/detail/2459749/2011/06/29/Pers-vertrouwt-Gazaboot-niet.dhtml |title=Pers vertrouwt Gazaboot niet |language=Dutch |work=Trouw.nl |accessdate=10 July 2011 |postscript=;}} translated in {{cite web |url=http://www.ngo-monitor.org/article.php?viewall=yes&amp;id=3433 |title=Press doesn't trust Gaza-boat |work=[[NGO Monitor]] |date=30 June 2011 |accessdate=10 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, a ship purchased for the flotilla was prevented from sailing after being denied permission to dock in [[Marseille]]. The move followed intense political pressure by the Jewish community on members of [[Parliament of France|Parliament]], political parties, and organizations, which in turn pressured insurance companies and authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Medzini |first=Ronen |date=15 June 2011 |title=French flotilla ship won't sail |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4082772,00.html |work=Ynetnews |location=Tel Aviv |accessdate=18 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A day before, the IHH had announced that was rethinking its participation in the flotilla and might withdraw from the initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Magnezi |first=Aviel |date=15 June 2011 |title=IHH may not take part in flotilla |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4082482,00.html |work=Ynetnews |location=Tel Aviv |accessdate=18 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 June, İHH announced that they are still part of the flotilla movement, though the ''Mavi Marmara'' pulled out from the flotilla because, according to Yıldırım, president of IHH, "after the damage caused to the ''Mavi Marmara'' [last year], we are not in a position to go to sea".&lt;ref name="ihhff2"&gt;{{cite web |title=Freedom Flotilla II to go ahead as planned |url=http://www.ihh.org.tr/ii-ozgurluk-filosu-yoluna-devam-ediyor/en/ |location=Istanbul |publisher=IHH |accessdate=26 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110627181353/http://www.ihh.org.tr/ii-ozgurluk-filosu-yoluna-devam-ediyor/en/ |archivedate=27 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;br /&gt;• {{cite news|last=Buck|first=Tobias|title=Turkish flagship pulls out of Gaza flotilla|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/ec4ab2dc-98eb-11e0-bd66-00144feab49a.html#axzz1RE42WnpH|accessdate=5 July 2011|newspaper=The Financial Times|date=17 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Initial leg===
Two of the vessels taking part in the flotilla set sail from the French island of [[Corsica]] to Greece, to meet up with the other vessels. The vessels docked in [[Piraeus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ya'ar |first=Chana |date=26 June 2011 |url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/145187 |title=Flotilla Vessels Sail from France |work=Arutz Sheva |accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the French vessel ''Dignité&amp;nbsp;– Al Karama'' did not dock, and proceeded directly towards the Gaza Strip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Magnezi |first=Aviel |date=29 June 2011 |title=Gaza-bound flotilla underway |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4088843,00.html |work=Ynetnews |location=Tel Aviv |accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vessels damaged===
On 27 June 2011, activists announced that they had discovered damage to two of the vessels, the ''Juliano'' and MV ''Saoirse''. Both the vessels had their propellers and pipes leading to their engines damaged. According to Flotilla spokesman [[Dror Feiler]], there was no direct evidence Israel was involved,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Keinon |first1=Kerb |last2=Katz |first2=Yaakov |date=30 June 2011 |title='Damaged Irish ship won't join flotilla after sabotage' |url=http://www.jpost.com/DiplomacyAndPolitics/Article.aspx?id=227274 |work=Jerusalem Post |accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he estimated the damage would take several days to repair. Other flotilla organizers suspected that the damage was the result of a sabotage operation by Israeli naval divers, and demanded that the Greek police and port authorities provide security for the vessels. Some activists announced that they themselves planned to guard the vessels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Pfeffer |first=Anshel |date=29 June 2011 |title=Gaza flotilla organizers demand Greek police provide security for ships |url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/gaza-flotilla-organizers-demand-greek-police-provide-security-for-ships-1.370132 |work=Haaretz |accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;br /&gt;• {{cite news |last=Magnezi |first=Aviel |date=28 June 2011 |title=Organizers: Israeli divers harmed flotilla ship |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4088583,00.html |work=Ynetnews |location=Tel Aviv |accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 June, the MV ''Saoirse'' sustained damage while docked in Turkey. Activists claimed that the damage was caused by Israeli divers, who were able to avoid detection by guards stationed on the vessel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Magnezi |first=Aviel |date=30 June 2011 |title=Activists: Israel sabotaged Irish vessel too |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4089151,00.html |work=Ynetnews |location=Tel Aviv |accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of passengers on the flotilla said they had been mugged on the streets near the port and had mobile phones stolen, and that suspicious "fishermen" had been sighted near the ships, loitering without bait or buckets, by waters that are known to be contaminated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author1=Haaretz |last2=Hass |first2=Amira |date=30 June 2011 |title=Israel also sabotaged Irish ship, say Gaza flotilla organizers |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/israel-also-sabotaged-irish-ship-say-gaza-flotilla-organizers-1.370434 |work=Haaretz |accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Israel flatly rejected the accusations as "paranoid" and accused the activists of "living in a [[James Bond]] film."&lt;ref name="greek"/&gt;

Selcuk Unal, a spokesman for the Turkish Foreign Ministry, said that an investigation by Turkish authorities determined that there was no act of sabotage on the Irish ship, which had been docked in the Turkish port of Gocek.&lt;ref name="apgreece"/&gt; These claims have been disputed by Activists who called for an independent investigation into how the MV ''Saoirse'' was damaged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.breakingnews.ie/ireland/irish-group-doubts-independence-of-aid-ship-sabotage-probe-511344.html

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the damage, the MV ''Saoirse's'' plans to join the flotilla were cancelled but several Irish activists went to Corfu to join the Italian/Dutch ship, the MV ''Stefano Chiarini''.

The Irish Ship to Gaza campaign later repaired the MV ''Saoirse'' and in November 2011, joined by the Canadian ship, the MV ''Tahrir'', it slipped out of Turkey and sailed for Gaza. This sailing was called the "Freedom Waves to Gaza" flotilla. Both ships were intercepted by Israeli warships some 50 miles from Gaza. Both ships and 27 activists and crew&amp;nbsp;– 14 Irish citizens and 13 Canadian, Australian, US and Greek citizens&amp;nbsp;– were brought by force to Ashdod, imprisoned for a week and then expelled from Israel.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

===Greek travel ban===
Greece announced that any vessels bound for Gaza are forbidden from leaving their ports.&lt;ref name="csm-greece"/&gt; Greece emphasized safety concerns and noted that the Secretary General of the United Nations, the European Council, the Middle East Quartet and Greece itself had already urged against participation in the flotilla.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mfa.gr/www.mfa.gr/AuthoritiesAbroad/North+America/USA/EmbassyWashington/Articles/en-US/Foreign+Ministry+Announcement+regarding+Greece%E2%80%99s+intention+to+undertake+the+task+of+transporting+hum.htm |title=Foreign Ministry Announcement regarding Greece's intention to undertake the task of transporting humanitarian aid |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=Embassy Of Greece |date=3 July 2011 |accessdate=10 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Greece offered to transfer the cargo onto Greek ships, and transport humanitarian aid through established aid channels, as requested by the UN Secretary General.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Ben-David |first1=Calev |last2=Petrakis |first2=Maria |date=3 July 2011 |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-07-03/greece-offers-to-transfer-aid-from-detained-flotilla-to-gaza.html |title=Greece Offers to Transfer Aid From Detained Flotilla to Gaza |work=Bloomberg |accessdate=3 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The offer was supported by Israel, the Palestinian Authority and the United Nations, but rejected by the flotilla activists.&lt;ref name="voareject"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bill"/&gt;

====Violations====
On 1 July, the American-manned flotilla boat ''Audacity of Hope'', which was not carrying any aid, sailed from [[Perama]] in violation of this Greek ban. It was intercepted after about ten minutes by an armed [[Hellenic Coast Guard]] boat and two Zodiac speedboats. An hours-long standoff ensued, with the coast guard initially trying to persuade the boat to turn back. Eventually, the boat was boarded by armed coast guard personnel and escorted to a Greek naval facility.&lt;ref name="greek"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bill"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Torchia |first=Christopher |date=2 July 2011 |url=http://www.boston.com/news/world/europe/articles/2011/07/02/greeks_turn_back_us_protesters_bound_for_blockaded_gaza/ |title=Greeks turn back US protesters bound for blockaded Gaza |work=The Boston Globe |agency=Associated Press |accessdate=2 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greek authorities arrested the American captain of the boat, John Klusmire, and held him on charges of endangering the lives of the boat's passengers, which is a felony, and of trying to leave port without permission. Activists responded by launching a [[hunger strike]]. Klusmire was released from custody on 5 July, but the charges against him were not dropped.&lt;ref name="apgreece"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sunk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="haspanish"/&gt;&lt;ref name="apreleases"/&gt; "Only a fool thought we'd get to Gaza given what happened last year. We knew we'd be stopped," said Henry Norr, an activist on the boat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bender |first=Kristin J. |date=8 July 2011 |title=Activist talks about failed mission to reach the Gaza Strip |url=http://www.mercurynews.com/breaking-news/ci_18442144 |work=Mercury News |location=San Jose, CA }}{{registration required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 July, the mainly Canadian-manned ''Tahrir'' sailed from [[Crete]] in violation of the ban. It did so without its original Greek crew on board, and instead with "international volunteers" piloting the boat. Canadian Soha Kneen and Australian Michael Coleman were arrested after they used [[kayak]]s to surround a Greek coast guard vessel pursuing the boat. The coast guard vessel caught up to the ''Tahrir'' after about 15 minutes. Passengers attempted to protect the wheelhouse by draping it with netting and blocking doorways by sitting in front of them and linking arms. The ''Tahrir'' was sprayed with water cannons, boarded by armed officers, and towed back to port. One activist claimed that two officers boarded the boat, and one had a pistol drawn as he approached the boat's wheelhouse to take control. Canadian citizen Sandra Ruch, who was responsible for the boat, was arrested on charges of illegally sailing without permission. Fifty other passengers were detained by the Greek coastal authority.&lt;ref name="greece_blocks_boat"/&gt;&lt;ref name="braced"/&gt; Activists claimed that the coast guard vessel rammed the boat against a cement pier and demanded that it be fixed immediately at Greece's expense.&lt;ref name="bill"/&gt;&lt;ref name="apreleases"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Chai |first=Carmen |date=5 July 2011 |url=https://vancouversun.com/news/Canadians+freed+after+flotilla+attempts+leave+Greece+Gaza/5052446/story.html |title=Canadians freed after flotilla attempts to leave Greece for Gaza |work=Vancouver Sun  |accessdate=10 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Activists Soha Kneen and Michael Coleman were tried and found guilty of obstructing the interception of the ''Tahrir'', and were sentenced to 30 days in prison. Both had their sentences suspended and were released, but were fined 246 Euros in court costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Rankin |first=Jim |date=6 July 2011 |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/world/article/1020539--kayaktivists-from-gaza-flotilla-found-guilty-but-released?bn=1 |title='Kayaktivists' from Gaza flotilla found guilty but released |work=The Star |location=Toronto |accessdate=11 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early morning of 5 July, the French yacht ''Dignité&amp;nbsp;– Al Karama'', carrying eight passengers, evaded the Greek coast guard and left a port near Athens, but turned back on its own after several hours. Reportedly, the activists aboard the vessel did not want to be the only ones sailing to the Gaza Strip.&lt;ref name="sunk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="haspanish"/&gt;&lt;ref name="braced"/&gt; Later, the vessel attempted to depart again in defiance of the Greek ban, but was stopped and taken to the port of [[Sitia]] on the island of [[Crete]]. Greek authorities said that during these events the yacht collided with a Greek coast guard vessel and damaged it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=jpost.com staff |date=17 July 2011 |title='Gaza-bound flotilla yacht leaves Greece, sails to Egypt' |url=http://www.jpost.com/DiplomacyAndPolitics/Article.aspx?id=229670 |work=Jerusalem Post |accessdate=21 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 July, about 20 Spanish activists from the ship ''Guernica'' occupied the Spanish embassy in Athens to protest the Greek travel ban.&lt;ref name="sunk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="braced"/&gt;

===Activist withdrawal===
On 7 July 2011 most of the activists withdrew from the initiative and left Greece for home. Only a few dozen remained to try to convince the Greek government to end its travel ban.&lt;ref name="Katz-2010"/&gt;

===Journey of the ''Dignité Al Karama''===
[[File:Flickr - Israel Defense Forces - Free Gaza Flotilla Participant Accepts Food From IDF Soldier.jpg|thumb|250px|IDF soldiers giving food to ''Dignite Al Karama'' passengers following the takeover]]
On 16 July, the French yacht ''Dignité Al Karama'' left the Greek island of [[Kastellorizo]] after informing Greek authorities that its destination was the Egyptian port of [[Alexandria]].&lt;ref name="egypt"/&gt; Instead, the vessel headed for Gaza. Aboard the yacht were 16 people, including three crew members and journalists from [[Al Jazeera]], as well as [[Amira Hass]], an Israeli journalist from ''[[Haaretz]]''.&lt;ref name="AlJazeera-2011-07-18"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=18 July 2011 |title=Freedom Flotilla Update: Dignité-Al Karama will be arriving in Gaza any minute now |url=http://english.pnn.ps/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=10466&amp;Itemid=56 |work=Palestine News Network |accessdate=22 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Dignité Al Karama'' was stopped by the [[Israeli Navy]] about 65 kilometers off the coast of Gaza, in international waters, after ignoring warnings that it was approaching the Gaza blockade line and must change course for either [[Ashdod]] or Egypt.

A top Israeli naval officer{{Who|date=July 2011}} warned that Israel would prevent the ships from breaking its [[2007–present blockade of the Gaza Strip|blockade on Gaza]] at all costs, and that Israel would again use force if required, including boarding the ships and confronting the activists. Brig. Gen. Yoav Mordechai added, "There is an unequivocal directive from the government to enforce the naval blockade that is recognized by international law, and we will not allow it to be broken."&lt;ref name="NYT_16June2011a"/&gt; The [[Israel Defense Forces]] (IDF) began training personnel for future flotillas. In addition to [[Shayetet 13]] commandos, other naval and special forces units were also drilled to participate.

On 19 June 2011, [[Eli Marom]], Commander of the Israeli Navy, was quoted as calling the flotilla a "hate flotilla".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Pfeffer |first=Anshel |date=19 June 2011 |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/israel-navy-commander-hate-flotilla-to-gaza-must-be-stopped-1.368579 |title=Israel Navy commander: 'Hate flotilla' to Gaza must be stopped |work=Haaretz |accessdate=19 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Israeli military sources told Israeli newspapers on 27 June 2011 that some radical elements among flotilla members intended to kill soldiers who tried to board their vessels, and had equipped themselves with bags of sulfur to throw at soldiers.

Neither is there any clear information regarding deadly weapons on any of the ships". He said that it can be assumed that this is considered a possibility by defense forces, along with many other scenarios, but was improperly turned into a definitive fact.&lt;ref group="text" name="JP_29June2011_Hysteria_Hasbara_Flotilla"&gt;{{cite news |last=Derfner |first=Larry |date=29 June 2011 |title=Hysteria, hasbara, and the flotilla |url=http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Columnists/Article.aspx?ID=227181&amp;R=R1 |work=Jerusalem Post |accessdate=30 June 2011}} This article also reports that Israel's most widely read newspaper, ''[[Yedioth Ahronoth]]'', wrote ( in Hebrew ) of the claim, "There isn't a shred of substance to the report that extremist elements will put up violent resistance to IDF soldiers aboard the flotilla.

However, Strategic Affairs Minister [[Moshe Ya'alon]] later said that reports from army sources that flotilla participants were planning lethal violence were accurate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=jpost.com staff |date=29 June 2011 |title=Ya'alon: Flotilla participants will try to harm soldiers |url=http://www.jpost.com/Defense/Article.aspx?id=227159 |work=Jerusalem Post |accessdate=10 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Israel's Prime Minister's Office replied that the materials issued by the IDF spokesman are based on reliable intelligence assessments.&lt;ref group="text" name="YediothAhronoth_29June2011_Netanyahu_IDF_spin"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nrg.co.il/online/1/ART2/254/840.html |last=Brdnstein |first=Eli |date=29 June 2011 |title=גורם מדיני: המידע המודיעיני סביב המשט&amp;nbsp;– ספין של נתניהו |language=Hebrew |trans-title=Political factor: the intelligence around the flotilla&amp;nbsp;– Netanyahu's spin |work=[[Yedioth Ahronoth]] |accessdate=30 June 2011 |quote={{lang|he|שרים בקבינט זועמים על כך שהמידע שפרסם צה'ל, לפיו ספינות המשט יעשו דרכן לחופי ישראל כשעל סיפונן חומרים כימיים, לא הובא בפניהם ומזהירים מפני 'היסטריית הסברה סביב המשט'. גורם מדיני אמר: 'מתגבר החשש לספין של נתניהו. שום דבר מהמידע שהופץ לתקשורת לא הובא בפנינו'. לשכת רה'מ מסרה: 'החומר שהוצא על ידי דובר צה'ל אושר על ידי כל גורמי המודיעין'}} [Cabinet ministers are furious that the information issued by the IDF, about which ships will make their way off the coast of Israel with chemical substances aboard, was not brought to them and warned against 'hysterical propaganda about the flotilla.'

The Prime Minister's office said: 'The material issued by the IDF Spokesman was confirmed by all intelligence agencies']}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the same day, Israel's Government Press Office issued a letter to foreign journalists, warning them that participating in the upcoming flotilla sailing to Gaza could result in them being barred from Israel for up to 10 years. The letter was signed by GPO director Oren Helman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Haaretz |date=26 June 2011 |title=Israel warns foreign journalists: Joining Gaza flotilla is illegal |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/israel-warns-foreign-journalists-joining-gaza-flotilla-is-illegal-1.369684 |work=Haaretz |accessdate=1 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision was rescinded by Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] the following day, along with a statement that journalists would be invited onto Israeli naval vessels.

On 27 June Israeli Foreign Minister [[Avigdor Lieberman]] stated that [[List of participants of Freedom Flotilla II|flotilla participants]] are "terror activists, seeking to create provocation and looking for blood", and that Israel plans to "deal with the flotilla properly".

On 28 June, a YouTube video of a man called "Marc" who claims to be an activist denied from boarding the flotilla on account of his homosexuality was exposed to be a hoax. The man in the video was discovered to be Omer Gershon, an Israeli entrepreneur and public relations expert. The video was tweeted by an intern in Prime Minister Netanyahu's office.

Unauthorized efforts to deliver aid are provocative and, ultimately, unhelpful to the people of Gaza." He added that Canadians should instead donate to the Red Cross/Red Crescent in the Gaza Strip. The department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade said: "The border around the Gaza Strip is under the control of Israeli and Egyptian authorities.

[[Shurat HaDin]], an NGO based in Israel, delayed or blocked several of the vessels by legal methods, including warning insurance companies that insuring the flotilla boats might leave the companies open to prosecution for aiding a terrorist organization.&lt;ref name="nyt28"/&gt; In addition, Shurat HaDin sent a letter warning [[Inmarsat]], a satellite navigation company, that it could be open to legal charges for providing communications and navigation services to ships that are part of the flotilla.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=AFP |date=7 June 2011 |url=http://www.jordantimes.com/index.php?news=38232 |title=Israel group warns Inmarsat |work=The Jordan Times |accessdate=11 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Journalists===
{{Undue|section|date=July 2011}}

[[Israeli-Arab]] journalist [[Khaled Abu Toameh]], writing for the [[Gatestone Institute]], noted that "according to Palestinians living in the Gaza Strip, there is no shortage of basic foods",&lt;ref name="Abu-Toameh-2011"/&gt; and that "periodic shortage of medical supplies is often attributed to the ongoing power struggle between Hamas and Fatah, whose representatives in the West Bank are sometimes accused of withholding medicine as a way of punishing the Hamas government."&lt;ref name="Abu-Toameh-2011"/&gt; Abu Toameh questioned why, given this situation, the flotilla organizers did not plan to help Syrian and Libyan refugees, whose situation was worse, or to express solidarity with Saudi Arabian women who are being [[gender apartheid in Saudi Arabia|arrested for driving]] cars.&lt;ref name="Abu-Toameh-2011"/&gt;

Canada's ''[[National Post]]'' editorialized against the flotilla, calling it a "charade".&lt;ref name="np-2011"/&gt; It concluded that &lt;blockquote&gt;The real intention of the flotilla is to break the blockade and end Hamas' political isolation. There can be only one reason why anyone would consider such an outcome desirable: The absence of a blockade would allow the free passage of arms to the terror-embracing Hamas government, which has frequently demonstrated its goal of ending Israel's existence as a nation. Israel's blockade of Gaza is a direct consequence of attacks launched from within the territory. If flotilla participants really want to ease Gazans' isolation, they should encourage Hamas to acknowledge Israel's right to exist and to forswear terrorism.&lt;ref name="np-2011"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''[[Pravda]]'' argued in favour of the flotilla, stating &lt;blockquote&gt;And so the world was forgetting Gaza. It forgot that the blockade was deemed illegal by the UN. They paid little attention to the complaints of people like Ilan Pappé, former professor of history at the [[University of Haifa]], "Israel uses genocidal policies in Gaza." The lack of UN action was left to pass blankly, whose commission investigating the massacre of Freedom Flotilla I was paralyzed (as though we do not know why).  It is because of this forgetfulness that Freedom Flotilla 2 was ready to sail. Remember the tragedy in Gaza is far from over. The people there are still suffering a totally illegal and unjust blockade that has lasted five years. Humanity cannot continue allowing a city to be slowly strangled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Eça |first=Luiz |date=9 July 2011 |url=http://english.pravda.ru/history/09-07-2011/118438-Gaza_what_the_world_forgot-0/ |title=Gaza: what the world forgot |work=Pravda |accessdate=21 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Other===
Businessmen from the Gaza Strip interviewed by ''[[Ynet]]'' said regarding the flotilla that the main problem was not importing goods into Gaza, as there was "no shortage of stock" in the territory, but the difficulty of exporting goods. However, they stressed that they were not opposed to the flotilla.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Levy |first=Elior |date=1 July 2011 |title=Gazans unimpressed by flotilla |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4089709,00.html |work=Ynetnews |location=Tel Aviv |accessdate=1 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Author [[Alice Walker]] announced that she will join the flotilla and published a letter in support of the Flotilla.  The letter puts the flotilla in the context of the "followers of Gandhi," and the "Jewish civil rights activists" who stood side by side with blacks in America's South.  In the letter, she also rebukes Benjamin Netanyahu policies, and those in the US who back them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Harman |first=Danna |date=23 June 2011 |title=Author Alice Walker to take part in Gaza flotilla, despite U.S. warning |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/author-alice-walker-to-take-part-in-gaza-flotilla-despite-u-s-warning-1.369262 |work=Haaretz |accessdate=7 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fellow author [[Howard Jacobson]] criticized Walker saying that her concern for setting the children of Gaza over the children of Israel does not justify the flotilla, and that she gives no convincing reason for partaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=JTA |date=24 June 2011 |title=UK writer slams Alice Walker for Gaza flotilla ride |url=http://www.jta.org/news/article/2011/06/24/3088287/acclaimed-novelist-criticizes-alice-walker-for-gaza-flotilla-participation |publisher=JTA |accessdate=10 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110627074207/http://www.jta.org/news/article/2011/06/24/3088287/acclaimed-novelist-criticizes-alice-walker-for-gaza-flotilla-participation |archivedate=27 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philip Missfelder, foreign policy spokesman of the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]] (CDU) and [[Christian Social Union of Bavaria|Christian Social Union]] (CSU) parties, the largest combined group of MPs in the [[German parliament]], said on 5 July that the so-called Gaza flotilla activists "endanger peace efforts" and their action is "part of the asymmetrical warfare against Israel." He added that their actions were "not about humanitarian help, rather a confrontation with Israel". He further stated that the activists were working against the goals of Germany and the Middle East Quartet. "I welcome that the Greek authorities have decisively intervened as some activists set sail without permission," he said.&lt;ref name="braced"/&gt;

[[Harvard University]] literature professor [[Ruth Wisse]] condemned the flotilla as a "kill-the-Jews flotilla", stating that its purpose was "to discredit the Israeli attempt to protect itself and to give Hamas a free hand amassing weapons to use against Israeli civilians".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Twersky |first=Mordechai I. |date=4 July 2011 |title=Harvard professor assails 'kill-the-Jews flotilla' |url=http://www.jpost.com/VideoArticles/Video/Article.aspx?id=227881 |work=Jerusalem Post |accessdate=10 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christopher Hitchens]] condemned the flotilla for its cooperation with Hamas, noting Hamas' official and programmatic adoption of the [[antisemitic]] forgery ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'', its expression of outrage at the [[death of Osama bin Laden]], and its ties with [[Hezbollah]], [[al-Qaeda]] and the regimes of Syria and Iran. He also criticized the media for "soft-centred coverage" of the affair, suggesting that pointed questions should have been asked of the flotilla participants and that the title "activists" was an inaccurate and gratuitously positive label for the participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hitchins |first=Christopher |date=5 July 2011 |title=Christopher Hitchens: Some questions for the 'activists' aboard the Gaza flotilla |url=http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2011/07/05/christopher-hitchens-some-questions-for-the-%E2%80%9Cactivists%E2%80%9D-aboard-the-gaza-flotilla/ |work=National Post Full Comment |location=Toronto |accessdate=10 July 2011 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120708155459/http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2011/07/05/christopher-hitchens-some-questions-for-the-%E2%80%9Cactivists%E2%80%9D-aboard-the-gaza-flotilla/# |archive-date=8 July 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Paul Murphy (Irish politician)|Paul Murphy]], Member of the [[European Parliament]] (MEP) and longtime Freedom Flotilla supporter, "The aim of the Flotilla is to break that siege by delivering vital medical supplies and construction material and to highlight the ongoing blockade and impact on the population."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=24 June 2011 |url=http://www.socialistworld.net/doc/5155 |title=Paul Murphy Socialist Party MEP  joins 'Freedom Flotilla II' |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/603tZQbQo?url=http://www.socialistworld.net/doc/5155 |work=socialistworld.net |archivedate=10 July 2011 |deadurl=no |accessdate=10 July 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;br /&gt;• {{cite web|author=World Health Organization |date=20 June 2011 |title=Shortages of drugs and medical disposables in MoH Gaza |url=https://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/B35E9E3AC0BFF630852578B5004B9C43 |work=UNISPAL Documents Collection |accessdate=5 July 2011 |quote=... the protracted period of low stocks is now deemed critical for the continued delivery of health care. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four [[Nobel Peace]] Laureates, [[Mairead Maguire]], [[Jody Williams]], [[Shirin Ebadi]], and [[Rigoberta Menchú Tum]], wrote a letter to UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon "to urge you to use your good offices in support of the humanitarian needs of the people of Gaza....by appointing a representative to inspect and seal the cargo of the boats of the Freedom Flotilla II—thus assuring the Israeli government that the boats are carrying humanitarian supplies such as toys, medical supplies, cement and educational materials."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Laureates to Ban Ki-moon: Safe passage for Gaza Flotilla |url=http://www.nobelwomensinitiative.org/home/article/laureates-support-freedom-flotilla |date=10 June 2011 &lt;!--date of the open letter--&gt; |location=Ottawa |publisher=Nobel Women's Initiative |accessdate=10 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721201740/http://www.nobelwomensinitiative.org/home/article/laureates-support-freedom-flotilla |archivedate=21 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 July 2011, [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] linguistics professor [[Noam Chomsky]], wrote "Today the U.S. and Israel are vigorously seeking to block the flotilla. U.S. Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]] virtually authorized violence, stating that 'Israelis have the right to defend themselves' if flotillas 'try to provoke action by entering into Israeli waters'&amp;nbsp;– that is, the territorial waters of Gaza, as if Gaza belonged to Israel. Greece agreed to prevent the boats from leaving (that is, those boats not already sabotaged)&amp;nbsp;– though, unlike Clinton, Greece referred rightly to 'the maritime area of Gaza.' In January 2009, Greece had distinguished itself by refusing to permit U.S. arms to be shipped to Israel from Greek ports during the vicious U.S.-Israeli assault in Gaza. No longer an independent country in its current financial duress, Greece evidently cannot risk such unusual integrity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Chomsky |first=Noam |date=7 July 2011 |title=In Israel, a Tsunami Warning |url=http://www.truth-out.org/israel-tsunami-warning/1310042953 |work=Truthout |accessdate=10 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reactions to Greek ban===
Greek President [[Karolos Papoulias]] later visited Israel, where Israeli President [[Shimon Peres]] told him: "I thank you very much for fulfilling the UN secretary general's guidelines and stopping the flotilla. Thank you for not allowing people interested in disturbing good order and international law from coming without supervision to Gaza, which is led by a terrorist group."&lt;ref name="egypt"/&gt;

Joshua Mitnick of the ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'' reported that Greece's actions were the result of a growing relationship between Israel and Greece, including an offer of "generous military assistance", that started after Israeli–Turkish ties were damaged by the Gaza flotilla raid.&lt;ref name="csm-greece"/&gt;

'''''Imperium''''' is a [[Latin]] word that, in a broad sense, translates roughly as '[[Power (philosophy)|power]] to command'. In [[ancient Rome]], different kinds of power or [[authority]] were distinguished by different terms. ''Imperium'' referred to the ability of an individual to command the military.  It is not to be confused with ''[[auctoritas]]'' or ''[[potestas]]'', different and generally inferior types of power in the [[Roman Republic]] and [[Roman Empire|Empire]].  Primarily used to refer to the power that is wielded, in greater or lesser degree, by an individual to whom it is delegated, the term could also be used with a geographical connotation, designating the territorial limits of that ''imperium''. Individuals given such power were referred to as curule [[Roman magistrate|magistrates]] or [[promagistrate]]s. These included the curule [[aedile]], the [[praetor]], the [[Roman consul|consul]], the [[magister equitum]], and the [[Roman dictator|dictator]].

== Personal characteristic ==
In ancient Rome, ''imperium'' could be used as a term indicating a characteristic of people, the wealth held in items, or the measure of formal power they had. This qualification could be used in a rather loose context (for example, poets used it, not necessarily writing about state officials). However, in Roman society it was also a more formal concept of [[legal authority]]. A man with ''imperium'' ("[[imperator]]") had, in principle, absolute authority to apply the law within the scope of his [[magistrate|magistracy]] or [[promagistrate|promagistracy]]. He could be [[veto]]ed or overruled either by a magistrate or promagistrate who was a colleague with equal power (e.g. a fellow [[Roman consul|consul]]) or by one whose ''imperium'' outranked his - that is, one of ''imperium maius'' (greater ''imperium).''

Some modern [[scholar]]s such as [[A.H.M. Jones]] have defined ''imperium'' as "the power vested by the state in a person to do what he considers to be in the best interests of the state".{{cn|date=December 2015}}

''Imperium'' can be distinguished from [[Monarchy|''regnum'']], or royal power, which was inherited. ''Imperium'' was originally a [[military]] concept, the power of the ''[[imperator]]'' (general in the army) to command. The word derives from the Latin verb, ''imperare'' (to command). The title ''imperator'' was applied to the emperor, who was the commander of the armed forces. In fact, the Latin word, ''imperator'', gives us the English word "emperor".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Etymology of the word emperor|url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/emperor|accessdate=13 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Imperium'' was indicated in two prominent ways. A ''[[curule]]'' magistrate or promagistrate carried an ivory baton surmounted by an eagle as his personal symbol of office (compare the [[field marshal]]'s baton). Any such magistrate was also escorted by ''[[lictor]]s'' bearing the ''[[fasces]]'' (traditional symbols of imperium and authority); when outside the ''[[pomerium]]'', axes were added to the ''fasces'' to indicate an imperial magistrate's power to enact capital punishment outside Rome (the axes were removed within the ''pomerium''). The number of lictors in [[attendance]] upon a magistrate was an overt indication of the degree of ''imperium''. When in the field, a ''curule'' magistrate possessing an ''imperium'' greater or equal to that of a [[praetor]] wore a sash ritually knotted on the front of his [[cuirass]]. Further, any man executing ''imperium'' within his sphere of influence was entitled to the [[curule chair]].

* Curule [[aedile]] (''aedilis curulis'') – 2 lictors
** Since a plebeian aedile (aedilis plebis) did not own imperium, he was not escorted by lictors.
* [[Magister equitum]] (the [[Roman dictator|dictator]]'s deputy) – 6 lictors
* [[Praetor]] – 6 lictors (2 lictors within the pomerium)
* [[Roman consul|Consul]] – 12 lictors each
* [[Roman dictator|Dictator]] – 24 lictors outside the Pomerium and 12 inside; starting from the dictatorship of [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla|Lucius Sulla]] the latter rule was ignored.
** Because the dictator could enact capital punishment within Rome as well as without, his lictors did not remove the axes from their fasces within the pomerium.

As can be seen, dictatorial ''imperium'' was superior to consular, consular to praetorian, and praetorian to aedilician; there is some historical dispute as to whether or not praetorian ''imperium'' was superior to "equine-magisterial" ''imperium''. A [[promagistrate]], or a man executing a ''curule'' office without actually holding that office, also possessed ''imperium'' in the same degree as the actual incumbents (i.e., proconsular ''imperium'' being more or less equal to consular ''imperium'', propraetorian ''imperium'' to praetorian) and was attended by an equal number of ''lictors''.

Certain extraordinary [[Commissioned officer|commissions]], such as [[Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus|Pompey]]'s famous command against the [[Piracy|pirates]], were invested with ''imperium maius'' meaning they outranked all other owners of imperium of the same type or rank (in Pompey's case, even the consuls) within their sphere of command (his being "ultimate on the seas, and within 50 miles inland"). ''Imperium maius'' later became a hallmark of the [[Roman emperor]].

Another technical use of the term in [[Roman law]] was for the power to extend the [[law]] beyond its mere interpretation, extending ''imperium'' from formal legislators under the ever-republican constitution: popular assemblies, senate, magistrates, emperor and their [[delegate]]s to the [[jurisprudence]] of [[jurisconsult]]s.

==Later==
While the Byzantine [[Byzantine Emperor|Eastern Roman Emperors]] retained full Roman imperium and made the episcopate subservient, in the feudal West a long rivalry would oppose the claims to supremacy within post-Roman Christianity between ''sacerdotium'' in the person of the Pope and the secular ''imperium'' of the revived Western Roman Emperor since Charlemagne. Both would refer to the heritage of Roman law by their titular link with the very city Rome: the Pope, Bishop ''of Rome'', versus the Holy ''Roman'' Emperor (even though his seat of power was north of the Alps).

The [[Donatio Constantini]], by which the Papacy had allegedly been granted the territorial [[Patrimonium Petri]] in Central Italy, became a weapon against the Emperor. The first pope who used it in an official act and relied upon it, [[Leo IX]], cites the "Donatio" in a letter of 1054 to [[Michael Cærularius]], Patriarch of Constantinople, to show that the Holy See possessed both an earthly and a heavenly ''imperium'', the royal priesthood. Thenceforth the "Donatio" acquires more importance and is more frequently used as evidence in the ecclesiastical and political conflicts between the papacy and the secular power: [[Anselm of Lucca]] and [[Deusdedit of San Pietro in Vincoli|Cardinal Deusdedit]] inserted it in their collections of canons; [[Gratian]] excluded it from his ''Decretum'', but it was soon added to it as ''Palea''; the ecclesiastical writers in defence of the papacy during the conflicts of the early part of the 12th century quoted it as authoritative.

In one bitter episode, [[Pope Gregory IX]] who had several times mediated between the Lombards and the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] reasserted his right to arbitrate between the contending parties. In the numerous manifestos of the Pope and the Emperor the antagonism between Church and State became more evident: the Pope claimed for himself the ''imperium animarum'' 'command of the souls' (i.e. voicing God's will to the faithful) and the ''principatus rerum et corporum in universo mundo'' 'princedom over all things and bodies in the whole world', while the Emperor wished to restore the ''imperium mundi'', imperium (as under Roman Law) over the (now Christian) world — Rome was again to be the capital of the world and Frederick was to become the real emperor of the Romans, so he energetically protested against the authority of the Pope. The emperor's successes, especially his victory over the Lombards at the [[battle of Cortenuova]] (1237), only embittered the opposition between Church and State. The pope again excommunicated the "self-confessed heretic", the "blasphemous beast of the Apocalypse" (20 March 1239) who now attempted to conquer the rest of Italy, i.e. the [[papal states]], et cetera.

== Divine and earthly imperium ==
In some monotheistic religions such as Christianity (the Catholic Church where the official language, Latin, used terms as ''Imperium Dei/Domini'') the Divine is held to have a superior imperium, as ultimate [[King of Kings]], above all earthly powers. Whenever a society accepts this Divine will to be expressed on earth, as by a religious authority, this can lead to [[theocratic]] legitimation. However, the Catholic Church and most other Christian groups acknowledge the authority of secular governments. If however a secular ruler controls the religious hierarchy, he can use it to legitimize his own authority.

Thus absolute, universal power was vested under early Islam in the original [[Caliphate]] (before it became the political toy of worldly powers 'behind the throne' and was even politically discarded by essentially secular princes), and later again claimed by [[Mahdi]]s.

The chief minister of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] [[Thomas Cranmer]] suggested removal of the Roman Catholic papacy's ''[[imperium in imperio]]'' (Latin for "state within a state") by requesting that Parliament pass the [[Act in Restraint of Appeals]] (1533) specifying that England was an empire and that [[The Crown]] was imperial, and a year later the [[Act of Supremacy]] proclaiming the [[Imperial Crown]] Protector and Supreme Head of the [[Church of England]].{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

In Orthodox Russia too, when [[Peter I the Great]] assumed the Byzantine imperial titles ''Imperator'' and [[Autokrator]], instead of the royal Tsar, the idea in founding the [[Russian Holy Synod]] was to put an end to the old ''Imperium in imperio'' of the free Church, by substituting the synod for the all too independent [[Patriarch of Moscow]], which had become almost a rival of the Tsars — Peter meant to unite all authority in himself, over Church as well as State: through his [[Ober-Procurator]] and synod, the Emperor ruled his Church as absolutely as the military through their respective ministries; he appointed its members just as he did generals; and the Russian Government continued his policy until the end of the empire in 1917.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9521">{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2018}}{{Use British English|date=April 2018}}The '''Kabaka crisis''' was a political and constitutional crisis in the [[Uganda Protectorate]] between 1953 and 1955. The crisis would result in the [[Buganda Agreement (1955)|Buganda Agreement of 1955]] and ultimately shape the nature of Ugandan independence.

== Background ==

In 1893 the [[Imperial British East Africa Company]] (IBEAC) transferred its administration rights over its territories in modern day Uganda to the British Government. At that time, the IBEAC's territory consisted mainly of the [[Kingdom of Buganda]], which had been acquired in 1892. In 1894 the [[Uganda Protectorate]] was established, and, with Bugandan assistance the territory was rapidly extended beyond the borders of Buganda to an area that roughly corresponds to that of present-day [[Uganda]]. The [[Buganda Agreement (1900)|Buganda Agreement of 1900]] formalised Buganda's place as a constitutional monarchy (headed by the [[Kabaka of Buganda|Kabaka]]) within the broader Protectorate.&lt;ref name="Reid2017"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zDQEDgAAQBAJ|title=A History of Modern Uganda|last=Reid|first=Richard J.|date=2 March 2017|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=|isbn=978-1-107-06720-2|location=|pages=159–160, 313–315}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Crisis ==

On 30 June 1953, [[Oliver Lyttelton, 1st Viscount Chandos|Oliver Lyttelton]], the [[Secretary of State for the Colonies]], gave a speech in London in which he made a "passing reference" to the possibility "...of still larger measures of unification and possibly still larger measures of federation of the whole East Africa territories".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YvMrBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA403|title=The Political Kingdom in Uganda: A Study in Bureaucratic Nationalism|last=Apter|first=David E.|date=1967|publisher=Routledge|year=|isbn=978-1-136-30757-7|location=|page=|pages=276-300}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="low2" /&gt; Lyttelton's remarks were reported by the [[The Standard (Kenya)|''East African Standard'']] on 2 and 3 July, prompting the Ministers of the Bugandan Government to write to the Governor of Uganda, Sir [[Andrew Cohen (colonial governor)|Andrew Cohen]], on 6 July to stress their opposition to such a plan.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Baganda people, who always valued their autonomy and Independence were alarmed by the idea of a broader federation on the model of the [[Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland|Central African Federation]].&lt;ref name="bugandadotcom3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buganda.com/back1955.htm|title=Background to 1953-55 Crisis|publisher=Mukasa E. Ssemakula|accessdate=2 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They felt that such a move would result in the integration of different cultures which would ultimately destroy and engulf their own culture and way of life.&lt;ref name="bugandadotcom3" /&gt;

Cohen responded by assuring the Baganda that there was no reason for concern, and that no decision pertaining to the formation of an East African federation would be made without first consulting them.&lt;ref name="low2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Buganda in modern history|last=Low|first=D.A.|publisher=University of California Press|year=1971|isbn=0520016408|location=Berkeley|pages=108–114}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a residual feeling in Buganda, however, that Lyttelton had let the cat out of the bag.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The incident served to crystallise animosity and apparent slights dating back to the 1900 Agreement, and prompted widespread calls among the Baganda for Bugandan independence as the only protection against British overreach.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bugandadotcom3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Low1971"&gt;see (e.g.) "Kabaka Mutesa II to Sir Andrew Cohen, 6 August 1953" in {{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ith-L8DYXuUC|title=The Mind of Buganda: Documents of the Modern History of an African Kingdom|author=Donald Anthony Low|first=|publisher=University of California Press|year=1971|isbn=978-0-520-01969-0|location=|pages=163&amp;ndash;166|chapter=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even a reply from the Secretary of State attempting to reassure the Kabaka [[Mutesa II of Buganda|Mutesa II]] that "the inclusion of the Uganda Protectorate in any such federation is outside the realm of practical politics at the present time" served only to fan the flames.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Bakamas of Bunyoro and Toro, and the Omugabe of Ankole, also wrote to Cohen to express their own fears.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In order to resolve the spiralling crisis, Cohen took a direct approach, choosing to meet Mutesa in person, but a series of six private meetings at Government House did not result in a resolution on the issue of Bugandan independence and the political unrest continued.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Frustrated, Cohen told Mutesa that continuing to agitate against the British vision of a single Ugandan state constituted a breach of the 1900 Agreement,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; as well as a repudiation of the joint declaration of March 1953,&lt;ref name="low2" /&gt; and that he had five weeks to reconsider.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Despite the apparent ultimatum, Mutesa, supported by the [[Lukiiko|Bugandan Lukiiko]] (Parliament) and other neighbouring Kingdoms, continued pushing for Buganda secession.&lt;ref name="low2" /&gt; This intransigence prompted Cohen to write to him on 20 November 1953 to inform him that, under the provisions of Article 6 of the 1900 Agreement, the British Government was withdrawing their recognition of him as the legitimate ruler of Buganda.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This position was confirmed on 30 November in the form of a written declaration.&lt;ref name="low2" /&gt;

Cohen was fearful that this action would incite violent protest by the Baganda and declared a state of emergency.&lt;ref name="low2" /&gt; Mutesa was arrested and rapidly exiled to London, much to the shock of the Baganda.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="low2" /&gt; He would be permitted to live freely, anywhere in the world, but not to return to Uganda.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Hansard|house=House of Commons|title=Kabaka of Buganda (Withdrawal of Recognition)|url=https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1953/nov/30/kabaka-of-buganda-withdrawal-of|date=30 November 1953|column_start=780|column_end=783|speaker=Oliver Lyttelton|position=Secretary of State for the Colonies}}&lt;/ref&gt; While his supporters lobbied strongly on his behalf, Mutesa himself behaved "as if on vacation", staying primarily at the [[Savoy Hotel]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Summers|first=Carol|date=2017|title=All the Kabaka's Wives: Marital Claims in Buganda's 1953–5 Kabaka Crisis|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-african-history/article/div-classtitleall-the-kabakaandaposs-wives-marital-claims-in-bugandaandaposs-19535-kabaka-crisisa-hreffns01-ref-typefnadiv/400DA094C9549BAA25A4CD36D7A2FFF7|journal=The Journal of African History|language=en|volume=58|issue=1|pages=107–127|doi=10.1017/S0021853716000645|issn=0021-8537|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cohen's preference was for a new Kabaka to be installed immediately, but this proved impossible.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bugandadotcom3" /&gt; Exiling the Kabaka, far from resolving the situation, fuelled it.&lt;ref name="Reid2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Resistance in Buganda itself was nevertheless mostly peaceful,&lt;ref name="low2" /&gt; including public displays of "weeping, mourning and collapsing in grief...

[[File:Quadrature black-out HADOPI.gif|thumb|La Quadrature du Net protesting against the [[HADOPI law]]]]

'''La Quadrature du Net''' (''[[Squaring the circle|Squaring of]] [[Internet|the Net]]'' in French) is a [[France|French]] [[advocacy group]] that promotes [[digital rights]] and freedoms of citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.laquadrature.net/en/who-are-we|title=Who are we?|publisher=La Quadrature du Net}}&lt;/ref&gt; It advocates for French and European legislation to respect the founding principles of the Internet, most notably the free circulation of knowledge. ''La Quadrature du Net'' engages in public-policy debates concerning, for instance, [[freedom of speech]], [[copyright]], regulation of telecommunications and online [[privacy]].

The group was founded in 2008 by [[free software]] promoters and activists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Squaring the Net : the debate is open.|url=https://www.laquadrature.net/the-debate-is-open|publisher=La Quadrature du Net|date=27 March 2008}}

In 2012 ''Quadrature'' spokesman and co-founder [[Jérémie Zimmermann]] received a [[EFF Pioneer Award|Pioneer award]] for his action against [[ACTA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/awards/pioneer/2012|title=EFF Pioneer Awards 2012|publisher=Electronic Frontier Foundation|website=eff.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Quadrature'' is supported by other advocacy and free software groups, including the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] and the [[Free Software Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laquadrature.net/en/they-support-squaring-the-net|title=They support La Quadrature du Net|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the collective re-organised from a de facto association to a formal (French law) association. This association was founded by 8 long-time participants or helpers of the initial collective.

[[Philippe Aigrain]], author of two books on [[information commons]], is one of the co-founders of the collective and the association.
[[Jérémie Zimmermann]], also co-founder of both collective and association, is frequently invited to television programs and interviews, defending and raising awareness about the association's positions and opposition to the many projects they consider threaten fundamental liberties and the Internet (French HADOPI law, European Telecoms Package, [[ACTA]], [[Net Neutrality]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/326070 |title=Assange 'The World Tomorrow' — Ep 8: Cypherpunks Part 1 |accessdate=2012-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name origin==
The name is based on the [[quadrature of the circle]], an unsolvable mathematical problem.

According to the collective, it is “impossible to effectively control the flow of information in the digital age by law and technology without harming public freedoms and damaging economic and social development”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laquadrature.net/en/faq-0|title=FAQ|publisher=La Quadrature du Net}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collective makes an analogy with the [[squaring of the circle]] as a problem that could take ages for people to realize is impossible to solve, as initially intended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laquadrature.net/en/why-the-name-squaring-the-net |title=La Quadrature du Net - Why the name "Squaring the net"? |publisher=Laquadrature.net |date= |accessdate=2012-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Leung TC William Roy v Secretary for Justice''''' ({{zh|t=《梁威廉訴律政司司長》}} ) is a leading [[Hong Kong High Court]] [[judicial review]] case on the equal protection on [[sexual orientation]] and the law of standing in [[Hong Kong]]. Particularly, the Court sets up a precedent case prohibiting unjustified differential treatments based upon one's sexual orientation.

==Background==
Prior to this case, the [[age of consent]] for homosexual men was 21 but not for heterosexual or lesbian couples, which was 16. Any gay man engaging in [[buggery]] with another man under 21 could be sentenced to [[life imprisonment]], based on the provisions contained in the ''Crimes Ordinance''. In 2004, Mr Leung, the applicant, a 20-year-old gay man, applied for leave for [[judicial review]] without being arrested or prosecuted. In his application, Mr Leung complained that the ''Crimes Ordinance'' discriminated against him based upon his sexual orientation and interfered with his private life by forbidding him to give physical expression to other gay men and, thus, making him unable to develop long-lasting relationships. The consequences were low self-esteem, loneliness, and sense of marginalisation. &lt;sub&gt;(Court of First Instance, para. 6)&lt;/sub&gt;

During the proceedings, Mr Leung challenged four provisions in the ''Crimes Ordinance'' infringing his constitutional rights to equality and privacy. After hearing the oral argument in July 2005, the [[Court of First Instance (Hong Kong)|Court of First Instance]] of the [[High Court (Hong Kong)|High Court]] handed down the judgment a month later. [[Michael Hartmann (judge)|Mr Justice Hartmann]] ruled in favour of the applicant and struck down all four sections of the ''Crime Ordinance'' violating the guaranteed legal protections for [[social equality|equality]] and [[privacy law|privacy]].

Immediately afterwards, the local religious groups gasped and condemned the result and demanded the Government to appeal. In September 2005, the Government declared its plan to appeal. The hearings for appeal took place in July of the following year. On 20 September 2006, the Court of Appeal delivered its judgment and unanimously dismissed the case.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doj.gov.hk/publications/doj2008/eng/c2.htm Highlights of 2006 and 2007, Department of Justice, Hong Kong]&lt;/ref&gt; The Government accepted the reasoning of the Court and did not appeal further.

==Related Law==
In his application for judicial review, Mr Leung challenged Section 118C, 118F(2)(a), 118H and 118J(2)(a) of the ''Crimes Ordinance'' undermining his protected rights to equality and privacy under Articles 25 and 39 of the ''[[Hong Kong Basic Law|Basic Law]]'' and Articles 1, 14, and 22 of the ''[[Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance|Bill of Rights]]''.

==Major Issues==
In this case, 5 major issues were identified and discussed by the High Court:
# Did the courts have the jurisdiction to hear ‘academic’ cases?
# Did the applicant have the necessary standing to initiate the case?
# Had homosexual men been discriminated against by some provisions within the Crimes Ordinance?
# Could a piece of law be determined discriminatory but appearing on the face that they have been applied equally?
#Should the courts let the legislature handle constitutional challenges on primary legislation?

==Arguments &amp; Reasoning==

===Issue 1: Did the courts in Hong Kong have the jurisdiction to hear ‘academic’ cases?===

* Holding:
Yes

* Argument:
The Government argued that the case was academic or hypothetical in its nature because the applicant had not been arrested or prosecuted. It had always been the doctrine of the courts not to hear such cases. Thus, the courts did not have the jurisdiction to hear the applicant’s case.&lt;sub&gt; (Court of First Instance judgement, paragraph 11; Court of Appeal judgement, paragraph 26 )&lt;/sub&gt;

*Reasoning:
The courts in Hong Kong did indeed have the jurisdiction to hear ‘academic’ cases, though the courts would normally dismiss such cases and demand the applicant to show some forms of harms or inabilities as a result of the Government’s judgements, decisions, or actions. At the end of the day, the Court has the discretion to determine whether or not hear such cases. The reasons for the courts avoiding hearing academic cases were that it would be very dangerous for courts to make decisions on important legal principles without a full set of facts.  When exceptional cases arose, the courts should carefully exercise the discretion to hear such cases and follow the instructions provided in Section 21K(2) of the ''High Court Ordinance'': 
{{cquote|An application for a declaration … by way of an application for judicial review, and on such an application the Court … may grant the declaration … if it considers that, having regard to- 
(a)  the nature of the matters in respect of which relief may be granted by orders of mandamus, prohibition or certiorari; &lt;br /&gt;(b)  the nature of the persons and bodies against whom relief may be granted by such orders; and &lt;br /&gt;(c)  all the circumstances of the case, &lt;br /&gt;it would be just and convenient for the declaration to be made…}}

Moreover, the Court expressed that individuals should never be asked to break the law in order to initiate a legal proceeding for the purpose of protecting their fundamental rights. In fact, it would be contradictory to the spirit of Article 35(1) of the Basic Law, which states: 
{{cquote|Hong Kong residents shall have the right to … access to the courts… for timely protection of their lawful rights and interests … and to judicial remedies. }}&lt;sub&gt;(Court of First Instance judgement, paragraphs 51-60; Court of Appeal judgement, paragraph 28)&lt;/sub&gt;

===Issue 2: Did the applicant have the necessary standing to initiate the case?===

* Holding:
Yes
* Argument:
The Government argued that the applicant of the case was not being arrested or prosecuted; thus, he lacked the sufficient interest and standing to bring a case before the court. And even though the applicant would have been considered to have the standing by the Court, the 3-month time limit required by the law for application for judicial review had passed long ago. &lt;sub&gt;(Court of Appeal judgement, paragraph 23)&lt;/sub&gt;
* Reasoning:
The Court of Appeal emphasised that the case involved the expression of love and intimacy by gay men towards one another; the case was therefore ‘about the status, moral citizenship and sense of self-worth of a significant section of the community.’ The Court then ruled that the applicant had sufficient interest to initiate the case because the Court was dealing with the issue which would have great impact on ‘the dignity of a section of society in a significant way.’

Thinking along the same lines as Judge Hartmann, the Court of Appeal concluded that the 3-month time limit would be relevant but not a compelling factor in this particular case. Quoting Judge Hartmann’s comments, the Court of Appeal stated,
{{cquote|What must be remembered is that, even if there is a lack of promptness, the court possesses a discretion to condone it.  In exercising that discretion, one of the matters to be taken into account will be the general importance of the matter raised.  If the matter, as in the present case, goes to the fundamental human rights of a class of persons, that, it seems to me, in the interests of public policy, must be material.&lt;sub&gt;(Court of Appeal judgement, paragraphs 29 &amp; 39)&lt;/sub&gt;}}

===Issue 3: Had homosexual men been unconstitutionally discriminated against by some provisions within the Crimes Ordinance?===

*Holding:
Yes
*Argument:
The Government conceded up front that Section 118F(2)(a), 118H, and 118J(2)(a) were indeed unconstitutional in ways of infringing the applicant’s rights to equality and privacy; however, Section 118C should still be valid because Section 118D, similar to Section 118C, equally applied onto and prohibited heterosexuals from engaging buggery under 21. &lt;sub&gt;(Court of First Instance judgement, paragraph 99)&lt;/sub&gt;
*Reasoning:
The Court agreed and accepted the Government’s concession. The Court then moved to analyse Issue 4. &lt;sub&gt;(Court of First Instance judgement, paragraph 99)&lt;/sub&gt;

===Issue 4: Could a piece of law be determined discriminatory but appearing on the face that they have been applied equally?===

*Holding:
Yes
*Argument:
The Government argued that buggery should not be seen or recognised in the same way as sexual intercourse; and thus, the Court should not compare Section 118C, forbidding gay men from engaging buggery under 21, with the law forbidding heterosexual couples having sex under 16.  Also, the Government believed the Court should hold Section 118C valid under the Basic Law because Section 118D, similar to Section 118C, equally applied onto and prohibited heterosexuals from engaging buggery under 21:
{{cquote|Section 118D of the Crimes Ordinance provides-&lt;br /&gt; A man who commits buggery with a girl under the age of 21 shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction on indictment to imprisonment for life.}}&lt;sub&gt;(Court of Appeal judgement, paragraph 46)&lt;/sub&gt;
*Reasoning:
Citing ''Sutherland v UK'' and through reading of the text of the Crimes Ordinance, buggery is recognised to be a form of sex both in common law and in the Crimes Ordinance. Furthermore, the Court explicitly stated that sex was not only for procreation but also for expressing love and intimacy; buggery, for gay men, fit well into those definitions. Therefore, the Court could compare buggery and sex equally.

The Court and the Government agreed and treated ‘sexual orientation’ as a status or classification. Thus, Article 1 and 22 of the Bill of Rights and Article 25 and 39 of the Basic Law would scrutinise and forbid any unjustified discrimination based on one’s sexual orientation. Agreeing with Judge Hartmann, the Court of Appeal quoted his judgement, 
{{cquote|Denying persons of a minority class the right to sexual expression in the only way available to them, even if that way is denied to all, remains discriminatory when persons of a majority class are permitted the right to sexual expression in a way natural to them.  During the course of submissions, it was described as ‘disguised discrimination’.  It is, I think, an apt description.  It is disguised discrimination founded on a single base: sexual orientation.}}
&lt;sub&gt;(Court of First Instance judgement, paragraphs 17-20; Court of Appeal judgement, paragraphs 43, 46-48)&lt;/sub&gt;

===Issue 5:  Should the courts let the legislature handle constitutional challenges on primary legislation?===

*Holding:
Depends; but for this particular case, no.
*Argument:
The Government argued that whenever there would be constitutional challenges on primary legislation, the courts should follow the [[margin of appreciation]] doctrine and let the Legislative Council handle the matters. By pushing this argument forwards, the Government implied that the Legislative Council was in a better place to decide what was good or bad for the society; and thus, if the society believed that buggery under 21 for gay men should be condemned in order to fulfil the society's needs, then the courts should leave the matter for the Legislative Council to deal with. &lt;sub&gt;(Court of Appeal judgement, paragraph 52)&lt;/sub&gt;
*Reasoning:
In theory, the courts should always been impartial and independent from any interference. Judges were not elected through election, but the members of the Legislative Council were. Thus, the Legislative Council would be in a better position than the courts to determine what the society would need. The courts should recognise and appreciate that fact. Therefore, the courts should let the legislature deal with public policy. And this would be the margin of appreciation doctrine.

Nonetheless, the margin of appreciation given to the legislative should not be unlimited. If there would be a clear infringement of rights based upon race, sex, or sexual orientation, the courts shall scrutinise the proposed justification with intensity. The courts were obligated to invalidate unconstitutional laws. Following the margin of appreciation doctrine, the courts should also always bear in mind of their roles to protect minorities from the excesses of the majority.  Thus, courts should be provided evidence of acceptable justification for any infringement on fundamental rights.  In this case, the Court was not persuaded there had been any acceptable justification for the infringement of the applicant’s rights.
&lt;sub&gt;(Court of Appeal judgement, paragraphs 52-55)&lt;/sub&gt;

==Conclusion==
In conclusion, the Court of First Instance made the following declarations and the Court of Appeal upheld that decision: 
*Sections 118F(2)(a) and 118J(2)(a) are unconstitutional and invalid because of the inconsistency with Articles 25 and 39 of the ''Basic Law'' and Articles 1, 14, and 22 of the ''[[Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance|Bill of Rights]]''
Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance''.
*Sections 118C and 118H are unconstitutional and invalid to the extent that they apply to a man aged between 16 and 21 because of the inconsistency with Articles 25 and 39 of the ''Basic Law'' and Articles 1, 14, and 22 of the ''Bill of Rights''.
&lt;sub&gt;(Court of First Instance judgement, paragraphs 47, 99, 147, and 152; Court of Appeal judgement, paragraphs 56)&lt;/sub&gt;

==Significance==
*The age of consent is thus set at 16 for both heterosexual and homosexual communities.
*Articles 1 and 22 of the Bill of Rights are interpreted to include sexual orientation. All government-sponsored unjustified discrimination based on sexual orientation will be deemed as unconstitutional.
*Hong Kongers will have the standing to initiate lawsuits against the Government without obvious harms or inabilities as a result of the Government’s judgements, decisions, or actions, provided the legal challenges involving constitutional fundamental rights.

{{other uses|Liberal Catholic (disambiguation)}}
'''Liberal Catholicism''' was a current of thought within the [[Catholic Church]]. It was influential in the 19th century and the first half of the 20th, especially in [[France]].

Being predominantly political in nature, liberal Catholicism was distinct from the contemporary theological movement of [[modernism in the Catholic Church|modernism]]. It is also distinct from both the attitude of Catholics who are described as theologically "progressive" or "[[liberal Christianity|liberal]]".

== Definition ==

Liberal Catholicism has been defined as "in essence a trend among sincere Catholics to exalt freedom as a primary value and to draw from this consequences in social, political, and religious life, seeking to reconcile the principles on which Christian France was founded with those that derived from the [[French Revolution]]".&lt;ref&gt;"Essentiellement une tendance, chez des catholiques sincères, à exalter la liberté comme valeur première avec les conséquences que cela entraîne pour les principes qui régissent la vie sociale, politique et religieuse : on en vient à vouloir concilier des inconciliables, les principes sur lesquels étaient fondés la France chrétienne et ceux qui découlent de la Révolution" (Arnaud de Lassus, ''Connaissance élémentaire du Libéralisme catholique'', 1988).&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The movement of liberal Catholicism was initiated in France by [[Hugues Felicité Robert de Lamennais]] with the support of [[Jean-Baptiste Henri Lacordaire]], [[Charles Forbes René de Montalembert]] and [[Olympe-Philippe Gerbet]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Perpignan-Elne|Bishop of Perpignan]], while a parallel movement arose in Belgium, led by [[François Antoine Marie Constantin de Méan et de Beaurieux]], [[Archbishop of Mechelen]], and his vicar general [[Engelbert Sterckx]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=jRQ9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA77&amp;dq=%22Liberal+Catholic+movement%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=PUhnTsLPJYeCOrj7sOAL&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Liberal%20Catholic%20movement%22&amp;f=false J. P. T. Bury, ''The New Cambridge Modern History: The Zenith of European Power, 1830-70'' (Cambridge University Press 1960] {{ISBN|978-0-521-04548-3}}), p. 77&lt;/ref&gt;

Lamennais founded  the newspaper ''L'Ami de l'Ordre'' (precursor of today's ''[[L'Avenir (Belgian newspaper)|L'Avenir]]''), the first issue of which appeared on 16 October 1830, with the motto "God and Liberty". The paper was aggressively democratic, demanding rights of local administration, an enlarged suffrage, [[separation of church and state]], universal [[Freedom of thought|freedom of conscience]], freedom of education, [[freedom of assembly]], and [[freedom of the press]]. Styles of worship were to be criticized, improved or abolished in absolute submission to the spiritual, not to the temporal authority.

On 7 December 1830, the editors articulated their demands as follows:
{{quote|We firstly ask for the freedom of conscience or the freedom of full universal religion, without distinction as without privilege; and by consequence, in what touches us, we Catholics, for the total separation of church and state&amp;nbsp;... this necessary separation, without which there would exist for Catholics no religious freedom, implies, for a part, the suppression of the ecclesiastical budget, and we have fully recognized this; for another part, the absolute independence of the clergy in the spiritual order&amp;nbsp;... Just as there can be nothing religious today in politics there must be nothing political in religion.

We ask, secondly, for freedom of education, because it is a natural right, and thus to say, the first freedom of the family; because there exists without it neither religious freedom nor freedom of expression.}}

With the help of Montalembert, Lammenais founded the ''{{lang|fr|Agence générale pour la défense de la liberté religieuse}}'', which became a far-reaching organization with agents throughout France who monitored violations of religious freedom. As a result, the periodical's career was stormy and its circulation opposed by conservative bishops. In response, Lamennais, Montalembert and Lacordaire suspended their work and in November 1831 set out to Rome to obtain the approval of [[Pope Gregory XVI]]. They were received in audience, but after they had left Rome, the 1832 encyclical ''[[Mirari vos]]'' condemned religious pluralism in general and certain of Lamennais's ideas advanced in ''L'Avenir'' without mentioning his name. After this, Lamennais and his two lieutenants declared that out of deference to the pope they would not resume the publication of ''L'Avenir'' and dissolved the ''Agence générale'' as well. Lamennais soon distanced himself from the Catholic Church, which was a blow to the credibility of the liberal Catholic movement, and the other two moderated their tone, but still campaigned for liberty of religious education and liberty of association.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=EyXZJ3j_kEEC&amp;pg=PA33&amp;dq=%22Liberal+Catholic+movement%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=PUhnTsLPJYeCOrj7sOAL&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Liberal%20Catholic%20movement%22&amp;f=false Parker Thomas Moon, ''The Labor Problem and the Social Catholic Movement in France'' (Macmillan 1921), pp. 32-34]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Congress of Belgium]], an alliance between Catholics and secular liberals on the basis of mutually recognized rights and freedoms,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=yZ8OAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA339&amp;dq=%22Liberal+Catholic+movement%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=nHZnTs3WJcmD-wbwurT2Cw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAjhG#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Liberal%20Catholic%20movement%22&amp;f=false Stuart Joseph Woolf, ''A History of Italy, 1700-1860'' (Routledge 1979] {{ISBN|978-0-416-80880-3}}), p. 339&lt;/ref&gt; adopted in 1831 a [[Constitution of Belgium|constitution]] that enshrined several of the freedoms for which liberal Catholicism campaigned.  The [[Congress Column]] in [[Brussels]], erected in honour of the congress, has at its base four bronze statues that represent the four basic freedoms enshrined in the constitution: [[freedom of religion]], [[freedom of association]], [[freedom of education|education]] and [[freedom of the press]]. These four freedoms are also reflected in the names of the four streets that lead to the ''Place de la Liberté/Vrijheidsplein'' (Freedom Square) of Brussels: the ''Rue des Cultes/Eredienststraat'' (Religion Street), the ''Rue de l'Association/Verenigingsstraat'' (Association Street), the ''Rue de l'Enseignement/Onderrichtstraat'' (Education Street) and the ''Rue de la Presse/Drukpersstraat'' (Press Street). The constitution adopted almost all of Lamennais's proposals for the separation of church and state, granting the Catholic Church independence in church appointments and public activities, and almost complete supervision of Catholic education.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=lsC6pLGXzv8C&amp;pg=PA21&amp;dq=%22Liberal+Catholic+movement%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=WW9nToHtKM6VOtDriOIL&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwBzgU#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Liberal%20Catholic%20movement%22&amp;f=false Ellen Lovell Evans, ''The cross and the Ballot'' (Brill Academic Publishers 1999] {{ISBN|978-0-391-04095-3}}), p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

In 19th-century Italy, the liberal Catholic movement had a lasting impact in that it ended the association of the ideal of national independence with that of anti-clerical revolution.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mikuláš Teich]], [[Roy Porter]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=Hu2SnETtV3kC&amp;pg=PA86&amp;dq=%22Liberal+Catholic+movement%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=KGtnTt-_OciaOtCv-c4L&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CFcQ6AEwCTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Liberal%20Catholic%20movement%22&amp;f=false ''The National Question in Europe in Historical Context'' (Cambridge University Press 1993] {{ISBN|978-0-521-36713-4}}), p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=vgo9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA49&amp;dq=%22Liberal+Catholic+movement%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=L3RnTomFKY-M-wbG5KX0Cw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwATge#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Liberal%20Catholic%20movement%22&amp;f=false Paul Ginsborg, ''Daniele Manin and the Venetian revolution of 1848-49'' (Cambridge University Press 1979] {{ISBN|978-0-521-22077-4}}), p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

'''License compatibility''' is a legal framework that allows for pieces of software with different [[software license]]s to be distributed together. The need for such a framework arises because the different licenses can contain contradictory requirements, rendering it impossible to legally combine [[source code]] from separately-licensed software in order to create and publish a new program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.linuxdevices.com/articles/AT7188273245.html/ |title=How GPLv3 tackles license proliferation |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071218201111/http://www.linuxdevices.com/articles/AT7188273245.html |publisher=LinuxDevices.com |first=Ciaran |last=O'Riordan |date=2006-11-10 |archivedate=2007-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lwn.net/Articles/481386/|title=Gray areas in software licensing |date=2012-02-15|first=Dave |last=Neary |publisher=Eklektix |website=LWN.net |accessdate=2016-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{fv|reason=This LWN source _uses_ the term. The cited sentence  _defines_ the term; the source does not.|date=December 2016}}

== Definitions ==
License compatibility can be defined around the concepts of "collective/combined/aggregated work" and "[[derivative work]]". The first "[[collective work]]" license compatibility definition allows the usage of variously-licensed works in a combined context: {{quote|the characteristic of two (or more) licenses according to which the codes distributed under these licenses may be put together in order {{em|to create a bigger distributable software}}. [emphasis added]|Philippe Laurent| The GPLv3 and Compatibility Issues|EOLE 2008&lt;ref name="Laurent"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eolevent.eu/eole-2008-gplv3-and-european-law/sessions/gplv3-and-compatibility-issues |work=European Open Source Lawyers Event 2008 |date=2008-09-24 |accessdate=2015-05-30 |first=Philippe |last=Laurent |publisher=European OpenSource &amp; Free Software Law Event |format=PDF |title=The GPLv3 and compatibility issues}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}}{{better source|date=August 2016}}}}

A stronger definition includes the capability to change the license. The most prominent example is the [[copyleft license]]'s demand that the "derived work" combined from code under various licenses as whole is applied to the copyleft license.{{quote|License compatibility: The characteristic of a license according to which the code distributed under this license may be integrated into a bigger software that will be {{em|distributed under another license}}.

[[File:Software-license-compatiblity-graph.svg|thumb|400px|License compatibility for ''derived works'' and ''combined works'' of a developer's own code and externally developed open-source-licensed code (adapted from Välimäki 2005&lt;ref name="mikko2005" /&gt;{{rp|119}})]]
A ''combined work'' consists of multiple differently-licensed parts (avoiding [[Software relicensing|relicensing]]). To achieve a combined work including copyleft licensed components (which have a [[viral license|viral]] property leading potentially to a ''derived work''), proper isolation/separation needs to be maintained.

With individually licensed [[source code]] files, multiple non-reciprocal licenses (such as permissive licenses or own proprietary code) can be separated, while the combined compiled program could be re-licensed (but that is not required). Such source-code file separation is too weak for copyleft/reciprocal licenses (such as the GPL), as they then require the complete work to be re-licensed under the reciprocal license as being derivative.

A slightly stronger approach is to have separation at the [[Link time|linking stage]] with binary [[object code]] ([[Static library|static linking]]), where all the components of the resulting program are part of the same [[Process (computing)|process]] and [[address space]]. This satisfies "weak copyleft/standard reciprocal" combined works (such as LGPL licensed ones), but not "strong copyleft/strong reciprocal" combined works. While it is commonly accepted that linking ([[Static library|static]] and even [[dynamic linking]]) constitutes a derivative of a strong copyleft'd work,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Lewis Galoob Toys, Inc. v.

For combined works with "strong copyleft" modules, a stronger isolation is required. This can be achieved by separating the programs by an own [[Process (computing)|process]] and allowing communication only via binary [[Application binary interface|ABIs]] or other indirect means.&lt;ref name="aggregation"/&gt; Examples are [[Android (OS)|Android]]'s [[kernel space]]-to-[[user space]] separation via [[Bionic (software)|Bionic]], or [[Linux distro]]s which have proprietary [[binary blob]]s included despite having a strong copyleft [[Linux kernel|kernel]].&lt;ref name="mikko2005"&gt;{{cite thesis|degree=Ph.D.|url=http://lib.tkk.fi/Diss/2005/isbn9529187793/ |title=The Rise of Open Source Licensing: A Challenge to the Use of Intellectual Property in the Software industry |first=Mikko |last=Välimäki |publisher=Helsinki University of Technology |year=2005 |accessdate=2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="redhat2005"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.redhat.com/f/summitfiles/presentation/May31/Open%20Source%20Dynamics/Troan_OpenSourceProprietyPersp.pdf |year=2005 |accessdate=2015-12-29 |title=Open Source from a Proprietary Perspective |first=Larry |last=Troan |work=[[Red Hat]] Summit 2006 |format=PDF |publisher=Red Hat |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306062502/https://www.redhat.com/f/summitfiles/presentation/May31/Open%20Source%20Dynamics/Troan_OpenSourceProprietyPersp.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While for some domains agreement exists if an isolation is suitable, there are domains in dispute and up to now untested in court. For instance, in 2015 the [[Software Freedom Conservancy|SFC]] sued [[VMware]] in an ongoing dispute whether [[loadable kernel module]]s (LKM's) are derivative works of the GPL'd [[Linux kernel]] or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://torekeland.com/blog/new-lawsuit-targets-shims-between-linux-and-proprietary-code|title=New Lawsuit Targets 'Shims' Between Linux and Proprietary Code |website=Tor Ekeland, P.C.|first=Aaron|last=Williamson|date=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sfconservancy.org/news/2015/mar/05/vmware-lawsuit/ |title=Conservancy Announces Funding for GPL Compliance Lawsuit|author=&lt;!-- no byline --&gt;|website=Software Freedom Conservancy|date=2015-03-05|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Compatibility of FOSS licenses ==
[[File:Floss-license-slide-image.png|thumb|400px |License compatibility between common [[FOSS]] [[software license]]s according to [[David A. Wheeler]] (2007): the arrows denote a one directional compatibility, therefore better compatibility on the left side than on the right side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/floss-license-slide.html|title= The Free-Libre / Open Source Software (FLOSS) License Slide|first= David A.|last= Wheeler |website=David A. Wheeler's Personal Home Page|date=2007-09-27|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sps|date=July 2016}}]]
[[Open-source license|Licenses]] common to [[free and open-source software]] (FOSS) are not necessarily compatible with each other,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osscc.net/pdf/QualipsoA1D113.pdf|format=PDF|title=Report on Problem Scope and Definition about OSS License Compatibility|publisher=Qualipso|first=Thomas F.|last=Gordon|date=2010-06-15|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this can make it legally impossible to mix (or [[linker (computing)|link]]) [[open-source software|open-source]] code if the components have different licenses. For example, software that combined code released under version 1.1 of the [[Mozilla Public License]] (MPL) with code under the [[GNU General Public License]] (GPL) could not be distributed without violating one of the terms of the licenses;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mozilla.org/MPL/1.1/FAQ.html |title=MPL 1.1 FAQ - Historical Use Only |date= |website=[[Mozilla]] |accessdate=26 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=December 2015}} this despite both licenses being approved by both the [[Open Source Initiative]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.opensource.org/licenses/MPL-1.1 |title=Open Source Initiative OSI - Mozilla Public License 1.1 (MPL-1.1) :Licensing |publisher=[[Open Source Initiative]] |accessdate=26 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Free Software Foundation]].&lt;ref name="gpl-incompat"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#GPLIncompatibleLicenses |title=GPL-Incompatible Free Software Licenses |date=2016-07-08 |website=GNU Project|publisher=Free Software Foundation |accessdate=2012-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

License compatibility between a [[copyleft license]] and another license is often only a one-way compatibility, making the copyleft license (GPL, and most other copyleft licenses) incompatible with proprietary commercial licenses, as well as with many non-proprietary licenses.&lt;ref name="GPLVincomaptible"&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20011222205401/http://icfcst.kiev.ua/panorama/OSS/bsd_vs_gpl.shtml |title=Comparative merits of GPL, BSD and Artistic licences (Critique of Viral Nature of GPL v.2 - or In Defense of Dual Licensing Idea) |archivedate=2001-12-22 |url=http://icfcst.kiev.ua/panorama/OSS/bsd_vs_gpl.shtml |first=Nikolai|last=Bezroukov|authorlink=Nikolai Bezroukov |quote=Viral property stimulates proliferation of licenses and contributes to the 'GPL-enforced nightmare' -- a situation when many other licenses are logically incompatible with the GPL and make life unnecessary difficult for developers working in the Linux environment (KDE is a good example here, Python is a less known example). |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sps|date=July 2016}}&lt;ref name="fogel2005"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://producingoss.com/en/license-compatibility.html#idp10181728 |title=The GPL and License Compatibility|work=Producing Open Source Software - How to Run a Successful Free Software Project|first=Karl |last=Fogel |publisher= |date= |quote=The GPL and license compatibility - Because the primary goal of the GPL's authors is the promotion of free software, they deliberately crafted the license to make it impossible to mix GPLed code into proprietary programs.

The [[Common Development and Distribution License]] (CDDL)—a weak [[copyleft]] license in-between the [[GPL]] license and [[BSD license|BSD]]/[[MIT license|MIT]] [[permissive license]]s—tries to address license compatibility problems by permitting, without re-licensing, the mixing of CDDL-licensed source-code files with source-code files under other licenses by providing that the resulting binary can be licensed and sold under a different license as long as the source code is still available under CDDL.&lt;ref name="whyCDDL"&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050214114513/http://www.sun.com/cddl/CDDL_why_summary.html|url=http://www.sun.com/cddl/CDDL_why_summary.html|title=Common Development and Distribution License (CDDL) Description and High-Level Summary of Changes|website=Sun Microsystems|archivedate=2005-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/mcnealy-cddl-is-best-of-both-worlds/|title=McNealy: CDDL is 'best of both worlds'|website=ZDNet|first=Aaron|last= Tan|date=2005-09-14|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tldrlegal.com/license/common-development-and-distribution-license-%28cddl-1.0%29-explained|title=Common Development and Distribution License (CDDL-1.0) |website=tl;drLegal |publisher=FOSSA |date=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{ugc|date=July 2016}}

=== GPL compatibility ===
{{See also|GNU General Public License#Compatibility and multi-licensing}}
To minimize [[license proliferation]] and license incompatibilities in the [[Free and open-source software|FOSS]] ecosystem, some organizations (the Free Software Foundation, for instance) and individuals ([[David A. Wheeler]]), argue that [[GPL#Compatibility and multi-licensing|compatibility]] with the widely used GPL is an important feature of software licenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/gpl-compatible.html|title=Make Your Open Source Software GPL-Compatible. Or Else.|first=David A.|last=Wheeler|website=David A. Wheeler's Personal Home Page|date=2014-02-16|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sps|date=July 2016}} Many of the most common free-software licenses, especially the [[permissive license]]s, such as the original [[MIT License|MIT/X license]], [[BSD licenses]] (in the three-clause and two-clause forms, though not the original four-clause form), MPL 2.0, and [[GNU Lesser General Public License|LGPL]], are ''GPL-compatible''. That is, their code can be combined with a program under the GPL without conflict, and the new combination would have the GPL applied to the whole (but the other license would not so apply).

==== Copyleft licenses and GPL ====
[[Copyleft]] software licenses are not inherently GPL-compatible; even the GPLv2 license by itself is not compatible with GPLv3 or LGPLv3.&lt;ref name="gnufaq" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1390172&amp;seqNum=3|title=The Failure of the GPL |first=David |last=Chisnall |date=2009-08-31 |accessdate=2016-01-24|publisher=Pearson Education|website=InformIT|quote=The GPL places additional restrictions on the code, and therefore is incompatible. You can combine APSL, MPL, CDDL, Apache, and BSD-licensed code in the same project easily, but you can only combine one of these with GPLv2 code. Even the Free Software Foundation can't manage to get it right. Version 3 of the LGPL, for example, is incompatible with version 2 of the GPL. This has caused a problem recently for a few GNU library projects that wanted to move to LGPLv3 but were used by other projects that were GPLv2-only.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://repository.law.umich.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1074&amp;context=mttlr |work=Michigan Telecommunications and Technology Law Review|volume=14|issue=2|title= The General Public License Version 3.0: Making or Breaking the Foss Movement |publisher=TheUniversity of Michigan Law School |first=Clark D. |last=Asay}}&lt;/ref&gt; If you tried to combine code released under either of the later GPL licenses with GPLv2 code, you would violate section 6 of GPLv2, the source of the incompatibility.

==== GFDL and GPL ====
The Free Software Foundation-recommended [[GNU Free Documentation License]]&lt;ref name="gnufaq" /&gt; is incompatible with the GPL license, and text licensed under the GFDL cannot be incorporated into GPL software.{{citation needed|reason=issue not covered in GNU FAQ mentioned elsewhere|date=October 2018}} Therefore, the [[Debian]] project decided, in a 2006 resolution, to license documentation under the GPL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Debian|url=http://www.debian.org/vote/2006/vote_001.en.html#amendmenttexta|title=Resolution: Why the GNU Free Documentation License is not suitable for Debian|date=2006-03-12|accessdate=2009-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[FLOSS Manuals]] foundation followed Debian in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.flossmanuals.net/bin/view/Blog/LicenseChange|archive-url=https://archive.is/20080228211105/http://en.flossmanuals.net/bin/view/Blog/LicenseChange|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2008-02-28|title=License Change|date=2007-06-06|accessdate=2009-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the Wikimedia Foundation switched from the GFDL to a [[Creative Commons]] CC-BY-SA license as the main license for their projects.&lt;ref name="wmf2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wp2009"/&gt;

==== CDDL and GPL ====
Another case where GPL compatibility is problematic is the [[CDDL]] licensed [[ZFS]] file system with the GPLv2 licensed [[Linux kernel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zfsonlinux.org/faq.html#WhatAboutTheLicensingIssue |title=2.2 What is the licensing concern? |website=zfsonlinux.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100926104451/http://zfsonlinux.org/faq.html |archivedate=2010-09-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite that both are free software under a copyleft license, ZFS is not distributed with most [[linux distro]]s like [[Debian]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|format=email message|url=http://list.zfsonlinux.org/pipermail/zfs-discuss/2014-August/018505.html |quote=Upstream ZoL project [3] holds the view that in this case the combination of the two in the same binary would create a derived work, so this is not acceptable for redistribution.

We must do so, because, too often, companies are complacent about compliance.

=== Creative Commons license compatibility ===

The [[Creative Commons License]]s are widely used for content, but not all combinations of the seven recommended and supported licenses are compatible with each other.

=== JSON license ===
[[JSON]] developer [[Douglas Crockford]], inspired by the words of then President Bush, formulated the "evil-doers" JSON license ("The Software shall be used for Good, not Evil.") in order to open-source the JSON libraries but also to force ([[Copyright troll|troll]]) corporate lawyers (or those who are overly pedantic) to pay for a license from the state. The subjective and moral license clause led to [[license incompatibility]] problems with other [[open source license]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[https://lwn.net/Articles/707510/ Apache and the JSON license] on LWN.net by Jake Edge (November 30, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; and resulted in the JSON license not being a free and open-source license.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#JSON JSON] on gnu.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://tanguy.ortolo.eu/blog/article46/json-license JSON License considered harmful] by Tanguy Ortolo (09-03-2012)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Licensing:Main JSON License 	No ] on Fedoraproject.org&lt;/ref&gt;

== Re-licensing for compatibility ==
Sometimes projects wind up with incompatible licenses, and the only feasible way to solve it is the re-licensing of the incompatible parts. Re-licensing is achieved by contacting all involved developers and other parties and getting their agreement for the changed license. While in the [[free and open-source]] domain achieving 100% agreement is often impossible, due to the many contributors involved, the [[Mozilla]] re-licensing project assumes that achieving 95% is enough for the re-licensing of the complete code base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.fsfe.org/ciaran/?p=58 |title=(About GPLv3) Can the Linux Kernel Relicense? |first=Ciaran |last=O’Riordan |date=2006-10-06 |accessdate=2015-05-28 |publisher=Free Software Foundation Europe |quote=Someone who works with many lawyers on free software copyright issues later told me that it is not necessary to get permission from 100% of the copyright holders. It would suffice if there was permission from the copyright holders of 95% of the source code and no objections from the holders of the other 5%. This, I’m told, is how Mozilla was able to re-license to the GPL in 2003 despite years of community contributions.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?&lt;!-- This is hearsay. The quote is quite clear about that. --&gt;|date=July 2016}} Others in the FOSS domain, such as [[Eric S. Raymond]], came to different conclusions regarding the requirements for re-licensing of an entire code base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catb.org/~esr/Licensing-HOWTO.html|title=Licensing HOWTO|first=Eric Steven|last=Raymond|first2=Catherine Olanich|last2=Raymond|quote=Changing an existing license […] You can change the license on a piece of code under any of the following conditions: If you are the sole copyright holder […] If you are the sole registered copyright holder […] If you obtain the consent of all other copyright holders […] If no other copyright holder could be harmed by the change.|date=|accessdate=2015-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Vorbis]] library was originally licensed as [[LGPL]], but in 2001, with the endorsement of [[Richard Stallman]], the license was changed to the less restrictive [[BSD license]], to accelerate the library's adoption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite  web|format=email message|url=http://lists.xiph.org/pipermail/vorbis/2001-February/001758.html|title=[vorbis] Xiph.org announces Vorbis Beta 4 and the Xiph.org Foundation|website=Xiph.Org|quote=With the Beta 4 release, the Ogg Vorbis libraries have moved to the BSD license.  The change from LGPL to BSD was made to enable the use of Ogg Vorbis in all forms of software and hardware.  Jack Moffitt says, 'We are changing the license in response to feedback from many parties. It has become clear to us that adoption of Ogg Vorbis will be accelerated even further by the use of a less restrictive license that is friendlier toward proprietary software and hardware systems. We want everyone to be able to use Ogg Vorbis.'|first=Jack|last=Moffitt|date=2001-02-26|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lwn.net/2001/0301/a/rms-ov-license.php3|title=RMS on the Ogg Vorbis license|first=Richard|last=Stallman|website=LWN.net|date=2001-02-26|accessdate=|format=email message}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[VLC media player|VLC]] project has a complicated license history due to license incompatibility, and in 2007 the project decided, for license compatibility, to not upgrade to the just released [[GPLv3]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.videolan.org/press/2007-1.html |title=VLC media player to remain under GNU GPL version 2 |quote=In 2001, VLC was released under the OSI-approved GNU General Public version 2, with the commonly-offered option to use 'any later version' thereof (though there was not any such later version at the time). Following the release by the Free Software Foundation (FSF) of the new version 3 of its GNU General Public License (GPL) on the 29th of June 2007, contributors to the VLC media player, and other software projects hosted at videolan.org, debated the possibility of updating the licensing terms for future version of the VLC media player and other hosted projects, to version 3 of the GPL. […]  There is strong concern that these new additional requirements might not match the industrial and economic reality of our time, especially in the market of consumer electronics. It is our belief that changing our licensing terms to GPL version 3 would currently not be in the best interest of our community as a whole. Consequently, we plan to keep distributing future versions of VLC media player under the terms of the GPL version 2. […] we will continue to distribute the VLC media player source code under GPL 'version 2 or any later version' until further notice. |publisher=VideoLAN|date=|accessdate=2015-11-21|first=Rémi |last=Denis-Courmont }}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2011, after the VLC had been removed from the [[Apple App Store]] at the start of 2011, the VLC project re-licensed the VLC library, from the GPLv2 to the LGPLv2, to achieve better compatibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Changing the VLC engine license to LGPL|url=http://www.videolan.org/press/lgpl.html |date=2011-09-07|accessdate=2011-10-23|first=Jean-Baptiste|last=Kempf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vaughan-Nichols|first=Steven J.|title=No GPL Apps for Apple's App Store |url=http://www.zdnet.com/blog/open-source/no-gpl-apps-for-apples-app-store/8046|date=2011-01-08|accessdate=2011-08-23|website=ZDNet}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2013, the software re-licensed under the [[Mozilla Public License]], the VLC application would then be resubmitted to the [[iOS App Store]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/apple/2013/07/vlc-media-player-returns-to-the-ios-app-store-after-30-month-hiatus/|title=VLC media player returns to the iOS App Store after 30-month hiatus|website=[[Ars Technica]]|first=Casey|last=Johnston|date=2013-07-18|accessdate=2013-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Free Software Foundation's [[GNU Free Documentation License]] version 1.2 is not compatible with the widely used [[Creative Commons]] [[Creative Commons licenses|Attribution-ShareAlike]] license, which was a problem for [[Wikipedia]], for instance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://notablog.notafish.com/post/2005/04/21/26-why-the-wikimedia-projects-should-not-use-gfdl-as-a-stand-alone-license-for-images|title=Why the Wikimedia projects should not use GFDL as a stand alone license for images|website=notablog|first=Delphine|last=Ménard}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sps|date=July 2016}} Therefore, at the request of the [[Wikimedia Foundation]], the FSF added a time-limited section, to version 1.3 of the GFDL, that allowed specific types of websites using the GFDL to additionally offer their work under the CC BY-SA license.&lt;ref name="onepoint3faq"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/licenses/fdl-1.3-faq.html |title=GFDL v1.3 FAQ |publisher=Free Software Foundation|website=GNU Project |date=2014-04-12 |accessdate=2011-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this, in June 2009, the [[Wikimedia Foundation]] migrated their projects ([[Wikipedia]], etc.) by [[Multi-licensing|dual licensing]] to the [[Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike]] as its main license, in addition to the previously used [[GNU Free Documentation License|GFDL]],&lt;ref name="wmf2009"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Resolution:Licensing_update_approval|title=Resolution:Licensing update approval|website=Wikimedia Foundation|date=2009-05-23|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; so as to have improved license compatibility with the greater [[free content]] ecosystem.&lt;ref name="wp2009"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/15411|title=Wikipedia + CC BY-SA = Free Culture Win!|website=Creative Commons|first=Mike|last=Linksvayer|date=2009-06-22|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.wikimedia.org/2009/06/30/licensing-update-rolled-out-in-all-wikimedia-wikis/|title=Licensing update rolled out in all Wikimedia wikis|website=Wikimedia Blog|authorlink=Erik Moeller|first=Erik|last=Moeller|date=2009-06-30|accessdate=|quote=Perhaps the most significant reason to choose CC-BY-SA as our primary content license was to be compatible with many of the other admirable endeavors out there to share and develop free knowledge.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another interesting case was [[Google]]'s re-licensing of GPLv2-licensed [[Linux kernel]] [[header file]]s to the [[BSD license]] for their [[Android (OS)|Android]] library [[Bionic (software)|Bionic]]. Google claimed that the header files were clean of any copyright-able work, reducing them to non-copyrightable "facts", and thus not covered by the GPL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/03/29/google_android_and_the_linux_headers/|title=Google's 'clean' Linux headers: Are they really that dirty?|website=The Register|date=2011-03-29|accessdate=|first=Cade|last=Metz}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itworld.com/article/2744480/open-source-tools/android--sued-by-microsoft--not-by-linux.html|title=Android: Sued by Microsoft, not by Linux|quote=Microsoft launches new Android suit, Linus Torvalds' take on Linux kernel headers and Android|website=[[ITworld]]|date=2011-03-21|accessdate=|first=Brian|last=Proffitt}}&lt;/ref&gt; This interpretation was challenged by Raymond Nimmer, a law professor at the [[University of Houston Law Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipinfoblog.com/archives/licensing-law-issues-infringement-and-disclosure-risk-in-development-on-copyleft-platforms.html/ |title=Infringement and disclosure risk in development on copyleft platforms |website=Contemporary Intellectual Property, Licensing &amp; Information Law |first=Raymond |last=Nimmer |date=2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160107055215/http://www.ipinfoblog.com/archives/licensing-law-issues-infringement-and-disclosure-risk-in-development-on-copyleft-platforms.html |archivedate=2016-01-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the [[FreeCAD]] project changed their license from GPL to LGPLv2, due to GPLv3/GPLv2 incompatibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://libregraphicsworld.org/blog/entry/libredwg-drama-the-end-or-the-new-beginning |title=LibreDWG drama: the end or the new beginning? |first=Alexandre |last=Prokoudine |date=2012-12-27 |quote=[…] the unfortunate situation with support for DWG files in free CAD software via LibreDWG.

[[File:Eugène Delacroix - Le Massacre de Scio.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.36|
''Le Massacre de Scio'' ("The [[Chios massacre]]") of tens of thousands of Greeks in 1824 (painting by [[Eugène Delacroix]]).]]
A '''massacre''' is a killing, typically of [[mass killing|multiple victims]], considered [[moral judgement|morally unacceptable]], especially when 
perpetrated by a group of [[political faction|political actors]] against defenseless victims.
The word is a loan of a French term for "butchery" or "carnage".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.dictionary.com/browse/massacre |title = the definition of massacre |author =  |date =  |website = Dictionary.com |accessdate = November 24, 2017 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20161123085146/http://www.dictionary.com/browse/massacre |archivedate = November 23, 2016 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no objective definition of what constitutes a "massacre". Various international organisations have proposed  a formal definition of the term "[[crimes against humanity]]", which would however include incidents of [[persecution]] or abuse that do not result in deaths.&lt;ref name="Crimes Against Humanity"&gt;M. Cherif Bassiouni,[http://www.crimesofwar.org/a-z-guide/crimes-against-humanity/ "Crimes Against Humanity"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150320061808/http://www.crimesofwar.org/a-z-guide/crimes-against-humanity/ |date=2015-03-20 }} The Crimes of War Project&lt;/ref&gt;
Conversely, a "massacre" is not necessarily a "crime against humanity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Gallant |first1 = Thomas W. |authorlink = Thomas W. Gallant |title = review of Levene, Roberts The Massacre in History |journal = Crime, History &amp; Societies |date = 2001 |volume = 5 |issue = 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Other terms with overlapping scope include [[war crime]], [[pogrom]], [[mass killing]], [[mass murder]], and [[extrajudicial killing]].

== Etymology ==

The modern definition of ''massacre'' as "indiscriminate slaughter, carnage", and the subsequent verb of this form, derive from late 16th century Middle French, evolved from Middle French ''"macacre, macecle"'' meaning "slaughterhouse, butchery". Further origins are dubious, though may be related to Latin ''macellum'' "provisions store, butcher shop".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = (Archived) Merriam-Webster: Massacre |url = https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/massacre |website = Merriam-Webster.com |accessdate = January 8, 2017 |deadurl = bot: unknown |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170108082002/https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/massacre |archivedate = January 8, 2017 |df = }}

The [[Middle French]] word ''macecre'' "butchery, carnage" is first recorded in the late 11th century.  Its primary use remained the context of animal slaughter (in hunting terminology referring to the head of a stag) well into the 18th century.
The use of ''macecre'' "butchery" of the mass killing of people dates to the 12th century, implying people being "slaughtered like animals".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnrtl.fr/etymologie/massacre Trésor de la Langue Française informatisé]&lt;/ref&gt;
The term did not necessarily imply a large number of victims, e.g. [[Fénelon]] in ''Dialogue des Morts''  (1712) uses ''l'horride massacre de [[Château de Blois|Blois]]'' ("the horrid ''massacre'' at [the chateau of] Blois") of the assassination of [[Henry I, Duke of Guise]] (1588), while 
[[Nicolas Boileau-Despréaux|Boileau]], ''Satires XI'' (1698) has ''L'Europe fut un champ de massacre et d'horreur'' "Europe was a field of ''massacre'' and horror" of the [[European wars of religion]].

The French word is loaned into English in the 1580s, specifically in the sense "indiscriminate slaughter of a large number of people".
It is used in reference to [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre]] in ''[[The Massacre at Paris]]'' by [[Christopher Marlow]]. The term is again used  in 1695 for the [[Sicilian Vespers]] of 1281,&lt;!--sic, dated 1281 in the source cited; Wikipedia has 1282, find out if this is certain and who corrected the date--&gt; called "that famous Massacre of the French in Sicily" in the English translation of  ''De quattuor monarchiis'' by [[Johannes Sleidanus]] (1556),
&lt;ref&gt;'' De Quatuor Summis Imperiis: An Historical Account of the Four Chief Monarchies Or Empires of the World'', Nathaniel Rolls (1695), p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt;
translating ''illa memorabilis Gallorum clades per Siciliam'', i.e. ''massacre'' is here used as the translation of Latin ''[[:wikt:clades#Latin|clades]]'' "hammering, breaking; destruction".&lt;ref&gt;''Sleidani de quatuor monarchiis libri tres'' ed. Felicen Lopez de Haro (1669), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=aF9iU6S6XpUC&amp;pg=PA301 p. 301]&lt;/ref&gt;
The term's use in historiography was popularized by Gibbon's ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire|History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'' (1781&amp;ndash;1789), who used e.g. "[[massacre of the Latins]]" of the killing of Roman Catholics in Constantinople in 1182.

An early use in the propagandistic portrayal of current events was the "[[Boston Massacre]]" of 1770, which was employed to build support for the [[American Revolution]]. A pamphlet with the title ''A short narrative of the horrid massacre in Boston, perpetrated in the evening of the fifth day of March, 1770, by soldiers of the 29th regiment'' was printed in Boston still in 1770.&lt;ref&gt;The shortened name "Boston massacre" was in use by the early 1800s (Benjamin Austin, Constitutional Republicanism, in Opposition to Fallacious Federalism, 1803, p. 314). 
The term "[[Massacre Day]]" for the annual remembrance held during 1771–1783 dates to the late 19th century (Augusta De Grasse Stevens, Old Boston: An American Historical Romance, 1888, p. 126) The 1772 "Massacre Day of Oration" by [[Joseph Warren]] was originally titled ''An Oration Delivered March 5th, 1772. At the Request of the Inhabitants of the Town of Boston; to Commemorate the Bloody Tragedy of the Fifth of March, 1770''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''massacre'' began to see inflationary use in journalism first half of the 20th century. By the 1970s, it could also be used purely metaphorically, 
of events that do not involve deaths, such as the [[Saturday Night Massacre]]—the dismissals and resignations of political appointees during [[Richard Nixon]]'s [[Watergate scandal]].

== Definitions ==
{{see|List of events named massacres}}
The term ''massacre'', being a synonym of "butchery, carnage", is by nature hyperbolic or subjective, primarily used in partisan descriptions of events. 
There is no neutral definition of what constitutes a "massacre" although some authors using the term may lay down general "working definitions" of what they mean by the term. 

Thus,  [[Robert Melson]] (1982) in the context of the "[[Hamidian massacres]]" used a "basic working definition" of "by massacre we shall mean the intentional killing by political actors of a significant number of relatively defenseless people... the motives for massacre need not be rational in order for the killings to be intentional... Mass killings can be carried out for various reasons, including a response to false rumors... political massacre... should be distinguished from criminal or pathological mass killings... as political bodies we of course include the state and its agencies, but also nonstate actors..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Melson |first1 = Robert |title = Theoretical Inquiry into the Armenian Massacres of 1894–1896 |journal = Comparative Studies in Society and History |date = July 1982 |volume = 24 |issue = 3 |pages = 482–3 |doi = 10.1017/s0010417500010100 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, Levene (1999) attempts an objective classification of "massacres" throughout history, taking the term to refer to killings carried out by groups using overwhelming force against defenseless victims. He is excepting certain cases of [[mass execution]]s, requiring that massacres  must have the quality of being [[moral outrage|morally unacceptable]].&lt;ref&gt; "Although it is not possible to set unalterable rules about when multiple murders become massacres. Equally important is the fact that massacres are not carried out by individuals, instead they are carried out by groups... the use of superior, even overwhelming force..." Levene excludes "legal, or even some quasi-legal, mass executions". He also points out that it is "...most often ... when the act is outside the normal moral bounds of the society witnessing it... In any war ... this killing is often acceptable."

'''MaxiCode''' is a [[public domain]], machine-readable symbol system originally created and used by [[United Parcel Service]].  Suitable for tracking and managing the shipment of packages, it resembles a [[barcode]], but uses dots arranged in a [[hexagonal grid]] instead of bars. MaxiCode has been standardised under [[ISO/IEC]] 16023.&lt;ref&gt;ISO/IEC 16023:2000&lt;/ref&gt;

A MaxiCode symbol (internally called "'''Bird's Eye'''", "'''Target'''", "'''dense code'''", or "'''UPS code'''") appears as a 1&amp;nbsp;inch square, with a [[bullseye (target)|bullseye]] in the middle, surrounded by a pattern of hexagonal dots. It can store about 93 characters of information, and up to 8 MaxiCode symbols can be chained together to convey more data.  The centered symmetrical bullseye is useful in automatic symbol location regardless of orientation, and it allows MaxiCode symbols to be scanned even on a package traveling rapidly.

MaxiCode [[symbology]] was released by UPS in 1992.

==Structured Carrier Message==
[[Image:MaxiCode Regions.svg|thumb|400px]]
MaxiCode symbols using modes 2 and 3 include a ''Structured Carrier Message'' containing key information about a package. This information is protected with a strong [[Reed-Solomon error correction]] code, allowing it to be read even if a portion of the symbol is damaged. These fields include:

# A 4-bit indication of the mode in use, currently either mode 2 or mode 3.
# A national or international [[postal code]].  MaxiCode supports both numeric postal codes (e.g. a [[ZIP Code]]), and alphanumeric postal codes.
# A 3-digit [[country code]] encoded per [[ISO 3166]]
# A 3-digit class of service code assigned by the carrier

The structured portion of the message is stored in the inner area of the symbol, near the bull's-eye pattern. (In modes that do not include a structured portion, the inner area simply stores the beginning of the message.)

==Application-specific information==
Irrespective of mode, a variable amount of application-specific information can be encoded in a MaxiCode symbol. This format of this additional data is not strictly defined, and amongst other information may include:

* Purchase order number
* Customer reference
* Invoice number
* Tracking number
* Indicator of the originating carrier

==Modes==
* Mode 0 - Obsolete mode superseded by modes 2 and 3. (Older printers will produce Mode 0 if the firmware is outdated. Mode 0 MaxiCodes can be visually determined by examining the two horizontal hexagons in the upper right-hand corner.  They will be white if the Mode is 0.  For all other modes, they are black.)
* Mode 1 - Obsolete mode superseded by mode 4.
* Mode 2 - Formatted data containing a structured Carrier Message with a numeric postal code.  (Primary use is US domestic destinations.)
* Mode 3 - Formatted data containing a structured Carrier Message with an alphanumeric postal code.  (Primary use is international destinations.)
* Mode 4 - Unformatted data with Standard Error Correction.
* Mode 5 - Unformatted data with Enhanced Error Correction.
* Mode 6 - Used for programming hardware devices.

UPS labels use Mode 2 or Mode 3 MaxiCodes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4143">'''McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting''' or the '''McDonnell-Douglas burden-shifting framework''' refers to the procedure for adjudicating a [[motion for summary judgement]] under a [[Title VII]] [[disparate treatment]] claim, in particular a "private, non-class action challenging employment discrimination",&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green|volume=411|page=792|pin=800|year=1973}}.&lt;/ref&gt; that lacks direct evidence of discrimination. It was introduced by the [[United States Supreme Court]] in ''[[McDonnell Douglas v. Green]]'' and ''[[Texas Dept. of Community Affairs v. Burdine]]'' and has been elaborated on in subsequent cases.

The McDonnell-Douglas framework is typically used when a case lacks direct evidence of discrimination. In other cases, courts may decide not to use the McDonnell-Douglas framework, and instead evaluate disparate treatment claims under the ''[[Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins|Price Waterhouse]]'' [[Mixed motive discrimination|"mixed motive" framework]].

==Framework==
The framework as currently applied by courts is as follows:

#A plaintiff must first establish a ''[[prima facie]]'' case by a preponderance of the evidence, i.e. allege facts that are adequate to support a legal claim. (see [[#Requirements for a prima facie case|the below section for more]])
#Then the burden of production shifts to the employer, to rebut this ''prima facie'' case by "articulat[ing] some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the employee’s rejection."&lt;ref name=McDonnell802&gt;''McDonnell Douglas'', 411 U.S. at 802.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Then the employee may prevail only if he can show that the employer’s response is merely a pretext for behavior actually motivated by discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=St. Mary's Honor Center v. Hicks|volume=509|page=502|pin=|year=1993}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though the employer bears the [[Legal burden of proof#Civil cases of the U.S. Supreme Court|burden of production]] in the second step, the plaintiff bears the burden of persuasion at all times.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Texas Dept. of Community Affairs v. Burdine|link=Texas Department of Community Affairs v. Burdine|volume=450|page=248|pin=255–56|year=1981}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution of the framework==
In ''[[St. Mary's Honor Center v. Hicks]]'', the court revisited the third step in the framework. Initially explaining that affected employee should merely "be afforded a fair opportunity to show that petitioner's stated reason for respondent's rejection was in fact, pretext[,]"&lt;ref&gt;''McDonnell Douglas'', 411 U.S. at 804.&lt;/ref&gt; the court revised its initial guidance and added that the employee must also show that the employer's actions were in fact motivated by discrimination.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Then, in ''[[Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc.]]'', the Court emphasized that "a plaintiff’s prima facie case of [[Age Discrimination in Employment Act|age discrimination]], combined with sufficient evidence to find that the employer’s asserted justification for its action was false, may permit the trier of fact to conclude that the employer unlawfully discriminated," and that the plaintiff need not always introduce additional and independent evidence of discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc.|volume=530|page=133|pin=148–49|year=2000}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Requirements for a ''prima facie'' case==
In his majority opinion in ''[[McDonnell Douglas v. Green|McDonnell Douglas]]'', [[Justice Powell]] also outlined the requirements for the first burden placed on plaintiffs in Title VII trials, i.e., the initial ''prima facie'' showing of discrimination. The plaintiff in such a case must show

#that he belongs to a racial minority;
#that he applied and was qualified for a job for which the employer was seeking applicants;
#that, despite his qualifications, he was rejected; and
#that, after his rejection, the position remained open and the employer continued to seek applicants from persons of complainant's qualifications.&lt;ref name=McDonnell802/&gt;

The '''New Freedom Commission on Mental Health''' was established by [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[George W. Bush]] through {{Executive Order|13263}} on April 29, 2002 to conduct a comprehensive study of the U.S. [[mental health]] service delivery system and make recommendations based on its findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bush |first=George W. |title=President's New Freedom Commission on Mental Health |date=April 29, 2002 |publication-date=May 3, 2002 |journal=Federal Register |volume=67 |pages=22337–22338 |url=https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2002/05/03/02-11166/presidents-new-freedom-commission-on-mental-health }} {{Federal Register|67|22337}}&lt;/ref&gt; The commission has been touted as part of his commitment to eliminate inequality for Americans with disabilities.

The President directed the Commission to identify policies that could be implemented by Federal, State and local governments to maximize the utility of existing resources, improve coordination of treatments and services, and promote successful community integration for adults with a serious [[mental illness]] and children with a [[serious emotional disturbance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Final Report to the President Now Available |website=President's New Freedom Commission on Mental Health |url=http://www.mentalhealthcommission.gov/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050213094608/http://www.mentalhealthcommission.gov/ |archive-date=February 13, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The commission, using the [[Texas Medication Algorithm Project]] (TMAP) as a blueprint, subsequently recommended screening of American adults for possible mental illnesses, and children for emotional disturbances, thereby identifying those with suspected [[disabilities]] who could then be provided with support services and state-of-the-art treatment, often in the form of newer [[psychoactive drug]]s that entered the market in recent years.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

A broad-based coalition of [[mental health]] consumers, families, providers, and advocates has supported the Commission process and recommendations, using the Commission's findings as a launching point for recommending widespread reform of the nation's mental health system.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

A coalition of opponents questioned the motives of the commission, based on the results from a similar 1995 Texas mandate while Bush was Governor. During the [[Texas Medication Algorithm Project]] mandate, psychotropic medication was wrongfully prescribed to the general public. Specifically, TMAP and drug manufacturers marketed 'atypical antipsychotic drugs', such as Seroquel, Zyprexa, and others,&lt;ref&gt;Texas Vendor Drug Program
Drug Use Criteria: Atypical Antipsychotics (oral)
Publication History, https://hhs.texas.gov/sites/default/files//documents/about-hhs/communications-events/meetings-events/dur/110317/dur-agenda10b-171103.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; for a wide variety of non-psychotic behavior issues. These drugs were later found to cause increased rates of sudden death in patients. 

In addition to atypical antipsychotic drugs, earlier versions of psychotropic medications, including Prozac, were found to sharply increase rates of [[suicide]], especially during the first month of drug use.&lt;ref&gt;The Lilly Suicides, A peculiar and troubling case, https://adbusters.org/featured/the-lilly-suicides/&lt;/ref&gt; Also during TMAP, psychotropic medication was wrongfully prescribed to people not suffering from mental illness, including troublesome children and difficult elderly people in nursing homes.&lt;ref&gt;Broadened Use Of Atypical Antipsychotics: Safety, Effectiveness, And Policy Challenges, https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/full/10.1377/hlthaff.28.5.w770&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Eli Lilly was found quilty of wrongfully marketing Zyprexa for non-psychotic people.&lt;ref&gt;Big Pharma’s Big Fines, http://projects.propublica.org/graphics/bigpharma&lt;/ref&gt;

Opponents also assert the New Freedom initiative campaign is a thinly veiled proxy for the [[pharmaceutical industry]] to foster [[psychotropic]] medication on mentally healthy individuals in its pursuit of [[Profit (accounting)|profits]]. Opponents also contend that the initiative's wider objectives are to foster chemical [[behavior]] control of American citizens, contrary to [[civil liberties]] and to basic [[human rights]]. 

==Reports==
===Interim report===
The commission issued an interim report on November 1, 2002. Findings in the report included estimated prevalence of severe mental illness among adults and severe emotional disturbance in children, the existence of effective treatments, and barriers to care.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release |first=Mark |last=Weber |title=Mental Health Commission Releases Interim Report |publisher=President's New Freedom Commission on Mental Health |date=November 1, 2002 |url=http://www.mentalhealthcommission.gov/press/nov1_rpt.htm |archive-date=April 13, 2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050413115345/http://www.mentalhealthcommission.gov/press/nov1_rpt.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Final report===
On July 22, 2003, the President's commission returned a report containing nineteen formal recommendations, organized under six proposed national goals for mental health. The commission emphasised recovery from mental illness, calls for consumer and family-centered care, and recommendations that states develop a more comprehensive approach to mental health.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

The commission reported that "despite their prevalence, mental disorders often go undiagnosed," so it recommended comprehensive mental health screening for "consumers of all ages," including preschool children, because "each year, young children are expelled from preschools and childcare facilities for severely disruptive behaviors and emotional disorders."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Goal 4: Early Mental Health Screening, Assessment, and Referral to Services Are Common Practice |website=President's New Freedom Commission on Mental Health |date=July 22, 2003 |url=http://www.mentalhealthcommission.gov/reports/Finalreport/FullReport-05.htm |archive-date=April 12, 2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050412100816/http://www.mentalhealthcommission.gov/reports/Finalreport/FullReport-05.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contradiction, the [[Congressional Research Service]], stated the commission did not specifically recommend a nationwide screening program for mental illness, while it did discuss the need to identify mental illness in certain settings (juvenile detention facilities, foster care). The commission also recommended deeper study of the safety and effectiveness of medication use, especially among children.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

==Recommendations==
Noting the country's services for people with mental illness and disabilities were "fragmented," the commission's final report offered 19 recommendations within six larger goals to improve service coordination, move toward a [[recovery model]], and help all individuals with mental illness and disability recover:
# Americans Understand that Mental Health Is Essential to Overall Health.
#* Advance and implement a national campaign to reduce the [[Social stigma|stigma]] of seeking care and a national strategy for [[suicide prevention]].
#* Address mental health with the same urgency as physical health.
# Mental Health Care Is [[Mental health consumer|Consumer]] and Family Driven.
#* Develop an individualized plan of care for every adult with a serious mental illness and child with a [[Emotional and behavioral disorders|serious emotional disturbance]].
#* Involve consumers and families fully in orienting the mental health system toward recovery.
#* Align relevant Federal programs to improve access and accountability for mental health services.
#* Create a Comprehensive State Mental Health Plan.
#* Protect and enhance the rights of people with mental illnesses.
# [[Health equity|Disparities]] in Mental Health Services Are Eliminated.

#* Improve access to quality care in rural and geographically remote areas.
# Early Mental Health [[Screening (medicine)|Screening]], Assessment, and [[Referral (medicine)|Referral]] to Services Are Common Practice.
#* Promote the mental health of young children.
#* Improve and expand school mental health programs.
#* Screen for [[Dual diagnosis|co-occurring mental and substance use disorders]] and link with integrated treatment strategies.
#* Screen for mental disorders in [[Primary care|primary health care]], across the life span, and connect to treatment and supports. 
# Excellent Mental Health Care Is Delivered and Research Is Accelerated.
#* Accelerate research to promote recovery and [[Psychological resilience|resilience]], and ultimately to cure and prevent mental illnesses.
#* Advance [[evidence-based practice]]s using [[Science communication|dissemination]] and demonstration projects and create a [[public–private partnership]] to guide their implementation.
#* Improve and expand the workforce providing evidence-based mental health services and supports.
#* Develop the knowledge base in four understudied areas: mental health disparities, long-term effects of medications, [[Psychological trauma|trauma]], and [[Emergency psychiatry|acute care]].
# Technology Is Used to Access Mental Health Care and Information.
#* Use health technology and [[telehealth]] to improve access and coordination of mental health care, especially for Americans in remote areas or in underserved populations.
#* Develop and implement integrated [[electronic health record]] and personal health information systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Executive Summary |website=President's New Freedom Commission on Mental Health |date=July 22, 2003 |url=http://www.mentalhealthcommission.gov/reports/finalreport/FullReport.htm |archive-date=April 12, 2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050412233239/http://www.mentalhealthcommission.gov/reports/finalreport/FullReport.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opposition==
Opponents of the plan see little in the way of potential benefits from the plan, except increased profits for [[Pharmaceutical company|pharmaceutical companies]], and have concerns about the potential for unnecessarily causing neurological damage and contributing to increased substance abuse and drug dependence. Critics are also concerned by what they see as the pharmaceutical industry's use of [[front organization]]s &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Harley |last=Sullivan |date=July 2004 |title=Opinion: Second thoughts about NAMI's agenda |website=Stanislaus Connections |url=http://www.stanislausconnections.org/2004/07/opinion.htm |archive-date=July 17, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717080817/http://www.stanislausconnections.org/2004/07/opinion.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the compromise of scientific integrity [[under color of authority]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=March 18, 2005 |title= Fair and Balanced Science |website=Daily Kos |url=http://nonpartisan.dailykos.com/story/2005/3/18/10135/0441 }}&lt;/ref&gt; look askance at the [[irony]] of the commission's '[[Freedom (political)|freedom]]' descriptor, contending the commission is yet another example of the excesses of drug industry marketing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Trudy |last=Lieberman |date=July 2005 |title=Bitter Pill |website=Columbia Journalism Review |url=http://cjr.org/issues/2005/4/lieberman.asp |archive-date=August 18, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060818051615/http://www.cjr.org/issues/2005/4/lieberman.asp }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/06/politics/06fda.html?hp&amp;ex=1123387200&amp;en=faad45ae3cb9265b&amp;ei=5094&amp;partner=homepage] {{registration required}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that the effects of its recommendations will simply foster drug use rather than the prevention of mental illness and use of alternative treatment modalities.

===Screening recommendations===
''[[Mad in America]]'' author [[Robert Whitaker (author)|Robert Whitaker]] criticized the commission's screening recommendations as "fishing for customers." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lenzer |first=Jeanne |title=Bush plans to screen whole US population for mental illness |journal=BMJ |date=June 19, 2004 |volume=328 |issue=7454 |page=1458 |doi=10.1136/bmj.328.7454.1458 |pmid=15205287 |pmc=428510 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A coalition of over 100 advocacy organizations, united under the banner of [[Mindfreedom.org]] in representing the [[psychiatric survivors movement]], has been galvanized by their strong opposition to the New Freedom Commission. Using celebrity to advance their opposition, the MindFreedom coalition has again enlisted the support of longtime member and [[Gesundheit Institute]] founder [[Patch Adams]], a [[medical doctor]] made famous by the movie that bears his name. Since 1992, Adams has supported MindFreedom campaigns, and in August, 2004, he kicked off the campaign against the New Freedom Commission by volunteering to screen President Bush himself. "He needs a lot of help. I'll see him for free," said Adams.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release |title=President Bush and the Shrinking of the USA |publisher=MindFreedom Support Coalition International |date=16 August 2004 |url=http://www.mindfreedom.org/mindfreedom/bushpsychnews.shtml |archive-date=August 22, 2004 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040822222624/http://www.mindfreedom.org/mindfreedom/bushpsychnews.shtml }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others, including Congressman [[Ron Paul]] ({{abbr|R|Republican}}-{{abbr|TX14|Texas' 14th congressional district}}), were more concerned by the commission's suggestion to use schools as a site for screening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=David |last1=Van Nuys |first2=John |last2=Ferritto |first3=Matt |last3=Johnson |url=http://www.projectcensored.org/top-stories/articles/11-universal-mental-screening-program-usurps-parental-rights/ |title=Top 25 Censored Stories for 2006: #11 Universal Mental Screening Program Usurps Parental Rights |website=Project Censored |publisher=Sonoma State University |date=2006 |archive-date=September 18, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080918111542/http://www.projectcensored.org/top-stories/articles/11-universal-mental-screening-program-usurps-parental-rights/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul's concern led to the introduction of {{USBill|109|HR|181}} Parental Consent Act of 2005 in the [[United States House of Representatives|US House of Representatives]] on January 4, 2005. The bill, which died in committee, would have forbidden federal funds from being used for any [[mental health screening]] of students without the express, written, voluntary, informed consent of parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=H.R.181 - Parental Consent Act of 2005 |website=Congress.Gov |publisher=Library of Congress |access-date=October 20, 2016 |url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/109th-congress/house-bill/181 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul introduced similar bills in May 2007 ({{USBill|110|H.R.|2387}}), April 2009 ({{USBill|111|H.R.|2218}}), and August 2011 ({{USBill|112|H.R.|2769}});&lt;ref name=HR181&gt;{{cite web |title=H.R. 181 (109th): Parental Consent Act of 2005 |website=GovTrack |access-date=October 20, 2016 |url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/109/hr181 }}&lt;/ref&gt; those, likewise, died in committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=H.R.2387 - Parental Consent Act of 2007 |website=Congress.Gov |publisher=Library of Congress |access-date=October 20, 2016 |url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/110th-congress/house-bill/2387 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=H.R.2218 - Parental Consent Act of 2009 |website=Congress.Gov |publisher=Library of Congress |access-date=October 20, 2016 |url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/111th-congress/house-bill/2218 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=H.R.2769 - Parental Consent Act of 2011 |website=Congress.Gov |publisher=Library of Congress |access-date=October 20, 2016 |url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/112th-congress/house-bill/2769 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===TMAP origin criticism===
Critics also contend that the strategy behind the commission was developed by the pharmaceutical industry, advancing the theory that the primary purpose of the commission was to recommend implementation of TMAP based algorithms on a nationwide basis. TMAP, which advises the use of newer, more expensive medications, has itself has been the subject of controversy in [[Texas]], [[Pennsylvania]] and other states where efforts have been made to implement its use.

TMAP, which was created in 1995 while President Bush was governor of Texas, began as an alliance of individuals from the [[University of Texas at Austin|University of Texas]], the [[pharmaceutical]] industry, and the mental health and [[List of Texas state prisons|corrections]] systems of Texas. Through the guise of TMAP, critics contend, the drug industry has methodically influenced the decision making of elected and appointed public officials to gain access to citizens in [[prison]]s and State [[psychiatric hospital]]s. The person primarily responsible for bringing these issues to the public's attention is [[Allen Jones (whistleblower)|Allen Jones]], a former investigator in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Office of Inspector General (OIG), Bureau of Special Investigations.

Jones wrote a lengthy report in which he stated that, behind the recommendations of the New Freedom Commission, was the "political/pharmaceutical alliance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Jones |first=Allen |author-link=Allen Jones (whistleblower) |date=January 20, 2004 |title=TMAP |website=Psych Rights |publisher=Law Project for Psychiatric Rights |url=http://psychrights.org/Drugs/AllenJonesTMAPJanuary20.pdf |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was this alliance, according to Jones, which developed the Texas project, specifically to promote the use of newer, more expensive [[antipsychotic]]s and [[antidepressant]]s. He further claimed this alliance was "poised to consolidate the TMAP effort into a comprehensive national policy to treat mental illness with expensive, patented medications of questionable benefit and deadly side effects, and to force private insurers to pick up more of the tab."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21498">Raising the age of juvenile jurisdiction in the state of [[North Carolina]] has been an ongoing issue in the [[North Carolina General Assembly]]. There are currently two pieces of legislation focusing on this issue, Senate Bill 506 and House Bill 632, which seek to raise the age of jurisdiction from 16 to 18. Four members of the [[North Carolina House of Representatives]] serve as the primary sponsors and there are twenty-six co-sponsors. Most of U.S. States define an adult at 18 years old; however, [[North Carolina]] and [[New York (state)|New York]] define a juvenile who has committed a criminal offense as no older than 16, which places 16- and 17-year-olds in a position where they are tried as adults for any offense. 

Various advocacy groups are in favor of the proposed legislation and see the answer to a more productive society as one which conceals the criminal record of a minor through the age at which an individual is charged in adult court.  While opponents fear this legislation will create opportunity for repeat offenders, they are also concerned with the funding for the program, as it seems there is not enough funding at the current capacity.  A cost-benefit analysis done by the [[Vera Institute of Justice]] determined that initial costs would be high, but in the long run, raising the age would save money because offenders would be more productive in society.

==History==
Juvenile jurisdiction issues originated in 1919, "when fourteen- and fifteen-year-olds initially charged in juvenile court with felonies could be transferred to superior court. Since that time, transfer to adult court has been mandatory for some of the state's most serious felonies.  In 1994, the minimum age of transfer was reduced from fourteen to thirteen, giving North Carolina judges the discretion to transfer offenders as young as thirteen from juvenile to superior court for any felony crime."&lt;ref name="North Carolina, Juvenile Court Jurisdiction, and the Resistance to Reform"/&gt; The controversy surrounding raising the age of juvenile jurisdiction has been contested for years.  "In 1919, child welfare advocates recognized that providing preventative services to young offenders through the juvenile court system would likely lower the crime rate.  In 1947, welfare officials recommended that young offenders receive treatment in specialized boarding homes and detention centers rather than adult jails, as they had found that this investment of time, effort, and money was more than repaid by the improvement in the behavior and attitudes of the children. In 1957, the governor asserted that including sixteen- and seventeen-year-olds within the original jurisdiction of juvenile court would ultimately provide great savings in money and human services.  In 1967, it was found that rehabilitating young offenders by providing meaningful academic services and vocational education in open, closely supervised training schools lowered recidivism rates more effectively than methods that punish, ignore, isolate or try to fit the children into a pattern."&lt;ref name="North Carolina, Juvenile Court Jurisdiction, and the Resistance to Reform"/&gt;

[[File:Marilyn Avila.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Representative Marilyn Avila, one of the primary sponsors of House Bill 632]]North Carolina House Bill 632 is bipartisan and supported primarily by children advocacy groups such as Action for Children North Carolina and have made several attempts to push legislation.&lt;ref name="Advocates gear up for fight over state's juvenile age limit"/&gt;   The primary sponsors of the bill include Representatives David Lewis, Shirley Randleman, Marilyn Avila, and Alice Bordsen. The bill is described as "an act to amend the definition of delinquent juvenile to raise the age from sixteen to eighteen years in six-month increments over a four-year period, to provide that sixteen- and seventeen-year-olds who have been previously convicted of a felony in adult court shall remain in adult court, to provide that sixteen- and seventeen-year olds alleged delinquent for a class A-E felony shall be transferred to adult court, to make conforming changes to other statutes relevant to changing the definition of delinquent juvenile, and to extend the youth accountability task force." &lt;ref name="HB 632"/&gt; This bill was filed on April 5, 2011 and was referred to the Committee on Rules, Calendar, and Operations of the House on the following day.  On April 7, 2011 the bill was withdrawn from the committee and was re-referred to the Committee.&lt;ref name="HB 632"/&gt;  Similar bills have failed in the past because they do not consider the biggest problem associated with the legislation which is the cost associated with increasing the number of children in an underfunded program.&lt;ref name="Tried and Through"/&gt;

According to [[WRAL-TV]] News, "the suggestion is to raise the age of jurisdiction only for misdemeanors and low-level nonviolent felony offenses.  It would not apply in cases where a person is accused of violent crimes."&lt;ref name="Raise Juvenile Age to 18 for Some Crimes"/&gt; Peg Dorer, executive director of the North Carolina Conference of District Attorneys, states "adult courts are better suited to handle adolescents charges with serious offenses like rape, manslaughter, larceny, or murder."&lt;ref name="Legislators, advocates want juvenile justice age upped to 18"/&gt;  In the year 2009, "more than 96 percent were convictions for misdemeanors or low-level felonies."&lt;ref name="N.C. may treat fewer teen offenders as adults"/&gt;  According to Jeff Hampton of [[The Virginian-Pilot]], "Changing the law in North Carolina would move 20,000 teens annually into the juvenile system when the conversion is completed, doubling the current load, according to a 2009 report by the North Carolina Governor's Crime Commission."&lt;ref name="N.C. may treat fewer teen offenders as adults"/&gt;

==Current policy==
According to The Children's Alliance, the current policy is defined by the following:
* 13- to 17-year-olds who commit A felony - mandatory adult system
* 13- to 15-year-olds who commit B-E felony - juvenile system with option for transfer hearing to adult court
* 6- to 12-year-olds who commit any offense - [[juvenile court]], no transfer hearing option &lt;ref name="Raise the Age Factsheet"/&gt;

==House Bill 632==
According to The Children's Alliance, the proposed legislation is defined by the following:
* 16- to 17-year-olds that commit an A-E felony will be transferred to the adult system (will remain in the adult system).
* 16- to 17-year-old who commit B-E felony - mandatory adult system unless prosecutor finds extraordinary circumstances for juvenile system.
* 13- to 17-year-olds who commit F-I felony - juvenile system with option for transfer hearing to adult court.
* 13- to 17-year-olds who commit misdemeanor - [[juvenile court]], but can transfer with hearing if also charged with a felony.
* 16- to 17-year-olds charged with motor vehicle violations remain in adult court
* Once juvenile is transferred to adult system, always remain in adult system for any subsequent charges (applies to any 16- to 17-year-old that has already been charged in adult system when law takes effect).
* Where detention is necessary, places 16- and 17- year olds in juvenile detention if they are under the jurisdiction of [[juvenile court]] and in county jail if they are under the jurisdiction of adult court.
* Anticipate taking 4 years to move all 16- to 17-year-olds to the juvenile system:
:: 2015 - less than {{frac|16|1|2}}-year-olds move to juvenile system
:: 2016 - less than 17-year-olds move to juvenile system
:: 2017 - less than {{frac|17|1|2}}-year-olds move to juvenile system
:: 2018 - less than 18-year-olds move to juvenile system &lt;ref name="Raise the Age Factsheet"/&gt;

==Policy formulation==
An emphasis has been placed on increasing the age until which a minor can be sentenced in [[juvenile court]] for various reasons.  Advocates are concerned for the future of minors who are charged with crimes and the long-lasting effects. "One of the strongest arguments for raising the age of juvenile court jurisdiction concerns the impact of a criminal conviction on a youth's ability to obtain work"&lt;ref name="North Carolina, Juvenile Court Jurisdiction, and the Resistance to Reform"/&gt;  Often potential employees can be denied employment because of past criminal activities, even if they did not receive a conviction.&lt;ref name="North Carolina, Juvenile Court Jurisdiction, and the Resistance to Reform"/&gt;  Another concern of advocates is the opportunity for higher education can be denied or limited by a criminal record.&lt;ref name="North Carolina, Juvenile Court Jurisdiction, and the Resistance to Reform"/&gt;  As stated by Tamar Birckhead, "Access to high education lowers recidivism rates by opening the doors to economic and social advancement, excluding people from college on this basis will inevitably have a deleterious effect on the safety of the community at large."&lt;ref name="North Carolina, Juvenile Court Jurisdiction, and the Resistance to Reform"/&gt;

Advocates also see the importance of minors being placed in the juvenile system because of the services which are available to offenders.  By "providing intensive supervision, meaningful treatment, and rehabilitation to sixteen- and seventeen-year-olds in [[juvenile court]], rather than trying and incarcerating them with adult defendants in criminal courts and prisons, would lower recidivism rates" &lt;ref name="North Carolina, Juvenile Court Jurisdiction, and the Resistance to Reform"/&gt; whereas "youth who are tried and sentences as adults have been shown to receive little or no education services, mental health or substance abuse treatment, job training, or any other type of rehabilitative programming."&lt;ref name="North Carolina, Juvenile Court Jurisdiction, and the Resistance to Reform"/&gt; "While rehabilitation programs and intensive treatment for adolescents can be expensive, they ultimately save money by reducing the numbers of those who are prosecuted and sentenced as repeat offenders."&lt;ref name="North Carolina, Juvenile Court Jurisdiction, and the Resistance to Reform"/&gt; According to the Campaign for Youth Justice, "empirical research has demonstrated that violent adolescent offenders prosecuted in adult criminal court are likely to re-offend more quickly and more often than those adjudicated in a [[juvenile court]] setting." &lt;ref name="North Carolina, Juvenile Court Jurisdiction, and the Resistance to Reform"/&gt;

==Costs==
The [[Vera Institute of Justice]] conducted a cost-benefit analysis which found that "raising the age of juvenile jurisdiction from 16 to 18 for alleged misdemeanants and low-level felons will generate $52.3 million in net benefits, per annual cohort of youth aged 16 and 17, from the combined perspectives of taxpayers, victims, and youth."&lt;ref name="Cost-Benefit Analysis"/&gt;  In addition, "the policy change will generate an annual net cost of $49.2 million.  The net cost equals a cost of $70.9 million to North Carolina's justice agencies minus $21.7 million in benefits to the criminal justice system."&lt;ref name="Cost-Benefit Analysis"/&gt;  "From the victim perspective, raising the age will generate $3.6 million in benefits, per annual cohort of youth aged 16 and 17. Youth whose cases will be handled in the juvenile system will reoffend at lower rates than if they were processed in the adult system, thus reducing victimization and victimization costs."&lt;ref name="Cost-Benefit Analysis"/&gt;  "From the youth perspective, the policy change will generate $97.9 million in long-term benefits, per annual cohort of youth aged 16 and 17.  These benefits accrue over a period of 35 years and result from increased lifetime earnings, based upon the fact that youth tried in the juvenile rather than the adult system will be free of the burden of a criminal record that suppresses earning potential." &lt;ref name="Cost-Benefit Analysis"/&gt;  The report concluded that raising the age will "cost taxpayers $70.9 million a year and that this annually reoccurring investment will generate $123.1 million in reoccurring benefits to youth, victims, and taxpayers over the long term.  The results indicate that the benefits of the plan outweigh the costs and that, from a cost-benefit standpoint, the policy change merits consideration." &lt;ref name="Cost-Benefit Analysis"/&gt;

Advocates argue while initial costs are high, over time the costs will balance out as those who are not charged as adults are less likely from becoming re-offenders.&lt;ref name="Advocates gear up for fight over state's juvenile age limit"/&gt; Inherently, the costs of detaining juveniles in comparison to adults is more expensive because they require more care.  However, this cost is offset by the increased success the juveniles will accomplish throughout their life when tried as a juvenile rather than an adult.&lt;ref name="N.C. may treat fewer teen offenders as adults"/&gt; One of the bill's sponsors, Alice Bordsen, states the bill "saves you money in the near future and in the distant future" &lt;ref name="Tried and Through"/&gt; supporting the argument that while implementation will be costly, it will serve best to 16- and 17- year olds by allowing them the chance to have a successful future.

Opponents of the bill are concerned primarily with the cost associated with adding juveniles to the system, which is estimated around $50 million a year.&lt;ref name="Advocates gear up for fight over state's juvenile age limit"/&gt;  Susan Doyle, representing the North Carolina Conference of District Attorneys, the "current juvenile system is horribly underfunded and would be crushed under the weight of the requirements of this bill without significant additional funding."&lt;ref name="N.C. may treat fewer teen offenders as adults"/&gt;  Funding is a deciding factor for many faced with this issue, as many community leaders fear the strain that will be placed on the juvenile system without proper funding.&lt;ref name="Tried and Through"/&gt;  Eddie Caldwell, spokesman for the North Carolina Sheriffs' Association, states "they are opposed to the current legislation that proposes raising the juvenile age without providing the programs, facilities, and funding that are necessary to do so." &lt;ref name="Tried and Through"/&gt;  Caldwell also argues. "It does not make sense to take a system that all the experts agree does not have the resources to care for the children, and then add two more age groups." &lt;ref name="States prosecute fewer teenagers in adult courts"/&gt; Debby Burchfield, director of the Juvenile Detention Center in [[Buncombe County]], has been quoted as saying: "The biggest impact would be physical space, other than additional personnel. Some kids stay just 24 hours, while most stay an average of seven to 10 days."&lt;ref name="Tried and Through"/&gt;

==Other Concerns==
One issue with the current law is that the 16- and 17-year-olds who are currently tried as an adult face permanent and long-lasting effects as they have a criminal record furthering them from chances for improvement.&lt;ref name="Raise Juvenile Age to 18 for Some Crimes"/&gt; By raising the age, it is anticipated that recidivism will be reduced and the quality of life will be increased for those who would have become re-offenders.&lt;ref name="Cost-Benefit Analysis"/&gt;  The NC task force believes that this legislation could benefit young adults when tried as juveniles rather than adults because it would allow those who have committed nonviolent crimes an opportunity to live a successful life as an adult.&lt;ref name="Tried and Through"/&gt;  The task force believes the juvenile system allows those charged to "take advantage of the rehabilitation services."&lt;ref name="Tried and Through"/&gt;

Opponents of the bill believe that by raising the age the legislature is giving children two additional years to commit crimes knowing they would not be charged in an adult court, suggesting that the proposed law would not provide any deterrence.&lt;ref name="Advocates gear up for fight over state's juvenile age limit"/&gt; Eddie Caldwell provides a valid defense against the proposed legislation and proves to be the leading contestant against House Bill 632.  In addition to monetary costs that are associated with the legislation, Caldwell argues various other reasons as to why the legislation is disorganized. Caldwell argues that advocates are not addressing a major concern in which he states, "if its a kid that's done something wrong - as we all have - some worse than others, for the first time, then how do you deal with the child as opposed to the one that you've dealt with 100 times before?" &lt;ref name="Raising the legal age of adulthood on hold in NC"/&gt;  He also states, "Currently we allow that age group to decide whether or not they want to drop out of school, and that decision is no less important to the future of that child, and no less critical to their success than whether or not they commit a crime."&lt;ref name="Raising the legal age of adulthood on hold in NC"/&gt; While taking a critical stance against the proposed policy, Caldwell "says the Sheriff's Association is in favor of allotting the Department of Juvenile Justice with the proper resources for its current overall workload."&lt;ref name="Raising the legal age of adulthood on hold in NC"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12482">Neglect is defined as giving little attention to or to leave undone or unattended to, especially through carelessness. Mortuary neglect can comprise many things, such as bodies being stolen from the morgue, or bodies being mixed up and the wrong one was buried. When a mortuary fails to preserve a body correctly, it could also be considered neglect because of the consequences.

[[Insect indicators of abuse or neglect|Patient neglect]] is similar to mortuary neglect with one major difference: that patient neglect has to do with people who are still living and that neglect could ultimately lead to their death. Patient neglect concerns people in hospitals, in nursing homes, or being cared for in home. Usually in nursing homes or home-assisted living, neglect would consist of patients being left lying in their own urine and/or feces, which could, in turn, possibly attract flesh flies and lead to maggot infestation. It also encompasses patients getting rashes, [[lice]], and other sores from being improperly cared for.&lt;ref&gt;Arnoldi, Kyle. "Noncompliance vs. Medical Neglect." ''American Orthopedic Journal'' 2007: 137-143.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of mortuary neglect and the law ==
The general sign of mortuary neglect (in terms of forensic entomology) is an infestation of maggots or some other insect (such as cockroaches) of a corpse. This should not be confused with insects found on a body before they are transferred to the morgue.  The following examples are forms of mortuary neglect that pertain to the ethical treatment of a corpse.

=== Improper embalming === 
Improper embalming is the utilization of embalming techniques that cause premature decomposition of the body especially in cases where the body in question is to be presented in an open-casket funeral. In addition, not refrigerating the body immediately following death, but before the embalming process could lead to rapid deterioration of the human remains as well.

==== Washington v. John T. Rhines Co. ====
On August 29, 1994, widow Marian Washington filed suit against funeral home, John T. Rhines Co., for improperly embalming her late husband Vernon W. Washington. She claimed that the embalming fluid was leaking and that her husband’s skin was decomposing at an alarming rate. John T. Rhines Co. re-embalmed Mr. Washington in efforts to make his body presentable. However, they failed to restore Mr. Washington’s body completely.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.napil.com/PersonalInjuryCaseLawDetail37860/Page1.htm "Washington V. John T. Rhines Co."] National Association of Personal Injury Lawyers. 2005. 10 Mar. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cooley v. State Board of Funeral Directors and Embalmers ====
On May 3, 1956, Cooley, a petitioner of a particular funeral home tried to appeal the revoke of his license by the California state board of funeral directors and embalmers. The case reveals the reasons as to why the license was revoked. Cooley’s practices were described as unsanitary for the following reasons: an infant was discovered improperly embalmed after maggots were seeping out of its orifices, commingling of bodies, blood stains were found on the walls, and tools used were not cleaned from one autopsy to the next. Needless to say, the appeal was not granted.&lt;ref&gt;"Cooley V. State Bd. of Funeral Directors and Embalmers." Texas A&amp;M Database Search (1987): 293-296. Westlaw. Texas A&amp;M. 13 Apr. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fencing stolen organs  ===
This form of abuse consists of selling body parts stolen from carcasses that are sent to the morgue for embalming.

=== Commingling of ashes ===
Commingling of ashes is putting several carcasses in the same crematorium during the same burn cycle. This act undermines the respect due a passed loved one.

=== Unauthorized disposal ===
In this form of abuse, funeral home operators dispose of the body in a manner not authorized by the deceased’s loved ones.

==== Christensen v. Superior Court of Los Angeles County ====
On June 28, 1990, a court heard a case on a class action suit against multiple funeral service operators. These acts included all of the types of mortuary neglect mentioned above in this section. The case contended that the defendants violated conscionable standards regarding the treatment of the deceased.  This practice occurred for nearly a decade and victimized approximately 17,000 decedents and their families.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.napil.com/PersonalInjuryCaseLawDetail38312/Page20.htm "Christensen V. Superior Court of Los Angeles County."] National Association of Personal Injury Lawyers. 2005. 10 Mar. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Unethical treatment of the deceased ===
Any violation of the standards that any reasonable person would expect of a Mortuary operator could be considered in this category.

====Dennis v. Robbins Funeral Home====
James Dennis, widower of Molly Dennis, sued Robbins Funeral Home on August 24, 1987. Before Mrs. Dennis was to be cremated, Lee Miller, the funeral director of Robbins Funeral Home called the family to see the body. When the family arrived, to their dismay, they found Molly Dennis’s body unprofessionally presented in an unhygienic environment as unspecified limbs were hanging off the dissection table and into a dirty sink. Mr. Dennis was not, however, able to successfully sue the funeral home because the judicial history in the area did not include a precedent for funeral home malpractice.&lt;ref&gt;"Dennis v. Robbins Funeral Home." Texas A&amp;M Database Search (1987): 698-701. Westlaw. Texas A&amp;M. 13 Apr. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==National Funeral Directors Association==
The National Funeral Directors Association (NFDA) is an organization in the United States that regulates mortuaries and morgues and their activities regarding the [[embalming]] and interring of the deceased.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nfda.org/missionhistorystructure.php National Funeral Directors Association Overview] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080510152454/http://nfda.org/missionhistorystructure.php |date=2008-05-10 }} National Funeral Directors Association. 13 Mar. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  With any complaint including mortuary neglect, the NFDA has a fifteen step disciplinary process it goes through to determine the severity of the situation. After receiving a complaint, a committee reviews the situation even to the extent of an investigation and then they determine the consequences of the violation. Those considered in violation of the NFDA’s policies could face punitive action ranging from a warning to suspension from the organization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nfda.org/files/2003FaxBackPDFs/Membership/9506_CodeofProfessionalConductEnforcement.pdf NFDA Code of Professional Conduct.]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} National Funeral Directors Association.

== Trends ==
There are certain segments of the health care industry that are seeing downward moves in neglect, while other sections are experiencing unfortunate growth.  In modern hospitals the most prevalent form of neglect deals with the patients themselves neglecting their own care.  However, in other segments such as assisted living for mentally deficient patients the rates of abuse and neglect are still relatively high.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, Graham. "Patients at Risk of Neglect in Mental Health Trusts" ''Nursing Standard'' 7 Jan. 2004: 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mortuary neglect is another segment that has peculiar trends. There are relatively few morticians that just refuse to perform their duties. However, cases of ethically questionable practices can be easily found. Morticians only preserving visible body parts, incomplete embalming and defrauding families are just a few examples of reported cases of neglect.

Increasingly medical journals are recommending that doctors become more active in attempting to persuade parents and guardians of children to either accept or continue treatment for diseases or injuries in order to avoid a neglect case.  In the American Orthopedic Journal a case study was presented where a doctor suggested that an effort to convince a girl's mother to adequately treat a case of [[ambylopia]] to avoid potential neglect.  While a viewpoint arguing this was unnecessary, it shows a growing trend to go beyond traditional measures to avoid neglect charges.&lt;ref&gt;Bolin, Jane N. "Avoiding Charges of Fraud and Abuse: Developing and Implementing an Effective Compliance Program." ''Journal of Nursing Administration'' Dec. 2004: 546.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
From the times of the ancient [[Egyptians]], cases of mortuary neglect have been recorded. The process of [[embalming]] is to preserve the dead for burial, as the Egyptians believed the afterlife was just as important as life itself. However, if a woman was married to an embalmer, he would likely keep her preserved for his own benefit until obvious [[decomposition]] took place.

Dignity for the dead is now a [[legal]] matter, as patient neglect has always been. Abuse in the healthcare system is another huge problem in today’s society. Nursing homes and hospitals are preying grounds for predators of the weak and disabled. In 2001 a nursing home in Ossining, New York was closed because of neglect and unsafe conditions that existed for the patients.&lt;ref&gt;Finkelstein, Katherine. "Nursing Home Shuts Down After U.S. Finding of Danger." ''New York Times'' [New York City] 23 August 2001: 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==US state laws==
For the most part, mortuary standards are created by the states, not by the federal government. The following are links to state policies (where available) on mortuary practices:

A '''procurator fiscal''' (pl. ''procurators fiscal''), sometimes called '''PF''' or '''fiscal''', is a [[public prosecutor]] in [[Scotland]] (who, despite the title, has little to do with fiscal issues). They investigate all sudden and suspicious deaths in Scotland (similar to a [[coroner]] in other [[legal systems]]), conduct [[fatal accident inquiry|fatal accident inquiries]] (a form of [[inquest]] unique to the [[Scots law|Scottish legal system]]) and handle criminal complaints against the police (administrative complaints are handled by the [[Police Complaints Commissioner for Scotland]]). They also receive reports from specialist reporting agencies such as [[Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs]].&lt;ref&gt;Procurators Fiscal: {{cite web| title=The Scottish Criminal Justice System: The Public Prosecution System, pg. 2| url=http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/research/pdf_subj_maps/smda01-07.pdf| publisher=[[Scottish Parliament]]| accessdate=2009-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the majority of crimes in Scotland, the procurators fiscal present cases for the prosecution in the [[sheriff court|sheriff]], [[district court (Scotland)|district]] and [[justice of the peace court]]s, and the case for the defence is presented either by the accused, a [[solicitor]], or an [[advocate]]. The solicitor will work for a firm of solicitors, or in certain areas of Scotland could be a [[public defender]] working for the [[Public Defence Solicitors' Office]].

The procurator fiscal has the discretion to not prosecute and pursue alternatives free from political interference, but is always subject to the directions of the [[Crown Office]] and the [[Lord Advocate]].&lt;ref&gt;"The [[International Association of Prosecutors]] – Standards of Professional Responsibility and Statement of the Essential Duties and Rights of Prosecutors, which the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service adopted in 1999, states "the use of prosecutorial discretion should be exercised independently and be free from political interference" and requires prosecutors to "perform their duties without fear, favour or prejudice."{{cite web| title=Prosecution Code| url=http://www.copfs.gov.uk/Resource/Doc/13423/0000034.pdf |publisher=[[Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service]]| accessdate=2009-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"...the Lord Advocate as regards procurators fiscal may from time to time issue such instructions as may be deemed necessary for the purpose of giving effect to the provisions of this Act."{{cite web|title=Sheriff Courts and Legal Officers (Scotland) Act 1927 s.8 |url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/RevisedStatutes/Acts/ukpga/1927/cukpga_19270035_en_1#pt1-l1g8 | publisher=[[Office of Public Sector Information]]| accessdate=2009-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The purposes for which the Lord Advocate may issue instructions to procurators fiscal under section 8(1) of the Sheriff Courts and Legal Officers (Scotland) Act 1927 shall include, in addition to the purpose mentioned in the said section 8(1), the speedy and efficient disposal of business in the sheriff courts."{{cite web| title=Sheriff Courts (Scotland) Act 1971 s.20|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/RevisedStatutes/Acts/ukpga/1971/cukpga_19710058_en_3| publisher=[[Office of Public Sector Information]]| accessdate=2009-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==

The office most likely originates in the [[Roman-Dutch law|Roman-Dutch]] and French [[Manorial court|manorial]] or seignorial administrator ([[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''procurator-fiscaal'', [[French language|French]] ''procureur fiscal''), who, as the ''fiscal'' in the title suggests, was originally an officer of the [[Sheriff#Scotland|sheriff]] (the local [[law enforcement officer]] and [[judge]]) with financial (fiscal) responsibilities:  the procurator fiscal collected debts, fines, and taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Prosecution of Crimes in Scotland and in Hungary| url=http://www.law.ed.ac.uk/eyl/02repgv.htm| publisher=[[University of Edinburgh]]| accessdate=2009-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, such responsibilities had been eclipsed in the course of the 18th century by their duty as prosecutor in the sheriff court with the passage of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1701. In this capacity they gave concurrence in private prosecutions and prosecuted on behalf of [[the Crown]].  The Sheriff Courts (Scotland) Act 1867 gave procurators fiscal full responsibility in law for prosecution of all criminal acts in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;Fionda, J., ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=5Wc8L6Mw_m8C Public prosecutors and discretion: a comparative study]''. Oxford University Publishing. p. 65. {{ISBN|978-0-19-825915-2}}. Google Book Search. Retrieved on 2009-08-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally the fiscal was the sheriff's official and tenure of the office was at the pleasure of the sheriff.&lt;ref&gt;"Where a private Party prosecutes with Concurrence of the Procurator Fiscal,": Small Debts (Scotland) Act 1829 in ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=5bAuAAAAIAAJ The Statutes of Great Britain and Ireland v. 69].''  His Majesty's statute and law printers p. 329.  Google Book Search.  Retrieved on 2009-08-10.&lt;/ref&gt;  With the decline of private prosecution the fiscal came to be regarded more and more as under the control of the [[Lord Advocate]]. In 1776 the [[Government of the United Kingdom|government]] started to pay procurators fiscal to take precognitions and in 1907 the right of appointing procurators fiscal was transferred to the Lord Advocate, and in 1927 procurators fiscal became full-time civil servants.&lt;ref name="crownofficehistory"&gt;{{cite web|title=Historical development of the office of Procurator Fiscal |url=http://www.copfs.gov.uk/News/Historical/HistDevPF |publisher=[[Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312022836/http://www.copfs.gov.uk/News/Historical/HistDevPF |archive-date=12 March 2012 |accessdate=2009-08-10 |quote="In 1907 the Sheriff Courts (Scotland) Act vested the right of appointment of procurators fiscal to the Sheriff Courts in the [[Lord Advocate]]." |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lordadvocatelecutre"&gt;{{cite speech

== Prosecution of crimes ==

Procurators fiscal make preliminary investigations into criminal cases, take written statements from witnesses (known as [[Precognition (Scots law)|precognition]]) and are responsible for the investigation and prosecution of crime. This includes the power to direct the [[police]] in their investigation, but except for serious crimes such as murder the police normally complete their enquiries before involving the procurator fiscal.&lt;ref&gt;"When a crime is committed it is the responsibility of the Procurator Fiscal to investigate it." ''Lord Justice Clerk Thomson Smith'' {{cite web| title=The investigation of complaints against the police in Scotland: A Fair Cop? |url=https://www.scotland.gov.uk/hmic/docs/afcp-05.asp |publisher=[[Scottish Government]]| accessdate=2009-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under solemn High Court procedure, once someone has been charged with an offence and remanded in custody, [[the Crown]] must bring the case to a [[preliminary hearing]] within 110 days.&lt;ref&gt;Court of Session Act 1988: {{cite web|title=110/140 Day Rule |url=http://www.copfs.gov.uk/About/roles/pf-role/prosecution/110-day-rule|publisher=[[Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service]] |accessdate=2009-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The procurator fiscal has never been obliged to prosecute and can choose the level at which to prosecute (either through [[indictable offence|solemn]] or [[summary offence|summary]] procedure).  The [[defendant]] has no right to choose a [[jury trial]], nor can a victim on their own decide to press charges, as the decision on whether to try by jury or summarily belongs to the prosecutor.&lt;ref&gt;"Although Scotland did not have the principle of 'legality' as in some foreign jurisdictions where the prosecutor has no discretion..."{{cite web|title=Summary Justice Reform Thematic Report on the Use of Fiscal Fines, page 7|url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Resource/Doc/264423/0079241.pdf| publisher=[[Scottish Government]]|accessdate=2009-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"We do not have the English system of someone deciding whether or not to press charges, nor of Magistrates [or in America, Grand Juries] deciding whether or not someone should be committed for trial, nor of the accused opting for trial by jury. In Scotland, these are decisions for the Procurator Fiscal to make.

Since then these options have expanded to giving a warning, fiscal fines, [[reparation (legal)|compensation orders]], [[work order]]s, road traffic [[fixed penalty notice|fixed penalties]] or diversion from prosecution into [[social work]], [[psychological counselling]] or [[psychiatry|psychiatric treatment]].&lt;ref&gt;Alternatives to prosecution: {{cite web| title=Victimes of crime in Scotland| url=http://www.victimsofcrimeinscotland.org.uk/the-justice-process/prosecution-process/alternatives-to-prosecution/| publisher=[[Scottish Government]]| accessdate=2009-08-10| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110215020637/http://www.victimsofcrimeinscotland.org.uk/the-justice-process/prosecution-process/alternatives-to-prosecution/| archivedate=2011-02-15| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Deaths ==

All suspicious, sudden and accidental deaths must be reported to the procurator fiscal, and they have a responsibility to identify if any criminal action has occurred and, where appropriate, prosecute.  Where a criminal offence is suspected to have occurred the procurator fiscal will instruct the local police to investigate.&lt;ref&gt;"It is the duty of the Procurator Fiscal in the exercise of his function at common law and under statute to enquire into certain categories of death." {{cite web|title=Death and the Procurator Fiscal| url=http://www.show.scot.nhs.uk/publications/me/death%20and%20pf.htm| publisher=[[NHS Scotland]] |accessdate=2009-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fatal accidents can be subject to a [[fatal accident inquiry]], a form of [[judicial inquiry]] akin to an [[inquest]] but conducted without a [[jury]].  Fatal accident inquiries are conducted in a [[sheriff court]].  An inquiry must be held for all deaths in custody and fatal accidents, with other accidental deaths subject to inquiry at the discretion of the procurator fiscal.&lt;ref&gt;"Section 1 Paragraphs 1 (a) and (b)"{{cite web|title=Fatal Accidents and Sudden Deaths Inquiry (Scotland) Act 1976| url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/RevisedStatutes/Acts/ukpga/1976/cukpga_19760014_en_1| publisher=[[Office of Public Sector Information]] |accessdate=2009-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Fatal Accident Inquiries (FAIs) are held under the Fatal Accidents and Sudden Deaths Inquiry (Scotland) Act 1976.

== Serious crimes ==

For the most serious crimes, the case will not be directly prosecuted by the procurator fiscal. Instead, the case will be heard at the [[High Court of Justiciary]] and the prosecution will be made in the name of the [[Lord Advocate]] by an [[Advocate Depute]].&lt;ref&gt;"For certain of the most serious crimes known as the “pleas of the Crown”, like Treason, Murder and Rape, the High Court has exclusive jurisdiction. It remains the duty of the Procurator Fiscal to investigate such cases and prepare them fully for trial." {{cite web|title=The Prosecution of Crime in Scotland and in Hungary| url=http://www.law.ed.ac.uk/eyl/02repgv.htm| publisher=[[University of Edinburgh]]| accessdate=2009-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Areas ==
There are eleven procurators fiscal in Scotland, each covering a geographical area or [[jurisdiction]] with a central office. Outside [[Strathclyde]], these areas typically correspond with constabulary areas for the former [[List of UK Police forces#Scotland|territorial police forces in Scotland]]. They are (with areas in Strathclyde marked with an asterisk):&lt;ref&gt;Location of procurators fiscal: {{cite web|title=Our Offices? |url=http://www.copfs.gov.uk/in-your-community/our-offices|publisher=[[Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service]] |accessdate=2014-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Court of the Lord Lyon==
A procurator fiscal is appointed to the [[Court of the Lord Lyon]], which is a civil and criminal court dealing with [[Scottish heraldry]] and [[genealogy]] in Scotland.  This Court is unique to Scots culture with heraldry playing an important role, particularly in relation to the [[Scottish clan|clan system]].  [[Coat of arms|Coats of arms]] that are registered are required to pay a fee to the Crown and must adhere to specific rules concerning their shape, colour and imagery. The procurator fiscal is appointed under the [[Lyon King of Arms Act 1867]], formerly by the Lord Lyon, but since changes were made by the [[Convention Rights (Compliance) (Scotland) Act 2001]], by the [[Scottish Ministers]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2001/7/section/11 Convention Rights (Compliance) (Scotland) Act 2001, section 11]&lt;/ref&gt;

If any of the rules concerning a coat of arms – also known as "an achievement" – are broken, it is the procurator fiscal's job, as the independent official prosecutor of the court, to determine whether they should initiate criminal proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;"An Act of the Scottish Parliament of 1592 gave the Lord Lyon responsibility for prosecuting as a criminal offence anyone who uses unauthorised Arms. The Court has its own Procurator Fiscal, an independent official prosecutor."{{cite web|title=History of the Court of the Lord Lyon |url=http://www.lyon-court.com/lordlyon/215.180.html |publisher=[[Court of the Lord Lyon]] |accessdate=2009-08-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090802040102/http://www.lyon-court.com/lordlyon/215.180.html |archivedate=2009-08-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"If any of the rules concerning a coat of arms – also known as "an achievement" – is broken, it is the procurator fiscal's job as the independent official prosecutor of the court to initiate criminal proceedings – although "it is not simply case of punishing somebody", points out Mr Way." {{cite web|title=Victoria Raimes meets the outgoing procurator fiscal for the Court of the Lord Lyon – a newly 'open' post |url=http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/features/Victoria-Raimes--meets-the.5207169.jp| publisher=[[The Scotsman]]| accessdate=2009-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--Per MOS:BOLDTITLE, neither the article's title nor related text appears in bold.--&gt;On January 18, 2012, a series of coordinated protests occurred against [[Copyright bills in the 2011-2012 United States Congress|two proposed laws in the United States Congress]]—the [[Stop Online Piracy Act]] (SOPA) and the [[PROTECT IP Act]] (PIPA). These followed smaller protests in late 2011. Protests were based on concerns that the bills, intended to provide more robust responses to [[copyright infringement]] (also known as piracy) arising outside the United States, contained measures that could possibly infringe online freedom of speech, websites, and Internet communities. Protesters also argued that there were insufficient safeguards in place to protect sites based upon [[user-generated content]].

The move to a formal protest was initiated when some websites, including [[Reddit]] and the [[English Wikipedia]], considered temporarily closing their content and redirecting users to a message opposing the proposed legislation. Others, such as [[Google]], [[Mozilla]], and [[Flickr]], soon featured protests against the acts. Some shut down completely, while others kept some or all of their content accessible. According to protest organizer [[Fight for the Future]], more than 115,000 websites joined the Internet protest.&lt;ref name="NYT 19 Jan"&gt;Wortham, Jenna (2012-01-19). [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/20/technology/public-outcry-over-antipiracy-bills-began-as-grass-roots-grumbling.html?pagewanted=1&amp;ref=technology "Public outcry over antipiracy bills began as grassroots grumbling"]. ''New York Times''. Retrieved 2012-01-21.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the online protests, there were simultaneous physical demonstrations in several U.S. cities, including New York City, San Francisco and Seattle, and separately during December 2011 a mass boycott of then–supporter [[GoDaddy]]. The protests were reported globally.

The January protest, initially planned to coincide with the first SOPA hearing of the year, drew publicity and reaction. Days prior to the action, the White House issued a statement that it would "not support legislation that reduces freedom of expression, increases cybersecurity risk, or undermines the dynamic, innovative global Internet."&lt;ref name=whitehouse/&gt; On January 18 itself, more than 8 million people looked up their representative on Wikipedia,&lt;ref name="LA Times 19 Jan"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/technology/2012/01/wikipedia-sopa-blackout-congressional-representatives.html | title = Wikipedia: SOPA protest led 8 million to look up reps in Congress | first = Deborah | last = Netburn | date = 2012-01-19 | accessdate = 2012-01-20 | publisher = Los Angeles Times }}&lt;/ref&gt; 3 million people emailed Congress to express opposition to the bills,&lt;ref name="NYT 19 Jan" /&gt; more than 1 million messages were sent to Congress through the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]],&lt;ref name="EFF 19 Jan"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/01/thank-you-internet-and-fight-continues | title = Thank You, Internet!

During and after the January protest, a number of politicians who had previously supported the bills expressed concerns with the proposals in their existing form, while others withdrew their support entirely. Internationally, "scathing" criticism of the bills was voiced from [[World Wide Web]] inventor [[Sir Tim Berners-Lee]],&lt;ref name="Berners-Lee" /&gt; as well as the [[European Commissioner for Digital Agenda|European Commissioner for the Digital Agenda]].&lt;ref name=Kroes /&gt; Some observers were critical of the tactics used; the ''[[Boston Herald]]'' described the service withdrawals as evidence of "how very powerful these cyber-bullies can be."&lt;ref name=heraldresponse/&gt; [[Motion Picture Association of America]] Chairman [[Chris Dodd]] stated that the coordinated shutdown was "an abuse of power given the freedoms these companies enjoy in the marketplace today."&lt;ref name=doddquote/&gt; Others such as  ''[[The New York Times]]'' saw the protests as "a political coming of age for the tech industry."&lt;ref name="nytimes1"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/18/technology/web-wide-protest-over-two-antipiracy-bills.html?scp=11&amp;sq=SOPA&amp;st=cse | work=The New York Times | first=Jenna | last=Wortham | title=A Political Coming of Age for the Tech Industry | date=January 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By January 20, 2012, the political environment regarding both bills had shifted significantly. The bills were removed from further voting, ostensibly to be revised to take into consideration the issues raised,&lt;ref name="NYT-20120120"&gt;{{cite news |last=Weisman|first=Jonathan|title=After an Online Firestorm, Congress Shelves Antipiracy Bills

==Background==
{{Main|PROTECT IP Act|Stop Online Piracy Act}}

===Background to bills===
The [[Stop Online Piracy Act]] (SOPA) and the [[PROTECT IP Act]] (PIPA) are bills that were introduced into the [[United States House of Representatives]] and the [[United States Senate]] in the last quarter of 2011. Both are responses to the problem of enforcement of U.S. laws against websites outside U.S. jurisdiction. While the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] (DMCA) and other existing laws have generally been considered effective against illegal content or activities on U.S.-based sites,&lt;ref name="cnnmoney"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://money.cnn.com/2012/01/17/technology/sopa_explained/ | title=  SOPA explained: What it is and why it matters | publisher = [[CNNMoney]] | date = 2012-01-17 | accessdate = 2012-01-17 | first =  Julianne | last = Pepitone }}&lt;/ref&gt; action is more difficult against overseas websites.&lt;ref name="cnnmoney" /&gt; SOPA and PIPA proposed to rectify this by cutting off infringing sites from their U.S.-based funding (particularly [[Internet advertising|advertising]]), [[payment processor]]s, appearances on [[search engine]]s, and visibility on [[web browser]]s, instead. Major providers of all these services are predominantly U.S.-based. Notably, the provisions also involved modifying the [[Domain Name System|DNS system]], a crucial service that underpins the entire Internet and allows computers to locate each other reliably around the world.

Supporters included, but were not limited to, media companies and industry associations such as the [[Motion Picture Association of America]], the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] and the [[Entertainment Software Association]]. Supporters generally identified a need to have more effective laws to combat the illegal domestic sales of products and services, the counterfeiting and sale of products (such as prescription drugs, athletic shoes, and cosmetics), and worldwide copyright infringing activities which were problematic to prevent inasmuch as they originated outside the United States.

Those opposed included a mixture of technology and Internet firms and associations, content creators such as the [[Wikipedia community]], [[free software]] authors, [[free speech]] organizations, lawmakers, and other websites and organizations, as well as members of the public using their services. They generally identified two main areas of severe side-effects: (1) effects on Internet websites, communities and user-generated content, and (2) effects on critically fundamental internet architecture and security:

* ''Effects on websites, web communities and user-generated content'' - The scope, language, definitions, procedures, remedies, and provision for [[Immunity from prosecution|immunity]] following wrongful allegations was seen as insufficiently narrow and well-defined. Legal analysts suggested that draconian court orders could be obtained without undue difficulty to "take down" an entire site, without dialog or notification, due process, or liability for compensation if incorrect, even if the site were legitimate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/Blogs/makingwaves/were-sorry-youre-not-allowed-to-read-this/blog/38656/ | title=We're sorry, you're not allowed to read this | publisher=Greenpeace | date=January 17, 2012 | accessdate=January 23, 2012 | author=Naidoo, Kumi}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=January 2012}}&lt;!--

The original text stated as an example:
 "For example, what entails 'deliberate actions to avoid confirming a high probability' for a website?"

We need a cited source, can anyone find a good example to add?

--&gt; Perceived consequences included serious [[Internet censorship|undermining of free speech on the Internet]], devastation of the Internet's communities, and widespread closure and [[chilling effect (law)|chilling]] of websites, particularly those including user-created content or organizations such as [[public library|libraries]] providing reference information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rapp|first=David|title=DPLA, Syracuse, Library Blogs Take Part in SOPA/PIPA Protest|url=http://www.thedigitalshift.com/2012/01/copyright/dpla-syracuse-library-blogs-take-part-in-sopapipa-protest/|publisher=thedigitalshift.com (Library journal)|accessdate=2012-01-22|date=2012-01-18|quote=''The website of the Digital Public Library of America has a statement saying that the legislation 'would force libraries to censor access to [written, recorded, and visual] culture, expose librarians to criminal penalties for doing their jobs'...''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Observers also noted the laws could be used strategically against legitimate competitors or during [[election]]s.&lt;ref name="Berners-Lee" /&gt;

* ''Effects on critical Internet architecture'' - Technical experts testified that the proposed DNS measures conflicted with the [[critical Internet infrastructure|fundamental basis of the Internet]] and would "break" ongoing attempts to make the net more secure against malicious use.

[[Google]]'s policy director, Bob Boorstin, stated that a site like [[YouTube]] supporting user-generated content "would just go dark immediately" to comply with the legislation.&lt;ref name="cnnmoney"/&gt; [[Tumblr]], one of the first websites active in grassroots activism against the bills, added a feature that "censored" its website on November 16, 2011, and the [[social media]] aggregator [[Reddit]] also became deeply involved.&lt;ref name="NYT 19 Jan"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118140002/http://www.reddit.com/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2012-01-18|title=blackout|date=2012-01-18|access-date=2018-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legislative and protest timeline ===
On November 16, 2011, a first hearing by the [[United States House Committee on the Judiciary|U.S. House Judiciary Committee]] was marked by online protests involving blackened website banners, popularly described as "American Censorship Day".

On December 15, 2011, the first House Judiciary Committee [[markup (legislation)|mark-up hearing]] took place for SOPA, prior to its eventual move to the House floor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.pcworld.com/article/246093/house_panel_to_move_forward_on_stop_online_piracy_act.html | title = House Panel to Move Forward on Stop Online Piracy Act | first = Grant | last = Gross | date = 2011-12-12 | accessdate = 2012-01-17 | work = [[PC World (magazine)|PC World]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the markup session, several proposed amendments to address technological and other concerns were defeated. The mark-up process was put on hold to be resumed after the new year.

Around this time, numerous websites began displaying banners and messages promoting their readerships to contact Congress to stop the progress of the bill, and some websites began to discuss or endorse a possible "Internet blackout" before any vote on SOPA in the House, as a means of further protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2080066/Top-web-firms-set-impose-blackout-protest-Big-Brother-online-piracy-bill.html?ito=feeds-newsxml | title = Top web firms set to impose a blackout in protest against 'Big Brother' online piracy bill | first = Hugo | last = Guy | date = 2011-12-30 | accessdate = 2012-01-17 | work = [[Daily Mail]] | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Reddit]] was the first major site to announce an "Internet blackout" for January 18, 2012, and several other sites shortly followed, coordinating actions for that day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://venturebeat.com/2012/01/10/reddit-blackout-sopa-pipa/ | title = Reddit goes black Jan.&amp;nbsp;18&amp;nbsp;to protest SOPA &amp; PIPA&amp;nbsp;— Who else will join? | first = Tom | last = Cheredar | date = 2012-01-10 | accessdate = 2012-01-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A notable political response to the November 2011 protests was the outlining in early December of a [[bipartisan]] third, alternative, bill with the support of technology companies such as [[Google]] and [[Facebook]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-01-23/collapse-of-anti-piracy-bills-leaves-hollywood-seeking-a-truce.html | title = Collapse of Anti-Piracy Bills Leaves Hollywood Seeking a Truce | first = Eric | last = Engleman | date = 2012-01-23 | accessdate = 2012-01-23 | work = [[Bloomberg Businessweek]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; which unusually had been posted on the Internet to allow public comment and suggestions in light of the widespread protests related to the SOPA and PIPA bills. It was formally introduced as the [[Online Protection and Enforcement of Digital Trade Act]] (OPEN) in the Senate on December 17 by Senator [[Ron Wyden]] and in the House on January 18 by Representative [[Darrell Issa]]. It proposed placing enforcement in the hands of the [[United States International Trade Commission]], keeping provisions that targeted payments and advertising for infringing websites, and tightly targeted wording to avoid many other key areas of concern with SOPA and PIPA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://thehill.com/blogs/hillicon-valley/technology/204975-issa-introduces-piracy-alternative | title = Issa pushes alternative anti-piracy bill | publisher = [[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]] | first = Brendan | last = Sasso | date = 2012-01-18 | accessdate = 2012-01-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Online discussions of a blackout and concerns over the bills continued unabated after the markup hearing and increased in prominence. On January 11, Senator [[Patrick Leahy]], the main sponsor for PIPA, said of the DNS filtering provision, "I will therefore propose that the positive and negative effects of this provision be studied before implemented",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leahy.senate.gov/press/press_releases/release/?id=721ddff6-3399-4d56-a966-bca3f848759b Comment Of Senator Patrick Leahy On Internet Service Providers And The PROTECT IP Act ]; Senator Patrick Leahy - Press Release; January 12, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; reported by some papers as removal of those provisions.&lt;ref name="wired"&gt;{{cite news | url =https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2012/01/leahy-pipa-amendment/ | title = Leahy Offers to Remove Net-Altering DNS Redirects in Anti-Piracy Bill | work = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] | date = 2012-01-12 | accessdate = 2012-01-17 | first = David | last = Kravets }}&lt;/ref&gt; Opposers deemed this a tactical withdrawal allowing reintroduction at a later stage and ignoring other concerns as well as provisions in PIPA, and evidence that the bill had not been understood or checked by its own creators and that proposals for a blackout were gaining impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Masnick|first=Mike|title=Don't Be Fooled: Leahy Is NOT Removing DNS Blocking Provisions, Merely Delaying Them|url=http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20120112/18452517396/dont-be-fooled-leahy-is-not-removing-dns-blocking-provisions-merely-delaying-them.shtml|accessdate=2012-01-22|newspaper=[[Techdirt]]|date=2012-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Momentum for the protests continued unchanged&lt;ref name="wired" /&gt; since the bills had merely been postponed, and due to their other contentious provisions.

On December 22, 2011, users at [[Reddit]] proposed a [[boycott]] and a public day for switching away from then–SOPA supporter [[GoDaddy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GoDaddy supports SOPA, I'm transferring 51 domains &amp; suggesting a move your domain day|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/nmnie/godaddy_supports_sopa_im_transferring_51_domains/|accessdate=2011-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; the largest [[ICANN]]-accredited [[Domain name registrar|registrar]] in the world, known as [[Move Your Domain Day]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://domainnamewire.com/2010/08/17/go-daddy-marches-toward-1-billion/ |title=Domain Name Wire |publisher=Domain Name Wire |date=2010-08-17 |accessdate=2010-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The date was later set as December 29, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Boycott GoDaddy Over Their Support of SOPA|url=http://godaddyboycott.org|accessdate=2011-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 23, GoDaddy withdrew its support for SOPA, releasing a statement saying "GoDaddy will support it when and if the Internet community supports it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lowensohn |first=Josh |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-57347915-38/go-daddy-spanks-sopa-yanks-support/ |title=GoDaddy spanks SOPA, yanks support |publisher=CNET News |date=2011-12-23 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.godaddy.com/newscenter/release-view.aspx?news_item_id=378 |title=GoDaddy No Longer Supports SOPA |publisher=GoDaddy |date= |accessdate=2011-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; CEO Warren Adelman stated when asked, that he couldn't commit to changing GoDaddy's position on the record in Congress, but said "I'll take that back to our legislative guys, but I agree that's an important step";&lt;ref name="coldewey1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Coldewey|first=Devin|title=GoDaddy CEO: "There Has To Be Consensus About The Leadership Of The Internet Community"|url=https://techcrunch.com/2011/12/23/godaddy-ceo-there-has-to-be-consensus-about-the-leadership-of-the-internet-community|date=2011-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; when pressed, he said "We're going to step back and let others take leadership roles."&lt;ref name="coldewey1"/&gt; Further outrage was due to the fact that many Internet sites would be subject to shutdowns under SOPA, but GoDaddy is in a narrow class of exempted businesses that would have immunity, whereas many other domain operators would not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://idealab.talkingpointsmemo.com/2011/12/sopa-hearing-will-never-end.php |title=SOPA Hearing Will Never End &amp;#124; TPM Idea Lab |first=Carl |last=Franzen |work=talkingpointsmemo.com |date=2011-12-15 |accessdate=2011-12-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111228105355/http://idealab.talkingpointsmemo.com/2011/12/sopa-hearing-will-never-end.php |archivedate=December 28, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wikimedia Foundation Wikipedia Blackout SOPA January 18, 2012.theora.ogv|thumb|thumbtime=13|The staff at the [[Wikimedia Foundation]] the moment the blackout happened]]

On December 10, 2011, [[Wikipedia]] co-founder [[Jimmy Wales]] drew attention to concerns over SOPA, which he described as a "much worse law" than the ''[[DDL intercettazioni]]'' (Wiretapping Bill)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.camera.it/Camera/view/doc_viewer_full?url=http%3A//www.camera.it/_dati/leg16/lavori/stampati/pdf/16PDL0038530.pdf&amp;back_to=http%3A//www.camera.it/126%3FPDL%3D1415-B%26leg%3D16%26tab%3D2%26stralcio%3D%26navette%3D |title=Camera dei Deputati: disegno di legge N. 1415-B |language=Italian |accessdate=2011-10-04 |work=[http://www.camera.it/ Camera dei Deputati]}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Italy some months earlier, and which was being fast-tracked through the [[United States Congress]] under a "misleading title". He stated he was attending high-level meetings on this, and wanted to gauge the sense of the [[Wikipedia community|English Wikipedia community]] on the issue, and specifically on the question of a blackout similar to [[Italian Wikipedia blackout|that held successfully]] in October 2011 by [[Italian Wikipedia]] editors over the proposed media censorship law in that country:&lt;ref name=atlantic-jimmy&gt;{{cite news|last=Rosen|first=Rebecca|title=Wikipedia Considers Black Out to Protest Anti-Piracy Law|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2011/12/wikipedia-considers-black-out-to-protest-anti-piracy-law/249922/|accessdate=2012-01-20|newspaper=[[Atlantic Wire]]|date=2011-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|I thought this would be a good time to take a quick reading of the community feeling on this issue ..... To be clear, this is NOT a vote on whether or not to have a strike. This is merely a straw poll to indicate overall interest. If this poll is firmly "opposed" then I'll know that now. But even if this poll is firmly in "support" we'd obviously go through a much longer process to get some kind of consensus around parameters, triggers, and timing.}}

Following initial informal discussions which resulted in a positive response, a formal consultation titled "SOPA Initiative" was opened by the community to consider specific proposals and preferred options. These included matters such as location (United States only or worldwide), and whether content should be disabled completely or still accessible after a click-through page. Eventually, the discussion led to a decision strongly in favor of a 24-hour global blackout of the site on January 18, disabling normal reading and editing functions, affirmed in a vote of approximately 1,800 editors.&lt;ref name="cnn wales"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://edition.cnn.com/2012/01/17/tech/web/wikipedia-sopa-blackout-qa/index.html | title = Why Wikipedia is going down at midnight | first = John | last =Sutter | date = 2012-01-17 | accessdate = 2012-01-17 | publisher = CNN }}&lt;/ref&gt; The blocking action was purposely not complete; users could access Wikipedia content from the mobile interface or mirror sites, or if they disabled [[JavaScript]] or other web browser functions.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.extremetech.com/computing/114233-surviving-the-wikipedia-blackout-mirrors-caches-alternatives-apps-and-more| title= Surviving the Wikipedia blackout: Mirrors, caches, alternatives, apps, and more| first = Sebastian | last = Anthony | date = 2012-01-18 | accessdate = 2012-01-18 | work = [[ExtremeTech]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Emily | last = Steel | accessdate = 2012-01-17 | url = https://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2012/01/17/need-wikipedia-wednesday-heres-how-to-access-it/ | title = Need Wikipedia Wednesday?

The vote formally affected the English Wikipedia only; other language editions and Wikimedia projects were left free to decide whether to hold their own protests given the potential worldwide impact of the legislation, with technical support on offer from the Foundation.&lt;ref name="cnn wales"/&gt; The editor communities of at least 30 other [[Wikimedia Foundation#Projects|sister projects]] chose to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=[[Wikipedia:SOPA initiative/Actions by other communities]]|publisher=English Wikipedia|accessdate=2012-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 17, 2012, Jimmy Wales affirmed the results of the community's decision and that the [[Wikimedia Foundation]], which hosts the English Wikipedia website, would support the community's decision. He called for a "public uprising" against the proposed legislation, which critics fear would threaten free speech. He added that factors such as funding or donations had not been part of the community's considerations, but the matter had arisen as "a principled stand" from the community, and that in his view "our best long-term prospect for Wikipedia in terms of our survival ... depends on us being principled".&lt;ref name="jimmy-17 jan"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/why-i-want-to-bring-down-the-internet--for-a-day-6290703.html|title=Why I want to bring down the Internet&amp;nbsp;– for a day|first=Jerome|last=Taylor|date=2012-01-17|accessdate=2012-01-17|work=The Independent|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; He commented on editors' reasons for the decision:&lt;ref name="jimmy-17 jan" /&gt;

{{quote|Free speech includes the right to not speak. We are a community of volunteers. We have written this thing that we believe to be a gift to the world. We don't charge people for it. It's freely available to anybody who wants to (use it). We are a charity. And I think it's important for people to realize that the ability of our community to come together and give this kind of gift to the world depends on a certain legal infrastructure that makes it possible for people to share knowledge freely -- that the First Amendment is incredibly important in terms of the creation of this kind of thing.}}

Wikimedia Executive Director [[Sue Gardner]] posted an announcement of the Foundation's support for the blackout proposal on Wikimedia's blog.  The post received over 7000 responses from the general public within the first 24 hours of its posting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.wikimedia.org/2012/01/16/wikipedias-community-calls-for-anti-sopa-blackout-january-18/ Wikipedia's community calls for anti-SOPA blackout January 18] ''[[Wikimedia Foundation]]''  Accessed: 2012-01-17&lt;/ref&gt; The blackout was to run for 24 hours starting at 05:00 UTC ([[midnight]] [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Standard Time]]) on January 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/technology/wedsites-blackout-in-sopa-anti-piracy-protest/story-e6frfro0-1226248013015|title=Websites blackout in SOPA anti-piracy protest|work=News.com.au|date=2012-01-19|accessdate=2012-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the support of those polled for the action, a small number of Wikipedia editors blacked out their own user profile pages or resigned their administrative positions in protest of the blackout; one editor stated his "main concern is that it puts the organization in the role of advocacy, and that's a slippery slope".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://news.yahoo.com/wikipedia-editors-sites-planned-blackout-225904304.html | title =  Wikipedia Editors Question Site's Planned Blackout | first = Peter | last = Svensson | date = 2012-01-17 | accessdate = 2012-10-01 | agency = Associated Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Approximately 90% out of the 2097 editors who took part in the votes supported joining the blackout action. It is estimated that only less than half the voters were from the United States, which suggests that Wikipedia acted as a platform for an international community to express its opinion. The most common rationale expressed by about a fifth of the editors was the sentiment that "SOPA was perceived as a worldwide threat".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/0011392114551649|title=The day Wikipedia stood still: Wikipedia’s editors’ participation in the 2012 anti-SOPA protests as a case study of online organization empowering international and national political opportunity structures|first=|last=Piotr Konieczny|date=November 1, 2014|publisher=|journal=Current Sociology|volume=62|issue=7|pages=994–1016|via=SAGE Journals|doi=10.1177/0011392114551649}}&lt;/ref&gt; A majority of editors who opposed the participation were concerned with the perceived dissonance between Wikipedia's encyclopedic ethos, neutrality and active participation in a political issue (sentiment endorsed by about 4% of the vote participants); only 0.3% of participating editors suggested they support a tougher copyright regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/1369118X.2016.1157620 | volume=20 | title=Wikipedia in the anti-SOPA protests as a case study of direct, deliberative democracy in cyberspace | year=2016 | journal=Information, Communication &amp; Society | pages=167–184 | last1 = Konieczny | first1 = Piotr|url=https://zenodo.org/record/883897}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to protest organizer ''Fight for the Future'', more than 115,000 websites participated in the protest, including Google and Wikipedia.&lt;ref name="NYT 19 Jan" /&gt; Websites that participated in the blackout included [[Cheezburger]], [[Craigslist]], [[Boing Boing]], [[A Softer World]], [[Cake Wrecks]], [[Cyanide &amp; Happiness]], [[Demand Progress]], [[Destructoid]], [[Entertainment Consumers Association]].

The [[Mozilla Foundation]] altered the default start page of their [[Firefox]] web browser, blacking it out and providing links with more information on the SOPA/PIPA bills and the opposition to them, and to allow users to email their Congressional representatives.&lt;ref name="mozilla"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-57362433-93/mozilla-reaches-40-million-people-in-anti-sopa-campaign/ | title = Mozilla reaches 40 million people in anti-SOPA campaign | publisher = [[CNet]] | first = Dana | last = Kerr | date = 2012-01-19 | accessdate = 2012-01-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[TV Tropes]] posted black bars atop the web page with the message "STOP SOPA".

[[Mojang]]'s bestselling game ''[[Minecraft]]'' made a splash text that said "SOPA means LOSER in [[Swedish language|Swedish]]!"

A site called [[The Spoony Experiment]], known for a cute robot mascot called Burton, changed the homepage into a more nightmarish version, involving a nightmarish version of Burton and the words "The Spoony Experiment" replaced by red text proclaiming "The Experiment is Over", signifying the proposed death of several websites.

''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' magazine's online site used Javascript to place black bars on most of the text on their page, as if the text was redacted, outside of their key article regarding SOPA/PIPA; readers could remove the bars with a mouse click.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/technology/2012/01/sopa-blackout-wikipedia-google-wired-join-protest-against-internet-censorship/ | title = SOPA Blackout: Wikipedia, Google, Wired Protest 'Internet Censorship' | publisher = [[ABC News]] | date = 2012-01-18 | accessdate = 2012-01-19 | first = Ned | last = Potter }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2012/01/why-weve-censored-wired-com/ | title = Why We've Censored Wired.com | first = Evan | last = Hansen | date = 2012-01-18 | accessdate = 2012-01-18 | work = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wired.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118192832/https://www.wired.com/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=January 18, 2012|title=Wired.com|date=2012-01-18|access-date=2018-01-14|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The photo-sharing website [[Flickr]] created the ability for a registered user to "censor" an unlimited number (up from an initial limit of ten) of photos as demonstration of how SOPA/PIPA regulation would affect the site; the user-selected photographs were greyed out, and included informational text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2399029,00.asp | title = Flickr SOPA Protest Lets You Black Out Photos | first = Chloe | last = Albanesius | date = 2012-01-18 | accessdate = 2012-01-18 | work = [[PC Magazine]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

StumbleUpon added numerous links to anti-SOPA/PIPA websites.

A video was circulated by the League for Gamers (founded by [[Mark Kern]] and supported by [[ScrewAttack]], ''[[Extra Credits]]'', and ''[[LoadingReadyRun]]'') protesting the [[Entertainment Software Association]]'s support of SOPA by gathering support to boycott the ESA's popular [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3 convention]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.screwattack.com/StandTogether Stand Together: The Gaming Community vs SOPA and PIPA] on [[ScrewAttack]].com&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the online blackouts, protests in cities such as New York City, San Francisco, and Seattle were held on January 18 to raise awareness of the two bills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://techcrunch.com/2012/01/19/tctv-hundreds-rally-in-the-streets-of-nyc-to-defend-the-internet/ | title = TCTV: Hundreds Rally In The Streets Of NYC To Defend The Internet | first = Jason | last = Kinkaid | date = 2012-01-19 | accessdate  = 2012-01-19 | publisher = [[TechCrunch]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes reaction"/&gt;

A series of pickets against the bills were held at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow.

Several media organizations including ''[[The Washington Post]]'', ''[[The Guardian]]'', and [[NPR]] encouraged a "[[crowdsourcing]] solution for those left searching for answers" during the Wikipedia blackout by inviting users to ask questions on [[Twitter]] using the hashtag #altwiki.&lt;ref&gt;David Beard (2012-01-17), [https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/blogpost/post/wikipedia-blackout-an-altwiki-band-aid/2012/01/17/gIQAWbg25P_blog.html Wikipedia Blackout: An #altwiki Band-Aid] ''[[The Washington Post]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

An executive of the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] (MPAA) dubbed the blackout plan an example of the "gimmicks and distortion" that inflamed passions while failing to solve the problem of copyright infringement by "draw[ing] people away from trying to resolve what is a real problem, which is that foreigners continue to steal the hard work of Americans".&lt;ref&gt;James Rainey, (2012-01-16) [http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-ct-wikipedia-20120117,0,4565597.story Wikipedia to go offline to protest anti-piracy legislation] ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Former U.S. Senator and MPAA Director [[Chris Dodd]] stated that the coordinated shutdown was "also an abuse of power given the freedoms these companies enjoy in the marketplace today."&lt;ref name=doddquote&gt;[http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/entertainmentnewsbuzz/2012/01/dodd-lashes-out-at-sopa-strike.html MPAA's Chris Dodd takes aim at SOPA strike] ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'' 2012-01-17&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dick Costolo]], CEO of social networking site [[Twitter]], rejected calls for Twitter to join the protest, tweeting that  "[c]losing a global business in reaction to single-issue national politics is foolish."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/jan/16/wikipedia-sopa-blackout-slammed-twitter|title=Twitter boss slams Wikipedia's 'silly' Sopa protest|work=The Guardian|accessdate=2012-01-17|date=2012-01-17|first=Dominic|last=Rushe|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, some thought Costolo referred to all of the blackout movements on January 18, but afterwards clarified that he was referring to a hypothetical blackout of Twitter, and that he was supportive of the Wikipedia blackout itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Mark Sweney |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/jan/17/wikipedia-blackout-looms-sopa |title=Wikipedia's blackout looms |publisher=The Guardian |date= January 17, 2012|accessdate=2012-01-20 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sponsor of the bill, Representative [[Lamar S. Smith]], called the blackout a "publicity stunt," and stated with reference to Wikipedia that "it is ironic a website dedicated to providing information is spreading misinformation about the Stop Online Piracy Act."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/hillicon-valley/technology/204629-gop-chairman-wikipedia-blackout-a-publicity-stunt|title=Sponsor of online piracy bill calls Wikipedia blackout a 'publicity stunt'|work=The Hill|accessdate=2012-01-17|date=2012-01-17|first=Brendan|last=Sasso}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 17, 2012, in response to growing concerns over PIPA and SOPA, the White House stated that it "will not support legislation that reduces freedom of expression, increases cybersecurity risk, or undermines the dynamic, innovative global Internet."&lt;ref name=whitehouse&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/mobile/technology-16574977|title=Rupert Murdoch Sopa attack rebuffed by Google|publisher=BBC News|date=2012-01-16|accessdate=2012-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The impact of the coordinated action was generally considered to be significant. [[Yochai Benkler]] of the [[Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society]] stated that the January 18 blackout was "a very strong public demonstration to suggest that what historically was seen as a technical system of rules that only influences the content industry has become something more," further adding "You've got millions of citizens who care enough to act.

Media columnist David Carr wrote in the ''New York Times'' that there were two lessons, one being that "People who don't understand the Web should not try to re-engineer it", and the other that while businesses generally prize their relations with their customers, in the struggle between media and technology companies, the latter have "a much more chronic [i.e. ongoing], intimate relationship with consumers" and would more likely prevail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Carr|first=David|title=How I'm Surviving (or Trying to) Without Wikipedia at My Fingertips|url=http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/18/how-im-surviving-or-trying-to-without-wikipedia-at-my-fingertips/|accessdate=2012-01-22|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=2012-01-18|quote=Media companies prize their relationship with the consumer ... but technology companies have a much more chronic, intimate relationship with consumers.

Threats like that are no way to conduct the serious, sober discussions needed to figure out exactly what ails the movie industry and to come up with solutions.  It was Hollywood's arrogance in pushing bills through Congress without proper vetting that caused them to be withdrawn; these threats also are not helpful to figuring out what ails the industry and how to solve their issues.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Among other media industry reactions, [[Creative America]] was of the view that "[t]hey've misidentified this issue as an issue about your Internet, your Internet is being jeopardized.  In fact their business model is being asked to be subjected to regulation. They're misleading their huge base."&lt;ref&gt;Alan Fram (2012-01-21), [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2012/01/21/national/w092012S93.DTL&amp;ao=2#ixzz1k8IiIOPL "INFLUENCE GAME: Online companies win piracy fight"] ''[[Associated Press]]''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Recording Industry Association of America]] President [[Cary Sherman]] noted that the major television networks supported the legislation but, unlike Wikipedia and Google, did not use their platforms to try to shape public opinion: "when Wikipedia and Google purport to be neutral sources of information that is not only not neutral but affirmatively incomplete and misleading, they are duping their users into accepting as truth what are merely self-serving political declarations."&lt;ref&gt;Cary H.

Rep. Lamar Smith, who sponsored SOPA, flatly stated in a commentary on [[Fox News Channel|Fox News]] that "This bill does not threaten the Internet. But it does threaten the profits generated by foreign criminals who target the U.S. market and willfully steal intellectual property by trafficking in counterfeit or pirated goods."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://opinion.foxnews.mobi/quickPage.html?page=34606&amp;content=64706720&amp;pageNum=-1|title=FOX News - Opinion - Opinion Posts - The Truth about SOPA|work=Fox News}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While speaking on the Senate floor on January 23 Senator Leahy reiterated his objections to the protests, saying:
&lt;blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;"&gt;
Websites like Wikipedia and YouTube... would not be subject to the provisions of the bill.  That Wikipedia and some other websites decided to "go dark" on January 18 was their choice, self imposed and was not caused by the legislation and could not be. &lt;br&gt;
It was disappointing that sites linked to descriptions of this legislation that were misleading and one-sided.  The Internet should be a place for discussion, for all to be heard and for different points of view to be expressed.  That is how truth emerges and democracy is served.  Last week, however, many were subjected to false and incendiary charges and sloganeering designed to inflame emotions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://leahy.senate.gov/press/press_releases/release/?id=bb2ae775-3aaa-416d-97e6-eaf4949bf6eb "Leahy: Senate Should Focus On Stopping Online Theft That Undercuts Economic Recovery"] ''leahy.senate.gov'' 23 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

== Related protests ==
SOPA and PIPA protests were overlapped and followed by protests against [[Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement|ACTA]] which has a similar sense. The ACTA treaty was signed by 22 Member States in Europe and was expected to be signed before March 2012 by the other left Cyprus, Estonia, Netherlands and Slovakia, and thus would have gained legal force for the whole European Union. On February 11, more than 200 European cities took part in a widespread protest against ACTA.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/story/2012-02-09/ACTA-protests/53040634/1 ACTA ignites concerns about threat to Internet freedom], USA Today, February 11, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euronews.net/2012/02/11/activists-rally-to-give-acta-the-cold-shoulder/ Activists rally to give ACTA the cold shoulder], euronews&lt;/ref&gt; Although protests were held in Europe, the signing of ACTA was led by USA, Australia, Canada, South Korea, Japan, New Zealand, Morocco, and Singapore, which were first to sign the treaty at a ceremony on October 1, 2011, in Tokyo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ustr.gov/acta|title=Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) - United States Trade Representative|work=ustr.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the concerns of ACTA are much related and raised after the protests against SOPA and PIPA which directed the public attention to bills and acts that may threaten Internet and civic liberties.

== Legislative impact and aftermath ==
During the day of January 18, six of PIPA's sponsors in the Senate, including [[Marco Rubio]], PIPA's co-sponsor, [[Orrin Hatch]], [[Kelly Ayotte]], [[Roy Blunt]], [[John Boozman]], and [[Mark Kirk]], stated that they would withdraw their support for the bills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2012/01/18/amidst-sopa-blackout-senate-copyright-bill-loses-a-key-supporter/ | title= Amidst SOPA Blackout, Senate Copyright Bill Loses Key Supporters | first = Andy | last = Greenberg | date = 2012-01-18 | accessdate = 2012-01-18 | work = [[Forbes]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several other congressmen issued statements critical of the current versions of both bills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://news.cnet.com/8301-31921_3-57361237-281/protests-lead-to-weakening-support-for-protect-ip-sopa/ | title = Protests lead to weakening support for Protect IP, SOPA | first = Declan | last = McCullagh | first2 = Elinor | last2 = Mills | date = 2012-01-18 | accessdate = 2012-01-18 | publisher = [[CNet]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC16623831&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-16623831 |title=Sopa: US backers end support for anti-piracy bill |publisher=BBC News Online |accessdate=2012-01-19 |date=January 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the following day, eighteen of the 100 senators, including eleven of the original sponsors of the PIPA bill, had announced that they no longer supported PIPA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2012/01/19/internet-blackout-causes-18-senators-to-flee-from-pipa|title= Internet Blackout Causes 18 Senators to Flee from PIPA|last1= Tassi|first1= Paul|date= 2012-01-19|work= |publisher= Forbes|accessdate=2012-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; By one account, the shift in stated positions on SOPA/PIPA by members of Congress had gone overnight from 80 for and 31 against to 65 for and 101 against.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://s3.amazonaws.com/propublica/assets/images/sopa-opera-count.png|title="Members of Congress's Positions on SOPA/PIPA"|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An initial floor vote was scheduled for January 24, prior to the Internet blackout, but following these responses, Senator Majority Leader [[Harry Reid]] announced that the vote will be postponed, urging the bill's main sponsor, Senator [[Patrick Leahy]], to work out compromise in the bill "to forge a balance between protecting Americans' intellectual property, and maintaining openness and innovation on the Internet."&lt;ref name="NYT-20120120" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-57362675-503544/pipa-vote-postponed-in-the-senate/ | title = PIPA vote postponed in the Senate | first = Stephanie | last = Condon | date = 2012-01-20 | accessdate = 2012-01-20 | publisher = [[CBS News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the House Judiciary Subcommittee chairman, Representative [[Lamar S.

Months after the protests, in July 2012, ''[[The New York Times]]'' summarized events as follows:&lt;ref name="NYT-20120709"&gt;{{cite news |last=Chozick |first=Amy |title=Tech and Media Elite Are Likely to Debate Piracy |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/10/business/media/tech-and-media-elite-are-likely-to-debate-piracy.html |date=July 9, 2012 |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=July 10, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;"&gt;Wikipedia went black to protest SOPA and more than seven million people signed online petitions, many of which said the bills would "break the Internet." Congress, overwhelmed by the popular opposition, quickly backpedaled, leaving the legislation to die.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The development of the electronic [[grassroots]] campaign has been the subject of academic analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|ssrn=2295953|title=Social Mobilization and the Networked Public Sphere:  Mapping the SOPA-PIPA Debate|work=ssrn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boingboing.net/2013/09/19/report-shows-how-the-anti-sopa.html|title=Report shows how the anti-SOPA fight came from the bottom up / Boing Boing|website=boingboing.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other proposed laws==
According to the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] (EFF), "SOPA and PIPA are really only the tip of the iceberg. The same forces behind these domestic U.S. laws have continued to both push for other states to pass similar domestic laws, as well as to secretly negotiate international trade agreements that would force signatory nations to conform to the same legal standards."&lt;ref name="eff similar"&gt;{{cite web|last=Katitza Rodriguez and Maira Sutton|title=Internet Blackout Day Fires Up Digital Rights Activism Around the World|url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/01/internet-black-out-day-fires-digital-rights-activism-around-world|publisher=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation]]|accessdate=2012-01-23|date=2012-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Racial and Religious Tolerance Act 2001, is a statute passed by the Victorian Parliament during the Premiership of [[Steve Bracks]]. The Act makes behavior that incites or encourages hatred, serious contempt, revulsion or severe ridicule against another person or group of people because of their race and/or religion unlawful in Victoria

The Act criminalises racist graffiti, racist posters, racist stickers, racist comments made in a publication, including the Internet and email, statements at a meeting or at a public rally. The Act explicitly criminalises public behavior – not personal beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=2001 |title=The Racial and Religious Tolerance Act  |url=https://www.humanrightscommission.vic.gov.au/home/the-law/racial-and-religious-tolerance-act |website=Victorian Equal Opportunity and Human Rights Commission |location=Melbourne |access-date=22 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Catch the Fire Ministries - Vilification of Muslims lawsuit==

In a landmark ruling on 17 December 2004, a VCAT tribunal ruled that [[Danny Nalliah]], [[Daniel Scot]] and Catch the Fire Ministries had breached the law. The pair stood accused of making fun of Muslim beliefs and conduct that was "hostile, demeaning and derogatory of all Muslim people, their god, Allah, the prophet Muhammad and in general Muslim religious beliefs and practices". Nalliah publicly condemned the verdict and declared his intention to continue fighting the case, potentially as far as the [[High Court of Australia]]. ''[[The Age]]'' newspaper quoted him as stating, "We may have lost the battle, but the war is not over. The law has to be removed, there is no question."&lt;ref name="TheAgeHistoric"&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/news/National/Historic-win-in-religious-hatred-case/2004/12/17/1102787271940.html Historic win in religious hatred case] [[The Age]], 18 December 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

The matter was eventually resolved without a VCAT hearing after mediation between the two parties. On 22 June 2007 VCAT published a statement agreed to by both parties which affirmed everyone's rights to "robustly debate religion including the right to criticise the religious belief of another, in a free, open and democratic society".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hosen |first1=Nadirsyah |last2=Mohr |first2=Richard |date=2011 |title=Law and religion in public life: The contemporary debate}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,21963547-1702,00.html |title=Church and Islamic council bury hatchet |last=Turnbull |first=Jeff |date=25 June 2007 |website= |publisher= |access-date= |quote= |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070625063604/http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,21963547-1702,00.html |archivedate=25 June 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Patriots Front - Inciting Serious Contempt of Muslims==
In September 2017 three prominent members of the far-right [[United Patriots Front]]; Blair Cottrell, Neil Erikson and Chris Shortis, were charged with serious religious vilification, among other offenses. In September that same year they were convicted for inciting serious contempt of Muslims, each were fined $2,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-09-05/three-men-found-guilty-of-inciting-serious-contempt-for-muslims/8874804|title=Far-right nationalists found guilty of inciting serious contempt for Muslims|date=2017-09-05|work=ABC News|access-date=2017-09-06|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

Former state shadow [[Attorney general]] [[Andrew McIntosh (Australian politician)|Andrew McIntosh]] announced prior to the 2006 election that the [[Liberal Party of Australia (Victorian Division)|Liberal Party]] would repeal the religious section of the "fundamentally flawed" Act.&lt;ref name="The Age2"&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/libs-coy-over-hatred-laws/2006/08/09/1154802962877.html "libs coy over hatred laws"] 9 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt; 

In January 2006, nineteen Christian leaders from Melbourne's largest churches wrote to the Premier requesting the removal of the civil provisions in the act, claiming that aspects of the religious vilification law undermines multiculturalism. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/news/opinion/religious-vilification-law-undermines-multiculturalism/2006/04/30/1146335604488.html "religious vilification law undermines multiculturalism"] [[The Age]] 30 April 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Independent MP [[Russell Savage]], whose support helped Bracks form Government in 1999, described the act as "the worst legislation he had ever seen passed".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/speaking-freely-is-risky-business-rally-told/2006/08/08/1154802889839.html "speaking freely is risky business"] [[The Age]] 8 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rainwater HOG was designed by the award-winning architectural innovator [[Sally Dominguez]] for use in tight spaces and is sized to allow designers and engineers to use the stored water as effective thermal mass inside a structure.

==Applications==
Rainwater HOG modules were used by David Gottfried, founder of the [[U.S. Green Building Council]], to achieve the USA's first [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] Platinum Home Remodel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.builderonline.com/leed/california-renovation-soars-beyond-leed-platinum.aspx |title=California Renovation Soars Beyond LEED-Platinum - Leed, Green Remodeling, Green Building, Net-Zero Energy, Energy Star, Renewable Energy, Green Standards, Water Conservation, Green Design - Builder Magazine |publisher=Builderonline.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gottfried used HOGs to store rainwater for flushing ultra-low-flush toilets, and additional HOGs to store filtered [[Greywater]] for use on the non-edible portion of the landscape.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5566">A '''regulatory agency''' (also '''regulatory authority''', '''regulatory body''' or '''regulator''') is a [[Public benefit corporation|public authority]] or [[government agency]] responsible for exercising autonomous authority over some area of human activity in a [[regulation|regulatory]] or [[supervisory]] capacity. An '''independent regulatory agency''' is a regulatory agency that is independent from other branches or arms of the government.

Regulatory authorities are commonly set up to enforce safety and standards, and/or to protect consumers in markets where there is a [[Imperfect competition|lack of effective competition]] or the potential for the undue exercise of [[market power]]. Examples of regulatory agencies that enforce standards include the [[Food and Drug Administration]] in the [[United States]] and the [[Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency]] in the [[United Kingdom]]; and, in the case of [[Regulatory economics|economic regulation]], the [[Office of Gas and Electricity Markets]] and the [[Telecom Regulatory Authority of India|Telecom Regulatory Authority]] in [[India]].

== Legislative basis ==
Regulatory agencies are typically a part of the [[executive (government)|executive]] branch of the government and have [[statutory]] authority to perform their functions with oversight from the legislative branch. Their actions are generally open to [[judicial review|legal review]]. 

Regulatory agencies deal in the areas of [[administrative law]], [[regulatory law]], [[primary and secondary legislation|secondary legislation]], and [[rulemaking]] (codifying and enforcing rules and regulations and imposing supervision or oversight for the benefit of the public at large). The existence of independent regulatory agencies is justified by the complexity of certain regulatory and supervisory tasks, and the drawbacks of political interference. Some independent regulatory agencies perform investigations or [[audit]]s, and other may fine the relevant parties and order certain measures. In a number of cases, in order for a company or organization to enter an industry it must obtain a [[license]] to operate from the sector regulator. This license will set out the conditions by which the companies or organizations operating within the industry must abide.

==Functioning==
In some instances, regulatory bodies have powers to require that companies or organizations operating within a particular industry adhere to certain standards or deliver a set of outputs ''ex ante''. This type of regulation is common in the provision of [[Public utility|public utilities]] which are subject to economic regulation. Regulatory bodies in this area will:

* require individuals, companies or organizations entering the industry to obtain a license; and
* set [[Price-cap regulation|price controls]] and require the provision of particular service levels.

In most cases, regulatory agencies have powers to the use some of the following ''ex post'' mechanisms:

*require transparency of information and [[decision-making]] on part of the regulated company or organization;
*monitor the performance and compliance of the regulated company or organization, with the regulator publishing the findings of its investigations;
*require that administrators give reasons explaining their actions, and have followed principles that promote non-arbitrary and responsive decisions;
*undertake enforcement action, such directing the company to comply through orders, the imposition of [[Fine (penalty)|financial penalties]] and/or the revocation of a license to operate; and
*arrangements for review of administrative decisions by courts or other bodies such as [[Competition regulator|competition authorities]].

In the United States, a '''sit-lie ordinance''' (also sometimes referred to as '''sit-lie law''') is a [[municipal ordinance]] which prohibits sitting or lying on the sidewalk or in other public spaces.

Proponents argue that such ordinances are useful or necessary in keeping sidewalks free from obstruction, particularly for use by mobility-impaired persons, and that they are a useful tool in fighting undesirable behavior, while opponents argue that they are instead veiled attacks on [[vagrancy (people)|vagrants]] and [[homeless]] persons,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/cityinsider/detail?entry_id=63603 | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | title=Sit/lie deja vu? | first=John | last=Coté | date=May 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, further, unnecessary and overbroad.

Sit-lie ordinances are most notably found in West Coast cities, since the 2000s, with [[Seattle, Washington]], [[Portland, Oregon]], and several [[San Francisco Bay Area]] cities – [[Santa Cruz, California|Santa Cruz]], [[Palo Alto]], and [[San Francisco]] itself – having passed such ordinances.&lt;ref name=welch&gt;{{cite news|last=Welch|first=William M.|title=Sit-lie laws put spotlight on safety|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/2010-03-22-sidewalk-ban-san-francisco_N.htm|accessdate=March 6, 2013|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|date=March 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2009 survey of 235 US cities, 30% prohibited sitting or lying in some public places.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Proponents ==
In some cases sit-lie ordinances, such as in Portland, are part of a package of reforms, also providing services for vagrants, such as restrooms, benches, and day shelters, and in this context are supported as a tool to ensure that such resources are used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
Critics argue that such ordinances are a [[Laws criminalizing the homeless|criminalization of homelessness]], a criminalization of ordinary activities – hence prone to [[selective enforcement]] – and unnecessary, since existing, narrowly targeted laws ban the undesirable activities such as aggressive begging, obstruction of sidewalks, loitering, and aggressive pursuit.

Certain aspects of some ordinances have been ruled [[Overbreadth doctrine|overbroad]]; Portland's ordinance prohibited having possessions more than two feet from one's person, which was ruled unconstitutional by Judge Michael McShane in 2009, stating that he "found that an ordinary person would not understand from the statute that mundane and everyday behavior would be prohibited by the law," and that "the ordinance encourages arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

== History ==

=== Portland ===
Portland passed multiple sit-lie and anti-camping ordinances in the 2000s, which have all either been struck down or expired, and {{as of|May 2010|lc = y}} was working on related ordinances that would allow sitting and lying.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Portland's most recent ordinance was enacted in 2007. After repeated legal challenges, the police ceased enforcing it and the law's [[sunset clause]] expired.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== San Francisco ===
In San Francisco, a sit-lie ordinance was proposed in March 2010 by Mayor [[Gavin Newsom]], but generated strong opposition under the banners of "Sidewalks Are for People" and "Stand Against Sit/Lie". It was placed on the November general election ballot as "Proposition L," and was approved by voters on November 2, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Based on the sit/lie ordinance, [[infraction]]s peaked at 1,011 in 2013, but since that time they have steadily declined, falling to 114 in 2017, while misdemeanors tracked by [[SFPD]] spiked at 195 in 2016, then similarly declined by almost half the next year. SFPD's current policy focuses on steering homeless people to shelters, rather than arresting them (which is basically giving the suspect a ticket and a court date).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sfchronicle.com/crime/article/The-Scanner-SF-police-have-backed-off-13322561.php The Scanner: SF police have backed off controversial ‘sit/lie’ citations - sfchronicle]&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Berkley ===
In November 2012, voters in Berkeley decided not to make it a crime to sit on sidewalks in the city's commercial districts between 7 a.m. and 10 p.m. &lt;ref&gt;Tim Phillips, [http://activistdefense.wordpress.com/2012/11/12/campaign-against-proposed-sitlie-law-in-berkeley-succeeds/ "Campaign Against Proposed Sit/Lie Law in Berkeley Succeeds"], Activist Defense, November 12, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Honolulu ===
In [[Honolulu]], a sit-lie ordinance was signed into law in December 2014 by Mayor [[Kirk Caldwell]]. The initial ordinance applied to a number of pedestrian malls in the [[downtown Honolulu|downtown]] and [[Chinatown, Honolulu|Chinatown]] neighborhoods and contains and except for "people who are experiencing medical emergencies, engaged in expressive activity, working in maintenance or construction, or waiting in line unless their possessions impede the flow of pedestrian traffic."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Mayor signs pedestrian mall sit-lie ban into law|url = http://khon2.com/2015/02/11/mayor-signs-pedestrian-mall-sit-lie-ban-into-law/|publisher= KHON2|accessdate = 2015-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; An extension to the sit-lie ban was vetoed later by Caldwell on May 21, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Honolulu mayor vetoes sit-lie ban expansion|url = http://khon2.com/2015/05/05/honolulu-mayor-vetoes-sit-lie-ban-expansion/|website = KHON2|accessdate = 2015-12-11|first = Brent|last = Remadna|first2 = Nestor|last2 = Garcia|first3 = Web|last3 = Staff}}&lt;/ref&gt; One 2015 study by graduate students at the University of Hawaii Department of Urban and Regional Planning surveyed 70 homeless individuals. Of the 70 interviewed, 54% reported having identification documents confiscated by the state. This would require them to pay a $200 retrieval fee unless they were able to obtain a fee waiver. The study authors concluded that the ordinance had little effect on homelessness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = University of Hawaii study finds Honolulu's sit-lie ban ineffective|url = http://www.bizjournals.com/pacific/news/2015/06/16/university-of-hawaii-study-finds-honolulus-sit.html|website = Pacific Business News|accessdate = 2015-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, as part of a city campaign to clear city sidewalks of [[homeless encampment]]s, Mayor Caldwell signed an expansion of the sit-lie ordinance to an additional 13 areas of [[Honolulu County, Hawaii|Honolulu County]] ([[Oahu]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/story/36185139/full-list-sit-lie-ban-extended-to-15-other-oahu-communities FULL LIST: Sit-lie law includes 15 Oahu communities], [[Hawaii News Now]] (August 21, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jayna Omaye, [http://www.staradvertiser.com/2017/05/12/hawaii-news/caldwell-enacts-law-pushing-sit-lie-ban-to-additional-areas/ Caldwell enacts law pushing sit-lie ban to additional areas], ''Honolulu Star-Advertiser'' (May 12, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''special pleader''' was a historical legal occupation. The practitioner, or "special pleader" in [[English law]] specialised in drafting "pleadings", in modern terminology [[statements of case]].

==History==
Up to the 19th century, there were many rules, technicalities and difficulties in drafting pleadings and claims and defences could be dismissed for trivial errors. Some practitioners made it their business to frame pleadings, rather than to appear in court or to write [[legal opinion]]s, and were called special pleaders. They were not necessarily [[barristers]], but might be licensed to practise under the [[Bar association|bar]]. At one time it was usual to practise for a time as a special pleader before being [[called to the bar]]. The system had largely fallen into disuse as a speciality by the beginning of the 20th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Craies|1911}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it continues to exist in India.

The '''Trademark Clearinghouse''' is a database of validated and registered trademarks established by [[ICANN]] to assist [[trademark]] holders prevent infringing behavior in the [[Domain Name System]]. In combination with the Uniform Rapid Suspension System (URS), it is the second significant attempt by ICANN to handle the "Trademark Dilemma".&lt;ref name=TM_Dilemma /&gt; The first attempt was the [[Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy]].

The Trademark Clearinghouse is not a trademark office. Rights holders who register their marks with the Trademark Clearinghouse must still register with their country's trademark office. The primary purpose of the Trademark Clearinghouse is to maintain a global database of verified trademarks for the [[Domain Name System]].&lt;ref name="TMCH_FAQ" /&gt;

The Trademark Clearinghouse is strictly for [[second-level domain]] names. Other mechanisms exist to protect trademark in the [[Generic top-level domain|new gTLDs]] themselves.&lt;ref name=Explaining_TMCH_to_businesses /&gt; All new gTLD registries are required to use the Trademark Clearinghouse and URS for protection of Second-level domains.&lt;ref name="TMCH_FAQ" /&gt;

==History==
One of the initial tasks of ICANN when it was formed was to deal with the so-called "Trademark Dilemma",&lt;ref name=TM_Dilemma /&gt;&lt;ref name=TM_Dilemma_2 /&gt; which is determining the appropriate balance of rights between domain name holders and trademark owners. So in December 1999 ICANN launched the [[Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy]]. Starting in 2008&lt;ref name=ICANN_GTLD_RFP /&gt; ICANN began a new program to launch many more new [[Generic top-level domain]]s. As part of this program ICANN envisioned a replacement program for the Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy.

On March 6, 2009 ICANN commissioned 18 intellectual property experts from around the world entitled the Implementation Recommendation Team (IRT). They produced a report on May 29, 2009 with numerous recommendations to protect intellectual property rights holders. Most importantly, the report recommended an Intellectual Property Clearinghouse be created in concert with a Uniform Rapid Suspension System (URS).&lt;ref name=IRT_report /&gt;

The recommendation of the Intellectual Property Clearinghouse became the basis for the Trademark Clearinghouse and together with the URS eventually replaced the Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy.

On May 28, 2010 ICANN published the Trademark Clearinghouse Proposal.&lt;ref name=TMCH_prop /&gt; The proposal emerged from an ICANN meeting held in Nairobi between the 7th and 12 March 2010. In the proposal both the Trademark Clearinghouse and the Universal Rapid Suspension program were proposed as possible replacements for the Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy.

In November 2012 ICANN organized meetings in Los Angeles and Brussels to consider the implementation of the Trademark Clearinghouse for new top level domains.&lt;ref name=Robin_Gross_IGP /&gt; The outcome of these meetings was a [[straw man proposal]] for the Trademark Clearinghouse.&lt;ref name=strawman /&gt;

In March 2013 the Trademark Clearinghouse launched.&lt;ref name=TMCH_launch_Tuesday /&gt;

===Controversy===
The new gTLD program initially faced heavy criticism from many brand owners. Specifically, the [[Association of National Advertisers]] created an organization called Coalition for Responsible Internet Domain Oversight (CRIDO)&lt;ref name=CRIDO /&gt; and began lobbying ICANN to halt the new gTLD rollout. The brand owners saw the creation of more gTLDs as a further cost to protect their trademarks from [[cybersquatting]]. They wanted strong trademark protections built into the new gTLD program.&lt;ref name=ANA_Letter_1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ANA_Letter_2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ANA_Letter_3 /&gt;

Milton Mueller, a professor at Syracuse University and frequent critic of ICANN, argues that the creation of the Trademark Clearinghouse was entirely hijacked by the advertising and intellectual property stakeholders, primarily by groups like the Association of National Advertisers (ANA). He argues that ICANN staff ignored its established bottom up processes when it did not suit them, and instead implemented the straw man proposal against the wishes of the Generic Names Supporting Organization (GNSO), Noncommercial Stakeholders Group (NCSG), and numerous other stakeholders.&lt;ref name=IGP_on_TMCH /&gt;

DNS news site DomainIncite.com has also been critical of the Trademark Clearinghouse development process.&lt;ref name=TMCH_Compromised_Beginnings /&gt;

====Brussels and Los Angeles meetings====
Many non-commercial observers have criticised ICANN for the way in which the Trademark Clearinghouse was developed. Most of this criticism has stemmed from a lack of openness concerning the proceedings at the Los Angeles and Brussels meetings. In response to this criticism ICANN's Ombudsman opened a probe into the closed door nature of these meetings in December 2012.&lt;ref name=Ombudsman_Probe /&gt;

Robin Gross, chair of ICANN's Noncommercial Stakeholders Group (NCSG) claimed that the NCSG was largely ignored during the proceedings, while the Business Constituency and Intellectual Property Constituency were overly represented.&lt;ref name=Robin_Gross_IGP /&gt; Using ICANN's Documentary Information Disclosure Program (DIDP) process, ICANN's version of a [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|FOIA]] request, the NCSG requested all information concerning the Los Angeles and Brussels meetings. In response, the NCSG received no new information&lt;ref name=ICANN_accountable /&gt;

The NCSG criticised the Brussels meeting immediately prior to it. In response, Fadi Chehade, CEO of ICANN, explained the purpose of the meeting in Brussels as simply an informal white board brainstorming session.&lt;ref name=ICA_Brussels /&gt; After the meeting Chehade wrote a blog post detailing what happened at the Brussels meeting.&lt;ref name=Chehade_Brussels /&gt;

====Red Cross / Red Crescent====
On June 25, 2014, ICANN's Governmental Advisory Committee (GAC) issued a comminuque entitled, "Protection of Red Cross / Red Crescent Names". The communique exempted the 'terms and names associated with the Red Cross and Red Crescent' from trademark protection while still affording them protected status. The communique advised that the names not be subject to policy considerations relating to trademark, because they cannot receive adequate treatment under trademark law. Instead the permanent protection of these names should be confirmed.&lt;ref name=GAC_on_Red_Cross_Crescent /&gt;

In response, ICANN's Generic Names Supporting Organization (GNSO) suggested the names simply be added to the Trademark Clearinghouse. The matter is still being debated.&lt;ref name=GAC_on_Red_Cross_Crescent /&gt;

==Protection services==
The Trademark Clearinghouse is not a rights protection mechanism itself. Instead, additional mechanisms coupled with the Trademark Clearinghouse help trademark owners protect their rights. There are two special time periods where trademark holders are given special treatment, ongoing notification services, and the URS. There are also differentiated services offered by specific registries. These build on the Trademark Clearinghouse to afford special treatment to trademark holders with verified trademarks in the Trademark Clearinghouse.&lt;ref name="TMCH_FAQ" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Basic_Intro_to_TMCH" /&gt;

===Sunrise period===
The sunrise period is a time period immediately prior to the launching of a TLD. Trademark Clearinghouse registrants receive priority access to reserve domain names associated with their trademarks before general access.&lt;ref name="TMCH_FAQ" /&gt; New gTLD registries are required to offer a sunrise period of at least 30 days.&lt;ref name="TMCH_FAQ" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Basic_Intro_to_TMCH" /&gt;

===Claims period===
During the claims period registrants attempting to register a second-level domain name under a TLD which utilizes the Trademark Clearinghouse will receive a warning if the name matches an entry in the Trademark Clearinghouse.&lt;ref name="TMCH_Video" /&gt; If the registrant registers the name anyway, the rights owner will receive a notification from the Trademark Claims system.&lt;ref name="TMCH_FAQ" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TMCH_Video" /&gt; The claims period is required to last at least 90 days after the initial launch of the new gTLD.&lt;ref name="TMCH_FAQ" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Basic_Intro_to_TMCH" /&gt;

===Ongoing notifications===
Rights holders with trademarks registered in the Trademark Clearinghouse can opt in to receive additional notifications after the claims period expires. Holders will be notified of exact matches to names they have registered in the Trademark Clearinghouse. This service is optional and free.&lt;ref name="ongoing" /&gt;

===Domain Protected Marks List===
Domain Protected Marks List (DPML) is a service offered by specific new gTLD registry operators based on the Trademark Clearinghouse. It is not a standard service offered to rights holders registered in the Trademark Clearinghouse, nor is it standardized by ICANN. Different registries will implement DPML differently as a means of marketplace differentiation. Typically registries will offer to defensively block registrations that are more than just exact matches.&lt;ref name=DPML /&gt;

==Uniform Rapid Suspension==

As part of the new gTLD program ICANN developed an accompanying rights protection mechanism for trademark holders called the Uniform Rapid Suspension (URS). Work on the URS started in September 2012 with an RFI issued by ICANN.&lt;ref name=URS_general /&gt; It was finalized in January 2014.&lt;ref name=india_URS /&gt;

The URS is not meant to replace the [[Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy]], but instead complement it. In contrast to the UDRP, the URS is meant as a lightweight, inexpensive, expedited arbitration process for resolving obvious trademark rights violations.&lt;ref name=URS_general /&gt; Unlike the UDRP, successful URS claims only cause a domain name to be suspended and redirected, not seized.&lt;ref name=URS_proc /&gt; Also, the URS is not intended for use where facts are in question.&lt;ref name=URS_proc /&gt; URS decisions can take as little as one week to resolve.&lt;ref name=URS_general /&gt;

Registries and registrars participating in the new gTLD program are required to implement the URS. In the context of the URS, they are called providers.&lt;ref name=URS_general /&gt;

===How it works===
Every URS claim starts with a complaint filed by a trademark holder against a registrant of a domain name they believe to be infringing their trademark.&lt;ref name=URS_proc /&gt; The complainant must also pay a one time non-refundable fee of $375.&lt;ref name=URS_proc /&gt;&lt;ref name=URS_gbu /&gt; Within two days of the complaint being filed an administrative review will be held by the URS provider.

If this review determines the complaint is in proper order the domain name will be locked, preventing changes to the DNS, and the allegedly offending registrant will be notified of the complaint. The registrant then has 14 calendar days to respond to the complaint before the complaint proceeds to default.&lt;ref name=URS_proc /&gt;

After the complaint has been filed and either a response has been received or the complaint has entered default, a single examiner selected by the provider determines the outcome. The examiner should then examine the evidence and issue a verdict using a standard of clear and convincing evidence.&lt;ref name=URS_proc /&gt;

The examiner should find in favor of the complainant if; the registered domain name is identical or confusingly similar to a word mark, the complainant holds a valid and current national or regional registration of the mark in question, this mark is registered and validated in the Trademark Clearinghouse, the registrant has no legitimate right or interest to the domain name, and the domain name was registered and is being used in bad faith. All standards must be met for the examiner to find in favor of the complainant.&lt;ref name=URS_proc /&gt;

If the examiner determines that the domain name is non-infringing use, or a [[Fair use (U.S. trademark law)|fair use]], the complaint should be dismissed.&lt;ref name=URS_proc /&gt; However, the URS guidelines do not define "fair use", nor do they indicate which specific jurisdiction's definition of "fair use" should be used.&lt;ref name=URS_proc /&gt;

===Examples===
In October 2014 the domain names radisson.club and radissonblu.club were suspended using the URS. Saravanan Dhandapani, acting as the first examiner for the National Arbitration Forum (NAF) and the Asian Domain Name Dispute Resolution Centre (ADNDRC), determined these two domain names infringed on the trademark of Radisson hotels.&lt;ref name=india_URS /&gt;

==Pricing==
As of October 2014 registering a single trademark can cost between $95 and $150 for one year. Three year and five year registrations are also available at reduced cost, as are bulk discounts. In general registering a single mark for one year will always be the most expensive option, while registering multiple marks for longer periods will incur greater discount.&lt;ref name=TMCH_Pricing /&gt;

Registries pay a one time fee to register between $7,000 - $10,000.&lt;ref name=registry_cost /&gt;

===Basic fee structure===
The basic fee structure is intended for registering small numbers of marks. It is only available to actual trademark holders, and not trademark agents. No bulk discounts are available, but discounts are given for registering marks for longer periods.&lt;ref name=TMCH_Pricing_Basic /&gt;

* $150 for 1 year
* $435 for 3 years
* $725 for 5 years

===Advanced fee structure===
The advanced fee structure is intended for registering large numbers of marks. It is available for trademark holders and agents, and requires the establishment of a prepayment account. Discounts are available when buying in bulk and when purchasing for longer periods.

The advanced fee structure uses a [[Loyalty program]] to encourage more trademark registrations. Registrants using it gain points for each registration. As more points are earned successive levels are reached, which decrease the cost of the next batch of registrations. In short, the more registrations a registrant makes, and the longer their duration, the cheaper they get.&lt;ref name=TMCH_Pricing_Advanced /&gt;

==Implementation==
ICANN has subcontracted out most of the functionality of the Trademark Clearinghouse to [[IBM]] and [[Deloitte]]. IBM handles the technical implementation, administration and support of the trademark database. Deloitte is responsible for authentication and validation of trademarks.&lt;ref name=TMCH_providers /&gt;

==Use==
On March 25, 2013, the Trademark Clearinghouse claimed it had "delivered over 500,000 Trademark Claims notices and prevented over 475,000 trademarked names from being registered."&lt;ref name=half_million_TM_notices_served /&gt;

Uptake on new [[Generic top-level domain|gTLDs]] has been brisk, with 426 new gTLDs introduced to the Internet as of October 17, 2014.&lt;ref name=gtld_stats /&gt;

'''Trademark share''' is a [[company]]'s share of [[Registered trademark|registered]] and [[unregistered trade mark]]s in a particular [[industry]] or market segment.  It is a key metric and one of many useful tools, when appropriately used, to understand how well positioned a company is to gain some competitive advantage (e.g. more [[Profit (accounting)|profit]] or [[revenue]], better [[Rate of return|ROI]] on [[Advertising campaign|ad campaigns]], defend or increase [[market share]]) within an industry or market segment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://insidetrademarks.com/?p=264 Inside Trademarks]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Wilson v. State''''', 652 S.E. 2d 501, 282 Ga. 520 (2007) was a [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] court case brought about to appeal the aggravated [[child molestation]] [[conviction]] of Genarlow Wilson (born April 8, 1986 to Juanessa Bennett and Marlow Wilson).

Wilson was convicted of aggravated child molestation in 2005, after, at the age of 17, he had engaged in [[oral sex]] with a 15-year-old at a New Year's Eve party, an offense carrying a mandatory penalty of 10 years' imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

At the time of his conviction, provisions for similarity in age that allowed underage consent to be taken into account were only applicable to vaginal sex. Because the case involved oral sex, the consent of the girl was not at that time legally relevant.&lt;ref name="NYT121906"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/19/us/19georgia.html?_r=3&amp;ex=157680000&amp;en=d32f07af9af73a11&amp;ei=5124&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin "Georgia Man Fights Conviction as Molester"] – ''[[New York Times]]'', Tuesday December 19, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atlantamagazine.com/article.php?id=158 Why is Genarlow Wilson in Prison?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070615135642/http://www.atlantamagazine.com/article.php?id=158 |date=June 15, 2007 }} – by Chandra R. Thomas, ''Atlanta Magazine''&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 26, 2007, the Georgia State Supreme Court, while not overturning the conviction itself, ruled that Wilson's sentence was disproportionate. He was released later that day, after serving over 4 years of his 10-year prison sentence in the [[Al Burruss Correctional Training Center]] in [[Forsyth, Georgia]].

==Background==
During a private New Year's Eve party that Wilson attended in a hotel room in 2003, when Wilson was 17 years old, multiple sex acts took place. Wilson engaged in oral sex with a 15-year-old girl, and the girl stated consistently that the act was consensual.

Additionally, Wilson engaged in sex with a 17-year-old girl,&lt;ref name="ABC"/&gt; who woke up the next morning naked and disoriented and claimed to have been raped,&lt;ref name=ESPN/&gt; which triggered an investigation. Police found condoms and evidence of drinking, as well as a video camera with footage of Wilson engaging in the sex acts, in the motel room used for the party.&lt;ref name=ABC/&gt; In the video, the 17-year-old girl appeared sleepy or intoxicated during the sex act but did not ask Wilson to stop.&lt;ref name=ABC/&gt;

==Legal process==

===Initial trial and plea deal===
The then 15-year-old girl has repeatedly stated that the act of oral sex was consensual,&lt;ref name="NYT121906" /&gt; though she legally could not consent. The jury acquitted Wilson of the rape charge, but as the [[age of consent]] in Georgia is 16, they voted to convict him of aggravated child molestation for the oral sex incident. Some jury members later complained they had not understood the verdict would result in a 10-year minimum sentence, plus one year on [[probation]].&lt;ref name="ESPN"&gt;''[http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/eticket/story?page=wilson Outrageous Injustice]'' – Thompson, Wright, [[ESPN]] website, January 24, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilson received the 10-year sentence following a refusal to enter into a proposed [[plea bargain]], stating his adamant belief that "It's all about doing what's right [...] And what's right is right, and what's wrong is wrong. And I'm just standing up for what I believe in."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=July 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; His decision to reject the plea agreement, as well as his continued fight to overturn his conviction, takes into account that [[sex offender]]s in Georgia must register themselves and are subject to penalty laws for life,&lt;ref name="ESPN"/&gt; and that the law was not intended to penalize teenage partners.&lt;ref&gt;http://abcnews.go.com/Primetime/LegalCenter/Story?id=1693362&amp;page=3 :A [[State legislature (United States)|state legislator]] who helped pass the molestation law said it was never meant to police teen sex. "The legislative intent was to protect women and children from sexual predators," said Rep. [[Tyrone Brooks]], a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] in the Georgia State Assembly.&lt;/ref&gt; As the law stands, Wilson would not even be able to return to his own family after an early release, as he has an 8-year-old sister Jiaya Bennett with whom he would be forbidden contact.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite web

After the jury had returned the guilty verdict, the prosecutor offered the same 5-year plea bargain again, and Wilson refused again. Another young man involved in the case had accepted a similar 5-year plea bargain and was paroled after two years.&lt;ref name=ESPN/&gt;

===Legislative action===
In part because of the publicity surrounding this case, the law under which Wilson was convicted was changed after his conviction; the act would now be treated as a [[misdemeanor]] with a maximum sentence of one year in prison, and no sex offender registration.&lt;ref name=ESPN/&gt; While Wilson's attorneys argued that such a change in the law should reverse his conviction,&lt;ref&gt;Petition for a Writ of Certiorari, filed by Brenda Joy Bernstein in the Georgia Supreme Court&lt;/ref&gt; the Legislature specifically prohibited the bill from being applied [[Ex post facto law|retroactively]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legis.ga.gov/legis/2005_06/versions/hb1059_HB_1059_AP_11.htm House Bill 1059] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070705095142/http://www.legis.ga.gov/legis/2005_06/versions/hb1059_HB_1059_AP_11.htm |date=July 5, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A bipartisan group of legislators introduced a bill in the 2007 Georgia legislative session that would allow Wilson's sentence to be reduced by the courts. This session was adjourned in April, before the bill could be considered.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emanueljones.com/070406.htm Genarlow Wilson: search for justice continues] – Press release by State Senator Emanuel Jones, 10th District of Georgia&lt;/ref&gt; Several legislators have subsequently called for a rare special session of the Legislature to reconsider the bill.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ajc.com/metro/content/metro/stories/2007/06/18/0619metwilson.html Law change sought in Genarlow Wilson case] – by Carlos Campos, ''[[Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]'', June 18, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

After the trial ended, the [[District Attorney]]'s office received numerous open record requests for the videotape. David McDade inquired of the Prosecuting Attorneys' Council of Georgia whether the videotape had to be released under the Open Records Act. The Council concluded that "if no one has filed for a protection order ... claiming that disclosure of the video tape would invade individual privacy, we can find no reason why disclosure of the video tape is not required under ... the Open Records Act."&lt;ref&gt;http://edition.cnn.com/2007/US/07/13/teen.sex/index.html, CNN, July 13, 2007, retrieved December 11, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Ignoring the fact that it was the Legislature that wrote the Open Records Law (and which caused the initial controversy by refusing to apply the "Romeo and Juliet" clause retroactively), Georgia State Sen. Emanuel Jones said he would introduce legislation to block district attorneys from handing over photographic images in sex cases. "'I'm going to call it the David McDade Act,' Jones said. 'Sometimes we have to protect our kids from district attorneys.'"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2007-07-13-teen-sex-tape_N.htm Prosecutor Under Fire in Teen Sex Case], Associated Press, July 13, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Because the participants shown having sex in the video were under 18, the videotape constitutes [[child pornography]] under [[federal law]].  The [[Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act]] prohibits prosecutors from allowing defendants in criminal proceedings to possess a copy of any evidence that constitutes child pornography, even if the purpose is to mount a defense against the charge. Under this law, Wilson and his defense team are prohibited from having a copy of the videotape that prosecutor McDade has distributed to anyone else who has requested it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blogdenovo.org/archives/001747.html Genarlow Wilson Needs the Walsh Act]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Appeals===
The case was appealed to the [[Supreme Court of Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia Supreme Court]]; the court twice refused to hear the case, with the presiding judge delivering an opinion that said she was "very sympathetic to Wilson's argument" but that she was bound by the Legislature's decision to make the law not apply retroactively.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.gasupreme.us/pdf/s06c1689.pdf Order of the Court, Wilson v. State] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070616124541/http://www.gasupreme.us/pdf/s06c1689.pdf |date=June 16, 2007 }} (PDF document)]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The governor does not have [[pardon]] power in Georgia, but the prosecutor has the power to set aside the verdict. The prosecutor Eddie Barker, apparently waiting for an admission of guilt, has said "the one person who can change things at this point is Genarlow. The ball's in his court."

===''Habeas'' petition===

In response to a petition of ''[[habeas corpus]]'' filed by Wilson's attorneys, the Superior Court of Monroe County in the State of Georgia reduced Wilson's charge to misdemeanor aggravated child molestation, ordered that his name not be placed on the sex-offender registry, and resentenced him to 12 months and with credit for time served. Stated Judge Thomas Wilson (no relation), "The fact that Genarlow Wilson has spent two years in prison for what is now classified as a misdemeanor, and without assistance from this Court, will spend eight more years in prison, is a grave miscarriage of justice."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.myfoxatlanta.com/myfox/pages/News/Detail?contentId=3458253&amp;version=5&amp;locale=EN-US&amp;layoutCode=TSTY&amp;pageId=3.2.1 Judge Rules for Genarlow Wilson in Teen Sex Case]&lt;/ref&gt;

Georgia's [[Attorney General of Georgia|Attorney General]] [[Thurbert Baker]] has appealed Judge Wilson's decision, staying Genarlow Wilson's release. Baker maintains the judge did not have the authority to overturn the conviction and says there is a [[plea bargain]] offer on the table.&lt;ref&gt;Georgia Attorney General Thurbert Baker's Open Letter regarding the Genarlow Wilson Case: http://www.state.ga.us/ago/pdfs/TEB_Letter_for_Website.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070709205052/http://www.state.ga.us/ago/pdfs/TEB_Letter_for_Website.pdf |date=July 9, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Baker, the plea deal could allow Wilson to be eligible for First Offender Treatment, which would mean that he would not have a criminal record nor would he be subject to registering on the sex offender registry once his sentence had been completed. It could also result in Wilson receiving a reduced sentence, possibly leading to his release based upon time already served. Wilson's lawyer, B.J. Bernstein, would not accept the proposed deal because it would require her client to plead guilty to a felony with a fifteen-year sentence, forcing him to register as a sexual offender for up to fifteen years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/06/11/teen.sex.case/index.html Last minute appeal in teen sex case sparks outrage]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bond hearing====
Following the grant of ''habeas'' and Baker's appeal, Bernstein urged prosecutors to allow her client to be set free on [[bail|bond]] until the appeal could be heard. Whitney Tilson, a New York City investment manager, and others offered to finance a million dollar bond on Wilson's behalf, but District Attorney McDade noted that Wilson's crime, aggravated child molestation, prevented him from being released on bond. Douglas County Superior Court Judge David Emerson agreed with McDade and canceled a scheduled bond hearing. Bernstein announced that she would file an appeal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macon.com/149/story/76411.html Judge says no bond for Genarlow Wilson, cancels hearing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629130002/http://www.macon.com/149/story/76411.html |date=June 29, 2007 }}, by Shannon McCaffrey, Associated Press, June 27, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

====Georgia Supreme Court appeal hearing====
On July 9, 2007, the [[Supreme Court of Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia State Supreme Court]] set a hearing for Genarlow Wilson's appeal for July 20, 2007, more than two months earlier than previously scheduled. The first motion was an appeal by the State Attorney General Baker of the Monroe County Superior Court judge's decision to reduce Wilson's felony conviction to a misdemeanor and release him. The second motion was brought by Wilson's attorneys to have him released on bond while the appeals are heard which the Douglas County Superior Court judge denied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Although society has a significant interest in protecting children from premature sexual activity, we must acknowledge that Wilson's crime does not rise to the level of culpability of adults who prey on children and that, for the law to punish Wilson as it would an adult, with the extraordinarily harsh punishment of ten years in prison without the possibility of probation or parole, appears to be grossly disproportionate to his crime."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The dissenting opinion said that the legislators had explicitly made the law non-[[Ex post facto law|retroactive]] and, therefore, should not be applied to Wilson. The majority opinion claimed, however, that it did not apply the law retroactively but instead that the punishment was unconstitutionally [[Cruel and unusual punishment|cruel and unusual]].&lt;ref name="CNN102607"&gt;{{cite web

==Reaction==
On December 21, 2006, ''[[The New York Times]]'' published an editorial&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; condemning the Georgia Supreme Court's original refusal to hear Wilson's appeal, noting that Wilson was not a sexual predator, and that his behavior would have only been a misdemeanor if he had actually had sex with the girl, instead of having had oral sex (due to a loophole in the applicable law's provision intended to prevent exactly this kind of dubious conviction).

Oral sex has long had a special criminal status in Georgia law; until 1998, oral sex even between husband and wife was punishable with up to 20 years in prison.&lt;ref name=ABC&gt;''[http://abcnews.go.com/Primetime/LegalCenter/story?id=1693362&amp;page=1 Outrage After Teen Gets 10 Years for Oral Sex With Girl]'' – ABC News, February 7, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  The United States Supreme Court, in 1986,  originally upheld Georgia's anti-sodomy law (which covered both oral sex and anal sex) as constitutional even when applied to criminalize two consenting adults in the privacy of their bedroom (''[[Bowers v. Hardwick]]'', [[Case citation|478 U.S. 176]]).   Twelve years later, Georgia's Supreme Court would, however, find that the same law upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court was unconstitutional on state constitutional grounds, at least as applied to oral sex with persons over the age of consent (''[[Powell v. Georgia]]'', [[Case citation|S98A0755, 270 Ga. 327, 510 S.E. 2d 18]] (1998)).

On April 30, 2007, ''The New York Times'' published another editorial noting that Georgia's legislature had closed the loophole in the law and that if Wilson were tried today he would now be facing only misdemeanor charges for the same act. However, the State Senate adjourned for the year without taking up a bill allowing judges to review previous cases like Wilson's and Wilson continued to serve a mandatory 10-year sentence. The ''Times'' also noted that Wilson's attorneys had applied for a writ of ''habeas corpus'' with the U.S. Supreme Court and it urged the Court to grant it. In the same editorial, the ''Times'' lambasted prosecuting district attorney David McDade for continuing to publicly charge that Wilson participated in gang-raping a different 17-year-old girl, even though he was acquitted of charges in that case.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/30/opinion/30mon3.html Georgia’s Shame]" – ''[[The New York Times]]'', Monday April 30, 2007 "Every day that young Genarlow Wilson remains in prison for consensual sexual activity is a further indictment against the prosecutors, lawmakers and judges of the Georgia legal system. Lawyers for Mr. Wilson have applied for a writ of habeas corpus to challenge his cruel and unusual 10-year sentence. The Superior Court should grant it."&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 24, 2007, former US president [[Jimmy Carter]] wrote a letter to state attorney-general [[Thurbert Baker]] (who is also African-American) in which he questioned whether Wilson's race had played a role in his treatment. He wrote: "The racial dimension of the case is likewise hard to ignore and perhaps unfortunately has had an impact on the final outcome of the case," pointing out that white defendants have received lesser punishments for similar conduct.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ledger-enquirer.com/251/story/53150.html Judge to rule Monday in Ga. teen sex case]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''[[Columbus Ledger-Enquirer|Ledger-Enquirer]]'', June 6, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the June ruling in Monroe County, both Attorney General Baker and Georgia Governor [[Sonny Perdue]] expressed concern that other convicted child molesters might attempt similar legal tactics to get out of prison. While Baker called the Wilson sentence "harsh", he also noted that he had taken an oath to uphold state law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ajc.com/metro/content/metro/stories/2007/06/14/0614wilson.html?imw=Y Baker defends Wilson appeal] – by Jeremy Redmon and James Salzer, ''The Atlanta Journal-Constitution'', June 15, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Black leaders such as Rev. [[Joseph Lowery]], Dr. [[Francys Johnson]], the Rev. Jesse Jackson and the [[Congressional Black Caucus]] have criticized Baker's appeal of the Monroe County ruling. Meanwhile, Rev. Markel Hutchins, a civil rights activist in Atlanta, has criticized them for not having all the facts and failing to stand up for the victims in the case. He also questioned the motivations of Wilson's attorney, Bernstein, and urged her to attempt to find a resolution in the case.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macon.com/220/story/67785.html Civil rights leader meets with DA, AG in Genarlow Wilson case]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} – by Shannon McCaffrey, [[Associated Press]], June 15, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

On Genarlow's behalf, the NAACP, led by Dr. [[Francys Johnson]], also marched on Douglas County, Georgia, for the injustice done. There were many participants there, including the girl's mother who stated that she forgave Genarlow and was in favor of his release. The speakers targeted Douglas County judicial system and particularly David McDade for his unfair treatment.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}

The '''Worst Forms of Child Labour Recommendation'''  was adopted by the [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO) in 1999 as ILO Recommendation No 190.&lt;ref name="Recommendation R190"/&gt; The provisions of this Recommendation supplement those of the [[Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention]] (Convention No 182, referred to below as ‘the Convention’) and should be applied in conjunction with them. This article should be read together with that on the Convention.

The provisions of the Recommendation include the following:&lt;ref name="Recommendation R190"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:12100:0::NO:12100:P12100_INSTRUMENT_ID:312528:NO|title=R190 - Worst Forms of Child Labour Recommendation, 1999 (No. 190)|work=[[International Labour Organization]]|date=17 June 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*What programmes of action referred to in Article 6 of the [[Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention]] should aim at (Article I);
*What should be considered when ratifying countries determine in terms of Article 3(d) of the Convention what the [[Worst Forms of Hazards faced by Children at Work]] in those countries are (Article II);
*That detailed information and statistical data on the nature and extent of child labour should be compiled and kept up to date (Article III(5) to (7);
*That ratifying countries should establish or designate appropriate national mechanisms to monitor the implementation of national provisions for the prohibition and elimination of the worst forms of child labour (Article III(8));
*That ratifying countries should, in so far as it is compatible with national law, cooperate with international efforts aimed at the prohibition and elimination of the worst forms of child labour (Article III(11));
*That ratifying countries should provide that the [[Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention#Predefined worst forms of child labour|pre-defined ''worst forms of child labour'']] are criminal offences and also provide for other criminal, civil or administrative remedies to ensure the effective enforcement of national provisions for the prohibition and elimination of the worst forms of child labour (Article III(12) to (14));
*A list of other measures that could be used to prohibit and eliminate the worst forms of child labour (Article III(15));
*That enhanced international cooperation and/or assistance among ratifying countries for the prohibition and effective elimination of the worst forms of child labour should complement national efforts (Article III(16)).
