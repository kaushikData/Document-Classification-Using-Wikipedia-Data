The '''1981 Entumbane uprising''', also known as the '''Battle of Bulawayo''' or '''Entumbane II''', occurred between 8 and 12 February 1981 in and around [[Bulawayo]], Zimbabwe amid political tensions in the newly independent state. [[Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army]] (ZIPRA) guerrillas, mainly in the city's western suburb of Entumbane, rebelled, creating a situation that threatened to develop into a fresh civil war, barely a year after the end of the [[Rhodesian Bush War|Bush War]]. The [[Rhodesian African Rifles]] (RAR) and other white-commanded elements of the former [[Rhodesian Security Forces]], fighting for the Zimbabwean government as part of the new [[Zimbabwe National Army]], put down the uprising. Groups of [[Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army]] (ZANLA) fighters attacked both ZIPRA and the government forces during the revolt, which followed a smaller [[1980 Entumbane clashes|outbreak]] of fighting between guerrillas in November 1980.

The uprising began in earnest around 20:00 local time (CAT) on 11 February when fighting broke out between the two guerrilla factions in Entumbane, each of which also attacked the local RAR headquarters. When ZIPRA [[armoured personnel carrier]]s moved on Bulawayo from [[Esigodini|Essexvale]], to the south-east, four armoured cars from the former [[Rhodesian Armoured Corps]], supported by A Company, 1RAR, engaged and defeated them. Meanwhile, C and D Companies, 1RAR were pocketed by numerically superior groups of ZIPRA fighters. By the evening of 12 February, the uprising was over; C and D Companies were relieved, ZIPRA ceased their attacks and their armoured battle group at Essexvale surrendered to the National Army.

The official count of those killed during the uprising was 260 people; historians place the number of dead higher. The Zimbabwe National Army suffered no fatal casualties. Binda calls the battle the RAR's greatest victory, writing that the troops were greatly outnumbered, but won through superior professionalism and discipline. Several analysts comment on the irony that Mugabe and ZANU–PF were saved from a major rebellion by white-led ex-Rhodesian troops. The battle was the RAR's last; its personnel were reassigned to other units when it was disbanded later in 1981. The rebellion's defeat, meanwhile, prompted mass desertions by ZIPRA guerrillas fearing retribution from the Mugabe administration. Indeed, the uprising partially fuelled Mugabe's bloody ''[[Gukurahundi]]'' campaign against [[Matabeleland]] later in the 1980s.

==Background==

===''Chimurenga''===
[[File:Zimbabwe in Africa.svg|thumb|Zimbabwe, highlighted in red on a map of Africa|alt=A map. See description]]
Following the [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|Unilateral Declaration of Independence]] by the mostly white minority government of [[Rhodesia]] (or [[Southern Rhodesia]]) from the United Kingdom in 1965, the southern African country entered a period of international isolation as an [[list of historical unrecognized states|unrecognised state]] under [[Ian Smith]]. Black nationalist movements, backed by communist powers and themselves variously [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist–Leninist]], launched military campaigns to overthrow Rhodesia's Government and bring majority rule to the country; the main nationalist groups were the [[Zimbabwe African National Union]] (ZANU), which was Chinese-backed, mostly [[Shona people|Shona]] and influenced by [[Maoism]], and the rival [[Zimbabwe African People's Union]] (ZAPU), which was largely [[Northern Ndebele people|Ndebele]], more orthodoxly Marxist–Leninist and supported by the [[Warsaw Pact]] and associated nations, prominently Cuba.{{sfn|Wood|2005|pp=173–175}}{{sfn|Duignan|Gann|1994|pp=31–36}} Each nationalist group fielded a guerrilla army—ZANU's was called the [[Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army]] (ZANLA), while ZAPU's was the [[Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army]] (ZIPRA). ZAPU was led by [[Joshua Nkomo]], a trade unionist from [[Bulawayo]] in [[Matabeleland]],{{sfn|Wood|2005|pp=95–96}} while ZANU was headed from 1975 by a former teacher from [[Mashonaland]], [[Robert Mugabe]].{{sfn|Cilliers|1984|pp=22–24}}{{sfn|Meredith|2007|pp=22–23}}

The black nationalist campaigns, referred to by the revolutionaries as the Second ''[[Chimurenga]]'' (liberation war), began in earnest in December 1972.{{sfn|Binda|2008|pp=133–136}} During the ensuing [[Rhodesian Bush War|Bush War]], ZANLA and ZIPRA fought the [[Rhodesian Security Forces]], and also regularly clashed with each other, despite their parent organisations being superficially allied from 1976 as the Patriotic Front.{{sfn|Preston|2005|pp=127–128}} The war ended in December 1979 with the [[Lancaster House Agreement]] in London, following which Britain took interim direct control of the country to oversee [[Southern Rhodesian general election, 1980|fresh elections]] during early 1980. These were won by ZANU, which added "Patriotic Front" to its name (thereby becoming "ZANU–PF"), and Mugabe became the first Prime Minister of Zimbabwe when the UK granted independence in April 1980. Nkomo was made Minister of Home Affairs in the new Government.{{sfn|Kriger|2003|p=63}}

===Post-independence tensions===
[[File:President Zimbabwe , Robert Mugabe bezoekt Nederland Robert Mugabe , kop, Bestanddeelnr 932-1922.jpg|thumb|upright|Prime Minister [[Robert Mugabe]] in 1982]]
With the transfer of political power, the Rhodesian Army, ZANLA and ZIPRA began to be merged to form the new [[Zimbabwe National Army]]. ZANLA and ZIPRA personnel were mixed into new battalions, guerrillas were picked out for officer training, and old Rhodesian units were variously disbanded or earmarked for reform. In some cases the latter meant only a change of symbolism and nomenclature; the [[Rhodesian Air Force]], for example, remained almost all white as the [[Air Force of Zimbabwe]].{{sfn|Kriger|2003|pp=109–110}} Every one of the approximately 34,000 guerrillas was promised a place in the new army. In the meantime they would wait in respective ZANLA and ZIPRA assembly camps around the country with pay and rations identical to those of black [[private (rank)|privates]] in the old Rhodesian forces.{{sfn|Kriger|2003|pp=68–69}}

Though the ''Chimurenga'' was over, tensions between ZANLA and ZIPRA cadres, officially referred to in the war's aftermath as "associated forces", endured, particularly in Matabeleland. These rifts were partially tribal-based, but largely political; ZIPRA fighters complained that their counterparts from ZANLA seemed to be favoured for promotions and supplies,{{sfn|Kriger|2003|pp=68–69}} while ZANLA suspected ZIPRA of plotting insurrection.{{sfn|Meredith|2007|p=59}} ZANU–PF politicians began to call for a [[one-party state]], saying that this would make Zimbabwe stronger.{{sfn|Meredith|2007|p=60}} As the process of military integration dragged on, groups of fighters from both forces deserted and roamed the countryside, robbing stores and killing white farmers. Sources differ regarding how much of this was perpetrated by ZANLA personnel and how much by ZIPRA men; each side blamed the other.{{sfn|Meredith|2007|p=60}}{{sfn|Hill|2005|pp=75–76}} Mugabe accused ZIPRA elements of "refusing to recognise the sovereignty of the Government",{{sfn|Meredith|2007|p=60}} but stopped short of attacking the ZAPU leadership.{{sfn|Meredith|2007|p=60}} With the new army's ex-guerrilla battalions still far from ready, the Zimbabwean Government leaned heavily on former Rhodesian units under white command to maintain law and order during this period.{{sfn|Kriger|2003|pp=109–110}}{{sfn|Hawkins|1981}}  Feeling he needed to secure ZANU–PF's position, Mugabe signed a secret deal with North Korea in October 1980 whereby the Asian country would provide instructors and equipment for an elite brigade that would handle political dissidents and report directly to the Prime Minister.{{sfn|Meredith|2007|p=62}}

After the Minister of Finance [[Enos Nkala]] railed against Nkomo and ZAPU at a Bulawayo political rally in November 1980, saying they had "become the enemy of ZANU–PF" and should be challenged by "vigilante committees",{{sfn|Meredith|2007|p=61}} ZANLA and ZIPRA veterans [[1980 Entumbane clashes|clashed]] near the city's western township of Entumbane for two days.{{sfn|Meredith|2007|p=61}} Hundreds were killed or wounded before the Prime Minister sent ex-Rhodesian units to intervene.{{sfn|Binda|2007|p=384}} This incident deepened the feeling of distrust and unease that permeated the country and the National Army's integrated battalions.{{sfn|Meredith|2007|p=61}} Concerned by ZAPU's apparent political marginalisation, ZIPRA commanders in Matabeleland built up their forces. Over 6,000 ZIPRA troops assembled at Gwaai River Mine, to the north-west of Bulawayo, with Soviet-made [[T-34]] tanks, [[BTR-152]] [[armoured personnel carrier]]s (APCs) and anti-aircraft guns; another ZIPRA base at [[Esigodini|Essexvale]], to the south-east, formed an armoured battle group including 10 T-34s.{{sfn|Binda|2007|p=385}} Tensions escalated further when Mugabe removed Nkomo from Home Affairs on 10 January 1981 and made him a [[minister without portfolio]] instead, in what many in Zimbabwe saw as a demotion.{{sfn|Binda|2007|p=385}}{{sfn|Meredith|2007|p=77}} According to Brigadier Mike Shute, then head of the Zimbabwe National Army's 1&amp;nbsp;Brigade, groups of ZANLA and ZIPRA guerrillas, theoretically under his command, were soon "all over the place and having continual clashes and minor battles with each other".{{sfn|Binda|2007|p=385}} Many became convinced that a second civil war was imminent.{{sfn|Meredith|2007|pp=59, 61}}

The Zimbabwe National Army's only regular infantry unit in the Bulawayo area during the first months of 1981 was the 1st Battalion of the [[Rhodesian African Rifles]] (RAR), a regiment of mostly white-officered black troops led by Lieutenant-Colonel Mick McKenna and based at Methuen Barracks on the outskirts of Bulawayo. This had been officially redesignated the 11th Infantry Battalion of the new National Army, but few reforms had taken place so far and in practice the regiment remained almost entirely as before, right down to the old Rhodesian uniforms and insignia. At the end of January 1981, McKenna had about 500 men (including officers), and a troop of four [[Eland Mk7|Eland 90]] armoured cars, formerly of the [[Rhodesian Armoured Corps]], under Sergeant Stephen "Skippy" Devine, an Australian veteran of the [[Rhodesian Light Infantry]].{{sfn|Binda|2007|p=385}}

Amid the rising tensions in Zimbabwe, Shute and McKenna identified Entumbane, the township on the western outskirts of Bulawayo where the November 1980 clashes had started, as a likely flashpoint. There ZANLA and ZIPRA had camps directly next to each other, each with about 1,500 guerrillas. In late January 1981, McKenna set up an operational headquarters in a beer hall overlooking the two guerrilla camps; this building, surrounded by six-foot walls, was dubbed "[[Alamo Mission in San Antonio|the Alamo]]" at the suggestion of Lieutenant F&amp;nbsp;W "Chomps" Fleetwood, an American officer in A Company, 1RAR. Worried that a new Entumbane clash would prompt the ZIPRA forces at Gwaai River Mine and Essexvale to join the fray, McKenna set up a string of observation posts on each of the roads leading towards Bulawayo.{{sfn|Binda|2007|p=385}}

On 8 February, ZANLA cadres at Connemara Barracks in [[Gweru|Gwelo]] surprised their ZIPRA counterparts, killed over 60 of them and forced the rest to flee into the bush. When the ZIPRA portion of the 13th Infantry Battalion, based at Glenville Camp near Entumbane, learned of this later in the day, it waited until its instructors from the [[British Army]] left in the evening, then attacked its ZANLA comrades, killing 12 of them and scattering the rest. Charged with restoring order, McKenna sent Devine's armoured cars and D Company, 1RAR, commanded by the American Lieutenant Dave Hill, to Glenville. Arriving late in the evening, the Elands drove into the camp and flattened the ZIPRA tents, killing many of the occupants and clearing the way for Hill's troops. Taken totally by surprise, the ZIPRA troops put up little resistance; 40 were killed and many more captured, including two officers, Captains Mpofu and Dlamini.{{sfn|Binda|2007|p=385}} On the morning of 9 February, the British instructors were bewildered to find the ZANLA half of their unit gone, and the remaining ZIPRA men squatting in rows in 1RAR captivity. "What happened?" asked the British sergeant. "I am afraid that while you were away, your battalion fell apart," replied McKenna.{{sfn|Stiff|2000|p=80}}

ZIPRA personnel in Bulawayo used civilian vehicles to smuggle weapons and equipment, including mortars, into their Entumbane camp over the next few days. C Company, 1RAR, comprising 96 men under Major [[Lionel Dyck]] (including a detachment from Support Company) and eight armoured vehicles, noticed this while they were garrisoning the Alamo on 11 February. The major reported to Brigade headquarters that the number of ZIPRA troops at Entumbane appeared to have swelled considerably, and that the chain link fence surrounding the camp had been taken down. Superiors ordered him not to intervene. Anticipating an imminent attack, Dyck used a silenced rifle to shoot out the floodlights surrounding the Alamo, lined up his vehicles against the surrounding walls so his men could stand on them while defending, and ranged mortars on a variety of targets in the ZIPRA complex.{{sfn|Binda|2007|p=386}}

==Uprising==
[[File:1RAR at Metheun.jpg|thumb|270px|1RAR troops atop [[Mine Protected Combat Vehicle|MPCV]] vehicles prior to Entumbane]]
Soon after fighting broke out between ZANLA and ZIPRA members of a recently integrated Zimbabwe National Army battalion at Ntabazinduna, just north-east of Bulawayo,{{sfn|Meredith|2007|pp=61–62}} the two guerrilla camps at Entumbane began exchanging rifle, machine gun and mortar fire at about 20:00 (CAT) on 11 February. Dyck, at the Alamo, reported that both sides were also attacking his position. He radioed Brigade HQ for instructions and was told to pull out; he replied that this was impossible as he was surrounded. At Shute's orders, McKenna mobilised the rest of the battalion at an airfield near Brady Barracks within an hour. Meanwhile, a detachment of ZIPRA armoured vehicles left Essexvale for Bulawayo, and was spotted on the road by one of McKenna's observation posts. Devine was sent with his Elands to intercept them, supported by 12 1RAR men under Major Tony Husher. At an intersection on the outskirts of the city, Devine encountered a ZIPRA BTR-152 APC and impacted it with a single [[High-explosive anti-tank warhead|high-explosive anti-tank]] (HEAT) round, killing all 20 combatants inside. McKenna then told Devine to advance to the city limits, where he and Husher set up an ambush on the road. Husher's men shot out all nearby overhead street lights, and some of them went to scout ahead; Devine positioned two of his Elands on each of the two lanes of the road under cover of darkness.{{sfn|Binda|2007|pp=386–387}}

Meanwhile, at Entumbane, the ZIPRA fighters overran the ZANLA camp, killing many and forcing the rest to flee.{{sfn|Binda|2007|pp=387–388}} Sporadic fighting between ZANLA and ZIPRA guerrillas spread into Bulawayo itself, continuing through the night and into the morning.{{sfn|Hawkins|1981}} About 700 ZIPRA combatants continued to attack C Company's position at the Alamo, putting it under constant machine gun and mortar fire. Pocketed, Dyck responded in kind. About 02:00 (CAT) on 12 February, a ZIPRA guerrilla with an [[RPD machine gun]] took up a position in a house to the Alamo's south-east and "became a nuisance", as the major put it; he and Sergeant Vini Hlatshwayo went out with an [[RPG-7]] rocket launcher and fired at the corner of the house, bringing it down on the gunner and killing him.{{sfn|Binda|2007|pp=387–388}}

On the road, two ZIPRA BTR-152s from Essexvale advanced towards Bulawayo, firing indiscriminately in all directions, and were spotted by Devine around 01:30 (CAT). The Elands waited in the darkness until the ZIPRA vehicles were about {{convert|200|m}} away, then fired. Both APCs were directly hit and most of the men inside killed; the survivors ran off into the night. Fleetwood then arrived at the head of a 1RAR platoon to support Devine and Husher. Around the same time, men of A Company, 1RAR captured a ZIPRA commander who was trying to enter Bulawayo through a back road in a Peugeot station wagon, and 3&amp;nbsp;Platoon, A Company captured six ZIPRA officers driving into town on the Essexvale Road in a [[Toyota Land Cruiser]]. McKenna ordered Hill and D Company to help Dyck by taking up a position between the city and Entumbane. A group of ZIPRA unsuccessfully attacked D Company as it moved west to high ground at Lurkers' Ridge, just south-east of the Alamo. B Company, meanwhile, took up positions on the railway line just north-east of Lurkers' Ridge. McKenna told Dyck over the radio that reinforcements would come and to "hang in there".{{sfn|Binda|2007|pp=387–388}}

By about 05:00 (CAT), Dyck's ammunition supplies were running low, and the ZIPRA attackers had hit the Alamo a number of times with RPG fire. Nobody inside was killed by these rockets, but when Dyck's dog was wounded, the major flew into a rage and ordered his men to pour more aggressive machine gun fire on the advancing ZIPRA combatants. He requested air support from Brigade HQ in the form of a [[Cessna Skymaster|Lynx]] light bomber. The air force turned down the request, but Flight Lieutenant Colin James took off anyway in his Lynx armed with an [[FN MAG]] machine gun and [[SNEB]] rockets. The ZIPRA cadres concentrated a huge amount of fire on James' aircraft, and hit it several times, but failed to shoot it down; the pilot put in a number of ground attacks before returning to base. He reported afterwards that a bullet had entered through the floor of his cockpit and hit his helmet. The 1RAR officers and men expressed great admiration for James's bravery during this air strike, but his air force superiors were furious that he had gone into the operational area against orders.{{sfn|Binda|2007|pp=388–389}}

A National Army relief column including the detachments under Husher, Fleetwood and Devine assembled at Lurkers' Ridge during the morning of 12 February. Under the command of Captain Tony Clark, it flanked through the townships south of the Alamo, engaging ZIPRA guerrillas along the way, then turned north to relieve Dyck. The Elands led the way, with Devine himself standing upright in the turret of one of them with a machine gun. At one point this was shot out of his hands, prompting him to briefly stop the advance so he could jump down into the street to collect it. By the time the relief column reached the Alamo at 13:00 (CAT), C Company had been pocketed for 16 hours. Four wounded 1RAR soldiers were evacuated, and Dyck left the building to point out targets for Devine's armoured cars. During the afternoon, A Company relieved D Company at Lurker's Ridge, and the ZANLA and ZIPRA guerrillas withdrew into the townships and the surrounding country, sporadically exchanging fire. Devine was sent to Essexvale to engage the rest of ZIPRA's armoured battle group, which surrendered when he arrived; the T-34 tanks were later found by the Zimbabwe National Army to be nonfunctional. By the evening of 12 February, the rebellion was over.{{sfn|Binda|2007|pp=388–389}}

==Aftermath==
Hundreds of people died in the uprising. The official count released at the time was 260,{{sfn|Binda|2007|p=389}} but historians place the number higher; [[Martin Meredith]] records "more than 300" dead,{{sfn|Meredith|2007|p=62}} while Alexandre Binda writes that the Zimbabwe National Army units alone killed over 400 guerrillas.{{sfn|Binda|2007|p=389}} The Zimbabwe National Army reported no fatal casualties.{{sfn|Binda|2007|p=389}} Hill and Husher were each awarded the [[Bronze Cross of Zimbabwe]] for their part in putting down the rebellion, while Dyck received the Silver Cross.{{sfn|Binda|2007|p=388}} In his history of the Rhodesian African Rifles, Binda describes Entumbane as the regiment's greatest victory, commenting that it was won "by dint of professionalism, discipline and determination" in the face of forces that were far larger numerically.{{sfn|Binda|2007|p=385}} Major Michael P Stewart of the [[United States Army]] writes that 1RAR's actions at Entumbane "saved Mugabe's Government from certain civil war", and provided the "final blow to the military might of ZIPRA".{{sfn|Stewart|2012|p=103}} A number of analysts comment on the irony that Mugabe and ZANU–PF, who had spent years fighting white rule and the Rhodesian forces during the 1970s, were secured in power barely a year after the Bush War's end by ex-Rhodesian troops under white command.{{sfn|Binda|2007|p=385}}{{sfn|Hawkins|1981}} Binda furthermore highlights the irony that the RAR's finest hour (in his view) came while fighting for Mugabe.{{sfn|Binda|2007|p=385}}

Mugabe said that undisciplined ZIPRA guerrillas had instigated the uprising; he called them "disloyal, misguided and politically motivated armed hooligans and political malcontents" and said that according to information before him their ultimate goal had been to topple his government.{{sfn|Kriger|2003|p=79}} He told parliament that there had been a "definite organised pattern" amid the ZIPRA groups that had rebelled.{{sfn|Hawkins|1981}} Local ZIPRA commanders claimed ZANLA had started the fighting, while Nkomo and the mayor of Bulawayo blamed Nkala's inflammatory speech and similar statements from other ZANU–PF politicians.{{sfn|Kriger|2003|p=79}} A month after the uprising, ZANU–PF set up a commission tasked with investigating the "mutinous disturbances" at Entumbane and in the integrated battalions at Ntabazinduna, Glenville and Connemara. This body reported to Mugabe in June 1981, but its findings have never been made public. According to the historian Norma Kriger, it blamed both ZANU–PF and ZAPU and therefore "fell short of Government expectations".{{sfn|Kriger|2003|p=79}}

Abiodun Alao of [[King's College London]] marks the Entumbane episode as the start of the Zimbabwe National Army's politicisation.{{sfn|Alao|2012|p=63}} The ex-Rhodesians' enthusiasm and success during the battle, coupled with Mugabe's readiness to deploy them, convinced many in ZAPU that ZANU–PF and the white community had united against them,{{sfn|Alao|2012|p=50}} and intensified ZAPU opposition to the government.{{sfn|Kriger|2003|p=79}} ZIPRA guerrillas deserted from the assembly points and the National Army ''en masse'' following the rebellion's failure, fearing for their safety.{{sfn|Binda|2007|p=389}} Mugabe's sense of resolve regarding his political rivals was greatly strengthened, meanwhile; Entumbane satisfied him that white army officers and airmen could be counted on in future conflicts with ZAPU.{{sfn|Alao|2012|p=81}} The Entumbane engagement was the RAR's last—its companies were allocated to other 1&amp;nbsp;Brigade units later in 1981 during the military reform process{{sfn|Binda|2007|p=384}}—but a number of its white officers subsequently led units of the [[Special Forces of Zimbabwe|Zimbabwean special forces]] during the 1980s. Dyck, for example, headed the 1st Parachute Battalion.{{sfn|Alao|2012|p=87}}

The Mugabe administration promptly decided to reduce the future army's size by about 30,000 and to disarm and demobilise all ZANLA and ZIPRA personnel who had not yet been integrated, thereby breaking the promise of a place in the army for every guerrilla.{{sfn|Kriger|2003|pp=68–70}} After ZIPRA commander [[Dumiso Dabengwa]] refused to give the disarming order at Entumbane, Nkomo oversaw a parade of the camp and gave the command to disarm himself, doing so "for the sake of peace", in Kriger's words, despite his own opposition to the idea.{{sfn|Kriger|2003|p=78}} Mugabe publicly announced his deal with North Korea in August 1981, and 106 North Korean instructors arrived the same month. Nkomo accused the Prime Minister of creating "a special partisan army divorced from the national army" for the "possible imposition of a one-party state".{{sfn|Meredith|2007|p=62}} In February 1982, Mugabe announced that huge arms caches had been discovered on ZAPU-owned properties and that this was evidence of a planned ZAPU coup. He likened Nkomo's presence in the government to "a cobra in the house" and promptly fired him, concurrently arresting ZIPRA leaders and seizing ZAPU property.{{sfn|Meredith|2007|pp=63–64}}

The new North Korean-trained unit, dubbed [[Zimbabwean Fifth Brigade|5&amp;nbsp;Brigade]], passed out in December 1982, and was deployed by Mugabe to Matabeleland, where it remained for the next five years. In what became known as ''[[Gukurahundi]]'', it perpetrated a number of brutal massacres and atrocities against civilians in Matabeleland accused of supporting "dissidents", far exceeding anything that had occurred during the Bush War.{{sfn|Meredith|2007|pp=67–73}}{{sfn|Hill|2005|p=77}} Estimates for the number of deaths range from 10,000 to 30,000.{{sfn|Hill|2005|p=77}} The campaign officially ended in December 1987 when Mugabe and Nkomo signed a unity accord merging ZAPU into ZANU–PF with the stated goal of a one-party state.{{sfn|Meredith|2007|p=73}}

The '''1988 Brussels summit''' was the 8th [[NATO summit]] bringing the leaders of member nations together at the same time.  The formal sessions and informal meetings in [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]] took place on 2–3 March 1988.&lt;ref name="nato1"&gt;{{cite web|title=NATO summit meetings |author=NATO |url=http://www.nato.int/issues/summits/index.html#agendas |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5gWo4KcXm?url=http://www.nato.int/issues/summits/index.html |archivedate=4 May 2009 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=18 March 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In this period, the organization faced unresolved questions concerned whether a new generation of leaders would be as committed to NATO as their predecessors had been.&lt;ref name="thomas101"&gt;Thomas, Ian Q.R. (1997). [https://books.google.com/books?id=mwYQSw00m8EC&amp;pg=PA223&amp;dq=NATO+and+Brussels+summit+1974&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a#PPA101,M1  ''The promise of alliance: NATO and the political imagination,'' p. 101.]&lt;/ref&gt; Generational change in the leadership of the Soviet Union brought [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] to the international stage;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, [https://books.google.com/books?id=mwYQSw00m8EC&amp;pg=PA223&amp;dq=NATO+and+Brussels+summit+1974&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a#PPA130,M1  p. 130.]&lt;/ref&gt; but NATO leaders were increasingly uneasy about how to respond to his personable qualities. British Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] counseled that it was probably a good idea to "do business" with him, but other NATO leaders were uncertain about what Gorbachev's openness might be hiding.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, [https://books.google.com/books?id=mwYQSw00m8EC&amp;pg=PA223&amp;dq=NATO+and+Brussels+summit+1974&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a#PPA143,M1  p. 143.]&lt;/ref&gt; These fears were minimized by the Soviet announcement that troops were going to be withdrawn from Afghanistan.  The unilateral withdraw of 500,000 troops and 10,000 tanks from Eastern Europe sent an unmistakable message of change.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, [https://books.google.com/books?id=mwYQSw00m8EC&amp;pg=PA223&amp;dq=NATO+and+Brussels+summit+1974&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a#PPA142,M1 p. 142.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Agenda==
The general discussions focused on the need for a reaffirmation of the purpose and principles of the Alliance.  Other informal meetings explored what NATO's posture should be in its objectives for East-West relations.&lt;ref name="nato1"/&gt;

==Accomplishments==
The summit's work was directed towards adoption of a blueprint for strengthening stability in the whole of Europe through conventional arms control negotiations.&lt;ref name="nato1"/&gt;

On 8 March 2016, a '''five-story building collapsed''' while under construction in [[Ibeju-Lekki|Lekki District]], [[Lagos|Lagos, Nigeria]].

== Investigation ==
Ibrahim Farinloye, from the National [[Emergency Management]] Agency of Nigeria, said in a statement that "Investigation on the cause of the collapse has started by various federal and state agencies". The [[Lagos State Government|Lagos state government]] said in a statement that preliminary reports suggest the [[building construction]] was illegal, with the builders having been served a [[contravention]] notice for exceeding the number of allowed floors.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The owners of the building apparently “[[crime|criminally]] unsealed the property and continued building beyond the approved floors.”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Heavy rain had occurred in the area as well, with some pointing to that as an exacerbating factor.

Victor Suru, a [[bricklayer]] working on the building, stated that "After they (the owners) finished building the house, rain fell and the house shifted a bit. They put iron in front of the house, (but) the iron couldn't hold the house. They left it like that and continued building."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://europe.newsweek.com/lagos-building-collapse-nigeria-435526?rm=eu|title=A building collapsed in Lagos, killing at least 30 people|website=Newsweek|accessdate=2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''2019 Davis Cup''' will be the 108th edition of the [[Davis Cup]], a tournament between national teams in men's tennis. It is sponsored by [[BNP Paribas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.daviscup.com/en/news/225951.aspx|title=Davis Cup - ITF confirms 2017 Davis Cup dates|work=DavisCup.com|date=2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For this edition, the format of the cup will be changed.&lt;ref name=format&gt;{{cite web |title=Historic Davis Cup reforms approved at AGM |url=https://www.daviscup.com/en/news/290055.aspx |website=Daviscup.com |accessdate=16 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main modification is the World Group taking place at one location and in one week, with eighteen teams divided in six round-robin groups of three teams each, with the winners of the groups and the two best second places advancing to quarterfinals. The series between the teams in this stage will feature two singles matches and one doubles match, instead of the best-of-5 series, with the matches changing from best of 5 sets to best of 3. As the World Group will now take place as one single tournament, this event has been named as the Davis Cup Finals. The lower zone groups I and II will be composed of single ties deciding promotion or relegation.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

__NOTOC__
Year '''462 BC''' was a year of the [[Roman calendar|pre-Julian Roman calendar]]. At the time, it was known as the '''Year of the Consulship of Tricipitinus and Cicurinus''' (or, less frequently, '''year 292 ''[[Ab urbe condita]]'''''). The denomination 462 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the [[Anno Domini]] [[calendar era]] became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;
=== By place ===
==== Greece ====
* The [[Sparta]]ns try to conquer the mountain stronghold of Mt [[Ithome]] in [[Messenia]], where a large force of rebellious [[helots]] have taken refuge. They ask their allies from the [[Greco-Persian Wars|Persian Wars]], including the [[Athenians]], to help.
* [[Kimon]] seeks the support of [[Athens]]' citizens to providing help to [[Sparta]]. Although [[Ephialtes of Athens|Ephialtes]] maintains that Sparta is Athens' rival for power and should be left to fend for itself, Kimon's view prevails. Kimon then leads 4,000 [[hoplites]] to Mount Ithome.
* After an attempt to storm Mt. Ithome fails, the Spartans start to distrust the Athenians over concerns that they may take the side of the helots. Retaining their other allies, the Spartans sent Kimon and his men home. This insulting rebuff causes the collapse of Kimon's popularity at Athens. Outrage over the dismissal swings Athenian opinion towards [[Ephialtes]]' views.
* [[Ephialtes]] passes a law in the Athenian [[Ecclesia (ancient Athens)|ecclesia]], which reforms the [[Areopagus]], limiting its power to judging cases of [[homicide]] and religious crimes. He considers the Areopagus to be the centre of conservatism and Ephialtes' victory is seen as a defeat for the conservatives and the members of the [[oligarchy]].
* [[Argos]], taking advantage of Spartan preoccupation with the revolt of its helots, finally conquers [[Mycenae]]. The inhabitants of the town are dispersed, with some finding their way into [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]].
* [[Pericles]] starts to effectively be the leader of [[Athens]].

=== By topic ===
==== Philosophy ====
* The Greek philosopher, [[Anaxagoras]], moves to [[Athens]] and begins teaching there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Suzuki |first1=Jeff |title=Mathematics in Historical Context |date=2009 |publisher=MAA |isbn=9780883855706 |page=24 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=lew5IC5piCwC&amp;pg=PA24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2016 the AlcoSense Pro and AlcoSense Ultra were awarded the prestigious [[Red Dot]] Design award, an international distinction for excellent product design. In the Same year the AlcoSense Excel was awarded Auto Express Best Buy Award and the AlcoSense Pro was awarded Auto Express Recommended Awards.

The AlcoSense Excel won the 2018 [[German Design Award]]s for excellent product design in the Medical, Rehabilitation and Health Care category.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.german-design-award.com/die-gewinner/galerie/detail/14452-alcosense-excel.html|title=AlcoSense Excel - Winner - Medical, Rehabilitation and Health Care - German Design Award|website=www.german-design-award.com|language=de|access-date=2017-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Products ==

AlcoSense consumer products include a range of reusable battery operated breathalysers and a single-use disposable breathalyser, launched in 2012.

In July 2012 it became a legal requirement in France to carry a breathalyser in all vehicles. AlcoSense launched a disposable breathalyser specifically for use in France: the AlcoSense Singles NF, certified to meet all French specifications.&lt;ref name="Halfords website"&gt;{{cite web |title= Halfords website AlcoSense products page |url= http://www.halfords.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/SearchCmd?srch=alcosense&amp;action=search&amp;storeId=10001&amp;catalogId=10151&amp;langId=-1 |publisher= www.halfords.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 AlcoSense launched the AlcoSense Pro and in 2016 the AlcoSense Ultra and Excel. Both use fuel cell sensors. The AlcoSense Ultra uses the same fuel-cell sensor as several police breathalysers, the Pro and Excel use a smaller version of the same sensor. They contain a number of unique new features that advise the user if they are blowing correctly, provided an estimated time until sober, and they can work with any drink-drive limit anywhere in the world. By selecting a country from a pre-loaded list, the unit will automatically set itself up to the local drink-drive limit.

The '''''Arena di Verona Festival''''' ('''Verona Arena Festival''') is a summer festival of [[opera]], located in the city of [[Verona]] Italy. Since 1936, it has been organized under the auspices of an official body, first the ''Ente Autonomo Spettacoli Lirici Arena di Verona'', (the autonomous organization for lyrical productions of the Arena di Verona), and then, following legislation in 1996 and 1998, the Ente Lirico Arena di Verona was transformed into a private foundation, the present-day ''Arena di Verona Foundation''

Opera performances are given in [[Arena di Verona]], an ancient [[Roman amphitheatre]], which was capable of holding 30,000 spectators. Performances traditionally begin at dusk and spectators on the stone seats of the arena bring small candles (the "mocoleto")  which are lit as darkness falls and the performances begin.
[[File:AIDA at the Arena di Versona 2011.jpg|thumb|right|250px|2011 production of AIDA; the Act 2 Triumphal March]]
;First opera productions
The first operas were performed in 1913 in celebration of the centenary of the birth of [[Giuseppe Verdi]] and were produced by the tenor [[Giovanni Zenatello]] and the theatre impresario Ottone Rovato.  Their staging of ''[[Aida]]'' in the biggest open-air lyrical theatre in the world began a long tradition.  In the following year Zenatello and others returned and, in the years before 1936, a variety of organizations took over the presentations.  These included the ''Lyrica Italica Ars'' from 1919 to 1920, the ''Casa Musicale Sonzogno'' of Milan from 1921 to 1922, and the impresario Gino Bertolaso from 1923 to 1926, while, in 1934 another organization, the ''Ente Comunale degli Spettacoli'' (the municipal performance association) took over the summer festival.  Finally, in 1936, a permanent organization was created.
;Significant artistic achievements
[[File:Arena di Verona-AIDA-trumpeters in Act 2.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Trumpeters in Act 2 of AIDA, 2011]]
Many singers made their names and careers by performing at Verona.  In 1929 [[Beniamino Gigli]] thrilled audiences with his appearances in [[Flotow]]'s ''[[Martha (opera)|Martha]]''. Between 1947 and 1954 [[Maria Callas]] was a regular after creating a sensation in [[Amilcare Ponchielli|Ponchielli]]'s ''[[La Gioconda (opera)|La Gioconda]]''.

In addition to singers, directors and designers added distinguishing elements to productions such as the 1953 water pool created for ''Aida'' by silent cinema director [[Georg Wilhelm Pabst]]. His aim was to conjure up the image of the Nile on which little Egyptian boats could sail, and the idea was adapted by [[Pier Luigi Pizzi]] again in ''Aida'' in 1999. Also, it was Pabst who was responsible for the introduction of a great number of animals on stage, including elephants, horses and dromedaries, and this form of spectacle has become a prominent feature of many opera productions in Verona.

Dance and classic concert performances have also been given in the Arena.  Classical ballets and traditional dances from all over the world have been seen. In 1976, [[Maurice Béjart]] brought the "[[Ballet du XXe Siècle]]" from the [[La Monnaie]] opera house in [[Brussels]] and choreographed [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Beethoven's 9th symphony]]. This première was interrupted by rain, but the performance continued to a cassette tape of the music and without the orchestra.

==Teatro Filarmonico==
[[File:Arena di Verona - Scenery for NABUCCO being loaded into the Arena, 2011.jpg|thumb|left|100px|Scenery for NABUCCO being loaded into the Arena, 2011]]
Since 1976 the organization has expanded its artistic activities from October to May in the rebuilt ''[[Teatro Filarmonico]]'', a theatre which had been destroyed in World War II. With this new addition, the organization could accumulate a permanent collection of artists (the orchestra, the choir and the corps de ballet) and technicians who represent the productions that are staged in Verona and transported nationally and internationally.

The '''Boston Early Music Festival''' ('''BEMF''') is a non-profit organization founded in 1980 in [[Boston]], Massachusetts, U.S. to promote [[Historically informed performance|historical music performance]].  It presents an annual concert series in Boston and [[New York City]], produces opera recordings, and organizes a weeklong Festival and Exhibition every two years in Boston. A centerpiece of these festivals has been a fully staged Baroque opera production.
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Boston Early Music Festival's Psyché.jpg|thumb|250px|Young Cupid ([[Frederick Metzger]]) visits Psyché ([[Carolyn Sampson]]) in Boston Early Music Festival's 2007 production of the French Baroque opera [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]]'s ''[[Psyché (opera)|Psyché]]''.{{Pufc|1=Boston Early Music Festival's Psyché.jpg|date=7 December 2014}}]] --&gt;
One of BEMF’s main goals is to unearth lesser-known Baroque operas, which are then performed by the world’s leading musicians armed with the latest information on period singing, orchestral performance, costuming, dance, and staging at each biennial Festival. BEMF operas are led by the BEMF Artistic Directors Paul O’Dette and Stephen Stubbs, BEMF Orchestra Director Robert Mealy, and BEMF Opera Director Gilbert Blin. In 2008, BEMF introduced its Chamber Opera Series as part of its annual concert season. The series presents semi-staged productions of chamber operas composed during the Baroque period. In 2011, BEMF took its chamber production of Handel’s ''[[Acis and Galatea (Handel)|Acis and Galatea]]'' on a four-city North-American tour. In 2004, BEMF initiated a project to record some of its work in the field of Baroque opera on the CPO recording label. The series has since earned five Grammy Award nominations, including a 2015 Grammy Award for Best Opera Recording.

At each Festival, concerts are presented every day from morning until late at night. Concerts are given by an array of established luminaries and rising stars in the field of early music worldwide. BEMF concerts also allow for unique, once-in-a-lifetime collaborations and programs by the spectacular array of talent assembled for the Festival week's events. In addition, there are many scheduled ''Fringe'' concerts and events, presented both by local and out-of-town groups at a number of venues in Boston and Cambridge. The Exhibition at the Festival is the largest event of its kind in the United States, showcasing over one hundred early instrument makers, music publishers, service organizations, schools and universities, and associated colleagues.

In 1989, BEMF established an annual concert series to meet the increasing demand for year-round performances of early music. BEMF then expanded its concert series in 2006, when it began presenting performances to New York City at [[The Morgan Library &amp; Museum]]. BEMF's annual season now sets the bar nationally for early music performance and has featured such musicians as [[The Tallis Scholars]], [[Jordi Savall]] and [[Hespèrion XXI]], and [[Les Arts Florissants (ensemble)|Les Arts Florissants]], as well as the North American débuts of [[Stile Antico (early music vocal ensemble)|Stile Antico]], [[Bach Collegium Japan]], [[Netherlands Bach Society]], and [[Akademie für Alte Musik Berlin]].

[[Burning Man]] has spawned non profit organizations world wide and '''Burnt Oranges''' is the first to host events in Florida.  There are two events each year, held at Maddox Ranch in [[Lakeland, Florida]]. The spring event is called 'Preheat' and the fall event "Afterburn'.

The 10 principles of Burning Man are explicitly followed and the event are always sold out.  As with BM all income is used to support art and charity.  Each event is limited to 990 people.  Theme camps and mutant vehicles are intended to give participants the flavor of the much larger and original Burning Man event in the [[Black Rock Desert]], [[Nevada]].

'''Carol Lin''' is an American journalist, best known as the first television news anchor to break the news to a worldwide audience of the [[September 11 attacks|terrorist attacks on the United States on September 11, 2001]], reporting for [[CNN]].  Lin previously worked for [[ABC News]], contributes reports to [[NPR]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=90791298 |title=Turning Point: Cracking My Family's Mysteries |website=Npr.org |date=2008-05-27 |accessdate=2016-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;, is the founder of CarolLinReporting.com, and currently does strategic communication for the [[Los Angeles County Chief Executive Office]].

==Career==
===ABC News===
Before joining CNN, Lin was with ABC News where she served as a national correspondent and substitute anchor for ''Good Morning America'' and also reported for ''World News Tonight with Peter Jennings''.

While with ABC News, Lin provided national reports on The Freeman Standoff in Montana, The UniBomber arrest, the North Dakota Floods, and the Jon Benet murder case, among other stories. Before joining ABC News, Lin served as a weekend news anchor for [[KTTV]] in [[Los Angeles]] where she worked in the Special Undercover Investigations Unit.  She started her reporting career at the Washington, D.C., bureau of CONUS Communications where she covered the Reagan presidency.

===CNN===
From 1998 &amp;ndash; December 30, 2006, Lin served as a news anchor and correspondent for CNN and was based in the network's worldwide headquarters in [[Atlanta, Georgia]]. During her tenure at CNN, Lin anchored several news programs, including ''CNN Early Edition'', ''CNN Live at Daybreak'', the weekend editions of ''CNN Newsroom'', and the former news-magazine program ''CNN NewsStand''. She traveled the globe to report on numerous breaking news stories for CNN, including the rebuilding of [[Kosovo]], the [[Columbine High School massacre|shootings at Columbine High School]], the fall of the [[Taliban]] in [[Afghanistan]] in 2001, and live from [[New York City]]'s [[Times Square]] as part of CNN's worldwide Millennium night coverage.

Additionally, Lin traveled to Jerusalem during the siege of Bethlehem to cover tensions between Israel and the Palestinian territories,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0205/09/ltm.07.html |title=CNN.com - Transcripts |website=Edition.cnn.com |date=2002-05-09 |accessdate=2016-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to Salt Lake City in 2002 to cover the Winter Olympics.  Later that year she anchored the news coverage of the rescue of nine miners in Somerset, PA who were trapped for 77 hours.

Earlier, Lin played an integral role in CNN's Election 2000 coverage, anchoring live from the New Hampshire Primary,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0001/29/smn.11.html |title=CNN Transcript - Saturday Morning News: Poll Shows New Hampshire Primary Draws Little National Attention - January 29, 2000 |website=Transcripts.cnn.com |date=2000-01-29 |accessdate=2016-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and from the Democratic Convention from the Staples Center in Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0008/13/sm.11.html |title=CNN Transcript - Sunday Morning News: Democratic National Convention: 'Time For Kids' Reporter Talks About Politics From Younger Perspective - August 13, 2000 |website=Transcripts.cnn.com |date=2000-08-13 |accessdate=2016-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lin also interviewed many of the key players during the Florida vote recount, including Florida Gov. Jeb Bush.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0105/09/lad.06.html |title=CNN.com - Transcripts |website=Transcripts.cnn.com |date=2001-05-09 |accessdate=2016-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====September 11 attacks====
However, of all the news stories Lin reported on and anchored, she is best remembered as the first television anchor to break the news of the [[September 11 attacks|terrorist attacks on the United States on September 11, 2001]] to a worldwide audience.  It was three minutes after those attacks began in New York that CNN interrupted a [[Ditech]] TV commercial at 8:49&amp;nbsp;a.m. EST with a live picture of the [[World Trade Center (1973-2001)|World Trade Center]]'s north tower on fire and Lin reporting from [[CNN Center]] in Atlanta:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Yeah. This just in. You are looking at obviously a very disturbing live shot there. That is the [[World Trade Center (1973-2001)|World Trade Center]], and we have unconfirmed reports this morning that a plane has crashed into one of the towers of the World Trade Center. [[CNN Center]] right now is just beginning to work on this story, obviously calling our sources and trying to figure out exactly what happened, but clearly something relatively devastating happening this morning there on the south end of the island of Manhattan. That is once again, a picture of one of the towers of the World Trade Center.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Less than two months after Lin reported the news of the September 11 attacks, she was once again traveling the globe to bring world news to CNN viewers, this time from Pakistan, reporting on numerous topics, including [[Afghan refugees]] in that country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0111/03/smn.10.html |title=CNN.com - Transcripts |website=Edition.cnn.com |date=2001-11-03 |accessdate=2016-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===CarolLinReporting.com===
Lin is the founder of CarolLinReporting.com, a website which provides cancer patients, their families, and caregivers with answers they may not find on traditional networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blogher.com/ten-money-questions-carol-lin |date=October 5, 2007 |last=Smith |first=Nina |title=Ten Money Questions for Carol Lin |work=BlogHer |publisher=RD2, Inc. |accessdate=December 18, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071218193729/http://www.blogher.com/ten-money-questions-carol-lin |archivedate=December 18, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The site launched on October 1, 2007, and is part of a yet to be announced larger project that will allow Lin to combine journalism with an operating system to enable cancer patients and their families to find immediate solutions to the most pressing problems in their daily lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/generalities/carol_lin_has_discovered_whats_possible_68054.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-10-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006231451/http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/generalities/carol_lin_has_discovered_whats_possible_68054.asp |archivedate=2008-10-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  U.S. News &amp; World Report reported that Lin, "has moved quickly to combine politics and news to create a model to provide cancer answers while also pushing for greater spending for cures.&lt;ref name="usnews2007"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071028055339/http://www.usnews.com/blogs/washington-whispers/2007/10/19/ex-cnners-team-to-help-fight-cancer.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public service===

In 2012, Lin joined the [[Los Angeles County Probation Department]] as a spokesperson. In 2015, she moved to the [[Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department]] to direct their strategic communications unit.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/carollinreports/status/560227692268625920&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, due to a change in administration, she took a position with the Los Angeles County chief executive office.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-sheriff-20181128-story.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and honors==
Lin's solid journalism had been praised by numerous media critics, including CBS Marketwatch's Jon Friedman, who cited how she handled the news of the death of her former ABC News colleague Peter Jennings.  Friedman first noted "CNN distinguished itself by sticking to the story and giving a balanced picture of Jennings' career -- thanks in large part to Lin's composure," and went on to write that Lin "was steady, thoughtful and, most of all, reliable -- the essential quality for any journalist working under pressure."&lt;ref name="usnews2007"/&gt;

Lin has been honored with numerous awards for her work, including three Los Angeles Press Club Awards.  Lin was also the first recipient of the National IMAGE Award by the Organization of Chinese Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://alumni.ucla.edu/stories/carol-lin-84/ |title=Carol Lin ’84 - UCLA Alumni |website=Alumni.ucla.edu |date=2015-05-22 |accessdate=2016-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Lin was born to parents Hsi Chuan Chen and Po Chen Lin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=90791298 |title=Turning Point: Cracking My Family's Mysteries |website=Npr.org |date=2008-05-27 |accessdate=2016-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lin earned a bachelor's degree in [[political science]] from [[University of California at Los Angeles|UCLA]]. Lin was a roommate with actress [[Heather Locklear]] at UCLA, mentioned by Locklear while a guest on ''[[Larry King Live]]'' in 1999.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Lin's husband, William "Will" Robinson,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSQXhvSl_e0&lt;/ref&gt; an eight-time Emmy Award winning news producer,&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lin |first=Carol |url=http://www.workingmother.com/2006/9/home/carol-lin |title=Carol Lin |publisher=Working Mother |date=2006-09-13 |accessdate=2016-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; died of cancer in 2003. Lin and Robinson had one child. In February 2009, Lin married Mike Dowling, then UCLA Assistant Athletic Director of Operations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adweek.com/tvnewser/carol-lin-on-her-new-life-its-a-miracle/24044} ]{{dead link|date=November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/miss-darling/albums/72157614175651026|title=Carol and Mike's Wedding|website=Flickr|access-date=2016-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Celtic Colours International Festival''' is a Celtic music festival held annually in October in communities all over [[Cape Breton Island]] in [[Nova Scotia]], [[Canada]]. First held in 1997, the festival has featured hundreds of musicians from all over the [[Celts|Celtic]] world and attracted tens of thousands of visitors to Cape Breton Island. For nine days in October, Cape Breton Island is home to a unique celebration of music and culture as the Celtic Colours International Festival presents dozens of concerts all over the island, an extensive line-up of workshops, a [[Visual arts|visual art]] series of exhibitions, and a nightly Festival Club. Over the years, artists have traveled from [[Scotland]], [[Ireland]], [[Wales]], [[England]], [[Brittany]], [[Spain]], [[Denmark]], [[Germany]], [[Norway]], [[Cuba]] and [[Sweden]] as well as from across the [[United States]] and [[Canada]].{{cn|date=June 2018}}

==Locations==
In many of these communities, the local [[fire station|fire hall]], [[parish hall]] or [[community centre]] has hosted musical events for generations, in some cases, literally moving the fire trucks out of the hall to accommodate a dance. Venues for Celtic Colours vary from an 18th-century reconstructed French Chapel to new performance facilities to community halls.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

==Features and events==
Celtic Colours International Festival has an ambitious schedule (as many as six concerts each day).

Celtic music has seen a resurgence of interest in [[North America]] during recent years. Fueled in part by the success and popularity of entertainers like [[Natalie MacMaster]], [[Buddy MacMaster]], the [[Barra MacNeils]], [[Ashley MacIsaac]], the [[Rankin Family]] and [[Rita MacNeil]], this interest has focused attention on Cape Breton Island, its music, its people and its culture. Workshops, offered in many aspects of Celtic and [[Gaelic culture]], allow visitors and residents alike to get the hands-on experience they desire. Host communities around the island present workshops in [[Gaelic language]] and song, components of tradition, instrument instruction and traditional dance, as well as offering cultural tours, ceilidhs and a lecture series. They also organize an extensive array of community events including meals and dances.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

==Festival club==
One of the most popular features of the Celtic Colours International Festival every year is the Festival Club. Located at the Gaelic College in St. Ann's, the Festival Club opens as the evening concerts are closing, offering an opportunity for Festival artists to perform in a more informal setting, or to get a session in with friends and colleagues from near and far. Performance is by invitation only and depends upon artist availability on any given night.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

In [[psychology]]-related [[slang]], the term '''control freak''' describes an individual who attempts to undermine other people based on how one dictates how everything is done around them. The phrase was first used in the 1970s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/control-freak?s=t|title=the definition of control freak|author=|date=|website=Dictionary.com|accessdate=3 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107020713/http://www.dictionary.com/browse/control-freak?s=t|archivedate=7 November 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; an era when stress was laid on the principle of 'doing one's own thing' and letting others do the same.&lt;ref&gt;Kristin Glaser, in ''The Radical Therapist'' (Penguin 1974) p. 246&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personality psychology ==
{{See also|Abusive power and control}}
In the study of [[personality psychology]], certain [[personality disorders]] display characteristics involving the need to gain [[Compliance (psychology)|compliance]] or control over others:&lt;ref&gt;Larsen, Randy J., and [[David M. Buss]]. Personality Psychology: Domains of Knowledge about Human Nature. New York: McGraw-Hill Higher Education, 2010. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Those with [[antisocial personality disorder]] tend to display a glibness and [[grandiose]] sense of [[self-worth]]. Due to their [[shallow affect]] and lack of [[remorse]] or [[empathy]], they are well suited to con and/or [[Psychological manipulation|manipulate]] others into complying with their wishes. 
* Those with [[histrionic personality disorder]] need to be the [[attention seeking|center of attention]], and in turn, draw people in so they may use (and eventually dispose of) their relationship.  
* Those with [[narcissistic personality disorder]] have an inflated self-importance, hypersensitivity to [[criticism]] and a sense of [[entitlement]] that compels them to [[persuade]] others to comply with their requests.  To maintain their [[self-esteem]], and protect their [[true self|vulnerable selves]], [[narcissists]] need to control others' behavior – particularly that of [[Narcissistic parent|their children]] seen as extensions of themselves.&lt;ref name=co&gt;Rappoport, Alan, Ph. D.[http://www.alanrappoport.com/pdf/Co-Narcissism%20Article.pdf Co-Narcissism: How We Adapt to Narcissism. The Therapist, 2005] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150811150356/http://alanrappoport.com/pdf/Co-Narcissism%20Article.pdf |date=2015-08-11 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vulnerability===
{{See also|True self and false self}}
Control freaks are often [[Perfectionism (psychology)|perfectionists]]&lt;ref&gt;Michelle N. Lafrance, ''Women and Depression'' (2009) p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; defending themselves against their own inner [[vulnerabilities]] in the belief that if they are not in total control they risk exposing themselves once more to childhood [[angst]].&lt;ref&gt;Art Horn, ''Face It'' (2004) p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; Such persons [[Psychological manipulation|manipulate]] and [[Coercion|pressure]] others to change so as to avoid having to change themselves,&lt;ref&gt;Robin Skynner/John Cleese, ''Families and how to survive them'' (London 1994) p. 208&lt;/ref&gt; and use power over others to escape an inner emptiness.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Bly and Marion Woodman, ''The Maiden King'' (Dorset 1999) p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; When a control freak's pattern is broken, the controller is left with a terrible feeling of powerlessness but feeling their pain and fear brings them back to themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Evans, ''Controlling People'' (Avon 2002) p. 129 and p. 274&lt;/ref&gt;

Control freaks appear to have some similarities to [[codependents]], in the sense that the latters' fear of abandonment leads to attempts to control those they are dependent on.&lt;ref&gt;David Stafford &amp; [[Liz Hodgkinson]], ''Codependency'' (London 1995) p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; Recovery for them entails recognizing that being a control freak helped paradoxically preserve codependency itself.&lt;ref&gt;Deb M., in ''Stepping Stones to Recovery from Codependency'' (1993) p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of personality-type theory, control freaks are very much the [[Type A and Type B personality theory|Type A]] personality, driven by the need to dominate and control.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Holmes/Dan Wilson, ''Pains in the Office'' (2004) p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; An obsessive need to control others is also associated with [[antisocial personality disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Martha Stout]], ''The Sociopath Next Door'' (2005) p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;

==In management==
In the corporate world, control freaks tend to publicly admonish their inferiors, especially during meetings.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Buck&amp;nbsp;— [http://www.pmhut.com/meeting-behaviors-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly Meeting Behaviors: The Good, The Bad and The Ugly] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100610065229/http://www.pmhut.com/meeting-behaviors-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly |date=2010-06-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More positively, the term can also refer to someone with a limited number of things that they want done a specific way; professor of clinical psychology [[Les Parrott]] wrote that “Control Freaks are people who care more than you do about something and won't stop at being pushy to get their way”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Parrot | first = Les | title = The Control Freak | publisher = Tyndale House Publishers | location = Carol Stream | year = 2001 | isbn = 0-8423-3793-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There may be a fine line between being a detail-oriented manager, who likes to have things done 'right', and being a (destructive) control freak.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gillian Tett]], ''Fool's Gold'' (London 2009) p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; Control freaks are usually a cause of [[micromanagement]].

In some cases, the control freak sees their constant intervention as beneficial or even necessary. This can be caused by feelings of separation or departure from a loved one; or by the belief that others are incapable of handling matters properly, or the fear that things will go wrong if they do not attend to every detail. In other cases, they may simply enjoy the feeling of power it gives them so much that they automatically try to gain control of everything and everyone around them.

==In history==

===Wellington v. Napoleon===
[[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Wellington]] as military commander was undoubtedly a hands-on micromanager, trusting his subordinates as little as possible, and showing many of the characteristics of the modern day control freak.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Holmes, ''Wellington: The Iron Duke'' (London 2003) p. 178 and p. 169&lt;/ref&gt; In 1811 he wrote that “I am obliged to be everywhere and if absent from any operation, something goes wrong&amp;nbsp;… success can only be attained by attention to the most minute details”.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Michael Glover, ''Wellington as Military Commander'' (London 1968) p. 205&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, [[Napoleon I|Napoleon]] gave his marshals much more tactical freedom.&lt;ref&gt;Jac Weller, ''Wellington at Waterloo'' (London 1967) p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; At the critical meeting of the two generals at the [[Battle of Waterloo]] — where Wellington's close supervision contrasted strongly with the effective delegation of operational management by Napoleon to [[Marshall Ney]]&lt;ref&gt;James Marshall-Cornwall, ''Napoleon as Military Commander'' (London 1967) p. 278&lt;/ref&gt; — it was at least arguably Wellington's control mania that played the decisive role in the Allied victory, justifying his claim the following day that “I don't think it would have been done if I had not been there”.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Glover, p. 204&lt;/ref&gt;

===Queen Victoria===
A series of three documentary programs on [[BBC2]] in the UK in January 2013 called ''Queen Victoria's Children'' argued that [[Queen Victoria]] was a pathological control freak by the way she controlled the welfare of all her children.&lt;ref&gt;Queen Victoria's Children BBC2 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===Steve Jobs and closed systems===
[[Steve Jobs#Management style|Steve Jobs]] was a perfectionist who favored the closed system of control over all aspects of a product from start to finish — what he termed the integrated over the fragmented approach.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Isaacson, ''Steve Jobs'' (2011) p. 564 and p. 513&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Steve Wozniak]], his long-term collaborator and occasional critic, put it: "Apple gets you into their playpen and keeps you there.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Isaacson, p. 497&lt;/ref&gt; The triumph of the Windows PC over the Mac was a blow for that philosophy, a situation that was then reversed by the successes of the iPod, iPhone, and iPad &amp;ndash; only for the Android challenge to reopen the debate."&lt;ref&gt;Isaacson, p. 513 and p. 497&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The competition was proposed by the [[Denver_Mad_Scientists_Club|Denver Mad Scientists]] club and organized by member Bill Llewellin.&lt;ref name='wired'/&gt;
In the months before the 1987 convention the club produced a set of rules which were distributed without copyright restriction, allowing other organizations use or extend them for their own competitions.

The first competition was held on a hotel table.  The original rules prohibited damaging the surface.  There were several competitors including a remote control dune buggy, a mechanical device under a steel mixing bowl, and a little yellow remote control corvette that could only go forward or backwards and turn.  The first competition was won by the corvette.

The last revision to the official rules was on 15 Feb 2003.  By then the rules had evolved to include mention of radio controls, attacking control systems, limiting the number of operators to one, and codifying two part critters loss conditions&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060209150502/http://www.milehicon.org/critrule.htm] MileHiCon 38 Website, Internet Archive (accessed 19 February 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
;Destruction in Fukushima
Bryan Rose of the ''[[Wrestling Observer Newsletter]]'' wrote that Destruction in Fukushima was "one of the weaker cards New Japan has put out this year, topped by a main event that was one of the worst New Japan main events in I don't know how long".&lt;ref name=DestructioninFukushimaWON/&gt; Larry Csonka of ''411Mania'' had similar sentiments, calling the show "extremely disappointing" and "possibly the laziest, most lifeless show the promotion has put on all year". He rated the main event a "dud", calling it "an embarrassment".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://411mania.com/wrestling/csonkas-njpw-destruction-fukushima-review-9-10-17/ | title = Csonka's NJPW Destruction in Fukushima Review 9.10.17 | last=Csonka | first=Larry | date=September 10, 2017 | accessdate=September 10, 2017 | work=411Mania}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dave Meltzer]], also of the ''Wrestling Observer Newsletter'', wrote that fan response to the show had been "very negative, by far the worst of any major show for the company this year".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.f4wonline.com/daily-updates/daily-update-ufc-215-fallout-njpw-fukushima-progress-242526 | title = Daily Update: UFC 215 fallout, NJPW in Fukushima, Progress | last=Meltzer | first=Dave | authorlink=Dave Meltzer | date=September 10, 2017 | accessdate=September 10, 2017 | work=[[Wrestling Observer Newsletter]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Destruction in Hiroshima
The show was better received than its predecessor. Larry Csonka of ''411Mania'' wrote that Destruction in Hiroshima "wasn't a great show, but it was closer to the company getting back to form" after the Fukushima show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://411mania.com/wrestling/csonkas-njpw-destruction-hiroshima-review-9-16-17/ | title = Csonka's NJPW Destruction in Hiroshima Review 9.16.17 | last=Csonka | first=Larry | date=September 16, 2017 | accessdate=September 16, 2017 | work=411Mania}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bryan Rose of the ''Wrestling Observer Newsletter'' wrote that the Hiroshima show exceeded the Fukushima show "pretty much in every way".&lt;ref name=DestructioninHiroshimaWON/&gt;

;Destruction in Kobe
Bryan Rose of the ''Wrestling Observer Newsletter'' called the show "just there", deeming everything but the two title matches and the match between Beretta and [[Yujiro Takahashi]] "skippable". Rose praised the main event of the show as "fantastic".&lt;ref name=DestructioninKobeWON/&gt; Larry Csonka of ''411Mania'' rated the show "good". While being down on the first three matches, he praised the main event as a "must see".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://411mania.com/wrestling/csonkas-njpw-destruction-kobe-review-9-24-17/ | title = Csonka's NJPW Destruction in Kobe Review 9.24.17 | last=Csonka | first=Larry | date=September 24, 2017 | accessdate=September 24, 2017 | work=411Mania}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''First Into Nagasaki: The Censored Eyewitness Dispatches on Post-Atomic Japan and Its Prisoners of War''''' is a collection of reports by ''[[Chicago Daily News]]'' foreign correspondent [[George Weller]]. Originally written in 1945, but not approved for publication by Gen. [[Douglas MacArthur]]'s military censors. The reports were collected and edited by the author's son Anthony Weller, and published for the first time in 2006.

== Synopsis ==

The Occupation authorities declared [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]] (and [[Hiroshima]]) off-limits to reporters.

Weller reports that he was the first outside observer to reach Nagasaki, on September 6, 1945, four weeks following the U.S. [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombing of the city]].  He spent a total of three weeks in Nagasaki and in the nearby Allied [[P.O.W.]] camps — some of which he "opened", and revisits the series of news reports he published at the time about his experiences.

The first dispatches by non-Japanese reporters were filed by [[Associated Press]] correspondent [[Vern Haugland]] and ''[[New York Times]]'' Lawrence who visited Nagasaki September 9, 1945. Captain Joe Snyder, press officer with MacArthur headquarters, in his book ''Para(graph) Trooper For MacArthur: From the Horse Cavalry to the USS Missouri'' 1997 Chapter 16 "Nagasaki Inferno" pp199–209 describes "boarding a transport plane packed with reporters headed for Nagasaki.[for example: photographers 1. see Google image search Nagasaki Bernard Hoffman (LIFE Magazine) 2. Bettmann/CORBIS September 13, 1945 Stanley Troutman (Acme war pool) 3. Nagasaki and verso&lt;ref&gt;http://digarc.usc.edu/search/controller/view/examiner-m16535.html&lt;/ref&gt;]Other officers and correspondents headed for Hiroshima about the same time, so the world would soon know more than it was prepared to digest about the horrors of the [[atomic bomb]]. ... I toured the city with the AP's Jim Hutcheson, among others. He and I had become good friends since our narrow escape on Corregidor. ... There were thousands of stories in Nagasaki and our group saw many pitiful sights of people with radiation burns who, in dreadful agony, were slowly dying. The first thing Japanese doctors asked was if American doctors had a cure for the bomb's effects on the human body. ... We received a report from GHQ that American doctors were coming to Nagasaki soon...." Snyder acknowledges what he calls Wilfrid Burchett's "ingenuity" in successfully reporting from Hiroshima. Snyder does not mention George Weller or any dispatches of George Weller's from Nagasaki. Joe Snyder [1983; owner and editor of the North Missourian] and [[Walter Cronkite]] [1964; CBS] are both recipients of the Missouri School of Journalism Honor Medal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.journalism.missouri.edu/honor-medal/winners-individuals.html|title=The Missouri Honor Medal - Missouri School of Journalism|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the first days of the Occupation reporters were cleared to cover freeing and rescue operations on behalf of these prisoners. Weller comments: "What the command wanted covered was the [[Prisoner-of-war camp|prison camps]] of northern [[Japan]]. The dam was to be opened to one last orgy of home town stories, more mindless and more alike than the slow molasses drippings of four years of sloppy, apolitical, dear-mom war....I did not feel that the right way to end this war was to...chew more fodder about what-beasts-the-Japs-are and Jimmy-looks-skinnier-today."&lt;ref&gt;[''First into Nagasaki'' page 5 and 6]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[U.S. military]] in [[Tokyo]] censored approximately 55,000 words of his dispatches, along with more than 100 photographs.&lt;ref&gt;''[Acknowledgments pages 317-8 First into Nagasaki Edited and with an Essay by Anthony Weller]''&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Weller does not refer to governmental censorship of any photographs of his related to Nagasaki.

On January 7, 2009 the ''[[The Daily Telegraph|Telegraph]]'' published Nagasaki photographs dated September 5, 1945: "After we asked readers for stories and photographs relating to Britain at War, we received these fascinating photographs of Nagasaki and [[Hiroshima]] from Cecil A. Creber, who took them less than a month [Nagasaki = September 5, 1945] after the atom bombs were dropped on both cities [August 6 and 9 1945]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/picturegalleries/worldnews/4162716/Photographs-of-Hiroshima-and-Nagasaki-taken-by-a-British-serviceman-a-month-after-the-atom-bombs-were-dropped.html?image=6|title=Photographs of Hiroshima and Nagasaki taken by a British serviceman a month after the atom bombs were dropped|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Linlithgow Gazette'' November 28, 2008 "Amazing atomic aftermath pics set for key war archives" features a photo of Creber captioned "Life through a lens: Cecil with his faithful Ensign box camera."

On February 13, 2010 ''Mainichi'' published "New color footage of Nagasaki A-bomb devastation shows need for greater research resources" plus a 01/05/2010 Photo Special [film circa September 11, 1945 found at the United States National Archives in Washington D.C. by Professor Burke-Gaffney].

Weller writes these correspondents "looked like yacht passengers who have stopped to buy basketry on an island." He writes that Colonel McCrary "offered to take [[Carbon copy|carbons]] of my stories and file them when airborne." The reporters under McCrary's leadership were not subject to censorship, making their dispatches especially valuable. Weller writes: "I refused." "How could I close up my atomic laboratory, with the work only half finished?"...and concludes with the explanation that his refusal is because he wanted to write "something free, big and formal....something ample, leisurely and magnificent." [''First into Nagasaki'' page 19-20]

Haugland of The Associated Press states: "We offered Weller a ride back to Tokyo with us,...."[see Haugland ''infra'' p.&amp;nbsp;20] Weller describes a feeling of "hopelessness" about his dispatches because the [[Kempeitai]] to whom he claims to have entrusted the stories had "returned to Nagasaki, but they had no message for me."[''First into Nagasaki'' page 21] Weller, although working as a reporter for a daily publication, chose to refuse an offered opportunity either to timely send his Nagasaki dispatches uncensored from the aircraft or alternatively to confront the Occupation censorship directly by filing in Tokyo, despite writing: "I wanted to be prepared to defend every line. If the stories were blocked as reprisal against me, I intended to take the case to [[Douglas MacArthur|MacArthur]] himself."[''First into Nagasaki'' page 18]

Weller traveled to Nagasaki from [[Kanoya]] airbase with Sergeant [[Gilbert Harrison (soldier)|Gilbert Harrison]]. Harrison's career later included: Chairman of the [[American Veterans Committee]]; editor and publisher of ''[[The New Republic]]'' magazine; author of several books. In Harrison's memoir [''Parts of a Past'' iUniverse June 2009 pages 81–2] he describes carrying George Weller's Nagasaki reporting from an airstrip outside Nagasaki to the ''Chicago Daily News'' in Tokyo:
{{quote|'You'll be the errand boy,' he[Weller] informed me[Harrison]. The plane we'd met was going on to Tokyo.... ...I picked up my belongings and Weller's copy. He wrote down the name and address of his ''Daily News'' associate in Tokyo...and the near-empty plane took off. A bus awaited us at Atsugi airport outside Tokyo and the plane crew and I were driven to the American-occupied Dai-Ichi Hotel....That night I slept between sheets and the following morning delivered Weller's story to the ''Daily News''. As payment, a rowdy evening's entertainment was provided at an establishment catering to thirsty American officers and featuring compliant Japanese girls who were not of the Geisha class.}}

A ''Boston Globe'' article by Gerald R. Thorp of the ''Chicago Daily News'' "TOKYO, Sept. 10(CDN) 'New Brand of Jap to Him!'" indicates that Harrison was by September 10, 1945 accompanying correspondents in Tokyo.

The first dispatch presented in ''First into Nagasaki'' (see page 25 and photos on cover and back inside endpaper) is datelined ''Nagasaki September 6'' and reads: ..."After a 24-hour trip on what seemed like dozens of trains, the writer arrived here this afternoon as the first visitor from the outside Allied world." On ''September 6'' the ''[[Chicago Daily News]]'' printed a dispatch under Weller's byline datelined ''Kanoya'', which begins:
{{quote|The veteran 25th portable hospital, numbering many [[Chicago]]ans and downstate [[Illinois]]ans, jumped from ships today to become the first American hospital in southern Japan. Every doctor but one is a [[Rush Medical College]] graduate. Commanded by tall Maj. Frederic de Peyster] of 445 Cedar St. [[Winnetka, Illinois|Winnetka]], they include Capt. Hugo Baum, 55 E. Washington st., Chicago, and Capt. Edward Murphy, Dixon, Ill., who comprise a special surgical team, and Capt. Roy Swanson, [[Leadville]], Colo.}}

The remainder of Weller's dispatch consists of a series of direct quotations from men of this medical corps with names, addresses, and photographs (these last are not from in Japan but are formal military portraits). Samples:
{{quote|'Tell the boys on the Chicago Daily News fifth floor that the heat here is terrific,' said Corp. Carl Johnson, 4729 N. Avers av., Chicago Daily News composing room employee on leave in service....Corp. Walter Newman, [[Beloit, Wisconsin|Beloit]], Wis., drove past with a box marked 'human blood' and said, 'I've seen it--let's go home.'}}

After the September 6 dispatch from Kanoya, Weller's next dispatch was printed on September 12 with an "[[Ōmuta, Fukuoka|Ōmuta]], [[Kyūshū|Kyushu]]" dateline (Omuta was a prisoner of war camp approximately 100 miles by railroad from Nagasaki and twice that from Kanoya. Headlined "New Saga of Boldness For Wermuth as Captive" it is an account of the famous "One-Man-Army" Captain [[Arthur W. Wermuth]] continuing his leadership as a POW on a Hellship carrying prisoners to Japan.

=== Photographs ===

The photograph in ''First into Nagasaki'' facing the ''Introduction by Anthony Weller xv'' is captioned "George Weller (r.) with Admiral Chester Nimitz on board the U.S.S. ''Missouri'' for the treaty signing, Tokyo Bay, September 2, 1945." This caption is incorrect since the figure on the left of the picture is not Fleet Admiral Nimitz, the signer as United States Representative of the proceedings' documents. In all still images and moving pictures of the Japanese surrender ceremony Nimitz is seen wearing Navy cap with full "[[scrambled eggs]]" denoting his five-star rank. The personage in the photograph appears to be John Knight, publisher of the ''Chicago Daily News'', who was in attendance on the USS ''Missouri'' as a guest of the Secretary of the Navy.

With reference to this photograph ''supra'' presented in ''First into Nagasaki'', the Battleship Missouri Memorial at [[Pearl Harbor]]: "can confirm that the individual pictured to the left in the photograph is not Fleet Admiral Nimitz." http://www.ussmissouri.org &lt;ref&gt;visitors can "walk in the footsteps of" on the famous Surrender Deck of the 'Mighty Mo'&lt;/ref&gt;

George Weller was actually photographed with a prominent naval figure Hiram Cassidy[sic] by the Associated Press on March 25, 1943 AP Images ID 4303250106. The picture was taken just before Weller's letter to the Foreign Editor of the ''Chicago Daily News'' quoted in ''Weller's War'' pp355–6. At left is Commander Hiram Cassedy[correct spelling], then Captain of ''Searaven'', hero of several submarine engagements in South-west Pacific (''Submarine Operations in World War II'' US Naval Institute Eight Printing December 1965 pages 104,193-4,233,463). At right is George Weller wearing British-type tropical uniform of shorts and knee socks. Cassedy (later Admiral) commanding ''Tigrone'' went on to lead a submarine group "Hiram's Hecklers" and also to hold the Pacific record for "lifeguard" duty (with 31 rescues; Ibid. pp 471–3).

The ''Chicago Daily News'' September 8, 1945 printed prominently two photographs credited 'Associated Press [[Wirephoto]]' showing one American foreign correspondent amidst an obliterated surrounding former city. These photographs feature in the background what has become the widely recognized symbol for the atom bombs dropped on Japan, the shell of a pre-war structure which has been preserved as it looked then. Now commonly referred to as "[[A-Bomb Dome]]" it is on the [[UNESCO World Heritage]] List registered as "[[Hiroshima Peace Memorial]]." The CDN 1945 captions read:
#"An Allied war correspondent looks over the twisted steel and masonry in what was the city of Hiroshima before it was struck by an atomic bomb."
#"No show tonight. An Allied war correspondent stands in a sea of rubble, looking at the remains of what once was a Hiroshima movie theatre." [Nagasaki photographs (Associated Press: Stanley Troutman; creation date September 13, 1945) in database AP Images (available through libraries).]

Photographs of Nagasaki had already been printed September 1, 1945. Caption: "Nagasaki Today - Japanese workers (foreground) carry away debris in a devastated area of atom-bombed Nagasaki. Smokestacks and a lone building stand in the background. This picture is from [[Domei]], official Jap news agency." Transmission credit is to Associated Press Wirephoto.

Photographs published in ''First into Nagasaki'' in 2006 already had appeared in the ''Chicago Daily News'' in 1945. [emphasis added]

== Newspaper prints of Weller's stories ==

The ''Los Angeles Times'' on September 16, 1945 published a front page article "By George Weller Chicago Daily News Foreign Service Nagasaki. (Delayed) U.S. Prisoner Sees A-Bomb Rip Nagasaki." &lt;ref&gt;database ProQuest Historical Newspapers ''Los Angeles Times'' (1881-1986)&lt;/ref&gt; Substantial portions of this ''Los Angeles Times'' September 16, 1945 published article are contained in two dispatches in ''First into Nagasaki'': 1. First Dispatch September 6, 1945 2300 pages 25–7; 2. Fifth Dispatch September 8, 1945 0300 pages 35–6. Both these dispatches are part of a group of eight dispatches (pages 25–45) which are described in ''First into Nagasaki'' as never published. The ''Los Angeles Times'' page one article of September 16, 1945 with its sub-headline "Witnesses Describe Parachutes Falling and Searing Blast" includes Weller's interviews with Captain Farley, POWs Bridgman and King, and Dutch doctor Vink (all in Dispatch #5) and Weller's interview with the Japanese lieutenant, aide to the district's commander (Dispatch #1). The ''Los Angeles Times'' article has the following introductory paragraph: "The following story, delayed by censorship, is an eyewitness account by an American observer of the results of the atomic bomb dropped on Nagasaki and includes the stories of men on the ground who saw the bomb fall."

The ''Boston Evening Globe'' on September 15, 1945 published a page one article "By George Weller Nagasaki" with bold all caps headline "American Saw Atom Bomb Hit Nagasaki" using content described as "unpublished" [page 24 ''First into Nagasaki''] and at the end of the article "Continued on Page 2" is the following: "(Copyright, 1945, by the Boston Globe and Chicago Daily News.)". Text from Dispatch #6 and Dispatch #1 is used (example: "Walk in Nagasaki's streets today and you walk in ruins." This is the first line of Dispatch #1). Weller's interview with the Japanese lieutenant (Dispatch #1) is used in the ''Boston Evening Globe'' article as is Weller's interview with Captain Farley (Dispatch #5), and Weller's interview with Dr. Nakashima (Dispatch #8). Quoted statements by ex-POWs Bridgman and King (Dispatch #5) are in this ''Boston Evening Globe'' article, which covers both Japanese and Allied observers' eyewitness accounts of the bomb as well as Dr. Nakashima's description of the bomb's medical symptoms. The Boston article reads: "However, about 70 percent of deaths have been from plain burns." (Dispatch #6). The ''New York Post'' on September 15, 1945 published an article by George Weller headlined "U.S. Prisoners Held at Nagasaki Describe Terrors of Atom Blast" using the same line of text as the Boston article (Dispatch #1), death statistics (Dispatch #3) and re-located position of POW camp (Dispatch #4). The New York article includes Weller's interviews with Captain Farley, Dr. Vink, Harold Bridgman, and Fred King (Dispatch #5). The article concludes with the bomb's "peculiar 'disease'" (Dispatch #8).

The ''Miami Herald'' on September 18, 1945 published an article "By George Weller Miami Herald-Chicago Daily News Wire" headlined: "American Tells of Being Atomic Bombed" with quote above: "'I Hit the Ground...Building Began To Quiver'". In this article are quotations and statistical data from Dispatch #3 "The known dead number 20,000, Jap police tell me, and they estimate about 4,000 bodies remain to be found" along with "The wounded are estimated to be about twice the number of dead." "Walk in Nagasaki's streets today and you walk in ruins." (Dispatch #1) Also, Captain Farley's eyewitness account (Dispatch #5) is quoted. The interviews with Bridgman and King (Dispatch #5) are included as well as information from Dr. Nakashima  (Dispatch #8) and the interview with the Japanese lieutenant, aide to the district commander (Dispatch #1).

George Weller's own response "In hours of walking through these areas I experienced no burns or signs of debilitation." is from Dispatch #3 (''First into Nagasaki'' page 30) which mentions Weller's "nausea"&lt;ref&gt;http://resources.library.yale.edu:2007/u?/yale-ydn,12963 Yale Daily News Book Supplement April 30, 1979 page 7: Students plunge into writing careers ...For several Yale undergraduates, the imaginative impulse has been strong enough to yield written results. Both Gollin and Junior Anthony Weller produced two novels during their first two years at Yale....Real-life people and familiar scenes provide the basis for Weller's novels. He concentrates on telling the story and lets meanings work their way in surreptitiously. The writer's most difficult task is to be true to his characters, Weller believes. "A writer must think out vivid characters; he must know what they will say and how they will act. For example, a girl from Long Island would comment 'I feel a little nauseous' not just 'I feel nauseous.'" Weller plans his characters' actions like chess moves that have many repercussions. "The action keeps readers interested. They want to find out what events, cause changes in attitudes, rather than the thoughts of a character." Writing his second novel, he encounters a dangerous urge to make it too complicated, too literary. He has spent two and a half years writing and revising his book about a college student who begins to face responsibilities involving other people, and must ponder what relation women will have to his life. Weller has already begun work on a third novel that's "less quiet" than the other two; it concerns a man whose best friend attempts to murder him. ... None of these students currently take any English or creative writing courses at Yale. ... Weller explains that he would not take a creative writing course because "there's a point when you have the urge to develop on your own -- without interference."&lt;/ref&gt; not reported in the ''Miami Herald'' article of 1945.

The ''Miami Herald'' article incorrectly states atomic POW casualties "Forty-eight were killed instantly and four others died later." while Dispatch #5 states "Forty-eight were wounded, four instantly killed, and four, including Aalders, died." The incorrect POW casualty figures also appear in Weller's ''Los Angeles Times'' article of September 16, 1945 and his ''New York Post'' article of September 15, 1945, and his article in the ''Akron Beacon Journal'' headlined "Yank Saw Atom Bomb Wipe Out Nagasaki" and above that "It Was 'Terrific, White Flash'" September 15, 1945 (this article includes interviews ''supra'' from Dispatch#1, Dispatch#5, and Dispatch#8). The Associated Press' Vernon Haugland quotes Dr. Vink "only four of our 200 prisoners were killed"[outright when the bomb exploded; four more died subsequently] in article published widely, including in the ''New York Times'' and on September 10, 1945 in the ''Miami Herald''. Thus papers in New York, Boston, Los Angeles, Miami, and Akron all print Weller's incorrect casualty statistics, whilst Dispatch#5 gives correct data, as does the Associated Press in 1945.

Eight Dispatches (pages 25–45) are described in ''First into Nagasaki'' as written in Nagasaki September 6–9 with Weller "sending them off to MacArthur's military censors in Tokyo, hopeful that they were being cabled onward to his editors at the ''Chicago Daily News'' and thence to a vast American readership via syndication. These dispatches have remained unpublished for sixty years; it appears that the U.S. government destroyed the originals."
The fact of publication by the ''Los Angeles Times'', ''Boston Evening Globe'', ''New York Post'', ''Miami Herald'', and ''Akron Beacon Journal'' is irreconcilable to George Weller's assertion that: "...I sent 25,000 words by the hands of the obliging ''kempeitai'', the secret police, directly to MacArthur. ... All my dispatches were suppressed. Every one of my 25,000 words was killed by MacArthur's censorship, which went on afterward, month after month."[''First into Nagasaki'' page 313]

Censorship of correspondents reporting from Japan for newspapers outside Japan ended October 6, 1945, continuing only for the Japanese media.

In ''The Weller Dispatches by Anthony Weller''[page 291 ''First into Nagasaki''] is statement that "...the editors cut Weller's cynical closing phrase...." The ''Chicago Daily News'' text last line is: "That's how Jap wardens cured decadent Americans, but lost the war." The ''Miami Herald'' text last line is: "That's how Japanese wardens cured decadent Americans but lost the war--so it says here in fine print."

On September 18, 1945 the ''Miami Herald'' published article by George Weller "Japan Holds Prisoners In Secret" on Chinese prisoners on Kyushu, based on information source Lt. Edward Little (later court-martialled for crimes while a POW. This article has close to identical text with the article included in ''Weller's War'' pages 618-9 and there described as: "This dispatch was censored by MacArthur and never published."

The ''Los Angeles Times'' on September 29, 1945 printed another article "By George Weller Chicago Daily News Foreign Service Nagasaki September 28 Californians Worked to Death on Dam by Japs." Most of this article printed in the ''Los Angeles Times'' is contained in the dispatch dated September 24, 1945 published in ''First into Nagasaki'' pages 139-143.

For sixty years Weller's own carbon of these dispatches were presumed lost, until they were discovered by Weller's son, Anthony, six months after George Weller's death.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Weller, ''The Weller Dispatches by Anthony Weller pages 305-6 First into Nagasaki'', Edited and with an Essay by Anthony Weller: VII&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies ==

=== Title claim, who was first ===

Weller claims that he was "the first Westerner to enter either of the bombed cities after Japan surrendered" &lt;ref&gt;''Chicago Daily News'' August 14, 1965 page 20&lt;/ref&gt; and that "No other correspondent had yet evaded the authorities to reach either Hiroshima or Nagasaki."&lt;ref&gt;''First into Nagasaki'' page 3&lt;/ref&gt;  However, other reports note people entering the city as early as August 22, and the earliest dispatch from Weller was dated September 6 (see below).

Australian journalist Wilfrid Burchett arrived in Hiroshima on September 3, 1945, and a Hiroshima dispatch from him was printed September 5, 1945 in the London ''Daily Express''.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Manne ''Quadrant'' August 1985 (reprinted in ''Left Right Left: Political Essays 1977-2005'' "He Chose Stalin: The Case of Wilfrid Burchett"); ''The Monthly'' June 2008; [[Tibor Méray]] ''On Burchett'' 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

George Weller:
"...I entered it [Nagasaki] on September 6, 1945, as the first free westerner to do so after the end of the war." [page 3]
"...the writer arrived here [Nagasaki] this afternoon as the first visitor from the outside Allied world." [page 25]
"...the writer--the first Allied observer to reach Nagasaki since the surrender--..." [page 43]
Anthony Weller:
"...no outsider had been in yet, not even from the U.S. military." [pages 245-246]

Weller [Part I First into Nagasaki in the book ''First into Nagasaki'' page 3] writes: "Whenever I see the word 'Nagasaki,' a vision arises of the city when I entered it on September 6, 1945, as the first free westerner to do so after the end of the war. No other correspondent had yet evaded the authorities to reach either Hiroshima or Nagasaki."

However, the ''Chicago Daily News'' on August 30, 1945 published under size extra large headline: ''"1st INSIDE STORY OF HIROSHIMA Reporter Tells How City Vanished in Atom Blast"'' a notable scoop by [[Leslie Nakashima]] written for [[United Press]] (and also printed in the ''New York Times'' "Newsman finds all of Hiroshima gone after atom blow.") Born in [[Hawaii]] and previously a reporter for the ''[[Honolulu Star-Bulletin]]'' and a foreign correspondent with wire agency UP in pre-war Tokyo this Nisei's dispatch includes: "...I arrived at Hiroshima at 5 A.M. Aug. 22, to find out about my mother, who lived in the outskirts of the city. Alighting from the train, I found that Hiroshima station—once one of the largest in western Japan—no longer existed. ...The sight before me as I headed for the outskirts of the city where my mother lived was unbelievable. It was unbelievable because only a fortnight before the bombing I had seen the city intact when I evacuated my wife and two daughters to central Japan. Except for one or two bombs dropped on separate occasions by B-29's, Hiroshima had not been subjected to heavy incendiary attacks. ...But I found my mother safe. She had been weeding grass in a relative's vegetable field about two miles southeast of the city when she saw the flash....A school in the suburbs near mother's home has been converted into a field hospital to care for people who suffered burns. The majority of these cases is believed hopeless. Many of the victims are unidentifiable. Even now two or three patients are dying daily at this one hospital."

And the ''Chicago Daily News'' published a dispatch by Associated Press war correspondent Vern Haugland on page one under size large headline: "U.S. Writer Views Hiroshima" Continued dispatch section headline: "''First U.S. Reporter Sees Hiroshima Ruins''."

Correspondents from the ''Headliner-Dateliner'' group with Lt. Col. John 'Tex' McCrary of the [[United States Strategic Air Forces in the Pacific|Strategic Air Forces]] visited both Hiroshima (September 4–5) and Nagasaki (September 8–9), publishing a series of thorough and informative dispatches which covered both atomic cities and included medical aspects.

=== Parachutes ===

Several of the eyewitnesses Weller interviewed described seeing a parachute, or parachutes, falling on the day of the bombing. In an account published more than twenty years after his visit to Nagasaki, Weller asserts that the bomb which destroyed Nagasaki was a "lazy-falling missile floating under a parachute.""...riding under a silk handkerchief." [''First into Nagasaki'' page 3] Since the bomb did not descend by [[parachute]] (a fact well known twenty years later) this description is incorrect. {{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

Parachutes were attached to instruments were dropped by support-planes during the mission to measure the effects of the blast.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chugoku-np.co.jp/hiroshima-koku/en/exploration/index_20071113.html Q&amp;A about the atomic bomb], Chugoku Shimbun, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

=== pre-atomic raids on Nagasaki ===

In the same 1967 account Weller asserts that Nagasaki, prior to August 9, 1945 "...in the face of all logic, it had been spared so far....Streams of [[B-29]]s flowed north and south around it, but this prime target remained mysteriously untouched." &lt;ref&gt;''First into Nagasaki'' page 14-15&lt;/ref&gt; Weller offers several theories connected with the supposed sparing of Nagasaki.

Contrary to George Weller's unaccountable assertion that Nagasaki before August 9, 1945 was "mysteriously untouched", Nagasaki had in fact been targeted in August 1945, August 1944,&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'' front page headline: "JAPANESE, SUMATRA, PHILIPPINE PORTS BOMBED" article headlined: "Palembang, Main Japanese Oil Center, and Nagasaki Swept by Great Waves of Fire" [08/11/1944] text: "rained bombs for one and one-half hours on industrial targets at Nagasaki" [08/12/44]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the April 1945 raid which became famous as "The legend of Lieut. Gene Flewellen and his B-29, the ''Experiment Perilous''...a 'one-plane air force.'" &lt;ref&gt;[New York Times'' 05/01/1945]&lt;/ref&gt; making George Weller's statement incorrect.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

On, August 10, 1944 Nagasaki had been bombed by B-29s "launched from China against Nagasaki's urban area. The twenty-four attacking bombers unloaded 4 tons of [[fragmentation bombs]] and 77 tons of incendiaries on the primary. {{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

There is an element of foreshadowing in the fact that Nagasaki was the first Japanese city to be attacked and [[Firebombing|firebombed]] by [[United States Army Air Forces|AAF]] 'precision' bombers, in view of what the city was to experience almost one year later." &lt;ref&gt;[''Blankets of Fire: U.S. bombers over Japan during World War II'' [[Smithsonian Institution]] Press 1996 Kenneth Werrell page 105]&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 27, 1945, Lieut. Gene Flewellen commanding the B-29 ''Experiment Perilous'' was forced by weather to abandon his original target on Kyūshū and, without accompanying aircraft, flew southward down the coast seeking a target of opportunity and bombed the Nagasaki dock area. The absence of anti-aircraft fire indicated that the Japanese were "entirely surprised. The lone B-29 wheeled and headed south. Several hours later the pilot put the huge craft down at Saipan, with ten minutes of gas left in his tanks." &lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'' May 1, 1945 Delayed George Jones by wireless "B-29, twice astray, looses solo blows&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 3, 1945 ''[[New York Times]]'' had carried the front page headline "BOMBERS FIRE GREAT NAGASAKI SHIPYARDS" and a page one story beginning "Nagasaki, one of the three major shipbuilding centers of Japan and ninth port of the empire, was left aflame yesterday, its dockyards smashed and its harbor littered with sunken ships by over 250 planes of [[George Kenney|General George C. Kenney]]'s Far East Air Force." The article continues with a full description of the air battle over Nagasaki, and the destruction of oil tanks, ships, warehouses and railyard. The raid of August 2, 1945 included [[B-25 Mitchell|Mitchell]] and [[B-24 Liberator|Liberator]] bombers as well as [[P-47 Thunderbolt|Thunderbolt]] and [[P-51 Mustang|Mustang]] fighter planes. Weller's assertion published in 1967 is not consistent with this prominent, lengthy and detailed ''New York Times'' coverage, nor with his own assertion published in 2006 at the end of the very first dispatch datelined Nagasaki (September 6, 1945 2300 hours) that the city had had "one earlier serious raid." &lt;ref&gt;''First into Nagasaki'' page 27&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Fremont Solstice Parade''' is an annual event produced in June by the [[Fremont Arts Council]] (FAC), a non-profit organization based in the [[Fremont, Seattle|Fremont]] neighborhood of [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], USA, that supports the arts and artists in and around the city. It is a [[Mardi Gras]] styled, entirely human powered event that is distinguished from mainstream public parades by its unusual rules. These four rules are "No written words, signage or recognizable logos; no motorized vehicles (except wheelchairs); no live animals (except guide animals); and no functional weapons." The event appears as a slowly paced music, dance and character procession where direct crowd interaction is encouraged and ensembles of actors in costume entertain with political and social commentary.

The Solstice Parade was founded in 1989 by Barbara Luecke and Peter Toms, and quickly grew to thousands of participants and tens of thousands of spectators. The [[parade]] kicks off the '''Fremont Fair''', which for many years was a benefit for [[Solid Ground (Seattle)|Solid Ground]] (originally known as the Fremont Public Association). On January 29, 2010, Solid Ground announced that it is turning over ownership of the fair to the Fremont Chamber of Commerce.&lt;ref&gt;Cheryl Cobbs, [http://solidgroundblog.wordpress.com/ Solid Ground transitions Fremont Fair to Fremont Chamber], Solid Ground Blog, 2010-01-29. Accessed online 2010-01-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Details ==

The parade is famous for its style and flair, political humor, energetic ensembles, and creative floats. It is also widely known for the body-painted [[Solstice Cyclists]], who strip down before the parade and [[body painting|paint their bodies]], unofficially starting the event each year. In 2015, the Solstice Cyclists were estimated at over 1500 individuals by Peter Toms, parade co-founder, following the event.
 
The [[procession|Fremont Solstice Pageant]], a large-scale community play using over a hundred actors, musicians and giant puppets, was performed following the parade from 1997 to 2005 at the end of the parade route at [[Gas Works Park]].

In 2017 the Solstice Parade took place on June 17, 2017.

In 2018 the Fremont Solstice Parade will be at 1pm on Saturday the 16th of June. The free of charge, all-ages, nude bicycle portion of the Solstice celebration begins 2 hours PRIOR to the Parade. &lt;ref&gt;[http://fremontfair.com/ Fremont Fair - June 16-17 2018]&lt;/ref&gt; Buses will be running all regular routes throughout the parade weekend; because Parking is always a bitch.

The event distinguishes itself from other mainstream parades with its unusual rules restricting printed words and motor vehicles.  As the Fremont Arts Council states:
# No printed words, signage or recognizable logos.
# No live animals (except guide animals).
# No motorized vehicles (except motorized wheelchairs)
# No functional weapons.&lt;ref&gt;

{{Expand Spanish|Batalla del vino|topic=culture|date=March 2009}}
[[File:Batalla del Vino - Haro - La Rioja.jpg|thumb|right|280px|Haro Wine Festival]]
'''Haro Wine Festival''' is a festival in the town of [[Haro, La Rioja|Haro]] in the [[La Rioja (autonomous community)|La Rioja]] region of northern [[Spain]]. It is held every year in the summer and involves a ''Batalla de Vino'' (Battle of Wine) where wines are poured at each other from buckets.

The celebration takes place on June 29, the day of the patron saint San Pedro. The day begins at 9:00 am, with a procession of people old and young,all carrying jugs, bottles, botas and other types of containers filled with red wine. Led by the town's mayor, on horseback, the procession winds through the town to the Cliffs of Bilibio, where a mass is celebrated at the Hermitage of San Felices de Bilibio.  After the mass a true free-for-all begins, with everyone tossing wine on each other until all are soaked from head to foot. Then at noon everyone returns to town to celebrate at the Plaza de la Paz, followed by bullfights in the town's bullring.  But the bullfights are only for the youth, and the "bulls" are actually just heifers. Also, none of the heifers are killed. Also, no bull-fighting happens at all. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/europe/spain/735093/Grapes--of-mirth.html | publisher=Telegraph Media Group Limited | work=The Telegraph | title=Grapes of mirth | date=2006-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hubert Raymond Allen''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|DFC}} (19 March 1919 – 31 May 1987) was a [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) officer and commentator on defence matters. He fought during the [[Battle of Britain]] and was an [[flying ace]] of the [[Second World War]], scoring 8 victories. Following his retirement from the RAF as a [[Wing commander (rank)|wing commander]] in 1965, Allen wrote several controversial books and articles on air power. He criticised RAF Air Staff policies before and during the Second World War. In contrast to the conventional narrative account, he maintained that during the Battle of Britain naval rather than air power was the crucial factor. His opinions clashed with mainstream opinion of the RAF's role, and with the views of many air historians, but his viewpoint received some support and significant attention.

==Career==
===Second World War===
Allen was commissioned into the [[Royal Air Force]] in 1939, the outbreak of war curtailing life as an undergraduate at Cardiff University where he was reading Economics. After training, he joined [[No. 66 Squadron RAF]] in mid-April 1940. Originally part of Fighter Command's [[No. 12 Group RAF|No. 12 Group]] covering the Midlands and East Anglia, No. 66 Squadron took part in the air battles over the Dunkirk evacuation. During the Battle of Britain, the squadron joined [[No. 11 Group RAF|No. 11 Group]] at [[Kenley]] for a week and later served at [[Gravesend]], [[West Malling]] and [[Biggin Hill]]. Allen had seven confirmed kills and was awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]].&lt;ref name=Times1987&gt;[[#CITEREFTimes1987|Obituary, Times, 1987]]&lt;/ref&gt;

His nickname, "Dizzy", reflected his ability to escape a tight situation by executing an aerobatic flat-spin. He was shot down and wounded on a number of occasions, once by the well-known ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' ace [[Werner Molders]] and again as a result of an air-to-air collision with another RAF pilot. In 1978, Allen recorded his experiences as a combat pilot for a BBC programme in which he expressed high praise for his fellow pilots and ground staff but was critical of the radar controllers and the higher echelons of the RAF. His attitude towards those pilots who refused combat was harshly uncompromising, though such feelings were not uncommon at this time.{{sfn|Allen, A Fine Blue Day}} After the Battle of Britain, he became No. 66 Squadron's commander squadron commander at age 21, succeeding Athol Forbes, with whom he later collaborated in writing, ''Ten Fighter Boys: 66 Squadron RAF'', a collection of first hand accounts of participants originally published in the middle of the war (1942).{{sfn|Allen &amp; Forbes, Ten Fighter Boys|2009}} Allen described his time with No. 66 Squadron in ''Fighter Squadron 1940–1942''.{{sfn|Allen, Fighter Squadron|1979}}

Later in the war he became Air Advisor to the [[1st Airborne Division]] and then Tactics and Gunnery Officer to No. 12 Group.

===Post-war service===
Post-war, he commanded a squadron of [[Gloster Meteor]] jet fighters. He was Air Defence Advisor to the Dutch Government for three years, and was awarded the [[Order of Orange-Nassau]]. Allen was a skilled pilot having moved from piston engine propeller-driven fighters to the newer generation of jets including the [[English Electric Lightning]], which had a speed exceeding 1,000&amp;nbsp;mph.

He planned the RAF's coronation flypast over the Queen's balcony at [[Buckingham Palace]] in 1953. During the later Queen's Coronation Review, he arranged for 168 aircraft of varying types to fly over the Queen at [[RAF Odiham]] in a series of coordinated formations despite appalling weather conditions. As wing commander, he was Personal Staff Officer to the Chief of Staff, Allied Air Forces Central Europe and after his retirement a member of the Corps of [[Queen's Messenger]]s, a [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]] courier service for the delivery of important diplomatic documents around the world.&lt;ref name=Times1987/&gt;

He retired in January 1965, later stating that his reason for leaving the RAF prematurely was concern over an RAF plan in the mid-1960s "to snatch the [[Fleet Air Arm]] from the Navy. I knew from my study of military strategy that the demise of the Fleet Air Arm would render ineffective the Navy's role in preserving the sea communications on which Britain utterly depends."{{sfn|Allen, The Legacy of Lord Trenchard|1972. page xi}}

==Writer==
Allen's ''The Legacy of Lord Trenchard'' questioned the need for an independent RAF and the rectitude of Air Staff policies before and during the Second World War. The provocatively titled ''Who Won the Battle of Britain'' (first published in 1974) followed shortly afterwards with a critique of RAF structure, leadership and doctrine before and during the air campaigns of 1940. Controversially, Allen stated that RAF Fighter Command's 11 Group was a defeated force at the time the invasion was most likely to have been launched.{{sfn|Allen, Battle of Britain, p.191|1976}} Allen argued that the Luftwaffe did not lose the Battle of Britain air campaigns – reasoning that the Luftwaffe's damaging attacks on airfields containing vital sector stations gave them air superiority during the critical period of late August to early September preceding the change of focus to the bombing of London after which it dropped thousands of tons of bombs with negligible losses. But the Luftwaffe did not win it either as it lacked the training and equipment and therefore the potential to sink enough of the Royal Navy's warships, especially the large capital ships.

Allen maintained that it was the deterrent effect of the Royal Navy [[fleet in being]] that was the decisive factor in Adolf Hitler's decision not to launch [[Operation Sea Lion]], the planned invasion of Great Britain. The air battles were important but not fundamental.{{sfn|Allen, Battle of Britain, pp. 204–207}}  Having been made aware of the naval problems by the German Naval Staff, [[Adolf Hitler]] took Luftwaffe chief [[Hermann Göring]]'s advice and switched to a [[Douhet]] night bombing campaign against civilian centres to try and force the United Kingdom into a negotiated peace. He concluded that "the Battle of Britain has been glorified to the point of hyperbole by British historians".{{sfn|Allen, Battle of Britain, p.204}}

===Primacy of sea power, 1940===
Allen's case for the primacy of sea power in 1940 is not unique. [[Derek Robinson (novelist)|Derek Robinson]] and Geoff Hewitt have argued similarly, seeing the Royal Navy as the main invasion deterrent in 1940.  However, neither criticised the RAF's leadership and strategy as emphatically as Allen.{{sfn|Robinson, Invasion 1940, 2005. Hewitt, Hitler's Armada, 2008}} Some air historians have argued that Fighter Command's 11 Group was "perilously close to collapse" owing to the loss of experienced pilots and damage to command and control infrastructure during the critical period.{{sfn|Addison &amp; Crang, The Burning Blue, p.3|2011}} 11 Group's continuing effectiveness was particularly important because the beaches upon which the Germans planned to land were within their operational area.

Anthony Cumming judged that the immense superiority of the Royal Navy in home waters together with the anti-maritime limitations of the Luftwaffe were the main reasons for effectively abandoning Operation Sea Lion in 1940.{{sfn|Cumming, The Royal Navy and the Battle of Britain, p.152, 2010. Cumming, The Institute of Historical Research, pp.165–188, 2010}}  In 1958, [[Duncan Grinnell-Milne]] submitted his case on behalf of the Royal Navy and in 1960 was further supported by Captain [[Stephen Roskill]], the British Official Naval Historian for the Second World War. Integrating elements of air and sea aspects, [[Telford Taylor]] put forward a thorough study of the question a few years later.{{sfn|Goulter et al|2006}}  In more recent years Cumming's ''The Royal Navy and the Battle of Britain'' has supported the primacy of seapower argument and [[James Holland (author)|James Holland]]'s ''The Battle of Britain'' has included a detailed account of the struggle at sea along with accounts of air combat.{{sfn|Cumming, Royal Navy, p.5, 51–52, 68 &amp; 72. Holland, The Battle of Britain: Five Months That Changed History, p.442, 2010}} Both show that sailors, soldiers and airmen were actively engaged in fighting the Germans during the Battle of Britain if the battle is defined to include events prior to the main air fighting such as the Norway campaign and the Dunkirk evacuation – [[Operation Dynamo]]. Even with a Luftwaffe victory in the air, neither Holland nor Cumming believes it likely that Operation Sea Lion would have succeeded if launched.{{sfn|Holland and Cumming, Warships International Fleet Review, pp.52–53, 2010}}

The press heavily criticised three historians from the Joint Services Staff Command College, who were portrayed in a History magazine and the national press as supporting the idea that the [[Royal Navy]] won the Battle of Britain. In Britain, at least, questions surrounding the role of the RAF in the Battle of Britain remain sensitive.{{sfn|James, History Today, pp.38–40|2006}} These historians later argued that this media coverage of their opinions was a 'silly season story par excellence', pointing out that the idea that a small number of young pilots had alone prevented a German invasion is something that historians have long disputed. What Battle of Britain accounts have lacked, they argued, is a more holistic approach that sees the campaign as one in which all three services had played a crucial role.{{sfn|Goulter et al. RUSI}} Allen's ''Who Won the Battle of Britain'' and his articles were a step in this direction. Both ''The Legacy of Lord Trenchard'' and ''Who Won the Battle of Britain'' show signs of having been influenced by the former war correspondent and [[Sunday Times]] Defence Correspondent [[David Divine]], another fierce critic of the air establishment. However, even Divine did not question the RAF's role and performance in the Battle of Britain as Allen did.{{sfn|Divine, The Broken Wing|1966}}

===Criticism===
Francis Mason criticised Allen's ''Who Won the Battle of Britain'' for displaying 'a bland ignorance of aircraft design' regarding the problems of fitting heavy calibre 0.5' machine guns to a [[Spitfire]] and 'ignoring the atmosphere of national parsimony in which successive air ministers and air staff members fought to provide any air defence at all.' Mason implied that Allen's criticism of the recently deceased Fighter Command chief, [[Air Marshal]] [[Sir Hugh Dowding]], who could no longer defend himself, was distasteful.{{sfn|Mason, RUSI, pp.84–85| 1974}}  Allen did indeed criticise Dowding's conduct of the battle, particularly for allowing the brunt of the fighting to fall upon the embattled 11 Group, but had also argued that Dowding's earlier achievements had been ignored in the failure to make him a [[Marshal of the Royal Air Force]] upon retirement.{{sfn|Allen, Battle of Britain, p.181}}  Dowding was sympathetically portrayed in the 1969 blockbuster feature film, ''[[Battle of Britain (film)|Battle of Britain]]'', and died in 1970. He was widely regarded as a national hero, and was officially acknowledged by the erection of his statue at the [[RAF Chapel]], St Clement Dane a few years later. Public criticism of Dowding was controversial during the 1970s, although [[Laddie Lucas]] and [[Douglas Bader]] also considered Dowding to have deployed a 'parochial' defence that prevented the full resources of Fighter Command being used.{{sfn|Lucas, Flying Colours, p.164}}

Alfred Price, a historian known for attacking Battle of Britain myths, criticised Allen's ''Times'' assertion that the [[Luftwaffe]] could have knocked Britain out of the war had it concentrated the night [[The Blitz|blitz]] against British ports. To achieve this, Price argued, 'the Luftwaffe would have had to mount a series of heavy and accurate attacks, repeated at regular intervals over a period of several months … the force lacked both the strength and equipment to achieve this'.{{sfn|Price, Times, p.17, 1973. Price, Aeroplane Monthly, p.23}}

Sir [[John Slessor]], a former RAF Director of Plans, 1937–1940, and Marshal of the Royal Air Force, claimed Allen's ''Times'' article on Lord [[Hugh Trenchard]], 'Father of the RAF' contained 'multiple mis-statements' but did not attempt to detail what these were. Slessor had a long and close relationship with Trenchard and his biographer commented that 'In his [Slessor's] years at the Air Ministry he now became one of the most passionate disciples of Lord Trenchard and his theories of strategic air power as a war-winning weapon'.{{sfn|Hastings, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. Slessor, p.17|1978}}

Margaret Salmond, widow of a senior air force officer also wrote a 'vehement protest' to Allen's phrase 'The Battle of Britain that never was' emphasising that 'we should never forget how much we owe to those brave young pilots …' reflecting a widely held perception that only a handful of RAF pilots had prevented the invasion.{{sfn|Salmond, Times, p.15|1978}} In fact it was never his intention to deprecate former comrades whom he had already praised but it was still difficult to attack popular perceptions of the RAF's role without seeming to attack 'the few'.

Allen's views were given prominent coverage in the ''Times'' during the 44th and 48th Battle of Britain anniversaries. Publicising these opinions in such a prominent way did not endear Allen to former RAF colleagues or to the general public.{{sfn|Allen, Times, p. 14|1974}}  Even his obituary writer considered Allen's views 'eccentric', not appearing to understand why previous editors took them as seriously as they did.&lt;ref name=Times1987/&gt;

[[Iraq]]'s era under President [[Saddam Hussein]] was notorious for its severe violations of [[human rights]]. [[Iraqi Intelligence Service|Secret police]], [[state terrorism]], [[torture]], [[mass murder]], [[rape]], [[deportation]]s, [[forced disappearance]]s, [[assassination]]s, [[chemical warfare]], and the destruction of southern Iraq's [[Mesopotamian Marshes|marshes]] were some of the methods the country's [[History of Iraq under Ba'athist rule|Ba'athist government]] used to maintain control. The total number of [[death]]s related to torture and murder during this period are unknown.  [[Human Rights Watch]] and [[Amnesty International]] issued regular reports of widespread [[imprisonment]] and torture.

==Documented human rights violations 1979–2003==
{{Refimprove section|date=February 2011}}
Human rights organizations have documented government-approved [[Capital punishment|executions]], acts of torture and [[rape]] for decades since Saddam Hussein came to power in 1979 until his fall in 2003.
[[File:Iraqmassgrave3.jpg|thumb|Mass grave.]]
* In  2002, a resolution sponsored by the [[European Union]] was adopted by the Commission for Human Rights, which stated that there had been no improvement in the human rights crisis in Iraq. The statement condemned President Saddam Hussein's [[government]] for its "systematic, widespread and extremely grave violations of human rights and [[international humanitarian law]]" and called on Iraq to cease "summary and arbitrary executions&amp;nbsp;... the use of rape as a political tool and all enforced and involuntary disappearances".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/1940050.stm | work=BBC News | title=UN condemns Iraq on human rights | date=2002-04-19 | accessdate=2016-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Full political participation at the national level was restricted only to members of the [[Ba'ath Party (Iraq)|Ba'ath Party]], which constituted only 8% of the population.
* Iraqi citizens were not legally allowed to assemble unless it was to express support for the government. The Iraqi government controlled the establishment of [[political parties]], regulated their internal affairs and monitored their activities.
* Police checkpoints on Iraq's roads and highways prevented ordinary citizens from traveling across country without government permission and expensive exit [[visa (document)|visa]]s prevented Iraqi citizens from traveling abroad. Before traveling, an Iraqi citizen had to post collateral. Iraqi females could not travel outside of the country without the escort of a male relative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/dateline/2010/01/iraq-citizenship-and-womens-rights.php|title=JURIST - Dateline&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=|accessdate=30 October 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100625060431/http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/dateline/2010/01/iraq-citizenship-and-womens-rights.php|archivedate=25 June 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The persecution campaigns led to the expulsion, flight and effective exile of the Feyli Kurds from their ancestral lands in [[Iraq]]. The persecution began when a large number of Feyli Kurds were exposed to a big campaign by the regime that began by the dissolved RCCR issuance for 666 decision, which deprived Feyli Kurds of Iraqi nationality and considered them as [[Iran]]ians.

* In April 1991, after Saddam lost control of [[Kuwait]] in the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]], he cracked down ruthlessly against [[1991 uprisings in Iraq|several uprisings]] in the Kurdish north and the [[Shia]] south. His forces committed full-scale [[wiktionary:massacre|massacres]] and other gross human rights violations against both groups similar to the violations mentioned before.&lt;ref name="Torment"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/reports/1992/Iraq926.htm |title=ENDLESS TORMENT, The 1991 Uprising in Iraq And Its Aftermath |publisher=Hrw.org |date= |accessdate=2016-08-21|quote=An independent French organization called The Truth About the Gulf War reported in June 1991 after a trip to Iraq that authorities were vague about the toll of the uprising, but 'the figures given for those killed, most of them in southern Iraq and the overwhelming majority of them civilians, ranged from 25,000 to 100,000 dead.'&amp;nbsp;...

A demographer at the U.S. Census Bureau, Beth Osborne Daponte, also arrived at the figure of 30,000 civilian deaths during the uprising.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In June 1994, the Hussein [[regime]] in Iraq established severe [[Sentence (law)|penalties]], including [[amputation]], branding and the [[death penalty]] for criminal offenses such as [[theft]], corruption, [[currency speculation]] and [[military]] [[desertion]], some of which are part of Islamic [[Sharia law]], while government members and Saddam's family members were immune from punishments ranging around these crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/reports/1995/IRAQ955.htm |title=Human Rights Watch, Iraq archive |publisher=Hrw.org |date= |accessdate=2009-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* On March 23, 2003, during the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], Iraqi [[television]] presented and interviewed [[prisoners of war]] on [[TV]], violating the [[Geneva Convention]].
* Also in April 2003, [[CNN]] revealed that it had withheld information about Iraq torturing [[journalist]]s and Iraqi citizens in the 1990s. According to CNN's chief news executive, the channel had been concerned for the safety not only of its own staff, but also of Iraqi sources and informants, who could expect punishment for speaking freely to [[reporter]]s.

* Also after the invasion, numerous torture centers were found in security offices and [[police station]]s throughout Iraq. The equipment found at these centers typically included hooks for hanging people by the hands for [[beating up|beating]]s, devices for [[electric shock]] and other equipment often found in nations with harsh security services and other authoritarian nations.

=='Saddam's Dirty Dozen'==
According to officials of the United States [[United States Department of State|State Department]], many human rights abuses in Saddam Hussein's Iraq were largely carried out in person or by the orders of Saddam Hussein and eleven other people.
The term "Saddam's Dirty Dozen" was coined in October 2002&lt;ref name="Dirty Dozen"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harris|first1=Paul|last2=Heslop|first2=Katy|title=Iraq's dirty dozen|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/mar/16/iraq2|accessdate=30 October 2017|work=The Guardian|date=16 March 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; (from a novel by [[E.M.

The list was used by the Bush Administration to help argue that the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|2003 Iraq war]] was against Saddam Hussein and the Baath Party leadership, rather than against the Iraqi people. The members are:&lt;ref name="Dirty Dozen"/&gt;

*[[Saddam Hussein]] (1937–2006), Iraqi President, responsible for many torturings, killings and of ordering the [[Halabja chemical attack|1988 cleansing of Kurds]] in Northern Iraq.
*[[Qusay Hussein]] (1966–2003),  son of the president, head of the elite [[Republican Guard (Iraq)|Republican Guard]], believed to have been chosen by Saddam as his [[wikt:successor|successor]].
*[[Uday Hussein]] (1964–2003), son of the president, had a private torture chamber, and was responsible for the rapes and killings of many women. He was partially [[paralyzed]] after a 1996 attempt on his life, and was leader of the [[paramilitary]] group [[Fedayeen Saddam]] and of the Iraqi [[Mass media|media]].
*[[Taha Yassin Ramadan]] (1938-2007), Vice-President, born in [[Iraqi Kurdistan]]. He oversaw the mass killings of a [[Shia Islam|Shi'a]] revolt in 1991.
*[[Tariq Aziz]] (1936–2015), Foreign Minister of Iraq,  backed up the executions by [[hanging]] of political opponents after the revolution of 1968.
*[[Barzan Ibrahim al-Tikriti]] (1951-2007), Hussein's brother, leader of the Iraqi secret service, ''[[Iraqi Intelligence Service|Mukhabarat]]''. He was Iraq's representative to the [[United Nations]] in [[Geneva]].
*[[Sabawi Ibrahim al-Tikriti]] (1947-2013), Hussein's half brother, he was the leader of the ''Mukhabarat'' during the 1991 [[Gulf War]]. Director of Iraq's general security from 1991 to 1996. He was involved in the 1991 suppression of Kurds.
*[[Watban Ibrahim al-Tikriti]] (1952–2015), Hussein's half brother, former senior Interior Minister who was also Saddam's presidential adviser. Shot in the leg by Uday Hussein in 1995. He has ordered tortures, rapes, murders and [[deportation]]s.
*[[Ali Hassan al-Majid]] (1941-2010), ''Chemical Ali'',  mastermind behind Saddam's lethal [[Poison gas|gassing]] of [[Rebellion|rebel]] Kurds in 1988; a first cousin of Saddam Hussein.
*[[Izzat Ibrahim ad-Douri]] (b. 1942), military commander, vice-president of the ''Revolutionary Command Council'' and deputy commander in chief of the armed forces during various military campaigns.
*[[Aziz Saleh Nuhmah]] (b. ?), appointed governor of [[Kuwait]] from November 1990 to February 1991,  ordered looting of stores and rapes of Kuwaiti women during his tenure. Also ordered the destruction of Shi'a holy sites during the 1970s and 1980s as governor of two Iraqi provinces.
*[[Mohammed Hamza Zubeidi]] (1938-2005), alias ''Saddam's thug'', Prime Minister of Iraq from 1991 to 1993 –  to have ordered many executions.&lt;ref name="Dirty Dozen"/&gt;

Methods of torture used by Saddam's regime included assault with brass knuckles and wooden bludgeons; electric shocks to the genitalia; scorched metal rods being forced into body orifices; the crushing of toes and removal of toenails; burning off limbs; lowering prisoners into vats of acid; poisoning with thallium; raping women in front of their family members; burning with cigarette butts; the crushing of bones; the amputation of ears, limbs, and tongues; and the gouging of eyes.&lt;ref&gt;Perazzo, John, [http://archive.frontpagemag.com/readArticle.aspx?ARTID=20937 Iraqi Horrors the "Peace Movement" Ignores], ''FrontPage Magazine,'' November 29, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nicholas Kristoff]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' commented: "Police in other countries use torture, after all, but there are credible reports that Saddam's police cut out tongues and use electric drills.

The destruction of Shi'a religious shrines by the former government has been compared "to the leveling of cities in the [[Second World War]], and the damage to the shrines [of Hussein and Abbas] was more serious than that which had been done to many European cathedrals."&lt;ref&gt;Milton Viorst, "Report from Baghdad," ''The New Yorker'', June 24, 1991, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; After the 1983-88 genocide, some 1 million Kurds were allowed to resettle in "model villages". According to a U.S. Senate staff report, these villages "were poorly constructed, had minimal sanitation and water, and provided few employment opportunities for the residents.

In January 2004, Human Rights Watch stated: "Having devoted extensive time and effort to documenting [Saddam's] atrocities, we estimate that in the last twenty-five years of Ba'th Party rule the Iraqi government murdered or 'disappeared' some quarter of a million Iraqis, if not more."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2004/01/25/war-iraq-not-humanitarian-intervention|title=War in Iraq: Not a Humanitarian Intervention|work=Human Rights Watch|date=2004-01-25|accessdate=2016-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A January 26, 2003 ''[[The New York Times]]'' article by John F. Burns similarly states "the number of those 'disappeared' into the hands of the secret police, never to be heard from again, could be 200,000." Noting that the [[Iran–Iraq War]] cost approximately 800,000 lives on both sides and that—while "surely a gross exaggeration"—Iraq estimated there were 100,000 deaths resulting from U.S. bombing in the [[Gulf War]], Burns concludes: "A million dead Iraqis, in war and through terror, may not be far from the mark."

For example, "Amnesty International reported that in 1981 over 350 people were officially executed in Iraq&amp;nbsp;... the Committee Against Repression in Iraq gives biographic particulars on 798 executions (along with 264 killings of unknown persons, and 428 biographies of unsentenced detainees and disappeared persons)." [[Kanan Makiya]] cautions that a focus on the death toll obscures the full extent of "the terror inside Iraq," which was largely the product of the pervasive secret police and systematic use of torture.&lt;ref name="Makiya 62-65"&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Kanan Makiya|last=Makiya|first=Kanan|title=Republic of Fear: The Politics of Modern Iraq, Updated Edition|publisher=University of California Press|year=1998|isbn=9780520921245|pp=62–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Iram  of the Pillars''' ({{lang-ar|إرَم ذات العماد}}, {{transl|sem|Iram dhāt al-ʿimād}}), also called "'''Aram'''", "'''Irum'''", "'''Irem'''", "'''Erum'''", or the "'''City of the tent poles'''," is a [[lost city]], region or tribe mentioned in the [[Quran|Qur'an]].&lt;ref name="Glassé, NEoI, 2003"&gt;{{cite book|last=Glassé|first=Cyril|title=The New Encyclopedia of Islam |year=2003 |edition=Revised |publisher=AltaMira Press|isbn=978-0-7591-0190-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=focLrox-frUC&amp;pg=PA26&amp;dq=Iram+of+the+Pillars&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=gPy9T7tH1NzyA7ea2asB&amp;ved=0CG4Q6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Iram%20of%20the%20Pillars&amp;f=false|author2=Huston Smith|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Qur’an, 86: 6 – 14"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://quran.com/89/6-14 |title=Surat Al-Fajr [89:6–14&amp;#93; - The Noble Qur'an - القرآن الكريم |publisher=Quran.com |accessdate=2013-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==
The Qur'an, revealed in the 7th century CE according to Islamic belief, mentions Iram in connection with ''‘imad'' ({{lang-ar|عماد}}, pillars) [Qur'an: The Dawn 89:7]:&lt;ref name="Qur’an, 86: 6 – 14"/&gt;
{{Quote Quran-range|89|6|14|
6: Have you not considered how your Lord dealt with [[ʿĀd|‘Aad]] -
7: [With] Iram – who had lofty pillars,
8: The likes of whom had never been created in the lands
9: And [with] [[Thamud]], who carved out the rocks in the valley?
10: And [with] Pharaoh, owner of the stakes? –
11: [All of] whom oppressed within the lands
12: And increased therein the corruption.
13: So your Lord poured upon them a scourge of punishment.
14: Indeed, your Lord is in observation.
}}
There are several explanations for the reference to "'''Iram''' – who had lofty pillars". Some see this as a geographic location, either a city or an area, others as the name of a tribe. Those identifying it as a city have made various suggestions as to where or what city it was, ranging from Alexandria or Damascus to a city which actually moved or a city called Ubar.&lt;ref name="Noegel2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Noegel|first=Scott B|title=The A to Z of Prophets in Islam and Judaism|date=2010|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-7603-3|page=151|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lNAWAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA151&amp;dq=Iram+++tribe++city+of+pillars&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=7adsU6D-F6Ok0QWp0YG4CA&amp;ved=0CGoQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Iram%20%20%20tribe%20%20city%20of%20pillars&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an area it has been identified with the biblical [[Aram, son of Shem]] and [[Aram (biblical region)|the biblical region known as Aram]].&lt;ref name="At-Tabari, SUoNY, 1999"&gt;{{cite book|last=Al-Tabari|title=The History of Al-Tabari: The Sassanids, the Lakhmids, and Yemen|date=1999|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0-7914-4356-9|page=180|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p2UHIQ9WyJ4C&amp;pg=PA180&amp;lpg=PA180&amp;dq=Iram+biblical+aram&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wM3E0kiZNz&amp;sig=CkxeJByWzpj_Nk1G_MYBYizz_u0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=QatsU57iB6We0QXz04Bg&amp;ved=0CFgQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=Iram%20biblical%20aram&amp;f=false|editor=Charles Edmund Bosworth}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been identified as a tribe, possibly the tribe of ʿĀd, with the pillars referring to tent pillars.&lt;ref name="Glassé, NEoI, 2003"/&gt;

"The identification of [[Wadi Rum]] with Iram and the tribe of ‘Ad, mentioned in the Qur’an, has been proposed by scholars who have translated [[Thamudic language|Thamudic]] and [[Nabataean Aramaic|Nabataean]] inscriptions referring to both the place Iram and the tribes of ‘Ad and Thamud by name."&lt;ref name=IU2011&gt;"Wadi Rum (Jordan)." International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Evaluation Report. May 2011. 11. http://whc.unesco.org/archive/advisory_body_evaluation/1377.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

According to some Islamic beliefs,&lt;ref name="Qur’an, 86: 6 – 14"/&gt; King [[Shaddad]]{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} defied the warnings of the prophet [[Hud (prophet)|Hud]] and [[Allah]] smote the city, driving it into the sands, never to be seen again. The ruins of the city lie buried somewhere in the sands of ''al-[[Rub' al Khali]]'' ({{lang-ar|الـربـع الـخـالي}}, the Empty Quarter). Iram became known to Western literature with the translation of the story "The City of Many-Coloured Iram and Abdullah Son of Abi Kilabah" in ''[[The Book of One Thousand and One Nights]]''.

== Juris Zarins and its identification as Ubar ==

In 1992 [[Ranulph Fiennes]] wrote a book called ''[[Atlantis of the Sands]]''  about a legendary lost city in the southern Arabian sands, claimed to have been destroyed by a natural disaster or as a punishment by God. Various names have been given to it including Iram.

Archaeologist [[Juris Zarins]] discussed Ubar in a 1996 interview saying “There's a lot of confusion about that word. If you look at the classical texts and the Arab historical sources, Ubar refers to a region and a group of people, not to a specific town. People always overlook that. It's very clear on Ptolemy’s second century map of the area. It says in big letters "Iobaritae" And in his text that accompanied the maps, he's very clear about that. It was only the late medieval version of ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'', in the fourteenth or fifteenth century, that romanticised Ubar and turned it into a city, rather than a region or a people."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/ubar/zarins/  Interview with Dr J. Zarins, Nova Online, Sept. 1996]&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2007, following further research and excavation, a study authored in part by Zarins could be summarised as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Blom, R., Crippen, R., Elachi, C., Clapp, N., Hedges, G., Zarins, J., “Southern Arabian Desert Trade Routes, Frankincense, Myrrh, and the Ubar Legend” in Remote Sensing in Archaeology, Interdisciplinary Contributions to Archaeology (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

* As far as the legend of Ubar was concerned, there was no evidence that the city had perished in a sandstorm. Much of the fortress had collapsed into a sinkhole that hosted the well, perhaps undermined by ground water being taken to irrigate the surrounding oasis.
* Rather than being a city, interpretation of the evidence suggested that “Ubar” was more likely to have been a region—the “Land of the Iobaritae” identified by Ptolemy. The decline of the region was probably due to a reduction in the frankincense trade caused by the conversion of the Roman Empire to Christianity, which did not require incense in the same quantities for its rituals. Also, it became difficult to find local labour to collect the resin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lawton|first1=John|title=Oman: Frankincense|journal=Aramco World|date=May–June 1983|volume=34|issue=3|pages=26–27|url=https://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/198303/oman-frankincense.htm|accessdate=1 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Climatic changes led to desiccation of the area, and sea transport became a more reliable way of transporting goods.

==In the Islamic Hadith==
There are many Hadiths about Iram perhaps the most interesting one is the story of ''Abdullah bin Qalabah'' who lost his camel and found Iram of the Pillars while searching for his camel. The story has been rejected by some Islamic scholars who said that the story is an [[Isra'iliyyat]] Hadith and that is because [[Ka’b al-Ahbar|Kaabul Ahbar]] was [[Jews|Jewish]] before he converted to [[Islam]] and he was accused by some scholars of narrating Isra'iliyyat stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.al-islam.org/kamaaluddin-wa-tamaamun-nima-vol-2-shaykh-saduq/chapter-54-shaddad-and-his-paradise-those-who-had|title=Chapter 54: Shaddad and his Paradise, those who had very long life-spans|website=Al-Islam.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FlNZ5wmo5LAC&amp;pg=PA17|title=The Muqaddimah : an introduction to history ; in three volumes. 1|last=Haldūn|first='Abd al-Rahmān ibn Muhammad Ibn|last2=Haldun|first2=Ibn|last3=Khaldūn|first3=Ibn|last4=Khaldun|first4=Ibn|last5=Ibn-Ḫaldūn|first5=ʿAbd-ar-Raḥmān Ibn-Muḥammad|last6=Khaldun|first6=Khaldun Ibn|last7=Ibn|last8=Ḫaldūn|first8=`Abd al-Raḥmān ibn Muḥammad Ibn|date=1958|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0691017549|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In fiction==

===Literature===
* Iram is used in quatrain 5 of the ''[[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam]]'' to describe the brevity of human endeavors.
* "Iram" is the lost city where the Muslim hero Thalaba was kept safe in [[Robert Southey]]'s ''[[Thalaba the Destroyer]]'' (1801)
* [[H. P. Lovecraft]] places it somewhere near "[[The Nameless City]]" in his stories (1921).&lt;ref name=Mythostomes&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mythostomes.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=31&amp;Itemid=74 |title=The Nameless City |publisher=Mythos Tomes |accessdate=2013-08-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In "[[The Call of Cthulhu]]" (1926) it is the supposed base of the Cthulhu Cult. Lovecraft and other Cthulhu Mythos authors have settled on the spelling ''Irem''.
* "Wabar" appears in [[Josephine Tey]]'s mystery novel ''The Singing Sands'' (1952), in which detective Alan Grant seeks to unravel the meaning of a strange poem found on the body of a young man. Wabar is one possible subject of the poem.
* Iram is the theme of [[Daniel Easterman]]'s novel ''The Seventh Sanctuary'' (1987).
* In [[Tim Powers]]' supernatural novel ''[[Declare]]'' (2001), Wabar was a city inhabited by [[djinni]] and their half-human progeny, and was destroyed by a meteor strike.
* [[James Rollins]]' novel ''Sandstorm'' (2004) depicts Ubar as an underground city in a glass bubble with a lake of antimatter at the middle. The city, which was created as the result of a [[meteorite impact]] 20,000 years ago, is destroyed and becomes a massive lake known as Lake Eden.
* In [[Washington Irving]]'s book ''Tales of the Alhambra'' (1832) &lt;ref&gt;http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/i/irving/washington/i72a/part22.html&lt;/ref&gt; Legend of the Arabian Astrologer; "You have  heard, O king, have you not, of the Garden of Irem, one of the prodigies of Arabia the happy." "I have heard of that garden; it is recorded in the Koran, even in the chapter entitled 'The Dawn of Day.' I have, moreover, heard marvellous things related of it by pilgrims who had been to Mecca; but I considered them wild fables, such as travellers are wont to tell who have visited remote countries."

* Bayard Taylor's poem ''The Garden of Irem'' &lt;ref&gt;https://www.poetrynook.com/poem/garden-irem&gt;The Garden of Irem&lt;/ref&gt;    Bayard Taylor and Washington Irving were acquaintances.

===Video games===
* In the video game ''[[Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception]]'', it is postulated that [[Sir Francis Drake]] made a detour here during his circumnavigation of the world and covered up all evidence of his voyage and the accursed lost city of Ubar, until hero Nathan Drake and an evil, shadowy secret society rediscover the city 500 years later.
* In the video game ''[[Sunless Sea]]'', a creation of [[Failbetter Games]], Iram (here spelled "Irem") was brought into the vast cavern beneath the earth where the game is set, and can be visited and explored by the protagonist. Its characteristic pillars are present in great quantity, and it maintains the warmth of its original environment even far from the sun.
*In the video game ''[[Fallout 4]]'', Ubar is mentioned in the journal of Lorenzo Cabot. He describes his journey to what he believes to be Ubar.
*In the video game ''[[80 Days (2014 video game)|80 Days]]'', the player playing as Phileas Fogg could potentially encounter a Bedouin Expedition in the Rub' Al Khali desert, looking for the fabled lost city of Iram.
*In the video game ''[[League of Legends]]'', the fictional city of Icathia is loosely based on Iram, and its subsequent use in the works of H.P. Lovecraft.

===Tabletop role-playing games===
* In the [[World of Darkness|Chronicles of Darkness]] game line, ''[[Mummy: The Curse]]'', published by [[Onyx Path Publishing|White Wolf Game Studios-Onyx Path]], Irem is the [[Stone Age]] city where the game's protagonists, the Arisen, were created.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}
* In the Classic World of Darkness game line, specifically ''[[Vampire: The Masquerade]]'', Ubar is believed by some to be the First City, Enoch, where the first vampire, [[Cain]]e, became king over the mortals residing in the city. It is also here where he made his first progeny, the Second Generation, and where they created their progeny, the [[Antediluvians (World of Darkness)|Antediluvians]].

'''Josef Kajetán Tyl Theatre''' ({{lang-cs|Divadlo Josefa Kajetána Tyla}}) is a main theatre in [[Plzeň]], Czech Republic. The theatre was built between 1899–1902 in the [[neo-renaissance]] style with some [[art nouveau]] elements to the design of [[Antonin Balsanek]]. Every year the theatre performs some 18 premieres of drama, operas, operettas, ballets or musicals. Since September 2014, actors of the theatre also perform at the [[New Theatre (Plzeň)|New Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pilsen.eu/tourist/information/news/the-theatre-in-pilsen-has-a-lot-to-offer-to-foreigners-as-well.aspx|title=The theatre in Pilsen has a lot to offer to foreigners as well|publisher=pilsen.eu|date=n.d.|accessdate=16 November 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141116152243/http://www.pilsen.eu/tourist/information/news/the-theatre-in-pilsen-has-a-lot-to-offer-to-foreigners-as-well.aspx|archivedate=16 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''A Campingflight to Lowlands Paradise''' ('''Lowlands'''), is an annual three-day [[music festival|music and performing arts festival]], held in the [[Netherlands]]. The festival is held {{convert|68|km}} east of [[Amsterdam]] in [[Biddinghuizen]], at Spijk en Bremerberg, which is adjacent to [[Walibi Holland]].

Although the main focus is on music - [[Rock music|rock]], [[Pop music|pop]], [[Dance music|dance]], [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] and [[alternative rock|alternative]] - Lowlands also offers indoor and outdoor [[film|cinema]], [[street theatre|(street)]] [[theatre]], [[cabaret]] and [[stand-up comedy|stand-up]], [[ballet]], [[literature]] and [[comic strip]]s.

==Description==
The festival is a successor to one of the very first Dutch pop festivals: ''A Flight to Lowlands Paradise'' that was organised in November 1967 by the Utrecht-based artist and painter Bunk Bessel. This festival took place in the Margriethal of [[Jaarbeurs]] [[Utrecht]]. The entry fee was 10 [[Dutch guilder]]s (approximately 4.50 euros), including breakfast. This 18-hour-long event had no top acts but included experimental theatre, dancing, poetry, films, body painting and massage. The Utrecht municipality did not pay up the promised subsidy of 8,000 guilders after the event.

On 28 December 1968, this festival was held a second time, postponed by a month from its original date of 23 November to try to get [[Jimi Hendrix]] to attend the event. This could not be arranged, and other large acts such as [[Jeff Beck]] and [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]] were cancelled. However, [[Pink Floyd]] remained on the bill. In the end, the show was sold out to its capacity of 18,000 visitors, and for many people it was a cold and disappointing experience as they were unable to get inside. There was unrest and the police had to be involved.

In 1993, organizer Willem Venema revived this festival under the name "A Campingflight to Lowlands Paradise". The festival is attended by around 55,000 visitors, spread over 200 acts and more than ten stages every year which are named according to the [[NATO phonetic alphabet]] apart from the Grolsch stage (named after the beer brewer [[Grolsch Brewery|Grolsch]] who has been the main sponsor of the festival for the last few years). The majority of stages are inside huge tents - insurance against the Netherlands climate - with the main stage's tent, Alpha, being approximately the size of a regulation football pitch.

[[Life of Agony]] released a CD of their unplugged set from the Lowlands Festival in 1997, entitled ''[[Unplugged at the Lowlands Festival '97]]''.

The '''MV ''Maersk Tigris''''' is a Marshall Islands registered [[container ship]]. Completed in 2014, the ship is {{convert|255|m|ft}} long, {{convert|37|m|ft}} wide and weighs 52600 tonnes.&lt;ref name=ShipInfo&gt;{{cite web|title=Maersk Tigris - Container Ship|url=http://www.marinetraffic.com/ais/details/ships/9694581|website=MarineTraffic|accessdate=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2015 seizure==
On 28 April 2015, the [[Navy of the Army of the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution|Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps Navy]] intercepted and seized the ship while it was transiting through Iranian territorial waters via the [[Strait of Hormuz]]. An initial instruction by the [[Navy of the Army of the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution|IRGC Navy]] to the MV Maersk Tigris to proceed further into Iranian territorial waters was not complied with, after which the Iranian Navy fired a warning shot across the bridge of the ship. The ship was then taken into Iranian custody. Given that the vessel is flagged under the [[Marshall Islands]], which the [[United States]] bears security responsibility for, the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] dispatched the destroyer [[USS Farragut (DDG-99)|USS ''Farragut'']] after receiving a distress call from the ''Maersk Tigris''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=28 April 2015 |title=U.S. dispatches destroyer after Iran boards commercial ship |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-dispatches-destroyer-after-iran-boards-commercial-ship/2015/04/28/56ef48c2-edc6-11e4-a55f-38924fca94f9_story.html |newspaper=The Washington Post }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vessel's charterer, the Danish shipping company [[Maersk]], said Iran's seizure of a commercial vessel engaged in innocent passage through Iran's territorial waters in the internationally recognized shipping lane of the Strait of Hormuz was illegal. Maersk said it presumed the ship was detained because of an ongoing court case between [[Maersk Line]] and an Iranian company, but that Iran erred not only by failing to engage in normal protocol for arresting a ship, but by seizing property and personnel that do not belong to Maersk. The ship is chartered by Maersk Line and Maersk owns the ship's containers, but the ship itself is owned by Wide Golf Ltd., registered in [[Luxembourg]], and is managed by Singapore-based Rickmers Shipmanagement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=30 April 2015 |title=Maersk accuses Iran of illegally intercepting ship |url=http://www.ihsmaritime360.com/article/17711/update-maersk-accuses-iran-of-illegally-intercepting-ship |agency=IHS Maritime }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 April 2015, Maersk said it had been informed by the Iranian Ports and Maritime Organization that an Iranian court had ordered it to pay $3.6 million in compensation to an Iranian company for the loss of 10 of its containers Maersk Line had shipped to Dubai in January 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=30 April 2015 |title=Iran to release seized Maersk vessel after 'debt settled' |url=https://news.yahoo.com/maersk-urges-iran-release-crew-held-over-cargo-004353470.html |agency=AFP}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2015, an appeals court in Tehran ordered Maersk Line to pay the Iranian company $163,000. The Iranian company then appealed the case, seeking more money, which led to the $3.6 million judgment. Maersk said it had only learned on April 30 of the Iranian appeals court $3.6 million ruling, but that it had "not received any written or formal confirmation that the seizure and the cargo case are connected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=30 April 2015 |title=Iran’s Cargo Ship Seizure Tied to a $3.6 Million Court Judgment |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-04-30/iran-s-cargo-ship-seizure-tied-to-a-3-6-million-court-judgment |agency=Bloomberg News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to maritime consultant William Watson, when an entity has a financial claim against a vessel's owners, the claimant can arrest the vessel when it is in port or at anchor. But in his decades in the maritime industry, he had never seen such a seizure carried on [[International waters|open seas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=28 April 2015 |title=Here’s Why Iran's Seizure of a Cargo Ship Is So Odd, and Disturbing |url=http://www.defenseone.com/threats/2015/04/heres-why-irans-seizure-cargo-ship-so-odd-and-disturbing/111319/ |agency=Defense One }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 May 2015, Iran released the ''Maersk Tigris''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=7 May 2015 |title=Operator of cargo ship seized by Iran says vessel released |url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/860b51ad0c004ff492f4a0977345912d/iran-releases-seized-maersk-vessel |agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Synopsis ==
[[File:Mayerling-characters.jpg| thumb | Characters from Kenneth MacMillan's Mayerling, via [http://www.theballetbag.com/2009/06/22/mayerling/ The Ballet Bag]]]

''Prologue: The cemetery at [[Heiligenkreuz, Lower Austria|Heiligenkreuz]] before dawn''

===Act I===

''Scene 1: The ballroom at the [[Hofburg Palace]], Vienna''

A ball to celebrate the marriage of [[Crown Prince Rudolf|Crown Prince Rudolf of Austria-Hungary]] and [[Princess Stéphanie of Belgium|Princess Stephanie of Belgium]] is in full swing. Rudolf flirts shamelessly with Stephanie's sister, [[Princess Louise of Belgium|Princess Louise]], offending both his new bride and his parents, [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Emperor Franz Josef]] and [[Empress Elisabeth of Austria|Empress Elisabeth]]. Rudolf meets [[Countess Marie Larisch von Moennich|Countess Marie Larisch]], a former mistress, and Baroness Vetsera. The Baroness introduces her 17-year-old daughter [[Baroness Mary Vetsera|Mary Vetsera]]. Four Hungarian officers, friends of Rudolf, enter and forcefully argue the separatist cause of their country. Countess Larisch tries to rekindle her relationship with Rudolf. The pair are discovered by the Emperor, who demands that Rudolf return to his wife.

''Scene 2: The Empress’s apartments at the Hofburg''

Having retired from the ball, Empress Elisabeth is being attended by her ladies-in-waiting. Rudolf visits his mother, on his way to his new bride. He expresses his deep unhappiness at being pressured into marriage. Desperate for maternal affection he tries to embrace the Empress, only to be coldly rebuffed.

''Scene 3: Rudolf’s apartments at the Hofburg''

Princess Stephanie is getting ready for her wedding night. Rudolf enters and threatens Stephanie with a revolver before making love to her.

===Act II===

''Scene 1: A notorious tavern''

Rudolf and Stephanie enter the tavern in disguise. They are accompanied by Rudolf's driver Bratfisch, who attempts to lighten Stephanie’s spirits. Prostitutes compete for the men’s attention and Stephanie flees the tavern in disgust. Rudolf turns his attention to his Hungarian friends and his regular mistress, the courtesan [[Mizzi Kaspar]]. The police burst in and Rudolf, Mitzi and the Hungarian officers hide. The police arrest several people before leaving. In a despairing mood, Rudolf proposes a suicide pact to Mitzi. The Prime Minister [[Eduard Taaffe, 11th Viscount Taaffe|Count Taaffe]] enters the tavern, looking for Rudolf. Rudolf hides again but Mitzi tells the Count where he is hidden. The Count and Mitzi leave together.

''Scene 2: Outside the tavern''

Countess Larisch, ostensibly chaperoning Mary, presents the young girl to Rudolf as he leaves the tavern.

''Scene 3: The Vetsera house''

Countess Larisch calls on her friend Baroness Vetsera. She finds Mary absorbed by a portrait of Rudolf. Countess Larisch tells Mary’s fortune using a pack of cards and informs her that her romantic dreams will come true. Mary gives the Countess a letter to deliver to Rudolf on her behalf.

''Scene 4: The Hofburg''

During the Emperor's birthday celebrations Count Taaffe confronts Rudolph over an incriminating political pamphlet on the Hungarian cause. [[Bay Middleton|Colonel ‘Bay’ Middleton]] hands the Count a joke cigar, to Rudolf's intense amusement. The Empress presents the Emperor with a portrait of his 'friend' [[Katharina Schratt|Katherina Schratt]]. A firework display distracts everyone except the Empress and ‘Bay.’ Rudolf notices their amorous exchange and becomes bitterly resentful. Countess Larisch produces Mary’s letter and teases Rudolf with it.

''Scene 5: Rudolf’s apartments at the Hofburg''

Mary and Rudolf meet in secret for the first time.

===Act III===

''Scene 1: A royal shoot in the countryside''

During a hunting expedition, Rudolf unaccountably shoots wildly. He kills a member of the court, narrowly missing his father.

''Scene 2: Rudolf’s apartments at the Hofburg''

The Empress discovers Countess Larisch and Rudolf alone together and angrily dismisses the Countess, unaware Mary is waiting outside. Mary enters after the Empress has left. Rudolf asks her to commit suicide with him.

''Scene 3: The hunting lodge at [[Mayerling]]''

Rudolf shares a drink with Count Hoyos and [[Prince Philipp of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Prince Philipp of Coburg]], attended by his valet Loschek. He asks them to leave, saying he is unwell. Bratfisch enters with Mary. Rudolf instructs Bratfisch to entertain him and Mary. Bratfisch, soon realizing he has lost their attention, leaves. In a mounting frenzy Rudolf makes love to Mary. He injects himself with morphine to calm his nerves and embraces Mary for the last time. He shoots her. Loschek, Hoyos and Philipp rush in, having heard the shot. Rudolf reassures them and instructs them to leave. Alone, he shoots himself. His friends rush in again, and collapse in despair when they find Rudolf's dead body.

''Epilogue: The cemetery at Heiligenkreuz before dawn''

== Original production ==
Mayerling was first produced for the [[Royal Ballet]] in 1978, by the British choreographer [[Sir Kenneth Macmillan]], with a scenario written by [[Gillian Freeman]],&lt;ref&gt;Gillian Freeman, 'The making of Mayerling', in ''The Times'', Wednesday 8 February 1978, p. 9, column B.&lt;/ref&gt; scenery and costume designs by [[Nicholas Georgiadis]] and lighting design by David Hersey.  Music for the ballet was compiled from existing works by [[Franz Liszt]], arranged and orchestrated by [[John Lanchbery]] who also conducted the orchestra during the ballet's first season.  The ballet was dedicated to the Royal Ballet's founder choreographer [[Sir Frederick Ashton]] and premiered at the [[Royal Opera House]], London, on 14 February 1978.  The Royal Opera House collections have archive information from twelve performances of this ballet, including the premiere and subsequent revivals.&lt;ref name="rohcollections1"&gt;http://www.rohcollections.org.uk/production.aspx?production=4585&amp;row=0&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rohcollections1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rohcollections.org.uk/performance.aspx?performance=11760&amp;row=0 |title=Ballet: Performance details |publisher=Rohcollections.org.uk |accessdate=26 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical reception===
The original production was, in general, well received by critics, however there were some reservations. Many reviewers found the ballet overly long and the historical background of the story difficult to follow. However, Mary Clarke in the ''Guardian'' defended the complexity of the work: "Easy, after one or two viewings, to say this or that scene must go. But patience and understanding bring rewards; every scene tells something about Rudolf and the Court of Vienna in his time."&lt;ref&gt;Different Drummer: The Life of Kenneth MacMillan by Jann Parry (2009), p.490.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Mountain Jam was originally conceived to celebrate the 25th anniversary of [[WDST-FM|WDST/Radio Woodstock]]. More than 3,300 people attended the initial one-day event in 2005, reviews of which were overwhelmingly positive.&lt;ref&gt;http://blogs.hudsonvalley.com/good-stuff/2014/06/04/tenth-annual-mountain-jam-begins/&lt;/ref&gt; The founders, including [[Warren Haynes]], Gary Chetkof and members of Radio Woodstock, decided to make the event annual.&lt;ref name="WHInterview"&gt;http://ultimateclassicrock.com/warren-haynes-interview-2013/&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, the festival has grown to include a diverse lineup of smaller artists, as well as large acts including [[Michael Franti|Michael Franti and Spearhead]], [[Widespread Panic]], [[The Black Keys]] and [[The Allman Brothers Band]]. [[Gov't Mule]], the band Haynes co-founded, performed at every Mountain Jam until 2016.

==Venue==
Mountain Jam's three stages allow for continuous music each day. The East Stage is the largest, overlooking the main terrain of the resort. Adjacent to the East Stage is the West Stage, near the resort's chair lift; and Inside the Base Lodge a third stage is set up for late night acts and musicians who require indoor amenities.
Amenities for event goers include a tent camping area in the Hunter One section of the resort and RV camping farther up the mountain. Various hotels also serve the town year-round, and the Kaatskill Mountain Club hotel and Liftside Condominiums are both within walking distance of the festival.

Some years have seen non-stop rain for almost the entire duration of the festival,&lt;ref&gt;http://liveforlivemusic.com/show-reviews/mountain-jam-ix-review-there-is-no-such-thing-as-bad-weather-only-bad-clothes/&lt;/ref&gt; while other events have had sunny and temperate weather.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mountainjam.com/amazing-weather-for-10th-mountain-jam/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-03-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402122115/http://mountainjam.com/amazing-weather-for-10th-mountain-jam/ |archivedate=2015-04-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Never at War: Why Democracies Will Not Fight One Another''''' is a book by the [[historian]] and [[physicist]] [[Spencer R. Weart]] published by [[Yale University Press]] in 1998. It examines political and military conflicts throughout human history and finds no exception to one of the claims made by the controversial [[democratic peace theory]]: well-established [[liberal democracies]] have never made war on one another. In addition to the [[democracy|democratic]] peace, Weart argues that there is also an [[Oligarchy|oligarchic]] peace and provides a new explanation for both the democratic and oligarchic peace. The book is often mentioned in the academic debate and has received both praise and criticism.

== Sources ==
Due to the long time period, Weart has often relied on the works of other historians but has consulted at least five works for even trivial crises involving democracies and oligarchies. Some cases have never been studied with this question in mind and he has then used [[primary sources]] which included reading works in French, German (including [[Alemannic German]]), Italian (including the [[Tuscan dialect]]), Spanish, Greek and Latin.

== Definitions ==

The book classifies human societies into four broad groups:

:''[[Anocracy|Anocracies]]'' are societies where central authority is weak or nonexistent. Kinship bonds extended by personal allegiances to notable leaders are the principal relations. A society may in theory be a state but if the above applies, then Weart classifies it as an anocracy. Examples include [[tribe]]s, [[Somalia]], and the medieval Italian cities where influential families fought street battles and lived in fortified [[keep]]s. Importantly, there is no central authority which can effectively restrain personal violence such as raids which often escalate by involving friends and relatives to [[vendettas]] and wars. Some anocratic tribes may have a form of democracy in the extended kinship group but no effective control of personal raids against non-kin groups. Examples include the [[Iroquois]] who frequently raided and eventually destroyed most of the [[Hurons]].

:''Autocracies'' are states where opposition against the current rulers is suppressed. There may be frequent shifts back and forth between anocracy and autocracy when a leader temporarily gains enough power to suppress all opponents in a territory.

:''Oligarchies'' are states where participation in government is restricted to an elite. Voting decides policy and opposition is accepted within the elite. Voting is usually restricted to less than 1/3 of the males. Examples include [[Sparta]] and the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]].

:''Democracies'' are states similar to oligarchies but there is not a sharp and clear distinction between an elite and the rest of the domestic population.  Usually, more than 2/3 of the males have the right to vote.

Looking at a borderline case, the [[Athenian democracy]] that excluded [[metic]]s and [[slavery|slave]]s, Weart argues that it was a democracy since appearance alone could not decide who was a citizen, citizens could become slaves and slaves could become free, citizens could be poorer than slaves, and slaves could work for example as bankers. The metics were even harder to tell from the citizens. Typically the citizens and the non-citizens worked alongside under similar conditions. Thus, the non-citizens were so interwoven through the community that their views were probably represented by the citizens on most issues. Some aspects of the [[direct democracy]] practiced in Athens may have been more open and democratic than the representative democracy used today. In contrast, the [[Confederate States of America]] was an oligarchy.

In order to help differentiate between oligarchies and democracies, Weart requires that the classification should not differ from how the people at the time viewed the differences, the oligarchic elite should live in constant fear of a rebellion, and for democracies a war should not have been prevented if everyone had the vote. For example, it was the Greeks who first created the concepts of democracy and oligarchy and they classified Athens as a democracy while Sparta was an oligarchy. There is no mention in the historical record of fears of a revolt by the slaves in Athens, but such fears were frequent in Sparta and the Confederate States.

Weart uses a broader definition of war than is usual in research on the democratic peace theory and includes any conflict causing at least 200 deaths in organized battle by political units against one another. He requires that the democracies and the oligarchies should have tolerated dissent for at least 3 years, finding this time necessary for a political culture in a nation to change and be reflected in foreign policy.

== Results ==
Using these definitions, Weart finds numerous wars between the same and different kinds of societies but also two exceptions. Democracies have never fought one another and oligarchies have almost never fought one another. Wars between democracies and oligarchies have, however, been common.

The book argues that the pattern is sharply evident in for example 300 years of [[Ancient Greek]] history, the Swiss [[Cantons of Switzerland|Cantons]] since the 14th century, in the [[County of Flanders]] during the 14th century, in the three and a half centuries of the [[Hanseatic League]], and in [[Renaissance]] Italy. These periods included numerous societies that frequently changed regime type. The societies abruptly stopped fighting other oligarchies if they became an oligarchy and abruptly stopped fighting other democracies if they became a democracy. This pattern immediately reversed if the regime type changed again.

Weart argues that the only clear case of war between oligarchies is a 1656 battle between [[Bern]] and [[Lucerne]], caused by religious fervor during the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]. The [[War of the Pacific]] may be another, but both [[Chile]] and [[Peru]] had strong anocratic tendencies where family and personal loyalty formed much of the power base of the leaders. Toleration of political dissent was at best limited.

Democracies have a few times issued formal declarations of war on other democracies, usually because of a war between a temporary allied nondemocracy and the other democracy. In these cases the democracies have carefully avoided engaging in almost any real battle with one another. There seems to have been almost no deaths during the 369–362 BC war between [[Thebes (Greece)|Thebes]] and [[Athens]], while at the same time Sparta and Thebes fought numerous bloody battles. In the main battle in 362 BC, the Athenian infantry avoided joining the charge. Finland and the United Kingdom carefully avoided attacking one another during World War II despite a formal declaration of war.

== Explanation ==
Weart's explanation for the democratic and the oligarchic peace is the human tendency to classify other humans into [[ingroup]] and [[Ingroups and outgroups|outgroup]], documented in many psychological studies. Members of the outgroup are seen as inherently inferior and thus exploitation of them is justified. Citizens of democracies include citizens of other democratic states in the ingroup; the elites of oligarchies include the elites of other oligarchies in the ingroup. However, the oligarchic elites and the democratic citizens view each other as outgroup, democracies viewing the elites as exploiting the rest of the population, the oligarchic elites viewing democracies as governed by inferior men and are afraid that the democratic ideals may spread to their state.

The democratic and oligarchic peace are also strengthened by the culture of arbitration and the respect for the ingroup opposition in both democracies and oligarchies. Similar policies are applied to foreign policy when dealing with states belonging to the ingroup. In contrast, the leaders of autocracies are the survivors of a culture of violence against opponents. They use similar methods when dealing with other states which often cause wars. The book presents earlier statistical studies and [[case studies]] showing that democracies and oligarchies conduct [[diplomacy]] very differently from autocracies. Weart argues against explanations like more trade between democracies, finding the pattern to change too abruptly for this to be the case.

Earlier democracies and oligarchies did not include non-Europeans in the ingroup, perceiving them to be racially inferior people living in autocracies and anocracies. This allowed [[Colonialism|colonial]] and [[imperialistic]] wars and exploitation.

The book also describes an "appeasement trap". The autocratic leaders misunderstand the conciliatory methods used by democracies and oligarchies, seeing it as an admission of weakness that can be exploited with little risk. When the conciliatory methods are suddenly abandoned and the war arrives the autocratic leaders are often surprised and then conclude that the other side planned the war from the beginning.

== Specific conflicts ==
Most of the book describes specific conflicts that are borderline cases where critical features might be expected to show up. The following presents some of the conflicts mentioned and Weart's arguments for why they are not wars between well-established liberal democracies.
* [[American Revolutionary War]]. The United States can be considered a liberal democracy after the [[Continental Congress]] but was less than three years old. The monarchy under [[George III]] was still the final arbiter of British policy in such matters as the appointment of colonial officials and the power to declare wars. The franchise was restricted to a small minority.&lt;ref&gt;Weart, 1998, p. 304–305.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Quasi-War]]. Less than 200 battle deaths: a few dozen. The franchise in the [[French Directory]] was restricted to a minority of wealthy Frenchmen. In 1797 there was a [[coup d'état]] which used troops against the opposition, closed down opposing newspapers, cancelled election results, and condemned hundreds of opponents to exile or death.&lt;ref&gt;Weart, 1998, p. 305–306.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[War of 1812]]. The franchise in the United States was denied to African-Americans and Women. The British prince regent still retained the final word on ministers and war. Open criticism was punishable as [[lèse majesté]] and dissidents were driven into exile. The franchise was restricted to a small minority.&lt;ref&gt;Weart, 1998, p. 135–138, 184–186, 306.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Trail of Tears]]. The Cherokees had created a republican constitution in 1827 that in theory had many democratic rights. However, the nation allowed slaveholding and became increasingly authoritarian, in the end beating, censoring and even murdering those advocating a voluntary removal. The state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] decreed that the government was dissolved in 1828 which was before three years had passed since the creation of the constitution. No battle deaths.&lt;ref&gt;Weart, 1998, p. 225–226, 306–07.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Mexican–American War]]. Mexican President [[Mariano Paredes (President of Mexico)|Mariano Paredes]] was a general who took power in a [[coup d'état]].&lt;ref&gt;Weart, 1998, p. 201-204, 207, 214&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Sonderbund]] War. Less than 200 battle deaths: fewer than a hundred. Democracy was less than 3 years old in [[Zürich]] which was the leading Protestant [[Cantons of Switzerland|Canton]]. The Catholic Cantons restricted the suffrage to Catholic men and in many also to a group that descended from the original inhabitants. The Protestants and liberals attempted a rebellion in Catholic [[Lucerne]] but were defeated. Some fled what they called a Catholic "reign of terror". Lucerne announced that [[Jesuits]] would be responsible for the educational system. This was perceived as evidence that Lucerne was now a regime under the thumb of the autocratic Pope. A private expedition of volunteers tried to "liberate" Lucerne but failed. The perceptions of nondemocracy was strengthened when the Catholic Cantons refused to comply with the majority of the Swiss Federal Council and turned for aid to foreign Catholic powers like the [[Habsburgs]].&lt;ref&gt;Weart, 1998, p. 26–27, 309–310.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The war between the [[French Second Republic]] and the [[Roman Republic (19th century)]]. Both young democracies less than 3 years old. The Pope had promised to [[excommunicate]] those that took part in the elections, leaving only inexperienced radicals in the Roman government during the few months it existed. The French President and later [[Emperor]] [[Louis Napoleon]] needed support from the conservative Catholics and the military. The young French assembly was led to believe that the French expedition was a simple police action in order to restore order in a chaotic regime and to protect Rome from foreign monarchies that planned an intervention. The army officers on the scene distrusted everything republican and despite the unexpected resistance launched an attack and conquered Rome without a mandate from the French assembly. The news of this caused violent uprisings in France. The critics called the military repression of these "the Roman expedition into the interior".&lt;ref&gt;Weart, 1998, p. 156–160, 310–311.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Confederate States of America]] was less than 3 years old at the start of the war. Less than 2/3 of the adult male population could vote in the Confederacy. The state was created in order to continue the suppression of the black [[Slavery|slave]] population. Wealthy planters played on racial fears in order to avoid criticism from poor whites. [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]] were censored and imprisoned even before Lincoln was elected and he was not on the ballot in most parts of the South. In the first elections in the confederacy, voters in many areas again had no choice of candidates.&lt;ref&gt;Weart, 1998, p. 114–119, 311.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[War of the Pacific]]. Only one man in fifty could vote in [[Chile]] and [[Peru]].&lt;ref&gt;Weart, 1998, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[First Boer War]]. Britain was not a liberal democracy before [[Representation of the People Act 1884]]. The new Boer state was less than 3 years old and the Black population was excluded from the franchise.&lt;ref&gt;Weart, 1998, p. 307–308.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Spanish–American War]]. In Spain all males could vote and the constitution in theory protected many civil liberties. However, there was the [[Turno]] system where corrupt officials manipulated the elections to return to office as many of their own party as they wished, dissidents were jailed, the monarchy retained important powers, and a military [[coup d'état]] was feared if Spain would compromise in the negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;Weart, 1998, p. 141–42, 204–205, 311.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Fashoda Incident]]. No battle deaths.&lt;ref&gt;Weart, 1998, p. 311.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Philippine–American War]]. No democratic elections in the [[Philippines]]. The Philippine regime was less than 3 years old. One group of Filipinos had proclaimed a constitution which explicitly gave the power to a small group of landowners and professionals. [[Emilio Aguinaldo]] was declared president without elections. He was suspected of killing two of his main political rivals and nearly all foreign observers saw no chance for genuine self-government, but only different regional groups and bandits. US president [[William McKinley]] stated that it would be immoral to withdraw and leave the Filipinos to fight one another or be occupied by a European power.&lt;ref&gt;Weart, 1998, p. 207–210, 308–309.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Second Boer War]]. Only males from the minority White population had the right to vote in the Boer states. White [[Uitlanders]] were excluded from the franchise in [[South African Republic|Transvaal]].&lt;ref&gt;Weart, 1998, p. 124–128, 308.&lt;/ref&gt;
* World War I. The German [[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]] was elected by all adult males and it did vote overwhelmingly to fund the war. However, German [[Kaiser]] retained most of the power. All the appointments to bureaucracy, the armed forces, and the diplomatic forces were made at his sole discretion. It was common knowledge that the army strongly supported him and would arrest his opponents if he so desired. Open criticisms could be and were punished as [[lese majesty]]. The German [[Chancellor]] in 1913 ignored a [[vote of no confidence]], explaining that he served at the discretion of the Kaiser alone. The Reichstag was not consulted regarding the declaration of war, but only informed after the fact that its support was required to approve the allocation of funds for the defence against the Tsarist Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Weart, 1998, p. 142–145, 191–195, 311–312.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Anglo-Irish War]]. Weart's argument is that the Irish state was less than 3 years old. The initial violence involved rebels acting on their own outside democratic control. Later democratic control of the [[Irish Republican Army]] was doubtful and immediately after the war one part of the IRA tried to overthrow the government in the [[Irish Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;Weart, 1998, p. 312.&lt;/ref&gt; Although, in reality, the Irish war of independence had the popular support of 73 of Ireland's 103 Westminster [[Member of parliament#United Kingdom|Members of Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/easterrising/profiles/po18.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Occupation of the Ruhr]]. No battle deaths.&lt;ref&gt;Weart, 1998, p. 164–171, 312–313.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Continuation War]]. Eventually the United Kingdom reluctantly issued a formal [[declaration of war]] on Finland due to pressure from Soviet Union. Britain sent bombers to impede mining under German control but the British were not attacking Finns. The formal declaration meant nothing but some financial restrictions and the seizure of shipping.&lt;ref&gt;Weart, 1998, p. 313.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, Weart argues that Finland had become so authoritarian during the war that it was not a clear democracy anymore: it had imprisoned opposition leaders in a secret prison, and most decisions were taken by a tiny clique of leaders.&lt;ref&gt;Weart, 1998, p. 313.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Cod Wars]]. No battle deaths.&lt;ref&gt;Weart, 1998, p. 315.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Turkish Invasion of Cyprus]]. Initial hostilities after a [[coup d'état]] in Cyprus. Both the later formally democratic regime in Cyprus and that in Turkey were less than 3 years old. The military retained significant influence in both.&lt;ref&gt;Weart, 1998, p. 314–315.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Paquisha Incident]]. Both young democracies less than 3 years old. Lacking democratic control over the military on both nations. About two hundred battle deaths.&lt;ref&gt;Weart, 1998, p. 70, 316.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Crusade for democracy ==
Weart finds that nations have often tried to spread their political system to other nations. He finds many failed attempts to impose democracy by military intervention. For example, during the early part of the 20th century the United States sent soldiers to many nations in [[Central America]] in order to hold free elections, but with little long-term success. Those attempts that succeeded, like the [[occupied Japan]] after World War II, involved drastic change of the whole political culture. Weart argues that it is generally better to spread democracy by diplomacy and by slowly promoting internal political change.

==Criticisms==

Reviews of the book have ranged from positive&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allbusiness.com/public-administration/national-security-international/150135-1.html Never at war: why democracies will not fight one another. | Science &amp; Technology &gt; Experimentation &amp; Research from AllBusiness.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://dizzy.library.arizona.edu/ej/jpe/volume_8/501Allison.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://muse.jhu.edu/cgi-bin/access.cgi?uri=/journals/journal_of_interdisciplinary_history/v030/30.3mabe.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B00E4D91E3EF933A1575AC0A96E958260 Buddy System - New York Times&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/WEART.CHAP.HTM Never at War by Spencer Weart, Chapter 1&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/bpl/misr/1999/00000001/00000003/art00166 IngentaConnect The Never-Ending Story: Democracy and Peace&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; to negative.

===Statistically based critiques===

{{Main|Democratic peace theory#Statistical significance}}

One is that Weart makes no attempt to use [[statistics]] to prove that the findings are statistically significant. This would be very difficult to do if including all of human history. The many statistical studies on this subject have almost always limited themselves to the period after 1815. For this period there are prefabricated data sets available which lists for example all battle deaths for all nations. Weart instead uses a well-tried method often used by historians: comparative [[case studies]]. Especially by looking at many ambiguous cases it is possible to sift out a set of features that decide if a pair of [[regimes]] makes war or avoids it.

===Critiques of methodology===

{{Main|Democratic peace theory#Definitions, methodology and data}}

Some find Weart's use of sources questionable, in particular regarding the conflicts in [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]]: He excludes the earlier wars of [[Roman Republic|Rome]], including the [[Punic Wars]], stating that there are no [[primary sources]] and no reliable [[secondary sources]], for example by a historian who could understand [[Punic]], from [[Carthage]], making it impossible to determine the exact form of government at the start of these wars. Yet he uses [[Xenophon]] for other conflicts, who has also been doubted as a reliable source, although not for the same reason. Also, many modern classicists agree that Rome and Carthage were oligarchic republics, "which suggests that excluding them was a largely arbitrary judgment that just happened to leave Weart's central claim intact."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foreignaffairs.org/19990101fareviewessay959/stephen-m-walt/never-say-never-wishful-thinking-on-democracy-and-war.html Foreign Affairs - Never Say Never: Wishful Thinking on Democracy and War - Stephen M. Walt&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; However, Weart states that there have been some wars between oligarchies, so these wars would add to this list, not disprove his statement.

The [[Sicilian Expedition]] is sometimes mentioned as a war between somewhat democratic states. Some democratic peace researchers have excluded the states in Ancient Greece due to the limited franchise and the use of [[Sortition|allotment]] to select many government leaders. As noted earlier, Weart classifies Athens as a democracy and argues that this war was actually an example of a war between a democracy and an oligarchy. However, he also states "The possibility that the Athenians were wrong suggests a qualification to our rule. Instead of saying that well-established democracies do not make war on their own kind, perhaps we should say that they do not make war on other states they ''perceive'' to be democracies." Critics argue that there is no ancient evidence for this perception, and that the major source on Syracuse democracy is [[Thucydides]], the Athenian.&lt;ref&gt;(Response to Spencer Weart, Eric Robinson, Journal of Peace Research, Vol. 38, No. 5., Sep. 2001, p. 615-617)&lt;/ref&gt; Weart states [[Aristotle]] (an Athenian [[metic]]), the only scholar who ever possessed the documents required to study the constitution of Syracuse, carefully avoided calling Syracuse a democracy. One of the main reason for the [[Sicilian Expedition]] was that Syracuse was reported to have violent factional strife. Help from an inside group was essential since the Greeks lacked effective [[siege]] machinery and the expedition was ill-suited for the alternative long wait in order to starve the defenders. In every other known case when cities were betrayed to an Athenian army, it was by a democratic faction. Furthermore, scholars have argued that [[Thucydides]] had a distaste of democracy which affected his descriptions and evaluations. Weart's argument regarding the Sicilian Expedition is similar to the position of the prominent scholar [[G.E.M. de Ste. Croix]].

The same review also includes a list of possible wars between Greek oligarchies, including the recurrent wars between [[Sparta]] and [[Argos]]. Weart mentions these wars in a footnote with references where he states that Argos was a democracy.

===Alternate explanations for democratic peace===

{{Main|Democratic peace theory#Other explanations}}

JM Owen, in a generally friendly review, questions Weart's conclusion that universal democracy will mean lasting peace. If Weart's explanation for the democratic peace is true and this also depends on perception, then democratic leaders may misperceive each other as authoritarian. More seriously, if the outgroup of oligarchs disappears, what will prevent the democracies from dividing into a new ingroup and outgroup?&lt;ref&gt;(John M Owen IV, Never at War (review), Political Science Quarterly, Volume 114, Number 2, 1 July 1999, p. 335-336)&lt;/ref&gt;  (Weart later suggested there would be a tendency to promote an internal outgroup such as criminals, perverts, or terrorists.)

There are many other proposed explanations for the democratic peace. For example, a [[game-theoretic]] explanation for the democratic peace is that the public and the open debate in democracies send clear and reliable information regarding the intentions to other states. In contrast, it is difficult to know the intentions of nondemocratic leaders, what effect concessions will have, and if promises will be kept. Thus there will be mistrust and unwillingness to make concessions if at least one of the parties in a dispute is a nondemocracy.&lt;ref&gt;https://mitpress.mit.edu/journals/pdf/jeea_2_1_1_0.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Newberry Opera House''', located in [[Newberry, South Carolina]], is a fully restored historic building that is a live-performance space for popular artists, touring theatre companies, and local organizations.&lt;ref name = nrhpinv&gt;{{Cite web | last = Fant | first = Mrs. James W. | coauthor = | title =  Newberry Opera House | work = National Register of Historic Places - Nomination and Inventory | date = November 11, 1969 | url = http://www.nationalregister.sc.gov/newberry/S10817736001/S10817736001.pdf | format = pdf | accessdate = 27 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = scdah&gt;{{Cite web | title = Newberry Opera House, Newberry County (Boyce &amp; Nance Sts., Newberry)  | work = National Register Properties in South Carolina | publisher = South Carolina Department of Archives and History | url = http://www.nationalregister.sc.gov/newberry/S10817736001/index.htm | accessdate = 27 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1969.&lt;ref name = nris/&gt;

Designed in the French [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic style]], the first floor of the building was used by the town government for offices, a jail, and the fire company, which had one engine there.  The upper floor was designed as a theater and supporting spaces.  For years it attracted national touring companies, individual performers and a variety of theatre acts. It later was adapted also for use as a movie theater, but showed its last movie in 1952. It was restored beginning in 1998, in a project that included an addition to enable its use for full theatrical productions.

==History==
The building was designed in the French [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic style]] as both a place of entertainment and as a seat of government for the city. The building, completed in 1881 and dedicated in 1882, had a clock tower {{convert|130|ft|m}} topped with a [[garfish]] weather vane.

The original design called for the first floor to house the fire engine room, town council chambers, a clerk's office, a police officer, and three jail cells. The second floor contained a hall with 426 seats, 53 by {{convert|52|ft|m}} in size.  Also on this floor were a ticket office, a "green room", a cloakroom, and three dressing rooms. Drop curtains and seven scenes or sets for the stage were available. One scene, a landscape, survived to the late 20th century.

The Opera House quickly became known as "the entertainment center of the Midlands". Touring companies of [[New York City]] [[Play (theatre)|plays]], [[minstrel]] and [[variety shows]], famed vocalists and lecturers, magicians and mind readers, novelty acts and boxing exhibitions all were featured there. It was used not only by professional performers, but also by the community for meetings, dances, college commencement exercises, and musicals. Notable artists, such as [[Edwin Booth]], [[John Barrymore]] and his family, and [[Tallulah Bankhead]] are known to have performed there.

The first film shown there was ''[[Birth of a Nation]]'' (1915), a [[silent movie]], and others followed.  The early [[Thomas Edison|Edison]] "[[Talkies]]," using a [[phonograph]] record for sound, were introduced in the 1920s. Slowly, movies replaced the stage shows.  In the 1920s, the Opera House was remodeled as a movie theater.

In 1952, after the showing of ''[[The Outlaw]]'', the Opera House was closed as a movie theater.  During the movie era, the original horseshoe-shaped balcony was reduced in size, this restricted seating across the back of the auditorium to blacks only; the state had racial segregation in facilities. The city added an outdoor open stairway which they required blacks to use for entry. Since the mid-1960s, such public facilities have been integrated.

By 1959, there was talk about tearing the building down, but the hall was still used for community purposes, and the city used the first floor. In 1969, the [[Newberry Historical Society]] promoted the preservation of the Opera House, as did several other community groups. In 1970, the building was placed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].

After the City of Newberry vacated the building in the mid 1990s, the Newberry Opera House Foundation was established to assess restoration.  Recognizing the lack of performance spaces in the Midlands, it consulted with experts about a proposed project.  Since proceeding with a restoration plan, it has managed fundraising and operations of the facility, which it leases from the city.

The exterior restoration and window replacement was completed in 1994, and the interior renovation began in 1996. It included restoration of the horseshoe-shaped balcony.  An additional {{convert|10000|sqft|m2}} was added to the original building in order to create a full theatrical production facility: a new loading dock, an elevator, a second stage for rehearsal, and dressing rooms. The total cost of the renovation was approximately $5.5 million.  Architects for the renovation and addition were [http://www.cgdarch.com Craig Gaulden Davis] of Greenville, South Carolina.

A variety of theatrical touring companies and live-performance artists from [[Willie Nelson]] to [[Michael Bolton]], the Newberry Ballet Guild, South Carolina Opera Company and [[Asheville Lyric Opera]] have all performed there, keeping the hall busy. It has a maximum capacity of 426. It is also used for performances by Newberry College and other community institutions.

South Carolinians [[Josh Turner]], [[Edwin McCain]], [[Maurice Williams and the Zodiacs]], and [[Chubby Checker]] have all performed at the Newberry Opera House in recent years. [[The Charlie Daniels Band]], [[The Tams]], [[Art Garfunkel]], [[Arlo Guthrie]], [[Puddle of Mudd]] and [[Saliva (band)|Saliva]] (in 2018) have also performed at the Opera House in recent years.

The '''Norfolk Chamber Music Festival''', hosted in [[Norfolk, Connecticut]], is believed to be the oldest active summer [[music festival]] in [[North America]].  Set among the [[Litchfield Hills]] of the lower [[The Berkshires|Berkshires]], the Festival traces its roots to the Battell family who started hosting summer concerts on the Norfolk town green in the 1880s.   Now under the auspices of the Yale University School of Music, the Festival hosts more than 30 concerts each summer featuring professional performers and graduate music students from around the globe.  Among many others, guest performers and composers over the years have included the [[Tokyo String Quartet]], [[Percy Grainger]], [[Fritz Kreisler]], [[Midori Samson|Midori]], [[Pinchas Zukerman]], [[Dave Brubeck]], [[Jean Sibelius]] and [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]].  The Norfolk Festival has played an elemental role in the cultivation and development of [[classical music]] in America.  Today, with its history and setting, it continues to provide the [[New England]] experience with an offering of [[chamber music]].

==History==

Robbins Battell (1819–1895), the seventh son of a wealthy [[Norfolk, Connecticut|Norfolk, CT]] family, was a generous patron of music as well as a skilled amateur flutist and composer.   After graduating from [[Yale University]] in 1839, he returned to Norfolk to manage the family business enterprises. This reached [[New York City]] and beyond and generated a vast wealth that allowed him to become an important philanthropist. Passionate about the musical life of the community, he created a singing school and conducted concerts of the Litchfield County Musical Association in Norfolk and neighboring [[Winsted, Connecticut|Winsted]]. He conducted a performance of the [[Hallelujah Chorus]] to celebrate the centennial of the county in 1851. As a composer, he wrote hymns and choral arrangements, and set a great deal of poetry to music.  Robbins was also concerned about the economy of his home town. To attract visitors and tourists, he built a hotel and, beginning in the 1880s,  financed a week-long series of concerts on the green.  This concert series became what is now known as the Norfolk Festival.

Robbins’ daughter, Ellen (1851–1939), continued her father’s legacy of bringing music to Norfolk.   In 1895 she married Carl Stoeckel (1858–1925), son of Gustave Stoeckel, who was awarded the first Doctor of Music degree at Yale.  After their marriage, in memory of Ellen’s father, Robbins, Carl and Ellen started the Litchfield County Choral Union which continues to perform at the Norfolk Festival to this day.  Under Carl and Ellen, Norfolk soon became the first internationally known classical music festival in America. The Stoeckels assumed the entire expense of the concerts which took place on their estate. These concerts rapidly became extravagant affairs with parties and picnics and were among the most popular summer social events in New England. They recruited a 70-piece orchestra of musicians from the [[New York Philharmonic]] and [[Metropolitan Opera]], and paid for a special train to transport the instrumentalists to the Litchfield Hills.

In 1906, to accommodate the ever-growing crowds at the Festival, the couple built a [[concert hall]] known, then as now, as the Music Shed. Carl and Ellen Stoeckel’s philanthropy extended to presenting the festivals and concerts free of charge. They sought no public recognition for their role; Ellen listened to the concerts from a secluded window above the Music Shed stage while Carl quietly entered from the side and stood in the doorway. They commissioned new works from many of the leading composers of their time and invited them to conduct their own premieres. Sibelius, for example, composed his tone poem ''[[The Oceanides]]'' for the Stoeckels and conducted it in the Music Shed during his only trip to the United States on June 4, 1915.   The autograph manuscript is now in the Music Library at Yale University.

When Ellen Battell Stoeckel died in 1939 with no surviving children, she stipulated in her will that her estate was to be used in [[perpetuity]] for the “benefit and development of the School of Music of Yale University and for extending said University’s courses in music, art, and literature.”   The Yale Summer School of Music was established in 1941.  Since that time, the Norfolk Chamber Music Festival has played host to thousands of emerging young professional musicians.  Today the Festival offers intensive tuition-free programs each summer to approximately eighty students in chamber music, new music and choral repertoire.

==The Music Shed==
[[File:Shed1906exterior NCMFYale.jpg|thumb|Exterior of the music shed]]
Designed by New York architect, [[E.K. Rossiter]], the Music Shed existed first as a separate prototype structure modeled after [[Steinway Hall]] in New York.  A test concert was given in 1904.  The success of the experimental hall led to the construction of the Music Shed which was built for the Litchfield County Choral Union and opened in 1906.  The Shed had to be enlarged due to the number of chorus and audience members and, after an expansion in 1910, it could accommodate a chorus of 425 and an audience of 1,500. The Shed is built of [[Cedar wood|cedar]] and lined with [[redwood]] that was hand-picked and imported from [[California]].  The building’s extraordinary acoustics, not to mention the exquisite glow of its interior can be attributed to the redwood. Initially tickets were sold, but the Stoeckels eventually decided that events in the Music Shed would be by invitation only.  Movie stars, politicians, high society and professional musicians began to covet invitations from the prestigious Battells. By the beginning of the first world war, the Music Shed was one of the country’s most sought-out venues and a premier concert hall in New England.

An '''obscene phone call''', as the term is commonly used, is an unsolicited [[telephone]] call where a person derives [[sexual pleasure]] by using sexual or foul language to someone, who may be known to them or who may be a complete stranger.  (There are many varieties of consensual sexual phone calls.) Making [[obscene]] telephone calls for sexual pleasure is known as ''telephone scatologia'' and is considered a form of [[exhibitionism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= Dalby, J. T. |title= Is telephone scatologia a variant of exhibitionism? |journal = International Journal of Offend er Therapy and Comparative Criminology |year =1988 |volume = 32 |pages =45–49 |doi= 10.1177/0306624X8803200106}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is usually classed as a [[paraphilia]] from a psychiatric viewpoint, in the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM]] under the heading "Paraphilias Not Otherwise Specified". Related psychiatric terms (such as ''coprophonia'') were coined in Australia, the U.S., and Germany; most of the pertinent literature is North American.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last  = Janssen | first = D.F. | year = 2018 | title = “Telephone Scatologia”: Onomasiological and Historical Note | journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior | issn = 0004-0002 | doi=10.1007/s10508-018-1297-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the viewpoint of the recipient of the calls, obscene calls may be considered to be either a form of [[sexual harassment]] or a form of [[stalking]], or both.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://homepage.psy.utexas.edu/HomePage/Group/BussLAB/stalkinghelp.org/index.html|title=Buss Lab — Evolutionary Psychology at the University of Texas|website=homepage.psy.utexas.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minot.com/dvcc/stalking.html|title=What Is Stalking?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.self-help-sexuality.com/obscene-phone-call.html Obscene Phone Call],&lt;/ref&gt; In some US states, making obscene telephone calls is a [[misdemeanor|Class 1 Misdemeanor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title18.2/chapter9/section18.2-427/|title=§ 18.2-427.

Generally, unwilling recipients of obscene phone calls are advised to simply hang up on obscene callers, and to report the incident to the telephone company and/or the police.  Even when [[Caller ID]] is not shown, calls are logged by the telephone company, so the perpetrator's phone number can be discovered. However, many people who regularly engage in obscene phone calls use [[payphones]] or prepaid [[Mobile phone|cell phones]], and in these cases, a more extensive investigation is necessary.

The demographic that most commonly commits obscene phone calls ranges from the age of 12 to 16 years, with an average of 14 years of age.{{cn|date=August 2016}} Often they are emotionally or behaviorally maladjusted and have shown previous signs of [[sexual abuse]], as well as having already committed sexual abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= Saunders, E.

'''Oswald Tesimond''' (1563 – 23 August 1636) was a [[Jesuit]] born in either [[Northumberland]] or [[York]]&lt;ref name=spinks&gt;Henry Hawkes Spinks, Jr., ''The Gunpowder Plot and Lord Mounteagle's Letter'', Kessinger, 1902&lt;/ref&gt; who, while not a direct conspirator, had some knowledge of the [[Gunpowder Plot]] beforehand.

==Life==
He was educated in York, in the Royal School of William and Mary in the Horse Fayre,&lt;ref name=spinks/&gt; which cost no money to attend. [[Guy Fawkes]], [[Edward Oldcorne]] and brothers [[Christopher Wright (plotter)|Christopher]] and [[John Wright (Gunpowder Plot)|John Wright]] were among Tesimond's classmates, all of whom would become involved in the Gunpowder Plot. In 1580, at the age of seventeen, he entered [[English College in Rome]]. After three years of philosophy, Tesimond, with from the [[cardinal protector]], [[Giovanni Morone]] joined the [[Society of Jesus]] in April 1584.&lt;ref name=Morris&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=k489AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA143&amp;lpg=PA143&amp;dq=Oswald+Tesimond&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=SS3p6GCpUt&amp;sig=upXC71fuRtlznq0IS41nV1_n9qw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiwqN3p9JLdAhUBmlkKHcbrCUs4KBDoATACegQICBAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Oswald%20Tesimond&amp;f=false Morris, John. "Father Tesimond's Landing in England", ''The Troubles of Our Catholic Forefathers Related by Themselves'', Vol. 1, Burns and Oates, 1872]{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tesimond spent most of his adult life in Italy, under the name of Philip Beaumont, (Beamond, Bémont).&lt;ref name=Healey/&gt; Later, among other things, Tesimond studied theology in [[Messina]], where he afterwards taught philosophy. He was ordained, some time before he left on the English Mission, in November 1587. He arrived at [[Gravesend, Kent|Gravesend]] on 9 March 1598. Tesimond worked in England under the name "Father Greenway". For eight years he then worked with [[Edward Oldcorne]] in Worcestershire and [[Warwickshire]]. He was professed as a Jesuit on 28 October 1603.&lt;ref name=Morris/&gt;

He would later become somewhat involved in the [[Gunpowder Plot]]. He effectively documented his experiences in a narrative which he wrote sometime after. He lived the later part of his life in various places, including Saint-Omer and [[Naples]], where he died on 23 August 1636 at age 73.

==Gunpowder Plot==
{{main|Gunpowder Plot}}
Oswald Tesimond played a small role in the Gunpowder plot; while not directly involved, he knew of the plot from the confessional, and the motives of the conspirators. It is a near-certainty that the actual plot was divulged to Tesimond by [[Robert Catesby]], someone who was deeply involved. Tesimond, after gaining the knowledge, subsequently revealed the plot to his Jesuit superior, [[Henry Garnet]], in confession. Garnet judged that he had received this information under the seal of the confessional, and that canon law forbade him to repeat it,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jesuit.org.uk/gunpowder-plot-1605 "The Gunpowder Plot", The Jesuits in Britain]&lt;/ref&gt; but urged Tesimond to dissuade Catesby.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=4NYkDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA508&amp;lpg=PA508&amp;dq=Oswald+Tesimond&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=WRFP-w_BMA&amp;sig=uFJfBcyIn9WNXWo63OlXJasdSPc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwigtbfZ6ZLdAhWuwFkKHZPlAmY4HhDoATAIegQIABAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Oswald%20Tesimond&amp;f=false McCoog, S.J., Thomas M., ''The Society of Jesus in Ireland, Scotland, and England, 1598-1606'', BRILL, 2017, {{ISBN|9789004330689}}, p. 508]&lt;/ref&gt;

With the knowledge he possessed, Tesimond and Garnet decided to give religious consolations to the conspirators. They both did this despite the nature of the plot, which involved treason; obviously, their choice of keeping their knowledge secret constituted a violation of the law. He gave these consolations on 6 November 1605&lt;ref name=spinks/&gt; at [[Huddington]], after they had returned from London. 

Sir [[Edward Coke]] conducted the prosecution for the government – an easy one, since the conspirators had no legal representation – and through his speeches, presented the plot as a Jesuit conspiracy.{{sfn|McCoog, p. 509}} [[Thomas Wintour]], at his later execution, cleared all Jesuits (Tesimond specifically and most especially), from any involvement, counseling or advising regarding the plot.&lt;ref name=Healey&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=rQeNBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT1029&amp;lpg=PT1029&amp;dq=Oswald+Tesimond&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=mvRi6Vh8bz&amp;sig=isFKpVz6m2mM5w4-ee99ciDkTrw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwigtbfZ6ZLdAhWuwFkKHZPlAmY4HhDoATAHegQIAhAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Oswald%20Tesimond&amp;f=false Healey, Robin. "Tesimond, Oswald" (#7359), ''Italian Literature before 1900 in English Translation'', University of Toronto Press, 2011, {{ISBN|9781442658479}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flight==
Tesimond's arrest warrant was sworn out on 15 January 1606, describing him in detail: {{quotation|..of a reasonable stature, black hair, a brown beard cut close on the cheeks and left broad on the chin, somewhat long-visaged, lean in the face but of a good red complexion, his nose somewhat long and sharp at the end, his hands slender and long fingers, his body slender, his legs of a good proportion, his feet somewhat long and slender.|''excerpt from the proclamation for Tesimond's arrest''.}}

Tesimond was able to escape arrest. He evaded the constables of London, then made his way to safe houses in [[Essex]] and [[Suffolk]]. He then proceeded to sail to [[Calais]] among a cargo of dead pigs by passing as the owner of the load. He then went to [[Boulogne]], and then on to [[Saint-Omer]].&lt;ref name=Morris/&gt;

==Later life==
Tesimond, after escaping arrest, spent some years in Saint-Omer. He wrote a narrative based on the happenings of the Gunpowder Plot. Written in Italian, Tesimond's narrative probably comprises one of the most detailed and complete accounts of the plot itself. It may have been based on another Latin account of an unknown and unnamed secular priest. The narrative was sent to Rome to better inform the Jesuit authorities.&lt;ref name=Healey/&gt;

Later, from the year 1617, Tesimond was prefect of studies and consulter in [[Messina]]. He held this position there for many years, among time spent in Rome during the most of 1621, and among other minor occupations. After some time there, he moved to [[Naples|Naples, Italy]], where he would die in 1636. This was documented in a letter by Sir [[Edwin Rich (died 1675)|Edwin Rich]] to [[James I of England]], which warned the king against accepting any gift he might receive, which might consist of poisoned clothing from Tesimond; in England, vigilance was still elevated after the events that transpired following the Gunpowder Plot. {{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}

A '''prisoner of war''' ('''POW''') is a person, whether [[combatant]] or [[non-combatant]], who is held in custody by a [[belligerent]] power during or immediately after an [[armed conflict]]. The earliest recorded usage of the phrase "prisoner of war" dates to 1660.&lt;ref&gt;
Compare {{OEtymD|camouflage|accessdate=2017-10-28}} - "Captives taken in war have been called prisoners since mid-14c.; phrase prisoner of war dates from 1670s".
&lt;/ref&gt;

Belligerents hold prisoners of war in custody for a range of legitimate and illegitimate reasons, such as isolating them from enemy combatants still in the field (releasing and [[Repatriation|repatriating]] them in an orderly manner after hostilities), demonstrating military victory, punishing them, prosecuting them for [[war crime]]s, exploiting them for their labour, recruiting or even [[Conscription|conscripting]] them as their own combatants, collecting military and political intelligence from them, or [[Indoctrination|indoctrinating]] them in new political or religious beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ajol.info/index.php/smsajms/article/viewFile/42654/9522 |author=John Hickman |title=What is a Prisoner of War For |journal=Scientia Militaria |volume=36 |issue=2 |date=2008 |accessdate=14 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient times==
[[File:Abu-Simbel temple3.jpg|thumb|Engraving of [[Nubia]]n prisoners, [[Abu Simbel]], Egypt, 13th century BC]]
For most of human history, depending on the culture of the victors, enemy combatants on the losing side in a battle who had surrendered and been taken as a prisoner of war could expect to be either slaughtered or [[Slavery|enslaved]].&lt;ref&gt;Wickham, Jason (2014) The Enslavement of War Captives by the Romans up to 146 BC, University of Liverpool PhD Dissertation. {{cite web |url=http://repository.liv.ac.uk/17893/1/WickhamJ_May2014_17893.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150524213405/http://repository.liv.ac.uk/17893/1/WickhamJ_May2014_17893.pdf |archivedate=24 May 2015 |df=dmy-all }} Wickham 2014 notes that for Roman warfare the outcome of capture could lead to release, ransom, execution or enslavement.&lt;/ref&gt; The first Roman [[gladiator]]s were prisoners of war and were named according to their ethnic roots such as Samnite, Thracian, and the Gaul (Gallus).&lt;ref&gt;"[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/%7Egrout/encyclopaedia_romana/gladiators/gladiators.html The Roman Gladiator]", The University of Chicago.&lt;/ref&gt; Homer's ''[[Iliad]]'' describes Greek and Trojan soldiers offering rewards of wealth to opposing forces who have defeated them on the battlefield in exchange for mercy, but their offers are not always accepted; see [[Lycaon (Troy)|Lycaon]] for example.

Typically, little distinction was made between enemy combatants and enemy civilians, although women and children were more likely to be spared. Sometimes, the purpose of a battle, if not a war, was to capture women, a practice known as ''[[raptio]]''; the [[Rape of the Sabines]] was a large mass abduction by the founders of Rome. Typically women had no [[women's rights|rights]], and were held legally as [[Personal property|chattel]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nwhp.org/resources/womens-rights-movement/history-of-the-womens-rights-movement/|title=History of the Women's Rights Movement|last=|first=|date=|website=www.nwhp.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fourth century AD, Bishop [[Acacius of Amida]], touched by the plight of Persian prisoners captured in a recent war with the Roman Empire, who were held in his town under appalling conditions and destined for a life of slavery, took the initiative of ransoming them, by selling his church's precious gold and silver vessels, and letting them return to their country. For this he was eventually canonized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CHURCH FATHERS: Church History, Book VII (Socrates Scholasticus)|url = http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/26017.htm|website = www.newadvent.org|accessdate = 2015-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Middle Ages and Renaissance==

During [[Childeric I|Childeric]]'s siege and blockade of Paris in 464, the nun [[Geneviève]] (later canonised as the city's patron saint) pleaded with the Frankish king for the welfare of prisoners of war and met with a favourable response. Later, [[Clovis I]] liberated captives after Genevieve urged him to do so.&lt;ref name="Attwater"&gt;Attwater, Donald and Catherine Rachel John. ''The Penguin Dictionary of Saints''. 3rd edition. New York: Penguin Books, 1993. {{ISBN|0-14-051312-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many French prisoners of war were killed during the [[Battle of Agincourt]] in 1415.&lt;ref&gt;"But when the outcries of the lackies and boies, which ran awaie for feare of the Frenchmen thus spoiling the campe came to the kings eares, he doubting least his enimies should gather togither againe, and begin a new field; and mistrusting further that the prisoners would be an aid to his enimies, or the verie enimies to their takers in deed if they were suffered to live, contrarie to his accustomed gentleness, commended by sound of trumpet, that everie man (upon pain and death) should uncontinentlie slaie his prisoner. When this dolorous decree, and pitifull proclamation was pronounced, pitie it was to see how some Frenchmen were suddenlie sticked with daggers, some were brained with pollaxes, some slaine with malls, others had their throats cut, and some their bellies panched, so that in effect, having respect to the great number, few prisoners were saved." : [[Raphael Holinshed]]'s ''Chronicles of England, Scotland and Ireland'', quoted by Andrew Gurr in his introduction to {{cite book |last1 = Shakespeare  |first1 = William  |last2 = Gurr  |first2 = Andrew  |title = King Henry V  |publisher = Cambridge University Press  |year = 2005  |page = 24  |isbn = 0-521-84792-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was done in retaliation for the French killing of the boys and other non-combatants handling the baggage and equipment of the army, and because the French were attacking again and Henry was afraid that they would break through and free the prisoners to fight again.

In the later [[Middle Ages]], a number of [[religious war]]s aimed to not only defeat but eliminate their enemies. In Christian Europe, the extermination of [[Heresy|heretics]] was considered desirable. Examples include the 13th century [[Albigensian Crusade]] and the [[Northern Crusades]].&lt;ref&gt;"History of Europe'', p. 362–by [[Norman Davies]] {{ISBN|0-19-520912-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked by a Crusader how to distinguish between the Catholics and [[Cathars]] once they'd taken the city of [[Béziers]], the Papal Legate [[Arnaud Amalric]] famously replied, "''[[Caedite eos. Novit enim Dominus qui sunt eius|Kill them all, God will know His own]]''".&lt;ref&gt;According to the ''Dialogus Miraculorum'' by [[Caesarius of Heisterbach]], Arnaud Amalric was only ''reported'' to have said that.&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise, the inhabitants of conquered cities were frequently massacred during the [[Crusades]] against the [[Muslim]]s in the 11th and 12th centuries. [[Noblemen]] could hope to be [[ransom]]ed; their families would have to send to their captors large sums of wealth commensurate with the social status of the captive.

In feudal Japan there was no custom of ransoming prisoners of war, who were for the most part summarily executed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/journal_of_japanese_studies/v031/31.2lamers.html Samurai, Warfare and the State in Early Medieval Japan], The Journal of Japanese Studies&lt;/ref&gt;

The expanding [[Mongol Empire]] was famous for distinguishing between cities or towns that surrendered, where the population were spared but required to support the conquering Mongol army, and those that resisted, where their city was [[Destruction under the Mongol Empire|ransacked and destroyed]], and all the population killed. In [[Termez]], on the [[Oxus]]: ''"all the people, both men and women, were driven out onto the plain, and divided in accordance with their usual custom, then they were all slain"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://faculty.washington.edu/modelski/CAWC.htm |title=Central Asian world cities |publisher=Faculty.washington.edu |date=29 September 2007 |accessdate=14 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118121401/https://faculty.washington.edu/modelski/CAWC.htm |archivedate=18 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Aztec]]s were constantly at war with neighbouring tribes and groups, with the goal of this constant [[Aztec warfare|warfare]] being to collect live prisoners for [[human sacrifice|sacrifice]].&lt;ref&gt;Meyer, Michael C. and William L.

During the [[early Muslim conquests]], Muslims routinely captured large number of prisoners. Aside from those who converted, most were ransomed or enslaved.&lt;ref&gt;(Crone (2004), pp. 371–72)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roger DuPasquier. Unveiling Islam.

==Modern times==
[[File:3090 interrogation lg.jpg|thumb|Russian and Japanese prisoners being interrogated by Chinese officials during the [[Boxer Rebellion]].]]
The 1648 [[Peace of Westphalia]], which ended the [[Thirty Years' War]], established the rule that prisoners of war should be released without ransom at the end of hostilities and that they should be allowed to return to their homelands.&lt;ref&gt;"Prisoner of war", ''Encyclopædia Britannica''&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Andersonvillesurvivor.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Union Army]] soldier on his release from [[Andersonville prison]] in May 1865.]]

There also evolved the [[Prisoners of war parole|right of ''parole'']], French for "discourse", in which a captured officer surrendered his sword and gave his word as a gentleman in exchange for privileges. If he swore not to escape, he could gain better accommodations and the freedom of the prison. If he swore to cease hostilities against the nation who held him captive, he could be repatriated or exchanged but could not serve against his former captors in a military capacity.

===European settlers captured in North America===
{{further|American Revolution prisoners of war}}
Early historical narratives of captured colonial Europeans, including perspectives of literate women captured by the indigenous peoples of North America, exist in some number. The writings of [[Mary Rowlandson]], captured in the brutal fighting of [[King Philip's War]], are an example. Such narratives enjoyed some popularity, spawning a genre of the [[captivity narrative]], and had lasting influence on the body of early American literature, most notably through the legacy of [[James Fenimore Cooper]]'s ''[[Last of the Mohicans]]''. Some Native Americans continued to capture Europeans and use them both as labourers and bargaining chips into the 19th century; see for example [[John R. Jewitt]], an Englishman who wrote a memoir about his years as a captive of the [[Nuu-chah-nulth people|Nootka]] people on the [[Pacific Northwest]] coast from 1802–1805.

===French Revolutionary wars and Napoleonic wars===
The earliest known purposely built [[prisoner-of-war camp]] was established at [[Norman Cross]], England in 1797 to house the increasing number of prisoners from the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] and the [[Napoleonic Wars]].{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} The average prison population was about 5,500 men. The lowest number recorded was 3,300 in October 1804 and 6,272 on 10 April 1810 was the highest number of prisoners recorded in any official document. Norman Cross was intended to be a model depot providing the most humane treatment of prisoners of war. The British government went to great lengths to provide food of a quality at least equal to that available to locals. The senior officer from each quadrangle was permitted to inspect the food as it was delivered to the prison to ensure it was of sufficient quality. Despite the generous supply and quality of food, some prisoners died of starvation after gambling away their rations. Most of the men held in the prison were low-ranking soldiers and sailors, including midshipmen and junior officers, with a small number of [[privateers]]. About 100 senior officers and some civilians "of good social standing", mainly passengers on captured ships and the wives of some officers, were given ''parole d'honneur'' outside the prison, mainly in [[Peterborough]] although some further afield in [[Northampton]], [[Plymouth]], [[Melrose, Scotland|Melrose]] and [[Abergavenny]]. They were afforded the courtesy of their rank within English society.
The Leipzig citizen [[Johann Friedrich Rochlitz|Rochlitz]] remarked in his account about the [[Battle of Leipzig]], that large crowds of French POWs were held on fields outside the town, begged passersby for food, and that most of them didn't survive this ordeal.

===Prisoner exchanges===
The extensive period of conflict during the [[American Revolutionary War]] and [[Napoleonic Wars]] (1793–1815), followed by the [[United Kingdom – United States relations|Anglo-American]] [[War of 1812]], led to the emergence of a [[cartel (ship)|cartel]] system for the [[exchange of prisoners]], even while the belligerents were at war. A cartel was usually arranged by the respective armed service for the exchange of like-ranked personnel. The aim was to achieve a reduction in the number of prisoners held, while at the same time alleviating shortages of skilled personnel in the home country.

===American Civil War===
{{main|American Civil War prison camps}}
At the start of the civil war a system of paroles operated. Captives agreed not to fight until they were officially exchanged. Meanwhile, they were held in camps run by their own army where they were paid but not allowed to perform any military duties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Roger Pickenpaugh|title=Captives in Blue: The Civil War Prisons of the Confederacy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pWOfsOceCNUC&amp;pg=PA57|year=2013|publisher=University of Alabama Press|pages=57–73}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system of exchanges collapsed in 1863 when the Confederacy refused to exchange black prisoners. In the late summer of 1864, a year after the [[Dix-Hill Cartel]] was suspended; Confederate officials approached Union General Benjamin Butler, Union Commissioner of Exchange, about resuming the cartel and including the black prisoners. Butler contacted Grant for guidance on the issue, and Grant responded to Butler on August 18, 1864 with his now famous statement. He rejected the offer, stating in essence, that the Union could afford to leave their men in captivity, the Confederacy could not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/ande/historyculture/grant-and-the-prisoner-exchange.htm |title=Myth: General Ulysses S.

National Geographic News. 1 July 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Amelioration===
During the 19th century, there were increased efforts to improve the treatment and processing of prisoners. As a result of these emerging conventions, a number of international conferences were held, starting with the Brussels Conference of 1874, with nations agreeing that it was necessary to prevent inhumane treatment of prisoners and the use of weapons causing unnecessary harm. Although no agreements were immediately ratified by the participating nations, work was continued that resulted in new [[treaty|conventions]] being adopted and becoming recognized as [[international law]] that specified that prisoners of war be treated humanely and diplomatically.

===Hague and Geneva Conventions===
Chapter II of the Annex to the [[Hague Convention of 1907|1907 Hague Convention]] ''IV – The Laws and Customs of War on Land'' covered the treatment of prisoners of war in detail. These provisions were further expanded in the [[Geneva Convention (1929)|1929 Geneva Convention on the Prisoners of War]] and were largely revised in the [[Third Geneva Convention]] in 1949.

Article 4 of the [[Third Geneva Convention]] protects captured [[military personnel]], some [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] fighters, and certain [[civilians]]. It applies from the moment a prisoner is captured until he or she is released or repatriated. One of the main provisions of the convention makes it illegal to [[torture]] prisoners and states that a prisoner can only be required to give their [[name]], [[date of birth]], [[Military rank|rank]] and [[service number]] (if applicable).

The [[ICRC]] has a special role to play, with regards to [[international humanitarian law]], in [[Restoring Family Links|restoring and maintaining family contact in times of war]], in particular concerning the right of prisoners of war and internees to send and receive letters and cards (Geneva Convention (GC) III, art.71 and GC IV, art.107).

However, nations vary in their dedication to following these laws, and historically the treatment of POWs has varied greatly. During World War II, [[Imperial Japan]] and [[Nazi Germany]] (towards Soviet POWs and Western Allied commandos) were notorious for atrocities against prisoners of war. The German military used the Soviet Union's refusal to sign the Geneva Convention as a reason for not providing the necessities of life to Soviet POWs; and the Soviets similarly killed Axis prisoners or used them as slave labour. The Germans also routinely executed Western Allied commandos captured behind German lines per the [[Commando Order]]. North Korean and North and South Vietnamese forces&lt;ref name="south-viet"&gt;{{cite web|title=In South Vietnamese Jails|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/10775|accessdate=30 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; routinely killed or mistreated prisoners taken during those conflicts.

====Qualifications====
[[File:Japanese Beheading 1894.jpg|thumb|Japanese illustration depicting the beheading of Chinese captives. [[First Sino-Japanese War|Sino-Japanese War]] of 1894–5.]]
To be entitled to prisoner-of-war status, captured persons must be lawful combatants entitled to combatant's privilege—which gives them immunity from punishment for crimes constituting lawful acts of war such as killing enemy combatants. To qualify under the Third Geneva Convention, a combatant must be part of a [[chain of command]], wear a "fixed distinctive marking, visible from a distance", bear arms openly, and have conducted military operations according to the [[laws and customs of war]]. (The Convention recognizes a few other groups as well, such as "[i]nhabitants of a non-occupied territory, who on the approach of the enemy spontaneously take up arms to resist the invading forces, without having had time to form themselves into regular armed units".)

Thus, uniforms and/or badges are important in determining prisoner-of-war status; and ''[[francs-tireurs]]'', [[terrorists]], [[Sabotage|saboteurs]], [[Mercenary|mercenaries]], and [[Espionage|spies]] do not qualify because they do not always follow the laws and customs of war and therefore they fall under the category of [[unlawful combatant]]s. In practice, these criteria are rarely interpreted strictly. [[Guerrilla]]s, for example, usually do not wear a uniform or carry arms openly, but captured guerrillas are often granted POW status.

The criteria are applied primarily to ''international'' armed conflicts; in [[civil wars]], [[insurgents]] are often treated as [[traitors]] or [[criminals]] by government forces, and are sometimes executed. However, in the [[American Civil War]], both sides treated captured troops as POWs, presumably out of [[Reciprocity (international relations)|reciprocity]], although the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] regarded [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] personnel as separatist rebels. However, guerrillas and other irregular combatants generally cannot expect to receive benefits from both civilian and military status simultaneously.

===Rights===
Under the [[Third Geneva Convention]], prisoners of war (POW) must be:

*Treated humanely with respect for their persons and their honor
*Able to inform their next of kin and the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] of their capture
*Allowed to communicate regularly with relatives and receive packages
*Given adequate food, clothing, housing, and medical attention
*Paid for work done and not forced to do work that is dangerous, unhealthy, or degrading
*Released quickly after conflicts end
*Not compelled to give any information except for name, age, rank, and service number&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Geneva Convention|url=http://www.ppu.org.uk/learn/texts/doc_geneva_con.html|publisher=Peace Pledge Union|accessdate=6 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, if wounded or sick on the battlefield, the prisoner will receive help from the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Story of an idea- the Film|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIwB-Y6FUjY|publisher=International Committee of the Red Cross|accessdate=6 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a country is responsible for breaches of prisoner of war rights, those accountable will be punished accordingly. An example of this is the [[Nuremberg Trials|Nuremberg]] and [[Tokyo Trials]]. German and Japanese military commanders were prosecuted for preparing and initiating a [[war of aggression]], [[murder]], ill treatment, and [[deportation]] of individuals, and [[genocide]] during World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Penrose|first=Mary Margaret|title=War Crime|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/635621/war-crime/224687/The-Nurnberg-and-Tokyo-trials|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=6 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most were executed or sentenced to life in prison for their crimes.

===U.S. Code of Conduct and terminology===
[[File:VietnamCombatArtCATJamesPollockWaitingInterrogation.jpg|thumb|''Waiting interrogation, 199th LT INF BG'' by [[James Pollock (artist)|James Pollock]]]]

[[The United States Military Code of Conduct]] was promulgated in 1955 via [[s:Executive Order 10631|Executive Order 10631]] under [[U.S. President|President]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] to serve as a moral code for United States service members who have been taken prisoner. It was created primarily in response to the breakdown of leadership and organization, specifically when U.S. forces were POWs during the [[Korean War]].

When a military member is taken prisoner, the Code of Conduct reminds them that the chain of command is still in effect (the highest ranking service member eligible for command, regardless of service branch, is in command), and requires them to support their leadership. The Code of Conduct also requires service members to resist giving information to the enemy (beyond identifying themselves, that is, "name, rank, serial number"), receiving special favors or parole, or otherwise providing their enemy captors aid and comfort.

Since the [[Vietnam War]], the official U.S. military term for enemy POWs is EPW (Enemy Prisoner of War). This name change was introduced in order to distinguish between enemy and U.S. captives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/policy/army/fm/3-19-40/ch1.htm#par2 |title=FM3-19.40 Part 1 Fundamentals of Internment/Resettlement Operations Chptr 1 Introduction |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |date=12 August 1949 |accessdate=14 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE7DE1239F93AA25751C0A967958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all | work=The New York Times | title=War in the Gulf: P.O.W.'s; U.S. Says Prisoners Seem War-Weary | first=Eric | last=Schmitt | date=19 February 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, the U.S. military replaced the designation "Prisoner of War" for captured American personnel with "Missing-Captured". A January 2008 directive states that the reasoning behind this is since "Prisoner of War" is the international legal recognized status for such people there is no need for any individual country to follow suit. This change remains relatively unknown even among experts in the field and "Prisoner of War" remains widely used in the Pentagon which has a "POW/Missing Personnel Office" and awards the [[Prisoner of War Medal]].&lt;ref name=Missing-Captured&gt;{{cite web|last=Thompson |first=Mark |url=http://battleland.blogs.time.com/2012/05/17/pentagon-we-dont-call-them-pows-anymore/ |title=Pentagon: We Don't Call Them POWs Anymore |work=Time |date=2012-05-17 |accessdate=2014-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/130018p.pdf |title=Department of Defense INSTRUCTION January 8, 2008 Incorporating Change 1, August 14, 2009 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2014-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War I==
{{See also|World War I prisoners of war in Germany}}
[[File:US pow.jpg|thumb|American prisoners of war in Germany in 1917]]
[[File:German POWs captured in Flanders by Brits2.jpg|thumb|German soldiers captured by the British in [[Flanders]].]]
During World War I, about eight million men surrendered and were held in POW camps until the war ended. All nations pledged to follow the Hague rules on fair treatment of prisoners of war, and in general the POWs had a much higher survival rate than their peers who were not captured.&lt;ref&gt;Geo G. Phillimore and Hugh H. L. Bellot, "Treatment of Prisoners of War", ''Transactions of the Grotius Society'', Vol. 5, (1919), pp. 47–64.&lt;/ref&gt; Individual surrenders were uncommon; usually a large unit surrendered all its men. At [[Battle of Tannenberg (1914)|Tannenberg]] 92,000 Russians surrendered during the battle. When the besieged garrison of [[Kaunas]] surrendered in 1915, 20,000 Russians became prisoners. Over half the Russian losses were prisoners as a proportion of those captured, wounded or killed. About 3.3 million men became prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;Niall Ferguson, ''The Pity of War.'' (1999) pp. 368–69 for data.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[German Empire]] held 2.5 million prisoners; [[Russian Empire|Russia]] held 2.9 million, and [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] and [[French Third Republic|France]] held about 720,000, mostly gained in the period just before the [[Armistice]] in 1918. The US held 48,000. The most dangerous moment for POW's was the act of surrender, when helpless soldiers were sometimes mistakenly shot down. Once prisoners reached a POW camp conditions were better (and often much better than in World War II), thanks in part to the efforts of the [[International Red Cross]] and inspections by neutral nations.

There was however much harsh treatment of POWs in Germany, as recorded by the American ambassador to Germany (prior to America's entry into the war), James W. Gerard, who published his findings in "My Four Years in Germany". Even worse conditions are reported in the book "Escape of a Princess Pat" by the Canadian George Pearson. It was particularly bad in Russia, where starvation was common for prisoners and civilians alike; a quarter of the over 2 million POWs held there died.&lt;ref&gt;"''[https://books.google.com/books?id=PP7uMQdgv5AC&amp;pg=PA240&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Disobedience and Conspiracy in the German Army, 1918–1945]''".

Speed, III. ''Prisoners, Diplomats and the Great War: A Study in the Diplomacy of Captivity.'' (1990); Ferguson, ''The Pity of War.'' (1999) Ch 13; Desmond Morton, ''Silent Battle: Canadian Prisoners of War in Germany, 1914–1919.'' 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ottoman Empire]] often treated prisoners of war poorly. Some 11,800 British soldiers, most of them Indians, became prisoners after the five-month [[Siege of Kut]], in [[Mesopotamia]], in April 1916. Many were weak and starved when they surrendered and 4,250 died in captivity.&lt;ref&gt;British National Archives, "The Mesopotamia campaign", at [http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pathways/firstworldwar/battles/mesopotamia.htm];&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Sinai and Palestine campaign]] 217 Australian and unknown numbers of British, New Zealand and Indian soldiers were captured by Ottoman Empire forces. About 50% of the Australian prisoners were light horsemen including 48 missing believed captured on 1 May 1918 in the Jordan Valley. [[Australian Flying Corps]] pilots and observers were captured in the Sinai Peninsula, Palestine and the Levant. One third of all Australian prisoners were captured on Gallipoli including the crew of the submarine AE2 which made a passage through the Dardanelles in 1915. Forced marches and crowded railway journeys preceded years in camps where disease, poor diet and inadequate medical facilities prevailed. About 25% of other ranks died, many from malnutrition, while only one officer died.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Dennis, [[Jeffrey Grey]], Ewan Morris, Robin Prior with Jean Bou, ''The Oxford Companion to Australian Military History'' (2008) p. 429&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H.S. Gullett, ''Official History of Australia in the War of 1914–18, Vol. VII The Australian Imperial Force in Sinai and Palestine'' (1941) pp. 620–2&lt;/ref&gt;

The most curious case came in Russia where the [[Czechoslovak Legion]] of [[Czechoslovak]] prisoners (from the [[Austro-Hungarian]] army): they were released in 1917, armed themselves, briefly culminating into a military and diplomatic force during the [[Russian Civil War]].

===Release of prisoners===

At the end of the war in 1918 there were believed to be 140,000 British prisoners of war in Germany, including thousands of internees held in neutral Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.postalhistory.org.uk/pdf/phs_at_rpsl_booklet_for_web_sites.pdf The Postal History Society 1936–2011—75th anniversary display to the Royal Philatelic Society, London], p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; The first British prisoners were released and reached [[Calais]] on 15 November. Plans were made for them to be sent via [[Dunkirk]] to [[Dover]] and a large reception camp was established at Dover capable of housing 40,000 men, which could later be used for [[demobilisation]].

On 13 December 1918, the armistice was extended and the Allies reported that by 9 December 264,000 prisoners had been repatriated. A very large number of these had been released ''en masse'' and sent across Allied lines without any food or shelter. This created difficulties for the receiving Allies and many released prisoners died from exhaustion. The released POWs were met by [[cavalry]] troops and sent back through the lines in lorries to reception centres where they were refitted with boots and clothing and dispatched to the ports in trains.

Upon arrival at the receiving camp the POWs were registered and "boarded" before being dispatched to their own homes. All [[commissioned officer]]s had to write a report on the circumstances of their capture and to ensure that they had done all they could to avoid capture. Each returning officer and man was given a message from King [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]], written in his own hand and reproduced on a lithograph. It read as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/ImagesandBroadcasts/TheQueenandtechnology.aspx |title=The Queen and technology |publisher=Royal.gov.uk |accessdate=14 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509195352/http://www.royal.gov.uk/ImagesandBroadcasts/TheQueenandtechnology.aspx |archivedate=9 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Allied prisoners were sent home at the end of the war, the same treatment was not granted to [[Central Powers]] prisoners of the Allies and Russia, many of whom had to serve as [[forced labour]], e.g. in France, until 1920.

===Treatment of POWs by the Axis===
{{See also|Nazi crimes against Soviet POWs|Japanese war crimes}}

====Empire of Japan====
The [[Empire of Japan]], which had signed but never ratified the [[Geneva Convention (1929)|1929 Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/WebSign?ReadForm&amp;id=305&amp;ps=S |title=International Humanitarian Law – State Parties / Signatories |publisher=Icrc.org |date=27 July 1929 |accessdate=14 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; did not treat prisoners of war in accordance with international agreements, including provisions of the [[Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)|Hague Conventions]], either during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] or during the [[Pacific War]], because the Japanese viewed surrender as dishonorable. Moreover, according to a directive ratified on 5 August 1937 by [[Hirohito]], the constraints of the Hague Conventions were explicitly removed on Chinese prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;Akira Fujiwara, ''Nitchû Sensô ni Okeru Horyo Gyakusatsu'', Kikan Sensô Sekinin Kenkyû 9, 1995, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

Prisoners of war from China, the United States, Australia, Britain, Canada, India, the Netherlands, New Zealand, and the Philippines held by the Japanese armed forces were subject to murder, beatings, summary punishment, brutal treatment, [[Slavery in Japan|forced labour]], [[Unit 731|medical experimentation]], starvation rations, poor medical treatment and [[Chichijima incident|cannibalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/japanese-troops-ate-flesh-of-enemies-and-civilians-1539816.html|author=McCarthy, Terry|title=Japanese troops ate flesh of enemies and civilians|publisher=The Independent|date=12 August 1992|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most notorious use of forced labour was in the construction of the Burma–Thailand [[Death Railway]]. After 20 March 1943, the Imperial Navy was under orders to execute all prisoners taken at sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-491548/Alive-safe-brutal-Japanese-soldiers-butchered-20-000-Allied-seamen-cold-blood.html|author=Blundell, Nigel|title=Alive and safe, the brutal Japanese soldiers who butchered 20,000 Allied seamen in cold blood|publisher=Mail Online (Associated Newspapers Ltd.)|date=3 November 2007|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the findings of the [[International Military Tribunal for the Far East|Tokyo Tribunal]], the death rate of Western prisoners was 27.1%, seven times that of POWs under the Germans and Italians.&lt;ref&gt;Yuki Tanaka, ''Hidden Horrors'', 1996, pp. 2, 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The death rate of Chinese was much higher. Thus, while 37,583 prisoners from the United Kingdom, Commonwealth, and Dominions, 28,500 from the Netherlands, and 14,473 from the United States were released after the [[surrender of Japan]], the number for the Chinese was only 56.&lt;ref&gt;Tanaka, ibid., [[Herbert Bix]], ''[[Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan]]'', 2001, p. 360&lt;/ref&gt; The 27,465 [[United States Army]] and [[United States Army Air Forces]] POWs in the Pacific Theater had a 40.4% death rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=World War II POWs remember efforts to strike against captors |agency=Associated Press |url=http://www.nola.com/news/index.ssf/2012/10/world_war_ii_pows_remember_the.html |newspaper=The Times-Picayune |date=5 October 2012 |accessdate=23 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The War Ministry in Tokyo issued an order at the end of the war to kill all surviving POWs.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/bataan/peopleevents/e_atrocities.html title=Japanese Atrocities in the Philippines]". Public Broadcasting Service (PBS)&lt;/ref&gt;

No direct access to the POWs was provided to the [[International Red Cross]]. Escapes among Caucasian prisoners were almost impossible because of the difficulty of men of Caucasian descent hiding in Asiatic societies.&lt;ref&gt;''Prisoners of the Japanese : POWs of World War II in the Pacific''—by Gavin Dawes, {{ISBN|0-688-14370-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Allied POW camps and ship-transports were sometimes accidental targets of Allied attacks. The number of deaths which occurred when Japanese "[[hell ship]]s"—unmarked transport ships in which POWs were transported in harsh conditions—were attacked by US Navy submarines was particularly high. Gavan Daws has calculated that "of all POWs who died in the Pacific War, one in three was killed on the water by friendly fire".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dawes|first=Gavan|title=Prisoners of the Japanese: POWs of World War II in the Pacific|year=1994|publisher=Scribe Publications|isbn=1-920769-12-9|pages=295–297|location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt; Daves states that 10,800 of the 50,000 POWs shipped by the Japanese were killed at sea&lt;ref&gt;Daws (1994), p. 297&lt;/ref&gt; while Donald L. Miller states that "approximately 21,000 Allied POWs died at sea, about 19,000 of them killed by friendly fire."&lt;ref&gt;"Donald L. Miller "D-Days in the Pacific", p. 317"&lt;/ref&gt;

Life in the POW camps was recorded at great risk to themselves by artists such as [[Jack Bridger Chalker]], [[Philip Meninsky]], [[Ashley George Old]], and [[Ronald Searle]]. Human hair was often used for brushes, plant juices and blood for paint, and toilet paper as the "canvas". Some of their works were used as evidence in the trials of Japanese war criminals.

Research into the conditions of the camps has been conducted by The Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.captivememories.org.uk/ Home]. Captivememories.org.uk. Retrieved on 2014-05-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Germany====
=====French soldiers=====
{{main|French prisoners of war in World War II}}
After the French armies surrendered in summer 1940, Germany seized two million French prisoners of war and sent them to camps in Germany. About one third were released on various terms. Of the remainder, the officers and non-commissioned officers were kept in camps and did not work. The privates were sent out to work. About half of them worked for German agriculture, where food supplies were adequate and controls were lenient. The others worked in factories or mines, where conditions were much harsher.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Vinen, ''The Unfree French: Life under the Occupation'' (2006) pp 183–214&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Western Allies' POWs=====
{{see also|Belgian prisoners of war in World War II}}
Germany and Italy generally treated prisoners from the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]], France, the USA, and other western Allies in accordance with the [[Geneva Convention (1929)|Geneva Convention]], which had been signed by these countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cicr.org/ihl.nsf/WebSign?ReadForm&amp;id=305&amp;ps=P |title=International Humanitarian Law—State Parties / Signatories |publisher=Cicr.org |accessdate=14 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, western Allied officers were not usually made to work and some personnel of lower rank were usually compensated, or not required to work either. The main complaints of western Allied prisoners of war in [[Wehrmacht|German]] POW camps—especially during the last two years of the war—concerned shortages of food.
[[File:American POWs AF Museum.jpg|left|thumb|Representation of a "Forty-and-eight" boxcar used to transport American POWs in Germany during World War II.]]
Only a small proportion of western Allied POWs who were [[Jew]]s—or whom the Nazis believed to be Jewish—were killed as part of [[the Holocaust]] or were subjected to other [[antisemitism|antisemitic]] policies.{{dubious|date=July 2016}}{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} For example, Major [[Yitzhak Ben-Aharon]], a [[Palestinian Jew]] who had enlisted in the British Army, and who was captured by the Germans in [[Greek Campaign|Greece in 1941]], experienced four years of captivity under entirely normal conditions for POWs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jafi.org.il/JewishAgency/English/Jewish+Education/Compelling+Content/Eye+on+Israel/Gallery+of+People+(Biographies)/Ben+Aharon+Yitzhak.htm |title=Ben Aharon Yitzhak |publisher=Jafi.org.il |accessdate=14 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318070158/http://www.jafi.org.il/JewishAgency/English/Jewish+Education/Compelling+Content/Eye+on+Israel/Gallery+of+People+(Biographies)/Ben+Aharon+Yitzhak.htm |archivedate=18 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:pow telegram.jpg|thumb|Telegram notifying parents of an American POW of his capture by Germany]]
However, a small number of Allied personnel were sent to concentration camps, for a variety of reasons including being Jewish.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, [https://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.cgi?path=295291169228827 Joseph Robert White, 2006, "Flint Whitlock. Given Up for Dead: American GIs in the Nazi Concentration Camp at Berga"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611020900/http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.cgi?path=295291169228827 |date=11 June 2007 }} (book review)&lt;/ref&gt; As the US historian Joseph Robert White put it: "An important exception ... is the sub-camp for U.S. POWs at [[Berga, Thuringia|Berga an der Elster]], officially called ''[[Arbeitslager|Arbeitskommando]] 625'' [also known as ''[[Stalag IX-B]]'']. Berga was the deadliest work detachment for American captives in Germany. 73 men who participated, or 21 percent of the detachment, perished in two months. 80 of the 350 POWs were Jews."{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}  Another well-known example was a group of 168 Australian, British, Canadian, [[New Zealand]] and US aviators who were held for two months at [[Buchenwald concentration camp]];&lt;ref&gt;See: [http://www.vac-acc.gc.ca/remembers/sub.cfm?source=historgokhopdkhpofkofkofjkhjkhjkhojkv luvnbdy/secondwar/fact_sheets/pow Veterans Affairs Canada, 2006, "Prisoners of War in the Second World War"] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20071114105127/http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil:80/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=1575 National Museum of the USAF, "Allied Victims of the Holocaust"].{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; two of the POWs died at Buchenwald. Two possible reasons have been suggested for this incident: German authorities wanted to make an example of ''[[terror bombing|Terrorflieger]]'' ("terrorist aviators") and/or these aircrews were classified as spies, because they had been disguised as civilians or enemy soldiers when they were apprehended.

Information on conditions in the stalags is contradictory depending on the source. Some American POWs claimed the Germans were victims of circumstance and did the best they could, while others accused their captors of brutalities and forced labour. In any case, the prison camps were miserable places where food rations were meager and conditions squalid. One American admitted "The only difference between the stalags and concentration camps was that we weren't gassed or shot in the former. I do not recall a single act of compassion or mercy on the part of the Germans." Typical meals consisted of a bread slice and watery potato soup which, however, was still more substantial than what Soviet POWs or concentration camp inmates received. Another prisoner stated that "The German plan was to keep us alive, yet weakened enough that we wouldn't attempt escape."&lt;ref&gt;Ambrose, pp 360&lt;/ref&gt;

As Soviet ground forces approached some POW camps in early 1945, German guards [[The March (1945)|forced western Allied POWs to walk]] long distances towards central Germany, often in extreme winter weather conditions.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}  It is estimated that, out of 257,000 POWs, about 80,000 were subject to such marches and up to 3,500 of them died as a result.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

=====Italian POWs=====
{{main|Operation Achse|Italian military internees|Massacre of the Acqui Division}}

In September 1943 after the Armistice, Italian officers and soldiers that in many places waited for clear superior orders, were arrested by Germans and Italian fascists and taken to German internment camps in Germany or Eastern Europe, where they were held for the duration of World War II. The International Red Cross could do nothing for them, as they were not regarded as POWs, but the prisoners held the status of "[[Italian military internees|military internees]]". Treatment of the prisoners was generally poor. The author [[Giovannino Guareschi]] was among those interned and wrote about this time in his life. The book was translated and published as "My Secret Diary". He wrote about the hungers of semi-starvation, the casual murder of individual prisoners by guards and how, when they were released (now from a German camp), they found a deserted German town filled with foodstuffs that they (with other released prisoners) ate.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}. It is estimated that of the 1,070,000 Italians taken prisoner by the Germans, around 40,000 died in detention and more than 13,000 lost their lives during the transportation from the Greek islands to the mainland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.anrp.it/le-porte-della-memoria/|title = Le porte della Memoria|accessdate = 2006-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Eastern European POWs=====
{{Main|German mistreatment of Soviet prisoners of war}}
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-B21845, Sowjetische Kriegsgefangene im Lager.jpg|left|thumb|An improvised camp for Soviet POWs. Between June 1941 and January 1942, the Nazis killed an estimated 2.8 million Soviet prisoners of war, whom they viewed as "[[Untermensch|subhuman]]".&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Goldhagen, ''Hitler's Willing Executioners'' (p. 290)—"2.8 million young, healthy Soviet POWs" killed by the Germans, "mainly by starvation ... in less than eight months" of 1941–42, before "the decimation of Soviet POWs ... was stopped" and the Germans "began to use them as laborers".&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Germany did not apply the same standard of treatment to non-western prisoners, especially many Polish and Soviet POWs who suffered harsh conditions and died in large numbers while in captivity.

Between 1941 and 1945 the Axis powers took about 5.7 million Soviet prisoners. About one million of them were released during the war, in that their status changed but they remained under German authority. A little over 500,000 either escaped or were liberated by the Red Army. Some 930,000 more were found alive in camps after the war. The remaining 3.3 million prisoners (57.5% of the total captured) died during their captivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.historynet.com/wars_conflicts/world_war_2/3037296.html |title= Soviet Prisoners of War: Forgotten Nazi Victims of World War II |publisher= [[Historynet.com]] |accessdate= 14 April 2012 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080330210330/http://www.historynet.com/wars_conflicts/world_war_2/3037296.html |archivedate= 30 March 2008 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Between the launching of [[Operation Barbarossa]] in the summer of 1941 and the following spring, 2.8 million of the 3.2 million Soviet prisoners taken died while in German hands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Davies|first= Norman|title= [[Europe at War 1939–1945: No Simple Victory]]|publisher= Pan Books|location= London|year= 2006|page= 271|isbn= 978-0-330-35212-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Russian military historian General [[Grigoriy Krivosheyev]], the Axis powers took 4.6 million Soviet prisoners, of whom 1.8 million were found alive in camps after the war and 318,770 were released by the Axis during the war and were then drafted into the Soviet armed forces again.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web |url= http://gpw.tellur.ru/page.html?r=facts&amp;s=losses |title= Report at the session of the Russian association of WWII historians in 1998 |publisher= Gpw.tellur.ru |accessdate= 14 April 2012 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120320223821/http://gpw.tellur.ru/page.html?r=facts&amp;s=losses |archivedate= 20 March 2012 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; By comparison, 8,348 Western Allied prisoners died in German camps during 1939–45 (3.5% of the 232,000 total).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Michael Burleigh |title= The Third Reich—A New History| publisher= Hill and Wang |location=New York |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-8090-9325-0 |pages= 512–13 |authorlink= Michael Burleigh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 192-208, KZ Mauthausen, Sowjetische Kriegsgefangene.jpg|thumb|Naked Soviet prisoners of war in [[Mauthausen concentration camp]].]] The Germans officially justified their policy on the grounds that the Soviet Union had not signed the Geneva Convention.

There were stories during the Cold War to the effect that 23,000 Americans who had been held in German POW camps were seized by the Soviets and never repatriated. This myth had been perpetuated after the release of people like [[John H. Noble]]. Careful scholarly studies have demonstrated this is a myth based on a misinterpretation of a telegram that was talking about Soviet prisoners held in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Paul M. Cole (1994) ''[https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/monograph_reports/2006/MR351.2.pdf POW/MIA Issues: Volume 2, World War II and the Early Cold War]'' National Defense Research Institute.

According to [[Stephen E. Ambrose]], of the roughly 1,000 US combat veterans that he had interviewed, only one admitted to shooting a prisoner, saying that he "felt remorse, but would do it again". However, one-third told him they had seen US troops kill German prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;[[James J. Weingartner]], [http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/jah/94.4/weingartner.html ''"Americans, Germans, and War Crimes: Converging Narratives from "the Good War"''] the [[Journal of American History]], Vol. 94, No. 4.

Towards the end of the war in Europe, as large numbers of Axis soldiers surrendered, the US created the designation of [[Disarmed Enemy Forces]] (DEF) so as not to treat prisoners as POWs. A lot of these soldiers were kept in open fields in makeshift camps in the Rhine valley (''[[Rheinwiesenlager]]''). Controversy has arisen about how Eisenhower managed these prisoners&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,958673,00.html | work=Time | title=Ike's Revenge? | date=2 October 1989 | accessdate=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see ''[[Other Losses]]'').

After the surrender of Germany in May 1945, the POW status of the German prisoners was in many cases maintained, and they were for several years used as forced labour in countries such as the UK and France. Many died when forced to clear minefields in Norway, France etc.; "by September 1945 it was estimated by the French authorities that two thousand prisoners were being maimed and killed each month in accidents"&lt;ref&gt;S. P. MacKenzie "The Treatment of Prisoners of War in World War II" The Journal of Modern History, Vol. 66, No. 3. (September 1994), pp. 487–520.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Footnote to: K. W. Bohme, Zur Geschichte der deutschen Kriegsgefangenen des Zweiten Weltkrieges, 15 vols. (Munich, 1962–74), 1, pt. 1:x. (n. 1 above), 13:173; ICRC (n. 12 above), p. 334.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946, the UK had more than 400,000 German prisoners, many had been transferred from POW camps in the US and Canada. Many of these were for over three years after the German surrender used as forced labour, as a form of "reparations".&lt;ref name="Noam Chomsky 1979 pp. 35"&gt;Noam Chomsky, Edward S. Herman, "After the Cataclysm: Postwar Indochina and the Reconstruction of Imperial Ideology" (1979) pp. 35–37&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eugene Davidsson, "The Trial of the Germans: An Account of the Twenty-Two Defendants Before the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg", (1997) pp. 518–19 "the Allies stated in 1943 their intention of using forced workers outside Germany after the war, and not only did they express the intention but they carried it out. Not only Russia made use of such labour. France was given hundreds of thousands of German prisoners of war captured by the Americans, and their physical condition became so bad that the American Army authorities themselves protested. In England and the United States, too, some German prisoners of war were being put to work long after the surrender, and in Russia thousands of them worked until the mid-50's."&lt;/ref&gt; A public debate ensued in the UK, where words such as "forced labour", "slaves", "slave labour" were increasingly used in the media and in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]].&lt;ref name="German migrants"&gt;{{cite book | author = Inge Weber-Newth |author2=Johannes-Dieter Steinert | title = German migrants in post-war Britain: an enemy embrace | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=hSxK1Hus-BIC | accessdate = 15 December 2009 | year = 2006 | publisher = Routledge | isbn =978-0-7146-5657-1| pages = 24–30 | chapter = Chapter 2: Immigration policy—immigrant policy  | quote = Views in the Media were mirrored in the House of commons, where the arguments were characterized by a series of questions, the substance of which were always the same.

The "[[London Cage]]", an [[MI19]] prisoner of war facility in the UK used for interrogating prisoners before they were sent to prison camps during and immediately after World War II, was subject to allegations of torture.&lt;ref name='Secrets'&gt;{{cite news | first=Ian | last=Cobain |authorlink= | title=The secrets of the London Cage | date=12 November 2005 | publisher= | url =https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/nov/12/secondworldwar.world | work =The Guardian | pages = | accessdate = 17 January 2009 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the German surrender, the International Red Cross was prohibited from providing aid such as food or visiting prisoner camps in Germany. However, after making approaches to the Allies in the autumn of 1945 it was allowed to investigate the camps in the British and French occupation zones of Germany, as well as to provide relief to the prisoners held there.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2005"&gt;Staff. [http://www.icrc.org/web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/htmlall/57jnwx?opendocument ICRC in WW II: German prisoners of war in Allied hands], 2 February 2005&lt;!--Retrieved 12 August 2008--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 February 1946, the Red Cross was permitted to visit and assist prisoners also in the US occupation zone of Germany, although only with very small quantities of food. "During their visits, the delegates observed that German prisoners of war were often detained in appalling conditions. They drew the attention of the authorities to this fact, and gradually succeeded in getting some improvements made".&lt;ref name="autogenerated2005"/&gt;

The Allies also shipped POWs between them, with for example 6,000 German officers transferred from Western Allied camps to the [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]] that now was under Soviet Union administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0CEFDA163EF934A25751C1A9679C8B63 | work=The New York Times | title=Ex-Death Camp Tells Story of Nazi and Soviet Horrors | first=Desmond | last=Butler | date=17 December 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US also shipped 740,000 German POWs as forced labourers to France from where newspaper reports told of very bad treatment. Judge [[Robert H. Jackson]], Chief US prosecutor in the [[Nuremberg trials]], in October 1945 told US President [[Harry S. Truman]] that the Allies themselves:
&lt;blockquote&gt;have done or are doing some of the very things we are prosecuting the Germans for. The French are so violating the Geneva Convention in the treatment of prisoners of war that our command is taking back prisoners sent to them. We are prosecuting plunder and our Allies are practicing it.&lt;ref&gt;David Lubań, "Legal Modernism", Univ of Michigan Press, 1994. {{ISBN|978-0-472-10380-5}} pp. 360, 361&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/nuremberg/peopleevents/e_warcrimes.html The Legacy of Nuremberg] PBF&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Hungarians====
Hungarians became POWs of the Western Allies. Some of these were, like Germans, used as forced labour in France after the cessation of hostilities.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hungarianhistory.com/lib/francia/francia.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
After the war the POWs were handed over to the Soviets, and after the POWs were transported to the [[USSR]] for [[Unfree labour|forced labour]]. It is called even today in [[Hungary]] [[malenkij robot]]—little work. [[András Toma]], a Hungarian soldier taken prisoner by the Red Army in 1944, was discovered in a Russian psychiatric hospital in 2000. He was probably the last prisoner of war from World War II to be repatriated.&lt;ref&gt;Thorpe, Nick. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/929702.stm Hungarian POW identified]. [[BBC News]], 17 September 2000. Accessed 11 December 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

====Japanese====
[[File:OkinawaJapanesePOW.jpg|thumb|A group of Japanese captured during the [[Battle of Okinawa]]]]
Although thousands of Japanese were taken prisoner, most fought until they were killed or committed suicide. Of the 22,000 Japanese soldiers present at the beginning of the [[Battle of Iwo Jima]], over 20,000 were killed and only 216 were taken prisoner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Morison | first = Samuel Eliot | authorlink = Samuel Eliot Morison | origyear = 1960 | year = 2002 | title = Victory in the Pacific, 1945 |series=Volume 14 of ''[[History of United States Naval Operations in World War II]] | publisher = University of Illinois Press | location = Urbana, Illinois | isbn = 0-252-07065-8 | oclc = 49784806}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the 30,000 Japanese troops that defended [[Saipan]], fewer than 1,000 remained alive at battle's end.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historynet.com/battle-of-saipan.htm Battle of Saipan], historynet.com&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese prisoners sent to camps fared well; however, some Japanese were killed when trying to surrender or were massacred&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/japan/1495651/American-troops-murdered-Japanese-PoWs.html American troops 'murdered Japanese PoWs'], "American and Australian soldiers massacred Japanese prisoners of war" according to The Faraway War by Prof Richard Aldrich of Nottingham University. From the diaries of Charles Lindberg: as told by a US officer, "Oh, we could take more if we wanted to", one of the officers replied. "But our boys don't like to take prisoners." "It doesn't encourage the rest to surrender when they hear of their buddies being marched out on the flying field and machine-guns turned loose on them." On Australian soldiers attitudes [[Eddie Stanton]] is quoted: "Japanese are still being shot all over the place", "The necessity for capturing them has ceased to worry anyone. Nippo soldiers are just so much machine-gun practice. Too many of our soldiers are tied up guarding them."&lt;/ref&gt; just after they had surrendered (see [[Allied war crimes during World War II#The Pacific|Allied war crimes during World War II in the Pacific]]). In some instances, Japanese prisoners were tortured by a variety of methods.&lt;ref name=cnn19969623&gt;{{cite news | url=http://edition.cnn.com/WORLD/9609/23/rare.photos/index.html| title=Photos document brutality in Shanghai| publisher=CNN| date=23 September 1996| accessdate=8 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A method of torture used by the Chinese [[National Revolutionary Army]] (NRA) included suspending the prisoner by the neck in a wooden cage until they died.&lt;ref name=cnn19969623/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/WORLD/9609/23/rare.photos/image2.lg.jpg CNN] 23 September 1996&lt;/ref&gt; In very rare cases, some were beheaded by sword, and a severed head was once used as a football by Chinese National Revolutionary Army (NRA) soldiers.&lt;ref name=cnn19969623/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/WORLD/9609/23/rare.photos/image3.lg.jpg CNN] 23 September 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, many Japanese were kept on as [[Japanese Surrendered Personnel]] until mid-1947 and used as forced labour doing menial tasks, while 35,000 were kept on in arms within their wartime military organisation and under their own officers and used in combat alongside British troops seeking to suppress the independence movements in the [[Dutch East Indies]] and [[French Indochina]].

====Italians====
In 1943, Italy overthrew Mussolini and became a co-belligerent with the Allies. This did not mean any change in status for Italian POWs however, since due to the labour shortages in the UK, Australia and the USA, they were retained as POWs there.&lt;ref&gt;Insolvibile Isabella, Wops.

====Cossacks====
On 11 February 1945, at the conclusion of the [[Yalta Conference]], the United States and the United Kingdom signed a Repatriation Agreement with the USSR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fff.org/freedom/0895a.asp |title=Repatriation – The Dark Side of World War II |publisher=Fff.org |accessdate=14 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117182523/http://www.fff.org/freedom/0895a.asp |archivedate=17 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The interpretation of this Agreement resulted in the forcible repatriation of all Soviets ([[Operation Keelhaul]]) regardless of their wishes. The forced repatriation operations took place in 1945–1947.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hillsdale.edu/news/imprimis/archive/issue.asp?year=1988&amp;month=12 |title=Forced Repatriation to the Soviet Union: The Secret Betrayal |publisher=Hillsdale.edu |accessdate=14 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207142426/http://www.hillsdale.edu/news/imprimis/archive/issue.asp?year=1988&amp;month=12 |archivedate=7 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Transfers between the Allies====
The United States handed over 740,000 German prisoners to France, a signatory of the Geneva Convention. The Soviet Union had not signed the Geneva Convention. According to Edward Peterson, the U.S. chose to hand over several hundred thousand German prisoners to the Soviet Union in May 1945 as a "gesture of friendship".&lt;ref&gt;Edward N. Peterson, The American Occupation of Germany, pp 42, 116, "Some hundreds of thousands who had fled to the Americans to avoid being taken prisoner by the Soviets were turned over in May to the Red Army in a gesture of friendship."&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. forces also refused to accept the surrender of German troops attempting to surrender to them in [[Saxony]] and [[Bohemia]], and handed them over to the Soviet Union instead.&lt;ref&gt;Niall Ferguson, "Prisoner Taking and Prisoner Killing in the Age of Total War: Towards a Political Economy of Military Defeat" War in History 2004 11 (2) 148–192 pg. 189, (footnote, referenced to: [[Heinz Nawratil]], Die deutschen Nachkriegsverluste unter Vertriebenen, Gefangenen und Verschleppter: mit einer übersicht über die europäischen Nachkriegsverluste (Munich and Berlin, 1988), pp. 36f.)&lt;/ref&gt; It is also known that 6000 of the German officers who were sent from camps in the West to the Soviets were subsequently imprisoned in the [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]], which at the time was one of the [[NKVD special camps|NKVD special camp]].&lt;ref&gt;"Ex-Death Camp Tells Story of Nazi and Soviet Horrors" NYT, 17 December 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Butler|first=Desmond|title=Ex-Death Camp Tells Story Of Nazi and Soviet Horrors|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/17/world/ex-death-camp-tells-story-of-nazi-and-soviet-horrors.html|accessdate=30 December 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=17 December 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hanoi-taxi-march1973.jpg|thumb|Recently released American POWs from North Vietnamese prison camps in 1973.]]
During the [[Korean War]], the North Koreans developed reputation for severely mistreating prisoners of war (see [[Korean War#Prisoners of war|Crimes against POWs]]). Their POWs were housed in three camps, according to their potential usefulness to the North Korean army. Peace camps and reform camps were for POWs that were either sympathetic to the cause or who had valued skills that could be useful in the army and thus these enemy soldiers were indoctrinated and sometimes conscripted into the North Korean army. The regular prisoners of war were usually very poorly treated. POWs in peace camps were reportedly treated with more consideration.&lt;ref name="Three"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kpows.com/thechineseconnection.html |title=Chinese operated three types of POW camps for Americans during the Korean War |date=April 1997 |accessdate=30 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1952, the 1952 Inter-Camp P.O.W. Olympics were held during 15 and 27 November 1952, in Pyuktong, [[North Korea]]. The Chinese hoped to gain worldwide publicity and while some prisoners refused to participate some 500 P.O.W.s of eleven nationalities took part.&lt;ref name="Adams, 2007, p. 62"&gt;Adams, (2007), p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; They were representative of all the prison camps in North Korea and competed in: football, baseball, softball, basketball, volleyball, track and field, soccer, gymnastics, and [[boxing]].&lt;ref name="Adams, 2007, p. 62" /&gt; For the P.O.W.s this was also an opportunity to meet with friends from other camps. The prisoners had their own photographers, announcers, even reporters, who after each day's competition published a newspaper, the "Olympic Roundup".&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Clarence. (2007).

Of about 16,500 French soldiers who fought at the [[Battle of Dien Bien Phu]] in [[French Indochina]], more than 3,000 were killed in battle, while almost all of the 11,721 men taken prisoner died in the hands of the [[Viet Minh]] on death marches to distant POW camps, and in those camps in the last three months of the war.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=zCVrzwEErzgC&amp;pg=PA388&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Trap Door to the Dark Side]''.

The [[Vietcong]] and the [[North Vietnamese Army]] captured many [[United States Armed Forces|United States service members]] as prisoners of war during the [[Vietnam War]], who suffered from mistreatment and torture during the war. Some American prisoners were held in the prison called the [[Hanoi Hilton]].

Like in previous conflicts, there has been speculation without evidence that there were a handful of American pilots captured by the North Koreans and the North Vietnamese who were transferred to the Soviet Union and were never repatriated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1993-08-29/news/mn-29122_1_korean-war |work=Los Angeles Times |first=Robert |last=Burns |title=Were Korean War POWs Sent to U.S.S.R?

Regardless of regulations determining treatment to prisoners, violations of their rights continue to be reported. Many cases of POW massacres have been reported in recent times, including [[October 13 massacre]] in Lebanon by Syrian forces and [[Massacre of police officers in Eastern Sri Lanka in June 1990|June 1990 massacre]] in Sri Lanka.

In 1982, during the [[Falklands War]], prisoners were well treated in general by both parties of the conflict, with military commanders dispatching 'enemy' prisoners back to their homelands in record time.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.upi.com/Archives/1982/04/27/Falkland-Islands-a-gentlemans-war/9723388728000/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, during the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]], American, British, Italian, and Kuwaiti POWs (mostly crew members of downed aircraft and special forces) were tortured by the Iraqi secret police. An American military doctor, [[Rhonda Cornum|Major Rhonda Cornum]], a 37-year-old flight surgeon captured when her Blackhawk UH-60 was shot down, was also subjected to sexual abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=war story: Rhonda Cornum |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/gulf/war/5.html |work=[[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]] |publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] |accessdate=24 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1990s [[Yugoslav Wars]], [[Serb]] paramilitary forces supported by JNA forces killed POWs at [[Vukovar massacre|Vukovar]] and [[Škabrnja massacre|Škarbrnja]] while [[Bosnian Serb]] forces killed POWs at [[Srebrenica massacre|Srebrenica]].

In 2001, there were reports concerning two POWs that India had taken during the [[Sino-Indian War]], Yang Chen and Shih Liang.

The '''Pushkar Fair''', also called the '''Pushkar Camel Fair''' or locally as '''Kartik Mela''' or '''Pushkar ka [[Mela]]''' is an annual multi-day livestock fair and cultural [[fête]] held in the town of [[Pushkar]] ([[Rajasthan]], [[India]]). The fair starts with the [[Hindu calendar]] month of Kartik and ends on the Kartik Purnima, which typically overlaps with late October and early November in the Gregorian calendar.&lt;ref name="Lochtefeld2002p539"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gladstone2013p179"&gt;{{cite book|author=David L.

The Pushkar fair&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toptraveldestinationsindia.com/2018/03/puskhar-the-exotic-travel-destination-in-rajasthan/ Pushkar Fair, Rajasthan]&lt;/ref&gt; is one of India's largest camel, horse and cattle fairs. Apart from the trading of livestock, it is an important pilgrimage season for Hindus to the Pushkar lake. Pushkar fair has also become a significant tourist attraction for domestic and international travelers, given the cooler season, the abundance of colorful cultural themes.&lt;ref name="Gladstone2013p179"/&gt; Cultural events and competitions include dances, tug of war between women teams as well as men teams, the "''matka phod''", "longest moustache" competition, "bridal competition", camel races and others.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.outlookindia.com/outlooktraveller/destinations/rajasthan-its-fair-time-in-pushkar/ RAJASTHAN: IT'S FAIR TIME IN PUSHKAR], Outlook Traveller (October 26, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/photo-essays/2015-11-25/pushkar-camel-fair-lights-up-the-indian-thar-desert Pushkar Camel Fair Lights Up the Indian Thar Desert], Bloomberg&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Desert Comes Alive Once Again...

Thousands of people go to the banks of the [[Pushkar Lake]] where the fair takes place. Men trade their livestock, which includes camels, horses, cows, sheep and goats.&lt;ref name=imp&gt;[http://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V21_007.gif Pushkar] [[The Imperial Gazetteer of India]], 1909, v. 21, ''p. 1.''&lt;/ref&gt; Rural families shop at the handicraft stalls full of bracelets, clothes, textiles and fabrics. A camel race starts off the festival, with music, songs and exhibitions to follow. Between these events, the most waited for is the test of how the camel is able to bring the items. In order to demonstrate, the men go up on the group of camels one after another.{{cn|date=October 2017}}

Pushkar is in centre-east part of Rajasthan, on the western side of Aravalli mountains. The nearest airport from Pushkar is [[Kishangarh Airport]] in [[Ajmer]], about {{convert|40|km|abbr=on}} northeast. Jaipur is well connected with all the major cities in India. Pushkar is about {{convert|10|km|abbr=on}} from [[Ajmer]], connected via Pushkar road (Highway 58) which goes over the [[Aravalli Range]] mountains. Ajmer is also the nearest major railway station.&lt;ref name="Praveen2006p10"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ennala Praveen|title=Pushkar: moods of a desert town|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=824wAQAAIAAJ|year=2006|publisher=Rupa &amp; Co.|pages=10–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The peak celebrations occur over the last five days from the [[Prabodhini Ekadashi|Kartik ekadashi]] to [[Kartik Poornima]], the [[full moon]] day of [[Kartika (month)|Kartik]] (October–November) in [[Hindu calendar]]. This period sees an influx of Hindu pilgrims who attend the fairs, visit the temples and take a dip in the Pushkar lake.&lt;ref name="Lochtefeld2002p539"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gladstone2013p179"/&gt;

The '''Regensburg lecture''' or '''Regensburg address''' was delivered on 12 September 2006 by [[Pope Benedict XVI]] at the [[University of Regensburg]] in [[Germany]], where he had once served as a professor of [[theology]].  It was entitled "[[Faith and rationality#Views of the Roman Catholic Church|Faith, Reason]] and the University — Memories and Reflections" ({{lang-de|Glaube, Vernunft und Universität — Erinnerungen und Reflexionen}}). The lecture is considered to be among the most important papal statements on world affairs since [[Pope John Paul II|John Paul II]]'s 1995 address to the United Nations, and sparked international reactions and controversy.

In his lecture, the Pope, speaking in [[German language|German]], quoted a passage about [[Islam]] made at the end of the 14th century by [[List of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine (Eastern Roman) emperor]] [[Manuel II Palaiologos]]. As the English translation of the Pope's lecture was disseminated across the world, the quotation was taken out of context and many [[Muslim world|Islamic politicians and religious leaders]] protested against what they saw as an insulting mischaracterization of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5348436.stm BBC Article. ''In quotes: Muslim reaction to Pope'' last accessed 17 September 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC1"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5353208.stm BBC News Article:''Pope sorry for offending Muslims'', last accessed 17 September 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

Mass street protests were mounted in many Islamic countries. The ''[[Majlis-e-Shoora]]'' (Pakistani parliament) unanimously called on the Pope to retract "this objectionable statement".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/personal-view/3632287/The-Popes-message-of-greater-dialogue-achieves-the-opposite.html ''Telegraph'']&lt;/ref&gt; The Pope maintained that the comment he had quoted did not reflect his own views. His statement has been included as a footnote in the official text of the lecture available at Vatican website:
{{quote| In the Muslim world, this quotation has unfortunately been taken as an expression of my personal position, thus arousing understandable [[indignation]].  I hope that the reader of my text can see immediately that this sentence does not express my personal view of the Qur’an, for which I have the respect due to the holy book of a great religion.  In quoting the text of the Emperor Manuel II, I intended solely to draw out the essential relationship between faith and reason.  On this point I am in agreement with Manuel II, but without endorsing his polemic.&lt;ref&gt; Benedict XVI, ''Faith, Reason and the University

The controversial comment originally appeared in the seventh of the 26 ''Dialogues Held With A Certain Persian, the Worthy Mouterizes, in Anakara of Galatia'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://frontpagemagazine.com/Articles/ReadArticle.asp?ID=24446 "The Pope, Jihad and "Dialogue""], ''The American Thinker'', 19 September 2005&lt;/ref&gt; written in 1391 as an expression of the views of Emperor Manuel II, one of the last Christian rulers before the [[Fall of Constantinople]] to the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1453, on such issues as [[forced conversion]], [[religious war|holy war]], and the relationship between [[faith and rationality|faith and reason]]. The passage, in the English translation published by the Vatican, was:
{{quote|Show me just what [[Muhammad]] brought that was new and there you will find things only evil and inhuman, such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached.&lt;ref name=TranslatedLecture&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/speeches/2006/september/documents/hf_ben-xvi_spe_20060912_university-regensburg_en.html "Lecture of the Holy Father - Faith, Reason and the University Memories and Reflections"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120622224153/http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/speeches/2006/september/documents/hf_ben-xvi_spe_20060912_university-regensburg_en.html |date=22 June 2012 }}, ''[[Vatican Publishing House|Libreria Editrice Vaticana]]'', 12 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A better translation of what appeared as key words politically, "Schlechtes und Inhumanes", would have been "bad and inhumane".&lt;ref&gt;The re-translation of "evil and inhuman" into German is "Böses und Unmenschliches".&lt;/ref&gt;

The pope had consulted a [[critical edition]] of this dialogue in the original Greek and with French translation.

==Pope Benedict XVI's lecture==
The [[lecture]] on faith and reason, with references ranging from ancient [[Jew]]ish and [[Greeks|Greek]] thinking to [[Protestantism|Protestant]] theology and modern [[secularity]], focused mainly on [[Christianity]] and what Pope Benedict called the tendency to "exclude the question of [[God]]" from reason. Islam features in a part of the lecture: the Pope quoted a strong criticism of Islam, a criticism Pope Benedict disclaimed as being stated with an "unacceptable" "startling brusqueness, a brusqueness which leaves us astounded".

The author of this criticism was the Byzantine Emperor [[Manuel II Palaiologos]] (or Paleologus) in a 1391 [[dialogue]] with an "educated [[Persian people|Persian]]" (who remained unnamed in all the dialogues), as well as observations on this argument made by [[Theodore Khoury]], the scholar whose edition of the dialog in question the [[pontiff]] was referencing. Pope Benedict used Manuel II's argument in order to draw a distinction between a Christian view, as expressed by Manuel II, that "not acting reasonably is contrary to God's nature", and an allegedly Islamic view, as explained by Khoury, that God transcends concepts such as [[rationality]], and his will, as [[Ibn Hazm]] stated, is not constrained by any principle, including rationality.

As a part of his explication of this distinction, Pope Benedict referred to a specific aspect of Islam that Manuel II considered irrational, namely the practice of [[forced conversion]]. Specifically, the Pope (making clear that they were the Emperor's words, not his own) quoted Manuel II Palaiologos as saying: ''"Show me just what Muhammad brought that was new and there you will find things only bad and inhuman, such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached."''

The pontiff was comparing apparently contradictory passages from the Qur'an, one being that "There is no compulsion in religion", the other being that it is acceptable to "spread the faith through violence". The pontiff argued the latter teaching to be unreasonable and advocated that religious conversion should take place through the use of reason. His larger point here was that, generally speaking, in Christianity, God is understood to act in accordance with reason, while in Islam, God's absolute [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendence]] means that "God is not bound even by his own word", and can act in ways contrary to reason, including self-contradiction. At the end of his lecture, the Pope said, "It is to the great logos, to this breadth of reason, that we invite our partners in the dialogue of cultures."

===Key paragraphs===
Quoted below are the three paragraphs (of sixteen total) which discuss Islam in Pope Benedict's lecture:

{{quote|I was reminded of all this recently, when I read the edition by Professor [[Theodore Khoury]] (Münster) of part of the dialogue carried on — perhaps in 1391 in the winter barracks near [[Ankara]] — by the erudite Byzantine emperor [[Manuel II Palaiologos|Manuel II Palaeologus]] and an educated Persian on the subject of [[Christianity and Islam]], and the truth of both. It was presumably the emperor himself who set down this dialogue, during the [[List of sieges of Constantinople#Ottoman Sieges|siege of Constantinople]] between 1394 and 1402; and this would explain why his arguments are given in greater detail than those of his Persian interlocutor. The dialogue ranges widely over the structures of faith contained in the [[Bible]] and in the [[Qur'an]], and deals especially with the image of God and of man, while necessarily returning repeatedly to the relationship between — as they were called — three "Laws" or "rules of life": the [[Old Testament]], the [[New Testament]] and the Qur'an. It is not my intention to discuss this question in the present lecture; here I would like to discuss only one point — itself rather marginal to the dialogue as a whole — which, in the context of the issue of "faith and reason", I found interesting and which can serve as the starting-point for my reflections on this issue.

In the seventh conversation edited by Professor Khoury, the emperor touches on the theme of the holy war. The emperor must have known that [[Al-Baqara|sura 2, 256]] reads: "There is no compulsion in religion". According to the experts, this is one of the [[sura]]s of the early period, when Mohammed was still powerless and under threat. But naturally the emperor also knew the instructions, developed later and recorded in the [[Qur'an]], concerning holy war. Without descending to details, such as the difference in treatment accorded to those who have the "[[People of the Book|Book]]" and the "[[infidel]]s", he addresses his interlocutor with a startling brusqueness, a brusqueness that we find unacceptable, on the central question about the relationship between religion and violence in general, saying: ''"Show me just what Mohammed brought that was new, and there you will find things only evil and inhuman, such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached".'' The emperor, after having expressed himself so forcefully, goes on to explain in detail the reasons why spreading the faith through violence is something unreasonable. Violence is incompatible with the nature of God and the nature of the soul. "God", he says, "is not pleased by blood — and not acting reasonably is contrary to God's nature. Faith is born of the soul, not the body. Whoever would lead someone to faith needs the ability to speak well and to reason properly, without violence and threats… To convince a reasonable soul, one does not need a strong arm, or weapons of any kind, or any other means of threatening a person with death…

The decisive statement in this argument against violent conversion is this: not to act in accordance with reason is contrary to God's nature. The editor, Theodore Khoury, observes: "For the emperor, as a Byzantine shaped by [[Greek philosophy]], this statement is self-evident. But for Muslim teaching, God is absolutely transcendent. His will is not bound up with any of our categories, even that of rationality." Here Khoury quotes a work of the noted French Islamist [[Roger Arnaldez|R. Arnaldez]], who points out that [[Ibn Hazm|Ibn Hazn]] went so far as to state that God is not bound even by his own word, and that nothing would oblige him to reveal the truth to us. Were it God's will, we would even have to practice idolatry.&lt;ref name="TranslatedLecture"/&gt;}}

*Former Archbishop of Canterbury [[George Carey]] dismissed Muslim charges that the Pope had "rubbished" Islam and stated that "Muslims, as well as Christians, must learn to enter into dialogue without crying 'foul'."&lt;ref&gt;[http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1157913641658&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FPrinter "European leaders back Benedict"]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'', 16 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
*R. Todd Wise, a [[Reformed Church in America]] minister and religious scholar, noted a heavy  reliance on ''[[analogia entis]]'' rather than ''[[analogia fidei]]'' in Pope Benedict XVI's lecture, and suggested a priority for considering "faith as the common ground" in the approach to Islam.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rca.org/page.aspx?pid=2949 ''Perspectives: A Journal of Reformed Thought''], November 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

====Muslim====
* On 13 October 2006, one month to the day after the lecture, 38 Islamic authorities and scholars from around the world, representing [[Islamic schools and branches|all denominations and schools of thought]], joined together to deliver a response in the spirit of open intellectual exchange and mutual understanding, speaking about the "true" teachings of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ammanmessage.com/media/openLetter/english.pdf Open Letter to his holiness Pope Benedict XVI] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090212133714/http://ammanmessage.com/media/openLetter/english.pdf |date=12 February 2009 }} (PDF)&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Ali Bardakoğlu]], the head of the [[Presidency of Religious Affairs|Religious Affairs Directorate]] of Turkey, commented that the Pope's statements "were extraordinarily worrying, very unfortunate, both in the name of Christianity, and in the name of shared humanity," and called on Pope Benedict to either retract or apologize for his conduct. He added "if there is a religious antagonism in the West, it's the responsibility of the logic-ignoring [[Catholic Church|Christian Church]] [sic]", citing historical incidents of religious oppression in [[Europe]] and the [[Americas]]. He also implied that the Pope should consider cancelling his trip to Turkey that was originally planned for November 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2006/09/14/europe/EU_GEN_Turkey_Pope.php "Turkish cleric attacks pope's Islam remarks"], ''[[Associated Press]]'', 14 September 2006 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bardakoğlu later admitted to not having read the Pope's lecture before making his statements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/0,1518,437392,00.html "Türkischer Kritiker hatte Rede nicht gelesen"] ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', 16 September 2006 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Jewish====
* In a letter to the Muslim scholar Sheikh Yusuf al-Qaradawi, [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic]] [[Chief Rabbi]] [[Shlomo Amar]] criticized Benedict's remarks, writing: "our way is to honour every religion and every nation according to their paths, as it is written in the book of prophets: 'because every nation will go in the name of its Lord.'"&lt;ref&gt;[http://haaretz.com/hasen/spages/763593.html "Sephardic chief rabbi criticizes pope's remarks"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060920214536/http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/763593.html |date=20 September 2006 }}, ''[[Haaretz]]'', 17 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The Rabbi went on to denounce [[Persecution_of_Christians#Persecution_of_Christians_in_the_Muslim_world|Islamic violence against Christians]], stating that "Our Muslim brothers would add respect to their religion if they outdid themselves and overcame the feelings of humiliation." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jihadwatch.org/2006/09/chief-rabbi-unhappy-with-popes-condemnation-of-islam.html ]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-religious commentary===
* In an article published in ''[[CounterPunch]]'', author [[Tariq Ali]] said, "The Bavarian is a razor-sharp reactionary cleric. I think he knew what he was saying and why. In a [[Neoliberalism|neo-liberal]] world suffering from environmental degradation, poverty, hunger, repression, a 'planet of slums' (in the graphic phrase of [[Mike Davis (scholar)|Mike Davis]]), the Pope chooses to insult the founder of a rival faith. The reaction in the Muslim world was predictable, but depressingly insufficient."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.counterpunch.org/tariq09162006.html Papal insults – A Bavarian Provocation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060929182055/http://www.counterpunch.org/tariq09162006.html |date=29 September 2006 }} by [[Tariq Ali]] for ''[[CounterPunch]]''. 17 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
* A different view was taken by [[Christopher Hitchens]], who wrote in "Fighting Words" for [[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] web magazine that Pope Benedict "has managed to do a moderate amount of harm—and absolutely no good—to the very tense and distraught discussion now in progress between Europe and Islam." Hitchens also presented what he feels is a problem with the focus of the Pope's speech with respect to Reason: "now its new reactionary leader has really 'offended' the Muslim world, while simultaneously asking us to distrust the only reliable weapon—reason—that we possess in these dark times. A fine day's work, and one that we could well have done without."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slate.com/id/2149863 Papal BullJoseph Ratzinger's latest offense.] by [[Christopher Hitchens]] for [[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]. 18 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Hans Köchler]], head of the Department of Philosophy at the [[University of Innsbruck]] and a leading advocate of civilizational dialogue, wrote in a commentary: "In his lecture preaching the compatibility of reason and faith, Benedict XVI, the scholar, deliberately overlooks the fact that the insights of Greek philosophy — its commitment to the [[logos|λόγος]]  — have been brought to medieval Christian Europe by the great Muslim thinkers of the [[Middle Ages]]. What he calls the 'encounter between the Biblical message and Greek thought' ... was, to a large extent, the result of the influence of Muslim philosophers — at a time when European Christians were totally ignorant of classical Greek philosophy."&lt;ref&gt;[http://i-p-o.org/koechler-Religion_Reason_Violence-16Sept06.htm Religion, Reason and Violence: Pope Benedict XVI and Islam] — [[Hans Köchler]], Statement for the [[International Progress Organization]]. 16 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subsequent Vatican statements==

===Official Vatican declaration===
On 16 September 2006, Tarcisio Bertone, the Secretary of State of the Holy See, released a declaration explaining that the "position of the Pope concerning Islam is unequivocally that expressed by the conciliar document ''[[Nostra aetate]]''" and that "the Pope's option in favour of inter-religious and inter-cultural dialogue is equally unequivocal."&lt;ref&gt;[http://212.77.1.245/news_services/bulletin/news/18815.php?index=18815&amp;lang=en#TRADUZIONE%20IN%20LINGUA%20INGLESE "Traduzione In Lingua Inglesse"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091004143825/http://212.77.1.245/news_services/bulletin/news/18815.php?index=18815&amp;lang=en#TRADUZIONE%20IN%20LINGUA%20INGLESE |date=4 October 2009 }}, ''[[Vatican Publishing House|Libreria Editrice Vaticana]]'', 16 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

====Response to official declaration====
For many Muslim leaders, the declaration on 16 September was insufficient to rectify the situation. A representative for the Muslim Brotherhood rejected the Vatican statement, noting "Has he presented a personal apology for statements by which he clearly is convinced? No."&lt;ref&gt;[http://today.reuters.co.uk/news/articlenews.aspx?type=worldNews&amp;storyID=2006-09-16T125737Z_01_L16665781_RTRUKOC_0_UK-RELIGION-POPE-ISLAM-REACT.xml&amp;archived=False "Pope statement not enough — Muslim Brotherhood"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070506120322/http://today.reuters.co.uk/news/articlenews.aspx?type=worldNews |date=6 May 2007 }}, ''[[Reuters]]'', 16 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; [[Grand Mufti]] [[Abdul-Azeez ibn Abdullaah Aal ash-Shaikh]], [[Saudi Arabia]]'s highest religious authority, called the pope's declaration "lies", adding that they "show that reconciliation between religions is impossible."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.netzeitung.de/spezial/derpapst/440836.html "«Hässliche, unglückliche Äußerungen»: Erdogan fordert Entschuldigung des Papstes"], ''[[Netzeitung]]'', 17 September 2006 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the [[Muslim Council of Britain]] had a more favourable view of the declaration, issuing their own statement on 16 September that the Pope's expression of "sincere regret" was "a good first step."&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/5352040.stm "Pope praised for making apology"], ''[[BBC]]'', 16 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pope's Angelus remarks===
On 17 September, before his regular weekly Sunday [[Angelus#Modern usage|Angelus prayer]], Pope Benedict XVI said:

{{quote| At this time, I wish also to add that I am deeply sorry for the reactions in some countries to a few passages of my address at the University of Regensburg, which were considered offensive to the sensibility of Muslims.

Yesterday, the Cardinal Secretary of State published a statement in this regard in which he explained the true meaning of my words.

Benedict's remarks at his Angelus appearance initially received a mixed yet predominantly negative response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uklatest/story/0,,-6087503,00.html |title=Mixed response to new Pope apology |date=18 September 2006 |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |location=London }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mohammed Sayed Tantawi]], Grand [[Imam]] of [[Al-Azhar Mosque]], Cairo, a [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] institution, stated "We have no objection if the Pope holds another speech and declares publicly that what the Byzantine emperor had said was wrong. At the same time, the Pope has to apologize frankly and justify what he said," [[Mohammed Habib]], deputy leader of the [[Muslim Brotherhood]], Egypt's main Islamic opposition group originally, not long after the Pope's Sunday statements, called them a sufficient apology. However, later in the day, he retracted that statement, saying, "The Pope's comments that downplayed his earlier remarks are not enough.

===Diplomatic initiative===
On 25 September 2006, Pope Benedict XVI held an audience with Muslim diplomats, ambassadors of Muslim countries and members of the Consulta Islamica, the Italian government appointed consultative body on Islamic affairs. The meeting was an effort to mend relations with the Muslim community. Pope Benedict's spokesman, the Rev. [[Federico Lombardi]], said the meeting at [[Castel Gandolfo]], the Pope's summer residence, was "certainly a sign that dialogue is returning to normal after moments of … misunderstanding."&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory?id=2486620 Pope, Muslims Meet in Bid to Defuse Anger]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the session, Pope Benedict XVI reiterated his conviction that the dialogue between Muslims and Christians is "a vital necessity" for the good of a world marked by [[relativism]], one that "excludes the transcendence and universality of reason."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asianews.it/view.php?l=en&amp;art=7309 ASIANEWS Pope: dialogue between Muslims and Christians "a vital necessity"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929083225/http://www.asianews.it/view.php?l=en&amp;art=7309 |date=29 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At this meeting, Pope Benedict expressed "all the esteem and the profound respect that (he has) for Muslim believers."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/speeches/2006/september/documents/hf_ben-xvi_spe_20060925_ambasciatori-paesi-arabi_en.html "Address to the Ambassadors of Countries with a Muslim majority and Muslim communities in Italy"] by Pope Benedict XVI, 25 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Among the ambassadors invited were those from Iraq, Iran, Turkey, Morocco, as well as many other nations and Islamic groups.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/europe/09/25/pope.muslims/index.html Pope: 'Total and profound respect for Muslims'], ''[[CNN]]'', 25 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===English Translation Revision===
Pope Benedict has taken another step to placate anger in the Islamic world over his remarks on holy war, providing a better translation of his original text that re-affirmed that the quotation from a 14th-century Byzantine emperor was not his personal opinion. The original translation said the emperor's remark was "with a startling brusqueness" (some sources incorrectly say "somewhat brusquely" and/or incorrectly state that the original German text did not contain "the mollifying language belatedly inserted into the English-language text").&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Noah, Sept 18 2006.  "Correction: 'What the Pope said.'"  Slate.  http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/hot_document/features/2006/what_the_pope_said/_2.html&lt;/ref&gt; The translation was corrected to better reflect the original German text, "in erstaunlich schroffer, uns überraschend schroffer Form ganz einfach." The corrected English translation added that the phrase "a brusqueness that we find unacceptable." Pope Benedict added in a footnote: &lt;blockquote&gt;In the Muslim world, this quotation has unfortunately been taken as an expression of my personal position, thus arousing understandable indignation. I hope that the reader of my text can see immediately that this sentence does not express my personal view of the Quran, for which I have the respect due to the holy book of a great religion.&lt;ref name=TranslatedLecture /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;He said he cited the text as part of an examination of the "relationship between faith and reason."&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Buck, 2006.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; All the eight [[Madh'hab|schools of thought]] and [[Fiqh|jurisprudence in Islam]] are represented by the signatories, but without representation of the influential Al-Azhar University in Cairo. The 38 signatories to the letter declare that they accept the Pope's "personal expression of sorrow and assurance that the controversial quote did not reflect his personal opinion" and responded to some of the main substantive issues raised in the Pope's treatment of a debate between the medieval Emperor Manuel II Palaiologos and an "educated Persian," including reason and faith; forced conversion; "jihad" vs. "holy war"; and the relationship between Christianity and Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6050156.stm |title=Muslim clerics reach out to Pope |date=14 October 2006 |publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The open letters also provided a surprising answer{{By whom|date=January 2015}} to Manuel II Palaiologos' question, "Show me just what Muhammad brought that was new and there you will find things only evil and inhuman, such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached." It is:
{{quote|What the emperor failed to realize — aside from the fact... that no such command has ever existed in Islam — is that the Prophet never claimed to be bringing anything fundamentally new.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}}}

On 11 October 2007, one year after the release of the open letter to the Pope, a larger group of 138 Muslim scholars, clerics and intellectuals sent another open letter, titled ''A Common Word Between Us and You'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A Common Word |url=http://www.acommonword.com/index.php?lang=en&amp;page=option1 |accessdate=18 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to Pope Benedict and the leaders of other Christian denominations. This letter emphasized that Christians and Muslims worship the same God, and share many values, including living in peace with one's neighbours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Muslim scholars reach out to Pope |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7038992.stm |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=11 October 2007 |accessdate=11 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protests, attacks and threats==
The Pope was actually citing a quotation from Manuel II's writings, not expressing his views. Despite this, demonstrations in the muslim world took place as if the comment, the offending judgement on Islam, was from the Pope himself. No distinction seems to have been drawn in the criticism trumpeted in these demonstrations as Tariq Ramadan (see above) implies. Security was discreetly stepped up around and inside the Vatican City, because of concerns about the possibility of acts of violence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5350882.stm "Vatican braces for Muslim anger"] ''[[BBC]]'', 15 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Thousands of people took part in many protests.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.people.com.cn/200609/16/eng20060916_303423.html "Egyptian Muslims stage demonstration against Pope remarks"] ''[[People's Daily|People's Daily Online]]'' 16 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

At least five churches were attacked by Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza. In the West Bank city of [[Nablus]], [[firebombing]]s left black scorch marks on the walls and windows of the city's [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] and [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox churches]]. At least five firebombs hit the Anglican church and its door was later set ablaze. A group called the Lions of Monotheism claimed responsibility and said the attacks were carried out to protest the pope's speech&lt;ref&gt;but clearly showed complete ignorance of the Pope's position and role in Christianity in that he is neither Greek Orthodox nor Anglican. [http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/763199.html "Report: Rome tightens pope's security after fury over Islam remarks"], ''[[Haaretz]]'', 16 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that day, four masked gunmen doused the main doors of Nablus' Roman and [[Greek Catholic]] churches with lighter fluid, then set them afire. They also opened fire on the buildings, striking both with bullets. In Gaza City, terrorists opened fire from a car at a Greek Orthodox church, striking the facade. Explosive devices were set off at the same Gaza church on Friday, causing minor damage. There were no claims of responsibility for the last three attacks.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060916/ap_on_re_eu/pope_muslims "Five churches bombed and attacked"] ''[[Associated Press]]'' 16 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,214128,00.html Pope Protesters Firebomb 4 West Bank Churches, Open Fire at Fifth]&lt;/ref&gt;

Several organizations, such as [[Al-Qaeda]] and the [[Mujahideen Shura Council (Iraq)|Mujahideen Shura Council]] threatened in a joint statement: "you and the West are doomed as you can see from the defeat in Iraq, [[Afghanistan]], [[Chechnya]], and elsewhere. ... We will break up the cross, spill the liquor and impose the ''[[jizya]]'' tax, then the only thing acceptable is a conversion (to Islam) or (being killed by) the sword. ... God enable us to slit their throats, and make their money and descendants the bounty of the [[Mujahideen]]."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060919/ap_on_re_mi_ea/muslims_pope |title=Iranian leader urges more papal protests |date=18 September 2006 |publisher=[[Yahoo! News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Employees of Ankara's ''Diyanet İşleri Başkanlığı'' (Presidency of Religious Affairs), the state body that organizes Muslim worship in Turkey, asked the authorities on 19 September to open [[Trial (law)|legal proceedings]] against Pope Benedict XVI and to arrest him when he visits the country in November 2006. They said the Pontiff had violated Turkish laws upholding freedom of belief and thought by "insulting" Islam and the Prophet Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/europe/09/19/pope.turks.reut/index.html "Turk workers urge pope's arrest"] ''[[CNN]]'', 19 September 2006] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060919184131/http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/europe/09/19/pope.turks.reut/index.html |date=19 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside [[Westminster Cathedral]], on 18 September 2006, around a hundred protestors held banners which included calls for the Pope's execution, "Pope go to Hell" and "Jesus is the slave of [[Allah]]", "Islam will conquer Rome," and "May Allah curse the Pope." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=405622&amp;in_page_id=1770 The Pope must die, says Muslim]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://catholiclondoner.blogspot.com/2006/09/very-rushed-post.html Just outside Westminster Cathedral today...]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Lashkar-e-Taiba]] in Pakistan has issued a [[fatwā]] asking the Muslim community to kill Pope Benedict for his "[[Islam and blasphemy|blasphemous statement]]" about Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas K. Gugler. "[https://books.google.com/books?id=jENEFvzvrp4C&amp;pg=PA53&amp;lpg=PA53 Pakistan's Jihadiscapes and the Transformation of Lashkar-e Tayba]".&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nun killed===
On 17 September 2006, two [[Somalia|Somali]] gunmen shot and killed a 65-year-old Italian nun, Sister [[Leonella Sgorbati]], working at the Austrian-run children's hospital in the city of [[Mogadishu]], with her Somali bodyguard.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20060917/wl_afp/somaliaunrest_060917121503 "Gunmen Slay Italian Nun"], ''AFP'', 17 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; A senior Somali Islamist, speaking on condition of anonymity, said: "There is a very high possibility the people who killed her were angered by the Catholic Pope's recent comments against Islam"; however, no specific evidence was provided for the motive.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20060917/wl_nm/somalia_italian_pope_dc_1 "Nun's death may be linked to Pope: Somali Islamist"], Reuters&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sheikh Mukhtar Robow]], member of the [[Islamic Courts Union]], said there was a "concrete possibility" that the murder of the nun was "a reprisal for the Pope's remarks on Islam".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,13509-2362945,00.html "Nun shot dead as Pope fails to calm militant Muslims"], Timesonline, 18 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
However, several humanitarian workers and Christian volunteers have been murdered by Islamic gunmen in Somalia, including Italian bishop [[Salvatore Colombo]] shot dead while celebrating mass in [[Mogadishu]] in 1989,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.atma-o-jibon.org/italiano4/rit_bellaspiga5.htm&lt;/ref&gt; [[Graziella Fumagalli]], an Italian medical doctor, killed in 1995 in the [[Tuberculosis|anti-TBC Center]] she was running;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-17894764.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[Annalena Tonelli]] assassinated in 2003 in a unique relief center in [[Borama]], after 33 years of service to the poorest,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.awdalnews.com/wmview.php?ArtID=3854&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Dick and Enid Eyeington]] in 2003.  In all of the aforementioned killings, the assailants were Muslim.

===Attacks on Christians in Iraq===
In Iraq, the flags of [[Flag of Germany|Germany]], [[Flag of Israel|Israel]], and the [[Flag of the United States|United States]], and [[Crucifix|Christian crosses]] and [[effigy|effigies]] of Pope Benedict were burned in [[Basra]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_pictures/5357174.stm In pictures: Fresh anti-Pope protests], [[BBC News]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Iraq has one of the largest Christian minorities in the Middle East, where [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] number about one million. Since the Pope's comments, several churches have been bombed; however, many were being bombed before the Pope's comments starting with the US invasion in 2003 in the power vacuum created by the fall of [[Saddam Hussein]]. A previously unknown [[Baghdad]]-based group, Kataab Ashbal Al Islam Al Salafi (Islamic Salafist Boy Scout Battalions)&lt;ref name=ashbal group=Note&gt;Ashbāl has been mistranslated in the media as Boy Scout. The [[Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic]] defines ''shibl'' (plural ''ashbāl'' اشبال) as meaning "lion cub; a capable young man, brave youth, young athlete." Compare with [[Ashbal Saddam]] (Saddam's Lion Cubs).&lt;/ref&gt; threatened to kill all Christians in Iraq if the Pope does not apologize to Muhammad within three days.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aina.org/news/20060916154058.htm "Christian Killed in Iraq in Response to Pope's Speech: Islamic Website"], ''[[Assyrian International News Agency]]'', 16 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Christian Leaders in Iraq asked their parishioners not to leave their homes, after two Christians were stabbed and killed in Baghdad.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aina.org/news/20060917014616.htm "Second Assyrian Christian Killed in Retaliation for Pope's Remarks"], ''[[Assyrian International News Agency]]'', 17 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

There were reports of writing in church doors stating "If the Pope does not apologise, we will bomb all churches, kill more Christians and steal their property and money." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ekklesia.co.uk/content/news_syndication/article_060929iraq.shtml Violence against Christians grows in Iraq, Ekklesia, 29 September 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Iraqi militia [[Mujahideen Army|Jaish al-Mujahedin]] (Holy Warriors' Army) announced its intention to "destroy their cross in the heart of Rome… and to hit the Vatican."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/0,1518,437461,00.html "Vatikan verschärft Sicherheitsvorkehrungen"], ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', 16 September 2006 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the Pope's comments dying down in the media, attacks on [[East Syrian Rite|Assyrian Christians]] continued and on 9 October, an Islamic extremist group kidnapped priest [[Ameer Iskander]], in [[Mosul]]. His body was found three days later, decapitated. His relatives have said that his Muslim captors had demanded his church condemn the pope's comments about Islam (which it already had) and pay a $350,000 ransom.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aljazeera.com/archive/2006/10/2008410112440673544.html Iraq priest "killed over pope speech"], [[Al Jazeera|Aljazeera.net]], 12 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversial statements about Qur'an chapter 2==
Another point of controversy, widely covered in [[Arab]] [[News media|media]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asharqalawsat.com/leader.asp?section=3&amp;issue=10166&amp;article=384904&amp;search=%E3%C7%E4%E6%ED%E1&amp;state=true The other side of the coin.

Many [[Scholarly method|scholar]]s of Islam have taken this as a classification of the sura as stemming from the earlier [[Meccan sura|Meccan period]] and have shown the Pope to be mistaken by pointing out that Surah 2 was [[Wahy|revealed]] in various stages and that [[Al-Baqara 256|this verse]] was revealed after Muhammad's [[Hijra (Islam)|hijra]] from [[Mecca]], during his period of stay in [[Medina]] and hence is from the [[Medinan sura|Medinan period]] which was the final stage of the [[revelation]] of the Qur'an when the Muslims were becoming numerous and increasingly powerful and safe from the immediate dangers that had overshadowed them for 13 years in Mecca. The scholars also point out that the Pope failed to mention that even if this verse was revealed when the Muslims were weak, they could have easily abrogated it with another verse which gave them permission to forcefully convert people once they finally [[Conquest of Mecca|conquered Mecca]]; this, however, did not happen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elcorresponsal.com/modules.php?name=ElCorresponsal_Articulos&amp;file=articulo&amp;req_sectionid=1&amp;req_articleid=1681 Lapsus ratisbonæ, by Pablo Tornielli]. (Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assessment of the lecture's purpose==
In contrast to the [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy]], the media focus was not on the issues of [[Freedom of speech|free speech]] or injured religious sensitivities. Underlying the widely talked about question of whether or not the Pope should apologize, and whether or not his subsequent statements even constituted an apology, several competing and separate interpretations of his intentions have been proffered. These are, broadly and in no particular order:

* Responses to the speech ignore the fact that the Vatican advised against the US led invasion of Iraq, supports Turkey's entry into the EU,&lt;ref&gt;[http://euobserver.com/9/24163]&lt;/ref&gt; supports allowing Muslims in France the freedom to wear headscarves,&lt;ref name="thetablet.co.uk"&gt;[http://www.thetablet.co.uk/article/2848 ]&lt;/ref&gt; and has been part of a long campaign to promote basic human rights for Christians in Muslim dominated countries where they are persecuted and killed ([[Sudan]], [[Somalia]], post-war [[Iraq]]) or marginalized (most of the rest of the Islamic world including secular Turkey{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}).
* The lecture was claimed by many Catholic apologists to not be directed at Islam at all and the incendiary passages were purely circumstantial to the lecture's real intention, which was to counter the demotion of theology in the university environment in particular and of faith in a society plagued by [[Postmodernism|postmodern]] relativism and irrationality in general.&lt;ref&gt;However, observers note that the Pope insisted on keeping such comments in his speech even after his handlers advised him against it. According to Israeli analyst [[Uri Avnery]], this "quote serves exactly the requirements of .... George Bush II. He, too, wants to unite the Christian world against the mainly Muslim "Axis of Evil". Moreover, the Turks are again knocking on the doors of Europe, this time peacefully. It is well known that the Pope supports the forces that object to the entry of Turkey into the European Union."  The Pope has actually called for allowing Turkey into the European Union and spoke against the US invasion of Iraq.  Moreover, this non-Christian analyst cited above, Uri Avnery, fails to understand that Catholics and Evangelicals are philosophically fundamentally different and disagree on many issues.  The blatantly false comment by Uri Avnery could also be seen as an attempt to ignore the deeply seated conflict in the Islamic world with Israel and blame everything on the Pope who has not commanded a military force in nearly 500 years.

From Faith, Adding a Blunt Footnote on Jihad'], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 13 September 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1157913654774&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull 'Benedict XVI's background is theological, not diplomatic']{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'', 18 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oe-weigel20sep20,0,3015856.story?coll=la-opinion-rightrail 'The Pope Was Right'], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', 20 September 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

*Pope Benedict's lecture was a "calculated risk," a move designed to win the hearts of the Christians of the [[Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox Church]] who are surrounded by Muslims and whom Pope Benedict would be visiting in November 2006. Given what he sees as close theological affinities between these two churches and other personal characteristics specific to Pope Benedict (traditional [[liturgy]]; criticism of historical-critical approach to biblical studies), "some form of reunion is not only feasible; from Benedict's point of view, it is highly desirable."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/09/29/opinion/edberwick.php '' Sailing to Byzantium''], ''International Herald Tribune'', 29 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,2187656,00.html ''Calculated Risk''], ''[[Deutsche Welle]]'', 27 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
* Pope Benedict's lecture portends a parting from the Vatican's previous policies on dialogue with Islam, away from promoting [[harmony]] at all costs towards more reciprocity; that is, he wants the Muslim world opened up for Christian [[Mission (Christian)|missions]] in the same way that Europe is open to Muslims and [[Religious conversion|conversion out of Islam]] to be a [[Law|legal]] or [[social]] possibility. In this view, according to the Pope, the position of Christians in [[List of Muslim majority countries|Muslim-majority countries]] must be improved. However, observers note that Europe is not run as a Christian state but from the principles of [[Liberalism|liberal]] [[secularism]] which can be traced to the [[Age of Enlightenment]], which was inspired in part by the region's Christian principles though sometimes at odds with Church authorities.  It was also the Papal Fleet at the [[Battle of Lepanto (1571)|Battle of Lepanto]] that protected Europe's growth by preventing a massive Ottoman invasion of Europe in 1571. European countries must allow all people regardless of religion the ability to build [[Place of worship|places of worship]] due to the [[Secularity|secular]] nature of European constitutions.  Some European countries disallow the wearing of Muslim scarves, something the Catholic church has condemned these governments for.&lt;ref name="thetablet.co.uk"/&gt; One must also be aware that most Muslim countries are ruled by secular [[dictatorship]]s, though many also allow Islamic law [[Sharia]] to govern.
* Professor Graham Macaleer has written that [[Pope Benedict XVI]]'s [[Regensburg_lecture| Regensburg Address]] is a commentary on the book by [[Erich Przywara]] Analogia Entis&lt;ref&gt;Graham Macaleer, ''All Valid Law is Analogical'', [http://www.libertylawsite.org/book-review/all-valid-law-is-analogical/]&lt;/ref&gt; "''Where the logic of law is either equivocal'' (e.g., as in Islam) '' or univocal'' (e.g., as in secular law of the Enlightenment)'', terror ensues.''"

The inaugural series was staged in 1967 as the '''SCCA Grand Prix Championship'''.&lt;ref name=my5000_67_69&gt;[http://www.myf5000.com/files/67_69.pdf 1967-69 SCCA Grand Prix Championship Review, www.myf5000.com] Retrieved on 17 June 2014&lt;/ref&gt; It was open to the SCCA's existing [[Formula A]], [[Formula B]] and [[Formula C (SCCA)|Formula C]] cars, which were restricted to maximum engine capacities of 3 liters, 1.6 liters and 1.1 liters respectively.&lt;ref name=Kopfler_7&gt;Wolfgang Kopfler, Formula A and Formula 5000 in America – Race by Race, Second Edition, 2003, page 7&lt;/ref&gt; For 1968, the SCCA amended their Formula A regulations to allow the use of production-based [[V8 engine]]s, restricted to a 5-liter maximum engine capacity, in addition to the existing 3 liter engines.&lt;ref name=Kopfler_7/&gt;

For 1969 the series was renamed to the '''SCCA Continental Championship''',&lt;ref name=my5000_67_69/&gt; with the Formula A cars now contesting a separate feature race at each championship event and the Formula B &amp; C cars competing in their own race for separate points.&lt;ref name=Kopfler_20&gt;Wolfgang Kopfler, Formula A and Formula 5000 in America – Race by Race, Second Edition, 2003, page 20&lt;/ref&gt; The championship received substantial sponsorship from [[Liggett &amp; Myers|L&amp;M Cigarettes]] for 1970.&lt;ref name=Kopfler_34&gt;Wolfgang Kopfler, Formula A and Formula 5000 in America – Race by Race, Second Edition, 2003, page 34&lt;/ref&gt; Increased support from L&amp;M saw the championship renamed to become the '''SCCA L&amp;M Continental 5000 Championship''' for 1971,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalspeedsportnews.com/racing-history/torn-from-the-headlines/tobacco-money-makes-its-move-into-auto-racing/ Keith Waltz, ''Tobacco Money Makes Its Move Into Auto Racing'', www.nationalspeedsportnews.com] Retrieved on 17 June 2014&lt;/ref&gt; the ''5000'' component of the name chosen to give the 5 liter formula greater international recognition.&lt;ref name=Kopfler_49&gt;Wolfgang Kopfler, Formula A and Formula 5000 in America – Race by Race, Second Edition, 2003, page 49&lt;/ref&gt; As of 1972, the Formula A regulations still permitted both 5000cc restricted and 3000cc unrestricted engines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mclaren-m18-06.com/wp-content/gallery/1972-race-programs-and-press-kits/watkins_glen_1972_press_packet_c.jpg ''Watkins Glen L&amp;M Grand Prix Facts Sheet'', mclaren-m18-06.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140421083907/http://mclaren-m18-06.com/wp-content/gallery/1972-race-programs-and-press-kits/watkins_glen_1972_press_packet_c.jpg |date=21 April 2014 }} Retrieved on 19 June 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Sponsorship by the L&amp;M cigarette brand was not carried forward from the 1973 championship.&lt;ref name=Kopfler_80_81&gt;Wolfgang Kopfler, ''1974 Formula 5000 Championship'', Formula A and Formula 5000 in America - Race by Race, 2003, pages 80 &amp; 81&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Signature forgery''' refers to the act of [[forgery|falsely replicating]] the [[signature]] of another person.

==Methods==
Several different methods can be used to forge signatures. One method is the "freehand method", whereby the forger, after careful practice, replicates the signature by freehand. Although a difficult method to perfect, this often produces the most convincing results.&lt;ref name=Jackson&gt;{{cite book|last=Jackson|first=Andrew R. W.|title=Forensic Science|year=2007|publisher=Pearson Education|pages=235–238}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the "trace-over method", the sheet of paper containing the genuine signature is placed on top of the paper where the forgery is required. The signature is [[tracing paper|traced over]], appearing as a faint indentation on the sheet of paper underneath. This indentation can then be used as a guide for a signature.&lt;ref name=Jackson/&gt;

==Detection==
A number of characteristics can suggest to an examiner that a signature has been forged, mostly stemming from the forger focusing on accuracy rather than fluency. These include:&lt;ref name=Jackson/&gt;
* Shaky handwriting
* Pen lifts
* Signs of retouching
* Letter proportions
* Very close similarity between two or more signatures

'''The State Fair of West Virginia''' is an annual [[state fair]] for [[West Virginia]], [[United States]]. It is held annually in mid-August on the State Fairgrounds in [[Fairlea, West Virginia|Fairlea]], near [[Lewisburg, West Virginia]] in the southeastern part of the state. The 2018 Fair runs from August 9- 18.  The State Fairgrounds consists of a large open field for carnivals and exhibitions, a horse track, grandstands, and several exhibition buildings. Free parking is provided adjacent to the fairgrounds and, until 2006, free camping was also available in a large field with running-water toilets and showers, but no hookups. Campers are now charged a small fee.

==History==

The first event to be called the State Fair occurred in [[Wheeling, West Virginia|Wheeling]] on February 1, 1881.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Where a = 2007-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lewisburg fair evolved from local events that date back to 1854.  In 1941 the state government declared it to be the official State Fair.  However, [[World War II]] forced cancellation of the event until 1946.  The [[Meadow River Lumber Building]] was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1997.&lt;ref name="nris"&gt;{{NRISref|version=2010a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current activities==

By the standards of large states with a more [[agricultur]]al economies, the West Virginia event is relatively small.  It lasts over eight days.  It features a traveling [[carnival]] with various rides, competitive exhibitions by [[farmer]]s and [[4-H]] and [[National FFA Organization|FFA]] members, [[harness racing]] (no gambling is currently allowed), exhibitions by [[manufacture]]rs of [[farm machinery]] and [[industrial tools]], and a nightly [[concert]] performed by popular artists.  Higher stakes [[Bingo (US)|Bingo]] is conducted at the fair than is normally permitted under state law.  A [[beauty queen]] is selected.  In [[politics|political years]], elaborate displays by candidates and [[political party|political parties]] are also a part of the fair. Midway Rides are provided by the Orange unit of [[Reithoffer Shows]]. 

The 2006 fair generated 174,438 paid admissions, which was the highest number since 2002.  Adding children under five (who are admitted free) and various other complementary admissions brings the estimated attendance to 210,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title = Successful Year for the State Fair of West Virginia | url = http://statefairofwv.com/sf/docs/2006Attendance.pdf | publisher = State Fair of West Virginia | format = PDF | date = August 25, 2006 | accessdate = 2007-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the completion of [[Interstate 64]] in 1988 the fairground was difficult to access from most of the state and the event was much more local in nature. However, it has grown greatly since that time.

The Fair is a [[non-profit]] organization under section [[501(c)(3)]] of the U.S. [[Internal Revenue Code]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Search for Charities, Online Version of Publication 78 | url = https://apps.irs.gov/portal/site/pub78/template.MAXIMIZE/menuitem.72f1796ad102792acd9e6be24937a759/?javax.portlet.tpst=289c57ca6035546c47564fe84937a759_ws_MX&amp;javax.portlet.begCacheTok=token&amp;javax.portlet.endCacheTok=token | publisher = Internal Revenue Service}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Fair does not release its financial statements to the public, managers claim that it operates on a "small margin."  According to a 2006 report commissioned by the Fair, it has an annual economic impact of $8.9 million on Greenbrier County.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Christian | last = Giggenbach | title = ’06 State Fair had $8.9 million economic impact on Greenbrier | url = http://www.register-herald.com/business/local_story_319222839.html?keyword=secondarystory | work = The Register-Herald | publisher =  | date = November 15, 2006 | accessdate = 2007-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fair receives no appropriation from the state, supporting itself from admissions, fees charged to vendors, and rental of the fairgrounds to other groups.  It does receive support in kind from the state Department of Agriculture and from [[West Virginia University]].

'''Studniówka''' ({{IPA-pl|stuˈdɲufka}}) is a traditional [[Ballroom dance|ball]] for final grade [[high school]] (''[[lyceum|liceum]]'' or ''[[Technikum (Polish education)|technikum]]'') students (i.e. aged 18&amp;ndash;20) in [[Poland]], analogous to senior [[prom]] in the [[United States]]. It is held approximately a hundred days before the ''[[Polish matura|matura]]'', or leaving exam; hence its name, which is a [[Polish language|Polish]] noun formed from the adjective ''studniowy'', meaning "hundred-day" (compare ''sto dni'', "a hundred days").

The ball is usually organized by parents who also pay most of the costs. The choice of venue depends mostly on the funds &amp;ndash; it may be the school gym, but also an expensive hotel, or even a palace or castle. The ball is attended by students and their dates, teachers, and &amp;ndash; sometimes &amp;ndash; parents.

The attire is formal; this means [[Suit (clothes)|suits]] with [[necktie]]s (not [[tuxedo (clothing)|tuxedo]]s) for boys, and [[evening gown]]s for girls. Additionally, girls may don red [[lingerie]] underneath, which is believed to bring good luck at the exams; boys may also wear red [[underpants]], but this is less common.

''Studniówka'' customarily starts with a dinner, usually followed by a toast with [[Champagne (wine)|champagne]]. This is normally the first occasion when students and their teachers officially drink alcohol together.

The first dance is almost invariably a [[polonaise]], which students usually have to practice before the ball, followed by more modern dances. A popular competition during the party is a contest for the one who can dance longest holding his partner in the arms. During this contest, the tiniest girls around are particularly popular with boys.

Apart from the red underwear, the ball may be associated with many other superstitious practices, such as jumping on one leg around a monument &amp;ndash; all of which are supposed to help students pass their ''matura''.

A '''swimsuit competition''', more commonly now called a '''bikini contest''', is a [[beauty pageant|beauty contest]] in which one of the judging criteria is the [[physical attractiveness|physical attributes]] of contestants, which is judged and ranked while contestants wear a [[swimsuit]], typically a [[bikini]].

Bikini contests may be organised or sponsored by related companies for marketing purposes or to try to find and attract new talent to promote their products,&lt;ref name=adage&gt;{{cite news |url=http://adage.com/article/sound-vision-music/inside-line-homemade-bikini-contest-marks-12th-year/58172/ |title = Inside Line: Homemade bikini contest marks 12th year |work=Advertising Age |publisher = Crain Communications Inc. |date = May 29, 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; masquerading as mild [[adult entertainment]] in the forms of a beauty contest. Swimwear competitions have been a part of [[beauty pageant]]s, such as the [[Miss America]] and [[Miss World]] pageants and by organizations such as [[Hawaiian Tropic]], and may also be held in a bar or nightclub, during intermissions of boxing or wrestling matches or at a car show. Bodybuilding and fitness competitions have evolved to include a bikini division. Participants in such contests may be competing for prizes including trophies, money, and modeling contracts.

== History ==
In the United States, beauty pageants of women in bathing costumes became popular from the 1880s. However, such events were not regarded as  respectable. Beauty contests became more respectable with the first modern "[[Miss America]]" contest held in 1921, though less respectable beauty contests continued to be held.

Public swimsuit competitions are subject to local [[Morality|decency]] laws, which generally require [[nipple]]s and [[labia]] to be covered. More specific standards of dress or [[nudity]] may be determined by the contest organisers. Contestants may be permitted or required to wear certain types of [[bikini]], such as the [[microkini]] (a bikini consisting of a minimal top and [[thong (clothing)|thong]]). Contest organisers may also specify the contestants' age range. In many contests the winners are determined by a panel of judges, but in some cases formal judging is absent and the winner is decided by popular vote. Announcers often present the competition, and they may also help the contestants to connect with the crowd. Winning over the crowd is of principal importance for many competitions, as results can be heavily influenced by audience input.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

Bikini contests may be organised or sponsored by related companies for marketing purposes or to try to find and attract new talent to promote their products.&lt;ref name=adage /&gt; [[Miss Hawaiian Tropic]] is organized by [[Playtex]] to promote "[[Hawaiian Tropic]]", its suntan lotion. NOPI runs the annual [[Hot Import Nights]] bikini contest, which is held in conjunction with the import car-show in [[Atlanta, Georgia]], and the annual [[Hooter's]] bikini competition.

There are some swimsuit competitions which aim to judge the beauty of a single part of body, such as female [[buttocks]] (for example, the [[Miss Bum Bum]] contest held in Brazil, and the [[Miss Reef]] contest held in several South American countries).&lt;ref name="FTDaily_Mail_October_26_2014c"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2718984/Brazils-finest-assets-Country-unveils-27-women-set-compete-annual-Miss-Bum-Bum-contest.html |title=Brazil's finest assets on show: Country unveils the 27 women set to compete in its annual Miss Bum Bum contest |newspaper=Daily Mail |date= August 7, 2014 |author=Sophie Jane Evans |accessdate=October 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies ==
Despite their popularity and women's voluntary participation, swimsuit competitions, especially bikini contests, may be controversial. Critics argue that beauty contests reinforce the idea that girls and women are primarily valued for their physical appearance, and that this puts pressure on women to conform to conventional beauty standards by spending time and money on [[fashion]], [[cosmetics]], [[hair styling]] and even [[cosmetic surgery]]. It depletes their bodies of nutrients, energy and even water at the end and expresses a totally unrealistic and unsustainable lifestyle, centered purely around how little fat and how much spray tan they have on. This pursuit of physical beauty even encourages some women to diet to the point of harming themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beauty and body image in the media|publisher=Media Awareness Network|accessdate=2009-01-17|url=http://www.media-awareness.ca/english/issues/stereotyping/women_and_girls/women_beauty.cfm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090118094138/http://www.media-awareness.ca/english/issues/stereotyping/women_and_girls/women_beauty.cfm|archivedate=18 January 2009|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reigning Miss Universe Suspected of Having Cosmetic Surgery|accessdate=2010-08-23|url=http://cosmeticsurgerytoday.wordpress.com/2009/08/29/reigning-miss-universe-suspected-of-having-cosmetic-surgery/| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100826000856/http://cosmeticsurgerytoday.wordpress.com/2009/08/29/reigning-miss-universe-suspected-of-having-cosmetic-surgery/| archivedate= 26 August 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Plastic Surgery: Bollywood, Miss Universe, and the Indian Girl Next Door|publisher=Gujarati Magazine (Sandesh)|accessdate=2010-08-23|url=http://www.shahfacialplastics.com/media/plastic_surgery_bollywood.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Miss World contest ===
The first Miss World contest was organized by [[Eric Morley]] in 1951 as a promotion for swimwear at the [[Festival of Britain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1= Elissa |last1=Stein |first2=Lee |last2= Meriwether |title=Beauty Queen |page=45 |publisher=Chronicle Books |year= 2006|isbn=0-8118-4864-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Susan |last= Dewey |title=Making Miss India Miss World|page=46|publisher=Syracuse University Press|year= 2008|isbn=0-8156-3176-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The press welcomed the spectacle and referred to it as ''Miss World''.&lt;ref name="Keith Lovegrove 1967"&gt;{{cite book |first=Keith |last=Lovegrove|title=Pageant: The Beauty Contest|page=1967|publisher=teNeues|year=2002|isbn= 3-8238-5569-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the winner [[Kiki Håkansson]] from Sweden was crowned in a bikini, countries with religious traditions threatened to withdraw delegates. The bikinis were outlawed and [[evening gown]]s introduced instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Han |last=Shin |title=Beauty with a Purpose|page= 193 |publisher=iUniverse|year=2004|isbn= 0-595-30926-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Håkansson remains the only Miss World crowned in a bikini,&lt;ref name="Keith Lovegrove 1967" /&gt; a crowning that was condemned by the [[Pope]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Selvedge: The Fabric of Your Life|page=39|publisher= Selvedge Ltd. |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bikini was banned from Miss World beauty pageants after the controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Ben |last1=Marcus|first2=Jeff |last2=Divine |title=Surfing USA!: An Illustrated History of the Coolest Sport of All Time |page= 60|publisher=MVP Books|year=2005|isbn= 978-0-89658-690-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=magnanti&gt;{{cite web|last=Magnanti|first=Brooke|title=Miss World bikini ban: why it's no victory for feminists|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/sex/10105935/Miss-World-2013-bikini-ban-why-its-no-victory-for-feminists.html|publisher=Telegraph|accessdate=22 August 2013 |date=7 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bikinis reappeared in later contests amid additional controversy. In the 1970s and 1980s the contest was regularly picketed by feminist protesters.&lt;ref name=magnanti /&gt; The pageant disappeared for a while and in 1996, when the Miss World contest was held in [[Bangalore]], India, dozens of Indian groups opposed to the event claimed that the contest degraded women by featuring them in bikinis. Social activist Subhashini Ali commented, "It's not an IQ test. Neither is it a charity show. It's a beauty contest in which these things have been added on as sops." The protests were so intense that the organizers were finally compelled to shift the venue of the "Swimsuit Round" to [[Seychelles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9611/23/miss.world/index.html | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031217161734/http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9611/23/miss.world/index.html |title=Miss Greece now Miss World, despite pageant protests |publisher=CNN |date=23 November 1996 |archivedate= 17 December 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Anita |last=Pratap |url=http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9611/22/india.miss.world/index.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030404132350/http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9611/22/india.miss.world/index.html |title=Indian police prepare for worst in beauty pageant clash  |publisher=CNN|date=22 November 1996 | archivedate= 4 April 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9611/17/miss.world/index.html|title= Beauty pageant in India becomes a contest of wills  |first=Anita |last=Pratap |publisher=CNN |date= 17 November 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Countering these claims, the contest organizer says that the organization has raised ₤300 million for charity in many of the countries where it operates since 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-business/10067778/Miss-World-owner-Julia-Morley-How-a-mother-and-housewife-gave-the-beauty-pageant-a-positive-legacy.html  |title=Miss World owner: How a mother and housewife gave the beauty pageant a positive legacy |accessdate=21 August 2013 |date=20 May 2013 |first=Emma |last=Sinclair}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the Miss World event was hosted by Indonesia, the world's largest Muslim-majority country. The country's top Muslim clerical body, the Indonesian Ulema Council, suggested that the event should be cancelled because it promotes "hedonism, materialism, and consumerism," and is nothing but "an excuse to show women's body parts that should remain covered." The organizers later announced that the bikini would be replaced by [[one-piece swimsuit]]s and [[sarong]]s, traditional beachwear on the resort island of [[Bali]]. Pageant Chairwoman Julia Morley explained, "I do not want to upset or get anyone in a situation where we are being disrespectful."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Miss World Beauty Pageant Bans Bikinis|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2013/06/10/miss-world-beauty-pageant_n_3415087.html|publisher=The Huffington Post|accessdate=June 14, 2013|date=June 10, 2013|quote=The bikini segment is one of the cornerstones of the Miss World Beauty Pageant but the 2013 event will not be featuring them.

Critics accuse the Miss World organizers of caving to extremist pressures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lewis|first=Leo|title=Miss World contest cuts bikini round to appease Muslim world|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/world/asia/article3784468.ece|publisher=Times Newspapers Limited|accessdate=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They point out that Bali is a destination for tourists from across the world who often wear minimal swimwear.&lt;ref name=theweek&gt;{{cite web|title=The controversial bikini ban at the Miss World beauty pageant|url=http://theweek.com/article/index/245346/the-controversial-bikini-ban-at-the-miss-world-beauty-pageant|accessdate=22 August 2013 |first=Harold |last=Maass |date= 7 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brooke Magnanti argued that the decision to yield to religious fundamentalists was not a victory for [[feminism]]:

{{quote|While no great fan of pageants there's something about this that rubs the wrong way. For some time it's been clear that the interests and tactics of certain types of feminism and certain types of religious fundamentalism not only converge, but seem to complement each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Magnanti|first=Brooke|title=Miss World bikini ban: why it's no victory for feminists|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/sex/10105935/Miss-World-2013-bikini-ban-why-its-no-victory-for-feminists.html|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=June 14, 2013|date=June 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Donald Trump]], who owned the [[Miss Universe]] beauty pageant until it was acquired by [[William Morris Endeavor]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/ellenkilloran/2015/09/14/donald-trump-owned-miss-universe-miss-usa-pageants-need-a-network-who-will-bite/|title=Donald Trump Sells Miss Universe, Miss USA Pageants To WME/IMG -- But They Still Need A Network|first=Ellen|last=Killoran|date=14 September 2015|website=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt; a competitor to the Miss World contest, was delighted to learn of the rival organization's decision.

=== Miss Earth contest ===

[[Vida Samadzai]] was the 2003 Afghani contestant for the [[Miss Earth]] title. She was severely condemned by the both Afghan authorities and community for seeking the title.&lt;ref name=Gersh&gt;Gersh Kuntzman, "[http://gershkuntzman.homestead.com/files/Beauty_is_a_Beast.htm Beauty is a Beast]", ''Newsweek'', 2003-11-03&lt;/ref&gt;  Samadzai was born in Afghanistan but raised in the United States. She was living in India at the time of the contest.&lt;ref name=Fida&gt;Ayesha Matthan, "[http://www.hindu.com/mp/2007/12/18/stories/2007121850150600.htm Fida over Vida]", ''The Hindu'', 2007-12-18&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Afghan Supreme Court]] banned swimsuit contests and said that appearing naked in beauty contests is completely un-Islamic, and is against Afghan tradition, human honour and dignity. [[Habiba Sarabi]], the Afghan women affairs minister, said Samadzai's  semi-naked appearance "is not women's freedom but in my opinion is to entertain men". Afghanistan's embassy in Washington DC declared that claims by [[Afghan American]] Samadzai to represent Afghanistan is baseless.&lt;ref&gt;News desk, "[http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?click_id=126&amp;art_id=qw1067503501825B212&amp;set_id=1 Afghan Supreme Court bans beauty pageants]", ''Independent Online'', 2003-09-30&lt;/ref&gt; Samadzai, the second woman to be crowned Miss Afghanistan after [[Zohra Daoud]]'s crowning in 1972, received a number of death threats and had to be under the protection of [[FBI]] for three months.&lt;ref name=Gersh /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Farhad J. Dadyburjor, "[http://www.dnaindia.com/report.asp?NewsID=1049966 I was under FBI's watch for 3 months: Miss Afghanistan]", ''Daily News and Analysis'', 2006-06-29&lt;/ref&gt; She said she was a bit uncomfortable wearing the "70s style red bikini" and was aware of the risks involved.&lt;ref name=Fida /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;News Desk, "[http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-19308457_ITM Miss Afghanistan says she was uncomfortable wearing bikini, goal is to help women and children back home]", ''Financial Times'', 2003-11-07&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kimi Yoshino, "[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-87832327.html Causing a stir, all because of a bikini]", ''Times New Service '', 2003-11-28&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Children's bikini contest ===
''Miss Tanguita'', which translates as "Miss Child Bikini", is held in Barbosa, Santader, [[Colombia]] as annual part of the "del Rio Suarez" Festival. The organisers deny the allegations that the competition is a camouflage for sexual exploitation, and instead describe it as an awareness event about the importance of children's fitness. Activists say that the competition, though legal, abuses the human rights of minors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pekanbaru.tribunnews.com/2015/01/14/wah-kontes-ratu-bikini-anak-anak-digelar-di-negara-ini |title=Wah, Kontes Ratu Bikini Anak-anak Digelar di Negara Ini |author=Raya Desmawanto Nainggolan |date=January 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Miss Teen USA ===
Beginning in 2016, the Miss Teen USA pageant removed the swimsuit competition and replaced it with an athleticwear round.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eonline.com/shows/total_divas/news/781840/first-look-see-what-miss-teen-usa-contestants-will-wear-instead-of-bikinis|title=First Look!

'''''The Biograph Girl''''' is a [[musical theatre|musical]] with a book by Warner Brown, lyrics by Brown and [[David Heneker]], and music by Heneker. Its plot focuses on the [[silent film]] era and five pioneers of American cinema - actresses [[Mary Pickford]] and [[Lillian Gish]], [[film director|directors]] [[D. W. Griffith]] and [[Mack Sennett]], and [[Paramount Pictures]] founder [[Adolph Zukor]].

==Plot==
[[Image:BiographGirlProgramme.jpg|left|thumb|Programme from the 1980 West End production]] When Mary Gish and her daughters Lillian and Dorothy recognize their friend Gladys Smith in a film made by the [[American Mutoscope and Biograph Company]], they search for her at the studio headquarters in [[New York City]]. There they discover she has been rechristened Mary Pickford and is known as the Biograph Girl. Before long Lillian and Dorothy are acting in films directed by D.W. Griffith, and when he decides to relocate to Hollywood, he brings the girls and their mother with him.

Lillian is cast in ''[[Birth of a Nation]]'', while Mary decides to leave Griffith in order to work for Adolph Zukor at a substantially higher salary. Eventually she finds herself forced to suppress her growing sophistication in order to maintain the image of innocence her fans have embraced. Shocked by the negative public and industry reaction to ''Birth of a Nation'', Griffith vows to make an [[epic film]] advocating peace and tolerance. 

''[[Intolerance (film)|Intolerance]]'' proves to be an artistic success but a commercial flop.  Griffith's financial woes threaten to end his career until Mary joins him, [[Charles Chaplin]], and [[Douglas Fairbanks]] to form [[United Artists]]. When Griffith's monetary situation fails to improve, he urges Lillian to accept an offer from another studio, and she reluctantly does.

With the arrival of [[sound film]]s in 1927, the industry's pioneers are forced to re-evaluate their careers and make plans for the future.

==Production==
Produced by [[Harold Fielding]], directed by [[Victor Spinetti]], and choreographed by Irving Davies, the musical premiered at the [[Phoenix Theatre (London)|Phoenix Theatre]] in the [[West End theatre|West End]] on 19 November 1980 and closed after 57 performances.&lt;ref name=GMT&gt;[http://www.guidetomusicaltheatre.com/shows_b/biograph_girl.htm ''The Biograph Girl'' at Guide to Musical Theatre]&lt;/ref&gt; The cast included [[Sheila White (actress)|Sheila White]] as Mary Pickford, Bruce Barry as D.W. Griffith, Kate Revill as Lillian Gish, [[Guy Siner]] as Mack Sennett, and Ron Berglas as Adolph Zukor.&lt;ref name=MT&gt;[http://www.musical-theatre.net/html/recordcabinet/biographical/biograph.html ''The Biograph Girl'' at Musical-Theatre.net]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
Veteran theatre critic [[Harold Hobson]] found it to be "a most excellent, delicate and perceptive entertainment, with young players of talent so outstanding that after fifty years of play going I was taken by delighted surprise" and concluded, "I would ask all London to go and see it."&lt;ref name="MT"/&gt;

Francis King of the ''[[Sunday Telegraph]]'' said the score "is always tuneful, witty and sophisticated,"&lt;ref name=GMT /&gt; and Jack Tinker of the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' called it "a sweet lament for lost innocence" and "a minor miracle" and added, "This delightfully unassuming show contains the same naive charm as those early flicks' themselves."&lt;ref name=GMT /&gt; In his review in the ''[[International Herald Tribune]]'', [[Sheridan Morley]] described it as "a joyous celebration of the silent screen ... a delight. It captures moments of sheer exuberant nostalgia."&lt;ref name=GMT /&gt;

'''''The Bomb''''' is a play by Kevin Dyer, focusing on the [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]] [[Brighton bomb]]ing of 1984.

==Plot==
In 2000, [[Jo Berry]], whose father was killed in the blast, met [[Patrick Magee (Irish republican)|Patrick Magee]], the man who planted the bomb. ''The Bomb'' is inspired by the events which led Jo and Patrick to meet and the impact those people had on each other.

It is sourced from interviews, research and actual and imagined dialogue. It is not a [[Verbatim theatre|verbatim play]], but is partly factual and describes real events.

''The Bomb'' has twice toured nationally.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} ''The Bomb'' was nominated for two [[Theatrical Management Association Award|Theatrical Management Awards]].

'''''The League of the Scarlet Pimpernel''''' is a sequel book to the classic adventure tale, ''[[The Scarlet Pimpernel]].'' Written by [[Emma Orczy|Baroness Orczy]] and first published in 1919, the book consists of eleven short stories about Sir Percy Blakeney's exploits in rescuing various aristos and French citizens from the clutches of the guillotine.

The stories, which are listed below, are set in 1793 but appear in no particular order. They occasionally refer to events in other books in the series.

==Contents==

===Sir Percy Explains===
Madeleine Lannoy, whose husband was killed at Versailles defending the Queen from the mob, has become a street dancer in the worst parts of Paris. She has taken on this guise in the hope of finding her only son who has been stolen by Citizen Jean Paul Marat, annoyed by her spurning his advances. All she knows is that her child "is to be reared up in the company of all that is most vile and most degraded in the disease-haunted slums of indigent Paris" and that if she doesn't find him soon he risks becoming a criminal or a drink-sodden reprobate at best.

===A Question of Passports===
Citizen Bibot of the Town Guard has command of the Porte Montmartre – the last commandant there, citizen Ferney, was guillotined for having allowed a whole batch of aristos to escape and find safety outside the walls of Paris. Citizen Marat arrives to warn Bibot to be watchful because the Pimpernel has promised to rescue the Duc and Duchesse de Montreux and their family, (who are on their way to the Conciergerie prison) that very evening, but Bibot is determined that the Scarlet Pimpernel will not get one over on him.

===Two Good Patriots===
Being the desposition of citizeness Fanny Roussell, who was brought up together with her husband, before the Tribunal of the Revolution on a charge of Treason – both being subsequently acquitted.

===The Old Scarecrow===
Nobody in the quartier could quite recollect when it was that citizen Lepine, the new public letter-writer first set up in business at the angle formed by the Quai des Augustins and the Rue Dauphine; but he certainly was there on the 28th day of February 1793, when Agnes, with eyes swollen with tears, a market basket on her arm and a look of dreary despair on her young face, turned that self same angle on her way to the Pont Neuf, and nearly fell over the rickety construction which sheltered him and his stock.

===A Fine Bit of Work===
Pierre Lenėgre had been a footman in the household of Marie Antoinette. After speaking out in favour of the Queen in a public place he was denounced by the [[Committee of Public Safety]] and would have gone to the guillotine had the Scarlet Pimpernel not saved him. Sir Percy is visiting Pierre's parents when he learns that Père Lenègre has been denounced by the concierge Jean Baptiste, who knows Percy often visits them, and that the gendarmes are on their way to arrest him.

===How Jean-Pierre Met the Scarlet Pimpernel===
The Marquis and Marquise de Mortaine and their son le Vicomte are hiding from the Revolutionary Guard in the attic of a house in Lyons. Out of money they have not eaten for two days and the young Vicomte is slowly starving to death. Their loyal servant Jean-Pierre is out looking for milk for the child when he passes out from hunger, awaking to the sound of two men talking in English. He tells the crowd who are after them, which direction they have gone in return for a bottle of wine and a roast capon, but he soon feels like a treacherous coward. Having dropped and broken the precious wine bottle he is rescued by the two strangers who listen to his plight and bring food to the starving aristos. It becomes evident that the Vicomte is very ill and must see a doctor at once, but the only man up to the job is the infamous republican Citizen Laporte, who would certainly send them all to the guillotine.

===Out of the Jaws of Death===
Being a fragment from the diary of Valentine Lemercier in the possession of her great-granddaughter. The Lemercier family have been arrested and imprisoned in a dank vault in the [[Prison de l'Abbaye|Abbaye]]. They have been in prison for a fortnight when they hear in the distance a noise like the rumbling of thunder – it is the start of the September massacres and hundreds of men, women and children are being slaughtered in the prisons. They are convinced they are facing death and it seems the moment they are dreading has arrived, for heavy blows are falling against the masonry around their prison window.

===The Traitor===
November 1793. Lord Kulmsted is a member of the League of the Scarlet Pimpernel, however, for some time he has been an adherent in name only. Whether his embitterment comes from lack of money, or jealously of Sir Percy, his oath of fealty has been broken and the threat of treachery hovers in the air. The Scarlet Pimpernel appears not to heed Kulmsted's disloyalty and, against the wishes of the other league members, includes him in a mission to Paris to rescue some women from the household of Marie Antointte, condemned to die for their loyalty to their martyred queen.

===The Cabaret de la Liberté===
Esther Vincent is the daughter of a wealthy banker who has already been sent to the guillotine. Although her father's house and property was confiscated after his death, the representatives of the people never found the millions which he was supposed to have concealed. Esther is now living in one of the poorer parts of Paris while a number of astute jailbirds are plotting to obtain her money and wealth by forcing her to choose between marrying one of their gang, Citizen Merri, or face death. The Pimpernel takes on the guise of Citizen Rateau, a tall, cadaverous-looking creature, with sunken eyes and broad, hunched up shoulders and a dry rasping cough that proclaimed the ravages of some mortal disease. Can he rescue Esther and her English lover Jack Kennard from the evil plot?

==="Needs Must—"===
Lucile Clamette and her three children are up in front of Commissary Lebel and citizen Chauvelin, who are trying to entrap her former employer, Henri the Vicomte de Montogrueil. Frightened by threats that her children will be sent to a House of Correction on the orders of the [[Committee of Public Safety]], she agrees to write a letter to Henri and his father, the Marquis, as dictated by Chauvelin. The father and son are in possession of some incriminating papers containing evidence of bribes paid to members of the CPS, which have so far allowed them to pass unmolested by the terrorists. If the Marquis hands over the papers they will be soon be arrested and sent to the guillotine but how can he refuse, when Lucile's children are in such danger? Lucile's son runs to the Cabaret de la Liberté to find Citizen Rateau (one of the Pimpernel's recurring alter-egos) and tells him of the family's plight.

===A Battle of Wits===
Tournefort, a sleuth-hound employed by the Committee of Public Safety, is hanging around a house in St Lazare one night when he hears a voice talking to a 'Madame la Comtesse' and discussing how the diamonds she has left in her château can be recovered. Realising that this can only be the wife of the Comte de Sucy, he listens for more details then demands entry to the house to confront and arrest the traitors. The concierge tells Tournefort that he is imagining things and assures him he has seen no aristos. Tournefort doesn't believe him but despite searching the lodge, fails to find any evidence. Determined to steal a march on citizen Chauvelin, Tournefort enlists the help of citizen Gourdon and a gang of ruffians (which includes one Citizen Rateau) and they ransack the château looking for the missing jewellery, however Chauvelin has got wind of the scheme and presently appears on the scene...

'''''The Rear Column''''' is a play by [[Simon Gray]] set  in the jungle of the [[Congo Free State]] in 1887-88.  The story begins after explorer [[Henry Morton Stanley]], has gone to [[Emin Pasha Relief Expedition|relieve Emin Pasha]], governor of [[Equatoria]], from a siege by [[Mahdist War|Mahdist]] forces. He leaves behind him a 'rear column' with supplies at the [[Yambuya]] camp on the [[Aruwimi River]] and instructs them to wait until the Arab slave trader, [[Tippu Tib]], has brought 600 more porters before following on to Equatoria. The play follows the story of the men left waiting in the camp.  The officers depicted in the play are based on historical figures.

The play was first produced in London's [[West End theatre|West End]] in 1978 at the Globe Theatre in London, now known as the [[Gielgud Theatre]].

==Characters==
*James S. Jameson
*John Rose Troup
*William Bonny
*[[Edmund Musgrave Barttelot]]
*Herbert Ward
*[[Henry Morton Stanley]]
*John Henry
*Native woman

==Synopsis==
;Act 1

Bonny, Ward and Troup have just arrived after an arduous journey from London and are disappointed to find that Stanley has gone on ahead. They discover from Major Barttelot that they are to wait for Tippu Tib to bring 600 more porters before they can follow Stanley. The porters already in the camp, Zanzibaris and Soudanese, are diseased and many of them have been flogged for thieving. Ward and Troup are furious when Barttelot refuses to release provisions promised to them in London, on the basis that Stanley has left no explicit orders for them to be released. Later, Barttelot asks Bonny if he can recommend him as unfit for service as he hasn't been sleeping, mistakenly thinking that Bonny is a doctor. Bonny informs Barttelot that he is only a medical orderly, and couldn't make such a recommendation, but is fully in support of the major carrying on his duties. That evening, a goat is cooked especially to mark the arrival of the three officers. Barttelot, under the suggestion of Jameson, offers to give them half their provisions then, and the other half when they meet up with Stanley. The officers agree.

;Act 2

Six months later. Ward is outside performing a flogging.  Jameson is due back from a trip up the river to investigate rumours the Tippu Tib is nearby. Troup complains to Barttelot that Jameson is always absent during floggings and has always voted against them, on the grounds that enough of the porters are dying from disease already. Ward returns  and says he is coming round to Jameson's point of view, and suggests they should try not flogging for a while. Troup agrees, but Bartellot is adamant that they should continue with the floggings, from which many people now have died. Jameson returns with no confirmation of Tippu Tib being near, but he has seen the remains of a [[cannibalism|cannibal]] feast. Troup demands that they talk about what they are going to do, arguing that Stanley couldn't possibly want them to wait indefinitely, particularly as medical supplies are running low. Barttelot insists that they must wait, as they have enough brass rods to pay the porters for another six months. Ward, who has been suffering from a fever, gets quickly worse and asks that Jameson stay next to him as he tries to sleep. A few days later, on Christmas Day, Ward is feeling better, and the officers all enjoy brandy and cigars.

;Act 3

Six months later. A native woman is tied by the neck to a post, suspected of stealing [[morphine]] from the supplies tent while the guards were sleeping on duty. Bonny observes her while Ward makes a sculpture of her. Ward tells Bonny that he knows it was him who stole the morphine to help him sleep. Troup comes in, suffering terribly from a fever. Barttelot enters with two rotting fish, provided by the native woman's husband to buy her back, so he sets her free. Troup asks Barttelot for some [[quinine]] from Stanley's supplies, but Barttelot refuses. Jameson returns from another sortie to report that he has met Tippu Tib, who has promised he will be there in a month with the 600 porters, bringing great relief all round. Jameson then gives Troup his quinine.  Ward suspects that Jameson is lying and when they are alone he quizzes him about the trip.  Jameson admits that while he did meet Tippu Tib, but it was obvious that the promise he gave was a lie. Later that night, Barttelot confesses to Jameson that the day before he had attacked the native woman who beats drums every night in the camp and bitten her in the neck, then afterwards, with blood round his mouth, beaten his servant boy, John Henry. Bonny comes in and looks at Jameson's sketches from his trip. One sketch shows a young native girl tied to a tree. Jameson explains that, as he had never seen a cannibal feast, under Tippu Tib's suggestion he had bought the girl so that she could be given to a cannibalistic tribe, and he could sketch her being killed and eaten. The other men are shocked, and Jameson realises with horror what he has done. Barttelot is furious that, as Jameson had given copies of the sketches to Tippu Tib, the story will get out and his reputation will be ruined. In his rage Barttelot attacks John Henry and kills him, then runs outside to the beating drum where he is shot and killed by the porters. In the final scene of the play, Stanley has arrived, but only Bonny is left in the camp. Jameson has died of illness at a mission house, Ward has gone missing and Troup is on his way back to England.

'''''The White Devil''''' (full original title: '''''The White Divel; or, The Tragedy of Paolo Giordano Ursini, Duke of Brachiano. With The Life and Death of Vittoria Corombona the famous Venetian Curtisan''''') is a [[Revenge play|revenge tragedy]] by English playwright [[John Webster]] (c.1580–c.1634). According to Webster's own preface to the 1612 Quarto Edition, [http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/12915/pg12915-images.html "To the Reader"], the play's first performance in that year was a notorious failure; he complained that the play was acted in the dead of winter before an unreceptive audience. The play's complexity, sophistication, and satire made it a poor fit with the repertory of [[Queen Anne's Men]] at the [[Red Bull Theatre]], where it was first performed. It was successfully revived in 1630 by [[Queen Henrietta's Men]] at the [[Cockpit Theatre]] and published again in 1631.

In 1707 [[Nahum Tate]] published an adaptation of Webster's play titled ''Injured Love'' which was not performed.

==Background==
The story is loosely based on an event in Italy thirty years prior to the play's composition: the murder of [[Vittoria Accoramboni]] in [[Padua]] on 22 December 1585. Webster's dramatisation of this event turned Italian corruption into a vehicle for depicting "the political and moral state of England in his own day",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Webster|first1=John|editor1-last=Russell Brown|editor1-first=John|title=The White Devil|date=1960|publisher=Methuen|location=London|oclc=317509591|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly the corruption in the royal court.

The play explores the differences between the reality of people and the way they depict themselves as good, "white", or pure.

==Characters==
* Monticelso – A Cardinal, later Pope Paul IV.
* Francisco De Medici – Duke of Florence; in Act V disguised as the Moor, Mulinassar.
* Brachiano – Otherwise Paulo Giordano Orsini, The Duke of Brachiano, husband of Isabella, and in love with Vittoria.

* Christophero, One of the line-less "ghost" characters who helps Doctor Julio murder Isabella.

==Basis==
Webster based ''The White Devil'' on newsletter versions of the story of the killing of Vittoria Accoramboni. Such recollections detailed how Vittoria, of a proud but poor family, married the nephew of Cardinal Motalto. In 1580, she met Paolo Giordano Orsini, Duke of Bracciano, previously married to Isabella Medici of the famous [[Medici]] family.

Upon meeting Vittoria, the Duke fell desperately in love with her and arranged for the Cardinal's nephew to be killed in order that he might secretly marry Vittoria. Pope Gregory soon found out and ordered Vittoria and the Duke to part and even resorted to having Vittoria imprisoned in the [[Castel Sant'Angelo]] under the suspicion of having killed her husband.

In 1585 a new pope was elected and amid the confusion of change Vittoria and Bracciano married and left Rome. In the play the Pope is misnamed [[Paul IV]] (he was [[Sixtus V]], Paul IV having died in 1559). Eight months later the Duke died and the Medici family, wishing to protect their family interests, challenged his will, which placed Vittoria to be in charge of his fortune. When Vittoria refused to co-operate, the Medicis arranged for her to be killed. She was stabbed to death in Padua by Ludovico Orsini.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Murphy|first1=Caroline P.|title=Murder of a Medici princess|date=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780195314397|page=346}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot summary==
Count Lodovico is banished from Rome for debauchery and murder; his friends promise to work for the repeal of his sentence. The Duke of Brachiano has conceived a violent passion for Vittoria Corombona, daughter of a noble but impoverished Venetian family, despite the fact they are both married to other people. Vittoria's brother Flamineo, employed as a secretary to Brachiano, has been scheming to bring his sister and the Duke together in the hope of advancing his career. The plan is foiled by the arrival of Brachiano's wife Isabella, escorted by her brother and Cardinal Monticelso. They are both outraged by the rumours of Brachiano's infidelity and set out to make the affair public; before that happens Brachiano and Flamineo arrange to have Camillo (Vittoria's husband) and Isabella murdered.

Vittoria is put on trial for the murder of her husband and although there is no real evidence against her, she is condemned by the Cardinal to imprisonment in a convent for penitent whores. Flamineo pretends madness to protect himself from awkward suggestions. The banished Count Lodovico is pardoned and returns to Rome; confessing he had been secretly in love with Isabella, he vows to avenge her death. Isabella's brother Francisco also plots revenge. He pens a love letter to Vittoria, which falls into the hands of Brachiano. It fuels his jealousy and forces him to elope with Vittoria. Cardinal Monticelso is elected Pope and as his first act he excommunicates Vittoria and Brachiano, who have fled Rome.

Vittoria and Brachiano, now married, hold court in Padua. Three mysterious strangers have arrived to enter Brachiano's service. These are Francisco, disguised as Mulinassar, a Moor, and Lodovico and Gasparo, disguised as Capuchin monks, all conspiring to avenge Isabella's death. They begin their revenge by poisoning Brachiano. As he is dying, Lodovico and Gasparo reveal themselves to him. Next, Zanche, Vittoria's Moorish maid, who has fallen in love with her supposed countryman Mulinassar, reveals to him the murders of Isabella and Camillo and Flamineo's part in them.

Flamineo is banished from court by Brachiano's son Giovanni, the new Duke, and sensing that his crimes are catching up with him he goes to see Vittoria. He tries to persuade her and Zanche to a triple suicide by shooting him, then themelves. Vittoria and Zanche shoot Flamineo and, thinking him dead, exult in his death and their escape. Much to their surprise, Flamineo rises from the 'dead' and reveals to them the pistols were not loaded. While trying to exact his own revenge on Vittoria, Lodovico and Gasparo then enter the scene and complete their revenge by killing them. Giovanni and officers come to the scene and the play ends with Giovanni learning of his uncle's participation in the bloody acts and sending Lodovico off to torture.

==Productions==
The play was written for and first performed by [[Queen Anne's Men]] at the [[Red Bull Theatre]] in [[Clerkenwell]] in the early months of 1612. The troupe usually offered simpler and more optimistic plays of the type written by their dramatist, [[Thomas Heywood]]. The play staged before Webster's seems to have been ''If This Be Not a Good Play'', a [[tragicomedy]] by [[Thomas Dekker (poet)|Thomas Dekker]]. Webster's play failed at its debut. In the prefatory epistle to the quarto, Webster praised the actors, mentioning [[Richard Perkins (17th-century actor)|Richard Perkins]]; but complained of the winter weather and above all of the audience, whose intellect he compared to that of donkeys.

The first successful modern production was that of the [[Marlowe Society]] (ADC Theatre, Cambridge, March 1920), with music by [[C. Armstrong Gibbs]] and with [[Eric Maschwitz]] as Vittoria. The Society specialised in Elizabethan and Jacobean revivals in uncut texts performed with their original economy and rapidity, and with the female roles played by men. "Anybody who enjoys hearing beautiful poetry beautifully spoken" wrote the editor of the ''Cambridge Review'', "and tragic passion 'with dignity put on' should not miss this wonderful opportunity. What a magnificent play!"&lt;ref&gt;''Cambridge Review'', 12 March 1920&lt;/ref&gt; "After three hundred years it must console the poet in his Elysium to know that at last his play has been played with success before a 'full and understanding auditory'. We must confess that to us it was the ritual of an initiation to the mysteries of a play which we always believed to be great, but which we never realized was quite so wonderful".&lt;ref&gt;''Cambridge Review'', 30 April 1920&lt;/ref&gt; The production inspired the Cambridge scholar [[F. L. Lucas]] to edit the complete plays of Webster. "But in what exactly does the fascination of Webster consist?" he asked in the ''New Statesman''.&lt;ref&gt;''New Statesman'', 1 March 1924&lt;/ref&gt; "What could make the Cambridge production of ''The White Devil'' in 1920 seem still, to at least two who saw it then without any preconceptions, the most staggering performance they had ever known?"

In 1925 the Renaissance Theatre mounted a heavily cut version featuring [[Viola Tree]] and [[Cedric Hardwicke]]. The production was not well reviewed, perhaps mainly because of a failure to understand the special requirements of Renaissance [[dramaturgy]]. Webster scholar [[F. L. Lucas]] asked in the ''[[New Statesman]]'', "Who can hope to speak passionate verse lying on one elbow on the floor?"&lt;ref&gt;''New Statesman'', 17 October 1925&lt;/ref&gt;

A London production in 1947 at the [[Duchess Theatre]] directed by [[Michael Benthall]] featured [[Hugh Griffith]] as Monticelso, [[Patrick Macnee]] as Hortensio/Spanish Ambassador, [[Claire Bloom]] as one of the Ladies of Brachiano's court, [[Margaret Rawlings]] as Vittoria and [[Andrew Cruickshank]] as the Duke of Florence.

In 1965, an Off-Broadway production was staged at the [[Circle in the Square Theatre|Circle in the Square]] starring [[Frank Langella]] as Flamineo, [[Carrie Nye]] as Vittoria, [[Paul Stevens (actor)|Paul Stevens]] as Brachiano, [[Robert Burr]] as Francisco, Eric Berry as Monticelso and [[Christina Pickles]] as Cornelia. The production ran from 6 December 1965 to 17 April 1966 and won the [[Obie Award]] for Distinguished Performance (Frank Langella).

In November 1969, the National Theatre at the Old Vic in London, performed the play in a production by Frank Dunlop (who went on to found the Young Vic). The cast was largely drawn from the company. [[Geraldine McEwan]] played Vittoria, [[Edward Woodward]] Flamineo, [[Edward Petherbridge]] Lodovico, [[Benjamin Whitrow]] Camillo, [[Derek Godfrey]] Bracciano, [[Jane Lapotaire]] Zanche, Hazel Hughes Cornelia, [[John Moffatt (actor)|John Moffatt]] Monticelso, [[Jane Wenham (actress)|Jane Wenham]] Isabella, [[Anthony Nicholls (actor)|Anthony Nicholls]] Francisco and [[Edward Hardwicke]] Marcello. In later performances [[Derek Jacobi]] played Lodovico.  It was designed by Piero Gherardi as a crumbling wall out of which characters emerged like crawling insects in fantastic costumes of great extravagance. William Hobbs staged the fights and played the Spanish Ambassador. Mime work was by Claude Chagrin. The assistant director was Roland Joffe (since then the director of "The Killing Fields" and "The Mission").

The [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] performed ''The White Devil'' in 1996 at the [[Swan Theatre (Stratford)|Swan Theatre]] in [[Stratford-upon-Avon]] (later transferred to London to The Pit at The Barbican), directed by [[Gale Edwards]] with [[Richard McCabe]] as Flamineo, [[Philip Quast]] as Ludovico, [[Ray Fearon]] as Brachiano, [[Jane Gurnett]] as Vittoria, [[Stephen Boxer]] as Francisco and [[Philip Voss]]. The company returned to the play in 2014 with a production in the [[Swan Theatre (Stratford)|Swan Theatre]] in [[Stratford-upon-Avon]], directed by Maria Aberg with David Sturzaker as Bracciano, Kirsty Bushell as Vittoria, [[David Rintoul]] as Cardinal Monticelso, Simon Scardifield as Francisco and Joseph Arkley as Ludovico; in this production, Flamineo, Vittoria's brother, was played by a woman (Laura Elphinstone).

On 01 March 1997, the [[BBC World Service]] broadcast an adaptation starring [[Anton Lesser]] and [[Helen Baxendale]].

On 15 August 2010 [[BBC Radio 3]] broadcast a production adapted and directed by [[Marc Beeby]] which, according to the BBC Radio 3 web site, "sets the action in a murky underworld of the 1950s – a world that seeks to hide its shifting alliances, betrayals and sudden violence beneath a flaky veneer of honour and respectability."  The production featured [[Patrick Kennedy (actor)|Patrick Kennedy]] as Flamineo, [[Anna Maxwell Martin]] as Vittoria, [[Frances de la Tour]] as Cornelia, [[Shaun Dingwall]] as Brachiano, [[Peter Wright (actor)|Peter Wright]] as Francisco, Sean Baker as Monticelso and [[Harry Myers]] as Ludovico.

On 26 January 2017 a run started at the [[Sam Wanamaker Playhouse]], London (a venue embodying the features of a typical theatre from the period of the original seventeenth century production).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shenton|first1=Mark|title=The White Devil review at Sam Wanamaker Playhouse, London – ‘thrilling and ferocious’|work=[[The Stage]]|date=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To date, this play has never been filmed or televised.

[[File:great train robbery still.jpg|thumb|225px|Threats can be subtle or overt. Actor [[Justus D. Barnes]], in ''[[The Great Train Robbery (1903 film)|The Great Train Robbery]]'']]

A '''threat''' is a ''communicated'' intent to inflict harm or loss on another person.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OED | threat }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{MerriamWebsterDictionary|threat}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A threat is considered an act of [[coercion]]. Threats ([[intimidation]]) are widely observed in animal behavior, particularly in a ritualized form, chiefly in order to avoid the unnecessary physical violence that can lead to physical damage or the death of both conflicting parties.

Some of the more common types of threats forbidden by law are those made with an intent to obtain a monetary advantage or to compel a person to act against his or her will. In all [[United States|US]] states, it is an offense to threaten to (1) use a deadly weapon on another person; (2) injure another's person or property; or (3) injure another's reputation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Phelps and Lehman|first=Shirelle and Jeffrey|title=West's Encyclopedia of American Law|date=2005|publisher=Gale Virtual Reference Library|location=Detroit|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Law==
===Brazil===
In Brazil, the crime of threatening someone, defined as a threat to cause unjust and grave harm, is punishable by a fine or three months to one year in prison, as described in the [[Brazilian Penal Code]], article 147. Brazilian [[jurisprudence]] does not treat as a crime a threat that was proffered in a heated discussion.

===Germany===
The German ''[[Strafgesetzbuch]]'' § 241 punishes the crime of threat with a prison term for up to one year or a fine. Even if someone, against his better judgment, feigns to another person that the realization of a serious criminal offense directed against him or a person close to him is imminent,  shall be similarly punished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Criminal Code (Strafgesetzbuch, StGB)|url=http://www.iuscomp.org/gla/statutes/StGB.htm#241|accessdate=April 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
In the United States, federal law criminalizes certain [[true threat]]s transmitted via the [[U.S. mail]]&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|18|876}}&lt;/ref&gt; or in [[interstate commerce]]. It also criminalizes [[threatening the government officials of the United States]]. Some U.S. states criminalize [[cyberbullying]].  Threats of bodily harm are called [[assault]].

== True threat ==
A '''true threat''' is a [[threatening communication]] that can be prosecuted under the law. It is distinct from a threat that is made in jest. The [[U.S. Supreme Court]] has held that true threats are not protected under the [[U.S. Constitution]] based on three justifications: preventing fear, preventing the disruption that follows from that fear, and diminishing the likelihood that the threatened violence will occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|volume=81|publisher=N.Y.U. L. Rev.|pages=385|year=2006|title=Toward an Improved True Threat Doctrine for Student Speakers; Stanner, Andrew P.|url=http://heinonlinebackup.com/hol-cgi-bin/get_pdf.cgi?handle=hein.journals/nylr81&amp;section=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is some concern that even satirical speech could be regarded as a "true threat" due to concern over [[terrorism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|volume=58|publisher=U. Miami L. Rev.|pages=843|date=2003–2004|title=Mocking George: Political Satire as True Threat in the Age of Global Terrorism|author=Gilbert, Lauren|url=http://heinonlinebackup.com/hol-cgi-bin/get_pdf.cgi?handle=hein.journals/umialr58&amp;section=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The true threat doctrine was established in the 1969 Supreme Court case ''[[Watts v. United States]]''.&lt;ref name=Weiss&gt;{{citation|volume=72|publisher=Fordham L. Rev.|pages=1283|year=2004|title=Is the True Threats Doctrine Threatening the First Amendment? Planned Parenthood of the Columbia/Willamette, Inc. v. American Coalition of Life Activists Signals the Need To Remedy an Inadequate Doctrine; Weiss, Lori|url=http://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3953&amp;context=flr}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that case, an eighteen-year-old male was convicted in a Washington, D.C. District Court for violating a statute prohibiting persons from knowingly and willfully making threats to harm or kill the President of the United States.&lt;ref name=Weiss/&gt; The conviction was based on a statement made by Watts, in which he said, "[i]f they ever make me carry a rifle the first man I want to get in my sights is [[Lyndon B. Johnson|L.B.J.]]"&lt;ref name=Weiss/&gt; Watts appealed, leading to the Supreme Court finding the statute constitutional on its face, but reversing the conviction of Watts. 

In reviewing the lower court's analysis of the case, the Court noted that "a threat must be distinguished from what is constitutionally protected speech."&lt;ref name=Weiss/&gt; The Court recognized that "uninhibited, robust, and wideopen" political debate can at times be characterized by "vehement, caustic, and sometimes unpleasantly sharp attacks on government and public officials." In light of the context of Watts' statement - and the laughter that it received from the crowd - the Court found that it was more "a kind of very crude offensive method of stating a political opposition to the President" than a "true threat." &lt;ref name=Weiss/&gt; In so holding, the Court established that there is a "true threat" exception to protected speech, but also that the statement must be viewed in its context and distinguished from protected hyperbole. The opinion, however, stopped short of defining precisely what constituted a "true threat." &lt;ref name=Weiss/&gt;

Criminal charges were brought against [[Smith, Kline &amp; French|SmithKline]] executives with regard to hiding data related to toxicity while gaining FDA approval.  The company pleaded guilty to 14 counts of failure to report adverse reactions and 20 counts of selling a [[misbranded drug]].&lt;ref&gt;United States v.

Tienilic acid was found to act as a suicide substrate at the [[cytochrome P450]] enzymes involved in drug metabolism. However, the metabolic reaction carried out by these enzymes converted tienilic acid to a [[thiophene]] [[sulfoxide]] which was highly [[electrophilic]]. This encouraged a [[Michael reaction]] leading to alkylation of a [[thiol]] group in the enzyme's active site. Loss of water from the thiophene sulfoxide restored the thiophene ring and resulted in tienilic acid being covalently linked to the enzyme, thus inhibiting the enzyme irreversibly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

The above explanation is a hypothesis. It is still not known (after 15 years) if the reactive intermediate which inactivates the CYP2C9 is the thiophene sulfoxide or the thiophene epoxide. The target on the protein is also not known (could be multiple). However tienilic acid is a good mechanism based inhibitor of CYP2C9 and seems to inactivate it stoichiometrically. Progress in proteomics may one day give the answer.

Recent studies indicate that in fact the primary metabolite of tienilic acid (5-OH tienilic acid) cannot be derived from a thiophene-S-oxide intermediate as was previously hypothesized. It was determined to be derived from a thiophene epoxide intermediate and this reactive intermediate is then likely a cause for the covalent binding to as well as mechanism-based inactivation of CYP2C9.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

'''Treva Joyce Throneberry''' (born May 18, 1969) is an American woman who spent most of her twenties pretending to be a teenager and engaging in other forms of con artistry, for which she would eventually be convicted and imprisoned. She made numerous false claims of [[sexual abuse]], including that she was a victim of [[satanic ritual abuse]] to gain money.&lt;ref name="chron1985"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/Woman-portrayed-self-as-abused-teen-since-1985-2061992.php |title=Woman portrayed self as abused teen since 1985 – Houston Chronicle |website=Chron.com |first=Bernadette|last=Pruitt|date=2001-11-11 |accessdate=2013-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time she traveled the United States, residing in foster homes, colleges and with any family that would take her in,&lt;ref name="portlandmercury1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.portlandmercury.com/portland/treva-or-brianna/Content?oid=24561 |title=Treva or Brianna |work=Portland Mercury |first=Katia| last=Dunn|date= 2001-05-17|accessdate=2013-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; using false identities. Her father, Carl Throneberry, said: "She's just going cross-country and using different names and receiving welfare."&lt;ref name="seattlepi1" /&gt;

As of 2003, she falsely claimed to be a woman named Brianna Stewart who was born in 1981.

Arrested in 2001 and charged with fraud and perjury, her true identity was established by DNA testing.  Court-appointed psychologists deemed Throneberry to not be delusional, and that she knew what she was doing.&lt;ref name="White"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/10/magazine/forever-young.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm | work=The New York Times | first=Emily | last=White | title=Forever Young | date=2002-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She was convicted and was given a three-year sentence at a correctional center in [[Gig Harbor, Washington]]. Throneberry was released after serving two years and three months of her sentence.&lt;ref name="abcnews2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wweek1" /&gt;

== Early life and education ==
Treva Joyce Throneberry was born on May 18, 1969, in [[Wichita Falls, Texas|Wichita Falls]], [[Texas]], to Carl and Patsy Throneberry.&lt;ref name="White" /&gt; Her father had dropped out of school in the sixth grade and, as an adult, "didn't know how to spell".&lt;ref name="texasmonthly"/&gt; Her family later moved to [[Electra, Texas|Electra]], Texas. She and her sisters were sexually abused by their uncle Billy Ray while growing up.&lt;ref name="texasmonthly" /&gt;  Throneberry moved from Electra to Wichita Falls, Texas, in December 1985 when she was 15 years old, and enrolled in the local [[high school]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}} She began to tell stories about how she had been abducted and raped by [[Satanist]]s.

In May 1986, Throneberry threatened to kill herself and was sent to a local [[mental hospital]], [[North Texas State Hospital#Wichita Falls Campus|Wichita Falls State Hospital]], for five months.&lt;ref name="texasmonthly"/&gt; While there, doctors said her condition was a [[Personality disorder|characterological disorder]] and she was given [[Perphenazine|Trilafon]], [[Imipramine|Tofranil]] and [[Alprazolam|Xanax]].&lt;ref name="texasmonthly" /&gt; She refused to speak with her family when they visited. When she was discharged in October 1986, she was transferred to the Lena Pope Home for Troubled Girls, a [[residential treatment center]] in [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]], Texas. While at Lena Pope, her therapist set a goal for her: to develop and [[Dialectical behavior therapy#Interpersonal effectiveness|maintain interpersonal relationships]].&lt;ref name="texasmonthly" /&gt; She kept a distance from her family, only sending a letter now and then.

Throneberry graduated from [[Arlington Heights High School]] in Fort Worth, Texas in 1987 and moved to [[Arlington, Texas|Arlington]], Texas. In Arlington, she rented her own apartment and worked as a hotel maid.&lt;ref name="chron1985" /&gt;&lt;ref name="White" /&gt;

== Crimes ==
For most of the 1990s, Throneberry wandered around the country using various names and identities. She said she was a teenager with an abusive background, lived in [[homeless shelter]]s and [[foster home]]s and enrolled in local high schools. She said that her Satanist father had raped her and killed her mother and also accused her foster parents, and other families that had taken her in, of sexual abuse for which police could not find any evidence. All cases were dismissed.

In 1993, Throneberry was living in [[Corvallis, Oregon|Corvallis]], [[Oregon]], and passing herself off as a teenager named "Keili T. Throneberry Smitt" and "Keili Smitt". She was staying with a family she had met at a church. Throneberry went to court in [[Benton County, Oregon|Benton County]], Oregon, to legally change her name to Keili Smitt. Throneberry falsely reported to Corvallis police officers she had been raped by her father, who she at that point falsely claimed was a police officer, in Oregon.&lt;ref name="texasmonthly" /&gt; Thorneberry was charged with filing the false police report in Oregon.&lt;ref name="chron1985" /&gt;

In 1996, Throneberry was in [[Altoona, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref name="post-gazette1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="post-gazette2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://old.post-gazette.com/neigh_east/20011120eburbs1121p9.asp |title=East Briefs: 11/21/01 |publisher=Old.post-gazette.com |date=2001-11-21 |accessdate=2013-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; She said that her name was "Stephanie Danielle Lewis" and that she was sixteen and was fleeing her Satanist parents with the help of the religious underground. After eighteen days of investigation, police contacted a girl she had known in Texas and found out who she really was. She was arrested, charged with giving false information and sentenced to nine days in jail. After her release she disappeared again and continued her wandering.

In 1997, when she was acting as 17-year-old "Brianna Stewart" in [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], Oregon, and [[Vancouver, Washington|Vancouver]], Washington, she falsely accused a 47-year-old security guard named Charles Blankenship of rape. She was actually 28 at the time. He was convicted in [[Clark County, Washington|Clark County]], Washington, of "having sex with a minor" and sentenced to 50 days in jail. After her fraud was exposed, a judge expunged Blankenship's conviction.&lt;ref name="post-gazette1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://old.post-gazette.com/regionstate/20010422impostor5.asp |title=Strange cases of 'teen' impostor |publisher=Old.post-gazette.com |date=2001-04-22 |accessdate=2013-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jclass.umd.edu/archive/newshoax/casestudies/idfraud/IDOtherWillaBrit1.html |title=The Hoax Project, Philip Merrill College of Journalism, University of Maryland, College Park |publisher=Jclass.umd.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1998, between the ages of 27 and 31, she spent five years in Vancouver, Washington, posing as an initially 16-year-old [[Evergreen High School (Vancouver, Washington)|Evergreen High School]] student named "Brianna Stewart", living in various strangers' homes.&lt;ref name="portlandmercury1" /&gt; She had a 2.83 grade-point average and got a D grade in drama class.&lt;ref name="post-gazette1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="texasmonthly" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/875635/Woman-convicted-of-posing-as-teen.html |title=Woman convicted of posing as teen |work=Deseret News |date=2001-11-21 |accessdate=2013-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had a boyfriend for a year and a half, Kenny Dunn, and told him about her alleged abuse. First she claimed that she originated from [[Mobile, Alabama]]. Sympathetic benefactors gave her money and shelter but she eventually betrayed their trust by making false claims of abuse. In hindsight, many of the foster homes said they began to suspect that she was not a teenager. One dentist noticed that Stewart no longer had [[wisdom teeth]] and that the scars from their extraction were healed, unusual in a teenager.

Throneberry, as "Brianna Stewart" graduated from Evergreen High School with the class of 2000 and enrolled at [[Clark College (Washington)|Clark College]].&lt;ref name="post-gazette2" /&gt;

In 2016, Throneberry resurfaced under the alias "Brianna Kenzie", accusing a local man of sexually assaulting her while she worked as a hotel employee. She was later fired after hotel employees learned of her prior record.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theolympian.com/news/local/crime/article86659452.html|title=Suspect in hotel assault cleared of charges|first=Andy|last=Hobbs|work=The Olympian|date= 2016-06-29|access-date=2016-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pop Culture ==
Her story inspired episode 21 of season 8 ("Pretend") of [[Law &amp; Order: SVU]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0966157/trivia?ref_=tt_trv_trv|title=Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit (TV Series) - Pretend - (2007) -Trivia|work=IMDb|access-date=2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Waga Hip Hop''' is one of the major international hip hop festivals taking place in West Africa. Each year, around early and mid-October, [[Ouagadougou]] ([[Burkina Faso]]) thus welcomes international artists and media to attend this festival of urban cultures.

== Waga Hip Hop and its framing ==
Created in 2000, Waga Hip Hop is the flagship event of the association Umane Culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Janin| first=Sylviane |title=Burkina Faso |publisher=Editions Olizane |year=2010 |pages=197 |isbn= 2-88086-386-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; This association stands out as an active cultural structure, which develops multidisciplinary projects, in music, theatre, dance and tales, created in 1997 by Ali Diallo (member of the Export Bureau of African Music, BEMA). The latest realisation of Umane Culture was the creation, in November 2008, of the first Burkinabé music market, Saga Musik.

At first, Waga Hip Hop was organised with local hip hop artists solely at a time when [[Hip Hop]] was booming in Burkina Faso (2001–2003) mainly thanks to the arrival of an initial studio (Abazon) whose arranger was specialised in hip hop productions ([[Smockey]]). However, very quickly, Waga Hip Hop reached an international scale, notably in 2002, with the support of international cultural organisations. Since then, and for each of its editions, Waga Hip Hop has welcomed artists coming from throughout the continent. With respect, it stands as one of the most visible festivals dedicated to the urban cultures in the West African region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Afrique Magazine |publisher= Groupe Jeune Afrique |volume= 269-274 |issue= 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unsurprisingly, Waga Hip Hop, as a yearly event, has now raised international consideration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Chabasseur |first= Eglantine |title=Festival Ouga Hip Hop 2006: 6ème Edition |date=October 31, 2006 |journal= Radio France Internationale |url= http://www.rfimusique.com/musiquefr/articles/082/article_txt_16642.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Waga Hip Hop and its diverse programming ==
Each year, Waga Hip Hop aims at being as largely as possible representative of all the urban cultures. As such, Waga Hip Hop not only welcomes in its organisation showcases and performances of hip hop artists but also those of other urban artists such as the now well-known Victor Démé who was discovered through a performance he gave during the festival. Besides, Waga Hip Hop regularly holds artistic residencies dedicated to the various disciplines of urban cultures such as hip hop dance, [[beatbox]] and other vocal urban music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chabasseur |first1=Eglantine |date= October 19, 2009 |title= Waga Hip Hop 2009: Le festival qui ne dort jamais |journal= RFI |url=http://www.rfimusique.com/musiquefr/articles/118/article_17791.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its most famous production is “Waka Tibio”, which came out of the artistic residencies held during the 2008 and 2009 editions, and welcomed the joint performances of Fredy Massamba (DRC), [[King Ayisoba]] (Ghana), Awa Sissao (Burkina Faso) and DJ Gee Bayss (Senegal).

Besides, with the desire to expand its contribution to the whole country, Waga Hip Hop holds events in the capital city, i.e. Ouagadougou as well as throughout the country, in the different regional cities (Ouahigouya, [[Fada N’Gourma]], [[Bobo Dioulasso]], [[Pô]], [[Koudougou]]). Not only a space of creation and diffusion, Waga Hip Hop also stands as an important sphere of training and formation. Indeed, and in order to support the development of the local cultural community, the festival yearly organises workshops dedicated to the local cultural operators as well as to the artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chabasseur |first1=Eglantine |date= October 19, 2009 |title= Waga Hip Hop 2009: Le festival qui ne dort jamais |journal= RFI |url=http://www.rfimusique.com/musiquefr/articles/118/article_17791.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The principal partners of Waga Hip Hop are the Francophonia International Organisation (OIF), Africalia (Belgium), Culture France but also Staycalm!, a Paris-based artistic collective which has been supporting Waga Hip Hop since its early years. Staycalm! has now become well known for its multimedia production on West African Hip Hop, “Fangafrika”.
