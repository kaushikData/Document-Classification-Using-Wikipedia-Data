{{Politics of Swaziland}}

The '''2007 [[Swaziland|Swazi]] general strike''' has been ongoing since 25 July 2007, led by the [[Swaziland Federation of Trade Unions]], the [[Swaziland Federation of Labour]] and the [[Swaziland National Association of Teachers]]. They plan to stage a two-hour full stoppage of public life every month until the incumbent absolute monarch [[Mswati III of Swaziland|Mswati III]] gives in to their demands:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Thulani |last=Mthethwa |title=Swazis Strike for Democracy |url=https://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2007/07/26/ap3956890.html |work=Associated Press, republished on Forbes.com |publisher= Forbes.com LLC|date=26 July 2007 |accessdate=2007-08-04 }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Swazi parliamentary election, 2008|multi-party elections in October 2008]], that benefits cease to be taxed and an end to [[absolute monarchy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Striking workers call for multi-party elections in Swaziland |url=http://news.monstersandcritics.com/europe/news/article_1335272.php/Striking_workers_call_for_multi-party_elections_in_Swaziland |work=Deutsche Presse-Agentur, republished on Monsters and Critics |publisher=Monsters and Critics.com, WotR Ltd |date=26 July 2007 |accessdate=2007-08-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070829211517/http://news.monstersandcritics.com/europe/news/article_1335272.php/Striking_workers_call_for_multi-party_elections_in_Swaziland |archivedate=29 August 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The demonstrations constituted Swaziland's biggest civil movement for over a decade, since the last large-scale protests in 1996.&lt;ref name=citizen/&gt;

Government spokespersons denied the unions' and strikers' claims, stating that they should not demonstrate, but rather lobby the parliament, as only parliament has the power to change the constitution to allow multi-party elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Country King Faces Trouble Amid Protests Over Lack of Reforms |url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200707300437.html |work=The Nation, republished on [[allAfrica.com]] |publisher=AllAfrica Global Media |date=30 July 2007 |accessdate=2007-08-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1813 title page Vindication Diet.jpg|thumb|1813 title page, printed for J. Callow by Smith &amp; Davy, London.]]{{italic title}}
'''''A Vindication of Natural Diet''''' is an 1813 book by [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] on [[vegetarianism]] and [[animal rights]]. It was first written as part of the notes to ''[[Queen Mab (poem)|Queen Mab]]'', which was privately printed in 1813. Later in the same year the essay was separately published as a pamphlet.

==Background==

Shelley wrote four essays on the subject of vegetarianism, "A Vindication of Natural Diet" (1813), the note in ''[[Queen Mab (poem)|Queen Mab]]'', in a section of "A Refutation of Deism" (1814), and "On the Vegetable System of Diet", which was published posthumously in 1929.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer, Colin. ''The Heretic's Feast: A History of Vegetarianism''. Great Britain: Hartnolls Ltd, Bodmin. 1993, pp. 244–45.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morton, Timothy, "Joseph Ritson, Percy Shelley and the Making of Romantic Vegetarianism." ''Romanticism'', Vol. 12, Issue 1, 2006, pp. 52–61.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clark, David Lee. "The Date and Source of Shelley's 'A Vindication of Natural Diet'." ''Studies in Philology'', Vol. 36, No. 1, January 1939.&lt;/ref&gt; Shelley first experimented with a vegetarian diet while at [[Oxford University]] according to [[Thomas Jefferson Hogg]].&lt;ref&gt;Hogg, Thomas Jefferson. ''The Life of Percy Bysshe Shelley.'' London, 1858, I, p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt; Shelley began a vegetarian diet on 1 March 1812 along with his first wife Harriet Westbrook. Shelley began composing the essay in October–November 1812.

The work has been republished since 1813 beginning with an abridged version which was published in Boston by March, Capen, and Lyon in an American collection ''Vegetable Diet: As Sanctioned by Medical Men, and by Experience in All Ages'', edited by William A. Alcott.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dbooks.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/books/PDFs/600037532.pdf ''Vegetable Diet''. Bodleian Libraries. University of Oxford.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The essay was reprinted in 1884 in a new edition in London by F. Pitman and by John Heywood and the Vegetarian Society in Manchester. The original title page was reproduced: ''A Vindication of Natural Diet. Being One in a Series of Notes to Queen Mab (A Philosophical Poem).'' London: Printed for J. Callow by Smith &amp; Davy, 1813. The new edition featured a preface by [[Henry Stephens Salt]] and [[William Axon]]. A second edition appeared in 1886.

In 1904, the work was republished in London by C. W. Daniel as ''A Vindication of Natural Diet and Extracts from the Works of Dr. Lambe'', edited and annotated by F. E. Worland.

==Vegetarianism==

Shelley wrote in ''A Vindication of Natural Diet'': "It is only by softening and disguising dead flesh by culinary preparation that it is rendered susceptible of mastication or digestion, and that the sight of its bloody juices and raw horror does not excite intolerable loathing and disgust."&lt;ref name="Shelley, Percy Bysshe 1813, pp. 1"&gt;Shelley, Percy Bysshe, "A Vindication of Natural Diet;" London: Smith &amp; Davy. 1813, pp. 1–36.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shelley used the imagery of slaughtering a lamb. In ''[[Queen Mab (poem)|Queen Mab: A Philosophical Poem]]'' (1813) he wrote about the change to a vegetarian diet using the lamb imagery: "And man ... no longer now/ He slays the lamb that looks him in the face,/ And horribly devours his mangled flesh."&lt;ref&gt;Preece, Rod. ''Sins of the Flesh: A History of Ethical Vegetarian Thought''. Vancouver, BC, Canada: University of British Columbia Press, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the novel ''[[Frankenstein|Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus]]'' (1818), which Shelley collaborated on,&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Stephen. "Percy Bysshe Shelley helped wife Mary write Frankenstein, claims professor: Mary Shelley received extensive help in writing Frankenstein from her husband, Percy Bysshe Shelley, a leading academic has claimed", ''The Telegraph, 24 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grande, James. Review: The Original Frankenstein, By Mary Shelley with Percy Shelley ed Charles E Robinson. "To what extent did Percy Bysshe Shelley work on 'Frankenstein'? A new analysis reveals all", ''The Independent'', 16 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; the Monster is portrayed as a vegetarian. The lamb imagery is retained. The Monster explained his vegetarian diet to [[Victor Frankenstein]]: "My food is not that of man. I do not destroy the lamb and the kid to glut my appetite; acorns and berries afford me sufficient nourishment."

In "The Sensitive Plant" he argued that all life forms, including "all killing insects and gnawing worms,/ And things of obscene and unlovely forms", have a natural role to play in the ecosystem which requires understanding rather than destruction, because what they do "although they did ill, was innocent".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bl.uk/collection-items/p-b-shelleys-a-vindication-of-the-natural-diet P. B. Shelley's "A Vindication of the Natural Diet". British Library.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Laon and Cythna'', republished as ''[[The Revolt of Islam]]'' (1817), Fifth Canto, the Festival of nations held after the Revolution is a banquet where no meat is served. The feast is vegetarian: "Never again may blood of bird or beast/ Stain with its venomous stream a human feast". This is "The banquet of the free" where the guests are described as "reclining as they ate, of Liberty,/ And Hope, and Justice". The festival was not polluted by gore, "But piled on high, an overflowing store/ Of pomegranates, and citrons, fairest fruit,/ Melons, and dates, and figs, and many a root".&lt;ref&gt;[http://spenserians.cath.vt.edu/TextRecord.php?action=GET&amp;textsid=36173 ''Revolt of Islam''. Canto Fifth.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Shelley argued that eating meat was unnatural. He maintained that diseases and immorality arose from mankind's "unnatural habits of life". A meatless diet was the best regimen for maintaining a healthy and disease-free lifestyle. He wrote that human diseases could be decreased by a return to a natural vegetable diet.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer, Colin, ''The Heretic's Feast: A History of Vegetarianism;'' Great Britain: Hartnolls Ltd, Bodmin. 1993, pp. 244–45.&lt;/ref&gt; Shelley argued that eating meat was a practice that polluted the body with syphilis and resulted in other ailments. In ''A Vindication of Natural Diet'' he wrote, "Should ever a physician be born with the genius of [[John Locke|Locke]], I am persuaded that he might trace all bodily and mental derangements to our unnatural habits,"&lt;ref name="Shelley, Percy Bysshe 1813, pp 16"&gt;Shelley, Percy Bysshe, "A Vindication of Natural Diet"; London: Smith &amp; Davy. 1813, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; these unnatural habits being the consumption of meat. He cited the [[allegory]] of [[Prometheus]] who stole fire from the gods which enabled mankind to cook meat, thereby screening the disgust and horror of dead flesh. Shelley also compared a meat diet to alcoholism, inquiring, "How many thousands have become murderers and robbers, bigots and domestic tyrants, dissolute and abandoned adventurers, from the use of fermented liquors?"&lt;ref name="Shelley, Percy Bysshe 1813, pp 16"/&gt; Shelley used comparative anatomy to show that the human digestive system resembles that of [[frugivore|frugivorous]] or plant-eating animals. He concluded that a person with compassion and empathy for animals, "rising from a meal of roots", would be able to maintain a healthy and balanced diet and lifestyle. Shelley presented examples of how a vegetarian diet resulted in longevity and an increased lifespan. The only threat of death will be that of natural, old age.&lt;ref name="Shelley, Percy Bysshe 1813, pp. 1" /&gt; The two rules he prescribes for a natural diet are to never eat anything that was alive and to drink only distilled water.

'''Presidential elections''' were held in [[Afghanistan]] on 20 August 2009.&lt;ref name=mixed/&gt; The election resulted in victory for incumbent [[Hamid Karzai]], who won 49.67% of the vote, while his main rival [[Abdullah Abdullah]] finished second with 30.59% of the vote.

The election was characterized by lack of security, low voter turnout and low awareness of the people about the election and election process and widespread ballot stuffing, intimidation, and other electoral fraud.&lt;ref name=invalid&gt;{{Cite web|last=McDonald |first=Charlotte |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5i3xqZSi2U_mgENDm3TK0-yqI7I_g |title=Afghan commission orders first ballots invalidated |date=2009-09-10 |accessdate=2010-04-07| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100413122433/https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5i3xqZSi2U_mgENDm3TK0-yqI7I_g| archivedate=April 13, 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=scrapped&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/03/world/asia/03afghan.html?_r=1&amp;hp Karzai Gets New Term as Afghan Runoff is Scrapped], ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=messy&gt;{{Cite news|last=Dixon |first=Robyn |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-fg-obama-karzai3-2009nov03,0,963693.story |title=Obama calls Afghan election 'messy' but upholds its final outcome |work=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=2010-04-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091105050208/http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-fg-obama-karzai3-2009nov03%2C0%2C963693.story |archivedate=November 5, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[#November 7 run-off election|second round run-off vote]], announced under heavy U.S. and ally pressure, was originally scheduled for 7 November 2009, but [[#Run-off cancelled and winner declared|it was cancelled]] after Abdullah refused to participate, and [[Hamid Karzai]] was declared [[President of Afghanistan]] for another 5-year term.&lt;ref name=scrapped/&gt;&lt;ref name=messy/&gt;

The election was the second under the present [[constitution of Afghanistan]] and was held on the same day as elections for 34 [[Provinces of Afghanistan|provincial council]] seats.

==Election date==
Under the [[Constitution of Afghanistan|2004 constitution]], elections should have been held no later than 60 days before the end of President Karzai's term in July 2009. The Independent Election Commission (IEC) originally recommended that the poll be held at the same time as the 2010 parliamentary balloting to save costs. However, politicians in the country were unable to agree to the details.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120904050930/http://www.afghanconflictmonitor.org/2008/04/afghanistan-to.html Afghanistan To Hold Separate Presidential, Parliamentary Elections], ''[[The Canadian Press]]'', 2008-04-09&lt;/ref&gt; Concerns about accessibility to mountainous areas in spring 2009 and the ability of getting adequate people and materials in place by then led the IEC to announce the elections would be delayed to August 2009.

The opposition accused Karzai of attempting to extend his power past his term. In February 2009, President Hamid Karzai called on the Independent Election Committee to hold the election according to the country's constitution,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7916607.stm|work=BBC News  |title=Afghan president urges April poll|date=2009-02-28|accessdate=2010-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.voanews.com/uspolicy/2009-03-09-voa7.cfm |title=Afghanistan's Election Dilemma |publisher=[[Voice of America]] |date=2009-03-09 |accessdate=2009-03-12 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090331141358/http://www.voanews.com/uspolicy/2009-03-09-voa7.cfm |archivedate=March 31, 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Forty-four candidates had registered for the presidential election when the Independent Election Commission of Afghanistan (IEC) announced its official preliminary list of registered candidates on May 17, 2009. Three candidates withdrew from the race before the election took place, having thrown their support behind one of the top two contenders. Each presidential candidate ran with two vice-presidential candidates.&lt;ref name=ordinary/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifes.org/publication/a05e4a3ba20a60b82a650a1fa9e18ecf/Election_Kit_Afghanistan.pdf Afghanistan2009 Presidential and Provincial Council Elections Kit] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110616213130/http://www.ifes.org/publication/a05e4a3ba20a60b82a650a1fa9e18ecf/Election_Kit_Afghanistan.pdf |date=June 16, 2011 }}, [[International Foundation for Electoral Systems]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://english.people.com.cn/90001/90777/90851/6659282.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Karzai filed his candidacy on May 4, 2009; he retained incumbent second Vice President [[Karim Khalili]], who is from the [[Hazara people|Hazara]] ethnic group but exchanged the first Vice President [[Ahmad Zia Massood]] for [[Mohammad Qasim Fahim]], a [[Tajik people|Tajik]] former warlord blamed by human rights groups for mass civilian deaths during the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghan Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://washingtontimes.com/news/2009/may/08/karzai-jockeys-to-stay-in-power/ Afghan Karzai likely to win reelection], ''[[Washington Times]]'', 2009-05-08&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United National Front (Afghanistan)|United National Front]] announced on April 16, 2009 that they would nominate former foreign minister Dr. [[Abdullah Abdullah (politician)|Abdullah Abdullah]] as their presidential candidate. Abdullah was foreign minister of the [[United Islamic Front for the Salvation of Afghanistan|Northern Alliance]] from 1998 onwards, and was a dominant figure in the [[United Islamic Front for the Salvation of Afghanistan|Alliance]]. He was appointed foreign minister in the interim government that was installed after the U.S. invasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-world/afghan-opposition-picks-candidate-20090416-a8j5.html |title=Afghan opposition picks candidate |publisher=News.smh.com.au |date=2009-04-16 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FACTBOX/&gt;&lt;ref name=newopt&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thechronicleherald.ca/Opinion/1140249.html |title=Afghan election only shows a new option is needed |website=The Chronicle Herald |date=2010-04-07|accessdate=2010-04-07}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wizard&gt;{{Cite web|author= |url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/KI01Df02.html |title=Wizards and wives drive Afghan election |website=Asia Times |date=2009-09-01 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first person to have declared his intention to run, Dr. [[Ramazan Bashardost]] formally registered for the presidential election on May 7, 2009, with vice-presidential candidates Mr. Mohammad Mosa Barekzai, a professor at the Kabul Agricultural Institute and Ms. Afifa Maroof, a member of the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission, and with a dove, a symbol of peace and liberty, as their campaign symbol. Bashardost openly criticized the government and accused ministers of corruption. While serving as the planning minister, he was critical of foreign organizations in Afghanistan eating up aid money meant for the Afghan people and later resigned under government and foreign pressure.&lt;ref name=FACTBOX&gt;A [https://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSSP345133 FACTBOX - Possible Afghan presidential candidates]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kabulpress.org/my/spip.php?article3456 |title=Dr. Ramazan Bashardost officially enters presidential campaign |publisher=Kabulpress.org |date=2009-05-07 |accessdate=2010-04-07| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100401183226/http://kabulpress.org/my/spip.php?article3456| archivedate=April 1, 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MrClean&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rfi.fr/actuen/articles/116/article_4803.asp |title=Afghan Mr Clean takes on Karzai ... and everyone else |publisher=Rfi.fr |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. [[Ashraf Ghani]], a senior fellow in foreign policy at the [[Brookings Institution]] in Washington D.C., and former finance minister, UN special advisor, and [[World Bank]] analyst, registered as a presidential candidate on May 7, 2009. At a time when many Afghans would have preferred to lessen the appearance of ties to the U.S. government, he had the distinction of hiring Clinton-campaign chief strategist [[James Carville]] as his campaign advisor. His close ties to Washington placed him among those that Afghans considered to be "''Zana-e-Bush''", literally "Bush's wives". Ashraf Ghani was also reported as the candidate most favoured by the U.S. for appointment to a "chief executive officer" position that the U.S. intended to insert regardless of the winner of the election.{{Clarify|date=July 2017}}&lt;ref name=farce/&gt;&lt;ref name=FACTBOX/&gt;&lt;ref name=wizard/&gt;&lt;ref name=wizard/&gt;&lt;ref name=poolsclose/&gt;&lt;ref name=obama&gt;{{Cite news|author=Ewen MacAskill |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/aug/19/obama-chief-executive-afghanistan |title=Obama administration to continue push for chief executive in Afghanistan |work=Guardian |location=UK |date= 2009-08-19|accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JC&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=107006724 |title=James Carville Joins The Afghan Campaign Trail |publisher=Npr.org |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=squand&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/opinions/2009/08/20/2009-08-20_why_im_rooting_against_h.html |title=Afghanistan's president has squandered the people's trust |work=Daily News |date=2009-08-20 |accessdate=2010-04-07 | location=New York | first=Michael | last=Weiss}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mirwais Yasini]], the First Deputy Speaker of the Afghan [[House of the People (Afghanistan)|House of the People]] joined the race in March 2009. He was previously a member of the Emergency [[Loya Jirga]] convened in 2002, served as deputy of the [[Loya Jirga]], and director of counter narcotics and deputy minister of counter narcotics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.pajhwokelections.af/contender_biography.php?id=6 |title=Contender Biographies – Mir Wais Yasini's Biography |publisher=Pajhwokelections.af |accessdate=2010-04-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706070811/http://www.pajhwokelections.af/contender_biography.php?id=6 |archivedate=July 6, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Shahla Atta]], a liberal female MP and war widow also stood, pledging to revive the modernizing policies of 1973–1978 president [[Mohammad Daoud Khan]].&lt;ref name=Star&gt;[https://www.thestar.com/article/616932 "Stuck between Karzai, hard place"], ''[[Toronto Star]]'', 2009-04-11&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with the presidential candidates, were 3197 candidates for 420 provincial council positions. A Provincial Council in each of Afghanistan's 34 provinces advises and works with the provincial administration, headed by a Governor that is appointed by the President.&lt;ref name=mixed/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=NET LINKS |url=http://www.afghanelections.org/index.php?page=en_Provincial+Council |title=UNDP/ELECT - Provincial Council Elections |publisher=Afghanelections.org |accessdate=2010-04-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090821135435/http://www.afghanelections.org/index.php?page=en_Provincial%2BCouncil |archivedate=August 21, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prominent involvement of warlords===
According to human rights groups, at least 70 candidates with links to "illegal armed groups" were on the ballot list in the election.&lt;ref name=breath/&gt;

While the electoral law disallowed candidates with links to "illegal armed groups", and the [[#Systemic conflicts of interest|Karzai-appointed]] Independent Election Commission had barred 56 other candidates that it identified as being commanders or members of illegal militias, many of the bigger [[warlord]]s, including current parliamentarians and provincial council members elected in 2004 and 2005, simply bypassed this by registering their militias as [[private military company|private security companies]] or by having the right political connections.&lt;ref name=breath/&gt;&lt;ref name=canada&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=azZCwLShznhc |title=Afghan Election's Legitimacy May Hang on Canadian's Judgment |publisher=Bloomberg  |date=2009-08-23 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=clouds/&gt;&lt;ref name=US2/&gt;

Both of Hamid Karzai's vice-presidential candidates and many of his key allies in the election are alleged to have committed widespread human rights violations and [[war crime]]s. [[Human Rights Watch]] has called for Vice President [[Karim Khalili]] and key ally, former army chief of staff General [[Abdul Rashid Dostum]], to face trial before a special court for alleged war crimes. Khalili is alleged to have been responsible in the killing of thousands of innocent people.&lt;ref name=farce/&gt;&lt;ref name=US2&gt;{{Cite web|author=Jooneed Khan |url=http://www.dominionpaper.ca/articles/1148 |title=The US has Returned Fundamentalism to Afghanistan |publisher=Dominionpaper.ca |date=2007-05-06 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=former&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/23/AR2007022300251_pf.html |title=Former Mujahedeen Stage Rally in Kabul |work=The Washington Post  |date=2007-02-23 |accessdate=2010-04-07|first=Amir|last=Shah}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=boost&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article6799717.ece Afghan warlord General Dostum returns to boost Karzai’s campaign]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=flames&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.afghanwomensmission.org/awmnews/index.php?articleID=65 |title=Five Years Later, Afghanistan Still in Flames |publisher=Afghanwomensmission.org |accessdate=2010-04-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071230224159/http://www.afghanwomensmission.org/awmnews/index.php?articleID=65 |archivedate=December 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Malalai&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=07/06/19/1433256 |title="The Bravest Woman in Afghanistan": Malalai Joya Speaks Out Against the Warlord-Controlled Afghan Government &amp; U.S. Military Presence |publisher=Democracynow.org |accessdate=2010-04-07 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114145621/http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=07%2F06%2F19%2F1433256 |archivedate=November 14, 2007 |deadurl=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=strange&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.comw.org/pda/0201strangevic.html#1.2 |title=Strange Victory: A critical appraisal of Operation Enduring Freedom and the Afghanistan war |publisher=Comw.org |accessdate=2010-04-07| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100505064107/http://www.comw.org/pda/0201strangevic.html| archivedate=May 5, 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HR&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/en/news/2009/03/26/human-rights-watch-letter-president-barack-obama-afghanistan |title=Human Rights Watch letter to President Obama on Afghanistan |publisher=Human Rights Watch |date=2009-03-26 |accessdate=2010-04-07| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100414114323/http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2009/03/26/human-rights-watch-letter-president-barack-obama-afghanistan| archivedate=April 14, 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Karzai's other vice-presidential candidate and former senior security advisor [[Mohammad Qasim Fahim]], along with Karzai backer and former energy minister [[Ismail Khan]], have also been listed by the human rights group as among the "worst perpetrators." Better known as Marshal Fahim, the vice-presidential candidate is accused of having been a former Communist secret police chief, murdering prisoners of war during the 1990s, running private armed militias, and involvement in kidnapping and other crimes after 2001. Fahim, a key U.S. ally in the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|U.S. invasion of Afghanistan]], had also previously served as Karzai's First Vice President and Minister of Defense, having been appointed to those positions in the interim and transitional governments installed after the 2001 invasion. Karzai is also being advised by [[Abdul Rasul Sayyaf]], who is said to have first invited [[Osama bin Laden]] to Afghanistan and has lobbied for an amnesty for warlords.&lt;ref name=farce/&gt;&lt;ref name=newopt/&gt;&lt;ref name=US2/&gt;&lt;ref name=former/&gt;&lt;ref name=boost/&gt;&lt;ref name=flames/&gt;&lt;ref name=Malalai/&gt;&lt;ref name=strange/&gt;&lt;ref name=HR/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.parliament.af/pme/showdoc.aspx?Id=12 |title=Parliament of Afghanistan |publisher=Parliament.af |accessdate=2010-04-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091113173536/http://www.parliament.af/pme/showdoc.aspx?Id=12 |archivedate=November 13, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=accused&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/27/world/asia/27kabul.html "Accused of Drug Ties, Afghan Official Worries U.S."]. ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt;

Most prominently covered was the dramatic return, three days before the election, of General [[Abdul Rashid Dostum]] from exile in Turkey as part of a deal to help bring President Karzai to victory. After allegedly [[Abdul Rashid Dostum#Akbar Bai kidnapping|kidnapping and beating up a political rival]], he was removed as Karzai's army chief of staff in late 2008 and disappeared into exile in Turkey. A key U.S. ally during the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|U.S. invasion of Afghanistan]], General Dostum is arguably the most notorious of Afghanistan's warlords, accused of massive human rights abuses, including the [[Dasht-i-Leili massacre]] of up to 2,000 Taliban who were suffocated in cargo containers in late 2001. He is also alleged to have crushed one of his own soldiers to death by tying him to the tracks of a tank.&lt;ref name=wizard/&gt;&lt;ref name=US2/&gt;&lt;ref name=boost/&gt;&lt;ref name=Malalai/&gt;&lt;ref name=strange/&gt;

Many Afghans hate these powerbrokers in the Afghan government, angered that they evaded accountability for their human rights abuses in the nineties and regained power and land through private militias funded by the millions of dollars they were paid by the [[CIA]] in the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|2001 U.S. invasion]].&lt;ref name=US2/&gt;&lt;ref name=flames/&gt;&lt;ref name=Malalai/&gt;&lt;ref name=accused/&gt;&lt;ref name=US&gt;{{Cite web|last=Landay |first=Jonathan S. |url=http://www.miamiherald.com/news/world/story/1192161.html |title=Afghan election fraught with political risk for U.S |website=Miami Herald |accessdate=2010-04-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091007020740/http://www.miamiherald.com/news/world/story/1192161.html |archivedate=October 7, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Analysts have suggested that part of Karzai's strategy was to make deals with warlord allies to deliver large blocs of votes in return for key positions and influence in his new government or other significant promises.&lt;ref name=newopt/&gt;&lt;ref name=wizard/&gt;&lt;ref name=boost/&gt;&lt;ref name=US/&gt;&lt;ref name=qtime/&gt;&lt;ref name=scheme/&gt;&lt;ref name=US3/&gt;

In the immediate aftermath of the election, analysts and diplomats suggested that Karzai's alliances with [[strongman (politics)|strongmen]] like General Dostum had paid off, delivering him large numbers of votes in the north. Fahim delivered Tajik votes for Karzai, Khalili brought Hazara support, and Dostum delivered Uzbek votes.&lt;ref name=newopt/&gt;&lt;ref name=wizard/&gt;&lt;ref name=US3/&gt;&lt;ref name=twoclaim/&gt;&lt;ref name=insult/&gt;&lt;ref name=pulls/&gt;

===Involvement of drug traffickers===
Karzai's vice-presidential candidate, Marshal [[Muhammad Qasim Fahim]], is also alleged to have long ties to drug trafficking, according to CIA reports from as early as 2002.&lt;ref name=accused/&gt;

A crucial U.S. ally as the military commander of the [[United Islamic Front for the Salvation of Afghanistan|Northern Alliance]], he worked closely with the [[CIA]] in the 2001 U.S. invasion of Afghanistan and was rewarded with millions of dollars in cash. He was then appointed First Vice President and Minister of Defense in the interim and transitional governments installed after the invasion, handling more millions of dollars sent by the U.S. in military aid to raise and arm a new Afghan army. CIA intelligence reports in 2002 showed that Fahim had a history of narcotics trafficking before the U.S. invasion, and that he was still actively involved after being installed as defense minister, trafficking heroin via cargo plane flights north through Russia, with aides in the Afghan Defense Ministry also involved.&lt;ref name=accused/&gt;

Hamid Karzai's election campaign manager for the south, and half-brother, [[Ahmed Wali Karzai]] – himself a candidate for re-election as the head of the Kandahar provincial council – has also long been alleged to have prominent drug trafficking ties, and was thought to control a significant proportion of Afghan heroin production. Numerous reports link him to the Afghan drug trade, according to officials from the White House, the [[State Department]] and the United States Embassy in Afghanistan. Officials at the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA) and the Office of the [[Director of National Intelligence]] have alleged that the [[White House]] favored a hands-off approach with Ahmed Wali Karzai because of his political position. Only a week before the election he denied a report from German news magazine [[Stern (magazine)|Stern]] that said that British special forces had found several tons of [[opium]] on his land. He claimed that this was being done just before the election to hurt Hamid Karzai's chance of re-election.&lt;ref name=link&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/05/world/asia/05afghan.html "Reports Link Karzai’s Brother to Afghanistan Heroin Trade"], ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Peter Graff |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/GCA-Afghanistan-Pakistan/idUSTRE57C2Z220090813 |title=Afghan president's brother denies drugs link |agency=Reuters  |date=2009-08-13 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=narco&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/27/magazine/27AFGHAN-t.html Is "Afghanistan a Narco-State?"], ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt;

According to current and former U.S. officials, Ahmed Wali Karzai was also being paid by [[CIA]], and had been for the past eight years. The New York Times [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/28/world/asia/28intel.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all reported] on October 27, 2009, stating: "''The C.I.A.’s practices also suggest that the United States is not doing everything in its power to stamp out the lucrative Afghan drug trade.''" Also alleged to have orchestrated much of the [[#Election fraud|fraud]] in favour of his brother in the presidential election, Ahmed Wali Karzai was himself re-elected to the Kandahar provincial council in the August 20 vote.&lt;ref name=CIA&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/28/world/asia/28intel.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all "Brother of Afghan Leader Said to Be Paid by C.I.A."], ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iec.org.af/results/Provincial/ElectedP28.html |title=IEC Final Uncertified Provincial Council Results 27-Oct-09 2:00 PM |publisher=Iec.org.af |accessdate=2010-04-07 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100407184620/http://www.iec.org.af/results/Provincial/ElectedP28.html |archivedate=April 7, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campaign==
The Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission (AIHRC), said insecurity had "severely limited freedom of movement and constrained freedom of expression for candidates".&lt;ref name=AlJ/&gt;&lt;ref name=willnot/&gt; Security concerns prevented presidential candidates from campaigning in most of the provinces, and candidates running for provincial councils were under constant threat wherever they went.&lt;ref name=ordinary/&gt; Widespread cultural opposition to women in public life, further compounded by the lack of security, made campaigning by women candidates very difficult or impossible in many parts of the country, according to EU observers.&lt;ref name=intimid/&gt; [[File:Afghan presidential election, 2009 poster 4.jpg|thumb|Election billboard for [[Hamid Karzai]] in the outskirt of Kandahar City.]]

A UN election monitoring report said in early August that there was mounting evidence that the government was using state resources to favour Karzai. An election commission report in July noted that state-run [[Radio Television Afghanistan]] had dedicated 71% of prime-time news coverage to the president.&lt;ref name=willnot/&gt;&lt;ref name=key/&gt;

Issues at the forefront in the election campaign were the insurgency and [[#Lack of security|lack of security]], the conduct of foreign troops in Afghanistan and [[Civilian casualties of the War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|civilian casualties]], [[#Election fraud|corruption]], and [[#Bribes being offered|poverty]]. Topics concerning women's rights were virtually never featured in news coverage of the electoral campaign, and women received almost no coverage in news reporting during the election, according to a European Union observation mission report.&lt;ref name=ordinary/&gt;&lt;ref name=intimid/&gt;&lt;ref name=key&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tolo.tv/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=261&amp;Itemid=42 |title=Foreign troops a key issue in Afghan presidential |publisher=Tolo.tv |date=2009-07-28 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mr. Karzai announced that he would invite the Taliban to a [[Loya Jirga]] (a grand tribal council) to try to restart stalled peace talks. A May pre-election poll reported that over two-thirds, 68%, of Afghans thought their government should hold talks and reconcile with the Taliban, and 18% did not know or refused to answer. Only 14% did not support government talks and reconciliation with the Taliban. Karzai also said the country was growing in stature and would be able to prevent "foreigners" from jailing Afghans, referring to the foreign military forces operating in their country.&lt;ref name=ordinary/&gt;&lt;ref name=willnot/&gt;&lt;ref name=IRI/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nationalpost.com/m/story.html?id=1894765 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20110104045050/http://www.nationalpost.com/m/story.html?id=1894765 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-01-04 |title=Candidates take campaigns across Afghanistan |website=National Post |location=Canada |date=2009-08-14 |accessdate=2010-04-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Ramazan Bashardost, the insurgency was motivated by the presence of foreign military forces in their country, by the presence of warlords and human rights abusers in the Western-backed regime, by the corruption in that government, and by poverty. Bashardost vowed that he would not allow foreign troops to stay in Afghanistan if elected.&lt;ref name=MrClean/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article6797093.ece Abdullah Abdullah throws down election gauntlet to President Karzai]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Abdul Salam Rocketi]], a former [[Mujahideen]] "[[freedom fighter]]" – whose name came from using rocket-propelled grenades to shoot down Soviet helicopters – and former Taliban commander, said he would announce an amnesty for all the [[insurgents]] if he won the election.&lt;ref name=ordinary/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author= |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=111349105 |title=Candidates' Stories Reflect Afghanistan's Struggle |publisher=Npr.org |date=2009-07-30 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Election Commission accredited 160,000 observers for the election. The Afghan Free and Fair Elections Foundation, the largest local monitoring group, said that it would have observers at 70 per cent of polling stations but couldn't observe the remainder because of security concerns.&lt;ref name=buy/&gt;

===Debates===
Two candidate debates took place before the August 20 election. The first debate was held on July 23 and was broadcast on [[Tolo TV]]. It was supposed to feature Karzai, Abdullah, and Ghani, though Karzai later declined to take part, with his campaign blaming Tolo TV for being biased against him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Carlotta |last=Gall |author2=Wafa, Abdul Waheed |title=Afghanistan’s Leader Skips an Election Debate, Claiming Bias |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/24/world/asia/24karzai.html |work=The New York Times |date=2009-07-23 |accessdate=2009-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second debate took place on August 16 on [[RTA TV]] (the state broadcaster) and [[Radio Free Afghanistan]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Abubakar |last=Siddique |title=In Landmark Debate, Afghan Presidential Contenders Challenge Karzai |url=http://www.rferl.org/content/In_Landmark_Debate_Afghan_Presidential_Contenders_Challenge_Karzai_On_Corruption_Warlords/1800957.html |publisher=Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty |date=2009-08-16 |accessdate=2009-08-18| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090820072029/http://www.rferl.org/content/In_Landmark_Debate_Afghan_Presidential_Contenders_Challenge_Karzai_On_Corruption_Warlords/1800957.html| archivedate=August 20, 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; involving Karzai, Ghani, and Bashardost, with Abdullah not participating.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Karzai, rivals debate as Afghan elections near |url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/asiapcf/08/16/afghanistan.elections/index.html |publisher=CNN |date=2009-08-16 |accessdate=2009-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pre-election polls===
The pre-election polls, funded by the U.S. government and conducted by Washington D.C.-based organizations, found Hamid Karzai leading his nearest rival, Abdullah Abdullah, by a wide margin, but suggested that he would not have the 50% support required to win the August 20 election outright, raising the prospect of a run off election in October.&lt;ref name=AlJ&gt;[http://english.aljazeera.net/news/asia/2009/08/200981194629468195.html Polls: Karzai could face run-off], ''[[Al Jazeera]]'', 2009-08-11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=willnot&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/afghanistan/6010602/Hamid-Karzai-will-not-win-Afghan-election-outright.html Hamid Karzai 'will not' win Afghan election outright], ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'', 2009-08-11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.voanews.com/english/2009-08-14-voa20.cfm New Poll Shows Afghan President Leading Race for a Second Term] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090816160138/http://www.voanews.com/english/2009-08-14-voa20.cfm |date=August 16, 2009 }}, ''[[Voice of America]]'', 2008-08-14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iri.org/mena/afghanistan/pdfs/2009%20August%2014%20Survey%20of%20Afghan%20Public%20Opinion%20July%2016-26,%202009.pdf Afghanistan Public Opinion Survey:July 16–26, 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090824005330/http://www.iri.org/mena/afghanistan/pdfs/2009%20August%2014%20Survey%20of%20Afghan%20Public%20Opinion%20July%2016-26%2C%202009.pdf |date=August 24, 2009 }}, ''[[International Republican Institute]]'', 2008-08-14&lt;/ref&gt;

The administering of public opinion polls for the 2009 presidential election was beset by numerous difficulties because of the lack of security, harsh geography, and lack of accurate demographic data, but analysts hoped that with improved sampling techniques the pre-election polls would be more predictive of [[#Post-election vote count and investigations|the outcome]] than they were in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Brian |last=Palmer |title=How Accurate Is Pre-Election Polling in Afghanistan? |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2225508/ |publisher=Slate |date=2009-08-17 |accessdate=2009-08-18| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090823115456/http://www.slate.com/id/2225508/| archivedate=August 23, 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lack of security==
Despite the surge of 30 thousand additional foreign military troops into Afghanistan in the three to four months leading up to the elections, and major military operations in the weeks and days ahead of the election, 12 out of Afghanistan's 34 provinces remained classified as "high risk" by the Afghan Ministry of Interior – meaning limited or no government presence – casting into doubt the ability of over one-third of the country to participate in the elections.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article6036318.ece Extra Nato troops for Afghan elections]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hires/&gt;&lt;ref name=USbrit&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://story.heraldglobe.com/index.php/ct/9/cid/15665b944045da4a/id/533627/cs/1/ |title=US, British soldiers killed in attacks in Afghanistan |publisher=Story.heraldglobe.com |date=2009-08-21 |accessdate=2010-04-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711163420/http://story.heraldglobe.com/index.php/ct/9/cid/15665b944045da4a/id/533627/cs/1/ |archivedate=July 11, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=breath&gt;{{Cite news|author=Canada |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/opinions/free-and-fair-elections-in-afghanistan-dont-hold-your-breath/article1255051/ |title=Free and fair elections in Afghanistan?

[[File:Aghanistan 2009 -- 'Go vote!'.jpg|thumb|'Go vote!' billboard prominently depicting armed security forces at polling stations.]]

A week and a half before the election, the Afghan government announced that it had hired 10,000 tribesmen to provide additional security for the election in almost two-thirds of Afghanistan's provinces. The men were being paid $160 a month, would be non-uniformed, and would use their own guns to secure polling stations in 21 out of Afghanistan's 34 provinces.&lt;ref name=willnot/&gt;&lt;ref name=hires&gt;[http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/world/breakingnews/Afghanistan-hires-10_000-tribesmen-for-security-at-polling-stations-in-presidential-election-52954712.html Afghanistan hires 10,000 tribesmen for security at polling stations in presidential election]&lt;/ref&gt;

ISAF officials stated two days before the election that the 60,000-troop ISAF military force in Afghanistan would halt all offensive operations on polling day in order to help Afghan forces maintain security for the presidential election. The order to halt operations and divert forces to help security followed a similar order issued to Afghan forces by Afghan President Hamid Karzai.&lt;ref name=halted&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2009/08/18/afghanistan-presidential-election-nato471.html |title=Offensives halted for Afghan election |publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]  |date=2009-08-18 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8185222.stm |title=Outrage over Afghan child deaths |publisher=BBC News   |date=2009-08-05 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the lack of security, the full list of polling centers was only announced on the actual polling day.&lt;ref name=shut/&gt;

A day before the election, hundreds of polling stations were ordered closed in parts of the country where military and police forces fear to go and would not be able to provide protection for election monitors. It had previously been estimated that as many as 700 out of 7,000 polling stations across the country would not open because of the widespread insecurity.&lt;ref name=shut/&gt;&lt;ref name=kandahar&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/aug/16/afghanistan-hamid-karzai-elections Karzai counts on tribal vote to win Kandahar] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090819133847/http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/aug/16/afghanistan-hamid-karzai-elections |date=August 19, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On election day, the Afghan election commission reported that only 6,200 polling stations had operated.&lt;ref name=hires/&gt;&lt;ref name=knockout&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/world/karzai-quick-to-claim-knockout-victory-20090821-etu8.html |title=Karzai quick to claim knockout victory |work=The Age |date=2009-08-22 |accessdate=2010-04-07 | location=Melbourne, Australia | first1=James | last1=Rupert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Kandahar province]], the mayor of [[Kandahar]] city, Ghulam Haider Hamidi, said that he would not go vote. "For the last three years the security is getting worse, day by day," Hamidi stated. "Even a child understands that the election day is not safe." His daughter, [[Rangina Hamidi]], a prominent women's advocate, said that it was not worth the risk and that she would not vote either:

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Attacks ahead of the vote===
Already in the month preceding the election day, there was a rise in violent incidents, all over Afghanistan, including a [[suicide bomber]] attack on the [[India]]n embassy in Kabul on July 7.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/kabul-suicide-bomber-kills-41-in-worst-attack-since-fall-of-taliban-862060.html |title=Kabul suicide bomber kills 41 in worst attack since fall of Taliban - Suspicion falls on Pakistani intelligence after embassy blast |work=The Independent |location=UK |date=2008-07-08 |accessdate=2010-04-07|first1=Miles|last1=Amoore|first2=Kim|last2=Sengupta}}&lt;/ref&gt; An ISAF spokesperson stated two days before the election that insurgent attacks had averaged 32 per day in the last 10 days, but had spiked up to 48 attacks per day within the last four days.&lt;ref name=insurgent&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2009/08/18/afghanistan-presidential-election-nato471.html |title=Insurgent attacks spike in run-up to Afghan vote |publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]  |date=2009-08-18 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the major attacks reported:

*On August 15, 2009, five days before the election, a suicide car bomb struck NATO's headquarters at the core of Kabul's most fortified district, in the equivalent of Baghdad's [[Green Zone]]. The massive blast that shook the city left seven people dead and 91 wounded, including several foreign soldiers, four Afghan soldiers, and a member of parliament. The attack, inside several rings of security around the fortified embassies and government buildings by the presidential palace, was confirmed by a Taliban spokesperson to have had as targets the NATO military headquarters (HQ ISAF) and the U.S. embassy less than 150 meters away, and to have been part of a campaign to disrupt the elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Fawad Muslim |url=http://www.afghanistannewscenter.com/news/2009/august/aug162009.html#11 |title=Afghanistan News August 16, 2009 |publisher=Afghanistannewscenter.com |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/crossroads-afghanistan/story/2009/08/15/kabul-attack.html |title=Canadian among injured in Kabul car bombing |publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]  |date=2009-08-15 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*On August 18, 2009, two days before the vote, rocket attacks or mortar rounds struck near the presidential palace in Kabul, and a suicide car bomb attack on a NATO convoy heading to a British military base killed nine people and wounded around 50. One NATO soldier was killed and two others wounded. Two UN staff members were killed, and a third was wounded. About 12 vehicles were destroyed and several surrounding buildings were damaged by the blast. A suicide bomb attack at the gates of an Afghan army base in the province of [[Uruzgan]] also killed three Afghan soldiers and two civilians.&lt;ref name=halted/&gt;&lt;ref name=shut/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author= |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/taliban-steps-up-election-terror-campaign-1774047.html |title=Taliban steps up election terror campaign - Suicide attack on Nato convoy kills 10 as violence sweeps Afghanistan before poll |work=The Independent |location=UK |date=2009-08-19 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*On August 19, 2009, gunmen seized control of a bank in downtown Kabul one day before the Afghan election. The bold raid was the third major attack in Kabul in five days, shattering the capital city's relative calm since the last major attacks there in February. Police reported that three fighters and three policemen were killed in the four-hour-long siege.&lt;ref name=gunmen&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2009/08/19/world/international-us-afghanistan.html "Gunmen In Bloody Kabul Siege on Eve Of Afghan Election"], ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media blackout imposed===
In decrees issued two days before the presidential election, the Afghan government imposed censorship for election day, barring news organizations from reporting any information about violence between 6 a.m. and 8 p.m. out of concern that reports of violence could reduce voter turnout and damage chances of staging a successful election. Low turnout could undermine the credibility of the election – and could also hurt Karzai's results in the election if not enough ethnic [[Pashtun people]], who form his base of support, turned out for the vote in the insurgent-dominated south of Afghanistan.&lt;ref name=bans&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/southAsiaNews/idINIndia-41825520090818 |title=Afghanistan bans reporting of attacks during vote |publisher=In.reuters.com |date=2009-08-18 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/19/world/asia/19afghan.html?em "Afghanistan Imposes Censorship on Election Day"], ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt;

On the eve of the election, police at the Kabul bank beat journalists and bystanders with rifle butts to keep them away from the scene where the bloody siege had taken place.&lt;ref name=gunmen/&gt;

The head of the Afghan Independent Journalists' Association (AIJA) said that the government censorship decrees would not stop Afghan and foreign journalists from providing information to the public during the critical election period: "It shows the weakness of the government and we condemn such moves to deprive people from accessing news."&lt;ref name=bans/&gt;

Human Rights Watch also criticized the news censorship, stating: "An attempt to censor the reporting of violence is an unreasonable violation of press freedoms."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/afp_asiapacific/view/449668/1/.html |title=Afghanistan calls for media blackout on polling day |publisher=Channelnewsasia.com |date=2009-08-19 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Free and Fair Election Foundation of Afghanistan called the Afghan government's limitation of media freedom on election day "a violation of democratic principles".&lt;ref name=FEFA/&gt;

===Election day violence===
{{quote|text="''This was one of the most violent days witnessed in Afghanistan in the last eight years.''"|sign=Rachel Reid, researcher for [[Human Rights Watch]] in Afghanistan&lt;ref name=twoclaim/&gt;}}

Afghan government officials reported that 73 incidents of violence had taken place in 15 provinces throughout the country during voting. That number of attacks represented a 50% spike over NATO figures for the [[#Attacks ahead of the vote|violence in the days]] leading up to the poll.&lt;ref name=killed26/&gt;&lt;ref name=poolsclose&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/21/world/asia/21afghan.html?bl=&amp;ei=5087&amp;en=dd1c0cc23ceed45e&amp;ex=1250913600&amp;pagewanted=all Turnout Seen as Uneven in Afghanistan as Polls Close], ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=keepsv&gt;{{Cite news|author1=Jon Boone |author2=Peter Beaumont |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/aug/20/afghanistan-elections-taliban-attack-voters |title=Afghanistan poll legitimacy fears as Taliban violence keeps voters away |work=Guardian |location=UK |date= 2009-08-20|accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government figures were impossible to verify, however, because of the government-imposed ban against reporting any information on violence. Anecdotal evidence suggested that the number of election day attacks could actually be much higher than the government reports.&lt;ref name=twoclaim/&gt;&lt;ref name=keepsv/&gt;

Another report since has placed the number of attacks on election day in Afghanistan at more than 130.&lt;ref name=USbrit/&gt; - Broken link in citation.

ISAF has since reported that more than 400 militant attacks occurred on election day – making it one of the most violent days in Afghanistan since 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8221709.stm |title=More Afghan poll results expected |publisher=BBC News   |date=2009-08-26 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; By comparison, ISAF had stated two days before the election that insurgent attacks had averaged 32 per day in the previous 10 days.&lt;ref name=insurgent/&gt;

In one of the worst reported attacks, militants stormed the town of [[Baghlan]] in northern Afghanistan, forcing all polling stations there to be closed down, with fighting lasting for most of the day. The district police chief was among those killed.&lt;ref name=tout/&gt;&lt;ref name=amid&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/Afghanistan/article6803686.ece Violence forces polls to shut amid low Afghan turnout]&lt;/ref&gt;

Rocket attacks, gun battles, and bomb blasts occurred across much of the country, closing scores of polling stations. The province of Kandahar alone was hit by 122 insurgent rockets. Rockets and mortars were launched into [[Kandahar]], the second largest city in the country, [[Lashkar Gah]], the capital of Helmand province, [[Tirin Kot]], the provincial capital of [[Uruzgan]], as well as other cities.&lt;ref name=FEFA/&gt;&lt;ref name=keepsv/&gt;&lt;ref name=tout/&gt;&lt;ref name=amid/&gt;

In a report dated October 21, 2009, issued after the release of the final certified election results for the August 20 vote, the [[United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan|UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan]] (UNAMA) and [[Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission]] (AIHRC) stated that on election day Afghanistan had suffered the highest number of attacks and intimidation the country had seen in ''some 15 years''. The timeframe of 15 years, going back to around August 1994, coincides with [[Ahmed Rashid]]'s description from [http://www.bookbrowse.com/excerpts/index.cfm?fuseaction=printable&amp;book_number=888 "''Taliban: Militant Islam, Oil and Fundamentalism in Central Asia''"] of when "''Afghanistan was in state of virtual disintegration just before the Taliban emerged at the end of 1994.

On August 25, 2009, a few hours after the first preliminary results were released, a cluster of vehicle bombs detonated together in a massive explosion that killed at least 43 people and wounded at least 65 in [[Kandahar]] city, in the bloodiest attack since July 2008. The force of the giant blast, at the center of the city in a district that includes U.N. facilities and an Afghan intelligence office, caused houses and buildings around to collapse, shattering windows around the city, and sending flames shooting into the sky. People miles outside of town felt the rumble. The main target appeared to be a Japanese company that had recently taken over a contract to build a road that insurgents had stalled for several months. A Taliban spokesman denied responsibility, saying the group condemned the attack.&lt;ref name=kills41&gt;[http://www.kansascity.com/news/world/story/1406087.html Explosion in Afghanistan kills at least 41] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/presidential-runoff-could-spell-trouble-for-afghanistan/article1264308/ |title=Presidential runoff could spell trouble for Afghanistan |work=The Globe and Mail |accessdate=2010-04-07 |location=Toronto, Canada |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090829161404/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/presidential-runoff-could-spell-trouble-for-afghanistan/article1264308/ |archive-date=August 29, 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=widens&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hvWEqwq3CrRvaQCmt21MfoYhjZJQD9AAJ9M82 Karzai widens lead over Abdullah in Afghan vote] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090907194704/https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hvWEqwq3CrRvaQCmt21MfoYhjZJQD9AAJ9M82 |date=September 7, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=seven&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/30/weekinreview/30filkins.html "Seven Days That Shook Afghanistan"], ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt;

On the same day, another bomb blast in southern Afghanistan killed four U.S. soldiers, bringing the total number of foreign troop deaths in Afghanistan this year to 295, making the 2009 death toll for foreign forces in Afghanistan the highest in the [[War in Afghanistan (2001-present)|eight-year war]] since the 2001 U.S. invasion.&lt;ref name=kills41/&gt;&lt;ref name=seven/&gt;

August 2009 ended as the deadliest month for U.S. troops in Afghanistan since the U.S. invasion in 2001. At least 51 American soldiers were killed in the month of the election, the highest monthly toll for the U.S. in the nearly eight-year-long war, surpassing the previous high of 45 in July. The month was also the worst in the war in terms of the overall death toll for all foreign military troops, with 77 deaths. Along with 76 deaths in July, the two months were by far the deadliest for the foreign military troops in Afghanistan, according to figures from icasualties.org.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2009/08/31/2048560.aspx |title=August deadliest month for U.S. military |publisher=Firstread.msnbc.msn.com |date=2009-08-31 |accessdate=2010-04-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090928234410/http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2009/08/31/2048560.aspx |archivedate=September 28, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.icasualties.org/oef/ |title=Coalition Military Fatalities By Year and Month |publisher=Icasualties.org |accessdate=2010-04-07 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100406083558/http://icasualties.org/oef/ |archivedate=April 6, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 12, 2009, a day on which the IEC was to have announced the first full preliminary results, waves of attacks engulfed Afghanistan. At least 66 people – including 24 civilians, 5 U.S. soldiers, and 26 Afghan policemen, soldiers, and guards – were killed in violence that swept across the country. The bloodshed seemed to demonstrate the ability of insurgents, including the Taliban, to carry out attacks in most parts of the country despite the surge to a record number of foreign military troops in the eight-year war.&lt;ref name=engulf&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/13/world/asia/13afghan.html?hp "Wave of Attacks Engulfs Afghanistan"], ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dozens&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/homepageCrisis/idUSISL479504._CH_.2400 |title=Afghan attacks kill dozens; Karzai leads in poll |agency=Reuters  |date=2009-09-12 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=spate&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.voanews.com/english/2009-09-12-voa12.cfm |title=Spate of Attacks Across Afghanistan Kills Dozens |publisher=Voanews.com |date=2009-09-12 |accessdate=2010-04-07 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100330235410/http://www1.voanews.com/english/2009-09-12-voa12.cfm |archivedate=March 30, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=press&gt;{{Cite news|author=Declan Walsh |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/sep/13/hamid-karzai-power-sharing-afghanistan |title=Pressure grows in Afghanistan for Hamid Karzai to strike a deal |work=Guardian |location=UK |date= 2009-09-13|accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Possible ethnic imbalance===
The lack of security and its effects on voter registration, polling station accessibility, and voter turnout – mainly in regions populated by Afghanistan's [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] tribes, which make up 32-37% of the country's population – have raised serious concerns about an ethnic imbalance in the Afghan election.&lt;ref name=farce/&gt;&lt;ref name=qtime&gt;{{Cite web|last=Margolis |first=Eric |url=http://www.torontosun.com/comment/columnists/eric_margolis/2009/08/23/10569911-sun.html |title=Quittin' time in Afghanistan |website=Toronto Sun  |date=2009-08-23 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=marred/&gt;&lt;ref name=mock&gt;{{Cite news|author=Rosie DiManno |url=https://www.thestar.com/News/World/article/686508 |title=Afghan vote called 'mockery' |work=Toronto Star  |date= 2009-08-26|accessdate=2010-04-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text="''There are districts that I am 100 percent sure no government worker can go to - But you are telling me that still so many people registered? I don't believe it.''"|sign=Roshanak Wardak, Afghan member of parliament from Wardak Province&lt;ref name=marred/&gt;}}

According to leaders and residents of [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] districts, many voter registration centers in their districts never opened during the registration period and few people even left their homes, let alone registered. Provincial officials have also said that election registration teams rarely, if ever, dared to venture outside of the district capitals.&lt;ref name=marred/&gt;

In the province of [[Maidan Wardak Province|Wardak]], with six of the province's eight districts controlled by insurgents, this resulted in the two [[Hazara people|Hazara]]-dominated districts of the province forming the bulk of the new voters registered. Independent Election Commission (IEC) Deputy Chief Electoral Officer Zekra Barakzai stated that "the registration numbers in Pashtun districts are very low."&lt;ref name=marred/&gt;

According to Habibullah Rafeh, a policy analyst with the Afghan Academy of Sciences, there could be an ethnic imbalance if the same problem was reproduced in other Pashtun regions of Afghanistan.&lt;ref name=marred/&gt;

In Helmand province, where 62% of the population is [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] and where U.S. Marines conducted major offensives, only 75 people were found to have been registered in one town of 2,000 residents.&lt;ref name=fraud/&gt;

For those that did register to vote, the absence of polling stations because of lack of security may have been the next obstacle. In [[Helmand]] province, Haji Mohammad, from Marja district, said that he sold all his family’s voting cards because there were no polling stations in their area.&lt;ref name=buy/&gt;

On the day before the election, Afghan election officials ordered 443 polling stations within insurgent territory in the Pashtun-dominated provinces of [[Paktika]], [[Paktia]], [[Khost Province|Khost]], [[Zabul]], [[Helmand]] and [[Kandahar Province|Kandahar]] to stay closed because of the lack of security. While the Afghan election commission had until recently presented a figure of 7,000 polling stations, on election day it reported that only 6,200 polling stations had actually operated.&lt;ref name=shut/&gt;&lt;ref name=knockout/&gt;

Compounded with its effects on voter registration and polling station accessibility, the lack of security also seems to have been a major factor in the much [[#Low voter turnout|lower voter turnout]] in the [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]]-dominated south of the country, where turnout was as low as 5–10%, effectively disenfranchising the region.&lt;ref name=qtime/&gt;&lt;ref name=twoclaim/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/22/world/asia/22kabul.html "Afghan Election Poses New Tests for Washington"], ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt;

On election day, Abdul Hamid, a tribal elder from [[Paghman District]] – a mostly [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] district bordering Wardak province – was reported as insisting that 40 to 50% of eligible [[Paghman District|Paghman]] voters had not received voting cards, and therefore could not cast a ballot.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/212916/ |title=Anti-Climax in Afghanistan |website=Newsweek |accessdate=2010-04-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090928045812/http://www.newsweek.com/id/212916 |archivedate=September 28, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aims.org.af/afg/dist_profiles/unhcr_district_profiles/centra/kabul/paghmani.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051027173613/http://www.aims.org.af/afg/dist_profiles/unhcr_district_profiles/centra/kabul/paghmani.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2005-10-27 |title=UNHCR profile for Paghman District |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-04-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Election fraud==
Starting in December 2008, journalist [[Anand Gopal]] and others have reported extensively on the widespread instances of fraud in the voter registration process, with the registration rolls including "phantom voters" and multiple registration cards issued to a single registrant, amongst numerous other problems.&lt;ref name=shut&gt;{{Cite news|last=Farmer |first=Ben |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/afghanistan/6050245/Afghan-polling-stations-shut-amid-fears-of-voting-fraud.html |title=Afghan polling stations shut amid fears of voting fraud |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK |date=2009-08-19 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=marred/&gt;

Two days before the election, an investigation by the [[BBC]] also found and reported evidence of widespread [[electoral fraud]] and corruption in the Afghan presidential election.&lt;ref name=buy/&gt;&lt;ref name=marred/&gt;&lt;ref name=unearth&gt;{{Cite news|last=Pannell |first=Ian |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8207315.stm |title=Afghan election fraud is unearthed |publisher=BBC News   |date=2009-08-18 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Voting cards being sold===
After being informed that voting cards were being sold in the capital, [[Kabul]], an Afghan working for the BBC posed as a potential buyer and was offered one thousand voting cards on the spot, for $10 (£6) per card. Samples provided were all authentic with the name, photo and home details of the voter on them.&lt;ref name=unearth/&gt; Other parties also offered to sell the BBC investigators thousands of votes, and some sellers have even been arrested by the authorities.&lt;ref name=unearth/&gt;

A flourishing black market in voter registration cards has also sprung up across the south of Afghanistan where they were being sold for £6 to £18 each.&lt;ref name=shut/&gt; The Free and Fair Election Foundation of Afghanistan (FEFA), an independent election monitoring organisation, had also collected evidence of election fraud, particularly in the voter registration process.&lt;ref name=buy/&gt;&lt;ref name=unearth/&gt; The monitoring group found that in many places people were being issued multiple voting cards, that voting cards were often issued for children, and that stacks of voting cards were given to men who falsely claimed that they were for women in their households.&lt;ref name=unearth/&gt; Long lists of imaginary female relatives were found to have been concocted during an attempt to update the electoral roll. In Kandahar, "Britney Jamilia Spears" appeared among the names registered.&lt;ref name=kandahar/&gt; FEFA found that multiple registrations of a single person were taking place in at least 40% of all centers in one phase of the registration drive, and in one case, investigators found that about 500 voting registration cards were given to just one individual in [[Badghis province]].&lt;ref name=marred/&gt;

The independent election observers also reported that as many as one in five registrations were for people under the voting age – in many cases as young as 12 years old.&lt;ref name=scheme&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=48142 |title=Karzai and Warlords Mount Massive Vote Fraud Scheme |publisher=Ipsnews.net |date=2009-08-19 |accessdate=2010-04-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100524074225/http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=48142 |archivedate=May 24, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a pre-election report by the Afghanistan Analyst Network, a Kabul-based group of foreign experts, as many as three million voters on the register were feared to not exist. The huge numbers of vote cards issued for phantom voters have raised concerns about massive electoral fraud.&lt;ref name=insult&gt;{{Cite news|author= |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/aug/23/havana-marking-afghanistan-election |title=It is insulting to Afghans to declare their election a success |work=Guardian |location=UK |date=2008-05-29 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kandahar/&gt;&lt;ref name=tout/&gt; Shahrzad Akbar, a senior analyst with FEFA, stated that because the monitoring body was only able to investigate a few parts of the country, the election irregularities and abuses could be even more widespread:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"''We couldn't observe how it went in every single district or village. I am sure that there are cases of multiple card distribution that we don't know about. But those incidents that we do know about caused us enough concern to contact the Independent Election Commission and say, 'please prevent this!'''"&lt;ref name=unearth/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Bribes being offered===
There has also been evidence that people working for candidates have deliberately tried to influence the outcome of the election by offering bribes to buy large numbers of votes.&lt;ref name=unearth/&gt;

In [[Baghlan province]], a tribal elder and former military commander described how the voter fraud scheme worked. Within the hierarchical structure of Afghanistan, key local leaders like him have the ability to persuade large numbers of people to vote for one candidate or another. He reported that he and other local leaders had been approached by teams from the two leading contenders of the presidential election with monetary bribes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"''If one candidate gives $10,000, then the other gives $20,000 and a third one offers even more. It has become such a lucrative and competitive business. I don't know where they get their money from.''"&lt;ref name=unearth/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to a U.S. government-funded poll released the week before the poll, the two leading contenders in the election were [[Hamid Karzai]], the Pashtun incumbent, and Dr. [[Abdullah Abdullah]], the former foreign minister with strong ties to the former [[Northern Alliance]].&lt;ref name=halted/&gt;&lt;ref name=shut/&gt;

In [[Helmand]] province, tribal leaders and local people also described a systematic attempt by Karzai supporters to collect or buy voter registration cards from people in an electoral fraud scheme allegedly orchestrated by Karzai's half-brother and campaign manager for the south, [[Ahmed Wali Karzai]].&lt;ref name=buy&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article6792729.ece President Karzai’s supporters ‘buy’ votes for Afghanistan election], ''[[The Times]]'', 2009-08-12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kandahar/&gt;

===Armed coercion===
Along with bribes, cases of threats by [[#Prominent involvement of warlords|warlords]] have also been reported. In [[Herat]] province, a village elder said he had been threatened with "very unpleasant consequences" by a local commander if the residents of his village failed to vote for Karzai.&lt;ref name=breath/&gt;&lt;ref name=scheme/&gt;

Other instances of coercion in the electoral process – ranging from threatening phone calls to beatings and killings – by government agents (particularly [[#Prominent involvement of warlords|security forces and armed factions aligned with certain candidates]]) have been extensively documented.&lt;ref name=breath/&gt;

The hiring of 10,000 tribesmen by the Karzai government to secure polling stations in 21 out of 34 provinces, without uniforms and using their own guns, also raised questions of voter intimidation.&lt;ref name=farce/&gt;&lt;ref name=breath/&gt;&lt;ref name=willnot/&gt;

During the voting, intimidation of voters by some powerful candidates, in particular local candidates running for provincial council seats, was reported by observers.&lt;ref name=intimid/&gt;

In the northern province of [[Balkh Province|Balkh]], people were forced at gunpoint to vote for former foreign minister Dr. [[Abdullah Abdullah]], according to complaints lodged with the election commission by former finance minister Dr. [[Ashraf Ghani]] in the days after the vote.&lt;ref name=UNwarns/&gt;

Meanwhile, both the Karzai and Abdullah camps have accused each other's side of having engaged in intimidation of voters, including allegations from Abdullah of intimidation and other interference by the head of the border police in Kandahar province, [[General Abdul Raziq]], and his forces on behalf of Karzai.&lt;ref name=clouds/&gt;

===Hundreds of polling stations shut down===
The day before the election, Afghan election officials ordered more than 440 polling stations to stay closed during the vote out of fears of election fraud. The Independent Election Commission (IEC) said Hamid Karzai's supporters were trying to keep open polling stations deep within insurgent-held regions where the army and police fear going and where voting could not be properly monitored by observers.&lt;ref name=shut/&gt;

An international observer monitoring the election proceedings said that the IEC had come under "a lot of pressure" from the Karzai administration to open more polling stations in the provinces of [[Paktika]], [[Paktia]], [[Khost Province|Khost]], [[Zabul]], [[Helmand]] and [[Kandahar province|Kandahar]] where the government has little control beyond major urban centers.&lt;ref name=shut/&gt;

Registration figures suggested that concerted preparations for vote-rigging had taken place in Khost and Paktia. Records suspiciously showed that twice as many women as men had registered to vote, while a thriving black market in voting cards has appeared with cards being bought and sold by the thousands for £6 to £18 each.&lt;ref name=afraud/&gt;&lt;ref name=shut/&gt;

===Systemic conflicts of interest===
Government workers, required to be impartial in the election, were found by election observers to have actively and illegally campaigned for candidates.&lt;ref name=unearth/&gt; Investigators have also found members of political parties occupying positions as election officials.&lt;ref name=intimid&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/23/world/asia/23afghan.html "Intimidation and Fraud Observed in Afghan Election"], ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=marred/&gt;

The most problematic conflict of interest may be the fact that the country's Independent Elections Commission (IEC) that oversees the whole election is not "independent" of the Karzai administration at all. All seven of its members were appointed to the commission by Hamid Karzai, and its chairman, a former Karzai advisor in [[Herat province]], has reportedly made no secret of his partisan support for the incumbent president.&lt;ref name=clouds&gt;{{Cite news|author1=Jon Boone |author2=Daniel Nasaw |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/aug/23/afghanistan-elections-hamid-karzai |title=Cloud hangs over legitimacy of Afghan election result as &amp;#124; World news |work=The Guardian |location=UK |date= 2009-08-23|accessdate=2010-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=scheme/&gt;&lt;ref name=intimid/&gt;&lt;ref name=bias&gt;{{Cite web|last=Duparcq |first=Emmanuel |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5i_sTDs1IFG4TmQ47XKOIsoEnmQnA |title='Biased' Afghan vote commission under fire |date=2009-08-24 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the days following the election, Karzai's main challenger, Dr. [[Abdullah Abdullah]], denounced the chairman of the IEC as working for Mr. Karzai. Foreign election observers have also criticized the Independent Election Commission as being full of Karzai appointees.&lt;ref name=clouds/&gt;&lt;ref name=bias/&gt;

The BBC has reported that the Independent Election Commission has been accused of not doing enough to prevent abuses that have been brought to its attention.&lt;ref name=unearth/&gt;

FEFA, the country's largest independent election monitoring organization, has also raised questions about the impartiality of Independent Election Commission (IEC) local officials, and noted that questions about IEC impartiality constituted "a trend that has persisted throughout the electoral process". Throughout election day, numerous reports were received of local IEC officials improperly interfering in the voting process.&lt;ref name=FEFA&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.fefa.org.af/pressrelease/FEFA-Election%20Day%20Statement-Aug20.pdf |title=FEFA - Election Day Press Statement 20 August 2009 |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-04-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090902082723/http://fefa.org.af/pressrelease/FEFA-Election%20Day%20Statement-Aug20.pdf |archivedate=September 2, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bias/&gt;

U.S.-based [[Human Rights Watch]] said the independence of the Independent Election Commission was compromised by Karzai's appointment of the IEC chairman without parliamentary oversight and accused the IEC chairman of displaying "clear bias".&lt;ref name=bias/&gt;

===Voting irregularities===
Election day news included reports of widespread electoral fraud throughout the day.&lt;ref name=poolsclose/&gt; At one polling station in [[Nad-e-Ali]], in the [[Helmand]] province, just over 400 people had voted by 1 p.m., but three hours later, the figure had apparently rose to some 1,200, despite that guards had hardly seen any voters. Election officials were later seen counting piles of ballot papers, without checking simply declaring the votes had been cast for Karzai.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/kim-sengupta-a-dubious-litmus-test-for-the-poll-1775228.html |title=Kim Sengupta: A dubious litmus test for the poll - Our man in Helmand questions the election's integrity |work=The Independent |location=UK |date=2009-08-21 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as 8 a.m., only one hour after the polls had opened, officials at the U.S. embassy in Kabul were receiving complaints of fraud.&lt;ref name=poolsclose/&gt;

[[Ashraf Ghani]], one of the presidential candidates and also reported as favoured by the U.S. for a "chief executive" position to run the country regardless of the election outcome, e-mailed U.S. officials with reports of his opponents stuffing election ballot boxes. Other candidates also lodged similar complaints with U.S. officials – who referred them instead to the national election body.&lt;ref name=farce/&gt;&lt;ref name=poolsclose/&gt;&lt;ref name=obama/&gt;&lt;ref name=squand/&gt;

Abdullah, the main opponent to Hamid Karzai in the presidential election, said that his supporters were lodging complaints of election fraud, in particular from [[Kandahar province]]. Hours after the polls closed, his deputy campaign manager, Saleh Mohammad Registani, alleged that "very large scale" fraud had taken place in at least three of the country's 34 provinces, including [[ballot stuffing|ballot box stuffing]].&lt;ref name=killed26/&gt;&lt;ref name=poolsclose/&gt; [[File:Inked finger.jpg|thumb|An Afghan man showing his inked finger, which was part of the procedure to prevent people from voting twice.]]

Presidential candidate [[Mirwais Yasini]], the deputy speaker of the lower house of parliament, lodged 31 complaints with Afghanistan's Independent Election Commission (IEC), telling the BBC that both main camps had engaged in widespread electoral fraud.&lt;ref name=fraud2&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8215612.stm |title=Afghan polling 'marked by fraud' |publisher=BBC News   |date=2009-08-22 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Election monitor group FEFA reported receiving cases throughout the voting day of "improper interference" by local Independent Election Commission (IEC) staff in the voting process, raising continued concerns about the impartiality of IEC election officials. Their post-election provisional report also detailed cases of election officials being ejected from polling stations by representatives of candidates.&lt;ref name=FEFA/&gt;&lt;ref name=fraud/&gt;&lt;ref name=fraud2/&gt;

Photojournalist Peter Nicholls of ''[[The Times]]'' photographically [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/Afghanistan/article6804730.ece documented] an apparent case of ballot box stuffing amid low voter turnout in Pul-e-Charkhi, in [[Kabul province]].&lt;ref name=poll&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/Afghanistan/article6804730.ece Afghan polling station gave clear image of nothing but a box of tricks]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a further irregularity, the supposedly indelible ink used to mark the index finger of voters to prevent voting more than once was found to be easily removable in many instances – a repeat of a problem that had also occurred in the 2004 and 2005 elections. According to Havana Marking, director of a documentary on the elections, by 9 a.m. people were bleaching their fingers and casting ballots twice. The documentary makers filmed "a cafe full of young men laughing and deciding who to vote for the second time".&lt;ref name=killed26/&gt;&lt;ref name=newopt/&gt;&lt;ref name=scheme/&gt;&lt;ref name=insult/&gt;&lt;ref name=keepsv/&gt;

Complaints about the ink were made by the camps of all three of the main challengers in the presidential race. Aides to Dr. Abdullah reported that at the polling station where he had cast his ballot, voters had been able to clean the ink from their fingertips within minutes. [[Ashraf Ghani]]'s team had reports of inferior ink that was easily removed being used in the western city of [[Herat]]. Presidential candidate and former planning minister Dr. [[Ramazan Bashardost]] charged that the indelible ink could be washed off easily, and lodged an official complaint endorsed by a member of the Election Complaints Commission. The former minister, who had been running third in the pre-election polls, said: "This is not an election. This is a comedy."&lt;ref name=tout/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/Afghanistan/article6804584.ece 'Indelible' ink used to mark Afghan voters may stain election success]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flawed election==
Western officials conceded the election would be flawed, admitting that there had been election corruption, that there was apathy, that the lack of security would stop some from voting, and that precautions designed to prevent fraud would be ineffective in many parts of the country where election monitors cannot go.&lt;ref name=afraud/&gt;&lt;ref name=buy/&gt;&lt;ref name=fraud&gt;{{Cite news |last=Press |first=Associated |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/sns-ap-as-afghanistan,0,4315489.story?track=rss |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091003215921/http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/sns%2Dap%2Das%2Dafghanistan%2C0%2C4315489.story?track%3Drss |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2009-10-03 |title=Afghan vote fraud allegations mount, threatening credibility of election |work=Chicago Tribune |date=2010-02-22 |accessdate=2010-04-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=unearth/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/state-of-afghanistan-deteriorating-top-us-commander-says/article1261705/ |title=State of Afghanistan 'deteriorating,' top U.S. commander says |work=The Globe and Mail|accessdate=2010-04-07 |location=Toronto, Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The international community accepted that fraud would be inevitable in the presidential election, but hoped that it could be minimised to an "acceptable level where it will not alter the final result".&lt;ref name=shut/&gt;

Former U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan [[Ronald E. Neumann]] put the odds of an election that would appear "good enough" at "50-50".&lt;ref name=scheme/&gt;

Additionally, 7 million fewer Afghans were even allowed to vote than in the last election. Thousands of complaints were filed, and there was blatant evidence of corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.inwent.org/ez/articles/184618/index.en.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615095610/http://www.inwent.org/ez/articles/184618/index.en.shtml |archivedate=June 15, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Low voter turnout==
[[NATO]] officials announced in March 2009 that 15.6 million voters had registered to vote, roughly half of the country's population, and that 35 to 38 percent of registered voters were women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory?id=7057152 |title=NATO: 15.6 million Afghans are registered to vote |accessdate=2009-03-12 |agency=Associated Press |date=2009-03-11 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those registration numbers were disputed, however, by the Free and Fair Election Foundation of Afghanistan and media reports, which suggested [[#Election fraud|widespread fraudulent activity]] in the election process.&lt;ref name=afraud&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/Afghanistan/article6802683.ece Afghanistan votes amid fear of Taleban attacks and alleged fraud] [http://wayback.vefsafn.is/wayback/20100418021010/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/afghanistan/article6802683.ece Archived copy] at the Icelandic Web Archive (April 18, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=buy/&gt;&lt;ref name=marred&gt;{{Cite news |author=[[Anand Gopal]] |title=Afghan voter registration marred |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/1224/p06s01-wosc.html |publisher=[[The Christian Science Monitor]] |date=2008-12-24 |accessdate=2009-08-18 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.csmonitor.com%2FWorld%2FAsia-South-Central%2F2008%2F1224%2Fp06s01-wosc.html&amp;date=2010-02-18 |archivedate=February 18, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=unearth/&gt;

While UN, American and Afghan officials quickly hailed the election as a success, evidence from observers on the ground and from journalists suggested that the Taliban had succeeded in deterring many Afghans from voting.&lt;ref name=mixed/&gt;&lt;ref name=twoclaim/&gt;&lt;ref name=insult/&gt;&lt;ref name=keepsv/&gt;&lt;ref name=tout/&gt;&lt;ref name=amid/&gt;&lt;ref name=mock/&gt;&lt;ref name=bias/&gt;

At the end of the voting day, top election official Zekria Barakzai estimated the [[voter turnout]] across the country at around 40–50%. One Western diplomat slapped aside 50 percent as a "joke". On August 21, [[The New York Times]] [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/22/world/asia/22afghan.html article] reported that overall turnout was expected to be about 40%. On August 26, [[The Daily Telegraph]] reported that turnout may have been little more than 35% nationwide and was less than 10% in some districts of Helmand and Kandahar.&lt;ref name=killed26&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleid=498012 |title=Low turnout seen in Afghan election; 26 killed |publisher=Philstar.com |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=twoclaim/&gt;&lt;ref name=keepsv/&gt;&lt;ref name=Abdullah&gt;{{Cite news|last=Farmer |first=Ben |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/afghanistan/6096661/Afghanistan-election-Hamid-Karzai-widens-lead-over-Abdullah-Abdullah.html |title=Afghanistan election: Hamid Karzai widens lead over Abdullah Abdullah |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK |date=2009-08-27 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Figures released by the IEC on August 31, when the ballots from almost half of the country's polling stations had been counted, pointed to a turnout of only 30% to 35%. Most of the ballots counted to that point were from the north of the country.&lt;ref name=latest&gt;{{Cite web|author=Siek, Stephanie |url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,4615076,00.html |title=Latest Afghan vote count shows Karzai still in lead |publisher=Dw-world.de |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Independent election observers in the country almost all agreed that voter turnout was far lower than in the previous presidential election in 2004.&lt;ref name=poolsclose/&gt;&lt;ref name=mock/&gt;

The turnout was uneven across the country with low turnout in the south and east of Afghanistan, suppressed by lack of security and disenchantment, while vote participation was somewhat higher in the more stable north and west of the country, including some reports of long lines of voters seen outside polling stations.&lt;ref name=mixed/&gt;&lt;ref name=poolsclose/&gt;&lt;ref name=twoclaim/&gt;

Voter turnout in the eastern city of [[Jalalabad]] was low at no more than 20–30%, according to election observer Tim Fairbank: "A lot of people have told us they were afraid to vote, and afraid to have their fingers dipped in ink because of the Taliban's threats." The government, on the other hand, was expected to claim that it was more like 60% in the area.&lt;ref name=amid/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/Afghanistan/article6802964.ece?token=null&amp;offset=0&amp;page=1 Afghanistan election: rockets fired as voting begins]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]]-dominated southern provinces, turnout was as low as 5–10%, according to one Western official. In some parts of the country almost no women voted.&lt;ref name=twoclaim/&gt;&lt;ref name=twoclaim/&gt;

In [[Khan Neshin]], [[Helmand province]], in the south of Afghanistan, election officials estimated that only 250 to 300 people – out of an estimated population of 35,000 to 50,000 in a region larger than [[Connecticut]] – showed up to vote at the single polling station available for the area. Not a single woman voted, according to the district governor, Massoud Ahmad Rassouli Balouch.&lt;ref name=rockets&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/21/world/asia/21sceneoppel.html?hp "Rockets and Intimidation Deter Voters in the South"], ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt;

In Babaji district of Helmand province, where 10 British soldiers were killed in [[Operation Panther's Claw]], a British offensive launched against insurgents a few weeks ahead of the elections, reports indicated that only about 150 people voted out of a population of 55,000. One election observer said no more than 15 people voted at the polling centre where he was based.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8249983.stm |title=Afghan fraud fear despite UK push |publisher=BBC News   |date=2009-09-11 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another [[Helmand province]] district of 70,000 people, barely 500 people voted, while in one town of 2,000 residents, only 50 people voted.&lt;ref name=fraud/&gt;

Voter turnout in [[Kandahar]] city, Afghanistan's second largest city, was estimated to be down 40% from the previous election in 2004. Noor Ahmad, a resident of Zerai District, said: "The turnout is very low, perhaps less than 5 percent."&lt;ref name=keepsv/&gt;&lt;ref name=tout/&gt;

In the [[Spin Boldak]] district of [[Kandahar province]], RFE/RL's [[Radio Free Afghanistan]] correspondent in Kandahar, Dawa Khan Meenapal, said that people voted heavily but overall turnout was lower than in past elections, and that participation by women was very low.&lt;ref name=mixed/&gt;

In [[Lashkargah]], the provincial capital of [[Helmand]], Mohammad Aliyas Daee, a [[Radio Free Afghanistan]] correspondent in Helmand, similarly reported that "the overall participation of women was negligible." Voter turnout, by one estimate, was at below 20% in the city, considered to be more secure than the rest of the province.&lt;ref name=mixed/&gt;&lt;ref name=tout/&gt;

In the southeastern [[Uruzgan province]], the deputy police chief, Mohammad Nabi, estimated the province-wide turnout to be less than 40%, saying that "people had no interest".&lt;ref name=tout/&gt;

Voting in the capital city [[Kabul]] also appeared to have been depressed, with one estimate placing turnout at only 30%. Officials, witnesses, and journalists at several polling stations reported low participation numbers. Afghan journalist and research analyst, Abdulhadi Hairan, observed that the low voter turnout in Kabul resulted in reporters and cameramen having to wait nearly to midday before having enough voter interviews to send back to their news organizations. Dr. [[Abdullah Abdullah]], Karzai's main opponent in the presidential election, called the low voter turnout in Kabul "unsatisfactory."&lt;ref name=poolsclose/&gt;&lt;ref name=insult/&gt;&lt;ref name=keepsv/&gt;&lt;ref name=tout/&gt;&lt;ref name=poll/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abdulhadihairan.com/2009/08/majority-of-a-low-turnout-votes-for-karzai/ |title=Majority of a low turnout voted for Karzai (report and pictures) Abdulhadi Hairan |publisher=Abdulhadihairan.com |date=2009-08-20 |accessdate=2010-04-08 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090822032905/http://www.abdulhadihairan.com/2009/08/majority-of-a-low-turnout-votes-for-karzai/ |archivedate=August 22, 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Official election monitors and the UN placed voter turnout in the election at only around 30–33%.&lt;ref name=UNAMA/&gt;&lt;ref name=delay&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2009/10/21/a_crash_course_in_democracy?page=full |title=Afghanistan's runoff election must be delayed |publisher=Foreignpolicy.com |date=2009-10-21 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a joint report with the [[Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission]], issued October 21, 2009, after the release of the final certified election results for the August 20 vote, the [[United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan]] stated:

:"''One third of registered voters, a figure which is significantly lower than the previous elections, are understood to have cast their ballots,''"&lt;ref name=UNAMA/&gt;

The approximate quantity and guarded wording of the UN statement indicated a voter turnout of no higher than 33%.&lt;ref name=Dr&gt;{{Cite news|last=Farmer |first=Ben |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/afghanistan/6425178/Dr-Abdullah-makes-history-in-challenge-to-Afghanistans-president-Hamid-Karzai.html |title=Dr Abdullah 'makes history' in challenge to Afghanistan's president Hamid Karzai |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK |date=2009-10-24 |accessdate=2010-04-07| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100223063428/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/afghanistan/6425178/Dr-Abdullah-makes-history-in-challenge-to-Afghanistans-president-Hamid-Karzai.html| archivedate=February 23, 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The figures of the Independent Election Commission, adjusted for 1,065,031 votes discarded as fraudulent, indicate a voter turnout of 31.4%:

When the IEC released its [[#September 16 uncertified final result|September 16 uncertified final results]] with a total of 5,662,758 "valid votes", the IEC claimed a voter turnout of 38.7%.&lt;ref name=EU/&gt;&lt;ref name=secures&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.france24.com/en/20090916-karzai-secures-546-afghan-vote-first-count |title=Karzai secures 54.6% of Afghan vote: first count |publisher=France24.com |date=2009-09-16 |accessdate=2010-04-07 }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fraudulent&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/world/afghan-election15m-votes-fraudulent-20090917-fryc.html |title=Afghan election:1.5m votes 'fraudulent' |work=Sydney Morning Herald  |date=2009-09-17 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=plea&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-world/karzai-rival-makes-afghan-runoff-fraud-plea-20091022-h997.html |title=Karzai rival makes Afghan run-off fraud plea |publisher=News.smh.com.au |date=2009-10-22 |accessdate=2010-04-07 | first=Lynne | last=O'donnell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the ECC's official audit findings, the IEC's [[#October 21 certified final result|October 21 final certified results]] for the August 20 election presented a total of 4,597,727 "valid votes". 1,065,031 votes or 18.8% of the votes had been invalidated between the IEC's September 16 results and its final certified results.&lt;ref name=EU/&gt;&lt;ref name=IEC2/&gt;

A proportional 18.8% reduction of the IEC's September 16 voter turnout figure of 38.7% gives a voter turnout figure of 31.4%.&lt;ref name=plea/&gt;

In an article published October 21, 2009, in [[Foreign Policy]] magazine, J. Scott Carpenter, an official election observer for the August 20 vote, placed the voter turnout at 30%.&lt;ref name=delay/&gt;

==Post-election vote count and investigations==

===August, rampant allegations of fraud===

Ballot counting began immediately after the polls closed on August 20, with official preliminary results to be declared two weeks later on September 3, official final results to be declared two weeks after that on September 17, and a run-off, if required, to be held within two weeks after that.&lt;ref name=mixed/&gt;&lt;ref name=poolsclose/&gt;&lt;ref name=twoclaim&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/22/world/asia/22afghan.html "Two Claim to Lead Afghan Race for President"], ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tout/&gt;

Within a day into the vote counting, however, both the Karzai and Abdullah camps were making claims of leading far enough in the count to obtain a majority of over 50%, and that a run-off vote would not be needed.&lt;ref name=twoclaim/&gt;&lt;ref name=knockout/&gt;

Three days into the vote counting, reports suggested that Hamid Karzai had been re-elected by a landslide, with early figures giving Karzai 72% of the vote and his closest rival, Abdullah Abdullah, at 23%.&lt;ref name=landslide&gt;{{Cite news|last=Farmer |first=Ben |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/afghanistan/6077203/Hamid-Karzai-re-elected-by-landslide-poll-data-shows.html |title=Hamid Karzai 're-elected' by landslide, poll data shows |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK |date=2009-08-23 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If confirmed, the scale of the win is expected to provoke accusations of [[vote-rigging]], with the Electoral Complaints Commission (ECC) having already received 225 complaints within three days – some containing multiple allegations – and reports still arriving from remote areas.&lt;ref name=landslide/&gt;&lt;ref name=more&gt;[https://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20090823/wl_afp/afghanistanvotecomplaints More than 200 claims of irregularities in Afghan vote] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090916152851/http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20090823/wl_afp/afghanistanvotecomplaints |date=September 16, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thirty-five of the complaints received so far were deemed by the ECC to have been on a scale large enough to have altered the outcome of the poll, with the most common complaint among them being [[ballot box]] tampering. Other charges included [[#Armed coercion|intimidation of voters]], failures of the "indelible ink", and [[#Systemic conflicts of interest|interference in polling]].&lt;ref name=landslide/&gt;&lt;ref name=more/&gt;

Abdullah Abdullah accused Hamid Karzai of "stealing" the election and alleged that widespread [[electoral fraud]] had been committed. He told [[The Guardian]]: "It was led by Mr Karzai. He knew. He knew that without this he cannot win, about that I have no doubt in my mind."&lt;ref name=clouds/&gt;

A senior UN official said that there would be no legitimacy if Karzai was proclaimed the outright winner in the election that Afghanistan's international backers are desperate should be seen as legitimate: "If the international community say it is all wonderful, they lose further credibility and are associated with an illegitimate government."&lt;ref name=clouds/&gt;

By August 25, the ECC said it had received 1,157 complaints, with 54 categorized as "high priority" and material to the outcome, and many more still expected. Some of the worst fraud may have occurred in [[Helmand province]], according to allegations from at least two presidential candidates. A spokesman for Ashraf Ghani alleged large-scale ballot box stuffing in [[Lashkar Gah]], the capital of the province. An aide to Dr. Abdullah accused election officials in Helmand of having doubled the real turnout figure – a claim that found some anectdotal support in changing figures given by the top local Independent Election Commission official in Helmand, who told [[The Times]] on the day of the election that fewer than 50,000 people had voted in the province, then changed the number to 110,000, and then to 150,000 in subsequent days.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article6808566.ece "Hamid Karzai expected to gain first-round victory in Afghanistan election"], ''The Times'' (UK)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=leads/&gt;&lt;ref name=tlead/&gt;

A UN official predicted that anywhere between 10% and 20%, or as many as one in five, of all the ballots were illegal, and even proposed that negotiations would have to be made to "''massage'' down" Karzai's victory margin.&lt;ref name=UNwarns&gt;{{Cite news|author=Jon Boone |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/aug/24/afghan-elections-fraud-karzai |title=One in five Afghan ballots may be illegal, UN warns |work=Guardian |location=UK |date= 2009-08-24|accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The deputy speaker of Afghanistan's lower house of parliament, [[Mirwais Yasini]], claimed that thousands of ballots cast for him had been removed from ballot boxes by his opponents and taken away to be destroyed instead of counted. He displayed bags full of ballots from Kandahar that had been discovered by his supporters. Yasini said the only option available was to "abolish the election".&lt;ref name=clouds/&gt;&lt;ref name=UNwarns/&gt;

Abdullah Abdullah also brought forth evidence to support his allegations of widespread vote-rigging. He showed sealed ballot forms that he similarly claimed were votes for him that were never counted; a vote ledger sheet from a polling station that listed only a few names, yet had a ballot tally on the bottom of 1,600; video showing ballot-stuffing that he said was recorded on August 22 – two days after the polls had closed on August 20 and ballot boxes were supposed to have been sealed; video of an individual directing voters to cast their ballot for Karzai; a photograph allegedly showing Karzai people looking over the shoulders of voters filling their ballot sheets behind the cardboard voting screens; a thick tablet of ballot sheets still affixed to the pad, with every single ballot apparently pre-marked for Karzai with the same pen and by what seemed to be the same hand. Abdullah said the tablet had been turned over to them in southern Afghanistan and was just one of hundreds. He said: "This amount of fraud ... Even I did not anticipate it. I was shocked."&lt;ref name=mock/&gt;

More than 10 boxes of ballots were lost when a [[U.S. Air Force]] Chinook helicopter accidentally dropped and lost the ballot boxes collected from a remote village.&lt;ref name=newopt/&gt;

====August 26 partial results====
On August 26, the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) reported partial results tallied from 10% of the polling stations, and announced that it planned to release partial results each day for the next several days.&lt;ref name=leads&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2009/08/25/afghanistan-election-results025.html | work=CBC News | title=Karzai leads in early Afghan election results | date=2009-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tlead&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=aNGkj52.ha98 |title=Karzai Takes Lead in Afghan Vote as Count Shows Lower Turnout |publisher=Bloomberg  |date=2009-08-25 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By one account, Hamid Karzai was leading slightly with 41% of the counted votes, while Abdullah Abdullah was at 39%, based on 524,000 valid votes counted after 31,000 – or 5.6% – of the votes were thrown out.&lt;ref name=leads/&gt;

By another account, covering the same news, IEC Chief Electoral Officer Daoud Ali Najafi announced in a news conference that Karzai was at 38% while Abdullah was at 36%, based on 550,000 votes.&lt;ref name=tlead/&gt;

According to the BBC, the partial results were as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8221709.stm|title=BBC August 26 partial results |accessdate=2009-08-26 |publisher=BBC News   |date=2009-08-26| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090826100508/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8221709.stm| archivedate=August 26, 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Hamid Karzai]] – 212,927 votes, 40.6%
*[[Abdullah Abdullah]] – 202,889 votes, 38.7%
*[[Ramazan Bashardost]] – 53,740 votes, 10.2%
*[[Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai]] – 15,143 votes, 2.9%

Those partial figures of 550,000 votes from 10% of the polling stations, when extrapolated, could suggest a national turnout of 5.5 million, which would be about 30% lower than the turnout figures from the previous presidential election in 2004. The tally was based mainly on returns in the north and other parts of the country – the commission said that less than 2% of the ballots in [[Kandahar province]] and none of the ballots from [[Helmand province]] had been tallied.&lt;ref name=mock/&gt;&lt;ref name=leads/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/ec21cdfc-91d8-11de-879d-00144feabdc0.html |title=Early poll results put Afghanistan on course for more political limbo |website=Financial Times  |date=2009-08-26 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====August 27 partial results====
A second release of partial results was made by the election authorities after 17%, or 940,000, of the ballots were counted.

According to the BBC:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8221709.stm|title=Karzai widens lead in Afghan poll |accessdate=2009-08-26 |publisher=BBC News   |date=2009-08-26| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090826100508/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8221709.stm| archivedate=August 26, 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Hamid Karzai]] – 422,000 votes, 45%
*[[Abdullah Abdullah]] – 330,000 votes, 35%
*[[Ramazan Bashardost]] – 108,000 votes, 10.8%
*[[Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai]] – 28,000 votes, 2.8%

The figures have also been reported as Karzai having 44.8% and Abdullah 35.1% of the ballots based on 17% of the country's polling stations (as opposed to 17% of the ballots).&lt;ref name=widens/&gt;

Again, slightly different figures were reported in other accounts,&lt;ref name=tally/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Farmer |first=Ben |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/afghanistan/6096661/Afghanistan-election-Hamid-Karzai-widens-lead-over-Abdullah-Abdullah.html |title=Afghanistan election: Hamid Karzai widens lead over Abdullah Abdullah |publisher=Telegraph |date=2009-08-27 |accessdate=2010-04-07|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; covering the same news, in which IEC Chief Electoral Officer Daoud Ali Najafi told reporters in Kabul that Karzai had 42% and Abdullah 33% of 998,000 ballots counted from 17% of the polling stations in the country.&lt;ref name=Abdullah/&gt;&lt;ref name=tally&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601091&amp;sid=aduGynxzrM9A |title=Karzai Widens Lead in Afghanistan's Presidential Vote Tally |publisher=Bloomberg  |date=2009-08-26 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

998,000 ballots from 17% of the polling stations suggests a nationwide turnout of nearly 5.9 million.&lt;ref name=tally/&gt; 940,000 ballots representing 17% of the ballots would suggest a turnout of 5.5 million out of 15-17 million voters registered. The presidential election of 2004 had produced a tally of approximately 8 million ballots out of 11 million voters registered.&lt;ref name=mock/&gt;&lt;ref name=tally/&gt;

[[Ramazan Bashardost]], the candidate likely to place third in the election, said the Independent Election Commission (IEC) officials were breaking electoral law by announcing results before the Electoral Complaints Commission (ECC) had completed its work. The complaints commission had by now received more than 1,400 complaints, with over 150 of them serious enough to change the vote's outcome.&lt;ref name=widens /&gt;

====August 29 partial results====
Partial results released on August 29, with 2.03 million ballots tallied from 35% of polling stations, gave the following numbers:&lt;ref name=pulls&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/asia/2009/08/2009829131256991701.html |title=Karzai pulls ahead in Afghan polls |publisher=English.aljazeera.net |date=2009-08-29 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=closer&gt;{{Cite web|last=Ahmad |first=Sardar |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5ia7TYzMUofdg_H_agOnIg0BtVs8w |title=Karzai closer to winning tainted Afghan vote |date=2009-08-29 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author= AFP |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hUdUP7tnusuEznxrjIAkzWoZjAxQ |title=Karzai widens lead in Afghan election race |date=2009-08-29 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Hamid Karzai]] – 940,558 votes, 46.3%
*[[Abdullah Abdullah]] – 638,924 votes, 31.4%
*[[Ramazan Bashardost]] – 277,404 votes, 13.6%
*[[Ashraf Ghani]] – 47,375 votes, 2.3%

Claims of massive fraud escalated with a total of more than 2,000 now received by the Electoral Complaints Commission, 270 of which it considered serious enough to have changed the outcome.&lt;ref name=seven/&gt;&lt;ref name=closer/&gt;

Abdullah Abdullah stepped up his allegations of widespread [[vote rigging]], saying that "massive fraud, state-crafted, state-engineered fraud" had taken place throughout the country," and that ballot boxes had been stuffed with hundreds of thousands of votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8228443.stm |title=Afghan's Karzai extends poll lead |publisher=BBC News   |date=2009-08-29 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 25, supporters of Abdullah threatened with violence if their candidate would lose, while Abdullah himself urged them to stay calm while the electoral commission would investigate their concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/abdullahs-supporters-threaten-to-take-up-arms-over-rigged-election-1776783.html |title=Abdullah's supporters threaten to take up arms over 'rigged' election - In northern Afghanistan, where opposition to Hamid Karzai is strong, the mood is darkening |work=The Independent |location=UK |date= 2009-08-25|accessdate=2010-04-07|first=Kim|last=Sengupta}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 30, the Electoral Complaints Commission announced that the number of allegations it considered serious enough to have affected the outcome had now reach 567, more than double the number announced the day before. The total number of complaints registered with the ECC had now reached 2,493, with over one-fifth classified as "Category A", meaning serious enough to alter the outcome. Most votes in the southern parts of the country, where Karzai is seen as having strong ethnic Pashtun support, and where complaints of fraud seemed highest, had yet to be counted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Peter Graff |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUSTRE57T0ET20090830 |title=Serious fraud complaints double in Afghan vote |agency=Reuters  |date=2009-08-30 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====August 31 partial results====
Partial results released on August 31, with 2,869,562 valid ballots tallied from 47.8% of polling stations, gave the following numbers:&lt;ref name=lead2&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.france24.com/en/20090831-president-karzai-lead-narrows-slightly-presidential-vote-afghanistan-election- |title=Karzai lead narrows slightly in presidential vote |publisher=France24.com |date=2009-08-31 |accessdate=2010-04-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090904174544/http://www.france24.com/en/20090831-president-karzai-lead-narrows-slightly-presidential-vote-afghanistan-election- |archivedate=September 4, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=IEC - Presidential &amp; Provincial Council Elections - Afghanistan 2009 Elections |url=http://www.iec.org.af/results/leadingCandidate.html |date=2009-08-31 |accessdate=2009-08-31 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090902162405/http://www.iec.org.af/results/leadingCandidate.html |archivedate=September 2, 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Hamid Karzai]] – 1,317,121 votes, 45.9%
*[[Abdullah Abdullah]] – 954,256 votes, 33.3%
*[[Ramazan Bashardost]] – 359,214 votes, 12.5%
*[[Ashraf Ghani]] – 62,536 votes, 2.2%

The results with nearly half of the polling stations counted pointed to a turnout of only 30% to 35%, adding to doubts about the election's legitimacy. Most of the ballots counted so far had been from polling stations in the north of Afghanistan, where most of Abdullah's support was. Observers said that the ballots from the south that mostly remained to be counted could put Karzai over the 50% needed to win the election without a run-off.&lt;ref name=latest/&gt;

===September, massive fraud alleged, sample-based audit===
According to a senior Western diplomat, hundreds of thousands of ballots for Hamid Karzai were from as many as 800 fake polling sites where no one had actually voted. The diplomat and another Western official also said that Karzai supporters took over approximately 800 actual polling centers on election day and used them to fraudulently report tens of thousands of ballots for Karzai. The Western diplomat said: "''This was fraud en masse''." In Karzai's home province, [[Kandahar province|Kandahar]], preliminary results indicated that more than 350,000 ballots had been turned in to be counted, but Western officials estimated that only about 25,000 people had actually voted in the whole province.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/07/world/asia/07fraud.html?hpw=&amp;pagewanted=all "Fake Afghan Poll Sites Favored Karzai, Officials Assert"], ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt;

According to an IEC official and a Western official in Afghanistan, the Independent Election Commission introduced a set of standards to exclude questionable votes on August 29, but when it appeared that the new exclusions would put Karzai's tally below 50%, the commission cast a second vote on September 7 to loosen the fraud standards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miamiherald.com/news/world/AP/v-fullstory/story/1233579.html Karzai rival warns: Vote fraud would doom U.S. involvement] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 8, 2009, the Electoral Complaints Commission (ECC), dominated by U.N.-appointed Westerners, reported that over 720 major fraud allegations considered material to the outcome had been registered, and ordered recounts at polling stations where it had found "clear and convincing evidence of fraud" in at least three provinces. The U.N.-appointed ECC chairman, Grant Kippen, said voting irregularities included unfolded ballots (that would not have fit through a ballot box slot), identically marked ballots, and overly large ballot counts, including a box in Kandahar with 1,700 ballots when the maximum should be 600. Dozens of voting sites tallied by the Independent Election Commission reportedly had Karzai winning in perfectly round numbers like 200, 300, or 500 ballots.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gH6zTk0ZvJGljIu7bpEh3P2uECEwD9AJCPMG0 Afghan recount ordered because of fraud charges] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also on September 8, 2009, with the IEC releasing the first partial results to show Hamid Karzai above the 50% threshold, the U.S. [[State Department]] called for a "rigorous vetting" of the [[electoral fraud]] claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2009/09/us-calls-for-rigorous-vetting-of-afghan-election-fraud-allegations.html |title=U.S. Calls For 'Rigorous Vetting' of Afghan Election Fraud Allegations |publisher=Blogs.abcnews.com |date=2009-09-08 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 10, 2009, the ECC ordered the invalidation of tens of thousands of ballots, mostly votes for Karzai, from 83 polling stations from three provinces. These included all presidential ballots from 5 polling stations in [[Paktika Province]], either all presidential ballots, all provincial council ballots - or in some case both - from 27 polling stations in [[Ghazni Province]], as well as ballots from 51 polling stations in [[Kandahar Province]]. The chairman of the ECC, Grant Kippen, said there would be no re-voting and that the ballots would simply discounted from the final tally. A source at the ECC indicated this was just the beginning of a process, according to a BBC correspondent.&lt;ref name=invalid/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8248543.stm |title=Afghan fraud ballots invalidated |publisher=BBC News   |date=2009-09-10 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=probed&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0911/afghanistan.html |title=Up to 500,000 Afghan votes may be probed |publisher=Rte.ie |date=2009-09-11 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Independent Election Commission indicated that results from 447 polling stations, or 200,000 ballots, had already been quarantined and flagged to the ECC for investigation, and that the figure could rise to 660 polling stations and as many as 500,000 ballots.&lt;ref name=probed/&gt;

On September 15, 2009, the foreign-dominated ECC ordered a recount of 2,600, or 10%, of the country's 26,000 polling stations – many of them in southern Afghanistan – a move expected to strip votes away from incumbent President Hamid Karzai. Because many of those polling stations had substantially higher turnouts than average, possibly the result of ballot stuffing, more than 10% of the vote could be affected. With the September 12 partial results showing Karzai at 54.3% of the votes, just 4.3 points above the 50% threshold, the ECC-ordered recount could potentially force a run-off election.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.mcclatchydc.com/homepage/story/75478.html |title=U.N. panel orders recounts of 1 in 10 Afghan polling stations |publisher=Mcclatchydc.com |accessdate=2010-04-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090930130147/http://www.mcclatchydc.com/homepage/story/75478.html |archivedate=September 30, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 21, 2009, over a month after the election day, and after several weeks of wrangling, it was reported that the IEC and ECC had agreed to rely on [[statistical sampling]] in the interests of expediency instead of carrying out an in-depth investigation of all the alleged voting irregularities.&lt;ref name=sample&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-afghan-recount22-2009sep22,0,250820.story |title=Afghanistan election review will be based on sample |work=Los Angeles Times  |date=2009-09-22 |accessdate=2010-04-07 | first=Mark | last=Magnier}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exact methodology to be used had yet to be agreed upon and could take a few days.&lt;ref name=sample/&gt;

Supporters of the deal claimed that streamlining the complaints review process would reduce political instability. Critics of the deal said that bypassing a full investigation of all the irregularities would undermine faith in the credibility of the outcome.&lt;ref name=sample/&gt;

On September 25, 2009, the IEC and ECC announced that they had agreed to audit and recount ballots from only 313 of the 3,063 polling stations that had been deemed suspicious, representing a sample of about 10% of suspect ballot boxes, in order to expedite a resolution to the disputed election. According to the election officials, the 313 ballot boxes to be used in the statistical sampling were randomly selected in front of candidate agents and observers, and were to be retrieved from the provinces as soon as the next day.&lt;ref name=recount&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=111510450 1 in 10 suspect Afghan ballot boxes face recount] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 26, 2009, Afghan newspaper "daily 8 Subh" quoted the IEC chief electoral officer as saying that a decision about whether a run-off would occur would be made within the next ten days, and that any run-off would be held within a month.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://english.people.com.cn/90001/90777/90851/6768445.html |title=IEC: Final results of Afghan presidential election to be announced soon |publisher=English.people.com.cn |date=2009-09-26 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, other news sources reported the IEC as urging the Electoral Complaints Commission to expedite their fraud investigations, saying that the final results must be released within the next ten days if the election commission is to be able to prepare a second round of voting before winter snow at the end of October makes voting impossible in parts of the country.

Partial results released by the Independent Election Commission on September 2, with 3,689,715 valid ballots tallied from 60.3% of polling stations, gave the following numbers:&lt;ref name=attack&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hvWEqwq3CrRvaQCmt21MfoYhjZJQD9AFF65O0 Afghan spy boss killed in Taliban suicide attack] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090907170420/https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hvWEqwq3CrRvaQCmt21MfoYhjZJQD9AFF65O0 |date=September 7, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IEC&gt;{{Cite web|title=IEC - Presidential &amp; Provincial Council Elections - Afghanistan 2009 Elections |url=http://www.iec.org.af/results/leadingCandidate.html |date=2009-09-02 |accessdate=2009-09-02 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090902162405/http://www.iec.org.af/results/leadingCandidate.html |archivedate=September 2, 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Hamid Karzai]] – 1,744,428 votes, 47.3%
*[[Abdullah Abdullah]] – 1,201,838 votes, 32.6%
*[[Ramazan Bashardost]] – 426,331 votes, 11.6%
*[[Ashraf Ghani]] – 88,835 votes, 2.4%

Abdullah reiterated his allegations of massive fraud, and accused the Independent Election Commission of cooperating in "organized fraud". One of his campaign chiefs, Zalmai Younosi, said: "''How can we accept a corrupt government funded by drugs and not respected by the world?''"&lt;ref name=attack/&gt;

The Electoral Complaints Commission reported that it had hired 70 extra people and would need at the very least two weeks, working overtime, in order to process the more than 2,600 reports of fraud, with over 650 of them large enough to "have material effect on the results".&lt;ref name=attack/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=ahwgbckQtPtY |title=Karzai Leads Afghan Vote as Panel Probes Election Fraud Reports |publisher=Bloomberg  |date=2009-09-02 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=complaints&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601085&amp;sid=aNDTre.7Sbfk |title=Afghan Election Results Delayed Amid Probe of Fraud Complaints |publisher=Bloomberg  |date=2009-09-03 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 3, 2009, when official preliminary results were originally planned to have been released, the IEC said the earliest possible date was now delayed to September 7.&lt;ref name=complaints/&gt;

====September 6 partial results====
Results released on September 6, 2009, with ballots from 74.2% of polling stations tallied, gave the following count:&lt;ref name=win&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8240534.stm |title=Karzai closer to Afghan poll win |publisher=BBC News   |date=2009-09-06 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Abdullah Abdullah]] – 1,361,247 votes, 31.7%
*[[Ramazan Bashardost]] – 457,909 votes, 10.7%

Independent Election Commission officials said results from 447 of about 28,000 polling stations had been annulled after fraud investigations.&lt;ref name=win/&gt;&lt;ref name=lead&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8244215.stm |title=Recount clouds Karzai poll lead |publisher=BBC News   |date=2009-09-08 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====September 8 partial results====
Partial results released by the Independent Election Commission on September 8, with 5,469,289 valid ballots tallied from 91.6% of polling stations, showed Hamid Karzai over the 50% vote threshold needed win the election without a run-off:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=IEC - Presidential &amp; Provincial Council Elections - Afghanistan 2009 Elections |url=http://www.iec.org.af/results/leadingCandidate.html |date=2009-09-08 |accessdate=2009-09-08 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090902162405/http://www.iec.org.af/results/leadingCandidate.html |archivedate=September 2, 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Ramazan Bashardost]] – 505,347 votes, 9.2%
*[[Ashraf Ghani]] – 147,761–2.7%

The Independent Election Commission (IEC) also reported that it had "quarantined" results from 600 polling stations where it suspected irregularities, and sent the list of stations to the ECC.&lt;ref name=lead/&gt;

Meanwhile, the U.N.-backed Electoral Complaints Commission (ECC) said it had found "clear and convincing evidence of fraud", and that a recount and inspection should be done for any polling station where 600 or more ballots were cast, or where any single candidate received more than 95% of the votes. U.N.-appointed ECC chairman Grant Kippen said how many polling stations this would involve was unknown. The chief electoral officer of the IEC said it could take two to three months to comply with the ECC's recount and audit order.&lt;ref name=lead/&gt;

With Karzai passing the 50 per cent threshold but confrontated with allegations of massive fraud, a crisis emerged when a recount of ballots was ordered. That demand was challenged by the Afghan-dominated Independent Election Commission (IEC), which went on to publish the results, effectively giving Karzai the victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/karzai-victory-provokes-fresh-crisis-between-kabul-and-west-1783873.html |title=Karzai 'victory' provokes fresh crisis between Kabul and West - Asia, World |work=The Independent |location=UK |date= 2009-09-09|accessdate=2010-04-08|first=Kim|last=Sengupta| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100316232451/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/karzai-victory-provokes-fresh-crisis-between-kabul-and-west-1783873.html| archivedate=March 16, 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====September 12 partial results====
The IEC had previously announced that it hoped to release full preliminary results, originally scheduled for September 3, on September 12, 2009, instead. On that date, however, they announced that the count was still not complete and that there would be another delay, with no date known.&lt;ref name=vict&gt;{{Cite web|last=Massoud |first=Waheedullah |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jJNHOkmXeTNoKkoP9HVKo0Ttarng |title=Afghan leader Karzai nears election victory |date=2009-09-12 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The partial results released by the IEC on September 12, tallied from the ballots of 92.8% of polling stations, showed Karzai slightly further in the lead and Abdullah slightly further lagging:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=IEC - Presidential &amp; Provincial Council Elections - Afghanistan 2009 Elections |url=http://www.iec.org.af/results/leadingCandidate.html |date=2009-09-12 |accessdate=2009-09-13 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090902162405/http://www.iec.org.af/results/leadingCandidate.html |archivedate=September 2, 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Ramazan Bashardost]] – 511,441 votes, 9.2%
*[[Ashraf Ghani]] – 149,720–2.7%

Ballots from an additional 2.15% of polling stations were set aside because of irregularities at the 600 stations and excluded from the IEC's latest results on orders from the ECC. The IEC reported that hundreds of thousands of ballots had now been quarantined for audit.&lt;ref name=dozens/&gt;&lt;ref name=vict/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8252394.stm |title=Afghan leader closer to victory |publisher=BBC News   |date=2009-09-12 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Election officials were unwilling to provide a time-scale for the final result, while observers said that investigation of the extensive fraud allegations could take months.&lt;ref name=vict/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=McDonald |first=Charlotte |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gwx3I6OTH7SspVL3_maiPw5cQEWg |title=Afghanistan awaits results from fraud-tainted poll |date=2009-09-12 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The day was accompanied by a spate of violence in which at least 66 people were killed in gunbattles, suicide strikes, and roadside bombs. The dead included 24 civilians, 5 foreign soldiers, 7 Afghan soldiers, 12 Afghan policemen, 7 security firm guards, and at least 11 militants. Attacks occurred in all corners of the country – not only in the south and east, but also in the west and north that had been comparatively quiet until recent weeks around the election – signalling an expanding insurgency despite record numbers of U.S. and coalition troops in the eight-year war since the 2001 U.S. invasion.&lt;ref name=engulf/&gt;&lt;ref name=dozens/&gt;&lt;ref name=spate/&gt;

====September 16 uncertified final result====
On September 16, 2009, the IEC released its final uncertified results for the presidential election, with Hamid Karzai winning the election in one round with 54.6% of the vote:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=IEC - Presidential &amp; Provincial Council Elections - Afghanistan 2009 Elections - Final uncertified results released September 16, 2009 2PM |url=http://www.iec.org.af/results/leadingCandidate.html |date=2009-09-16 |accessdate=2009-09-16 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090902162405/http://www.iec.org.af/results/leadingCandidate.html |archivedate=September 2, 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:2009 Afghan election map.png|300px|thumb|Provinces where Hamid Karzai won a majority (in blue), provinces were Abdullah Abdullah won a majority (in red)]]
*[[Hamid Karzai]] – 3,093,256 votes, '''54.6%'''
*[[Abdullah Abdullah]] – 1,571,581 votes, 27.8%
*[[Ramazan Bashardost]] – 520,627 votes, 9.2%
*[[Ashraf Ghani]] – 155,343–2.7%

Total Valid Votes: 5,662,758.

The IEC claimed that voter turnout was 38.7%. However, anectdotal evidence from observers suggests it was much lower.&lt;ref name=EU&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/Afghanistan/article6837654.ece "President Karzai claims victory as EU demands inquiry into vote fraud"], ''The Times'' (UK)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=secures/&gt;&lt;ref name=fraudulent/&gt;

The results were not final until approved by the UN-dominated Electoral Complaints Commission (ECC) which had already previously called for recounts at about 10% of polling stations, a process which could take months.&lt;ref name=give55&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2009/09/16/afghan-election016.html |title=Afghan election results give Karzai 55% of vote |publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]  |date=2009-09-16 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More than 2,800 complaints were registered with the ECC, including complaints involving polling day and the ballot counting process, with 726 allegations that the ECC categorized as serious enough to have affected the outcome.&lt;ref name=give55/&gt;

The EU deputy chief observer, Dimitra Ioannou, alleged that 1.5 million ballots were suspect out of the 5.5 million ballots, representing 27% of the vote. According to Ioannou, 1.1 million of the votes for Karzai were suspect, along with 300,000 of the votes for Abdullah, and 92,000 of the votes for Bashardost. The EU deputy chief observer noted that if all the votes they deemed suspect were invalidated, Karzai's percentage would drop from 54.6% to 46%, while Abdullah's would rise from 27.7% to 31%, effectively forcing a run-off. The Karzai campaign denounced the announcement as "partial, irresponsible and in contradiction with Afghanistan's constitution."&lt;ref name=give55/&gt;&lt;ref name=morethan1&gt;{{Cite news|last=Farmer |first=Ben |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/afghanistan/6199070/More-than-1m-Hamid-Karzai-votes-suspicious-says-EU.html |title=More than 1m Hamid Karzai votes 'suspicious', says EU |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK |date=2009-09-16 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The European Union election observer mission had previously declared the election process to be generally "good and fair", shortly after voting day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Farmer |first=Ben |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/afghanistan/6081952/Abdullah-Abdullah-under-pressure-to-concede-to-Hamid-Karzai-in-Afghanistan.html |title=Abdullah Abdullah under pressure to concede to Hamid Karzai in Afghanistan |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK |date=2009-08-24 |accessdate=2010-04-07| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100501203139/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/afghanistan/6081952/Abdullah-Abdullah-under-pressure-to-concede-to-Hamid-Karzai-in-Afghanistan.html| archivedate=May 1, 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/irregularities-continue-to-pile-up-in-afghan-vote/article1263106/ |title=Irregularities continue to pile up in Afghan vote |work=The Globe and Mail|accessdate=2010-04-07 |location=Toronto, Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The figures alleged by the EU deputy chief observer represented approximately 36%, 19%, and 18% of the votes counted for Karzai, Abdullah, and Bashardost, respectively. Invalidating the 1.5 million ballots would reduce the already low voter turnout figure to under 27%.

===October, ruling of the ECC awaited, run-off possibility===
The time frames mentioned at the end of [[#September, massive fraud alleged, sample-based audit|September]] for a decision about a run-off did not appear to hold however: The recount of the random sample of 10% of suspect ballot boxes finally only began nine days later, on October 5, 2009. The UN stated that this recount process would take at least four days and that a final result would come next week.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8291713.stm |title=Afghan election recount under way Afghan election recount under way |publisher=BBC News   |date=2009-10-05 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 11, 2009, the recount of the 10% sample of suspect ballot boxes was reported to be completed, with results to be announced within a few days. The head of the [[United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan|United Nations mission in Afghanistan]], [[Kai Eide]], stated that [[vote fraud]] in the Afghan election had been "''widespread''". He refused to reveal any numbers however, saying "any specific figures would be speculative".&lt;ref name=widespread&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2009/10/11/afghan-vote-fraud.html |title=Afghan vote fraud 'widespread': UN official |publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]  |date=2009-10-11 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,4782409,00.html?maca=en-en_nr-1893-xml-atom |title=Afghan elections hit yet another snag |publisher=Dw-world.de |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 12, 2009, just days before results of the audit were expected to be announced, the chairman of the Electoral Complaints Commission (ECC), Canadian Grant Kippen, told reporters that the ECC had misinterpreted the statistical analysis to determine the percentage of votes that would be voided for each candidate in ballot boxes deemed suspect. The week before, the ECC had stated that each candidate would lose votes in proportion to the number of fraudulent ballots cast for them in a random sampling of ballots boxes deemed suspect. Under the new ECC interpretation, the commission divides suspect ballot stations into six categories of reason for suspicion, and disqualifies the same percentage from each candidate's total ballots within each category. According to an Associated Press article: "''That means votes legitimately cast for a candidate could be canceled if they were found in ballot boxes that were deemed to have been stuffed in favor of another contender.''"&lt;ref name=beset&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hvWEqwq3CrRvaQCmt21MfoYhjZJQD9B9MQN00 Problems beset Afghan vote recount] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=watchdog&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/asiaCrisis/idUSSP510247 |title=Watchdog alters Afghan recount rules, member quits |agency=Reuters  |date=2009-10-12 |accessdate=2010-04-07 | first=Peter | last=Graff}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ecc.org.af/en/images/stories/pdf/ECC%202009%20Understanding%20the%20process%20of%20ECC%20policy%20implementation%2020091011_ENG.pdf |title=October 11, 2009, ECC policy guideline factsheet |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-04-07 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the same day, in a blow for the UN-backed complaints body's credibility, one of the two Afghan members of the five-member ECC resigned, stating "foreign interference" on the part of the three Western members – an American, a Canadian, and a Dutch – of the complaints body.&lt;ref name=beset/&gt;&lt;ref name=watchdog/&gt;

====Waiting game and Western political pressure====
On October 17, 2009, the U.N.-backed Electoral Complaints Commission, which had widely been expected to release its findings from its statistics-based audit, delayed the announcement again as ECC officials spent the day in meetings with Afghan election officials and double-checking calculations – and as U.S. and other Western officials pressured Karzai and Abdullah to state their acceptance of the findings before the ECC announcement and to work out [[#U.S. efforts to force a power-sharing deal|a power-sharing deal]].&lt;ref name=underpressure&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hvWEqwq3CrRvaQCmt21MfoYhjZJQD9BD1VK01 Afghan president under pressure over fraud rulings] [https://www.webcitation.org/5kbFnlxFk?url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hvWEqwq3CrRvaQCmt21MfoYhjZJQD9BD1VK01 Archived copy] at [[WebCite]] (October 17, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=allies&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/18/world/asia/18afghan.html Allies Press Karzai to Accept Election Audit Results"], ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''The New York Times'', Karzai fielded a flurry of visits and phone calls from U.S. and other Western officials pressing him to accept the delayed U.N.-led audit results, enter into a power-sharing deal with Abdullah, or otherwise avert a crisis in the contended election. Among the American officials working the phones were Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]], her Special Representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan [[Richard C. Holbrooke]], and Defense Secretary [[Robert M. Gates]]. In Afghanistan, U.S. Senator [[John Kerry]], chairman of the [[United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations]], met with Karzai at least twice, and Abdullah once, stressing "''the necessity of a legitimate outcome'',"&lt;ref name=allies/&gt;

British Prime Minister [[Gordon Brown]] and U.N. Secretary-General [[Ban Ki-moon]] also called Karzai and Abdullah. French foreign minister [[Bernard Kouchner]], who had flown to Afghanistan "in the context of tension" caused by the election crisis, pressured both Karzai and Abdullah to "respect" the U.N.-backed audit process.&lt;ref name=underpressure/&gt;&lt;ref name=allies/&gt;

Along with U.S. Senator [[John Kerry]] and French Foreign Minister [[Bernard Kouchner]], former U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan, [[Zalmay Khalilzad]] was also in Kabul that day for talks with Afghan leaders.&lt;ref name=underpressure/&gt;&lt;ref name=allies/&gt;

The spokesman for Karzai's campaign, [[Wahid Omar]], said they were concerned that the process was "being overshadowed by political discussions." Karzai's spokesman stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"''We will not be committed to a result that is decided on politically.''"&lt;ref name=allies/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ECC's ruling was now expected October 18, according to ''The New York Times''.&lt;ref name=allies/&gt;

On October 18, 2009, however, the BBC reported that the ECC results from the fraud investigation were now due "in the next few days". The Telegraph [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/afghanistan/6367822/Afghan-leaders-under-pressure-to-avoid-election-run-off.html reported] that the ECC investigation was "understood" to have knocked Karzai's vote percentage down to between 47% and 49%, but that the official result "''was delayed as the West asked the men to reach an agreement that would avoid another round of voting.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8313423.stm|work=BBC News  |title=US decision after Afghan result|date=2009-10-19|accessdate=2010-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=underpressure2&gt;{{Cite news|last=Farmer |first=Ben |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/afghanistan/6367822/Afghan-leaders-under-pressure-to-avoid-election-run-off.html |title=underpressure2 |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK |date=2009-10-18 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

White House Chief of Staff [[Rahm Emanuel]] indicated in veiled criticism of Hamid Karzai that it would be 'reckless' for the U.S. to commit more troops to Afghanistan until there is a 'true partner' to work with in Kabul. An expert familiar with the U.S. administration's thinking said there was no stomach for an election run-off after the "organisational headaches and risks to American troops" experienced in the August 20 ballot, and stated: "''There is a clear preference for a deal.''"&lt;ref name=underpressure2/&gt;

====ECC fraud investigation findings reported to IEC====
On October 19, 2009, ''The New York Times'' [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/20/world/asia/20afghan.html reported] that the ECC submitted its findings to the IEC that day, leaving the official announcement of results to the Independent Election Committee. However, an unnamed Western official said that the ECC investigation gave Karzai only 48% of the vote, under the 50% threshold required to avoid a run-off. The sample-based audit was reported to have found levels of fraud ranging from 71% to 96% in the six categories into which suspect ballot boxes had been divided.&lt;ref name=has48&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/20/world/asia/20afghan.html "Election Audit Said to Show Karzai Has 48 Percent"], ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt;

Karzai campaign spokesman [[Wahid Omar]] stated: "''I don't think we can make any judgment based on the figures announced today''."&lt;ref name=panel&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hvWEqwq3CrRvaQCmt21MfoYhjZJQD9BE6ROG0 Afghan fraud panel voids thousands of Karzai votes] [https://www.webcitation.org/5ke2nQ6nt?url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hvWEqwq3CrRvaQCmt21MfoYhjZJQD9BE6ROG0 Archived copy] at [[WebCite]] (October 19, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

In a follow-up article the same day, ''The New York Times'' [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/20/world/asia/20afghan.html?hp reported] that based on its own analysis using preliminary data from the ECC findings, 874,000, or 28%, of Karzai's 3,093,000 votes were ordered invalidated by the sample-based fraud audit, as were 185,000, or 18%, of Abdullah's votes. The ECC also completely discarded 210 ballot boxes because of fraud, reducing Karzai's total by 41,000 votes and Abdullah's by 10,807 votes. The ECC findings resulted in pushing Karzai's final vote total from 54% down to around 48–49%, and raising Abdullah's vote total from 28% up to 31%.&lt;ref name=audit&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/20/world/asia/20afghan.html?hp "Audit Pushes Karzai Below 50 Percent in Afghan Vote"], ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ecc.org.af/en/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=50&amp;Itemid=56 |title=October 18, 2009, ECC Decision |publisher=Ecc.org.af |accessdate=2010-04-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091024013329/http://www.ecc.org.af/en/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=50&amp;Itemid=56 |archivedate=October 24, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to an [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/Afghanistan/article6881718.ece article] by [[The Times]], overall, "''some 1.26 million recorded votes were excluded from an election that cost the international community more than $300 million.''"

Concerns that Karzai might reject the ECC findings in direct conflict with his main backer for eight years, the United States, led to continued intense American and ally pressure on him [[#U.S. efforts to force a power-sharing deal|to accept a power-sharing deal]] or face a second round [[#U.S. efforts to force a run-off|run-off]]. Senator [[John Kerry]] made an unplanned stop in Kabul to meet Karzai in the presidential palace "to continue his discussions and consultations", according to the U.S. embassy. White House spokesperson Robert Gibbs said former U.S. army general [[Karl Eikenberry]], the U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan, was engaged in "delicate but extremely important" efforts to persuade Karzai to accept the ECC's findings.&lt;ref name=audit/&gt;&lt;ref name=ruleout/&gt;

U.S. Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]], who said that she had spoken a number of times with Karzai in recent days, announced that Karzai would be making an announcement the next day, saying "''He is going to announce his intentions ... But I don't want to pre-empt in any way President Karzai's statement, which will set the stage for how we go forward in the next stage of this.''" An unnamed diplomatic source also said that Karzai would be making a nationwide address flanked by U.S. Senator John Kerry and U.N. Special Representative to Afghanistan [[Kai Eide]], and claimed that Karzai was prepared to make concessions, such as forming a power-sharing coalition or agreeing to a run-off.&lt;ref name=audit/&gt;&lt;ref name=ruleout/&gt;&lt;ref name=clinton&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5h3mpSI8fPqHjCQ2uJQchn_R1BUoQD9BEC8180 Clinton says Karzai set to announce his intentions] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, according to ''The Times'', one of Karzai's senior cabinet ministers, [[Ismail Khan]], who had met with Karzai, said he had been told that a formal challenge will be issued: "''He said he will complain against the ECC decision, and demand an investigation into why they cut his votes."&lt;ref name=ruleout/&gt;

====Acquiescence to a run-off on November 7====
On October 20, 2009, under heavy U.S. and ally pressure, President Hamid Karzai announced his acquiescence to a run-off in the election. Flanked at a news conference by U.S. Senator [[John Kerry]], the head of the powerful [[United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations]], and [[Kai Eide]], the U.N. Special Representative to Afghanistan, he announced a run-off to be held on November 7, stating: "''Unfortunately, the election of Afghanistan was defamed. Any result that we were getting out of it was not able to bring legitimacy.''"&lt;ref name=nov7&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/21/world/asia/21afghan.html?hp "Karzai Agrees to Nov. 7 Runoff in Afghanistan"], ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=violence&gt;{{Cite news|last=Farmer |first=Ben |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/afghanistan/6389109/Hamid-Karzai-agrees-to-run-off-amid-fears-of-more-violence-and-fraud.html |title=Hamid Karzai agrees to run-off amid fears of more violence and fraud |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK |date=2009-10-20 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=future&gt;{{Cite news|last=Patience |first=Martin |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8317445.stm |title=Afghan elections - an uncertain future |publisher=BBC News   |date=2009-10-20 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pathf&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/21/world/asia/21afghan.html?bl "With New Afghan Vote, Path Forward Is Unclear"], ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt;

Karzai had initially indicated that he might reject the Western-dominated ECC's findings. According to ''The New York Times'', Karzai's capitulation came after "''all-out push''" by U.S. administration officials and their European allies. In a meeting hastily arranged after the release of the ECC ruling the previous day, U.S. Senator Kerry and the U.S. ambassador Lt. Gen. [[Karl W. Eikenberry]] were at the presidential palace in Kabul. Karzai initially hesitated but ended up agreeing to accept the findings during the course of the two-hour meeting.&lt;ref name=nov7/&gt;&lt;ref name=pathf/&gt;

Besides Senator Kerry and General Eikenberry, Karzai was pushed hard by U.S. Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]], who urged him in multiple calls over the last few days to be a "statesman" and accept the results, and by British Prime Minister [[Gordon Brown]], who called Karzai three times in the last 48 hours, warning him that he could lose Western support if he did not accede to a second round. Chiming in as well, Canadian Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]] also called to warn Karzai that he would face dire problems with the coalition countries involved in Afghanistan if he did not cooperate. The American, British, and French ambassadors to Afghanistan joined U.S. Senator Kerry and the U.N.'s Kai Eide in flanking Karzai as he made his announcement at the news conference. U.S. administration officials had also used President Obama's pending strategy review on Afghanistan as leverage on Karzai, indicating that they would not make a decision on adding troops until Karzai agreed to accept the election outcome.&lt;ref name=nov7/&gt;&lt;ref name=violence/&gt;&lt;ref name=future/&gt;&lt;ref name=pathf/&gt;&lt;ref name=thecall&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/Afghanistan/article6883040.ece "The call that made Hamid Karzai relent to a run-off in Afghanistan"], ''The Times'' (UK)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/harper-warns-karzai-to-accept-recount/article1328998/ |title=Harper warns Karzai to accept recount |work=The Globe and Mail|accessdate=2010-04-07 |location=Toronto, Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A senior Western official was quoted in [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/Afghanistan/article6883072.ece an article] by The Times as saying: "''No one wants a second round. It'll be expensive, bloody, and probably fraudulent.''"&lt;ref name=winter&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/Afghanistan/article6883072.ece "Winter election looms as Hamid Karzai bows to pressure"], ''The Times'' (UK)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''The Times'', the certified results after the audit findings had left Karzai with 49.67% of the vote, just 0.33% below the 50% threshold to have avoided the run-off.&lt;ref name=pathf/&gt;&lt;ref name=winter/&gt;

====October 21 certified final result====
On October 21, 2009, following the ECC's official audit findings and Karzai's heavily pressured acquiescence to a run-off, the IEC released its final certified results for the August 20 vote:&lt;ref name=IEC2&gt;{{Cite web|title=IEC - Presidential &amp; Provincial Council Elections - Afghanistan 2009 Elections - Final certified results released October 21, 2009 2PM |url=http://www.iec.org.af/results/leadingCandidate.html |date=2009-10-21 |accessdate=2009-10-23 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091103222205/http://www.iec.org.af/results/leadingCandidate.html |archivedate=November 3, 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==November 7 run-off election==
{{quote|text="''It is hard to see how a second round can be credible.''"|sign=Rachel Reid, Human Rights Watch, October 22, 2009&lt;ref name=analysts&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.montrealgazette.com/news/Afghan+vote+unlikely+credible+analysts/2130143/story.html |title=New Afghan vote unlikely to be credible, analysts say |publisher=Montrealgazette.com |accessdate=2010-04-07 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On October 23, election authorities, with UN assistance, began delivering ballots for the November 7 run-off. UN planes flew ballots and voting kits to provincial capitals from where they would be delivered to thousands of polling stations by helicopter, truck, women and donkey.&lt;ref name=eo&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hvWEqwq3CrRvaQCmt21MfoYhjZJQD9BG96UG1 Election officials deliver Afghan runoff ballots] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=troops&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/afghan-runoff-may-force-us-hand-on-troops-1806890.html |title=Afghan run-off may force US hand on troops |work=The Independent |location=UK |date=2009-10-22 |accessdate=2010-04-07|first1=Julius|last1=Cavendish|first2=David|last2=Usborne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of insecurity and fraud concerns, 7,000 polling stations – nearly 30% of the 24,000 polling stations that had been set up for the August 20 vote – were cut for the run-off vote.&lt;ref name=eo/&gt;

There were also concerns that voter turnout for the run-off could be even lower than the "anemic" [[#Post-audit voter turnout figures|turnout of 30–33%]] in the first round on August 20.&lt;ref name=UNAMA/&gt;&lt;ref name=delay/&gt;&lt;ref name=illegit&gt;{{Cite news|last=Editors |first=The |url=http://roomfordebate.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/10/21/is-a-fair-election-in-afghanistan-possible/#gilles |title=Already Illegitimate |work=The New York Times |date=2009-10-21 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Gilles Dorronsoro, a visiting scholar at the [[Carnegie Endowment]] and an expert on Afghanistan and South Asia: "''This time around, the weather will be worse, and the plain fact is, most Afghans don’t like their options enough to vote.''"&lt;ref name=illegit/&gt;

The UN told the IEC that 200 of its 380 district election chiefs in the first round had ignored procedures or been complicit in fraud and must not be hired again.&lt;ref name=tepid&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.thenational.ae/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20091024/FOREIGN/710239856/1135 |title=Afghans tepid to presidential runoff vote |publisher=Thenational.ae |date=2009-10-23 |accessdate=2010-04-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091028014633/http://www.thenational.ae/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20091024%2FFOREIGN%2F710239856%2F1135 |archivedate=October 28, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The run-off campaign period formally opened on October 24. Abdullah's campaign called for the dismissal of the three top officials of the Independent Election Commission (IEC), accusing them of having allowed widespread fraud in the first round of the election.&lt;ref name=Dr/&gt;&lt;ref name=As&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-afghan-vote25-2009oct25,0,7367781.story |title=As Afghan runoff campaign opens, Taliban again threatens voters |work=Los Angeles Times  |date=2009-10-25 |accessdate=2010-04-07 | first=Laura | last=King}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both run-off candidates were reported to be frantically wooing [[Ramazan Bashardost]], the presidential candidate that had placed third in the August 20 first round vote.&lt;ref name=Dr/&gt;

Bashardost, who had campaigned against the corruption and greed of Kabul politicians and against the poverty of Afghans, said he had not decided who to support between the two – if anyone – saying the choice was between "''the worst, and worse than the worst.''"&lt;ref name=eo/&gt;

The Taliban reiterated their call for Afghans to boycott the election, denouncing it as a foreign-orchestrated sham.&lt;ref name=Dr/&gt;&lt;ref name=As/&gt;

On October 26, Abdullah called again for the sacking of [[Azizullah Lodin]], the head of the Independent Election Commission, saying that he had "no credibility".&lt;ref name=Lodin&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8325709.stm |title=Row erupts over Afghan poll chief|accessdate=2009-10-26|date=2009-10-26|publisher=BBC News  | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091027093210/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8325709.stm| archivedate=October 27, 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Karzai rejected the call by Abdullah, stating "the changes would not be helpful to the elections and the country".&lt;ref name=Lodin/&gt;

===Abdullah withdrawal from the run-off vote===
On November 1, 2009, Abdullah Abdullah announced that he was withdrawing from the run-off vote, saying "I will not participate in the November 7 election," because his demands for changes in the electoral commission had not been met, and a "transparent election is not possible." Hamid Karzai had rejected Abdullah's demand that the head of the IEC resign.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8336388.stm |title=Abdullah pulls out of Afghan vote |publisher=BBC News   |date=2009-11-01 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Abdullah5&gt;{{Cite news|author= |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/afghanistan/6478225/Abdullah-Abdullah-pulls-out-of-Afghan-presidential-election-run-off.html |title=Abdullah Abdullah pulls out of Afghan presidential election run-off |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK |date=2009-11-01 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abdullah also said the Afghan people should not accept results of an election from the current election commission, and stated that Karzai's government had not been legitimate since its mandate expired in May 2009.&lt;ref name=Abdullah5/&gt;

Speculation immediately followed that the run-off election would be cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.thenational.ae/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20091101/GLOBALBRIEFING/911019991/1009/NEWS?template=globalbriefing |title=Afghan run-off election likely to be cancelled |publisher=Thenational.ae |date=2009-11-01 |accessdate=2010-04-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140427010520/http://www.thenational.ae/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20091101%2FGLOBALBRIEFING%2F911019991%2F1009%2FNEWS%3Ftemplate%3Dglobalbriefing |archivedate=April 27, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Afghanistan was thrown into a crisis after the withdrawal of Abdullah, which in effect cleared the way for Karzai to retain power despite the accusations of fraud. A weakened Karzai administration, shorn of electoral legitimacy, would represent a major blow to the Western allies who considered to send more troops to fight the Taliban.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/afghan-chaos-as-abdullah-pulls-out-of-election-1813186.html |title=Afghan chaos as Abdullah pulls out of election - Dilemma for Washington as second round becomes a one-horse race for Karzai |work=The Independent |location=UK |date=2009-11-02 |accessdate=2010-04-07|first=Kim|last=Sengupta}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Perceived U.S. interference==
The United States is widely seen to have an enormous stake riding on the outcome of the election in Afghanistan. While U.S. officials have taken great pains to repeatedly assert neutrality, there are many perceptions and allegations of U.S. interference and manipulation in Afghanistan.&lt;ref name=farce/&gt;&lt;ref name=obama/&gt;&lt;ref name=squand/&gt;&lt;ref name=withK&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://e-ariana.com/ariana/eariana.nsf/allDocs/CDDB55AE1A7AC53B8725761200518AA6?OpenDocument |title=With Karzai Favored to Win, U.S. Walks a Fine Line |publisher=E-ariana.com |date=2009-08-14 |accessdate=2010-04-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130121182313/http://e-ariana.com/ariana/eariana.nsf/allDocs/CDDB55AE1A7AC53B8725761200518AA6?OpenDocument |archivedate=January 21, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=USwalks&gt;{{Cite news|author=ANAND GOPAL |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB125164667290770259 |title=U.S. Walks Fine Line in Afghan Vote |work=The Wall Street Journal |date=2009-08-31 |accessdate=2010-04-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091231063132/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB125164667290770259.html |archivedate=December 31, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:2009 Afghan Presidential election2.jpg|thumb|Armored US military trucks distributing ballot boxes.]]

Many in Afghanistan perceive the U.S. to have favoured [[Ashraf Ghani]] and [[Abdullah Abdullah]] over [[Hamid Karzai]].&lt;ref name=US3/&gt;&lt;ref name=withK/&gt;

Four prominent Afghan politicians, including Ghani and Abdullah, were in attendance at U.S. President Obama's inauguration in January. Karzai, however, was not. Media reports began appearing that suggested that the U.S. was eager for a change at the top in Afghanistan. Hamid Karzai was also angered when the U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan, [[Karl W. Eikenberry]], appeared beside Ghani and Abdullah at news conferences in June, ahead of the election, though Eikenberry stressed impartiality in his remarks. After Karzai did not show up at the first televised debate – against Abdullah and Ghani – the U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan published an op-ed in [[The Washington Post]] calling for "serious debate among the candidates" in Afghanistan.&lt;ref name=farce/&gt;&lt;ref name=obama/&gt;&lt;ref name=squand/&gt;&lt;ref name=withK/&gt;

All these developments were viewed by many in Afghanistan as a message about which candidates the U.S. now preferred to have in power in Afghanistan.&lt;ref name=US3/&gt;&lt;ref name=withK/&gt;

{{quote|text="''"The U.S. has certainly tried to undermine Karzai's leadership.''"|sign=Haroun Mir, director of Afghanistan's Centre for Research &amp; Policy Studies&lt;ref name=withK/&gt;}}

Some of Karzai's rivals have alluded that Karzai is extremely concerned about foreign interference in Afghanistan.&lt;ref name=US3/&gt;&lt;ref name=withK/&gt;

"He considers everybody part of that big plot," Abdullah said. "In the meetings with elders and political leaders who have talked and spoken to me, he says this, 'We should unite. You know, there are plots, Americans, British,' and so on and so forth."&lt;ref name=withK/&gt;

Both Abdullah Abdullah and Ashraf Ghani have told people privately that the United States gave them the green light to run for president, according to a former U.S. official in Afghanistan.&lt;ref name=US3/&gt;&lt;ref name=withK/&gt;

===Allegations of U.S. manipulation===
As the first installments of vote counting results were being released, about a week after election day, [[Ramazan Bashardost]], who ran third in exit polls, contended that the U.S. was playing a role in manipulating the outcome, in order to use a contested situation for its plans to broker a deal among the leading candidates.&lt;ref name=USwalks/&gt;&lt;ref name=mischief&gt;{{Cite news|last=Motlagh |first=Jason |url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1918850,00.html |title=Afghanistan's Long Vote Count: Room for Mischief? |work=TIME  |date=2009-08-26 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have made the same contention.&lt;ref name=wizard/&gt;&lt;ref name=US3/&gt;

A TIME [http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1918110,00.html article] that came out just after the election did suggest that a contested election outcome could "suit the U.S. purpose."&lt;ref name="how?"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Karon |first=Tony |url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1918110,00.html |title=How a Contested Afghan Election Could Help the U.S. |work=TIME  |date=2009-08-22 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some support for Bashardost's allegation may be seen in the U.S.-funded [[#Pre-election polls|pre-election polls]], one conducted by what Gary Langer, director of polling at ABC News, [http://blogs.abcnews.com/thenumbers/2009/08/assessing-the-afghanistan-election.html described] as "an outfit called Glevum Associates, which appears from its website to be a military contractor engaged in producing psychological operations data as part of a U.S. Army counterinsurgency program, the Human Terrain System," and the other by the [[International Republican Institute]], a "pro-democracy group affiliated with the Republican Party and financed by the American government."&lt;ref name=IRI&gt;[http://www.iri.org/mena/afghanistan/pdfs/2009%20August%2014%20Survey%20of%20Afghan%20Public%20Opinion%20July%2016-26,%202009.pdf International Republican Institute - Afghanistan Public Opinion Survey:July 16–26, 2009]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090824005330/http://www.iri.org/mena/afghanistan/pdfs/2009%20August%2014%20Survey%20of%20Afghan%20Public%20Opinion%20July%2016-26%2C%202009.pdf |date=August 24, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=assess&gt;{{Cite web|author=Gary Langer |url=http://blogs.abcnews.com/thenumbers/2009/08/assessing-the-afghanistan-election.html |title=Assessing the Afghanistan Election |publisher=Blogs.abcnews.com |date=2009-08-25 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In their May 3–16, 2009 poll, the International Republican Institute found that Bashardost [[#Pre-election polls|placed higher]] than Abdullah Abdullah and Ashraf Ghani in favorability amongst Afghans, and that Bashardost and Ghani both came in at the very same level of support, 3%, when Afghans were asked who they would vote for president in an open-ended question. Yet their July 16–26 survey asked a series of questions that quite specifically included Ghani, but left Bashardost out for some reason:&lt;ref name=IRI/&gt;

*"''If the presidential race were among only three people - Hamid Karzai, Ashraf Ghani, and Abdulah Abdullah - which one would you vote for president?''"
*"''If there is a second round election and the candidates are Hamid Karzai and Abdullah Abdullah, for whom would you vote?''"
*"''If there is a second round election and the candidates are Hamid Karzai and Ashraf Ghani, for whom would you vote?''"
*"''Do you think a unified team of Abdullah and Ashraf Ghani is a good option for Afghanistan?''"

===New chief executive position===
U.S. officials have also made clear, even before the election, that – regardless of who won the Afghan election – Washington planned to use the leverage of the military force and financial resources at its command to extensively reorganize the Afghan government according to U.S. plans. The U.S. would push for a new non-elected "Chief Executive" position to be inserted under the President, with the appointee taking over all the day-to-day operations of the country.&lt;ref name=farce/&gt;&lt;ref name=obama/&gt;&lt;ref name=squand/&gt;&lt;ref name=seven/&gt;&lt;ref name=withK/&gt;&lt;ref name="how?"/&gt;&lt;ref name=west&gt;{{Cite news|author= |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/aug/25/western-hypocrisy-afghanistan-elections |title=West loses its values in Afghanistan |work=Guardian |location=UK |date=2008-05-29 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ex&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/19/world/asia/19diplo.html "Ex-U.S. Envoy May Take Key Role in Afghan Government"], ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt;

Ashraf Ghani has widely been characterized as the U.S. favourite for appointment to that position. (Another mention was [[Zalmay Khalilzad]].) Ghani has had discussions with U.S. officials, including both the U.S. special envoy to Afghanistan, [[Richard Holbrooke]], and the U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan, [[Karl Eikenberry]], and has denied turning down the job offer. He told reporters a few days before the election: "''I've been approached repeatedly; the offer is on the table. I have not accepted it.''"&lt;ref name=farce/&gt;&lt;ref name=wizard/&gt;&lt;ref name=obama/&gt;&lt;ref name=squand/&gt;&lt;ref name=withK/&gt;&lt;ref name="how?"/&gt;&lt;ref name=west/&gt;&lt;ref name=ex/&gt;

Other plans by the U.S. [[United States Department of Defense|Defense]] and [[State department]]s also call for the installation of American "''mentors''" and liaisons inside Afghan government ministries in Kabul, a policy that was heavily used in the early years of the U.S. military [[History of Iraq (2003–2011)|occupation of Iraq]].&lt;ref name=withK/&gt;

The powerful, non-elected "chief executive" position envisaged for insertion into the Afghan government was characterized by a senior White House official as "a prime minister, except not prime minister because he wouldn’t be responsible to a parliamentary system."&lt;ref name=ex/&gt;

Afghan Foreign Minister [[Rangin Dadfar Spanta]] said that installing a "shadow prime-minister" would pose constitutional problems, but said: "''I know that in Washington this idea has strong supporters.''"&lt;ref name=withK/&gt;

===U.S. efforts to force a run-off===
The day after the election, a tense meeting took place between the U.S. special envoy to Afghanistan, [[Richard Holbrooke]], and Afghan president Hamid Karzai, with sources describing the meeting as "a dramatic bust up" and "explosive". [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/Afghanistan/article6814965.ece According] to ''[[The Times]]'', Holbrooke was already raising the possibility of a run-off, causing Karzai to accuse the U.S. special envoy of trying to force a second round "against the interests of Afghanistan".&lt;ref name=wizard/&gt;&lt;ref name=obama2&gt;{{Cite news|author=Haroon Siddique |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/aug/28/karzai-holbrooke-election-clash |title=Obama's envoy Holbrooke 'in heated row' with Karzai |work=Guardian |location=UK |date= 2009-08-28|accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/Afghanistan/article6814965.ece "Hamid Karzai in fiery row with US official"], ''The Times'' (UK)&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. special envoy also met with Karzai's rival, Abdullah Abdullah, after the election. The discussion between Holbrooke and Karzai was said to have been noticeably briefer than Holbrooke's meeting with Abdullah.&lt;ref name=obama2/&gt;

On August 29, it was announced that the envoys from the United States, Britain, France, and Germany would meet in Paris to discuss the Afghan elections. According to [[The Times]], a French official said that Holbrooke wanted a run-off in order to chasten Karzai and show him his power was limited.&lt;ref name=wizard/&gt;&lt;ref name=closer/&gt;

Reacting to reports that the U.S. special envoy to Afghanistan wanted the vote to go to a second round for the sake of [[credibility]], the IEC said the result is an Afghan issue:&lt;ref name=closer/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"''It is not up to Mr. Holbrooke to decide the first or the second round, this decision is up to the people of Afghanistan who have voted and the IEC is counting these votes.''"
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On September 3, 2009, envoys from the United States, Britain, France, Germany, and other Western countries met in Paris to discuss the Afghan elections and how to rescue their costly efforts. The Paris meeting was seen as an effort to garner support for the U.S. response to the election and pressure Afghan President Hamid Karzai. The Western envoys to Afghanistan said to expect a run-off in the Afghan election, suggesting that one could occur if enough votes are invalidated.&lt;ref name=closer/&gt;&lt;ref name=attack/&gt;&lt;ref name=western&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://features.csmonitor.com/globalnews/2009/09/02/western-envoys-expect-run-off-in-afghanistan-election/ |title=Western envoys: Expect run-off in Afghanistan election |publisher=csmonitor.com |date=2009-09-02 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S., European, and NATO leaders also declared in their Paris meeting that their Western military troops were staying in Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Lynne O'Donnell |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hO--E7LsTUreTrJsoPN4drBbi7cQ |title=Devastating suicide strikes show Taliban expansion |date=2009-09-02 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with [[Le Figaro]] released on September 7, 2009, Hamid Karzai accused the United States of trying to undermine him in order to make him more malleable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSL7677562 |title=Karzai says United States wants to manipulate him |agency=Reuters  |date=2009-09-07 |accessdate=2010-04-07 | first=Crispian | last=Balmer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 13, 2009, the [[Sunday Telegraph]] reported that a "stormy meeting" between U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan, former U.S. general [[Karl Eikenberry]], and President Karzai had occurred the previous week. "Don't declare victory," warned the ambassador, on the instructions of Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]]. The Telegraph reported that the Afghan president had refused to meet American officials since then.&lt;ref name=US3&gt;{{Cite news|last=Farmer |first=Ben |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/afghanistan/6180179/US-tries-to-force-Afghanistan-election-deal.html |title=US tries to force Afghanistan election deal |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK |date=2009-09-12 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 15, 2009, the top U.S. diplomat to the [[United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan|United Nations mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA)]], [[Peter Galbraith]], was [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/Afghanistan/article6834487.ece reportedly] ordered out of the country by the head of the mission, U.N. Special Representative to Afghanistan [[Kai Eide]], following a heated disagreement over the American diplomat's demands for a wholesale recount that would virtually ensure a run-off. According to diplomatic sources, Galbraith – a close friend of the U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke – wanted the Independent Election Commission (IEC) to annul results from 1,000 of the nationwide total of about 6,500 polling centres and to recount results from another 5,000. Eide, on the other hand had been seeking only a recount of some 1,000 polling centres. UN officials suggested that Mr. Galbraith's position was representative of the U.S. stance, while Mr. Eide's echoed those of the European missions in Kabul.&lt;ref name=UNchief&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/Afghanistan/article6834487.ece "UN chief Peter Galbraith is removed in Afghanistan poll clash"], ''The Times'' (UK)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''The Times'', the IEC were preparing on September 8 to announce results for the last 15% of ballots, mostly from the controversial areas of the south and [[Badghis province]] in the north that were expected to return big majorities for Karzai, when Galbraith stepped in and forced them not to announce those results.&lt;ref name=UNchief/&gt;

At a meeting with IEC officials on September 13, Galbraith "laid into the commissioners, in front of the donors and observers" and demanded to know why they had not yet started printing ballot papers in preparation for a run-off.&lt;ref name=UNchief/&gt;

On September 30, 2009, The Times [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/Afghanistan/article6856029.ece reported] that the U.S. diplomat was fired from the UN mission in Afghanistan. The [[UN Secretary-General]], [[Ban Ki Moon]], said he dismissed Galbraith "in the best interests of the mission" after the Karzai government had told the UN that it was unwilling to deal with the American in the future. The Times also revealed that UN Special Representative to Afghanistan Kai Eide had lobbied hard behind the scenes against the appointment of Galbraith as his deputy, but that the United States had pushed Ban Ki Moon to appoint Galbraith, a close friend and ally of [[Richard Holbrooke]], the U.S. Special Envoy to Afghanistan and Pakistan.&lt;ref name=UNenvoy&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/Afghanistan/article6856029.ece "UN envoy Peter Galbraith sacked after attack on Afghanistan poll fraud"], ''The Times'' (UK)&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2009, numerous news articles, such as [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/21/world/asia/21afghan.html?bl one] by ''The New York Times'' and [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/10/20/AR2009102003447.html another] by the Associate Press, described the extraordinary American efforts, in concert with allies, over multiple days to pressure Hamid Karzai into acceding to run-off vote. On October 20, caving in to the relentless U.S. arm-twisting, he [[#Acquiescence to a run-off on November 7|reluctantly acquiesced]].&lt;ref name=pathf/&gt;&lt;ref name=winter/&gt;&lt;ref name=troops/&gt;&lt;ref name=tepid/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/10/20/AR2009102003447.html Karzai needed convincing twice on new election]{{Dead link|date=April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===U.S. efforts to force a power-sharing deal===
On September 13, 2009, the [[Sunday Telegraph]] [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/afghanistan/6180179/US-tries-to-force-Afghanistan-election-deal.html reported] that American officials were making frantic efforts to force President Hamid Karzai into a power-sharing deal against his wishes, stating that "US officials have made little secret of their wish to see his wings clipped". In what one official in Kabul described as "turmoil" behind the scenes, Western diplomats were attempting to convert the election crisis into an opportunity for their purposes by forcing Karzai to share power in government with Dr. Abdullah Abdullah and "reformist ministers", and accept a diminished role for the presidency.&lt;ref name=US3/&gt;
[[File:John Kerry with Abdullah Abdullah in 2009.jpg|thumb|U.S. Senator [[John Kerry]] and losing candidate [[Abdullah Abdullah]] in October 2009.]]

Intense Western diplomatic pressure was also being exerted on Abdullah Abdullah to cut a deal. According to ''The Telegraph'', the fear is that if Karzai defies Washington and appoints his own choice of allies to key ministerial roles, he would be more "difficult for the West to influence".&lt;ref name=US3/&gt;

On September 27, 2009, it was reported that the United States and other NATO countries with military forces in Afghanistan had indicated to Hamid Karzai's government that they expected he would remain in office for another five-year term. The U.S. Secretary of State and foreign ministers of the countries, meeting in New York on September 25, 2009, with U.N. Special Representative [[Kai Eide]] and Afghan Foreign Minister Rangin Spanta, reached "consensus" in Spanta's presence that Hamid Karzai would probably "continue to be president" of Afghanistan, whether by winning a run-off or as a result of having won more than 50% of the ballots in the disputed August 20 elections. The electoral fraud investigations by the Electoral Complaints Commission had not yet been completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author= |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/09/27/AR2009092703155_pf.html |title=U.S., Allies Vow Support for Karzai |work=The Washington Post  |date=2009-09-27 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Farmer |first=Ben |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/6240118/US-says-Hamid-Karzai-likely-to-be-re-elected.html |title=US 'says' Hamid Karzai likely to be re-elected |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK |date=2009-09-28 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 15, 2009, [[Zalmay Khalilzad]], the former U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan under [[George W. Bush]], arrived in Kabul from Washington D.C. A spokesperson for the U.S. Embassy in Kabul said Khalilzad was there as a "private citizen" and that he was not representing the United States government. Earlier in the year Khalilzad was widely discussed as an American favorite to assume a powerful, unelected [[#New chief executive position|"CEO" position]] that U.S. officials hoped to create inside the Afghan government. A Western official said Khalilzad had come on the invitation of Mr. Karzai, but a spokesman for Karzai’s campaign denied that. In an appearance on Afghan television, Khalilzad indicated that he had come to help Afghans during a difficult election process, but an official in Mr. Abdullah’s campaign said they did not want his assistance, saying "''We do not need any broker''."&lt;ref name=ex/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/16/world/asia/16afghan.html?hpw "Karzai Challenger Hints at Flexibility on Afghan Vote"], ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 17, 2009, the U.N.-backed Electoral Complaints Commission, which had widely been expected to release its findings from the statistics-based audit, delayed the announcement again as U.S. and ally envoys pressured Karzai and Abdullah to state their acceptance of the findings before the ECC announcement and to work out a power-sharing deal. A senior American official made the point of stating that Karzai and Abdullah together won more than 70% of the votes in the first round, ensuring the credibility of a government in which they shared power. A Karzai spokesman indicated that both foreign and Afghan officials were proffering formulas for power sharing, but that Karzai had rejected them and would not discuss power sharing until after a winner is declared. Abdullah also reiterated that he would consider negotiating after the results were announced.&lt;ref name=underpressure/&gt;&lt;ref name=allies/&gt;

On October 18, 2009, ''The Telegraph'' [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/afghanistan/6367822/Afghan-leaders-under-pressure-to-avoid-election-run-off.html reported] that the ECC results were being "''delayed as the West asked the men to reach an agreement that would avoid another round of voting.''" In veiled criticism of Hamid Karzai, White House Chief of Staff [[Rahm Emanuel]] made clear that the U.S. would not send more troops to Afghanistan until there is a 'true partner' to work with in Kabul. An expert familiar with the U.S. administration's thinking suggested there was no longer any stomach for an election run-off after the "organisational headaches and risks to American troops" brought by the August 20 ballot, and stated: "''There is a clear preference for a deal.''"&lt;ref name=underpressure2/&gt;

French foreign minister Bernard Kouchner stated that Karzai and Abdullah were ready to "work together" to find a settlement. A Western diplomat in Kabul said: "The idea now is to reach an agreement in which Karzai's victory at the first round is accepted ..."&lt;ref name=underpressure2/&gt;

Following the flurry of last-minute phone calls, visits, and statements that U.S. and other Western officials made to Karzai, on October 19, 2009, ''The New York Times'' reported an unnamed Western official saying: "''In the last 72 hours, I think even Karzai got the message.''".&lt;ref name=has48/&gt;

Demonstrations supporting Karzai took place in [[Kandahar]], in the south of Afghanistan and in [[Ghazni province]] in the center of the country. In the district of [[Spin Boldak]], around 3,000 demonstrators gathered in a market, shouting: "''We don't want foreigners to interfere in our election.''"&lt;ref name=has48/&gt;

Ali Shah Khan, a tribal leader from the area, said the protesters believed that foreigners were deliberately delaying the election results, and stated: "''The foreign countries want a weak leader for Afghanistan. After that they can do whatever they want.''"&lt;ref name=panel/&gt;

On October 19, 2009, the ECC communicated its fraud investigation result to the IEC, with its unofficially released findings stripping approximately a million votes from Karzai – and bringing his vote share slightly below the critical 50% threshold required to win without a run-off. The continued concerns that Karzai and the IEC, whose members he appointed, might reject the ECC's findings, resulted in continuation of the intense American and ally efforts to pressure Karzai into accepting a power-sharing deal or face a run-off vote.&lt;ref name=audit/&gt;&lt;ref name=ruleout/&gt;

According to the U.S. Embassy in Kabul, Senator [[John Kerry]] made an unplanned stop in Kabul to meet Karzai in the presidential palace "''to continue his discussions and consultations''". Meanwhile, according to White House spokesperson Robert Gibbs, the U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan, former U.S. army general [[Karl Eikenberry]] who commanded U.S. and ally forces in Afghanistan in 2005–2007, was also engaged in "''delicate but extremely important''" efforts to persuade Karzai to accept the U.N. panel's ruling.&lt;ref name=audit/&gt;&lt;ref name=ruleout/&gt;

U.S. Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]], stating that she had spoken with Karzai a number of times in recent days, announced that Karzai would be making an announcement the next day, saying "''He is going to announce his intentions ... I am very hopeful that we will see a resolution in line with the constitutional order in the next several days. But I don't want to pre-empt in any way President Karzai's statement, which will set the stage for how we go forward in the next stage of this.''" A diplomatic source told [[The Times]] that Karzai would make a nationwide address flanked by U.S. Senator John Kerry and U.N. Special Representative to Afghanistan [[Kai Eide]], claiming that Karzai was prepared to make concessions, such as agreeing to a run-off or forming a power-sharing coalition.&lt;ref name=audit/&gt;&lt;ref name=ruleout/&gt;&lt;ref name=clinton/&gt;

On the other hand, ''The Times'' [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/Afghanistan/article6881718.ece reported] that one of Karzai's senior cabinet ministers, [[Ismail Khan]], who had met with Karzai, said he had been told that a formal challenge will be issued: "''He said he will complain against the ECC decision, and demand an investigation into why they cut his votes."&lt;ref name=ruleout/&gt;

According to one analysis on October 20, 2009, [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/Afghanistan/article6881898.ece "''Why a weakened President remains the least worst option''"] by Tom Coghlan in The Times, the U.S. did not want a run-off to take place, but, rather, was trying to push Karzai into entering a power-sharing deal with his rival, in order to keep him in office but with a "''weakened mandate''".&lt;ref name=thecall/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/Afghanistan/article6881898.ece Why a weakened President remains the least worst option"], ''The Times'' (UK)&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 20, 2009, after Karzai caved in to intense U.S. and ally pressure that a senior U.S. administration official described as a "''full court press''", and acceded to a run-off, diplomats said the efforts to get the two men to join forces would now intensify.&lt;ref name=future/&gt;&lt;ref name=pathf/&gt;

On October 21, 2009, U.S. officials, including a U.S. defence official, emphasized that a power-sharing agreement remained a strong possibility as a way of resolving the crisis without going through with the run-off that had just been announced the day before.&lt;ref name=troops/&gt;

On October 25, 2009, Karzai and Abdullah, responding to questions in separate interviews on U.S. television, both rejected a power-sharing deal before the run-off vote. Karzai, responding to questions in a CNN interview, stated that such a deal would be "''an insult to democracy''". Abdullah, responding to questions on Fox News, ruled out a deal ahead of the run-off, and, in another interview on CNN, stated he had "''absolutely no interest''" in joining the government if Karzai won, saying that he would not be "''part of the same deteriorating situation''". The New York Times wrote that such a coalition would provide the U.S. and NATO with political cover for the continued presence of their military forces "''because they would be backing a government that had the support of a vast majority of Afghans.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2009/10/25/afghanistan-runoff.html |title=Karzai, Abdullah reject power-sharing |publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]  |date=2009-10-25 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8325331.stm |title=Afghan poll rivals rule out deal |publisher=BBC News   |date=2009-10-26 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/26/world/asia/26afghan.html "Afghan Rivals Rule Out Power-Sharing Deal"], ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/asiaCrisis/idUSN24139145 |title=Karzai rival says won't join Afghan government |agency=Reuters  |date=2009-10-24 |accessdate=2010-04-07 | first=Mohammad | last=Zargham}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accusations of foreign interference from within the ECC===
On October 12, 2009, one of the two Afghan members of the Western-dominated Electoral Complaints Commission resigned over "foreign interference".&lt;ref name=beset/&gt;

Maulavi Mustafa Barakzai, a judge who ad been appointed to the panel by the Afghan Supreme Court, stated that his resignation was due to the fact that the three UN-appointed Western officials on the panel – an American, a Canadian, and a Dutch – were "making all the decisions on their own" and that Afghans had little input in its decisions.&lt;ref name=beset/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/mod-wins-first-round-of-compensation-battle-1801783.html |title=MoD wins first round of compensation battle |work=The Independent |location=UK |date=2009-10-13 |accessdate=2010-04-07|first=Kim|last=Sengupta}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barakzai's resignation left the Electoral Complaints Commission (ECC) with only one Afghan member and three officials from countries with foreign military troops in Afghanistan. The ECC is led by one of the three foreign officials, chairman Grant Kippen.

Karzai said that the resignation Barakzai "cast serious doubt" on the work of the commission.

Mustafa Barakzai, a Supreme Court Judge who was one of two Afghans on the Commission, resigned on Monday claiming foreigners were "interfering" in its work. Supporters of Abdullah claimed that Karzai was somehow behind Barakzai's sudden resignation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author= |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/karzai-has-grave-doubts-about-vote-fraud-panel-1802262.html |title=Karzai has 'grave doubts' about vote fraud panel |work=The Independent |location=UK |date=2009-10-14 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accusations of a United Nations cover-up==
U.S. diplomat [[Peter Galbraith]], fired from his UN post by [[UN Secretary-General]] [[Ban Ki Moon]] on September 30, 2009, after accusing his former boss, UN special envoy [[Kai Eide]], of helping cover up electoral fraud and being biased in favor of Hamid Karzai, further accused the UN of fabricating the reason for his dismissal and of helping to cover up massive electoral fraud committed by Afghan President [[Hamid Karzai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2009/10/5/fired_un_official_peter_galbraith_accuses

In his statements on October 4, 2009, the American diplomat characterized the Afghan election as a "''train wreck''", and claimed: "''As many as 30% of Karzai's votes were fraudulent, and lesser fraud was committed on behalf of other candidates.''"&lt;ref name=US5/&gt;

Galbraith told the Washington Post that [[UN Secretary-General]] [[Ban Ki Moon]]'s final instruction before firing him was: "''Do not talk''".&lt;ref name=US5/&gt;

On October 11, 2009, [[Kai Eide]] referred to Galbraith's allegations as "personal attacks" against his integrity, adding they have "affected the whole election process."&lt;ref name=widespread/&gt;

The '''Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels''' (ACAP) is a legally binding international [[treaty]] signed in 2001 and entered into force on 1 February 2004 when South Africa ratified as the fifth Party to the agreement.

It was created in order to halt the drastic decline of [[seabird]] populations in the [[Southern Hemisphere]], particularly [[albatross]]es and petrels [[Procellariidae|procellariids]]. Albatrosses and petrels are threatened by [[introduced species]] on their breeding islands, [[pollution]], and being taken as [[bycatch]] by [[Longline fishing|longline fisheries]], as well as by [[Trawling|trawl]] and [[Gillnetting|gillnet]] fisheries. The agreement requires that measures be taken by signatory governments to reduce bycatch; protect breeding [[Seabird colony|colonies]]; and control and remove introduced species from breeding sites, especially on islands.

Currently, ACAP protects all the world's albatross species, seven Southern Hemisphere [[petrel]] and two [[shearwater]] species. The agreement marks an increasing international commitment to protect albatrosses and petrels.

==Organization==
The Executive Secretary of ACAP is Marco Favero, who is supported by a Science Officer, Wiesława Misiak, and an Information Officer, John Cooper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels - ACAP Secretariat Staff|url=https://acap.aq/en/contactse/acap-secretariat-staff|website=acap.aq|accessdate=30 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The secretariat is located at 119 Macquarie Street, [[Hobart]] in the state of [[Tasmania]], [[Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/other/dfat/treaties/2008/19.html "Headquarters Agreement Between the Government of Australia and the Secretariat to the Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels (Hobart, 23 June 2008) - ATS 19 of 2008”].

The agreement entered into force on 1 February 2004. National representatives of the signatory countries meet regularly.

Nine meetings of ACAP's Advisory Committee have been held to date, the last in La Serena, Chile from 9 to 13 May 2016. The Advisory Committee is currently supported by three working groups for Taxonomy, Seabird Bycatch, and Population and Conservation Status.

==Provisions==
ACAP helps countries to implement species action plans, control the expansion of non-native predators, introduce measures reducing bycatch of seabirds, and support research in the sphere of the effective conservation of petrels and albatrosses. To this end it has published ACAP Species Assessments, booklets, mitigation factsheets, and a number of ACAP Conservation Guidelines, including for biosecurity; eradication of introduced mammals; translocation; and census and survey methods.

One of the agreement's main activities is to provide expert advice on seabird bycatch mitigation to fisheries managers, both in domestic and high seas fisheries.

==Summary==
The Agricultural Act of 1948 enacted several agricultural policy reforms, including mandatory [[price support]]s for basic [[Commodity|commodities]] at 90% of parity. It also mandated that in 1950, parity would begin to incorporate price averages of the previous ten years and the 1910-14 [[base period]].&lt;ref name=sum/&gt; The legislation also amended several provisions of the previously passed [[Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938]] (Pub.L. 75-430, 52 Stat. 31), including price support and [[marketing quota]]s for corn, wheat, cotton, rice and tobacco. Title I of the law, which pertained to price stabilization, took effect immediately while Title II, which amended the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938, and Title III, which contained various miscellaneous provisions, both took effect on January 1, 1950.&lt;ref&gt;[[Act of Congress|Pub.L.]] 80-897, 62 [[United States Statutes at Large|Stat.]] 1247, enacted July 3, 1948&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15246">'''Anti-sweatshop movement''' refers to campaigns to improve the conditions of workers in [[sweatshop]]s, i.e. manufacturing places characterized by low wages, poor working conditions and often [[child labor]]. It started in the 19th century in industrialized countries such as the [[United States]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]] and the [[United Kingdom]] to improve the conditions of workers in those countries.&lt;ref name=Blackburn&gt;Sheila Blackburn (1991) ''The Historical Journal'' '''34''' (1) 43-64 "Ideology and Social Policy: The Origins of the Trade Boards Act"&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Some of the earliest sweatshop critics were found in the 19th-century [[Abolitionism|abolitionist]] movement that had originally coalesced in opposition to chattel [[slavery]], and many abolitionists saw similarities between slavery and sweatshop work. As slavery was successively outlawed in industrial countries between 1794 (in France) and 1865 (in the United States), some abolitionists sought to broaden the anti-slavery consensus to include other forms of harsh labor, including sweatshops. As it happened, the first significant law to address sweatshops (the [[Factory Act|Factory Act of 1833]]) was passed in the United Kingdom at the same time that the slave trade (1807) and ownership of slaves (1833) were made illegal.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Miers, Suzanne (2003). ''Slavery in the Twentieth Century: The Evolution of a Global Problem''. Alta Mira Press, Walnut Creek, California.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately, the abolitionist movement split apart. Some advocates focused on working conditions and found common cause with trade unions and [[Marxists]] and socialist political groups, or [[progressive movement]] and the [[muckraker]]s. Others focused on the continued slave trade and [[involuntary servitude]] in the colonial world. For those groups that remained focused on slavery, sweatshops became one of the primary objects of controversy. Workplaces across multiple sectors of the economy were categorized as sweatshops. However, there were fundamental philosophical disagreements about what constituted slavery. Unable to agree on the status of sweatshops, the abolitionists working with the [[League of Nations]] and the United Nations ultimately backed away from efforts to define slavery, and focused instead on a common precursor of slavery – [[human trafficking]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Those focused on working conditions included [[Friedrich Engels]], whose book ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844]]'' would inspire the Marxist movement named for his collaborator, [[Karl Marx]]. In the United Kingdom the Factory Act was revised six further times between 1844 and 1878 to help improve the condition of workers by limiting work hours and the use of child labor. The formation of the [[International Labour Organization]] in 1919 under the League of Nations and then the United Nations sought to address the plight of workers the world over. Concern over working conditions as described by muckraker journalists during the [[Progressive Era]] in the United States saw the passage of new workers rights laws and ultimately resulted in the [[Fair Labor Standards Act]] of 1938, passed during the [[New Deal]].&lt;ref&gt;"Fair Labor Standards Act - FLSA - 29 U.S. Code Chapter 8". ''finduslaw.com''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 20th century, with the advent of [[globalization]], movements were formed to protest the [[exploitation of labour|exploitation of workers]] in poorer countries by companies based in wealthy countries. [[Noam Chomsky]] said in ''[[The Nation]]'' that the anti-sweatshop movement is in some ways, he said, "like the [[Anti-Apartheid Movement]], except that in this case it's striking at the core of the relations of exploitation. It's another example of how different constituencies are working together."&lt;ref name="Chomsky"&gt;[http://www.thenation.com/doc/20000424/chomsky/2 "Talking 'Anarchy' With Chomsky", ''The Nation'', April 5, 2000]&lt;/ref&gt;  On February 4, 1997 Mayor Ed Boyle of North Olmsted, Ohio introduced the first piece of legislation actually prohibiting the government of purchasing, renting, or taking on consignment any and all goods made under sweatshop conditions and including in the definition those goods made by political prisoners. This legislation was copied by other American cities such as Detroit, New York, and San Francisco. Later Mayor Boyle introduced the legislation to the Mayors and Managers Association where it was immediately passed and he was invited by President Clinton to address a panel studying the subject in Washington, DC.

=== Contemporary anti-sweatshop movement ===
With the rise of [[globalization]] and [[transnational corporations]] (TNCs) such as [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] or [[Gap Inc.|Gap]], many sweatshop laborers have lost autonomy and corporations have gained in their invincibility to anti-sweatshop laws within a particular country, as it is incredibly easy for them to simply move to another country if the laws become too restricting.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Armbruster-Sandoval, Ralph. "Workers of the world unite? The contemporary anti-sweatshop movement and the struggle for social justice in the Americas." ''Work and Occupations'' 32.4 (2005): 464-485.&lt;/ref&gt;  As corporations globalize, many sweatshop movements have begun to see "worker internationalization" as one of the only viable solution; however, this requires strong labor movements, sufficient resources, and a commitment to mobilizing all workers, including women, which can be difficult to do at an international scale, as has been the case in the Americas.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Criticisms of sweatshops ==
The criticisms of sweatshops, and thus the reason for an anti-sweatshop movement, deal largely with the lack of safety regulations in sweatshops and their exploitive nature.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Zwolinski, Matt. “Sweatshops, Choice, and Exploitation”. ''Business Ethics Quarterly'' 17.4 (2007): 689–727. Web...&lt;/ref&gt;  Matt Zwolinski argues that though technically sweatshop laborers "choose" to work in sweatshops, this decision is not "fully voluntary" and that though sweatshops may provide opportunities that would not otherwise exist, when a worker "consents" to work in a sweatshop, they are also consenting to labor practices that overall cause more harm than good to the laborer.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Yet another criticism of sweatshops is the prevalence of child labor working heavy machinery for very low wages, often requiring that they be taken out of school, and thus disrupt their education, and exposing them to very dangerous working conditions that can endanger their health.&lt;ref&gt;Hartman, Laura Pincus, and Denis Gordon Arnold. "Worker rights and low wage industrialization: How to avoid sweatshops." ''Human Rights Quarterly''28.3 (2006): 676-700.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects ==
A study published in 2011 found that while in most cases anti-sweatshop movements did not affect sales for companies using sweatshops, they did correspond with a decrease in the sales of well-known, more specialized brands and more intense movements caused more significant reduction in the sales.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Bartley, Tim, and Curtis Child. “Movements, Markets and Fields: The Effects of Anti-sweatshop Campaigns on U.S. Firms, 1993-2000”. ''Social Forces'' 90.2 (2011): 425–451. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;  The same study also found that anti-sweatshop events also seemed to correspond with lower stock prices for the companies that were the target of these events, though some major anti-sweatshop events such the ''Kaksy'' lawsuit against Nike, did not result in any discernible change in stock price of the targeted company.  The study found that 64.1% of the companies targeted by anti-sweatshop movements saw drops in stock price in the five days following the anti-sweatshop event, and 56.4% saw drops in the two days following the event.  Though the study did find these slight negative economic effects, it did not find that, when taking into account companies of all reputations, anti-sweatshop movements or events damaged the reputation of the companies they targeted to a statistically significant degree; however, there does seem to be a slight undercutting of the reputations of companies with positive reputations when they are faced with anti-sweatshop campaigns, particularly intense ones.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Criticisms ==

=== Sweatshops offer opportunities that might otherwise not exist ===
Some people such as Pulitzer Prize winning journalist [[Nicholas Kristof]]f argue that the anti-sweatshop movement "risks harming the very people it is aiming to help"&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web
| url = https://www.nytimes.com/library/magazine/home/20000924mag-sweatshops.html
| title = Two Cheers for Sweatshops
| website = www.nytimes.com
| access-date = 2016-02-26
}}&lt;/ref&gt; because sweatshops signify the start of an industrial revolution in Asia and offer people a path towards making money and escaping poverty that would otherwise not be available to them.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  The anti-sweatshop movement, in this view, can harm the impoverished workers by increasing labor costs for factories which, in turn, can incentivize turning to technology instead of people for labor and thus reduce the number of employees needed.  Additionally, if anti-sweatshop movements succeed and manage to get stricter guidelines passed, companies may move to countries with less strict laws governing sweatshops, thus removing a source of jobs and money for impoverished countries.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Increasing regulations or wages would increase unemployment ===
Even if a company does not move to another country to find somewhere with more relaxed labor laws, economic demand theory says that the more a good costs, the less the demand for it is.  Because of this, it is possible to argue, as some economists have, that even though the labor is "exploitative," it should be permitted, as trying to put regulations on sweatshop labor would only result in sweatshops needing fewer workers, thus reducing opportunities for individuals to make a living.&lt;ref&gt;Powell, Benjamin, and Matt Zwolinski. "The ethical and economic case against sweatshop labor: A critical assessment." ''Journal of business ethics''107.4 (2012): 449-472.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Not all economists support sweatshops ===
Most economists say that sweatshops can be a benefit to Third World workers and the anti-sweatshop movement could reduce Third World employment and investment. The economic ways to think about this issue, employers and employees can both get benefits when they voluntarily sign the contract, no matter how low the wages are from the external’s point of view. An economist pointed out “as simple as this: ‘Either you believe labor demand curves are downward sloping, or you don’t,’ as a neoclassical colleague said to me. Of course, not to believe that demand curves are negatively sloped would be tantamount to declaring yourself an economic illiterate”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Miller|first1=John|title=Why Economists Are Wrong About Sweatshops and the Antisweatshop Movement|date=2003|pages=93–122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Related reality TV show ==
''Sweatshop Deadly Fashion'' is a Norwegian reality TV show about three fashion bloggers investigating the sweatshop issue in the fashion industry. The three glamorous fashion bloggers, Frida, Ludvig and Anniken, gave up their glam-life in Norway and went to Phnom Penh, Cambodia for a month to see the reality of the conditions of people who make their clothes. The journey begins to question the poor standards of the working conditions that keep up with the massive manufacturing of clothing for people stay trendy. ''Sweatshop Deadly Fashion'' was released in ten minute episodes online on 19 January 2015. The show raises an awareness on the current issue of sweatshops in the clothing industry through advocacy from famous people in the fashion industry such as fashion bloggers.

'''The Armed Forces Act 2006''' (c 52) is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]].

It came into force on 31 October 2006. It replaces the three separate Service Discipline Acts (the [[Army Act 1955]], the [[Air Force Act 1955]] and the [[Naval Discipline Act 1957]]) as the system of [[military law]] under which the [[British Armed Forces]] operate. The Armed Forces Act harmonizes service law between the three armed services.  One motivating factor behind the changes in the legislation combining discipline acts across the armed forces is the trend towards tri-service operations and defence organizations.

The Act also granted a symbolic [[pardon]] to soldiers controversially executed for cowardice and other offences during the [[First World War]].

== Key changes introduced by the Act ==

Key areas of change includes: 

* [[Military Courts of the United Kingdom#Summary hearing by Commanding Officer|Summary Discipline]]: Summary hearing and the role of the [[Commanding Officer]] is retained at the heart of Service discipline and is the mechanism by which most offences are dealt.  Summary offences and powers are harmonised across the Services. There is a reduction in the number of offences and sentencing powers available to Commanding Officers of the [[Royal Navy]] and an increase in those available to [[British Army]] and [[Royal Air Force]] Commanding Officers as powers of punishment are harmonised. 
*[[Service Prosecuting Authority]]:  A single Service Prosecuting Authority, staffed by lawyers from all three Services, has been created. The role of the SPA is unchanged in that it will determine whether to prosecute an accused under Service law and will conduct the prosecution case at most Courts Martial. 
* The [[Military Courts of the United Kingdom#Court Martial|Court Martial]]: Courts Martial remain the means of dealing with the most serious offences. A standing Court Martial has been introduced comprising a Judge Advocate and a minimum of 3 or 5 Service members depending on the seriousness of the offence. In order to harmonise with the other Services, the Royal Navy introduced the unqualified right for all personnel to elect for trial by Court Martial regardless of the seriousness of the offence.

==Offences in the Act==

{{main|Offences against military law in the United Kingdom}}

The Act sets out offences against service law and the associated punishments. The offences fall into two main categories:
* discipline offences, which can only be committed by members of the armed forces or, in a few cases, by a [[civilian subject to service discipline]]
* criminal conduct offences, which are acts done anywhere in the world which, if done in [[England and Wales]], would be against the civilian [[criminal law]].

==Pardon==
The mass pardon of 306 [[British Empire]] soldiers executed for certain offences during the [[World War I|Great War]] was enacted in section 359 of the Act, which came into effect on royal assent. This number included three from New Zealand, twenty three from Canada, two from the West Indies, two from Ghana and one each from Sierra Leone, Egypt and Nigeria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/pb/search/story.cfm|title=NZ Herald: New Zealand's Latest News, Business, Sport, Weather, Entertainment, Politics|website=NZ Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tom Watson (Labour politician)|Tom Watson]], then [[Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State]] at the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]], was instrumental in including this in the Act.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/oct/28/world.military&lt;/ref&gt; He was said to have acted having met the relatives of Private [[Harry Farr]], who was executed during the Great War despite strong evidence that he was suffering shellshock.&lt;ref&gt;S.Walker Forgotten Soldiers Gill and MacMillan 2007 {{ISBN|978-0-7171-4182-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However section 359(4) states that the pardon "does not affect any conviction or sentence." Since the nature of a [[pardon]] is normally to commute a sentence, [[Gerald Howarth]] MP asked during parliamentary debate: "we are entitled to ask what it does do."&lt;ref&gt;Hansard, House of Commons, 7 November 2006, col. 772&lt;/ref&gt; It would appear to be a symbolic pardon only, and some members of Parliament had called for the convictions to be quashed, although the pardon has still been welcomed by relatives of executed soldiers.

'''Articuli Podmanickyani''' is a document issued by the bishop of Nyitra (now [[Nitra]], [[Slovakia]]) and [[Zagreb]], advisor of king [[Vladislaus II of Bohemia and Hungary|Vladislaus II]] and landlord of [[Považský hrad]] (Hungarian: Vágbeszterce vára) [[Podmanitzky family|János Podmanitzky]]. It was a document officially stating the relationship between landlords and villains in the town in the medieval [[Upper Hungary]] (today mostly [[Slovakia]]). While establishing ‘’new’’ orders, the document indirectly shows conditions of accustomed life before Articuli. Another important feature of the document is that shortly afterwards [[Podmanitzky family|János Podmanitzky]] published it in [[Latin]]; he also translated it to [[Slovak language|Slovak]], what was in those times very rare.

== Document ==

#It is appointed that all the arable lands of the town should be divided into 52 povrazec (Latin: funis, medieval measure unit, it equals 30&amp;nbsp;cm, in modern square measures such piece of land would have area of 15-30 ha), and not more. In the town there should be 52 houses lived by more august commons, among those 52 povrazec of land should be divided.
The row of these houses permitted to own land started from the house of blacksmith Pavol Masak, on Hlinik Street, at that time. From the opposite site of the brook [[Považská Bystrica|Bystrica]] (Vágbeszterce), it was bounded by Petrik’s house. Then it continued on the different side from merchant Baltazar’s, which was near the street, which led to haj nearby forest embanked Skala’s house, then it curved around bath up to the river.  Next segment of land was between Kral’s and Uhlik’s house.  That was it 52 houses with surrounding lands, to each one povrazec was assigned.  &lt;br /&gt;Landlord cannot in any case take land belonging to these houses.
If anyone is willing to sell his house, among the residents of these houses, the house must be sold with land and with suitable prize. If the one who want to sell the house and the buyer cannot agree on prize, mayor or town’s assembly should decide on prize.
#Mayor and burgesses should be voted from these 52 houses.
#Because also in the past tax was paid from 52 houses (povrazov), also from now it will be paid from 52 houses.
#That there will be a mayor and burgesses who will govern the community with their own conscience and belief and not the community who will govern them.
#If anyone wants to build a house, either from those 52 houses, or from those settle on lands. The ones having the land should bring those who want to build suitable wood for construction, and ones living in gardens should for it help with building.
Building should be allowed to everyone.
#No one else that those 52 have the right to pull beer, and sell wine. There is only one vinery, with exception of annual market.
Selling of the wine is passed from one to other.
If anyone wants to start selling wine, mayor with assembly should be called, so that that could decide on the prize of the product, and everyone who will sell the product will save quarter zlaty (medieval currency in that time) for the town’s budget.
If there is anyone poor, who cannot sell wine, his annual right might be sold for quarter zlaty.
#No one from the mentioned ones can sell and brew beer. Always at most five commons can sell beer at one time, with exception of annual market.
In time of market, and time two weeks before and afterwards, every commoner have the right to sell wine and beer. Selling of beer, as selling of wine is passed from one to another.
If any commoner had brewed beer, during the inspection by mayor and burgesses would decide on an amount of malt spent for manufacture for one zlaty and according to this an amount of first class beer, for which one zlaty is paid is set, so that the one who brewed the beer will have his money back.
For the selling of first class beer one quarter of zlaty goes to town. Second class beer should be sold for lesser prize, lowest quality beer can have brewer for one’s own purposes. Anytime one boils beer, two water cans should be brought to teachers at school. If anyone cannot brew beer, the right of order might be sold for quarter zlaty. No one can sell either wine or beer on loan.
#When butcher kills livestock, mayor and two members of burgesses should assure that it will be killed and processed according to the rules of this craft.
After it is killed, the intestines must be taken out and the skin taken of. It should be divided from its head and legs. Only after this it can be put to measure the weight. When the prize for one Libra is decided, mayor and assembly members have the right to take the intestines. 
Tongue should be left for children in school. If someone does not want to give tongue, meat for the prize of it must be given to school.
#No one can borrow money from town’s budget; neither the money can be spent by burgesses. Money should be each year accumulated so that town has every time some money left, because one sixth of this money goes to people that the town should honor. (Noble man, landlord).
If those who have the right to manage the town’s money will spend more than one sixth of the budget, they should be deprived of confidence and dignity. They should be also physically punished as thieves. &lt;br /&gt;If anyone wants to invest some money of the town’s budget, mayor should agree, but with good guarantee and condition, that money will return in year, with something from the income. &lt;br /&gt;Everything must be settled openly under the supervision mayor and burgesses.
#No one can play dice from commons and burgesses, with exception of landlord’s servants, and nobles billeted in the town.
#Bather, who knew how to do bloodletting (Physicians in the Middle Ages believed that most human illnesses were the result of excess fluid in the body (called humour). The cure was removing excess fluid by taking large amounts of blood out of the body. Two of the main methods of bloodletting were leeching and venesection.), has to pay annual tax of one zlaty for baths. &lt;br /&gt;For one bloodletting he was to be given four denar (zlaty had 100 denars), for one venesection (direct opening of vein) he should be given one Vienna denar, for one bathing one denar, and for bathing of woman one obulus.
Each family living in the town has to give one cart-load of logs. Afterwards they would gain free access to bath for whole year. If anything will get damaged in the bath, town would pay for restoration.
#Each person living in the town, have to help for four days a year with hardening of the bank of the river Vah (Vág), so that it would cause floods in the town.
#It is appointed that none of the citizens take appeal to the court in Krupina (Korpona) (there was a court to which anyone from inhabitants of either [[Považská Bystrica|Bystrica]] or [[Žilina]] (Zsolna) could take appeal), with exception of death penalties and cases connected with persons dignity. Also no one should take appeal if his case was not decided yet in the county with supervision of landlord.
#No one who lives on the field has to pay tax.
#Anyone can bake bread, with condition that dough would have the same weight adequate for one denar.
#Because anyone in Zilina (Zsolna) or in [[Rajec]] has the right to build frame for sprawling of the cloth. Also inhabitants of [[Považská Bystrica|Bystrica]] have the right to build it anywhere where it seems convenient to them.
#Street of clothers should be the one near the church. Residence of blacksmiths should be on the street leading from Moštenec, bootmakers should gather on street leading from Hlinik. Because [[Považská Bystrica|Bystrica]] has the same rights as [[Žilina]] (Zsolna) and Rajec, clothers and the others may be grouped into guilds.
#Ones living on fields (lat. Inquilinus) have to be able to serve the landlord for three days a year.
#On the opposite side of the river no one can catch rabbits or birds.
#People living in the town are allowed to catch  fish with nets called sak and veter.
#Ones who live in [[Považská Bystrica|Bystrica]] do not have to pay taxes to their landlord, with exception of those who transport wine to [[Bytča]] (Nagybiccse) and [[Žilina]] (Zsolna). In time of market no one pays any tax.
#“King’s lunch” which the commoners had to give to landlord, is no longer inevitable to be given to landlord.
#Manor Hrbotin is in possession of the town.
#People from [[Považská Bystrica|Bystrica]] from now on do not have to plough and do some other works for the castle, with exception of stacking wine bottles in the castle, mowing of meadows in Zakvasov, and works on repairing of the bridge.
#Ones living on the field should give only 10 denars, and nothing else to the town annually.

Landlord of Vágbeszterce ([[Považská Bystrica]]) has adopted the document and inhabitants of Bystrica have committed to keep these rules precisely. As thanks to their landlord, that he has settled the rules so clearly, inhabitants have committed to give annually to the landlord and his heirs 100 zlaty, 100 gbel (gbel is a medieval measure unit, 1gbel = 84 litres) and 50 death roosters. Ones living on fields have to give two dead roosters. If anyone would not respect these rules, especially those concerning wine and beer, person should be deprived of dignity and cannot become the member of burgesses. If anyone would break other rules, person has to pay half zlaty from which a half goes to landlord and a half to church.

'''Banasura Hill Resort''' is a nature resort in [[Wayanad District]] of [[North Kerala]], [[India]]; located {{convert|37|km|mi}} away from [[Kalpetta]], the district headquarters. It stands at an altitude of {{convert|3200|ft|m}} above sea level on a {{convert|35|acre|ha}} plot amidst the mountains of the [[Western Ghats]] declared as one of the traditionally preserved sites in the world by UNESCO.
[[File:ENTRANCEBANASURA.jpg|thumb|The resort seen against the backdrop of the [[Banasura Hill]], from which it derives its name.]]

==Etymology==
The resort is so named because it is located at the foot of the [[Banasura Hill]] which is the second highest mountain in Wayanad that often attracts climbers to attempt to reach the summit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |df= 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides this, the [[Banasura Sagar Dam]], which lies just 18&amp;nbsp;km from the resort and shares its architectural antecedents also had an influence in naming the resort.

==Architecture==
The resort's architectural design follows a construction based on rammed earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The various living structures within the [[resort]] complex is constructed using mud excavated from the very site where it stands on. The main building has an area of nearly 20,000 square foot spread over two floors, and is made entirely out of mud, with a roof of bamboo and coconut palm fronds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==The idea behind Banasura==
[[File:RAMMEDCONSTRUCTION.jpg|right|thumb|Rammed earth architecture was used for construction.]]
A considerable amount of research went in before deciding on the type of architecture to be used in construction. "Earth" architecture was chosen because it would cause the least amount of ecological damage while blending harmoniously with the micro environment around the site. "Earth" (mud) that is used for construction can be recycled indefinitely or left to disintegrate without causing any environmental degradation.

Research also threw up striking examples of large earthen structures that had withstood the test of time and survived for centuries. The [[Great Mosque of Djenné]] in [[Mali]] built in 1907, the [[Rayen Castle|Citadel]] of Rayen in [[Iran]] built during the [[Parthia|Parthian rule]] (248 BC–224 AD); and the ancient city of [[Shibam]] in [[Yemen]] built in the 2nd century A.D are some such structures.

Inspired by these examples, [[rammed earth]] (or pise) was chosen as the architecture to be adopted for constructing the resort. This construction technique was developed in ancient China around 2,000 B.C and used predominantly to build protective walls around small settlements. The [[Great Wall of China]] is one of the best examples where rammed earth was used. Closer to the resort, the [[Banasura Sagar Dam]], which is [[India]]’s largest earthen dam, and the second largest in Asia, also prompted adoption of this eco-friendly design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |archivedate=8 August 2016 
 |df= 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Size and challenges==
[[File:CORRIDORBANASURA.jpg|right|thumb|The corridor inside the main building.]]
Fairly large single-storied earthen structures are common in different parts of the world, but building a two-storied structure of such enormous proportions as that of the main building at the resort, was quite a challenge. Since the building was designed without any concrete pillars, extra attention had to be paid to load bearing and load balancing aspects to ensure stability.

Climatic conditions are a major concern while building earthen structures.  Typically, earthen buildings are found in areas where the climate is dry and arid. Wayanad, where Banasura Hill Resort is located, has a tropical wet climate – also known as a [[tropical monsoon climate]] – with an annual average rainfall of well over 2,300mm. While the heavy monsoon rains are responsible for the tropical rain forests and the rich bio-diversity found in these parts, building a rammed colossal earth structure under such climatic conditions is a challenge. Despite this, construction of the main building was completed within 18 months.

==Indigenous sustainable architecture==
Banasura Hill Resort makes optimal use of environmental resources. As it is built using mud; the structures of the resort gel seamlessly with the natural surroundings. The design itself contributes actively to [[energy conservation]]. The thick earthen walls provide [[thermal insulation]], keeping the interiors cool during the day and warm and cozy during the night, obviating the need for air-conditioning. The ambience that the interiors of the earthen structures provide is one of cool comfort.

==Environmental conservation==

 |df= 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Banasura Hill Resort has taken measures to conserve the ecological balance of the place and preserve its natural heritage and biodiversity. For example, [[Guadua]] bamboo saplings have been planted in and around the resort to create a bio-fencing. Its environmental benefits include regulating water levels, absorbing huge amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, producing oxygen, preventing soil erosion and conserving bio diversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also planted in thousands are seedlings of the highly aromatic [[Vetiver grass]] whose cluster roots run vertically like a mesh to a depth of almost 5m, effectively preventing soil erosion and arresting water run-off. These measures help to conserve the [[ecological balance]] of the place and preserve its [[natural heritage]] and [[biodiversity]].

==Plantations at the resort==
The resort stands in the middle of a Tea estate&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

A '''blank cheque''' (US: '''blank check''') or '''carte blanche''', in the literal sense, is a [[cheque]] that has no monetary [[Value (mathematics)|value]] written in, but is already signed. In the figurative sense, it is used to describe a situation in which an agreement has been made that is open-ended or vague, and therefore subject to abuse, or in which a party is willing to consider any expense in the pursuance of their goals.

== Literal meaning ==
Cheque writers are advised to specify the amount of the cheque before signing it. A blank cheque can be extremely expensive for the drawer who writes the cheque, because whoever obtains the cheque could write in any amount of money, and might be able to cash it (if the [[Transaction account|current account]] (US: checking account) contains sufficient funds, and depending on the laws in the specific country). Under [[Law of the United States|American law]], a blank cheque is an example of an "{{visible anchor|incomplete instrument}}" as defined in the [[Uniform Commercial Code]]'s Article 3, Section 115 (a).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=§ 3-115. INCOMPLETE INSTRUMENT|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/3/3-115|website=Legal Information Institute|publisher=Cornell University Law School|accessdate=26 November 2016|language=en|date=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing an amount in a blank cheque, without the authority of the signer, is an "alteration".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=§ 3-407. ALTERATION.|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/3/3-407|website=Legal Information Institute|publisher=Cornell University Law School|accessdate=26 November 2016|language=en|date=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is legally equivalent to changing the numbers on a completed (non-blank) cheque.

In [[finance]], a "blank cheque company" refers to a company in development that has no specific business plan, such as a special purpose acquisition company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Blank Check Company|url=https://www.sec.gov/answers/blankcheck.htm|website=www.sec.gov|publisher=U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|accessdate=26 November 2016|date=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Metaphorical meaning==

===In politics: examples===
* On July 6,  1914, Germany gave Austria a "blank cheque" in handling its punishment of Serbia regarding the assassination of the heir to the Austrian throne. It led to the start of the First World War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Claudia Durst Johnson|author2=James H. Meredith|title=Understanding the Literature of World War I: A Student Casebook to Issues, Sources, and Historical Documents|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XysmARKSjNMC&amp;pg=PA13|year=2004|publisher=Greenwood |page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  German Chancellor [[Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg]] told [[László Szőgyény-Marich Jr.|the Austrian ambassador in Berlin]] that the Austrian Emperor had the support of the German Kaiser:
::Finally, as far as concerns Serbia, His Majesty, of course, cannot interfere in the dispute now going on between Austria- Hungary and that country, as it is a matter not within his competence. The Emperor Francis Joseph may, however, rest  assured that His Majesty will faithfully stand by Austria-Hungary, as is required by the obligations of his alliance and of his ancient friendship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Claudia Durst Johnson|author2=James H. Meredith|title=Understanding the Literature of World War I: A Student Casebook to Issues, Sources, and Historical Documents|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XysmARKSjNMC&amp;pg=PA13|year=2004|publisher=Greenwood |pages=13–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*In March 2003, [[Gordon Brown]], the British  [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], "effectively offered a blank cheque for war against Iraq", and would thus '"spend what it takes" to tackle Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Brown offers war 'blank cheque'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/2817965.stm|accessdate=26 November 2016|work=news.bbc.co.uk|publisher=BBC News|date=4 March 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In literature===
[[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]] used the term "[[wikt:carte blanche|carte blanche]]" in several of his [[Sherlock Holmes]] stories.

* ''[[A Scandal in Bohemia]]'':
{{quote|text=
"Then, as to money?"

"You have carte blanche."

"Absolutely?"

"I tell you that I would give one of the provinces of my kingdom to have that photograph."}}

* ''[[The Adventure of the Beryl Coronet]]'':
{{quote|text="I understand that you give me carte blanche to act for you, provided only that I get back the gems, and that you place no limit on the sum I may draw."

"I would give my fortune to have them back."}}

'''Broadwater Energy''' is a [[List of LNG terminals|Liquefied Natural Gas Terminal]] proposed to be built in [[Long Island Sound]] between [[New York State]] and [[Connecticut]]. The project has received vociferous objections from Connecticut officials and some New York state officials.

New York state officials had yet to decide whether to issue permits for the project as of March 2008, and Governor [[David Paterson]] said he might postpone a decision, originally scheduled to be made in April 2008 on whether to support the terminal.&lt;ref name=ap3218&gt;Associated Press article, "U.S. Commission Approves Gas Terminal in L.I. Sound", March 21, 2008, as it appeared in ''[[The New York Times]]'', p B4&lt;/ref&gt; The terminal received federal approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on March 21, 2008,&lt;ref name=ap3218/&gt; but energy analysts have said that state rather than regulators generally have the decisive role in deciding whether liquefied natural gas terminals may be built.&lt;ref name=nytjr1&gt;Rather, John, "Long Island Sound Proposal Awaits Crucial Ruling", ''[[The New York Times]]'', "Connecticut and the Region" section, page CT6, January 27, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

It is to be operated by Broadwater Energy L.L.C., a joint venture by [[TransCanada Corporation]] and [[Shell Oil]] for the transfer of [[liquefied natural gas]] from ships to pipelines. The proposed floating unit would be about nine miles (14&amp;nbsp;km) north of [[Wading River, New York]] and {{convert|10|mi|km}} south of [[New Haven, Connecticut]] -- the widest point in the Sound.  After being unloaded, the liquefied gas would be warmed back into a gas and pumped through pipelines (with the specific pipeline on the bottom of the sound called the "Iroquois Gas Transmission."  The company calls the term a "[[Floating production storage and offloading|Floating Storage Regasification Unit]]," or FSRU.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.broadwaterenergy.com/overview.html Broadwaterenergy.com Overview] Retrieved November 17, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  It is expected {{convert|1|Gcuft|m3}} of natural gas per day into the pipeline.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsday.com/news/local/ny-lisoun1007,0,6144118.story Rep. Shays 'ashamed' of his opposition to Broadwater plant] ''Newsday'' October 6, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The terminal would be about {{convert|1200|ft|m}} long and {{convert|180|ft|m}} wide and would rise about 75 to {{convert|80|ft|m}} above the water.  It would have the capability to stockpile eight billion cubic feet of gas.  The project also involves the laying of a {{convert|22|mi|km|sing=on}} long pipeline from the platform to the Iroquois line (off the shore the village of [[Nissequogue, New York]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.broadwaterenergy.com/pdf/Overview_Map.pdf Broadwater map] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061127162119/http://www.broadwaterenergy.com/pdf/Overview_Map.pdf |date=November 27, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Broadwater's website notes advantages to consumers of cutting the cost of natural gas, cleaner fuel than oil, and the lack requirements to build onshore.

The State of New York which has territorial jurisdiction over the sound will have ultimate decisions on whether it will permit the project.  Broadwater says on its website the project if built on plan between 2009 and 2010 would cost $20 million directly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.broadwaterenergy.com/economic_benefits.html Economic Overview] Broadwater Energy&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opposition==
The project, which will be located off the coast of expensive residential property on eastern Long Island and eastern Connecticut, has stirred considerable local opposition including New York Senators, [[Charles E. Schumer]] and [[Hillary Clinton]], and Representative [[Tim Bishop]].  Clinton said:

:I, like many Long Islanders, remain concerned that the security risks and environmental threats posed by the project have not been properly addressed. I also share the view held by many Long Islanders that this project would have detrimental impacts on the quality of water and air surrounding the sound.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.senate.gov/~clinton/news/statements/record.cfm?id=269045 "Senator Clinton Reiterates Opposition to the Broadwater Project"]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} February 9, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the controversiesis concern that legislation may pass that would permit the [[Federal Energy Regulatory Commission]] to override local opposition.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/03/nyregion/nyregionspecial2/03ligas.html?pagewanted=3 "Beset by Opposition, Broadwater Bets on Washington and Time"] ''New York Times'' July 3, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

New York Governor [[Eliot Spitzer]], who resigned from office in March 2008 and was replaced by David Paterson, took no position on the project but raised eyebrows in November 2007 when he hired Bruce Gyory, a Broadwater lobbyist, to advise the governor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsday.com/news/local/state/ny-stspit025442615nov02,0,7161903.story "Spitzer picks Broadwater lobbyist as top adviser"] ''Newsday'' November 2, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decision==
On April 10, 2008, Governor Paterson rejects the Broadwater plan, stating at a Press Conference at Sunken Meadow State Park that it "Is not what Long Island Sound needs." Broadwater however does have the right to appeal to the US Department of Commerce.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rpalumni.org/nolng/index.htm Anti-Broadwater Coalition] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080501075459/http://www.rpalumni.org/nolng/index.htm |date=May 1, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Capitulations of the Ottoman Empire''' were contracts between the [[Ottoman Empire]] and [[Europe]]an powers, particularly [[France]]. Turkish [[capitulation (treaty)|capitulation]]s, or [[ahdname]]s, were generally bilateral acts whereby definite arrangements were entered into by each contracting party towards the other, not mere concessions.&lt;ref&gt;As regards technical distinctions, an agreement, an exchange of notes, or a convention properly applies to one specific subject; whereas a treaty usually comprises several matters, whether commercial or political.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Turkish Capitulations were grants made by successive [[Ottoman Dynasty|Sultans]] to [[Christendom|Christian nation]]s, conferring rights and privileges in favour of their subjects resident or trading in the Ottoman dominions, following the policy towards European states of the [[Byzantine Empire]].

According to these capitulations traders entering the Ottoman Empire were exempt from local prosecution, local taxation, local conscription, and the searching of their domicile. 

The capitulations were initially made during the Ottoman Empire's military dominance, to entice and encourage commercial exchange with Western merchants. They were however increasingly exploited after military dominance shifted to Europe, allowing significant economic and political abuse by European powers.&lt;ref name=Bunton&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cleveland|first1=William|last2=Bunton|first2=Martin|title=A History of the Modern Middle East|date=2009|publisher=Westview Press|isbn=978-0-8133-4374-7|page=50|edition=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In the first instance capitulations were granted separately to each Christian state, beginning with the [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] in 1453, which entered into peaceful relations with the Ottoman Empire. Afterwards new capitulations were obtained which summed up in one document earlier concessions, and added to them in general terms whatever had been conceded to one or more other states; a stipulation which became a [[Most Favored Nation#History|most favored nation]] article.

Around 1535 a capitulation was made by [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] regarding [[France]].

France signed its first treaty of ''Capitulations'' with the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk Sultanate]] in [[Cairo]] in 1500, during the rule of [[Louis XII]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=cq90z2Ij6jsC&amp;pg=PA139 ''Three years in Constantinople'' by Charles White p.139]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=cq90z2Ij6jsC&amp;pg=PA147 ''Three years in Constantinople'' by Charles White p.147]&lt;/ref&gt; After the Turks conquered Egypt in the [[Ottoman–Mamluk War (1516–1517)]], the Ottomans upheld the capitulations to the French and applied them to the entire empire.

==Status==
Capitulations signified that which was arranged under distinct headings; the [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]] phrase was ''ahid nameh'', whereas a "treaty" was ''mouahed''. The latter did, and the former did not, signify a reciprocal engagement.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}
 
According to Capitulations, and treaties confirmatory of them, made between the [[Ottoman Porte|Porte]] and other states, foreigners resident in Turkey were subject to the laws of their respective countries.

Thus, although the Turkish capitulations were not in themselves treaties, yet by subsequent confirmation they acquired the force of commercial durable instead of personal nature; the conversion of permissive into perfect rights; questions as to contraband and neutral trade stated in definite terms.

==Abolition==
In 1914, the [[Committee of Union and Progress]] abolished the capitulations in the Ottoman Empire and introduced economic policies that would benefit the Ottoman economy. 

As far as Turkey is concerned, the capitulations were abolished by the [[Treaty of Lausanne]] (1923), specifically by Article 28:

{{quote|Each of the High Contracting Parties hereby accepts, in so far as it is concerned, the complete abolition of the Capitulations in Turkey in every respect.&lt;ref&gt;In addition to Turkey, the [[British Empire]], [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Japan]], [[Greece]], [[Romania]] and the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] were parties to the Treaty.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Capitulations in [[Egypt]] ended in 1949 as stipulated in the [[Montreux Convention Regarding the Abolition of the Capitulations in Egypt]] in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/other/dfat/treaties/1938/11.html Convention regarding the Abolition of the Capitulations in Egypt, Protocol, and Declaration by the Royal Egyptian Government]'' (Montreux, 8 May 1936) Art 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Commencement of action''' is the formal procedure by which [[legal proceedings]] are initiated.  Commencement of civil lawsuits begins when the [[plaintiff]] files the [[complaint]] with the court.  Criminal proceedings are typically commenced by a government [[prosecutor]].  In many U.S. jurisdictions, depending on the rules, prosecutors may have the option to commence a criminal action by filing the [[petition]] directly with the court or by seeking an [[indictment]] from a [[grand jury]].

{{conscription}}
'''Conscription''', sometimes called '''the draft''', is the compulsory enlistment of people in a [[national service]], most often a [[military service]].&lt;ref name="mw"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/conscription |title=Conscription |publisher= Merriam-Webster Online }}&lt;/ref&gt; Conscription dates back to antiquity and continues in some countries to the present day under various names. The modern system of near-universal national conscription for young men dates to the [[French Revolution]] in the 1790s, where it became the basis of a very large and powerful [[military]]. Most [[Europe]]an nations later copied the system in peacetime, so that men at a certain age would serve 1–8 years on [[active duty]] and then transfer to the [[military reserve force|reserve force]].

Conscription is controversial for a range of reasons, including [[conscientious objection]] to military engagements on religious or philosophical grounds; political objection, for example to service for a disliked government or unpopular war; and ideological objection, for example, to a perceived violation of individual rights. Those conscripted may evade service, sometimes by leaving the country,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://archives.cbc.ca/war_conflict/vietnam_war/topics/348/ |title=Seeking Sanctuary: Draft Dodgers |newspaper= CBC Digital Archives }}&lt;/ref&gt; and seeking [[Right of asylum|asylum]] in another country. Some selection systems accommodate these attitudes by providing [[alternative service]] outside [[combat]]-operations roles or even outside the military, such as 'Siviilipalvelus' (alternative civil service) in Finland, [[Zivildienst]] (compulsory community service) in [[Austria]] and [[Switzerland]]. Many post-Soviet countries conscript male soldiers not only for armed forces but also for paramilitary organizations which are dedicated to [[police]]-like ''domestic only'' service ([[Internal Troops]]) or ''non-[[combat]]'' [[rescue|rescue duties]] ([[Civil defence|Civil defence troops]]) – none of which is considered alternative to the military conscription.

As of the early 21st century, many states no longer conscript soldiers, relying instead upon professional militaries with [[volunteer military|volunteers]] enlisted to meet the demand for troops. The ability to rely on such an arrangement, however, presupposes some degree of predictability with regard to both war-fighting requirements and the scope of hostilities. Many states that have abolished conscription therefore still reserve the power to resume it during [[war]]time or times of crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/second-world-war-wwii/ &lt;!--Bot repaired link--&gt; |title=World War II |publisher=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; States involved in wars or interstate rivalries are most likely to implement conscription, whereas democracies are less likely than autocracies to implement conscription.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Asal|first=Victor|last2=Conrad|first2=Justin|last3=Toronto|first3=Nathan|date=2017-08-01|title=I Want You!

==History==

===In pre-modern times===

====Ilkum====
Around the reign of [[Hammurabi]] (1791–1750 [[Before Christ|BC]]), the [[Babylonian Empire]] used a system of conscription called ''Ilkum''. Under that system those eligible were required to serve in the royal army in time of war. During times of peace they were instead required to provide labour for other activities of the state. In return for this service, people subject to it gained the right to hold land. It is possible that this right was not to hold land ''per se'' but specific land supplied by the state.&lt;ref name=JN242&gt;{{Cite book |title=Early Mesopotamia Society and Economy at the Dawn of History |last=Postgate |first=J.N. |authorlink= |year=1992 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0-415-11032-7 |page=242}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various forms of avoiding military service are recorded. While it was outlawed by the [[Code of Hammurabi]], the hiring of substitutes appears to have been practiced both before and after the creation of the code. Later records show that Ilkum commitments could become regularly traded. In other places, people simply left their towns to avoid their Ilkum service. Another option was to sell Ilkum lands and the commitments along with them. With the exception of a few exempted classes, this was forbidden by the Code of Hammurabi.&lt;ref name=JN243&gt;{{Cite book |title=Early Mesopotamia Society and Economy at the Dawn of History |last=Postgate |first=J.N. |authorlink= |year=1992 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0-415-11032-7 |page=243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Medieval levies====
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2010}}

In medieval [[Scandinavia]] the ''leiðangr'' ([[Old Norse language|Old Norse]]), ''leidang'' ([[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]), ''leding'', ([[Danish language|Danish]]), ''ledung'' ([[Swedish language|Swedish]]), ''lichting'' ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]), ''expeditio'' ([[Latin]]) or sometimes ''leþing'' ([[English language|Old English]]), was a levy of free farmers conscripted into coastal fleets for seasonal excursions and in defence of the realm.

The bulk of the [[History of Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxon English]] army, called the ''[[fyrd]]'', was composed of part-time English soldiers drawn from the freemen of each county. In the 690s Laws of [[Ine of Wessex|Ine]], three levels of fines are imposed on different social classes for neglecting military service.&lt;ref&gt;Attenborough ''Laws of the Earliest English Kings'' https://archive.org/stream/lawsofearliesten00grea#page/52
&lt;/ref&gt; Some modern writers claim military service was restricted to the landowning minor nobility. These [[thegn]]s were the land-holding aristocracy of the time and were required to serve with their own armour and weapons for a certain number of days each year. The historian David Sturdy has cautioned about regarding the ''fyrd'' as a precursor to a modern national army composed of all ranks of society, describing it as a "ridiculous fantasy":&lt;blockquote&gt;The persistent old belief that peasants and small farmers gathered to form a national army or ''fyrd'' is a strange delusion dreamt up by antiquarians in the late eighteenth or early nineteenth centuries to justify universal military conscription.&lt;ref&gt;Sturdy, David ''Alfred the Great'' Constable (1995), p. 153&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Medieval levy in Poland was known as the ''[[pospolite ruszenie]]''.

====Military slavery====
[[File:Battle of Vienna.SultanMurads with janissaries.jpg|thumb|Ottoman [[Janissary|janissaries]]]]

The system of military [[slaves]] was widely used in the Middle East, beginning with the creation of the corps of [[Turkic peoples|Turkish]] slave-soldiers (''[[ghulam]]s'' or ''[[mamluk]]s'') by the [[Abbasid caliph]] [[al-Mu'tasim]] in the 820s and 830s. The Turkish troops soon came to [[Anarchy at Samarra|dominate the government]], establishing a pattern throughout the Islamic world of a ruling military class, often separated by ethnicity, culture and even religion by the mass of the population, a paradigm that found its apogee in the [[Mamluks of Egypt]] and the [[Janissary]] corps of the [[Ottoman Empire]], institutions that survived until the early 19th century.

In the middle of the 14th century, Ottoman Sultan [[Murad I]] developed personal troops to be loyal to him, with a slave army called the ''[[Kapıkulu]]''. The new force was built by taking Christian children from newly conquered lands, especially from the far areas of his empire, in a system known as the ''[[devşirme]]'' (translated "gathering" or "converting"). The captive children were forced to convert to [[Islam]]. The Sultans [[Military use of children|had the young boys trained]] over several years. Those who showed special promise in fighting skills were trained in advanced warrior skills, put into the sultan's personal service, and turned into the [[Janissary|Janissaries]], the elite branch of the ''Kapıkulu''. A number of distinguished military commanders of the Ottomans, and most of the imperial administrators and upper-level officials of the Empire, such as [[Pargalı İbrahim Pasha]] and [[Sokollu Mehmet Paşa]], were recruited in this way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/med/lewis1.html |author=Bernard Lewis |title=Race and Slavery in the Middle East |publisher= Chapter readings for class at Fordham University }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1609, the Sultan's ''Kapıkulu'' forces increased to about 100,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://coursesa.matrix.msu.edu/~fisher/hst373/readings/inalcik6.html |title=In the Service of the State and Military Class }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In later years, Sultans turned to the [[Barbary Pirates]] to supply their Jannissaries corps. Their attacks on ships off the coast of Africa or in the Mediterranean, and subsequent capture of able-bodied men for ransom or sale provided some captives for the Sultan's system. Starting in the 17th century, Christian families living under the Ottoman rule began to submit their sons into the Kapikulu system willingly, as they saw this as a potentially invaluable career opportunity for their children. Eventually the Sultan turned to foreign volunteers from the warrior clans of [[Circassians]] in southern Russia to fill his Janissary armies. As a whole the system began to break down, the loyalty of the Jannissaries became increasingly suspect. [[Mahmud II]] forcibly disbanded the Janissary corps in 1826.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-300350/Janissary |title= Janissary corps, or Janizary, or Yeniçeri (Turkish military)|publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://i-cias.com/e.o/janissaries.htm|title=Janissaries – LookLex Encyclopaedia|author=Tore Kjeilen|work=i-cias.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar to the Janissaries in origin and means of development were the Mamluks of Egypt in the [[Middle Ages]]. The [[Mamluks]] were usually captive non-Muslim Iranian and Turkish children who had been kidnapped or bought as slaves from the Barbary coasts. The Egyptians assimilated and trained the boys and young men to become Islamic soldiers who served the Muslim [[caliph]]s and the [[Ayyubid]] sultans during the [[Middle Ages]]. The first mamluks served the [[Abbasid]] caliphs in 9th-century [[Baghdad]]. Over time they became a powerful military [[caste]]. On more than one occasion, they seized power, for example, ruling [[Egypt]] from 1250–1517.

From 1250 [[Egypt]] had been ruled by the [[Bahri dynasty]] of [[Kipchak people|Kipchak]] origin. Slaves from the [[Peoples of the Caucasus|Caucasus]] served in the army and formed an elite corp of troops. They eventually revolted in Egypt to form the [[Burgi dynasty]]. The Mamluks' excellent fighting abilities, massed Islamic armies, and overwhelming numbers succeeded in overcoming the Christian [[Crusades|Crusader]] fortresses in the Holy Land. The Mamluks were the most successful defense against the [[Ilkhanate|Mongol Ilkhanate]] of Persia and Iraq from entering Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sunnahonline.com/ilm/seerah/0075_popup11.htm |title=The Mamluk (Slave) Dynasty (Timeline) |newspaper=Sunnah Online }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the western coast of Africa, Berber Muslims captured non-Muslims to put to work as laborers. They generally converted the younger people to Islam and many became quite assimilated. In Morocco, the Berber looked south rather than north. The Moroccan Sultan [[Moulay Ismail]], called  "the Bloodthirsty" (1672–1727), employed a corps of 150,000 black slaves, called his [[Black Guard]]. He used them to coerce the country into submission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/med/lewis1.html |author=Lewis |title=Race and Slavery in the Middle East |publisher=Oxford University Press |year= 1994 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In modern times===
[[File:Branka 1863.JPG|thumb|left|Conscription of Poles to the Russian Army in 1863 (by [[Aleksander Sochaczewski]]).]]
{{see also|Remplacement}}
Modern conscription, the massed military enlistment of national citizens, was devised during the [[French Revolution]], to enable the [[French First Republic|Republic]] to defend itself from the attacks of European monarchies. Deputy [[Jean-Baptiste Jourdan]] gave its name to the 5 September 1798 Act, whose first article stated: "Any Frenchman is a soldier and owes himself to the defense of the nation."  It enabled the creation of the ''[[Grande Armée]]'', what [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]] called "the nation in arms", which overwhelmed European professional armies that often numbered only into the low tens of thousands. More than 2.6 million men were inducted into the French military in this way between the years 1800 and 1813.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Conscription |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761561714/conscription.html |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwRJ8b4l?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761561714/conscription.html |archivedate=2009-10-31 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The defeat of the [[Prussian Army]] in particular shocked the Prussian establishment, which had believed it was invincible after the victories of [[Frederick the Great]]. The Prussians were used to relying on superior organization and tactical factors such as order of battle to focus superior troops against inferior ones. Given approximately equivalent forces, as was generally the case with professional armies, these factors showed considerable importance. However, they became considerably less important when the Prussian armies faced forces that outnumbered their own in some cases by more than ten to one. [[Gerhard von Scharnhorst|Scharnhorst]] advocated adopting the ''[[levée en masse]]'', the military conscription used by France. The ''Krümpersystem'' was the beginning of short-term compulsory service in Prussia, as opposed to the long-term conscription previously used.&lt;ref&gt;Dierk Walter. ''Preussische Heeresreformen 1807–1870: Militärische Innovation und der Mythos der "Roonschen Reform"''. 2003, in Citino, p. 130&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Russian Empire]], the military service time "owed" by serfs was 25 years at the beginning of the 19th century. In 1834 it was decreased to 20 years. The recruits were to be not younger than 17 and not older than 35.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.roots-saknes.lv/Army/military_service_.htm |title=Military service in Russia Empire |publisher=roots-saknes.lv |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304072619/http://www.roots-saknes.lv/Army/military_service_.htm |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1874 Russia introduced universal conscription in the modern pattern, an innovation only made possible by the abolition of [[Serfdom in Russia|serfdom]] in 1861. New military law decreed that all male Russian subjects, when they reached the age of 20, were eligible to serve in the military for six years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.let.leidenuniv.nl/tcimo/tulp/Research/ARMING.htm |title=Conscription and Resistance: The Historical Context archived from the original |date=2008-06-03 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080603141235/http://www.let.leidenuniv.nl/tcimo/tulp/Research/ARMING.htm |archivedate=2008-06-03 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the decades prior to World War I universal conscription along broadly Prussian lines became the norm for European armies, and those modeled on them. By 1914 the only substantial armies still completely dependent on voluntary enlistment were those of Britain and the United States. Some colonial powers such as France reserved their conscript armies for home service while maintaining professional units for overseas duties.

====World Wars====
[[File:Young men registering for military conscription, New York City, June 5, 1917.jpg|thumb|Young men registering for conscription during [[World War I]], New York City, June 5, 1917.]]

The range of eligible ages for conscripting was expanded to meet national demand during the World Wars.
In the United States, the [[Selective Service System]] drafted men for World War I initially in an age range from 21 to 30 but expanded its eligibility in 1918 to an age range of 18 to 45.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.archives.gov/research/guide-fed-records/groups/163.html |title=Records of the Selective Service System (World War I) }}; see also [[Selective Service Act of 1917]] and [[Selective Training and Service Act of 1940]].&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of a widespread [[mobilization]] of forces where service includes homefront defense, ages of conscripts may range much higher, with the oldest conscripts serving in roles requiring lesser mobility. Expanded-age conscription was common during the Second World War: in Britain, it was commonly known as "call-up" and extended to age 51. [[Nazi Germany]] termed it ''[[Volkssturm]]'' ("People's Storm") and included children as young as 16 and men as old as 60.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lonesentry.com/articles/volkssturm/index.html |title=The German Volkssturm from Intelligence Bulletin |date = February 1945|publisher=lonesentry.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Second World War, both Britain and the Soviet Union conscripted women. The United States was on the verge of drafting women into the Nurse Corps because it anticipated it would need the extra personnel for its planned invasion of Japan. However, the Japanese surrendered and the idea was abandoned.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/military-international/ |work=[[CBC News]] |title=CBC News Indepth: International military |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130518040804/http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/military-international/ |archivedate=18 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Involuntary servitude===
[[American libertarian]]s oppose conscription and call for the abolition of the [[Selective Service System]], believing that impressment of individuals into the armed forces is "[[involuntary servitude]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dehnbase.org/lpus/library/platform/catm.html|title=Conscription And The Military|work=Libertarian Party|publisher=www.dehnbase.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ron Paul]], a former presidential nominee of the U.S. [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]] has said that conscription "is wrongly associated with [[patriotism]], when it really represents slavery and involuntary servitude."&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Representative [[Ron Paul]] [http://antiwar.com/paul/?articleid=5651 Conscription Is Slavery], antiwar.com, January 14, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; The philosopher [[Ayn Rand]] opposed conscription, suggesting that "of all the statist violations of individual rights in a mixed economy, the military draft is the worst. It is an abrogation of rights. It negates man's fundamental right—the right to life—and establishes the fundamental principle of statism: that a man's life belongs to the state, and the state may claim it by compelling him to sacrifice it in battle."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/draft.html|title=Draft|work=aynrandlexicon.com|accessdate=15 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1917, a number of radicals and anarchists, including [[Emma Goldman]], challenged the new draft law in federal court arguing that it was a direct violation of the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]]'s prohibition against slavery and involuntary servitude. However, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] unanimously upheld the constitutionality of the draft act in the case of ''[[Arver v. United States]]'' on 7 January 1918. The decision said the [[Constitution of the United States|Constitution]] gave [[United States Congress|Congress]] the power to [[declare war]] and to raise and support armies. The Court emphasized the principle of the reciprocal rights and duties of citizens:
:"It may not be doubted that the very conception of a just government in its duty to the citizen includes the reciprocal obligation of the citizen to render military service in case of need and the right to compel."&lt;ref&gt;John Whiteclay Chambers II, ''To Raise an Army: The Draft Comes to Modern America'' (1987) pp. 219–20&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic===
It can be argued that in a [[benefit–cost ratio|cost-to-benefit ratio]], conscription during peace time is not worthwhile.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, David R. "[http://econjwatch.org/issues/volume-2-issue-2-august-2005 The Role of Economists in Ending the Draft]" (August 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; Months or years of service performed by the most fit and capable subtract from the productivity of the economy; add to this the cost of training them, and in some countries paying them. Compared to these extensive costs, some would argue there is very little benefit; if there ever was a war then conscription and basic training could be completed quickly, and in any case there is little threat of a war in most countries with conscription. In the United States, every male resident is required by law to register with the [[Selective Service System]] within 30 days following his 18th birthday and be available for a draft; this is often accomplished automatically by a motor vehicle department during licensing or by voter registration).

The cost of conscription can be related to the [[parable of the broken window]] in anti-draft arguments. The cost of the work, military service, does not disappear even if no salary is paid. The work effort of the conscripts is effectively wasted, as an unwilling workforce is extremely inefficient. The impact is especially severe in wartime, when civilian professionals are forced to fight as amateur soldiers. Not only is the work effort of the conscripts wasted and productivity lost, but professionally skilled conscripts are also difficult to replace in the civilian workforce. Every soldier conscripted in the army is taken away from his civilian work, and away from contributing to the economy which funds the military. This may be less a problem in an agrarian or pre-industrialized state where the level of education is generally low, and where a worker is easily replaced by another. However, this is potentially more costly in a [[post-industrial society]] where educational levels are high and where the workforce is sophisticated and a replacement for a conscripted specialist is difficult to find. Even direr economic consequences result if the professional conscripted as an amateur soldier is killed or maimed for life; his work effort and productivity are lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=2136&amp;chapter=195469&amp;layout=html&amp;Itemid=27#c_NIR_1360-016_footnote_nt1046 |title=Why Not a Volunteer Army? |accessdate=September 11, 2008 |author=[[Milton Friedman]] |year=1967 |work=New Individualist Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arguments in favor of conscription==

===Political and moral motives===
{{Further|Social contract|Social solidarity|Active citizenship}}
[[File:Conscription in Iran 3.jpg|thumb|left|Conscription in [[Iran]]]]

[[Jean Jacques Rousseau]] argued vehemently against professional armies, feeling it was the right and privilege of every citizen to participate to the defense of the whole society and a mark of moral decline to leave this business to professionals. He based this view on the development of the [[Roman republic]], which came to an end at the same time as the Roman army changed from a conscript to professional force.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:The Social Contract|Rousseau, J-J.

It is estimated by the British military that in a professional military, a company deployed for active duty in peacekeeping corresponds to three inactive companies at home. Salaries for each are paid from the military budget. In contrast, volunteers from a trained reserve are in their civilian jobs when they are not deployed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

==Drafting of women==
[[File:Flickr - Israel Defense Forces - Karakal Winter Training (1).jpg|thumb|Female Israeli soldiers]]

Traditionally conscription has been limited to the male population of a given body. Women and [[disabled]] men have been exempt from conscription. Many societies have considered, and continue to consider, military service as a [[initiation rite|test of manhood]] and a [[rite of passage]] from boyhood into manhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

After a law passed in March 2003, [[Tunisia]] became the first Arab country to universally conscript women.

In the [[USSR]], there was no systematic conscription of women for the armed forces, but the severe disruption of normal life and the high proportion of civilians affected by World War II after the German invasion attracted many volunteers for what was termed "[[The Great Patriotic War]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

In 1981 in the United States, several men filed lawsuit in the case ''[[Rostker v.

The [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] eventually upheld the Act, stating that "the argument for registering women was based on considerations of equity, but Congress was entitled, in the exercise of its constitutional powers, to focus on the question of military need, rather than 'equity.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0453_0057_ZS.html |title=Rostker v.

==Conscientious objection==
{{Main|Conscientious objection|Antimilitarism|Conscientious objection throughout the world}}
A [[conscientious objector]] is an individual whose personal beliefs are incompatible with [[Armed forces|military service]], or, more often, with any role in the armed forces.&lt;ref&gt;On July 30, 1993, explicit clarification of the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] Article 18 was made in the United Nations [[Human Rights Committee]] general comment 22, Para. 11: {{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/FreedomReligion/Pages/IstandardsI3k.aspx|title=Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief. Framework for communications. Conscientious Objection|publisher=Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|accessdate=2012-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CCPR.aspx|title=International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; See Article 18|publisher=Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|accessdate=2008-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some countries, conscientious objectors have special legal status, which augments their conscription duties. For example, Sweden used to allow (and once again, with the re-introduction of conscription, allows) conscientious objectors to choose a service in the "weapons-free" branch, such as an airport fireman, nurse or telecommunications technician.

The reasons for refusing to serve are varied. Some conscientious objectors are so for religious reasons—notably, the members of the historic [[peace churches]], [[pacifism|pacifist]] by doctrine; [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], while not strictly pacifists, refuse to participate in the armed forces on the ground that they believe Christians should be neutral in worldly conflicts.

===China===
[[File:Soldier Horse.JPG|thumb|upright|A [[Terracotta Army|terracotta]] soldier with his horse, China, 210–209 BC]]
Universal conscription in China dates back to the State of Qin, which eventually became the Qin Empire of 221 BC. Following unification, historical records show that a total of 300,000 conscript soldiers and 500,000 conscript labourers constructed the [[Great Wall of China]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinapage.com/friend/goh/beijing/greatwall/greatwall.html Great Wall&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718184726/http://www.chinapage.com/friend/goh/beijing/greatwall/greatwall.html |date=July 18, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following dynasties, universal conscription was abolished and reintroduced on numerous occasions.

{{as of|2011}},&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eng.mod.gov.cn/publications/2017-03/03/content_4774222.htm|title=Military Service Law of the People's Republic of China (2011 Amendment) [Effective]|last=Panyue|first=Huang|date=March 2017|website=Mnistry of National Defense The People's Republic of China|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; universal military conscription is theoretically mandatory in the People's Republic of China, and reinforced by law. However, due to the large population of China and large pool of candidates available for recruitment, the People's Liberation Army has always had sufficient volunteers, so conscription has not been required in practice at all.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===Europe===

====Austria====
Every male citizen of the Republic of Austria up to the age of 35 can be drafted for a six month long basic military training in the [[Austrian Armed Forces|Bundesheer]]. For men refusing to undergo this training, a nine-month lasting [[Zivildienst in Austria|community service]] is mandatory.

====Bulgaria====
Bulgaria had mandatory military service for males above 18 until conscription was ended in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wri-irg.org/en/story/2008/bulgaria-conscription-ended/|title=Bulgaria: conscription ended - War Resisters' International|website=www.wri-irg.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to a shortfall in the army of some 5500 soldiers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.plovdiv24.bg/novini/Bylgaria/Purva-stupka-kum-vrushtaneto-na-kazarmata-769722|title=Първа стъпка към връщането на казармата|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; parts of the current ruling coalition have expressed their support for the return of mandatory military service, most notably [[Krasimir Karakachanov]]. Opposition towards this idea from the main coalition partner, GERB, has seen a compromise, where instead of mandatory military service, Bulgaria could possibly introduce a voluntary military service by 2019 where young citizens can volunteer for a period of 6 to 9 months, and will receive a basic wage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dnes.bg/politika/2018/01/29/staroto-se-uvolniava-zaicite-revat-i-eto-idva-karakachanova-kazarma.366403|title=Старото се уволнява, зайците реват...

====Cyprus====
{{main|Conscription in Cyprus}}
Military service in the [[Cypriot National Guard]] is mandatory for all male citizens of the Republic of Cyprus, as well as any male non-citizens born of a parent of [[Greek Cypriots|Greek Cypriot]] descent, lasting from the January 1 of the year in which they turn 18 years of age to December 31, of the year in which they turn 50.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.army.gov.cy/en/file/Mz7pGiPfUAqhGYAsl9Rd6A==/&lt;/ref&gt;  All male residents of Cyprus who are of military age (16 and over) are required to obtain an [[exit visa]] from the Ministry of Defense. Currently, military conscription in Cyprus lasts 14 months.

====Denmark====
{{main|Conscription in Denmark}}
[[File:Copenhagen royal guard waiting.jpg|thumb|Conscription duty as [[Royal Life Guards (Denmark)|Royal Life Guards]] in Copenhagen.]]
Conscription is known in Denmark since the [[Viking Age]], where one man out of every 10 had to serve the king. [[Frederick IV of Denmark]] changed the law in 1710 to every 4th man. The men were chosen by the landowner and it was seen as a penalty.

Since 12 February 1849, every physically fit man must do military service. According to §81 in the [[Constitution of Denmark]], which was promulgated in 1849: &lt;blockquote&gt;Every male person able to carry arms shall be liable with his person to contribute to the defence of his country under such rules as are laid down by Statute.

====Finland====
{{main|Conscription in Finland}}
[[File:Suomalainen sotilasvala.jpg|left|thumb|Finnish conscripts swearing their [[oath of office#Military oath|military oath]] at the end of their basic training period.]]

Conscription in Finland is part of a general compulsion for [[national service|national military service]] for all adult males ({{lang-fi|maanpuolustusvelvollisuus}}; {{lang-sv|totalförsvarsplikt}}) defined in the 127§ of the [[Constitution of Finland]].

Conscription can take the form of military or of civilian service. According to [[Finnish Defence Forces]] 2011 data slightly under 80% of Finnish males turned 30 had entered and finished the military service. The number of female volunteers to annually enter armed service had stabilised at approximately 300.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.puolustusvoimat.fi/wcm/a2fcbb004bc4f18dabeeef82feb3371d/PV_vuke_2011_ENG.pdf?MOD=AJPERES Annual Report 2011. Page 29] Finnish Defence Forces&lt;/ref&gt; The service period is 165, 255 or 347 days for the rank and file conscripts and 347 days for conscripts trained as [[non-commissioned officer|NCO]]s or reserve officers. The length of civilian service is always twelve months. Those electing to serve unarmed in duties where unarmed service is possible serve either nine or twelve months, depending on their training.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/2007/20071446 Siviilipalveluslaki (1446/2007)] (''Civilian service act''), 4§.

Retrieved 1-24-2008.] {{fi icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Any Finnish male citizen who refuses to perform both military and civilian service faces a penalty of 173 days in prison, minus any served days. Such sentences are usually served fully in prison, with no [[parole]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/2007/20071446?search%5Btype%5D=pika&amp;search%5Bpika%5D=siviilipalveluslaki#L11P74 (''Civilian service act''), 74, 81§§.

By the Conscription Act of 1951, they are, however, required to serve a time at a local institution, like the coast guard. However, until such service has been arranged, they are freed from service obligation. The non-military service of Åland islands has not been arranged since the introduction of the act, and there are no plans to institute it. The inhabitants of Åland islands can also volunteer for military service on the mainland. As of 1995, women [[History of women in the military#Finland|are permitted]] to serve on a voluntary basis and pursue careers in the military after their initial voluntary military service.

The military service takes place in [[Finnish Defence Forces]] or in the [[Finnish Border Guard]]. All services of the Finnish Defence Forces train conscripts. However, the Border Guard trains conscripts only in land-based units, not in coast guard detachments or in the Border Guard Air Wing. Civilian service may take place in the Civilian Service Center in [[Lapinjärvi (municipality)|Lapinjärvi]] or in an accepted non-profit organization of educational, social or medical nature.

====Germany====
{{main|Conscription in Germany}}
In both [[East Germany|East]] and [[West Germany]], military service was mandatory for all male citizens. With the end of the [[Cold War]], then [[German reunification|reunified Germany]] drastically reduced the size of its [[Bundeswehr|armed forces]]. The low demand for conscripts led to the suspension of compulsory conscription in 2011. Since then only volunteer professionals serve in the Bundeswehr.

====Greece====
{{update|date=March 2017}}
{{main|Conscription in Greece}}
[[File:Changing of the Guard-Unknown Soldier-Hellenic Army.jpg|thumb|[[Evzones]] of the [[Evzones|Presidential Guard]] in front of the [[Greek Parliament]] armed with M1 Garands.]]
Since 1914, [[Greece]] has had a period of mandatory [[military]] service lasting 9 months for men between the ages of 16 and 45. Citizens discharged from active service are normally placed in the reserve and are subject to periodic recalls of 1–10 days at irregular intervals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stratologia.gr/pdf/N.3421-2005.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120105224001/http://www.stratologia.gr/pdf/N.3421-2005.pdf |archivedate=2012-01-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Universal conscription was introduced in Greece during the military reforms of 1909, although various forms of selective conscription had been in place earlier. In more recent years, conscription was associated with the state of general mobilisation declared on July 20, 1974 due to the crisis in [[Cyprus]] (the mobilisation was formally ended on December 18, 2002).

The period of time that a conscript is required to serve has varied historically, between 12–36 months depending on various factors particular to the conscript, and the political situation. Although women are accepted into the Greek army on a voluntary basis, they are not required to enlist, as men are. Soldiers receive no health insurance, but they are provided medical support during their army service, including hospitalization costs.

Since 2009, [[Greece]] has mandatory military service of 9 months for male citizens between the ages of 19 and 45. However, as the Armed forces had been gearing towards a completely professional army, the government had announced that the mandatory military service period would be cut to 6 months by 2008 or even abolished completely. However, this timetable was under reconsideration as of April 2006, due to severe manpower shortages. These had been caused by a combination of financial difficulties, meaning that professional soldiers could not be hired at the projected rate, and widespread [https://web.archive.org/web/20070930030615/http://news.kathimerini.gr/4dcgi/_w_articles_politics_935936_14/08/2005_153317 abuse] of the deferment process, resulting in two thirds of the conscripts deferred service in 2005. In August 2009, the mandatory service period was reduced to 9 months for the army, but has remained at 12 months for the navy and the air force. The number of conscripts affected to the latter two has been greatly reduced, with an aim towards full professionalisation.

Lithuania abolished its conscription in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;https://svenska.yle.fi/artikel/2015/02/24/litauen-aterinfor-allman-varnplikt&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2015 the Lithuanian parliament voted to return the conscription and the conscripts started their training in August 2015.&lt;ref&gt;https://svenska.yle.fi/artikel/2015/08/25/varnplikten-ar-tillbaka-i-litauen-hard-konkurrens-om-platserna&lt;/ref&gt; In practice there is no conscription in Lithuania, since all recruits have been volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baltictimes.com/lithuania_publishes_2016_conscription_lists/|title=Lithuania publishes 2016 conscription lists|website=www.baltictimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Moldova]], which currently has male conscription, has announced plans to abolish the practice. Moldova's Defense Ministry announced that a plan which stipulates the gradual elimination of military conscription will be implemented starting from the autumn of 2018.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.moldova.org/en/moldova-defense-ministry-conscription-will-gradually-abolished-starting-autumn/&lt;/ref&gt;

====Netherlands====
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2015}}
{{main|Conscription in the Netherlands}}
Conscription, which was called "Service Duty" ({{lang-nl|dienstplicht}}) in the [[Netherlands]], was first employed in 1810 by French occupying forces. [[Napoleon]]'s brother [[Louis Bonaparte]], who was [[King of Holland]] from 1806 to 1810, had tried to introduce conscription a few years earlier, unsuccessfully. Every man aged 20 years or older had to enlist. By means of drawing lots it was decided who had to undertake service in the French army. It was possible to arrange a substitute against payment.

Later on, conscription was used for all men over the age of 18. Postponement was possible, due to study, for example. Conscientious objectors could perform an alternative civilian service instead of military service. For various reasons, this forced military service was criticized at the end of the twentieth century. Since the Cold War was over, so was the direct threat of a war. Instead, the Dutch army was employed in more and more peacekeeping operations. The complexity and danger of these missions made the use of conscripts controversial. Furthermore, the conscription system was thought to be unfair as only men were drafted.

In the European part of Netherlands, compulsory attendance has been officially suspended since 1 May 1997. Between 1991 and 1996, the Dutch armed forces phased out their conscript personnel and converted to an all-professional force. The last conscript troops were inducted in 1995, and demobilized in 1996. The suspension means that citizens are no longer forced to serve in the armed forces, as long as it is not required for the safety of the country. Until then, the Dutch army has become an all-professional force. However, to this day, every male and female&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/actueel/nieuws/2016/02/02/kaderwet-dienstplicht-wordt-aangepast-voor-vrouwen|title=Kaderwet dienstplicht wordt aangepast voor vrouwen|first=Ministerie van|last=Defensie|work=rijksoverheid.nl|accessdate=15 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; citizen aged 17 gets a letter in which they are told that they have been registered but do not have to present themselves for service. The Dutch army allowed its male soldiers to have long hair from the early 1970s until the postponement of conscription in the mid-1990s.

====Norway====
{{main|Conscription in Norway}}
{{As of|2016|March}}, Norway currently employs a weak form of mandatory military service for men and women. In practice recruits are not forced to serve, instead only those who are motivated are selected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Norway's military conscription becomes gender neutral|url=http://www.dw.com/en/norways-military-conscription-becomes-gender-neutral/a-17995882|accessdate=2015-11-24|publisher=[[Deutsche Welle]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 60,000 Norwegians are available for conscription every year, but only 8,000 to 10,000 are conscripted.&lt;ref name="Norwegian Armed Forces - Conscription Statistics"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://forsvaret.no/om-forsvaret/fakta-om-forsvaret/Sider/tall-og-statistikk.aspx |title=NDF official numbers |publisher=NDF |accessdate=2007-07-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110112152739/http://forsvaret.no/om-forsvaret/fakta-om-forsvaret/Sider/tall-og-statistikk.aspx |archivedate=2011-01-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1985, women have been able to enlist for voluntary service as regular recruits.

{{as of|2011|January|1}}, [[Serbia]] no longer practises mandatory military service. Prior to this, mandatory military service lasted 6 months for men. [[Conscientious objector]]s could however opt for 9 months of [[civil service]] instead.

On 15 December 2010, the [[Parliament of Serbia]] voted to suspend mandatory military service.

====United Kingdom====
{{main|Conscription in the United Kingdom}}
The [[United Kingdom]] introduced conscription to full-time military service for the first time in January 1916 (the eighteenth month of [[World War I]]) and abolished it in 1920. [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], then part of the United Kingdom, was exempted from the original 1916 military service legislation, and although further legislation in 1918 gave power for an extension of conscription to Ireland, the power was never put into effect.

Conscription was reintroduced in 1939, in the lead up to [[World War II]], and continued in force until 1963. [[Northern Ireland]] was exempted from conscription legislation throughout the whole period.

In all, eight million men were conscripted during both World Wars, as well as several hundred thousand younger single women.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Broad, ''Conscription in Britain 1939–1964: The Militarization of a Generation'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of conscription in May 1939, before the war began, was partly due to pressure from the French, who emphasized the need for a large British army to oppose the Germans.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Hucker, "Franco-British Relations and the Question of Conscription in Britain, 1938–1939," ''Contemporary European History'', November 2008, Vol. 17 Issue 4, pp 437–56&lt;/ref&gt; From early 1942 unmarried women age 19–30 were conscripted. Most were sent to the factories, but they could volunteer for the [[Auxiliary Territorial Service]] (ATS) and other women's services. None was assigned to combat roles unless she volunteered. By 1943 women were liable to some form of directed labour up to age 51. During the Second World War, 1.4 million British men volunteered  for service and 3.2 million were conscripted. Conscripts comprised 50% of the [[Royal Air Force]], 60% of the [[Royal Navy]] and 80% of the [[British Army]].&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy A. Crang, "'Come into the Army, Maud': Women, Military Conscription, and the Markham Inquiry," ''Defence Studies'', November 2008, Vol. 8 Issue 3, pp. 381–95; statistics from pp. 392–93&lt;/ref&gt;

Britain and its colonies did not develop such pervasive administrative states, and therefore did not opt out for regulatory solutions, such as conscription, as a reliability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mulligan|first1=C.

===Israel===
{{main|Conscription in Israel}}
There is a mandatory service for all men and women who are fit and 18 years old. Men must serve 32 months while women serve 24 months with some exempt from mandatory service:
* Muslim and Christian Arabs
* permanent residents such as the [[Druze]] of the Golan Heights
* Ultra-Orthodox Jews can apply for deferment to study in [[Yeshiva]] and the deferment tends to become an exemption
* Female religious Jews, if they declare they are unable to serve due to religious grounds. Many choose to volunteer in the national service [[Sherut Leumi]].

All of the above can choose to volunteer to the IDF. Relatively large numbers of [[Bedouin]] choose to volunteer.

Male [[Druze]] and [[Circassians|Circassian]] Israeli citizens are liable, by agreement with their community leaders (Female Druze and Circassian are exempt from service).

===United States===
{{Main|Conscription in the United States}}
In the United States, conscription, also called "the draft", ended in 1973, but males aged between 18 and 25 are required to register with the [[Selective Service System]] to enable a reintroduction of conscription if necessary. President [[Gerald Ford]] suspended mandatory draft registration in 1975, but President [[Jimmy Carter]] reinstated that requirement when the [[Soviet–Afghan War|Soviet Union intervened in Afghanistan]] five years later. Selective Service registration is still required of almost all young men, although the draft has not been used since 1973&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gill|first=Linda|title=Military Conscription, Recruiting and the Draft|publisher=About.com US Politics}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there have been no prosecutions for violations of the draft registration law since 1986.&lt;ref name="National Resistance Committee"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hasbrouck|first1=Edward|title=Prosecutions of Draft Registration Resisters|url=https://hasbrouck.org/draft/prosecutions.html|website=Resisters.info|publisher=National Resistance Committee|accessdate=28 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Males between the ages of 17 and 45, and female members of the [[US National Guard]] may be conscripted for federal militia service pursuant to 10 U.S. Code § 246 and the [[Militia Clause]]s of the [[United States Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/246|title=10 U.S. Code § 246 - Militia: composition and classes|website=LII / Legal Information Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21897">A '''Crime of Aggression''' is a specific type of crime where a person plans, initiates, or executes an act of aggression using state military force that violates the [[Charter of the United Nations]]. The act is judged as a violation based on its character, gravity, and scale.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/asp_docs/Resolutions/RC-Res.6-ENG.pdf|title=Resolution RC/Res.6: The crime of aggression|last=|first=|date=2010-06-10|website=International Criminal Court|publisher=|access-date=2016-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Acts of aggression include invasion, military occupation, annexation by the use of force, bombardment, and military blockade of ports.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Crime of Aggression is a [[crime]] under the [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court]]. The definitions and the conditions for the exercise of [[jurisdiction]] over this crime were adopted by [[consensus]] at the [[Review Conference of the Rome Statute|2010 Kampala Review Conference]] by the [[States parties to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|States Parties to the Court]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icc-cpi.int/menus/asp/reviewconference/pressreleaserc/review%20conference%20of%20the%20rome%20statute%20concludes%20in%20kampala Conference of the Rome Statute concludes in Kampala]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jurist.org/paperchase/2010/06/icc-nations-adopt-crime-of-aggression.php|title=ICC nations define crime of aggression|accessdate= 26 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In 1998, at the [[Rome Conference]] that adopted the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court ("the Statute"), the crime was included as one of the crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court (Article 5.1) and over which any State that becomes party to the Statute accepts the Court’s jurisdiction (Article 12.1). However, participants to the Rome Conference could not agree on the definition of the crime nor on further conditions for the Court’s exercise of jurisdiction; the Statute did not allow the Court to exercise such jurisdiction until these outstanding issues were solved (Article 5.2). At the 2010 Review Conference ("the Conference"),  States Parties agreed by consensus to adopt resolution RC/Res.6 accepting the amendments to the Statute adding the definition of the crime and the conditions for the exercise of jurisdiction over this crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/asp_docs/Resolutions/RC-Res.6-ENG.pdf|title=Resolution RC/Res.6 !|accessdate=14 May 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320072358/http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/asp_docs/Resolutions/RC-Res.6-ENG.pdf|archivedate=20 March 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Adopted amendments ===
* The adopted [[Amendments to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|amendments to the Rome Statute]] included, inter alia, deletion of Article 5.2 of the Rome Statute that formerly stated "The Court shall exercise jurisdiction over the crime of aggression once a provision is adopted in accordance with articles 121 and 123 defining the crime and setting out the conditions under which the Court shall exercise jurisdiction with respect to this crime. Such a provision shall be consistent with the relevant provisions of the [[Charter of the United Nations]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://legal.un.org/icc/statute/99_corr/2.htm#art.5  Part 2. Jurisdiction, admissibility and applicable law.  Article 5.]&lt;/ref&gt; and additions of Article 8 bis and Article 15 bis/ter that defined the "crime of aggression" and conditions on the exercise of jurisdiction over the "crime of aggression," respectively.
* Resolution RC/Res.6 states that these amendments enter into force in accordance with Article 121.5 of the Rome Statute, meaning for each ratifying State individually one year after the deposit of its instrument of ratification or acceptance. For the Court to actively exercise jurisdiction over the crime of aggression, however, the amendments stipulate additional conditions: The amendments must have been ratified or accepted since a year by at least thirty States Parties, and in addition States Parties must “activate” the Court’s jurisdiction through an additional decision to be taken on or after 1 January 2017 by a two thirds majority.

== Definition ==
Under the Statute, the definition of "crime of aggression" is stated as follows:

=== Article 8 bis ===
:1. For the purpose of this Statute, “crime of aggression” means the planning, preparation, initiation or execution, by a person in a position effectively to exercise control over or to direct the political or military action of a State, of an act of aggression which, by its character, gravity and scale, constitutes a manifest violation of the Charter of the United Nations.
:2. For the purpose of paragraph 1, “act of aggression” means the use of [[armed force]] by a State against the [[sovereignty]], [[territorial integrity]] or [[political independence]] of another State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Charter of the United Nations. Any of the following acts, regardless of a [[declaration of war]], shall, in accordance with [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 3314|United Nations General Assembly resolution 3314]] (XXIX) of 14 December 1974, qualify as an act of aggression:
::(a) The [[invasion]] or attack by the armed forces of a State of the [[territory (country subdivision)|territory]] of another State, or any [[military occupation]], however temporary, resulting from such invasion or attack, or any [[annexation]] by the [[use of force]] of the territory of another State or part thereof;
::(b) [[Bombardment]] by the armed forces of a State against the territory of another State or the use of any [[weapons]] by a State against the territory of another State;
::(c) The [[blockade]] of the ports or coasts of a State by the [[armed forces]] of another State;
::(d) An attack by the armed forces of a State on the land, sea or air forces, or marine and air fleets of another State;
::(e) The use of armed forces of one State which are within the territory of another State with the agreement of the receiving State, in contravention of the conditions provided for in the agreement or any extension of their presence in such territory beyond the termination of the agreement;
::(f) The action of a State in allowing its territory, which it has placed  at  the disposal of another State, to be used by that other State for perpetrating an act of aggression against a third State;
::(g) The sending by or on behalf of a State of armed bands, groups, irregulars or [[mercenaries]], which carry out acts of armed force against another State of such gravity as to amount to the acts listed above, or its substantial involvement therein.

== Exercise of jurisdiction  ==
Under the Statute, the conditions for the exercise of jurisdiction for the "crime of aggression" by the Court are as defined below. With these provisions, the Court may exercise its jurisdiction over the "crime of aggression" in one or all of the following ways.
# State referral, ''[[proprio motu]]'' 
# Security Council referral

=== Article 15 bis ===
Exercise of jurisdiction over the crime of aggression (State referral, [[proprio motu]])
#The Court may exercise jurisdiction over the crime of aggression in accordance with article 13, paragraphs (a) and (c), subject to the provisions of this article.
#The Court may exercise jurisdiction only with respect to crimes of aggression committed one year after the [[ratification]] or [[acceptance]] of the amendments by thirty States Parties.
#The Court shall exercise jurisdiction over the crime of aggression in accordance with this article, subject to a decision to be taken after 1 January 2017 by the same majority of States Parties as is required for the adoption of an amendment to the Statute.
#The Court may, in accordance with article 12, exercise jurisdiction over a crime of aggression, arising from an act of aggression committed by a State Party, unless that State Party has previously declared that it does not accept such jurisdiction by lodging a declaration with the Registrar. The withdrawal of such a declaration may be effected at any time and shall be considered by the State Party within three years.
#In respect of a State that is not a party to this Statute, the Court shall not exercise its jurisdiction over the crime of aggression when committed by that State’s nationals or on its territory.
#Where the [[Prosecutor]] concludes that there is a reasonable basis to proceed with an [[Criminal investigation|investigation]] in respect of a crime of aggression, he or she shall first ascertain whether the Security Council has made a determination of an act of aggression committed by the State concerned. The Prosecutor shall notify the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]] of the situation before the Court, including any relevant information and documents.
#Where the Security Council has made such a determination, the Prosecutor may proceed with the investigation in respect of a crime of aggression.
#Where no such determination is made within six months after the date of notification, the Prosecutor may proceed with the investigation in respect of a crime of aggression, provided that the Pre-Trial Division has authorized the commencement of the investigation in respect of a crime of aggression in accordance with the procedure contained in article 15, and the Security Council has not decided otherwise in accordance with article 16.
#A determination  of  an  act  of  aggression  by  an  organ  outside  the  Court  shall  be without prejudice to the Court’s own findings under this Statute.
#This article is without prejudice to the provisions relating to the exercise of jurisdiction with respect to other crimes referred to in article 5.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.icc-cpi.int/nr/rdonlyres/add16852-aee9-4757-abe7-9cdc7cf02886/283503/romestatuteng1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Article 15 ter ===

#The Court may exercise jurisdiction only with respect to crimes of aggression committed one year after the ratification or acceptance of the amendments by thirty States Parties.
#The Court shall exercise jurisdiction over the crime of aggression in accordance with this article, subject to a decision to be taken after 1 January 2017 by the same majority of States Parties as is required for the adoption of an amendment to the Statute.
#A determination of an act of aggression by an organ outside the Court shall be without prejudice to the Court’s own findings under this Statute.
#This article is without prejudice to the provisions relating to the exercise of jurisdiction with respect to other crimes referred to in article 5.

== Activation of the Court's jurisdiction ==
Since the amendments on the crime of aggression were adopted under Article 121.5, they enter into force for each ratifying State individually. In addition, the amendments require two further conditions to be fulfilled for the Court to exercise jurisdiction,  both for state referrals and ''proprio motu'' investigations (15 bis) and for Security Council referrals (15 ter):
# The Court may exercise jurisdiction only with respect to crimes of aggression committed one year after the ratification or acceptance of the amendments by thirty States Parties.
# The Court shall exercise jurisdiction over the crime of aggression in accordance with this article, subject to a decision to be taken after 1 January 2017 by the same majority of States Parties as is required for the adoption of an amendment to the Statute.
At the 16th annual session of the Assembly of States Parties to the Rome Treaty, it was decided to activate jurisdiction of the Crime of Aggression starting July 17, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/item.aspx?name=pr1350 Assembly activates Court’s jurisdiction over crime of aggression, Dec. 15, 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===
In 2006, the [[House of Lords]] ruled in the case or ''R v Jones'' that the crime of aggression did not exist in English law as it applied within the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldjudgmt/jd060329/jones.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
After its formal participation in the Review Conference as Observer, on 15 June 2010 the [[United States]] government held a special briefing on the Conference outlining what they deemed as accomplishments.

{{Quotation|The United States considered the definition of aggression flawed, but a number of important safeguards were adopted. Understandings were adopted to make the definition more precise, to ensure that the crime will be applied only to the most egregious circumstances. And while we think the final resolution took insufficient account of the Security Council’s assigned role to define aggression, the states parties rejected solutions that provided for jurisdiction without a Security Council or consent-based screen. We hope that crime will be improved in the future and will continue to engage toward that end.|Harold Hongju Koh, Legal Advisor U.S. Department of State &lt;ref&gt;

The '''doctrine of colourability''' is the idea that when a [[legislature]] wants to do something that it cannot do within the constraints of its [[government]]'s [[constitution]], it colours the law with a substitute purpose, allowing it to accomplish its original goal.

==India==
Under the [[constitution of India]],&lt;ref&gt;Book Titled "Land and the Constitution in India" has a chapter titled "Empire and Commonwealth Origins of the Doctrine of Colorability" page 209 and "Colorability" and Zamindari Abolition Laws" page 211&lt;/ref&gt; exclusive jurisdiction for the Union and the [[nation|State]] has been conferred regarding subject matters of [[legislation]]. This has been provided by Article 246,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vlex.in/vid/maganbhai-ishwarbhai-patel-union-and-29692323 |title=Case nº 1528 of Appeal, January 09, 1969 (case Maganbhai Ishwarbhai Patel VS. Union Of India And Anr.) - Maganbhai Ishwarbhai Patel VS. Union Of India And Anr. - Supreme Court of India - Id 29692323 - vLex India |publisher=Vlex.in |date= |accessdate=2014-03-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140316201401/http://vlex.in/vid/maganbhai-ishwarbhai-patel-union-and-29692323 |archivedate=March 16, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which has demarcated the legislative [[jurisdiction]] of the [[Parliament of India|parliament]] and the [[state assembly|state assemblies]] by outlining the different subjects under List I for the Union, List II for the State, and List III for both, as given in the seventh schedule to the [[Constitution of India|Indian Constitution]]. As a consequence, conflicts of jurisdiction arise due to the fact there exist separate lists for the Union and the State to legislate upon. It often happens that strict constitutional boundaries are transgressed in legislation, inviting [[judicial review]] of the said [[Bill (law)|bill]]/[[act (law)|act]].

The [[Enactment of a bill|enactment of legislation]] is a function of the legislative power. In order to decide whether particular legislation is unconstitutional for breaching the constitutional limitations of [[Separation of powers|distribution of powers]], the Court examines the enactment with some [[strict scrutiny|strictness]]. The legislature can only make laws within its legislative competence. The legislative competence may be limited by specific List entries, or be restricted by other constitutional limitations and prohibitions. It cannot over-step the area of its legislative capability. A simple rule is followed in this regard, which is to find out if the legislating body had the power to legislate directly. If not, then the legislature cannot legislate indirectly. What it cannot do directly, it cannot attempt to do indirectly. Therefore, the substance of the legislation must be articulated for the purpose of determining whether what it enacted, it could really do. 

The question of colourable legislation was fully discussed by the [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]] in K.C. Gajapati Narayan Deo v. Orissa, a decision which has been treated as settling the [[law]] on the subject. This ruling was confirmed in the Supreme Court decision of Sonapur Tea Co. v. Deputy Commissioner.

'''''Farwell v. Boston &amp; Worcester R.R. Corp''''', 45 Mass. 49 (Mass. 1842),&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=hGY9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA3&amp;dq=farwell+v.+boston+and+worcester+railroad&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=dbIMSrPSBIbEzQTAyqjmAw#PPA885,M1 full text]&lt;/ref&gt; Massachusetts Chief Justice [[Lemuel Shaw]] used a [[contract]] rationale to prevent a railroad worker from recovering from his employer, [[Boston and Worcester Railroad]], for an injury due to the [[negligence]] of a switch tender employed by the same company, even though a third party or passenger would likely have been able to recover for the same injury. In Shaw's view, the injured worker was in as good a position as his employer had been (indeed, most likely a better one) to monitor the work of his fellow workers. It followed that to allow Farwell to recover compensatory damages would have been to create a moral hazard in the workplace, softening the blow of employee carelessness for those best able to prevent it.

This created the [[fellow servant rule]]. In the years and decades that followed, courts in Massachusetts and elsewhere in the United States developed a panoply of doctrines that made it exceedingly difficult for industrial workers to go to law for insurance against the risks of their work. Employees were said to assume the ordinary risks inherent in the workplace. And where an employee's own negligence (no matter how slight) contributed to his injury, he was barred from recovering damages, even from a negligent employer.  The contributory fault doctrine connected the law of work risks to a much broader array of nineteenth-century legal rules that limited the law's risk-spreading capacity. People entering onto someone else's land were owed only a limited duty of care, and sometimes no duty of care at all.

The ''Farwell'' opinion has been seen by some scholars as providing the financial stability necessary to secure the success of an infant railroad industry.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Leonard W. Levy, Lemuel Shaw: America's "Greatest Magistrate", 7 VILL. L. REV. 389, 399-400 n123 (1962).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Held==
*The mere incompetency of a fellow servant is insufficient to render the master liable for his negligent acts, absent a showing that the master knew of such incompetency, and was negligent in continuing to employ him.
*A master is not liable for injuries to a servant, caused by the negligence of a fellow servant engaged in the same general business, where the master has furnished proper appliances, and has not been negligent in the selection of fellow employees.
*Employees engaged in the same general business are fellow servants, though they are in different departments of work.
*The liability of a master for injuries to a servant, caused by the negligence of a fellow servant, is not dependent on the ability of the injured servant to influence the acts and conduct of the negligent servant.
*An engineer in the employ of a railroad company cannot recover for injuries caused by the negligence of a switch tender, who is employed by the same company, since they are fellow servants.
*A person entering the service of another assumes all risks naturally incident to that employment, including the danger of injury by the fault or negligence of a fellow servant.
*A railroad company employed A., who was careful and trusty in his general character, to tend the switches on their road; and, after he had been long in their service, they employed B. to run the passenger train of cars on the road, B. knowing the employment and character of A. Held, that the company were not answerable to B. for an injury received by him, while running the cars, in consequence of the carelessness of A. in the management of the switches.

{{Gun laws by country}}
[[File:Kleiner Waffenschein Außen.JPG|thumb|right|A German firearms license.]]
A '''firearms license''' (also known as a '''gun license'''; or '''licence''' in [[British English]]) is a [[license]] or permit issued by a government authority (typically by the [[police]]) of a jurisdiction, that allows the licensee to buy, own, possess, or carry a [[firearm]], often subject to a number of conditions or restrictions, especially with regard to storage requirements or the completion of a firearms safety course, as well as background checks, etc. Firearms licenses are not required in all jurisdictions. Additionally, some countries or states may require by law a "permit-to-purchase" in order to buy handguns or firearms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21739193-washington-dithers-and-argues-some-states-show-way-what-works-reduce-gun-deaths|title=What works to reduce gun deaths|website=The Economist|language=en|access-date=2018-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The permit or license scope varies according to what firearm(s) or activity(s) it allows the holder to legally do with the firearm. Some jurisdictions may require a firearm license to own a firearm, to engage in hunting, target shooting or collecting, or to carry a concealed firearm, or operate a business (such as being a gun dealer or a gunsmith). Some jurisdictions may require separate licenses for rifles, shotguns or handguns.

The requirement to have a firearm license, is usually in addition to a requirement for firearm registration. For example, in Australia, firearms must be registered by serial number to the owner, who holds a firearm licence.

A '''referendum on the new [[constitution of France]]''' was held in [[French Somaliland]] on 28 September 1958 as part of a [[French constitutional referendum, 1958|wider referendum]] held across the [[French Union]]. The new constitution would see the country become part of the new [[French Community]] if accepted, or result in independence if rejected. It was approved by 75.24% of voters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sudd.ch/event.php?lang=en&amp;id=fr011958 Frankreich, 28. September 1958 : Verfassung] Direct Democracy&lt;/ref&gt;

==Results==
The referendum result was in favour of a continued association with France; 75% voted "yes", while 25% were opposed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.africatravelling.net/djibouti/djibouti/djibouti_history.htm Djibouti - History] Africa Travelling&lt;/ref&gt; This was partly due to a combined "yes" vote by the sizable [[Afar people|Afar]] ethnic group and resident Europeans.&lt;ref name=Barrington2006&gt;Lowell Barrington (2006) ''After Independence: Making and Protecting the Nation in Postcolonial and Postcommunist States'', University of Michigan Press, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; There were also allegations of widespread [[vote rigging]]. According to the UN, there was an inordinate number of invalid ballots in [[Somali people|Somali]] districts, which it suggested implied that the plebiscite had been manipulated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Report|date=1967|publisher=United Nations, General Assembly|page=21|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=44s6AQAAIAAJ|accessdate=18 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of those who had voted "no" were Somalis who were strongly in favour of joining a united Somalia, as had been proposed by [[Mahmoud Harbi]], then Vice President of the Government Council.&lt;ref name=Barrington2006/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5295">'''[[HVAC]]''' ('''H'''eating, '''V'''entilation and '''A'''ir '''C'''onditioning) equipment needs a control system to regulate the operation of a heating and/or air conditioning system. Usually a sensing device is used to compare the actual state (e.g. temperature) with a target state. Then the control system draws a conclusion what action has to be taken (e.g. start the blower).

==Direct digital control==
Central controllers and most terminal unit controllers are programmable, meaning the [[Direct Digital Control|direct digital control]] program code may be customized for the intended use. The program features include time schedules, [[Set point (control system)|setpoint]]s, controllers, logic, timers, trend logs, and alarms. The unit controllers typically have analog and digital inputs that allow measurement of the variable (temperature, humidity, or pressure) and [[analog signal|analog]] and [[Digital data|digital]] outputs for control of the transport medium (hot/cold water and/or steam). Digital inputs are typically (dry) contacts from a control device, and analog inputs are typically a voltage or current measurement from a variable (temperature, humidity, velocity, or pressure) sensing device. Digital outputs are typically relay contacts used to start and stop equipment, and analog outputs are typically voltage or current signals to control the movement of the medium (air/water/steam) control devices such as valves, dampers, and motors.

Groups of DDC controllers, networked or not, form a layer of system themselves. This "subsystem" is vital to the performance and basic operation of the overall HVAC system. The DDC system is the "brain" of the HVAC system. It dictates the position of every damper and valve in a system. It determines which fans, pumps, and chiller run and at what speed or capacity. With this configurable intelligency in this "brain", we are moving to the concept of building automation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://xinca.com/?p=386 Role on DDC Systems in Building Commissioning]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Building Automation System==
More complex HVAC systems can interface to [[Building automation|Building Automation System (BAS)]] to allow the building owners to have more control over the heating or cooling units. The building owner can monitor the system and respond to alarms generated by the system from local or remote locations. The system can be scheduled for occupancy or the configuration can be changed from the BAS. Sometimes the BAS is directly controlling the HVAC components.
Depending on the BAS different interfaces can be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=KMC Controls |title=Understanding Building Automation and Control Systems |url=http://www.kmccontrols.com/products/Understanding_Building_Automation_and_Control_Systems.aspx |accessdate=12 March 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130519124213/http://www.kmccontrols.com/products/Understanding_Building_Automation_and_Control_Systems.aspx |archivedate=19 May 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, there are also dedicated gateways that connect advanced VRV / VRF and Split HVAC Systems with Home Automation and BMS (Building Management Systems) controllers for centralized control and monitoring, obviating the need to purchase more complex and expensive HVAC systems. In addition, such gateway solutions are capable of providing remote control operation of all HVAC indoor units over the internet incorporating a simple and friendly user interface.&lt;ref name=hvac&gt;{{cite web|title=CEDIA Find: Cool Automation Integrates Smart Air Conditioners with Third-Party Control Systems|url=http://www.cepro.com/article/cedia_find_cool_automation_integrates_smart_air_conditioners_with_third_par/ |publisher=CEPro|accessdate=16 Jun 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
It was natural that the first HVAC controllers would be [[pneumatic]] since engineers understood fluid control. Thus, [[mechanical engineer]]s could use their experience with the properties of steam and air to control the flow of heated or cooled air.

After the control of air flow and temperature was standardized, the use of electromechanical relays in [[ladder logic]] to switch [[Zone damper|damper]]s became standardized. Eventually, the relays became electronic switches, as [[transistor]]s eventually could handle greater current loads. By 1985, pneumatic controls could no longer compete with this new technology although pneumatic control systems (sometimes decades old) are still common in many older buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=KMC Controls|title=Pneumatic to Digital: Open System Conversions|url=http://www.kmccontrols.com/images/agiods_files/downloads/Pneumatics_Digital_Conversion_White_Paper.pdf|accessdate=5 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the year 2000, computerized controllers were common. Today, some of these controllers can even be accessed by web browsers, which need no longer be in the same building as the HVAC equipment. This allows some [[economies of scale]], as a single operations center can easily monitor multiple buildings.

The '''Hong Kong Royal Instructions 1917'''&lt;ref&gt;The [[long title]] is 'Instructions to Our Governor and Commander-in-Chief in and over Our Colony of Hongkong and Its Dependencies or Other Officer for the Time Being Administering the Government of Our Said Colony and Its Dependencies'&lt;/ref&gt; was one of the principal [[constitution]]al instruments of [[Hong Kong]] when it was a [[British Empire|British]] [[Crown colony]] and [[British Overseas Territories|dependent territory]]; the other principal constitutional instruments were the [[Hong Kong Letters Patent 1917]], the [[Hong Kong Letters Patent 1960]], the [[Hong Kong Letters Patent 1982]], and the [[Hong Kong Letters Patent 1991 (No. 1)]].&lt;ref&gt;While other post-1917 letters patent only contain provisions amending the 1917 letters patent, the ones issued in 1960 and 1982 and the first one in 1991 contain a stipulation that any act done before the amendment concerned coming into force and contrary to that amendment remains valid.&lt;/ref&gt; The Hong Kong Royal Instructions 1917 has been amended many times since its coming into force by instruments titled 'Hong Kong Additional Instructions [year]'.

The Hong Kong Royal Instructions 1917 superseded the royal instructions issued on 6 April 1843, all additional instructions amending the 1843 royal instructions, the 1888 royal instructions (replacing the 1843 royal instructions and all additional instructions amending the 1843 royal instructions), and all additional instructions amending the 1888 royal instructions.  The royal instructions issued on 14 February 1917, as amended from time to time, formed part of the basis for Hong Kong's system of government until the [[Transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong|transfer of the territory's sovereignty]] on 1 July 1997 to the [[People's Republic of China]].

Issued under the [[royal prerogative]], and subordinated to the Hong Kong Letters Patent 1917, the Hong Kong Royal Instructions 1917 set out such matters as the constitution of the [[Executive Council of Hong Kong|Executive Council]] and the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]], and in particular made provision for the latter's procedures, and for the enactment of laws.

After the transfer of sovereignty to China, the Hong Kong Royal Instructions 1917 ceased to have legal effect, being superseded by the new [[Hong Kong Basic Law|Basic Law]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2006">'''Incidental effect''' is a concept in [[European Union law]] that allows the use of [[indirect effect]] of [[Directive (European Union)|EU directives]] in private legal actions.  While an individual cannot be sued for failure to comply with an EU directive, the state's failure to comply can be an incidental factor in a suit against an individual, where it will not impose legal obligations upon them.&lt;ref&gt;Craig, De Burca, p. 296&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept was defined by the [[European Court of Justice]] in Case C-194/94 ''CIA Security International SA v. Signalson SA and Securitel Sprl''.&lt;ref&gt;''CIA Security International SA v. Signalson SA and Securitel Sprl'' [1996] ECR I-2201&lt;/ref&gt; CIA had attempted to market a [[burglar]] alarm in Belgium that was not compatible with Belgian technical specifications.  However, the Belgian government had failed to report these specifications to the EU, as required by a directive in 1983.  The court ruled that this constituted a substantial degradation of the effectiveness of the directive, which was intended to lower barriers to trade, and that the Belgian government's breach of the directive made the Belgian law inapplicable to individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Craig, De Burca, p. 297&lt;/ref&gt;

This concept was especially important in the field of [[contract]]s.  The Court of Justice stated that a substantial procedural defect in implementing a directive could nullify a national law in the context of a contract,&lt;ref&gt;In the case of ''Unilever Italia SpA v. Central Food SpA'' [2000] ECR I-7535&lt;/ref&gt; and gave national courts the power to interpret such legal problems based on their own contract law.&lt;ref&gt;''Sapod Audic v. Eco-Emballages SA'' [2002] All ER (D) 06 (Jun)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Income Tax Amendments Act, 2006''' was a [[bill (law)|bill]] introduced in the Canadian Parliament in 2007 by the [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative]] government of Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]].  It was numbered '''Bill C-10''' of the second session of the [[39th Parliament of Canada]].

The bill contained a controversial clause which would have allowed the federal government to deny tax credits for films where public funding was deemed to be contrary to public policy.  The clause attracted public criticism, with [[David Cronenberg]] and [[Sarah Polley]] arguing that the clause represented censorship of Canadian films.  Others, such as [[Charles McVety]] and [[REAL Women of Canada]], argued that the provision recognized that public funding should not be available for movies which were offensive to large numbers of people.  Film producers, such as [[Steve Hoban]], argued that the clause would make it harder to make movies in Canada.

After public outcry, Prime Minister Harper announced that the bill would not be passed with the controversial clause included.

== Legislative history ==

The bill was first introduced as Bill C-33 in 2006, in the first session of the 39th Parliament.  It passed all legislative stages in the House of Commons by June 2007 and then received first reading in the Senate that same month.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.parl.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?billId=2515623&amp;Language=E Progress of Bills:  Bill C-33, 39th Parliament, 1st Session.]&lt;/ref&gt;  However, it did not pass the Senate before the [[Prorogation in Canada|prorogation]] of Parliament.

The bill was re-introduced in the Commons as Bill C-10 during the 2nd session.  By order of the House, it was deemed approved at all stages completed in the previous session, effective October 29, 2007.&lt;ref name="legis"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/Legisinfo/BillDetails.aspx?billId=3085457&amp;Language=E&amp;Mode=1|title=Progress of Bills:  Bill C-10, 39th Parliament, 2nd Session.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The bill then was introduced in the Senate the next day, October 30, 2007.  It passed [[second reading]] on December 4, 2007, and was referred to committee.&lt;ref name = "legis"/&gt;

The bill did not pass the Senate prior to the [[dissolution of Parliament]] for the 2008 general election.&lt;ref name = "legis"/&gt;

== Content of the bill ==

The long title of the bill was "An Act to amend the Income Tax Act, including amendments in relation to foreign investment entities and non-resident trusts, and to provide for the bijural expression of the provisions of that Act". Among a 600-page list of minor changes to tax law, the bill contained a clause that would have amended s. 125.4 of the ''Income Tax Act'' to give the [[Minister of Canadian Heritage]] the power to deny taxation credits for films made in Canada, if the Minister concluded that public financial support of the production would be "contrary to public policy".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parl.ca/DocumentViewer/en/39-2/bill/C-10/third-reading/page-4 Bill C-10, clause 120(3), to amend s. 125.4(1) of the ''Income Tax Act''].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Public reaction ==

Critics of the clause argued that it was equivalent to censorship because most Canadian films cannot afford to be produced without government assistance. After the Bill passed the Commons on October 29, 2007, opposition parties said that they did not notice the controversial clause.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} Several Senators said that they intended to send the bill back to the Commons.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

At the Senate hearings on the bill, the Minister of Canadian Heritage gave an explanation for the clause.  She said that the test of "contrary to public policy" had been used in the regulations, and that the clause had been included by previous drafts of the bill proposed by the previous Liberal government.  She also explained the purpose for the clause:  "It ensures that the government has the ability, in exceptional circumstances, to exclude certain material from public support. There is material that is potentially illegal under the Criminal Code, such as indecent material, hate propaganda, and child pornography. Currently, no provision in the Income Tax Act or regulations exclude such material. Bill C-10 addresses this loophole, in particular."&lt;ref name=straight&gt;{{cite news |first=Charlie |last=Smith |title= Bill C-10 is Canada's new culture war |work=Georgia Straight |date=12 June 2008 |accessdate=13 March 2009 |url=https://www.straight.com/article-149268/canadas-new-culture-war?rotator=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hearings in the Senate committee on the bill were described as a "gong show" by Jim Abbott, MP, the parliamentary secretary to the Minister of Canadian heritage.  Opponents of the clause, such as director [[David Cronenberg]] and actor-director [[Sarah Polley]]  argued that it amounted to government censorship of videos and movies.  Supporters of the clause, such as [[Charles McVety]], president of the Canada Family Action Coalition, and Diane Watts, a researcher with [[REAL Women of Canada]], argued that public funding should not be given to movies which are offensive to large numbers of Canadians.&lt;ref name=straight/&gt;

Iconic of the debate was a contemporary Canadian film titled ''[[Young People Fucking]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Liam |last=Lacey |title=Relax&amp;nbsp;– the title is as outrageous as this movie gets |work=The Globe and Mail |date=14 June 2008 |accessdate=13 March 2009 |quote=perhaps leading to the infamous Bill C-10 to limit funding to morally objectionable material |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/relax---the-title-is-as-outrageous-as-this-movie-gets/article720478/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The film contained no pornographic material and received favourable reviews and a relatively wide distribution for a Canadian film.  It was released in 2007, a year after the clause had first been introduced in Bill C-36 in 2006.  However, it was cited by some Conservative parliamentarians as an example of a film which would not receive financial aid under Bill C-10.&lt;ref name = straight/&gt; Senators and MPs were invited to view an advance screening of the film.

[[Steve Hoban]], the producer of the film, explained that the clause would introduce uncertainty into the funding arrangements for film productions.  In his view, uncertainty about the availability of tax credits would make it more difficult to get financing for movies in Canada, which would likely drive production out of Canada to other countries with more favourable tax regimes.  [[Sam Sullivan]], the mayor of Vancouver, testified against the clause, arguing that it would have a negative impact on the Canadian film industry, which provided large numbers of jobs.  The mayors of Toronto and Montreal also testified against the clause, while the Mayor of Halifax sent a letter opposing the clause.&lt;ref name = straight/&gt;

== Outcome ==

The bill did not pass the Senate committee prior to the dissolution of Parliament for the [[2008 Canadian federal election]].

When the Conservative Party released their platform for the election, Prime Minister Harper announced that if re-elected, they would not proceed with the clause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Canadian Press |title=Artists happy with Tory reversal on plan to scrap film, TV tax credits |work=CBC |date=7 October 2008 |accessdate=13 March 2009 |quote=Conservative Leader Stephen Harper's promise to reverse plans to scrap tax credits for productions deemed offensive to Canadian viewers came as a pleasant surprise Tuesday to those in the film and television business and a major blow to the religious right. |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canadavotes/story/2008/10/07/arts-harper.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Istihlal''' ({{lang-ar|استحلال}} ''istiḥlāl'') is a term used in [[Islam]]ic [[jurisprudence]], or [[fiqh]], to refer to the act of regarding some action as permissible, or [[halaal]], although it is [[haraam]]; the implication is that such a regard is an erroneous and improper distortion of [[Sharia|Islamic law]].  The word "istihlal" is derived as [[Arabic grammar#Stem formation|Stem X]] of the Arabic [[consonantal root]] ح-ل-ل meaning "to untie", "to solve", "to dissolve", "to open", "to release", etc. &lt;ref name=wehrcowan&gt;Hans Wehr. ''[[Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic|A Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic]]: Third Edition''.  ed. [[J. Milton Cowan]].  Spoken Language Services, Inc.  [[Ithaca, New York]], 1976.  {{ISBN|0-87950-001-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "istihlal" came to prominence in the Western news media on 11 March 2005, the first anniversary of the [[11 March 2004 Madrid train bombings|Madrid bombing attacks of 2004]], when the [[Islamic Commission of Spain]] (La Comisión Islámica de España) issued a [[fatwa]], or religious opinion, denouncing [[Osama bin Laden]] and [[al-Qaeda]] for engaging in istihlal with respect to the waging of [[jihad]] through [[terrorism]], and the killing of women, children, and noncombatants. &lt;ref name=CNN2005&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/03/11/madrid.anniversary/ |title=Bin Laden fatwa as Spain remembers |ref=CNN2005 |accessdate=2005-08-17 |publisher=[[Cable News Network|CNN]] |date=2005-03-11 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050711083154/http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/03/11/madrid.anniversary/ |archivedate=2005-07-11 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relevant passages from the fatwa are as follows: &lt;ref name=webislam&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webislam.com/?idn=399 |title=La Comisión Islámica de España emite una fatua condenando el terrorismo y al grupo Al Qaida |accessdate=2008-08-30 |publisher=WebIslam Comunidad Virtual |language=Spanish |date=2005-03-05 }} Full text of the fatwa issued by La Comisión Islámica de España against Osama bin Laden and Al Qa'ida.&lt;/ref&gt;

:''Que según la Sharia, todo aquel que declara ''halal'' o permitido lo que Dios ha declarado ''haram'' o prohibido, como es matar a personas inocentes en atentados terroristas, se convierte en ''Kafir Murtadd Mustahlil'', es decir en apóstata, por haber pretendido hacer ''halal'' (''istihlal'') el asesinato de inocentes, crimen que el Sagrado Corán y la Sunna del Profeta Muhammad, Dios le bendiga y salve, prohíben expresamente.''

:''En tanto que Osama ben Laden y su organización defienden la legalidad del terrorismo y pretenden fundamentarla en el sagrado Corán y la Sunna, están cometiendo delito de ''istihlal'' y se convierten ipso facto en apóstatas (''kafir murtadd''), que no deben ser considerados musulmanes ni ser tratados como tales.''

:''That according to the [[Sharia]], anyone who declares ''[[halaal]]'', or permitted, what God has declared ''[[haraam]]'', or forbidden, such as the killing of innocent persons in terrorist attacks, turns into a ''[[Kafir]] [[Murtadd]] Mustahlil'', that is to say, an [[apostate]], by having claimed to make ''[[halal]]'' (''istihlal'') the murder of innocents, a crime that the Holy [[Qur'an]] and the [[Sunnah]] of the Prophet [[Muhammad]] (may God bless and save him) expressly forbid.''

:''Insofar as Osama bin Laden and his organization defend the legality of terrorism and claim to base it in the Holy Qur'an and the Sunnah, they are committing the sin of ''istihlal'' and become ipso facto apostates (''kafir murtadd''), who should not be considered [[Muslims]] nor be treated as such.''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9181">Following is a '''list of public domain works with multimedia adaptations'''. This lists includes works for which installments exist in multiple forms of [[Media (communication)|media]], such as [[book]]s, [[comic book]]s, [[films]], [[television series]], and [[video game]]s. Multimedia franchises usually develop through a character or fictional world becoming popular in one media, and then expanding to others through [[licensing agreement]]s, with respect to [[intellectual property]] in the franchise's characters and settings. With respect to [[public domain]] works, however, adaptations or extensions of the original work may be done without the permission of the author.

In order to qualify for purposes of this list, the original media must have originated from the work of an identifiable author or set of co-authors, and must have been adapted into works in at least '''three''' forms of media, and must have two or more separate works in at least '''two''' of those forms of media (a television series or comic book series is considered a single work for purposes of this list; multiple spin-off series or remakes of a previously ended series are considered multiple works). For example, a novel that spawned one film and one television series would not qualify; a series of novels made into a television series that had a spin-off series, or was remade as a new series, and which also spawned one film, does qualify.

All of these works arise in literature, because there are far fewer works in any other media in the public domain. Although many historical figures (such as [[Abraham Lincoln]], [[Julius Caesar]], and [[Casanova]]) and historical events (such as the sinking of the ''[[Titanic]]'') have been portrayed in multiple media, with fictionalized elements, these people and events are not themselves "works", and therefore do not fall within the scope of this list.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1108">[[Estonia]]'s '''Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act''', passed on June 11, 1997, is a law designed to fulfill  that country's treaty obligations under the [[Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs]], the [[Convention on Psychotropic Substances]], and the [[United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances]]. The Act establishes four Schedules of drugs. Schedule I comprises "narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances the handling of which is prohibited in Estonia except in the cases prescribed by law." Schedules II, III, IV comprise [[prescription drug]]s.

The Act divides [[wiktionary:Precursor|precursor]]s into two categories: Schedule I (bases) and Schedule II ([[reagent]]s).

The Act provides for drug addiction prevention and treatment, including [[involuntary hospitalization]].

The '''neutral powers''' were countries that remained [[Neutral country|neutral]] during [[World War II]]. Some of these countries had large colonies abroad or had great economic power. Spain had just been through [[Spanish Civil War|its civil war]], which ended on 1 April 1939 (five months prior to the [[Invasion of Poland]])—a war that involved several countries that subsequently [[Participants in World War II|participated in World War II]].

During World War II, the neutral powers took no official side, hoping to avoid attack. However, Portugal, Sweden, Colombia, and Switzerland all helped the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Powers]] by supplying "voluntary" brigades {{citation needed|date=August 2018}} to the [[United Kingdom]], while Spain avoided the Allies in favor of the [[Axis Powers|Axis]]. Ireland generally favoured the Allied side, as with the United States. The United States remained neutral until December 8, 1941, a day following the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|sneak attack by Japan on Pearl Harbor]].

The [[Lateran Treaty]] between Italy and the Vatican, signed in 1929, required that the Pope maintain "perpetual neutrality in international relations"—making the [[Vatican City]] a neutral state.

Several countries suffered invasions in spite of their efforts to be neutral. These included [[Nazi Germany]]'s [[Occupation of Denmark|invasion of Denmark]] [[Occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany|and Norway]] on 9 April 1940—[[Battle of Belgium|then Belgium]], [[History of the Netherlands (1939–1945)|the Netherlands]], [[German occupation of Luxembourg in World War II|and Luxembourg]] on 10 May 1940. On the same day, 10 May 1940, the British [[Invasion of Iceland|invaded Iceland]] and established an occupying force ([[Invasion of Iceland#United States occupation force|subsequently replaced]] by the then-neutral United States). In the eastern Baltic, the Soviet Union [[Occupation of the Baltic states|invaded Lithuania]] on 15 June 1940 and [[Occupation of the Baltic states|Latvia and Estonia]] on 17 June. In the Balkans, the [[Italo-Greek War]] began on 28 October 1940 and [[invasion of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia was invaded]] in April 1941. Iran was also [[Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran|attacked and occupied]] by Britain and the Soviet Union in August 1941.

==Continent== 
===Europe===

====Ireland====
{{Main|Irish neutrality during World War II}}
{{See also|Bombing of Dublin in World War II}}

*{{Flag|Ireland}} – The policy of [[Irish neutrality]] during [[World War II]] was adopted by the [[Oireachtas]] (legislature of [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]) at the instigation of [[Éamon de Valera]], the [[Taoiseach]] ([[head of government]]) upon the outbreak of hostilities in Europe. It was maintained throughout the conflict, in spite of [[Bombing of Dublin in World War II|several German air raids]] (understood to be by aircraft that missed their intended targets in Britain or Northern Ireland) and [[MV Kerlogue|attacks on Ireland's shipping fleet by Allies and Axis alike]]. De Valera refrained from joining either the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] or [[Axis powers of World War II|Axis powers]].

====Portugal====
{{Main|Portugal in World War II}}

*{{Flag|Estado Novo (Portugal)|name=Portugal}} – Portugal was officially neutral during the World War II. However, it maintained a close relationship with the UK, due to the [[Anglo-Portuguese Alliance|alliance]] it had for the last six hundred years, which is the longest lasting military alliance in history. The [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] sought neutrality as a strategy to keep Spain neutral and prevent it from joining the Axis. Portugal continued trading with countries from both sides of the conflict throughout the war. In the second half of the war, it let the Allies use bases in the [[Azores]] to fight German submarines, because Salazar feared already an allied invasion over the Azores.

====Spain====
{{Main|Spain in World War II}}

*{{Flag|Spanish State|1938|name=Spain}} – Franco sent the [[Division Azul|Blue Division]] to fight for the Axis on the Eastern Front.

====Sweden====
{{Main|Sweden during World War II}}

*{{Flag|Sweden}} – The Swedish government supported Finland during the [[Winter War]]. The later [[transit of German troops through Finland and Sweden]] and [[Swedish iron-ore mining during World War II]] helped the German war effort. During the [[Liberation of Finnmark]] it sent [[Norwegian police troops in Sweden during World War II|Norwegian "police" troops]] over the border to link up with [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] forces. At the end of the war it was preparing to invade Norway and Denmark with the Allies should the occupying Wehrmacht forces refuse to accept a general German armistice.

====Switzerland====
{{Main|Switzerland during the World Wars}}

*{{Flag|Switzerland}} – Switzerland maintained its neutrality so as to protect its own [[Banking in Switzerland|banking interests]] from plunder by the Axis. It also depended on German coal, with 10 million tons imported during the war, making up 41% of Swiss energy supplies. Often, Swiss soldiers opened fire on Axis bombers invading their [[airspace]]. On several occasions, Switzerland also shot down Allied planes. Throughout the war, cities in Switzerland were "accidentally" bombed by both Axis and Allied airplanes. [[Adolf Hitler]] did indeed [[Operation Tannenbaum|plan to invade Switzerland]], but Switzerland [[National Redoubt (Switzerland)|had formed complex fortifications]] and amassed hundreds of thousands of soldiers in the mountains to thwart any Axis invasion. Because of the extreme mountainous conditions in Switzerland, Hitler decided to [[Battle of Britain|bombard the United Kingdom]] rather than engage in a costly war with Switzerland.

====Lithuania====
{{Main|Resistance in Lithuania during World War II}}

*{{Flag|Lithuania}} – Lithuania, along with its [[Baltic states|Baltic]] neighbours [[Latvia]] and [[Estonia]], jointly declared their neutrality on November 18, 1938, in [[Riga]], at the Conference of Baltic Foreign Ministers with their respective parliaments passing neutrality laws later that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Liekis|first1=Šarūnas|title=1939: The Year that Changed Everything in Lithuania's History|date=2010|publisher=Rodopi|location=New York|isbn=978-9042027626|pages=119–122|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ST3LrBPOM4gC&amp;pg=PA120&amp;lpg=PA120&amp;dq=Lithuanian+Neutrality+Law#v=onepage&amp;q=Lithuanian%20Neutrality%20Law&amp;f=false|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite that, [[Occupation of the Baltic states|all three Baltic states were occupied]] twice by the [[Soviet Union]] and once by [[Nazi Germany]].

====Latvia====

*{{Flag|Latvia}} – Latvia, along with its [[Baltic states|Baltic]] neighbours [[Lithuania]] and [[Estonia]], jointly declared their neutrality on November 18, 1938, in [[Riga]], at the Conference of Baltic Foreign Ministers with their respective parliaments passing neutrality laws later that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Neiburgs|first1=Uldis|title=Soviet occupation|url=http://okupacijasmuzejs.lv/en/history/1-soviet-occupation/latvia-during-world-war-ii|website=Latvijas Okupācijas muzejs|accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite that, [[Occupation of the Baltic states|all three Baltic states were occupied]] twice by the [[Soviet Union]] and once by [[Nazi Germany]].

====Estonia====
{{Main|Estonia in World War II}}

*{{Flag|Estonia}} – Estonia, along with its [[Baltic states|Baltic]] neighbours [[Lithuania]] and [[Latvia]], jointly declared their neutrality on November 18, 1938, in [[Riga]], at the Conference of Baltic Foreign Ministers with their respective parliaments passing neutrality laws later that year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.letton.ch/lvx_38.htm Estonian Neutrality Law of December lst, 1938]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite that, [[Occupation of the Baltic states|all three Baltic states were occupied]] twice by the [[Soviet Union]] and once by [[Nazi Germany]].

===Asia===
====Afghanistan====
*{{Flag|Kingdom of Afghanistan|1931|name=Afghanistan}} remained neutral throughout World War II.

====Iran====
*{{Flag|Iran}}, see [[Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran]] even though was neutral but occupied by Allies.

====Saudi Arabia====

* {{Flag|Saudi Arabia|1938}} severed diplomatic contacts with Germany on 11 September 1939, and with Japan in October 1941. Although officially neutral, the Saudis provided the Allies with large supplies of oil. Diplomatic relations with the United States were established in 1943. [[Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia|King Abdul Aziz Al-Saud]] was a personal friend of Franklin D. Roosevelt. The Americans were then allowed to build an air force base near [[Dhahran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|page=382|title=The Asian Century: A History of Modern Nationalism in Asia|author=Jan Romein|publisher=University of California Press|date=1962}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saudi Arabia declared war on Germany on 28 February 1945  and Japan on 1 April 1945, but no military actions resulted from the declaration.

====Tibet====
*{{Flag|Tibet|1912}} ([[Tibet (1912–51)|unrecognised]]; claimed by China but ''de facto'' independent), remained neutral throughout [[World War II]]

====Turkey====
{{Main|Single-party period of the Republic of Turkey#1938–1950: İnönü (National Chief)|History of the Republic of Turkey#World War II}}

*{{Flag|Turkey}} was neutral until several months before the end of the war, at which point it joined the Allies.  Prior to the outbreak of war, Turkey signed a Mutual Aid Pact with France and Britain in 1939.  After the German invasion of France, however, Turkey remained neutral, relying on a clause excusing them if military action might bring conflict with the USSR, which, after the division of Poland, Turkey feared. Then, in June 1941, after  neighbouring Bulgaria joined the Axis and allowed Germany to move troops through to invade [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] and [[Battle of Greece|Greece]], Turkey signed a [[German–Turkish Treaty of Friendship|treaty of friendship]] with Germany.  Turkey was an important producer of [[chromite]] — a key ingredient in the manufacture of [[stainless steel]] and [[refractory brick]] — to which the Germans had limited access.  Sale of chromite to Germany or to the Allies (who had access to other sources, and mainly bought Turkish chromite in order to preclude its sale to Germany) was the key issue in Turkey's negotiations with both sides. Turkey halted its sales to Germany in April 1944 and broke off relations in August.  In February 1945, after the Allies made its invitation to the inaugural meeting of the United Nations (along with the invitations of several other nations) conditional on full belligerency, Turkey declared war on the Axis powers, but no Turkish troops ever saw combat.

====Yemen====

*{{Flag|Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen|name=Yemen}} remained neutral throughout World War II

==Conclusion==
Portugal, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland held to the concept of [[armed neutrality]], and continuously amassed soldiers to defend their nation's [[sovereignty]] from potential invasion. Thus, they maintained the right to become belligerent if attacked while in a state of neutrality. The concept of ''neutrality in [[war]]'' is narrowly defined and puts specific constraints on the neutral party in return for the internationally recognized right to remain neutral. A wider concept is that of [[non-belligerence]]. The basic [[international law]] covering [[Neutral territory|neutral territories]] is the [[Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)|Second Hague Convention]]. It is important to note that a ''neutral country'' takes no side in a war between other parties, and in return hopes to avoid being attacked by either of them. A ''neutralist policy'' aims at neutrality in case of an armed conflict that could involve the party in question. A ''neutralist'' is an advocate of neutrality in [[international relations|international affairs]]. The concept of ''neutrality in conflicts'' is distinct from [[Non-Aligned Movement|non-alignment]], i.e., the willful desistance from [[military alliance]]s in order to preserve neutrality in case of war, and perhaps with the hope of preventing a war altogether.

In a study of Spain, Switzerland and Sweden during WWII, Eric Golson found that they engaged in economic [[realpolitik]], as they traded with both the Axis and the Allied Powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Economic History of Warfare and State Formation|last=Golson|first=Eric|date=2016|publisher=Springer, Singapore|isbn=9789811016042|series=Studies in Economic History|pages=259–278|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-981-10-1605-9_11|chapter = Neutrality in War}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2547">'''Operation Falcon''' was an undercover operation conducted by the [[US Fish and Wildlife Service]] (USFWS) and the [[Canadian Wildlife Service]] from 1982–1984.  The investigation into the illegal sale of [[Endangered Species Act|federally protected birds]] resulted in 63 people being tried or taking a plea bargain.  Of the cases that went to trial, there were 5 [[acquittal]]s, 5 [[felony]] convictions, 44 [[misdemeanor]] convictions and 1 [[lawsuit|civil]] conviction.&lt;ref name="blade-saudi"&gt;{{cite news|date=November 17, 1984|newspaper=The Blade|location=Toledo|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=XBMVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=wQIEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6912,7830805&amp;dq=operation+falcon&amp;hl=en|title=Canadian Says He Sold Rare Falcons to Saudi Royal Family|author=N.Y.

The party was established in July 2009. The first [[Party leader|leader]] of the party was Andrew Robinson, who stepped down in August 2010. [[Loz Kaye|Laurence "Loz" Kaye]] was elected to replace him in September 2010, and served until after the [[United Kingdom general election, 2015|2015 general election]], when he stepped down.&lt;ref name=moving&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kaye|first1=Loz|authorlink1=Loz Kaye|title=Moving On|url=https://pirateparty.org.uk/blogs/loz-kaye/moving|website=Pirate Party UK|accessdate=5 August 2015|date=9 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Kaye's resignation, a leadership election was held, with Cris Chesha being elected leader and David A Elston being elected the party's first deputy leader.&lt;ref name=new&gt;{{cite web|title=Pirate Party UK announces appointments to the NEC, and Board of Governors|url=https://www.pirateparty.org.uk/press/pirate-party-uk-announces-appointments-nec-and-board-governors|website=Pirate Party UK|accessdate=9 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Following [[The Pirate Bay trial]], a large surge in Pirate Party interest occurred around the world. After the success of the [[Pirate Party (Sweden)|Swedish Pirate Party]] in the summer [[European Parliament election, 2009|2009 European election]]s, there was a sudden growth of Pirate Party organisations across Europe (notably in Germany and France) and beyond. Forum membership soared. The official formation of the Pirate Party in the UK followed shortly after the European elections&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2009-06/08/pirate-party-wins-european-parliament-seat.aspx|title=Pirate Party wins European Parliament seat|last=Scott|first=Katie|date=8 June 2009|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] UK|accessdate=17 August 2009}}&lt;br&gt;- {{Cite news|url=http://www.revolutionmagazine.com/news/911708/Pirate-Bay-fans-voice-copyright-issues/|title=Pirate Bay fans get voice on copyright issues|last=McCormick|first=Andrew|date=8 June 2009|work=Revolution |publisher=[[Brand Republic]]|accessdate=17 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Pirate Party UK was officially registered on 30 July 2009.&lt;ref name="registered_party"&gt;{{cite web| title = Register of political parties, Pirate Party UK| publisher = [[The Electoral Commission]]| url = http://registers.electoralcommission.org.uk/regulatory-issues/regpoliticalparties.cfmfrmGB=1&amp;frmPartyID=900&amp;frmType=partydetail| accessdate = 3 February 2010}}{{Dead link |date=June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/8199143.stm|title=Pirate Party launches UK poll bid |date=13 August 2009|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=17 August 2009}}&lt;br&gt;- {{Cite news|url=http://www.techradar.com/news/internet/pirate-party-uk-sets-sail-624848|title=Pirate Party UK sets sail|last=Harris|first=Mark|date=11 August 2009|work=[[TechRadar]]|publisher=[[Future plc]]|accessdate=17 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2009, it was claimed that Pirate Party UK was undergoing rapid growth similar to one the Swedish Pirate Party had enjoyed in early 2009. It was reported that it had been flooded with enquiries and at its peak around 100 people an hour were signing up to become party members. Donations had been coming in so fast that [[PayPal]] was concerned it was a fraudulent site.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/6027919/Hundred-people-an-hour-joining-Pirate-Party-UK.html|title='Hundred people an hour' joining Pirate Party UK|first=Emma|last=Barnett|accessdate=13 August 2009|date=13 August 2009|publisher= |website=[[Telegraph.co.uk]] |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 March 2010, the party declared its intent to stand ten candidates across England and Scotland. However, to do so, further party funding would be required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pirateparty.org.uk/press/pirate-party-uk-announces-parliamentary-candidates|title=PPUK Announces Parliamentary Candidates|publisher=Pirate Party UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 April 2010, the party announced that it had nine official candidates on the ballot papers, as Mark Sims had missed the deadline because of the [[air travel disruption after the 2010 Eyjafjallajökull eruption]]. Following the resignation of first party leader Andrew Robinson,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pirateparty.org.uk/blog/editor/pirate-party-uk-one-year|title=The Pirate Party UK, One Year On|publisher=Pirate Party UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; the composer and lecturer [[Loz Kaye|Laurence "Loz" Kaye]] was elected as the new leader on 26 September 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2010-09/28/pirate-party-leader|title=Loz Kaye elected leader of UK Pirate Party|work=[[Wired News]]|publisher=}}&lt;br /&gt;- {{cite web|url=https://www.pirateparty.org.uk/blog/editor/pirate-party-elects-new-leader|title=Pirate Party Elects New Leader'|publisher=Pirate Party UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a message sent to members, Kaye stated his key aim as "building the political structure of the party".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pirateparty.org.uk/blog/lozkaye/message-new-leader|title=A Message From the New Leader|publisher=Pirate Party UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, Kaye had been the election agent for candidate Tim Dobson who stood for Pirate Party UK in [[Manchester Gorton]].

In the run-up to the [[United Kingdom general election, 2015|2015 general election]], the Pirate Party [[crowdsourced]] its [[manifesto]] using [[Reddit]]. The process ran until 21 March 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dazeddigital.com/artsandculture/article/23927/1/pirate-party-is-crowdsourcing-its-manifesto-on-reddit|title=Pirate Party is crowdsourcing its manifesto on Reddit|last1=Gorton|first1=Thomas|work=Dazed|accessdate=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kaye stepped down as leader following the 2015 general election in May.&lt;ref name="moving" /&gt; With the role of deputy leader also being vacant, George Walkden, the party's nominating officer, was approved by the board of governors to serve as an interim leader until the party elected a new leader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pirateparty.org.uk/be-part-new-pirate-crew |title=Be a part of the new Pirate crew! |publisher=The Pirate Party |date= |accessdate=3 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the leadership election, Cris Chesha was elected leader of the party and David Elston was elected the first deputy leader. Six new governors were elected, with six governors being re-elected. Rebecca Rae was elected to the role of campaigns officer on the NEC.&lt;ref name="new" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Internal election results July 2015|url=https://community.pirateparty.org.uk/discussion/227/internal-election-results-july-2015|website=Pirate Party UK|accessdate=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 June, [[Andrew Norton (Pirate Party)|Andrew Norton]] stepped down as chair of the board, and was replaced by the deputy chair of the board, Andrew Robinson, the leader of the party from 2009 to 2010. On 29 July 2015, Will Tovey was elected as the next deputy chair of the board to replace Robinson. Will Tovey subsequently became chair of the board, and Adrian Farrel replaced him on 14 December 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Board|url=https://www.pirateparty.org.uk/party/how-we-work/board|website=Pirate Party UK|accessdate=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party's extended period without an elected NEC caught the attention of larger media outlets in October 2016 where Kaye and Elston gave comment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arstechnica.co.uk/features/2016/10/pirate-party-growing-pains/|title=Pirate Party growing pains: Murder-suicide, a fetish model, and Alþingi|website=Ars Technica|publisher=David Meyeer|accessdate=24 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pirate Party Wales====
Pirate Party Wales ({{lang-cy|Plaid Môr-leidr Cymru}}) is a branch of the Pirate Party UK that covers the entirety of Wales and was founded in 2014 by David Anthony Elston. Pirate Party Wales supports increased recognition of the [[Welsh language]], including reform of the [[Welsh Language Act 1993]] and free Welsh courses for all Welsh nationals. It also supports further [[devolution]] to Wales and increased powers for the [[Welsh Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pirate Party Wales: We need to become a digital dragon|url=http://dailywales.net/2015/01/07/pirate-party-wales-we-need-to-become-a-digital-dragon/|accessdate=14 April 2015|work=The Daily Wales|date=7 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only candidate to have stood in Wales so far is Elston who stood in [[Bridgend (UK Parliament constituency)|Bridgend]] in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2015|2015 general election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bridgend Constituency|url=https://wales.pirateparty.org.uk/spokesperson-for-wales/bridgend/|website=Pirate Party Wales|accessdate=14 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== International affiliation ===
On 25 February 2015, the Pirate Party UK announced its withdrawal from its international affiliation, [[Pirate Party International]]. This announcement, consolidated by a vote of the board, followed [[Pirate Party Australia]]'s decision to leave earlier in the same month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pirateparty.org.uk/blogs/editor/ppuk-leaves-ppi|title=PPUK leaves PPI|website=Pirate Party UK|accessdate=28 May 2015}}&lt;br /&gt;- {{cite news|url=http://piratetimes.net/ppuk-bids-farewell-to-ppi-guest-post/|title=PPUK Bids Farewell to PPI|last1=Halsall|first1=Andy|date=26 February 2015|work=Pirate Times|accessdate=28 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Election results==
{{Main|Pirate Party UK election results}}
It has previously been noted by Robinson, the first Pirate Party UK leader, that the Pirate Party UK's chances of getting a candidate elected to the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|UK parliament]] are "pretty much close to zero", because of the [[first past the post]] system for electing MPs to Parliament. Instead, its immediate aim is to raise awareness among voters and politicians in the other political parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pcpro.co.uk/news/interviews/350728/q-a-why-the-uk-needs-the-pirate-party|title=Q&amp;A: Why the UK needs the Pirate Party|last=Turton|first=Stuart|date=12 August 2009|work=[[PC Pro]]|accessdate=17 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pirate Party UK contested its first election in 2010, standing nine candidates in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 general election]]. The party also stood candidates in the [[Oldham East and Saddleworth by-election, 2011|2011 Oldham East and Saddleworth]] and [[Manchester Central by-election, 2012|2012 Manchester Central]] by-elections. The party also contested several [[Local government in the United Kingdom|local government]] elections and the [[Scottish Parliament election, 2011|2011 Scottish Parliament election]]. The party stood six candidates in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2015|2015 general election]], and ten in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2017|2017 snap general election]]. In general elections, none of its candidates has ever received more than one percent of the vote.

The '''Placitum of Riziano''' ({{lang-it|Placito del Risano}}) was a dispute that took place c. 804 around the river Riziano, probably at [[Rižana]] in modern [[Slovenia]]. Legates sent by [[Charlemagne]] heard complaints by the leaders of [[Istria]] about the bishops and the duke of Istria, John. It is an important document for Istrian history. The document is believed to have been recorded on the orders of Fortunatus II, [[patriarch of Grado]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Krahwinkler |first1=Harald |date=25 April 2005 |title= Patriarch Fortunatus of Grado and the Placitum of Riziano |url=https://repozitorij.upr.si/IzpisGradiva.php?id=5381&amp;lang=eng |journal=[[''Acta Histriae'']] |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=63-78 |publisher=Annales Publishing House|doi= |access-date=24 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A point of historiographical contention is the fact that only the leaders of the coastal towns of Istria were present; one explanation for this is that the issues being discussed (for example, the abolition of the right of the [[townspeople]] to fish) only affected the coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.istrianet.org/istria/history/0000-0999AD/0804_placito/index.htm |title=Placito del Risano - 804 A.D.|last= |first= |date=20 March 2016 |website=&lt;nowiki&gt;IstriaNet.org&lt;/nowiki&gt; |publisher= |access-date= 24 November 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Latin text has been edited many times, but the standard edition is by Manaresi &lt;ref&gt;  ''I placiti del Regnum Italiae'', ed. C. Manaresi (Rome, 1955), vol. I, no. 17, pp. 48-56 &lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Proxy voting''' is a form of [[voting]] whereby a member of a decision-making body may delegate his or her voting power to a representative, to enable a vote in absence. The representative may be another member of the same body, or external. A person so designated is called a "proxy" and the person designating him or her is called a "principal". Proxy appointments can be used to form a [[voting bloc]] that can exercise greater influence in [[deliberation]]s or [[negotiation]]s.  Proxy voting is a particularly important practice with respect to corporations; in the United States, investment advisers often vote proxies on behalf of their client accounts.&lt;ref&gt;Lemke and Lins, ''Regulation of Investment Advisers'' (Thomson West, 2017 ed.).&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States parliamentary manual ''[[Riddick's Rules of Procedure]]'' notes that, under proxy voting, voting for officers should be done by ballot, due to the difficulties involved in authentication if a member simply calls out, "I cast 17 votes for Mr. X."&lt;ref name=RID&gt;{{cite parl|title=RID|pages=155–156|year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proxy voting is also an important feature in [[corporate governance]] through the [[proxy statement]]. Companies use proxy solicitation agencies like Boudicca Proxy Consultants to secure proxy votes.

==Legislatures==
The rules of some assemblies presently forbid proxy voting. For example, in both houses of the U.S. Congress, as well as in most if not all state legislatures, each member must be present and cast his own vote for that vote to be counted. This can result, however, in the absence of a quorum and the need to compel attendance by a sufficient number of missing members to get a quorum. See ''[[call of the house]]''.

It is possible for automatic proxy voting to be used in legislatures, by way of [[direct representation]] (this idea is essentially a form of [[Weighted voting]]). For example, it has been proposed that instead of electing members from single-member districts (that may have been [[gerrymander]]ed), members be elected at large, but when seated each member cast the number of votes he or she received in the last election. Thus, if, for example, a state were allocated 32 members in the U.S. House of Representatives, the 32 candidates who received the most votes in the at-large election would be seated, but each would cast a different number of votes on the floor and in committee. This proposal would allow for representation of minority views in legislative deliberations, as it does in deliberations at shareholder meetings of corporations.  Such a concept was proposed in a submission to the 2007 Ontario Citizens' Assembly process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citizensassembly.gov.on.ca/documents/633009991417391250_WVSubmissionNov12_0.pdf|title=Submission to Ontario Citizens' Assembly}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two real-life examples of weighted voting include the [[Council of Ministers of the European Union]] and the [[US Electoral College]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whfreeman.com/college/pdfs/comappdfs/CoMap_c11.pdf |title=Article on Weighted Voting describing US Electoral College as an example }}{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Parliament of New Zealand]] allows proxy voting. Sections 155-156 of the Standing Orders of the [[New Zealand House of Representatives]] specify the procedures for doing so. A member can designate another member or a party to cast his vote. However, a party may not exercise proxies for more than 25% of its members (rounded upwards).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.nz/NR/rdonlyres/078D6043-9E03-4D87-93BA-A6BB84ACC063/6619/standingorders20095.pdf|title=Standing Orders of the House of Representatives|publisher=New Zealand House of Representatives|date=2005-08-12|accessdate=2008-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[New Zealand Listener]]'' notes a controversial occurrence of proxy voting. The [[Labour Party (New Zealand)|Labour Party]] was allowed to cast votes on behalf of [[Taito Phillip Field]], who was frequently absent. Theoretically, this was to be allowed only if a legislator was absent on parliamentary business, public business or pressing private business, such as illness or bereavement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.listener.co.nz/issue/3486/columnists/8250/nice_gig_for_some.html|title=Nice Gig for Some|author=Clifton, Jane|publisher=New Zealand Listener|date=March 2007|accessdate=2008-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] reforms of 1995 banished the practice, proxy voting was also used in [[U.S. House of Representatives]] committees. Often members would delegate their vote to the ranking member of their party in the committee. Republicans opposed proxy voting on the grounds that it allowed an indolent Democratic majority to move legislation through committee with antimajoritarian procedures. That is, the Democratic leader in the committee would successfully oppose the sitting Republican majority by wielding the proxies of absent Democrats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=wvtv7Dhc7DwC&amp;pg=PA35&amp;dq=%22proxy+voting%22 |title=Participation in Congress - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-18 | first=Richard L. | last=Hall | isbn=978-0-300-06811-5|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas E. Mann and Norman J. Ornstein write, "In a large and fragmented institution in which every member has five or six places to be at any given moment, proxy voting is a necessary evil".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=xdiv1tM4qWQC&amp;pg=PA39&amp;dq=%22proxy+voting%22 |title=A first report of the Renewing ... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-18 | first1=Thomas E. | last1=Mann | first2=Norman J. | last2=Ornstein | isbn=978-0-8157-5457-2|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Elections==
Proxy voting is sometimes described as "the frequency with which spouses, union workers, and friends of friends are in effect sent off to the polls with an assignment to complete." The potential for proxy voting exists in roughly one voter out of five, and it is about twice as high at the middle levels of the sophistication continuum. According to W. Russell Neuman, the net effect of the cues provided by friends and associates is not likely to be as significant as those of the political parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=wsJw8qPfpJAC&amp;pg=PA90&amp;dq=%22proxy+voting%22 |title=The paradox of mass politics ... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-18 | isbn=978-0-674-65460-0|year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The possibility of expanded use of proxy voting has been the subject of much speculation. Terry F. Buss et al. write that [[internet voting]] would result in de facto approval of proxy voting, since passwords could be shared with others: "Obviously, cost-benefit calculations around the act of voting could also change substantially as organizations attempt to identify and provide inducements to control proxy votes without violating vote-buying prohibitions in the law."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Modernizing Democracy|pages=208–209|url=https://books.google.com/?id=FlhFdTRCzOEC&amp;pg=PA209&amp;lpg=PA209&amp;dq=%2B%22proxy+voting%22+%2Bdemocracy|author1=Terry F. Buss |author2=F. Stevens Redburn |author3=Kristina Guo | isbn=978-0-7656-1763-7 | year=2006 | publisher=M.E. Sharpe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the criticisms of proxy voting is that it carries a risk of fraud or intimidation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=NREXAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%2B%22proxy+voting%22+%2Belectoral&amp;dq=%2B%22proxy+voting%22+%2Belectoral |title=Democracy at the polls: a ... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date=2003-10-03 |accessdate=2010-03-18 | first1=David | last1=Butler | isbn=978-0-8447-3405-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another criticism is that it violates the concept of a secret ballot, in that paperwork may be filed, for instance, designating a party worker as one's proxy.&lt;ref name=realising&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=q0K4FbD-B6kC&amp;pg=PA55&amp;dq=%2B%22proxy+voting%22+%2Belectoral |title=Realising democracy: electoral law ... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= November 2003|accessdate=2010-03-18 | first=Graeme | last=Orr | isbn=978-1-86287-481-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been proposed that proxy voting be combined with [[Initiatives and referendums in the United States|initiative and referendum]] to form a hybrid of [[direct democracy]] and [[representative democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://larson2008.com/wiki/index.php5?title%3DProxy_voting accessed October 21, 2008] {{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://makethecase.net/wiki/Referendums_with_local-member_proxy_voting_would_improve_governance |title=Referendums with local-member proxy voting would improve governance |publisher=MakeTheCase |date=2008-09-15 |accessdate=2010-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=June 2010}}
[[James C. Miller III]], [[Ronald Reagan]]'s budget director, suggested scrapping representative democracy and instead implementing a "program for direct and proxy voting in the legislative process."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/p5v2q4v611549777/ |title= A program for direct and proxy voting in the legislative process|publisher=SpringerLink |date= |accessdate=2010-03-18 |doi=10.1007/BF01718736 |volume=7-7 |journal=Public Choice |pages=107–113}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested by Joseph Francis Zimmerman that proxy voting be allowed in [[New England town meeting]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=y9lQ0hZQxhEC&amp;pg=PA179&amp;dq=%2B%22proxy+voting%22+%2Bdemocracy |title=The New England town meeting ... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-18 | isbn=978-0-275-96523-5|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proxy voting can eliminate some of the problems associated with the [[public choice]] dilemma of [[bundling (public choice)|bundling]].

===Albania===
According to Arch Puddington et al., in Albanian Muslim areas, many women have been effectively disenfranchised through proxy voting by male relatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=xN5O15Xzm1cC&amp;pg=PA478&amp;dq=%2B%22referendum%22+%2B%22proxy+voting%22 |title=Freedom in the World: The Annual ... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date=2008-04-15 |accessdate=2010-03-18 | first=Arch | last=Puddington | isbn=978-0-7425-5897-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Algeria===
In Algeria, restrictions on proxy voting were instituted circa 1991 in order to undermine the [[Islamic Salvation Front]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ob9mn2RzL-4C&amp;pg=PA433&amp;dq=%2B%22proxy+voting%22+%2Belectoral |title=The government and politics of the ... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-18 | first1=David E. | last1=Long | first2=Bernard | last2=Reich | isbn=978-0-8133-3899-6|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
In Canada, the province of Nova Scotia allows citizens to vote by proxy if they expect to be absent. The Territories of Yukon, Northwest Territories, and Nunavut also allow for proxy voting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elections.ca/loi/com2000/Voting/vot06_e.html |title=Compendium of Election Administration in Canada |publisher=Elections.ca |date= |accessdate=2010-03-18 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080316163259/http://www.elections.ca/loi/com2000/Voting/vot06_e.html |archivedate=2008-03-16 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Canadian prisoners of war in enemy camps were allowed to vote through proxy voting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=IHA8h0QrAZwC&amp;pg=PA139&amp;dq=%22proxy+voting%22 |title=Establishing the rules of the game ... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-18 | first1=Louis | last1=Massicotte | first2=André | last2=Blais | first3=Antoine | last3=Yoshinaka | isbn=978-0-8020-8564-1|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Stewart and Keith Archer opine that proxy voting can result in leadership selection processes to become leader-dominated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=xsa4vhIak-YC&amp;pg=PA91&amp;dq=%2B%22proxy+voting%22+%2B%22electoral+reform%22 |title=Quasi-Democracy: Parties and ... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= 2001-02-01|accessdate=2010-03-18 | first1=David | last1=Stewart | first2=Keith | last2=Archer | isbn=978-0-7748-0791-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proxy voting had only been available to military personnel since World War II, but was extended in 1970 and 1977 to include voters in special circumstances such as northern camp operators, fishermen, and prospectors. The [[Alberta Liberal Party]] ran into some difficulties, in that an unknown number of proxy ballots that were counted may have been invalid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=VYbGRUp2YV0C&amp;pg=PA34&amp;dq=%2B%22proxy+voting%22+%2Belectoral |title=Elections - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= 2005-01-01|accessdate=2010-03-18 | first=John C. | last=Courtney | isbn=978-0-7748-0918-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who, through proxy voting or assistance of invalids, become knowledgeable of the principal's choice are bound to secrecy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=GLcsAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%2B%22proxy+voting%22+%2Belectoral&amp;dq=%2B%22proxy+voting%22+%2Belectoral |title=Political rights: the legal ... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date=2007-03-02 |accessdate=2010-03-18 | isbn=978-0-409-81601-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===
Some [[Chinese provinces]] allow village residents to designate someone to vote on their behalf. Lily L. Tsai notes that "In practice, one family member often casts votes for everyone in the family even if they are present for the election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lily L. Tsai|page=207|title=Accountability Without Democracy: Solidary Groups and Public Goods Provision|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, a [[Carter Center]] delegation recommended abolishing the proxy voting that allowed one person to vote for three; the [[International Republican Institute]] had made a similar recommendation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=upDNEYtw4uYC&amp;pg=PA129&amp;dq=%2B%22proxy+voting%22+%2Belectoral |title=Elections and democracy in greater China - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-18 | first1=Larry | last1=Diamond | isbn=978-0-19-924417-1|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proxy voting also became an issue in relation to many of the [[Wenzhou]] people doing business outside.{{clarify|date=September 2015}} Most election disputes revolved around proxy votes, including the issues of who could represent them to vote and what kinds of evidence were acceptable for proxy voting. Intense competition made the proxy voting process more and more formal and transparent. Some villages required a [[notary]] to validate faxed proxy votes; some villages asked for [[fax]]ed signatures; more often villages publicized those proxy votes so that villagers could directly monitor them. [[Taicang]] government reported a 99.4% voter turnout in its 1997 election, but a study showed that after removing proxy votes, only 48% of the eligible voters in the sample reported that they actually went to the central polling station to vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=jvSNIhVzR9sC&amp;pg=PA208&amp;dq=%2B%22proxy+voting%22+%2Belectoral |title=Marketization and Democracy in China - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= 2008-04-28|accessdate=2010-03-18 | first=Jianjun | last=Zhang | isbn=978-0-415-45222-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gabon===
According to Mim Kelber, "in Central Africa, all it takes for a man to cast a proxy vote for his wife is to produce an unwitnessed letter mentioning the name of the person to whom the voting power is delegated." The Gabon respondent to an [[Inter-Parliamentary Union]] letter commented, "It has been observed that this possibility was exploited to a far greater extent by men than by women, for reasons not always noble."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=fXDV3HQTtPcC&amp;pg=PA11&amp;dq=%2B%22proxy+voting%22+%2Belectoral |title=Women and government: new ways to ... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-18 | first=Mim | last=Kelber | isbn=978-0-275-94816-0|year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Guyana===
Proxy voting played an important role in [[Guyana]] politics in the 1960s. Prior to and during the 1961 elections, proxies had been severely restricted. Some restrictions were lifted, and there was a rise in proxy votes cast from 300 in 1961 to 6,635 in 1964. After that election, the [[Commonwealth Team of Observers]] voiced concern about proxy votes being liable to fraud. The proxy voting rules were relaxed further, and in 1969, official figures recorded 19,287 votes cast by proxy, about 7% of the total votes cast (an increase from 2.5% in 1964 to 1968).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=NkPBlZDGYCkC&amp;pg=PA359&amp;dq=%2B%22proxy+voting%22+%2Belectoral |title=Elections in the Americas: a data ... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= 2005-06-03|accessdate=2010-03-18 | isbn=978-0-19-928357-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amidst allegations of fraud, more restrictions were placed on proxy voting in 1973; in that year, about 10,000 votes were cast by proxy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jagan.org/articles5i.htm |title=Virtual Army Coup In Guyana |author=Jagan, Cheddi |year=2000 |accessdate=2008-02-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080317025214/http://jagan.org/articles5i.htm |archivedate=2008-03-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===

In 2003, India's [[People's Representative Act]] was amended to allow armed forces personnel to appoint a proxy to vote on their behalf.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/2004/apr/23guest.htm|title=Democracy, bureaucracy and armed forces|author=Kolhe, Avinash|date=2004-04-23|publisher=Rediff|accessdate=2008-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iraq===
In Iraq, the Electoral Laws of 1924 and 1946 ruled out the possibility of proxy voting, except for illiterates, who could appoint someone to write for them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=BVFBXa69tWMC&amp;pg=PA89&amp;dq=%2B%22proxy+voting%22+%2Belectoral |title=Elections in Asia and the Pacific: A ... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-18 | isbn=978-0-19-924958-9|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russia===
Some instances of proxy voting (usually by family members) in the Russian parliamentary elections of 1995 were noted by observers from the [[Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=m0W9KIzhJysC&amp;pg=PA134&amp;dq=%2B%22proxy+voting%22+%2Belectoral |title=The Russian parliamentary elections ... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-18 | first1=Laura | last1=Belin | first2=Robert W. | last2=Orttung | isbn=978-0-7656-0084-4|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
The provision for proxy voting in the UK dates back to [[James I of England|James I]]. Long before [[women's suffrage]], women sometimes voted as proxies for absent male family heads.

Under British electoral law, ballot papers could not be sent overseas.&lt;ref name=realising/&gt; British expatriates had no right to vote until the mid-1980s. They can now vote by proxy in general elections if they have been on a British electoral register at some point in the past 15 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fairvote.org/?page=164&amp;articlemode=showspecific&amp;showarticle=133 |title=Overseas Voters |publisher=FairVote |date= |accessdate=2010-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; They can also vote by post.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aboutmyvote.co.uk/register_to_vote/british_citizens_living_abroad.aspx |title=British citizens living abroad - About my vote, produced by The Electoral Commission |publisher=Aboutmyvote.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-10-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110117185354/http://www.aboutmyvote.co.uk/register_to_vote/british_citizens_living_abroad.aspx |archivedate=2011-01-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, electors may appoint a proxy. An elector can only act as a proxy for two people to whom they are not directly related. However, they can be a proxy for any number of electors if they are directly related to those electors. The voter can change his mind and vote in the election personally as long as his proxy has not already voted on his behalf or applied to [[vote by mail]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spelthorne.gov.uk/cou_elections_absent_voting.htm|title=Absent Voting|publisher=Spelthorne Borough Council|year=2006|accessdate=2008-02-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080316124154/http://www.spelthorne.gov.uk/cou_elections_absent_voting.htm|archive-date=2008-03-16|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Voters must provide a reason for using a proxy, such as being away on vacation. A narrower subset of reasons is permissible if the proxy is to be for more than one election.

In 1635–36, Massachusetts granted to the frontier towns "liberty to stay soe many of their freemen at home for the safety of their towne as they judge needful, and that the said freemen that are appoyncted by the towne to stay at home shall have liberty for this court to send their voices by proxy." According to Charles Seymour and Donald Paige Frary, had not proxy voting been implemented, the inhabitants of the frontier towns would have lost their franchises, and the government would have represented only the freemen in the vicinity of Boston. The roads were poor; the drawing of all a village's men at once would have exposed it to Indian attacks; and at election time, the emigrants' labor was needed to get the spring planting into the ground. As late as 1680, and probably even after the charter was revoked in 1684, the Freeman might give his vote for Magistrates in person or proxy at the Court of Elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=77gVT0hwLFoC&amp;pg=PA87&amp;dq=%2B%22proxy+voting%22+%2Belectoral |title=Boston and its story, 1630-1915 - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date=1909-01-31 |accessdate=2010-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Maryland, the [[primary assembly|primary assemblies]] allowed proxy voting. After the assembly of 1638, protests were sent to the proprietor in England. It was said that the Governor and his friends were able to exercise too much influence through the proxies they had obtained.

Proxy voting was also used in South Carolina; the proprietors in September 1683 complained to the governor about this system. Proxy voting was used in [[Long Island]], New York as well, at that time. Phraseology was sometimes designed to hide the fact that a proxy system was in use and that the majority of voters did not actually attend the elections. In Rhode Island, the system described as a "proxy" system, from 1664 onward, was actually simply the sending of written ballots from voters who did not attend the election, rather than a true proxy system, as in the assembly of 1647.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=vUNVCafgSHkC&amp;pg=PA437&amp;lpg=PA437&amp;dq=%2Bproxy+%2B%22town+meeting%22 |title=The suffrage franchise in the ... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date=2006-07-24 |accessdate=2010-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Progressive Era]], proxy voting was used in Republican Party state conventions in New Hampshire. The [[Boston and Maine Railroad]], the Republican Party's ally, maintained control over the Party by means of these conventions. "At the 1906 state convention, for instance, party delegates were quite willing to trade, sell, or exchange their voting power in return for various forms of remuneration from the party machine. Public outcry led to the end of such 'proxy' voting".&lt;ref name=stormy&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=yXjbv-18NY4C&amp;pg=PA8&amp;dq=%2B%22proxy+voting%22+%2B%22progressive+era%22 |title=Stormy weather: the New Hampshire ... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= 2003-11-18|accessdate=2010-03-18 | first=Dante J. | last=Scala | isbn=978-0-312-29622-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proxy voting was used in some American U.S. Presidential nominating caucuses.

In response, the Commission on Party Structure and Delegate Selection, also known as the [[McGovern-Fraser Commission]], was created to rework the rules in time for the [[1972 Democratic National Convention]]. State parties were required to ban proxy voting in order to have their delegates seated at the national convention.&lt;ref name=stormy/&gt; It was said that these rules had been used in "highly selective" ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=LYFKpZfXAE0C&amp;pg=PA188&amp;dq=%2B%22proxy+voting%22+%2B%22progressive+era%22 |title=Political parties and the ... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-18 | first=Kelly D. | last=Patterson | isbn=978-0-231-10257-5|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====United States law on proxies====
{{Expert needed|Law|section|date=October 2008}}&lt;!-- What do these citations mean, and are the texts online? Are there citation templates for this? --&gt;
Proxy is defined by supreme courts as "an ''authority'' or power to ''do'' a certain thing."&lt;ref&gt;149 Pa. 84, 29 Atl. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; A person can confer on his proxy any power which he himself possesses. He may also give him secret instructions as to voting upon particular questions.&lt;ref&gt;Ky. L. Rep. 204; 103 Wash. 254.&lt;/ref&gt; But a proxy is ineffectual when it is contrary to law or public policy.&lt;ref&gt;98 Ala. 92; 12 So. 723.&lt;/ref&gt; Where the proxy is duly appointed and he acts within the scope of the proxy, the person authorizing the proxy is bound by his appointee's acts, including his errors or mistakes.&lt;ref&gt;122 Mo. App. 437, 99 S.W. 902.&lt;/ref&gt; When the appointer sends his appointee to a meeting, the proxy may do anything at that meeting necessary to a full and complete exercise of the appointer's right to vote at such meeting. This includes the right to vote to take the vote by ballot, or to adjourn (and, hence, he may also vote on other ordinary parliamentary motions, such as to refer, postpone, reconsider, etc., when necessary or when deemed appropriate and advantageous to the overall object or purpose of the proxy).&lt;ref&gt;13 Pa. County Ct. 576.&lt;/ref&gt;

A proxy cannot vote when the principal himself is present and votes. He can vote only in the principal's absence.&lt;ref&gt;181 Iowa 1013, 165 N.W. 854.&lt;/ref&gt; Where the authority conferred upon a proxy is limited to a designated or special purpose, a vote for another and different purpose is ineffective.&lt;ref&gt;112 Ala. 228, 20 So. 744.&lt;/ref&gt; A proxy in the usual, ordinary form confers authority to act only at the meeting then in contemplation, and in any adjourned-meetings of the same; hence, it may not be voted at another or different meeting held under a ''new call''.&lt;ref&gt;150 N.C. 216, 63 S.E. 892.&lt;/ref&gt; A proxy's unauthorized acts may be [[ratified]] by his appointer, and such ratification is equivalent to previous authority.&lt;ref&gt;109 Cal. 571, 42 Pac. 225.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the weight of authority, a proxy only to vote stock may be revoked at any time, notwithstanding any agreement that it shall be irrevocable.&lt;ref&gt;30 Fed. 91; 207 Ill. 107; 101 Ky. 570; 61 N.J. Eq. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; The sale in the meantime by a stockholder of his shares in a corporation or company automatically revokes any proxies made or given to vote in respect of such shares.&lt;ref&gt;89 Fed. 397.&lt;/ref&gt; And a proxy is also revoked where the party giving it attends the election in person, or gives subsequent proxy.&lt;ref&gt;78 N.J. Eq. 484; 10 Md. 468.&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, a proxy cannot vote when the owner of the stock arrives late or is present and votes.&lt;ref&gt;181 Iowa 1013, 165 N.W. 254.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vietnam===
In Vietnam, proxy voting was used to increase turnout. Presently, proxy voting is illegal, but it has nonetheless been occurring since before 1989. It is estimated to contribute about 20% to voter turnout, and has been described as "a convenient way to fulfil one's duty, avoid possible risks, and avoid having to participate directly in the act of voting". It is essentially a compromise between the party-state, which wants to have high turnouts as proof of public support, and voters who do not want to go to the polling stations. In the Soviet Union, proxy voting was also illegal but done in order to increase turnout figures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=hfsr1lzAOGoC&amp;pg=PA145&amp;dq=%2B%22proxy+voting%22+%2Belectoral |title=Wards of Hanoi - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-18 | isbn=978-981-230-341-7|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proxy voting is automatically prohibited in organizations that have adopted [[Robert's Rules of Order|Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised]] (RONR) or [[The Standard Code of Parliamentary Procedure]] (TSC) as their parliamentary authority, unless it is provided for in its bylaws or charter or required by the laws of its state of incorporation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.robertsrules.com/faq.html#10|title = Frequently Asked Questions about RONR (Question 10)|date = |accessdate = |website = The Official Robert's Rules of Order Web Site|publisher = The Robert's Rules Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TSC/&gt; Robert's Rules says, "If the law under which an organization is incorporated allows proxy voting to be prohibited by a provision of the bylaws, the adoption of this book as parliamentary authority by prescription in the bylaws should be treated as sufficient provision to accomplish that result".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite parl|pages = 429|edition = 11th|year = 2011|title = RONR}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[George Demeter|Demeter]] says the same thing, but also states that "if these laws do ''not'' prohibit voting by proxy, the body can pass a law permitting proxy voting for any purpose desired."&lt;ref name=DEM&gt;{{cite parl|title=DEM|pages=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; RONR opines, "Ordinarily it should neither be allowed nor required, because proxy voting is incompatible with the essential characteristics of a deliberative assembly in which membership is individual, personal, and nontransferable. In a stock corporation, on the other hand, where the ownership is transferable, the voice and vote of the member also is transferable, by use of a proxy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite parl|title = RONR|pages = 428-429|year = 2011|edition = 11th}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Riddick opines that "proxy voting properly belongs in incorporate organizations that deal with stocks or real estate, and in certain political organizations," it also states, "If a state empowers an incorporated organization to use proxy voting, that right cannot be denied in the bylaws." Riddick further opines, "Proxy voting is not recommended for ordinary use. It can discourage attendance, and transfers an inalienable right to another without positive assurance that the vote has not been manipulated."&lt;ref name=RID/&gt;

''Parliamentary Law'' expounds on this point:&lt;ref name=pl&gt;{{cite book|title=Parliamentary Law|author=Robert, Henry M.|year=1991|isbn=0-470-72592-3|pages=194–195, 564}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|It is used only in stock corporations where the control is in the majority of the stock, not in the majority of the stockholders. If one person gets control of fifty-one per cent of the stock he can control the corporation, electing such directors as he pleases in defiance of the hundreds or thousands of holders of the remaining stock. The laws for stock corporations are nearly always made on the theory that the object of the organization is to make money by carrying on a certain business, using capital supplied by a large number of persons whose control of the business should be in proportion to the capital they have put into the concern. The people who have furnished the majority of the capital should control the organization, and yet they may live in different parts of the country, or be traveling at the time of the annual meeting. By the system of proxy voting they can control the election of directors without attending the meetings.}}

Nonetheless, it is common practice in conventions for a delegate to have an alternate, who is basically the same as a proxy. [[Demeter's Manual of Parliamentary Law and Procedure|Demeter's Manual]] notes that the alternate has all the privileges of voting, debate and participation in the proceedings to which the delegate is entitled.&lt;ref name=DEM/&gt; Moreover, "if voting has for years...been conducted...by proxy...such voting by long and continuous custom has the force of law, and the proceedings are valid."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite parl|title=DEM|pages=134|edition=1969|year=1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas E. Arend notes that U.S. laws allow proxy votes to be conducted electronically in certain situations: "The use of electronic media may be permissible for proxy voting, but such voting is generally limited to members. Given the fiduciary duties that are personal to each director, and the need for directors to deliberate to ensure properly considered decisions, proxy voting by directors is usually prohibited by statute. In contrast, a number of state nonprofit corporate statutes allow for member proxy voting and may further allow members to use electronic media to grant a proxy right to another party for member voting purposes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/summary_0199-1341084_ITM|author=Arend, Thomas E.|title=Legal Implications of Electronic Governance|publisher=Association Management|date=2002-01-01|accessdate=2008-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sturgis agrees, "Directors or board members cannot vote by proxy in their meetings, since this would mean the delegation of a discretionary legislative duty which they cannot delegate."&lt;ref name=TSC&gt;{{cite parl|title=TSC|pages=147–148|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proxy voting, even if allowed, may be limited to infrequent use if the rules governing a body specify minimum attendance requirements. For instance, bylaws may prescribe that a member can be dropped for missing three consecutive meetings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://myfloridalegal.com/ago.nsf/Opinions/F8811A3863EA18F08525659300664072|title=Advisory Legal Opinion - AGO 78-117|author=Gleason, Patricia R.|publisher=Office of the Attorney General of Florida|date=1978-09-19|accessdate=2008-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Journal of Mental Science noted the arguments raised against adopting proxy voting for the Association. These included that possibility that it would diminish attendance at  meetings. The rejoinder was that people did not go there to vote; they attending the meetings for the sake of the meeting, the discussion, and the good fellowship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=YNMVAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA617&amp;dq=%22proxy+voting%22 |title=The Journal of mental science - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date=2006-11-20 |accessdate=2010-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corporate settings==
{{Main|Proxy statement}}
Under the [[common law]], shareholders had no right to cast votes by proxy in corporate meetings without special authorization. In ''Walker v. Johnson'',&lt;ref&gt;D.C. App. 144 (1900)&lt;/ref&gt; the [[District of Columbia Court of Appeals|Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia]] explained that the reason was that early corporations were of a municipal, religious or charitable nature, in which the shareholder had no pecuniary interest. The normal mode of conferring corporate rights was by an issue of a charter from the crown, essentially establishing the corporation as a part of the government. Given the personal trust placed in these voters by the king, it was inappropriate for them to delegate to others. In the Pennsylvania case of ''Commonwealth ex rel. Verree v. Bringhurst'',&lt;ref&gt;103 Pa. St. 134 (1883)&lt;/ref&gt; the court held that members of a corporation had no right to vote by proxy at a corporate election unless such right was expressly conferred by the charter or by a bylaw. The attorneys for the plaintiff argued that the common law rules had no application to trading or moneyed corporations where the relation was not personal. The court found, "The fact that it is a business corporation in no wise dispenses with the obligation of all members to assemble together, unless otherwise provided, for the exercise of a right to participate in the election of their officers." At least as early as the 18th century, however, clauses permitting voting by proxy were being inserted in corporate charters in England.&lt;ref&gt;Axe, Leonard H. ''Michigan Law Review'' Vol. 41, No. 1 (Aug. 1942) p. 38-65&lt;/ref&gt;

Proxy voting is commonly used in corporations for voting by members or shareholders, because it allows members who have confidence in the judgment of other members to vote for them and allows the assembly to have a quorum of votes when it is difficult for all members to attend, or there are too many members for all of them to conveniently meet and deliberate. [[Proxy firm]]s commonly advise institutional shareholders on how they should vote. Proxy solicitation firms assist in helping corral votes for a certain resolution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foe.org/international/shareholder/solicitation.html Proxy Solicitation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080128155800/http://www.foe.org/international/shareholder/solicitation.html |date=January 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Domini notes that in the corporate world, "Proxy ballots typically contain proposals from company management on issues of corporate governance, including capital structure, auditing, board composition, and executive compensation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Proxy Voting Guidelines &amp; Procedures |url=http://www.domini.com/common/pdf/ProxyVotingGuidelines.pdf |publisher=Domini Social Investments |accessdate=2008-02-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411094628/http://www.domini.com/common/pdf/ProxyVotingGuidelines.pdf |archivedate=2008-04-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proxies are essentially the corporate law equivalent of [[absentee balloting]]. Shareholders send in a card (called a proxy card) on which they mark their vote. The card authorizes a proxy agent to vote the shareholder's stock as directed on the card. The proxy card may specify how shares are to be voted or may simply give the proxy agent discretion to decide how the shares are to be voted. Under [[Securities Exchange Commission]] Rule 14a-3, the incumbent board of directors' first step in soliciting proxies must be the distribution to shareholders of the firm's annual report. An insurgent may independently prepare proxy cards and proxy statements, which are sent to the shareholders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Complete Guide to Sarbanes-Oxley|author=Bainbridge, Stephen M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Associations of [[institutional investor]]s sometimes attempt to effect social change. For instance, several hundred faith-based institutional investors, such as denominations, pensions, etc. belong to the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility. These organizations commonly exercise influence through [[shareholder resolution]]s, which may spur management to action and lead to the resolutions' withdrawal before an actual vote on the resolution is taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iccr.org/news/press_releases/2008/pr_proxybook011508.htm |title=302 Religious/Social Investor Proxy Resolutions Slated for 2008 |publisher=Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility |date=2008-01-15 |accessdate=2008-02-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080316192547/http://www.iccr.org/news/press_releases/2008/pr_proxybook011508.htm |archivedate=2008-03-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fiduciaries for ERISA and other pension plans are generally expected to vote proxies on behalf of these plans in a manner than maximizes the economic value for plan participants.  In these regard, for ERISA plans, fiduciaries and advisers are very limited in the extent to which they can take social or other goals into account.&lt;ref&gt;Lemke and Lins, ''ERISA for Money Managers'' (Thomson West, 2017-2018 ed.).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the absence of his principal from the annual meeting of a business corporation, the proxy has the right to vote in all instances, but he has not the right to debate or otherwise participate in the proceedings unless he is a stockholder in that same corporation.&lt;ref name=DEM/&gt;

The [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] has ruled that an investment adviser who exercises voting authority over his clients' proxies has a fiduciary responsibility to adopt policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure that the adviser votes proxies in the best interests of clients, to disclose to clients information about those policies and procedures, to disclose to clients how they may obtain information on how the adviser has voted their proxies, and to keep certain records related to proxy voting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/ia-2106.htm|title=Final Rule: Proxy Voting by Investment Advisers|publisher=Securities Exchange Commission|date=2003-01-31|accessdate=2008-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ruling has been criticized on many grounds, including the contention that it places unnecessary burdens on investment advisers and would not have prevented the major [[accounting scandals]] of the early 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa4048/is_200301/ai_n9223584|title=Disclosure of the Irrelevant?: Impact of the SEC's Final Proxy Voting Disclosure Rules|publisher=Fordham Journal of Corporate &amp; Financial Law|author=Stewart, Brian D.|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mutual funds must report their proxy votes periodically on Form N-PX.&lt;ref&gt;Lemke, Lins and Smith, ''Regulation of Investment Companies'' (Matthew Bender, 2017 ed.).&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible for [[overvote]]s and [[undervote]]s to occur in corporate proxy situations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sec.gov/spotlight/proxyprocess/proxyvotingbrief.htm Briefing Paper: Roundtable on Proxy Voting Mechanics. Retrieved March 9, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

Even in corporate settings, proxy voting's use is generally limited to voting at the annual meeting for directors, for the ratification of acts of the directors, for enlargement or diminution of capital, and for other vital changes in the policy of the organization. These proposed changes are summarized in the circular sent to shareholders prior to the annual meeting. The stock-transfer book is closed at least ten days before the annual meeting, to enable the secretary to prepare a list of stockholders and the number of shares held by each. Stock is voted as shown by the stock book when posted. All proxies are checked against this list.&lt;ref name=pl/&gt;

It is possible to designate two or more persons to act as proxy by using language appointing, for instance, "A, B, C, D, and E, F, or any of them, attorneys and agents for me, irrevocable, with full power by the affirmative vote of a majority of said attorneys and agents to appoint a substitute or substitutes for and in the name and stead of me."&lt;ref name=pl/&gt;

Proxy voting is said to have some anti-deliberative consequences, in that proxy holders often lack discretion about how to cast votes due to the instructions given by their principal. Thus, they cannot alter their decision based on the deliberative process of testing the strength of arguments and counter-arguments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=BjW8Cfwn8FEC&amp;pg=PA135&amp;dq=%22proxy+voting%22 |title=The constitutional corporation ... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-18 | first=Stephen | last=Bottomley | isbn=978-0-7546-2418-9|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany, corporate proxy voting is done through banks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.germanlawjournal.com/article.php?id=710 |title=Shareholder Protection in the USA and Germany - On the Fallacy of LLSV |author=Braendle, Uno C. |date=2006-03-01 |publisher=German Law Journal |accessdate=2008-02-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080316110429/http://www.germanlawjournal.com/article.php?id=710 |archivedate=2008-03-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Proxy voting by banks has been a key feature of the connection of banks to corporate ownership in Germany since the industrialization period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Corporate Governance Around the World|author=Morck, Randall|page=258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In '''delegated voting''', the proxy is [[transitive relation|transitive]] and the transfer recursive. Put simply, the vote may be further delegated to the proxy's proxy, and so on. This is also called transitive proxy or delegate cascade.&lt;ref name='Allan-2008'&gt;{{citation |author=Michael Allan |year=2008 |title=A Medium of Assent and its Fit with Society |journal=The ITP News: Newsletter of the Information Technology and Politics Section, American Political Science Association |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=12–13| url=http://www.apsanet.org/~itp/v4n2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; An early proposal of delegate voting was that of [[Lewis Carroll]] in 1884.&lt;ref name='Carrol-1884'&gt;{{cite book |last=Carroll |first=Lewis |year=1884 |title=The Principles of Parliamentary Representation |publisher=Harrison and Sons |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Duncan-1969'&gt;{{cite journal |last=Black |first=Duncan |year=1969 |title=Lewis Carroll and the theory of games |journal=The American Economic Review |volume=59 |issue=2 |page=210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Delegate voting is used by the Swedish local political party [[Demoex]]. Demoex won their first seat in the city council of Vallentuna, [[Sweden]], in 2002. The first years of activity in the party have been evaluated by [[Mitthögskolan University]] in a paper by Karin Ottesen in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://demoex.net/files/Ottesensuppsats.pdf|title=Flexible representation by use of delegated voting - a case study of practical use|first=Karin|last=Ottesen|year=2003|accessdate=2009-02-23|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Demoex, a voter can also vote directly, even if she has delegated her vote to a proxy; the direct vote overrules the proxy vote. It is also possible to change the proxy at any time.

In 2005, in a pilot study in Pakistan, ''Structural Deep Democracy, SD2''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://groups.yahoo.com/group/sd-2/ |title=Yahoo! Groups |publisher=Groups.yahoo.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.148.9274 |title=CiteSeerX — Autopoietic Information Systems in Modern Organizations |publisher=Citeseerx.ist.psu.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; was used for leadership selection in a sustainable agriculture group called Contact Youth. SD2 uses [[PageRank]] for the processing of the transitive proxy votes, with the additional constraints of mandating at least two initial proxies per voter, and all voters are proxy candidates. More complex variants can be built on top of SD2, such as adding specialist proxies and direct votes for specific issues, but SD2 as the underlying umbrella system, mandates that generalist proxies should always be used.

Delegated voting is also used in the World Parliament Experiment, and in implementations of [[delegative democracy]], which is also known as [[liquid democracy]].

'''''Re Rizzo &amp; Rizzo Shoes Ltd''''' is a 1998 judgment from the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] regarding the priority of employees interests when a company declares bankruptcy. The judgment hinged on the interpretation of the [[Employment Standards Act]] and has been taken to mark the Supreme Court of Canada's adoption of the [[purposive approach]] to legislative interpretation. It has since been frequently cited in subsequent decisions of Canadian courts, nearly every time legislation is interpreted.

==Background==
Rizzo &amp; Rizzo Shoes Ltd. filed for bankruptcy; employees subsequently lost their jobs. The company paid all wages, salaries, commissions, and vacation pay through termination. The [[Ministry of Labour (Ontario)|Ministry of Labour for the Province of Ontario]] audited the company to ensure that no further payments were owed to former employees under the Employment Standards Act (ESA). Proof of claim was submitted to a trustee, who subsequently disallowed the claim. According to the trustee, a company's bankruptcy does not constitute dismissal from employment; thus, the former employees of Rizzo &amp; Rizzo Shoes gained no positive right to severance, termination or vacation pay under the ESA.

The case went before the [[Ontario Court of Justice (General Division)|Ontario Court (General Division)]] where the judge agreed with the Ministry of Labour and allowed the former employees to be paid. However, the [[Ontario Court of Appeal]] overturned the ruling and restored the Trustee's decision. The Ministry sought leave to appeal from the Court of Appeal judgment but discontinued its application. Following the discontinuance of the appeal, the Trustee paid a dividend to Rizzo's creditors, thereby leaving significantly less funds in the estate. Subsequently, the appellants, five former employees of Rizzo, moved to set aside the discontinuance, add themselves as parties to the proceedings, and requested and were granted an order granting them leave to appeal.

==Ruling==

In the unanimous decision, the Supreme Court allowed the employees' appeal holding that they were entitled to the payments. While the plain language of the Act seemed to suggest that termination pay and severance pay were payable only when the employer terminates the employment, the Court held that the words of an Act must be read in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament.

Iacobucci J. wrote:

[[Elmer Driedger]] in Construction of Statutes (2nd ed. 1983) best encapsulates the approach upon which I prefer to rely. He recognizes that statutory interpretation cannot be founded on the wording of the legislation alone. At p.&amp;nbsp;87 he states

''Today there is only one principle or approach, namely, the words of an Act are to be read in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament.''

(Re Rizzo &amp; Rizzo Shoes Ltd ''[1998] 1 S.C.R. 27, at para 21, quoting E. A. Driedger, The Construction of Statutes (2nd ed 1983), at p. 87'')

The Court of Appeal had failed to read the language of the Act in this broad manner the Supreme Court held. It noted that the purpose of the termination and severance pay provisions were to protect employees, to recognize their service and investment in the employer's enterprise and to cushion them against the adverse effects of economic dislocation. To hold that (more junior) employees terminated prior to bankruptcy would be entitled to termination and severance pay while (more senior) employees terminated upon bankruptcy  would be absurd, the Court held:

:The trial judge properly noted that, if the ESA termination and severance pay provisions do not apply in circumstances of bankruptcy, those employees “fortunate” enough to have been dismissed the day before a bankruptcy would be entitled to such payments, but those terminated on the day the bankruptcy becomes final would not be so entitled.  In my view, the absurdity of this consequence is particularly evident in a unionized workplace where seniority is a factor in determining the order of lay-off. The more senior the employee, the larger the investment he or she has made in the employer and the greater the entitlement to termination and severance pay. However, it is the more senior personnel who are likely to be employed up until the time of the bankruptcy and who would thereby lose their entitlements to these payments.

The Court also held that the legislative history of the termination and severance pay provisions and the other provisions in the ESA supported an interpretation that such benefits were payable to employees whose employment is terminated upon bankruptcy. The Court also ordered the Ministry of Labour to pay the employees' costs, since it had not provided the Court with any evidence as to the effort it made to notify or secure the consent of the Rizzo employees before it discontinued its application for leave to appeal to this Court on their behalf.

'''''Res judicata''''' (RJ) or '''''res iudicata''''', also known as '''claim preclusion''', is the [[Latin]] term for "a matter [already] judged", and refers to either of two concepts: in both [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] and [[common law]] legal systems, a case in which there has been a final judgment and is no longer subject to [[appeal]]; and the legal doctrine meant to bar (or preclude) continued litigation of a case on same issues between the same [[litigant|parties]].  In this latter usage, the term is synonymous with "[[Collateral estoppel|issue preclusion]]".

In the case of ''res judicata'', the matter cannot be raised again, either in the same court or in a different court.  A court will use ''res judicata'' to deny reconsideration of a matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=Issue Preclusion and Claim Preclusion: How Prior Litigation Can Block Your Claim|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/civil-litigation/issue-preclusion-and-claim-preclusion|website=ExpertLaw.com|accessdate=12 December 2017|date=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The doctrine of ''res judicata'' is a method of preventing injustice to the parties of a case supposedly finished, but perhaps also or mostly a way of avoiding unnecessary waste of resources in the court system. ''Res judicata'' does not merely prevent future judgments from contradicting earlier ones, but also prevents litigants from multiplying judgments, and confusion.

== In common law ==
The principle of ''res judicata'' may be used either by a judge or a defendant.

Once a final judgment has been handed down in a [[lawsuit]], subsequent [[judge]]s who are confronted with a suit that is identical to or substantially the same as the earlier one will apply the ''res judicata'' doctrine to preserve the effect of the first judgment.

A defendant in a lawsuit may use ''res judicata'' as defense.  The general rule is that a plaintiff who prosecuted an action against a defendant and obtained a valid final judgment is not able to initiate another action versus the same defendant where:
*the claim is based on the same transaction that was at issue in the first action;
*the plaintiff seeks a different remedy, or further remedy, than was obtained in the first action;
*the claim is of such nature as could have been joined in the first action.&lt;ref name="RJDef"&gt;{{cite web|title=Res Judicata|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/res_judicata|website=Wex|publisher=Cornell Law School|accessdate=12 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once a [[bankruptcy]] plan is confirmed in court action, the plan is binding on all parties involved.  Any question regarding the plan which could have been raised may be barred by ''res judicata''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=11 U.S. Code § 1141 - Effect of confirmation, Subsection (a)|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/1141|website=Legal Information Institute|publisher=Cornell Law School|accessdate=12 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution]] provides that no fact having been tried by a jury shall be otherwise re-examinable in any [[Federal judiciary of the United States|court of the United States]] or of [[State court (United States)|any state]] than according to the rules of law.

For ''res judicata'' to be binding, several factors must be met:
*identity in the thing at suit;
*identity of the cause at suit;
*identity of the parties to the action;
*identity in the designation of the parties involved;
*whether the judgment was final;
*whether the parties were given full and fair opportunity to be heard on the issue.

Regarding ''designation of the parties involved'', a person may be involved in an action while filling a given office (e.g. as the agent of another), and may subsequently initiate the same action in a differing capacity (e.g. as his own agent).  In that case ''res judicata'' would not be available as a defence unless the defendant could show that the differing designations were not legitimate and sufficient.

=== Scope ===
''Res judicata'' includes two related concepts: claim preclusion and issue preclusion (also called [[collateral estoppel]] or issue estoppel), though sometimes ''res judicata'' is used more narrowly to mean only claim preclusion.

Claim preclusion bars a suit from being brought again on an event which was the subject of a previous legal [[cause of action]] that has already been finally decided between the parties&lt;ref&gt;Otherwise, the public interest, in the electoral judgments, "is made with an investigation with effect erga omnes, which exceeds the usual subjective limits of res judicata":{{cite journal|last1=Buonomo|first1=Giampiero|title= Non entra in Comune lo sportivo "vigilato" (storie delle ineleggibilità e di incompatibilità)|journal=Diritto&amp;Giustizia edizione online|date=2001| url= https://www.questia.com/projects#!/project/89289064}} {{Subscription required |via=[[Questia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; or those in [[privity]] with a party.

[[Issue preclusion]] bars the relitigation of issues of fact or law that have already been necessarily determined by a judge or [[jury]] as part of an earlier case.

It is often difficult to determine which, if either, of these concepts apply to later lawsuits that are seemingly related, because many causes of action can apply to the same factual situation and ''vice versa''.  The scope of an earlier judgment is probably the most difficult question that judges must resolve in applying ''res judicata''.  Sometimes merely part of the action will be affected. For example, a single claim may be struck from a complaint, or a single factual issue may be removed from reconsideration in the new trial.

===Rationale===
''Res judicata'' is intended to strike a balance between competing interests. Its primary purpose is to assure an efficient judicial system.  A related purpose is to create "repose" and finality.&lt;ref name="USCA5"&gt;{{cite web|title=''Comer v. Murphy Oil USA, Inc.'', 718 F. 3d 460 (5th.Cir. 2015)|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15077057778104758208|website=Google Scholar|publisher=Google|accessdate=12 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Justice Stewart explained the need for this legal precept as follows:
:Federal courts have traditionally adhered to the related doctrines of ''res judicata'' (claim preclusion) and ''collateral estoppel'' (issue preclusion).  Under RJ, a final judgment on the merits of an action precludes the parties . . . from re-litigating issues that were or could have been raised in that action.  Under collateral estoppel, once a court has decided an issue of fact or law necessary to its judgment, that decision may preclude re-litigation of the issue in a suit on a different cause of action involving a party to the first cause.  As this court and other courts have often recognised, res judicata and collateral estoppel relieve parties of the costs and vexation of multiple lawsuits, conserve judicial resources, and by preventing inconsistent decisions, encourage reliance on adjudication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Allen v. McCurry'', 449 U.S. 90, 94, 101 S.Ct. 411 (1980)|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1935795609383529506|website=Google Scholar|publisher=Google|accessdate=12 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Exceptions to application ===
''Res judicata'' does not restrict the [[appeal]]s process,&lt;ref&gt;In Continental jus commune it was different: "When jurists define res judicata, they distinguish it from the final judgment21. By final judgment, they mean a decision of the judge that defines and concludes the main subject of the case and that, therefore, necessarily contains words of acquittal or conviction22. Yet, the res judicata presents something more, an added value, if compared with the final judgment pronounced by the judge: the judgment passes in rem judicatam following ten days, during which time, making an appeal is permitted. The ten days given to the parties to appeal, are provided for by a principle of ius commune and represent a necessary break between trial and judgment, on the one hand, and the res judicata, on the other. A pause that allows the parties to evaluate the work done by the judge and its results, as well as to identify possible reasons for appealing":  Antonella Bettoni, ''Res judicata and null and void judgment in the Italian and German doctrine of Sixteenth – and Seventeenth – century criminal law. Certain interpretative profiles'', Crime, Histoire &amp; Sociétés / Crime, History &amp; Societies, Vol. 12, n°1, 2008, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; which is considered a linear extension of the same lawsuit as the suit travels up (and back down) the [[appellate court]] ladder. Appeals are considered the appropriate manner by which to challenge a judgment rather than trying to start a new trial. Once the appeals process is exhausted or waived, ''res judicata'' will apply even to a judgment that is contrary to law. In states that permit a judgment to be renewed, a lawsuit to renew the judgment would not be barred by ''res judicata'', however in states that do not permit renewal by action (as opposed to renewal by [[scire facias]] or by motion), such an action would be rejected by the courts as vexatious.

There are limited exceptions to ''res judicata'' that allow a party to attack the validity of the original judgment, even outside of appeals. These exceptions&amp;mdash;usually called collateral attacks&amp;mdash;are typically based on [[civil procedure|procedural]] or [[jurisdiction]]al issues, based not on the wisdom of the earlier court's decision but its authority or on the competence of the earlier court to issue that decision. A collateral attack is more likely to be available (and to succeed) in judicial systems with multiple jurisdictions, such as under [[Federation|federal]] governments, or when a domestic court is asked to enforce or recognise the judgment of a foreign court.

In addition, in matters involving [[due process]], cases that appear to be ''res judicata'' may be re-litigated. An example would be the establishment of a right to counsel. People who have had [[liberty]] taken away (i.e., imprisoned) may be allowed to be re-tried with a counselor as a matter of fairness.

RJ may not apply in cases involving the ''[[England v. Louisiana State Board of Medical Examiners|England reservation]]''.  If a litigant files suit in federal court, and that court stays proceedings to allow a state court to consider the questions of state law, the litigant may inform the state court that he reserves any federal-law issues in the action for federal court.  If he makes such a reservation, RJ would not bar him from returning the case to federal court at conclusion of action in state court.&lt;ref&gt;''[[England v. Louisiana State Board of Medical Examiners]]'', 375 U.S. 411 (1964)&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a [[declaratory judgment]] exception to RJ. “[A] declaratory action determines only what it actually decides and does not have a [[Claim preclusion|claim preclusive]] effect on other contentions that might have been advanced.”&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Restatement 2d of Judgments|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=§ 33 cmt. c.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, “a plaintiff who has lost a declaratory judgment action may also bring a subsequent action for other relief, subject to the constraint of the determinations made in the declaratory action.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This exception has been adopted in Oregon,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''O’Connor v. Zeldin'', 134 Or. App. 444, 447 (1995)|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15478388297128031176|website=Google Sholar|publisher=Google|accessdate=12 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Texas,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Valley Oil Co. v. City of Garland'', 499 S.W.2d 333, 335 (Tex.Civ. App-Dallas 1973)|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8491774918980592353|website=Google Scholar|publisher=Google|accessdate=12 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a number of other U.S. states.

RJ may be avoided if claimant was not afforded a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue decided by a state court.  He could file suit in a federal court to challenge the adequacy of the state's procedures.  In that case the federal suit would be against the state and not against the defendant in the first suit.&lt;ref name="RJDef" /&gt;

RJ may not apply if consent (or tacit agreement) is justification for splitting a claim.  If plaintiff splits a claim in the course of a suit for special or justifiable reasons for doing so, a judgment in that action may not have the usual consequence of extinguishing the entire claim.

However, once a case has been appealed, finality of the appellate court's decision is vindicated in that proceeding by giving effect in later proceedings involving the same matter, whether in the appellate or lower courts.  This is the [[law of the case]] doctrine.

=== Failure to apply ===
When a subsequent court fails to apply ''res judicata'' and renders a contradictory verdict on the same claim or issue, if a third court is faced with the same case, it will likely apply a "last in time" rule, giving effect only to the later judgment, even though the result came out differently the second time.  This situation is not unheard of, as it is typically the responsibility of the parties to the suit to bring the earlier case to the judge's attention, and the judge must decide how broadly to apply it, or whether to recognise it in the first place.  ''See Americana Fabrics, Inc. v. L &amp; L Textiles, Inc''., 754 F.2d 1524, 1529-30 (9th Cir. 1985).

== In civil law systems==
{{Refimprove section|date=April 2007}}
The doctrine of ''res judicata'' in nations that have a [[civil law (legal system)|civil law legal system]] is much narrower in scope than in common law nations.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

In order for a second suit to be dismissed on a motion of ''res judicata'' in a civilian jurisdiction, the trial must be identical to the first trial in the following manner: (1) identical parties, (2) identical theories of recovery, and (3) identical demands in both trials.  In other words, the issue preclusion or [[collateral estoppel]] found in the common law doctrine of ''res judicata'' is not present in the civilian doctrine.  In addition if all else is equal between the two cases, minus the relief sought, there will be no dismissal based on ''res judicata'' in a civil law jurisdiction.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

In civil law countries adopting German law concept, such as Japan and Taiwan, the Res judicata (Rechtskraft) is in close connection with the cause of action (Streitgegenstand). However, the theory of cause of action itself is different in Germany and Japan and Taiwan, therefore the scope of Res judicata are different in the above countries.

A common use of the res judicata principle is to preclude plaintiffs after a [[class action]] suit has been settled even on plaintiffs who were not part of the original action because they could have joined that original action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tucker|first1=Robert J.|last2=Eckelberry|first2=Rodger L.|title=Class action settlements — res judicata or not?|url=https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=8e8e25a0-396e-44c1-8555-1e1095756b86|website=Lexology|publisher=Globe Business Media Group|accessdate=12 December 2017|date=7 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In international law==

Arguably, ''res judicata''  is a general principle of international law under Article 38 (1)(c) of the [[International Court of Justice]] Statute. "The Court, whose function is to decide in accordance with international law such disputes as are submitted to it, shall apply: ... c. the general principles of law recognized by civilized nations".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icj-cij.org/documents/index.php?p1=4&amp;p2=2&amp;p3=0#CHAPTER_II Statute of the International Court of Justice: Chapter II Article 38.1.c]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://people.virginia.edu/~rjb3v/latin.html "Beck's Law Dictionary": A Compendium of International Law Terms and Phrases] on the website of the [[University of Virginia]]&lt;/ref&gt; {{Clarify|date=July 2008}}

Similar provisions are also found in the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]], and Article 4 of Protocol 7 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]].  However, in the two said conventions, the application of ''res judicata'' is restricted to criminal proceedings only.  In the European Convention, reopening of a concluded criminal proceedings is possible if&amp;nbsp;–

: (a) it is in accordance with the law and penal procedure of the State concerned;
: (b) there is evidence of new or newly discovered facts, or
: (c) if there has been a fundamental defect in the previous proceedings,

which could affect the outcome of the case.

* Secured a $627 million settlement in ''In re [[Wachovia Securities|Wachovia Preferred Sec.]] &amp; Bond/Notes Litigation.'' The global recovery, including $590 million from [[Wells Fargo]] and $37 million from Wachovia's auditor, [[KPMG]], is one of the largest recoveries under the Securities Act of 1933 arising out of the credit crisis. The suit focused on Wachovia's exposure to "pick-a-pay" loans, which the bank's offering materials assured were of "pristine credit quality." Investors had alleged that these loans were made to subprime borrowers, many of whom defaulted, which ultimately led to a massive impairment of the bank's mortgage portfolio, and alleged that Wachovia's offering documents materially misstated and failed to disclose the true nature and quality of Wachovia's mortgage loan portfolio, which exposed the bank to tens of billions of dollars in losses on mortgage-related assets and misled investors. Robbins Geller was one of these firms appointed to represent the class.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/almID/1202509684468/|title=Wachovia Bondholders Reach Record Settlement for $627 Million {{!}} The American Lawyer|work=The American Lawyer|access-date=2018-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111903454504576489943165116176|title=Wells Fargo Agrees to Settle Wachovia Suit|last=Benoit|first=David|date=2011-08-06|work=Wall Street Journal|access-date=2018-10-12|language=en-US|issn=0099-9660}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Obtained final approval of a $590.5 million settlement with three private equity firms: [[Kohlberg Kravis Roberts]], [[the Blackstone Group]] and TPG. The accusations were that the three firms colluded with one another to drive down the prices of corporate takeover targets.

* Secured a $67 million settlement in ''City of Westland Police and Fire Retirement System v. Stumpf''. The shareholder derivative action alleged Wells Fargo's directors' failure to disclose their lack of cooperation in a federal investigation into the bank's mortgage and foreclosure practices. The shareholder suit arises from allegations that Wells Fargo participated in "[[robosigning]]," i.e. mass-processing foreclosure documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-wells-fargo-settlement-20140524-story.html|title=Wells Fargo settles remaining 'robo-signing' mortgage litigation - Los Angeles Times|last=Reckard|first=E.

* Obtained unprecedented corporate governance reforms on behalf of Community Health Systems, Inc. in a case against the company's directors and officers for breaching their fiduciary duties by causing Community Health to develop and implement admissions criteria that systematically steered patients into unnecessary inpatient admissions, in contravention of Medicare and Medicaid regulations. The governance reforms obtained as part of the settlement include two shareholder-nominated directors, the creation of a Healthcare Law Compliance Coordinator with specified qualifications and duties, a requirement that the Board's Compensation Committee be composed solely of independent directors, the implementation of a compensation clawback that will automatically recover compensation improperly paid to the company's CEO or CFO in the event of a restatement, the establishment of an insider trading controls committee, and the adoption of a political expenditure disclosure policy. In addition to these reforms, $60 million in financial relief was obtained, which is the largest shareholder derivative recovery ever in Tennessee and the Sixth Circuit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nashvillepost.com/business/area-stocks/article/20845874/chs-preps-big-governance-changes-in-suit-settlement|title=CHS preps big governance changes in suit settlement {{!}} Nashville Post|website=Nashville Post|language=en|access-date=2018-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shield Mark B.V. vs. Joost Kist''' is a decision by the 6th Senate of the [[European Court of Justice]], case C-283/01, which dealt with the question whether sound signs may be registered as [[trademark]]s, and what requirements those sound signs and their trademark entry have to fulfill to be consistent with Article 2 of the First Council Directive of 21 December 1988 to approximate the laws of the Member States relating to trade marks (89/104/EEC).

==Sound trademarks==
===Definition===
Sound signs are melodies or tone colors. They are identified by hearing without support through speech. As such they can be utilized in acoustic brand marketing, which creates the need to register them as trademarks to protect a company's [[intellectual property]] and ensure their use as exclusive identifier for the company, just like a company logo does.
[[Sound trademark]]s are protected trademarks centered on the reproduction of sounds and tones. Combinations of sound and word or graphic elements are additional design options. Typical sound marks include [[Melody|tunes]], [[jingle]]s, [[melody|melodies]], as well as general sounds or noise.

In the [[European Union]], a sound sign or tone color can be trade marked as sound trademark if it has significant differentiation and can be graphically represented. These requirements are satisfied if the sound trademark is clear, precise, self-contained, easily accessible, intelligible, durable and objective. Therefore sound signs or tone colors can only be registered in the member states of the European Union if they are precisely graphically represented, e.g. by musical notation or a sonogram, or any other distinct method, e.g. a sound recording.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oami.europa.eu/de/office/ejs/pdf/von_Kapff.pdf] Harmonisierungsamt für den Binnenmarkt&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marcus Loeber in Kai Bronner / Rainer Hirt, Audio-Branding 2007, S. 200&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical Development===

Music or tunes have been utilized for centuries to highlight specific events. A church bell drawing attention to an ecclesiastical service is a prime example.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Steiner, Sound Branding: Grundlage der akustischen Markenführung 2009, S. 101&lt;/ref&gt;
The utilization of music for specific product advertisements comparable to today's sound trademarks has been boosted with the introduction of the radio and later the television. First radio advertisements underlined by music were already aired in the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Steiner, Sound Branding: Grundlage der akustischen Markenführung 2009, S. 101&lt;/ref&gt;

===Significance for Marketing===

Sound trademarks are underestimated as marketing instrument. Their value of brand recognition makes them an effective enhancement to conventional marketing strategies. Sound trademarks create emotional associations to a specific product when the target customers hear a particular melody or tune.

==Shield Mark Verdict of the European Court of Justice==

The following paragraph introduces the verdict in the legal case Shield Mark BV versus Joost Kist, representative of the company Memex, before the European Court of Justice (ECJ), case number C-283/01.

===Facts of the Case===

The Dutch company [[Shield Mark BV]] had registered 14 sound trademarks at the [[Benelux]] trademark office, the first on 5 June 1992 and the most recent on 2 February 1999, for various services like computer software and seminars in the areas of promotion, marketing, intellectual property and commercial communication. Four of those trademarks consist of a musical stave with the first nine notes of the musical composition "[[Für Elise]]" by [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]. Two of them have the added remark "sound mark". The trademark entries consist of the representation of the melody formed by the notes (graphically) transcribed on a [[staff (music)|stave]]. In one case the remark "played on a [[piano]]" was added.
Four other trademarks consisted of the first nine notes of "Für Elise". Two of them also had "sound mark" added as annotation. The trademark consists of the melody described, plus, in one case, the remark "played on a piano".
Three further marks consist of the sequence of musical notes "E, D#, E, D#, E, B, D, C, A". Two of them also state "sound mark". The trademark consists of the reproduction of the melody formed by the sequence of notes as described, again in one case "played on a piano". A sound trademark consisting of an onomatopoetic word (called "[[onomatopoeia]]"), the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] "Kukelekuuuuu" crow of a rooster was used for the computer software. Another sound trademark is registered for the first nine notes of Ludwig van Beethoven's composition "Für Elise" used for a jingle in a promotion campaign in October 1992.

The crow of the rooster was used in a Shield Mark software developed for lawyers and trademark specialists to signal the start of the program. Flyers displayed on stands in bookshops and newspaper kiosks played the signature tune each time one was taken from the stand.
Shield Mark's competitor, [[Joost Kist]] with his company Memex, which also operates in the field of legal advice for communication, started a promotion campaign in January 1995 also using the first nine notes of "Für Elise". Furthermore, Joost Kist also utilized Shield Mark's registered sound of the crow of the rooster at the start of a software he sold.
Shield Mark brought an action against Mr. Kist for infringement of its trademarks and unfair competition.

===From the Dutch Courts to the European Court of Justice===

By judgment of 27 May 1999, the [[Gerechtshof te's Gravenhage]] granted Shield Mark's application, which was based on the law of civil responsibility, but dismissed the claims based on trademark law, on the ground that it was the intention of the Governments of the Benelux states and their joint trademark law to preclude sound signs from being registered as trademarks.

Thereupon Shield Mark appealed to the [[Hoge Raad der Nederlanden]], the highest civil court of the [[Netherlands]], which decided to stay proceedings and to refer two questions to the European Court of Justice under Article 234 EC for a preliminary ruling on the interpretation of Article 2 of First Council Directive 89/104/EEC of 21 December 1988 to approximate the laws of the Member States relating to trade marks.

===First Question: Consistency with the EU Directive===
Part (a) of the first question asked whether Article 2 of the Directive must be interpreted as precluding sound signs from being regarded as trademarks. If the answer was negative, the Hoge Rad asked by part (b) of its first question, whether Article 2 implies that sound signs must be capable of being regarded as trademarks.

The ECJ responded that the purpose of Article 2(a) of the Directive is to define the types of signs of which a trademark may consist. That provision states that a trade mark may consist of "particularly words, including personal names, designs, letters, numerals, the shape of goods or of their packaging ...".

Thus only signs that are capable of being perceived visually are mentioned. That list is not exhaustive, however, as can be seen from the language of both Article 2 of the Directive and the seventh recital in the preamble thereto, which refers to a "list of examples" of signs of which a trade mark may consist. Consequently, that provision, although it does not mention signs that are not in themselves capable of being perceived visually, such as sounds, does not expressly exclude them.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ralf Sieckmann v Deutsches Patent und Markenamt]]Sieckmann&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, sound signs are capable of distinguishing the goods and services of one undertaking from those of other undertakings.

Following these arguments, the Court found that according to Article 2 of the Directive sounds may constitute a trademark, on the condition that they may also be represented graphically.

In regard to part (b) of the first question, the Court also stated that Article 2 of the Directive does not preclude the registration of sounds as trade marks. Consequently, the Member States cannot preclude such registration as a matter of principle. Although the Directive does not seek to achieve full-scale approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to trademarks, the conditions for obtaining and continuing to hold a trademark have to be the same.

===Second Question: Criteria for Registering Sound Trademarks===
The second submitted question asked (a) which requirements sound signs have to fulfill to meet the criteria of Article 2 of the Directive, and (b) what kinds of sound sign are capable of being represented graphically within the meaning of Article 2, in particular, whether musical notes, a written description in the form of an onomatopoeia, a written description in some other form, a graphical representation such as a sonogram, a sound recording annexed to the registration form, a digital recording accessible via the internet, a combination of those methods, or any other form meet the requirements of graphical representation.

The Court denied a verdict about types of sound signs that weren't decisive for the case at hand, e.g. sonograms and digital recordings, as these were hypothetical problems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:62001J0111:EN:PDF] Gantner Electronic&lt;/ref&gt;

The requirements that have to be met by graphical representations were already determined in the verdict [[Ralf Sieckmann v Deutsches Patent und Markenamt]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:62000J0273:EN:NOT] Sieckmann verdict&lt;/ref&gt; which concerned olfactory signs. Thus, within the frame of Article 2 of the Directive, a trademark may consist of a sign that is not in itself capable of being perceived visually, provided that it can be represented graphically, particularly by means of images, lines or characters, and that its representation is clear, precise, self-contained, easily accessible, intelligible, durable and objective. Those conditions are also binding for sound signs.

===Verdict and Consequences===
As consequence for the Shield Mark case, the Court ruled that a graphical representation in mere text form such as ‘the first nine notes of "Für Elise" or "the crow of a rooster" at the very least lack precision and clarity and therefore cannot constitute a graphical representation of that sign for the purposes of Article 2 of the Directive. The same applies for onomatopoeia, as it is not possible for the competent authorities and the public, in particular traders, to determine whether the protected sign is the onomatopoeia itself, as pronounced, or the actual sound or noise.

Musical notes, however, in the form of a stave, fulfill the requirements set by the ECJ's Sieckmann verdict that such representation must be clear, precise, self-contained, easily accessible, intelligible, durable and objective. Thus only the sound signs registered by Shield Mark BV along with a stave or other graphic representations meeting the requirements could be upheld as trademarks.

[[File:StAgnesPl.squats.JPG|thumb|St Agnes Place in 2005, prior to its demolition]]
'''St Agnes Place''' was a [[Squatting#United Kingdom|squatted]] street in [[Kennington]], [[south London]], which resisted [[eviction]] orders for more than 30 years. When a number of derelict houses were scheduled for demolition to extend [[Kennington Park]] in 1969, squatters occupied the properties and a High Court injunction prevented the demolition. The street was run by a [[housing cooperative]] until 2005, when [[Lambeth London Borough Council]] obtained an eviction order. Demolition was completed in 2007.

== History ==
On 1 June 1969 house number 54 was the first to be squatted. The council had acquired the unit and planned to demolish it for the extension to [[Kennington Park]]. The derelict buildings were completely rebuilt by the squatters. An attempt to evict it in 1977 was successfully resisted on the rooftops. An emergency High Court injunction, obtained by solicitors in Lambeth Law Centre,  ordered the demolition to stop. The resulting furore and publicity on a national scale prevented further demolition, and led to the fall of the Conservative Council, and the resignation of Councillor Stimpson, the leader of the council.&lt;ref&gt;https://hutnyk.wordpress.com/2006/12/06/kennington-and-oval/ {{unreliable source|date=February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A block of buildings were demolished either side of the road, and some were badly damaged and scaffolded. But a large central block on both sides of the road were completely untouched, and were in occupation on the day of the attempted demolition, and thereafter. Some damaged ones were renovated again by the residents, and made habitable i.e. one was re-roofed, and several were re-wired and had basic services restored.

The residents of St Agnes paid utility bills and for several years were run by a [[housing cooperative]] with diverse occupancy, and in the last few years a larger number of young [[Homelessness|homeless]] people. In November 2005, [[Lambeth London Borough Council]] finally obtained a [[High Court of Justice]] order to evict the residents of 21 properties. This mass eviction was completed on 30 November 2005.

==Community==
There were several community projects at St Agnes Place:
* Housing the homeless
* [[Social center|Social centre]] (#60)
* [[Free party|Free parties]]
* A Rastafari community (it has been stated that a third of the street were Rastafari)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blink.org.uk/pdescription.asp?grp=2&amp;cat=382&amp;key=10164 Forced out - one mans story] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060713205007/http://www.blink.org.uk/pdescription.asp?grp=2&amp;cat=382&amp;key=10164 |date=13 July 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Musician]]s, [[pirate radio]] and [[artist]]s

St Agnes Place was responsible for producing music and also broadcasting Wireless FM&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wirelessfm.net/ |title=Wireless FM |publisher=Wireless FM |date= |accessdate=2013-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and pirate radio station [[Rasta FM]], which was raided by [[Ofcom]] in October 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ofcom.org.uk/media/news/2005/11/illegal |title=Ofcom tackles illegal broadcasting |publisher=Ofcom.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-08-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100704093312/http://www.ofcom.org.uk/media/news/2005/11/illegal |archivedate=4 July 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One resident said: "It's evolved into a unique community in London. You can walk in and out of people's houses here. It's a safe street. There's no mugging here. I think there is a lot of things society as a whole could learn from the way we live here.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/4407772.stm |title=London's oldest squat faces end |publisher=BBC News |date=2005-11-04 |accessdate=2013-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bob Marley]] stayed at the street on several occasions in the 1970s. St Agnes Place had a [[Rastafari movement|Rastafari]] community and had a Rastafari temple along with other related social centres.

== Eviction ==
[[File:StAgnesPlaceminushouses.jpg|thumb|The street in 2007, after its demolition]]
Lambeth Council obtained a possession order in 2003, the squatters failed in their argument for [[adverse possession]], and some were threatened with 30 years of [[Council Tax]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

There were a few dates given to the squatters in the summer of 2003 for them to leave when [[bailiff]]s would be arriving. Many of the residents moved out and a number of protesters associated with [[Anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]], [[Environmentalism|environmentalist]] and [[Irish Traveller|travellers]] movements moved in. [[Barricade]]s were built and the bailiffs came and left making no attempt to evict anyone.

Nothing more happened regarding the eviction until Autumn 2005 when firstly, the council obtained a demolition order for the street. Secondly, a new [[court order]] was issued by the council: The possession orders obtained in 2003 were still valid but the [[Warrant (law)|warrants]] to execute the court order had expired. This new court case was to firstly issue fresh warrants and secondly to have the execution of these warrants handled by the High Court rather than the [[County Court]]. This meant that they could use [[Riot control|riot police]] instead of a handful of bailiffs.

A massive eviction happened on Tuesday, 30 November 2005 by two hundred bailiffs and [[police]] wearing riot gear. There was not much resistance and most people just wanted to avoid any confrontation but wanted to be thrown out rather than leave as a matter of principle. The street was swept and tidied by residents prior to the arrival of the police and banners put up criticising the council, particularly [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] councillor Keith Fitchett who described the residents as "parasites".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stagnesplace.net/index.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=89 |title=Bye Bye Fitchett |publisher=Stagnesplace.net |date=2012-11-12 |accessdate=2013-08-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305113021/http://www.stagnesplace.net/index.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=89 |archivedate=5 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rasta temple remains stagnesplace July 07.jpg|thumb|The site of the Rastafarian Temple in July 2007, now marked with green, yellow and red coloured railings]]
However, one of the squats on the far end of the street remained in place for another year and a half - separated by a large gap from the other houses in the street, the Rastafari temple, said to have been visited by Bob Marley in the late 70s and a place of genuine religious significance for Rastafari. The council expressed the intention of coming to some sort of agreement with the occupiers vis a vis rent/housing benefit. On 12 April 2007, police raided it because it was allegedly being used to sell [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] and [[crack cocaine]]. Moves were being made to evict them by the council anyway and some of the temple elders apparently told the police about the [[Illegal drug trade|drug dealing]] and gangsters because they felt that the temple had been overrun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6549515.stm |title=Anger amid Rastafarian temple raid |publisher=BBC News |date=2007-04-12 |accessdate=2013-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/6626093.stm |title=Rasta temple was 'not crack den' |publisher=BBC News |date=2007-05-04 |accessdate=2013-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the raid three people were charged with possession with the intent to supply a Class C drug.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/6556011.stm |title=Three in court after temple raid |publisher=BBC News |date=2007-04-14 |accessdate=2013-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ligali.org/article.php?id=766 |title=Meeting to challenge malicious police raid of Rasta Temple |publisher=Ligali.org |date= |accessdate=2013-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nobody was charged with possession of crack cocaine, and [[Spiritual use of cannabis|cannabis has religious significance]] for Rastafari. Lambeth Council have stated their intention of helping the temple elders find new premises to rent. By July 2007 the site had been demolished.

On 5 April 2008 the trial collapsed and all defendants were found not guilty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Owen Bowcott |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/apr/08/law.drugsandalcohol |title=Rastafarian temple drugs trial collapses &amp;#124; Law |publisher=The Guardian |date=2008-04-08 |accessdate=2013-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Work on demolishing the houses in the street began immediately after the eviction - {{convert|10|ft|m|adj=mid|-high}} fencing and 24-hour security made sure the houses were not resquatted before they got the chance to demolish. Demolition was completed in 2007.

In 2010 Lambeth Council and two housing associations, [[London and Quadrant]] and [[Family Mosaic]], put forward planning proposals for the land to be used for housing, 50% of which would be [[Public housing|social/affordable housing]], together with a re-sited adventure playground and One O'Clock Club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://southeasteleven.blogspot.com/2010/09/kennington-park-to-lose-play-area-to.html |title=Kennington Park to lose play area to new housing (see plans) |publisher=Southeasteleven.blogspot.com |date=2010-09-12 |accessdate=2013-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants''' is an international [[environmental law|environmental]] [[treaty]], signed in 2001 and effective from May 2004, that aims to eliminate or restrict the production and use of [[persistent organic pollutant]]s (POPs).

== History ==
In 1995, the Governing Council of the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP) called for global action to be taken on POPs, which it defined as “chemical substances that persist in the environment, [[Bioaccumulation|bio-accumulate]] through the [[food web]], and pose a risk of causing adverse effects to human health and the environment”.

Following this, the Intergovernmental Forum on Chemical Safety (IFCS) and the [[International Programme on Chemical Safety]] (IPCS) prepared an assessment of the 12 worst offenders, known as the ''dirty dozen''.

The INC met five times between June 1998 and December 2000 to elaborate the convention, and delegates adopted the Stockholm Convention on POPs at the Conference of the Plenipotentiaries convened from 22–23 May 2001 in Stockholm, Sweden.

The negotiations for the Convention were completed on 23 May 2001 in [[Stockholm]]. The convention entered into force on 17 May 2004 with [[ratification]] by an initial 128 parties and 151 signatories. Co-signatories agree to outlaw nine of the dirty dozen chemicals, limit the use of [[DDT]] to [[malaria]] control, and curtail inadvertent production of dioxins and [[furan]]s.

Parties to the convention have agreed to a process by which persistent toxic compounds can be reviewed and added to the convention, if they meet certain criteria for persistence and transboundary threat. The first set of new chemicals to be added to the Convention were agreed at a conference in [[Geneva]] on 8 May 2009.

As of June 2018, there are 182 parties to the Convention, (181 states and the [[European Union]]).&lt;ref name="UNTC" /&gt; Notable non-ratifying states include the United States, Israel, Malaysia, and Italy.

The Stockholm Convention was adopted to [[European Union|EU]] legislation in REGULATION (EC) No 850/2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2004:158:0007:0049:EN:PDF|title=REGULATION (EC) No 850/2004 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 29 April 2004 on persistent organic pollutants and amending Directive 79/117/EEC|author=|date=|website=europa.eu|accessdate=12 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary of provisions==
Key elements of the Convention include the requirement that developed countries provide new and additional financial resources and measures to eliminate production and use of intentionally produced POPs, eliminate unintentionally produced POPs where feasible, and manage and dispose of POPs wastes in an environmentally sound manner. Precaution is exercised throughout the Stockholm Convention, with specific references in the preamble, the objective, and the provision on identifying new POPs.

==Persistent Organic Pollutants Review Committee==
When adopting the Convention, provision was made for a procedure to identify additional POPs and the criteria to be considered in doing so. At the first meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP1), held in Punta del Este, Uruguay from 2–6 May 2005, the POPRC was established to consider additional candidates nominated for listing under the Convention.

The Committee is composed of 31 experts nominated by parties from the five United Nations regional groups and reviews nominated chemicals in three stages. The Committee first determines whether the substance fulfills POP screening criteria detailed in Annex D of the Convention, relating to its persistence, bioaccumulation, potential for long-range environmental transport (LRET), and toxicity. If a substance is deemed to fulfill these requirements, the Committee then drafts a risk profile according to Annex E to evaluate whether the substance is likely, as a result of its LRET, to lead to significant adverse human health and/or environmental effects and therefore warrants global action. Finally, if the POPRC finds that global action is warranted, it develops a risk management evaluation, according to Annex F, reflecting socioeconomic considerations associated with possible control measures. Based on this, the POPRC decides to recommend that the COP list the substance under one or more of the annexes to the Convention. The POPRC has met annually in Geneva, Switzerland since its establishment. 
	
The seventh meeting of the Persistent Organic Pollutants Review Committee (POPRC-7) of the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) took place from 10–14 October 2011 in Geneva, Switzerland. POPRC-8 was held from 15–19 October 2012 in Geneva, POPRC-9 to POPRC-13 were held in Rome.

== Listed substances ==
There were initially twelve distinct chemicals listed in three categories. Two chemicals, hexachlorobenzene and polychlorinated biphenyls, were listed in both categories A and C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Chemicals newly proposed for inclusion in Annexes A,B,C==
POPRC-7 considered three proposals for listing in Annexes A, B and/or C of the Convention: [[Polychlorinated naphthalene|chlorinated naphthalenes]] (CNs), [[hexachlorobutadiene]] (HCBD) and [[pentachlorophenol]] (PCP), its salts and esters. The proposal is the first stage of the POPRC's work in assessing a substance, and requires the POPRC to assess whether the proposed chemical satisfies the criteria in Annex D of the Convention. The criteria for forwarding a proposed chemical to the risk profile preparation stage are persistence, bioaccumulation, potential for long-range environmental transport (LRET), and adverse effects.

POPRC-8 proposed [[hexabromocyclododecane]] for listing in Annex A, with specific exemptions for production and use in expanded polystyrene and extruded polystyrene in buildings. This proposal was agreed at the sixth Conference of Parties on 28 April-10 May 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chm.pops.int/Convention/POPsReviewCommittee/LatestMeeting/POPRC8/POPRC8Followup/HBCDRecommendation/tabid/2912/Default.aspx|title=HBCD Recommendation|first=Stockholm|last=Convention|date=|website=chm.pops.int|accessdate=12 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/CN/2013/CN.934.2013-Eng.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

POPRC-9 proposed [[Polychlorinated naphthalene|di-,tri-,tetra-,penta-,hexa-, hepta- and octa-chlorinated napthalenes]], and hexachlorobutadiene for listing in Annexes A and C. It also set up further work on pentachlorophenol, its salts and esters, and decabromodiphenyl ether, perfluorooctanesulfonic acid, its salts and perfluorooctane sulfonyl chloride.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chm.pops.int/Convention/POPsReviewCommittee/LatestMeeting/POPRC9/POPRC9Documents/tabid/3281/Default.aspx|title=Stockholm Convention &gt; The Convention &gt; POPs Review Committee &gt; Meetings &gt; POPRC 9 &gt; Documents|first=Stockholm|last=Convention|date=|website=chm.pops.int|accessdate=12 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies ==
Although some critics have alleged that the treaty is responsible for the continuing death toll from malaria, in reality the treaty specifically permits the public health use of [[DDT]] for the control of [[mosquito]]es (the malaria [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author = Curtis, C.

As long as there are specific measures taken, such as use of DDT indoors, then the limited amount of DDT can be used in a regulated fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/iris/handle/10665/69945|title=The use of DDT in malaria vector control : WHO position statement|last=World Health Organization.

Another controversy would be certain POPs (which are continually active, specifically in the Arctic Biota) that were mentioned in the Stockholm Convention, but were not part of the Dirty Dozen such as Perfluorooctone sulfonates (PFOs).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Godduhn|first=Anna|last2=Duffy|first2=Lawrence K.|date=August 2003|title=Multi-generation health risks of persistent organic pollution in the far north: use of the precautionary approach in the Stockholm Convention|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1462-9011(03)00061-3|journal=Environmental Science and Policy|volume=6|issue=4|pages=341–353}}&lt;/ref&gt; PFOs have many general uses such as stain repellents but have many properties which can make it a dangerous due to the fact that PFOs can be highly resistant to environmental breakdown. PFOs can be toxic in terms of increased offspring death, decrease in body weight, and the disruption of neurological systems. What makes this compound controversial is the economic and political impact it can have among various countries and businesses.&lt;ref&gt;Thanh Wang, Yawei Wang, Chunyang Liao, Yaqi Cai and Guibin Jiang.

{{Suicide sidebar}}
A '''suicide method''' is any means by which a person completes [[suicide]], purposely ending their life.

{{TOC limit|3}}

==Cutting==
{{See also|Self-injury}}
{{Redirect|Hesitation wounds|for the 2010s punk band|Hesitation Wounds}}
[[Suicide]] by cutting might involve [[exsanguination]], [[infarction]], [[septic shock]] from certain ruptures such as [[appendicitis]], or drowning from a [[lung contusion]]. [[Exsanguination]] involves reducing the volume and pressure of the blood to below critical levels by inducing massive [[blood loss]]. It is usually the result of damage inflicted on [[arteries]]. The [[Internal carotid artery|carotid]], [[radial artery|radial]], [[ulnar artery|ulnar]] or [[femoral artery|femoral]] arteries may be targeted. Death may occur directly as a result of the [[desanguination]] of the body or via [[hypovolemia]], wherein the [[blood volume]] in the circulatory system becomes too low and results in the body shutting down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Klonsky|first1=E. D.|last2=May|first2=A. M.|title=Impulsivity and Suicide Risk: Review and Clinical Implications|journal=Psychiatric Times|date=2015|volume=32|issue=8|page=13|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those considering a [[suicide attempt]], or trying out the weapon to ascertain its effectiveness, may first make shallow cuts, referred to as ''hesitation wounds'' or ''tentative wounds'' in the literature. They are often non-lethal, multiple parallel cuts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pounder|first=Derrick|title=Lecture Notes in Forensic Medicine|url=http://www.dundee.ac.uk/forensicmedicine/notes/Lecture%20Notes%20in%20Forensic%20Medicine%20Derrick%20Pounder%2048pages.pdf|accessdate=16 April 2011|page=6|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614015411/http://www.dundee.ac.uk/forensicmedicine/notes/Lecture%20Notes%20in%20Forensic%20Medicine%20Derrick%20Pounder%2048pages.pdf|archive-date=14 June 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wrist cutting===
Wrist cutting is sometimes practiced with the goal of [[self-harm]] and not suicide; however, if the bleeding is copious or allowed to continue unchecked, [[cardiac arrhythmia]], followed by severe [[hypovolemia]], [[shock (circulatory)|shock]], [[circulatory collapse]] or [[cardiac arrest]], and death may ensue, in that order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dutton MD. MBA|first=Richard P.|title=Pathophysiology of Traumatic Shock|url=http://www.itaccs.com/traumacare/archive/2008_vol18_no1/Pathophysiology_of_Traumatic_Shock_Itaccs_vol18no1-4.pdf|website=Web|accessdate=23 August 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101009094747/http://www.itaccs.com/traumacare/archive/2008_vol18_no1/Pathophysiology_of_Traumatic_Shock_Itaccs_vol18no1-4.pdf|archivedate=9 October 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of a non-fatal suicide attempt, the person may experience injury of the [[tendons]] of the extrinsic flexor muscles, or the [[ulnar nerve|ulnar]] and [[median nerve|median]] nerves which control the muscles of the hand, both of which can result in temporary or permanent reduction in the victim's sensory or motor ability or also cause chronic somatic or autonomic pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Bukhari | first =AJ |author2=Saleem M |author3=Bhutta AR |author4=Khan AZ |author5=Abid KJ.  | title = Spaghetti wrist: management and outcome | journal = J Coll Physicians Surg Pak. | volume = 14 | issue =10 | pages = 608–11 |date=October 2004 | pmid = 15456551 | doi = 10.2004/JCPSP.608611| doi-broken-date =2018-09-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As in any class IV hemorrhage, aggressive [[resuscitation]] is required to prevent death of the patient; standard emergency bleeding control applies for pre-hospital treatment.

==Drowning==
{{Main|Drowning}}
[[File:Street Girl's End.jpg|thumb|right|A [[homeless]] girl contemplates [[drowning]] herself]]
Suicide by [[drowning]] is the act of deliberately submerging oneself in water or other liquid to prevent [[breath]]ing and [[asphyxia|deprive the brain of oxygen]]. Due to the body's natural tendency to come up for air, drowning attempts often involve the use of a heavy object to overcome this reflex. As the level of carbon dioxide in the victim's blood rises, the [[central nervous system]] sends the respiratory muscles an involuntary signal to contract, and the person breathes in water. Death usually occurs as the level of oxygen becomes too low to sustain the brain cells.  It is among the least common methods of suicide, typically accounting for less than 2% of all reported suicides in the United States.&lt;ref name='WISQARS'&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://webappa.cdc.gov/sasweb/ncipc/leadcaus10.html
| title = WISQARS Leading Causes of Death Reports
| accessdate = 2009-07-06
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Suffocation==
{{see also|Suicide bag|Inert gas asphyxiation}}
Suicide by [[suffocation]] is the act of inhibiting one's ability to breathe or limiting oxygen uptake while breathing, causing [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] and eventually [[asphyxia]]. This may involve an [[exit bag]] (a plastic bag fixed over the head) or confinement in an enclosed space without oxygen. These attempts involve using depressants to make the user pass out due to the oxygen deprivation before the instinctive panic and the urge to escape due to the [[hypercapnia|hypercapnic alarm response]].

It is impossible for someone to commit suicide by simply holding their breath, as the level of oxygen in the blood becomes too low, the brain sends an involuntary reflex, and the person breathes in as the respiratory muscles contract. Even if one is able to overcome this response to the point of becoming unconscious, in this condition, it's no longer possible to control breathing, and a normal rhythm is reestablished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kurzban|first=Robert|title=Why Can't You Hold Your Breath Until You're Dead?|url=http://www.epjournal.net/blog/2011/02/why-can%E2%80%99t-you-hold-your-breath-until-you%E2%80%99re-dead/|website=Web.|accessdate=23 August 2013|date=7 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of this, one is more likely to commit suicide through gas inhalation than attempting to prevent breathing all together. [[Inert gas]]es such as [[helium]], [[nitrogen]], and [[argon]], or toxic gases such as [[Carbon monoxide poisoning|carbon monoxide]] are commonly used in suicides by suffocation due to their ability to quickly render a person unconscious, and may cause death within minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.osha.gov/dts/shib/shib042704.html | title=Deaths Involving the Inadvertent Connection of Air-line Respirators to Inert Gas Supplies }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Goldstein M|title=Carbon monoxide poisoning|journal=Journal of Emergency Nursing|volume=34|issue=6|pages=538–542|date=December 2008|pmid=19022078|doi=10.1016/j.jen.2007.11.014|url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/short/3/5716/180|format=Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hypothermia==
{{Main|Hypothermia}}
Suicide by [[hypothermia]] is a slow death that goes through several stages. Hypothermia begins with mild symptoms, gradually leading to moderate and severe penalties. This may involve [[shivering]], [[delirium]], [[hallucination]]s, lack of coordination, sensations of warmth, then finally death. One's organs cease to function, though clinical [[brain death]] can be delayed.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

==Electrocution==
{{Main|Electrocution}}
Suicide by electrocution involves using a lethal [[electric shock]] to kill oneself. This causes arrhythmias of the heart, meaning that the heart does not contract in synchrony between the different chambers, essentially causing elimination of blood flow. Furthermore, depending on the amount of electric current, burns may also occur. In his opinion outlawing the [[electric chair]] as a method of execution, Justice [[William M. Connolly]] of the [[Nebraska Supreme Court]] stated that "electrocution inflicts intense pain and agonizing suffering", adding that it is “unnecessarily cruel in its purposeless infliction of physical violence and mutilation of the prisoner’s body.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/09/us/09penalty.html | work=The New York Times | title=Electrocution Is Banned in Last State to Rely on It| first=Adam | last=Liptak | date=2008-02-09 | accessdate=2010-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jumping from height==
{{Main|Jumper (suicide)|Self-defenestration}}
Jumping from height is the act of [[jumping]] from high altitudes, for example, from a window (self-defenestration or auto-defenestration), balcony or roof of a [[high rise building]], [[cliff]], [[dam]] or [[bridge]]. This method, in most cases, results in severe consequences if the attempt fails, such as [[paralysis]], organ damage, and [[bone fractures]].{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

In the United States, jumping is among the least common methods of dying by suicide (less than 2% of all reported suicides in the United States for 2005).&lt;ref name="WISQARS"/&gt;

In [[Hong Kong]], jumping is the most common method of dying by suicide, accounting for 52.1% of all reported suicide cases in 2006 and similar rates for the years prior to that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|authorlink=http://csrp.hku.hk |title=Method Used in Completed Suicide |website= |publisher=HKJC Centre for Suicide Research and Prevention, University of Hong Kong |year=2006 |url=http://csrp.hku.hk/WEB/eng/statistics.asp#3 |doi= |accessdate=2009-09-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090910011320/http://csrp.hku.hk/web/eng/statistics.asp |archivedate=2009-09-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Centre for Suicide Research and Prevention of the [[University of Hong Kong]] believes that it may be due to the abundance of easily accessible [[high rise]] buildings in Hong Kong.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

A common suicide method is to use a [[firearm]]. Generally, the [[bullet]] will be aimed at [[point-blank range]], often at the temple or, less commonly, into the mouth, under the chin or at the chest. Worldwide, firearm prevalence in suicides varies widely, depending on the acceptance and availability of firearms in a culture. The use of firearms in suicides ranges from less than 10% in Australia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aihw.gov.au/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=6442458840 |title=A review of suicide statistics in Australia|publisher=Government of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 50.5% in the U.S., where it is the most common method of suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.suicidology.org/c/document_library/get_file?folderId=262&amp;name=DLFE-636.pdf |title=U.S.A.

Surviving a self-inflicted gunshot may result in severe [[chronic pain]] for the patient as well as reduced cognitive abilities and motor function, [[subdural hematoma]], foreign bodies in the head, [[pneumocephalus]] and [[cerebrospinal fluid leak]]s.

When [[hanging]] one's self, the subject uses some type of [[wiktionary:ligature|ligature]], as in a rope or a cord, to form a [[noose]] (or loop) around the throat, with the opposite end secured to some fixture. Depending on the placement of the noose and other factors, the subject [[strangling|strangles]] or suffers a [[cervical fracture|broken neck]]. In the event of death, the actual cause often depends on the length of the drop; that is, the distance the subject falls before the rope goes taut.

In a "short drop", the victim may die from strangulation, in which the death may result from a [[asphyxia|lack of oxygen]] to the brain. The victim is likely to experience [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]], skin tingling, dizziness, vision narrowing, [[convulsion]]s, [[shock (circulatory)|shock]], and acute [[respiratory acidosis]]. One or both [[carotid arteries]] and/or the [[jugular vein]] may also be compressed sufficiently to cause [[cerebral ischemia]] and a hypoxic condition in the brain which will eventually result in or contribute to death. Hanging survivors typically have severe damage to the trachea and larynx, damage to the carotid arteries, damage to the spine, and brain damage due to [[cerebral anoxia]].

In a typical "long drop", the subject is likely to suffer one or more fractures of the [[cervical vertebrae]], generally between the second and fifth, which may cause [[paralysis]] or death.  In extremely long drops, the hanging may result in complete [[decapitation]].

Hanging is the prevalent means of suicide in [[pre-industrial society|pre-industrial societies]], and is more common in [[rural]] areas than in [[Urban area|urban]] areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Zi-xoFAPnPMC|title=Comprehensive Textbook of Suicidology|author1=Ronald W.

Silverman |author4=Bruce Michael Bongar |isbn=978-1-57230-541-0|year=2000| publisher=Guildford Press| page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also a common means of suicide in situations where other materials are not readily available, such as in [[prison]]s.

==Self-strangulation==
This method involves tightening a ligature around the neck so as to compress the carotid arteries, preventing the supply of oxygen to the brain and resulting in unconsciousness and death. The technique is also associated with certain types of judo holds and restraints, and auto-erotic asphyxiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Docker|first=Chris|title=Five Last Acts - The Exit Path|year=2013|isbn=9781482594096|chapter=Compression}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Atilgan M|title=A Case of Suicidal Ligature Strangulation by Using a Tourniquet Method|journal=Am J Forensic Med Pathol|year=2010|volume=31|issue=1|pages=85–86|doi=10.1097/paf.0b013e3181c21c24|pmid=19935390}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Demirci S|author2=Dogan K |author3=Erkol Z |author4=Gunaydin G |title=Suicide by Ligature Strangulation: Three Case Reports|journal=Am J Forensic Med Pathol|year=2009|volume=30|issue=4|pages=369–372|doi=10.1097/paf.0b013e318187e06b|pmid=19901818 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Maxeiner H|author2=Bockholdt B |title=Homicidal and suicidal ligature strangulation - a comparison of post-mortem findings|journal=Forensic Sci Int|year=2003|volume=137|issue=1|pages=60–66|doi=10.1016/s0379-0738(03)00279-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vehicular impact==
Another way of dying by suicide is deliberately placing oneself in the path of a large and fast-moving vehicle, resulting in fatal impact.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Failed attempts may result in profound injuries, such as massive [[fractures]], [[amputations]], [[concussion]] and severe [[brain damage|mental]] and [[physical disability|physical handicapping]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Suicide by Train Is a Growing Concern|author=Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar|work=Los Angeles Times|date=January 26, 2005|url=http://thetransitcoalition.us/news/lat20050126c.htm|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike on [[Rapid transit|underground railways]], in suicides involving above-ground railway lines, the victim will often simply stand or lie on the tracks, waiting for the arrival of the train. As the trains usually travel at high speeds (usually between 80 and 200&amp;nbsp;km/h), the driver is usually unable to bring the train to a halt before the collision. This type of suicide may be traumatizing to the driver of the train and may lead to [[post-traumatic stress disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.nj.com/insidejersey/index.ssf/2009/06/death_by_train.html|title=Death By Train|date=June 18, 2009|author=Mueller, Mark|publisher=The Star Ledger|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Suicides on tracks may take place through the person either jumping onto, walking, lying or sitting on the tracks. Lying on the tracks may result in decapitation. Accidents resulting from people jumping onto the tracks usually occur at daytime. Accidents including people walking, lying or sitting on the tracks usually occur at night when the driver's visibility is reduced, increasing the chance of completing suicide. People who commit suicide in this manner usually stay at or around the place for the suicide for an extended period of time before the actual suicide.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

====Europe====
In the [[Netherlands]], as many as 10% of all suicides are rail-related.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbs.nl/en-GB/menu/themas/gezondheid-welzijn/publicaties/artikelen/archief/2012/2012-3668-wm.htm|title=Suicide death rate up to 1,647|first=Statistics|last=Netherlands|website=www.cbs.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Germany]], 7% of all suicides occur in this manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://eurpub.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/16/2/173 | pmid = 16093307  |name-list-format=vanc| doi=10.1093/eurpub/cki060 | volume=16 | issue=2 |date=April 2006 | pages=173–8 | title = Ten-year incidence and time trends of railway suicides in Germany from 1991 to 2000 | last1 = Baumert | first1 = J. | journal = The European Journal of Public Health | last2 = Erazo | first2 = N | last3 = Ladwig | first3 = KH}}&lt;/ref&gt; To deal with an average of three suicide incidents per day, [[Deutsche Bahn]] is cooperating with a hospital in [[Malente]] to offer specific treatment to traumatized train drivers.

In recent years, some German train drivers succeeded in getting compensation payments from parents or spouses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/justiz/0,1518,453346,00.html | title = Lokführer erhält Schmerzensgeld vom Witwer einer Selbstmörderin | publisher = Der Spiegel | date = 2006-12-08}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/justiz/0,1518,787127,00.html | title = Lokführer bekommt Schmerzensgeld von Hinterbliebenen | publisher = Der Spiegel | date = 2011-09-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Sweden]], less densely populated and with a smaller proportion of the population living in proximity of railroad tracks, 5% of all suicides are rail-related. In Belgium, nearly 6% of suicides are rail related with a disproportionate amount occurring in the Dutch-speaking region (10% rate in Flanders). There is a low rate of direct death; one in two are failed attempts. The location of many suicides occur at or very close to stations, which is also uncharacteristic of suicides in other European countries. The disruption to the rail system can be substantial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/latest-news/628766/travel-news-euston-station-disruption-trains-suspended-london|title=Travel chaos to continue ALL day at busy London station after death on tracks|date=2017-07-11|work=Dailystar.co.uk|access-date=2018-06-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Belgium where rail service is frequently interrupted due to a high level of suicide by rail, families are expected to cover the substantial cost of rail network standstill.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sudinfo.be/archive/recup/1573637/article/2016-05-16/les-suicides-coutent-2-millions-a-la-sncb-qui-tente-de-se-faire-rembourser-aupre&lt;/ref&gt;

====Japan====
Trains on Japanese railroads cause a large number of suicides every year.  Suicide by train is seen as something of a social problem, especially in the larger cities such as [[Tokyo]] or [[Nagoya]], because it disrupts train schedules and if one occurs during the morning rush-hour, causes numerous commuters to arrive late for work.  However, suicide by train persists despite a common policy among life insurance companies to deny payment to the beneficiary in the event of suicide by train (payment is usually made in the event of most other forms of suicide).  Suicides involving the high-speed bullet-train, or ''[[Shinkansen]]'' are extremely rare, as the tracks are usually inaccessible to the public (i.e. elevated and/or protected by tall fences with barbed wire) and legislation mandates additional fines against the suicide victim's family and next-of-kin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/06/world/kunitachi-city-journal-japanese-trains-try-to-shed-a-gruesome-appeal.html|title=Kunitachi City Journal; Japanese Trains Try to Shed a Gruesome Appeal|last=French|first=Howard W.|date=2000-06-06|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2017-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like in Belgium, family members who survive the suicide by rail victim may be expected to cover the cost of rail disruption, which can be significantly extensive. It has been argued this prevents possible suicide as the victim would want to spare the family not only the trauma of a lost family member but also being sued in court however there is insufficient evidence to back this up.&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.japantimes.co.jp/yen-for-living/blood-on-the-tracks-who-pays-for-deadly-railway-accidents/&lt;/ref&gt;

====North America====
According to the [[Federal Railroad Administration]], in the U.S., there are 300 to 500 train suicides a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Striving to prevent suicide by train|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2010/02/09/shining_a_spotlight_on_suicide_by_train/?page=1|author=Noah Bierman|publisher=Boston Globe|date=February 9, 2010|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study of completed suicides on railway rights-of-ways by the [[Federal Railroad Administration]] found that the decedents tended to live near railroad tracks, were less likely to have access to firearms, and were significantly compromised by both severe mental disorder and substance abuse.&lt;ref&gt;Martino, Michael et al. (2013). [https://purl.fdlp.gov/GPO/gpo46565 Defining Characteristics of Intentional Fatalities on Railway Rights-of-Way in the United States, 2007–2010.] Washington, D.C.: [[United States Department of Transportation|U.S. Department of Transportation]], [[Federal Railroad Administration]].&lt;/ref&gt;

====Reducing the number of rail-related suicides====
Methods to reduce the number of rail-related suicides include [[CCTV]] surveillance of stretches where suicides frequently occur, often with direct links to the local police or surveillance companies. This enables the police or guards to be on the scene within minutes after the trespassing was noted. Public access to the tracks is also made more difficult by erecting fences. Trees and bushes are cut down around the tracks in order to increase driver visibility.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

In southern Sweden, where a suicide hotspot is located south of the university town Lund, CCTV cameras with direct links to the local police have been installed. Similar packages will be installed on other hotspots throughout the nation.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

In the Netherlands, where several suicide hotspots are located by rail tracks next to mental wards, loud speakers and strong lights that activate when trespassing is noted, have been installed next to these hotspots.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

===Metro systems===
Jumping in front of an oncoming [[Rapid transit|subway]] train has a 59% death rate, lower than the 90% death rate for [[Rail transport|rail]]-related suicides. This is most likely because trains traveling on open tracks travel relatively quickly, whereas trains arriving at a subway station are decelerating so that they can stop and board passengers.

Different methods have been used in order to decrease the number of suicide attempts in the underground: for instance, deep drainage pits halve the likelihood of fatality.
Separation of the passengers from the track by means of [[platform screen doors]] is being introduced in some stations, but is expensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Effect of station design on death in the London Underground: observational study|url=http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/319/7215/957|date=9 October 1999|author1=J Coats |author2=D P Walter |pmid=10514158|journal=BMJ|volume=319|issue=7215|page=957|pmc=28249|doi=10.1136/bmj.319.7215.957}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Car===
Some suicides are the result of intended car crashes. This especially applies to single-occupant, single-vehicle accidents, "because of the frequency of its use, the generally accepted inherent hazards of driving, and the fact that it offers the individual an opportunity to imperil or end his life without consciously confronting himself with his suicidal intent."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Selzer | first1 = M. L. | last2 = Payne | first2 = C. E. | year = 1992 | title = Automobile accidents, suicide, and unconscious motivation | doi = 10.1176/ajp.119.3.237 | journal = American Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 119 | issue = 3|pmid=13910542 | pages = 237–40 [239]}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is always the risk that a car accident will affect other road users; for example, a car that brakes abruptly or swerves to avoid a suicidal pedestrian may collide with something else on the road.

The real percentage of suicides among car accidents is not reliably known; studies by suicide researchers tell that "vehicular fatalities that are suicides vary from 1.6% to 5%".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 1977 | title = Suicide by vehicular crash | doi = 10.1176/ajp.134.2.175 | journal = American Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 134 | issue = 2| pages = 175–178 | last1=Schmidt, Jr. | first1= C.

S. |pmid=835740}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some suicides are misclassified as accidents, because suicide must be proven; "It is noteworthy that even when suicide is strongly suspected but a suicide note is not found, the case will be classified an 'accident.'"&lt;ref name="accident_or_suicide"&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 7676880 |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2248/is_n118_v30/ai_17150135/pg_1 | year = 1995 | last1 = Peck | first1 = DL | last2 = Warner | first2 = K | title = Accident or suicide? Single-vehicle car accidents and the intent hypothesis | volume = 30 | issue = 118 | pages = 463–72 | journal = Adolescence }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some researchers believe that suicides disguised as traffic accidents are far more prevalent than previously thought. One large-scale community survey in Australia among suicidal people provided the following numbers: "Of those who reported planning a suicide, 14.8% (19.1% of male planners and 11.8% of female planners) had conceived to have a motor vehicle "accident"... Of all attempters, 8.3% (13.3% of male attempters) had previously attempted via motor vehicle collision."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Murray | first1 = D. | last2 = de Leo | first2 = D. | title = Suicidal behavior by motor vehicle collision | journal = Traffic Inj Prev | volume = 8 | issue = 3 | pages = 244–7 |date=September 2007 | doi = 10.1080/15389580701329351 | pmid = 17710713 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aircraft===
Between 1983 and 2003, 36 pilots [[pilot suicide|died through suicide by aircraft]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 16110685 | year = 2005 | last1 = Bills | first1 = CB | last2 = Grabowski | first2 = JG | last3 = Li | first3 = G | title = Suicide by aircraft: A comparative analysis | volume = 76 | issue = 8 | pages = 715–9 | journal = Aviation, Space, and Environmental Medicine |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/asma/asem/2005/00000076/00000008/art00001}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been well documented [[suicide attacks]] by aircraft, including Japanese [[Kamikaze]] attacks, and the [[September 11 attacks]]. On 24 March 2015, Germanwings co-pilot Andreas Lubitz deliberately crashed [[Germanwings Flight 9525]] into the [[French Alps]] to commit suicide, killing 150 people with him.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"&gt;{{cite news | last1=Clark |first1=Nicola |last2=Bilefsky |first2=Dan |title=Germanwings Co-Pilot Deliberately Crashed Airbus Jet, French Prosecutor Says |url=http://nyti.ms/1yb7Zcu |accessdate=26 March 2015 |work=The New York Times |date=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CBC2"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/germanwings-flight-4u9525-co-pilot-andreas-lubitz-deliberately-crashed-jet-prosecutor-1.3010045 |title=Germanwings Flight 4U9525: Co-pilot put plane into descent, prosecutor says |date=26 March 2015 |publisher=[[CBC News]] |accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Suicide by pilot has also been proposed as a potential cause for the disappearance and following destruction of [[Malaysian Airlines Flight 370]] in 2014,&lt;ref name="BBC News"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wescott|first1=Richard|title=Flight MH370: Could it have been suicide?|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-31736835|website=[[BBC News]]|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=20 June 2017|ref=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; with supporting evidence being found in a [[flight simulator]] application used by the doomed flight's pilot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pells|first1=Rachael|title=MH370 pilot flew 'suicide route' on a simulator 'closely matching' his final flight|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/australasia/mh370-pilot-flew-suicide-route-simulator-final-flight-missing-malaysian-airlines-a7152581.html|website=[[The Independent]]|publisher=The Independent|accessdate=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Poison==
Suicide can be performed by using fast-acting [[poison]]s, such as [[hydrogen cyanide]], or substances which are known for their high levels of [[toxicity]] to humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://forums.yellowworld.org/archive/index.php/t-3947.html |title=Poisoning drugs |publisher=Forums.yellowworld.org |accessdate=2012-01-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111126204613/http://forums.yellowworld.org/archive/index.php/t-3947.html |archivedate=2011-11-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, most of the people of [[Jonestown]] died when [[Jim Jones]], the leader of a [[religious sect]], organized a [[mass suicide]] by drinking a cocktail of [[diazepam]] and [[cyanide]] in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoplease.com/spot/jonestown1.html Ministry of Terror - The Jonestown Cult Massacre], Elissayelle Haney, Infoplease, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Sufficient doses of some plants like the [[Atropa belladonna|belladonna]] family, [[castor beans]], ''[[Jatropha curcas]]'' and others, are also toxic. Poisoning through the means of toxic plants is usually slower and is relatively painful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctrl-c.liu.se/~ingvar/methods/poison.html |title=Poisoning methods |publisher=Ctrl-c.liu.se |accessdate=2012-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pesticide===
Worldwide, 30% of suicides are from [[pesticide poisoning]]s. The use of this method, however, varies markedly in different areas of the world, from 4% in Europe to more than 50% in the Pacific region.&lt;ref name="Gunnell D, Eddleston M, Phillips MR, Konradsen F 2007 357"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gunnell D, Eddleston M, Phillips MR, Konradsen F |title=The global distribution of fatal pesticide self-poisoning: Systematic review |journal=BMC Public Health |volume=7|page=357 |year=2007 |pmid=18154668 |pmc=2262093 |doi=10.1186/1471-2458-7-357 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Poisoning by farm chemicals is very common among women in the Chinese countryside, and is regarded as a major social problem in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Rural China's suicide problem | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/6711415.stm | date=2007-06-04 | accessdate=2010-03-20 | work=BBC News | first=Daniel | last=Griffiths}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Finland, the highly lethal pesticide [[Parathion]] was commonly used for suicide in the 1950s. When access to the chemical was restricted, other methods replaced it, leading researchers to conclude that restricting certain suicide methods does little to impact the overall suicide rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1192/bjp.166.1.35|author1=A Ohberg |author2=J Lonnqvist |author3=S Sarna |author4=E Vuori |author5=A Penttila |title=Trends and availability of suicide methods in Finland.

===Drug overdose===
{{Main|Drug overdose}}
[[Overdose]] is a method of suicide which involves taking [[medication]] in doses greater than the indicated levels, or in a combination that will interact either to cause harmful effects or increase the potency of one or other of the substances.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

An overdose is often the expressed preferred method of [[Euthanasia|dignified dying]] among members of right-to-die societies. A poll among members of right-to-die society [[Exit International]] suggested that 89% would prefer to take a pill, rather than use a [[Suicide bag|plastic exit bag]], a CO generator, or use "slow euthanasia".&lt;ref&gt;[[Philip Nitschke]]. [[The Peaceful Pill Handbook]]. Exit International US, 2007. {{ISBN|0-9788788-2-5}}, p 33&lt;/ref&gt; Death by helium inhalation however is the more common method preferred in practice, largely owing to its reliability.&lt;ref&gt;Howard M, Hall M, Jeffrey D et al, "[http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/78181/heliumsuicide.pdf;jsessionid=D092B0E3A7286434E6064E09D10618C8?sequence=1 ''Suicide by Asphyxiation due to Helium Inhalation''], Am J Forensic Med Pathol 2010; accessed 12 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Reliability of the drugs method highly depends on chosen drugs and additional measures such as the use of [[antiemetic]]s to prevent vomiting. Average fatality rate for overdoses in the U.S. is estimated to be only 1.8%.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, Geo. ''[http://www.suicidemethods.net/ Suicide and Attempted Suicide: Methods and Consequences] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071108215120/http://www.suicidemethods.net/ |date=November 8, 2007 }}''. New York: Carroll &amp; Graf, 2001. {{ISBN|0-7867-0940-5}}, p. 230&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, assisted suicide group [[Dignitas (euthanasia group)|Dignitas]] reported no single failure among 840 cases (fatality rate 100%), where an overdose of pentobarbital, the active agent in former hypnotic medication [[Nembutal]], was used in combination with antiemetic drugs.&lt;ref name="tagesspiegel_interview"&gt;[http://www.tagesspiegel.de/weltspiegel/Sterbehilfe-Dignitas-Minelli;art1117,2502357 Wenn Sie das trinken, gibt es kein Zurück] ''Tagesspiegel.de'' Retrieved 2008-04-12&lt;/ref&gt;

While [[barbiturate]]s (such as Seconal or Nembutal) have long been an option for suicide, they are becoming increasingly difficult for potential suicide victims to acquire. Dutch right-to-die society WOZZ proposed several safe alternatives to barbiturates for use in euthanasia.&lt;ref&gt;Guide to a Humane Self-Chosen Death by Dr. Pieter Admiraal et al. WOZZ Foundation www.wozz.nl, Delft, The Netherlands. {{ISBN|90-78581-01-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Peaceful Pill Handbook]]'' suggests the still easy availability of solutions containing pentobarbital in [[Mexico]], where they are available over-the-counter from [[Veterinary medicine|veterinarians]] for animal [[euthanasia]].

A typical drug overdose uses random prescription and [[over-the-counter substance]]s. In this case, death is highly uncertain, and an attempt may leave a person alive but with severe [[Organ (anatomy)|organ]] damage, although that itself may in turn eventually prove fatal. Drugs taken orally may also be [[Vomiting|vomited]] back out before being absorbed. Considering the very high doses needed, vomiting or [[loss of consciousness|losing consciousness]] before taking enough of the active agent is often a major problem for people attempting this.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

[[Analgesic]] overdose attempts are among the most common, due to easy availability of over-the-counter substances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last =Brock |first =Anita |author2=Sini Dominy |author3=Clare Griffiths  |date=6 November 2003 |title = Trends in suicide by method in England and Wales, 1979 to 2001 |journal = Health Statistics Quarterly |volume = 20 |pages = 7–18 |issn = 1465-1645 |url = http://www.statistics.gov.uk/CCI/article.asp?ID=1538&amp;Pos=4&amp;ColRank=1&amp;Rank=176 |accessdate = 2007-06-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Overdose may also take place when mixing medications in a cocktail with one another, or with alcohol or illegal drugs. This method may leave confusion over whether the death was a suicide or accidental, especially when alcohol or other judgment-impairing substances are also involved and no [[suicide note]] was left behind.

===Carbon monoxide===
{{See also|Carbon monoxide poisoning}}
A particular type of poisoning involves inhalation of high levels of carbon monoxide. Death usually occurs through [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]]. In most cases [[carbon monoxide]] (CO) is used because it is easily available as a product of incomplete [[combustion]]; for example, it is released by [[car]]s and some types of [[heater]]s. A failed attempt can result in memory loss and other symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;Docker C, Five Last Acts - The Exit Path 2013:368.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hay P, Denson L, van Hoof M, Blumenfeld N, ''The neuropsychiatry of carbon monoxide poisoning in attempted suicide: a prospective controlled study,'' J Psychosom Res. 2002 Aug;53(2):699-708.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Carbon monoxide poisoning: Four kinds of survivors'' {{cite web |url=http://www.carbon-monoxide-survivor.com/carbon-monoxide-poisoning-four-kinds-of-survivors.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140512225910/http://www.carbon-monoxide-survivor.com/carbon-monoxide-poisoning-four-kinds-of-survivors.html |archivedate=2014-05-12 |df= }}, accessed 12 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Carbon monoxide is a colorless and odorless [[gas]], so its presence cannot be detected by sight or smell. It acts by binding preferentially to the [[hemoglobin]] in the victim's blood, displacing oxygen molecules and progressively deoxygenating the blood, eventually resulting in the failure of [[cellular respiration]], and death. Carbon monoxide is extremely dangerous to bystanders and people who may discover the body, so "[[Right to die|Right to Die]]" advocates like [[Philip Nitschke]] recommend the use of [[Inert gas asphyxiation|safer alternatives]] like [[nitrogen]], for example in his [[Euthanasia device#Exit's euthanasia device|EXIT euthanasia device]].

In the past, before [[Air Quality Index|air quality]] regulations and [[catalytic converter]]s, suicide by carbon monoxide poisoning would often be achieved by running a car's engine in a closed space such as a garage, or by redirecting a running car's exhaust back inside the cabin with a hose. [[Exhaust gas|Motor car exhaust]] may have contained up to 25% carbon monoxide.

The incidence of suicide by carbon monoxide poisoning through [[charcoal-burning suicide|burning charcoal]], such as a [[barbecue]] in a sealed room, appears to have risen. This has been referred to by some as "death by [[hibachi]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1136/bmj.326.7387.498 | pmid = 12609951 | pmc = 1125377 | title = Media influence on suicide | year = 2003 | last1 = Howe | first1 = A. | journal = BMJ | volume = 326 | issue = 7387 | page = 498  }}&lt;/ref&gt; As with other suicide methods, charcoal burning suicide attempters can live from the attempt, which typically leaves a person with severe brain damage due to [[cerebral anoxia]].

===Other toxins===
Detergent-related suicide involves mixing household chemicals to produce [[hydrogen sulfide]] or other [[poison]]ous gases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://canadianpress.google.com/article/ALeqM5iUkmoUiRV1bMiSqP0S0FUNTNn4dg |title=Japanese girl commits suicide with detergent |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080429185504/http://canadianpress.google.com/article/ALeqM5iUkmoUiRV1bMiSqP0S0FUNTNn4dg | archivedate=29 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cscs.txstate.edu/icjs/downloads/Safety%20Alerts/DetergentSuicideCase.pdf CSCS.txstate.edu] {{dead link|date=December 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tena911.org/ChemicalSuicideMemo%5B1%5D.pdf Tena911.org] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dcfa.org/Files/Docs%202010/ChemicalSuicide%200210.pdf DCFA.org]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The suicide rates by domestic gas fell from 1960 to 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Changes in the methods used for suicide in 16 countries from 1960 to 1980|author=D Lester|year=1990|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119996644/abstract|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;|doi=10.1111/j.1600-0447.1990.tb06492.x|journal=Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica|volume=81|issue=3|pages=260–261|pmid=2343750}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the 19th century in Britain there were more suicides from [[Phenol|carbolic acid]] than from any other poison because there was no restriction on its sale. [[Athelstan Braxton Hicks|Braxton Hicks]] and other coroners called for its sale to be prohibited.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/infomark.do?&amp;source=gale&amp;prodId=TTDA&amp;userGroupName=rtl_ttda&amp;tabID=T003&amp;docPage=article&amp;searchType=AdvancedSearchForm&amp;docId=CS169270073&amp;type=multipage&amp;contentSet=LTO&amp;version=1.0|title=Mr. A.

Several creatures, such as spiders, snakes, and scorpions, carry venoms that can easily and quickly kill a person. These substances can be used to conduct suicide. For example, [[Cleopatra]] supposedly had an [[Asp (reptile)|asp]] bite her when she heard of [[Marc Antony]]'s death.&lt;ref&gt;See:
*  Strabo, ''Geographica'', Book 17, Chapter 1, paragraph 10:  Octavian "forced Antony to put himself to death and Cleopatra to come into his power alive; but a little later she too put herself to death secretly, while in prison, by the bite of an asp or (for two accounts are given) by applying a poisonous ointment" …

There have been several documented cases of deliberately contracting a fatal disease such as [[HIV/AIDS]] as a means of suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Contracting AIDS as a means of committing suicide|author1=Frances, Richard J. |author2=Wikstrom, Thomas |author3=Alcena, Valiere |journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry|year=1985|volume=142|issue=5|page=656 |doi=10.1176/ajp.142.5.656b}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Flavin, Daniel K. |author2=Franklin, John E. |author3=Frances, Richard J. |journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry|year=1986|volume=143|issue=11|pages=1440–1442|doi=10.1176/ajp.143.11.1440|title=The acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and suicidal behavior in alcohol-dependent homosexual men |pmid=3777237}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ronald W.

==Immolation==
{{Main|Self-immolation}}
[[Self-immolation|Immolation]] usually refers to suicide by [[fire]]. It has been used as a protest tactic, most famously by [[Thích Quảng Đức]] in 1963 to protest the [[South Vietnam]]ese government's systematic anti-Buddhist, pro-Catholic policies; by [[Malachi Ritscher]] in 2006 to protest the [[United States of America|United States]]' involvement in the [[Iraq War]]; and by [[Mohamed Bouazizi]] in [[Tunisia]] which started the [[Tunisian Revolution]] in 2011 and the [[Arab Spring]].{{citation needed|date=October 2010}}

Self-immolation was also carried out as a ritual known as ''[[Sati (practice)|sati]]'' in certain parts of [[India]], where a [[Hindu]] wife immolated herself in her dead husband's funeral pyre, either voluntarily or by coercion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sos-sexisme.org/english/sati2.htm |title=SATI |publisher=Sos-sexisme.org |accessdate=2010-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Latin]] root of "immolate" means "sacrifice", and is not restricted to the use of fire, though in common US media usage the term immolation refers to suicide by fire.

This method of suicide is relatively rare due to the long and painful experience one has to go through before [[death]] sets in. This is also contributed to by the ever-present [[risk]] that the fire is extinguished before death sets in, and in that way causes one to live with severe [[burn]]ings, scar tissue, and the emotional impact of such injuries.

===Volcano===
Suicide by [[volcano]] involves jumping into molten [[lava]] in an active [[volcanic crater]], [[fissure vent]], [[lava flow]] or [[lava lake]]. The actual cause of death may be as a result of the fall (see [[Suicide methods#Jumping from height|jumping from height]]), contact burns, radiant heat or asphyxiation from volcanic gases. According to some ancient sources, philosopher [[Empedocles]] jumped into the [[Mount Etna|Aetna]] trying to make everybody believe that he had disappeared from the Earth to become a god; this was frustrated when the volcano spat out one of his [[bronze]] sandals. Modern suicides have taken place in numerous volcanoes, but the most famous is [[Mount Mihara]] in [[Japan]]. In 1933, [[Kiyoko Matsumoto]] died by suicide by jumping into the Mihara crater. A trend of [[copycat suicide]]s followed, as 944 people jumped into the same crater over the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Diana Kendall|title=Sociology in Our Times: The Essentials|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2011|page=24|isbn=978-1-111-30550-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 1200 people attempted suicide in two years before a barrier was erected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Cedric A. Mims|title=When we die|publisher=Robinson|year=1998|page=40|isbn=978-1-85487-529-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original barrier was replaced with a higher fence topped with barbed wire after another 619 people jumped in 1936.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Edward Robb Ellis |author2=George N.

==Ritual suicide==
Ritual suicide is performed in a prescribed way, often as part of a religious or cultural practice.

===Seppuku===
{{main|Seppuku}}
''Seppuku'' ("cut-belly", used in writing) or ''hara-kiri'' ("belly slitting", used when talking) is a [[Japan]]ese [[ritual]] method of suicide, practiced mostly in the medieval era, though some isolated cases appear in modern times. For example, [[Yukio Mishima]] died by seppuku in 1970 after a failed ''[[coup d'état]]'' intended to restore full power to the [[Hirohito|Japanese emperor]].&lt;ref&gt;Nathan, John. ''Mishima: A biography'', Little Brown and Company: Boston/Toronto, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike other methods of suicide, this was regarded as a way of preserving one's honor. The ritual is part of ''[[bushido]]'', the code of the ''[[samurai]]''.

As originally performed solely by an individual, it was an extremely painful method by which to die. Dressed ceremonially, with his [[sword]] placed in front of him and sometimes seated on special cloth, the [[warrior]] would prepare for death by writing a [[death poem]]. The samurai would open his ''[[kimono]]'', take up his ''[[wakizashi]]'' (short sword), [[Japanese war fan|fan]], or a ''[[tantō]]'' and plunge it into his [[Human abdomen|abdomen]], making first a left-to-right cut and then a second slightly upward stroke. As the custom evolved, a selected attendant (''[[kaishakunin]]'', his second) stood by, and on the second stroke would perform ''[[daki-kubi]]'', where the warrior is all but [[Decapitation|decapitated]] leaving only a slight band of flesh attaching the head to the body, so as to not let the head fall off and roll on the ground, which was considered dishonorable in feudal Japan. The act eventually became so highly ritualistic that the samurai would only have to reach for his sword, and his ''kaishakunin'' would execute the killing stroke. Later still, there would be no sword, but something like a fan for which the samurai would reach.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

===Autosacrifice===
[[Human sacrifice]] was a religious activity throughout [[Mesoamerica]]. In [[Aztec]] and [[Mayan civilization|Maya]] culture, autosacrifice involving self-[[decapitation]] by priests and kings is depicted in artworks.&lt;ref&gt;Cecelia Klein. "The Ideology of Autosacrifice at the Templo Mayor" in E. H. Boone, ed. ''The Aztec Templo Mayor'' pp. 293-370.

Some forms of [[Durga]] worship in [[India]]n [[Hinduism]] involve a male devotee offering himself as a sacrifice through ritual self-decapitation with a curved sword. This is designed to obtain a favor from the deity for a third party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Miranda Eberle Shaw|title=Buddhist goddesses of India|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2006|page=416|isbn=978-0-691-12758-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=George Cœdès|title=The Indianized states of Southeast Asia|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|year=1968|page=101|isbn=978-0-8248-0368-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Starvation==
{{Main|Starvation}}

A [[hunger strike]] may ultimately lead to death. Starvation has been used by [[Hindu]] and [[Jain]] monks as a ritual method of penance (known as [[Prayopavesa]] and [[Santhara]] respectively) or as a method of speeding up one's own death,&lt;ref&gt;Docker C, ''The Art and Science of Fasting'' in: Smith C, Docker C, Hofsess J, Dunn B, Beyond Final Exit 1995&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Catharism|Albigensians or Cathars]] also fasted after receiving the 'consolamentum' sacrament, in order to die while in a morally perfect state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=xAmMNnJlfnoC&amp;pg=PA90&amp;dq=cathars+starvation#v=onepage&amp;q=starvation&amp;f=false |title=The New Encyclopedia of the Occult - John Michael Greer - Google Books |accessdate=2014-02-04|isbn=9781567183368 |last1=Greer |first1=John Michael |year=2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This method of death is often associated with political protest, such as the [[1981 Irish Hunger Strike]] by Irish republican paramilitary prisoners demanding [[prisoner of war]] status, of whom ten died. The explorer [[Thor Heyerdahl]] refused to eat or take medication for the last month of his life, after he was diagnosed with cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

[[Anorexia nervosa]] has been referred to as a subconscious form of suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Farnsworth|first=D|title=Bombastic Gadflies|url=https://books.google.com/?id=A-2-5GMBhXsC&amp;pg=PR89&amp;dq=anorexia+subconscious+suicide#v=onepage&amp;q=anorexia%20subconscious%20suicide&amp;f=false|isbn=9781460918715|date=2011-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, an anorexia nervosa death caused by self-starvation is not listed on death certificates as suicide. In the UK, refusal to adhere to norms regarding food and drink consumption can lead to being detained, treated and even force fed under section 3 of the [[Mental Health Act 1983]]. The effects of this can be substantial and may result in 'sectioning/[[involuntary commitment]], with some cases demonstrating a level of persistence from mental health professionals in the resistance of such methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher= BBC News|url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-22984708|accessdate = 2013-06-24|title = Beth's Story: What is it like to be sectioned?|location= London|first= Lucy|last= Wallis|date=2002-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effects of force feeding have even been likened to "sexual assault" by some scholars like [[June Purvis]] (Professor of Sociology at Portsmouth University); who cites the ill treatment of women in the [[Suffragette]] movement. One argument, put forward by the historian and journalist [[George Dangerfield]] denoted the treatment as "No more than extremely unpleasant". The women themselves claiming the process was "frightfully indignified".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher= Times Higher Education|url = http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/93438.article|title = Force-feeding of hunger-striking suffraggettes|location=London|first=June|last=Purvis|date=2014-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The moral issues faced by medical professionals handling such treatments are still present today.

==Dehydration==
{{main|Terminal dehydration}}
Death from dehydration can take from several days to a few weeks. This means that unlike many other suicide methods, it cannot be accomplished impulsively. Those who die by terminal dehydration typically lapse into unconsciousness before death, and may also experience [[delirium]] and deranged [[serum sodium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Science, Hospice and Terminal Dehydration|author=Baumrucker, Steven|publisher=American Journal of Hospice and Palliative Medicine|volume=16|date=May–June 1999|issue=3|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Discontinuation of hydration does not produce true thirst, although a sensation of dryness of the mouth often is reported as "thirst." The evidence this is not true thirst is extensive and shows the ill feeling is not relieved by giving fluids intravenously, but is relieved by wetting the tongue and lips and proper care of the mouth. Patients with [[edema]] tend to take longer to die of dehydration because of the excess fluid in their bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.preciouslegacy.com/chap13.html|title=Treatment of Pain and Suffering in the Terminally Ill|author=Lieberson, Alan D.|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Terminal dehydration has been described as having substantial advantages over physician-assisted suicide with respect to self-determination, access, professional integrity, and social implications. Specifically, a patient has a right to refuse treatment and it would be a personal assault for someone to force water on a patient, but such is not the case if a doctor merely refuses to provide lethal medication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://archinte.highwire.org/cgi/content/summary/153/24/2723|title=Patient Refusal of Hydration and Nutrition|author1=James L.

==Suicide attack==
{{Main|Suicide attack}}
A [[suicide attack]] is an attack in which the attacker (''attacker'' being either an individual or a group) intends to kill others and intends to die in the process of doing so (e.g. [[Columbine High School massacre|Columbine]], [[Virginia Tech massacre|Virginia Tech]] and [[9/11]]). In a suicide attack in the strictest sense, the attacker dies by the attack itself, for example in an explosion or crash caused by the attacker. The term is sometimes loosely applied to an incident in which the intention of the attacker is not clear, though he is almost sure to die by the defense or retaliation of the attacked party, e.g., "[[suicide by cop]]", that is, menacing or assaulting an [[Police#Weapons|armed]] [[police officer]] with a weapon or apparent or proclaimed harmful intent which all but ensures that the officer will use deadly force to terminate the attack. This can also be referred to as murder-suicide.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

Such attacks are typically motivated by religious or political ideologies, and have been carried out using numerous methods. For example, attackers might attach [[explosive]]s directly to their bodies before [[Detonation|detonating]] themselves close to their target, also known as [[suicide attack|suicide bombing]]. They may use a [[car bomb]] or other machinery to cause maximum damage (e.g. Japanese ''[[kamikaze]]'' pilots during [[World War II]]).{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

==Indirect suicide==
Indirect suicide is the act of setting out on an obviously fatal course without directly dying by the act upon oneself. Indirect suicide is differentiated from legally defined suicide by the fact that the actor does not pull the figurative (or literal) trigger. Examples of indirect suicide include a soldier enlisting in the [[army]] with the express intention and expectation of being killed in combat, or someone could be provoking an armed officer into using lethal force against them. The latter is generally called "[[suicide by cop]]". In some instances the subject commits a capital crime in hope of being [[death penalty|sentenced to death]].{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

Evidence exists for numerous examples of suicide by capital crime in colonial [[Australia]]. Convicts seeking to escape their brutal treatment would murder another individual. This was necessary due to a religious taboo against direct suicide. A person dying by suicide was believed to be destined for hell, whereas a person committing murder could absolve their sins before execution. In its most extreme form, groups of prisoners on the extremely brutal penal colony of [[Norfolk Island]] would form suicide lotteries. Prisoners would draw straws with one prisoner murdering another. The remaining participants would witness the crime, and would be sent away to Sydney as capital trials could not be held on Norfolk Island, thus earning a break from the Island. There is uncertainty as to the extent of suicide lotteries. While surviving contemporary accounts claim that the practice was common, such claims are probably exaggerated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hughes | first = Robert | authorlink = Robert Hughes (critic) | title = The Fatal Shore, The Epic Story of Australia's Founding | publisher =Vintage Books | edition = first  | date = 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Animal attacks===

Some people have chosen to indirectly commit suicide by being attacked by predatory animals such as sharks and crocodiles, and in some cases the person has been eaten alive; for example, in 2011 in eastern South Africa a depressed man (who wanted to be attacked by a crocodile) jumped into a river and was consumed by a crocodile.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.foxnews.com/world/2011/04/19/south-african-police-say-man-killed-going-croc-infested-waters.html ''South African Police Say Man Killed Himself By Going Into Croc-Infested Waters.''

Retrieved November 23, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in 2002 a depressed woman killed herself by jumping into a crocodile pond at the [[Samutprakarn Crocodile Farm and Zoo]] in Thailand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/2186323.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Asia-Pacific - Thai woman eaten by crocodiles|website=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 a second woman killed herself by jumping into the same crocodile pond in Thailand.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-29218557 ''Thailand Woman Dead After Jumping Into Crocodile Pit.'' bbc.com. Retrieved November 23, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Both women were eaten alive.

A number of books have been written as aids in suicide, including ''[[Final Exit]]'' and ''[[The Peaceful Pill Handbook]]'', the latter of which overlaps with [[euthanasia]] methods. Many books on this topic have been [[List of books banned by governments|challenged and banned]] due to controversy. However, ones such as ''[[The Complete Manual of Suicide]]'' state that they neither encourage nor discourage suicide.

There are also [[suicide site]]s. These sites include [[suicide bridge]]s such as the [[Golden Gate Bridge]] (which has had 1558 accounted deaths as of 2012, with only 33 having survived)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/he_jumped_off_the_golden_gate_bridge_VsTOqBsPyVY92HMvbmuHCL |title= He jumped off the Golden Gate Bridge . . . and lived! |last= Hines |first= Kevin |accessdate=2007-10-19 |date=12 November 2006 | work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Lover's Leap]]s, which are named so for their association with legends of romantic tragedy.

[[Image:KHO toinen jaosto.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The second section of the Supreme Administrative Court of Finland in session]]
The '''Supreme Administrative Court of Finland''' ({{Lang-fi|korkein hallinto-oikeus}}, {{Lang-sv|högsta förvaltningsdomstolen}}) is the highest court in the Finnish [[Judicial system of Finland#Administrative Courts|administrative court system]], parallel to the [[Supreme Court of Finland]]. Its jurisdiction covers the legality of the decisions of government officials, and its decisions are final. Appeals are made to the Supreme Administrative Court from the decisions of the administrative courts of [[Helsinki]], [[Turku]], [[Hämeenlinna]], [[Kouvola]], [[Kuopio]], [[Vaasa]], [[Oulu]], [[Rovaniemi]] and [[Åland Islands]], the Market Court, and the Council of State.

In most issues, it is possible to appeal to the Supreme Administrative Court of Finland from the judgment of the administrative court. However, in some case areas of administrative law, an appeal requires a leave of appeal from the Supreme Administrative Court. The most important such area are insurance cases. In some restricted areas of law, for example, in [[parking fines]], the decision of the administrative court is final and cannot be appealed to the Supreme Administrative Court.

In administrative matters, the Supreme Administrative Court has the sole power to grant extraordinary means of appeals, which are the annulment of a decision, a complaint against it, or an extension of the already-lapsed time of appeal.

The Council of State, i.e. the Finnish government, acts in some cases as an administrative authority. The decisions it makes in this competence can be appealed against on the grounds of legality of the decision.

As in all Finnish administrative courts, the legal costs of both parties in the Supreme Administrative Court are born, unless it is reasonable to award the prevailing party all or part of the costs. Nonetheless, when the authority prevails against a private claimant, it must bear all its costs, unless the private party has made a frivolous claim.

The Court has a President, 20 Justices and 4 Temporary Justices, organized into three chambers of five Justices. In addition, there are 16 Expert Counsellors. In cases concerning water, environmental protection and intellectual property, the chamber is composed of five Justices and two Expert Counsellors.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kho.fi/en/25920.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the Court processed 4044 cases, with an average time of hearing of 12.2 months.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kho.fi/uploads/7kzdz83b4gc_1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''undervalue transaction''' is a transaction entered into by a [[company (law)|company]]&lt;ref&gt;Some legal systems also apply undervalue transactions to insolvent individuals&lt;/ref&gt; who subsequently goes into [[bankruptcy]] which the court orders be set aside, usually upon the application of a [[liquidator (law)|liquidator]] for the benefit of the debtor's creditors.&lt;ref&gt;See for example, section 238 of the Insolvency Act 1986 in the [[United Kingdom]], and section 558FB of the [[Corporations Act 2001]] in [[Australia]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Under [[Australian insolvency law]] they are referred to as '''uncommercial transactions'''.

Under ordinary principles of [[contract law]], the courts will not generally look into the adequacy of the [[consideration]] provided by either side.  However, if a company is in real peril of going into bankruptcy, many legal systems provide a mechanism that transactions which are seriously commercially disadvantageous to the company can be unwound, so as to prevent prejudice to the creditors of the company.

Normally, for a transaction to be set aside as an undervalue transaction, the liquidator or equivalent must demonstrate that:
#the consideration received by the company in the transaction, in money or money's worth is significantly less than the value, in money or money's worth, provided by the company;
#the transaction was entered into during the "vulnerability period"; and
#at the time of the transaction, the company was unable to pay its debts as they fell due, or became unable to pay its debts as they fell due as a result of the transaction.&lt;ref&gt;This is the ''cash-flow'' test of insolvency.  Some jurisdictions (although not many) apply the ''balance-sheet'' test of insolvency to undervalue transactions, either as an alternative to the cash-flow test, or in addition to it.&lt;/ref&gt;

The vulnerability period is the period of time immediately prior to the company going into bankruptcy.  The length of the vulnerability period varies between countries, and some countries apply different vulnerability periods in different circumstances.  For example, in the United Kingdom, the vulnerability period is either:
#two years, if the person with whom the company entered into the transaction with is a "connected person",&lt;ref&gt;Connected person is usually defined under the relevant legislation, e.g. in the United Kingdom, see section 249 of the Insolvency Act, and which is drafted so as to try and catch all insiders and affiliates, other than employees&lt;/ref&gt; or
#6 months, in all other cases.
The period is calculated by reference to the period of time immediately preceding the company going into liquidation or administration.

The effect of a successful application to have a transaction declared as an undervalue transaction varies.  Inevitably the other party to the transaction who received the benefit has to return the benefit (or account for it) it to the liquidator.  In some countries the assets are treated in the normal way, and may be taken by any [[secured creditor]]s who have a [[security interest]] which catches the assets (characteristically, a [[floating charge]]).&lt;ref&gt;See ''Re Oasis Merchandising Services Ltd'' (1997) BCC 282, now superseded by legislation.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, some countries have "ring-fenced" recoveries of unfair preferences so that they are made available to the pool of assets for [[unsecured creditor]]s.

Many jurisdictions which have prohibitions on undervalue transactions also provide for an exception in the case of transactions entered into in the [[ordinary course of business]] where the [[Board of directors|directors]] are of a view that it is for the benefit of the company, and such transactions are usually either validated or presumed to be validated.

{{Venezuelan Crisis}}
{{Events leading to World War I}}

The '''Venezuelan crisis of 1902–03'''{{efn|Sometimes called the "second Venezuelan crisis", the [[Venezuela Crisis of 1895|crisis of 1895–97]] being the first.}} was a [[naval blockade]] from December 1902 to February 1903 imposed against [[Venezuela]] by the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], [[German Empire|Germany]] and [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]], over President [[Cipriano Castro]]'s refusal to pay foreign debts and damages suffered by European citizens in the [[Federal War|Venezuelan civil war]]. Castro assumed that the [[United States]]' [[Monroe Doctrine]] would see the US prevent European military intervention, but at the time, US president [[Theodore Roosevelt]] and the [[Department of State]] saw the Doctrine as concerning European seizure of territory, rather than intervention ''"per se"''. With prior promises that no such seizure would occur, the US allowed the action to go ahead without objection. The blockade saw Venezuela's small navy quickly disabled, but Castro refused to give in, and instead agreed in principle to submit some of the claims to international arbitration, which he had previously rejected. Germany initially objected to this, particularly as it felt some claims should be accepted by Venezuela without arbitration.

President Roosevelt forced the Germans to back down by sending his own larger fleet under Admiral [[George Dewey]] and threatening war if the Germans landed.&lt;ref&gt;Edmund Morris, "'A Matter Of Extreme Urgency' Theodore Roosevelt, Wilhelm II, and the Venezuela Crisis of 1902," ''Naval War College Review'' (2002) 55#2 pp 73–85&lt;/ref&gt;  With Castro failing to back down, US pressure and increasingly negative British and American press reaction to the affair, the blockading nations agreed to a compromise, but maintained the blockade during negotiations over the details. This led to the signing of an agreement on 13 February 1903 which saw the blockade lifted, and Venezuela commit 30% of its customs duties to settling claims. When the [[Permanent Court of Arbitration]] in [[The Hague]] subsequently awarded preferential treatment to the blockading powers against the claims of other nations, the US feared this would encourage future European intervention. The episode contributed to the development of the [[Roosevelt Corollary]] to the Monroe Doctrine, asserting a right of the United States to intervene to "stabilize" the economic affairs of small states in the Caribbean and Central America if they were unable to pay their international debts, in order to preclude European intervention to do so.

== Background ==
[[File:Cipriano Castro and cabinet in 1902.jpg|thumb|right|280px|Cipriano Castro and his war cabinet in 1902]]
At the turn of the twentieth century, German traders dominated Venezuela's import/export sector and informal banking system. Most of these, however, had little influence in Berlin - rather it was German industrialists and bankers, including those associated with building railroads, who had connections and influence.&lt;ref name=Mitchell&gt;Mitchell, Nancy (1999), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=lkEYGu5vlcoC The danger of dreams: German and American imperialism in Latin America]'', [[University of North Carolina Press]]. p65&lt;/ref&gt; The revolutionary turmoil of the last decade of the 19th century in Venezuela saw these suffer, and send "a stream of complaints and entreaties for protection" to Berlin. Matters were particularly bad during the Venezuela civil war of 1892 which had brought [[Joaquín Crespo]] to power, which saw six months of anarchy with no effective government,&lt;ref name=Forbes321&gt;Forbes (1978:320-1)&lt;/ref&gt; but the civil war of 1898 again saw forced loans and the taking of houses and property.&lt;ref&gt;Forbes (1978:324)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1893 the French, Spanish, Belgian and German envoys in Caracas had agreed that joint action was the best route for settling claims from the 1892 civil war, but in the event reparations in that case had been paid.&lt;ref&gt;Forbes (1978:323)&lt;/ref&gt;

While German investment in Venezuela was substantially less than in countries such as Argentina or Brazil, [[Krupp]]'s [[Great Venezuela Railway]] Company, valued at 60m [[German gold mark|marks]], was "individually one of the more valuable German South American ventures",&lt;ref name=Forbes/&gt; and despite a renegotiation of the concession terms in 1896, payments were irregular after 1897 and stopped in August 1901.&lt;ref name=Forbes&gt;Forbes, Ian L.D. (1978), "The German Participation in the Allied Coercion of Venezuela 1902–1903", ''Australian Journal of Politics &amp; History'', Volume 24, Issue 3, pages 317–331. p320&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, [[Cipriano Castro]], one of a succession of Venezuelan ''[[caudillo]]s'' (military strongmen) to seize the Presidency, halted payment on foreign debts after seizing Caracas in October 1899.&lt;ref name=Greene&gt;Greene, Jack and Tucker, Spencer C. (2009), "[https://books.google.com/books?id=8V3vZxOmHssC&amp;pg=PA676 Venezuela Crisis, Second]", in Tucker, Spencer (ed), ''The encyclopedia of the Spanish-American and Philippine-American wars: a political, social, and military history, Volume 1'', ABC-CLIO, pp676-7&lt;/ref&gt; Britain had similar grievances, and was owed the bulk of the nearly $15m of debt Venezuela had obtained in 1881 and then defaulted on.&lt;ref name=M71-2/&gt;

In July 1901 Germany urged Venezuela in friendly terms to pursue international arbitration&lt;ref&gt;Hill, Howard C. (2008), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=cC93z-fAcEgC&amp;pg=PA110 Roosevelt and the Caribbean]'' [[University of Chicago Press]]. p110&lt;/ref&gt; via the [[Permanent Court of Arbitration]] in [[The Hague]].&lt;ref name=Greene/&gt; Between February and June 1902 the British representative in Venezuela sent Castro seventeen notes about the British government's concerns, and did not even receive a reply to any of them.&lt;ref name=M71-2/&gt; Castro assumed that the [[United States]]' [[Monroe Doctrine]] would see the US prevent European military intervention. [[Theodore Roosevelt]] (US President September 1901 – March 1909), however saw the Doctrine as concerning European seizure of territory, rather than intervention per se.&lt;ref name=Greene/&gt; As Vice-President, in July 1901, Roosevelt said that "if any South American country misbehaves toward any European country, let the European country spank it,"&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, Edward S. (1998), ''U.S. imperialism in Latin America: Bryan's challenges and contributions, 1900–1920'', [[Greenwood Publishing Group]]. p16&lt;/ref&gt; and reiterated that view to [[United States Congress|Congress]] on 3 December 1901.&lt;ref name=Forbes325/&gt;

It remains disputed to this day how the Anglo-German cooperation on Venezuela came about, with varying opinions as to the source of the initiative.{{efn|Nancy Mitchell writes that "To assert that either party took the initiative and to dig feverishly through the archives for proof ignores the subtlety of life.
In this decision, the question of who took the initiative is buried forever in innuendo, in inference, in the tone of voice, the raised eyebrow that leaves no paper trail." (Mitchell 1999:71)}} In mid-1901, with the distraction of the [[Boxer Rebellion]] gone, Chancellor [[Bernhard von Bülow]] decided to respond to the German concerns in Venezuela with some form of military intervention, and discussed with the German navy the feasibility of a blockade. Admiral [[Otto von Diederichs]] was keen, and recommended occupying Caracas if a blockade didn't succeed. However, disagreements within the German government over whether a blockade should be pacific (permitting neutral ships to pass) or martial (enabling them to be seized) caused delays, and in any case Kaiser [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor]] was unconvinced about the military action.&lt;ref name=M67&gt;Mitchell (1999:67)&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, in late 1901 a renewed demand for reparations was backed up by a show of naval strength, with [[SMS Vineta (1895)|''Vineta'']] and [[SMS Falke|''Falke'']] sent to the Venezuelan coast.&lt;ref name=Forbes325/&gt; In January 1902 the Kaiser declared a delay to any blockade due to the outbreak of another civil war in Venezuela (led by financier [[:es:Manuel Antonio Matos|Manuel Antonio Matos]]) which raised the possibility of a more amenable government.&lt;ref name=Forbes325&gt;Forbes (1978:325)&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|There were also tactical reasons for a delay, in the view of the German navy. "In April Venezuela was hot and unhealthy and in June it was wet; and, further, after the coffee harvest in March Venezuela’s trade was at its quietest and a blockade would therefore be less damaging. The whole affair should be deferred until October". – Forbes (1978:326)}}  Complicating matters were rumours "rampant in the United States and in England" that Germany wanted [[Margarita Island]] as a South American naval base; however a May 1900 visit by the German cruiser [[SMS Vineta (1895)|SMS ''Vineta'']] had concluded it was unsuitable, and the German navy had become more conscious of how vulnerable such far-flung bases would be.&lt;ref name=M67/&gt; In late 1901, the British [[Foreign Office]] became concerned that Britain would look bad if it failed to defend its citizens' interests while Germany took care of theirs, and began sounding out the Germans about a possible common action, initially receiving a negative response.&lt;ref name=M71-2&gt;Mitchell (1999:71-2)&lt;/ref&gt; By early 1902, British and German financiers were working together to pressure their respective governments into action.&lt;ref name="Forbes 1978:327"&gt;Forbes (1978:327)&lt;/ref&gt; The Italians, who had begun to suspect the existence of plans to enforce debts, sought to be involved too, but Berlin refused. Their participation was agreed to by the British "after Rome had shrewdly pointed out that it could repay the favor in [[Somalia]]".&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, Nancy (1996), "The Height of the German Challenge: The Venezuela Blockade, 1902–3", ''Diplomatic History'', Volume 20, Issue 2, pages 185–210. p195&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1902, Castro seized a British ship, ''The Queen'', on suspicion of aiding rebels, in another phase of the Venezuelan civil war. This, together with Castro's failure to engage with the British through diplomatic channels, tilted the balance in London in favor of action, with or without German cooperation.&lt;ref name=M71-2/&gt; By July 1902, the German government was ready to return to the possibility of joint action, with Matos' insurrection having led to further abuses against German citizens and their property, including by government forces.&lt;ref name="Forbes 1978:327"/&gt; In mid-August, the United Kingdom and Germany agreed in principle to go ahead with a blockade later in the year.&lt;ref name=M73-4/&gt; In September, after the [[Haiti]]an rebel ship the ''[[Crête-à-Pierrot]]'' hijacked a German ship and seized weapons destined for the Haitian government, Germany sent the gunboat [[SMS Panther|SMS ''Panther'']] to Haiti.&lt;ref name=M77-8&gt;Mitchell (1999:77-8)&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Panther'' found the ship and declared that it would sink it, after which the rebel Admiral [[Hammerton Killick]], after evacuating the crew, blew up his ship and himself with it, assisted by fire from the ''Panther''.&lt;ref name=M77-8/&gt; There were concerns about how the United States would view the action in the context of the Monroe Doctrine, but despite US State Department legal advice describing the sinking as "illegal and excessive", the State Department endorsed the action, and the ''[[New York Times]]'' declared that "Germany was quite within her rights in doing a little housecleaning on her own account".&lt;ref name=M77-8/&gt; Similarly, the British acquisition of the island of [[Patos Island (Venezuela)|Patos]], in the mouth of the [[Orinoco]] between Venezuela and the British dependency of [[Trinidad and Tobago]], seemed to cause no concern in Washington, even though as a territorial claim it "skirted dangerously close to challenging the Monroe Doctrine".&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell (1999:78-9)&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 November, at a visit of Kaiser Wilhelm's to his uncle King [[Edward VII]] at [[Sandringham House]], an "iron-clad" agreement was signed, albeit leaving key details unresolved beyond the first step of seizing Venezuela's gunboats.&lt;ref name=M73-4&gt;Mitchell (1999:73-4)&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement specified that matters with Venezuela should be resolved to the satisfaction of both countries, precluding the possibility of Venezuela making a deal with just one.&lt;ref name=M73-4/&gt; The agreement was motivated not least by German fears that Britain might withdraw from action, and leave Germany exposed to US anger.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell (1996:201-2)&lt;/ref&gt; The British press reaction to the deal was highly negative, with the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' declaring that Britain was now "bound by a pledge to follow Germany in any wild enterprize which the German government may think it proper to undertake."&lt;ref name=M73-4/&gt; In the course of 1902 the US received various indications from Britain, Germany and Italy of an intention to take action, with the US declaring that as long as no territorial acquisition were made, it would not oppose any action.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell (1999:79–80)&lt;/ref&gt; The British minister in Venezuela emphasised the need for secrecy about the plans, saying that he thought the US minister would leak warning to Castro, which would give Castro the opportunity to hide Venezuela's gunboats up the [[Orinoco|Orinoco River]].&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell (1999:81)&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 December 1902, both the United Kingdom and Germany issued [[ultimatum]]s to Venezuela, even though there was still disagreement about whether to impose a [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific Oceanic]] blockade (as the Germans wanted) or a war blockade (as the British wanted).&lt;ref name=M84-6&gt;Mitchell (1999:84-6)&lt;/ref&gt; Germany ultimately agreed to a war blockade, and after receiving no reply to their ultimatums, an unofficial naval blockade was imposed on 9 December with SMS Panther, [[SMS Falke]], [[SMS Gazelle]] and SMS Vineta as major [[Imperial German Navy|Kaiserliche Marine]] warships in Caribbean sea.&lt;ref name=M84-6/&gt; On 11 December, Italy offered its own ultimatum&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article |url=https://www.academia.edu/19440292/Italia_y_el_bloqueo_naval_de_Venezuela_1902-1903_ |title=Italia y el bloqueo naval de Venezuela (1902-1903)|last=Fonzo |first=Erminio |journal=Cultura Latinoamericana.

Venezuela maintained that its national laws were final, and said that "the so-named foreign debt ought not to be and never had been a matter of discussion beyond the legal guaranties found in the law of Venezuela on the public debt".&lt;ref&gt;George Winfield Scott (1908), "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2186560 Hague Convention Restricting the Use of Force to Recover on Contract Claims]", ''The American Journal of International Law'', Vol. 2, No. 1 (Jan., 1908), pp. 78–94. p82&lt;/ref&gt;

The German naval contingent (numbering four, compared to the United Kingdom's eight) followed the British lead in operational terms.&lt;ref name=M84-6/&gt; On 11 December 1902, the ''Gazelle'' boarded the old gunboat [[Atalanta (1883)|''Restaurador'']] in the port of Guanta. The gunboat was towed at anchor and put into service by the German Captain-Lieutenant [[Titus Türk]] with crew members of the ''Gazelle'' as SMS ''Restaurador''.&lt;ref&gt;''Captain Lieutenant Titus Türk.''

The British ships of the "Particular Service Squadron" under Commodore [[Robert Archibald James Montgomerie]] included the [[Alert class sloop|sloop]] HMS ''Alert'' and the [[Astraea class cruiser|protected cruiser]] HMS ''Charybdis''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.battleships-cruisers.co.uk/cruisers.htm|title=Naval cruisers at battleships-cruisers.co.uk|accessdate=2008-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; An Italian naval contingent arrived in support of the blockade on 16 December.&lt;ref name=M84-6/&gt;  The blockaders captured four Venezuelan warships,&lt;ref name=Brune/&gt; with the Venezuelan navy providing little challenge. Virtually all its ships were captured within two days.&lt;ref name=M84-6/&gt; The Germans, lacking the capacity to tow them to [[Curaçao]], simply sank two Venezuelan ships that proved unseaworthy.&lt;ref name=M84-6/&gt; On land, Castro arrested over 200 British and German residents of Caracas, prompting the allies to deploy soldiers to evacuate their citizens.&lt;ref name=M84-6/&gt; The US Ambassador [[Herbert W.

[[File:SMS Vineta.png|300px|thumb|left|SMS Vineta in 1902]]
On 13 December, after a British merchant vessel had been boarded and its crew briefly arrested, the British demanded an apology, and failing to receive it, launched a bombardment of Venezuelan forts at [[Puerto Cabello]], assisted by the German [[SMS Vineta (1895)|SMS ''Vineta'']].&lt;ref name=M84-6/&gt; The same day, London and Berlin received from Washington a request forwarded from Castro to submit the dispute to arbitration, which neither Power relished, because of concerns over enforceability of any settlement.&lt;ref name=M87-8&gt;Mitchell (1999:87-8)&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Castro's offer initially covered only claims arising from the 1898 civil war, and made no mention of other claims.&lt;ref name=Maass/&gt; Germany believed that these claims should not be subject to arbitration, but London was more willing to agree, accepting arbitration in principle, and suggested a compromise.{{efn|"Germany insisted on certain reservations: The [primary] claims would not be subject to arbitration and, in the case of the remaining claims, Venezuela would have to admit liability so that the court of arbitration would decide only on the 'material justification' and the 'means of the settlement.' In response, London suggested a modified agreement to Berlin in which the primary claims would not be subject to arbitration, but would instead be immediately paid or guaranteed by Venezuela. The remaining claims would then be dealt with through arbitration". – Maass (2009)}} The threat of arbitration made London move to the next stage in order to negotiate from a position of strength,&lt;ref name=Maass/&gt; and 20 December was set for the beginning of the official blockade. As a result of a combination of communications issues and practical delays, the British notice of an official blockade was published on 20 December, but the German blockade of Puerto Cabello was only effected on 22 December, and on Maracaibo on 24 December.&lt;ref name=M87-8/&gt;
[[File:SMS Panther (1901).jpg|300px|thumb|left|SMS Panther]]

In the meantime, whilst the United Kingdom and Germany considered Castro's offer, US public opinion increasingly turned against the action, and there were references to the nearby presence of Admiral [[George Dewey]]'s US fleet, which was conducting long-planned exercises at [[Puerto Rico]], although neither the British government nor the British press considered US intervention a serious possibility.&lt;ref name=M91-3&gt;Mitchell (1999:91-3)&lt;/ref&gt; The US did, after the December ultimatums to Venezuela, send an envoy to survey Venezuela's defensive capabilities, and thereby confirmed its confidence that the [[US Navy]] could repel a German invasion.&lt;ref&gt;Seward W. Livermore (1946), "Theodore Roosevelt, the American Navy, and the Venezuelan Crisis of 1902–1903", ''The American Historical Review'', Vol. 51, No. 3 (Apr., 1946), pp. 452–471. pp459-460&lt;/ref&gt; The publication of a British government [[White Paper]], revealing the nature of the "iron-clad" agreement, infuriated the British press, not least because the yoking of British and German interests was considered dangerous, and unnecessary for the mere collection of some foreign debts.&lt;ref name=M94-5&gt;Mitchell (1999:94-5)&lt;/ref&gt; This was exemplified by [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s polemic poem "The Rowers", published in ''[[The Times]]'' on 22 December as a response to the crisis; it included the words "a secret vow ye have made with an open foe&amp;nbsp;...  a breed that have wronged us most&amp;nbsp;...  to help them press for a debt!"&lt;ref&gt;Forbes (1978:331)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Gunboats, Corruption, and Claims: Foreign Intervention in Venezuela, 1899-1908" by Brian Stuart McBeth&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;* Challener, Richard.(1973).

Britain unofficially told the United States on 17 December that it would accept arbitration in principle, and that Germany would soon agree too, as it did on 19 December.&lt;ref&gt;Parsons, Edward B. (1971), "The German-American Crisis of 1902–1903", ''Historian'', Volume 33, Issue 3, pages 436–452. p437&lt;/ref&gt; Castro's failure to back down left limited options in the face of the Monroe Doctrine, which would make any seizure of Venezuelan territory, even temporarily, problematic.&lt;ref name=Mitch96-198/&gt; In addition, the negative reaction in the British and American press had raised the costs of the intervention particularly for Germany, whose relations with the US were more fragile than the United Kingdom's and who placed great value on the attitude of the British press.&lt;ref name=Mitch96-198/&gt; Germany had followed the United Kingdom's lead throughout the planning and execution of the operation, and as the British Ambassador in Berlin observed, "The idea of arbitration did not smile on them, but they accepted it at once because we had proposed it".&lt;ref name=Mitch96-198&gt;Mitchell (1996:198-9)&lt;/ref&gt; Fourteen years later (during a presidential campaign against the backdrop of [[World War I]]), then US President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] claimed that Germany's acquiescence to arbitration came from his threat to attack the German ships in Venezuelan waters using Dewey's fleet. No documentary evidence has been found to confirm the claim.&lt;ref name=M87-8/&gt; However, following the 18 December announcement that the US Navy fleet would be dispersed to West Indian ports for [[Christmas]], which would take some of it to [[Trinidad]], near the Venezuelan coast, the German embassy in Washington sought clarification from the US government.
[[File:Fuerte San Carlos 1902.jpg|260px|thumb|wright|''A cover of the "[[Le Petit Parisien]]" depicting the bombardment of Castle San Carlos'']]

The Secretary of State's remarks "were as close to a direct threat as it was possible to come in diplomatic parlance."&lt;ref&gt;Livermore (1946:464)&lt;/ref&gt; Roosevelt also claimed that Germany had intended to seize a Venezuelan harbour and establish a permanent German military base; and certainly the German representative in Venezuela is known to have had such ambitions.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell (1999:98)&lt;/ref&gt; However, historical records suggest the German Kaiser had no interest in such a venture, and that motivations for the intervention lay with the insult to German prestige from Castro's actions. The Kaiser only gave the go ahead after being sure that Britain would play the lead role.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell (1999:99)&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1903, as the blockade continued during the negotiations, the German [[SMS Panther|SMS ''Panther'']] attempted to enter the lagoon of [[Maracaibo]],&lt;ref name=M101/&gt; a centre of German commercial activity.&lt;ref name=Brune&gt;Lester H. Brune and Richard Dean Burns (2003), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Xux-LSxSY6cC&amp;pg=PA308 Chronological History of U.S. Foreign Relations: 1607–1932]'', [[Routledge]]. p308&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 January it exchanged fire with the settlement of [[Bombardment of Fort San Carlos|Fort San Carlos]], but withdrew after half an hour, as shallow waters prevented it getting close enough to the fort to be effective. The Venezuelans claimed this as a victory, and in response the German commander sent the ''Vineta'', with heavier weapons, to set an example.&lt;ref name=Forbes328&gt;Forbes (1978:328)&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 January the ''Vineta'' [[Bombardment of Fort San Carlos|bombarded the fort]],&lt;ref name=Reiling/&gt; setting fire to it and destroying it,&lt;ref name=NYT23011903&gt;''[[The New York Times]]'', 23 January 1903, [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F7081FF93B5412738DDDAD0A94D9405B838CF1D3 GERMAN COMMANDER BLAMES VENEZUELANS; Commodore Scheder Says That Fort San Carlos Fired First.]&lt;/ref&gt; with the death of 25 civilians in the nearby town.&lt;ref&gt;Parsons (1971:447)&lt;/ref&gt;  The action had not been approved by the British commander,&lt;ref name=Reiling/&gt; who had been told by [[Admiralty]] after the incident of 13 December not to engage in such action without consulting London; the message was not passed to the German commander, who had been told previously to follow the British commander's lead.&lt;ref name=Forbes328/&gt; The incident caused "considerable negative reaction in the United States against Germany";&lt;ref name=Greene/&gt; the Germans said that the Venezuelans fired first, which the British concurred with but declared the bombardment "unfortunate and inopportune" nonetheless.&lt;ref name=M101/&gt; The German Foreign Office said that the ''Panther's'' attempted incursion into the lagoon of Maracaibo had been motivated by a desire to ensure the effective blockade of Maracaibo, by preventing Maracaibo from being supplied across the adjacent [[Colombia]]n border.&lt;ref name=NYT23011903/&gt; Subsequently, Roosevelt informed the German Ambassador that Admiral Dewey had orders to be ready to sail to Venezuela from Puerto Rico at an hour's notice.&lt;ref&gt;Bethell, Leslie (1984), ''The Cambridge history of Latin America'', [[Cambridge University Press]]. p100&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Wills Act 1837''' (1 Vict. [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Will4and1Vict/7/26/contents c 26]) is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] that confirms the power of every adult to dispose of their [[real property|real]] and [[personal property]], whether they are the outright owner or a beneficiary under a [[Trust law|trust]], by [[will (law)|will]] on their death (s.3). The act extends to all testamentary dispositions or [[Gift (law)|gifts]], where "a person makes a disposition of his property to take effect after his decease, and which is in its own nature ambulatory and revocable during his life."&lt;ref&gt;Jarman (1951) vol.I, ''p.''26&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2012}}, much of it remains in force in [[England and Wales]].

==Background==
Under [[ecclesiastical law]], [[common law]] and [[Equity (law)|equity]], various customary rules had long existed for disposing of personal property by will. However, the power to gift real property by will had been first granted by the [[Statute of Wills]] (1540). Various rules grew up around the formalities necessary to create a valid will and the [[Statute of Frauds]] (1677) created the requirement that a will of real property must be in writing.&lt;ref&gt;Mirow (1994)&lt;/ref&gt; By the early nineteenth century, the rules had become complex, with different rules for formalising wills of real and personal property. The 4th report of the [[Law Commission|Commissioners for Inquiring into the Law of Real Property]] recommended a simplified and unified scheme. As the Commissioners observed "Any scrap of paper, or ''memorandum'' in ink or in pencil, mentioning an intended disposition of his property, is admitted as a will and will be valid, although written by another person, and not read over to the testator, or even seen by him, if proved to be made in his lifetime according to his instructions." A [[bill (proposed law)|bill]] was introduced by the [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney General]] Sir [[John Campbell, 1st Baron Campbell|John Campbell]], one of the Commissioners, in 1834 though it was much delayed for want of parliamentary time.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Times]]'', 21 February 1835, ''p.''3, col D&lt;/ref&gt; The bill was introduced in the [[House of Lords]] by [[Henry Bickersteth, 1st Baron Langdale|Lord Langdale]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 12 March 1836 ''p.''4, col F&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the requirement that a will be in writing stems from an attempt to frustrate fraud, an apparent exception to the requirements for the formal execution of the Act under section 9 is a [[Secret trusts in English law|secret trust]].&lt;ref&gt;Critchley (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilde (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provisions of the Act currently in force==

===Capacity===
A minor, as of 2008 a person under the age of 18, cannot make a valid will (s.7), unless they are a member of the armed forces on [[active service]] or a [[mariner]] at sea (s.11). These provisions were clarified by the '''Wills (Soldiers and Sailors) Act 1918''' (see below).

===Requirements of a valid will===
A will is only valid if (s.9):
*It is made in writing;
*It is [[signature|signed]] by the [[testator]], or at his direction and in his presence;
*The testator [[intent (law)|intends]] that the signature give effect to the will;
*The will is made or acknowledged in the presence of two or more witnesses, present at the same time; and
*Each witness attests and signs, or acknowledges, his signature in the presence of the testator.

There is no requirement to publish a will (s.13). If any of the witnesses was, or subsequently becomes, incapable of proving the will, that alone will not make it invalid (s.14). Alterations must be executed in the same manner as a will (s.21).

===Revocation of a will===
Section 18 revokes the will in the event of the marriage of the testator. However, this section was amended in 1982 so that where the testator makes the will in the expectation of marriage to a particular person, the will is not revoked by such a marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Administration of Justice Act 1982, s.18(1)&lt;/ref&gt; Section 18A was added in 1982 to the effect that divorce and [[annulment]] have the same effect as the death of a spouse.&lt;ref&gt;Administration of Justice Act 1982, s.18(2)&lt;/ref&gt;

A will or [[codicil (will)|codicil]] cannot be revoked by any presumption of the intention of the testator or on the grounds of any alteration in his circumstances (s.19). A will can only be revoked by (s.20):
*Another properly executed will or codicil;
*A document executed under the same formalities as a will, declaring an intention to revoke the will; or
*Destruction of the will by the testator, or some person in his presence, with the intention of revoking the will.

A revoked will or codicil cannot be revived other than by its re-execution or by a formally executed codicil (s.22).

===Gifts to witnesses===
Gifts under the will to an attesting witness, or their spouse, are null and [[void (law)|void]]. However, such a witness can still prove the will (s.15). There is no bar on a [[creditor]] of the testator or the [[executor]] of the will being a witness (ss.16–17).

===Gifts to children===
Where the testator makes a gift to one of his children or a remoter descendant, and that child dies before the testator, the gift will not lapse so long as the deceased descendant himself leaves children surviving at the death of the testator. The surviving descendants receive the gift (s.33). The rule also applies to [[illegitimate]] children (s.33(4)(a)) and a person conceived before the death of the testator is deemed to have been living at the testator's death (s.33(4)(b)).

==Interpretation==
The will is interpreted in respect of the testator's property immediately before his death (s.24). Where the testator makes a gift of all his real property, it is deemed to include property over which he has a [[power of appointment]] (s.27).

==Ireland and Northern Ireland==
The Act was in force in Ireland until [[Partition of Ireland|partition]]. It consequently became the law of the [[Irish Free State]] on 6 December 1922, and then of its successor states. When Ireland was partitioned and the statelet of [[Northern Ireland]] created on 7 December 1922, the Act became the law of Northern Ireland. However, all save sections 1 and 11 were repealed and re-enacted, with amendments, in Northern Ireland in 1995&lt;ref&gt;Wills and Administration Proceedings (Northern Ireland) Order 1994, [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/SI/si1994/Uksi_19941899_en_1.htm SI 1994/1899]&lt;/ref&gt; following the recommendations of the Land Law Working Group.&lt;ref&gt;Final Report of the Land Law Working Group (HMSO 1990) Part 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Explanatory note to SI 1994/1899 | publisher=Office for Public Sector Information | year=1995 | accessdate=16 March 2008 | url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/SI/si1994/Uksi_19941899_en_9.htm#exnote }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provisions repealed by the Act==
*[[Statute of Wills]]

==Provisions of the Act, since repealed==
Sections 4 to 6 addressed various technicalities of [[land law]] since rendered obsolete. The Act did not extend to estates ''[[pur autre vie]]'' and various [[manorial rights]] were preserved over the land devised. Where land was held subject to a [[Lord of the Manor]], for example under a [[copyhold]], the Act required that the will was recorded in the [[Manorial roll|Court Roll]] of the [[manorialism|manor]] and that various fees and duties were paid. These provisions became irrelevant following the demise of the manorial system with the [[Law of Property Act 1925]].

Section 8 maintained the earlier incapacity of a ''[[feme covert]]'' to make a will.

}}The '''Wills (Soldiers and Sailors) Act 1918''' clarifies and extends the Wills Act 1837. Section 1&lt;ref&gt;{{UK-LEG|path=ukpga/Geo5/7-8/58/section/1|title=Wills (Soldiers and Sailors) Act 1918}}&lt;/ref&gt; makes if clear that a soldier on active service or sailor at sea, can make, and always could have made, a valid will, even though under 18 years of age. Section 2 extends the provision to sailors not at sea but who are employed in similar service to a soldier on active service. "Soldier" include a member of the [[Royal Air Force|Air Force]] (s.5). This Act is in force in [[Scotland]], but this may be to no effect as it acts only by reference to the Wills Act 1837, which is not in effect there but is in effect, in modified form, in [[Northern Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;Annotations at Statute Law Database, retrieved 16 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

This is managed by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA), and is separate from the [[Hazard Communication Standard]] managed by [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA).

==Requirement==

The EPA registers pesticides and insecticides as either ''unclassified'' or ''[[restricted use pesticide]]'' (RUP). Unclassified pesticide is available over-the-counter. This program exists in cooperation with the [[United States Department of Agriculture]].

Two items are required by law for all registered pesticides and insecticides.
* Product Label
* [[Material Safety Data Sheet]]

The product label describes how to use the product. 

The [[Material Safety Data Sheet]] provides specific safety and hazard information, and this must be provided to physicians in the event that the product has been misused so that appropriate diagnostic testing and treatment can be obtained in a timely manner.

RUP requires license for purchase. The process required to obtain a pest control licenses is regulated by a combination of state laws, federal laws, common law, and private company policies.

All RUP applications must be recorded to identify the date, location, and type of pesticide applied. Federal law requires a minimum record retention period, which may be three years or longer depending upon state laws.

There are two categories of license: supervisor and applicator. A pest control supervisor license is required to purchase RUP and keep records. The pest control supervisor must ensure pest control applicators are competent to use any restricted use products.

Further information can be obtained from the following organizations.

==DoD worker protection==

The [[United States Department of Defense]] manages safety independently of OSHA and EPA. Spills, mishaps, illnesses, and injuries are not normally handled in accordance with local, state and federal law.

Failure to administer discipline for illegal activity occurring within a military command is considered to be '''[[dereliction of duty]]''', which is administered under the '''[[Uniform Code of Military Justice]]'''.

Individuals with information about environmental crimes and individuals with environmental injuries involving the military should become familiar with the topic of [[Whistleblower protection in United States]]. Government employees, government contractors, and military officers often lack the training, education, licensing, and experience required to understand the legal requirements involving environmental safety. The sophistication required to understand legal requirements is not normally required for promotion and contractor selection within the military.

Because of this, specific rules are documented in orders and directives that need to be written in plain language intended to be understood by people that have a 4th grade reading ability.

Law are enforced is performed by the [[commanding officer]] in military organizations. The commanding officer typically has the ability to read and understand written requirements. A [[Flag Officer]] is subject to [[Court-martial]] action if laws or government policies are violated under their command when the activity is outside the scope of '''mission orders''' and '''[[rules of engagement]]'''. Each commanding officer is responsible for writing and maintaining policies simple enough to be understood by everyone in their command. Each commanding officer is responsible for ensuring that command policy documents are made available to every person in their command (civilian, military, and contractor). The commanding officer is responsible for disciplinary action and public disclosures when policies are violated within their command. 

Military agencies operate independently of law enforcement, judicial authority, and [[common law]]. Similar exemptions exist for some state agencies.

Potential crimes are investigated by [[Military_police#United_States|military police]]. The following is an example of the kinds of policy documents used to conduct criminal investigations.
* [http://www.ig.navy.mil/Documents/Investigations%20Manual%20(word)/Investigations%20Manual.pdf Naval Inspector General; Investigations Manual]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ig.navy.mil/Documents/Investigations%20Manual%20(word)/Investigations%20Manual.pdf|title=Naval Inspector General; Investigations Manual|publisher=Office of the Inspector General, U.S. Department of the Navy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because military law enforcement is performed with no independent civilian oversight, there is an inherent [[conflict of interest]]. Information and disclosures are obtained through Freedom of Information Act request and not through disclosures ordinarily associated with the EPA and OSHA that have the competency required for training, certification, disclosure, and enforcement. This prevents physicians from obtaining the kind of information needed to diagnose and treat environmental illness, so the root cause for environmental illness typically remains permanently unknown. The following organization may help when the root cause for an illness remains unknown longer than 30 days.
* [http://www.dod.gov/pubs/foi/ Office of the Secretary of Defense and Joint Staff; Freedom of Information Act Requester Service Center]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dod.gov/pubs/foi/|title=Office of the Secretary of Defense and Joint Staff; Freedom of Information Act Requester Service Center|publisher=Department of Defense}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Criminal violations, injuries, and potential enforcement actions begin by exchanging information in the following venues when civilian government employees and flag officers are unable to deal with the situation in an ethical manner.
* [[Labor unions in the United States|Local labor union officials]]
* [[Freedom of information in the United States]]
* [[Office of the Inspector General, U.S. Department of Defense]] ([http://www.dodig.mil/HOTLINE/ Hotline]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dodig.mil/HOTLINE/|title=DoD IG Hotline|publisher=Office of the Inspector General, U.S. Department of Defense}}&lt;/ref&gt;)
* [[United States Secretary of Defense]]
* [[President of the United States]]
* [[United States Secretary of State]]
* [[United States House of Representatives]]
* [[United States Senate]]

US federal laws, state laws, local laws, foreign laws, and treaty agreements may not apply. 

Policies are established by [[Executive order (United States)|Executive Order]] and not public law, except for interventions by the [[United States Congress]] and interventions by US district courts.
