'''''Advanced Banter: The QI Book of Quotations''''', known as '''''If Ignorance Is Bliss, Why Aren't There More Happy People?''''' in the United States, is the third title in a series of books based on the intellectual British [[panel game]] ''[[QI]]'', written by series-creator [[John Lloyd (producer)|John Lloyd]] and head-researcher [[John Mitchinson (researcher)|John Mitchinson]]. It is a book of "quite interesting" quotations.

==Publication history==
''Advanced Banter'' was first published by [[Faber and Faber|Faber]] in hardback on 1 October 2008. A paperback version of ''Advanced Banter'' was published on 5 November 2009.&lt;ref name="BCG"&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolf|first=Ian|url=http://www.comedy.org.uk/guide/tv/qi/buy/|title='QI' Merchandise|publisher=British Comedy Guide|accessdate=13 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was released in the United States under the title ''If Ignorance Is Bliss, Why Aren't There More Happy People?'' on 4 August 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wilson|first=Craig|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/columnist/finalword/2009-07-14-fame_n.htm|title=The Final Word: For some, even 15 minutes would be too long|publisher=''[[USA Today]]''|date=15 July 2009|accessdate=16 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
Of the previous ''QI'' books, the structure is akin to the second book, ''[[The Book of Animal Ignorance]]'', which is an encyclopaedic listing of 100 animals, compared to the first book, ''[[The Book of General Ignorance]]'', which was written in a question and answer format. ''Advanced Banter'' contains a series of quotes which are divided into over 400 separate topics, such as "Acting", "Action" and "Adventure", which are listed alphabetically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lloyd|first=John|author2=Mitchinson, John|title=Advanced Banter|publisher=Faber and Faber|location=London|year=2008|page=v|isbn=0-571-23372-4 |url=http://www.qi.com/shop/advanced_banter.php|accessdate=13 March 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090315153407/http://www.qi.com/shop/advanced_banter.php| archivedate= 15 March 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, there are no topics under the letter "X".&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd and Mitchinson, p. viii&lt;/ref&gt; As with the two previous books, there are also contributions by two television stars of ''QI'': host [[Stephen Fry]] and panellist [[Alan Davies]]. Fry writes an introduction entitled "Prologue", while Davies writes a section called "Proverb", which contains a [[proverb]] which he himself has written: "A small pie is soon eaten."&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd and Mitchinson, p. xi&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Boyd Tonkin in ''[[The Independent]]'' wrote of Lloyd and Mitchinson: "They prove in spades that the distinction between reference and entertainment has collapsed, with no exact sources given and a preface that styles the book as a 'manifesto' for pithy wit rather than a monument of scholarship. For all that, Lloyd and Mitchinson – the Two Horsemen of the Apocryphal, maybe – manage on every page an Oxford- and Chambers-beating ratio of gems to duds when it comes to imperishable one-liners. Quotation of the year for 2008? Thomas Jefferson on high finance: 'I believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies.' Give that man an overdraft."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Tonkin|first=Boyd|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/features/boyd-tonkin-fact-and-fun-with-the-stars-of-geek-heaven-1037792.html|title=Boyd Tonkin: Fact and fun with the stars of geek heaven|publisher=''[[The Independent]]''|date=28 November 2008|accessdate=13 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''{{Lang|de|Archäologisches Museum Hamburg}}''' (Hamburg Archaeological Museum; formerly the ''{{Lang|de|Helms-Museum}}'') is an [[archaeology|archaeological]] [[museum]] in the [[Harburg, Hamburg|Harburg]] borough of Hamburg, Germany. It houses the archaeological finds of the city of Hamburg and the neighbouring counties to the south of the city. It focuses on northern German prehistory and early history as well as the history of the former city of Harburg. The museum is also home to the [[Historic preservation|cultural heritage landmarks]] commission of the city of Hamburg and the adjacent district of [[Harburg (district)|Harburg]] in [[Lower-Saxony]] and thus supervises all archaeological undertakings in the region.

The museum has two major exhibition spaces. The future City Museum of Harburg, temporary exhibitions, the library, offices and small storage facilities are located in the main building, which is shared with the [[Harburger Theater]] at {{lang|de|Museumsplatz 2}}. The permanent archaeological exhibition and education facilities are located nearby, at {{lang|de|Harburger Rathausplatz 5}}. In addition, the Museum maintains as external branches the exhibition area of the 12th-century {{lang|de|[[Bischofsturm]]}} (Bishop's Tower) in Hamburg's old town, the {{lang|de|Fischbeker Heide}} archaeological trail at {{lang|de|[[Neugraben-Fischbek]]}} and the 8th-century [[hillfort]] of [[Hollenstedt]].

== Exhibition ==

[[File:Harburg.Helms-Museum.Arch.wmt.jpg|thumb|left|Archaeological exhibitions building]]

With more than 2.5 million objects, the museum holds the largest collection of [[Prehistory|prehistoric]] finds. On exhibit are mostly local examples of the [[Paleolithic]] and [[Neolithic]] eras, the [[Bronze Age|Bronze]] and [[Iron age|Iron Ages]], the [[Migration Period]] and the [[Early Middle Ages]] in northern Germany. In 2009, the newly designed permanent archaeological exhibition opened. It is structured in the following subject areas: materials, food, violence, death, innovation and mobility. In more than 160 glass display cases, models and large exhibit items represent all aspects of human cultural development over the last 40,000 years. In addition, installations on cultural heritage landmarks, the archaeology of Hamburg, and methods of collection and preservation provide information about the work of the museum and archaeologists. Some of the notable exhibits are the [[Duvensee paddle]] (one of the oldest surviving paddles), the [[Metzendorf-Woxdorf head burial]], the Bronze Age [[Daensen folding chair]], the [[Ovelgönne Bread Roll]], the Saxon [[Wulfsen horse burial]], the [[Tangendorf disc brooch]], a section of the [[Wittmoor Bog Trackway]] and the [[Maschen disc brooch]].

A second permanent exhibition on the local history of the Harburg borough is due to be opened in the near future.

== History ==
The museum's foundation was initiated in 1898 by the Hamburg Senator [[August Helms]], who was joined by other public figures in a museum association. Their aim was to create a museum for the then independent [[Prussia]]n city of Harburg (Elbe) and their county. In 1925, the founder's sons deeded  the museum a prestigious villa in {{lang|de|Buxtehuder Straße}} to use as an exhibition hall, and the museum was renamed ''Helms-Museum''. By that time, the collection already had  more than 50,000 catalogued objects. In 1937, the Helms-Museum became a public institution. In 1955, the Museum left the villa, which had been damaged by a bomb in World War II, and moved to a new main building next to the Harburger Theater. In 1953, Director [[Willi Wegewitz]] initiated the open-air {{lang|de|Museum am Kikeberg}}. In 1972, the Helms-Museum became Hamburg's only archaeological museum, and all archaeological holdings at other Hamburg museums were transferred to it. Since 1987, the museum has been entrusted with the preservation of cultural heritage landmarks. For space reasons, the archaeological permanent exhibition was moved to its present location at {{lang|de|Harburger Rathausplatz}}. A third exhibition area was maintained from 1990 to 1999 at the old Harburg Fire Station. On 1 January 2008, the ownership of the Helms-Museum transferred to the {{lang|de|Stiftung Historische Museen Hamburg}} (Foundation of Hamburg Historical Museums), and it was renamed ''{{lang|de|Archäologisches Museum Hamburg - Helms-Museum}}''. On 14 May 2009 the newly designed permanent archaeological exhibition was opened.

== Visitors ==
The museum participates in the ''[[Long Night of Museums]] of Hamburg'',&lt;ref name=musedi&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.langenachtdermuseen-hamburg.de/die+museen/helms-museum.htm |title=Lange Nacht der Museen Helms-Museum |publisher=Der Museumsdienst Hamburg |language=German |accessdate=2009-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and offers a variety of [[museum education|educational]] programs for children and school classes.  Since {{date|2012-11-15}} the Museum has provided an interactive electronic museum guide as an [[iTunes]] [[mobile app]], also available for [[Android (operating system)|Android]] operating systems.&lt;ref&gt;https://plus.google.com/112946114730381657998/posts?hl=en&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Atlantic halibut''' (''Hippoglossus hippoglossus'') is a [[flatfish]] of the family [[Pleuronectidae]].  They are [[demersal fish]] living on or near sand, gravel or clay bottoms at depths of between {{convert|50|and|2000|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The [[halibut]] is among the largest [[Teleostei|teleost]] (bony) fish in the world, and is an [[endangered species]] due to a slow rate of growth and previous [[overfishing]].&lt;ref name=IUCN /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Top 10 Most Endangered Fish Species|url=http://animals.howstuffworks.com/endangered-species/top-10-most-endangered-fish.htm#page=1|website=How Stuff Works|accessdate=11 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Halibut are strong swimmers and are able to [[Fish migration|migrate]] long distances. Halibut size is not age-specific, but rather tends to follow a cycle related to halibut (and therefore food) abundance.

The native habitat of the Atlantic halibut is the temperate and arctic waters of the northern [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]], from [[Labrador]] and [[Greenland]] to [[Iceland]], the [[Barents Sea]] and as far south as the [[Bay of Biscay]] and [[Virginia]].&lt;ref name='Fishbase'/&gt; It is the largest flatfish in the world,&lt;ref name=EoF&gt;{{cite book |editor=Paxton, J.R. |editor2=Eschmeyer, W.N.|author1=Chapleau, Francois  |author2=Amaoka, Kunio |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1998|title=Encyclopedia of Fishes|publisher= Academic Press|location=San Diego|pages= xxx|isbn= 0-12-547665-5 |nopp=true}}&lt;/ref&gt; reaching lengths of up to {{convert|4.7|m|ft|abbr=on}}  and weights of {{convert|320|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.

==Description==
The Atlantic halibut is a right-eyed flounder. It is flattened sideways and habitually lies on the left side of its body with both eyes migrating to the right side of its head during development. Its upper surface is a uniformly dark chocolate, olive or slate colour, and can be almost black; the underside is pale. The end of the [[caudal fin]] is concave.&lt;ref name='FishGulfMaine' /&gt; Young fish are paler with more mottled colouration.&lt;ref name=FGMI&gt;[http://www.gma.org/fogm/Hippoglossus_hippoglossus.htm Atlantic halibut] Gulf of Maine Research Institute: ''Fishery Bulletin'' (February, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biology==
The Atlantic halibut has a relatively slow growth rate and late onset of sexual maturity, with males attaining maturity at seven to eight years old, females at 10 to 11 years, and individuals are thought to live up to 50 years. Little is known about their breeding except their [[Spawn (biology)|spawning]] is seasonal, although its timing varies somewhat with location. In the eastern Atlantic, spawning occurs chiefly in March, April and May, although may span from January to June. Off the American coast, however, the spawning season appears to continue through the summer as late as September. After spawning, both sexes migrate northwards in search of food. Young Atlantic halibut individuals feed on [[crustacean]]s such as [[crab]]s and [[prawn]]s. These halibut lie motionless and invisible on the sea bed, capturing any fish that pass within reach, although they may also hunt for fish in open water.&lt;ref name='Fishbase'/&gt;&lt;ref name=FGMI/&gt;

==Habitat==
This marine fish usually lives on the ocean floor at depths between {{convert|50|and|2000|m|ft|abbr=on}}, but it occasionally comes closer to the surface. The larvae are [[Pelagic zone|pelagic]], drifting relatively helplessly, but at around 4&amp;nbsp;cm, they migrate to the bottom. Young between the ages of two and four years live close to the shore, moving into deeper waters as they grow older.&lt;ref name='Fishbase'/&gt;&lt;ref name=FGMI/&gt;

== Geographic distribution ==
Found in both the eastern and western portions of the North Atlantic. In the western Atlantic, found from southwestern Greenland and Labrador, Canada to Virginia in the USA. They are found in the eastern Atlantic around Iceland, the United Kingdom, and northern Europe to Russia. A map of the Atlantic Halibut's geographic distribution can be found on the Official Website of Massachusetts Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mass.gov/eea/agencies/dfg/dmf/recreational-fishing/atlantic-halibut.html|title=Atlantic Halibut -|last=Massachusetts Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs|first=|date=2014-06-24|website=Energy and Environmental Affairs|publisher=|access-date=2016-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role in ecosystem==
The Atlantic halibut occupies a relatively high [[trophic level]] in the [[food chain]].

===Diet===
The diet of the Atlantic halibut consists mainly of other fish, e.g. [[cod]], [[haddock]], [[herring]], [[Agonus cataphractus|pogge]], [[sand eel]]s and [[capelin]], but it will also eat [[cephalopod]]s, large [[crustacean]]s and other [[benthos]] organisms.&lt;ref name='Fishbase' /&gt;&lt;ref name='FishGulfMaine' /&gt;

===Predators===
Atlantic halibut are eaten by [[Pinniped|seal]]s, and are a [[staple food]] of the [[Greenland shark]].&lt;ref name='FishGulfMaine' /&gt;

==Commercial fishing of wild Atlantic halibut==
The wild Atlantic halibut was formerly a very important food fish, but due to its slow rate of population growth, it is unable to recover quickly from overfishing, and the fishery has largely collapsed. Consequently, wild fish labelled as "halibut" are usually one of the other large flatfishes, including [[Pacific halibut]], ''Hippoglossus stenolepis''.

===Farming===
Due to its popularity as a food fish, Atlantic halibut has attracted investment in [[fish farming]]. As of 2006, five countries - Canada, Norway, the UK, Iceland and Chile - were engaged in some form of Atlantic halibut [[aquaculture]] production.&lt;ref name='FishOceansCanada'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/aquaculture/finfish-poissons/halibut-fletan-eng.htm |title=Atlantic Halibut |accessdate=2009-06-22 |date=2006-05-31 |publisher=Fisheries and Oceans Canada |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101227004425/http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/aquaculture/finfish-poissons/halibut-fletan-eng.htm |archivedate=2010-12-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservation status==
In 1996, the [[International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources|IUCN]] rated it as [[Endangered species|Endangered]] and placed it on its [[IUCN Red List|Red List]].&lt;ref name=IUCN&gt;{{cite journal| author = Sobel, J. | year = 1996 | title = ''Hippoglossus hippoglossus'' | journal = [[The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species]] | volume = 1996 | page = e.T10097A3162182 | doi = 10.2305/IUCN.UK.1996.RLTS.T10097A3162182.en}} Downloaded on 26 March 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Atlantic halibut is a US [[National Marine Fisheries Service]] [[Species of Concern]], one of those species about which the U.S. Government's [[NOAA|National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] has some concerns regarding status and threats, but for which insufficient information is available to indicate a need to list the species under the U.S. [[Endangered Species Act]] (ESA).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/species/concern/ Species of Concern] [[NOAA]]&lt;/ref&gt; The American Fisheries Society has classified the species as "Vulnerable". In 2010, Greenpeace International added the Atlantic halibut to its seafood red list of "fish that are commonly sold in supermarkets around the world, and which have a very high risk of being sourced from unsustainable fisheries."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenpeace.org/international/seafood/red-list-of-species Greenpeace International Seafood Red list] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100410000000/http://www.greenpeace.org/international/seafood/red-list-of-species |date=April 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11694">The '''Beacon Street Girls''' (BSG) is a [[young adult fiction|young adult]] book series by Annie Bryant. The series was initially published by B*tween Productions and was licensed by [[Simon &amp; Schuster]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/childrens/childrens-book-news/article/14689-s-amp-s-kids-unit-adds-beacon-street-series--.html S&amp;S Kids' Unit Adds Beacon Street Series], ''Publishers Weekly''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Author==
"Annie Bryant" is a pseudonym for a group of writers who wrote the Beacon Street Girls books. The series was edited by Roberta MacPhee. {{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

==Background==
The Beacon Street Girls brand started in 2003. It comprised a book series, branded gifts and a website, all aimed at creating healthier role models and more positive messages for pre-teen girls. The series is designed for girls ages 9–14 and was produced following consultations with experts in different areas of teen research. The books offer an alternative to the perceived preponderance of provocative and objectionable messages aimed at youth culture, particularly [[Preadolescence|"tweens"]].&lt;ref&gt;''Boston Globe'': [http://www.boston.com/business/ticker/2007/03/beacon_street_g_1.html `Beacon Street Girls' goes beyond kid stuff.]  URL accessed 14 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Books were initially bundled with bags, backpacks and accessories, and sold as a package. The series was self-published by B*tween Productions as part of a bigger initiative to create a multi-media brand that was healthy and positive. The books were subsequently licensed to Simon &amp; Schuster in 2007. Initial runs of the series were limited to 5,000 to 10,000 printings but sold out quickly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/print/20040906/40023-new-tweens-line-modeled-after-american-girl-.html New Tweens Line Modeled After American Girl], ''Publishers Weekly''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boston.com/business/technology/articles/2007/12/10/beacon_street_girls_are_going_global_with_publishers_help/ Beacon Street Girls are going global, with publisher's help], Boston.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Community and critical reception to the series has been very positive, with educators praising the series for its focus on tackling issues such as cyber-bullying, under-age drinking, childhood obesity, and responsible [[weight loss]]. A longitudinal study conducted by Duke Medical Center on the influence of reading on weight loss showed that "girls who read the book entitled "''Charlotte in Paris''" ... saw a dip in their BMI scores, but not as much as those who read the Beacon Street Girls book "''Lake Rescue''.""&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/childrens/childrens-book-news/article/5538-lose-weight-by-reading-.html Lose Weight by Reading], ''Publishers Weekly''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/news/health/weightloss/2008-10-04-lake-rescue_N.htm Youth lit used as weight-loss tool], ''USA Today''&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[School Library Journal]]'' praised the series, writing that ''Katani's Jamaican Holiday'' was "a lively introduction to Jamaica's rich history, culture, and lifestyle."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schoollibraryjournal.com/article/CA6590833.html Grades 5 &amp; Up], ''School Library Journal''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characters==
*'''Avery Madden''': Avery is an energetic and outspoken girl who is passionate about sports, animal rights, and the environment. She's from Korea; her parents (who are now divorced) adopted her when she was a baby and brought her to America. She loves Marty but, sadly, she is not allowed to have any furry pets of her own because her mother is allergic to fur, but she does have Frogster (a frog) and Walter (a snake). She doesn't like being labeled. Avery is tiny and slightly hyper, which is a part of her natural love for sports, especially soccer. Avery drives all of her friends crazy, but they love her anyway. She laughs at anything and everything, sometimes speaking without thinking. Avery has two older brothers: Tim and Scott. She is likable and loves the Red Sox, particularly Robbie Flores.
*'''Charlotte Ramsey''': Charlotte loves school and wants to be a writer one day. She has traveled to many places, including Australia, Tanzania, and Paris. She stargazes and writes in her journal constantly. She hates being onstage or in the spotlight unless she is doing magic. She is very close to her elderly landlady, Miss Pierce, and often visits her for help with schoolwork and talk about life. Charlotte lives with only her father, a travel writer, since her mother died of pneumonia when she was only 4 years old. Charlotte has a crush on Nick Montoya, who also enjoys travel and is one of her good friends. Charlotte wrote the Tower Rules and is secretary of the BSG. 
*'''Isabel Martinez''': Isabel is a Hispanic-American girl who moved to Boston so her mother could pursue treatment for [[multiple sclerosis]]. Her father was left behind when she moved from Michigan. Isabel is a fan of art and basketball. She used to dance but injured her knee when dancing ballet and is unable to continue. She is new to Abigail Adams Jr. High and soon became close friends with Maeve and Charlotte. She then joined the BSG, despite Katani and Avery's cold reactions to her at first. Isabel later becomes good 'friends' with Kevin Connors in the 10th book, ''Just Kidding''. She loves to draw birds and often submits cartoons to the school newspaper, the ''Sentinel''. She is known as a sweet girl and loves birds, especially her pet parrot Franco. She's a very talented artist. 
*'''Katani Summers''': Also known as K-girl, Katani loves fashion and is loyal to her friends. Her grandmother is the principal of Abigail Adams Jr. High. Katani has an older sister, Kelley, who is mildly autistic and doesn't act like she's 14, though she is. Katani is a very responsible girl. She sometimes seems cold at first glance but is very kind and caring. Charlotte describes her as "a marshmallow disguised as a cactus." Katani gives style advice to all of the BSG, even Avery, who resists it. She doesn't like singing, as she isn't very good at it. She has a tentative relationship with Reggie DeWitt, whom she went to the Valentine's Day Dance with. She is the most organized of the BSG and adores sewing and horseback riding. 
*'''Maeve Kaplan-Taylor''': Maeve is an outgoing and bubbly young teenager who wants to be a movie star. Her parents are separated, and she has a younger brother named Sam. Maeve is Irish and Jewish. She is constantly frustrated with schoolwork because she's dyslexic. She tries her best in school despite this, and uses a laptop in class as well as meeting with a math tutor once a week. She is notably "boy crazy." Her many crushes include Nick Montoya, Dillon Johnson, baseball player Robbie Flores, Chad (Chizzam), Billy Trentini, Apollo, Simon Blackwell, a waiter at Montoya's Bakery, her tutor Matt, Kevin Connors, Riley Lee and Trevor. She loves to command attention and to be center stage, whether she is acting, singing, or dancing. She is consistently disorganized, often recruiting her friends' help in her large endeavors such as Project Thread, which was aimed to deliver handmade blankets to the local homeless shelter. In the book ''Letters From The Heart'', she receives an award for Project Thread. 
*'''Nick Montoya''': Nick is a very kind, popular boy who has a crush on Charlotte. He is friends with all of the BSG, especially Charlotte. His family owns a local bakery called Montoya's; the BSG visit there frequently. Many girls at Abigail Adams Junior High like him for his friendly personality and good looks. He helps to form a travel club with Charlotte and Chelsea. He and Charlotte kiss for the first time on Valentine's Day at night in the falling snow after a dance in the 14th book, ''Crush Alert''. 
*'''Chelsea Briggs''': Chelsea is a classmate of the BSG at Abigail Adams Junior High, who is overweight but begins losing weight. Her most notable appearance is in ''Lake Rescue,'' in which she is described as such: "It was almost as if she was invisible, which was odd because Chelsea was so large." A study was conducted later, and it became proven that Chelsea's largeness inspired test subjects to lose weight. Later in the series, she becomes good friends with Charlotte and Nick Montoya. She has a passion for photography. Chelsea is good friends with the BSG. 
*'''Betsy Fitzgerald''': Betsy is in the same homeroom as the BSG. She is very intelligent and organized, and she always walks briskly, as if late for an appointment. Her dreams include getting into an [[Ivy League]] school, preferably Harvard, which her older brother attends. She constantly tries to build an impressive resume. Despite her stress over college, she is smart and friendly. Still, she can be a little annoying to the BSG. She can head anything and was a historical adviser for the movie ''Pirates of the Cape''. 
*'''Happy Lucky Thingy''': A pink toy that Avery Madden gave to their pet dog Marty. Happy Lucky Thingy is Marty's favorite chew toy. Though it is a small cloth toy the dog plays with, it never needs to be replaced and has a place in the hearts of all the BSG. 
*'''Anna McMasters''': One of the mean girls at school, she and her friend Joline are known for their cruelty and meanness. She is tall, blond, and wants to be a model. She has a sticker on her locker saying "It's an inside joke...and you're on the outside!" Anna is good at sports, often playing on the same teams as Avery. Anna is referred to as one of the "Queens of Mean" by the BSG and the rest of the school. Anna doesn't like Kiki very much because Kiki is trying to take away her friendship with Joline.
*'''Joline Kaminsky''': Anna's friend and henchwoman, Joline is one of the mean girls at school. She has a fondness for animals. Joline is very similar to Anna, but she doesn't play any sports. Joline is one of the "Queens of Mean". 
*'''Kiki Underwood''': Kiki is one of the mean girls at school. She is very loving to her parents, and her famous father has been shown to spoil her, as he offered to make a music video based on their talent show act. She is known by the BSG and the rest of the school as the "Empress of Mean," which they make no attempt to hide. Some things she enjoys to do include boating and showing off her riches.
*'''Mrs. Montoya''': Nick's mom is in charge of Montoya's Bakery. She is Hispanic and sprinkles Spanish words into her vocabulary like "hola" and "amigas," but only in moderation so a reader can understand.
*'''Other minor characters''': Sophie Morel, Dillon Johnson, Riley Lee, Henry Yurt, Reggie DeWitt, Elena Maria Martinez, Scott Madden, Kelley Summers, Sam Kaplan-Taylor, Mrs. Fields, Ms. Rodriguez, Miss Sapphire Pierce, Mrs. Weiss, Ms. Razzberry Pink, Yuri, LaFanny, and Marty (LaFanny and Marty are dogs).

{{refimprove|date=May 2014}}
A '''''Bescherelle''''' is a [[French language]] [[French grammar|grammar]] reference book best known for its [[Grammatical conjugation|verb conjugation]]s volumes. It is named in honour of the 19th-century French [[lexicographer]] and grammarian [[Louis-Nicolas Bescherelle]] (and perhaps his brother Henri Bescherelle). It is often used as a general term, but the "Collection Bescherelle" is in fact a brand name, used by [[Éditions Hatier]] for [[Metropolitan French]], and also by Éditions Hurtubise for [[Canadian French]]. 

==Overview==
The series is made up of three volumes dealing with various aspects of French [[grammar]]. Each of the three volumes uses example sentences to demonstrate proper French grammar. The term ''Bescherelle'' is often used to refer to the first book, ''L'art de conjuguer''.

''L'art de conjuguer'' (The Art of Conjugation) presents the conjugation of every type of verb in the French language in every verb tense. Each verb type is numbered so that multiple verbs with identical conjugation (such as ''chanter'' and ''enchanter'') can be grouped under one basic verb of that type. ''L'art de conjuguer'' also offers all of the rules concerning grammar within verb conjugation as well as a detailed guide on the purpose of each verb tense. The most recent versions cover 12,000 verbs in 95 conjugation tables. 

The second volume, ''L'orthographe pour tous'' (Spelling for All) explains how to convert spoken sounds in French into writing. The third volume, ''Grammaire pour tous'' (Grammar for All) is a guide on French syntax, sentence structure, the application of proper grammar to sentences, and punctuation. 

Bescherelles (''L'art de conjuguer'' in particular) are commonly used in [[French immersion]] schools, and it is often required for students to purchase one for class.

Bescherelles also exist on the grammars of [[German language|German]], [[English language|English]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Latin]] although they are less popular than that of the original French. Similarly, there are not only editions written for students whose first language is the subject, but there are also editions for students with a grounding in another language. Students can choose an edition to use their existing or new language to read ''about'' the new one.

Although the word ''Bescherelle'' has the typically feminine ending ''-elle'', it is a [[Grammatical gender|masculine noun]] in [[French language|French]] (''le Bescherelle'').

There is an [[iPhone]] and [[iPad]] application named ''Bescherelle ‐ Le conjugueur'' (The Conjugator), which contains all of the French language verbs and conjugations. It was published by the two French publishers: [[Anuman Interactive]] and [[Hatier]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.itrpress.com/cp/2010/2010-01-22_21773.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Business.com, Inc. was founded in 1999 by [[Jake Winebaum]], previously [[chairman]] of the [[Walt Disney Internet Group]]; and [[Sky Dayton]], founder of [[Earthlink]], [[Boingo Wireless]], and [[Helio (wireless carrier)|Helio]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.03/helio.html|title=Sky Dayton Gets Mobile|publisher=Wired|last=Rose|first=Frank|date=March 2006|accessdate=2008-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Around that time, the Business.com domain name was purchased from [[Marc Ostrofsky]] by Winebaum's eCompanies Ventures for $7.5 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pr.com/press-release/89370|title=One Word Domain Name Sales Reach Record Levels|publisher=PR.com|date=2008-06-11|accessdate=2008-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-1023-200256.html?hhTest=1|title= Domain name fetches record price|last=Wingfield|first=Nick|publisher=News.com|date=1997-06-04|accessdate=2008-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to investment by eCompanies, early funding in the amount of $61 million was provided in 2000 by [[Pearson PLC]], [[Reed Business Information]], [[McGraw Hill]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2004_Nov_8/ai_n6333998|title=Business.com Secures New Round of Financing; Growth Potential of Business Search Drives $10 Million Investment from Benchmark Capital|publisher=bNet (Business Wire)|date=2004-11-08|accessdate=2008-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its initial form, Business.com aimed to be the Internet's leading search engine for small business and corporate information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.business.com/info/news/sv.asp |title=Something ventured: Renewed VC Interest In A Pricey Name |last=Loftus |first=Peter |publisher=business.com (Dow Jones Newswires) |date=2004-12-08 |accessdate=2008-07-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070806025655/http://www.business.com/info/news/sv.asp |archivedate=August 6, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Business.com struggled through the [[Dot-com bubble]] years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://interactive.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/dotcomlayoffs.htm|title=Dot-Com Layoffs and Shutdowns|publisher=The Wall Street Journal Online|date=2001-11-28|accessdate=2008-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company retooled beginning in 2002 after massive layoffs and a new focus on developing a [[Pay for performance advertising|pay for performance]] ad network model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2008/05/01/technology/businesscom.fortune/index.htm?postversion=2008050211|title=Business.com's winding road|publisher=CNNMoney.com|date=2008-05-02|accessdate=2008-07-10 | first=Richard | last=Siklos}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2003, the company achieved profitability, and on November 8, 2004, the company secured an additional $10 million in venture capital funding from [[Benchmark Capital]].

On October 9, 2006, Business.com launched Work.com, a site with business how-to guides contributed by the small business community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.business.com/info/press/pr_061009.asp |title=Work.com launches to help small businesses tackle their most important business tasks |publisher=Business.com |date=2006-10-09 |accessdate=2008-07-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090704200904/http://www.business.com/info/press/pr_061009.asp |archive-date=2009-07-04 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Work.com was sold in March 2012 and is now owned by [[Salesforce.com]].

Then on July 26, 2007, after beating out [[Dow Jones &amp; Company]], the [[New York Times Company]], [[IAC/InterActiveCorp]], and [[News Corp]], print and interactive marketing company [[R.H. Donnelley]] Corporation announced plans to acquire Business.com in a deal valued at $345 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=74700&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1031378|title=R.H.

In June 2009, R.H. Donnelley filed for bankruptcy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://domainnamewire.com/2009/06/02/businesscom-owner-files-for-bankruptcy/|title=Business.com Owner Files for Bankruptcy|work=Domain Name Wire|date=June 2, 2009|accessdate=2009-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company emerged from Chapter 11 as Dex One Corporation on February 1, 2010.

In February 2011, [[Resource Nation]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.resourcenation.com resourcenation.com]&lt;/ref&gt; acquired the brand and associated assets of Business.com to become one of the largest online destinations for business buyers looking for business-to-business (B2B) solutions. [[JMI Equity]], a growth equity firm that specializes in investments in internet companies, provided funding in support of the transaction and the Company's ongoing growth.  Terms of the transactions were not disclosed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/resource-nation-acquires-businesscom-116313434.html prnewswire.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2013, the appointment of Tony Uphoff as CEO was announced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tony Uphoff Named CEO|publisher=FOLIO Mag|url=http://www.foliomag.com/2013/tony-uphoff-named-ceo-business-com-media-inc#.UT_c3xzijLk|date=2013-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Uphoff was most recently CEO of UBM TechWeb and named a Top 100 business media exec by B2B Magazine and a "Top Media Innovator " by Mins B2B in 2009.

'''''Chirurgia magna''''' ([[Latin]] for "Great [work on] Surgery"), fully titled the '''''Inventarium sive chirurgia magna''''' (Latin for "The Inventory, or the Great [work on] Surgery"), is a guide to [[surgery]] and practical [[medicine]] completed in 1363.  [[Guy de Chauliac]], [[Pope Clement VI]]'s attending [[physician]], compiled the information from his own field experience and research of historical medical texts. The original text is in [[Latin]] and comprises 465 pages. It was translated into various European languages: the version in [[Middle English]] has been published.&lt;ref&gt;The Cyrurgie of Guy de Chauliac,  M S Ogden (Editor) Early English Text Society; (19 August 1971) {{ISBN|978-0197222683}}&lt;/ref&gt; This work became one of the most important reference manuals of practical medicine for the next three centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/108069/Guy-de-Chauliac#ref175129 Guy de Chauliac], [[Encyclopædia Britannica|Britannica Online]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The physician and bibliophile [[Tibulle Desbarreaux-Bernard]] (1798–1880) believed that the ''Chirurgia magna'' was originally written in [[Catalan language|Catalan]] at the medical school in [[Montpellier]] and that the extant Latin text is an early translation.{{sfn|Trueta|1946|p=12}}

A modern edition of the Latin text, with commentary on sources, has been printed.&lt;ref&gt;Inventarium Sive Chirurgia Magna, Guigonis De Caulhiaco (Author), Michael R. McVaugh (Editor), Margaret Ogden (Editor). Publisher: Brill (1 December 1996), {{ISBN|978-9004107069}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Concise Dictionary of Spoken Chinese''''' (1947), which was compiled by [[Yuen Ren Chao]] and [[Yang Lien-sheng|Lien Sheng Yang]], made numerous important [[lexicographic]] innovations. It was the first [[Chinese dictionary]] specifically for spoken [[Spoken Chinese language|Chinese words]] rather than for written [[Chinese characters]], and one of the first to mark characters for being [[bound and unbound morphemes|"free" or "bound" morphemes]] according to whether or not they can stand alone as a complete and independent utterance.

==History==
The compilers of the ''Concise Dictionary of Chinese'', the linguist [[Yuen Ren Chao]] (1892-1982) and the historian [[Yang Lien-sheng]] (1914-1990), were famous Chinese-American scholars who worked in [[Harvard University]] wartime Chinese language programs for the [[United States Department of War|War Department]]. Chao was a visiting professor at Harvard from 1941 to 1946, while Yang entered the graduate program in 1940, and received an M.A. in 1942 and Ph.D. in 1946.

At the beginning of World War II, the shortage of Chinese and Japanese bilingual dictionaries became an urgent matter for English-speaking [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]. The [[Harvard–Yenching Institute]] said the need for Chinese dictionaries in America had "grown from chronic to acute", and selected two "practical dictionaries" to revise and reprint—without either author's permission—for "the immediate demands of American students" (Mathews 1943: v). Both [[photolithographic]] reproductions were retitled: ''[[The Five Thousand Dictionary]]'' (5th ed., 1940) became ''[[Fenn's Chinese-English Pocket-Dictionary]]'' (1942) and ''[[A Chinese-English Dictionary: Compiled for the China Inland Mission by R. H. Mathews]]'' (1931) became ''[[Mathews' Chinese-English Dictionary]]'' (1943). Y. R. Chao contributed to both these reprints. He revised the introduction and wrote the Standards of Pronunciation, Styles of Pronunciation, and Tones sections for ''Fenn's'' (1942: xxii-xxiv), and wrote the Introduction on Pronunciation for ''Mathews''' (1943: ix-xvii).

Yuen Ren Chao and Lien-sheng Yang divided the lexicographical work. Yang compiled the preliminary list of entries, partially drafted the definitions, served both as informant and as grammarian on [[Beijing dialect]], and wrote the characters. Chao wrote most of the definitions, added pronunciations from regional [[varieties of Chinese]], and wrote the front matter and the appendices (1947: vii). Chao and Yang finished compiling their ''Concise Dictionary of Spoken Chinese'' in 1945, the same year when the War Department published the anonymous ''Dictionary of Spoken Chinese: Chinese-English, English-Chinese''. Although the 847-page ''Dictionary of Spoken Chinese'' is large, it contains relatively few lexical items, approximately 2,500 English-Chinese head entries in 500 pages and 5,000 Chinese-English ones in 300 pages (1945: 1).

The Chinese-English section's head entries are not single characters, as in traditional Chinese dictionaries, but monosyllabic and polysyllabic words, which are alphabetically [[collated]] using a newly devised system for [[romanization of Chinese|romanizing Chinese]] (which became the prototype for [[Yale romanization of Mandarin|Yale romanization]]). "This represents a radical departure from all earlier Chinese-English dictionaries, which were primarily dictionaries of Chinese characters (''hànzi'') and not of the spoken language as such" (Norman 1988: 175). Although the Chinese-English section gives characters for head entries, they are treated as secondary. The ''Dictionary of Spoken Chinese'' records authentic colloquial pronunciation, and its chief function is to show a user how to employ the entries in spoken Chinese—in contrast, the chief function of previous bilingual dictionaries is to enable a user to decode written texts. Most entries provide one or more usage examples from colloquial speech. This dictionary classifies words into twelve complex [[grammatical categories]]: [[adjective]] (A), [[demonstrative]] (Dem), [[adverb]] (H), [[intransitive verb]] (I), [[Conjunction (grammar)|conjunction]] (J), [[coverb]] (K), [[Chinese classifier|measure word]] (M), [[noun]] (N), [[Numeral (linguistics)|numeral]] (Num), [[pronoun]] (Pron), [[Chinese grammar#Serial verb constructions|resultative compound]] (RC) and [[transitive verb]] (V).

The ''Dictionary of Spoken Chinese'''s English-Chinese section averages around 5 entries per page, compared to around 18 per page in the Chinese-English section. Some English-Chinese entries are quite elaborate, providing multiple Chinese translation equivalents and usage examples illustrating various semantic nuances of the English word.

The influence of [[Structural linguistics#American Structuralism|American structural linguistics]], which shifted interest from the written to the spoken language, is evident in both the War Department's ''Dictionary of Spoken Chinese'' (1945) and Chao's and Yang's ''Concise Dictionary of Spoken Chinese'' (1947). "In both dictionaries we can observe the authors attempting not just to provide their Chinese entries with English equivalents but to demonstrate through grammatical categorization and examples how they are actually used" (Norman 1988: 175).

Although the War Department dictionary was never widely distributed or used, it affected Chao's and Yang's ''Concise Dictionary of Spoken Chinese'', and served as the model for two well-known dictionaries. [[Yale University]]'s Institute of Far Eastern Languages published a revised edition ''Dictionary of Spoken Chinese'' (1966), and [[Fred Fangyu Wang]] published a two-volume ''Mandarin Chinese dictionary'', Chinese-English (1967) and English-Chinese (1971). With these dictionaries, "American efforts in Chinese lexicography effectively ceased" (Norman 1988: 176)—until the ''[[ABC Chinese-English Dictionary]]'' (1996).
.

==Content==
The ''Concise Dictionary of Spoken Chinese'' comprises approximately 5,000 single-character head entries, [[collated]] by [[Collation#Radical-and-stroke sorting|radical-and-stroke]] and numbered according to the 214 [[Kangxi radicals]]. The twelve most frequent radicals are given at the bottom of the pages for the dictionary user to memorize. "To insure further the finding of the characters, the authors have entered each character under all its apparently possible radicals and made a cross reference to the main entry" (1947: xxvi). For instance, 魯 ''luu'' is entered under [[radical 72]] 曰 "sun", with the note "See [[Radical 195|Rad. 195]] 魚 ["fish"]." The ''Concise Dictionary'' includes the popular and [[Cursive script (East Asia)|cursive]] forms of many characters, as well as the [[Suzhou numerals]] (e.g., "〢 ''ell'' Soochow numeral for '2', used in trade"), and the [[Bopomofo]] symbols ("ㄎ ''ke'' National Phonetic letter for the aspirated initial ''k''"), which had never been included in a Chinese dictionary, thus removing "one source of bewilderment for the foreign student of Chinese" (Luo 1947: 434).

The ''Concise Dictionary'' has "many elaborate features to help the user study the refinements of spoken Chinese" (Dunn 1977: 78). Chao's introduction lists eight unique features not found in previous comparable Chinese-English dictionaries such as Fenn's and Mathews' (1947: v-vi).

(1) The [[grammatical function]] of each word is distinguished according to whether it is [[free morpheme|free]] (F) or [[bound morpheme|bound]] (B). With the exception of [[measure words]] or [[Chinese classifiers]], called "auxiliary nouns" (AN), the dictionary generally did not indicate syntactic [[part of speech]], called "word classes". Chao explains, "The same word, as a noun, means one thing; as an auxiliary noun (AN) something else, as a verb something else again. This is not a matter of inference, as those who say that Chinese has no parts of speech assume, but a matter of individual facts." (1947: v). The dictionary's English translation equivalents usually can clarify Chinese part of speech; if 吃 ''chy'' [''chī''] is defined by the English verb "to eat", then it is itself also a verb. word classes are only specified in cases of ambiguity; 脂肪 ''jyfang'' [''zhīfáng''] "fat" is marked ''n.'' "noun" since English "fat" can also be an adjective (Norman 1988: 174). The dictionary lists other specialized [[grammatical categories]] (1947: xxvii-xxxi), for instance, "auxiliary nouns proper" and "quasi-auxiliary nouns", and introduces for the first time in a Chinese dictionary "many new ideas about the linguistic structure of Chinese, such as the four types of verbal [[Complement (linguistics)|complements]]": the "pre-transitive," "verb-object construction", "possessive object," and "impersonal verb-object compound"" (Luo 1947: 432-433).

(2) The stylistic [[Register (sociolinguistics)|register]] or [[usage]] class of each entry is either marked by an abbreviation (e.g., ''derog.'', ''honorif.'', ''poet.'') or implied in the translation (as 殆 "well-nigh," but 差不多 "almost"), in order to "channel the student's efforts in using the language to more profitable directions".

(3) The ''Concise Dictionary of Spoken Chinese'' is the first Chinese dictionary to give detailed descriptions of [[Chinese particles|particles]] and [[interjections]]. For example, 了 has three entries: 
*了 ''leau'' [''liǎo''] "F [free] to finish, conclude" … -B [bound chiefly to a preceding word] "to a finish" … BB [the word reduplicated] to understand clearly", with 13 usage examples
*了 ''.le'' [neutral tone, pinyin ''le''] "-.B [bound, with neutral tone, to a preceding word] final particle to indicate a new situation or a new realization of an existing situation … in narration … to indicate obviousness", with 6 examples
*了 ''.le'' "-.B word-particle: to indicate completed action when there is a numeral (or AN taking the place of 一) before the object … to indicate condition or time … to serve as a second compl. [complement] after a result. compl.", with 5 usage examples, and a lengthy note about negative ''le'' constructions (1947: 6-7)

(4) Dictionary entries give [[morphological derivation]]s, words created by adding [[affixes]] (e.g., 兒 ''erl'' [''r''], the "syllabic diminutive suffix, frequently used in verse") or by [[Chinese grammar#Reduplication|reduplication]] (單 ''dan'' [''dān''] single … 單單 "(this) only, alone; (this) of all things").

(5) Entries also give [[Collocation|collocative words]] that are frequently used together (e.g., "棋 ''chyi'' [''qí''] "chess" … 下棋 "to play chess or ''go''") and common [[Opposite (semantics)|antonyms]]. This dictionary "includes a great number of meanings even of well-known words which so far have not been noted in any other dictionary" (Simon 1949: 137).

(6) The [[Gwoyeu Romatzyh]] "National Romanization" system, which Y.R. Chao co-created and popularized, is used for pronunciation of main entries, along with usual [[Wade-Giles]] orthography given in parentheses. Appendix 1, Part 2, is a table of concordance for these two systems. Tonal spelling of the [[four tones]] is the primary advantage of National Romanization, for instance, ''dau'' (1st tone), ''daur'' (2nd), ''dao'' (3rd), and ''daw'' (4th tone), corresponding to pinyin ''dāo'', ''dáo'', ''dǎo'', and ''dào''. The [[Standard Chinese phonology#Neutral tone|neutral tone]] is indicated by a dot before the atonal syllable.

(7) Romanizations incorporate [[superscripts]] and other symbols to denote the historical features of [[Middle Chinese]] pronunciation and modern pronunciation in [[varieties of Chinese]], often misleadingly called "[[dialects]]". For examples, a subscribed dot under an initial (恤 ''ṣhiuh'' [xù] "to pity, to give relief to") makes it possible for students interested in [[Peking opera]] to distinguish 尖 "sharp" [[dental consonants]] from 圓 "rounded" [[palatal consonants]], and a superscript &lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt; indicates [[Cantonese]] has a final ''-p'' [[checked tone]] and [[Wu Chinese]] has a [[glottal stop]] (Luo 1947: 433).

(8) All entries "are treated as [[morphemes]], or monosyllabic meaningful spoken words", whether [[bound morphemes]] or [[free morphemes]], rather than as [[Chinese characters|characters]]. Chao gives a chemical analogy to differentiate between ''zìdiǎn'' [[wikt:字典|字典]] "character dictionaries" and ''cídiǎn'' [[wikt:辭典|辭典]] "word dictionaries".
&lt;blockquote&gt;In China, dictionaries are divided into 字典 and 詞典, the former giving only single characters, which may be compared with chemical elements, and the latter compounds and phrases, like chemical compounds. To pursue the chemical analogy one step further, compounds are so numerous that they cannot all be included except in a much more comprehensive work. We can do more than merely list the elements and their atomic weights. We can classify their affinities, their electric polarity, indicate whether they can be ionized, and give such information as to enable us to predict more compounds than can be listed. Thus by giving the morphemes of the language properly analyzed, indicating whether they are bound or free, the attempt has been made to give the equivalent of a dictionary of compounds within the space of a dictionary of single words." (1947: vi)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
By treating all entries as bound or free morphemes rather than as characters, Chao and Yang have made an attempt to give the equivalent of a dictionary of compounds within the space of a dictionary of single words (Luo 1947: 433).

The dictionary's [[spine (bookbinding)|spine]] has English "''Concise Dictionary of Spoken Chinese'' / Chao and Yang" and the [[front cover]] has equivalent Chinese "國語字典 [''Guóyǔ zìdiǎn'', "[[Standard Chinese]] Dictionary"] / 趙元任 / 楊聯陞 / 合編" ["Zhào Yuánrèn, Yáng Liánshēng, co-editors"]. The [[title page]] has both English "''Concise Dictionary of Spoken Chinese'' / By Yuen Ren Chao and Lien Sheng Yang" and the same Chinese.

The Chinese character [[wikt:道|道]] (composed of [[radical 162]] [[wikt:辶|辶]] "walk" and a ''shǒu'' [[wikt:首|首]] "head" phonetic) for ''dào'' "way; path; say; the [[Tao|Dao]]" or ''dǎo'' "guide; lead; instruct" makes a good sample entry for illustrating a dictionary because it has two pronunciations and complex semantics. Chao's and Yang's dictionary entry gives detailed [[syntactic]] and [[Pragmatics|pragmatic]] information, but fails to note the pronunciation ''dǎo'' 道 that is a [[variant Chinese character]] for ''dǎo'' [[wikt:導|導]] (with [[radical 41]] 寸 "thumb") "to lead, to guide", which they do enter (1947: 64).
&lt;blockquote&gt;道 '''d̠aw'''. (tao&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;). ''B'' way, reason, principle, ''Tao'' 道.理&lt;sub&gt;96&lt;/sub&gt;; ''-l'' a road ''AN'' 條, 個; ''AN'' a course (of food); ''-l'', ''tz'' a streak ''AN'' a streak ''-l''; ''F'' to say (introducing a direct quotation: novel style); ''B-'' to say (polite words), ''as'' 道喜&lt;sub&gt;30&lt;/sub&gt; ''v-o'' 'to congratulate,' 道謝 ''v-o'' 'to give thanks.' 有道 ''used at the end of the salutation in writing to a prominent scholar''; 沒道.理 unreasonable; mean; rude. (1947: 218) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
First, this 道 entry glosses pronunciation with National Romanization ''d̠aw'' and Wade-Giles ''tao&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;''. The underscored ''d̠'' consonant indicates a [[Voice (phonetics)|voiced]] initial in Wu and a lower [[Vocal register|register]] tone in Cantonese. Second, it gives English translation equivalents for the bound word (''B'') ''dàoli'' [[wikt:道理|道理]], with the dot before 理 denoting neutral tone ''li'', and the subscript 96 meaning [[radical 96]] [[wikt:玉|玉]] "jade" where a dictionary user can find the character 理 ''lii'' listed under 96.7, with 7 being the number of strokes in the ''lǐ'' 里 phonetic. Third, it gives the colloquial term ''dàor'' 道兒 "road" with ''-l'' indicating the word plus the diminutive retroflex suffix ''-r'' [[wikt:兒|兒]], counted with ''tiáo'' [[wikt:條|條]] "[[measure word]] for long, narrow things" (''AN'' abbreviates "auxiliary noun"). Fourth, the entry notes that 道 itself is used as a measure word for [[Course (food)|courses]] during a meal. Fifth, ''dàor'' 道兒 or ''dàozi'' 道子 (''tz'' denotes the noun suffix 子) can mean "streak", counted with ''tiáo'' 條 or ''ge'' [[wikt:個|個]] "general measure word". Sixth, ''dàor'' 道兒 can also be used as a measure word for streaks. Seventh, the free word (''F'') ''dào'' 道 ''dao'' means "to say". Eighth, it also means "to say (polite words)" in bound terms such as ''dàoxǐ'' [[wikt:道喜|道喜]] (subscript 30 denotes [[radical 30]] 口 "mouth"), ''dàoxiè'' [[wikt:道謝|道謝]], and ''yǒudào'' [[wikt:有道|有道]]. Ninth, the entry gives the bound word ''méi dàoli'' [[wikt:沒道理|沒道理]]. Chao's and Yang's brief 道 entry is packed with linguistic information for users.

==Reception==
Most, if not all, reviewers have praised the ''Concise Dictionary of Spoken Chinese'', while some have been critical. The co-author Lien-Sheng Yang responded to DeFrancis' and Simon's reviews in a 1949 article about free and bound morphemes in Chinese.

The Chinese linguist [[Luo Changpei]] (1947: 432) describes the dictionary as "unprecedented in the history of Chinese-European lexicography since its beginnings" in the early 17th century. Luo lists three unique features of the dictionary, combining six of the eight given by Chao (above); the first combines (1) and (3), the second (2), (7), (8), and the third is (6). Luo (1947: 435-436) lists 15 corrections or suggestions, 9 of which are included in later editions of the dictionary, under Corrections and Additions (1957: x)

The American linguist and lexicographer [[John DeFrancis]] described the ''Concise Dictionary'' as "a landmark notable for its presentation of a great deal of extremely valuable information—grammatical, phonetic, dialectical, and otherwise" (1948: 447).

DeFrancis suggests that Chao and Yang have been "unduly influenced by the ideographs and the myths of Chinese monosyllabism" (1948: 447). Although the dictionary title has "Spoken Chinese", the authors approach the subject through characters rather than through speech. Using data from a 10-page sample, DeFrancis disproves Chao's contention that with "very few exceptions" Chinese morphemes are "for the most part monosyllabic" (1947: vi). The sample dictionary entries marked as "literary" (L), "comparable to ''yclept'' in English and hence not really belonging in a dictionary of spoken Chinese", amount to 16% of the total entries. ([[wikt:Yclept|Yclept]] is an archaic or humorous word meaning "called; named".
&lt;blockquote&gt;Of the entries which really represent spoken forms, no more than 29 per cent have been classified by the authors as Free, the only category which is generally accepted as designating a word in English and other languages. But not all the remaining 71 per cent are classified as Bound forms of the type ''er'' in ''banker'' or ''sender''. Only 49 per cent are of this type of meaningful syllables without independent life. The remaining 22 per cent, represented by ''shan'' and ''hu'' in ''shanhu'', "coral," are of a type which have no more meaning or independence than do ''cor'' and ''al'' in the English equivalent. (1948: 448) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
DeFrancis proposes that the category of Bound syllables (not "words") should be divided into two groups: "meaningless bound syllables" (like ''shan'' and ''hu'' in ''shanhu'' 珊瑚 "coral") and "meaningful bound syllables" (like ''fu'' "father" and ''mu'' "mother" in ''fumu'' 父母 "parents"). "The former are fully bound (occurring in only one word), and the latter are semibound (occurring in more than one word)." DeFrancis concludes that the contributions of scholars like Dr. Chao, "give hope that lexicographers, if they can concentrate on Chinese speech and not be misled by the ideographic writing, will eventually succeed in compiling a real dictionary of the Chinese spoken language." (1948: 448).

In response to DeFrancis' review, Lien-sheng Yang states that comparing the dictionary entries designated as literary to ''yclept'' in English is "misleading, because the latter is an archaic word, whereas the former are still used in modern Spoken Chinese" (1949: 463). Yang says DeFrancis' suggestion of differentiating "meaningless bound syllables" and "meaningful bound syllables" appears interesting but unfortunately it involves three difficulties. First, since the word ''meaning'' is ambiguous, a linguist has to define "meaningful" and "meaningless" and ascertain whether all native-speaker informants agree. Second, a linguist needs to consider differences in the informants' background and education, "One syllable which is meaningful to one may be meaningless to another" (1949: 463). Third, the identification of meaningful and meaningless syllables with those occurring in more than one word and those occurring in only one "is doubtful". Taking the example of ''shan'' and ''hu'' in ''shanhu'' "coral", Yang notes both characters are used in other compounds, namely, ''shanshan'' 珊珊 "tinkling sound (of ornaments)" and ''hulian'' 瑚璉 "two types of ritual vessels" (1949: 464).

The German sinologist [[Walter Simon (sinologist)|Walter Simon]] says the ''Concise Dictionary of Spoken Chinese'' is a "definite advance on our knowledge of the Chinese language" and calls it a "very important lexicographical contribution" from which "students cannot fail to derive great benefit" (1949: 137). Simon says
&lt;blockquote&gt;[O]ne can readily see that a dictionary which notes the alternatives "free" or "bound" in the case of each single character, is a mine of information which may lend itself to very important subsequent research. Questions like the following come to the mind at once. "How many of the characters included in the dictionary occur only 'free' or only 'bound', how many occur with the suffix –''tz'' or –''l'', what is the distribution if we proceed to grouping words according to their meanings (e.g., parts of the body)? Are practically all verbs free and all nouns 'bound', etc., etc.?" (1949: 137)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Quoting this remark, Yang says, "These are good questions. The last one is particularly suggestive, because it leads to the question whether there are free and bound parts of speech." (1949: 465).

Yu-Ju Chih, a teacher and developer of Chinese language textbooks, says that unlike almost all the commonly used Chinese-English dictionaries that are geared primarily to reading Chinese texts, the ''Concise Dictionary of Spoken Chinese'' is the "only one of its kind available to the public" (1967: 108).

[[Image:Chambers Cyclopaedia 1728.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Ephraim Chambers]] ''Cyclopaedia'' (1728)]]
[[Image:Table of Trigonometry, Cyclopaedia, Volume 2.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Table of [[Trigonometry]], 1728 ''Cyclopaedia'']]
'''''Cyclopædia: or, An Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences''''' (two volumes in [[Book size|folio]]) was an [[encyclopedia]] published by [[Ephraim Chambers]] in [[London]] in 1728, and reprinted in numerous editions in the eighteenth century. The ''Cyclopaedia'' was one of the first general encyclopedias to be produced in English. 
The 1728 subtitle gives a summary of the aims of the author:

:''Cyclopaedia, or, an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences: Containing the Definitions of the Terms, and Accounts of the Things Signify'd Thereby, in the Several Arts, both Liberal and Mechanical, and the Several Sciences, Human and Divine: the Figures, Kinds, Properties, Productions, Preparations, and Uses, of Things Natural and Artificial; the Rise, Progress, and State of Things Ecclesiastical, Civil, Military, and Commercial: with the Several Systems, Sects, Opinions, etc; among Philosophers, Divines, Mathematicians, Physicians, Antiquaries, Criticks, etc.: The Whole Intended as a Course of Ancient and Modern Learning.''

==Noteworthy features==
The first edition included numerous [[cross-reference]]s meant to connect articles scattered by the use of alphabetical order, a dedication to the King, [[George II of Great Britain|George II]], and a philosophical preface at the beginning of Volume 1. Among other things, the preface gives an analysis of forty-seven divisions of knowledge, with classed lists of the articles belonging to each, intended to serve as a table of contents and also as a directory indicating the order in which the articles should be read.

==Printing history==
A second edition appeared in 1738 in two volumes in folio, with 2,466 pages. This edition was supposedly retouched and amended in a thousand places, with a few added articles and some enlarged articles. Chambers was prevented from doing more because the booksellers were alarmed by a bill in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] containing a clause to oblige the publishers of all improved editions of books to print their improvements separately. The bill, after passing the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]], was unexpectedly thrown out by the [[House of Lords]]; but fearing that it might be revived, the booksellers thought it best to retreat though more than twenty sheets had been printed.

Five other editions were published in London from 1739 to 1751–1752. An edition was also published in [[Dublin]] in 1742; this and the London editions were all 2 volumes in folio. An Italian translation appearing in [[Venice]], 1748–1749, 4to, 9 vols., was the first complete Italian encyclopaedia. When Chambers was in France in 1739, he rejected very favorable proposals to publish an edition there dedicated to Louis XV.

Chambers' work was carefully done, and popular. However, it had defects and omissions, as he was well aware; at his death, on 15 May 1740, he had collected and arranged materials for seven new volumes. [[George Lewis Scott]] was employed by the booksellers to select articles for the press and to supply others, but he left before the job was finished. The job was then given to [[John Hill (author)|Dr. John Hill]]. The ''Supplement'' was published in London in 1753 in two folio volumes with 3307 pages and 12 plates. Hill was a botanist, and the botanical part, which had been weak in the ''Cyclopaedia'', was the best.

[[Abraham Rees]], a [[nonconformist]] minister, published a revised and enlarged edition in 1778–1788, with the supplement and improvements incorporated. It was published in London, as a folio of 5 vols., 5010 pages (but not paginated), and 159 plates. It was published in 418 numbers at 6d. each. Rees claimed to have added more than 4,400 new articles. At the end, he gave an index of articles, classed under 100 .heads, numbering about 57,000 and filling 80 pages. The heads, with 39 cross references, were arranged alphabetically.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;Encyclopaedia Britannica&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;, 11ed, vol 9, p 374, article Encyclopaedia, (1910-1911)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Precursors and the ''Encyclopédie''==
Among the precursors of Chambers's ''Cyclopaedia'' was [[John Harris (writer)|John Harris]]'s ''[[Lexicon Technicum]]'', of 1704 (later editions from 1708 through 1744). By its title and content, it was "An Universal English Dictionary of Arts and Sciences: Explaining not only the Terms of Art, but the Arts Themselves."  While Harris's work is often classified as a technical dictionary, it also took material from [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] and [[Edmond Halley|Halley]], among others.

Chambers's ''Cyclopaedia'' in turn became the inspiration for the landmark ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' of [[Denis Diderot]] and [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]], which owed its inception to a proposed French translation of Chambers' work begun in 1744 by [[John Mills (encyclopedist)|John Mills]],&lt;ref&gt;{{EB1911|wstitle=Chambers, Ephraim|inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; assisted by [[Gottfried Sellius]]

'''DNS over HTTPS''' ('''DoH''') is a protocol for performing remote [[Domain Name System]] (DNS) resolution via the [[HTTPS]] protocol. A goal of the method is to increase user privacy and security by preventing eavesdropping and manipulation of DNS data by [[man-in-the-middle attacks]].&lt;ref name=register&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/12/14/protecting_dns_privacy/|title=IETF protects privacy and helps net neutrality with DNS over HTTPS|access-date=2018-03-21|language=en|first= Richard|last=Chirgwin|date=14 Dec 2017 |website=The Register}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2018|03}}, [[Google]] and the [[Mozilla Foundation]] are testing versions of DNS over HTTPS.&lt;ref name=Google1&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/docs/dns-over-https|title=DNS-over-HTTPS  {{!}}  Public DNS {{!}} Google Developers|website=Google Developers|language=en|access-date=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/software/mozilla-is-testing-dns-over-https-support-in-firefox/|title=Mozilla Is Testing "DNS over HTTPS" Support in Firefox|first=Catalin|last=Cimpanu|work=BleepingComputer|access-date=2018-03-21|date=2018-03-20|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to improving security, another goal of DNS over HTTPS is to improve performance: testing of ISP [[DNS resolver]]s has shown that they have surprisingly slow response times in many cases, a problem that can be multiplied further by the need to resolve many addresses to deliver a single service such as a web page load.&lt;ref name=register/&gt;

DNS over HTTPS is a standard as RFC 8484 under the [[IETF]]. It uses [[HTTP/2]] and [[HTTPS]], and  supports the "wire format" DNS response data, as returned in existing UDP responses, in an HTTPS payload with the &lt;code&gt;application/dns-message&lt;/code&gt; [[MIME type]].&lt;ref name=register/&gt;&lt;ref name=RFC8484&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc8484//|title=RFC 8484 - DNS Queries over HTTPS|website=datatracker.ietf.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-20|first=P|last=Hoffman|first2=P|last2=McManus}}&lt;/ref&gt; If HTTP/2 is used, the server may also use [[HTTP/2 server push]] to send values that it anticipates the client may find useful in advance.&lt;ref name=draft-ietf-doh-dns-over-https&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-doh-dns-over-https/|title=draft-ietf-doh-dns-over-https-08 - DNS Queries over HTTPS|website=datatracker.ietf.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-20|first=P|last=Hoffman|first2=P|last2=McManus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Implementation scenarios ==

DNS over HTTPS is used for recursive DNS resolution by [[Recursive_DNS_resolver | DNS resolvers]]. Resolvers (''DoH clients'') need to have access to a DoH server hosting a query endpoint.&lt;ref name="draft-ietf-doh-dns-over-https" /&gt;

DNS over HTTPS currently lacks native support in operating systems. Thus a user wishing to use it must install additional software. Three usage scenarios are common:

* Using a DoH implementation within an application: Some browsers have a built-in DoH implementation and can thus perform queries by bypassing the operating system's DNS functionality. A drawback is that an application may not inform the user if it skips DoH querying, either by misconfiguration or lack of support for DoH.
* Installing a DoH proxy on the name server in the local network: In this scenario client systems continue to use traditional (port 53 or 853) DNS to query the name server in the local network, which will then gather the necessary replies via DoH by reaching DoH-servers in the Internet. This method is transparent to the end user.
* Installing a DoH proxy on a local system: In this scenario, operating systems are configured to query a locally running DoH proxy. In contrast to the previously mentioned method, the proxy needs to be installed on each system wishing to use DoH, which might require a lot of effort in larger environments.

In all of these scenarios, the DoH client does not directly query any [[Authoritative name server|authoritative name servers]].  Instead, the client relies on the DoH server using traditional (port 53 or 853) queries to finally reach authoritative servers.  Thus DoH does not qualify as an [[End-to-end encryption|end-to-end encrypted]] protocol, only hop-to-hop encrypted and only if [[DNS over TLS]] is used consistently.

'''Danmarks Adels Aarbog'''&lt;!--Note: This publication continues to spell its title using the pre-1948 spelling, hence "Aarbog" rather than "Årbog"--&gt; (''Yearbook of the Danish Nobility'') is an annual - now tri-annual - publication that details the [[genealogies]], titles, and [[coat of arms|coats of arms]] of [[Danish nobility|Danish]] and [[Norwegian nobility|Norwegian noble families]]. It was first published in 1884, making it one of the oldest such publications. The most recent volume, 2012-14, is volume 100 in the series, which has detailed more than 700 [[Pedigree chart|pedigrees]]. 

Each volume has a new version of the index of the families, that have a pedigree in DAA. The indes was revised in vol 2012-14, and is on the net, link below.

Most volumes have a section of new corrections and additions to earlier pedigrees. So each pedigree may have a number of corrections scatter through the many volumes. The corrections should be consultet by users of a pedigree(!) All corrections and additions can be found on the Net, sorted by family name. Link below.

Many of the pedigrees are more than 100 years old. They can be difficult or irritating to reed. A readers guide in Danish is on the Net, link below.

'''Dawn Breakers International Film Festival (DBIFF)''' is an international travelling [[film festival]] held in various cities throughout the world. The festival originated in 2007 and debuted in [[Phoenix, Arizona]] and has since been held in [[San Diego]], [[Houston]] and [[Zurich]]. DBIFF was recognized as an important festival and nominated at the 2014 annual list of [[MovieMaker]]'s "Top 25 Film Festivals of the World" in the Social Cause category.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.moviemaker.com/festivals/the-coolest-film-festivals-in-the-world-2013-top-25-general-film-festival-winners/&lt;/ref&gt; Selected films from this festival has received theatrical distribution, television broadcast and four [[Academy Award]] nominations.

==Background==
The Festival is a non-profit organization focused on showcasing films and filmmakers who produce positive films. It has shown both independent and commercial films in the past few years. The filmmakers submit from around the world and there are no restrictions on what is accepted as long as it meets the theme of the festival. DBIFF is one of the few festivals in the world that also accepts Television, Music Videos and Websidoes in their selection. Several publications have covered the festival and the films including the [[Indian Express]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.indianexpress.com/news/animated-leap/407233/&lt;/ref&gt; the official Baha'i news service,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bahai.us/film-festival&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[American Samoa|Samoan]] news.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.samoanews.com/viewstory.php?storyid=11604&amp;edition=1261648800&lt;/ref&gt;

The festival is also a [[Bahá'í]]-inspired organization and is considered as one of the major developments in the changing culture of the Bahá'í Faith in the past fifteen years.&lt;ref&gt;http://bahai-library.com/price_culture_learning_paradigm&lt;/ref&gt; The name of the festival, though spelled differently, is inspired by the book ''[[The Dawn-Breakers]]''.

==Plot==
The Sesame Street gang have gone on a field trip to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Big Bird has arranged to meet with Snuffy at the museum but before he can, it is closing time. Big Bird decides to go off and look for Snuffy. Before the group can leave, they realize Big Bird is missing and run all through the museum looking for him. The chase has them going through different exhibits at high speed and missing, spotting, and chasing him. After a bit, they give up, only to find that they are locked in the museum overnight. They decide to go back out and look for Big Bird and look at all the exhibits while they are at it.

Big Bird eventually finds Snuffy and they wander the [[Egypt]]ian exhibit and encounter an Egyptian prince named Sahu (Aram Chowdhury) and his cat who have been cursed to remain on Earth and not be able to become a star like his parents until he answers the question "Where does today meet yesterday?" Every night at midnight for thousands of years, a demon ([[James Mason]]) appears to ask Sahu that and he has answered wrong every night. Big Bird suggests Sahu remain on Earth and become "the only 4,000 year old kid on Sesame Street", but later agrees with Snuffy that they should work together to get the answer right.

Meanwhile, the group has split up and are all in different exhibits. Bob and Cookie Monster find themselves looking at pictures with food in them. While Cookie Monster tries to eat the pictures, Bob points out to him a sign that says "Please don't eat the pictures." He replies with "Oh, this going to be a long night." He later sings the song "Don't Eat the Pictures" about this. Oscar finds an exhibit of Greek and Roman statues that have been broken by [[natural disaster]]s. He looks in and breaks into song on how beautiful they are to him. Grover finds an exhibit filled with armor from medieval times and thinks a suit of [[Maximilian armour]] is a guy named "Max" and tries to befriend him by changing into his Super Grover costume and singing a song. Bert and Ernie view the painting of ''[[Washington Crossing the Delaware]]'', to which Bert comments on the dedication of Washington and his men, but Ernie comments how he was very silly to cross in the winter and should have waited until Easter or taken the [[George Washington Bridge]].

As the night passes, Big Bird and Snuffy continue to try to figure out the answer to the question. Soon just before midnight Big Bird unknowingly figures out the answer is "a museum." When the demon appears that night, the question is answered correctly and Sahu is sent to [[Osiris]] ([[Fritz Weaver]]) to have his heart weighed. When the feather to weigh his heart doesn't appear, Big Bird offers one of his to help. But when Sahu's heart is too heavy, Big Bird claims that it wasn't fair since Sahu was on Earth for 40 centuries and he was so alone his heart would be heavy, so he can't become a star.

After this, Sahu's heart becomes lighter and he is now ready to join his parents and take his cat. Big Bird and Snuffy then exit the museum, look up into the night sky, and see four stars in a straight line (representing Sahu, his parents, and his cat), and are glad that they reunited Sahu with his parents. When morning comes, Big Bird finds the group and Snuffy is not there. He got up early and left to get to "Snufflegarden." Cookie Monster promised anything on a hot dog stand as a special reward for not eating anything in the museum, and decides to eat the entire stand.

After the credits, Big Bird pretends to be a statue. He encourages the viewers to visit their local museum, and comments on how staying perfectly still is tiring and wonders how statues can do it.

The title song from ''Don't Eat the Pictures'' begins with Cookie Monster and his human friend, [[Bob McGrath]] in front of ''Still Life with Ham'', a painting by Philippe Rousseau which Cookie Monster tries to devour. Bob holds Cookie Monster back and reminds him that he promised not to eat anything in the museum.  Then Cookie Monster breaks into song, with angelic choral accompaniment, about paintings, statues, and mummies, and how he understands how important it is to not devour them.&lt;ref name="youtube1"/&gt;

The '''''East Asia Law Review''''' is an [[academic journal]] focusing on legal issues concerning East Asia, published by an organization of [[juris Doctor|J.D.]] and [[Master of Laws|LL.M.]] students at the [[University of Pennsylvania Law School]]. One or two issues are published in each volume, with an occasional additional issue reprinting papers from a symposium held by the East Asia Law Review.&lt;ref name="EALR Home"&gt;[http://www.pennealr.com/ East Asia Law Review Home] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121165128/http://www.pennealr.com/ |date=2008-11-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In its 2010-2011 cycle, it will publish its sixth volume.

==Mission statement==
The East Asia Law Review has the following mission statement:&lt;ref name="EALR About"&gt;[http://www.pennealr.com/pages/about_us.php East Asia Law Review: About Us] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100415002136/http://www.pennealr.com/pages/about_us.php |date=2010-04-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The East Asia Law Review is committed to addressing current cutting-edge legal developments in Asia. Recognizing an existing gap in the literature exclusively dedicated to the region, we seek to provide a forum where scholars and students may contribute to the development of legal affairs within the region. To this end we seek to publish a journal and to host a variety of events within the Penn legal community in an effort to inform our peers and colleagues about recent developments in the regional jurisprudence.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==History==
The journal was founded as the ''Chinese Law &amp; Policy Review'', and published its first two volumes (for a total of three issues) under that title. It originally published articles both in English and in Mandarin Chinese. In 2008, it adopted its current name, reflecting its intention to expand its focus from China to the greater East Asia region and it simultaneously became an English language only publication.&lt;ref name="EALR About" /&gt; The journal held its first symposium in 2009, titled "Repeating History? Lessons from the 1997 East Asia Financial Crisis and What they Mean Today."

==Editor selection==
The journal is managed by a board selected by its previous executives, and selects promising candidates from amongst the law school's students as associate editors.&lt;ref name="EALR Membership"&gt;[http://www.pennealr.com/pages/about_us/membership.php East Asia Law Review Membership] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100416041417/http://www.pennealr.com/pages/about_us/membership.php |date=2010-04-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{italic title}}
The '''Enchiridion''' is a [[compendium]] of all the basic texts on [[Catholic]] [[dogma]] and [[morality]] since the [[Apostolic Age]]. Commissioned by [[Pope Pius IX]], it has been in use since 1854, and has been regularly updated since.

== Name ==
The name ''Enchiridion'' (from Greek ''cheir,'' "hand") means "handbook." Originally published as "Enchiridion Symbolorum et Definitionum", it is today published as "Enchiridion symbolorum, definitionum et declarationum de rebus fidei et morum" (meaning “Handbook of creeds, definitions, and declarations on matters of faith and morals.”) 

The Enchiridion is sometimes referred to as '''Denzinger''', after its first editor, [[Heinrich Joseph Dominicus Denzinger]]. It is commonly abbreviated 'Dz' in early editions and 'DS'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=General Directory for Catechesis | url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cclergy/documents/rc_con_ccatheduc_doc_17041998_directory-for-catechesis_en.html | accessdate=2009-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; in editions edited by Adolf Schönmetzer due to a revision in numbering.

== Description ==
By including all basic texts of Catholic teachings, the Enchiridion serves as a compendium of faith through the centuries. It is also a research instrument for theologians, historians, and individuals with an interest in the study of Christianity. The latest updates extend to the teachings of [[Pope John Paul II]]; it can thus be used for research on contemporary issues, such as the social teachings of the Church, [[subsidiarity (Catholicism)|subsidiarity]], [[poverty]], [[social justice]], [[death penalty]], [[birth control]] or the [[ordination of women]]. 

In 2012, [[Ignatius Press]] published a bilingual Latin-English version of the 43rd edition (2010) of Denzinger-Hünermann, with entries up to 2008. This English edition was edited by Robert Fastiggi and Anne Englund Nash.

==Structure==
The Enchiridion is chronologically ordered, starting with the ''[[Apostles’ Creed|Symbolum Apostolicum]]''. It includes the teachings of [[popes]] and [[ecumenical council]]s since. It does not repeat all the full texts, but only those central parts which are relevant to dogmatic or moral theology. All texts in Denzinger-Schönmetzer are listed in Latin. 

Since the 37th edition of Denzinger-Hünermann (1991), the original language (mostly Latin) is put in the left-hand column with a corresponding vernacular translation in the right-hand column. In addition to the 2012 English edition of Denzinger-Hünermann, there are also editions in French, Italian, Spanish, and other languages (as well as the original German). 
 
In addition to the texts, the Enchiridion supplies certain indices: 
* ''Index scripturisticus'', on the uses of scripture in various dogmas   
* ''Index systematicus'' of dogmatic and moral Church teachings 
* ''Index alphabeticus'' of names and subjects

The British government fitted out [[Ross expedition|an expedition]] led by [[James Clark Ross]] to investigate magnetism and marine geography in high southern latitudes, which sailed with two ships, [[HMS Terror (1813)|HMS ''Terror'']] and [[HMS Erebus (1826)|HMS ''Erebus'']] on 29 September 1839 from Chatham.

The ships arrived, after several stops, at the [[Cape of Good Hope]] on 4 April 1840. On 21 April the giant kelp ''[[Macrocystis pyrifera]]'' was found off [[Prince Edward Islands|Marion Island]], but no landfall could be made there or on the [[Crozet Islands]] due to the harsh winds. On 12 May the ships anchored at Christmas Harbour for two and a half months, during which all the plant species previously encountered by [[James Cook]] on the [[Kerguelen Islands]] were collected. On 16 August they reached the [[River Derwent (Tasmania)|River Derwent]], remaining in Tasmania until 12 November. A week later the flotilla stopped at [[Auckland Islands|Lord Auckland's Islands]] and [[Campbell Island group|Campbell's Island]] for the spring months.

Large floating forests of ''Macrocystis'' and ''[[Durvillaea]]'' were found until the ships ran into icebergs at latitude 61° S. [[Drift ice|Pack-ice]] was met at 68° S and longitude 175°. During this part of the voyage [[Victoria Land]], [[Mount Erebus]] and [[Mount Terror (Antarctica)|Mount Terror]] were discovered. After returning to Tasmania for three months, the flotilla went via Sydney to the [[Bay of Islands]], and stayed for three months in New Zealand to collect plants there. After visiting other islands, the ships returned to the Cape of Good Hope on 4 April 1843. At the end of the journey specimens of some fifteen hundred plant species had been collected and preserved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=J.D.

'''Friedrich Carl von Savigny''' (21 February 1779 – 25 October 1861) was a German [[jurist]] and [[History of Germany|historian]].

==Early life and education==
Savigny was born at [[Frankfurt]], of a family recorded in the history of [[Lorraine (province)|Lorraine]], deriving its name from the castle of Savigny near [[Charmes-la-Côte|Charmes]] in the valley of the [[Moselle]]. Left an orphan at the age of 13, Savigny was brought up by a guardian until, in 1795, he entered the [[University of Marburg]], where, though in poor health, he studied under Professors [[Anton Bauer (jurist)|Anton Bauer]] and [[Philipp Friedrich Weiss]], the former a pioneer in the reform of the German criminal law, the latter distinguished for his knowledge of medieval jurisprudence. After the fashion of German students, Savigny visited several universities, notably [[university of Jena|Jena]], [[university of Leipzig|Leipzig]] and [[university of Halle|Halle]]; and returning to Marburg, took his doctor's degree in 1800. At Marburg he lectured as ''[[Privatdozent]]'' on criminal law and the [[Pandects]].

==Work==
In 1803 Savigny published ''Das Recht des Besitzes'' ("The Law of Possession").&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/dasrechtdesbesi00savigoog archive.org]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anton Friedrich Justus Thibaut|Anton Thibaut]] hailed it as a masterpiece which brought the old uncritical study of [[Roman law]] to an end. It quickly obtained a European reputation, and still remains a prominent landmark in the history of jurisprudence. In 1804 he married Kunigunde Brentano, sister of [[Bettina von Arnim]] and [[Clemens Brentano]] the poet. The same year he embarked on an extensive tour through France and south Germany in search of fresh sources of Roman law.

In 1808 Savigny was appointed full professor of Roman law at [[Landshut]]. He remained in this position for a year and a half. In 1810 he was appointed to the chair of Roman law at the new [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]], chiefly at the insistence of [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]]. Here, in connection with the faculty of law, he created a "Spruch-Collegium", an extraordinary tribunal competent to deliver opinions on cases remitted to it by the ordinary courts; and he took an active part in its labours. This was the busiest time of his life. He was engaged in lecturing, in the government of the university (of which he was the third rector), and as tutor to the crown prince in Roman, criminal and Prussian law. During his time in Berlin Savigny befriended [[Barthold Georg Niebuhr|Niebuhr]] and [[Karl Friedrich Eichhorn|Eichhorn]].

In 1814 Savigny wrote the pamphlet ''{{lang|de|Vom Beruf unserer Zeit für Gesetzgebung und Rechtswissenschaft}}''. In an earlier pamphlet Thibaut had argued for the creation of a unified legal code for Germany, independent of the influence of foreign legal systems. Savigny argued that such a codification of the law would have an adverse effect. According to Savigny the damage which had been caused by the neglect of former generations of jurists could not be quickly repaired, and more time was required to set the house in order. Moreover, a unified legal code would almost certainly be influenced by natural law, with its "infinite arrogance" and its "shallow philosophy". It was Savigny's opinion that jurisprudence should be saved from the ''hollow abstractions'' of such a work as the ''{{lang|la|Institutiones juris naturae et gentium}}'' of [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]]. Savigny opposed this conception of jurisprudence to the ''historical study of the positive law'', which, according to him, is ''a condition precedent to the right understanding of the science of all law''. However, Savigny did not oppose to the introduction of new laws or of a new system of laws.

In 1815 Savigny, together with [[Karl Friedrich Eichhorn]] and [[Johann Friedrich Ludwig Göschen]], founded the ''{{lang|de|Zeitschrift für geschichtliche Rechtswissenschaft}}'' ("Journal of Historical Legal Studies"), the organ of the [[German Historical School|new historical school]]. In this periodical (vol. iii. p.&amp;nbsp;129 seq.) Savigny made known to the world the discovery by [[Barthold Georg Niebuhr|Niebuhr]] at [[Verona, Italy|Verona]] of the lost text of [[Gaius (jurist)|Gaius]]. Savigny pronounced it to be the work of Gaius himself and not, as [[Barthold Georg Niebuhr|Niebuhr]] suggested, of [[Ulpian]].

The same year, 1815, Savigny published the first volume of his ''{{lang|de|Geschichte des römischen Rechts im Mittelalter}}'' ("History of Roman Law in the Middle Ages"),&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb__UYbAAAAYAAJ ''Geschichte des römischen Rechts im Mittelalter'', erster Band]&lt;/ref&gt; the sixth and final volume of which did not appear until 1831. He had been prompted to write this work by his early instructor Weiss. Savigny intended it to be a literary history of Roman law from [[Irnerius]] to the present time. His design was in some respect narrowed; in others it was widened. He did not continue the narrative beyond the 16th century, when the separation of nationalities disturbed the foundations of the science of law. In the first volume, Savigny treated the history of Roman law from the breaking up of the empire until the beginning of the 12th century. According to Savigny, Roman law, although considered dead, lived on in local customs, in towns, in ecclesiastical doctrines and school teachings, until it once again reappeared in [[Bologna]] and other Italian cities.

In 1817 Savigny was appointed a member of the commission for organizing the [[Prussia]]n provincial estates, and also a member of the department of justice in the ''{{lang|de|Staatsrath}}'' (State Council). In 1819 he became a member of the supreme court of appeal for the Rhine Provinces. In 1820 he was made a member of the commission for revising the Prussian code. In 1822 he was afflicted with nervous illness, which compelled him to seek relief in travel. In 1835 Savigny began his elaborate work on contemporary Roman law, ''{{lang|de|System des heutigen römischen Rechts}}'' (8 vols., 1840–1849). His activity as professor ceased in March 1842, when he was appointed "{{lang|de|Grosskanzler}}" (High Chancellor), the official at the head of the juridical system in Prussia. In this position he carried out several important law reforms in regard to bills of exchange and divorce. He held the office until 1848, when he resigned.

In 1850, on the occasion of the jubilee of obtaining his doctor's degree, appeared in five volumes his ''Vermischte Schriften'', consisting of a collection of minor works published between 1800 and 1844. Savigny was hailed throughout Germany as "the great master" and founder of modern jurisprudence. In 1851 and 1853 he published the two volumes of his treatise on the law of obligations, ''{{lang|de|Das Obligationenrecht}}'', mostly on what English-speaking lawyers consider as contract law. It was a supplement to his work on modern Roman law, in which he again argued for the necessity of the historical treatment of law.

Savigny died at Berlin. His son, [[Karl Friedrich von Savigny]] (1814–1875), was Prussian minister of foreign affairs in 1849. He represented Prussia in important diplomatic transactions, especially in 1866.

==Ideas and Influence==
{{Conservatism sidebar |People}}

Savigny belongs to the German [[German Historical School|historical school of jurists]], founded by [[Gustav Hugo]], and served a role in its consolidation. The works for which Savigny is best known are the ''Recht des Besitzes'' and the ''Beruf unserer Zeit für Gesetzgebung''. According to [[Rudolf von Jhering|Jhering]] "with the Recht des Besitzes the juridical method of the Romans was regained, and modern jurisprudence born." It was seen as a great advance both in results and method, and rendered obsolete a large body of literature. Savigny argued that in Roman law possession had always reference to "usucapion" or to "interdicts". It did not include a right to continuance in possession but only to immunity from interference as possession is based on the consciousness of unlimited power. These and other propositions were derived by the interpretation and harmonization of the Roman jurists. However, many of Savigny's conclusions did not meet with universal acclaim. They were opposed by, among others, [[Rudolf von Jhering|Jhering]], [[Eduard Gans|Gans]], and Bruns.

Savigny argued in the ''Beruf unserer Zeit'' that law is part and parcel of national life. He opposed the idea, common to French 18th century jurists and Bentham, that law can be arbitrarily imposed on a country irrespective of its state of civilization and history. Another important idea of Savigny is that the practice and theory of [[jurisprudence]] cannot be divorced without injury to both.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2370">'''Gedolim pictures''' are photos or sketches of (or attributed to) famous [[rabbi]]s, known as [[Gadol|gedolim]] admired by Jews. 

It is a cultural phenomenon found largely in the [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] and [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] Jewish communities. Gedolim pictures are pictures of famous rabbis and other prominent Jews which are circulated amongst the Jewish communities. Quite frequently, these pictures are posted on the walls of offices, businesses, houses, and schools where Jews are present. 

Collecting Gedolim pictures has developed into a hobby for many Jewish children around the world; it is similar to collecting [[sports cards]].

'''The Glasgow Filmmakers Alliance''' (GFA) is an online directory listing individuals and companies who are associated with film and television production in and around the city of Glasgow in Scotland. It was founded in 2011 by Scottish actor [[Andrew O'Donnell]] and [[Chris Quick]], a Scottish film editor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glasgowfilm.co.uk Glasgow Filmmakers Alliance Info Column]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The idea of the directory came about during the filming of ''[[In Search of La Che]]'' when Quick felt there was no central place to find professional talent both in front and behind the camera.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moviescramble.co.uk/2014/08/27/chris-quick-part-2/ Movies Scramble: An Interview with Chris Quick Part 2]&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after filming finished, he discussed the idea with O'Donnell and the pair launched what would become the Glasgow Filmmakers Alliacne on 31 October 2011.

In 2012, the alliance was invited by Stephen Paton of Production Attic to form what would become the Glasgow Creative Network which hosts networking events for media professionals in Glasgow.

A supporter of independent film, Quick led a campaign to get the [[British Academy Scotland New Talent Awards]] recognised by IMDB stating that 'they represented the best of emerging Scottish talent'. The campaign was successful and the awards were introduced to the site later that year. He later repeated this success with the inclusion of the Virgin Media Short Awards after the first double win by Scottish director [[John McPhail (director)|John McPhail]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4109795/bio?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm Chris Quick IMDB Biography &amp; Trivia]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hdwarrior.co.uk/2014/10/28/hoping-for-new-categories-at-bafta-scotland/ HD Warrior Blog]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Quick and O'Donnell wrote an open letter on behalf of the independent filmmakers of Glasgow to the director of [[BAFTA Scotland]], Jude MacLaverty. In the letter, the pair asked the film body to consider a proposal of including three new awards at the annual ceremony aimed at low budget / independent filmmakers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glasgowfilm.co.uk/GFA%20Open%20Letter%20to%20BAFTA.pdf Glasgow Filmmakers Alliance Open Letter to Bafta Scotland] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924022410/http://www.glasgowfilm.co.uk/GFA%20Open%20Letter%20to%20BAFTA.pdf |date=24 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 October it was announced that the proposal would be placed on the agenda of the next Bafta Scotland Committee meeting in December 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allmediascotland.com/media-releases/73816/media-release-glasgow-filmmakers-alliance-hoping-for-awards-proposal-success/ Glasgow Filmmakers Alliance Media Release]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.pressreader.com/uk/evening-times/20141031 | title=Filmmakers in awards category call | date=31 October 2014 | accessdate=31 October 2014 | work=Glasgow Evening Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 April 2015, the BAFTA Scotland committee released their response to the proposals put forward by the Glasgow Filmmakers Alliance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glasgowfilm.co.uk/BAFTA_GFA_Response_Letter.pdf BAFTA Scotland response to Glasgow Filmmakers Alliance Proposals]&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2017, O'Donnell and Quick both signed the open letter to the Arts Council, England, objecting to the organisations decision not to renew the visa for American born actor [[Tyler Collins (actor)|Tyler Collins]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://bellacaledonia.org.uk/2017/03/18/open-letter-to-arts-council-england/ Open Letter to English Arts Council]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film funding==
The alliance has financially contributed small amounts to various films in and around Glasgow.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.indiegogo.com/individuals/358934/campaigns Glasgow Filmmakers Alliance Indiegogo Profile]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/glasgowfilm Glasgow Filmmakers Alliance Kickstarter Profile]&lt;/ref&gt; Below is a list of some projects it has supported.

(See: Bowling, 2002)  He wrote this name on his [http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.gmd/g3850.ct000512 "Plan of the city intended for the permanent seat of the government of t(he) United States ...."] (Washington, D.C.) and on other legal documents. However, during the early 1900s, a French ambassador to the U.S., [[Jean Jules Jusserand]], popularized the use of L'Enfant's birth name, "Pierre Charles L'Enfant". (See: Bowling (2002).) The [[National Park Service]] has identified L'Enfant as [https://web.archive.org/web/20140405134623/http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/travel/Wash/text.htm "Major Peter Charles L'Enfant"] and as [https://web.archive.org/web/20100228094032/http://www.nps.gov/history/Nr/travel/presidents/washington_monument.html "Major Pierre (Peter) Charles L'Enfant"]  in its histories of the [[Washington Monument]] on its website. The [[United States Code]] states in {{USC|40|3309}}: "(a) In General.&amp;mdash;The purposes of this chapter shall be carried out in the District of Columbia as nearly as may be practicable in harmony with the plan of Peter Charles L'Enfant."&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{further|History of Washington, D.C.#Founding}}

Major L'Enfant was a French engineer who served in the [[Continental Army]] during the [[American Revolutionary War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/travel/wash/lenfant.htm|title=The L'Enfant and McMillan Plans|work=Washington, D.C., A National Register of Historic Places Travel Inventory|publisher=[[National Park Service]]|accessdate=2011-01-08|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101028221822/http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/travel/wash/lenfant.htm|archivedate=2010-10-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1789, discussions were underway regarding a new federal capital city for the [[United States]], and L'Enfant wrote to President Washington asking to be commissioned to plan the city. However, any decision on the capital was put on hold until July 1790 when [[United States Congress|Congress]] passed the [[Residence Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Reps|first=John William|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ES4m9SedVZkC&amp;pg=PA240#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Making of Urban America|chapter=9.

The Residence Act gave authority to President Washington to appoint three commissioners to oversee the survey of the federal district and provide public buildings to accommodate the Federal government in 1800.&lt;ref name="residenceact"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://memory.loc.gov/ll/llsl/001/0200/02540130.tif|title=An ACT for establishing the Temporary and Permanent Seat of the Government of the United States|work=American Memory|publisher=Library of Congress|accessdate=2017-04-04|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170404131445/http://memory.loc.gov/ll/llsl/001/0200/02540130.tif|archivedate=2017-04-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ellis|first=Joseph J.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lsPztgGkYYgC&amp;pg=PA50#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Founding Brothers: The Revolutionary Generation|chapter=The Dinner|publisher=Vintage|year=2002|isbn=0-375-70524-4|pages=50–52|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160426042659/https://books.google.com/books?id=lsPztgGkYYgC&amp;pg=PA50#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|archivedate=2016-04-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

President Washington appointed L'Enfant in 1791 to plan the new "Federal City", under the supervision of three commissioners whom Washington appointed to oversee the planning and development of the territory that became the [[History of Washington, D.C.|"District of Columbia"]].

The Plan also proposed the erection of an "historic Column" that would be located within an open space (now the site of [[Lincoln Park (Washington, D.C.)|Lincoln Park]]) at the intersection of several streets and avenues that would be one mile east of the Congress House. The column would contain the point from which "all distances of places through the Continent, are to be calculated".&lt;ref name=computerized/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pohl|first=Robert|title=Lost Capitol Hill: The Zero Milestone|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160315020141/http://www.thehillishome.com/2009/11/lost-capitol-hill-the-zero-milestone/|archivedate=2016-03-15 |url=http://www.thehillishome.com/2009/11/lost-capitol-hill-the-zero-milestone/|accessdate=2017-04-14|newspaper=The Hill is Home|date=2009-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

L'Enfant's plan additionally laid out a system of canals (later designated as the [[Washington City Canal]]) that would pass the "Congress House" and the "President's House". One branch of the canal would empty into the Potomac River south of the "President's House" at the mouth of Tiber Creek, which would be channelized and straightened. The other branch of the canal would divide and empty into the Eastern Branch at two separate points near the Eastern Branch's confluence with the Potomac River.&lt;ref name=computerized /&gt;&lt;ref name="L'Enfant34" /&gt;&lt;ref name="High resolution image" /&gt; The scale and complexity of the canals in the 1791-92 plan and its revisions suggested the importance of the canals within the grand design of the city, with important structures located along its banks – the proposed National Pantheon, [[Judiciary Square]], a market/exchange complex, a national bank and theater, as well as a grand church complex.&lt;ref name=Robinson12/&gt;

==Manuscripts and copies of the Plan==
In a paper published in 1899, John Stewart, who was in charge of records in the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|United States Army Engineers]]' Office of Public Buildings and Grounds,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=GgULOzNSafMC&amp;&amp;pg=PA27#v=onepage&amp;q=Stewart&amp;f=false Steward, p. 27] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170401150433/https://books.google.com/books?id=GgULOzNSafMC&amp;&amp;pg=PA27 |date=2017-04-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; wrote that President Washington had sent one of L'Enfant's handwritten plans to Congress on December 13, 1791.&lt;ref name=Steward54&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=GgULOzNSafMC&amp;&amp;pg=PA54#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Stewart, p. 54] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170401144457/https://books.google.com/books?id=GgULOzNSafMC&amp;&amp;pg=PA54 |date=2017-04-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Stewart wrote that L'Enfant had sent this plan to the President on August 19, 1791, and had also prepared a larger exact copy.&lt;ref name=Steward54 /&gt; Stewart stated that surveyors had used the copy to lay out the city's streets and that L'Enfant had employed a Philadelphia architect to draft a copy of the larger version for L'Enfant's own use.&lt;ref name=Steward52&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=GgULOzNSafMC&amp;&amp;pg=PA52#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Stewart, pp. 52–53] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170401064625/https://books.google.com/books?id=GgULOzNSafMC&amp;&amp;pg=PA52 |date=2017-04-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stewart also wrote that President Washington had in December 1796 sent to the Commissioners a plan of the city that had contained penciled directions from Thomas Jefferson that identified those parts of the plan that the plan's engravers should omit.&lt;ref name=Stewart62&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=GgULOzNSafMC&amp;&amp;pg=PA62#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Stewart, p. 62.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170401055410/https://books.google.com/books?id=GgULOzNSafMC&amp;&amp;pg=PA62 |date=2017-04-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stewart stated that he had discovered that plan in the Commissioners' office in 1873.&lt;ref name=Stewart62 /&gt; He reported that the plan was still in that office in 1898.&lt;ref name=Stewart62 /&gt;

During 1882, Stewart had been in charge of records that the Office of the United States Commissioner of Public Buildings was holding. In that year, he created a black and white copy of several portions of a manuscript plan of the federal capital city.&lt;ref name=Stewart2&gt;{{cite web|last=L'Enfant|first=Peter Charles |url=http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.gmd/g3850.ct004357|title=Plan of the city intended for the permanent seat of the government of t(he) United States : projected agreeable to the direction of the President of the United States, in pursuance of an act of Congress passed the sixteenth day of July, MDCCXC, "establishing the permanent seat on the bank of the Potowmac": (Washington, D.C.)|work=Facsimile of the L'Enfant plan showing part of the street system of the original created/published: Washington: Office of the Commissioner of Public Buildings, [1882]|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]|year=1791|lccn=88694202|accessdate=2016-01-26|quote=I certify that this is a true copy of the original in this office, John Stewart, civil engineer in charge of records, 10th Oct'r 1882.}} ''In'' Repository of the [[Library of Congress]] Geography and Map Division, Washington, D.C.&lt;/ref&gt; The last line in an oval in the upper left corner of Stewart's reproduction contains the words "Peter Charles L'Enfant", which are written in a script and alignment that are similar to those in the line that precedes it.&lt;ref name=Stewart2 /&gt; Stewart certified that "this is a true copy of the original in this office".&lt;ref name=Stewart2 /&gt;

Five years later, in 1887, the [[U.S. National Geodetic Survey|United States Coast and Geodetic Survey]] prepared  a colored tracing of a manuscript plan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nmaahceis.si.edu/documents/Final_Historic_Preservation_Report.pdf Robinson &amp; Associates] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180312192250/http://nmaahceis.si.edu/documents/Final_Historic_Preservation_Report.pdf |date=2018-03-12 }}, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Martin&gt;{{cite web|last=L'Enfant|first=Peter Charles|url=http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.gmd/g3850.ct000512|title=Plan of the city intended for the permanent seat of the government of t(he) United States : projected agreeable to the direction of the President of the United States, in pursuance of an act of Congress passed the sixteenth day of July, MDCCXC, "establishing the permanent seat on the bank of the Potowmac": (Washington, D.C.)|work=Photocopy of a facsimile of the 1791 L'Enfant Plan created by U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey, Washington, D.C.

''In'': Repository of the [[Library of Congress]] Geography and Map Division, Washington, D.C.&lt;/ref&gt; which together enabled the Plan to be widely distributed for the first time. The printers added to each of the reproduced tracings a copy of a message that a survey assistant had sent to the survey's superintendent.&lt;ref name=facsimile /&gt;&lt;ref name=facsimile2 /&gt; The message stated that the Acting [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]] had directed that the tracing be produced for the purposes of preservation and reproduction.&lt;ref name=facsimile /&gt;&lt;ref name=facsimile2 /&gt;  The message further stated that the Plan's original manuscript was in a dilapidated state and had earlier been mounted on cotton cloth and varnished for preservation, rendering the manuscript "quite opaque".&lt;ref name=facsimile /&gt;&lt;ref name=facsimile2 /&gt;

The survey assistant's message additionally contained a synopsis of letters requesting the tracing that a Special Assistant Attorney for the United States, the [[United States Attorney for the District of Columbia]], the [[United States Attorney General]], the Acting Secretary of the Treasury and the [[United States Secretary of War]] had written.&lt;ref name=facsimile /&gt;&lt;ref name=facsimile2 /&gt; The Assistant Attorney's letter stated that pending litigation had necessitated the plan's reproduction to enable the [[Federal government of the United States|United States Government]] to establish title of the Government to the Potomac Flats.&lt;ref name=facsimile /&gt;&lt;ref name=facsimile2 /&gt;

The Assistant Attorney's letter further stated that an office of the U.S. Army's Engineer Corps that was in charge of Public Buildings and Grounds was holding the original plan, which had become so indistinct that it could not be accurately photographed.&lt;ref name=facsimile /&gt;&lt;ref name=facsimile2 /&gt; Several of the letter writers asked the Survey to return the original manuscript plan to the War Department after the Survey had reproduced it.&lt;ref name=facsimile /&gt;&lt;ref name=facsimile2 /&gt;

In 1930, the chief of the Division of Maps at the Library of Congress compared the wording in one of reproduced tracings to the wording in an annex to a plan of the City of Washington  which, according to a January 1792 publication,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New City of Washington|work=Gazette of the United States |location=Philadelphia|date=1792-01-04|quote=The following description is annexed to the Plan of the City of Washington, in the District of Columbia, as sent to Congress by the President some days ago. ...}}&lt;/ref&gt; President Washington had recently sent to Congress and which contained the words "By Peter Charles L'Enfant".&lt;ref name=Martin /&gt; The librarian concluded that the two maps were not the same.&lt;ref name=Martin /&gt;

A Library of Congress web page states that, on November 11, 1918, a map that L'Enfant had prepared was presented to the Library of Congress for safekeeping.&lt;ref name=treasures&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170205200453/http://www.loc.gov/exhibits/treasures/tri001.html|archivedate=2017-02-05|url=https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/treasures/tri001.html|title=Original Plan of Washington, D.C.|work=American Treasures of the [[Library of Congress]]: Imagination: Pierre Charles L'Enfant's 1791 "''Plan of the city intended for the permanent seat of the government ....''": Manuscript map on paper, 1791, Geography &amp; Map Division |publisher=Library of Congress|date=2010-07-29|accessdate=2017-03-05|quote=Selected by Washington to prepare a ground plan for the new city, L'Enfant arrived in Georgetown on March 9, 1791, and submitted his report and plan to the president about August 26, 1791.

One hundred and twenty-two years later, on November 11, 1918, the map was presented to the Library of Congress for safekeeping.}}&lt;br /&gt;Note: The plan that this web page describes identifies the plan's author as "Peter Charles L'Enfant". The web page nevertheless identifies the author as "Pierre-Charles L'Enfant."&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1930 report to the [[National Capital Planning Commission|National Capital Park and Planning Commission]], William Partridge described the features and history of that map, as well as the changes that Andrew Ellicott had apparently made to the map.&lt;ref&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiug.30112106620468;view=1up;seq=27;size=125 Partridge]&lt;/ref&gt;

Partridge noted that L'Enfant had written that all of his drawings had been seized in December 1791, but that only one, a plan for the city of Washington, had been recovered.&lt;ref&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiug.30112106620468;view=1up;seq=32 Partridge, p. 24] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170408185722/https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiug.30112106620468 |date=2017-04-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He further stated that although L'Enfant had produced a number of versions of his plan, only one (an intermediate version) was still known to exist. Partridge concluded that the origin of that plan, which the Library of Congress was holding, was still in doubt.&lt;ref&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiug.30112106620468;view=1up;seq=28;size=125 Partridge, p. 22] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170408185722/https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiug.30112106620468 |date=2017-04-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; That plan, which the Library now holds in its Geography and Map Division,&lt;ref name=treasures /&gt; is still the only map of the capital city bearing L'Enfant's name that is widely known.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2284">[[Image:Dictionarium trium lingvarum.jpg|171 px|thumb|First Lithuanian language dictionary]]
'''Lithuanian dictionaries''', i.e., [[dictionaries]] of [[Lithuanian language]] have been printed since the first half of the 17th century.

==History==
The first [[Lithuanian language]] dictionary was compiled by [[Konstantinas Sirvydas]] and printed in 1629 as a trilingual (Polish–Latin–Lithuanian) dictionary. Five editions of it were printed until 1713, but it was used and copied by other lexicographers until the 19th century.&lt;ref name=LIT&gt;[http://www.lituanus.org/1981_4/81_4_01.htm "Kazimieras Būga and the Academic Dictionary of Lithuanian"], by [[:lt:Antanas Klimas|Antanas Klimas]], ''[[Lituanus]]'', vol. 27, no.4, 1981&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EL&gt;[http://www.spaudos.lt/LietKalba/Dictionaries.en.htm "Dictionaries" article from ''[[Encyclopedia Lituanica]]''], based on the article from ''Lituanus''&lt;/ref&gt;

The first German–Lithuanian–German dictionary, to address the necessities of [[Lithuania Minor]] was published by Friedrich W. Haack in 1730.&lt;ref name=LIT/&gt; A better German–Lithuanian–German dictionary, with a sketch of grammar and history of the language, more words, and systematic orthography, was published by [[Philipp Ruhig]] in 1747.&lt;ref name=LIT/&gt; In 1800, {{ill|Christian Gottlieb Mielcke|lt|Kristijonas Gotlybas Milkus}} printed an expanded and revised version of Ruhig's dictionary. Its foreword was the last work of [[Immanuel Kant]] printed during his life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/webworld/mdm/visite/vilnius/knygos/fondas/milke/anglu/emmilke.htm Mielcke's Lithuanian dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;

There also existed a number of notable unpublished dictionaries.

At the beginning of the 19th century linguists recognized the preserved archaic character of Lithuanian, and it came into the focus of the [[comparative linguistics]] of [[Indo-European languages]]. To address the needs of linguists, [[Georg H. F. Nesselmann]] published a Lithuanian–German dictionary in 1851.&lt;ref name=LIT/&gt;

The culmination of Lithuanian linguists' efforts is the 20-volume ''[[Academic Dictionary of Lithuanian]]''.&lt;ref name=EL/&gt;

An '''aegrotat''' ({{IPAc-en|'|iː|g|r|oʊ|t|æ|t|}}; {{etymology|la|aegrotat|he/she is ill}})&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''sick note''' is a type of medical certificate excusing a student's absence from school for reasons of [[illness]].

==Purpose and applications==
Medical certificates are sometimes required to obtain certain [[Health insurance|health benefits]] from an employer, to make an insurance [[Cause of action|claim]], for tax purposes, or for certain legal procedures. Medical certificates are used to indicate eligibility of activity, such as the use of [[Disabled parking permit|disabled parking]]. Medical certificates can also be used to describe a medical condition a person has, such as blindness. Medical certificates are often used to certify that someone is free of [[Infection|contagious diseases]], [[Substance dependence|drug addiction]], [[Mental disorder|mental illness]], or other health issues.

Health criteria are often required when making an application for something, such as an [[eye examination]] to get a driver's license. Other times medical criteria are presented voluntarily by an applicant in a self-assessment, without either a doctor or access to the person's [[medical record]]. Specific health criteria or medical history are required for certain jobs.

In the United States, most [[Aircraft pilot|aviators]] are required to possess a valid medical certificate that certifies sound health as part of the requirements for piloting an [[airplane]] or [[helicopter]].&lt;ref name="Pilot'sHandbook"&gt;{{cite book |title=Pilot's Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge |last=U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2009 |publisher=Government Printing Office |location= |isbn=0160823676 |page=16-2 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/?id=0l8WO6Drz50C&amp;pg=SA16-PA2&amp;dq=medical+certificate#v=onepage&amp;q=medical%20certificate&amp;f=false |access-date=February 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While airman certificates are issued for life, the medical certificate expires and must be renewed periodically in order continue flying privileges.  [[Pilot certification in the United States#Sport pilot|Sport pilots]] may use a valid state driver's license in place of a medical certificate, and [[Glider (aircraft)|glider]] and [[hot air balloon]] pilots are not required to obtain them.&lt;ref name="Pilot'sHandbook" /&gt;

==Aegrotat==
The term ''aegrotat'' (abbreviated as ''aegrot'') is used primarily in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. In the context of [[British undergraduate degree classification|British undergraduate degrees]] a student who is too ill to finish may be awarded an aegrotat degree if the student otherwise would have passed exams or other requirements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vuw.ac.nz/st_services/counselling/appointments/aegrotat-info.aspx A New Zealand university policy on aegrotat degrees]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact on occupation==
Except in certain unique circumstances, a holder of a medical certificate in the National Aeronautics and Space Administration may not "act as pilot in command or in any other capacity as a required flight crewmember of an aircraft".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/?id=7cg5AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA148&amp;dq=%22medical+certificate%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22medical%20certificate%22&amp;f=false | title = The Code of Federal Regulations of the United States of America | author1 = Staff | first1 = National Aeronautics and Space Administration | pages = 12 | year = 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A patient with conditions such as: measles, chicken-pox, hepatitis A, leprosy, typhoid fever, and whooping cough, can return to work immediately after their healing phase or medical tests. Almost always the patient may only be allowed to return to work upon submission of a medical certificate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M1HOA3sCXNkC&amp;pg=PA487&amp;dq=%22medical+certificate%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1sHvUOWGA4aiiAel5oCgCw&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22medical%20certificate%22&amp;f=false | title=Manual Of Community Nursing and Communicable Diseases | accessdate=January 11, 2013 | pages=487}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eligibility==
Sometimes, there are standards and procedures in place, for workers in a certain field to be eligible to receive a medical certificate. Any airman at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration must give their employees access to the National Driver Register. On top of this, other tests which are required for first-, second- and third-class airmen are: eye, ear/nose/throat/equilibrium, mental, neurologic, and cardiovascular.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/?id=7cg5AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA148&amp;dq=%22medical+certificate%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22medical%20certificate%22&amp;f=false | title = The Code of Federal Regulations of the United States of America | author1 = Staff | first1 = National Aeronautics and Space Administration | pages = 67 | year = 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The India List and India Office List 1905'' explains that officers on "Long Leave in Europe" must, among other things, provide a medical certificate, which is obtained at the Medical Board of India Office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3VQTAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA262&amp;dq=%22medical+certificate%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=o8HvUK_2GpDBiQfyr4GIDA&amp;ved=0CGMQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22medical%20certificate%22&amp;f=false | title=The India List and India Office List | accessdate=January 11, 2013 | pages=262}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Practical Guide to Employees' State Insurance Act, Rules and Regulations'' explains that under the ESI Act, the employee must obtain a medical certificate via the ESI Dispensary/Hospital, which then gets deposited at the nearest office of the ESI Corporation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=couYMu1aa5oC&amp;pg=PA275&amp;dq=%22medical+certificate%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=o8HvUK_2GpDBiQfyr4GIDA&amp;ved=0CGgQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22medical%20certificate%22&amp;f=false | title=Practical Guide to Employees' State Insurance Act, Rules and Regulations | accessdate=January 11, 2013 | pages=126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Falsification==
As many illnesses can come about suddenly, sometimes the worker will not have enough time to receive a medical certificate, or may be too sick to obtain one. In other cases, the worker may not be bothered to go to the trouble of getting one, or may be lying about their illness and want to falsify a certificate to back up their story to their boss.

There have been discussions regarding whether it is okay to fire someone for submitting a fabricated medical certificates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mk.com.au/publications/article/sacked-for-submitting-false-medical-certificates-fair | title=Sacked for Submitting False Medical Certificates - Fair? | accessdate=January 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases, it is deemed wrong, such as in Australia where a bank officer was dismissed after handing in a forged certificate, which prompted a Fair Work Australia Commissioner to say they had a "continued lack of regard for the truth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://blog.vecci.org.au/2012/02/16/employee-sacked-for-creating-false-medical-certificate/ | title=Employee sacked for creating false medical certificate | accessdate=January 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is a WA police officer who was stood down after committing the same offense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.watoday.com.au/wa-news/officer-stood-down-for-allegedly-forging-medical-certificate-20081218-713y.html | title=Officer stood down for allegedly forging medical certificate| date=December 18, 2008 | accessdate=January 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes it is not so black and white. In one case, a woman claimed she was "coerced into falsifying [a] medical certificate [which ultimately led to her being fired] because she was 'being bullied and treated unfairly' by two managers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://aworkcovervictimsdiary.com/2012/09/sacked-worker-forged-medical-certificate-claimed-nearly-died-way-treated/ | title=Sacked worker forged medical certificate and claimed she nearly died because the way she was treated | accessdate=January 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are some companies that sell fake medical certificates. Although the site ''Doctors Note Store'' sells "fake sick notes and medical certificates for workers in Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom", they add that the "fakes are for 'novelty use only'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.workplaceinfo.com.au/payroll/leave/ama-warns-over-fake-sick-notes | title=AMA warns over fake sick notes | accessdate=January 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At Flinders University, "providing a forged medical certificate" is viewed as academic misconduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.flinders.edu.au/current-students/policies-procs/rights/important-changes.cfm | title=Important Changes to the University’s Student Policies and Procedures | accessdate=January 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In New South Wales, medical professionals who "deliberately issue a false, misleading or inaccurate certificate" can be charged under the Medical Practice Act. This is in response to The New South Wales Medical Board "receiving numerous complaints from employers, insurers, the courts, etc regarding the quality, accuracy and truthfulness of sickness certificates".&lt;ref name="MCP"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mcnsw.org.au/page/old-policies/medical-certificates-policy/ | title=Medical Certificates Policy | page = 67 |accessdate=January 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Validation==
In order to prove that one's medical certificate is authentic, the following should be done and taken into consideration:&lt;ref name="MCP"/&gt;

[[File:Magic_circle,_fifteenth-century_manuscript.jpg|thumb|right|A [[magic circle]] in a fifteenth-century manuscript]]

During the '''Middle Ages magic in Europe''' took on many forms. Instead of being able to identify one type of magician, there were many who practiced several types of magic in these times, including: monks, priests, physicians, surgeons, midwives, folk healers, and diviners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Flint|first1=Valerie I. J.|title=The Rise of Magic in Early Medieval Europe|date=1991|publisher=Clarendon Press|isbn=0198205228}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of “magic”  often consisted of using medicinal herbs for healing purposes. Classical medicine entailed magical elements, they would use charms or potions in hopes of driving out a sickness. 

== Medieval Magic ==

=== Medical Magic ===

Medicinal practices in the Middle Ages were often regarded as forms of “[[natural magic]]”{{cn|date=May 2017}}. One in particular was referred to as a “leechbook”, or a doctor-book that included masses to be said over the healing herbs. For example, a procedure for curing skin disease first involves an ordinary herbal medicine followed by strict instructions to draw blood from the neck of the ill, pour it into running water, spit three times and recite a sort of spell to complete the cure. In addition to the leechbook, the [[Lacnunga]] included many prescriptions derived from the European folk culture that more intensely involved magic{{or|date=May 2017}}. The Lacnunga prescribed a set of Christian prayers to be said over the ingredients used to make the medicine, and such ingredients were to be mixed by straws with the names “Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John” inscribed on them. In order for the cure to work, several [[Spell (paranormal)|charms]] had to be sung in Latin over the medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kieckhefer|first1=Richard|title=Magic in the Middle Ages|date=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge (UK)|isbn=978-0-521-78576-1|edition=Canto}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Charms===

[[Prayers]], [[blessing]]s, and adjurations were all common forms of verbal formulas whose intentions were hard to distinguish between the magical and the religious{{cn|date=May 2017}}. Prayers were typically requests directed to a holy figure such as God, a saint, [[Christ]], or [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]]. Blessings more often were addressed to patients, and came in the form of wishes for good fortune. Adjurations, also known as exorcisms were more directed to either a sickness, or the agent responsible such as a worm, [[demon]], or elf{{cn|date=May 2017}}. While these three verbal formulas may have had religious intentions, they often played a role in magical practices. When the emphasis of a prayer so apparently relied on the observance of religiously irrelevant conditions, we can characterize it as magical{{or|date=May 2017}}. Blessings were more often than not strictly religious as well, unless they were used alongside magic or in a magical context. However, adjurations required closer scrutiny, as their formulas were generally derived from [[folklore]]{{or|date=May 2017}}. The command targeted at the sickness or evil left the possibility of refusal, meaning the healer entered a battle with the devil in which he or she relied on a holy power to come to his/her aid{{cn|date=May 2017}}. Though people at this age were less concerned with whether or not these verbal formulas involved magic or not, but rather with the reality of if they were or were not successful.{{or|date=May 2017}}

=== Sorcery ===

Not only was it difficult to make the distinction between the magical and religious {{or|date=July 2017}}, but what was even more challenging was to distinguish between helpful (white) magic from harmful (black) magic. Medical magic and protective magic were regarded as helpful, and called ‘white’, while [[Maleficium (sorcery)|sorcery]] was considered evil and ‘black’. Distinguishing between [[black magic]] and [[white magic]] often relied on perspective, for example, if a healer attempted to cure a patient and failed, some would accuse the healer of intentionally harming the patient. In this era, magic was only punished if it was deemed to be ‘black’, meaning it was the practice of a [[Magician (paranormal)|sorcerer]] with harmful intentions &lt;ref name="autogenerated1989"&gt;Kieckhefer, Richard (1989). Magic in the Middle Ages. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-521-78576-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early Opposition to Magic ==

One of the main reasons magic was condemned was because those who practiced it put themselves at risk of physical and spiritual assault from the demons they sought to control. However, the overarching concern of magical practices was the grievous harm it could do to others. Magic represented a huge threat to an age that widely professed belief in religion and holy powers.

=== Legal Prohibitions of Magic ===

Legislation against magic could be one of two types, either by [[secular]] authorities or by the Church. The penalties assigned by secular law typically included execution, but were more severe based on the impact of the magic, as people were less concerned with the means of magic, and more concerned with its effects on others. The penalties by the Church often required [[penance]] for the sin of magic, or in harsher cases could [[excommunicate]] the accused under the circumstances that the work of magic was a direct offense against God. The distinction between these punishments, secular versus the Church, were not absolute as many of the laws enacted by both parties were derived from the other &lt;ref name="autogenerated1989"/&gt;

The persecution of magic can be seen in law codes dating back to the 6th century, where the Germanic code of [[Visigoths]] condemned sorcerers who cursed the crops and animals of peasant’s enemies. In terms of secular legislation, Charles the Great ([[Charlemagne]]) was arguably the strongest opposing force to magic. He declared that all who practiced sorcery or divination would become slaves to the Church, and all those who sacrificed to the Devil or [[Germanic gods]] would be executed.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1989"/&gt;

Charlemagne’s objection to magic carried over into later years, as many rulers built on his early prohibitions. King Roger II of Sicily punished the use of poisons by death, whether natural or magical. Additionally, he proclaimed that ‘[[love magic]]’ be punished regardless of if anyone was hurt or not. However, secular rulers were still more concerned with the actual damage of the magic rather than the means of its infliction.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1989"/&gt;

Instructions issued in 800 at a synod in [[Freising]] provide general outlines for [[ecclesiastical]] hearings. The document states that those accused of some type of sorcery were to be examined by the [[archpriest]] of the diocese in hopes of prompting a confession. [[Torture]] was used if necessary, and the accused were often sentenced to prison until they resolved to do penance for their sins.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1989"/&gt;

=== Prosecution in the Early Middle Ages ===

Important political figures were the most frequently known characters in trials against magic, whether defendants, accusers, or victims. This was because high-society trials were more likely to be recorded as opposed to trials involving ordinary townspeople or villagers. For example, [[Gregory of Tours]] recorded the accusations of magic at the royal court of 6th century [[Gaul]]. According to [[Historia Francorum|History of the Franks]], two people were executed for supposedly bewitching [[emperor Arnulf]] and prompting the stroke that lead to his death.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1989"/&gt;

== Magic in the Later Middle Ages ==

The concept of magic was further developed in the high and [[late Middle Ages]]. The rise of legal commentaries and consultations during this time lead to the inclusion of law in Universities’ curricula. This fueled a detailed reflection of the principles underlying prosecution for magic. The early fourteenth century brought about the pinnacle of trials involving magic. In this time, several individuals were charged with using magic against both [[Pope John XXII]] and the King of France. These trials only enhanced the already growing concern about magic, and thus perpetuated the increasing severity of punishments for such actions. 
The increase in trials in the late Middle Ages was also in part due to the shift from accusatory to [[inquisitorial]] procedures. In accusatory procedures, the accuser had to provide ample evidence to prove the guilt of the accused. If the accuser failed to do so, or did not have any proof, he or she would have to face the punishment that would have been assigned to the accused had he/she been found guilty. The inquisitorial procedure allowed judges to undertake prosecution on their own initiative without consequences. This made it easier for the accuser to secure conviction for sorcery, and not have to worry about having insufficient evidence thus putting their own innocence in jeopardy. Inquisitorial interrogation took many forms, including experiments with reflecting surfaces, invocation of demons, use of human heads to obtain love or hatred, and more.

Another possible reason for the rise in frequency of trials regarding magic in the later fourteenth century was due to a change from parchment to a cheaper medium of paper. This made it cheaper for more information to be recorded and preserved, therefore we have a greater volume of documented information from this era. While this may have caused a slight increase in trials against magic, the main reason was in fact the new inquisitorial procedure of trial and prosecution as mentioned above.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1989"/&gt;

=== The Rise of Witch Trials ===

The fourteenth century already brought about an increase of [[Maleficium (sorcery)|sorcery]] trials, however the second and third quarters of the fifteenth century were known for the most dramatic uprising of trials involving witchcraft. The trials developed into catch-all prosecution, in which townspeople were encouraged to seek out as many suspects as possible. The goal was no longer to secure [[justice]] against a single offender but rather to purge the community of all transgressors. The term “witchcraft” has multiple connotations, all involving some type of sorcery or magic. However, by the late Middle Ages this term developed into someone who went beyond mere sorcery and acted in league with other witches on behalf of the [[Devil]]. [[Friars]] preached that not only are the witches who work for the devil guilty, but also all those who fail to report these culprits. This led to an outbreak of accusations, in fear of being accused themselves. Trials inspired more trials, and this increase in trials inspired the rise in the frequency of literature on witches. The famed culmination of this [[literary]] tradition was the Malleus maleficarum written in 1486 by Jacob Sprenger and Henry Kramer. This classic case of misogynist witchcraft treatise and its impact on magic in the Middle Ages will be explored later in this article. The growing popularity of literature regarding witchcraft and magic lead to an even greater upsurge in trials and prosecutions of witches.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;Pavlac, Brian (2009). Witch Hunts in the Western World: Persecution and Punishment from the Inquisition through the Salem Trials: Persecution and Punishment from the Inquisition through the Salem Trials. ABC-CLIO. {{ISBN|9780313348747}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The stereotype of the witch finally solidified in the late [[Middle Ages]]. Numerous texts singled out women to be especially inclined to witchcraft. In the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, women defendants outnumbered men two to one. This difference only became more pronounced in the following centuries. The disparity between women and men defendants was primarily due to the position women held in late medieval society. Women in this era were far less trusted than men, as they were presumably weak minded and easily dissuaded. General [[misogynist]] stereotypes further encouraged their [[prosecution]], which lead to a more stiffened [[stereotype]] of witches. Massive witch trials swept across Europe in the second half of the fifteenth century. In 1428, more than 100 people were burned for killing others, destroying crops, and working harm by means of magic. This trial in the [[Valais]] provided the first evidence for the fully developed stereotype of a witch, including flight through the air, transforming humans into animals, eating babies and the veneration of the [[Devil]]. The unrestricted use of torture in combination with the adoption of inquisitorial procedures as well as the development of the witch stereotype and a dramatic rise in public suspicion ultimately caused the swelling fervor and frequency of these sweeping witch hunts.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1989"/&gt;

== Malleus Maleficarum ==

Practices such as [[alchemy]], medicinal magic, charms, and [[Maleficium (sorcery)|sorcery]] have been dated back centuries before they were considered evil. The [[Catholic Church]] condemned such practices in about 900 AD (3), but it was not until [[Malleus Maleficarum]] was published in 1487 that individuals who practiced things considered as “witchcraft” were punished severely. Malleus Maleficarum was published by a Catholic [[clergyman]] in Germany. It was written in [[Latin]] and the title roughly translates to “Hammer of the Witches”.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2006"&gt;Mackay, Christopher S. (2006). Malleus Maleficarum (2 volumes). Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-85977-8}}. (Latin) (English)&lt;/ref&gt; Before the publication of Malleus Maleficarum, an individual was barely punished if accused of practicing any form of magic.  Post-publication of this document changed the way that medieval society treated anyone who performed anything considered an act of magic or witchcraft.  Malleus Maleficarum was used as a judicial book of guidelines within secular courts of Europe over three hundred years past its date of publication.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2006"/&gt; Its main two purposes were to inform the audience about how to detect individuals who practice magic and how to [[prosecute]] said individuals. The document was divided into three parts, each of which dealt with something different within the process of persecution. The first section discusses what makes witchcraft real and how it is a very present threat to their current society. This section also makes the connection between witches and the [[Devil]].  In the second part, actual acts of magic are discussed.  Chapters within this section are titled with various [[spell (paranormal)|spell]]s that the witches might perform, such as “How they are transported from Place to Place”, “How Witches Impede and Prevent the Power of Procreation”, “Of the Manner whereby they Change Men into the Shapes of Beasts”, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Malleus Maleficarum (1486) translated by Montague Summers (1928)  http://www.sacred-texts.com/pag/mm/&lt;/ref&gt; They identify various magical practices with the idea of witchcraft, thus condemning many acts of magic that have been performed for centuries as crimes punishable by [[death]].  This section also discusses various remedies by which one can protect themselves against the actions of witches, many of these remedies being reminiscent of various magical acts.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt; The third section discusses the actual prosecution of witches, and the procedure by which one must follow.  It defines the use of prosecution, defense, witnesses, and punishments. It is essentially a guide on how to convict an individual of witchcraft.

In [[Greek mythology]], '''Menippe''' and '''Metioche''' were daughters of [[Orion (mythology)|Orion]]. After Orion was killed they were brought up by their mother, and [[Athena]] taught them the art of weaving and [[Aphrodite]] gave them beauty. Once their homeland [[Aonia]] at the base of [[Mount Helicon|Mt. Helicon]] was struck by a plague, and the oracle of Apollo Gortynius, when consulted, ordered the inhabitants to propitiate the two Erinnyes by the sacrifice of two maidens, who were to offer themselves to death of their own accord. '''Menippe''' and '''Metioche''' offered themselves; they thrice invoked the infernal gods, and killed themselves with their shuttles. [[Persephone]] and [[Hades]] metamorphosed them into comets. The Aonians erected them a sanctuary near [[Orchomenus (Boeotia)|Orchomenus]], where a propitiatory sacrifice was offered to them every year by youths and maidens. The [[Thessaly|Aeolians]] called these maidens Koronides.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''Metamorphoses'', 13. 685 ff&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Antoninus Liberalis]], ''Metamorphoses'', 25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Scholia]] on [[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'', 18. 486&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12029">A '''metadata repository''' is a database created to store [[metadata]]. Metadata is information about the structures that contain the actual data. Metadata is often said to be "data about data", but this is misleading. Data profiles are an example of actual "data about data". Metadata is one layer of abstraction removed from this – it is data about the structures that contain data. Metadata may describe the structure of any data, of any subject, stored in any format.

A well-designed metadata repository typically contains data far beyond simple definitions of the various [[data structure]]s. Typical repositories store dozens to hundreds of separate pieces of information about each data structure.

Comparing the metadata of a couple data items - one digital and one physical - will help one understand what metadata really is:

First, digital: for data stored in a database one may have a table called "Patient" with many columns, each containing data which describes a different attribute of each patient. One of these columns may be named "Patient_Last_Name". What is some of the metadata about the column that contains the actual surnames of patients in the database? We have already used two items: the name of the column that contains the data (Patient_Last_Name) and the name of the table that contains the column (Patient). Other metadata might include the maximum length of last name that may be entered, whether or not last name is required (can we have a patient without Patient_Last_Name?), and whether the database converts any surnames entered in lower case to upper case. Metadata of a security nature may show the restrictions which limit who may view these names.

Second, physical: for data stored in a brick and mortar library, one have many volumes and may have various media, including books. Metadata about books would include ISBN, Binding_Type, Page_Count, Author, etc. Within Binding_Type, metadata would include possible bindings, material, etc.

This contextual information of business data include meaning and content, policies that govern, technical attributes, specifications that transform, and programs that manipulate.&lt;ref name="moss"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Moss |first1=L. T. |last2=Atre|first2=S. |year=2003 |title=Business Intelligence Roadmap: The Complete Project Lifecycle for Decision-Support Applications |publisher=Addison-Wesley Professional |isbn=0-201-78420-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HSeE7rOXKsUC}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|171}}

==Definition==
The metadata repository is responsible for physically storing and cataloging metadata. Data in a metadata repository should be generic, integrated, current, and historical.  '''Generic''' : meta model should store the metadata by generic terms instead of storing it by an applications-specific defined way, so that if your data base standard changes from one product to another the physical meta model of the metadata repository would not need to change. 
'''Integration''' of the metadata repository allows all business areas' metadata to be in an integrated fashion: covering all domains and subject areas of the organization. 
The metadata repository should have accessible '''current and historical''' metadata.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |pages=36–43 |last1=Marco |first1=D., |last2=Jennings, M. |year=2004 |title=Universal Metadata Models |publisher=Wiley |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tSw-n0xxIfkC&amp;pg=PA36 |isbn=0-471-08177-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Metadata repositories used to be referred to as a [[data dictionary]].&lt;ref name="moss" /&gt;{{rp|239}}

With the transition of needs for the metadata usage for business intelligence has increased so is the scope of the metadata repository increased. Earlier data dictionaries are the closest place to interact technology with business. Data dictionaries are the universe of metadata repository in the initial stages but as the scope increased Business glossary and their tags to variety of status flags emerged in the business side while consumption of the technology metadata, their lineage and linkages made the repository, the source for valuable reports to bring business and technology together and helped data management decisions easier as well as assess the cost of the changes.

Metadata repository explores the enterprise wide data governance, data quality and [[master data management]] (includes master data and reference data) and integrates this wealth of information with integrated metadata across the organization to provide [[decision support system]] for data structures, even though it only reflects the structures consumed from various systems.

==Repository vs. registry==
{{main|Metadata registry}}

Repository has additional functionalities compared with registry. Metadata repository not only stores metadata like Metadata registry but also adds relationships with related metadata types. Metadata when related in a  flow from its point of entry into organization up to the deliverables is considered as the lineage of that data point. Metadata when related across other related metadata types is called linkages. By providing the relationships to all the metadata points across the organization and maintaining its integrity with an architecture to handle the changes, metadata repository provides the basic material for understanding the complete data flow and their definitions and their impact. Also the important feature is to maintain the version control though this statement for contrasting is open for discussion. These definitions are still evolving, so the accuracy of the definitions needs refinement.

Purpose of registry is to define the metadata element and maintained across the organization. and data models and other data management teams refers to the registry for any changes to follow. While Metadata repository  sources metadata from various metadata systems in the organizations and reflects what is in the upstream. Repository never acts as an upstream while registry is used as an upstream for metadata changes.

==Reason for use==
Metadata repository enables all the structure of the organizations data containers to one integrated place. This opens plethora of resourceful information for making calculated business decisions. This tool uses one generic form of data model to integrate all the models thus brings all the applications and programs of the organization into one format. And on top of it applying the business definitions and business processes brings the business and technology closer that will help organizations make reliable roadmaps with definite goals. With one stop information, business will have more control on the changes, and can do impact analysis of the tool. Usually business spends lots of time and money to make decisions based on discovery and research on impacts to make changes or to add new data structures or remove structures in data management of the organization. With a structured and well maintained repository, moving the product from ideation to delivery takes the least amount of time (considering other variables are constant). 
To sum it up:
# '''Integration''' of the metadata across the organization. 
# Build relationship between various '''metadata types'''  
# Build relationship between various '''disparate systems'''. 
# '''Define business''' golden copy of definitions.  
# '''Version''' control of the changes at structure level. 
# interaction with '''Reference data'''  
# link view to '''master data'''. 
# automatic '''sync'''hronization  with various authorized metadata source systems. 
# More '''control''' to business decisions. 
# '''validate''' the structures by overlapping the models 
# discovering '''discrepancies''', '''gaps''', '''lineage''', '''metrics''' at data structure level.

Each database management system (DBMS) and database tools have their own language for the metadata components within.  Database applications already have their own repositories or registries that are expected to provide all of the necessary functionality to access the data stored within.  Vendors do not want other companies to be capable of easily migrating data away from their products and into competitors products, so they are proprietary with the way they handle metadata.  CASE tools, DBMS dictionaries, ETL tools, [[data cleansing]] tools, OLAP tools, and data mining tools all handle and store metadata differently.  Only a metadata repository can be designed to store the metadata components from all of these tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Marco |first=D. |year=2000 |title=Building and Managing the Metadata Repository: A Full Lifecycle Guide |publisher=Wiley |isbn=978-0471355236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
Metadata repositories should store metadata in four classifications: ownership, descriptive characteristics, rules and policies, and physical characteristics.  Ownership, showing the data owner and the application owner.  The descriptive characteristics, define the names, types and lengths, and definitions describing business data or business processes.  Rules and policies, will define security, data cleanliness, timelines for data, and relationships.  Physical characteristics define the origin or source, and physical location.&lt;ref name="moss" /&gt;{{rp|176}}  Like building a [[logical data model]] for creating a database, a logical meta model can help identify the metadata requirements for business data.&lt;ref name="moss" /&gt;{{rp|185}} The metadata repository will be centralized, decentralized, or distributed.  A centralized design means that there is one database  for the metadata repository that stores metadata for all applications business wide.  A centralized metadata repository has the same advantages and disadvantages of a [[centralized database]].  Easier to manage because all the data is in one database, but the disadvantage is that bottlenecks may occur.

A decentralized metadata repository stores metadata in multiple databases, either separated by location and or departments of the business.  This makes management of the repository more involved than a centralized metadata repository, but the advantage is that the metadata can be broken down into individual departments.

A distributed metadata repository uses a decentralized method, but unlike a decentralized metadata repository the metadata remains in its original application.  An [[XML]] gateway is created&lt;ref name="moss" /&gt;{{rp|246}} that acts as a directory for accessing the metadata within each different application.  The advantages and disadvantages for a distributed metadata repository mirror that of a [[distributed database]].

Design of information model should include various layers of metadata types to be overlapped to create an integrated view of the data. Various metadata types should be stitched with related metadata elements in a top down model linking to business glossary.

Layers of Metadata:
# Business Glossary : contains recursive relationship to Business terms.
# Business tags: Contains various affiliation to that term or terms.
# Data Dictionary: contains information from data model tools for the definition of metadata elements and their technical definitions provided by data or enterprise architecture. 
# Conceptual data models:
# Logical data models
# Physical data models
# Databases
# validation rules and data quality rules 
# ETL, business rules and their relationship to attributes and entities 
# Reports 
# Source to target mapping artifacts (relationships)
# Reporting requirements (relationships)
# business processes and their relationship to technology
# people hierarchy and their relationship
# owner relationship

===Entity-Relationship/Object-Oriented===
Metadata repositories can be designed as either an [[Entity-relationship model]], or an [[Object-oriented design]].

'''Michael Bérubé''' (born 1961) is an Edwin Erle Sparks Professor of Literature at [[Pennsylvania State University]], where he teaches American literature, disability studies, and cultural studies. He is the author of several books on [[cultural studies]], [[disability rights]], liberal and conservative [[politics]], and debates in [[higher education]]. From 2010 to 2017, he was the Director of the Institute for the Arts and Humanities at Penn State; from 1997 to 2001 he was the founding director of the Illinois Program for Research in the Humanities. He was the 2012 president of the [[Modern Language Association]], and served as vice president from 2010–2011. He served two terms on the National Council of the [[American Association of University Professors]] from 2005 to 2011, and three terms on the AAUP's Committee A on Academic Freedom and Tenure from 2009 to 2018. He was a member of the International Advisory Board of the [[Consortium of Humanities Centers and Institutes]] for two terms, 2011-2017. Bérubé was named a University Scholar for research at the University of Illinois in 1995 and was awarded the Faculty Scholar medal for research from Penn State in 2012.

== Life, education and career ==
The son of Maurice Berube (now Eminent Scholar Emeritus and Professor Emeritus of Educational Leadership at Old Dominion University),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://catalog.odu.edu/graduate/officersoftheuniversity/faculty_emeriti/|title=Faculty Emeriti|publisher=Old Dominion University|accessdate=September 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bérubé was born and raised in New York City. He attended [[Regis High School (New York City)|Regis High School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Williams |first1=Jeffrey J. |title=Public Essayist: An Interview with Michael Bérubé |url=http://www.theminnesotareview.org/journal/ns67/interview_berube.shtml |accessdate=August 4, 2014 |work=Minnesota Review |date=Fall 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140331100824/http://www.theminnesotareview.org/journal/ns67/interview_berube.shtml |archivedate=March 31, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He received a B.A. in English from [[Columbia University]] in 1982 and a Ph.D. in English from the [[University of Virginia]], where he studied from 1983 to 1989. Bérubé held a professorship in the English department at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]] from 1989 to 2001, where he was affiliated with the [[Unit for Criticism and Interpretive Theory]] and the Afro-American Studies and Research Program. In 2001, Bérubé moved to Penn State for the then-newly created Paterno Family Professorship in Literature, from which he resigned in the wake of the [[Penn State child sex abuse scandal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bérubé|first=Michael|title=Why I Resigned the Paterno Chair|url=http://chronicle.com/article/Why-I-Resigned-the-Paterno/134944/|publisher=The Chronicle of Higher Education|accessdate=9 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1996 to 2016, Bérubé edited "Cultural Front", the New York University Press series which published his 2009 book ''The Left at War'' and his 1998 book ''The Employment of English,'' as well as fifteen other titles, many in disability studies. He now co-edits "Crip: New Directions in Disability Studies" for NYU Press along with Robert McRuer and Ellen Samuels. He maintained a personal blog from 2004 to 2010 and wrote for ''Crooked Timber'' from 2007 to 2012.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

== Publications and achievements ==
Bérubé drew attention in the early 1990s for his essays in the ''[[Village Voice]]'' and ''Village Voice Literary Supplement'' (VLS), which dealt with (among other things) [[political correctness]], [[postmodernism]], and cultural studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Williams|first=Jeffrey|title=Interview with Michael Bérubé|url=http://theconversant.org/?p=5065|publisher=The Conversant|accessdate=4 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994 he published an essay in ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'', "Life As We Know It: A Father, A Son, and Genetic Destiny", about his son Jamie, who has [[Down syndrome]], and in 1995 a review essay in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' on contemporary black intellectuals; these essays, particularly the latter, drew a wide array of energetic and often contentious responses. Some of the ''VLS'' essays were revised and republished in Bérubé’s second book, ''Public Access'' (1994). Since then, Bérubé has continued to write for newspapers and magazines, including ''[[Dissent (American magazine)|Dissent]]'', ''[[the Nation]]'', the ''[[New York Times]]''(and ''[[New York Times Magazine]]''), the ''[[Boston Globe]]'', the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', and the ''[[Washington Post]]''. Since 1997 he has also been a contributor to the ''[[Chronicle of Higher Education]]''.

Bérubé's third book, ''Life As We Know It: A Father, A Family, and an Exceptional Child'', was published in 1996. Following a positive review by Beverly Lowry,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lowry|first=Beverly|title=We Can Handle This|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/10/27/books/we-can-handle-this.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm|work=New York Times|accessdate=4 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Life As We Know It'' was named a ''New York Times'' Notable Book of the Year; it was also named as one of the best books of the year by Maureen Corrigan of [[National Public Radio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Corrigan |first=Maureen |authorlink=Maureen Corrigan |title=Holiday picks|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1109446
|publisher=[[NPR|National Public Radio]] |date=December 16, 1996 |accessdate=7 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an expanded account of Jamie's first four years, as well as a discussion of disability rights, abortion and prenatal testing, early intervention programs, early childhood language acquisition, school policy, and theories of justice.

In 2005-06, Bérubé emerged as a critic of [[David Horowitz]]'s "Academic Bill of Rights"; an account of that campaign, together with a description of Bérubé's pedagogy in undergraduate classes, makes up most of Bérubé’s fifth book, ''What's Liberal About the Liberal Arts? Classroom Politics and "Bias" in Higher Education'' (2006). Bérubé also published a number of essays critical of figures on the antiwar left and their response to the terrorist attack of [[9/11]] and the invasion of [[Afghanistan]], though he said he opposed the [[Iraq War]]; the argument was elaborated in his seventh book, ''The Left At War'', published in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Left at War|url=https://www.questia.com/library/118273923/the-left-at-war|publisher=New York University Press|accessdate=17 August 2014|date=2009|subscription=yes|via=[[Questia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Berube|first=Michael|title=Peace Puzzle |url=http://www.boston.com/news/packages/iraq/globe_stories/091502_bush.htm|work=Boston Globe|accessdate=4 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 Bérubé published two books in disability studies: ''The Secret Life of Stories'', a study of narrative strategies involving varieties of intellectual disability, and ''Life as Jamie Knows It'', a sequel to ''Life as We Know It'' written with substantial input from the now-adult Jamie Bérubé.

Bérubé lives in State College, Pennsylvania, with his wife Janet Lyon. Their first child, Nicholas, is an architect working in Boston.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2856">'''Nerys Ann Johnson''' (5 October 1942 &amp;ndash; 12 June 2001) was a Welsh-born artist and art curator.

==Early life and education==
Johnson was born at [[Colwyn Bay]], [[Denbighshire]], and raised in [[Mansfield, Nottinghamshire]], the daughter of Howard and May Johnson. She spent much of her childhood in the hospital with complications from [[rheumatoid arthritis]], a lifelong condition. She studied painting and art history at Kings College, [[Durham University]].&lt;ref&gt;David Buckman, [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/nerys-johnson-9164572.html "Nerys Johnson"] ''The Independent'' (29 August 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Johnson was Keeper of Fine Arts the [[Laing Art Gallery]] in [[Newcastle-upon-Tyne]] from 1967, and "keeper in charge" at the [[Durham Light Infantry]] Museum and Arts Centre from 1970 to 1989. In both sites, she curated exhibitions that critic [[Julian Spalding]] recalled as "fresh and original."&lt;ref name="GObit"&gt;Julian Spalding, [https://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/jul/04/guardianobituaries.arts "Nerys Johnson: Artist Whose Work Defeated her Disability"] ''The Guardian'' (4 July 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

In retirement after 1989, she concentrated on her own art, often with very colorful floral subjects, and had several solo exhibitions.&lt;ref name="Evans"&gt;Kate Evans, [http://www.nerysjohnson.com/images/NJ_ARTICLE.pdf "A Passion for Painting"] ''Artists &amp; Illustrators'' (March 2000): 14-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnson's arthritis affected her art. As her impairment progressed, she painted on smaller canvases, to accommodate her reduced range of motion. "I am appalled when people see my painting as a hobby, and comment how relaxing it must be," she explained in 2000. "If they just knew how it takes every ounce of energy I've got, every atom of concentration."&lt;ref name="Evans" /&gt; 

She died in 2001, age 58.&lt;ref name="GObit" /&gt; The Nerys Johnson Contemporary Art Fund is supported by the sale of her works, and makes grants to public galleries to purchase work by living artists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-art.newhall.cam.ac.uk/the-collection/by/artist/id/180/name/Nerys+Johnson/artwork/306 Artist Page: Nerys Johnson], New Hall Art Collection, University of Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the [[National Museum of Wales]] opened an exhibit of Johnson's works, to mark the tenth anniversary of her death. Another posthumous show was mounted in 2014, at the Martin Tinney Gallery in Cardiff.&lt;ref&gt;Julian Spalding, [http://wsimag.com/art/10081-nerys-johnson "Art: Nerys Johnson"] ''Wall Street Journal International'' (February 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''New Georgia Encyclopedia''''' ('''NGE''') is a web-based [[encyclopedia]] containing over 2,000 articles about the state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. It is a program of Georgia Humanities (GH), in partnership with the [[University of Georgia Press]], the [[University System of Georgia]]/[[Georgia Library Learning Online]] (GALILEO), and the [[List of Governors of Georgia|Office of the Governor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
| url = http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/about-nge
| title = About NGE
| accessdate = 2017-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NGE was launched in 2004. It was the first state encyclopedia to be conceived and designed exclusively for publication online. The idea for the project grew out of the 1996 joint publication of ''The New Georgia Guide'' by the Georgia Humanities Council and the University of Georgia Press. The guide, itself a spiritual successor to the [[New Deal]]-era [[American Guide Series]], was a literary success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book
| title = The New Georgia Guide
| publisher = [[University of Georgia Press]]
| year = 1996
| page = xvii
| isbn = 9780820317991}}&lt;/ref&gt; Georgia Humanities and UGA Press then convinced Governor [[Zell Miller]], who commissioned the guide in the first place, to fund the planning and development of a comprehensive print and online state encyclopedia. The name "New Georgia Encyclopedia" was chosen as an homage to the ''New Georgia Guide'' and as a reference to the new online medium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
| url=http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/about/Index.jsp?id=t-7
| title=About - The New Georgia Encyclopedia
| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130130193336/http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/about/Index.jsp?id=t-7
| archivedate=2013-01-30
| deadurl=unfit
| accessdate=2017-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the project developed, plans for a print volume of the encyclopedia fell through. The planning committee argued that the increased receptiveness to change offered by the online medium would quickly obviate a printed volume. They also stressed that the proposed online-only encyclopedia would abide by the authoritative editorial standards of a print encyclopedia.

Georgia Library Learning Online (GALILEO), a web portal to hundreds of subscription-only databases meant for Georgian libraries and schools, joined UGA Press and GH in fall 1998 as a project partner. GALILEO hosts the NGE website today.

Unlike other state and regional encyclopedias, the project partners and editorial staff believed that the NGE should cover a wide range of subjects, instead of only history and culture. Today, the NGE separates its articles into 10 topics:  Arts and Culture, Business and Economy, Counties, Cities, and Neighborhoods, Education, Geography and Environment, Government and Politics, History and Archaeology, Science and Medicine, Sports and Outdoor Recreation, and People. Just under 800 writers contributed to the NGE. The site received 1-2 million page views a month at the beginning of January 2011. The site was redesigned in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

The '''New York Public Library for the Performing Arts, Dorothy and Lewis B. Cullman Center''', at 40 Lincoln Center Plaza, is located in [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]], at the [[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts]] on the [[Upper West Side]], between the [[Metropolitan Opera House (Lincoln Center)|Metropolitan Opera House]] and the [[Vivian Beaumont Theater]]. It houses one of the world's largest collections of materials relating to the performing arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The New York Public Library |url=http://www.nypl.org/locations/lpa |title=New York Public Library for the Performing Arts, Dorothy and Lewis B.

== History ==

=== Founding and original configuration ===
Originally the collections that formed The New York Public Library for the Performing Arts (hereafter LPA) were housed in two buildings.  The Research collections on Dance, Music, and Theatre were located at the [[New York Public Library Main Branch]], now named the Stephen A. Schwarzman Building, and the circulating music collection was located in the 58th Street Library.

A separate center to house performing arts was first proposed by [[Carleton Sprague Smith]] (chief of the Music Division) in a 1932 report to the library administration, "A Worthy Music Center for New York."&lt;ref&gt;Beck, p. 20ff.&lt;/ref&gt; (At the time, dance materials and sound recordings were all part of the Music Division.)  There were attempts to create partnerships with [[Rockefeller Center]] (under construction at the time), the [[Museum of Modern Art]], and the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (to which [[New York University]] wanted to join as a partner).  During the late 1930s and early 1940s, the Music Division produced a program of concerts (based on the model of the [[Library of Congress]] concerts in [[Thomas Jefferson Building#Coolidge Auditorium|Coolidge Auditorium]]).  These concerts were often held in conjunction with the Metropolitan Museum of Art and [[Juilliard School]], and the program grew to include Lectures from New York University staff.

After Lincoln Center was incorporated in 1956, an early mention of a possible "library and museum of the performing arts" appeared in June 1957.&lt;ref&gt;Howard Taubman, "Civic Pride: City Officials Should Work for Lincoln Center as a Municipal Necessity," ''New York Times'' (June 2, 1957), p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was envisioned that a library-museum would serve to "interpret and illuminate the entire range of the performing arts."&lt;ref&gt;Beck, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;  By December of that year, the library had become an accepted component of Lincoln Center planning and fundraising.&lt;ref&gt;"Committee Set Up To Seek Arts Fund," ''New York Times'' (December 2, 1957), p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;  Recalling his earlier reports, Smith produced a new report arguing for a move to Lincoln Center.  Library administration officially approved of the move in June 1959.&lt;ref&gt;Beck, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

The building housing the library's research collections and the Vivian Beaumont Theater was the third building to be opened at Lincoln Center.&lt;ref&gt;Milton Esterow, "Beaumont Theater Opens at Lincoln Center," ''New York Times'' (October 13, 1965), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;  Original plans conceived the library as a separate building, but prohibitive costs necessitated a combination of the Library and the Theater.  As built, the Theater forms the central core of the building, the 1st and 2nd floors occupying the southern and western sides, and the 3rd floor research collections providing a roof.  Noted modernist architect [[Gordon Bunshaft]], of the firm of [[Skidmore, Owings and Merrill]] (SOM) designed the interiors, and SOM consulted with [[Eero Saarinen]] and Associates (architect for the Vivian Beaumont Theater) on the exteriors.&lt;ref name=ready&gt;Allen Hughes, "Library and Museum 01 the Arts At Lincoln Center Ready Soon," ''New York Times'' (October 21, 1965), p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Claire Tow Theater (belonging to Lincoln Center Theater) was built on the roof of the Library and opened in June 2012.

The third floor, housing the research collections, opened to the public on July 19.&lt;ref name=ready/&gt; The entire library was opened to the public on November 30, 1965, the 4th building to open at Lincoln Center.&lt;ref name=opens&gt;"Library-Museum of the Arts Opens at Lincoln Center," ''New York Times'' (December 1, 1965), p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;  At its opening, it was called "Library and Museum of the Performing Arts."  The Library's museum component was named the Shelby Collum Davis Museum in honor of an investment banker who contributed $1 million to Lincoln Center for museum purposes.&lt;ref name=opens/&gt;

At its opening, the Library's main lobby at the Lincoln Center Plaza entrance housed a bookstore, a film viewing area, and a listening area.  The second floor included a children's performing arts collection as well as the Hecksher Oval, an enclosed space that could accommodate story-telling.  Prior to the 2001 renovation, the children's collection was relocated to the Riverside Branch. The Hecksher Oval was removed as part of the renovation.

The Shelby Collum Davis Museum spaces included small and separate areas in the Dance, Music, Sound archive and Theater research divisions.  Bigger galleries were the Vincent Astor Gallery on the 2nd floor, and galleries on the lower level and 2nd floor.

=== 2001 renovation ===
From 1998 through 2001, the building was closed due to a $38 million renovation project designed by [[Polshek Partnership]].  (The renovation was unrelated to the Lincoln Center renovations which commenced shortly after 2001.)  During this time, the research collections were serviced from the NYPL's Annex (at 10th avenue and 43rd street), and the circulating collections were housed at the Mid-Manhattan Library at 40th Street and Fifth Avenue.  LPA reopened to the public on October 29, 2001 with its building newly named [[Dorothy Cullman|Dorothy]] and Lewis B. Cullman Center after a gift from the Cullmans (Dorothy was a trustee until she died; Lewis is still a trustee).&lt;ref&gt;Mel Gussow, "Curtain Going Up at the Performing Arts Library," ''New York Times (October 11, 2001), p. E1.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hirschfeld desk.jpg|right|thumb|Al Hirschfeld's desk and chair in the lobby of the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts]]

During the renovation, the library was wired to enable installation of numerous computers on each floor.  There are nearly 200 publicly accessible computers in the building.&lt;ref&gt;Personal communication from IT staff, May 12, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source needed|date=September 2017}} Most are restricted to use of the library catalog and electronic databases or viewing the library's audiovisual material, but a few provide full Internet access. The renovation also created a Technology Training Room, with twelve desktop computers for users and one for a teacher, as well as a projection screen. 

Upon the building's original opening in 1965, each research division had a separate reading room. The renovation removed these and consolidated public areas into a single unified public reading area, with separate rooms for the Theater on Film and Tape Archive (its screening room named for [[Lucille Lortel]]) and Special Collections (its room named for [[Katharine Cornell]] and [[Guthrie McClintic]]).  Subsequently the Special Collections reading room was moved into a portion of the main reading area of the 3rd floor, while a screening room for the Reserve Film and Video Collection (originally part of the [[Donnell Library Center|Donnell Media Center]], but absorbed into the Collection in 2008) took its place. Meanwhile, gallery space for the museum was consolidated into two main gallery spaces with smaller areas for display of other items. The Donald and Mary Oenslager Gallery is located on the first floor, adjacent to the Lincoln Plaza entrance, while the Vincent Astor Gallery (formerly on the second floor) is now located on the lower level, adjacent to the Amsterdam Avenue entrance.  A small area near the Lincoln Center Plaza entrance houses caricaturist [[Al Hirschfield]]'s desk and chair.  The main corridor on the first floor is used for displaying photographs, posters, and other two-dimensional items. The third floor has numerous display cases highlighting rotating displays of thematic groupings of artifacts from the collections. 

The renovation was not without detractors.  Critic [[Joseph Horowitz]] criticized the third floor in particular.  Where previously each division had its own reading room, the renovation united all public reading areas into one room, resulting in less intimacy and more noise.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Horowitz, "Quiet, Please. This Is a Library After All." ''New York Times (January 27, 2002), p. A31.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edmund Morris (writer)|Edmund Morris]] characterized the Special Collections reading room as "a charmless space...&lt;nowiki&gt;[which]&lt;/nowiki&gt; exudes a dispirited air of neglect."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/22/opinion/sunday/sacking-a-palace-of-culture.html?_r=1&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=morris%20library&amp;st=Search Edmund Morris, "Sacking a Palace of Culture" ''New York Times'' (April 21, 2012), p. SR7].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research collections ==
From its inception, LPA has had both a [[research]] component (funded mostly with private money) and a branch library component (funded with significant money from New York City, the remainder coming from private contributions).

=== Materials and formats ===
In addition to published works (for example, books, periodicals, and scores), the research divisions collect an enormous amount of unique material: [[Archive|Archival material]] (material that was created by or that once belonged to an individual or organization), [[Manuscript|text manuscripts]], [[music manuscript]]s, typescripts, [[prompt book]]s, [[poster]]s, [[Scenic design|original set and costume designs]], [[Programme (booklet)|programs]], and other [[ephemera]] are just some of the major categories of materials.  The library's collection of [[sound recordings]] is in all formats that in themselves trace the history and development of sound recording.[[File:Clippings.jpg|thumb|Behind the scenes: A small portion of the hundreds of file cabinets containing over a million clippings at LPA]]

The library has 500,000 folders containing [[Clipping (publications)|clippings]] on a variety of people and subjects pertaining to the performing arts. These clippings can sometimes provide a beginning to those at the initial stage of their research. The library also collects a variety of [[iconography]] in various forms: [[photographs]], [[lithographs]], [[engravings]], [[drawings]], and others.  A recent internal report estimated that LPA holds approximately 4.5 million photographs, including the recently acquired collection of New York photographer Martha Swope, itself holding 1 million photographs.

Much of this non-book material was not initially in the online catalog.&lt;ref&gt;A 1995 brochure indicated that 80% of the materials at LPA were not in the online catalog.&lt;/ref&gt; Some materials are accessible through in-house card files and indexes. Policy since changed to bring as much of the material as possible into the main catalog, and by 2013, most of it was accessible in the catalog. Because of the enormous volume of material, some classes of it, such as the clipping files, has never been inventoried, although it is arranged in a retrievable manner with an alphabetical or chronological arrangement. Unlike most U.S. public libraries, the research collections stacks are located in non-public areas and are not available for browsing.  Patrons must determine what they want to view, fill out call slips, and submit the slips to library staff.  Library staff then retrieves the material for the patron.

The holdings of LPA are divided by subject into divisions, which contain a number of special centers.

=== Music Division ===
The Music Division, as a founding division of The New York Public Library, is the oldest of all the divisions at LPA.  Its origins stem from the private library of banker [[Joseph William Drexel]].  Upon his death in 1888, his valuable library of 5,542 volumes and 766 pamphlets, known as the [[Drexel Collection]], became part of the Lenox Library. The Astor Library also had an endowment that helped with the purchase of music. In 1895, upon the Lenox Library's consolidation with the Astor Library, the Music Division became one of the first subject divisions of The New York Public Library.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Much of the content of this section is derived from the thorough history of the Music Division through 1981 in a four-part article:  Philip L. Miller, Frank C. Campbell, Otto Kinkeldey, "How the Music Division of the New York Public Library Grew-A Memoir," ''Notes'' Vol. 35, No. 3 (March 1979), pp. 537–555 (parts 1–2), Vol. 36, No. 1 (September 1979), pp. 65–77 (part 3), Vol. 38, No. 1 (September 1981), pp. 14–41 (part 4).&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''The New Grove Dictionary of Jazz'', the library has particular strong manuscript holdings in [[jazz]], These include 400 of  [[Benny Goodman]]'s arrangements, and the arrangements made by [[Sy Oliver]] for musicians including [[Duke Ellington]], [[Jimmie Lunceford]], and [[Tommy Dorsey]]. It holds working scores of works by Ellington, and by  [[Charles Mingus]] as well as extensive microlim copies of Mingus' manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;"Libraries and archives." The New Grove Dictionary of Jazz, 2nd ed.. Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online. Oxford University Press, accessed March 28, 2013, [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/J268900].&lt;/ref&gt;

Classical music manuscript holding include manuscripts by Bach, [[Johannes Brahms]], [[Franz Liszt]], [[Mikhail Glinka|Glinka]], Handel, Haydn, [[Korngold]]  Mozart, [[Paganini]], Schubert and Schumann  ;&lt;ref&gt;Rita Benton. "Libraries." Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online. Oxford University Press, accessed March 28, 2013, [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/40070pg38]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Billy Rose Theatre Division===
The Library has been collecting theatrical materials for years prior to 1931, when the executors of [[David Belasco]]'s estate offered the producer's holdings on the condition that a division be created.  The Theatre Collection (as it was initially known) began on September 1, 1931. The division opened at Lincoln Center as the Theatre Collection.  In 1979, it was renamed the [[Billy Rose]] Theatre Division, honoring a financial gift from the lyricist/producer's foundation. It is now the largest research division at the library, with holdings primarily on the theatre, and increasing on film, with some collections on the related subjects of vaudeville, magic, puppetry, and the circus. The Theater of Film and Tape Archive is administratively within the division.

The Theatre division includes the [[Theatre on Film and Tape Archive|Theatre on Film and Tape Archive (TOFT)]] which produces video recordings of New York and regional theater productions, and provides research access at its [[Lucille Lortel]] screening room. The collection is considered one of the most comprehensive collections of videotaped theater productions in the world.&lt;ref&gt;["After the Final Curtain, Act II," ''New York Times'' (June 9, 2013).]&lt;/ref&gt;  Archives modeled on TOFT include the [[Museum of Performance &amp; Design]] in [[San Francisco]], the Washington Area Performing Arts Video Archive established in [[Washington, D.C.]], and the [[National Video Archive of Performance]] in [[London]].  The core of the collection consists of live recordings of Broadway and Off-Broadway productions, with some additional productions from professional regional theaters. The Archive also records interviews and dialogues with notable theater professionals. In addition to live performances, commercial recordings of theater-related films, documentaries, and television programs are also included in the collection. Currently between 50 - 60 live recordings are produced each year, covering most important productions. As of fall of 2016, the collection included 7,901 titles.&lt;ref name="2013AR"&gt;2016 Annual Report&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jerome Robbins Dance Division===
The Jerome Robbins Dance Division began in 1944 under the auspices of Genevieve Oswald.&lt;ref&gt;Clive Barnes, "Dance: Collection Moves to New Home," ''New York Times'' (January 4, 1966), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;  Originally dance materials were part of the Music Division (when it was known as the "Dance Collection"), but its growth necessitated hiring a full-time staff member in 1947.&lt;ref name="Williams, p. 151"&gt;Williams, p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt;  Acquisitions were augmented by gifts of papers of [[Ted Shawn]] and [[Ruth St. Denis]], [[Doris Humphrey]], [[Charles Weidman]], and [[Hanya Holm]].  With the gift of a collection of Walter Toscanini in honor of his deceased wife, Cia Fornaroli (a dancer), the Dance Collection became an internationally known repository.&lt;ref name="Williams, p. 151"/&gt;  Due to its subsequent growth and increasing importance, the collection was formally recognized as a separate division on January 1, 1964.&lt;ref&gt;Philip L. Miller, "How the Music Division Grew-A Memoir," ''Notes'' vol. 35, no. 3 (March 1979), p. 549.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the division's most significant resources is the Jerome Robbins Archive of the Recorded Moving Image. Endowed with a gift from Jerome Robbins, this archive collects and preserves moving images of dance, making them available to researchers.  The Archive has received many gifts from dancers and choreographers and contains many privately made films and video.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, p. 151, 154.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Division's [[oral history]] program began formally in 1965.  These oral histories are particularly valuable since they provide information, history and context not generally available in published sources.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reserve Film and Video ===
Though not technically a part of the Research divisions, the Reserve Film and Video Collection (formerly the Donnell Media Center) is serviced from the third floor.  For film and video that must be viewed onsite, there is a screening room (large enough for classes) equipped with a 16&amp;nbsp;mm projector.  There are also  [[moviola]]s and [[Steenbeck]] equipment, permitting close frame-by-frame examination and analysis.[[File:Reserve film.jpg|left|thumb|Screening room for the Reserve Film and Video collection; moviola and Steenbeck equipment is on the right]]

===Rodgers and Hammerstein Archives of Recorded Sound===
[[File:Theatre_on_Film_and_Tape.jpg|left|thumb|Theatre on Film and Tape room – dedicated to donor [[Lucille Lortel]] ]]
[[File:Mapleson cylinders.jpg|left|thumb|Some of the [[Mapleson Cylinders]], one of the sound archive's most treasured items]] [[File:Toscanini rehearsals.jpg|thumb|A few of the hundreds of hours of rehearsal recordings featuring [[Arturo Toscanini]] ]]
The origins of the Rodgers and Hammerstein Archives of Recorded Sound can be traced to a gift of 500 78 rpm records by Columbia Records in 1937 to the Music Division.  Successive gifts by record companies and individuals led to the formal creation of a separate division with the opening of the building at Lincoln Center in 1965.  It was named in honor of a generous gift from the Rodgers and Hammerstein organization.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt;  Radio station WQXR donated 11,000 78 rpm recordings in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;"Lincoln Center Receives 11,000 Disks From WQXR," ''New York Times'' (June 9, 1966), p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;  Carleton Sprague Smith envisioned the purpose of the sound archive as "stimulating interest among recording and broadcasting executives, as well as other arts institutions that had potential for playing a cooperative role."&lt;ref&gt;David Hall, "The Rodgers and Hammerstein Archives of Recorded Sound, The New York Public Library at Lincoln Center," in: ''Libraries, History, Diplomacy, and the Performing Arts: Essays in Honor of Carleton Sprague Smith'', Festschrift Series no. 9 (Stuyvesant, NY: Pendragon Press, 1991), p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; Resources include the [[Rigler-Deutsch Index]], which lists of library's extensive holdings of [[78 rpm]] records.

== Branch (Circulating) Collections ==
[[File:Cullom museum.jpg|left|thumb|One of the display walls of the Shelby Collum Davis Museum]]

The beginnings of the circulating music collection are due in great part to its first head librarian, Dorothy Lawton.&lt;ref name=lawton&gt;"Dorothy Lawton, Librarian, 85, Dies," ''New York Times'' (February 21, 1960), p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;  Lawton took part in the establishment of the music collection at the 58th Street Library in 1920, beginning with a collection of 1,000 books and scores.  In 1924 the circulating music collection was officially established as part of the 58th Street Library.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nypl.org/locations/lpa/circulating-music-collection Circulating Music Collection], accessed September 5, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  Her passion for dance enabled her to get unusual publications, so much that dance critic [[John Martin (dance critic)|John Martin]] complimented her on the growing collection of dance books.&lt;ref&gt;John Martin, "The Dance: A Treasury: Important New Volumes Added to Growing Collection at Library," ''New York Times'' (October 4, 1931), p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1929, the 58th Street Library began a collection of recordings beginning with gifts from Victor and Columbia records, amounting to 500 records.  Upon building a listening booth, Lawton reported that by 1933, the listening booth was constantly booked two weeks in advance.&lt;ref&gt;Compton Parkenham, "Review of Newly Recorded Music," ''New York Times'' (April 15, 1934), p. X6.&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War II]], she established a concert series for servicemen on Sundays from 3–7 PM.  Servicemen could request selections of their choice and could also participate in playing chamber music with instruments that had been loaned to the Library.  She established the Orchestra Collection, a set of scores and parts that could be loaned to groups for performance.  Currently, the Orchestra Collection loans parts to over 2,000 works.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nypl.org/locations/lpa/orchestra-collection website], accessed September 9, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:CDs.jpg|thumb|A portion of the thousands of CDs that can be borrowed from The New York Public Library for the Performing Arts]]

Upon Lawton's retirement in 1945, chief music critic of the New York Times [[Olin Downes]] complimented her on the development of the 58th Street Library, and remarked on her achievements such as attracting donors and enlisting the concern and help of professional musicians.&lt;ref&gt;Olin Downes, "Librarian Retires: A Tribute to Dorothy Lawton-Her Contribution to Our Musical Life," ''New York Times'' (July 8, 1945), p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;  (Many of the rare items that were gifts to the 58th Street Branch were subsequently moved to the Music Division.)

After retiring, Lawton returned to the country of her birth, England, and help organize a newly created music collection at Central Music Library of the Buckingham Palace Road Library (today the [[City of Westminster#Public libraries|Westminster Music Library]]), modeling the new library on the one she established at 58th Street.&lt;ref name=lawton/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Olin Downes, "London Library: Music Institution Formed Along Lines of 58th Street Branch Here," ''New York Times'' (August 10, 1947), p. X6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"London Library," ''New York Times'' (November 14, 1948), p. X7.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:DVDs.jpg|left|thumb|A small portion of the thousands of DVDs that can be borrowed from The New York Public Library for the Performing Arts]]
Currently, the Circulating collections loan books on music, dance, theater, film, and arts administration.  They also loan scores, scripts, CDs, videotapes, DVDs, and sets of orchestral parts.

==Shelby Collum Davis Museum==
The museum component of LPA takes the form of exhibitions in its two main exhibition spaces, The Donald and Mary Oenslager Gallery and the Vincent Astor Gallery, as well as a walled area in the plaza entrance, and additionally display cases distributed throughout the building. Among the purposes of the exhibitions is to show to all visitors that the millions of items belonging to the library are not for the exclusive use of scholars but for anyone who walks in the door.&lt;ref&gt;Eleanor Blau, "Performing Arts Library Celebrates," ''New York Times'' (May 29, 1991), p. C14.&lt;/ref&gt; Exhibitions highlights items from the library's collections and keep the name of the library before the public, attracting new and potential donations.&lt;ref&gt;Frank C. Campbell, "How the Music Division of the New York Public Library Grew-A Memoir, part 4," ''Notes'' vol. 38, no. 1 (September 1981), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the late 1990s, NYPL's exhibitions program has added online exhibitions.  Online exhibitions serve as an extension of physical exhibitions, adding more material or allowing a greater depth of exploration.

== Public programs ==
Public programs are free of charge and take place in the 202-seat Bruno Walter Auditorium located on the lower level.  The auditorium is used several times a week for musical performances, film screenings and lectures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nypl.org/locations/tid/55/node/62837 About Public Programs at the Library for the Performing Arts].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Napis na latarni 'Nur fur Deutsche'.png|thumb|right|''Nur für Deutsche'' graffiti on the base of a lamppost in occupied Poland]]
The slogan '''''Nur für Deutsche''''' ([[English language|English]]: "Only for [[german people|German]]s") was during [[World War II]], in many German-occupied countries, a [[Racism|racialist]] slogan indicating that certain establishments and transportation were reserved for Germans.  Signs bearing the slogan were posted at entrances to parks, cafes, cinemas, theaters and other facilities.

==History==

In [[occupation of Poland|German-occupied Poland]], [[racial segregation]] was nearly complete. In streetcars and trains, the first car was usually reserved for German administrative and military personnel, Nazi party members, and German civilians.  Other nationalities were to use the remaining car(s).

In [[Polish partisans|Polish partisan]] parlance, toxic or otherwise undrinkable [[moonshine]] was jocularly called "nur für Deutsche".  

Partisans were also fond of painting the words "nur für Deutsche" on graveyard fences or street lampposts (a reference to [[hanging]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:hoWXZoLf9DwJ:archiwum.wiz.pl/1999/99092700.asp&amp;hl=pl&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=3&amp;gl=pl "OKUPACYJNA CODZIENNOŚĆ"], by KATARZYNA GRACZYKOWSKA, (also in [http://archiwum.wiz.pl/1999/99092700.asp the archive] of ''Wiedza i Życie''  no. 9, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

They are primarily left-[[branching (linguistics)|branching]], or [[head-final]], with [[Head (linguistics)|heads]] often found at the end of their [[phrase]]s, with a resulting tendency to have the [[adjective]]s before [[noun]]s, to place [[adposition]]s after the [[noun phrase]]s they govern (in other words, to use [[postposition]]s), to put [[relative clause]]s before their [[referent]]s, and to place auxiliary verbs after the action verb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

A language that moves the verb or [[verb phrase]] more than the object will have surface VO word order, and a language which moves the object more than the verb or verb phrase will have surface OV word order.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20577">'''Occupational segregation''' is the distribution of [[worker]]s across and within [[Job|occupation]]s, based upon [[demographic]] characteristics, most often [[gender]].{{sfn|Bergmann|1981}}  Occupational segregation levels differ on a basis of perfect segregation and integration.  Perfect segregation occurs where any given occupation employs only one group.  Perfect integration, on the other hand, occurs where each group holds the same proportion of positions in an occupation as it holds in the labor force.{{sfn|Weeden|2007}}

Many scholars, such as Biblarz et al., argue that occupational segregation is most likely caused by [[sexism|gender-based discrimination]]{{sfn|Biblarz|Bengtson|Bucur|1996}} that often occurs in patterns, either horizontally (across occupations) or vertically (within the hierarchy of occupations). Both of these contribute to the [[gender pay gap]].{{sfn|Cotter et al.|1997}}

==Types==

===Horizontal===
Horizontal segregation refers to differences in the number of people of each gender present across occupations.{{sfn|Charles|2003}} Horizontal segregation is likely to be increased by post-industrial restructuring of the economy ([[post-industrial society]]), in which the expansion of service industries has called for many women to enter the workforce. The millions of housewives who entered the economy during post-industrial restructuring primarily entered into service sector jobs where they could work part-time and having flexible hours. While these options are often appealing to mothers, who are often responsible for the [[care work]] of their children and their homes,{{sfn|Charles|2003}} they are also unfortunately most available in lower-paying and lower status occupations. The idea that nurses and teachers are often pictured as women whereas doctors and lawyers are often assumed to be men are examples of how highly engrained horizontal segregation is in our society.

===Vertical===
The term ''vertical segregation'' describes men's domination of the highest status jobs in both traditionally male and traditionally female occupations.{{sfn|Charles|2003}} Colloquially, the existence of vertical segregation is referred to as allowing men to ride in a "glass escalator" through which women must watch as men surpass them on the way to the top positions.&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, Karrie Ann and Adam Isaiah Green. 2008. "'Revisiting the Glass Escalator: The Case of Gender Segregation in a Female Dominated Occupation." Social Problems 55(2): 271-299.&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, the more occupational segregation present in a country, the less vertical segregation there is because women have a better chance of obtaining the highest positions in a given occupation as their share of employment in that particular occupation increases.{{sfn|Watts|2005}}

Vertical segregation can be somewhat difficult to measure across occupations because it refers to hierarchies within individual occupations. For example, the category of Education Professionals, (a category in the Australian Standard Classification of Occupations, Second Edition), is broken down into "School Teachers," "University and Vocational Education Teachers," and "Miscellaneous Education Professionals." These categories are then further broken down into subcategories. While these categories aptly describe the divisions within education, they are not comparable to the hierarchical categories within other occupations, and thus make comparisons of levels of vertical segregation quite difficult.{{sfn|Watts|2005}}

==Maintenance mechanisms==

===Self-selection===
Some women self-select out of higher status positions, choosing instead to have more time to spend at home and with their families. According to Sarah Damaske, this choice is often made because high status positions do not allow time for the heavy domestic workload that many women expect to take on due to the gendered division of labor in the home.{{sfn|Charles|2003}} Working class women, in particular, also sometimes self-select out of more time-intensive or higher -status positions in order to maintain the traditional gender hierarchy and household accord.{{sfn|Damaske|2004}}

===Educational disparities===
Human capital explanations are those that argue that an individual's and a group's occupational and economic success can be at least partially attributed to accumulated abilities developed through formal and informal education and experiences.{{sfn|Mincer|1891}} Human capital explanations for occupational segregation, then, posit that a difference in educational levels of men and women is responsible for persistent occupational segregation. Contrary to this theory, however, over past 40 years, women's educational attainment has outpaced men's. One area of education that might play a substantial role in occupational segregation, however, is the dearth of women in science and mathematics.{{sfn|Haveman|Beresford|2012}} STEM fields tend to be pipelines to higher paying jobs. Therefore, the lack of women in higher paying jobs might be partially because they do not pursue science and mathematics in school. This can be seen in areas such as finance, which is very mathematics heavy and is also a very popular field for those who eventually rise to high status positions in the private sector. This choice, like others, is often a personal preference or made because of the cultural idea that women are not as good as men at mathematics.{{sfn|Haveman|Beresford|2012}}

===Work experience disparities===
Human capital explanations also posit that men tend to rise to higher positions than women because of a disparity in work experience between the genders. Indeed, the gap between men and women's tenure rises with age, and female college graduates are more likely than males to interrupt their careers to raise children.{{sfn|Haveman|Beresford|2012}} Such choices may also be attributed to the gendered division of labor which holds women primarily responsible for domestic duties.

===Preferences===
Human capital explanations posit additionally that men are more likely than women to preference their work life over their family life. However, the General Social Survey found that men were only slightly less likely than women to value short hours, and that preferences for particular job characteristics depended mostly on age, education, race, and other characteristics rather than on gender.{{sfn|Haveman|Beresford|2012}} In addition, other research has shown that men and women likely hold endogenous job preferences, meaning that their preferences are due to the jobs they hold and those they have held in the past rather than related inherently to gender. After taking into consideration men and women's jobs, there is no difference in their job preferences. Men and women engaged in similar types of work have similar levels of commitment to work and display other similar preferences.{{sfn|Haveman|Beresford|2012}}

===Job search strategies===
According to sociologists Hanson and Pratt, men and women employ different strategies in their job searches that play a role in occupational segregation. These differing strategies are influenced by power relations in the household, the gendered nature of social life, and women's domestic responsibilities. The last factor, in particular, leads women to prioritize the geographical proximity of paid employment when searching for a job. In addition, most people have been found to find their jobs through informal contacts. The gendered nature of social life leads women to have networks with smaller geographical reach than men. Thus, the location of women in female-dominated occupations which are lower-status and lower pay is the result of "severe day-to-day time constraints" rather than a conscious and long-term choice made that would be able to maximize pay and prestige.{{sfn|Hanson|Pratt|1991}}

== Gender ==

===Gender pay gap===
{{Main|Gender pay gap}}
Women in female-dominated jobs pay two penalties: the average wage of their jobs is lower than that in comparable male-dominated jobs, and they earn less relative to men in the same jobs.  In addition, women's wages are negatively affected by the percentage of females in a job, but men's wages are essentially unaffected.{{sfn|Cohen|Bianchi|1999}}
The crowding hypothesis postulates that occupational segregation lowers all women's earnings as a result of women's exclusion from primarily male occupations and segregation into a number of predominantly female-dominated occupations.{{sfn|Cotter et al.|1997}} Given that feminine skills are traditionally rewarded less both in salary and prestige, the crowding of women into certain occupations makes these occupations valued less in both pay and prestige.

Crowding is found to be alleviated through macro-changes in occupational segregation. Teaching, for example, at least in recent generations, is traditionally a female- dominated profession. However, when positions open up for women in business and other high-earning occupations, school boards must raise the salaries of potential teachers to attract candidates. This is an example of how even women in traditionally female-dominated professions still benefit salary-wise from the gendered integration of the market.{{sfn|Cotter et al.|1997}}

=== Gendered division of labor ===
{{Main|Sexual division of labour}}
The gendered division of labor helps to explain the hierarchy of power across gender identity, class, race, ethnicity, and sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mills|first=Mary Beth|date=|title=Gender and Inequality in the Global Labor Force|url=|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|volume=32|pages=41-62|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Socialist feminists]] contribute to this ideology through a Marxist frame of [[alienated labor]] and the [[means of production]]. [[Heidi Hartmann]] emphasized the gendered division of labor as patriarchal control over women's labor. Wally Saccombe suggested the mode of production should become a unity of production and reproduction, in which women's reproductive abilities are viewed as a valuable source of labor or income.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Burris|first=Val|date=|title=The Dialectic of Women's Oppression: Notes of the Relation Between Capitalism and Patriarchy|url=|journal=Berkeley Journal of Sociology|volume=27|pages=51-74|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;The "wages for housework" movement in the late 1970s showcased the importance of gender inequality in the workplace. Socialist feminists critiqued the exploitation of women's household and reproductive labor, since it was not viewed as a commodity that deserved payment in the market economy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bergeron|first=Suzanne|date=|title=Formal, Informal, and Care Economies|url=|journal=Oxford Handbook of Feminist Theory|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Women often experience working a "double day" or "second shift" when they go to a wage-earning job and then come home to take care of children and the home&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Feminisms Matter|last=Bromley|first=Victoria|publisher=University of Toronto Press|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Measurement==
Occupational segregation is measured using [[Duncan Segregation Index|Duncan's D]] (or the [[index of dissimilarity]]), which serves as a measure of dissimilarity between two distributions.  D has to be calculated first:

# Identify N different occupations.
# Calculate the percentage of men (or other ascribed category) who work in each of the occupations and the percentage of women who work in each occupation.  Give men and women a variable name (m&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; could = men, w&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; could = women).
# Duncan's D is calculated using this formula: {{math|D{{=}}½ε&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;{{!}}m&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-w&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;{{!}}}} {{clarify|date=April 2012}}{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}
#*It is important to note that Duncan's D uses percentages.  So in a given occupation, the number of men (or women) in that occupation should be divided by the total number of men (or women) in all of the occupations.  For example:  You may have 10 men who are nurses out of 600 total men.  The value for the occupation of male nurses should be 10/600, or .0166.

==In the United States{{anchor|Occupational_segregation_in_the_United_States}}==
Over the last century in the United States, there has been a surprising stability of segregation-index scores, which measure the level of occupational segregation of the labor market.{{sfn|Charles|2003}}  There were declines in occupational segregation in the 1970s and 1980s, as technologies that made the care work of the home quicker and easier allowed more women time to enter the workforce.{{sfn|Cohen|2004}} However, occupational segregation remains a fixed element of the United States workforce today.
As recently as 1996, it has been found that gender occupational segregation over the past three generations has not decreased. In one study, grown women working in the 1980s were likely to have faced the same occupational segregation faced by their mothers working in the 1960s and their grandmothers working in the 1940s.{{sfn|Biblarz|Bengtson|Bucur|1996}}

==Solutions==
Gender egalitarian cultural principles, or changes in traditional gender norms, are one possible solution to occupational segregation in that they reduce discrimination, affect women's self-evaluations, and support structural changes. Horizontal segregation, however, is more resistant to change from simply modern egalitarian pressures.{{sfn|Charles|2003}} Changes in norms may reinforce the impact of occupational integration in that once people see women in traditionally male-dominated occupations, their expectations about women in the labor market might be changed.{{sfn|Cotter et al.|1997}}

Some scholars, such as Haveman and Beresford, therefore argue that any policies aimed at reducing occupational inequality must focus on culture changes.{{sfn|Haveman|Beresford|2012}} According to Haveman and Beresford, people in the United States have historically tended to reject policies that only support one group (unless that group is them). Therefore, effective policies for limiting occupational segregation must aim to provide benefits across groups. Therefore, policies that aim at capping work hours for salaried workers or mandate on-site employer sponsored childcare might be most effective.{{sfn|Haveman|Beresford|2012}}

In addition, the more occupational integration that occurs, the more women are in the positions to make powerful decisions affecting occupational segregation. If the overall market becomes less segregated, those who make personnel decisions in traditionally female-dominated occupations will have to make jobs, even higher status jobs, more attractive to women to retain them.  School boards, for example, will have to appoint more women to department head positions and other positions of authority in order to retain women workers, whereas those jobs might previously have gone to men.{{sfn|Cotter et al.|1997}}

==On the basis of sexual orientation==
In addition to gender, sexual orientation can also be a significant basis for occupational segregation: there is a  disproportionately high number of gay and lesbian workers in certain occupations. Research shows that gay men are more likely to be in female-majority occupations than are heterosexual men, and lesbians are more represented in male-majority occupations than are heterosexual women, but even after accounting for this tendency, common to both gay men and lesbians is a propensity to concentrate in occupations that provide task independence or require social perceptiveness, or both.{{sfn|Tilcsik|Anteby|Knight|2015}}

'''Pat Patterson''' (born '''Pierre Clermont''' on January 19, 1941) is a [[Canadians|Canadian]]–[[Americans|American]] retired [[professional wrestling|professional wrestler]]. He is currently employed by the [[professional wrestling promotion]] [[WWE]] as a creative consultant. The inaugural [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|WWE Intercontinental Champion]] and creator of the [[Royal Rumble]] match, Patterson was inducted into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]] [[WWE Hall of Fame (1996)|class of 1996]].&lt;ref name=wwebio&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/superstars/patpatterson|title=Pat Patterson|publisher=[[WWE]]|work=[[WWE]].com|accessdate=August 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Legends&gt;{{cite book|title=WWE Legends|last=Solomon|first=Brian|pages=203–208|publisher=[[Pocket Books]]|year=2006|isbn=978-0-7434-9033-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OWOW&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/p/pat-patterson.html|title=Pat Patterson's profile|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=2011-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has been described by journalist [[Dave Meltzer]] as "[[Vince McMahon]]'s right-hand man" and "one of the chief architects of the [[WWE]], playing an integral role in helping it [[1980s professional wrestling boom|become a global phenomenon]]."&lt;ref name="MolinaroMeltzer2002"/&gt;

== Early life ==
Patterson was born into an impoverished [[French language|French-speaking]] family in the [[Ville-Marie, Montreal|Ville-Marie]] [[arrondissement]] of [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], Canada in 1941. He began training to wrestle at the age of 14 at Loisirs Saint Jean Baptiste.&lt;ref name="Pat2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LapradeHebert2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Pat Laprade|author2=Bertrand Hebert|title=Mad Dogs, Midgets and Screw Jobs: The Untold Story of How Montreal Shaped the World of Wrestling|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ey8bluWM_m4C&amp;pg=PA1862|date=1 February 2013|publisher=ECW Press|isbn=978-1-77090-296-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Patterson is a [[Roman Catholic]], and was an [[altar boy]]. He expressed an interest to a priest in becoming one himself, but was advised it would not have worked, because he was "too adventurous".&lt;ref name=Legends/&gt;

== Professional wrestling career ==

In 1963, Patterson wrestled for promotions in Texas, Arizona and Oklahoma as part of a talent exchange organized by Owen.&lt;ref name="Pat2016"/&gt;

After Stevens turned [[Face (professional wrestling)|face]] in the late 1960s, he had a [[Feud (professional wrestling)|feud]] with the heel Patterson, culminating in the 1970s [[Professional wrestling match types#Last Man Standing match|Texas Death match]], in which Stevens won the title from Patterson.

In 1970 and 1971, Patterson wore a [[Wrestling mask|mask]] during his matches, and would cheat by placing a foreign object under the mask to add power to his [[head butt]]s.

=== World Wrestling Entertainment/WWE ===

==== North American Champion (1979) ====
In 1979, Patterson debuted in the [[WWE|World Wrestling Entertainment]]  (WWE), working as a [[Heel (wrestling)|heel]], under the tutelage of manager [[Ernie Roth|The Grand Wizard]]. As a villain, Patterson's primary feuds were with then [[WWF North American Championship|WWF North American Champion]] [[Ted DiBiase]] and [[WWE World Heavyweight Championship|WWF Heavyweight Champion]] [[Bob Backlund]]. During a television taping on June 19 in [[Allentown, Pennsylvania]], Patterson defeated DiBiase for the WWF North American Championship by using a pair of brass knuckles to knock out DiBiase. Patterson was unsuccessful, however, in winning the WWF Heavyweight Championship from Backlund.

==== Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion (1979–1980) ====
In September 1979, the WWE would introduce the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship]],  a secondary championship for its midcard wrestlers. Patterson was crowned the company's first Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion after an alleged tournament held in [[Rio de Janeiro]]. While Patterson's tournament "victory" is widely listed in wrestling title and match histories, the tournament itself never actually took place. Patterson's apocryphal title victory would later become something of an inside joke during Patterson's on-screen tenure as one of [[Vince McMahon]]'s "stooges". The fictional tournament was also later profiled in-depth on WWE.com as an [[April Fool's]] joke. On November 8, Patterson dropped the North American title to [[Seiji Sakaguchi]].

It was during Patterson's reign as champion that he turned face, after a botched attempt by the Grand Wizard to "sell" Patterson's contract to [[Lou Albano|"Captain" Lou Albano]] for $100,000; Albano's protégés, the Wild Samoans, attacked Patterson after he cut a promo insulting Albano. Patterson held the Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship until April 21, 1980 when he was defeated by [[Ken Patera]] in [[New York City|New York City, New York]]. The match ended in controversial fashion after Patterson placed his right leg on the ropes just before the three count was made.

==== Various feuds and retirement (1980–1984) ====
On May 4, 1981, Patterson's feud with [[Sgt. Slaughter]] culminated in an [[Professional wrestling match types#Hardcore-based variations|Bootcamp match]] in [[Madison Square Garden]]. The match was voted [[Wrestling Observer Newsletter awards#Match of the Year|Match of the Year]] by the ''[[Wrestling Observer Newsletter]]''.&lt;ref name="LapradeHebert2013"/&gt;

==== Backstage roles (1984–1997) ====
Patterson began doing color commentary in 1980 with Vince McMahon, calling ''[[WWF Championship Wrestling]]'' from 1980-84. While Patterson was a face commentator when partnered with [[Gorilla Monsoon]] and [[Vince McMahon]], he hosted a heel interview segment for French WWF broadcasts known as "Le [[brunch]] de Pat", where he would politely ask questions in [[English language|English]] but furtively mock his face guests in [[French language|French]]. Patterson was on commentary with Monsoon when [[Hulk Hogan]] defeated [[The Iron Sheik]] for the world heavyweight championship, as well as for when Sheik defeated [[Bob Backlund]]. Patterson was also calling the action when [[Jimmy Snuka]] jumped off the steel cage and splashed [[Don Muraco]] in [[Madison Square Garden]] in 1983.

Patterson retired from wrestling in 1984.  Although retired, Patterson continued to occasionally wrestle. On January 26, 1985 he wrestled Nikolai Volkoff in a losing effort in a house show in Cincinnati, OH.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/85.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The following month he teamed with Andre the Giant at a pair of house shows in Canada and defeated Ken Patera and Big John Studd. A year later he made another appearance, this time in a battle royal in Montreal on February 24, 1987.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/86.htm&lt;/ref&gt; He also appeared in a battle royal at a house show in Buffalo, NY on December 27. Patterson made a handful of additional appearances in Montreal in 1987, wrestling as a heel (while remaining a face or neutral backstage official in the United States and elsewhere in Canada). His most notable appearance was a win over the up-and-coming [[Brutus Beefcake]] on August 10 &lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/87.htm&lt;/ref&gt; His final match would come three weeks later in Montreal as he fell in defeat to Beefcake.

He began working backstage as a [[Road Agent (Wrestling)|road agent]] and right-hand man to WWF promoter Vince McMahon, and is credited with inventing and [[Booker (professional wrestling)|booking]] the Royal Rumble match. In the late 1990s, he also worked in the talent-relations department.&lt;ref name="MolinaroMeltzer2002"&gt;{{cite book|author1=John F. Molinaro|author2=Dave Meltzer|author3=Jeff Marek|title=Top 100 pro wrestlers of all time|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JN_ZAAAAMAAJ|date=December 2002|publisher=Winding Stair Press|pages=197–198}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ellison, Lillian|title=The Fabulous Moolah: First Goddess of the Squared Circle|year=2003|isbn=978-0-06-001258-8|publisher=ReaganBooks|page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his retirement, Patterson also worked as a WWF referee. He was selected as the in-ring referee for the main event at the first ever [[WrestleMania]] at [[Madison Square Garden]] on [[WrestleMania I|March 31, 1985]], a well as the main event of [[WrestleMania XI]].

In 1992, Patterson was accused of [[sexual harassment]] by former [[ring announcer]] Murray Hodgson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Irv Muchnick|title=Wrestling Babylon: Piledriving Tales of Drugs, Sex, Death, and Scandal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gMVg5JWqh3YC&amp;pg=PA66|year=2007|publisher=ECW Press|isbn=978-1-55490-286-6|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was briefly released from the company until the charges were dropped, when he was promptly rehired.

==== "Stooge" (1997–2000) ====
{{see also|The Corporation (professional wrestling)|The McMahon-Helmsley Faction}}
In 1997, Patterson, along with [[Gerald Brisco]], became comedy heels as the on-screen [[Stooge (comedian)|stooges]] of Vince McMahon, assisting their boss in his rivalries with [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]], [[Mick Foley|Mankind]] and [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]]. Patterson and Brisco were among the founding members of [[The Corporation (professional wrestling)|The Corporation]]. In order to mock [[Hulk Hogan]], they used "Real American" as their [[Music in professional wrestling|entrance music]] and parodied Hogan's flexing routine as they approached the ring. on the May 18, 1998 episode of Raw, Patterson and Brisco competed in a 2 on 1 Street Fight against Stone Cold that ened in a no contest when Vince Mcmahon and [[Mick Foley|Dude Love]] attacked Stone Cold.

Later in 1999, the two became entangled with the [[McMahon-Helmsley Faction]]. On the December 16, 1999 episode of ''SmackDown'', Patterson and Brisco helped [[Test (wrestler)|Test]], who had been injured by [[D-Generation X]]. [[Triple H]] and [[Stephanie McMahon]] then forced Patterson and Brisco to compete for  the [[WWF Tag Team Championship]] against [[The New Age Outlaws]] or be fired. Patterson and Brisco lost the match. In 2000, Patterson and Brisco joined Triple and Stephanie. On the May 8 episode of Raw, Patterson, [[Road Dogg]] and [[Sean Waltman|X-Pac]] lost a 3 on 1 handicap to [[Rikishi (wrestler)|Rikishi]]  after Patterson hit Rikishi with a chair afterwards Patterson gave him a stinkface. On June 12, 2000, when the Faction unmasked [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]], Patterson photographed Kane's "hideously scarred" face, and threatened to "expose him to the world" if he did not comply. Kane was forced to wrestle [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] (then his ally) in a [[Professional wrestling match types#No disqualification match|No Holds Barred match]]. When Patterson's [[Photographic film|film]] did not develop properly, Kane turned on the Faction.

On June 19, 2000 Patterson helped Brisco win the perpetually contested [[WWE Hardcore Championship|WWF Hardcore Champion]] from [[Crash Holly]] but during the victory celebration turned on his ally, blinding him with [[Champagne (wine)|champagne]] and then breaking a second bottle over Brisco's head, and pinning the (kayfabe) unconscious champion. Brisco pursued Patterson into the women's locker room, where Patterson was hiding in drag. Subsequently, Vince McMahon scheduled them to fight over Hardcore Championship in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Evening Gown match|Evening Gown match]] at [[King of the Ring (2000)|King of the Ring 2000]]; in the course of the match, [[Crash Holly]] attacked both men and pinned Patterson to become Hardcore Champion.&lt;ref name="DixonFurious2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=James Dixon|author2=Arnold Furious|author3=Lee Maughan|author4=Bob Dahlstrom|author5=Rick Ashley|title=The Complete WWF Video Guide Volume V|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iZqdBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA90|date=3 April 2014|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=978-1-291-81693-8|pages=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Undelson"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ben Undelson|title=Fiction.

On The June 21 episode of Raw, Patterson and Brisco's match with Shane and Vince Mcmahon ened in a no contest when The Mean Street Posse ran in and attacked them.

==== Backstage roles (2000–2004, 2005–present) ====
The Intercontinental Championship, unified with the [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Championship]] on October 20, 2002, was resurrected on May 18, 2003 at [[Judgment Day (2003)|Judgment Day]] in a battle royal. Patterson, as the first ever Intercontinental Champion, was at ringside to present the belt to the victor. [[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]] eliminated [[Christian Cage|Christian]] for the win, but the referee was unconscious. As Patterson attempted to give the championship belt to Booker T, Christian attacked him, stole the Intercontinental Championship belt and used it to knock out Booker T. The referee then recovered and awarded the match to Christian.

In October 2004, Patterson retired from World Wrestling Entertainment. Patterson returned to WWE in a limited capacity in May 2005. While he is now retired as a producer for WWE, he still acts as a creative consultant.&lt;ref name="Almanac"/&gt; At [[WWE Breaking Point|Breaking Point]], Patterson made an appearance in his hometown of Montreal in an in-ring segment with [[Dolph Ziggler]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1900">'''''R v Shelembe'''''&lt;ref&gt;1955 (4) SA 410 (N).&lt;/ref&gt; is an important case in [[South African criminal law]], heard in the Natal Provincial Division, by Selke AJP and Kennedy J, on August 22, 1955. DJH Niehaus appeared for the accused, at the request of the court; EA Logie appeared for the Crown. Judgment came down on August 30.

The case revolved around a charge of malicious injury to property, where the accused, endeavouring to escape from a room into which he had broken, broke in a two a locked door. Since the accused had also been charged and convicted of housebreaking with intent to commit a crime to the prosecutor unknown, the question arose: Was there a splitting of charges? The court held that breaking into a room and breaking out of it are two separate and distinct incidents. There had, therefore, not been a splitting of charges.

== Facts ==
The accused had been charged and convicted on two counts:

# housebreaking with intent to commit a crime to the prosecutor unknown; and
# malicious injury to property.

The evidence showed that he had broken into a room where there were a number of persons sleeping, and that, when they were aroused by his presence, the accused, apparently in an effort to escape, had broken in two the door, which had been locked.

== Judgment ==
On a review, the court held that the accused's conduct amounted to malicious injury to property, and that there had not been a splitting of charges, as the accused's breaking out was separate from the breaking-in in point of time and motive; they were separate and distinct incidents.

The '''Richmond Vampire''' (also called locally the Hollywood Vampire) is a recent [[urban legend]] from [[Richmond, Virginia]].

Local residents claim that the mausoleum of [[William Wortham Pool|W. W. Pool]] (Dated 1913) in [[Hollywood Cemetery (Richmond, Virginia)|Hollywood Cemetery]] holds the remains of a vampire. Supposedly Pool was run out of England in the 1800s for being a vampire. Oral legends to this effect were circulating by the 1960s. They may be influenced by the architecture of the tomb, which has both Masonic and ancient Egyptian elements, and double Ws looking like fangs. Because this cemetery is adjacent to [[Virginia Commonwealth University]], the story became popular among students, especially from the 1980s onward.&lt;ref&gt;[http://richmondmagazine.com/arts-entertainment/the-hat/richmonds-reputed-nosferatu/ Harry Kollatz Jr., "W.W. Pool: Richmond's Reputed Nosferatu", ''Richmond Magazine'', October 30, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; It was first mentioned in print in the student newspaper [[The Commonwealth Times|Commonwealth Times]] in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dig.library.vcu.edu/cdm/compoundobject/collection/com/id/2249/rec/4 Gary F. Curtis, "Time Flies in 'Perfect Jewel'", ''Commonwealth Times'', April 30, 1976]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past few years, the vampire story has been combined with the collapse of the [[Chesapeake and Ohio Railway|Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad]]'s [[Church Hill Tunnel]] under [[Church Hill]], a neighborhood of eastern Richmond, Virginia, which buried several workers alive on October 2, 1925. This part of the story showed up online in 2001 and was first reported in print in 2007 in ''Haunted Richmond: The Shadows of Shockoe''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=PtC31Ek28o0C&amp;lpg=PA63&amp;dq=The%20Collapse%20of%20Richmond's%20Church%20Hill%20Tunnel&amp;pg=PA63#v=onepage&amp;q=vampire&amp;f=false Link no longer works Scott Bergman, Sandi Bergman, ''Haunted Richmond: The Shadows of Shockoe'' (History Press, 2007)]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to this newer story, the tunneling awakened an ancient evil that lived under Church Hill and brought the tunnel crashing down on the workers. Rescue teams found an unearthly blood-covered creature with jagged teeth and skin hanging from its muscular body crouching over one of the victims. The creature escaped from the cave-in and raced toward the [[James River]]. Pursued by a group of men, the creature took refuge in Hollywood Cemetery, where it disappeared in a mausoleum built into a hillside bearing the name W. W. Pool.

According to Gregory Maitland, an urban legend and [[folklore]] researcher with the [[Paranormal Research Groups|paranormal research groups]] Night Shift and the Virginia Ghosts &amp; Haunting Research Society, the "creature" that escaped the tunnel collapse was actually the 28-year-old railroad fireman, Benjamin F. Mosby (1896-1925), who had been shoveling coal into the firebox of a steam locomotive of a work train with no shirt on when the cave-in occurred and the boiler ruptured. Mosby's upper body was horribly scalded and several of his teeth were broken before he made his way through the opening of the tunnel. Witnesses reported he was in shock and layers of his skin were hanging from his body. He died later at [[Grace Hospital (Richmond, Virginia)|Grace Hospital]] and was buried at Hollywood Cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wtvr.com/2013/10/31/holmberg-how-a-vampire-came-to-haunt-a-richmond-cemetery/ Mark Holmberg,"How a vampire came to haunt a Richmond cemetery", WTVR (October 31, 2013)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lorepodcast.com/episodes/33 Aaron Mahnke, "A Dead End", ''Lore Podcast: Episode 33'' (May 2, 2016)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20010929154332/http://www.virginiaghosts.com/vampire_update.htm VGHRS, "Strange Creatures of VA: The Richmond Vampire" (September 29, 2001)]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Save Outdoor Sculpture! (logo).jpg|thumb|222px|right|The SOS! Logo]]

'''Save Outdoor Sculpture! (SOS!)''' is a community-based effort to identify, document, and conserve outdoor sculpture in the [[United States of America|United States]]. By fostering awareness and appreciation, SOS! aims to advocate proper care of a nationwide public resource. 

The SOS! project may be viewed as a precursor of community-generated or "crowd-sourced" social media-driven initiatives.  

==History==
Save Outdoor Sculpture! was initiated by [[Heritage Preservation|Heritage Preservation: The National Institute of Conservation]] in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications/newsletters/22_2/news_in_cons1.html|title=Save Outdoor Sculpture!: A Community-Based Conservation Program, Getty Conservation Institute Newsletter 22.2 (Summer 2007)|accessdate=2009-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus far over 7,000 volunteers have cataloged and assessed the condition of over 30,000 publicly accessible statues and monuments installed outside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritagepreservation.org/Programs/Sos/aboutsos.htm|title=Save Outdoor Sculpture! About Page|accessdate=2009-04-25|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108041805/http://www.heritagepreservation.org/Programs/SOS/aboutsos.htm|archivedate=2009-01-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Smithsonian Museum of American Art has become an active partner in the SOS! project, and SOS! material is available online as part of the Inventory of American Sculpture at the Smithsonian American Art Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siris.si.edu/|title=The Inventory is part of the Smithsonian Institution Research Information System|accessdate=2009-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; This partnership has allowed the database that contains these records to be viewable online, and [http://sirismm.si.edu/siris/ariquickstart.htm searchable by state], [http://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?session=1HD764961858K.5006&amp;profile=ariall&amp;menu=search&amp;submenu=Browse&amp;ts=1337649618636 artist, subject or title].  The records in the Inventory pertain to all sculpture in the United States and a few outlying islands that have thus far been identified.

==Educational programs==
A primary objective  of SOS! is to educate, and a number of programs have been created for children. For example, SOS! has partnered with the [[Girl Scouts of the USA]] to create a Girl Scout patch&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritagepreservation.org/PDFS/gsupdate.pdf|title=Save Outdoor Sculpture! Girl Scout Patch Program|accessdate=2009-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; for scouts who participate in the project.

'''search.ch''' is a [[search engine]] and [[web portal]] for [[Switzerland]]. It was founded in 1995 &lt;ref name="founding" /&gt; by Rudolf Räber and Bernhard Seefeld as a regional search engine. In the following years many other services were added, such as a phonebook in 1999, a free [[Short message service|SMS]] service in 2000 (now reduced to only one free SMS per week).

The search technology is home grown. The user can restrict his search to regions of Switzerland, such as a [[cantons of Switzerland|canton]] or a [[city]]. The [[web crawler]] looks only at sites in the [[.ch]] and [[.li]] [[top-level domain]]s and a number of automatically and manually updated list of Swiss websites on other domains. The index is updated weekly.

'''Teodoro''' Francesco Maria Gasparo '''Correr''' (12 December 1750, [[Venice]] - 20 February 1830, Venice) was a Venetian abbot and art collector, most notable as the founder of the [[Museo Correr]].

==Life==
The Correr family was an old patrician family in Venice. Teodoro's father was Giacomo and his wife, the Neapolitan noblewoman Anna Maria Petagno, daughter of Andrea, from the princely family of Trebisaccia. Teodoro was the first of nine brothers and aged ten was sent to school with the Teatini at San Nicola da Tolentino. He only stayed there a year before moving to the San Cipriano college on [[Murano]], which he left aged twenty-one in 1771. Even as a youth he became interested in collecting objects and artworks relating to Venice and its history.

When they reached twenty-five all Venetian patricians were required to take up minor magistracies and Correr reluctantly followed suit. In 1775 he entered the High Council and the same year was elected 'savio' to the Orders. The following year he was made provider of the Pompe and in 1778 he was re-elected 'savio' and made provider of the Comun. In 1787 he was elected [[Podestà]] and captain of [[Treviso]], but he immediately gained dispensation from taking up this office. In 1788 he became podestà procurator at [[Verona]]. He only half-heartedly held public office and finally eschewed it altogether by becoming an abbot in 1789. He even declined to serve in the Civic Guard on health grounds during the [[Fall of the Republic of Venice]] in 1797 and instead paid a cash fine in monthly instalments.

After his parents died, he was able to commit himself to collecting full-time, though he had already begun forming a collection of paintings, relics and documents relating to Venetian history whilst still a young man. His collecting peaked during the years immediately after the Republic's fall and the resulting decision by many patrician families to sell off their whole art collections. Despite his limited means, he used his connections to other patrician families to buy and exchange paintings, coins, archaeology. majolica, glassware, books, engravings, gems, enamels, medals, curiosities, weapons, antiquities, bronzes and manuscripts. He installed his growing collection in his family palazzo in the San Giovanni Decollato district of the Santa Croce [[sestiere]].

[[File:Palazzo correr.jpg|thumb|Entrance to the [[Museo Correr]].]]
In old age he wondered how to ensure his collection stayed together after his death, rather than being dispersed by his brother. He wrote his will on 1 January 1830, stipulating:
{{quote|his house ... by S. Giovanni Decollato, where the Museum must be kept, must take on the name of the Correr Collection; it is to be open to the public at least two days a week ... [he leaves] all his movable and immovable belongings, actions, reasons, credits to fund this public institution, which he puts under the protection of the City of Venice}}
This marked the beginning of Venice's city museums and formed the foundation stone for the current museum network in the city. Correr's collection formed the nucleus for the present-day Museo Correr, which moved in 1879 to the neighbouring [[Fondaco dei Turchi]] (now the Museo di Storia Naturale) then to the former Palazzo Reale (or Procuratie Nuovissime) on [[Piazza San Marco]] in 1922, where it still remains.

'''''The Soap Opera Encyclopedia''''' is a 1985 reference book by '''Christopher Schemering''' which assembles comprehensive information about all [[daytime television|daytime]] and [[prime time]] [[soap opera]]s broadcast up to the date of publication. It was revised and reprinted in 1987 and 1988, but is currently out of print.

''The Soap Opera Encyclopedia'' features commentary, analysis and criticism of "every daytime and prime-time television soap opera broadcast on the three major networks, as well as a selection of syndicated, cable, and foreign efforts."&lt;ref name="1985 Notes"&gt;{{cite book |last=Schemering |first=Christopher |title=The Soap Opera Encyclopedia |date= September 1985|publisher=[[Ballantine Books]] |isbn=0-345-32459-5  |chapter=Notes and Acknowledgements }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also discusses background, significant storylines and impact of each program, and lists performers and characters. Schemering also includes a "Short History of Television Soap Opera," as well as profiles of major performers, writers and producers in the genre in a section entitled "Who's Who in Soap Opera." Finally, the book contains 30 pages of photos from various programs.

Published in a time before the [[internet]], the ''Encyclopedia'' was a primary source of background information and commentary on soap opera; it and Schemering have been quoted in various articles, books and web pages. It was revised and reprinted in 1987 ({{ISBN|0-345-35344-7}}) and 1988.

According to the ''Encyclopedia'', Schemering "spent fifteen years collecting memorabilia and information about the soap opera phenomenon" and wrote a syndicated column on the genre.&lt;ref name="1985 Back"&gt;{{cite book |last=Schemering |date=1985 |title=Soap Opera Encyclopedia |chapter=Back cover}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also a regular contributor to ''[[The Washington Post|The Washington Post Book World]]'' and had published film and television articles in ''[[The New Republic]]'', ''[[USA Today]]'', the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', the ''[[New York Daily News]]'' and other publications.&lt;ref name="1985 Back"/&gt; Schemering is also the author of ''[[Guiding Light: A 50th Anniversary Celebration]]'' (1986).

In '''''Volks NO v Robinson and Others''''', an important case in South African [[South African family law|family]] and [[South African succession law|succession]] law, a Mrs. Robinson had been in a permanent [[Significant other|life partnership]] with one Mr. Shandling. They had lived together as husband and wife from 1985 until Mr Shandling’s death in 2001. Mr. Shandling had supported Mrs. Robinson. When. Mr Shandling died— Volks was his [[executor]]— he left Mrs. Robinson a small [[Will and testament|legacy]], but Mrs. Robinson [[lawsuit|sued]] additionally for [[alimony|maintenance]].

Robinson's claim was rejected because she did not fall within the definition of a “[[spouse]]” in the [http://www.justice.gov.za/legislation/acts/1990-027.pdf Maintenance of Surviving Spouses Act 27 of 1990]. On appeal to the [[High Court of South Africa|High Court]], the court held that the [[Act (law)|Act]] was unfairly [[discriminatory]] on the grounds of [[Social equality|equality]] and dignity.

On appeal to the [[Constitutional Court of South Africa|Constitutional Court]], the court held that the purpose of the Act was to provide for the maintenance of the surviving spouse, and that the ultimate aim was to extend an invariable consequence of marriage (i.e., support) beyond the death of either of the parties. The court further held that the Act was incapable of an interpretation including permanent life partners in the definition of a “spouse,” as [[marriage]] is an important [[social institution]], and the law is allowed to distinguish between married and [[Marital status|unmarried persons]] and accord benefits to the married.

The court held, accordingly, that there was a differentiation in the Act, but that it did not amount to an infringement of the right to equality. This decision was based on the fact that, during a marriage, the parties have a reciprocal duty of support, but there is no such duty accorded to the unmarried. The aim of the [[legislation]] was not to encompass the unmarried. Accordingly, the court could not require the imposition of an obligation on a deceased person's [[Estate (law)|estate]] where there is no such obligation on the deceased when he is alive.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2009">The '''Winchcombe Chronicle''' is a [[chronicle]] of the town of [[Winchcombe]] from about 1140-5.  

The original text was drafted in the 1140s and was then extended to 1181.&lt;ref&gt;Hayward, Paul Antony.,[https://josotl.indiana.edu/index.php/tmr/article/view/17473/23591   The Winchcombe and Coventry Chronicles: Hitherto Unnoticed Witnesses to the Work of John of Worcester],The ''Medieval Review'' 12.02.12. &lt;/ref&gt; The chronicle is also sometimes known as the ''Annals of Winchcombe'' though it differs from the earlier [[Winchcombe Annals]], produced by the [[Winchcombe Abbey|same Abbey]].

The [[Latin chronicle]] is [[Anonymous work|anonymous]] but was written in the [[Benedictine]], [[Winchcombe Abbey]] ([[Gloucestershire]]).

The [[manuscript]] is in two parts. The first, the work of a single [[scribe]], is a [[world history]] from creation to 1122 which takes much of its matterial from  [[John of Worcester]]'s ''Chronica chronicarum''. 

The [[addendum]] contained more recent material. The manuscript also has numerous [[Gloss (annotation)|margin notes]] of more recent event.&lt;ref&gt;Antonia Gransden, Legends, Tradition and History in Medieval England([[Bloomsbury Publishing]], 2010) [https://books.google.com.au/books?id=Lu7eBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA233&amp;lpg=PA233&amp;dq=Winchcombe+Chronicle&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=p1TDiliWFM&amp;sig=2MdzVQ-KYC5hIXKKvIdxPO4jLUw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi_98rJuLPZAhXEVbwKHdq9DGoQ6AEIVzAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=Winchcombe%20Chronicle&amp;f=false  p233].&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Zilch memo''' was an American government document sent by National Security Advisor [[Henry Kissinger]] to President [[Richard Nixon]] on January 3, 1972, about the military situation in [[Laos]] during the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nixonfoundation.org/artifact/zilch-memo/|title="Zilch" Memo|website=www.nixonfoundation.org|access-date=2017-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the memo, in his own handwriting, Nixon described the decade-long bombing campaign by the United States in Southeast Asia as a "failure," having achieved "zilch," despite public comments to the contrary.&lt;ref name=Hoffman&gt;{{cite news|last=Hoffman|first=David E.|title=Secret archive offers fresh insight into Nixon presidency|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/10/11/secret-archive-offers-fresh-insight-into-nixon-presidency/|access-date=2017-05-03|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=11 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just the day before, January 2, Nixon told [[CBS News]] reporter [[Dan Rather]] in an interview that the bombing was "very, very effective."&lt;ref name=Hoffman&gt;{{cite news|last=Hoffman|first=David E.|title=Secret archive offers fresh insight into Nixon presidency|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/10/11/secret-archive-offers-fresh-insight-into-nixon-presidency/|access-date=2017-05-03|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=11 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously missing from the [[Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum|Richard Nixon Library]],{{sfn|Woodward|2015|pages=112-113}} the memo was discovered in the possession of [[Alexander Butterfield]], who served as the [[Executive Office of the President#Organization|Deputy Assistant]] to President Nixon from 1969 to 1973, by ''[[Washington Post]]'' reporter [[Bob Woodward]], who subsequently published it in his 2015 book ''The Last of the President's Men''.{{sfn|Woodward|2015|page=116}}

Despite Nixon's private assessment that the bombing was a "failure," U.S. bombing in Southeast Asia increased in 1972.{{sfn|Woodward|2015|page=115}}

==The Memo==
On January 3, 1972, Kissinger sent a one-page classified memo to Nixon as a routine update on the Vietnam War. After receiving the memo, Nixon tilted it sideways and wrote in pen to Kissinger:{{sfn|Woodward|2015|page=114}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;K. We have had 10 years of ''total'' control of the air in Laos and V.Nam. The result = Zilch. There is something wrong with the strategy or the Air Force. I want a 'bark off' study—no snow job—on my desk in 2 weeks as to what the reason for the failure is. Otherwise continued air operations make no sense in Cambodia, Laos etc. after we complete withdrawal. Shake them up!!&lt;/blockquote&gt;
