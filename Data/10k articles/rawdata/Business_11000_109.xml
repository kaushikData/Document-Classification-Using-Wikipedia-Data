      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17818">'''Accounting networks and associations''' are [[professional services networks]] whose principal purpose is to provide members resources to assist the clients around the world and hence reduce the uncertainty by bringing together a greater number of resources to work on a problem. The networks and associations operate independently of the independent members. The largest accounting networks are known as the [[Big Four (audit firms)|Big Four]].
==The Big Four==
The '''Big Four''' are the four largest international [[professional services networks]], offering [[audit]], [[Assurance services|assurance]], [[tax]], consulting, advisory, actuarial, [[corporate finance]], and [[legal services]]. They handle the vast majority of [[Financial audit|audits]] for [[Public company|publicly traded companies]] as well as many [[Private company|private companies]], creating an [[oligopoly]] in auditing large companies. It is reported that the Big Four audit 99% of the companies in the [[FTSE 100 Index|FTSE 100]], and 96% of the companies in the [[FTSE 250 Index]], an [[Stock market index|index]] of the leading [[Market capitalization|mid-cap]] listing companies.&lt;ref name="FTSE"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703806304576232231353594682 |title=U.K. Auditors Criticized on Bank Crisis |date=2011-03-30 |author=Mario Christodoulou |publisher=Wall Street Journal }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Big Four firms are shown below, with their latest publicly available data. None of the Big Four firms is a single firm; rather, they are [[professional services networks]]. Each is a network of firms, owned and managed independently, which have entered into agreements with other member firms in the network to share a common name, [[brand]] and quality standards. Each network has established an entity to co-ordinate the activities of the network. In one case (KPMG), the co-ordinating entity is Swiss, and in three cases (Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, PricewaterhouseCoopers and Ernst &amp; Young) the co-ordinating entity is a [[United Kingdom|UK]] [[limited company]]. Those entities do not themselves perform external [[professional services]], and do not own or control the member firms. They are similar to [[law firm network]]s found in the [[legal profession]]. In many cases each member firm practises in a single country, and is structured to comply with the regulatory environment in that country. In 2007 KPMG announced a merger of four member firms (in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Germany]], [[Switzerland]] and [[Liechtenstein]]) to form a single firm. Ernst &amp; Young also includes separate legal entities which manage three of its four areas: Americas, EMEIA ([[Europe]], The [[Middle East]], [[India]] and [[Africa]]), and [[Asia-Pacific]]. (Note: the [[Japan]] area does not have a separate area management entity).  These firms coordinate services performed by local firms within their respective areas but do not perform services or hold ownership in the local entities.&lt;ref name=E&amp;Y&gt;{{cite web|work=Ernst &amp; Young|title=Legal statement|url=http://www.ey.com/GL/EN/home/legal}}&lt;/ref&gt; This group was once known as the "Big Eight", and was reduced to the "Big Six" and then "Big Five" by a series of [[merger]]s. The Big Five became the Big Four after the demise of [[Arthur Andersen]] in 2002, following its involvement in the [[Enron scandal]].

== History of accounting networks and associations ==

=== Foundations ===
Accounting networks were created to meet a specific need. “The accounting profession in the U.S. was built upon a state-established monopoly for audits of financial statements.”&lt;ref&gt;Olson, W. E., [http://www.nysscpa.org/cpajournal/1999/0799/features/F28799.HTM “The Accounting Profession in the 20th Century”], The CPA Journal, (July 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; Accounting networks arose out of the necessity for public American companies to have audited [[financial statements]] for the [[Securities Exchange Commission]] (SEC).&lt;ref&gt;For the history of accounting networks see: Stevens, The Big Six (1991); Zeff, S. A, [http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~sazeff/PDF/Horizons,%20Part%20I%20(print).pdf “How the U.S. Accounting Profession Got Where  jkui iujiui nit is today: Part 1”] Accounting Horizons Volume 17, 189–205 (September 2003). Zeff, S. A, [http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~sazeff/PDF/Horizons,%20Part%20II%20(print).pdf “How the U.S. Accounting Profession Got Where it is today: Part II”]  Accounting Horizons (September 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;  For over 70 years, the SEC has continually sought for greater coordination and consistent quality in audits everywhere in the world. Networks were the logical model to address these requirements.  They expanded outside of the United States since financial results had to be audited wherever a company conducted business. In the US, the [[Public Company Accounting Oversight Board]]'s (PCAOB) regulations provide for inspection of non-United States firms. Without a network with [[common standards]] and internal means of communications, conducting the required audits would not be possible.

There were other profession-based factors which favored the growth of accounting networks. As a result of competition for the audit work, consolidation was inevitable. These include the fact that a network can establish a [[brand]]. A brand establishes the credibility of the network and allows the individual members to charge more. Creating a brand is very difficult when all of the members of a network are providing essentially the same services.

Being a network member establishes that the firm is part of a large group. Additionally, the larger the firm, the more likely it will be invited to render auditing engagements.  A large organized network allows for spreading the costs to price competitively. Ultimately, size is the only real means of differentiation that is readily available on accounting firms to assure clients that they can do international work.&lt;ref&gt;Baskerville, Hat, [http://hdl.handle.net/10036/29637/ Globalization of professional accounting: The Big 8 entering New Zealand] (June 2007) citing Greenwood, Cooper, Hinings, and Brown, “Biggest is best? Strategic assumptions and actions in the Canadian audit industry” Revue Canadienne des Sciences de l’Administration 10(4) 308–322 (1993)&lt;/ref&gt;

Networks also reflect the clients’ needs for seamless worldwide services because they are more efficient and cost-effective.,&lt;ref&gt;Freidheim, Cyrus, The Trillion Dollar Corporation (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; From the perspective of the accounting firm, a global regulated organization with consistently applied standards significantly reduced the risk. However, increasing the size of the networks can enhance [[legal liability]] risks and [[quality control]] issues that have not been resolved.

With these factors in play, some networks continued to grow; others remained in a stasis position. Individual members of networks began to offer other services related to accounting. These services included [[forensic accounting]], business appraisals, [[employee benefits]] planning, [[strategic planning]], and almost anything associated with financial parts of the client’s business. The network’s structure easily accommodated these services and their geographical expansion.&lt;ref&gt;Aharoni “Internationalization of Professional Services: Implications for the Accounting Profession” in Brock, Powell and Hindings, Restructuring the Professional Organization (1999).&lt;/ref&gt;

As the [[Big Four (audit firms)|Big 8 consolidated to become Big 6, the Big 5 and then the Big 4]], new networks naturally developed to emulate them. [[BDO International|BDO]] and [[Grant Thornton]] were the earliest followers. Networks were then developed to serve mid-market companies and private businesses. New networks also sprang up as an extension of a single accounting firm in the same way the Big 8 were formed. New structures were created to further extend the networks.

The largest accounting networks adopted trade names that each member used. The names of the original firms that became part of the networks were lost and replaced with trade names. For example, PriceWaterhouseCoopers became [[PWC]].  The perception was created that these networks were more than networks, but single entities rather than completely independent firms. This was never the case.  The result was that the Big 8 concept was established which separated the eight firms from all other accounting firms.

Another factor in the development of networks in accounting was the [[American Institute of Certified Public Accountants| American Institute of Certified Public Accountants(AICPA)]]’s prohibition of advertising. While the largest firms indirectly advertised their services, the small firms complied with the rules and believed advertising to be unprofessional. Additionally, midsize firms were de facto restricted from advertising simply because of limited budgets. They could not create a brand that was able to compete with the one established by the Big 8. The advertising restriction was lifted in the 1970s by the [[Federal Trade Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;American Inst. of [[Certified Public Accountant]]s, 113 F.T.C. 698 (1990)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Multidisciplinary expansion ===

In the 1990s, the large accounting firms reached another ceiling in the services they made available to their clients. Having reached their natural limit on growth with more than 90% of auditing for public companies, the Big 6 branched out to become [[multidisciplinary]] in [[legal]], [[technology]], and [[employment]] services. Since the essential infrastructure was in place, it was thought to be relatively simple to incorporate other services into the existing network. As a network, it was natural to create independent entities in these other [[professions]] which themselves could be part of the network. The method and structures varied from firm to firm.

When the Big 6 began its expansion to the legal profession, it was met with fierce opposition from [[Law firm|law firms]] and bar associations. Commissions, panels and committees were established by legal and accounting firms to argue their positions. [[Government agency|Government agencies]] were enlisted. For more than five years the debate escalated.  This movement ended abruptly with the fall of [[Arthur Andersen]] as a result of its association with [[Enron]]. [[Sarbanes Oxley]] followed, which effectively ended this trend.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} Some international associations of independent firms, such as [[Alliott Group]], now include law firms within the membership.

== Vicarious liability ==

Accounting networks are now facing a new challenge that go to the heart of the image that the firms wish to project to clients. The perception has been that the Big 4, Grant Thornton and BDO are single entities that perform services around the world for clients of this single entity. As a result of court cases this has introduced significant [[vicarious liability]] issues requiring the networks to distance themselves from the perception of being a single entity. The [[Parmalat]] case is the best illustration of the issues.

While the firms have lost a number of cases, the facts and circumstance, or procedural elements have reduced their actual liability.

== Networks versus associations ==

The [[vicarious liability]] issues carry over into operations. Regulations in the EU have been imposed that require the “networks” to define whether they are "associations" of independent firm or are more integrated networks operationally and financially.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accountancyage.com/print_artice/aa/feature/1748284/networks-survey-global-risk/   Networks Survey: global risk, Accountancy Age] Smith, Phil November, 2008 Code of Ethics 290 revised the determination. It should be “made in light of whether a reasonable and informed third party would be likely to conclude that a network exists. A referral network is not a network by this definition. The shared costs must be significant. Common quality system and [[Strategic management|business strategies]] are important considerations.”&lt;/ref&gt; Additional standards have been passed by IFAC, an independent associations of accountants, on distinguishing networks from associations.  The objectives of each are to provide the clients a level of understanding about the degree of integration with each other.  Examples of [[international]] associations of accounting firms include Alliott Group, Geneva Group International and Leading Edge Alliance.

== Conflicts of interest ==

Self-definition as a network or associations may determine if there is a  [[conflict of interest]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/26/9/2495220.pdf OECD Report: [[Conflict of interest|Conflicts of Interest]] in Accounting and Auditing]&lt;/ref&gt;  If the group is perceived as a network, it may be foreclosed from representation of clients because they cannot represent a competitor. Association members would not be foreclosed from representation because the firms are perceived as independent by clients.

== Big 4 dominance of public company audits ==

Accounting scandals have again focused on the fact that the Big 4 has a near [[monopoly]] on audits of public companies.&lt;ref&gt;Karen Kroll, [http://www.cfoworld.com/accounting/2490/get-accounting-firms-are-backing-more-regulation Get This: Accounting Firms are backing more regulation], CFO World Newsletter February 15, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  Networks are demanding regulations on auditing to require that auditors rotate and include the smaller networks in this rotation.&lt;ref&gt;Plans Grow for European Audit Cop, Wall Street Journal October 12, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The demands also request that mid-market firms be able to participate to break up the [[monopoly]] of the Big 4.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31455">This article is about the international '''Aerospace Journalist of the Year Awards''' (abbreviated "AJOYA"), issued from 1996 to 2009-2010 by the '''[[World Leadership Forum]], Ltd''', of London, England, U.K., in conjunction with the [[Farnborough Air Show]] (England) and the [[Paris Air Show]] (France).

AJOYA should not be confused with the Australia's "'''Aviation Journalist of the Year" Awards''', issued by that country's '''National Aviation Press Club''' (at least during 2010, in Sydney, Australia).  Those awards were restricted to writers from Australia and New Zealand. For more on those awards in 2010, see:  [http://australianaviation.com.au/2010/12/australian-aviations-mclaughlin-aviation-journalist-of-the-year/ "Australian Aviation’s McLaughlin ‘Aviation Journalist of the Year’"], on australianaviation.com.au December 6, 2010.

==Overview==
The international '''Aerospace Journalist of the Year Awards''' (abbreviated "AJOYA") were awards for writers and broadcasters working in the aerospace and aviation field, including specialists and those working for non-specialist titles. The awards dinner took place in mid-July (timed to coincide with the [[Farnborough Air Show]] and the [[Paris Air Show]]), and brought together aviation media and industry representatives.

The awards were organised between 1996&lt;ref name="swissair111_2004-07-22"&gt;[http://forums.swissair111.org/eve/forums/a/tpc/f/322103945/m/6971074601 "Air Safety Week's David Evans Wins International Aerospace Journalist of the Year Award"] (POTOMAC, MD, July 22, 2004), posted July 23 2004 on swissair111.org&lt;/ref&gt; and 2010 by Malcolm Turner and his company (the "'''[[World Leadership Forum]], Ltd'''," of the UK) under the auspices of the [[Royal Aeronautical Society]] of the U.K. and the [[Aero Club of France]] ([[Aéro-Club de France]]).&lt;ref name="duedil_WLF"&gt;[https://www.duedil.com/company/04085053/the-world-leadership-forum-limited "The World Leadership Forum Limited" page], in the business-information database-website Duedil.com&lt;/ref&gt;

The Awards, given annually, were typically organized in a hierarchy:
* 1.)  '''All entries''' in each category of each award (typically varying from seven to dozens of contestants, depending on the volume of entries—commonly in the hundreds&lt;ref name="swissair111_2004-07-22" /&gt;).
&lt;br /&gt;...which judges narrowed down to...
* 2.)  '''"Shortlist" finalists''' in each category (usually about the top 5 candidates) (Shortlists were published on the respective Awards program websites for the few months leading up to the Awards Banquet/Ceremony.)
&lt;br /&gt;...from which, based on judges' scores, were selected...
* 3.)  "'''"Best in Category" winners'''" in each topical category, announced at the Awards Banquet/Ceremony
&lt;br /&gt;...from which were selected, based on judges' scores...
* 4.)  The OVERALL '''"Aerospace Journalist of the Year,"''' also announced at the Awards Banquet/Ceremony
&lt;br /&gt;...and an additional award...
* 5.)  The '''"DECADE OF EXCELLENCE" Award''' was also awarded each year (based on judges' scores), for the most outstanding aerospace journalist of the previous ten years.

==Trophies==

The AJOYA awards were originally trophies in the form of a bronze eagle - leading the awards to become known colloquially as 'budgies', and for the competition to become known as the 'Budgie Awards'. The design of the Trophy changed several times, becoming a representation of the Aerospace Journalist of the Year logo, and then a simple engraved glass 'spike'.

==History==
The aerospace industry's writing awards, previously for many years (1960s to mid/late-1990s), had been awarded annually by the U.S.-based [[Aviation &amp; Space Writers' Association]], at a grand banquet gathering aviation industry leaders and luminaries.  That organization and its awards program dissolved, leaving a vacuum in the aviation media world.

Starting in the late 1990s, until 2009-2010, that void was filled by a British enterprise—the [[World Leadership Forum]], Ltd. -- in collaboration with the world's two oldest aviation organizations: the [[Aero Club of France]] ([[Aéro-Club de France]]), and the [[Royal Aeronautical Society]] (of the United Kingdom).&lt;ref name="defensemedia_2009-07-16"&gt;[http://www.defensemedianetwork.com/stories/craig-covault-wins-2009-aerospace-journalist-of-the-year-award/ "Craig Covault Wins 2009 Aerospace Journalist of the Year Award"], Chuck Oldham (Editor) on July 16, 2009, DefenseMediaNetwork.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Awards were issued in several "Category" topic areas (see lists below).

Contest entries (copies of published articles or broadcasts) were received from publications and authors, then copied and redistributed to judges in each category, who then narrowed the submissions down to a few finalists (the prestigious "Shortlist") in each category, which was then published on the organization website during the months leading up to the Banquet.

The "Shortlist" candidates were invited to the Awards Banquet, where they would then discover who, among them, would be awarded the "Aerospace Journalist of the Year Award" in that respective category. Then from the category winners, a tally of judges' scores determined the one overall "Aerospace Journalist of the Year,"  and one Honoree for a "Decade of Excellence" Award.

The awards were first presented in London in 1996, and throughout the years, the presentation ceremonies have alternated between [[Paris]] and [[London]]—roughly coinciding with the world's two main airshows: the Paris Air Show and Farnborough Air Show (England), held on alternate years.

In London, the AJOYA ceremonies have taken place at the Ballroom of the [[Park Lane Hotel]], [[Piccadilly]],&lt;ref name="vayu_2010"&gt;[http://www.vayuaerospace.in/vayu.htm "Vayu nominated again for The 2010 Aerospace Journalist of the Year Awards"], ''Vayu Aerospace and Defence Review'', posted in 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  and at the Royal Courts of Justice and they directly preceded the biennial [[Farnborough Airshow]].

The organization depended upon aerospace industry companies to sponsor the awards, and reciprocated their generosity by offering them seating with the AJOYA finalists at the awards banquet—a public-relations opportunity for aerospace industry leaders and P.R. execs to charm their industry's leading writers and opinion-shapers.

However, remotely located from most of the world's aviation media (in London or Paris, far removed from the Americas, Africa and Asia), many aerospace writers who made the awards-finalist "Shortlists" (and were thus invited to the banquet), were unable to attend—undermining the value of the banquet, and sponsorships, to AJOYA's commercial sponsors.

The awards then began to be limited to only those writers who would make the trip to the banquet, sharply reducing eligibility for the awards.

Initially, relatively few of the world's aerospace journalists competed, and the awards were almost exclusively from the U.S. and Britain, with a few contestants from Western Europe and British Commonwealth nations.

But as the years went by, many more entered the contests, and additional categories of judging were added, and non-English entries were admitted (and translated into English for the judges), drawing contest entries from throughout the world—Russia and Eastern Europe, China and East Asia, South Asia, Latin America and Africa.

The volume of entries began to overwhelm the limited number of AJOYA judges, creating difficuties.

The global economic "Great Recession" that started in 2007 soon collapsed the aerospace industry, and forced drastic budget-tightening on nearly all aerospace companies.  "Extras"—such as support of aviation organizations and programs—were cut out of many companies' budgets.

The awards ended amid rumours that they folded due to a lack of sponsorship.

The World Leadership Forum, Ltd. organization dissolved in 2009, according to the business-info website Duedil.com.&lt;ref name="duedil_WLF" /&gt;

The AJOYA.com website is now off-line and the domain name is for sale.

There were no awards in 2011, and in 2012 a different organiser held a new Aerospace Media Awards dinner at the Royal Aeronautical Society in London.

==Judges==
Judges were chiefly leading aerospace industry editors &amp; writers, and business/technical leaders &amp; experts—largely chosen from the ranks of former AJOYA Winners or "Shortlist" finalists—from around the world.

The judges came from aerospace industry publications such as:
* [[Aero Revue]]
* [[Aviation International News]]
* [[Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology]]
* [[Business &amp; Commercial Aviation]]
* [[Flight International]]
* [[Jane's Defence Weekly]]

To ensure fair judging, judges were recused from voting on their own submissions, and from voting on any other submissions from any publication for whom they wrote, or any "sister" publication (owned by the same, or a related, company).

The final list of AJOYA judges (see below) finished with the note:
"The judges have not marked any entry from their own publication/company, or any sister publication/company"

This is the last list of Judges, which remained on the AJOYA.COM website until 2010:

'''Aleksandr Bokovikov''' (September 7, 1956, [[Katangsky District|Ayan]] – August 8, 2010) was a [[Russia]]n politician and businessman who served as the Governor of the now defunct [[Evenk Autonomous Okrug]] from 1997 until 2001.&lt;ref name=rulers&gt;{{cite news |title=August 2010 timeline |url=http://rulers.org/2010-08.html|work=Rulers.org |accessdate=2010-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=itartass&gt;{{cite news |title=The first governor of the Evenki Autonomous Areadies dies |url=http://www.itar-tass.com/eng/level2.html?NewsID=15388300 |work=[[Information Telegraph Agency of Russia]] |date=2010-08-09 |accessdate=2010-08-12 }}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Evenk Autonomous Okrug was later merged into the Krasnoyarsk Krai on January 1, 2007, and incorporated into the [[Krasnoyarsk Krai]] as the [[Evenkiysky District]].

==Biography==

===Political career===
Bokovikov was elected as the first chairman of the Evenk Autonomous Okrug legislature, known as the Sulgan, in 1994.&lt;ref name=itartass/&gt;&lt;ref name=ewi&gt;{{cite news |first=Robert W.|last=Orttung|title=The Republics and Regions of the Russian Federation: A Guide to Politics, Policies and Leaders  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VroABgoe4-EC&amp;pg=PA120&amp;lpg=PA120&amp;dq=Aleksandr+Bokovikov+evenk&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6r5X-nWxHy&amp;sig=7vgAV2H7pCQ3j_XF9g_tWNZG6Jk&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Ft1jTIzOCIGB8gbe1bCuDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CBoQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Aleksandr%20Bokovikov%20evenk&amp;f=false |work=[[EastWest Institute]] |publisher=[[Google Books]] |date=2000 |accessdate=2010-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Governor of Evenk Autonomous Okrug===
Bokovikov announced his candidacy for Governor of Evenk Autonomous Okrug in the 1996 gubernatorial election. He ran with the backing of both the National Patriotic Union of Russia and the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation]].&lt;ref name=ewi/&gt; Bokovikov's main opponent was the incumbent head of the Evenk Autonomous Okrug, [[Anatolii Yakimov]], who was supported by the All Russia Coordinating Council.&lt;ref name=ewi/&gt;

The gubernatorial election was held on December 22, 1996,&lt;ref name=ewi/&gt; but it would be March 1997 before a victor was announced due to irregularities in the election results.&lt;ref name=ewi/&gt; The initial election results showed Bokovikov defeating Yakimov by less than 100 votes.&lt;ref name=ewi/&gt; However, the final vote tally had Yakimov being re-elected by 550 votes over Bokovikov.&lt;ref name=ewi/&gt; Bokovikov filed a lawsuit against the Evenk Autonomous Okrug's [[Election management body|election commission]], with the goal of having the 1996 election results overturned.&lt;ref name=ewi/&gt; The results were not overturned, but a new gubernatorial election was held in March 1997 instead.&lt;ref name=ewi/&gt;

Aleksandr Bokovikov was elected Governor of Evenk Autonomous Okrug on March 16, 1997, nearly four months after the disputed December election.&lt;ref name=ewi/&gt;

Much of his focus as Governor pertained to [[economic development]] in the [[okrug]] and raising the [[standard of living]].&lt;ref name=itartass/&gt;  He also opposed the sale of public land.&lt;ref name=ewi/&gt;

Bokovikov actively supported the Evenk Autonomous Okrug remaining a constituent part of the [[Krasnoyarsk Krai]].&lt;ref name=ewi/&gt; Bokovikov signed a June 1997 treaty with then Krasnoyarsk Krai Governor [[Valerii Zubov]] which explicitly stated that Evenk Autonomous Okrug was part of Krasnoyarsk Krai.&lt;ref name=ewi/&gt; The agreement also allowed residents of Evenk Autonomous Okrug to vote in Krasnoyarsk Krai's gubernatorial and legislative elections.&lt;ref name=ewi/&gt;

Bokovikov remained Governor of Evenk Autonomous Okrug until 2001. He was succeeded by [[Boris Zolotaryov]], the last Governor of Evenk Autonomous Okrug before the okrug was abolished and incorporated into Krasnoyarsk Krai on January 1, 2010.

===Later life===
Bokovikov became the director of the Evenkiyanefteprodukt company after leaving office. He was elected to the Council of deputies in [[Tura, Krasnoyarsk Krai|Tura]], [[Evenkiysky District]].&lt;ref name=itartass/&gt;

Aleksandr Bokovikov died on August 8, 2010, at the age of 53.&lt;ref name=rulers/&gt;&lt;ref name=itartass/&gt;

{{further|Anti-siphoning law}}

'''Anti-siphoning laws''' in [[Australia]] regulate the media companies' access to significant sporting events. In 1992, when the country experienced growth in paid-subscription media, the [[Parliament of Australia]] enacted the [[Broadcasting Services Act 1992]] that gave free-to-air broadcasters essentially first refusal to certain sporting event broadcasting rights. The '''anti-siphoning list''' is a list of events, the televising of which should, in the opinion of the relevant Minister, be available free to the general public.&lt;ref&gt;Section 115 of the ''Broadcasting Services Act 1992''.&lt;/ref&gt; To effect this 'freedom', the ''Broadcasting Services Act 1992'' includes a licence condition on pay TV providers that prohibits them from acquiring anti-siphoning  events unless a national broadcaster or a network of commercial television broadcasters have the right to televise the events.&lt;ref&gt;Paragraph 10(1)(e) of Schedule 2 to the ''Broadcasting Services Act 1992''&lt;/ref&gt; This prohibition drops away a certain period before the event starts. The current anti-siphoning rules also prohibit national television broadcasters and commercial television  broadcasters from premiering listed events on digital multi-channels. Listed events may be shown on digital multi-channels if they have already been broadcast, or are simultaneously broadcast on the broadcaster's main channel.

{{update section|date=March 2011}}
The anti-siphoning list came into effect in 2006. The relevant Minister has the power to add, amend or remove events from the list.&lt;ref&gt;These decisions must be notified in the Gazette and laid before each House of Parliament. The decision will come into effect if no motion of disallowance has been moved within 15 sitting days in either House.&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, only sporting events are listed, even though the ''Broadcasting Services Act 1992'' does not limit the types of events that can be listed. There are currently ten sport types (e.g. tennis, soccer, rugby league) on the anti-siphoning list plus the Olympic and Commonwealth Games. Events on the anti-siphoning list are delisted 12 weeks before they start to ensure pay TV broadcasters have reasonable access to listed events, if free-to-air broadcasters decide not to purchase the broadcast rights for a particular event. Any rights to listed sporting events that are not acquired by free-to-air broadcasters are available to pay TV. Before the end of 2009, the Federal Government conducted a review of the anti-siphoning scheme, with the Minister proposing changes to the scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minister.dbcde.gov.au/media/media_releases/2010/103|title=Reforms to the Anti-siphoning Scheme Announced|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514170355/http://www.minister.dbcde.gov.au/media/media_releases/2010/103|archivedate=14 May 2013|df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These changes can not come into effect until amending legislation is passed through the Australian Parliament.
After the broadcasting deals were announced with [[Cricket Australia]], [[Seven Network]] and [[Fox Cricket]], Men’s ODIs and T20s will be live and exclusively broadcast on [[Foxtel]].

==Listed events==

'''Benjamin Franklin Washington''' (April 7, 1820 &amp;ndash; January 22, 1872) was a relative of [[George Washington]]. He was involved in a [[duel]] with [[Charles Ames Washburn|C. A. Washburn]] over articles printed in the ''[[San Francisco Herald]]''.

He was coeditor of the ''Sacramento Democratic State Journal'', along with Vincent Geiger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archiver.rootsweb.com/th/read/NORCAL/2002-10/1036028508|title=Biographical Sketches Part 4|accessdate=2006-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 7, 1863, the ''Democratic Press'' was established in [[San Francisco]], and by June 12, 1865, it became the ''Evening Examiner'', with William S. Moss as publisher and B. F. Washington as editor. For several years William S. Moss, Phil Roach and George Pen Johnston were its owners. Until it was bought by Senator Hearst in the 1880s, the paper had been a "highly chaste and non-sensation journal".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usgennet.org/usa/ca/state1/newca/newca10.html|title=A History of the New California, ch. 10, "GROWTH OF NEWSPAPERS"|author=Leigh H.

B.F. Washington died January 22, 1872 in [[San Francisco]], [[California]].

==The duel==
Washington, who at the time worked for the Times and Transcript, took offense at articles written in the ''San Francisco Herald''. As a result, he challenged C. A. Washburn, then the editor of the ''San Francisco Herald'', to a duel. Though Washington aimed to kill, his second shot went through the rim of Washburn's hat, and his third bullet struck Washburn in the shoulder. The duel then ended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usgennet.org/usa/ca/state1/tinkhamch14.html|title=California Men and Events, ch. 14, "PULPIT, PRESS AND PUBLIC SCHOOL"|author=George H.

The '''Bingham Company Warehouse''' is a historic [[warehouse]] located in [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], in the United States. It was designed by the noted local firm of [[Walker and Weeks]] for the [[W. Bingham Company]], and is one of the architectural firm's few utilitarian commercial buildings. For many years, W. Bingham Co. was the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest's]] largest hardware manufacturer and wholesaler. The W. Bingham Co. went out of business in 1961, and the warehouse was sold to a succession of owners of the years. The warehouse was sold to private investors in 2001, who converted it into apartments, known today as '''The Bingham'''.

==About the building==
===Construction===
Cleveland entrepreneurs William Bingham and Henry C. Blossom purchased the Clark &amp; Murfey [[hardware store]] in 1841, and incorporated it as the W. Bingham Co. in 1888.&lt;ref name=binghamco&gt;{{cite web|title=W. Bingham Co.|website=The Encyclopedia of Cleveland History|date=2017|accessdate=May 11, 2017|url=https://case.edu/ech/articles/w/w-bingham-co/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1913, the W. Bingham Co. announced it would construct a new building in the city's [[Warehouse District, Cleveland|Warehouse District]] as its new headquarters.&lt;ref name=biggest&gt;{{cite news|title=Wholesale Building Will Be Biggest Here|work=The Plain Dealer|date=April 22, 1913|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intended to be the largest warehouse in Cleveland, 
&lt;ref name=biggest /&gt;&lt;ref name=newbingham /&gt; the cost of the building and land were estimated at $1 million (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1000000|1913|r=-5}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars).&lt;ref name=newbingham&gt;{{cite news|title=The New Bingham Building Will Cost $1,000,000|work=Doorways|date=May 1913|page=7|accessdate=May 11, 2017|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dRxbAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=%22W.%20Bingham%20Company%22%20Warehouse&amp;pg=PA30-IA25#v=onepage&amp;q=%22W.%20Bingham%20Company%22%20Warehouse&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the announcement, the company had already completed the purchase of the land&lt;ref name=biggest /&gt; at a cost of about $400,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|400000|1913|r=-5}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars), and its architect, the noted Cleveland firm of Walker &amp; Weeks,&lt;ref name=longlease&gt;{{cite news|title=Takes Long Lease On Euclid-Av Land|work=The Plain Dealer|date=March 16, 1915|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|''The Engineering Record''|1915|page=357}}{{sfn|Buettell|1915|page=123}}{{sfn|Avery|1918|page=242}} had finished preliminary designs for the building. The architects drew heavily on Knox &amp; Elliott's 1905 [[Rockefeller Building (Cleveland)|Rockefeller Building]]{{sfn|''Ohio Historic Places Dictionary''|2008|page=192}} as well as their own 1912 Renkert Building for inspiration,{{sfn|Johannesen|1998|pages=48, 50}} The warehouse, which was anticipated to be of steel and concrete construction, was designed to have a spur from the [[Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railway]] (the "Big Four") run into its basement. The architects hoped to have as many as 17 truck [[loading dock]]s on the building's northwest side, with a truck parking garage in one of the three basements.  Another basement would be used for the storage of the heaviest goods. Elevators were intended to be located in the center of the building, so they could be reached quickly and efficiently by all points on each floor.&lt;ref name=biggest /&gt; At some point in 1913 or 1914, Christian, Schwarzenberg &amp; Gaede, a local [[structural engineering]] firm, was hired to assist with the plans.&lt;ref name=lightmanu&gt;{{cite news|title=Warehouse, Light Manufacturing|work=Steel and Iron|date=September 28, 1914|page=1197|accessdate=May 12, 2017|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=76dAAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22W.%20Bingham%20Company%22%20manufacturing&amp;pg=PA1197#v=onepage&amp;q=%22W.%20Bingham%20Company%22%20manufacturing&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|''The Engineering Record''|1915|page=357}}{{sfn|Buettell|1915|page=123}}

By June 1914, work on the architectural plans had advanced to the point where W. Bingham Co. was ready to place an order for up to {{convert|2500|ST|MT}} of [[structural steel]] and [[rebar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cleveland|work=The Iron Age|date=June 4, 1914|page=1425|accessdate=May 12, 2017|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sdYcAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22Bingham%20Company%20Warehouse%22&amp;pg=PA1425#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Bingham%20Company%20Warehouse%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  But city officials had extensive concerns about the architectural design, and extensive (if unreported) changes to the plans were under way in July 1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=June Contracts Dropped|work=Iron Trade Review|date=July 16, 1914|page=107|accessdate=May 12, 2017|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n21AAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Bingham%20warehouse%20cleveland&amp;pg=PA107#v=onepage&amp;q=Bingham&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of July, W.

The city issued a building permit in late February or early March 1915.&lt;ref name=longlease /&gt; Work on the basement floors and walls proceeded very slowly. Enormous coal and ash bins and long steel rails for the moving of heavy items were designed to hang from ceiling beams in these areas. This required the use of shaped steel pieces which had to be perfectly joined, and the pouring of concrete around them.  Once the basements were complete, the rest of the building rose very swiftly.

==About the building==
The W. Bingham Co. warehouse building cost $600,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|600000|1915|r=-5}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars).&lt;ref name=longlease /&gt; It is largely constructed of brick, concrete, and steel.&lt;ref name=naversen&gt;{{cite news|last=Naversen|first=Andrea|title=7 Cleveland Landmarks Designated As Historic Places|work=-The Plain Dealer|date=November 15, 1973|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; The slightly L-shaped{{sfn|Johannesen|1998|page=48}} building was {{convert|99|ft|m}} wide on W. 9th Street and {{convert|198.5|ft|m}} wide on W. 10th Street and had a total length of {{convert|435|ft|m}}&lt;ref name=thebingham /&gt; ({{convert|455|ft|m}} between the basement walls).{{sfn|''The Engineering Record''|1915|page=356}} On W. 9th Street, eight floors were visible&lt;ref name=thebingham /&gt; and the building height was {{convert|101|ft|m}}.{{sfn|''The Engineering Record''|1915|page=356}} On W. 10th Street, 11 floors were visible&lt;ref name=thebingham /&gt; and the building height was {{convert|148|ft|m}}.{{sfn|''The Engineering Record''|1915|page=356}} Each floor had {{convert|57000|sqft|m2}} of space, for a total building interior space of {{convert|683892|sqft|m2}}.{{sfn|''The Engineering Record''|1915|page=356}}

As viewed from W. 9th Street, the building had three basements. The rear (or southwest) wall of the third basement was actually a heavily reinforced slab and pier retaining wall {{convert|28|ft|m}} high, giving the third basement a ceiling {{convert|25|ft|m}} high.{{sfn|''The Engineering Record''|1915|page=356}} The third basement extended about {{convert|50|ft|m}} under W. 9th Street, while the second and first basements only extended about {{convert|20|ft|m}} under the street.{{sfn|''The Engineering Record''|1915|page=356}} There were originally only two large shipping doors, each roughly {{convert|37|ft|m}} wide and {{convert|21|ft|m}} high, in the rear wall of the third basement. To accommodate the doors, two exterior columns had to be omitted. In their place are two massive girders,{{sfn|Buettell|1915|page=119}} each {{convert|41|ft|m}} long and resting on a single massive pier between the doors.{{sfn|''The Engineering Record''|1915|page=357}} A railroad spur ran under the building's ell (along the line of the old Mandrake Avenue), and there were 24 truck loading docks on the structure's northwest side.&lt;ref name=attention&gt;{{cite news|title=Attention All Building Loft Tenants|work=-The Plain Dealer|date=October 8, 1971|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The superstructure of the building featured unusually heavy columns and floor slabs designed to permit {{convert|500|psf}} on the floors of the first and second basement and the first and second floor, and {{convert|300|psf}} on floors three and higher. In order to accommodate the weight of the boiler, coal bin, ash bin, and associated equipment at the rear of the second basement, a portion of this floor was designed to withstand {{convert|700|psf}}.{{sfn|Buettell|1915|page=119}} The octagonal, steel core-and-concrete columns in this area were {{convert|59|ft|m}} tall, extending from the foundation up to the second floor.{{sfn|''The Engineering Record''|1915|page=356}} Four of the exterior wall columns as well as all interior columns in the three basements and first floor were also steel core-and-concrete, to support the stresses on the structure below-ground.{{sfn|''The Engineering Record''|1915|page=356}}{{Efn|The cores of these columns consisted of {{convert|14|in|cm}}, {{convert|148|lb|kg|adj=on}} Bethlehem Steel H-girders.

Instead, {{convert|7|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} [[cantilever]]s supported the exterior walls above the third floor.{{sfn|Buettell|1915|page=117}}{{Efn|The exterior walls here were {{convert|13|in|cm}} thick to help make up for the fewer columns.{{sfn|Buettell|1915|page=117}}}}

The floors of the basements and upper floors were poured in {{convert|20.5|sqft|m2}} slabs. These slabs were {{convert|11|in|cm}} thick in the basements and on the first floor, and {{convert|9.5|in|cm}} thick on all other floors.{{sfn|''The Engineering Record''|1915|page=357}} The roof was a {{convert|7.5|in|cm|adj=mid|-thick}} slab.{{sfn|Buettell|1915|page=117}} [[Spandrel|Spandrel beams]] were not used in the flooring system.  The exception was on the fourth floor: With offices to be located on the third floor, the architects wanted to do away with column caps in order to provide space for lighting fixtures and to avoid light-scattering. Spandrels in the fourth floor were needed to compensate for the weaker support.{{sfn|Buettell|1915|page=117}} Flooring throughout the structure was Kreolite, a [[creosote]]-impregnated wood block.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A Factory Floor That Stands Up Under Hard, Heavy Service|work=Factory, the Magazine of Management|date=July 1916|page=85|accessdate=May 12, 2017|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q-U7AQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Bingham%20warehouse%20cleveland&amp;pg=PA85#v=onepage&amp;q=Bingham%20warehouse%20cleveland&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exterior of the building was clad in [[Block paving|paving brick]] rejects.{{sfn|''The Engineering Record''|1915|page=357}} Walker &amp; Weeks had used uniformly-colored paving brick on the Renkert Building, which it had designed shortly before beginning work on the W. Bingham Co. warehouse. Architect Harry Weeks recommended paving brick for the Bingham building because it was strong, long-wearing, and inexpensive.{{sfn|Weeks|1916|page=5}} "Seconds" (bricks which were not uniform in color due to chemical differences, miscasting, or after spending too much time [[Curing (chemistry)|curing]] in the [[kiln]]) were recommended by Weeks because they created an aesthetically pleasing "tapestry effect which might be assumed to have resulted from careful artistic design, rather than accident and economy."{{sfn|Weeks|1916|pages=5-6}} Windows in the building all had steel [[Sash window|sashes]] and [[Safety glass#Wire mesh glass|wire mesh glass]].{{sfn|''The Engineering Record''|1915|page=357}} The roofline was a simple concave [[cavetto]] [[cornice]].{{sfn|Johannesen|1998|page=50}}

The interior of the building, as befit a warehouse, was relatively spartan. Five&lt;ref name=attention /&gt; elevators were grouped in the center of the structure,&lt;ref name=biggest /&gt; and a [[pneumatic tube]] network installed in the shafts as a space-saving measure. The building also featured several spiral package chutes,{{sfn|''The Engineering Record''|1915|page=357}} and an exterior surface parking lot.&lt;ref name=attention /&gt;

The cost of the land and completed building was $1 million (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1000000|1915|r=-5}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars).{{sfn|Buettell|1915|page=119}} All told, {{convert|300|ST|MT}} of cast iron, {{convert|1200|ST|MT}} of structural steel, {{convert|2300|ST|MT}} of rebar, and {{convert|38000|cuyd|m3}} of concrete were used in its construction.{{sfn|''The Engineering Record''|1915|page=357}}{{sfn|Buettell|1915|page=123}} When completed, it was reportedly the largest single-unit warehouse in the world.{{sfn|Avery|1918|page=242}}{{sfn|Historic Warehouse District Development Corporation|2002|page=25}}

===Architectural assessment===
The W. Bingham Co. warehouse building is widely considered one of the finest Commercial style buildings in Cleveland.&lt;ref name=naversen /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kosher|first=John Leo|title=Bingham Co. Warehouse|work=-The Plain Dealer|date=April 7, 1977|page=D9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=peery&gt;{{cite news|last=Peery|first=Richard M.|title=Victor Peters, 88 Was Bingham Inc. President|work=The Plain Dealer|date=July 9, 1997|page=B11}}&lt;/ref&gt; It features extremely high-quality construction and design, which is unusual for a utilitarian building. It is also, according to the ''Ohio Historic Places Dictionary'', an early example of "vertical rectangular construction of a building in a manner clearly appropriate to its function."{{sfn|''Ohio Historic Places Dictionary''|2008|page=192}}

The structure is widely celebrated for the inspired use of paving brick seconds, which adds color and texture to the building.{{sfn|''Ohio Historic Places Dictionary''|2008|page=192}} The exterior is considered unusually sophisticated,{{sfn|Johannesen|1998|pages=48, 50}} with "subtle refinements of proportion and detail".{{sfn|''Ohio Historic Places Dictionary''|2008|page=192}} It has also won praise for the simple, repetitive piers that bring it to life.{{sfn|Johannesen|1998|page=50}}

==History of the building==
With the completion of the warehouse, the W. Bingham Co. shifted from retail to wholesale-only operations.&lt;ref name=binghamco /&gt; Over the years, changes to the interior reduced the available space to just {{convert|500000|sqft|m2}}.&lt;ref name=bryan&gt;{{cite news|last=Bryan|first=John E.|title=Last of Bingham Inventory Bought|work=-The Plain Dealer|date=August 26, 1961|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

W. Bingham Co. ceased operations in June 1961.&lt;ref name=peery /&gt; Several executives with the company purchased the corporate indicia, inventory, and equipment and formed a new company, Bingham, Inc.&lt;ref name=peery /&gt; The new firm continued to sell Bingham products to manufacturing, mining, and railroad customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bingham Industrial Line to Continue|work=-The Plain Dealer|date=May 26, 1961|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; W. Bingham Co. continued to own the warehouse,&lt;ref name=bryan /&gt; and leased space in it to various kinds of firms (including Bingham Inc.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Geo. Worthington Co.|work=-The Plain Dealer|date=June 27, 1977|page=C9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some time on or before 1971, the Bingham building was purchased by the Ostendorf-Morris Co., a local real estate investment company.&lt;ref name=attention /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Scott|first=Jane|title=Singing Is the High Note of Her Life|work=-The Plain Dealer|date=July 29, 1973|page=G10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1973, the W. Bingham Co. warehouse was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref name=naversen /&gt;

Having been purchased by outside investors in 1970 and by Formweld Products Co. in 1973, Bingham Co. moved out of the building in 1980.&lt;ref name=peery /&gt;

During the W. Bingham Co. warehouse's first half century, Cleveland and the [[Warehouse District, Cleveland|Warehouse District]] went into significant decline. The rapid and significant expansion in [[heavy industry]] in Cleveland ended about 1930, and contracted dramatically after 1950. As the century neared its close, only chemical, instrument and medical equipment, and plastics manufacturing remained as major employers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stapleton|first=Darwin H.|title=Industry|website=The Encyclopedia of Cleveland History|date=2017|accessdate=May 13, 2017|url=https://case.edu/ech/articles/i/industry/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city's population reached a high of 914,808 in 1950, but dropped to under 400,000 at the turn of the century (and continued to decline).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Exner|first=Rich|title=Cleveland Population Loss Slows|work=The Plain Dealer|date=May 19, 2016|accessdate=May 13, 2017|url=http://www.cleveland.com/datacentral/index.ssf/2016/05/cleveland_population_slows_fin.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Warehouse District, 115 of the 175 buildings, representing more than half the area, were demolished.&lt;ref name=litt&gt;{{cite news|last=Litt|first=Steven|title=Planning a Smart, Solid Warehouse District Rejuvenation|work=The Plain Dealer|date=March 21, 1993|page=H3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of residents living in the area had dropped from a high of 12,068 in 1950 to a low of 3,844 in 1970 (although they had recovered slightly to 4,651 in 1990).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|author=Cleveland City Planning Commission|title=2000 Cleveland Neighborhood Fact Sheets:  Downtown|location=Cleveland, Ohio|date=May 30, 2003|page=1|accessdate=May 13, 2017|url=http://planning.city.cleveland.oh.us/census/factsheets/spa15.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161211055131/http://planning.city.cleveland.oh.us/census/factsheets/spa15.pdf|archivedate=December 11, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===2000-2004 renovation and repurposing===
At the beginning of the 21st century, the W. Bingham Co. warehouse was relatively unused. A few small city and county agencies and offices had leased space on the structure's ground floor, while the remainder of the building was used for storage or was empty. Although the building had never been renovated in the past 85 years, it was in good condition. It was also the largest building in the Warehouse District which had yet to undergo demolition or redevelopment.{{sfn|Historic Warehouse District Development Corporation|2002|page=25}}

In February 2000, Bingham Burnside LLC, a company established by owners and executives of the Burnside Construction Co. of Chicago, initiated a process to purchase the Bingham building for an undisclosed sum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lubinger|first=Bill|title=Window Could Close For Convention Center If City Doesn't Move|work=The Plain Dealer|date=February 27, 2000|page=H1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bingham Burnside sought to redevelop the structure into a [[mixed-use development]]. The company planned spending $66.7 million (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|66700000|2001|r=-5}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars) on converting {{convert|379606|sqft|m2}} of space into 339 apartments, {{convert|292666|sqft|m2}} of space into a 340-vehicle parking garage,{{Efn|Architectural plans called for using the three basements and the rear of the first and second floor for parking. The front of the first floor would be retail, and the front of the second floor residential. Floors three through eight would be completely residential.{{sfn|Historic Warehouse District Development Corporation|2002|page=42}}}} and {{convert|21000|sqft|m2}} of space into ground-floor retail. Bingham Burnside hired Marous Brothers Construction as the general contractor overseeing the project, which it hoped to begin on April 1, 2001. To pay for the conversion, Bingham Burnside received a $2 million (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|2700000|2001|r=-5}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars) loan from the city of Cleveland, $7.4 million (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|7400000|2001|r=-5}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars) in historic preservation tax credits from the state; and a $7.8 million (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|7800000|2001|r=-5}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars) conservation easement from the state. The city also agreed to give the developers a 75 percent [[Tax holiday|tax abatement]] for the project's first five years, a 50 percent tax abatement for its next five years, and a 25 percent tax abatement in its 11th and 12th years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Thomas|first=Corwin|title=Cleveland OKs Loan For Bingham Redo|work=The Plain Dealer|date=December 9, 2001|page=G4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Relocation of tenants was nearly complete by early June 2002, somewhat behind schedule. By then, the cost of converting the {{convert|693272|sqft|m2|adj=on}} building{{Efn|Footage reports varied. In 1993, ''[[The Plain Dealer]]'' newspaper had said the building only had {{convert|558000|sqft|m2}} of interior space.&lt;ref name=litt /&gt;}} had risen to $70 million (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|70000000|2001|r=-5}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Thomas|first=Corwin|title=Bingham Building Job Hinges On 3 Remaining Tenants|work=The Plain Dealer|date=June 2, 2002|page=G4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development]] (HUD) awarded Bingham Burnside a $41.8 million (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|41800000|2002|r=-5}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars) conversion loan.&lt;ref name=corwinboost /&gt; The Bingham became the largest HUD-financed project in Ohio to date.&lt;ref name=corwinHUD&gt;{{cite news|last=Thomas|first=Corwin|title=Bingham Building Will Be Largest Done By HUD In Ohio|work=The Plain Dealer|date=October 19, 2002|page=G4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The loan allowed construction on the project to begin in the fall of 2002,&lt;ref name=corwinboost&gt;{{cite news|last=Thomas|first=Corwin|title=Bingham Building Project Gets Boost|work=The Plain Dealer|date=July 7, 2002|page=G4}}&lt;/ref&gt; with construction expected to be completed in summer 2003.&lt;ref name=corwinHUD /&gt;

Unanticipated construction delays meant that the Bingham apartments did not open until May 2004.&lt;ref name=breck&gt;{{cite news|last=Breckenridge|first=Tom|title=Downtown Lifestyle For Sale in Cleveland Warehouse District Inspiring Revolution|work=The Plain Dealer|date=August 29, 2004|page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final cost of the conversion was $80 million (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|80000000|2003|r=-5}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars).&lt;ref name=breck /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Zimmerman|first=Susan|title=Warehouse District Tour Supports Area Renovation|work=The Plain Dealer|date=December 17, 2003|page=E2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2004, Constantino's Market opened in {{convert|9600|sqft|m2}} of space on the ground floor of the Burnham on W. 9th Street. The space, a former showroom for W. Bingham Co. hardware goods, was restored and conserved. Although the space was broken up by several columns, these were reutilized as display shelves. Constantino's received a $380,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|380000|2004|r=-5}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars) below-market loan from the city to help pay for the space's renovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Breckenridge|first=Tom|title=New Grocery Store Is Marketing Tool For Downtown|work=The Plain Dealer|date=January 23, 2005|page=B1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conversion awards===
The conversion of the warehouse won two awards.  The first was the Downtown Development Award, given by the Downtown Cleveland Partnership in March 2005 to Bingham Burnside .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Carney, Rains Honored For Developing Downtown|work=The Plain Dealer|date=March 9, 2005|page=C3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second Award for Excellence in Renovation (Other Buildings), given by the Northern Ohio Chapter of the National Association of Industrial and Office Properties to Marous Brothers Construction in May 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Montgomery|first=Christopher|title=Developers, Architects Recognized By Group|work=The Plain Dealer|date=May 5, 2005|page=C3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ownership changes===
Burnside Construction suffered severe economic losses during the [[Great Recession]] of 2008-2010, and in May 2007 filed for [[Chapter 7, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 7 bankruptcy]] (liquidation). Although The Bingham apartment building was 80 percent full and Constantino's was expanding its space on the ground floor, Bingham Burnside LLC was unable to make its loan payments without the support of its parent company. HUD seized the mortgage and [[title (property)|title]] to the building, and actioned off the mortgage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jarboe|first=Michelle|title=Investor Files To Foreclose On Downtown Apartments|work=The Plain Dealer|date=April 17, 2010|page=C1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Resource Real Estate bought the loan for $25 million in March 2010, and successfully completed a foreclosure proceeding against Bingham Burnside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jarboe|first=Michelle|title=Investor acquires Quay 55's mortgage|work=The Plain Dealer|date=October 5, 2010|page=C1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Resource Real Estate won court approval to sell The Bingham in July 2010 in order to satisfy the mortgage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jarboe|first=Michelle|title=Bingham, In Foreclosure, Will Be Auctioned Off Soon|work=The Plain Dealer|date=August 14, 2010|page=C1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The son of [[Bruce Jenner]] and actress [[Linda Thompson (actress)|Linda Thompson]], he was born and raised in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]]. In 2005, Jenner appeared in the [[reality television]] series, ''[[The Princes of Malibu]]'', which additionally featured his eldest brother, [[Brandon Jenner]], and his friend, [[Spencer Pratt]].

In 2007, he began dating [[Lauren Conrad]], a primary cast member of ''[[The Hills (TV series)|The Hills]]'', and subsequently came to prominence after being cast in the series during the second season. Their brief relationship ultimately ended his friendship with Pratt. The following year, Jenner was commissioned in his own [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] series, ''[[Bromance (TV series)|Bromance]]'', in which he was intended to find another companion in Pratt's absence. However, it was canceled after its inaugural season after receiving underwhelming ratings.

In 2009, Conrad left ''The Hills'' to pursue other career opportunities and was replaced by Jenner's ex-girlfriend, [[Kristin Cavallari]]. Their rekindled relationship became the central focus of the series until its conclusion the following year. In 2013, Jenner returned to reality television, appearing on ''[[Keeping Up with the Kardashians]]'' during its eighth season, which featured Bruce and his stepmother [[Kris Jenner]]; his  stepsiblings, [[Kourtney Kardashian|Kourtney]], [[Kim Kardashian|Kim]], [[Khloé Kardashian|Khloé]], and [[Rob Kardashian|Rob]]; and his half-sisters, [[Kendall Jenner|Kendall]] and [[Kylie Jenner]].

==Life and career==
Jenner was born in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], on August 21, 1983, to reality television personality and retired [[1976 Summer Olympics|Olympics]] champion [[Bruce Jenner]] (formerly Bruce Jenner) and actress [[Linda Thompson (actress)|Linda Thompson]]. He is the half-brother to Burton "Burt" and Cassandra "Casey" Jenner through Caitlyn's marriage to Chrystie Crownover, which lasted from 1972 until 1981. Jenner is the younger brother of Brandon Jenner, also a reality-television personality.

After Jenner's parents divorced in 1985, Bruce Jenner married [[Kris Jenner|Kris Kardashian]], the ex-wife of attorney [[Robert Kardashian]], in 1991. Consequently, Jenner became a stepbrother of [[Kourtney Kardashian|Kourtney]], [[Kim Kardashian|Kim]], [[Khloé Kardashian|Khloé]], and [[Rob Kardashian]]. Kris gave birth to his half-sisters [[Kendall Jenner|Kendall]] and [[Kylie Jenner]] in 1995 and 1997.

Also in 1991, Thompson remarried to composer and record producer [[David Foster]]. In 2005, Thompson, Foster, the Jenner brothers, and their friend [[Spencer Pratt]] starred in the [[reality television]] series ''[[The Princes of Malibu]]''. However, the series was cancelled soon after its premiere when Thompson filed for divorce from Foster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0464767/plotsummary|title=The Princes of Malibu Plot Summary|accessdate=2012-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, [[MTV]] developed the reality television series ''[[The Hills (TV series)|The Hills]]'' as the [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of ''[[Laguna Beach: The Real Orange County]]''. It originally chronicled the lives of [[Lauren Conrad]], who appeared on its predecessor, her housemate [[Heidi Montag]], and friends [[Audrina Patridge]] and [[Whitney Port]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/31/arts/television/31heff.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin|title='The Hills,' a Follow-Up to 'Laguna Beach,' Makes Its Premiere on MTV|author= Virginia Heffernan|work=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=May 31, 2006|accessdate=May 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Jenner began dating Conrad, which led to the deterioration with his friendship with Pratt. After Conrad established companionships with Jenner and [[Frankie Delgado]], Pratt severed ties with both men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/shows/the_hills/season_3/episode.jhtml?episodeID=120176|title=The Hills (Season 3) Ep. 305: Rolling With The Enemy|work=MTV|publisher=Viacom|date=September 3, 2007|accessdate=May 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Jenner hosted and Executive produced his own reality show ''[[Bromance (TV series)|Bromance]]'', in which young men competed to become part of his entourage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/shows/bromance/cast.jhtml|title=Bromance Cast Bios|accessdate=2012-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jenner has modeled for [[Guess (clothing)|Guess]] clothing, [[Agent Provocateur (lingerie)|Agent Provocateur]] underwear,&lt;ref&gt;White, Nicholas.

'''Charles Schein''' (September 25, 1928 &amp;ndash; May 1, 2003) was a [[polymer chemistry|polymer chemist]]. A political refugee and (Jewish) survivor of the Holocaust from [[Romania]], he arrived in Paris in 1946 and enrolled at the [[University of Paris]]. After receiving his degree, Schein joined the adhesives-formulating group at the French branch of [[Honeywell]]. There he developed the modern form of [[polyvinylchloride]] (PVC)-based [[seam sealant]] used in the manufacturing of [[automobile]]s. In the late 1950s, with Honeywell's consent, he founded [[Caourep]]. In the 1960s and 70s the Caourep Group followed French and other European [[OEM]] automotive producers as they expanded in the first postwar recovery wave of [[globalization]]. Caourep established its own plants or licensees in every country in which [[Renault]], [[Peugeot]], [[Fiat]], [[VW]], and [[Daimler-Benz]] operated directly or by licensing. By the late 1970s, Caourep had become a supplier to the overseas operations of [[Ford]], [[General Motors|GM]], and [[Chrysler]]. By 1977, Caourep was the largest producer of OEM automotive [[adhesive]]s and [[sealant]]s in the world.

'''Cryogenic deflashing''' is a [[deflashing]] process that uses [[cryogenic]] temperatures to aid in the removal of [[flash (manufacturing)|flash]] on [[casting|cast]] or [[molding (process)|molded]] workpieces. These temperatures cause the flash to become stiff or brittle and to break away cleanly. Cryogenic deflashing is the preferred process when removing excess material from oddly shaped, custom molded products.
==Process==
Parts are loaded into a parts basket.  A cryogen, such as [[liquid nitrogen]], is used to cool the workpieces; once cooled they are [[Tumble finishing|tumbled]] and [[media blasting|blasted]] with media pellets, ranging size from {{convert|0.006|to|0.080|in}}. In some instances, cryogenic deflashing does not utilize a blasting action, relying instead only on the tumbling of the parts to remove flash on the outer edges.

==Advantages==
Cryogenic deflashing provides various advantages over manual deflashing and other traditional deflashing methods.
* The process maintains part integrity and critical tolerances.
* Since it is a batch process, the price per piece is far less as many more parts can be processed in a given amount of time.
* Cryogenic deflashing extends mold life. Rather than replace or repair a mold (which typically involves downtime and high cost), the parts can be deflashed. This is typical of parts molded at the end of their [[product lifetime]].
* The process is computer controlled, therefore removing the human operator variable from the process. 
* The process offers consistent results from lot to lot. 
* Cryogenic deflashing is non-abrasive. 
* The cost per part is generally well below any alternative technique.

==Applications==
A wide range of molded materials can utilize cryogenic deflashing with proven results. These include:
* [[Silicone]]s
* [[Plastic]]s – (both thermoset &amp; thermoplastic)
* [[Rubber]]s – (including neoprene &amp; urethane)
* [[Liquid crystal polymer]] (LCP)
* Glass-filled nylons
* Aluminum zinc die cast

Examples of applications that use cryogenic deflashing include:
* [[O-ring]]s &amp; [[gasket]]s
* Catheters and other in-vitro medical
* Insulators and other electric / electronic
* Valve stems, washers and fittings
* Tubes and flexible boots
* Face masks &amp; goggles

Today, many molding operations are using cryogenic deflashing instead of rebuilding or repairing molds on products that are approaching their [[End-of-life (product)|end-of-life]]. It is often more prudent and economical to add a few cents of production cost for a part than invest in a new molding tool that can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars and has a limited service life due to declining production forecasts.

In other cases, cryogenic deflashing has proven to be an enabling technology, permitting the economical manufacture of high quality, high precision parts fabricated with cutting edge materials and compounds.

He began his career in the bazaars of Iran at the age of fourteen and by the age of eighteen moved to [[Manchester]], [[England]]. He has three children and five grandchildren, and now lives in [[Manchester]] and [[London]].

==Peerage==
Alliance was appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (CBE) in the [[1984 New Year Honours]]&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=49583 |date=31 December 1983 |page=8 |supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the [[1989 New Year Honours]]&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=51578 |date=30 December 1988 |page=1 |supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; received a [[Knight Bachelor|knighthood]], the honour being bestowed 9 February 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=51720 |date=2 May 1989 |page=5227}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was created a [[life peer]] as '''Baron Alliance''', of [[Manchester]] in the [[Greater Manchester|County of Greater Manchester]] on 1 July 2004&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=57346 |date=6 July 2004 |page=8399}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sits on the Liberal Democrat benches.

Lord Alliance, with Harry Djanogly, turned [[Coats PLC|Coats Viyella]] into a £2bn textile business. David Alliance is also one of the primary investors of the web measurement company [[SimilarWeb]].&lt;ref name="reuters"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/09/29/internet-measurement-idUSL6N0RT0Y020140929?type=companyNews&amp;feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=companyNews|title=SimilarWeb unifies mapping of mobile and computer Web &amp;#124; Reuters|author=Reuters Editorial|publisher=reuters.com|accessdate=7 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''DealCenter''' is a social media platform and online meeting management system used at trade shows and events for arranging face-to-face meetings.  DealCenter, LLC was established January 2008 though the online meeting planner has been designed and in use by [[Jaymie Scotto &amp; Associates]] as an event planning product since 2005, pre-dating today’s social networking communities.  The DealCenter platform is an easy and user-friendly way to see who else is attending or exhibiting an event, to search the list of attendees by relevant information (such as company name, product offering or area served etc.) and then to create one-on-one meetings that will be held on-site at the event.  The DealCenter system is traditionally rolled out months before the show date, so attendees can pre-plan their meetings and attend the event with a scheduled timetable of targeted prospect, customer or partner meetings.

To utilize the platform, attendees and exhibitors log on to the customized event website and are able to see the profiles of other participants who will be attending the event. The DealCenter manages the meeting schedules, accepts or declines invitations and allows users to send secure messages via the DealCenter to further expand the business opportunity pipeline. All the planning is done through the platform interface, enabling users to arrive with a roster of meetings already scheduled and confirmed. No contact information is shared or released unless the user voluntarily provides it. The confirmed meetings are assigned a table number and held on-site in a designated area, including, if desired, meeting rooms, bilateral tables, exhibit booths and/or a DealCenter Area. 
The '''DealCenter Concierge Service''' is a new development within the DealCenter technology. The Concierge Service automatically schedules meetings on a user's behalf based on the information provided when creating a profile.

=== Undergraduate admissions ===
Duke Kunshan University admitted its first undergraduate students as part of the Class of 2022. Significantly exceeding its original target of 1,500 applicants, the university received a total of 3,143 applications for an estimated 225 first-year spots, including 2,551 applications from China and 332 from the United States. There were 80 countries represented in the applicant pool, including Kazakhstan, South Korea, Pakistan, and Ethiopia.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.heraldsun.com/news/local/counties/durham-county/article200601389.html|title=Applicants for slots at its Kunshan, China campus swamping Duke projections. See why.|work=heraldsun|access-date=2018-06-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In March 2018, DKU admitted 251 students, or 7.98% of its inaugural applicant pool, a selectivity similar to the 8.3% acceptance rate at Duke University.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dukechronicle.com/article/2018/04/duke-kunshan-university-accepts-250-students-to-its-class-of-2022|title=Duke Kunshan University accepts 250 students to its class of 2022|work=The Chronicle|access-date=2018-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chinese students applying to DKU are required to take the [[National Higher Education Entrance Examination|Gaokao]], the national college entrance exam of the People's Republic of China. The Gaokao enables students to list Duke Kunshan University as one of their college choices. International students, including those from the United States, submit transcripts, [[SAT]] or [[ACT (test)|ACT]] standardized test scores, and application essays.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Duke Kunshan University has planned to expand each undergraduate class to 500 students, for a total of 2,000 undergraduates.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Academic programs ===
Duke Kunshan University has signed legally binding agreements with [[Education Ministry of China]] that guaranteed academic freedom on campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/09ecaae2-ccd0-11e7-b781-794ce08b24dc|title=Beijing vies for greater control of foreign universities in China|date=2017-11-19|website=Financial Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Campus ==
[[File:Suzhou Kunshan - Lianshubang IMG 8871.jpg|thumb|Panorama of the central business district of Kunshan, Jiangsu, China|alt=|318x318px]]

Duke Kunshan is located in a 200-acre campus in [[Kunshan]], a city in [[Jiangsu province]]. The campus is to become the center of the Duke Creative Park, part of the city's “Five Zones, One Line” plan for urban renewal. The area will host the Sino-US (Kunshan) Technology Innovation Center and serve as a mixed-used project integrating R&amp;D centers, business services, and ecological parks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://en.savills.com.cn/_news/article/37198/168900-0/9/2018/kunshan-releases-%E2%80%9Cfive-zones--one-line%E2%80%9D-plan-for-urban-renewal|title=Kunshan releases “Five Zones, One Line” plan for urban renewal|access-date=2018-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adjacent to campus is the Dayu Bay Commercial Street, which features a [[Starbucks]], a dozen restaurants, convenience store, social hall, clothing and sporting good shops, and a [[Duke Blue Devils|Duke]]-themed sports bar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://today.duke.edu/2018/08/students-around-world-move-duke-kunshan-university|title=Students From Around the World Move in at Duke Kunshan University|access-date=2018-11-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kunshan's location between [[Shanghai]] and [[Suzhou]] allows easy access to these major metropolitan centers by highways and high-speed railway. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://global.duke.edu/duke-kunshan-university-virtual-tour|title=A Duke Kunshan University Virtual Tour|last=|first=|date=|website=Duke Global|archive-url=|archive-date=July 7, 2016|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The campus blends traditional [[Chinese architecture|Chinese]] elements with advanced educational technology in a spacious, modern setting. Extensive aquatic elements, including an aquatic quadrangle at the center of campus, symbolize the region's famous water towns and are integrated throughout the campus, while information technology and Telepresence systems provide connections to colleagues and classmates around the world. The site has a high water table, so designers elected to preserve 40 acres as [[Community gardening|community gardens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dukekunshan.edu.cn/en/campus|title=The Campus of Duke Kunshan University in China{{!}}Medical Physics{{!}}Global Health{{!}}Health Physics{{!}}DKU, dku.edu.cn|website=dukekunshan.edu.cn|language=en|access-date=2018-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Duke Kunshan University Campus Panorama.jpg|thumb|456x456px|Panorama of Phase I of Duke Kunshan University's Water Feature, which separates the Academic Building (L), Conference Center (R) and Innovation Center (Background).]]The campus is being constructed in phases, with Phase I designed by American design and architecture firm [[Gensler]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gensler.com/projects/duke-kunshan-university|title=Duke Kunshan University {{!}} Projects {{!}} Gensler|website=Gensler|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phase 1 facilities include an academic building with a variety of classroom configurations, a 200-bed dormitory building, a conference center and hotel, a faculty residence, and an administration building.

The Global Health Research Center (GHRC), founded in 2013, is the first research center at Duke Kunshan University. The GHRC uses innovative approaches to research and solve important health and health policy challenges in China and around the world. The GHRC is built on the principles of scientific excellence and focuses on establishing interdisciplinary, mutually-beneficial collaborations with researchers from China. It will host national and international conferences to disseminate research findings and encourage dialogue among scientists, professionals, policy-makers and other key stakeholders engaged in global health. 

The GHRC focuses on four research areas: emerging infectious diseases, environmental health, health policy and systems, and non-communicable chronic diseases. Between 2013-2018, researchers at the GHRC have published over 160 peer-reviewed papers in a variety of journals including the Lancet, Lancet Global Health, JAMA, JAMA Internal Medicine, Circulation, PLOS Medicine, American Journal of Public Health, and American Journal of Epidemiology.

The faculty and research activities complement the global health education programs offered at Duke Kunshan University, including the Master of Science in Global Health and the undergraduate semester courses in global health.

The Environmental Research Center draws knowledge from an array of fields together to tackle the most pressing environmental challenges in China, Asia and the world. Experts and scholars cooperate and inspire each other over the discussion and research on topics such as energy, climate change, water, ecosystem conservation, environment and public health. The center has become a platform where policy problems come for solutions and where knowledge and talents serve the society.

The '''Gatwick Diamond''' is a name invented as a brand for a loosely defined economic area that surrounds Gatwick Airport, some 30 miles south of London.

== Scope ==
The area stretches from the edge of London and the North Downs in the north to the edge of Brighton and the South Downs in the south, and from Horsham in the west to East Grinstead in the east.  It benefits from two Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty: the [[Surrey Hills AONB|Surrey Hills]] and the [[South Downs National Park]].  It has an area of some 400 square miles and a population of 680,000; its economy generates £20.7bn GDP.  12 million people live within one hour's drive.  There are 406,000 economically active people in the Gatwick Diamond; 81% of the working age population is economically active. 74%  of Gatwick Diamond workers are residents (annual population survey 2011). The unemployment level is very low at 1.4%.  The Gatwick Diamond is home to 45,000 businesses including many UK and European Headquarters.  Some of these companies are: [[Unilever]], [[Exxon Mobil]], [[Toyota]], [[Doosan]], [[Thales Group]], [[Varian Medical Systems]], [[Elekta]], [[Nestle]], [[EDF Energy]], Edwards Vacuum, [[Canon Inc.]] and [[G4S]].  It also contains the Manor Royal Business Park – the largest business park in the UK,&lt;ref name="manorroyal"&gt;[http://www.manorroyal.org/pages/index.cfm Manor Royal Homepage]&lt;/ref&gt; housing 550 businesses and employing around 35,000 people.

== Initiative ==

The Gatwick Diamond Initiative is a business-led private/public partnership that was established in April 2003 to improve the economic performance of the area.&lt;ref name="gdi"&gt;[http://www.gatwickdiamond.co.uk/ Gatwick Diamond Initiative]&lt;/ref&gt;  It now includes seven local borough/district councils ([[Horsham District|Horsham]], [[Crawley]], [[Mid Sussex]], [[Tandridge District|Tandridge]], [[Reigate &amp; Banstead]], [[Mole Valley]] and [[Epsom &amp; Ewell]]) and two county councils ([[West Sussex]] and [[Surrey]]), as well as a range of private sector partners.

One of its first actions was to arrange a meeting of the principal stakeholders (both public and private sector) to determine what actions could be taken to improve the economic performance of the area.  Business leaders considered that the first priority should  be to give the area an image and identity.  The Initiative therefore launched the "Gatwick Diamond" on 15 July 2004. Since then the term "Gatwick Diamond" has achieved widespread recognition and acceptance.  It was first referred to in parliament by [[Nicholas Soames]], MP for Mid Sussex, on 13 Jun 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Hansard https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060613/halltext/60613h0002.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The Gatwick Diamond Initiative lobbies government and the public sector on issues that prevent businesses in the area from growing; they encourage international trade; promote, attract and help UK and foreign inward investors looking to locate in the area; campaign on issues such as Air Passenger Duty, Gatwick's second runway and the [[Gatwick Express]]; and encourage the three Further Education colleges at Redhill, Crawley and Epsom to work together with the [[University of Brighton]] and [[University for the Creative Arts]] to provide Higher and Further Education to meet business needs.

== Economy ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2017}}
The Gatwick Diamond area is situated directly south of London and covers the east of Surrey and northwest of Sussex. The heart of the area is 30 miles from Central London. By rail, the Gatwick Express can get to Central London in 30 minutes. Gatwick Airport is situated at the centre of the Gatwick Diamond and is a nominal 1 hour's drive from Heathrow Airport, subject to frequent delays on the M25. The Gatwick Diamond is within 1 hour from the sea ports of Shoreham and Newhaven and 90 minutes from Dover, Southampton and Portsmouth sea ports. By road, the M23 bisects the Gatwick Diamond and is just 10 minutes from the M25. By bus, the Metrobus Fastway service takes many employees in the Gatwick Diamond to their workplace; coaches leave Gatwick to reach 400 UK towns and cities. The Gatwick Diamond is an economic area worth £20.7bn GDP (growing at 3% per year), with a population of 680,000.

== Gatwick Airport ==

[[Gatwick Airport]] has 48 airlines which fly to 200 destinations, more than any other UK airport. The airport connects to 45 out of 50 top European destinations and over half of the world’s emerging markets. In 2014, the airport had 38.6 million passengers pass through it. This contributes towards Gatwick being the busiest single-runway airport in the world. The airport's railway station was used by 18 million passengers in 2015-16,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://orr.gov.uk/statistics/published-stats/station-usage-estimates|title=Estimates of station usage|last=|first=|date=|website=[[Office of Rail and Road]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it the busiest airport station in the UK.

== The Gatwick Diamond Business Association ==

The Gatwick Diamond Business Association (until 2012, the Crawley and District Industry Association) offers networking opportunities at its monthly members' meetings.  It operates like the other membership organisations in the area such as the Chambers of Commerce, Sussex Enterprise and Surrey Chambers of Commerce and the Federation of Small Businesses, but concentrates on the Gatwick Diamond area. It also delivers the Gatwick Diamond Business Awards.

'''Jane du Pont Lunger''' (June 20, 1914 - September 18, 2001) was an American heiress, philanthropist, and an owner/breeder of [[Thoroughbred]] [[horse racing|racehorses]]. A sixth generation member of [[Delaware|Delaware's]] prominent [[Du Pont family]], her father, [[Philip Francis du Pont]], was a major benefactor to the [[University of Virginia]].

In 1934, Jane du Pont married Harry W. Lunger (1905–1976) who worked at [[All American Aviation|All American Aviation Company]], a company founded by [[Richard Chichester du Pont|Richard du Pont]] and based in Wilmington, Delaware. During 1936-1937 the Lungers built "Oberod," a stone mansion on rural acreage at 400 Burnt Mill Road in the Brandywine River Valley about 8 miles from downtown [[Wilmington, Delaware]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deldot.gov/archaeology/historic_pres/brandywine_valley/pdf/scenic_river_and_highway_study.pdf New Castle County, Delaware, Department of Planning]&lt;/ref&gt; Oberod is now owned by the Wilmington-base [[LabWare]] corporation, who use it as a training facility and to host special events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailylocal.com/article/20120521/NEWS01/120529948/mane-event-for-reins-of-life-at-former-dupont-estate |title=Mane Event for Reins of Life at former duPont estate |publisher=Dailylocal.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the Jane du Pont Lunger Residual Charitable Trust donated $250,000 to the [[The Jockey Club|Grayson-Jockey Club Research Foundation, Inc.]] which underwrites [[veterinary]] research projects dedicated to the well being of horses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jockeyclub.com/mediaCenter.asp?story=194 The Jockey Club].&lt;/ref&gt; Her estate and family are major contributors to the [[Delaware Art Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.delart.org/home.html Delaware Art Museum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091125051829/http://www.delart.org/home.html |date=2009-11-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christiana Stables==
In 1937, Jane and Harry Lunger established Christiana Stables, named for the community of [[Christiana, Delaware]]. Their first [[Horse trainer|trainer]] was [[Selby L. Burch|Selby Burch]], son of U.S. Racing Hall of Fame inductee, [[William P. Burch|William Burch]]. Next, [[T. J. Healey#John A. Healey|John Healey]], son of Hall of Fame trainer [[T. J. Healey|Thomas J. Healey]], took charge of Christiana Stables but he died at age 43 in 1947. Future U.S. Racing Hall of Fame inductee [[Henry S. Clark|Henry Clark]] took over and remained with the Lungers into the 1980s. He was followed by [[James W. Maloney|James Maloney]], [[William Badgett, Jr.]] and then [[James W. Murphy (horseman)|James W. Murphy]].

The Lungers raced some 45 stakes winners, many of which they bred themselves. Among their successful runners were Miss Ferdinand, [[Cyane (horse)|Cyane]], [[Dance Spell]], [[Endine]], Light Hearted, [[Obeah (horse)|Obeah]], Salem, and Thinking Cap. Following the 1976 death of her husband, Jane Lunger continued racing and breeding and enjoyed success with horses such as 1982 [[Blue Grass Stakes]] winner, [[Linkage (horse)|Linkage]]. In 1986, Jane Lunger sent her [[mare]] Obeah to [[Windfields Farm]] in [[Maryland]] where she was bred to [[Deputy Minister (horse)|Deputy Minister]]. The mating resulted in the April 6, 1987 birth of Christiana Stables' greatest foal. A filly Mrs. Lunger named [[Go For Wand]] was born at Walnut Green Farm in [[Unionville, Chester County, Pennsylvania|Unionville, Pennsylvania]] owned by her son-in law, Richard I.G. Jones.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=eAohAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=y3YFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1596,6560758&amp;dq=go+for+wand&amp;hl=en ''The Day'' (New London, Connecticut) - October 27, 1990]&lt;/ref&gt; After a stellar year in which Go For Wand won the 1989 [[Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies]] she was voted  [[American Champion Two-Year-Old Filly]]. In 1990 she won six [[Graded stakes race|Grade 1]] races and earned her second [[Eclipse Award]] as the [[American Champion Three-Year-Old Filly]]. Go For Wand suffered a catastrophic injury while leading down the homestretch in the 1990 [[Breeders' Cup Distaff]] and had to be humanely [[Animal euthanasia|euthanized]]. She was inducted in the U.S. Racing Hall of Fame in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.racingmuseum.org/hall/horse.asp?ID=82 Go For Wand at the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061230041342/http://www.racingmuseum.org/hall/horse.asp?ID=82 |date=2006-12-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, Jane du Pont Lunger was recognized by the Thoroughbred Club of America as their Honored Lady Guest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thethoroughbredclub.com/default.html Thoroughbred Club of America]&lt;/ref&gt;

Jane du Pont Lunger was still significantly involved with racing and breeding at the time of her death in 2001 at age eighty-seven.

'''Joseph Reid Dodson''' [[Justice of the Peace|JP]] (1811/12 – 12 October 1890), was the first [[Mayor of Nelson, New Zealand|Mayor of Nelson]] in New Zealand from 1874. He was a prominent brewer and Resident Magistrate&lt;ref&gt;Editorial, pg2, Nelson Evening Mail, 2 February 1881&lt;/ref&gt; in Nelson and his sixth generation descendants still operate a brewery in the city.

==Early life==
Dodson was originally from England.&lt;ref name="Nelson brewing family"&gt;{{cite web|title=A Nelson brewing family  |url=http://www.theprow.org.nz/nelson-brewing-family/ |publisher=The Prow |accessdate=1 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He arrived in [[Nelson, New Zealand|Nelson]] on 16 May 1854 from Melbourne in Australia on the [[brig]] [[Return (ship)|''Return'']] (via Wellington).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Shipping Intelligence|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=NENZC18540520.2.3 |accessdate=1 December 2010|newspaper=Nelson Examiner and New Zealand Chronicle |volume=XIII |issue=637 |date=20 May 1854 |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within days, he bought a share of a Nelson brewery. Soon afterwards, he returned to Melbourne to sort out his business affairs.&lt;ref name="obituary"&gt;{{cite news|title=Obituary|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=NEM18901013.2.8|accessdate=1 December 2010|newspaper=Nelson Evening Mail |volume=XXIV |issue=242 |date=13 October 1890 |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned with his wife and four children on the [[Marchioness (ship)|''Marchioness'']], arriving on 27 September 1854.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Shipping Intelligence|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=NENZC18540930.2.3 |accessdate=1 December 2010|newspaper=Nelson Examiner and New Zealand Chronicle |volume=XIII |issue=671 |date=30 September 1854 |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional career==
After his first arrival from Melbourne, Dodson bought the shares of the late Dr Renwick in the Hooper &amp; Co brewery. In 1855, he established the Raglan Brewery and leased Charles Harley's Bridge Street Brewery. In 1860, he sold his brewery shares and went back to England with his family for six years. On his return to Nelson, he brought farming equipment with him and established himself as a reseller of these goods. Once he was established, he took up a shareholding in Hooper &amp; Co again.&lt;ref name="Nelson brewing family" /&gt;&lt;ref name=obituary /&gt;

In 1884, Dodson suffered a significant loss with the death of his business partner of 30 years, George Hooper. Dodson took over Hooper's shareholding, and the name of the brewery changed to ''J. R. Dodson &amp; Son''.&lt;ref name=obituary /&gt; His son Henry had joined the business in 1879. Henry Duncan joined them in 1888; he was the son of Joseph Dodson's daughter Mary-Ann.&lt;ref name="Nelson brewing family" /&gt;

Descendants of Henry Duncan have continued brewing.&lt;ref name="Nelson brewing family" /&gt; His great-grandchildren Matt Duncan and Callum Duncan now operate a boutique brewery of international acclaim. Founders Brewery, established in 1999, was the first fully certified organic brewery in the southern hemisphere. They have twice won the award of ''Champion Small Brewery'' at the [[Australian International Beer Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sons continue brewing tradition |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/marlborough-express/lifestyle/2392379 |accessdate=2 December 2010|newspaper=The Marlborough Express |date=7 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==
Dodson was former member of the Board of Works. He was elected a Councillor, possibly in 1874, and elected by his fellow Councillors as Mayor at a Council meeting on 1 May 1874.&lt;ref name="1874 mayoral election"&gt;{{cite news|title=Election of Mayor |url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=NEM18740502.2.8.1|accessdate=2 December 2010 |newspaper=Nelson Evening Mail |volume=IX |issue=104 |date=2 May 1874 |page=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was appointed [[Justice of the Peace]] in 1874.&lt;ref name="JP"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Nelson Evening Mail|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=NEM18740608.2.9|accessdate=2 December 2010 |newspaper=Nelson Evening Mail |volume=IX |issue=135 |date=8 June 1874 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This provoked some debate in the local papers about the behaviour of the Provincial Superintendent in comparison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Nelson Evening Mail |url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=NEM18740620.2.7 |accessdate=2 December 2010 |newspaper=Nelson Evening Mail |volume=IX |issue=146 |date=20 June 1874 |page=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Nihongo|'''Jujiro Matsuda'''|松田 重次郎|Matsuda Jūjirō|August 8, 1875 – March 27, 1952}} was a [[Japanese people|Japanese]] industrialist and businessman who founded automobile manufacturer [[Mazda|Mazda Motor Corporation]].

==Early life==
The son of a [[fisherman]], Jujiro Matsuda was born in [[Hiroshima]]. He was apprenticed to a blacksmith in [[Osaka]] at the age of fourteen and invented the "Matsuda-type pump" in 1906. Later, he took over management of the foundry at which he apprenticed and changed the name of the organization to "Matsuda Pump Partnership". He was forced out of his company, but started an [[weapon|armament]] manufacturer soon after – the eponymously named Matsuda Works. Matsuda would see his fledgling company's fortunes improve when it was commissioned as a supplier to the [[Tsar]] of Russia&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drivingtoday.com/wbz4/greatest_cars/mazda_mx5_miata/index.html |title=Mazda MX-5 by Jack Nerad for Driving Today |accessdate=2007-07-25 |publisher=Driving Today |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928004629/http://www.drivingtoday.com/wbz4/greatest_cars/mazda_mx5_miata/index.html |archivedate=2007-09-28 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as manufacturing the [[Type 99 rifle]] for the [[Military of Japan|Japanese military]].

==Toyo Kogyo and Mazda==
By 1921, Jujiro Matsuda was a wealthy man thanks to his previous business ventures. He moved back to [[Hiroshima]] when he was asked to take over management of floundering artificial [[Cork (material)|cork]] manufacturer {{Nihongo|Toyo Cork Kogyo Co., Ltd.|東洋コルク工業株式会社|Tōyō Koruku Kōgyō Kabushiki Gaisha}}, which was placed into receivership by its creditors when the market for artificial cork dried up following the end of World War I.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; The unprofitable cork business ceased, and Matsuda focused on tool manufacturing. 1931 oversaw the introduction of the "[[Mazda Mazdago|Mazdago]]" motorized tricycle,&lt;ref name="mazda"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mazda.com/en/innovation/mazda-stories/mazda/behind/ |title=A Story Behind the Name of “Mazda” |accessdate=2018-10-30 |publisher=Mazda }}&lt;/ref&gt; manufactured in what is now [[Fuchū, Hiroshima (Aki)|Fuchū city]] and the company, now known as {{Nihongo|Toyo Kogyo Co., Ltd.|東洋工業株式会社|Tōyō Kōgyō Kabushiki Gaisha}}, would set its focus on motor vehicle manufacturing.

The Toyo Kogyo headquarters saw heavy damage on August 6, 1945 upon the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|bombing of Hiroshima]]. The [[Fuchū, Hiroshima (Aki)|Fuchū city]] plant, located over 5 kilometers from the epicenter of the nuclear explosion was left relatively unscathed, and Matsuda offered its use for the Hiroshima bureau of [[NHK]].

Matsuda was not accused of being nor was he charged as a war conspirator, and a revitalized Toyo Kogyo was the main force behind repairing the damaged economy of Hiroshima following World War II. In 1950, Toyo Kogyo provided startup for a [[baseball]] team, the [[Hiroshima Carp]].

His adopted son-in-law, Tsuneji Matsuda succeeded him as president of Toyo Kogyo,&lt;ref name="mazda" /&gt; and oversaw the expansion of its automobile division until 1979, when [[Ford Motor Company]] took a 25% equity stake in Toyo Kogyo.

The alliance with Ford led to the divestiture of shares from the Matsuda family and the change of Toyo Kogyo into [[Mazda Motor Corporation]] in 1984. The Matsuda family still owns a controlling interest in the [[Hiroshima Toyo Carp]].

Matsuda died on March 27, 1952. For his contributions to [[Hiroshima Prefecture]], a bronze statue of Jujiro Matsuda was created in 1965 by [[Onomichi, Hiroshima]] native, sculptor Katsuzou Entsuba and was erected at the Hijiyama Park in [[Minami-ku, Hiroshima]].

==APO Japan==
In the 1970s, Nami became vice president of APO Japan Co., an auto equipment sales company in Tokyo. The company was involved in a [[pyramid scheme]], collecting investments from about 250,000 people in a scam based on sales of exhaust gas removal devices.

==Nozakku==
In 1973, before the bankruptcy of APO Japan, Nami established Nozakku Co., a company which sold "magic stones" that were claimed to turn tapwater into natural water.&lt;ref name="yomiuri20080207"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/national/news/20090207-OYT1T00164.htm|archive-url=https://archive.is/20090210212752/http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/national/news/20090207-OYT1T00164.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=10 February 2009|script-title=ja:ウォン天・ドル天構想も、波容疑者「マルチ人生」３０年|date=7 February 2009|accessdate=9 February 2009|publisher=''[[Yomiuri Shimbun]]''|language= Japanese}} &lt;/ref&gt; The company's annual sales reached more than 2 billion yen a year before it too went bankrupt in 1978.

==L&amp;G and "Enten"==

After being released from prison, Nami established the Tokyo-based bedding company L&amp;G in August 1987. The company allegedly derived its income from a pyramid scheme.&lt;ref name="dailyyomiuri20080208"/&gt; At L&amp;G, he invented the [[Enten currency investigation|"Enten" quasi-currency]] (literally meaning ''Divine Money'' in Japanese).

==Early life==
[[File:李健熙和父亲李秉喆.jpg|thumb|left|Young Lee Kun-hee with his father Lee Byung-chul]]
Lee Kun-hee was born on 10 January 1942 in Uiryeong, South Gyeongsang, during the [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese occupation of Korea]]. He is the third son of [[Lee Byung-chul]], the founder of the Samsung group.

==Career==
===Samsung===
Lee joined the [[Samsung Group]] in 1968 and took over the chairmanship on December 24, 1987, just two weeks after the death of his father, [[Lee Byung-chul]], who founded Samsung.&lt;ref name="Founded"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.theverge.com/2012/11/30/3709688/samsung-25-years-lee-kun-hee |title=King of Samsung: a chairman's reign of cunning and corruption |last=Byford |first=Sam |date=30 November 2012 |access-date=2018-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1990s, believing that [[Samsung Group]] was overly focused on producing massive quantities of low-quality goods and that it was not prepared to compete in quality, Lee famously said in 1993 "Change everything except your wife and kids" and true to his word attempted to reform the profoundly Korean culture that had pervaded Samsung until this point. Foreign employees were brought in and local employees were shipped out as Lee tried to foster a more international attitude to doing business.

Under Lee's guidance, the company has been transformed from a Korean budget name into a major international force and arguably{{According to whom|date=July 2017}} the most prominent Asian brand worldwide. One of the group's subsidiaries, Samsung Electronics, is now one of the world's leading developers and producers of semiconductors, and was listed in [[Fortune magazine]]'s list of the 100 largest corporations in the world in 2007. Today Samsung's revenues are now 39 times what they were in 1987, it generates around 20 percent of South Korea's GDP, and Lee is the country's richest man.&lt;ref name="The Verge"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2012/11/30/3709688/samsung-25-years-lee-kun-hee|title=King of Samsung: a chairman's reign of cunning and corruption|first=Sam|last=Byford|date=30 November 2012|website=The Verge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Samsung scandal====
On January 14, 2008, Korean police raided Lee's home and office in an ongoing probe into accusations that Samsung was responsible for a slush fund used to bribe influential prosecutors, judges, and political figures in South Korea.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/01/14/business/samsung.php] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080117233025/http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/01/14/business/samsung.php |date=January 17, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 4, 2008, Lee denied allegations against him in the scandal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_national/281425.html |title=Samsung chairman hints at possible resignation : National : Home |language=ko |publisher=English.hani.co.kr |date= |accessdate=2010-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a second round of questioning by the South Korean prosecutors, on April 11, 2008, Lee was quoted by reporters as saying, "I am responsible for everything. I will assume full moral and legal responsibility.” On July 16, 2008, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported the Seoul Central District Court had found Lee guilty on charges of financial wrongdoing and tax evasion. Prosecutors requested Lee be sentenced to seven years in prison and fined 350 billion won (approx $312 million USD). The court fined him 110 billion won (approx $98 million USD) and sentenced him to three years' suspended jail time. Lee has not responded to the verdict.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} Months later, South Korean president [[Lee Myung-bak]] pardoned Lee so he could remain on the International Olympic Committee.&lt;ref name="The Verge" /&gt;

In 2010, the company's former chief legal counsel, Kim Yong-chul, published a book called "Think Samsung". It revealed shocking alleged details of Lee Kun-hee's personal corruption, claiming he stole up to 10 trillion won (approx $8.9 billion USD) from Samsung subsidiaries, destroyed evidence, and bribed government officials to ensure the smooth transfer of power to his son.&lt;ref name="The Verge" /&gt;

==Personal life==
Lee Kun-hee's wife, [[Hong Ra-hee]], is the daughter of [[Hong Jin-ki]], the former chairman of the JoongAng Ilbo and Tongyang Broadcasting Company, and Kim Yoon-nam. Kim was born in the coastal city of Mokpo, South Jeolla. While attending Ewha Womans University as a junior in 1943, she married Hong Jin-ki (1917–86), who at the time was working as a judge at the Jeonju District Court in Jeonju, North Jeolla. The two are survived by four sons and two daughters: Ra-hee, director general of Leeum, Samsung Museum of Art and the wife of Lee Kun-hee; Seok-hyun; Seok-joh, CEO of BGF Retail; Suk-joon, CEO of Bokwang Investment; Seok-kyu, CEO of Bokwang; and Ra-young, deputy director at Leeum. Kim was also the mother-in-law of Cholsoo Charles Lho, publisher of the Korea JoongAng Daily. Kim Youn-nam died of natural causes at Samsung Medical Center in Gangnam District, southern Seoul in 2013 when she was 90 years old.&lt;ref name= "Joongang Daily"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2972683|title=JoongAng's late chairman's wife dies|website=Korea JoongAng Daily}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hong Ra-hee majored in applied art at Seoul National University and gained experience as a museum art director in 1995 at Ho-am Art Museum in Yongin, Gyeonggi Province. The museum was established by Samsung founder Lee Byung-chul in 1978.&lt;ref name= "Korea Herald"/&gt;

Lee's eldest brother's son is currently chairman and CEO of the [[CJ Group]], a company holding businesses in food, beverages and adult entertainment. His second eldest brother's sons ran Saehan Media, one of the largest blank media producers. His older sister is the owner of [[Hansol]] Group, the country's largest paper manufacturer and producer of electronics and [[telecommunications]]. One of his sisters is married to Koo Ja-hak, brother of a former chairman of the [[LG Group]] and himself a former chairman of LG Semiconductor.

[[File:A National Conversation launch.jpg|right|300px|thumb|Scottish First Minister [[Alex Salmond]] and Deputy First Minister [[Nicola Sturgeon]] at the launch of the National Conversation, 14 August 2007]]
[[File:AlexSalmond 2007.jpg|thumb|300px|Alex Salmond during a speech at the National Conversation]]
The '''National Conversation''' was the name given to the [[Scottish Government]]'s [[public consultation]] exercise regarding possible future changes in the power of the [[devolution|devolved]] [[Scottish Parliament]] and the possibility of [[Scottish independence]], a policy objective of the [[Scottish National Party]], who at the time were the [[minority government]] with power over devolved affairs in [[Scotland]], as the [[Scottish Government]]. It culminated in a multi-option white paper for a proposed [[Referendum (Scotland) Bill, 2010]].

==Process==
The National Conversation was launched on 14 August 2007 by [[Alex Salmond]], the [[First Minister of Scotland]]. It consisted of a 59-page [[white paper]], titled [[Choosing Scotland's Future]], and a [[website]]. The white paper included a draft [[bill (proposed law)|bill]] for a [[referendum]] to allow for negotiations with the [[UK Government]] on Scottish independence. The website encourages comments to be made on the white paper. Comments are encouraged from members of the public, rather than just [[interest group]]s.

As a culmination to the National Conversation, a [[white paper]] for the proposed [[Referendum (Scotland) Bill, 2010]] was published on [[St. Andrew's Day]] on 30 November 2009.&lt;ref name=Independent30Nov09SNPReveals&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paper detailed four possible scenarios for Scotland's future, with the text of the Bill and Referendum to be revealed later.&lt;ref name=Independent30Nov09SNPReveals/&gt; The scenarios were: No Change, Devolution per the Calman Review, Full Devolution, and Full Independence.&lt;ref name=Independent30Nov09SNPReveals/&gt;

==Response==
On 6 December 2007, the [[Scottish Parliament]] voted to create a [[Commission on Scottish Devolution]], chaired by Sir [[Kenneth Calman]], and with the remit:

: To review the provisions of the Scotland Act 1998 in the light of experience and to recommend any changes to the present constitutional arrangements that would enable the Scottish Parliament to serve the people of Scotland better, improve the financial accountability of the Scottish Parliament, and continue to secure the position of Scotland within the United Kingdom.

The Commission was supported by the three main [[Unionism in Scotland|pro-Union]] political parties in Scotland: [[Scottish Labour Party|Labour]], [[Scottish Conservative Party|Conservatives]] and [[Scottish Liberal Democrats|Liberal Democrats]]. Wendy Alexander, at the time leader of the Labour party in the Scottish Parliament, proposed the motion, rejecting the National Conversation and an amendment proposed by the [[Scottish National Party]] calling for support for the National Conversation was defeated, Ms Alexander associating it with moves towards [[Scottish independence]] and making the following response:

: The SNP amendment predictably calls for us to participate in the National Conversation, but how can the SNP possibly claim to be leading a conversation when it has already decided what the only acceptable outcome will be? Worst of all, it has no parliamentary mandate whatsoever for the conversation. How can the SNP possibly justify the use of taxpayers' money on something that is little more than propaganda?&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/parliamentarybusiness.aspx#Col4133 Parliamentary Business : Scottish Parliament&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Notably the remit of the Commission on Scottish Devolution precludes the consideration of Scottish independence.

The rejection of the National Conversation by the Scottish Parliament has led to criticisms as to its legitimacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/columnists/alancochrane/3554991/Alex-Salmonds-national-conversation.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=Alex Salmond's national conversation | first=Alan | last=Cochrane | date=2008-02-14 | accessdate=2010-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concerns have also been raised by

===Website controversy===

On 24 April 2008, [[George Foulkes, Baron Foulkes of Cumnock|Lord Foulkes]], a Labour [[Member of the Scottish Parliament]], claimed that the National Conversation had been met with "complete indifference" by the people of Scotland, quoting website visiting figures. He further claimed that the website had become a meeting place for SNP activists, noting also that although 41 comments had been removed from the site, "there are still [[Anglophobia|anti-English]] remarks bordering on [[racism]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotsman.com/news/scotland/top-stories/snp-s-national-conversation-a-chatroom-for-cybernats-1-1165459 SNP's national conversation 'a chatroom for cybernats' - The Scotsman&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influence ==

The initiative influenced the [[Parti Québécois]]{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} and, in March 2008, shortly before the Parti Québécois National Council, leader [[Pauline Marois]] presented the party's plan to propose a ''conversation nationale'' to Quebecers as part of Marois' renewal of the party's approach on independence and [[social democracy]]. In this case, however, the conversation is to be solely on independence, instead of three options. The expression was met with less enthusiasm in [[Quebec]] and arose cynicism in the press and objection with some [[Pur et dur|party hardliners]].&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.ledevoir.com/2008/03/25/181983.html Logique impériale]'' by François Brousseau, 25 March 2008, ''[[Le Devoir]]'' {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080413132628/http://www.ledevoir.com/2008/03/25/181983.html |date=13 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after, the Parti Québécois replaced the term with ''débat sur la souveraineté'' ("debate on [[sovereignty]]").

'''Norton Disney''' is a small village and [[Civil parishes in England|civil parish]] on the western boundary of the [[North Kesteven]] [[Non-metropolitan district|district]] of [[Lincolnshire]], England. The population of the civil parish at the 2011 census was 226.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadKeyFigures.do?a=7&amp;b=11127139&amp;c=Norton+Disney&amp;d=16&amp;e=62&amp;g=6446705&amp;i=1001x1003x1032x1004&amp;m=0&amp;r=1&amp;s=1464259872859&amp;enc=1|title=Civil Parish population 2011|accessdate=26 May 2016|publisher=Office for National Statistics|work=Neighbourhood Statistics}}&lt;/ref&gt;   It lies midway between [[Lincoln, England|Lincoln]] and [[Newark-on-Trent|Newark]], {{convert|2|mi|km|1}} to the south-east of the [[A46 road|A46]].

Norton Disney is the seat of the Disney family, the name an [[Anglicised]] version of the original [[French people|French]] surname ''d'Isigny'', of [[Isigny-sur-Mer]], [[Normandy]], from whom film producer [[Walt Disney]]'s family might be descended.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/uncle-walts-lost-ancestors-1266622.html Uncle Walt's lost ancestors] - The Independent newspaper, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

The Village has one [[public house]], The Green Man, which was formerly the St Vincent Arms.

==History==
There is a commemorative [[Monumental brass|brass]] in the medieval church of St Michael commemorating three generations of the d’Isigny or Disney family, made about 1580.  In the bottom panel is an inscription reading:
:The lyfe, conversacion and Service, of the first above named William Disney and of Richard Disney his sonne were comendable amongest ther Neighbours trewe and fathefull to ther Prince and cuntre &amp; acceptable Thallmighty of whom the truth they are received to Salvation accordinge to the Stedfast faythe which they had in &amp; throughe the mercy and merit of Christ our savior Thees thuthes are thus sett for the that in all ages God maybe thankfully Glorified for thes and suche lyke his gracius benifites.

Two [[mosaic]] floors were found when excavating a [[Roman villa]] in the [[parish]].  The site was near to the [[Roman Britain|Roman town]] of Brough or Crocoalana, on the [[Fosse Way]], just over the border in Nottinghamshire.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

During the Second World War, RAF Station Swinderby (later renamed [[RAF Station Norton Disney]]) was home to No 93 Maintenance Unit (No 93 MU) from Aug 1939 until 1958.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

'''''Omerta – City of Gangsters''''' is a [[simulation game]] with [[Turn-based tactics|turn-based tactical]] game-play elements developed by [[Haemimont Games]] and published by [[Kalypso Media]] for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Mac OS X]] and the [[Xbox 360]]. The game was released in [[German-speaking Europe|German-speaking]] countries on 31 January 2013. The international German download version for Windows was released through the [[Steam (software)|Steam-service]] as well. The English version was released just a day after in the rest of Europe whereas the version for the US market was released on 12 February. A version for Mac OS X was published on 2 August 2013.&lt;ref name="Mac-Release" /&gt;

== Plot ==
The title covers the time of the 1920s - the [[Roaring Twenties]] - at the time of the [[Prohibition in the United States]]. The game's story takes place in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City]], [[Atlantic County, New Jersey|Atlantic County]] where, due to the ban of any alcohol in this era, Mafia organizations were able to become powerful off the back of the illegal [[speakeasy]]s.

In a time where criminal [[gang]]s rule the city and a handful of morally-questionable men were able to succeed through illegal gambling, high-strength spirits and shady machinations, the player's storyline takes place as the main character creates his empire in this melting pot of illegality. Boss D'Angelo is an immigrant who was born in a small village in [[Sicily]] and has just arrived in [[Atlantic City]]. He has to work his way up the ladder through the [[Mafia: The City of Lost Heaven|Mafia]]-like world. Working his way up from nothing, He must establish himself in the criminal underworld by buying and raiding businesses and attacking rivals, all the while simultaneously fulfilling his version of the [[American dream]].

==Story==

Arriving at Atlantic City, Boss D'Angelo begins his foothold on the criminal empire as he makes money off the prohibition and gambling trade. Sending money back to his brother, he keeps his status as a mob boss secret from him as he works for Louie, a Capo under the eye of Danny Corsini, the leader of the Mafia in Atlantic City. His enemies ranges from independent gangsters to the [[Ku Klux Klan]], which is at bitter odds with the growing immigration problem. Eventually tired of working for Louie, he was sent to perform one last job which was revealed to be a trap, as Danny Corsini was the intended target. The Boss thwarts the assassination and becomes a Capo under Corsini.

Expanding his criminal empire eventually allows his brother to come to Atlantic City but not as a brother in crime an [[FBI]] Agent in New York. When the Boss' attempts to set up a source of income through the gambling/nightclub trade draw suspicion to him, Danny Corsini attempts to defend him killing his brother. Forced to turn on Corsini, the Boss emerges victorious. Knowing that his position is fragile, he attempts to unite the Jewish Gangs and Irish Mob in an alliance only for it to be attacked by the KKK. With the D'Angelo mob as the sole survivor of the struggle, the Boss is named Capo de Tutti. He later earns money through real estate and by supporting Mr. Smith as mayor which gives him great influence in the city, upon reaching Michigan Ave his brother offers one last chance for the Boss to come clean, the Boss rejects the idea of selling his men out and eliminates the witnesses who planned to rat out the boss. The Boss came out clean and triumphant and made amends with his brother and owns a private island which he calls Nova Sicilia and his brother left the agency to pursue his dream of being a shipwright and vowed to never speak of their days in the prohibition again.

'''The Japanese Incentive'''

Somewhere in between the meeting of his brother and the death of Louie Castaneda, Boss D'Angelo receives a lucrative offer from a Japanese Yakuza Hikaro Eda and Fritz, a backer who wanted to help Eda exert his influence into America as laws back then prohibited Asians from owning property. There he meets the beautiful Mikoto Mori, the trophy wife of the Yakuza boss. Little did the boss know, she has a personal vendetta against Hikaro and the Boss now is caught in between love for the woman and the wrath of a powerful man.

The story begins with Karl Fritz who approaches the Boss with a deal from Hikaro Eda, an influential Japanese man who had him muscle into McGyure Clan's turf and quickly proves his worth to Hikaro and was tasked with a smuggling job from him. Upon preventing the McGyure Clan from destroying the cargo did he realize what was he smuggling, his wife Kumiko Mori. Angered by the McGyure's attempt at murdering her he personally wipes out the clan and earns a promising alliance with the Yakuza. When Hikaro and his men were attacked at a Cherry Blossom festival by members of the Ku Klux Klan did Hikaro sent him to find who tried to kill him and the Boss learned that Hikaro's own wife was the culprit. Sickened by this senseless conflict he tries to run off with her in an attempt to escape from the criminal underworld only to be dragged down by Hikaro when he tries to kill them both. Then she reveals her past, her family's lands was taken away by Eda and her sister was killed by Hikaro and she was forced to become the bride and assassin of Hikaro. They both work together to take down Eda and eventually have feelings for one another but the heist on Eda's personal assets goes awry when Mikoto goes off to try and kill Eda only to die in the process, in a fit of rage the Boss personally attacks Eda and gets his revenge for Mikoto as he bitterly says that she was the first and last woman he had ever truly loved.

=== Trivia ===
Omerta, the game's title, refers to the infamous [[honor code]] called ''"[[Omertà]]"'', a ''"[[Code of silence]]"'' which binds members of the [[Sicilian Mafia|Mafia]] or similar criminal organizations to professional discretion against any third parties.

Upon the official retail-release of the boxed- and digital distributed version, the game was also simultaneously released on [[GOG.com]] without any [[copy-protection]], nor other [[digital rights management]] restrictions.&lt;ref name="GOG.com"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[GOG.com|GoG.com]] |title='Omerta - City of Gangsters' on ''Good Old Games''|url=http://www.gog.com/gamecard/omerta_city_of_gangsters |date=2013-01-31 |access-date=2013-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gameplay ==
Beginning with small deals, the player gradually expands his criminal career, eventually advancing highly enough to establish his own business. The player can purchase untenanted shops, buildings and structures to establish his own bar, brewery or distillery. The player can also buy out an opposing ''speakeasy''. A more legal way for generating income is buying apartments to obtain leasing. Warehouses can be acquired to extend storage.

As the game progresses, the character can recruit companions, create his own gang, and conquer the territories of rival gangsters. Characters provide specific [[Role-playing game system|role-playing elements]] based on their individual characteristics and equipment. In these [[Turn-based strategy|turn-based]] confrontations, the player expands his influence by using henchmen to drive other godfathers out of business, to ultimately reign supreme as the unchallenged patron of Atlantic City.&lt;ref name="Kalypso-Announce"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://forum.kalypsomedia.com/showthread.php?tid=13774 |title=Guns, Money, Honor - Kalypso Unveils "Omerta – City of {{Sic|nolink=y|Gang|ters|expected=Gangsters}}" |last1=Official forum moderator |first1="Melbourne" |date=6 March 2012 |work=Official forum |publisher=[[Kalypso Media]] |accessdate=14 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to co-operative and competitive multiplayer game-play, the game offers a [[Open-ended (gameplay)#Sandbox mode|sandbox mode]] to freely explore the game world – six district maps covering ''Atlantic City''.

=== Historical background ===
[[File:Traymore1930.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The renowned Traymore Hotel in Atlantic City, circa 1930]]
The game provides an explorable three-dimensional world which is displayed through a [[Video game graphics#Top-down perspective|Top-down perspective]]. The in-game world represents, according to the publisher Kalypso Media,&lt;ref name="Kalypso-AtlanticCity"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://forum.kalypsomedia.com/showthread.php?tid=16677 |title=New Images from "Omerta – City of Gangsters" (Buildings)|last1=Official forum moderator |first1="Melbourne" |date=25 September 2012 |work=Official forum |publisher=[[Kalypso Media]] |accessdate=31 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; an almost accurate and historical correct reproduction of the American city ''Atlantic City'' of this period.

Real vintage buildings and places are present like the [[Traymore Hotel]], the [[Absecon Light]]house, the ''Atlantic City Jail-house'' or the board-walk "Eastern Promenade" as well as streets like ''Illinois Avenue'' or the ''North Carolina Avenue'' which ends at the beach. Beside those real buildings the remaining ones - which are shown in [[Art Deco]] - are very similar to each other and seems to consist only of a few types.

== Licensing of name ==
Kalypso Media licensed the name 'Omerta' from the [[MMORPG]] browser based game of the same name, [[Omerta (video game)|Omerta]].

== Reception ==
[[Metacritic]] aggregated a score of 54 from 100 points for the Windows version.&lt;ref name="Meta-PC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/omerta-city-of-gangsters |title=Omerta: City of Gangsters for PC Reviews, Ratings, Credits, and More - Metacritic |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |authorlink=Metacritic |date=31 January 2013 |publisher=[[Metacritic]] |accessdate=5 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''PCGamer'' gave the PC-version a rating of 78 out of 100 points, praising the game's mechanics as well as the [[Artificial intelligence (video games)|AI]] while comparing its combat style elements to [[X-COM]] or [[Jagged Alliance]]. The story is described as too superficial and simple, just depth-less. The atmospheric music, on the other hand, was lauded as a brilliant melange of the [[Jazz]], [[Ragtime]] and [[Klezmer]] music of the period.

{{Quote|'''"Not as tough or as deep as it could be, Omerta is still a destination well worth a visit."'''|Tim Stone|PCGamer.com&lt;ref name="PCGamer-review"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pcgamer.com/review/omerta-city-of-gangsters-review/ |title=Omerta: City of Gangsters review |last=Stone |first=Tim |date=January 31, 2013 |work=Review |publisher=[[PC Gamer]] |accessdate=February 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Rating the game at just 30 percent, ''Metro GameCentral'' tested the PC-version as well. Initially intrigued by the promise of a new kind of "made-men" game, the turn-based combat system was ultimately deemed ungainly.

{{Quote|'''"You can see the basis of a good game here but Omerta gets almost everything wrong, from the shallow game-play to the bland, characterless gangster atmosphere."'''|Roger Hargreaves|GameCentral&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;Metro.co.uk&lt;ref name="GameCentral-review"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://metro.co.uk/2013/02/04/omerta-city-of-gangsters-review-refuse-the-offer-3379811/ |title=Omerta: City Of Gangsters review – refuse the offer |last=Hargreaves |first=Roger |date=February 4, 2013 |work=Review |publisher=GameCentral&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;Metro.co.uk |accessdate=February 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''Hooked Gamer'' gave the PC-version a rating of 8.4 out of 10. It describes the game as "different", and the turn-based combats as short but satisfying.

{{Quote|'''"What struck me most was the potential. Omerta is a good game but if it succeeds, it has the potential to be a great game.

The '''Phoenix Shot Tower''', also known as the '''Old Baltimore Shot Tower''', is a red brick [[shot tower]], {{convert|234.25|ft|m}} tall, located near the [[downtown Baltimore|downtown]], [[Jonestown, Baltimore|Jonestown]] (also known later as Old Town), and [[Little Italy, Baltimore|Little Italy]] communities of East [[Baltimore]], in [[Maryland]]. When it was completed in 1828 it was the tallest structure in the [[United States]].  

The tower was originally known as the "Phoenix Shot Tower", then the "Merchants' Shot Tower", and now is also sometimes called the "Old Baltimore Shot Tower".&lt;ref name="NPS-b29"/&gt; It is the only surviving shot tower among three that existed in Baltimore,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://msa.maryland.gov/megafile/msa/speccol/sc4300/sc4300/000005/000000/000003/unrestricted/baltimore_county_mills.pdf |title= Baltimore City and County Mills A-C |accessdate= June 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] on November 11, 1971.&lt;ref name="nhlsum"/&gt; It was designated as a local Baltimore City Landmark on October 14, 1975.&lt;ref&gt;Baltimore City Commission on Historical and Architectural Preservation, "Baltimore City’s Designated Landmark List", July 2012. 

https://chap.baltimorecity.gov/sites/default/files/Baltimore%20City%20Landmarks%20publication.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The Shot Tower lends its name to the nearby [[Shot Tower/Market Place (Metro Subway station)|Shot Tower/Market Place station]] on the [[Metro Subway (Baltimore)|Baltimore Metro subway system]]'s northeast line. Additionally, the original [[Baltimore Bullets (1944–54)|Baltimore Bullets]] were named in honor of its role in producing shot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vecsey|first1=George|title=Sports of The Times;Say Goodbye To 'Bullets' As Nickname|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/12/sports/sports-of-the-times-say-goodbye-to-bullets-as-nickname.html|website=The New York Times|accessdate=28 January 2018|date=12 November 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design==
The tower was built by Jacob Wolfe&lt;ref name="JHU-engineer"&gt;[http://www.ce.jhu.edu/baltimorestructures/Shot%20Tower/shot_tower.htm "An Engineer's Guide to Baltimore: Phoenix Shot Tower"], accessed May 6, 2007 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311042830/http://www.ce.jhu.edu/baltimorestructures/Shot+Tower/shot_tower.htm |date=March 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; using bricks manufactured by the Burns and Russell Company of Baltimore.  [[Charles Carroll of Carrollton]], the last surviving signer of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], a Roman Catholic lay leader and wealthiest man in America at that time, laid its cornerstone.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/baltimore/b29.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The circular brick structure's walls are {{convert|4.5|ft|m}} thick from the bottom to about {{convert|50|ft|m}} up; then they narrow in stages of {{convert|4|in|cm}} each, until reaching a thickness of {{convert|21|in|cm}} at the top.&lt;ref name="JHU-engineer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nrhpinv1"&gt;{{cite web|url={{NHLS url|id=69000373}}|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory Nomination: Baltimore Shot Tower|last=Morton|first=W. Brown III|date=July 30, 1971|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=2009-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
{{details|topic=this process|Shot tower}}
Molten [[lead]] was dropped from a platform at the top of the tower, through a sieve-like device, into a vat of cold water at the bottom of the tower&lt;ref name="NPS-b29"&gt;[http://www.cr.nps.gov/nr/travel/baltimore/b29.htm "Shot Tower"], National Park Service, accessed May 6, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; to produce both "drop shot" for pistols and rifles and "moulded shot" for larger weapons such as cannons.&lt;ref name="NPS-baltoshot"&gt;[http://www.cr.nps.gov/hps/pad/adventure/baltoshot.htm "Baltimore (Phoenix) Shot Tower"], National Park Service, accessed May 6, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; When hardened, dried, and polished, the shot was sorted into 25-pound bags. The annual production was about 100,000 bags of shot a year,&lt;ref name="NPS-SS"&gt;[http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=878&amp;ResourceType=Structure Statement of Significance] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090309084709/http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=878&amp;ResourceType=Structure |date=2009-03-09 }} at the [[National Park Service]]'s [[National Historic Landmark|National Historic Landmark Program]] website, accessed May 6, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; with the capability of doubling that in case of war or other high demand.&lt;ref name="NPS-b29"/&gt;

The tower stopped producing shot in 1892,&lt;ref name="JHU-engineer"/&gt; when a new method of making shot made the tower obsolete.  It re-opened for a brief period of production at the beginning of the twentieth century, and then closed for good.&lt;ref name="CM"&gt;[http://www.carrollmuseums.org/pages/3/index.htm Phoenix Shot Tower''], Carroll Museums, accessed May 6, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The tower remained the [[List of tallest buildings in the United States|tallest structure in the United States]] until 1846, when [[Trinity Church, New York]] on [[Wall Street]] was erected, and the [[List of tallest buildings in Baltimore|tallest in Baltimore]] until the completion of the spire of the [[First Presbyterian Church and Manse (Baltimore, Maryland)|First Presbyterian Church]] at West Madison Street and Park Avenue in the [[Mount Vernon, Baltimore|Mount Vernon-Belvedere]] neighborhood in 1875.
[[File:Behind the Scenes Tour of the Phoenix Shot Tower (6280561056).jpg|thumb|left|Interior of the tower, looking down]]

The shot tower was originally owned by the Merchants' Shot Tower Company which closed in 1898.&lt;ref name="NPS-baltoshot"/&gt;

In 1921 the tower was purchased for $14,500 by the [[Union Oil Company]], which planned to tear it down and put a [[filling station|gas station]] in its place.  After strong objections by the community, by 1928 enough money had been raised to purchase the tower and present it to the City of Baltimore as one of its first preserved local historic landmarks.&lt;ref name="JHU-engineer"/&gt;
[[File:Phoenix Shot Tower 04.jpg|thumb|Plaques at the Phoenix Shot Tower, formerly the Merchants Shot Tower, in Baltimore's Jonestown neighborhood]]
The tower was designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1971 and a bronze plaque was attached to the tower's brick wall at the base.  In the early 1980s, the management, exhibits, and tours were combined with those of the former [[Peale Museum]].  In 1985, other historic sites and homes were added to the newly created Baltimore City Life Museums system.  The BCLM was closed in 1997, and in 2002 Carroll Museums, Inc was created to manage both the [[Carroll Mansion]] and the Shot Tower.&lt;ref name=CM /&gt;

A '''public-sector trade union''' (or '''public-sector labor union''') is a [[trade union]] which primarily represents the interests of employees within [[public sector]] or governmental organizations.

==History and recent developments==

===Costa Rica===
{{Main|Trade unions in Costa Rica}}

In the late 1800s, trade unions first appeared to support workers in a variety of urban and industrial jobs.&lt;ref name=SITRAPEQUIA&gt;{{cite web|title=Historia del Sindicalismo|url=http://sitrapequia.or.cr/gestor/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=52|work=SITRAPEQUIA website|publisher=Sindicato de Trabajadores(as) Petroléros Químicos y Afines|accessdate=4 May 2014|location=San José|language=es|year=2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140505020834/http://sitrapequia.or.cr/gestor/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=52|archivedate=5 May 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After facing violent repression, such as during the 1934 United Fruit Strike, unions gained more power following the 1948 [[Costa Rican Civil War]], and public sector unions appeared.&lt;ref name=SITRAPEQUIA /&gt; Previous administrations and assesmblies paid very little attention to Costa Rica's trade unions;,&lt;ref name="gana voces"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sequeira|first1=Aarón|title=Sindicalismo gana voces en el Congreso e impulsa su agenda|url=http://www.nacion.com/nacional/politica/Sindicalismo-voces-Congreso-impulsa-agenda_0_1418258197.html|accessdate=2 June 2014|publisher=La Nacion|date=2 June 2014|location=San Jose|language=Es}}&lt;/ref&gt; however when the [[Luis Guillermo Solís]] and the 2014 legislative assembly took office, Solís and eight members of the [[Citizens' Action Party (Costa Rica)|Citizens' Action Party]] and [[Broad Front (Costa Rica)|Broad Front]] promised to listen to unions. Libertarian [[Otto Guevara]] expressed concern.&lt;ref name="gana voces" /&gt; Today, Costa Rican unions are strongest in the public sector, including the fields of education and medicine.&lt;ref name=SITRAPEQUIA /&gt; There is also a strong presence in agricultural sectors for unions.&lt;ref name=SITRAPEQUIA /&gt; In general, Costa Rican unions support government regulation of the banking, medical, and education fields, as well as improved wages and working conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Herrera|first=Manuel|title=Sindicatos alzarán la voz contra modelo neoliberal en celebraciones del 1° de mayo|url=http://www.nacion.com/nacional/trabajo/Sindicatos-alzaran-modelo-neoliberal-celebraciones_0_1411658998.html|accessdate=7 May 2014|newspaper=La Nacion|date=30 April 2014|location=San Jose|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One important issue for public sector unions is passage of the Código Procesal Laboral (Procedural Labor Law), which former president [[Laura Chinchilla]] vetoed.&lt;ref name=cambios&gt;{{cite news|last=Sequeira|first=Aarón|title=Presidente del Congreso se reúne con sindicatos y promete cambios al Código de Trabajo|url=http://www.nacion.com/nacional/politica/Presidente-Congreso-sindicatos-Codigo-Trabajo_0_1412058926.html|accessdate=5 May 2014|newspaper=La Nacion|date=2 May 2014|location=San Jose|language=Es}}&lt;/ref&gt; If passed, Chinchilla said it would allow emergency service workers, such as police, medical service staff and doctors to strike. President [[Luis Guillermo Solís]] said that the issue of the Procedural Labor Law should be finalized within his first year in office.&lt;ref name=avala&gt;{{cite news|last=Oveido|first=Estaban|title=Luis Guillermo Solís avala plazo de un año para resolver veto a reforma laboral|url=http://www.nacion.com/nacional/politica/Luis-Guillermo-Solis-resolver-reforma_0_1412858729.html|accessdate=6 May 2014|newspaper=La Nacion|date=6 May 2014|location=San Jose|language=Es}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Legislative Assembly of Costa Rica|Legislative Assembly]] president [[Henry Mora Jiménez]], also supported the law, as do the public sector unions.&lt;ref name=cambios /&gt;

===Europe===
There are public-sector trade unions in Europe that negotiate agreements between public employees and the institutions for which they work. In 2010, severe financial crises forced several governments to cut back on wages and benefits in austerity measures, leading to protests, most notably in Greece. In Greece, a one-day protest was held because of requirements placed by the EU on Greece's public spending.&lt;ref&gt;See "Greece hit by nationwide strike over austerity" [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8507551.stm BBC News 10 February 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
{{main|Public-sector trade unions in the United States}}
Labor unions generally bypassed government employees because they were controlled mostly by the patronage system used by the political parties before the arrival of civil service. 
Post Office workers did form unions. The [[National Association of Letter Carriers]] started in 1889 and grew quickly. By the mid-1960s it had 175,000 members in 6,400 local branches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Morris S. Ogul|title=Congress Oversees the Bureaucracy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MxHpmVLxj1kC&amp;pg=PA65|date=15 May 1976|publisher=U. of Pittsburgh Press|page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several competing organizations of postal clerks emerged starting in the 1890s. Merger discussions dragged on for years, until finally the NFPOC, UNMAPOC and others merged in 1961 as the United Federation of Postal Clerks.  Another round of mergers in 1971 produced the [[American Postal Workers Union]] (APWU).  In 2012 the APWU had 330,000 members.&lt;ref&gt;Gary M Fink, ed., ''Labor Unions'' (1977)  pp 291-94&lt;/ref&gt;  The various postal unions did not engage in strikes.

{{main|Boston Police Strike}}
Historian Joseph Slater, says, "Unfortunately for public sector unions, the most searing and enduring image of their history in the first half of the twentieth century was the Boston police strike. The strike was routinely cited by courts and officials through the end of the 1940s."&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Slater, "The Boston Police Strike'' in Aaron Brenner et al. eds. ''The Encyclopedia of Strikes in American History'' (2011) [https://books.google.com/books?id=EHzk54IjNpEC&amp;pg=PA241]&lt;/ref&gt;  Governor [[Calvin Coolidge]] broke the strike and the legislature took control of the police away from city officials.&lt;ref&gt;Francis Russell, ''A city in terror: Calvin Coolidge and the 1919 Boston police strike'' (Beacon Press, 1975)&lt;/ref&gt;

The police strike chilled union interest in the public sector in the 1920s. The major exception was the emergence of unions of public school teachers in the largest cities; they formed the [[American Federation of Teachers]] (AFT), affiliated with the AFL.  In suburbs and small cities, the [[National Education Association]] (NEA) became active, but it insisted it was not a labor union but a professional organization.&lt;ref&gt;Marjorie Murphy, ''Blackboard Unions: The AFT and the NEA, 1900-1980'' (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

====New Deal era====

In the mid 1930s efforts were made to unionize  WPA workers, but were opposed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt.&lt;ref&gt;Chad Alan Goldberg, "Contesting the Status of Relief Workers during the New Deal The Workers Alliance of America and the Works Progress Administration, 1935-1941." ''Social Science History'' (2005) 29#3 pp: 337-371.&lt;/ref&gt;  Moe points out that Roosevelt, "an ardent supporter of collective bargaining in the private sector, was opposed to it in the public sector."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Moe|title=Special Interest: Teachers Unions and America's Public Schools|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lDFz6oYRtuIC&amp;pg=PA33|year=2011|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Roosevelt in 1937 told the nation what the position of his government was: "All Government employees should realize that the process of collective bargaining, as usually understood, cannot be transplanted into the public service.... The very nature and purposes of government make it impossible for administrative officials to represent fully or to bind the employer in mutual discussions with government employee organizations.&lt;ref&gt;see [http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=15445#axzz1Jy35UQb9 "Letter on the Resolution of Federation of Federal Employees Against Strikes in Federal Service August 16, 1937"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===="Little New Deal" era====
Change came in the 1950s. In 1958 New York mayor [[Robert Wagner, Jr.]] issued an executive order, called  "the little Wagner Act," giving city employees certain bargaining rights, and gave their unions with exclusive representation (that is, the unions alone were legally authorized to speak for all city workers, regardless of whether or not some workers were members.)  Management complained but the unions had power in city politics.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony C. Russo, "Management's View of the New York City Experience," ''Proceedings of the Academy of Political Science'' Vol. 30, No. 2, "Unionization of Municipal Employees" (Dec., 1970), pp. 81-93 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1173366 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1960s and 1970s public-sector unions expanded rapidly to cover teachers, clerks, firemen, police, prison guards and others. In 1962, President [[John Kennedy]] issued [[Executive Order 10988]], upgrading the status of unions of federal workers.&lt;ref&gt;David Schultz, ''Encyclopedia of public administration and public policy'' (2004) p. 143&lt;/ref&gt;

====Recent years====
After 1960 public sector unions grew rapidly and secured good wages and high pensions for their members. While manufacturing and farming steadily declined, state- and local-government employment quadrupled from 4 million workers in 1950 to 12 million in 1976 and 16.6 million in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Census Bureau,  [https://www.census.gov/newsroom/releases/archives/governments/cb10-132.html "Census Bureau Reports State and Local Government Employment Remains at 16.6 Million" (press release Aug. 10, 2010)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 the U.S. membership of public sector unions surpassed membership of private sector unions for the first time, at 7.9m and 7.4m respectively.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nationalaffairs.com/publications/detail/the-trouble-with-public-sector-unions&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 states faced a growing fiscal crisis and the Republicans had made major gains in the 2010 elections. Public sector unions came under heavy attack [[2011 Wisconsin budget protests|especially in Wisconsin]], as well as Indiana, New Jersey and Ohio from conservative Republican legislatures.&lt;ref&gt;John Logan, "Is this the end for organised labour in the US?," [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/mar/11/us-unions-wisconsin guardian.co.uk, March 11, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;see [https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2011/02/18/the-first-blow-against-public-employees "Public employees"]&lt;/ref&gt; 2012 update.&lt;ref&gt;see [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/politics/state-budget-crisis/index.html "Budget crisis"]&lt;/ref&gt; Conservative state legislatures tried to drastically reduce the abilities of unions to collectively bargain.  Conservatives argued that public unions were too powerful since they helped elect their bosses, and that overly generous pension systems were too heavy a drain on state budgets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Theda Skocpol|author2=Vanessa Williamson|title=The Tea Party and the Remaking of Republican Conservatism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gm56Pg3um2IC&amp;pg=PA192|year=2012|publisher=Oxford UP|page=192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Public Patent Foundation''', or '''PUBPAT''', is a [[non-profit organization]] that seeks to limit perceived abuse of the [[United States patent law|United States patent system]].  It was founded in 2003 by [[Dan Ravicher]].  {{As of|2004}}, there was growing concern by many technology professionals over the number of [[patent]]s granted that are either too trivial to deserve protection, or duplicate existing or expired patents. It usually works by petitioning the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] to review patents that are suspected of being invalid somehow or another, usually by [[prior art]].

The '''''Puget Sound Business Journal''''' ('''PSBJ''') is a weekly [[American City Business Journals]] publication containing articles about [[business]] people, issues, and events in the greater [[Seattle, Washington]] area. The publication also publishes a technology news website named TechFlash.

In 2010, the newspaper was a finalist for a [[Pulitzer Prize]] in Explanatory Reporting for a series of stories about the foreclosure crises and the federal shutdown of Seattle-based [[Washington Mutual]], which remains the biggest bank failure in U.S. history. The stories were reported by staff writers [[Kirsten Grind]] and Jeanne Lang Jones, and edited by Managing Editor [[Alwyn Scott]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Anderson |first=Rick |date=April 13, 2010 |title=Biz Journal: A Pulitzer in Effort, at Least |url=http://archive.seattleweekly.com/home/937562-129/media |work=[[Seattle Weekly]] |accessdate=September 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Congressman [[Dave Reichert]] later honored the PSBJ alongside Pulitzer winners ''[[The Seattle Times]]'' during his remarks, praising the former's "inclusive and thorough" reporting as an "invaluable public service".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Reichert |first=David |authorlink=Dave Reichert |date=April 21, 2010 |title=Honoring The Seattle Times and the Puget Sound Business Journal |url=https://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/4/21/extensions-of-remarks-section/article/E600-5 |work=[[Congressional Record]] |accessdate=September 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family and early life==
Frelinghuysen was born in New York City to [[Peter Frelinghuysen Jr.]], a New Jersey politician and Beatrice Sterling Procter, an heir to the [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] fortune.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/24/nyregion/peter-frelinghuysen-jr-95-longtime-nj-congressman-dies.html|title=Peter Frelinghuysen Jr., 95, Longtime N.J.

Frelinghuysen is a member of a [[Frelinghuysen family|family long prominent]] in [[New Jersey]] politics, one which was ranked the seventh greatest  [[List of United States political families|American political dynasty]] by [[Stephen H. Hess]], senior fellow emeritus at the [[Brookings Institution]], and author of "America's Political Dynasties".&lt;ref name="Hess"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/09/11/AR2009091101831.html |title=America's Top Dynasty?|last=Hess|first=Stephen|date=September 13, 2009 |accessdate=January 29, 2018 |newspaper=The Washington Post. ''washingtonpost.com''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His father, [[Peter Frelinghuysen Jr.]], served as the U.S. Representative from [[New Jersey's 5th congressional district]] from 1953–75, representing much of the same area Rodney does today. He is the great-great-grandson of [[Frederick Theodore Frelinghuysen]], who was a U.S. Senator for New Jersey and [[United States Secretary of State|U.S. Secretary of State]] in the administration of President [[Chester A. Arthur]]. His great-great-great-uncle, the adoptive father of Frederick Theodore, [[Theodore Frelinghuysen]] was a U.S. Senator for New Jersey, served as president of both [[New York University]] and [[Rutgers University|Rutgers College]], and was the [[Vice President of the United States|vice-presidential]] running mate of [[Henry Clay]] on the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] ticket in the [[United States presidential election, 1844|presidential election of 1844]]. Frelinghuysen's great-great-great-great-grandfather [[Frederick Frelinghuysen (general)|Frederick Frelinghuysen]] was one of the framers of the first [[Constitution of New Jersey]], a U.S. Senator for New Jersey, and a soldier in the [[American Revolutionary War]].&lt;ref name="freepages"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~battle/reps/frelinghuysen.htm|title=frelinghuysen|website=Freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com|accessdate=February 22, 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313024936/http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~battle/reps/frelinghuysen.htm|archivedate=March 13, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from the Frelinghuysen name, he is a great-great-great-grandson of [[Peter Ballantine]], founder of [[Ballantine Brewery]] in Newark. On his mother's side, he is a great-great-grandson of [[William Procter (candlemaker)|William Procter]], co-founder of [[Procter &amp; Gamble]].&lt;ref name="freepages"/&gt;{{dead link|date=January 2018}}

He attended [[St. Mark's School (Massachusetts)|St. Mark's School]], an exclusive Episcopal preparatory school in [[Southborough, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pearce|first1=Jeremy|title=War And Politesse|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/20/nyregion/war-and-politesse.html|accessdate=4 February 2018|publisher=NY Times|date=April 20, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rejected by [[Princeton University|Princeton]],&lt;ref name=Golden&gt;{{cite book|last=Golden|first=Daniel|title=The Price of Admission: How America's Ruling Class Buys Its Way into Elite Colleges – and Who Gets Left Outside the Gates|year=2009|publisher=Random House LLC|isbn=0307497372|page=226|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o4Xm2vDh_wcC&amp;dq=ruling+class+hobart+college&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt; the alma mater of his father and grandfather, Frelinghuysen instead matriculated at [[Hobart and William Smith Colleges|Hobart College]] in New York.

Frelinghuysen next enrolled in a graduate program at [[Trinity College, Hartford|Trinity College]] but was soon drafted into the [[United States Army]]. Following basic training at [[Fort Dix, New Jersey|Fort Dix]], he was assigned as a clerk to the commanding officer of the 93rd Engineer Battalion, which was primarily responsible for building roads and water supply systems in the [[Mekong Delta]] of [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]].&lt;ref name="HWS profile"/&gt;&lt;ref name=abanow&gt;{{cite web|title=Congressman and His Army Commander Reunite During ABA Day After 42 Years|url=http://www.abanow.org/2013/04/congressman-and-his-army-commander-reunite-during-aba-day-after-42-years|publisher=abanow.org|accessdate=August 9, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523045706/http://www.abanow.org/2013/04/congressman-and-his-army-commander-reunite-during-aba-day-after-42-years/|archivedate=May 23, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Local and state political career==
After his military service, Frelinghuysen was hired by then-[[Morris County, New Jersey|Morris County]] [[Board of Chosen Freeholders|Freeholder]] Director [[Dean A. Gallo]] to be the county's state and federal aid coordinator and administrative assistant.&lt;ref name=WapoElections2004&gt;{{cite web|title=Rodney P.

He served three terms on the board, the last as its director.&lt;ref name=GOP.gov&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gop.gov/republicans/rodneyfrelinghuysen/bio|title=Rodney Frelinghuysen: Biography|publisher=GOP.gov|accessdate=August 29, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111062143/http://www.gop.gov/republicans/rodneyfrelinghuysen/bio|archivedate=November 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, Frelinghuysen was elected to the [[New Jersey General Assembly]], representing the [[New Jersey Legislative Districts, 2001 redistricting#District 25|25th legislative district]]. Frelinghuysen served in the Assembly until 1994. He was Chairman of the Assembly Appropriations Committee during the 1988–89 legislative session.&lt;ref name=GOP.gov/&gt; In 1990 he ran in the Republican primary for New Jersey's 12th congressional district against [[Dick Zimmer (New Jersey politician)|Dick Zimmer]] and [[Phil McConkey]].

During the race, the Frelinghuysen campaign "broke ground in high-tech politicking" when it sent voters a seven-minute video cassette of Frelinghuysen. The video, which contained photographs of Frelinghuysen in Vietnam and praise from former Gov. [[Thomas Kean|Tom Kean]], served as a preemptive tactic against opponents' attempts to characterize Frelinghuysen as "an irrelevant debutante".&lt;ref name=Polman&gt;{{cite web|last=Polman|first=Dick|title=Lights, Camera, Political Action: Campaigning In The Video Age|url=http://articles.philly.com/1990-04-26/news/25917767_1_political-video-congressional-candidates-video-age|newspaper=Philadelphia Inquirer|accessdate=August 9, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116072742/http://articles.philly.com/1990-04-26/news/25917767_1_political-video-congressional-candidates-video-age|archivedate=January 16, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frelinghuysen finished in third place.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
===Elections===
In late August 1994, U.S. Congressman [[Dean Gallo]], the six-term Republican incumbent of [[New Jersey's 11th congressional district|New Jersey's Eleventh Congressional District]], announced his intention to withdraw from the upcoming election for medical reasons (he had recently been diagnosed with terminal [[prostate cancer]] and died two days before the election). As Gallo had already defeated three opponents in a hard-fought primary the previous June, his withdrawal triggered a convention of Republican committee members from the district's municipalities. Frelinghuysen, who had been Gallo's former employee and fellow Morris County freeholder and state assemblyman, sought the committee's nomination at Gallo's request, and was chosen to be the Republican nominee for the district.&lt;ref name=NYT-GalloDropsOut&gt;{{cite news|last=Sullivan|first=Joseph|title=Rep.

Frelinghuysen went on to defeat former Democratic State Senator [[Frank Herbert (politician)|Frank Herbert]] 71% to 28% in the November 1994 election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=28952|title=NJ District 11 Race|date=November 8, 1994|publisher=Our Campaigns|accessdate=February 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the 11th had long been one of the most Republican districts in the Northeast, and Frelinghuysen had effectively clinched a seat in Congress by winning the Republican nomination. He was reelected nine times with no substantive opposition, never dropping below 59% of the vote. He has been challenged in the Republican primary three times: in 2008, 2010, and 2014. In 2008, he defeated Kate Erber in the June primary 87% to 13%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=351543|title=NJ District 11 - R Primary Race|date=June 3, 2008|publisher=Our Campaigns|accessdate=February 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, he defeated Richard Luzzi 76% to 24%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=643636|title=NJ District 11 - R Primary Race|date=June 8, 2010|publisher=Ourcampaigns.com|accessdate=February 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, he defeated Rick Van Glahn 67% to 33%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=800857|title=NJ District 11 - R Primary Race|date=June 3, 2014|publisher=Our Campaigns|accessdate=February 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 29, 2018 Frelinghuysen announced that he wouldn't run for another term in 2018.&lt;ref name="retirement" /&gt;

In 2000, progressive activist filmmaker [[Michael Moore]] attempted to have a [[ficus]] challenge Frelinghuysen's unopposed re-election to make the point that most Members of Congress "run unopposed in their primaries and 95% are re-elected every time in the general election", adding "we think it's time to point out to the Frelinghuysen family that we live in a democracy, not a dynasty."&lt;ref name="moore"&gt;{{cite web|last=Moore |first=Michael |date=April 26, 2000 |url=http://www.commondreams.org/news2000/0426-09.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080119080414/http://www.commondreams.org/news2000/0426-09.htm|title=Ficus Plant Announces Candidacy For Congress |type=press release |work=[[Common Dreams]]: Progressive Newswire.

As Frelinghuysen is less conservative than many members of the Republican caucus, he was elevated to the Appropriations Committee chairship only based on his assurance to the conservatives that he would be willing to set aside his personal views to implement party policy. One conservative on the committee, Representative [[Robert Aderholt]], said, "One of the things we had discussed going into this, when he wanted to take the chairmanship, was that at the end of the day he understood that when he was negotiating these bills he'd be negotiating on behalf of his conference, as opposed to his own philosophy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.northjersey.com/story/news/new-jersey/2017/04/06/report-gop-heat-frelinghuysen-over-health-insurance-opposition/100122902|title=Report: GOP heat on Frelinghuysen over health bill|last=Jackson|first=Herb|website=NorthJersey.com|publisher=[[North Jersey Media Group]]|accessdate=April 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a tele-townhall on March 20, 2017, he stated that was "not sold" on attempts to repeal and replace the [[Affordable Care Act]] (also known as [[Obamacare]]) and had not seen any evidence to support claims that President Trump was wiretapped during the campaign. He believes Trump should release his tax returns, but does not support attempts to compel their release, adding "I need to support the Chair's ruling regardless of what the issue is."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://morristowngreen.com/2017/03/20/rodney-frelinghuysen-not-sold-on-healthcare-bill-supports-nih-public-radio-trump-tweets-out-of-control|title=Rodney Frelinghuysen 'not sold' on healthcare bill, supports NIH, public radio; Trump tweets 'out of control'|last=Coughlin|first=Kevin|accessdate=March 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abortion===
Frelinghuysen is a member of [[Republican Majority For Choice]] and [[Republicans for Choice]]. In 2017, he voted against the [[Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act]], which would have implemented a national ban on abortions performed after 20 weeks of gestation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kilgore|first1=Ed|title=House Passes 20-Week Abortion Ban on Near-Perfect Party-Line Vote|url=http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/10/house-passes-20-week-abortion-ban-on-party-vote.html|accessdate=January 11, 2018|publisher=New York Magazine|date=October 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2010-12, his NARAL rating averaged 7%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://votesmart.org/candidate/key-votes/22177/rodney-frelinghuysen#.WlgDF7j6jIY|title=The Voter's Self Defense System|website=Vote Smart}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=January 2018}} He and fellow [[New Jersey]] Republican [[Leonard Lance]] were singled out by [[NARAL]] President [[Nancy Keenan]] over their support of H.R. 3 "No Taxpayer Funding for Abortions Act". Frelinghuysen voted in 2015 to strip all federal funding from [[Planned Parenthood]], despite having opposed similar measures in 2011, 2009 and 2007. He cited the [[Planned Parenthood 2015 undercover videos controversy]] for his change in position.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

===Economy and budget===
In October 2017, Frelinghuysen was the only representative from New Jersey to vote in favor of a Republican budget resolution&amp;nbsp;that would increase the federal deficit by $1.5 trillion. He said he voted "for the budget resolution to get my appropriations bills done" and that he would "evaluate tax reform when I see the details."&lt;ref name="More at risk"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2017/10/your_property_tax_break_just_became_more_endangere.html|title=You're now more at risk of losing your property tax break|work=NJ.com|access-date=2017-10-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2017, Frelinghuysen voted against the [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017]].&lt;ref name="Almukhtar122117"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Almukhtar|first1=Sarah|title=How Each House Member Voted on the Tax Bill|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/12/19/us/politics/tax-bill-house-live-vote.html?_r=0|website=The New York Times|accessdate=December 21, 2017|date=December 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frelinghuysen is a supporter of [[Earmark (politics)|earmarking]], calling the practice a "constitutional responsibility."&lt;ref name="WaPo"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/rodney-frelinghuysen-r-nj/gIQAFP2pAP_topic.html|title=Who Runs Gov: Rodney Frelinghuysen (R-NJ) U.S. Representative (since January 1995)|date=December 22, 2011|accessdate=August 9, 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=January 2018}} He consistently ranks in the top 5% in terms of dollars procured. In fiscal year 2008 he ranked 21st, sponsoring or co-sponsoring 44 earmarks totaling $88 million; in fiscal year 2009 he ranked 12th, with 45 earmarks totaling $119 million; and in fiscal year 2010 he ranked 21st with 39 earmarks totaling $76 million. During the same period, Frelinghuysen was the top earmarker among New Jersey lawmakers. The majority of his earmarks were for defense-related expenses.&lt;ref name="OpenSecretsEarmarks"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/earmarks.php?fy=FY10&amp;cid=N00000684&amp;cycle=2010|title=Rodney Frelinghuysen: Earmarks (Fiscal Year 2010)|publisher=The Center for Responsive Politics|accessdate=August 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environment===
[[File:Rodney Frelinghuysen lifetime LCV scores.jpg|thumb|Annual [[League of Conservation Voters|LCV]] ratings for Rodney Frelinghuysen]] 
Frelinghuysen's environmental position, as measured by the [[League of Conservation Voters]] annual "Environmental National Scorecard", was largely centrist from 1995 to 2008, averaging 55%. Beginning in 2009, his environmental record veered sharply negative, averaging just 14% over the next nine years, through 2017. In 2017 Frelinghuysen was given a rating of 9%, the lowest of any New Jersey congressional representative. As of 2017, Frelinghuysen's lifetime LCV Scorecard score was 33%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scorecard.lcv.org/moc/rodney-p-frelinghuysen |title=Representative Rodney Frelinghuysen |work=National Environmental Scorecard |publisher=[[League of Conservation Voters]] |accessdate=March 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rodney Frelinghuysen.jpg|thumb|left|Frelinghuysen tours a [[Superfund]] site in his district]]

In May, 2003, Frelinghuysen introduced H.R. 1964, the [[Highlands Conservation Act]], a bill that recognized "the importance of the water, forest, agricultural, wildlife, recreational, and cultural resources of the [[New York–New Jersey Highlands|Highlands region]], and the national significance of the Highlands region to the United States", and authorized up to $10 million a year in federal matching funds for land preservation and protection in the Highlands states (Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, and Connecticut), as well as $1 million a year for [[United States Forest Service]] research and technical assistance programs. In November, 2004, [[George W. Bush]] signed the Highlands Conservation Act into law. In 2014, Congress failed to re-authorize the Act and the program expired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/108/hr1964|title=H.R. 1964 (108th): Highlands Conservation Act|publisher=Civic Impulse, LLC|accessdate=March 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of May, 2014 Frelinghuysen was one of eight Republican members of Congress who "accept the prevailing scientific conclusion that global warming is both real and man-made," according to [[PolitiFact]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jerry Brown says 'virtually no Republican' in Washington accepts climate change science|first=Julie|last=Kliegman|date=May 18, 2014|accessdate=September 28, 2017|work=[[PolitiFact]]|publisher=''[[Tampa Bay Times]]''|url=http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/may/18/jerry-brown/jerry-brown-says-virtually-no-republican-believes-}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he opposes federal regulation of greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;ref name="VoteSmart"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://votesmart.org/candidate/political-courage-test/22177/rodney-frelinghuysen/#.WLijFxKLSfQ|title=The Voter's Self Defense System|website=Project Vote Smart|accessdate=March 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sunlight Foundation]] pointed out that among the 435 members of the U.S. House of Representatives, Frelinghuysen has the third-highest amount of investment in [[Petroleum industry|oil]] stocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sunlightfoundation.com/2008/08/08/oil-industry-influence-personal-finances/|title=The Sunlight Foundation Blog – Oil Industry Influence: Personal Finances'|publisher=Sunlight Foundation|accessdate=August 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health care===
He favors repealing the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] (Obamacare), and voted in support of the budget resolution to repeal Obamacare in January 2017.&lt;ref name="VoteSmart"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bycoffe"/&gt; In March 2017, when the Republican leadership was seeking support for the "repeal-and-replace" bill, the [[American Health Care Act of 2017|American Health Care Act]] (AHCA), he announced that he would oppose it on the grounds that it "would place significant new costs and barriers to care on my constituents in New Jersey" and would result in a "loss of [[Medicaid]] coverage for so many people in my Medicaid-dependent state."&lt;ref name="salant"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2017/05/frelinghuysen.html|title=N.J.'s Frelinghuysen changes stance and votes to repeal Obamacare|last=Salant|first=Jonathan D.|date=May 4, 2017|website=nj.com|publisher=[[Advance Digital]]|accessdate=May 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 4, 2017, he voted for a revised version of the AHCA,&lt;ref name="How the House voted"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/ahca-house-vote|title=How the House voted to pass the GOP health-care bill|website=Washington Post|accessdate=May 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/04/politics/house-health-care-vote/index.html|title=How every member voted on health care bill|website=CNN|accessdate=May 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the provisions he had previously cited as objectionable were unchanged.&lt;ref name="salant"/&gt; He said that he "voted for an improved health care act".&lt;ref name="Telephone"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nj.com/morris/index.ssf/2017/05/frelinghuysen_in_latest_telephone_town_hall_defend.html|title=Frelinghuysen defends Obamacare repeal vote in telephone town hall|work=NJ.com|accessdate=May 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frelinghuysen stressed the need to "protect those with pre-existing conditions", but according to NJ.com, the bill "would allow for exemptions from rules preventing those with pre-existing conditions from being charged more for their insurance. It also would allow states to request waivers from federal requirements that all insurers cover specific benefits such as hospitalization, mental health treatment and maternity care."&lt;ref name="Telephone"/&gt; Asked why he voted for the bill without waiting for an estimate from the Congressional Budget Office on its impact, Frelinghuysen said, "I think there was a feeling that we needed to act and get the bill to the Senate so we can get them to act on it."&lt;ref name="Telephone"/&gt;

===Immigration===
Frelinghuysen opposes [[Sanctuary city|sanctuary cities]].&lt;ref name="Telephone"/&gt;

As Chairman of the [[House Appropriations Committee]], he was part of the 29 representatives voting to send the 2018 Homeland Security appropriations bill to the full House. Among other funding, the bill includes $5 billion in funding for Trump's border wall. Referring to the bill, Frelinghuysen stated the bill "provides the necessary funding for critical technology and physical barriers to secure our borders".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Elis |first1=Niv |title=House panel advances homeland security bill with $5 billion in border wall funding |url=http://thehill.com/homenews/house/398881-house-panel-advances-homeland-security-bill-with-5-billion-in-border-wall |website=The Hill |accessdate=29 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Donald Trump===
Frelinghuysen endorsed Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election.&lt;ref name=twsNJcom101/&gt;

===Other issues===
Frelinghuysen is in favor of [[Federal Reserve Transparency Act|auditing the Federal Reserve]],&lt;ref name="On the Issues"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/NJ/Rodney_Frelinghuysen.htm|title=Rodney Frelinghuysen on the Issues|last=OnTheIssues.org|website=www.ontheissues.org|access-date=March 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and supported the Iraq War.&lt;ref name="On the Issues"/&gt; He opposes same-sex marriage,&lt;ref name="VoteSmart"/&gt; and has voted against legislation which would establish [[net neutrality]], which refers to the [[principle]] that [[Internet service provider]]s cannot discriminate by user, content, website, or platform, and has voted in favor of legislation that would [[Voter ID laws in the United States|require photo IDs]] for voting in federal elections.&lt;ref name="On the Issues"/&gt;

He has a "D" rating from [[NORML]] regarding his voting record on [[cannabis]]-related matters. He twice voted against providing veterans access to [[medical marijuana]] via their Veterans Health Administration doctor's recommendation.&lt;ref name="NORML"&gt;{{cite web|title=New Jersey Scorecard - NORML.org - Working to Reform Marijuana Laws|url=http://norml.org/congressional-scorecard/new-jersey|website=norml.org|accessdate=December 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He blocked a vote on an amendment that would have given banks the ability to lend to legal, state-regulated marijuana businesses without having to worry about subsequent punishment by federal financial regulators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomangell/2018/06/13/marijuana-banking-measure-rejected-by-congressional-committee/#1afed24e4208|title=Marijuana Banking Measure Rejected By Congressional Committee|last=Angell|first=Tom|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-06-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Town halls and criticism of activist==
Frelinghuysen, who has not appeared at a public town hall since 2013, prefers small events at schools, community groups, and veteran organizations, according to ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref name=twsNYTimes898/&gt; Since the 2016 election, a grassroots activist group called NJ 11th for Change has organized demonstrations and town halls in an effort to get a face-to-face between Frelinghuysen and his constituents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/why-republicans-should-be-scared-of-town-hall-protests|title=Why Republicans Should Be Scared of Town Hall Protests|website=Vice|accessdate=February 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.njherald.com/20170219/11th-district-protesters-want-face-to-face-with-frelinghuysen|title=11th District protesters want face-to-face with Frelinghuysen|newspaper=New Jersey Herald|accessdate=February 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Frelinghuysen wrote a campaign fundraising letter to a board member of a local bank. While Frelinghuysen did not name NJ 11th for Change, a progressive lobbying group, he included a handwritten postscript warning "One of the ringleaders works in your bank!", with an attached news article about one of NJ 11th for Change's members. The individual subsequently resigned from her position as assistant general counsel and senior vice president at that bank, citing pressure over her political involvement as one of the reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Frelinghuysen Targets Activist in Letter to Her Employer|url=http://www.wnyc.org/story/frelinghuysen-targets-activsts-letter-boss|accessdate=May 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a lawyer and former staffer for the [[Office of Congressional Ethics]], to be unlawful such a letter would need to threaten action or be written on congressional stationery, not campaign letterhead, and/or the bank would have to have business pending before a Frelinghuysen committee.&lt;ref name=FTALB&gt;Nancy Solomon, [http://www.wnyc.org/story/frelinghuysen-targets-activsts-letter-boss Frelinghuysen Targets Activist in Letter to Her Employer], [[WNYC]], May 15, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://theweek.com/speedreads/698945/gop-congressman-told-constituents-boss-that-opposed-trump-afraid-uncomfortable-resigned|title=A GOP congressman told a constituent's boss that she opposed Trump.

Painter]], a professor of law at the [[University of Minnesota]] and former chief White House ethics lawyer to President George W. Bush, described Frelinghuysen's actions as "not illegal but an awful thing to do."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2017/07/does_frelinghuysen_face_ethical_troubles_the_auditor.html |title= Does Frelinghuysen face ethical troubles? {{!}} The Auditor |website= NJ.com |accessdate= March 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonprofit ethics watchdog [[Campaign for Accountability]] filed a complaint with the [[Office of Congressional Ethics]] requesting an investigation into whether Frelinghuysen violated House ethics rules in his letter to the board member of the bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1= Caygle |first1=Heather |title= Frelinghuysen faces ethics complaint for targeting activist |url= https://www.politico.com/story/2017/05/16/rodney-frelinghuysen-ethics-complaint-238452 |accessdate= 12 January 2018 |publisher= Politico |date=May 16, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Anyone can file a complaint with the Office of Congressional Ethics; the office reviews complaints from the public and can choose to refer those it considers valid to the House Ethics Committee.&lt;ref name="Lawyers"&gt;{{cite news |last1= Jackson |first1=Herb |title= Frelinghuysen hires lawyers after ethics complaint about 'ringleader' letter |url= https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/new-jersey/2017/07/13/frelinghuysen-taps-lawyers-after-ringleader-ethics-complaint/475077001/|accessdate=12 January 2018|publisher=NorthJersey.com|date=July 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
At the start of the 112th Congress, Frelinghuysen was ranked the ninth wealthiest member of congress, with an estimated personal wealth between $20 million and $65 million.&lt;ref name=abcnews&gt;{{cite web|title=Top 5 Political Heirs|last=Besnainou|first=David and Sarah Parnass|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/top-political-heirs/story?id=15047194|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=August 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Roll Call|CQ Roll Call]] report on Frelinghuysen's wealth in 2010 indicated that about a third stemmed from personal and family trust investments in [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] stock. He owns multiple properties, including nearly 18 acres of undeveloped land in [[Frelinghuysen Township, New Jersey|Frelinghuysen Township]], New Jersey.&lt;ref name=cnbc&gt;{{cite web|last=Toscano|first=Paul|title=The Richest Members of the US Congress 2011|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/44501966/device/xml/for/rawNO|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170224053933/https://www.cnbc.com/id/44501966/device/xml/for/rawNO|dead-url=yes|archive-date=February 24, 2017|publisher=CNBC|accessdate=August 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Roy Oliver Disney''' (June 24, 1893 &amp;ndash; December 20, 1971)&lt;ref name=LATRoyODisney&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jones|first1=Jack|title=Roy O. Disney|url=http://projects.latimes.com/hollywood/star-walk/roy-o-disney/|accessdate=September 24, 2014|work=Los Angeles Times|date=December 21, 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an American businessman, becoming the partner and co-founder, along with his younger brother [[Walt Disney]], of [[Walt Disney Productions]], since renamed [[The Walt Disney Company]].

==Early life==
Roy was born to [[Irish-Canadian]] [[Elias Disney|Elias Charles Disney]] and English-[[German-American]] [[Flora Call Disney]] in [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]], [[Illinois]]. The family moved to [[Marceline, Missouri]], in 1896, and to [[Kansas City]] in 1911.  On July 1, 1911, Elias purchased a newspaper delivery route for ''[[The Kansas City Star]]''. It extended from Twenty-seventh Street to the Thirty-first Street, and from Prospect Avenue to Indiana Avenue. Roy and Walt were put to work delivering the newspapers. The Disneys delivered the morning newspaper ''[[The Kansas City Times]]'' to about 700 customers, and the evening and Sunday ''[[The Kansas City Star]]'' to more than 600. The number of customers served increased with time.&lt;ref  name= Barrier&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barrier|title = The Animated Man: A Life of Walt Disney|date=2007|pages=18–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roy graduated from the Manual Training High School of Kansas City in 1912. He left the paper delivery route and worked on a farm over the summer. He then found employment as a bank clerk along with his brother Raymond Arnold Disney at the First National Bank of Kansas City.&lt;ref name="Barrier" /&gt;

Roy served in the [[United States Navy]] from 1917 to 1919.&lt;ref name="Barrier" /&gt; A year later his brother Walt tried to join the U.S. Army but was refused because he was underage. After Roy contracted [[tuberculosis]], he was discharged from military duty and became a banker in [[Los Angeles]]. In 1923 Walt moved to Hollywood, joined Roy, and the two founded the Disney Bros. Studio. The brothers ordered [[kit house]]s from Pacific Ready Cut Homes (a Los Angeles company) and, in 1928, built their homes side by side on Lyric Avenue in the Los Feliz neighborhood of Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pollard-Terry|first1=Gayle|title=12,000 easy pieces|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/jul/16/realestate/re-kit16|accessdate=7 November 2017|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=July 16, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Walt Disney Productions==

While Walt was the creative man, Roy was the one who made sure the company was financially stable. Roy and Walt both founded Disney Studios as brothers, but Walt would buy out most of Roy's share in 1929 so, unlike [[Max Fleischer|Max]] and [[Dave Fleischer]] of rival [[Fleischer Studios]], Roy was not a co-producer. However, Roy would be equal partner in all facets of the production company.

Roy became the company's first [[CEO]] in 1929, although the official title was not given until 1968. He also shared the role of chairman of the board with Walt from 1945. Walt however dropped the chairman title in 1960 so he could focus more on the creative aspects of the company. After Walt Disney's death in 1966, Roy postponed his retirement to oversee construction of what was then known as Disney World. He later renamed it [[Walt Disney World]] as a tribute to his brother. Roy became the president of [[Walt Disney Productions]] on December 15, 1966, and remained so until 1968.

==Personal life==

Roy was married to Edna Francis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Daniel |url=http://www.netcot.com/thesite/2009/08/01/disneys-magic-makers-edna-francis-disney/ |title=Disney's Magic Makers: Edna Francis Disney |publisher=Netcot.com |date=2009-08-01 |accessdate=2012-10-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401034450/http://www.netcot.com/thesite/2009/08/01/disneys-magic-makers-edna-francis-disney/ |archivedate=April 1, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; from April 1925 until his death. Their son, [[Roy Edward Disney]], was born on January 10, 1930.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wdwcentral.wordpress.com/2008/11/30/the-windows-on-main-street-roy-e-disney/ |title=The Windows on Main Street: Roy E. Disney |publisher=Wdwcentral.wordpress.com |date= 2008-11-30|accessdate=2012-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout his life, Roy rejected the publicity and fame that came with being Walt's brother. He was extremely camera shy and a passive individual, resulting in few public photos being in existence.

==Death==
After Walt Disney World opened in October 1971, Roy Oliver Disney finally retired. On December 20, 1971 at age 78, he died from a [[intracranial hemorrhage]].  He is interred in [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Hollywood Hills)]] in Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Scott.

'''Rufus R. Dawes''' (July 4, 1838 &amp;ndash; August 1, 1899) was a military officer in the [[Union Army]] during the [[American Civil War]]. He used the middle initial "R" but had no middle name.  He was noted for his service in the famed [[Iron Brigade]], particularly during the [[Battle of Gettysburg]]. He was a post-war businessman, [[Congressman]], and [[author]], and the father of four nationally known sons, one of whom, [[Charles G. Dawes]], won the Nobel Peace Prize and served as [[Vice President of the United States]], and of two daughters. He was himself a great-grandson of [[William Dawes]], who alerted [[Thirteen Colonies|colonial]] [[Minutemen (militia)|minutemen]] of the approach of the [[British Army|British army]] prior to the [[Battles of Lexington and Concord]] at the outset of the [[American Revolution]], and a maternal great-grandson of the Rev. Manasseh Cutler, who was instrumental in adoption of the Northwest ordinance of 1787, led the formation of the Ohio Company of Associates, and became "Father of Ohio University".
&lt;ref&gt;Ferris, Mary Walton. "Dawes - Gates Ancestral Lines, Vol. I and II", privately printed 1943.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civil War==
Having migrated to [[Wisconsin]] prior to the outbreak of the Civil War&lt;ref name="Eicher204"&gt;Eicher, John H., and [[David J. Eicher]], ''Civil War High Commands.'' Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2001. {{ISBN|0-8047-3641-3}}. p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt;, Dawes organized a volunteer company from Juneau County in May, was elected Captain and appointed as such by the State on May 5, and on July 16, 1861, his Company K was mustered into the 6th Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry for three years service. The regiment served for almost a year in Northern Virginia without seeing major action. In June, 1862, Dawes was promoted to [[Major (United States)|major]]. He served with his [[regiment]] at the [[Second Battle of Manassas|Battle of Groveton]] and at [[Battle of Antietam|Antietam]] and [[Battle of Fredericksburg|Fredericksburg]]. In March, 1863, Dawes received a promotion to the rank of [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]] and served in the [[Battle of Chancellorsville|Chancellorsville Campaign]], leading a river crossing under fire at Fitzhugh's Crossing on April 29.&lt;ref&gt;Magnusen, Steve. "To My Best Girl", Indianapolis, IN, Dog Ear Publishing, LLC, 2018 ({{ISBN|978-1-4575-6431-4}}) pp. 76-85, 88-124, and 234-239.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Battle of Gettysburg, First Day|first day of the Battle of Gettysburg]] on July 1, 1863, Dawes led a [[counterattack]] on [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] [[Brigadier General (CSA)|Brigadier General]] [[Joseph R. Davis|Joseph R. Davis's]] [[brigade]] of the 2nd, 11th and 42nd Mississippi Infantry Regiments and the 55th North Carolina Infantry Regiment, many of whom were sheltered in an unfinished railroad cut west of town, and forced the surrender of more than 200 of the Confederate soldiers. He later served that year in the [[Mine Run Campaign]]. During a furlough, Dawes returned to Ohio and married Mary Beman Gates (1842–1921), from Marietta, Ohio, on January 18, 1864. Returning to the [[Army of the Potomac]], he served at the [[Battle of the Wilderness]] and the [[Siege of Petersburg]] In July 1864, Dawes was offered the full rank of [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]], but declined the promotion. He was mustered out of the army on August 10, 1864, following the Battles of [[Battle of Spotsylvania|Spotsylvania]] and [[Battle of Cold Harbor|Cold Harbor]].

On February 24, 1866, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Andrew Johnson]] nominated Dawes for appointment to the grade of [[Brevet (military)|brevet]] [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] of volunteers to rank from March 13, 1865, and the [[United States Senate]] confirmed the appointment on April 10, 1866.&lt;ref&gt;Eicher, 2001, p. 743.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hunt151"&gt;Hunt, Roger D. and Jack R. Brown, ''Brevet Brigadier Generals in Blue.'' Gaithersburg, MD: Olde Soldier Books, Inc., 1990. {{ISBN|1-56013-002-4}}. p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, Dawes became a Companion of the Ohio Commandery of the [[Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States]].

Some of Dawes' letters are available to researchers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/archive/gett/getttour/sidebar/dawes.htm]   {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100203090504/http://www.nps.gov/archive/gett/getttour/sidebar/dawes.htm |date=February 3, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From his time in the Civil War, Dawes likely suffered from [[post-traumatic stress disorder]], although he was able to cope with the symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;Reid, John J.

==Postbellum career==
Dawes returned home to Marietta, Ohio and entered the lumber business. In August of that year, his son [[Charles Gates Dawes]] was born, a future [[Vice President of the United States]]. In July 1867, [[Rufus C. Dawes]] was born at the family home. He would become a well-respected businessman and lawyer, being awarded [[Chicago]]'s Most Distinguished Citizen Award" in 1934. A third son, [[Beman Gates Dawes]], would later serve as a Congressman from Ohio, and [[Henry May Dawes]] would be a powerful banker who would serve as [[Office of the Comptroller of the Currency|Comptroller of the Currency]] for the United States under [[Warren G. Harding]] and [[Calvin Coolidge]]. Rufus and Mary Dawes also had two daughters, Mary Frances Dawes Beach and Betsey Dawes Hoyt.

Dawes also served on the Board of Trustees of Marietta College from 1871 until his death, 28 years later. He was also a [[Trustee]] for Ohio's Institute for the Deaf and Dumb. Dawes was elected to the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] in 1881 as a representative from the 15th Congressional District. A [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], he served for one term before losing his bid for re-election because he voted against the [[Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882]]&lt;ref&gt;Sortland, R. A. (1958). ''Charles G. Dawes: Businessman in Politics.'' Unpublished manuscript, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH. p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1890, he published a well-received account of his Civil War career, ''Service with the 6th Wisconsin Volunteers.'' This memoir was republished in Madison, Wisconsin by the [[Wisconsin Historical Society|State Historical Society of Wisconsin]] for the Wisconsin Civil War Centennial Commission, in 1962.  His reputation as an orator and his influential voice for the establishment of diplomatic relations with [[Persia]] prompted President [[William McKinley]] to offer Dawes the position of Minister to Persia in 1897, a post he declined due to failing health.

Dawes died two years later, August 1, 1899, in [[Marietta, Ohio]] and was buried in Oak Grove Cemetery, Marietta.&lt;ref name="Eicher204"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hunt151"/&gt;

Dawes was elected to Marietta College's Hall of Honor in 2003.

'''Securities Laws (Amendment) Act, 2014''' is a legislation in [[India]] which provided the [[securities]] market regulator [[Securities and Exchange Board of India]] (SEBI) with new powers to effectively pursue fraudulent investment schemes, especially [[ponzi scheme]]s.&lt;ref name=sebi-teeth&gt;{{cite news|title=Ponzi menace: Lok Sabha clears bill, Sebi gets more teeth|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/business-news/ponzi-menace-lok-sabha-clears-bill-sebi-gets-more-teeth/article1-1249098.aspx|accessdate=8 August 2014|work=[[Hindustan Times]]|date=7 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill also provides guidelines for the formation of special fast trial courts.&lt;ref name=empowerSEBI&gt;{{cite news|title=Bill to empower Sebi introduced in LS|url=http://www.thestatesman.net/news/69653-bill-to-empower-sebi-introduced-in-ls.html|accessdate=8 August 2014|work=[[The Statesman (India)|The Statesman]]|agency=Press Trust of India|date=4 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
After the [[Saradha Group financial scandal]], the Government of India formed an inter-ministerial group to find ways to close off loopholes the regulations which allowed such [[pyramid scheme]]s to operate.&lt;ref name=saradha&gt;{{cite news|title=Presidential ordinance grants Sebi more powers|url=http://www.livemint.com/Politics/rEoGCnR4vSgamkiasujmMP/Presidential-ordinance-grants-Sebi-more-powers.html|accessdate=9 August 2014|work=[[Live Mint]]|date=18 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Securities Law (Amendment) Ordinance was promulgated on 17 July 2013, then for a second time in September 2013. It lapsed on 15 January 2014.&lt;ref name=ordinance&gt;{{cite news|title=Cabinet likely to consider proposal for Sebi ordinance today|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/business/companies/cabinet-likely-to-consider-proposal-for-sebi-ordinance-today/|accessdate=8 August 2014|work=[[The Indian Express]]|date=28 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=third-time&gt;{{cite news|title=Power to Sebi: Ordinance promulgated for third time|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/business/business-others/power-to-sebi-ordinance-promulgated-for-third-time/|accessdate=8 August 2014|work=[[The Indian Express]]|date=28 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill couldn't be presented in the winter session of Parliament as the standing committee on finance had not finalized the report. It promulgated for a third time on 28 March 2014.&lt;ref name=third-time/&gt; 

On 24 July 2014, [[National e-Governance Plan#Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs .28CCEA.29|Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs]] (CCEA) approved the bill.&lt;ref name=cabinet-clears&gt;{{cite news|title=Cabinet clears bill to empower Sebi to deal with ponzi schemes|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/business/business-others/cabinet-clears-bill-to-empower-sebi-to-deal-with-ponzi-schemes/|accessdate=8 August 2014|work=[[The Indian Express]]|date=24 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill was introduced by [[Minister of State]] for Finance [[Nirmala Sitharaman]] in the [[Lok Sabha]] on 4 August 2014. She also introduced bills to amend Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 and [[Depositories Act]], 1996. The bills were introduced in the name of [[Finance Minister]] [[Arun Jaitley]], but he himself was unable to attend the house.&lt;ref name=empowerSEBI/&gt; The bill was passed by the Lok Sabha on 6 August 2014.&lt;ref name=sebi-teeth/&gt;

==Summary==
The ordinance passed in March 2014 had 30 clauses, whereas the bill contained 57 clauses. The bill amended three pre-existing market related laws. It retained the powers given to SEBI in the ordinance, but also introduced safeguards against misuse.&lt;ref name=tweaks&gt;{{cite news|title=New Sebi bill tweaks provisions for penalties, seizures|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2014-08-04/news/52428345_1_new-sebi-rs-10-lakh-greater-powers|accessdate=9 August 2014|work=[[The Economic Times]]|date=4 Aug 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new law gave SEBI the power to search and obtain information, including call records,&lt;ref name=tweaks/&gt; about any suspected entity from within or outside the firm. However, before conducting such searches SEBI must obtain a warrant from a [[Mumbai]] court.&lt;ref name=tackle&gt;{{cite news|title=Lok Sabha passes Bill to give teeth to Sebi to tackle ponzi menace|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2014-08-06/news/52514591_1_ponzi-menace-such-ponzi-schemes-fraudulent-investment-schemes|accessdate=8 August 2014|work=[[The Economic Times]]|date=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any unregistered scheme with a capital of more than a {{currency|100|INR}} [[crore]] was deemed as a [[collective investment scheme]], allowing SEBI to regulate it.&lt;ref name=empowerSEBI/&gt; Under pre-existing regulations, all collective investment schemes had to register with SEBI. However, many came to SEBI's attention only after complaints from defrauded investors.&lt;ref name=sebi-teeth/&gt;

Depending on the nature of the crime, minimum penalties may range from {{currency|1|INR}} [[lakh]] to {{currency|10|INR}} lakh. The minimum penalty for securities related crimes was set at {{currency|1|INR}} lakh. The minimum penalty for [[insider trading]] was at {{currency|10|INR}} lakh. The maximum penalty for [[insider trading]] was set at {{currency|25|INR}} crore or three times the profit, whichever was higher. SEBI was given the authority to initiate recovery and sale of assets. SEBI has also been given the power to enhance a penalty or settle an ongoing legal proceeding. Guidelines for special courts were also included in the bill.&lt;ref name=tweaks/&gt;

According to the [[AIAA]] Space Logistics Technical Committee, '''space logistics''' is

:... the theory and practice of driving space system design for operability, and of managing the flow of material, services, and information needed throughout a space system lifecycle.&lt;ref name=aiaa_sltc_def&gt;{{Cite web
  | author = AIAA STLC

  | url = https://info.aiaa.org/tac/SMG/SLTC/Web%20Pages/Definitions.aspx
  | accessdate = 2011-09-28}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

However, this definition in its larger sense includes terrestrial logistics in support of space travel, including any additional "design and development, acquisition, storage, movement, distribution, maintenance, evacuation, and disposition of space materiel", movement of people in space (both routine and for medical and other emergencies), and contracting and supplying any required support services for maintaining space travel.&lt;ref name=aiaa_sltc_def/&gt;

[[Wernher von Braun]] spoke of the necessity (and the underdevelopment) of space logistics as early as 1960:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite video

:"We have a logistics problem coming up in space ... that will challenge the thinking of the most visionary logistics engineers. As you know, we are currently investigating three regions of space: near-Earth, the lunar region, and the planets. While it is safe to say that all of us have undoubtedly been aware of many or most of the logistics requirements and problems in the discussion, at least in a general way, I think it is also safe to state that many of us have not realized the enormous scope of the tasks performed in the logistics area. I hope the discussions bring about a better understanding of the fact that logistics support is a major portion of most large development projects. Logistics support, in fact, is a major cause of the success or failure of many undertakings."

:The United States space exploration goals expressed in January 2004 call for the retirement of the [[Space Shuttle program]] following completion of [[International Space Station]] (ISS) construction. Since the Shuttle is instrumental in transporting large quantities of cargo to and from the ISS, this functional capability must be preserved to ensure ongoing station operations in a post-Shuttle era. Fulfilling ongoing cargo transport requirements to the ISS is a prime opportunity for NASA to reduce costs and preserve and repurpose the unique and limited Shuttle resource by acquiring cargo transportation services commercially. Further, implementing such a service prior to retirement of the Shuttle reduces risk to the vehicle and her crews by eliminating their use for routine cargo transport missions while accelerating the readiness for alternative ISS-support transportation.

:In January 2004, President Bush directed NASA to begin an initiative that focuses on exploration of the Moon, Mars, and beyond. This initiative calls for the completion of International Space Station (ISS) assembly by the end of the decade coincident with retirement of the Space Shuttle.&lt;ref&gt;G.W. Bush, A Renewed Spirit of Discovery: The Presidents Vision for U.S. Space Exploration, January 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Retirement of the Shuttle while ISS operations are still being conducted results in reduced capability to supply ISS logistics requirements. An examination of existing and planned logistics carriers shows that there are deficiencies in both capacity and capability to support ISS needs. [[SPACEHAB]]'s history of space station logistics delivery and existing ground infrastructure coupled with NASA's mandate and documented intent to acquire commercial space systems and services when possible has led SPACEHAB to develop a versatile and affordable cargo transport service for ISS .&lt;ref&gt;United States Congress, National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958, as amended, Public Law 85-568, 1984.

:NASA has awarded $3.8 million to two MIT engineering professors to pursue an interdisciplinary study for adapting [[supply chain]] logistics to support interplanetary material transport and transfer. Professors David Simchi-Levi and Olivier de Weck of the [[List of Massachusetts Institute of Technology faculty|MIT Engineering Systems Division]] will spearhead the project in partnership with the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]], [[Payload Systems]], and [[United Space Alliance]].
:Sustainable space exploration is impossible without appropriate supply chain management and unlike Apollo, future exploration will have to rely on a complex supply network on the ground and in space. The primary goal of this project is to develop a comprehensive supply chain management framework and planning tool for space logistics. The eventual integrated space logistics framework will encompass terrestrial movement of material and information, transfer to [[launch site]]s, integration of payload onto launch vehicles and launch to [[Low Earth Orbit]], in-space and planetary transfer, and planetary surface logistics. The MIT-led interplanetary supply chain management model will take a four-phase development approach:
:1. Review of supply chain management lessons learned from Earth-based commercial and military projects, including naval submarine and arctic logistics
:2. Space logistics network analyses based on modeling Earth-Moon-Mars orbits and expected landing-exploration sites
:3. Demand/supply modeling that embraces uncertainty in demand, cargo mix, costs, and supply chain disruptions
:4. Development of an interplanetary supply chain architecture.

==State of the ISS logistics capability in 2005==
A snapshot of the logistics of a single space facility, the International Space Station, was provided in 2005 via a comprehensive study done by James Baker and Frank Eichstadt.&lt;ref name=baker_eichstadt/&gt;  This article section makes extensive reference to that study.

===ISS cargo requirements===
{{asof|2004}}, the [[Federal government of the United States|United States]] [[Space Shuttle]], the [[Russia]]n [[Progress (spacecraft)|Progress]], and to a very limited extent, the Russian [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz]] vehicles were the only [[space transport]] systems capable of transporting ISS cargo.&lt;ref name=baker_eichstadt/&gt;

However, in 2004, it was already anticipated that the European [[Automated Transfer Vehicle]] (ATV) and Japanese [[H-II Transfer Vehicle|H-IIA Transfer Vehicle]] (HTV) would be introduced into service before the end of [[Assembly of the International Space Station|ISS Assembly]]. As of 2004, the US Shuttle transported the majority of the pressurized and unpressurized cargo and provides virtually all of the recoverable [[downmass|down mass]] capability (the capability of non-destructive reentry of cargo).&lt;ref name=baker_eichstadt/&gt;{{update after|2012|12|27}}

===Cargo vehicle capabilities===
Baker and Eichstadt also wrote, in 2005:&lt;ref name=baker_eichstadt/&gt;
:An understanding of the future ISS cargo requirements is necessary to size a commercial cargo vehicle designed to replace the Shuttle's capabilities and capacities and augment currently planned alternative vehicles. Accurate estimates of ISS cargo transfer requirements are difficult to establish due to ongoing changes in logistics requirements, crew tending levels, vehicle availabilities, and the evolving role the ISS will play in NASA's space exploration and research goals.
:An increased unpressurized cargo delivery requirement is shown during the years 2007–2010. This increased rate is a result of a current plan to preposition unpressurized spares on the ISS prior to Shuttle retirement. Provision of a commercial cargo carrier capable of transporting unpressurized spares to supplement the Shuttle eliminates the prepositioning requirement and aligns the estimated averages during 2007–2010 to approximately 24,000&amp;nbsp;kg for pressurized cargo and 6800&amp;nbsp;kg for unpressurized cargo. Considering the delivery capability of the remaining systems after the Shuttle is retired yields.
:Retirement of the Shuttle and reliance on the Progress, ATV, and HTV for ISS logistics will result in no significant recoverable down-mass capability. Further, no evidence suggests that any of these cargo transport systems can increase production and launch rates to cover the cargo delivery deficiency.

===Commercial opportunity===
Baker and Eichstadt also wrote, in 2005:&lt;ref name=baker_eichstadt/&gt;
:In addition to ISS support deficiencies, alternative opportunities for a commercial cargo transport system exist. The retirement of the Shuttle will also result in an inability to conduct Low Earth Orbit (LEO) research independent of the ISS. A commercial payload service could serve as a free-flying research platform to fulfill this need. As logistics support requirements for NASA's space exploration initiative emerge, existing commercial system can be employed.

:Finally, nascent interest in the development of non-government commercial space stations must take resupply issues into consideration. Such considerations will undoubtedly be subjected to a make/buy analysis. Existing systems which have amortized their development costs across multiple government and non-government programs should favor a “buy” decision by commercial space station operators. As these markets arise, commercial companies will be in a position to provide logistics services at a fraction of the cost of government-developed systems. The resulting economies of scale will benefit both markets. This conclusion was reached by a Price-Waterhouse study chartered by NASA in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;Price Waterhouse, Analysis of NASA lease and purchase alternatives for the commercial Middeck augmentation module, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; The study concluded that the value of SPACEHAB's flight-asset-based commercial module service with an estimated net-present-value of $160 million would have cost the US government over $1 billion to develop and operate using standard cost plus contracting. SPACEHAB's commercial operations and developments (such as the Integrated Cargo Carrier) since 1991 represent further cost savings over government-owned and operated systems.

:Commercial companies are more likely to efficiently invest private capital in service enhancements, assured continued availability, and enhanced service capability. This tendency, commonplace in non-aerospace applications, has been demonstrated by SPACEHAB in the commercial space systems market via continued module enhancements and introduction of new logistics carriers.

:Shortfalls in ISS cargo transport capacity, emerging opportunities, and experience gained from SPACEHAB's existing ground and flight operations have encouraged development of Commercial Payload Service (CPS). As a commercially developed system, SPACEHAB recognizes that to optimize its capability and affordability requires that certain approaches in system development and operations be taken.

:The first approach levies moderate requirements on the system. Introducing fundamental capabilities on the front end and scarring for enhanced capabilities later reduces cost to launch and shortens development time.

:The second one is the utilization of existing technology and capabilities, where appropriate. A typical feature of NASA programs is the continual reach for newly developed technologies. While attractive from a technical advancement perspective, this quest is expensive and often fails to create operational capabilities. A commercially developed cargo module will maximize the use of existing technologies (off the shelf where possible) and seek technical advances only where system requirements or market conditions drive the need for such advances. Additionally, costs associated with the development of spacecraft are not limited to those associated with the vehicle systems. Significant costs associated with the infrastructure must also be considered. SPACEHAB's existing logistics and vehicle processing facilities co-located with the Eastern launch range and at the Sea Launch facilities enable avoidance of significant system development costs.

:Finally, SPACEHAB has realized cost and schedule reductions by employing commercial processes instead of Government processes. As a result, SPACEHAB's mission integration template for a Shuttle-based carrier is 14 months, compared to 22 months for a similar Shuttle-based Multi-Purpose Logistics Module (MPLM).&lt;ref&gt;National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Station program implementation plan, vol. 6: Cargo Physical Integration, SSP 50200-06, December 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rack transfer capability===
Baker and Eichstadt also wrote, in 2005:&lt;ref name=baker_eichstadt/&gt;
:The ISS utilizes the [[International Standard Payload Rack]] (ISPR) as the primary payload and experiment accommodations structure in all US operated modules. Transferring ISPRs onto and off the ISS requires passage through the hatch only found at the Common Berthing Mechanism (CBM) berthing locations. The diameter of the CBM combined with ISPR proportions typically drives cargo vehicle diameters to sizes only accommodated by 5 m payload fairings launched on Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicles (EELV).

===Recoverable reentry–pressurized payloads===
Baker and Eichstadt also wrote, in 2005:&lt;ref name=baker_eichstadt/&gt;
:The Russian Progress vehicle has long served as a cargo vehicle which, upon departing a space station, destructively reenters the atmosphere destroying all “cargo” on board. This approach works very effectively for removing unwanted mass from a space station. However, NASA has indicated that the return of payloads from the ISS is highly desirable [5]. Therefore, a commercial system must examine the implications of including a pressurized payload return capability either in the initial design or as an enhanced feature of the service to be introduced in the future. Providing such capability requires the incorporation of thermal protection subsystem, deorbit targeting subsystems, landing recovery subsystems, ground recovery infrastructure, and FAA licensure. The recovery of unpressurized payloads presents unique challenges associated with the exposed nature of unpressurized carriers. To implement a recoverable reentry system for unpressurized payloads requires the development of an encapsulation system. Encapsulation activities must either occur autonomously prior to reentry or as a part of the operations associated with loading the unpressurized cargo carrier with return cargo. In either case, additional cost associated with spacecraft systems or increased operational requirements will be higher than simply loading and departing a pressurized carrier for a destructive reentry.

===Mixed manifest capability===
Baker and Eichstadt also wrote, in 2005:&lt;ref name=baker_eichstadt/&gt;
:Typically, the avoidance of point solutions provides flexibility for a given system to provide variable capabilities. Designing a cargo carrier that mixes pressurized and unpressurized systems can lead to increased cost if all associated cargo accommodations must be flown on every flight. To avoid unnecessary costs associated with designing and flying structure that accommodates fixed relative capacities of all types of payloads, a modular approach is taken for CPS. Anticipated cargo transport requirements for ISS after the Shuttle is retired indicate that dedicated pressurized and unpressurized missions can support the ISS up-mass requirements. Utilizing common base features (i.e. service module, docking system, etc.) and modularizing the pressurized and unpressurized carrier elements of the spacecraft assures flexibility while avoiding point solutions.

===Propellant transfer===
Baker and Eichstadt also wrote, in 2005:&lt;ref name=baker_eichstadt/&gt;
:The Russian Segment of the ISS (RSOS) has the capability via the probe and cone docking mechanisms to support propellant transfer. Incorporation of propellant transfer capability introduces international issues requiring the coordination of multiple corporate and governmental organizations. Since ISS propellant requirements are adequately provided for by the Russian Progress and ESA ATV, costs associated with incorporating these features can be avoided. However, the CPS’ modular nature coupled with the inherent capability of selected subsystems enables economical alternatives to propellant transfer should ISS needs require.

:Indirect costs considered in developing the CPS architecture include licensing requirements associated with [[International Traffic in Arms Regulations]] (ITAR) and the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) commercial launch and entry licensing requirements. ITAR licensing drives careful selection of the vehicle subsystem suppliers. Any utilization or manufacturing of spacecraft subsystems by non-US entities can only be implemented once the appropriate Department of State and/or Commerce approvals are in place. FAA licensing requirements necessitate careful selection of the launch and landing sites. Vehicles developed by a US organized corporation, even if launched in another country, require review of the vehicle system, operations, and safety program by the FAA to ensure that risks to people and property are within acceptable limits &lt;ref&gt;Federal Aviation Administration-Office of Commercial Space Transportation, 14 CFR, November 2000 (Chapter III).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Downmass==
While significant focus of space logistics is on ''upmass'', or payload mass carried up to orbit from Earth, space station operations also have significant downmass requirements. 
Returning cargo from [[low-Earth orbit]] to Earth is known as transporting ''downmass'', the total logistics payload mass that is returned from space to the surface of the Earth for subsequent use or analysis.&lt;ref name=nsfdc20120420/&gt;
Downmass logistics are important aspects of [[Research and development|research]] and [[manufacturing]] work that occurs in orbital space facilities.

For the [[International Space Station]], there have been periods of time when downmass capability was severely restricted.  For example, for approximately ten months from the time of the retirement of the Space Shuttle following the [[STS-135]] mission in July 2011—and the resultant loss of the Space Shuttle's ability to return payload mass—an increasing concern became returning downmass cargo from [[low-Earth orbit]] to Earth for subsequent use or analysis.&lt;ref name=nsfdc20120420&gt;
{{cite news |last=Bergin|first=Chris |title=Cargo up and down: Dragon to demonstrate the importance of downmass |url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2012/04/cargo-up-down-spacexs-dragon-demonstrate-importance-downmass/ |accessdate=2012-04-23 |newspaper=NASA Spaceflight |date=2012-04-20 |quote=''"Cargo runs in general are vital to the Station, however, not least since the end of the massive capability enjoyed by the ISS via the Space Shuttle fleet. With the orbiters now retired, an array of resupply vehicles are aiming to take up the slack, ranging from the ongoing Russian Progress vehicles, to Europe’s ATV, Japan’s HTV and – to a very small extent – the Russian Soyuz vehicles.  However, it was the additional capability of the Shuttle’s downmass role with the ISS that was often understated during the final years of their flights to the Station, something the Russian, European and Japanese resupply vehicles could not mitigate once the fleet was retired, bar the very small downmass allowed by the Soyuz."''}}&lt;/ref&gt;
During this period of time, of the four space vehicles capable of reaching and delivering cargo to the International Space Station, only the Russian [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz]] vehicle could return even a very small cargo payload to Earth. The Soyuz cargo downmass capability was limited as the entire [[space capsule]] was filled to capacity with the three ISS crew members who return on each Soyuz return.  None of the remaining [[Comparison of space station cargo vehicles|cargo resupply vehicles]] — the [[Russian Space Agency]] [[Progress (spacecraft)|Progress]], the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA) [[Automated Transfer Vehicle|ATV]], the [[Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency]] (JAXA) [[H-II Transfer Vehicle|HTV]] — can return any downmass cargo for terrestrial use or examination.&lt;ref name=nsfdc20120420/&gt;

After 2012, with the successful berthing of the [[private spaceflight|commercially contracted]] [[SpaceX]] [[Dragon spacecraft|Dragon]] during the [[COTS Demo Flight 2|Dragon C2+]] mission in May 2012, and the [[SpaceX CRS-1|initiation of operational cargo flights]] in October 2012,&lt;ref name=bbc20121028&gt;

{{Taxation}}
'''Tax assessment''', or '''assessment''', is the job of determining the value, and sometimes determining the use, of [[property]], usually to calculate a [[property tax]].  This is usually done by an office called the '''assessor''' or '''tax assessor'''.

==United States==
In [[local government in the United States]], an assessor, also called a '''tax assessor''', is an appointed or elected official charged with determining the value of each taxable property in a [[county (United States)|county]], [[municipality]], or [[civil township|township]]; this information is then used by the local governments to determine the necessary rates of taxation to support the community's annual public budgets.  In Florida, this official is known as the '''property appraiser'''.  In Vermont&lt;!---and possibly other New England states---&gt;, this office is known as a '''lister'''.
