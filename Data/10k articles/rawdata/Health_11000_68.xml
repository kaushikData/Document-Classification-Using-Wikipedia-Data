In 2006, there were several outbreaks of [[foodborne illness]] from spinach and lettuce contaminated by [[E. coli O157:H7|''E. coli'' O157:H7]].

==Spinach==
{{main|2006 North American E. coli O157:H7 outbreak in spinach}}
The initial outbreak occurred in September 2006 and its probable origin was an Angus cattle ranch that had leased land to a spinach grower (growing under organic practices).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/03/23/BAGJDOQM1H8.DTL |title=San Benito County ranch source of tainted spinach |date=March 23, 2007 |publisher=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |first=George |last=Raine |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5v6ngAyBT?url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fc%2Fa%2F2007%2F03%2F23%2FBAGJDOQM1H8.DTL |archivedate=December 20, 2010 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; At least 205 consumer illnesses and 3 deaths have been attributed to the tainted produce.&lt;ref name="cdc"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/foodborne/ecolispinach/current.htm |title=Update on Multi-State Outbreak of E. coli O157:H7 Infections From Fresh Spinach |date=October 3, 2006 |work=[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] |accessdate=2006-10-06 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5v6kx9kFd?url=http://www.cdc.gov/foodborne/ecolispinach/current.htm |archivedate=December 20, 2010 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Taco Bell ===
[[File:E.coli outbreak 2.png|thumb|The affected New Jersey counties, as of December 7, 2006. Note that Montgomery and Philadelphia counties in Pennsylvania and Nassau, Suffolk, Clinton, Orange, Oneida, and Otsego counties in New York State were also affected.]]

In December 2006, [[Taco Bell]] restaurants in four Northeastern states emerged as a common link among 71 sickened people across five states, 52 of whom were ultimately confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control to have tested positive the same ''E. coli'' strain.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/ecoli/2006/december/121406.htm CDC | E. coli Outbreak - Update: Dec. 14, 2006 | CDC Foodborne and Diarrheal Diseases Branch] {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/5v6nq8MSn?url=http://www.cdc.gov/ecoli/2006/december/121406.htm |date=December 20, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A total of 33 people in New Jersey, 22 in New York, 13 in Pennsylvania, 2 in Delaware, and 1 in South Carolina fell ill, according to the CDC.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

The four states with Taco Bell restaurants where these consumers were confirmed to have eaten were in New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, and Delaware. (The patient from South Carolina ate  a Taco Bell restaurant in Pennsylvania).&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

Of the 71 reported cases, 53 were hospitalized and 8 developed a type of kidney failure called [[hemolytic-uremic syndrome]].  According to the CDC, illness onset dates ranged from November 20 to December 6.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

On December 7, 2006, an initial investigation attributed the outbreak to green [[onion]]s, which had been supplied to the Taco Bell restaurants by a single [[McLane Company]] distribution center in Burlington Township, New Jersey.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"&gt;''2 N.J. food distributors aid contamination probe'', ''The Star-Ledger'' (Newark, New Jersey), December 7, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tainted green onions may have proven a ready culprit in part because of their involvement in at least one widely reported prior outbreak of ''E. coli''. In 2003, green onions were suspected as the cause of a foodborne illness involving the [[Chi-Chi's]] restaurant chain in western [[Pennsylvania]] that killed 4 people and sickened 660.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/s_406042.html Chi-Chi's checks to arrive soon] {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/5v6nqMwRR?url=http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/s_406042.html |date=December 20, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After further investigation, Taco Bell determined that the cause of the problem was with [[lettuce]], not green onions, and switched produce suppliers in the New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Delaware area. Company president Greg Creed stated in a press release that Taco Bell was cooperating with the CDC and the FDA in the controversy and he also stated that two of the people who claimed they got sick from eating Taco Bell actually did not eat there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ift.org/cms/?pid=1000363 December 20, 2006 IFT weekly newsletter] - Accessed December 21, 2006.  {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5v6nqTD7c?url=http://www.ift.org/cms/?pid=1000363 |date=December 20, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though green onions were proven to not be the source of Taco Bell's ''E. coli'' outbreak, Taco Bell has no plans to put them back on the menu.

By mid-December 2006, both green onions and [[McLane Company]] had been eliminated as possible sources of the Taco Bell contamination.&lt;ref&gt;''McLane and Green Onions Cleared from List of E.coli Suspects'', ''Convenience Store News'', December 13, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;An investigation by the New Jersey Department of Health and Environmental Services at McLane's distribution center in Burlington, N.J.&lt;/ref&gt; Taco Bell's tainted lettuce was later traced, via packaging, to farms in the Central Valley of California, although no specific sources have been made public.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://articles.latimes.com/2007/jan/13/local/me-lettuce13 Lettuce was culprit in latest case]", ''Los Angeles Times'', January 13, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Taco John's ===
Later in December 2006, Iowa and Minnesota health officials investigated an ''E. coli'' outbreak that was traced to foods served at [[Taco John's]] restaurants in Cedar Falls, Iowa and Albert Lea and Austin, Minnesota. As of December 13, 2006, the Iowa Department of Health had confirmed that at least 50 Iowans had become ill with ''E. coli'' infections after eating at Taco John's. On December 18, 2006, the Minnesota Department of Health reported that 37 probable ''E. coli'' cases had been reported in connection with the Taco John's ''E. coli'' outbreak, nine people were confirmed ill with ''E. coli'', eight people were hospitalized, and one person had developed hemolytic-uremic syndrome.

The Taco John's ''E. coli'' outbreak was traced to contaminated lettuce sold in foods at Taco John's restaurants that were supplied by a Minneapolis lettuce supplier. In response to the Taco John's ''E. coli'' outbreak, Taco John's agreed to reimburse ill individuals for medical expenses, and hired a new fresh produce supplier.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tacojohns.com/NewsItem_TJLetter.htm Taco John's open letter (Issue date not listed.)] - Accessed December 21, 2006  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928031419/http://www.tacojohns.com/NewsItem_TJLetter.htm |date=September 28, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Taco John's president and CEO Paul Fisherkeller stated in an open letter that their restaurant food was safe to eat in the wake of the ''E. coli'' outbreak that closed three of their restaurants in [[Iowa]] and [[Minnesota]].

== Other reported 2006 outbreaks ==
A report of a viral outbreak at an [[Olive Garden]] restaurant in [[Indianapolis, Indiana]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2006/HEALTH/12/18/olive.garden.outbreak/index.html CNN.com report on Olive Garden outbreak in Indianapolis, IN] - Accessed December 18, 2006 {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/5v6nr353l?url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/HEALTH/12/18/olive.garden.outbreak/index.html |date=December 20, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; occurred in mid-December.

== Regulatory and industry response ==
Since the 2006 outbreaks, various legislative proposals have emerged and the state and federal levels to require stricter food production, processing and handling. Industry participants have also taken voluntary measures to improve food safety.&lt;ref&gt;''Firms debut changes for food safety'', ''The Californian (Salinas, California)'', June 8, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the outbreak in 2006, the [http://www.caleafygreens.ca.gov/ California Leafy Greens Handler Marketing Agreement (LGMA)] was established in the spring of 2007.  The LGMA, operating with oversight from the [http://www.cdfa.ca.gov/ California Department of Food and Agriculture], provides a mechanism for verifying that farmers follow established food safety practices for lettuce, spinach and other leafy greens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.caleafygreens.ca.gov/members/documents/LGMAAcceptedGAPs06.13.08_001.pdf| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100202201911/http://www.lgma.ca.gov/members/documents/LGMAAcceptedGAPs06.13.08_001.pdf| |archivedate = February 2, 2010 | title  = Lettuce &amp; Leafy Greens Prod. &amp; Harvest BP Draft| work = PDF| date = June 13, 2008| accessdate = 17 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Farmers, shippers and processors in California have demonstrated their willingness to follow a set of food safety practices by signing onto the LGMA.  Once a company joins the LGMA, it becomes mandatory for that member company to sell and ship produce only from farmers who comply with the LGMA accepted food safety practices.  The grocery stores and restaurants who buy California leafy greens products support the food safety program by only purchasing these products from the [https://web.archive.org/web/20100805153603/http://www.caleafygreens.ca.gov/members/certified_members.asp LGMA member companies who passed mandatory government inspections].  The California LGMA has now become a model program for farmers in other states.

'''Abortion in Germany''' is permitted in the first [[trimester (pregnancy)|trimester]] upon condition of mandatory counseling, and is also permitted later in pregnancy in cases of medical necessity. In both cases, a waiting period of three days is required. The counseling, called ''{{lang|de|Schwangerschaftskonfliktberatung}}'' ("pregnancy-conflict counseling"), must take place at a state-approved centre, which afterwards gives the applicant a ''{{lang|de|Beratungsschein}}'' ("certificate of counseling").

{{as of|2010}}, the abortion rate was 6.1 abortions per 1,000 women aged 15-44 years.&lt;ref name="un2013"&gt;{{Cite web | title = World Abortion Policies 2013 | publisher = United Nations | year = 2013 | url = https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/publications/policy/world-abortion-policies-2013.shtml | accessdate = 3 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Legalization of [[abortion]] was first widely discussed in [[Germany]] during the early 20th century. When Germany became a country in 1871, section 218 of the Constitution outlawed abortion, requiring a penal term for both the woman and the doctor involved. During the [[Weimar Republic]], such discussion led to a reduction in the maximum penalty for abortion, and in 1926 a court's decision legalized abortion in cases of grave danger to the life of the mother. [[Nazi eugenics|Nazi Germany's eugenics laws]] liberalized abortion for both [[Aryan race#Nazism|Aryan]] and non-Aryan women. Aryan women could obtain an abortion simply by demonstrating that either parent had an hereditary defect, or that the child would be born with a congenital defect. Non-Aryan women were "encouraged" to utilize contraception and abortion in order to reduce their populations.&lt;ref name="free"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Abortion and Women's Legal Personhood in Germany 1991 | publisher = Review of Law and Social Change | year = 1991 | url = https://www.academia.edu/1378119/Abortion_and_Womens_Legal_Personhood_in_Germany_A_Contribution_to_the_Feminist_Theory_of_the_State | accessdate = 12 March 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|reason=Cited source states that the preceding two sentences are merely one historian's argument, not proven fact. |date=June 2017}}

In [[Nazi Germany]], the penalties for abortion were increased again. In 1943, providing an abortion to an Aryan woman became a capital offense. Abortion was permitted if the fetus was deformed or disabled.&lt;ref name="Ferree"&gt;{{Cite book |first=Myra Marx |last=Ferree |authorlink=Myra Marx Ferree |title=Shaping abortion discourse: democracy and the public sphere in Germany and the United States |year=2002 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SRn9qynS20kC&amp;pg=PA27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Reforming Sex: The German Movement for Birth Control and Abortion Reform, 1920-1950 |year=1997 |publisher=Oxford University Press |first=Atina |last=Grossmann |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tex-BuFgji0C&amp;pg=PA152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== After 1945 ===

After [[World War II]], abortion remained broadly illegal throughout both Germanys: [[West Germany]] retained the legal situation of 1927, while [[East Germany]] passed a slightly more encompassing set of exceptions in 1950. The legal requirements in the West were extremely strict, and often led women to seek abortions elsewhere, particularly in the [[Netherlands]]. It has been estimated that about 2 million women had abortions each year between 1945 and 1948, mostly in the Soviet zone. An abortion cost around 1000 marks and was performed without anaesthesia. 6000 Berlin women died each year in the Soviet zone from resulting complications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Richie |first1=Alexandra |title=Faust's Metropolis |date=1998 |publisher=Carroll &amp; Graf |location=New York |isbn=0-7867-0510-8 |page=617 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

East Germany legalized abortion on demand until 12 weeks of pregnancy in 1972, in the [[Volkskammer]]'s only non-unanimous vote ever in the first 40 years of its existence. After West Germany followed suit in 1974, its new law was [[German Federal Constitutional Court abortion decision|struck down in 1975]] by the [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany|Constitutional Court]] as inconsistent with the human rights guarantee of the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|constitution]]. It held that the unborn has a [[right to life]], that abortion is an act of killing, and that the fetus deserves legal protection throughout its development. Nevertheless, the [[legal opinion]] strongly hinted that increasing the number of situations in which abortion was legal might be constitutional.

In 1976, West Germany legalized abortion up until twelve weeks of pregnancy — for reasons of [[medical necessity]], sexual crimes, or serious social or emotional distress — if approved by two doctors, and subject to counseling and a three-day waiting period. In 1989, a [[Bavaria]]n doctor was sentenced to two and a half years in prison, and 137 of his patients were fined for failing to meet the certification requirements.

The two laws had to be reconciled after [[German reunification|reunification]]. A new law was passed by the [[Bundestag]] in 1992, permitting first-trimester abortions on demand, subject to counseling and a three-day waiting period, and permitting late-term abortions when the physical or psychological health of the woman is seriously threatened. The law was quickly challenged in court by a number of individuals — including Chancellor [[Helmut Kohl]] — and by the State of Bavaria. The Constitutional Court decided a year later to maintain its earlier decision that the constitution protected the fetus from the moment of conception, but stated that it is within the discretion of parliament not to punish abortion in the first trimester,{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} provided that the woman had submitted to state-regulated [[informed consent|counseling]] intended to discourage termination and protect fetal life. Parliament passed such a law in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.buzer.de/s1.htm?g=StGB&amp;a=218-219b&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- URL no longer valid &lt;ref&gt;[http://annualreview.law.harvard.edu/population/abortion/GERMANY.abo.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt; Abortions are covered by [[universal healthcare|public health insurance]] if the pregnancy was caused by sexual abuse, such as rape, or if the mother's health is seriously endangered by the pregnancy. For women with low income, the state governments pay for an abortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Schwangerschaftsabbruch|url=https://www.aok.de/inhalt/schwangerschaftsabbruch/|website=AOK|accessdate=5 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:New Zealand wine.JPG|thumb|A selection of [[New Zealand wine]]s]]
{{Culture of New Zealand}}

[[Alcohol (drug)|Alcohol]] has been consumed in [[New Zealand]] since the arrival of European settlers. The most popular alcoholic beverages are [[beer in New Zealand|beer]] and [[New Zealand wine|wine]]. New Zealand has no minimum consumption age for alcohol, however the minimum purchase age is 18.&lt;ref name="Legal Age"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bartistich|first1=Marija|title=Under 18s and the Law|url=http://www.cheers.org.nz/talking-to-teens/what-works/under-18s-and-the-law.html|website=Cheers.co.nz|accessdate=27 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Early history===
There is no oral tradition or archaeological evidence of [[Māori people|Māori]] brewing beer before the arrival of Europeans. Major ingredients of beer were not introduced to New Zealand until Europeans arrived in the late-18th century. Captain James Cook brewed a beer flavoured with local spruce tree needles while visiting New Zealand in 1773 in order to combat scurvy aboard ship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wigrambrewing.co.nz/beer.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110427074319/http://www.wigrambrewing.co.nz/beer.html |date=April 27, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He brewed the beer while anchored in Ship Cove in the outer reaches of Queen Charlotte Sound in January 1770. Here he experimented with the use of young [[Dacrydium cupressinum|rimu]] branches as a treatment against [[scurvy]]. It was brewed on Saturday 27 March 1773 on [[Resolution Island, New Zealand|Resolution Island]], in [[Dusky Sound]], [[Fiordland]]. The beer was brewed using [[wort]] with the addition of [[molasses]] and rimu bark and leaves. James Cook wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"We also began to brew beer from the branches or leaves of a tree, which much resembles the American black-spruce. From the knowledge I had of this tree, and the similarity it bore to the spruce, I judged that, with the addition of inspissated juice of wort and molasses, it would make a very wholesome beer, and supply the want of vegetables, which this place did not afford; and the event proved that I was not mistaken."&lt;ref&gt;James Cook, ''A Voyage Towards the South Pole and Round the World'', Volume 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Wine making]] and [[vine]] growing go back to [[Colonialism|colonial]] times in New Zealand. [[Resident (title)|British Resident]] and keen [[oenologist]] [[James Busby]] was, as early as 1836, attempting to produce wine at his land in [[Waitangi, Northland|Waitangi]].&lt;ref name=OCW-NZ&gt;winepros.com.au. {{Cite web|last= ''Oxford Companion to Wine''|title= New Zealand|url= http://www.winepros.com.au/jsp/cda/reference/oxford_entry.jsp?entry_id=2206|access-date= 2014-06-18|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150215162220/http://www.winepros.com.au/jsp/cda/reference/oxford_entry.jsp?entry_id=2206|archive-date= 2015-02-15|dead-url= yes|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1851 New Zealand's oldest existing vineyard was established by French [[Roman Catholic]] missionaries at Mission Estate in Hawke's Bay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jasons.co.nz/hawkes-bay/wineries|title=Hawkes Bay Wineries|publisher=[[Jasons Travel Media]]|access-date=2014-06-18|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120802162812/http://www.jasons.co.nz/hawkes-bay/wineries|archive-date=2012-08-02|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to economic (the importance of animal agriculture and the protein export industry), legislative ([[prohibition]] and the [[temperance movement|temperance]]) and cultural factors (the overwhelming predominance of beer and [[spirit]] drinking British immigrants), wine was for many years a marginal activity in terms of economic importance. [[Dalmatia]]n immigrants arriving in New Zealand at the end of the nineteenth and beginning of the twentieth century brought with them [[viticulture|viticultural]] knowledge and planted vineyards in West and North Auckland. Typically, their [[vineyards]] produced [[sherry]] and [[Port wine|port]] for the palates of New Zealanders of the time, and [[table wine]] for their own community.

The three factors that held back the development of the industry simultaneously underwent subtle but historic changes in the late 1960s and early 1970s. In 1973, Britain entered the [[European Economic Community]], which required the ending of historic trade terms for New Zealand meat and dairy products. This led ultimately to a dramatic restructuring of the agricultural economy. Before this restructuring was fully implemented, diversification away from traditional protein products to products with potentially higher economic returns was explored. Vines, which produce best in low moisture and low soil fertility environments, were seen as suitable for areas that had previously been marginal [[pasture]]. The end of the 1960s saw the end of the New Zealand institution of the "six o'clock swill", where pubs were open for only an hour after the end of the working day and closed all Sunday. The same legislative reform saw the introduction of [[BYO]] (bring your own) licences for restaurants.

Finally, the late 1960s and early 1970s noted the rise of the "overseas experience," where young New Zealanders travelled and lived and worked overseas, predominantly in Europe. As a cultural phenomenon, the overseas experience predates the rise of New Zealand's premium wine industry, but by the 1960s a distinctly New Zealand identity had developed and the passenger jet made the overseas experience possible for large numbers of New Zealanders who experienced first-hand the premium wine cultures of Europe.

===Temperance movement===
{{main article|Temperance movement in New Zealand}}
Between 1836 and 1919, the [[Temperance movement in New Zealand|New Zealand temperance movement]] became a powerful and popular lobby group, as similar movements did in the UK and the USA. In 1919 at a national referendum poll, prohibition gained 49% of the vote and was only defeated when the votes of returned servicemen were counted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/politics/temperance-movement/voting-for-prohibition "Voting for prohibition"] www.nzhistory.net.nz, retrieved 14 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Well known [[:Category:New Zealand temperance activists|temperance activists in New Zealand]] include [[William Fox (politician)|William Fox]], [[Frank Isitt]], [[Leonard Isitt (minister)|Leonard Isitt]], [[Elizabeth McCombs]], [[James McCombs]], [[Kate Sheppard]], [[Robert Stout]] and [[Tommy Taylor (New Zealand politician)|Tommy Taylor]].

===Alcohol law===

====First Liquor Laws====
The liquor laws of New Zealand begin with the [[Colonisation of New Zealand]] and the implementation of [[English Common Law]] to New Zealand between 1840 and 1842, when New Zealand was jurisdictionally part of the [[Colony of New South Wales]].&lt;ref name="Page 1 - Te Ara"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Christoffel|first=Paul|title=Liquor laws - Early liquor laws|encyclopedia=Te Ara - The Encyclopedia of New Zealand|page=1&lt;!--|pages=5--&gt;|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/liquor-laws/page-1|date=15 December 2014|accessdate=27 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Laws for Māori'''&lt;br&gt;
The first laws prohibiting [[Māori people]] from consuming alcohol in New Zealand were established between 1847 and 1878. Laws were passed due to the common belief the Māori were susceptible to alcohol abuse.&lt;ref name="Page 1 - Te Ara"/&gt;

For over a century, from the 1847 laws to 1948, Māori were restricted to buying alcohol from off-licensed vendors. In 1948 Parliament repealed most discriminatory measures, in part due to pressure from Māori servicemen returning from war.&lt;ref name="Page 1 - Te Ara"/&gt;

The [[King Country]] had an alcohol ban from when the predominantly Māori area was opened to pakeha in 1883 to 1953. 

'''Laws for Women'''&lt;br&gt;
Prior to 1961, Women were generally restricted to private bars in hotels as legislation allowed licencees to refuse them service in the (cheaper) public bars.

====Regulation and Licensing====
In 1842 the first licensing system was introduced to New Zealand. This licensing system was mainly based on the then-[[Provinces of New Zealand|provincial councils]], however this changed in 1873 when legislature was passed to establish a national licensing system.&lt;ref name="Page 1 - Te Ara"/&gt;

Until the 1990s off-licence alcohol sales where restricted to hotels, bottle shops, and private clubs were also allowed to sell alcohol for take home consumption. In 1990 supermarkets were granted permission to sell wine but not beer, but under amendments made in 1999,&lt;ref name="legnz"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Government of New Zealand|first1=Her Majesties|title=Sale of Liquor Amendment Act, 1999|url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1999/0092/latest/DLM32605.html|website=legislation.govt.nz|publisher=Legislation New Zealand|accessdate=28 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; supermarkets and some smaller grocers now had permission to extend their liquor licences to sell beer as well as wine.

The 1999 legislation also legalized the sale of alcohol on Sundays for the first time in nearly 120 years.&lt;ref name="legnz"/&gt;

'''Licensing Act, 1881'''&lt;br&gt;
The Licensing Act of 1881 was enacted due to the dissolution of the Provincial Councils of New Zealand to centralize the inconsistent statutes of the former Provinces.&lt;ref name="Page 1 - Te Ara"/&gt;

The Licensing Act of 1881 banned some entertainments, including dancing girls. Section 127 stated: ‘Whereas a practice exists in certain parts of the colony of hiring women and young girls to dance in rooms and places where liquors are sold: any contract by which any females shall be hired to dance in any such room or place shall be null and void.’ Proprietors risked having their establishment identified as a ‘disorderly house’ (a brothel), receiving a fine or losing their liquor license if they hired dancing girls.&lt;ref name="Page 1 - Te Ara"/&gt;

The Act banned alcohol sales on Sundays, [[Christmas Day]], and Good Friday.&lt;ref name="Page 1 - Te Ara"/&gt;

====Legal Ages====
The first registered consumption age limits were imposed for the first time meaning nobody under the age of 18 could drink in a public bar and nobody under the age of 13 could buy alcohol to take home.

The Licensing Act of 1881 created a minimum age of 16 to purchase alcohol in a bar, however did not impose a minimum age to purchase alcohol to be taken away.&lt;ref name="Page 1 - Te Ara"/&gt;

The legal drinking age was again amended in 1910 when the legal age to drink in hotels was increased to 21 - however minors could still buy alcohol to take home until 1914 when the age for both on- and off-licence purchase was set at 21.

In 1969 the purchase age was lowered from 21 to 20. (although 18-year-olds were allowed to drink in bars from 1990 on certain conditions.) But in 1999 the legal purchasing age was lowered from 20 to 18 and despite several calls and legislation to raise the drinking age again, Lawmakers have overwhelmingly favoured the status quo and the age remains 18. It has never been illegal for a minor to drink alcohol in their own home on supervision of their parents or guardians however in 2013, minors consuming alcohol in a private setting other than their homes had to acquire parental permission before doing so.

====Six o'clock swill====
{{main article|Six o'clock swill}}
The most significant piece of alcohol legislation introduced in New Zealand was the "six o'clock swill" in 1917. Intended to only be a temporary wartime measure through the remainder of [[World War One]], this new law required all hotel bars to close at 6 pm nightly (and all day Sunday).

The swill was made permanent in 1919 owing to pressure from the then powerful [[temperance movement]]. The new law was supposed to curb drunkenness and crime and to send men home early to encourage family life, however six o'clock closing had the opposite effect. 
Men would finish work at 5 pm and had only one hour to drink as much alcohol (usually beer and from half gallon (2.2 litre) jugs) as possible before closing. This phenomenon created a culture of [[binge drinking]].

The six o'clock swill also encouraged men to drive home from the hotels extremely drunk and car crashes were the most common between 6 pm and 8 pm especially on Friday and Saturday evenings. This was not helped by the fact New Zealand had no realistic Blood Alcohol limits for driving until 1969.

The swill ended on 9 October 1967 when pubs could stay open until 10 pm after a referendum on 26 September overwhelmingly saw voters favour change. A previous referendum in 1949 rejected later closing (due to economic rather than moral reasons).

==Current alcohol law==
===Special Events===
Under New Zealand law, pubs looking to operate after the 3-4am liquor sales ban will have to apply for special licensing from their local board.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nzherald.co.nz/brewing-and-liquor-industry/news/article.cfm?c_id=136&amp;objectid=11465456&lt;/ref&gt;

===Licensing trusts===
[[Licensing trust]]s, under New Zealand law, are community-owned companies with a monopoly on the development of premises licensed for the sale of alcoholic beverages and associated accommodation in an area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10687073|title=Opposition's voice heard on liquor bill|date=12 November 2010|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] (NZPA)|accessdate=12 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thirty licencing trusts were established between 1944 and 1975. They were strongly supported by ministers [[Peter Fraser]] and [[Rex Mason]]. &lt;ref&gt; ''Licencing Trusts'' by Bernard Teuhen in "Policy Quarterly" February 2018, Vol 14 No 1 pages 68-73 &lt;/ref&gt;

==Beer production==
{{main article|Beer in New Zealand}}
[[Beer]] is the most popular alcoholic drink in New Zealand, accounting for 63% of available alcohol for sale.&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_10713655"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10713655 |title=Beer hops off buyers' lists |author=Carroll, Joanne |date=20 March 2011 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=19 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; New Zealand is ranked 21st in [[List of countries by beer consumption per capita|beer consumption per capita]], at around 75.5 litres per person per annum. The vast majority of beer produced in New Zealand is a type of [[lager]], either pale or amber in colour, and between 4%–5% alcohol by volume.

===19th and 20th centuries===
The first commercial brewery in New Zealand was established in 1835 by [[Joel Samuel Polack]] in Kororareka (now [[Russell, New Zealand|Russell]]) in the [[Bay of Islands]]. During the 19th century, New Zealand inherited the brewing traditions and styles of the United Kingdom and Ireland, being where the majority of European immigrants originated from during that time – thus the dominant beer styles would have been ales, porters &amp; stouts.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

[[File:Speights brewery.jpg|right|thumb|[[Speight's]] brewery in [[Dunedin]]]]
The culture of the [[six o'clock swill]] was to have an influence on the styles of beer brewed and drunk in New Zealand. In the 1930s, the New Zealander [[Morton W. Coutts]] invented the continuous fermentation process. Gradually, beer production in New Zealand shifted from ales to lagers, using continuous fermentation. The style of beer made by this method has become known as New Zealand Draught and became the most popular beer during the 6 o'clock swill period.

During the same period, there was a gradual consolidation of breweries, such that by the 1970s virtually all brewing concerns in New Zealand were owned by either Lion Breweries or Dominion Breweries. From the 1980s small boutique or microbreweries started to emerge, and consequently the range of beer styles being brewed increased. The earliest was Mac's Brewery, started in 1981 in Nelson. Some [[pub]]s operated their own small breweries, often housed within the pub itself.

=== 21st century ===

In recent years, pale and amber lager, the largest alcoholic drinks sector in terms of volume sales, have been on a downward trend as a result of a declining demand for standard and economy products.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euromonitor.com/Alcoholic_Drinks_in_New_Zealand Alcoholic Drinks in New Zealand]&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, ale production in New Zealand is primarily undertaken by small independent breweries &amp; brewpubs, the Shakespeare Brewery in Auckland city being the first opened in 1986 for the 'craft' or 'premium' sector of the beer market. In 2010, this 'craft/premium' sector grew by 11%, to around 8% of the total beer market.&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_10713655"/&gt; This has been in a declining beer market, where availability of beer has dropped 7% by volume in the two previous years.

Craft beer and microbreweries were blamed for a 15 million litre drop in alcohol sales overall in 2012, with Kiwis opting for higher-priced premium beers over cheaper brands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.3news.co.nz/Craft-beer-sales-increase-by-20-million-litres/tabid/420/articleID/288182/Default.aspx| archive-url= https://archive.is/20130414010641/http://www.3news.co.nz/Craft-beer-sales-increase-by-20-million-litres/tabid/420/articleID/288182/Default.aspx| dead-url= yes| archive-date= April 14, 2013| work= 3 News NZ| title= Craft beer sales increase by 20 million litres| date= February 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The craft beer market in New Zealand is varied and progressive, with a full range of ale &amp; lager styles of beer being brewed. New Zealand is fortunate in that it lies in the ideal latitude for [[barley]] and [[hops]] cultivation. A breeding programme had developed new hop varieties unique to New Zealand,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzhops.co.nz/] NZ Hops website&lt;/ref&gt; many of these new hops have become mainstays in New Zealand craft beer.

Given the small market and relatively high number of breweries, many breweries have spare capacity. A recent trend has seen the rise of contract brewing, where a brewing company contracts to use space in existing breweries to bring the beer to the market. Examples of contract brewers include Funk Estate, Epic Brewing Company and Yeastie Boys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brewersguild.org.nz/news/2010/yeastie-boys-bust-out |title=News &amp;#124; Brewers Guild of New Zealand |publisher=Brewersguild.org.nz |date= |accessdate=2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over 2011 and 2012, New Zealand faced a shortage of hops, which affected several brewers countrywide, and was mainly due to a hop shortage in North America and an increase in demand for New Zealand hops overseas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jono Galuszka |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/industries/5716703/Hop-shortage-hits-brewers |title=Beer Brewers Hit By Hop Shortage |publisher=Stuff.co.nz |date=2011-10-01 |accessdate=2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Peter Watson And Fairfax |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/nelson-mail/features/primary-focus/7851423/Co-op-confident-of-avoiding-specialty-hop-shortage |title=Co-op confident of avoiding hop shortage |publisher=Stuff.co.nz |date=2012-10-23 |accessdate=2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wine production==
{{main|New Zealand wine}}&lt;!-- Material below taken from New Zealand wine page --&gt;

===First steps===
In the 1970s, [[Montana Wines|Montana]] in Marlborough started producing wines which were labelled by year of production ([[vintage]]) and grape variety (in the style of wine producers in Australia). The first production of a [[Sauvignon blanc]] of great note appears to have occurred in 1977. Also produced in that year were superior quality wines of Muller Thurgau, Riesling and Pinotage.
The excitement created from these successes and from the early results of Cabernet Sauvignon from Auckland and Hawkes Bay launched the industry with ever-increasing investment, leading to more hectares planted, rising land prices and greater local interest and pride. Such was the boom that over-planting occurred, particularly in the "wrong" varietals that fell out of fashion in the early 1980s. In 1984 the then Labour Government paid growers to pull up vines to address a glut that was damaging the industry. Ironically many growers used the Government grant not to restrict planting, but to swap from less economic varieties (such as Müller Thurgau and other hybrids) to more fashionable varieties ([[Chardonnay]] and Sauvignon blanc), using the old root stock. The glut was only temporary in any case, as boom times returned swiftly.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

===Sauvignon blanc breakthrough===
[[File:Jackson Estate Sauvignon blanc.jpg|thumb|upright|A bottle of Jackson Estate sauvignon blanc from New Zealand]]
New Zealand is home to a successful variety of [[sauvignon blanc]]. [[Oz Clarke]], a well-known British wine critic wrote in the 1990s that New Zealand Sauvignon blanc was "arguably the best in the world" (Rachman).{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} Historically, Sauvignon blanc has been used in many French regions in both [[Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée|AOC]] and [[Vin de Pays]] wine. The most famous had been [[France|France’s]] [[Sancerre (wine)|Sancerre]]. It is also the grape used to make [[Pouilly Fumé]].
Following [[Robert Mondavi]]'s lead in renaming Californian Sauvignon blanc [[Fumé Blanc]] (partially in reference to Pouilly Fumé and partially to denote the smokiness of the wine produced due to flinty soil properties and partial oak barrel ageing) there was a trend for oaked Sauvignon blanc in New Zealand during the late 1980s.  Later the fashion for strong oaky overtones and also the name waned.

In the 1980s, wineries in New Zealand, especially in the [[Marlborough Region|Marlborough]] region, began producing outstanding, some critics said unforgettable, Sauvignon blanc. "New Zealand Sauvignon blanc is like a child who inherits the best of both parents—exotic aromas found in certain Sauvignon blancs from the New World and the pungency and limy acidity of an [[Old World]] Sauvignon blanc like Sancerre from the [[Loire Valley]]" (Oldman, p.&amp;nbsp;152). One critic said that drinking one's first New Zealand Sauvignon blanc was like having sex for the first time (Taber, p.&amp;nbsp;244). "No other region in the world can match Marlborough, the northeastern corner of New Zealand's South Island, which seems to be the best place in the world to grow Sauvignon blanc grapes" (Taber, p.&amp;nbsp;244).

'''Avignone Chemists''' was an [[United States|American]] full service [[pharmacy]] located in New York's [[Greenwich Village]]. Avignone Chemists was founded in 1832 which made it the oldest [[apothecary]] in the United States. Avignone marketed itself as the Independent Anti-Chain Pharmacy. It closed in 2015.

== History ==
Founded in 1832 as Stock Pharmacy, the original location was at 59 [[Macdougal Street]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Pharmaceutical Era|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ouQfAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA680-IA7&amp;lpg=PA680-IA7&amp;dq=avignone+chemists+1832&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=2x9gWtpkXd&amp;sig=ltevjwPCwnZfTec5ctalY4Avrbc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ArchT6OlBuiB0QG_u-nbCA&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=avignone%20chemists%201832&amp;f=false|publisher=University of Michigan|accessdate=19 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stock Pharmacy  was purchased in 1898 by Francis Avignone who proceeded to change the name to Avignone Pharmacy. In 1929, Avignone Pharmacy moved to 281 6th Avenue, its current location, into a two-story building built by the Avignone family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Avignone Pharmacy|url=http://www.waltergrutchfield.net/avignone.htm|publisher=Walter Grutchfield|accessdate=19 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, it is known as Avignone Chemists and is owned and operated by Andrew Fruchtman and his business partner John Duffy.

Avignone was recognized as an important small business with the presentation of a Village Award&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Past Village Award Winners|url=http://www.gvshp.org/_gvshp/events/awards.htm|website=GVSHP|accessdate=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation]] in 2013.

[[File:Sihor.jpg|thumb|Brahma Kund]]
'''Brahma Kund'''{{efn-ua|There are several places in India where the tank known as ''Brahma Kund'' are located such as at [[Haridwar]], at [[Pushkar]], at [[Vrindavan]] and in [[Assam]].}} is a [[Temple tank|stepped temple tank]] in [[Sihor]] town of [[Bhavnagar district]], [[Gujarat]], India. It is located near the southern wall of the old town. It believed that it was constructed by [[Jayasimha Siddharaja]].&lt;ref name="BG"&gt;{{cite book|title=Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c70MAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA541|year=1884|publisher=Printed at the Government Central Press|pages=541, 655}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The exact dates of Brahma Kund is unknown. It mentioned in ''[[Skanda Purana]]''.&lt;ref name="BG"/&gt;

According to legend, [[Chaulukya dynasty|Chaulukya]] king [[Jayasimha Siddharaja]] was suffering from skin disease following the curse from [[Ranakadevi]], the queen whom he captured from [[Junagadh]]. He was cured after bathing in this tank so he refurbished the tank. The water of the tank is still considered miraculous.&lt;ref name="BG"/&gt; It is mentioned in ''Prabandh Chintamani'' written by [[Merutunga]]. The tank kept finding its reference and mentions citing Siddharaj since 12th century.

It is also mentioned in ''[[Ain-e-Akbari]]''. Poet [[Nanalal Dalpatram Kavi]] expresses and explains in his ''Hari Samhita'' that [[Krishna]] had visited the place.

==Architecture==
Brahma Kund, built in the style of medieval architecture, has a design of steps, small temples, metaphors, motifs and beliefs, idols of [[Hindu]] deities, stone work, some scientific entities, everything carved within and across the complex.&lt;ref name="Shukla 2014"&gt;{{cite web | last=Shukla | first=Rakesh | title=ક્યારેક ચાંદીના આભૂષણોના વેપાર માટે જાણીતું હતું ગુજરાતનું આ શહેર-વિસ્તૃત કોતરણી | website=gujarati.oneindia.com | date=9 March 2014 | url=http://gujarati.oneindia.com/travel/bhavnagar-tourism-the-rewarding-downtown-016512-pg1.html | language=gu | accessdate=3 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is Neelkanth Mahadev temple near the tank. There is a lake known as ''Gautam Lake'' and Gautameshwar temple is located nearby.&lt;ref name="BG"/&gt;

The tank is the State Protected Monument (S-GJ-35). It is now poorly maintained.&lt;ref name="divyabhaskar 2011"&gt;{{cite web | title=બેદરકારીને લીધે પુરાતન સ્થાપત્યોનું સૌંદર્ય નષ્ટ | website=Divyabhaskar | date=21 October 2011 | url=http://www.divyabhaskar.co.in/news/SAU-bhavnagars-acient-place-in-bad-position-2516042.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161230055958/http://www.divyabhaskar.co.in/news/SAU-bhavnagars-acient-place-in-bad-position-2516042.html | language=gu | accessdate=30 December 2016|archive-date=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cannabis refugee''' (or '''marijuana refugee''') is a term, primarily used in the United States and Canada, referring to people who have moved from one location to another due to cannabis [[Prohibition of drugs|prohibition]] laws, motivated either by a desire to have legal access to [[Medical cannabis|cannabis]] to treat medical conditions for themselves or their family, or to legally consume [[cannabis]] for any other reason.&lt;ref name="Colorado Springs Gazette"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://gazette.com/families-of-children-with-epilepsy-moving-to-colorado-drawn-by-success-of-marijuana-oil/article/1507895 | title=Families of children with epilepsy moving to Colorado, drawn by success of marijuana oil | work=[[The Gazette (Colorado Springs)|The Gazette]] | date=October 20, 2013 | accessdate= | author=Philipps, Dave }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/03/10/health/medical-marijuana-refugees/ | title=Medical marijuana refugees: 'This was our only hope' | work=[[CNN]] | date=March 10, 2014 | accessdate= | author=Young, Saundra }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13219">The name '''Catuaba''' (pronounced [ka.two.'aba], a [[Guarani language|Guarani]] word that means "what gives strength to the Indian") is used for the infusions of the [[Bark (botany)|bark]] of a number of trees native to [[Brazil]]. The most widely used barks are derived from the trees ''[[Trichilia catigua]]'' and ''[[Erythroxylum vaccinifolium]]''. Other catuaba preparations use the bark of trees from the following genera or families: ''[[Anemopaegma]]'', ''[[Ilex]]'', ''[[Micropholis]]'', ''[[Phyllanthus]]'', ''[[Secondatia]]'', ''[[Tetragastris]]'' and species from the [[Myrtaceae]].

It is often claimed that catuaba is derived from the tree ''Erythroxylum catuaba'', but this tree has been described only once, in 1904, and it is not known today to what tree this name referred. ''E. catuaba'' is therefore not a recognised species (Kletter et al.; 2004).

Local synonyms are Chuchuhuasha, Tatuaba, Pau de Reposta, Piratancara and Caramuru. A commercial liquid preparation, Catuama, contains multiple ingredients, one of these being catuaba from ''Trichilia catigua''.

An [[infusion]] of the bark is used in traditional Brazilian medicine as an [[aphrodisiac]] and [[central nervous system]] stimulant. These claims have not been confirmed in scientific studies. In catuaba is found a group of three alkaloids dubbed [[catuabine]] A, B and C.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

A study by Manabe et al. (1992) showed that catuaba extracts from Catuaba casca (''Erythroxylum catuaba Arr. Cam.'') were useful in preventing potentially lethal [[bacteria]]l [[infection]]s and [[HIV]] infection in [[mouse|mice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Manabe H, Sakagami H, Ishizone H |title=Effects of Catuaba extracts on microbial and HIV infection |journal=In Vivo |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=161–5 |year=1992 |pmid=1525337 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4285">In [[statistics]], and especially in the statistical analysis of [[psychology|psychological]] data, the '''counternull''' is a statistic used to aid the understanding and presentation of research results. It revolves around the [[effect size]], which is the mean magnitude of some effect divided by the [[standard deviation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Pashler, Harold E. |author2=Stevens, S. S. |title=Steven's handbook of experimental psychology |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |location=Chichester |year=2002 |pages= 138, 422 |isbn=0-471-44333-6 | quote = The counternull revolves around an increasingly common measure called “effect size,” which, essentially, is the mean magnitude of some effect (e.g., the mean difference between two conditions) divided by the standard deviation (generally pooled over the conditions).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''counternull value''' is the effect size that is just as well supported by the data as the [[null hypothesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Rubin, Donald B. |author2=Rosenthal, Robert |author3=Rosnow, Ralph L. |title=Contrasts and effect sizes in behavioral research: a correlational approach |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |year=2000 |pages= 5 |isbn=0-521-65258-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, when results are drawn from a distribution that is symmetrical about its mean, the counternull value is exactly twice the observed effect size.

The null hypothesis is a [[Statistical hypothesis testing|hypothesis]] set up to be tested against an alternative. Thus the counternull is an alternative hypothesis that, when used to replace the null hypothesis, generates the same [[p-value]] as had the original null hypothesis of “no difference.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Some researchers contend that reporting the counternull, in addition to the ''p''-value, serves to counter two common errors of judgment:&lt;ref name=Rosenthal1994&gt;{{cite journal

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* assuming that failure to reject the null hypothesis at the chosen level of statistical significance means that the observed size of the "effect" is zero; and
* assuming that rejection of the null hypothesis at a particular ''p''-value means that the measured "effect" is not only statistically significant, but also scientifically important.
These arbitrary statistical thresholds create a discontinuity, causing unnecessary confusion and artificial [[controversy]].&lt;ref&gt;Pasher (2002), p. 348: "The reject/fail-to-reject &lt;nowiki&gt;[the null hypothesis]&lt;/nowiki&gt; dichotomy keeps the field awash in confusion and artificial controversy."&lt;/ref&gt;

Other researchers prefer [[confidence interval]]s as a means of countering these common errors.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Electroconvulsive therapy''' ('''ECT'''), formerly known as '''electroshock therapy''', and often referred to as '''shock treatment,''' is a [[psychiatry|psychiatric]] treatment in which [[seizure]]s are electrically induced in patients to provide relief from [[mental disorder]]s.&lt;ref name=Rudorfer/&gt; The ECT procedure was first conducted in 1938&lt;ref&gt;Rudorfer, M.

Quote, p38: "Three major practice guidelines have been published on ECT. These guidelines include: APA Task Force on ECT (2001);  Third report of the Royal College of Psychiatrists’ Special Committee on ECT (2004); National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE 2003; NICE 2009).

These three forms of application have significant differences in both adverse side effects and symptom remission. Placement can be bilateral, in which the electric current is passed across the whole brain, or unilateral, in which the current is passed across one hemisphere of the brain. Bilateral placement seems to have greater efficacy than unilateral, but also carries greater risk of memory loss.&lt;ref name="Dr.Jamal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Read 333–47"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Read|first=J|author2=Bentall, R|title=The effectiveness of electroconvulsive therapy: a literature review|journal=Epidemiologia e Psichiatria Sociale|date=Oct–Dec 2010|volume=19|issue=4|pages=333–47|pmid=21322506|url=http://www.power2u.org/downloads/1012-ReadBentallECT.pdf|doi=10.1017/S1121189X00000671}}&lt;/ref&gt; After treatment, drug therapy is usually continued, and some patients receive maintenance ECT.&lt;ref name=FDA2011rev/&gt;

== Medical use ==
ECT is used with [[informed consent]]&lt;ref name =Beloucif/&gt; in treatment-resistant [[major depressive disorder]], treatment-resistant [[catatonia]], or prolonged or severe [[mania]], and in conditions where "there is a need for rapid, definitive response because of the severity of a psychiatric or medical condition (e.g., when illness is characterized by stupor, marked psycho-motor retardation, depressive delusions or hallucinations, or life-threatening physical exhaustion associated with mania)."&lt;ref name=FDA2011rev/&gt;&lt;ref name="who.int"&gt;World Health Organisation (2005).

Geneva, 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Major depressive disorder===
For major depressive disorder, ECT is generally used only when other treatments have failed, or in emergencies, such as imminent suicide.&lt;ref name=FDA2011rev/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.mja.com.au/open/2012/1/4/non-pharmacological-biological-treatment-approaches-difficult-treat-depression|pmid=25370288|year=2013|last1=Fitzgerald|first1=P.

====Efficacy====
A [[meta-analysis]] on the effectiveness of ECT in unipolar and [[bipolar depression]] was conducted in 2012. Results indicated that although patients with [[unipolar depression]] and bipolar depression responded to other medical treatments very differently, both groups responded equally well to ECT. Overall remission rate for patients given a round of ECT treatment was 51.5% for those with unipolar depression and 50.9% for those with bipolar depression. The severity of each patient’s depression was assessed at the same baseline in each group.&lt;ref name=Dierckx/&gt;

There is little agreement on the most appropriate follow-up to ECT for people with major depressive disorder.&lt;ref name=Jelovac2013Rev/&gt;  When ECT is followed by treatment with [[antidepressants]], about 50% of people relapsed by 12 months following successful initial treatment with ECT, with about 37% relapsing within the first 6 months.  About twice as many relapsed with no antidepressants.  Most of the evidence for continuation therapy is with [[tricyclics]]; evidence for relapse prevention with newer antidepressants is lacking.&lt;ref name=Jelovac2013Rev/&gt;

In 2004, a meta-analytic review paper found in terms of efficacy, "a significant superiority of ECT in all comparisons: ECT versus simulated ECT, ECT versus placebo, ECT versus antidepressants in general, ECT versus TCAs and ECT versus MAOIs."&lt;ref name="pmid15087991"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pagnin D, de Queiroz V, Pini S, Cassano GB | title = Efficacy of ECT in depression: a meta-analytic review | journal = The Journal of ECT | volume = 20 | issue = 1 | pages = 13–20 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15087991 | doi = 10.1097/00124509-200403000-00004| url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, The UK ECT Review group published a [[systematic review]] and meta-analysis comparing ECT to [[placebo]] and [[antidepressant drugs]]. This meta-analysis demonstrated a large effect size (high efficacy relative to the mean in terms of the standard deviation) for ECT versus placebo, and versus antidepressant drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=UK ECT Review Group |title=Efficacy and safety of electroconvulsive therapy in depressive disorders: a systematic review and meta-analysis |journal=The Lancet|volume=361 |issue=9360 |pages=799–808 |year=2003 |pmid=12642045 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(03)12705-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compared with [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]] for people with treatment-resistant major depressive disorder, ECT relieves depression about twice as well, reducing the score on the [[Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression]] by about 15 points, while TMS reduced it by 9 points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Micallef-Trigona B | year = 2014 | title = Comparing the effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroconvulsive therapy in the treatment of depression: a systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = Depress Res Treat | volume = 2014 | issue = | page = 135049 | pmid = 25143831 | doi=10.1155/2014/135049 | pmc=4131106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Catatonia===
ECT is generally a second-line treatment for people with [[catatonia]] who do not respond to other treatments, but is a first-line treatment for severe or life-threatening catatonia.&lt;ref name=FDA2011rev/&gt;&lt;ref name=catatoniaRev&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Sienaert P, etal | date = Dec 2014 | title = A clinical review of the treatment of catatonia | journal = Front Psychiatry | volume = 5 | issue = | page = 181 | doi = 10.3389/fpsyt.2014.00181 | pmid = 25538636 | pmc=4260674}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Leroy|first=Arnaud|last2=Naudet|first2=Florian|last3=Vaiva|first3=Guillaume|last4=Francis|first4=Andrew|last5=Thomas|first5=Pierre|last6=Amad|first6=Ali|date=2017-06-21|title=Is electroconvulsive therapy an evidence-based treatment for catatonia?

===Mania===
ECT is used to treat people who have severe or prolonged [[mania]];&lt;ref name=FDA2011rev/&gt; [[NICE]] recommends it only in life-threatening situations or when other treatments have failed&lt;ref name=NICEtech2003&gt;NICE [https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ta59 Guidance on the use of electroconvulsive therapy.

===Schizophrenia===
ECT is rarely used in treatment-resistant [[schizophrenia]], but is sometimes recommended for schizophrenia when short-term global improvement is desired, or the subject shows little response to [[antipsychotic]]s alone. It is useful in the case of severe exacerbations of [[catatonic schizophrenia]], whether excited or stuporous.&lt;ref name=FDA2011rev/&gt;&lt;ref name=NICEtech2003/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Tharyan, P.

==Effects==
Aside from effects in the brain, the general physical risks of ECT are similar to those of brief [[general anesthesia]]; the U.S. Surgeon General's report says that there are "no absolute health [[contraindications]]" to its use.&lt;ref name="SG"/&gt;{{rp|259}} Immediately following treatment, the most common adverse effects are confusion and memory loss.  It must be used very cautiously in people with [[epilepsy]] or other neurological disorders because by its nature it provokes small tonic-clonic seizures, and so would likely not be given to a person whose epilepsy is not well controlled.&lt;ref name="DoctorsLounge"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doctorslounge.com/psychiatry/procedures/ect.htm|title=Electroconvulsive therapy&amp;nbsp;– Electroshock (ECT)|publisher=DoctorsLounge|accessdate=2009-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some patients experience muscle soreness after ECT.  This is due to the muscle relaxants given during the procedure and rarely due to muscle activity. ECT, especially if combined with [[deep sleep therapy]], may lead to brain damage if administered in such a way as to lead to hypoxia or anoxia in the patient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first1=J |last1=O'Neill |first2=Robert |last2=Haupt |title=The last victim of the 'beautiful hospital' |newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald |date=2 August 1988 |url=http://newsstore.smh.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?page=1&amp;sy=smh&amp;kw=The+last+victim+of+the+%27beautiful+hospital%27&amp;pb=all_ffx&amp;dt=selectRange&amp;dr=entire&amp;so=relevance&amp;sf=text&amp;sf=headline&amp;rc=100&amp;rm=200&amp;sp=nrm&amp;clsPage=1&amp;docID=news880802_0206_0756}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E.

Oxford: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence and rationale to support giving low doses of [[benzodiazepine]]s or else low doses of [[general anesthetic]]s which induce [[sedation]] but not [[anesthesia]] to patients to reduce adverse effects of ECT.&lt;ref name="pmid22531198"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gallegos J |title=Decreasing adverse outcomes of unmodified electroconvulsive therapy: suggestions and possibilities |journal=J ECT |volume=28 |issue=2 |pages=77–81 |date=June 2012 |pmid=22531198 |doi=10.1097/YCT.0b013e3182359314 |url=|author2= Vaidya P |author3= D'Agati D  |displayauthors=etal  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While there are no absolute contraindications for ECT, there is increased risk for patients who have unstable or severe cardiovascular conditions or aneurysms; who have recently had a stroke; who have increased intracranial pressure (for instance, due to a solid brain tumor), or who have severe pulmonary conditions, or who are generally at high risk for receiving anesthesia.&lt;ref name="APA2001guideline"/&gt;{{rp|30}}

===Effects on memory===
[[Retrograde amnesia]] occurs to some extent in almost all ECT recipients.&lt;ref name="Read 333–47"/&gt; The American Psychiatric Association report (2001) acknowledges: “In some patients the recovery from retrograde amnesia will be incomplete, and evidence has shown that ECT can result in persistent or permanent memory loss”.&lt;ref name="APA2001guideline"/&gt; It is the purported effects of ECT on long-term memory that give rise to much of the concern surrounding its use.&lt;ref name="Lisanby 2000"/&gt;

However, the methods used to measure memory loss are generally poor, and their application to people with depression, who have [[cognitive deficits]] including problems with memory, have been problematic.&lt;ref name=SemkovskaRev2013&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Semkovska M, McLoughlin DM | date = Jun 2013 | title = Measuring retrograde autobiographical amnesia following electroconvulsive therapy: historical perspective and current issues | url = | journal = J ECT | volume = 29 | issue = 2| pages = 127–33 | pmid = 23303426 | doi=10.1097/YCT.0b013e318279c2c9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The acute effects of ECT can include [[amnesia]], both retrograde (for events occurring before the treatment) and anterograde (for events occurring after the treatment).&lt;ref name="Benbow"&gt;Benbow, SM (2004) "Adverse effects of ECT". In AIF Scott (ed.) [http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/publications/collegereports/cr/cr128.aspx ''The ECT Handbook, second edition.''] London: The Royal College of Psychiatrists, pp. 170–174.&lt;/ref&gt;  Memory loss and confusion are more pronounced with bilateral electrode placement rather than unilateral, and with outdated sine-wave rather than brief-pulse currents. The use of either constant or pulsing electrical impulses also varied the memory loss results in patients. Patients who received pulsing electrical impulses as opposed to a steady flow seemed to incur less memory loss. The vast majority of modern treatment uses brief pulse currents.&lt;ref name="Benbow"/&gt;

Retrograde amnesia is most marked for events occurring in the weeks or months before treatment, with one study showing that although some people lose memories from years prior to treatment, recovery of such memories was "virtually complete" by seven months post-treatment, with the only enduring loss being memories in the weeks and months prior to the treatment.&lt;ref name="Squire"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Squire LR, Slater PC, Miller PL |title=Retrograde amnesia and bilateral electroconvulsive therapy.

===Effects on brain structure===
Considerable controversy exists over the effects of ECT on brain tissue, although a number of mental health associations—including the American Psychiatric Association—have concluded that there is no evidence that ECT causes structural brain damage.&lt;ref name="APA2001guideline"/&gt;&lt;ref name=NICE2009/&gt; A 1999 report by the U.S. Surgeon General states: "The fears that ECT causes gross structural brain pathology have not been supported by decades of methodologically sound research in both humans and animals."&lt;ref name="surgeon"/&gt;

Many expert proponents of ECT maintain that the procedure is safe and does not cause brain damage. Dr. Charles Kellner, a prominent ECT researcher and former chief editor of the ''Journal of ECT'',  stated in a 2007 interview&lt;ref name="kellner interview"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.primarypsychiatry.com/aspx/articledetail.aspx?articleid=1028 |title=In Session with Charles H.

Dr. Kellner cites a study&lt;ref name="100 lifetime"&gt;{{cite journal|journal= The American Journal of Psychiatry |title=Absence of cognitive impairment after more than 100 lifetime ECT treatments|volume=148 |issue=7 |date=July 1991 |pages=929–32 |pmid=2053635 |author=Devanand DP|author2= Sackeim HA|displayauthors=etal |doi=10.1176/ajp.148.7.929 }}&lt;/ref&gt; purporting to show an absence of cognitive impairment in eight subjects after more than 100 lifetime ECT treatments.  Dr. Kellner stated "Rather than cause brain damage, there is evidence that ECT may reverse some of the damaging effects of serious psychiatric illness."

===Effects in pregnancy===
If steps are taken to decrease potential risks, ECT is generally accepted to be relatively safe during all trimesters of pregnancy, particularly when compared to pharmacological treatments.&lt;ref name=Pompili2014Rev/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Richards EM, Payne JL | date = Oct 2013 | title = The management of mood disorders in pregnancy: alternatives to antidepressants | journal = CNS Spectr | volume = 18 | issue = 5| pages = 261–71 | pmid = 23570692 | doi=10.1017/S1092852913000151| type = Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; Suggested preparation for ECT during pregnancy includes a [[pelvic examination]], discontinuation of nonessential [[anticholinergic]] medication, uterine tocodynamometry, intravenous hydration, and administration of a nonparticulate [[antacid]]. During ECT, elevation of the pregnant woman's right hip, external fetal cardiac monitoring, [[intubation]], and avoidance of excessive [[hyperventilation]] are recommended.&lt;ref name=Pompili2014Rev/&gt;   In many instances of active mood disorder during pregnancy, the risks of untreated symptoms may outweigh the risks of ECT. Potential complications of ECT during pregnancy can be minimized by modifications in technique. The use of ECT during pregnancy requires thorough evaluation of the patient’s capacity for informed consent.&lt;ref name="Miller1994"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Miller|first1=Laura J.|title=Use of Electroconvulsive Therapy During Pregnancy|journal=Psychiatric Services|volume=45|issue=5|year=1994|pages=444–450|issn=1075-2730|doi=10.1176/ps.45.5.444}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In unilateral ECT, both electrodes are placed on the same side of the patient's head. Unilateral ECT may be used first to minimize side effects such as memory loss.

In bilateral ECT, the two electrodes are placed on opposite sides of the head. Usually bitemporal placement is used, whereby the electrodes are placed on the temples. Uncommonly bifrontal placement in used; this involves positioning the electrodes on the patient's forehead, roughly above each eye.

The electrodes deliver an electrical stimulus. The stimulus levels recommended for ECT are in excess of an individual's [[seizure threshold]]: about one and a half times seizure threshold for bilateral ECT and up to 12 times for unilateral ECT.&lt;ref name="Rudorfer"/&gt;{{rp|1881}}  Below these levels treatment may not be effective in spite of a seizure, while doses massively above threshold level, especially with bilateral ECT, expose patients to the risk of more severe [[mental function|cognitive impairment]] without additional therapeutic gains.&lt;ref name="Lock"/&gt; Seizure threshold is determined by trial and error ("dose titration"). Some psychiatrists use dose titration, some still use "fixed dose" (that is, all patients are given the same dose) and others compromise by roughly estimating a patient's threshold according to age and sex.&lt;ref name="Prudic 01"/&gt; Older men tend to have higher thresholds than younger women, but it is not a hard and fast rule, and other factors, for example drugs, affect seizure threshold.

Immediately prior to treatment, a patient is given a short-acting anesthetic such as [[methohexital]], [[etomidate]], or [[thiopental]],&lt;ref name="Rudorfer"/&gt; a muscle relaxant such as [[suxamethonium]] (succinylcholine), and occasionally [[atropine]] to inhibit salivation.&lt;ref name="Rudorfer"/&gt;{{rp|1882}}   In a minority of countries such as Japan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Motohashi N, Awata S, Higuchi T |title=A questionnaire survey of ECT practice in university hospitals and national hospitals in Japan |journal=J ECT |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=21–3 |year=2004 |pmid=15087992 |doi=10.1097/00124509-200403000-00005}}&lt;/ref&gt; India,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chanpattana W, Kunigiri G, Kramer BA, Gangadhar BN |title=Survey of the practice of electroconvulsive therapy in teaching hospitals in India |journal=J ECT |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=100–4 |year=2005 |pmid=15905751 |doi=10.1097/01.yct.0000166634.73555.e6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Nigeria,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ikeji OC, Ohaeri JU, Osahon RO, Agidee RO |title=Naturalistic comparative study of outcome and cognitive effects of unmodified electro-convulsive therapy in schizophrenia, mania and severe depression in Nigeria |journal=East Afr Med J |volume=76 |issue=11 |pages=644–50 |year=1999 |pmid=10734527 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ECT may be used without anesthesia.

=== Devices ===

[[File:Siemens konvulsator III (ECT machine).jpg|thumb|ECT machine from ca 1960.]]
Most modern ECT devices deliver a brief-pulse current, which is thought to cause fewer cognitive effects than the sine-wave currents which were originally used in ECT.&lt;ref name="Rudorfer"/&gt; A small minority of psychiatrists in the US still use sine-wave stimuli.&lt;ref name="Prudic 01"/&gt; Sine-wave is no longer used in the UK or Ireland.&lt;ref name="Duffett"/&gt;
Typically, the electrical stimulus used in ECT is about 800 [[amperes|milliamps]] and has up to several hundred [[watt]]s, and the current flows for between one and 6 seconds.&lt;ref name="Lock"&gt;Lock, T (1995). "Stimulus dosing". In C Freeman (ed.) ''The ECT Handbook''. London: Royal College of Psychiatrists, 72–87.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, ECT devices are manufactured by two companies, Somatics, which is owned by psychiatrists Richard Abrams and Conrad Swartz, and [[Mecta]].&lt;ref&gt;Corinne Slusher for MedScape. Updated: Jan 6, 2012 [http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/2015450-overview#showall Electroconvulsive Therapy Machine]&lt;/ref&gt;  In the UK, the market for ECT devices was long monopolized by Ectron Ltd, which was set up by psychiatrist Robert Russell.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ectron.co.uk/our-story Ectron: Our story]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mechanism of action ==
Despite decades of research, the exact mechanism of action of ECT remains elusive. [[Neuroimaging]] studies in people who have had ECT, investigating differences between responders and nonresponders, and people who relapse, find that responders have [[anticonvulsant]] effects mostly in the [[frontal lobes]], which corresponds to immediate responses, and [[neurotrophic]] effects primarily in the [[medial temporal lobe]].  The anticonvulsant effects are decreased blood flow and decreased metabolism, while the neurotrophic effects are opposite - increased perfusion and metabolism, as well as increased volume of the [[hippocampus]].&lt;ref name=Abbott2014/&gt;

==Usage==
As of 2001, it was estimated that about one million people received ECT annually.&lt;ref name=LeiknesWWrev2012/&gt;

There is wide variation in ECT use between different countries, different hospitals, and different psychiatrists.&lt;ref name="Rudorfer"/&gt;&lt;ref name=LeiknesWWrev2012/&gt; International practice varies considerably from widespread use of the therapy in many Western countries to a small minority of countries that do not use ECT at all, such as Slovenia.&lt;ref&gt;See the [http://e-uprava.gov.si/e-uprava/en/faqKategorijaVprasanje.euprava?faq.id=74&amp;faq.vprasanje.id=328 Slovenian government website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070808181603/http://e-uprava.gov.si/e-uprava/en/faqKategorijaVprasanje.euprava?faq.id=74&amp;faq.vprasanje.id=328 |date=2007-08-08 }} for information about ECT in Slovenia.&lt;/ref&gt;

About 70 percent of ECT patients are women.&lt;ref name="Rudorfer"/&gt; This may be due to the fact that women are more likely to be diagnosed with depression.&lt;ref name="Rudorfer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Reid"/&gt; Older and more affluent patients are also more likely to receive ECT. The use of ECT is not as common in ethnic minorities.&lt;ref name="Reid"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Euba R, Saiz A |title=A comparison of the ethnic distribution in the depressed inpatient population and in the electroconvulsive therapy clinic |journal=J ECT |volume=22 |issue=4 |pages=235–6 |year=2006 |pmid=17143151 |doi=10.1097/01.yct.0000235928.39279.52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sarah Hall reports, "ECT has been dogged by conflict between psychiatrists who swear by it, and some patients and families of patients who say that their lives have been ruined by it. It is controversial in some European countries such as the Netherlands and Italy, where its use is severely restricted".&lt;ref name="Sarah Hall"&gt;[http://mindfreedomireland.com/new/index.php?view=article&amp;catid=1%3Aadministrator&amp;id=196%3Arise-in-electric-shock-therapy-in-county&amp;format=pdf&amp;option=com_content&amp;Itemid=19 Rise In Electric Shock Therapy In County.] Sarah Hall, Norwich Evening News 24, June 4, 2008.

===United States ===
ECT became popular in the US in the 1940s. At the time, psychiatric hospitals were overrun with patients whom doctors were desperate to treat and cure. Whereas [[lobotomies]] would reduce a patient to a more manageable submissive state, ECT helped to improve mood in those with severe depression. A survey of psychiatric practice in the late 1980s found that an estimated 100,000 people received ECT annually, with wide variation between metropolitan statistical areas.&lt;ref name="Hermann 95"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hermann R, Dorwart R, Hoover C, Brody J | title=Variation in ECT use in the United States | journal=Am J Psychiatry | volume=152 | issue=6 | pages=869–75 | year=1995 | pmid=7755116 | doi=10.1176/ajp.152.6.869}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Accurate statistics about the frequency, context and circumstances of ECT in the US are difficult to obtain because only a few states have reporting laws that require the treating facility to supply state authorities with this information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Dennis | last = Cauchon
| title = Patients often aren't informed of full danger | url = http://www.harborside.com/~equinox/ect1.htm | publisher = USA Today | date = 1995-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 13 of the 50 states, the practice of ECT is regulated by law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/how-everyone-became-depressed/201312/electroconvulsive-therapy-in-children "Electroconvulsive Therapy in Children" by Edward Shorter, Ph.D. December 1, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;
One state which does report such data is Texas, where, in the mid-1990s, ECT was used in about one third of psychiatric facilities and given to about 1,650 people annually.&lt;ref name="Reid"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Reid WH, Keller S, Leatherman M, Mason M |title=ECT in Texas: 19 months of mandatory reporting |journal=J Clin Psychiatry |volume=59 |issue=1 |pages=8–13 |date=January 1998 |pmid=9491059 |doi= 10.4088/JCP.v59n0103|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Usage of ECT has since declined slightly; in 2000–01 ECT was given to about 1500 people aged from 16 to 97 (in Texas it is illegal to give ECT to anyone under sixteen).&lt;ref&gt;Texas Department of State (2002) [http://www.dshs.state.tx.us/mhquality/ECT_Complete_Report_FY01.pdf Electroconvulsive therapy reports] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070810172506/http://www.dshs.state.tx.us/mhquality/ECT_Complete_Report_FY01.pdf |date=2007-08-10 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; ECT is more commonly used in private psychiatric hospitals than in public hospitals, and minority patients are underrepresented in the ECT statistics.&lt;ref name="Rudorfer"/&gt;
In the United States, ECT is usually given three times a week; in the United Kingdom, it is usually given twice a week.&lt;ref name="Rudorfer"/&gt; Occasionally it is given on a daily basis.&lt;ref name="Rudorfer"/&gt; A course usually consists of 6–12 treatments, but may be more or fewer. Following a course of ECT some patients may be given continuation or maintenance ECT with further treatments at weekly, fortnightly or monthly intervals.&lt;ref name="Rudorfer"/&gt; A few psychiatrists in the US use multiple-monitored ECT (MMECT), where patients receive more than one treatment per anesthetic.&lt;ref name="Rudorfer"/&gt; Electroconvulsive therapy is not a required subject in US medical schools and not a required skill in psychiatric residency training. Privileging for ECT practice at institutions is a local option: no national certification standards are established, and no ECT-specific continuing training experiences are required of ECT practitioners.&lt;ref name="Fink2007"&gt;Fink, M. &amp; Taylor, A.M.

The [[Mental Health Act 2007]] allows people to be treated against their will. This law has extra protections regarding ECT. A patient capable of making the decision can decline the treatment, and in that case treatment cannot be given unless it will save that patient's life or is immediately necessary to prevent deterioration of the patient's condition.  A patient may not be capable of making the decision (they "lack capacity"), and in that situation ECT can be given if it is appropriate and also if there are no advance directives that prevent the use of ECT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mentalhealthlaw.co.uk/Additional_safeguards_for_ECT_introduced_in_new_s58A | title=Additional safeguards for ECT introduced in new s58A - Mental Health Law Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1801, [[Giovanni Aldini]] used [[galvanism]] to treat patients suffering from various mental disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parent|first1=Andre|title=Giovanni Aldini: from animal electricity to human brain stimulation|journal=Can J Neurol Sci|date=2004|volume=31|issue=4|pages=576–84|pmid=15595271|doi=10.1017/s0317167100003851}}&lt;/ref&gt; G.B.C.

Convulsive therapy was introduced in 1934 by Hungarian neuropsychiatrist [[Ladislas J. Meduna]] who, believing mistakenly that [[schizophrenia]] and [[epilepsy]] were antagonistic disorders, induced seizures first with [[camphor]] and then [[metrazol]] (cardiazol).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1177/0957154X9700802908 | last1 = Berrios | first1 = G E | year = 1997 | title = The scientific origins of electroconvulsive therapy | url = | journal = History of Psychiatry | volume = 8 | issue = 29 pt 1| pages = 105–119 | pmid = 11619203 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fink-history"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fink | first1 = M | year = 1984 | title = The origins of convulsive therapy | doi = 10.1176/ajp.141.9.1034 | journal = American Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 141 | issue = 9| pages = 1034–41 | pmid = 6147103 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Meduna is thought to be the father of convulsive therapy.&lt;ref name=Bolwig&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bolwig|first=T.|title=How does electroconvulsive therapy work?

The proceedings were published in the ''[[American Journal of Psychiatry]]'' and, within three years, cardiazol convulsive therapy was being used worldwide.&lt;ref name="Fink-history" /&gt; Italian Professor of neuropsychiatry [[Ugo Cerletti]], who had been using electric shocks to produce seizures in animal experiments, and his colleague [[Lucio Bini]] developed the idea of using electricity as a substitute for metrazol in convulsive therapy and, in 1938, experimented for the first time on a person. It was believed early on that inducing convulsions aided in helping those with severe schizophrenia but later found to be most useful with affective disorders such as depression. Cerletti had noted a shock to the head produced convulsions in dogs. The idea to use electroshock on humans came to Cerletti when he saw how pigs were given an electric shock before being butchered to put them in an anesthetized state.&lt;ref name=Sabbatini&gt;{{cite web|last=Sabbatini|first=R.|title=The history of shock therapy in psychiatry|url=http://www.cerebromente.org.br/n04/historia/shock_i.htm|accessdate=2013-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cerletti and Bini practiced until they felt they had the right parameters needed to have a successful human trial. Once they started trials on patients, they found that after 10-20 treatments the results were significant. Patients had much improved. A positive side effect to the treatment was [[retrograde amnesia]]. It was because of this side effect that patients could not remember the treatments and had no ill feelings toward it.&lt;ref name="Sabbatini" /&gt; ECT soon replaced metrazol therapy all over the world because it was cheaper, less frightening and more convenient.&lt;ref&gt;Cerletti, U (1956). "Electroshock therapy". In AM Sackler ''et al''. (eds) ''The Great Physiodynamic Therapies in Psychiatry: an historical appraisal.'' New York: Hoeber-Harper, 91–120.&lt;/ref&gt; Cerletti and Bini were nominated for a [[Nobel Prize]] but did not receive one. By 1940, the procedure was introduced to both England and the US. In Germany and Austria, it was promoted by [[Friedrich Meggendorfer]]. Through the 1940s and 1950s, the use of ECT became widespread.

In the early 1940s, in an attempt to reduce the memory disturbance and confusion associated with treatment, two modifications were introduced: the use of unilateral electrode placement and the replacement of sinusoidal current with brief pulse. It took many years for brief-pulse equipment to be widely adopted.&lt;ref name="Kiloh"&gt;Kiloh, LG, Smith, JS, Johnson, GF (1988). ''Physical Treatments in Psychiatry''. Melbourne: Blackwell Scientific Publications, 190–208. {{ISBN|0-86793-112-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1940s and early 1950s ECT, was usually given in "unmodified" form, without muscle relaxants, and the seizure resulted in a full-scale convulsion. A rare but serious complication of unmodified ECT was fracture or dislocation of the long bones. In the 1940s, psychiatrists began to experiment with [[curare]], the muscle-paralysing South American poison, in order to modify the convulsions. The introduction of [[suxamethonium]] (succinylcholine), a safer synthetic alternative to curare, in 1951 led to the more widespread use of "modified" ECT. A short-acting anesthetic was usually given in addition to the muscle relaxant in order to spare patients the terrifying feeling of suffocation that can be experienced with muscle relaxants.&lt;ref name="Kiloh"/&gt;

The steady growth of antidepressant use along with negative depictions of ECT in the mass media led to a marked decline in the use of ECT during the 1950s to the 1970s. The [[Surgeon General of the United States|Surgeon General]] stated there were problems with electroshock therapy in the initial years before anesthesia was routinely given, and that "these now-antiquated practices contributed to the negative portrayal of ECT in the popular media."&lt;ref name="erica goode"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; ''The New York Times'' described the public's negative perception of ECT as being caused mainly by one movie: "For Big Nurse in ''[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (film)|One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest]],'' it was a tool of terror, and, in the public mind, ''shock therapy'' has retained the tarnished image given it by Ken Kesey's novel: dangerous, inhumane and overused".&lt;ref name="Goleman 1990"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE0D81F3EF931A3575BC0A966958260&amp;pagewanted=all|title=The Quiet Comeback of Electroshock Therapy|last=Goleman|first=Daniel|date=1990-08-02|work=The New York Times|page=B5|accessdate=2008-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, Dr. Blatchley demonstrated the effectiveness of his constant current, brief pulse device ECT. This device eventually largely replaced earlier devices because of the reduction in cognitive side effects, although as of 2012 some ECT clinics still were using sine-wave devices.&lt;ref name=LeiknesWWrev2012&gt;Leiknes KA, et al (2012) [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3381633/ Contemporary use and practice of electroconvulsive therapy worldwide.]  Brain Behav. 2(3):283-344&lt;/ref&gt; The 1970s saw the publication of the first [[American Psychiatric Association]] (APA) task force report on electroconvulsive therapy (to be followed by further reports in 1990 and 2001). The report endorsed the use of ECT in the treatment of depression. The decade also saw criticism of ECT.&lt;ref&gt;See Friedberg, J (1977). "Shock treatment, brain damage, and memory loss: a neurological perspective". ''American Journal of Psychiatry'' '''134''':1010–1014; and Breggin, PR (1979) ''Electroshock: its brain-disabling effects''. New York: Springer&lt;/ref&gt;  Specifically, critics pointed to shortcomings such as noted side effects, the procedure being used as a form of abuse, and uneven application of ECT. The use of ECT declined until the 1980s, "when use began to increase amid growing awareness of its benefits and cost-effectiveness for treating severe depression".&lt;ref name="erica goode"/&gt; In 1985, the [[National Institute of Mental Health]] and [[National Institutes of Health]] convened a consensus development conference on ECT and concluded that, while ECT was the most controversial treatment in psychiatry and had significant side-effects, it had been shown to be effective for a narrow range of severe psychiatric disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Blaine | first1 = JD | last2 = Clark | first2 = SM | year = 1986 | title = Report of the NIMH–NIH consensus development conference on Electroconvulsive therapy | url = | journal = Psychopharmacology Bulletin | volume = 22 | issue = 2| pages = 445–452 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the backlash noted previously, national institutions reviewed past practices and set new standards. In 1978, the American Psychiatric Association released its first task force report in which new standards for [[consent]] were introduced and the use of unilateral electrode placement was recommended. The 1985 NIMH Consensus Conference confirmed the therapeutic role of ECT in certain circumstances. The American Psychiatric Association released its second task force report in 1990 where specific details on the delivery, education, and training of ECT were documented. Finally, in 2001 the American Psychiatric Association released its latest task force report.&lt;ref name="APA2001guideline"/&gt; This report emphasizes the importance of [[informed consent]], and the expanded role that the procedure has in modern medicine. By 2017, ECT was routinely covered by insurance companies for providing the "biggest bang for the buck" for otherwise intractable cases of severe mental illness, was receiving favorable media coverage, and was being provided in regional medical centers.&lt;ref name="ECT Provided in Boise"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.idahostatesman.com/news/business/article133259549.html |title=This mental health treatment isn't barbaric, it 'totally changed my life'  |last=Dutton |first=Audrey |date=2017-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==

Surveys of public opinion, the testimony of former patients, legal restrictions on the use of ECT and disputes as to the efficacy, ethics and adverse effects of ECT within the psychiatric and wider medical community indicate that the use of ECT remains controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Fisher P | date = Dec 2012 | title = Psychological factors related to the experience of and reaction to electroconvulsive therapy | url = | journal = J Ment Health | volume = 21 | issue = 6| pages = 589–99 | doi = 10.3109/09638237.2012.734656 | pmid = 23216225 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Philpot|first=M|title=Barriers to the use of electroconvulsive therapy in the elderly: a European survey|journal=European Psychiatry|volume=17|issue=1|pages=41–45|doi=10.1016/S0924-9338(02)00620-X|pmid=11918992|last2=Treloar|first2=A|last3=Gormley|first3=N|last4=Gustafson|first4=L|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Whitaker|first=Robert|title=Mad in America : bad science, bad medicine, and the enduring mistreatment of the mentally ill|year=2010|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-465-02014-0|pages=102–106|edition=Rev. pbk.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Golenkov|first=A.|author2=Ungvari, G.

=== Legal status ===

==== Informed consent ====
The [[World Health Organization]] (2005) advises that ECT should be used only with the informed consent of the patient (or their guardian if their incapacity to consent has been established).&lt;ref name="who.int"/&gt;

In the US, this doctrine places a legal obligation on a doctor to make a patient aware of the reason for treatment, the risks and benefits of a proposed treatment, the risks and benefits of alternative treatment, and the risks and benefits of receiving no treatment. The patient is then given the opportunity to accept or reject the treatment. The form states how many treatments are recommended and also makes the patient aware that consent may be revoked and treatment discontinued at any time during a course of ECT.&lt;ref name="SG"/&gt; The US Surgeon General's Report on Mental Health states that patients should be warned that the benefits of ECT are short-lived without active continuation treatment in the form of drugs or further ECT, and that there may be some risk of permanent, severe memory loss after ECT.&lt;ref name="SG"/&gt; The report advises psychiatrists to involve patients in discussion, possibly with the aid of leaflets or videos, both before and during a course of ECT.

To demonstrate what he believes should be required to fully satisfy the legal obligation for informed consent, one psychiatrist, working for an [[anti-psychiatry]] organisation, has formulated his own consent form&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Johnson, R |url=http://www.psychrights.org/Research/Digest/InformedConsent/DrJohnsonECTInformedConsent.pdf |title=An informed consent form for electroconvulsive therapy, draft 1 |publisher=PsychRights|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; using the consent form developed and enacted by the Texas Legislature&lt;ref name="TX578"&gt;Texas Legislature (2004). [http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/HS/htm/HS.578.htm#578.001 Health &amp; Safety Code Chapter 578, Electroconvulsive And Other Therapies Sec.578.001].&lt;/ref&gt; as a model.

According to the US Surgeon General, involuntary treatment is uncommon in the US and is typically used only in cases of great extremity, and only when all other treatment options have been exhausted. The use of ECT is believed to be a potentially life-saving treatment.&lt;ref name="surgeon"&gt;[http://www.surgeongeneral.gov/library/mentalhealth/chapter4/sec3_1.html Mental Health: A Report of the Surgeon General&amp;nbsp;– Chapter 4]. Retrieved 2007-12-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

In one of the few jurisdictions where recent statistics on ECT usage are available, a national audit of ECT by the Scottish ECT Accreditation Network indicated that 77% of patients who received the treatment in 2008 were capable of giving informed consent.&lt;ref name="SEAN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sean.org.uk/SEANReport2009.pdf |title=The Scottish ECT Accreditation Network (SEÁN) Annual Report 2009|format=PDF |website= |year=2009 |publisher=Scottish ECT Accreditation Network| author= Fergusson G (ed)|accessdate=2010-05-24|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, in order for consent to be valid it requires an explanation in "broad terms" of the nature of the procedure and its likely effects.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, R (1996) ''Mental Health Act Manual, 5th edition.'' London: Sweet and Maxwell, page 225.&lt;/ref&gt; One review from 2005 found that only about half of patients felt they were given sufficient information about ECT and its adverse effects&lt;ref name="Information, consent and perceived coercion"&gt;Rose D, Wykes T, Bindman J, Fleischmann P (2005)[http://bjp.rcpsych.org/cgi/content/abstract/186/1/54 "Information, consent and perceived coercion: patients' perspectives on electroconvulsive therapy"]. ''[[British Journal of Psychiatry]]'' '''186''':54–59.&lt;/ref&gt; and another survey found that about fifty percent of psychiatrists and nurses agreed with them.&lt;ref name="Lutchman"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1080/09638230124779 | last1 = Lutchman | first1 = RD | year = 2001 | title = Mental health professionals' attitudes towards and knowledge of electroconvulsive therapy | journal = Journal of Mental Health | volume = 10 | issue = 20| pages = 141–150  | displayauthors = etal  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2005 study published in the ''[[British Journal of Psychiatry]]'' described patients' perspectives on the adequacy of informed consent before ECT.&lt;ref name="Information, consent and perceived coercion"/&gt; The study found that "About half (45–55%) of patients reported they were given an adequate explanation of ECT, implying a similar percentage felt they were not." The authors also stated:

{{quote|sign=|source=|Approximately a third did not feel they had freely consented to ECT even when they had signed a consent form. The proportion who feel they did not freely choose the treatment has actually increased over time. The same themes arise whether the patient had received treatment a year ago or 30 years ago. Neither current nor proposed safeguards for patients are sufficient to ensure informed consent with respect to ECT, at least in England and Wales.&lt;ref name="Information, consent and perceived coercion" /&gt;}}

==== Involuntary ECT ====
{{expand section|date=June 2017}}
Procedures for involuntary ECT vary from country to country depending on local [[mental health law]]s.

=====United States=====

In the US, ECT devices came into existence prior to medical devices being regulated by the [[Food and Drug Administration]]; when the law came into effect the FDA was obligated to retrospectively review already existing devices and classify them, and determine whether clinical trials were needed to prove efficacy and safety.  While the FDA has classified the devices used to administer ECT as [[Medical devices#Class III: General controls, Special Controls and premarket approval|Class III medical devices]],  as of 2011 the FDA had not yet determined whether the devices should be withdrawn from the market until clinical trials prove their safety and efficacy.&lt;ref name=FDA2011rev/&gt;{{rp|5}}&lt;ref name=PsychTimes/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYTimesReg/&gt; The FDA considers ECT machinery to be experimental devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Committee on Mental Health|title=Report on Electroconvulsive Therapy:EXECUTIVE SUMMARY|url=http://assembly.state.ny.us/member_files/125/20020416/|publisher=New York State Assembly|accessdate=8 March 2011|date=March 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In most states in the US, a judicial order following a formal hearing is needed before a patient can be forced to undergo involuntary ECT.&lt;ref name="SG"/&gt; However, ECT can also be involuntarily administered in situations with less immediate danger. Suicidal intent is a common justification for its involuntary use, especially when other treatments are ineffective.&lt;ref name="SG"/&gt;

=====United Kingdom=====
Until 2007 in England and Wales, the [[Mental Health Act 1983]] allowed the use of ECT on detained patients whether or not they had [[capacity (law)|capacity]] to consent to it. However, following [[Mental Health Act 2007|amendments]] which took effect in 2007, ECT may not generally be given to a patient who has capacity and refuses it, irrespective of his or her detention under the Act.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cqc.org.uk/sites/default/files/media/documents/mental_health_act_1983_201107084458_0.pdf The Mental Health Act 1983 (updated version)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111226033633/http://www.cqc.org.uk/sites/default/files/media/documents/mental_health_act_1983_201107084458_0.pdf |date=December 26, 2011 }} Part IV, Section 58. [[Care Quality Commission]]&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, even if a patient is deemed to lack capacity, if they made a valid [[Advance health care directive|advance decision]] refusing ECT then they should not be given it; and even if they do not have an advance decision, the psychiatrist must obtain an independent second opinion (which is also the case if the patient is under age of consent).&lt;ref&gt;Care Quality Commission (2010) [http://www.cqc.org.uk/sites/default/files/documents/20120821_mha_ect_booklet_final.pdf ECT: Your rights about consent to treatment]&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is an exception regardless of consent and capacity; under Section 62 of the Act, if the treating psychiatrist says the need for treatment is urgent they may start a course of ECT without authorization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20140509205937/http://www.cqc.org.uk/sites/default/files/media/documents/20120821_mha_ect_booklet_final.pdf The Mental Health Act 1983 (updated version)] Part IV, Section 62. [[Care Quality Commission]]&lt;/ref&gt; From 2003 to 2005, about 2,000 people a year in England and Wales were treated without their consent under the Mental Health Act.&lt;ref&gt;The Mental Health Act Commission (2005) ''In Place of Fear? eleventh biennial report, 2003–2005'', 236. The Stationery Office.&lt;/ref&gt; Concerns have been raised by the official regulator that psychiatrists are too readily assuming that patients have the capacity to consent to their treatments, and that there is a worrying lack of independent [[advocacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cqc.org.uk/content/cqc-says-care-people-treated-under-mental-health-act-still-needs-improve | title=CQC says care for people treated under the Mental Health Act still needs to improve | website= | publisher=Care Quality Commission | date=8 December 2011 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cqc.org.uk%2Fcontent%2Fcqc-says-care-people-treated-under-mental-health-act-still-needs-improve&amp;date=2015-05-21 | archivedate=21 May 2015 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Scotland, the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003 also gives patients with capacity the right to refuse ECT.&lt;ref&gt;The Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003, Part 16, sections 237–239.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Public perception===
A questionnaire survey of 379 members of the general public in [[Australia]] indicated that more than 60% of respondents had some knowledge about the main aspects of ECT. Participants were generally opposed to the use of ECT on depressed individuals with psychosocial issues, on children, and on involuntary patients. Public perceptions of ECT were found to be mainly negative.&lt;ref name=Teh&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Teh | first1= S.P.C. | last2= Helmes | first2= E. | last3= Drake | first3= D. |year=2007 |url=http://isp.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/53/3/247 |title=A Western Australian Survey On Public Attitudes Toward and Knowledge of Electroconvulsive Therapy |journal= International Journal of Social Psychiatry |volume= 53 |issue= 3 |pages= 247–271 |doi= 10.1177/0020764006074522 | pmid= 17569409 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Resurgence====

Though ECT has become a widely discouraged treatment, many people have recently pushed for the return of this controversial procedure. The 1975 film ''One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'' has convinced viewers that ECT is a horrific procedure which only results in the patient's complete memory loss. Scientists have since debunked the notion that patients suffer acute memory loss after treatment, but the horrors of ECT present in the movie still remain a setback.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lilienfield|first1=Scott O.|title=The Truth About Shock Therapy|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-truth-about-shock-therapy/|website=Scientific American|accessdate=23 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the last decade, patients have returned to using ECT to treat various mental illnesses including depression and bipolar disorder. Overcoming the looming controversy has proven difficult for doctors and scientists, and various campaigns to challenge negative stereotypes have gained popularity in the past few years. In 2014, the American Psychiatric Association launched a petition to reclassify ECT as a low-risk treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Levin|first1=Saul, M.D., M.P.A.|last2=Binder|first2=Renée M.D.|title=Time Is Now to Support the ECT Reclassification Effort|url=https://www.psychiatry.org/news-room/apa-blogs/apa-blog/2016/01/time-is-now-to-support-the-ect-reclassification-effort|website=American Psychiatric Association|accessdate=23 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though many people still believe ECT to be an inhumane procedure, many pro-ECT patients have publicly come forward with their positive response to the treatment. One patient by the name of Shelley Miller claims that "medications have a success rate of 50-60% of patients getting better, while ECT succeeds at a rate of 70-90%."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Miller|first1=Shelley|title=Treating Mental Illness with Electroconvulsive Therapy|url=https://healthcare.utah.edu/healthfeed/postings/2017/02/ect.php|website=Health University of Utah|accessdate=23 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Famous cases====
{{Main|List of people who have undergone electroconvulsive therapy}}

[[Ernest Hemingway]], an American author, died by suicide shortly after ECT at the Mayo Clinic in 1961. He is reported to have said to his biographer, "Well, what is the sense of ruining my head and erasing my memory, which is my capital, and putting me out of business? It was a brilliant cure but we lost the patient...."&lt;ref&gt;[[A. E. Hotchner]], ''Papa Hemingway: A Personal Memoir'', {{ISBN|0-7867-0592-2}}; pg 280&lt;/ref&gt; American surgeon and award-winning author [[Sherwin B. Nuland]] is another notable person who has undergone ECT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ted.com/talks/sherwin_nuland_on_electroshock_therapy/transcript?language=en |title=Sherwin Nuland: How electroshock therapy changed me &amp;#124; Talk Subtitles and Transcript |publisher=TED.com |date= |accessdate=2015-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his 40s, this successful surgeon's depression became so severe that he had to be institutionalized. After exhausting all treatment options, a young resident assigned to his case suggested ECT, which ended up being successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/05/us/sherwin-b-nuland-author-who-challenged-concept-of-dignified-death-dies-at-83.html?_r=0 | title=Sherwin B.

Award-winning New Zealand author [[Janet Frame]] had ECT. She later wrote about this in her novel [[Faces in the Water]].

====Fictional examples====
Electroconvulsive therapy has been depicted in fiction, including fictional works partly based on true experiences. These include [[Sylvia Plath]]'s autobiographical novel, ''[[The Bell Jar]]'', Ken Loach's film [[Family Life (1971 British film)|Family Life]], and [[Ken Kesey]]'s novel ''[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (novel)|One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest]]''; Kesey's novel is a direct product of his time working the graveyard shift as an orderly at a mental health facility in Menlo Park, California.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| author = Kellner C.H. | year = 2013 | title = Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) in Literature: Sylvia Plath's The Bell Jar | url = | journal = Prog Brain Res. | volume = 206 | issue = | pages = 219–28 | doi = 10.1016/B978-0-444-63364-4.00029-6 | pmid = 24290484 | series = Progress in Brain Research | isbn = 9780444633644 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mitchell|Snyder|p=174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2000 film ''[[Requiem for a Dream]]'', Sarah Goldfarb receives "unmodified" electroconvulsive therapy after experiencing severe [[amphetamine psychosis]] following prolonged stimulant abuse. In the 2014 TV series ''[[Constantine (TV series)|Constantine]]'', the protagonist John Constantine is institutionalized and specifically requests electroconvulsive therapy as an attempt to alleviate or resolve his mental problems.

The musical ''[[Next to Normal]]'' centers around the family of a woman who undergoes the procedure.

[[Robert Pirsig]] suffered a nervous breakdown and spent time in and out of psychiatric hospitals between 1961 and 1963. He was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and clinical depression as a result of an evaluation conducted by psychoanalysts, and was treated with electroconvulsive therapy on numerous occasions, a treatment he discusses in his novel, ''[[Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance]]''.

In the HBO series ''[[Six Feet Under (TV series)|Six Feet Under]]'' season 5, George undergoes an ECT treatment to deal with his increasing paranoia. The depiction is shown realistically, with an actual ECT machine.

=== Gender ===
Throughout the history of ECT, women have received it two to three times as often as men.&lt;ref&gt;"Report of the Electro-convulsive Therapy Review Committee." Toronto: Electro-convulsive Therapy Review Committee, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, about 70 percent of ECT patients are women.&lt;ref name="Rudorfer"/&gt; This may be due to the fact that women are more likely to be diagnosed with depression.&lt;ref name="Rudorfer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Reid"/&gt; A 1974 study of ECT in Massachusetts reported that women made up 69 percent of those given ECT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Grosser G | year = 1975 | title = The Regulation of Electroshock Treatment in Massachusetts | url = | journal = Massachusetts Journal of Mental Health | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 12–25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ministry of Health in Canada reported that from 1999 until 2000 in the province of Ontario, women were 71 percent of those given ECT in provincial psychiatric institutions, and 75 percent of the total ECT given was given to women.&lt;ref&gt;Weitz, D. "Ontario Electroshock Statistics." Figures released under the Freedom of Information Act. Toronto: Ontario. Ministry of Health, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Young people===
ECT treatment of severely autistic children with violent, sometimes self-harming behaviour first began in parts of the US during the early years of 21st century. Each session reportedly alleviates symptoms for up to 10 days at a time, but it is not claimed as a cure. One practitioner, Charles Kellner, ECT director at [[Mount Sinai Hospital (Manhattan)|Mount Sinai Hospital]] in New York, is so convinced ECT is effective and safe that he allowed a parent to witness a procedure and the BBC to record the intervention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-39961472|title=Treating children with electroconvulsive therapy|author=Chris Rogers and Marshall Corwin|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation (New York)|date=2017-05-19|accessdate=2017-05-19|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Emergency management''' is the organization and management of the resources and responsibilities for dealing with all [[Humanitarianism|humanitarian]] aspects of [[Emergency|emergencies]] (preparedness, response, mitigation, and recovery). The aim is to reduce the harmful effects of all hazards, including [[disaster]]s.

The [[World Health Organization]] defines an emergency as the state in which normal procedures are interrupted, and immediate measures need to be taken to prevent that state turning into a disaster. Thus, emergency management is crucial to avoid the disruption transforming into a disaster, which is even harder to recover from. Emergency management is a related term but should not be equated to disaster management.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

==Emergency planning ideals==
{{Unreferenced section|date= March 2014}}
Emergency planning, a discipline of [[urban planning]] and [[urban design|design]], first aims to prevent emergencies from occurring, and failing that, should develop a good action plan to mitigate the results and effects of any emergencies. As time goes on, and more data become available, usually through the study of emergencies as they occur, a plan should evolve. The development of emergency plans is a cyclical process, common to many risk management disciplines, such as business continuity and security risk management, as set out below:

* Recognition or identification of risks&lt;ref&gt;Zhou, Q., Huang, W., &amp; Zhang, Y. (2011). Identifying critical success factors in emergency management using a fuzzy DEMATEL method. Safety science, 49(2), 243–252.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Ranking or evaluation of risks&lt;ref&gt;Hämäläinen, R. P., Lindstedt, M. R., &amp; Sinkko, K. (2000). Multiattribute risk analysis in nuclear emergency management. Risk Analysis, 20(4), 455–468.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Responding to significant risks
* Tolerating
* Treating
* Transferring
* Terminating
* Resourcing controls and planning
* Reaction planning
* Reporting and monitoring risk performance
* Reviewing the risk management framework

There are a number of guidelines and publications regarding emergency planning, published by professional organizations such as ASIS, National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), and the International Association of Emergency Managers (IAEM). There are very few emergency management specific standards, and emergency management as a discipline tends to fall under business resilience standards.

In order to avoid or reduce significant losses to a business, emergency managers should work to identify and anticipate potential risks. In the event that an emergency does occur, managers should have a plan prepared to mitigate the effects of that emergency, as well as to ensure business continuity of critical operations after the incident. It is essential for an organization to include procedures for determining whether an emergency situation has occurred and at what point an emergency management plan should be activated. An emergency plan must be regularly maintained, in a structured and methodical manner, to ensure it is up-to-date in the event of an emergency. Emergency managers generally follow a common process to anticipate, assess, prevent, prepare, respond and recover from an incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ready.gov/business/implementation/emergency|title=Emergency Response Plan - Ready.gov|website=www.ready.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Health and safety of workers ==
Cleanup during disaster recovery involves many [[occupational hazard]]s. Often these hazards are exacerbated by the conditions of the local environment as a result of the [[natural disaster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/OshDoc/cleanupHazard.html|title=Fact Sheet on Natural Disaster Recovery: Cleanup Hazard|website=www.osha.gov|language=EN-US|access-date=2017-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; While individual workers should be aware of these potential hazards, employers are responsible for minimizing exposure to these hazards and protecting workers, when possible. This includes identification and thorough assessment of potential hazards, application of appropriate [[personal protective equipment]] (PPE), and the distribution of other relevant information in order to enable safe performance of the work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/Publications/OSHA3698.pdf|title=OSHA Fact Sheet_Keeping Workers Safe During Disaster  Cleanup and Recovery|last=|first=|date=2017-11-27|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maintaining a safe and healthy environment for these workers ensures that the effectiveness of the disaster recovery is unaffected.

===  Physical exposures ===
'''Flood-associated injuries''': Flooding disasters often expose workers to trauma from sharp and blunt objects hidden under murky waters causing lacerations, as well as open and closed fractures. These injuries are further exacerbated with exposure to the often contaminated waters, leading to increased risk for infection.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bandino|first=Justin P.|last2=Hang|first2=Anna|last3=Norton|first3=Scott A.|title=The Infectious and Noninfectious Dermatological Consequences of Flooding: A Field Manual for the Responding Provider|url=https://link-springer-com.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/article/10.1007/s40257-015-0138-4|journal=American Journal of Clinical Dermatology|volume=16|issue=5|pages=399–424|doi=10.1007/s40257-015-0138-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; When working around water, there is always the risk of drowning. In addition, the risk of [[hypothermia]] significantly increases with prolonged exposure to water temperatures less than 75 degrees Fahrenheit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/emres/pe-workers.html#2|title=CDC - Hazard Based Guidelines: Protective Equipment for Workers in Hurricane Flood Response - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic|date=2017-09-13|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-infectious skin conditions may also occur including [[miliaria]], [[Immersion foot syndromes|immersion foot syndrome]] (including [[trench foot]]), and [[contact dermatitis]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Earthquake-associated injuries''': The predominant injuries are related to building structural components, including falling debris with possible [[crush injury]], trapped under rubble, [[burn]]s, and [[electric shock]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/dts/earthquakes/preparedness.html|title=Earthquake Preparedness and Response {{!}} Preparedness {{!}} Occupational Safety and Health Administration|website=www.osha.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chemical exposures ===

==== Hazardous material release ====

Chemicals can pose a risk to human health when exposed to humans at certain quantities. After a natural disaster, certain chemicals can be more prominent in the environment. These hazardous materials can be released directly or indirectly. Chemical hazards directly released after a natural disaster often occur concurrent with the event so little to no mitigation actions can take place for mitigation. For example, airborne magnesium, chloride, phosphorus, and ammonia can be generated by droughts. Dioxins can be produced by forest fires, and silica can be emitted by forest fires. Indirect release of hazardous chemicals can be intentionally released or unintentionally released. An example of intentional release is insecticides used after a flood or chlorine treatment of water after a flood. Unintentional release is when a hazardous chemical is not intentionally released. The chemical released is often toxic and serves beneficial purpose when released to the environment. These chemicals can be controlled through engineering to minimize their release when a natural disaster strikes. An example of this is agrochemicals from inundated storehouses or manufacturing facilities poisoning the floodwaters or asbestos fibers released from a building collapse during a hurricane.&lt;ref name="Young 3–20"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Young|first=Stacy|last2=Balluz|first2=Lina|last3=Malilay|first3=Josephine|date=2004-04-25|title=Natural and technologic hazardous material releases during and after natural disasters: a review|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969703004467|journal=Science of the Total Environment|volume=322|issue=1|pages=3–20|doi=10.1016/S0048-9697(03)00446-7|pmid=15081734}}&lt;/ref&gt; The flowchart to the right has been adopted from research performed by Stacy Young, et al., and can be found here.&lt;ref name="Young 3–20"/&gt;

'''Exposure routes'''

When a toxicant is prominent in an environment after a natural disaster, it is important to determine the route of exposure to worker safety for the disaster management workers. The three components are source of exposure, pathway of the chemical, and receptor. Questions to ask when dealing with chemical source is the material itself, how it’s used, how much is used, how often the chemical is used, temperature, vapor pressure, physical processes. The physical state of the chemical is important to identify. If working indoors, room ventilation, and volume of room needs to be noted to help mitigate health defects from the chemical. Lastly, to ensure worker safety, routes of entry for the chemical should be determined as well as relevant personal protective equipment needs to be worn.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Exposure Science in the 21st Century: A Vision and a Strategy|last=Council|first=National Research|date=2012-09-07|isbn=9780309264686|language=en|doi=10.17226/13507|pmid = 24901193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Respirators'''

According to the CDC, “If you need to collect belongings or do basic clean up in your previously flooded home, you do not usually need to use a respirator (a mask worn to prevent breathing in harmful substances).” A respirator should be worn when performing an operation in an enclosed environment such as a house that creates ample amounts of dust. These activities could include sweeping dust, using power saws and equipment, or cleaning up mold. If you encounter dust, the CDC says to “limit your contact with the dust as much as possible. Use wet mops or vacuums with HEPA filters instead of dry sweeping and lastly wear a respirator that protects against dust in the air. A respirator that is approved by the CDC/NIOSH is the N95 respirator and can be a good personal protective equipment to protect from dust and mold in the air from the associated natural disaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/disasters/disease/respiratory.html|title=Respiratory Protection for Residents Reentering Previously Flooded Areas{{!}}Health and Safety Concerns|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Biological exposures ===

'''Mold exposures''': Exposure to [[mold]] is commonly seen after a natural disaster such as flooding, hurricane, tornado or tsunami. Mold growth can occur on both the exterior and interior of residential or commercial buildings. Warm and humid condition encourages mold growth; therefore, standing water and excess moisture after a natural disaster would provide an ideal environment for mold growth especially in tropical regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/disasters/mold/|title=Mold - Natural Disasters and Severe Weather|date=8 December 2017|website=www.cdc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the exact number of mold species is unknown, some examples of commonly found indoor molds are [[Aspergillus]], [[Cladosporium]], [[Alternaria]] and [[Penicillium]]. Reaction to molds differ between individuals and can range from mild symptoms such as eye irritation, cough to severe life-threatening asthmatic or allergic reactions. People with history of [[chronic lung disease (disambiguation)|chronic lung disease]], asthma, allergy, other breathing problems or those that are [[immunocompromised]] could be more sensitive to molds and may develop [[fungal pneumonia]].

The most effective approach to control mold growth after a natural disaster is to control moisture level. Some ways to prevent mold growth after a natural disaster include opening all doors and windows, using fans to dry out the building, positioning fans to blow air out of the windows and cleaning up the building within the first 24–48 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/mold/ten-things-you-should-know-about-mold|title=Ten Things You Should Know about Mold - US EPA|first=US|last=EPA,OAR,ORIA,IED|website=US EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; All wet items that cannot be properly cleaned and dried within the first 48 hours should be promptly removed and discarded from the building. If mold growth is found in the building, it is important to concurrently remove the molds and fix the underlying moisture problem. When removing molds, N-95 masks or respirators with a higher protection level should be used to prevent inhalation of molds into the respiratory system.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2016-10/documents/moldguide12.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Molds can be removed from hard surfaces by soap and water, a diluted bleach solution&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/disasters/psa/moldremoval.html|title=Mold Removal After a Disaster-PSAs for Disasters|website=www.cdc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; or commercial products.

'''Human remains''': According to the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)|Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)]], "There is no direct risk of contagion or infectious disease from being near human remains for people who are not directly involved in recovery or other efforts that require handling dead bodies.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/disasters/handleremains.html|title=Handling Human Remains After a Disaster{{!}}Natural Disasters and Severe Weather|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most viruses and bacteria perish along with the human body after death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/hac/techguidance/ems/flood_cds/en/|title=WHO {{!}} Flooding and communicable diseases fact sheet|website=www.who.int|access-date=2017-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, no excessive measures are necessary when handling human remains indirectly. However, for workers in direct contact with human remains, [[universal precautions]] should be exercised in order to prevent unnecessary exposure to blood-borne viruses and bacteria. Relevant [[Personal protective equipment|PPE]] includes eye protection, face mask or shield, and gloves. The predominant health risk are gastrointestinal infections through [[Fecal–oral route|fecal-oral]] contamination, so [[Hand washing|hand hygiene]] is paramount to prevention. Mental health support should also be available to workers who endure [[psychological stress]] during and after recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/topics/disasters/index.aspx|title=American Psychological Association_Disasters|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091229124918/http://www.apa.org/topics/disasters/index.aspx|archive-date=2009-12-29|dead-url=yes|access-date=2017-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Flood-associated skin infections''': Flood waters are often contaminated with bacteria and waste as well as chemicals on occasion. Prolonged, direct contact with these waters leads to an increased risk for skin infection, especially with open wounds in the skin or history of a previous skin condition, such as [[atopic dermatitis]] or [[psoriasis]]. These infections are exacerbated with a compromised immune system or an aging population.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The most common bacterial skin infections are usually with [[Staphylococcus]] and [[Streptococcus]]. One of the most uncommon, but well-known bacterial infections is from [[Vibrio vulnificus]], which causes a rare, but often fatal infection called [[necrotizing fasciitis]]. 
[[File:Necrotizing fasciitis left leg debridement.JPEG|thumb|Surgical debridement of left leg necrotizing fasciitis.]]

Other salt-water Mycobacterium infections include the slow growing [[Mycobacterium marinum|M. marinum]] and fast growing [[Mycobacterium fortuitum|M. fortuitum]], [[Mycobacterium chelonae|M. chelonae]], and [[Mycobacterium abscessus|M. abscessus]]. Fresh-water bacterial infections include [[aeromonas hydrophila]], [[Burkholderia pseudomallei]] causing [[melioidosis]], [[leptospira interrogans]] causing [[leptospirosis]], and chromobacterium violaceum. Fungal infections may lead to [[chromoblastomycosis]], [[blastomycosis]], [[mucormycosis]], and [[dermatophytosis]]. Numerous other [[arthropod]], [[Protozoan infection|protozoal]], and [[Parasitic disease|parasitic]] infections have been described.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A worker can reduce the risk of flood-associated skin infections by avoiding the water if an open wound is present, or at minimum, cover the open wound with a waterproof bandage. Should contact with flood water occur, the open wound should be washed thoroughly with soap and clean water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/disasters/vibriovulnificus.html|title=Vibrio vulnificus{{!}}Natural Disasters and Severe Weather|date=2017-10-11|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychosocial exposures ===
Providing disaster recovery assistance is both rewarding and stressful. According to the CDC, "Sources of stress for emergency responders may include witnessing human suffering, risk of personal harm, intense workloads, life-and-death decisions, and separation from family."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://emergency.cdc.gov/coping/responders.asp|title=Emergency Responders: Tips for taking care of yourself|date=2017-11-07|website=emergency.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; These stresses need to be prevented or effectively managed in order to optimize assistance without causing danger to oneself. Preparation as an emergency responder is key, in addition to establishing care for responsibilities at home. During the recovery efforts, it is critical to understand and recognize burnout and sources of stress. After the recovery, it is vital to take time away from the disaster scene and slowly re-integrate back to the normal work environment. [[Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration|Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA)]] provides stress prevention and management resources for disaster recovery responders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.samhsa.gov/disaster-preparedness|title=Disaster Preparedness, Response, and Recovery|last=ann.lynsen|date=2014-06-20|website=www.samhsa.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Volunteer responsibilities ===
The [[FEMA|Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)]] advises those who desire to assist go through organized volunteer organizations and not to self-deploy to affected locations. The [[VOAD|National Volunteer Organizations Active in Disaster (VOAD)]] serves as the primary point of contact for volunteer organization coordination. All states have their own state VOAD organization. As a volunteer, since an employer does not have oversight, one must be vigilant and protect against possible physical, chemical, biological, and psychosocial exposures. Furthermore, there must be defined roles with relevant training available.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalservice.gov/resources/disaster-services/defining-volunteer-roles-preparation-disaster-response|title=Defining Volunteer Roles in Preparation for Disaster Response|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proper tools and PPE may or may not be available, so safety and liability should always be considered.

=== Employer responsibilities ===
Every employer is required to maintain a safe and healthy workplace for its employees. When an emergency situation occurs, employers are expected to protect workers from all harm resulting from any potential hazard, including physical, chemical, and biological exposure. In addition, an employer should provide pre-emergency training and build an emergency action plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/etools/hurricane/responsibilities.html|title=OSHA's Hazard Exposure and Risk Assessment Matrix for Hurricane Response and Recovery Work: Employer Responsibilities and Worker Rights|website=www.osha.gov|language=EN-US|access-date=2017-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Emergency action plan (EAP) ====
A written document about what actions employers and employees should take when responding to an emergency situation. According to OSHA regulations 1910.38,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_id=9726&amp;p_table=standards|title=Emergency action plans. – 1910.38 {{!}} Occupational Safety and Health Administration|website=www.osha.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; an employer must have an emergency action plan whenever an [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]] standard in this part requires one. To develop an emergency action plan, an employer should start from workplace evaluation. Typically, most of the occupational emergency management can be divided into worksite evaluation, exposure monitoring, hazard control, work practices, and training.

'''Worksite evaluation''' is about identifying the source and location of the potential hazards such as [[Falling (accident)|fall]], [[noise]], [[cold]], [[heat]], [[Hypoxia (environmental)|hypoxia]], infectious materials, and toxic chemicals that each of the workers may encounter during emergency situations.

===== Exposure monitoring =====
After identifying the source and location of the hazard(s), it is essential to monitor how employees may be exposed to these dangers. Employers should conduct task-specific exposure monitoring when they meet following requirements:
* When the exposed substance has specific standard required by OSHA
* When employers anticipate workers will be exposed to more hazards than the action level set by OSHA
* When there is a worker complaint or concern about the exposure
* When an employee questions the effectiveness of the existing hazard control methods
To effectively acquire the above information, an employer can ask workers how they perform the task or use direct reading instruments to identify the exposure level and exposure route.

===== Hazard control =====
Employers can conduct hazard control by:
* Elimination or substitution: Eliminating the hazard from the workplace.
* [[Engineering controls]]
* Work practice or administrative controls: Change the how the task was performed to reduce the probability of exposure.
* [[Personal protective equipment]]

===== Training =====
Employers should train their employees annually before an emergency action plan is implemented. [https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=STANDARDS&amp;p_id=9726&amp;p_text_version=FALSE#1910.38(f)(1) &lt;nowiki&gt;[29 CFR 1910.38(e)]&lt;/nowiki&gt;] The purpose of training is to inform employees of their responsibilities and/or plan of action during emergency situations. The training program should include the types of emergencies that may occur, the appropriate response, evacuation procedure, warning/reporting procedure, and shutdown procedures. Training requirements are different depending on the size of workplace and workforce, processes used, materials handled, available resources and who will be in charge during an emergency.

The training program should address the following information:
* Workers' roles and responsibilities.
* Potential hazards and hazard-preventing actions.
* Notification alarm system, and communications process&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=INTERPRETATIONS&amp;p_id=18960|title=08/07/1981 - Fire detection and employee alarm systems. {{!}} Occupational Safety and Health Administration|website=www.osha.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Communication means between family members in an emergency.
* [[First aid kit (disambiguation)|First Aid Kit]]
* Emergency response procedures.
* Evacuation procedures.
* A list of emergency equipment including its location and function.
* Emergency shutdown procedures.
After the emergency action plan is completed, employer and employees should review the plan carefully and post it in a public area that is accessible to everyone. In addition, another responsibility of the employer is to keep a record of any injury or illness of workers according to OSHA/State Plan Record-keeping regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=standards&amp;p_id=12783|title=Reporting fatalities, hospitalizations, amputations, and losses of an eye as a result of work-related incidents to OSHA. - 1904.39 {{!}} Occupational Safety and Health Administration|website=www.osha.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementation ideals==
{{Unreferenced section|date= March 2014}}

===Pre-incident training and testing===
[[File:Emergency Responders (8743399305).jpg|thumb|right|A team of emergency responders performs a training scenario involving [[anthrax]].]]
Emergency management plans and procedures should include the identification of appropriately trained staff members responsible for decision-making when an emergency occurs. Training plans should include internal people, contractors and civil protection partners, and should state the nature and frequency of training and testing.

Testing of a plan's effectiveness should occur regularly. In instances where several business or organisations occupy the same space, joint emergency plans, formally agreed to by all parties, should be put into place.

Drills and exercises in preparation for foreseeable hazards are often held, with the participation of the services that will be involved in handling the emergency, and people who will be affected. Drills are held to prepare for the hazards of [[Fire drill|fires]], [[Tornado drill|tornadoes]], [[lockdown]] for protection, [[earthquake]]s, etc.

===Communicating and incident assessment===
Communication is one of the key issues during any emergency, pre-planning of communications is critical. Miscommunication can easily result in emergency events escalating unnecessarily.

Once an emergency has been identified a comprehensive assessment evaluating the level of impact and its financial implications should be undertaken. Following assessment, the appropriate plan or response to be activated will depend on a specific pre-set criteria within the emergency plan. The steps necessary should be prioritized to ensure critical functions are operational as soon as possible. The critical functions are those that makes the plan untenable if not operationalized.

The communication policy must be well known and rehearsed, and all targeted audiences must be alert. All [[Emergency communication system|communication infrastructure]] must be as prepared as possible, with all information on groupings clearly identified.

==Phases and personal activities==
{{Refimprove section|date= March 2014}}
Emergency management consists of five phases: prevention, mitigation, preparedness, response and recovery. http://www.fema.gov/mission-areas

===Prevention===

It focuses on preventing the human hazard, primarily from potential natural disasters or terrorist attacks. Preventive measures are taken on both the domestic and international levels, designed to provide permanent protection from disasters. also by doing this the risk of loss of life and injury can be mitigated with good evacuation plans, environmental planning and design standards. In January 2005, 167 Governments adopted a 10-year global plan for natural disaster risk reduction called the [[World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction|Hyogo Framework]]. {{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

Preventing or reducing the impacts of disasters on our communities is a key focus for emergency management efforts today. Prevention and mitigation also help reduce the financial costs of disaster response and recovery. Public Safety Canada is working with provincial and territorial governments and stakeholders to promote disaster prevention and mitigation using a risk-based and all-hazards approach. In 2009, Federal/Provincial/Territorial Ministers endorsed a National Disaster Mitigation Strategy.

===Mitigation strategy===
Disaster mitigation measures are those that eliminate or reduce the impacts and risks of hazards through proactive measures taken before an emergency or disaster occurs.

Preventive or mitigation measures take different forms for different types of disasters. In earthquake prone areas, these preventive measures might include structural changes such as the installation of an [[earthquake valve]] to instantly shut off the natural gas supply, [[seismic retrofit]]s of property, and the securing of items inside a building. The latter may include the mounting of furniture, [[refrigerator]]s, [[water heater]]s and breakables to the walls, and the addition of cabinet latches. In flood prone areas, houses can be built on poles/stilts. In areas prone to prolonged electricity [[power blackout|black-outs]] installation of a [[electrical generator|generator]] ensures continuation of electrical service. The construction of [[storm cellar]]s and [[fallout shelter]]s are further examples of personal mitigative actions.

On a national level, governments might implement large scale mitigation measures. After the monsoon floods of 2010, the Punjab government subsequently constructed 22 'disaster-resilient' model villages, comprising 1885 single-storey homes, together with schools and health centres.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cdkn.org/2013/12/news-pakistans-punjab-builds-model-villages-to-withstand-disasters/?loclang=en_gb ''NEWS: Pakistan's Punjab builds model villages to withstand disasters''], [[Climate &amp; Development Knowledge Network]], 17 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the best known examples of investment in disaster mitigation is the Red River Floodway. The building of the Floodway was a joint provincial/federal undertaking to protect the City of Winnipeg and reduce the impact of flooding in the Red River Basin. It cost $62.7 million to build in the 1960s. Since then, the floodway has been used over 20 times. Its use during the 1997 Red River Flood alone saved an estimated $4.5 billion in costs from potential damage to the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iclr.org/images/2000_September_FridayForum.pdf|title=Flood Mitigation Efforts in the Red River Basin|last=Simonovic|first=Slobodan|date=|website=www.iclr.org|publisher=The Institute of Catastrophic Loss Reduction|access-date=20 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161023195652/https://www.iclr.org/images/2000_September_FridayForum.pdf|archive-date=2016-10-23|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Floodway was expanded in 2006 as a joint provincial/federal initiative.

===Preparedness===
[[File:Panther 8x8 action 15x10.jpg|thumb|An airport emergency preparedness exercise]]
Preparedness focuses on preparing equipment and procedures for use when a [[disaster]] occurs. This equipment and these procedures can be used to reduce vulnerability to disaster, to mitigate the impacts of a disaster or to respond more efficiently in an [[emergency]]. The [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA) has set out a basic four-stage vision of preparedness flowing from mitigation to preparedness to response to recovery and back to mitigation in a circular planning process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://training.fema.gov/emiweb/downloads/is10_unit3.doc |title=Animals in Disasters |publisher=Training.fema.gov |accessdate=2015-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; This circular, overlapping model has been modified by other agencies, taught in emergency class and discussed in academic papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.memphis.edu/ifti/pdfs/cait_phases_of_emergency_mngt.pdf|format=PDF|author= Baird, Malcolm E.|date=2010|title=''The "Phases" of Emergency Management|publisher=Vanderbilt Center for Transportation Research|accessdate=2015-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FEMA also operates a Building Science Branch that develops and produces multi-hazard mitigation guidance that focuses on creating disaster-resilient communities to reduce loss of life and property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fema.gov/building-science|title=Building Science|work=fema.gov|accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
FEMA advises citizens to prepare their homes with some emergency essentials in the case that the food distribution lines are interrupted. FEMA has subsequently prepared for this contingency by purchasing hundreds of thousands of freeze dried food emergency meals ready to eat (MRE's) to dispense to the communities where emergency shelter and evacuations are implemented.

Some guidelines for household preparedness have been put online by the State of Colorado, on the topics of water, food, tools, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Personal Plan|url=https://www.readycolorado.com/plan/personal-plan|website=READY Colorado|publisher=State of Colorado|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150325233906/https://www.readycolorado.com/plan/personal-plan|archivedate=March 25, 2015|deadurl=yes|access-date=March 1, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Emergency preparedness can be difficult to measure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/occasional_papers/2008/RAND_OP234.pdf |format=PDF |title=Rand Homeland Security |publisher=Rand.org |accessdate=2015-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; CDC focuses on evaluating the effectiveness of its public health efforts through a variety of measurement and assessment programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/phpr/documents/phep_bp1_pm_specifications_and_implementation_guidance_v1_1.pdf |format=PDF |title=Public Health Emergency Preparedness Cooperative Agreement |publisher=Cdc.gov |accessdate=2015-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Local Emergency Planning Committees===
[[Local Emergency Planning Committee]]s (LEPCs) are required by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] under the [[Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act]] to develop an emergency response plan, review the plan at least annually, and provide information about chemicals in the community to local citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://www2.epa.gov/epcra/local-emergency-planning-committee |title=US Environmental Protection Agency &amp;#124; US EPA |publisher=.epa.gov |date=2015-01-28 |accessdate=2015-03-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20150309184727/http://www2.epa.gov/epcra/local-emergency-planning-committee |archivedate=2015-03-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This emergency preparedness effort focuses on hazards presented by use and storage of extremely hazardous and toxic chemicals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2013-08/documents/epcra_fact_sheet.pdf |format=PDF |title=The Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act |publisher=Epa.gov |accessdate=2015-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Particular requirements of LEPCs include

* Identification of facilities and transportation routes of extremely hazardous substances
* Description of emergency response procedures, on and off site
* Designation of a community coordinator and facility emergency coordinator(s) to implement the plan
* Outline of emergency notification procedures
* Description of how to determine the probable affected area and population by releases
* Description of local emergency equipment and facilities and the persons responsible for them
* Outline of evacuation plans
* A training program for emergency responders (including schedules)
* Methods and schedules for exercising emergency response plans

According to the EPA, "Many LEPCs have expanded their activities beyond the requirements of EPCRA, encouraging accident prevention and risk reduction, and addressing homeland security in their communities", and the Agency offers advice on how to evaluate the effectiveness of these committees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2013-08/documents/measuring_progress_lepc.pdf |format=PDF |title=Masuring Progress in Chemical Safety : A Guide for Local Emergency Planning Committees and Similar Groups |publisher=Epa.gov |accessdate=2015-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Preparedness measures===
{{cuic|subset=section|wording=trivial|all=yes|date=June 2017}}
Preparedness measures can take many forms ranging from focusing on individual people, locations or incidents to broader, government-based "all hazard" planning.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fema.gov/pdf/plan/slg101.pdf ''Guide for All-Hazard Emergency Operations Planning September 1996''&lt;/ref&gt; There are a number of preparedness stages between "all hazard" and individual planning, generally involving some combination of both mitigation and response planning. Business continuity planning encourages businesses to have a [[Disaster Recovery Plan]]. Community- and faith-based organizations mitigation efforts promote field response teams and inter-agency planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fema.gov/media-library-data/20130726-1445-20490-8956/cbo_studentguide.pdf |format=PDF |title=Community-Based Pre-Disaster Mitigation |publisher=Fema.gov |accessdate=2015-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Classroom Response Kit.JPG|thumb|Classroom response kit]]School-based response teams cover everything from live shooters to gas leaks and nearby bank robberies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.ahrq.gov/prep/schoolprep/schoolprep.pdf |format=PDF |title=School-Based Emergency preparedness : A National analysis and recommended Protocol |publisher=Archive.ahrq.gov |accessdate=2015-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Educational institutions plan for cyberattacks and windstorms.&lt;ref&gt;AHRQ Publication No. 09-0013 January 2009 ''UMass System Office Hazard Mitigation Plan Draft (December 2013)''&lt;/ref&gt; Industry specific guidance exists for horse farms,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehorse.com/articles/34929/horse-farm-disaster-preparedness |title=Horse Farm Disaster Preparedness |publisher=TheHorse.com |date=2014-11-26 |accessdate=2015-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; boat owners&lt;ref&gt;[http://disaster.ifas.ufl.edu/PDFS/CHAP07/DPR-0718-web.pdf] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141121155605/http://disaster.ifas.ufl.edu/PDFS/CHAP07/DPR-0718-web.pdf |date=November 21, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and more.

Family preparedness for disaster is fairly unusual. A 2013 survey found that only 19% of American families felt that they were "very prepared" for a disaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/08/27/living/parents-emergency-preparedness-ad/ |title=Your family's emergency kit is probably a disaster |publisher=Cnn.com |accessdate=2015-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, there are many resources available for family disaster planning. The [[Department of Homeland Security]]'s Ready.gov page includes a Family Emergency Plan Checklist,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ready.gov/sites/default/files/documents/files/Family_Emegency_Plan.pdf |format=PDF |title=Family Emergency Plan |publisher=Ready.gov |accessdate=2015-03-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150226002107/http://www.ready.gov/sites/default/files/documents/files/Family_Emegency_Plan.pdf |archivedate=2015-02-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; has a whole webpage devoted to readiness for kids, complete with cartoon-style superheroes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ready.gov/kids |title=Home |publisher=Ready.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ran a Thunderclap Campaign in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thunderclap.it/projects/7587-resolve-to-be-ready-in-2014 |title=Thunderclap: Resolve to be Ready in 2014! |publisher=Thunderclap.it |date=2013-12-18 |accessdate=2015-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Center for Disease Control]] has a Zombie Apocalypse website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://blogs.cdc.gov/publichealthmatters/2011/05/preparedness-101-zombie-apocalypse/ |title=Preparedness 101: Zombie Apocalypse &amp;#124; Public Health Matters Blog &amp;#124; Blogs &amp;#124; CDC |publisher=Blogs.cdc.gov |date=2011-05-16 |accessdate=2015-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kitchen Fire Extinguisher.JPG|thumb|Kitchen fire extinguisher]]Disasters take a variety of forms to include [[earthquakes]], [[tsunamis]] or regular [[structure fires]]. That a disaster or emergency is not large scale in terms of population or acreage impacted or duration does not make it any less of a disaster for the people or area impacted and much can be learned about preparedness from so-called small disasters.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wup.wi.tum.de/fileadmin/w00beh/www/Files/Wagner_Learning_from_small_disasters.pdf] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217200624/https://www.wup.wi.tum.de/fileadmin/w00beh/www/Files/Wagner_Learning_from_small_disasters.pdf |date=December 17, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Red Cross states that it responds to nearly 70,000 disasters a year, the most common of which is a single family fire.&lt;ref name="akamai1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://a1881.g.akamai.net/f/1881/26640/1440m/redcross.download.akamai.com/26640/training/dmhovrvw/dmhovrvw/index01.htm |title=Disaster Mental Health : Introduction |publisher=a1881.g.akamai.net |accessdate=2015-03-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20150310182724/http://a1881.g.akamai.net/f/1881/26640/1440m/redcross.download.akamai.com/26640/training/dmhovrvw/dmhovrvw/index01.htm |archivedate=2015-03-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Items on Shelves in Basement.JPG|thumb|Items on shelves in basement]]

Preparedness starts with an individual's [[everyday life]] and involves items and training that would be useful in an emergency. What is useful in an emergency is often also useful in everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.travelinsurancereview.net/tips-and-advice/travel-safety-tips/everyday-objects-for-travel-disaster-survival/ |title=Everyday Objects for Travel Disaster Survival |publisher=Travel Insurance Review |date= |accessdate=2015-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; From personal preparedness, preparedness continues on a continuum through family preparedness, community preparedness and then business, non-profit and governmental preparedness. Some organizations blend these various levels. For example, the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement]] has a webpage on disaster training&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redcross.org/take-a-class/disaster-training|title=Disaster Training|work=redcross.org|accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as offering training on basic preparedness such as [[Cardiopulmonary resuscitation]] and [[First Aid]]. Other non-profits such as [[Team Rubicon]] bring specific groups of people into disaster preparedness and response operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teamrubiconusa.org/programs/|title=Program Ops|work=Disaster Response Veterans Service Organization - Team Rubicon|accessdate=8 March 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150315105712/http://www.teamrubiconusa.org/programs/|archivedate=15 March 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; FEMA breaks down preparedness into a pyramid, with citizens on the foundational bottom, on top of which rests local government, state government and federal government in that order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fema.gov/media-library-data/20130726-1549-20490-4325/why_prepare.pdf |format=PDF |title=Why Prepare |publisher=Fema.gov |accessdate=2015-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Non Perishable Food in cabinet.JPG|thumb|Non-perishable food in cabinet]]The basic theme behind preparedness is to be ready for an emergency and there are a number of different variations of being ready based on an assessment of what sort of threats exist. Nonetheless, there is basic guidance for preparedness that is common despite an area's specific dangers. FEMA recommends that everyone have a three-day survival kit for their household.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fema.gov/pdf/areyouready/basic_preparedness.pdf |format=PDF |title=Basic Preparedness |publisher=Fema.gov |accessdate=2015-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because individual household sizes and specific needs might vary, FEMA's recommendations are not item specific, but the list includes:
* Three-day supply of non-perishable food.
* Three-day supply of water – one gallon of water per person, per day.
* Portable, battery-powered radio or television and extra batteries.
* Flashlight and extra batteries.
* First aid kit and manual.
* [[Sanitation]] and [[hygiene]] items (e.g. [[toilet paper]], [[Feminine hygiene|menstrual hygiene products]]).
* Matches and waterproof container.
* Whistle.
* Extra clothing.
* Kitchen accessories and cooking utensils, including a can opener.
* Photocopies of credit and identification cards.
* Cash and coins.
* Special needs items, such as prescription medications, eyeglasses, contact lens solutions, and hearing aid batteries.
* Items for infants, such as formula, diapers, bottles, and pacifiers.
* Other items to meet unique family needs.

Along similar lines, but not exactly the same, CDC has its own list for a proper disaster supply kit.&lt;ref name="emergency.cdc.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://emergency.cdc.gov/preparedness/kit/disasters/ |title=CDC Emergency preparedness and You &amp;#124; Gather Emergency Supplies &amp;#124; Disaster Supplies Kit |publisher=Emergency.cdc.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Water—one gallon per person, per day
* Food—nonperishable, easy-to-prepare items
* Flashlight
* Battery powered or hand crank radio (NOAA Weather Radio, if possible)
* Extra batteries
* First aid kit
* Medications (7-day supply), other medical supplies, and medical paperwork (e.g., medication list and pertinent medical information)
* Multipurpose tool (e.g., Swiss army knife)
* Sanitation and personal hygiene items
* Copies of personal documents (e.g., proof of address, deed/lease to home, passports, birth certificates, and insurance policies)
* Cell phone with chargers
* Family and emergency contact information
* Extra cash
* Emergency blanket
* Map(s) of the area
* Extra set of car keys and house keys
* Manual can opener

Children are a special population when considering Emergency preparedness and many resources are directly focused on supporting them. SAMHSA has list of tips for talking to children during infectious disease outbreaks, to include being a good listener, encouraging children to ask questions and modeling self-care by setting routines, eating healthy meals, getting enough sleep and taking deep breaths to handle stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://store.samhsa.gov/shin/content/SMA14-4886/SMA14-4886.pdf |format=PDF |title=Talking With Children |publisher=Store.samhsa.gov |accessdate=2015-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; FEMA has similar advice, noting that "Disasters can leave children feeling frightened, confused, and insecure" whether a child has experienced it first hand, had it happen to a friend or simply saw it on television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fema.gov/coping-disaster#4 |title=Coping with Disaster |publisher=FEMA.gov |date=2015-01-31 |accessdate=2015-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same publication, FEMA further notes, "Preparing for disaster helps everyone in the family accept the fact that disasters do happen, and provides an opportunity to identify and collect the resources needed to meet basic needs after disaster. Preparation helps; when people feel prepared, they cope better and so do children."

To help people assess what threats might be in order to augment their emergency supplies or improve their disaster response skills, FEMA has published a booklet called the "Threat and Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment Guide."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fema.gov/media-library-data/8ca0a9e54dc8b037a55b402b2a269e94/CPG201_htirag_2nd_edition.pdf |format=PDF |title=Threat and Hazrd Identification and Risk Assessment Guide |date=August 2013 |publisher=Fema.gov |accessdate=2015-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; (THIRA) This guide, which outlines the THIRA process, emphasizes "whole community involvement," not just governmental agencies, in preparedness efforts. In this guide, FEMA breaks down hazards into three categories: Natural, technological and human caused and notes that each hazard should be assessed for both its likelihood and its significance. According to FEMA, "Communities should consider only those threats and hazards that could plausibly occur" and "Communities should consider only those threats and hazards that would have a significant effect on them." To develop threat and hazard context descriptions, communities should take into account the time, place, and conditions in which threats or hazards might occur.

Not all preparedness efforts and discussions involve the government or established NGOs like the Red Cross. Emergency preparation discussions are active on the internet, with many blogs and websites dedicated to discussing various aspects of preparedness. On-line sales of items such as survival food, medical supplies and heirloom seeds allow people to stock basements with cases of food and drinks with 25 year shelf lives, sophisticated medical kits and seeds that are guaranteed to sprout even after years of storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mypatriotsupply.com/ |title=My Patriot Supply : Homepage |publisher=Mypatriotsupply.com |accessdate=2015-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One group of people who put a lot of effort in disaster preparations is called [[Doomsday Preppers]]. This subset of preparedness-minded people often share a belief that the FEMA or Red Cross emergency preparation suggestions and training are not extensive enough. Sometimes called [[survivalists]], Doomsday Preppers are often preparing for The End Of The World As We Know It, abbreviated as TEOTWAWKI. With a motto some have that "The Future Belongs to those who Prepare," this Preparedness subset has its own set of Murphy's Rules,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://survivalcache.com/murphys-laws-of-teotwawki/ |title=Murphy's Laws of TEOTWAWKI |publisher=Survivalcache.com |date=2010-11-16 |accessdate=2015-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; including "Rule Number 1: Food, you still don't have enough" and "Rule Number 26: People who thought the Government would save them, found out that it didn't."

Not all emergency preparation efforts revolve around food, guns and shelters, though these items help address the needs in the bottom two sections of [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs]]. The American Preppers Network&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americanpreppersnetwork.com/|title=American Preppers Network - National family survival and preparedness organization|work=American Preppers Network|accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; has an extensive list of items that might be useful in less apparent ways than a first aid kid or help add 'fun' to challenging times. These items include:
* Books and magazines
* Arts and crafts  [[painting]]
* Children's entertainment
* Crayons and coloring books
* Notebooks and writing supplies
* Nuts, bolts, screws, nails, etc.
* Religious material
* Sporting equipment, card games and board games
* Posters and banners creating awareness

Emergency preparedness goes beyond immediate family members. For many people, pets are an integral part of their families and emergency preparation advice includes them as well. It is not unknown for pet owners to die while trying to rescue their pets from a fire or from drowning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.pottsmerc.com/general-news/20140308/man-dies-trying-to-rescue-pets-from-fire |title=Man dies trying to rescue pets from fire |publisher=Pottsmerc.com |date= |accessdate=2015-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; CDC's Disaster Supply Checklist for Pets includes:&lt;ref name="emergency.cdc.gov"/&gt;
* Food and water for at least 3 days for each pet; bowls, and a manual can opener.
* Depending on the pet you may need a litter box, paper towels, plastic trash bags, grooming items, and/or household bleach.
* Medications and medical records stored in a waterproof container.
* First aid kit with a pet first aid book.
* Sturdy leash, harness, and carrier to transport pet safely. A carrier should be large enough for the animal to stand comfortably, turn around, and lie down. Your pet may have to stay in the carrier for several hours.
* Pet toys and the pet's bed, if you can easily take it, to reduce stress.
* Current photos and descriptions of your pets to help others identify them in case you and your pets become separated, and to prove that they are yours.
* Information on feeding schedules, medical conditions, behavior problems, and the name and telephone number of your veterinarian in case you have to board your pets or place them in foster care.

Emergency preparedness also includes more than physical items and skill-specific training. Psychological preparedness is also a type of emergency preparedness and specific mental health preparedness resources are offered for mental health professionals by organizations such as the Red Cross.&lt;ref name="akamai1"/&gt; These mental health preparedness resources are designed to support both community members affected by a disaster and the disaster workers serving them. CDC has a website devoted to coping with a disaster or traumatic event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.samhsa.gov/MentalHealth/TraumaticEvent.aspx?from=carousel&amp;position=1&amp;date=3112011 |title=Coping with Traumatic Events, SAMHSA.gov |publisher=Media.samhsa.gov |date=2011-08-25 |accessdate=2015-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; After such an event, the CDC, through the [[Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration]] (SAMHSA), suggests that people seek psychological help when they exhibit symptoms such as excessive worry, crying frequently, an increase in irritability, anger, and frequent arguing, wanting to be alone most of the time, feeling anxious or fearful, overwhelmed by sadness, confused, having trouble thinking clearly and concentrating, and difficulty making decisions, increased alcohol and/or substance use, increased physical (aches, pains) complaints such as headaches and trouble with "nerves."

Sometimes emergency supplies are kept in what is called a [[Bug-out bag]]. While FEMA does not actually use the term "Bug out bag," calling it instead some variation of a "Go Kit," the idea of having emergency items in a quickly accessible place is common to both FEMA and CDC, though on-line discussions of what items a "bug out bag" should include sometimes cover items such as firearms and great knives that are not specifically suggested by FEMA or CDC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theprepperproject.com/bug-out-bag-checklist/ |title=Bug Out Bag Checklist |publisher=Theprepperproject.com |date=2013-04-18 |accessdate=2015-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory behind a "bug out bag" is that emergency preparations should include the possibility of [[Emergency evacuation]]. Whether fleeing a burning building or hastily packing a car to escape an impending hurricane, flood or dangerous chemical release, rapid departure from a home or workplace environment is always a possibility and FEMA suggests having a Family Emergency Plan for such occasions.&lt;ref name="ready.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ready.gov/make-a-plan |title=Make A Plan |publisher=Ready.gov |date=2014-01-29 |accessdate=2015-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because family members may not be together when disaster strikes, this plan should include reliable contact information for friends or relatives who live outside of what would be the disaster area for household members to notify they are safe or otherwise communicate with each other. Along with the contact information, FEMA suggests having well-understood local gathering points if a house must be evacuated quickly to avoid the dangers of re-reentering a burning home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usfa.fema.gov/downloads/pdf/publications/fa-246f.pdf |format=PDF |title=Escape From Fire! |publisher=Usfa.fema.gov |accessdate=2015-03-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151210211816/https://www.usfa.fema.gov/downloads/pdf/publications/fa-246f.pdf |archivedate=2015-12-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Family and emergency contact information should be printed on cards and put in each family member's backpack or wallet. If family members spend a significant amount of time in a specific location, such as at work or school, FEMA suggests learning the emergency preparation plans for those places.&lt;ref name="ready.gov"/&gt; FEMA has a specific form, in English and in Spanish, to help people put together these emergency plans, though it lacks lines for email contact information.&lt;ref name="ready.gov"/&gt;

Like children, people with disabilities and other special needs have special emergency preparation needs. While "disability" has a specific meaning for specific organizations such as collecting [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] benefits,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ssdrc.com/disabilityquestions3-24.html |title=Who Will Qualify For Disability? - What Qualifying Is Based On |publisher=Ssdrc.com |date= |accessdate=2015-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the purposes of emergency preparedness, the Red Cross uses the term in a broader sense to include people with physical, medical, sensor or cognitive disabilities or the elderly and other special needs populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redcross.org/images/MEDIA_CustomProductCatalog/m4240199_A4497.pdf |format=PDF |title=Preparing for Disaster for People with Disabilities and other Special Needs |publisher=Redcross.org |accessdate=2015-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the particular disability, specific emergency preparations might be required. FEMA's suggestions for people with disabilities includes having copies of prescriptions, charging devices for medical devices such as motorized wheel chairs and a week's supply of medication readily available LINK or in a "go stay kit."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150211090322/http://www.fema.gov/media-library-data/1390849866881-33d608585d1e0e55ff6fbbb1ad6f4765/ready_Disabilities_R-6_2014.pdf] (archived link, February 11, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; In some instances, lack of competency in English may lead to special preparation requirements and communication efforts for both individuals and responders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/oem/downloads/pdf/household_guide.pdf |format=PDF |title=Ready New York : Preparing for Emergencies in new York City |publisher=Nyc.com |accessdate=2015-03-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714034558/http://www.nyc.gov/html/oem/downloads/pdf/household_guide.pdf |archive-date=2014-07-14 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

FEMA notes that long term power outages can cause damage beyond the original disaster that can be mitigated with emergency generators or other power sources to provide an [[Emergency power system]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fema.gov/media-library-data/20130726-1627-20490-0643/how2022_generator_04_11_r1.pdf |format=PDF |title=Install a Generator for Emergency Power |publisher=Fema.gov |accessdate=2015-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Department of Energy]] states that 'homeowners, business owners, and local leaders may have to take an active role in dealing with energy disruptions on their own."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://energy.gov/oe/services/energy-assurance/emergency-preparedness/community-guidelines-energy-emergencies |title=Community Guidelines for Energy Emergencies &amp;#124; Department of Energy |publisher=Energy.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; This active role may include installing or other procuring generators that are either portable or permanently mounted and run on fuels such as propane or natural gas&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.generac.com/for-homeowners/home-backup-power|title=Generac Home Backup Power - Home &amp; Portable Generator - Generac Power Systems|author=Generac Power Systems, Inc|work=generac.com|accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; or gasoline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.homedepot.com/p/Duromax-RV-Grade-4-400-Watt-7-0-HP-Gasoline-Powered-Portable-Generator-with-Wheel-Kit-XP4400/203729601?cm_mmc=shopping-_-googleads-_-pla-_-203729601&amp;ci_sku=203729601&amp;ci_gpa=pla&amp;ci_src=17588969&amp;gclid=CjwKEAiA1-CjBRDOhIr_-vPDvQYSJAB48SmEB3KwgOovb3JMid9Ekc7UF9NTttvbW3QPl-sVK0UWmBoCaRLw_wcB|title=Duromax RV Grade 4,400-Watt 7.0 HP Gasoline Powered Portable Generator with Wheel Kit-XP4400 - The Home Depot|author=|date=15 October 2014|work=The Home Depot|accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concerns about carbon monoxide poisoning, electrocution, flooding, fuel storage and fire lead even small property owners to consider professional installation and maintenance.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; Major institutions like hospitals, military bases and educational institutions often have or are considering extensive backup power systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.burnsmcd.com/Resource_/PressRelease/2894/FileUpload/White-Paper-Microgrid-Effects-Opportunities-for-Utilities-031113.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209154259/http://www.burnsmcd.com/Resource_/PressRelease/2894/FileUpload/White-Paper-Microgrid-Effects-Opportunities-for-Utilities-031113.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2014-02-09 |format=PDF |title=Microgrid Effects and Opportunities for Utilities |publisher=Burnsmcd.com |accessdate=2015-03-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of, or in addition to, fuel-based power systems, solar, wind and other alternative power sources may be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://householdpowergenerator.com/2013/08/18/alternative-energy-sources-for-homes-during-emergencies/ |title=Alternative Energy Sources For Homes During Emergencies |publisher=House Hold Power Generator |date=2013-08-18 |accessdate=2015-03-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150113130112/http://householdpowergenerator.com/2013/08/18/alternative-energy-sources-for-homes-during-emergencies/ |archivedate=2015-01-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Standalone batteries, large or small, are also used to provide backup charging for electrical systems and devices ranging from emergency lights to computers to cell phones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crutchfield.com/p_79723000/Goal-Zero-Yeti-400.html?tp=61022|title=Goal Zero Yeti 400|work=Crutchfield|accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Items specific to an emergency include:
* Jumper cables: might want to include flares or reflective triangle
* Flashlights, to include extra batteries (batteries have less power in colder weather)
* First Aid Kit, to include any necessary medications, baby formula and diapers if caring for small children
* Non-perishable food such as canned food (be alert to liquids freezing in colder weather), and protein rich foods like nuts and energy bars
* Manual can opener
* At least 1 gallon of water per person a day for at least 3 days (be alert to hazards of frozen water and resultant container rupture)
* Basic toolkit: pliers, wrench, screwdriver
* Pet supplies: food and water
* Radio: battery or hand cranked
* For snowy areas: cat litter or sand for better tire traction; shovel; ice scraper; warm clothes, gloves, hat, sturdy boots, jacket and an extra change of clothes
* Blankets or sleeping bags
* Charged Cell Phone: and car charger

In addition to emergency supplies and training for various situations, FEMA offers advice on how to mitigate disasters. The Agency gives instructions on how to retrofit a home to minimize hazards from a [[Flood]], to include installing a [[Backflow prevention device]], anchoring fuel tanks and relocating electrical panels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fema.gov/media-library-data/1404148604102-f210b5e43aba0fb393443fe7ae9cd953/FEMA_P-312.pdf |format=PDF |title=Homeowner's Guide to Retrofitting |publisher=Fema.gov |accessdate=2015-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Marked gas shuttoff.JPG|thumb|Marked gas shuttoff]]
Given the explosive danger posed by [[natural gas]] leaks, Ready.gov states unequivocally that "It is vital that all household members know how to shut off natural gas" and that property owners must ensure they have any special tools needed for their particular gas hookups. Ready.gov also notes that "It is wise to teach all responsible household members where and how to shut off the electricity," cautioning that individual circuits should be shut off before the main circuit. Ready.gov further states that "It is vital that all household members learn how to shut off the water at the main house valve" and cautions that the possibility that rusty valves might require replacement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ready.gov/utility-shut-safety |title=Utility Shut-off &amp; Safety |publisher=Ready.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Response===
{{Main|Disaster response}}

The response phase of an emergency may commence with [[Search and Rescue]] but in all cases the focus will quickly turn to fulfilling the basic [[humanitarian]] [[basic needs|needs]] of the affected population. This assistance may be provided by national or international agencies and organizations. Effective coordination of disaster assistance is often crucial, particularly when many organizations respond and local emergency management agency (LEMA) capacity has been exceeded by the demand or diminished by the disaster itself. The [[National Response Framework]] is a United States government publication that explains responsibilities and expectations of government officials at the local, state, federal, and tribal levels. It provides guidance on Emergency Support Functions that may be integrated in whole or parts to aid in the response and recovery process.

On a personal level the response can take the shape either of a ''[[shelter in place]]'' or an ''[[Emergency evacuation|evacuation]]''. [[File:Evacuation sign.jpg|thumb|Evacuation sign]]In a shelter-in-place scenario, a family would be prepared to fend for themselves in their home for many days without any form of outside support. In an ''evacuation'', a family leaves the area by [[automobile]] or other mode of [[transportation]], taking with them the maximum amount of supplies they can carry, possibly including a tent for shelter. If mechanical transportation is not available, evacuation on foot would ideally include carrying at least three days of supplies and rain-tight bedding, a [[tarpaulin]] and a bedroll of blankets.

[[Donation]]s are often sought during this period, especially for large disasters that overwhelm local capacity. Due to efficiencies of scale, [[money]] is often the most cost-effective donation if fraud is avoided. Money is also the most flexible, and if goods are sourced locally then transportation is minimized and the local economy is boosted. Some donors prefer to send [[gifts in kind]], however these items can end up creating issues, rather than helping. One innovation by [[Occupy Sandy]] volunteers is to use a donation registry, where families and businesses impacted by the disaster can make specific requests, which remote donors can purchase directly via a web site.

Medical considerations will vary greatly based on the type of disaster and secondary effects. Survivors may sustain a multitude of injuries to include [[lacerations]], [[burn]]s, [[near drowning]], or [[crush syndrome]].

===Recovery===
The recovery phase starts after the immediate threat to human life has subsided. The immediate goal of the recovery phase is to bring the affected area back to normalcy as quickly as possible. During reconstruction it is recommended to consider the location or construction material of the property.

The most extreme home confinement scenarios include war, [[famine]] and severe [[epidemic]]s and may last a year or more. Then recovery will take place inside the home. Planners for these events usually buy [[bulk purchasing|bulk]] foods and appropriate storage and preparation equipment, and eat the food as part of normal life. A simple balanced diet can be constructed from [[vitamin]] pills, [[whole-meal]] wheat, beans, [[dried milk]], corn, and [[cooking oil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fema.gov/ |title=Federal Emergency Management Agency |publisher=FEMA.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vegetables, fruits, spices and meats, both prepared and fresh-gardened, are included when possible.

== As a profession==
{{Refimprove section|date= March 2014}}
Professional emergency managers can focus on government and community preparedness, or private business preparedness. Training is provided by local, state, federal and private organizations and ranges from public information and media relations to high-level incident command and tactical skills.

In the past, the field of emergency management has been populated mostly by people with a military or first responder background. Currently, the field has become more diverse, with many managers coming from a variety of backgrounds other than the military or first responder fields. Educational opportunities are increasing for those seeking undergraduate and graduate degrees in emergency management or a related field. There are over 180 schools in the US with emergency management-related programs, but only one doctoral program specifically in emergency management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Professional certifications such as Certified Emergency Manager (CEM)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iaem.com/certification/generalinfo/intro.htm |title=Certification-General CEM certification Info |publisher=Iaem.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Certified Business Continuity Professional (CBCP)&lt;ref name="drii.org"&gt;Disaster Recovery Institute International. https://drii.org/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Best Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery Certifications. Tom's IT Pro. http://www.tomsitpro.com/articles/business-continuity-disaster-recovery-certifications,2-766-4.html&lt;/ref&gt; are becoming more common as professional standards are raised throughout the field, particularly in the United States. There are also professional organizations for emergency managers, such as the National Emergency Management Association and the International Association of Emergency Managers.

===Principles===
In 2007, Dr. Wayne Blanchard of FEMA's Emergency Management Higher Education Project, at the direction of Dr. Cortez Lawrence, Superintendent of FEMA's Emergency Management Institute, convened a working group of emergency management practitioners and academics to consider principles of emergency management. This was the first time the principles of the discipline were to be codified. The group agreed on eight principles that will be used to guide the development of a doctrine of emergency management. Below is a summary:

# Comprehensive – consider and take into account all hazards, all phases, all stakeholders and all impacts relevant to disasters.
# Progressive – anticipate future disasters and take preventive and preparatory measures to build disaster-resistant and disaster-resilient communities.
# Risk-driven – use sound risk management principles (hazard identification, risk analysis, and impact analysis) in assigning priorities and resources.
# Integrated – ensure [[unity of effort]] among all levels of government and all elements of a community.
# Collaborative – create and sustain broad and sincere relationships among individuals and organizations to encourage trust, advocate a team atmosphere, build consensus, and facilitate communication.
# Coordinated – synchronize the activities of all relevant stakeholders to achieve a common purpose.
# Flexible – use creative and innovative approaches in solving disaster challenges.
# Professional – value a science and knowledge-based approach; based on education, training, experience, ethical practice, public stewardship and continuous improvement.

A fuller description of these principles can be found at&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ndsu.edu/fileadmin/emgt/PrinciplesofEmergencyManagement.pdf |format=PDF |title=Principles of Emergency Management Supplement |date=2007-09-11 |accessdate=2015-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tools===
In recent years the continuity feature of emergency management has resulted in a new concept, [[Emergency Management Information System]]s (EMIS). For continuity and inter-operability between emergency management stakeholders, EMIS supports an infrastructure that integrates emergency plans at all levels of government and non-government involvement for all four phases of emergencies. In the healthcare field, hospitals utilize the [[Hospital Incident Command System]] (HICS), which provides structure and organization in a clearly defined chain of command.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

[[File:Rockefeller University Disaster Plan.jpg|thumb|A disaster plan book at [[Rockefeller University]] in a biochemistry research laboratory.]]
Practitioners in emergency management come from an increasing variety of backgrounds. Professionals from [[memory institution]]s (e.g., museums, historical societies, etc.) are dedicated to preserving cultural heritage—objects and records. This has been an increasingly major component within this field as a result of the heightened awareness following the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001, the [[2005 Atlantic hurricane season|hurricanes in 2005]], and the [[Historical Archive of the City of Cologne|collapse of the Cologne Archives]].

To increase the potential successful recovery of valuable records, a well-established and thoroughly tested plan must be developed. This plan should emphasize simplicity in order to aid in response and recovery: employees should perform similar tasks in the response and recovery phase that they perform under normal conditions. It should also include mitigation strategies such as the installation of sprinklers within the institution.&lt;ref&gt;Buchanan, Sally. "Emergency preparedness." from Paul Banks and Roberta Pilette. ''Preservation Issues and Planning''. Chicago: American Library Association, 2000. 159–165. {{ISBN|978-0-8389-0776-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professional associations hold regular workshops to keep individuals up to date with tools and resources in order to minimize risk and maximize recovery.&lt;ref name="drii.org"/&gt;

===Other tools===
In 2008, the [[U.S. Agency for International Development]] created a web-based tool for estimating populations impacted by disasters. Called Population Explorer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.populationexplorer.com/ |title=FEWS Network&amp;nbsp;— USAID |publisher=Population Explorer |date= |accessdate=2012-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; the tool uses land scan population data, developed by [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]], to distribute population at a resolution 1&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for all countries in the world. Used by USAID's [[Famine Early Warning System Network|FEWS NET]] Project to estimate populations vulnerable and or imd by food insecurity, Population Explorer is gaining wide use in a range of emergency analysis and response actions, including estimating populations impacted by floods in Central America and the Pacific Ocean tsunami event in 2009.

In 2007, a checklist for veterinarians was published in the Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association, it had two sets of questions for a professional to ask themselves before assisting with an emergency:

'''Absolute requirements for participation:'''
* Have I chosen to participate?
* Have I taken ICS training?
* Have I taken other required background courses?
* Have I made arrangements with my practice to deploy?
* Have I made arrangements with my family?

'''Incident participation:'''
* Have I been invited to participate?
* Are my skill sets a match for the mission?
* Can I access just-in-time training to refresh skills or acquire needed new skills?
* Is this a self-support mission?
* Do I have supplies needed for three to five days of self-support?

While written for veterinarians, this checklist is applicable for any professional to consider before assisting with an emergency.&lt;ref&gt;The Veterinary profession's duty of care in response to disasters and food animal emergencies.

===The International Emergency Management Society===
[[The International Emergency Management Society]] (TIEMS), is an international non-profit NGO, registered in Belgium. TIEMS is a Global Forum for Education, Training, Certification and Policy in Emergency and Disaster Management. TIEMS' goal is to develop and bring modern emergency management tools, and techniques into practice, through the exchange of information, methodology innovations and new technologies.

TIEMS provides a platform for stakeholders to meet, network and learn about new technical and operational methodologies. TIEMS focuses on cultural differences to be understood and included in the society's events, education and research programs. This is achieved by establishing local chapters worldwide. Today, TIEMS has chapters in Benelux, Romania, Finland, Italy, Middle East and North Africa (MENA), Iraq, India, Korea, Japan and China.

===International Association of Emergency Managers===
The [[International Association of Emergency Managers]] (IAEM) is a non-profit educational organization aimed at promoting the goals of saving lives and property protection during emergencies. The mission of IAEM is to serve its members by providing information, networking and professional opportunities, and to advance the emergency management profession.

It has seven councils around the world: Asia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iaem.com/about/membership/Regions/IAEMAsia/IAEMAsia.htm |title=IAEMAsia |publisher=Iaem.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canada,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iaem.com/about/membership/regions/Region13.htm |title=Region 13 |publisher=Iaem.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Europa,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iaem.com/regions/iaemeuropa/ |title=IAEM Europa |publisher=Iaem.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; International,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iaem.com/about/membership/regions/internationalregion/intregion.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-10-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051018125748/http://www.iaem.com/about/membership/Regions/InternationalRegion/intregion.htm |archivedate=2005-10-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Oceania,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iaem.com/about/membership/regions/IAEMOceania/IAEMOceania.htm |title=IAEM Oceania |publisher=Iaem.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Student&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iaem.com/about/membership/regions/studentregion/studentregion.htm |title=Welcome to IAEM.COM- International Association of Emergency Managers |publisher=Iaem.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iaem.com/Councils/IAEM-USA.htm |title=Iaem-Usa |publisher=Iaem.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Air Force Emergency Management Association, affiliated by membership with the IAEM, provides emergency management information and networking for [[U.S. Air Force Emergency Management]] personnel.

===International Recovery Platform===
The International Recovery Platform (IRP) was conceived at the World Conference on Disaster Reduction (WCDR) in Kobe, Hyogo, Japan in January 2005, as part of the ''Hyogo Framework for Action (HFA) 2005–2015''. The HFA is a global plan for disaster risk reduction adopted by 168 governments.

The key role of IRP is to identify gaps in post disaster recovery and to serve as a catalyst for the development of tools and resources for recovery efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.recoveryplatform.org/ |title=Welcome to the International Recovery Platform — International Recovery Platform |publisher=Recoveryplatform.org |date= |accessdate=2015-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement===
The [[International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies]] (IFRC) works closely with National Red Cross and Red Crescent societies in responding to emergencies, many times playing a pivotal role. In addition, the IFRC may deploy assessment teams, e.g. Field Assessment and Coordination Teams (FACT),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifrc.org/en/what-we-do/disaster-management/responding/disaster-response-system/dr-tools-and-systems/responding-to-disasters-field-assessment-coordination-teams-fact/ |title=Field Assessment Coordination Teams (FACT) |publisher=IFRC |date=2011-10-15 |accessdate=2012-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the affected country if requested by the national society. After assessing the needs, [[Emergency Response Unit]]s (ERUs)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifrc.org/what/disasters/responding/drs/tools/eru.asp |title=Emergency Response Units (ERUs) |publisher=IFRC |date=2011-10-15 |accessdate=2012-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; may be deployed to the affected country or region. They are specialized in the response component of the emergency management framework.

===Baptist Global Response===
Baptist Global Response (BGR) is a disaster relief and community development organization. BGR and its partners respond globally to people with critical needs worldwide, whether those needs arise from chronic conditions or acute crises such as natural disasters. While BGR is not an official entity of the [[Southern Baptist Convention]], it is rooted in Southern Baptist life and is the international partnership of Southern Baptist Disaster Relief teams, which operate primarily in the US and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://gobgr.org/about/about |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-08-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150812153654/https://gobgr.org/about/about |archivedate=2015-08-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Nations===
The [[United Nations]] system rests with the Resident Coordinator within the affected country. However, in practice, the UN response will be coordinated by the UN [[Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs]] (UN-OCHA), by deploying a [[UN Disaster Assessment and Coordination]] (UNDAC) team, in response to a request by the affected country's government. Finally [[UN-SPIDER]] designed as a networking hub to support disaster management by application of satellite technology&lt;ref&gt;UN-SPIDER - United Nations - Space-based information for Disaster Management and Emergency Response - established 2007 - Knowledge Portal - http://www.un-spider.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

===World Bank===
Since 1980, the [[World Bank]] has approved more than 500 projects related to disaster management, dealing with both disaster mitigation as well as reconstruction projects, amounting to more than US$40 billion. These projects have taken place all over the world, in countries such as Argentina, Bangladesh, Colombia, Haiti, India, Mexico, Turkey and Vietnam.&lt;ref name="worldbank1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTURBANDEVELOPMENT/EXTDISMGMT/0,,contentMDK:20196209~menuPK:341042~pagePK:148956~piPK:216618~theSitePK:341015,00.html |title=Disaster Risk Management - Projects |publisher=Web.worldbank.org |date=2004-04-28 |accessdate=2015-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="worldbank1"/&gt;

Prevention and mitigation projects include forest fire prevention measures, such as early warning measures and education campaigns; early-warning systems for hurricanes; flood prevention mechanisms (e.g. shore protection, terracing, etc.); and earthquake-prone construction.&lt;ref name="worldbank1"/&gt; In a joint venture with [[Columbia University]] under the umbrella of the [[ProVention Consortium]] the World Bank has established a Global Risk Analysis of Natural Disaster Hotspots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/chrr/research/hotspots/coredata.html |title=Core Data Sets |publisher=Ldeo.columbia.edu |accessdate=2015-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2006, the World Bank, in response to the HFA, established the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR), a partnership with other aid donors to reduce disaster losses. GFDRR helps developing countries fund development projects and programs that enhance local capacities for disaster prevention and emergency preparedness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gfdrr.org/index.cfm?Page=home&amp;ItemID=200 |accessdate=March 25, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080423231412/http://gfdrr.org/index.cfm?Page=home&amp;ItemID=200 |archivedate=April 23, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===European Union===
In 2001 the EU adopted Community Mechanism for Civil Protection, to facilitate co-operation in the event of major emergencies requiring urgent response actions. This also applies to situations where there may be an imminent threat as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Boin | first1 = A. | last2 = Rhinard | first2 = M. | title = Managing Transboundary Crises: What Role for the European Union? | journal = International Studies Review | volume = 10 | pages = 1–26 | year = 2008 | pmid = | pmc = | doi = 10.1111/j.1468-2486.2008.00745.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The heart of the Mechanism is the Monitoring and Information Center (MIC), part of the European Commission's Directorate-General for Humanitarian Aid &amp; Civil Protection. Accessible 24 hours a day, it gives countries access to a one-stop-shop of civil protections available amongst all the participating states. Any country inside or outside the Union affected by a major disaster can make an appeal for assistance through the MIC. It acts as a communication hub, and provides useful and updated information on the actual status of an ongoing emergency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/echo/civil_protection/civil/prote/mechanism.htm |title=Civil Protection&amp;nbsp;– The Community mechanism for civil protection |publisher=Ec.europa.eu |accessdate=2010-07-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527063208/http://ec.europa.eu/echo/civil_protection/civil/prote/mechanism.htm |archivedate=2010-05-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australia's emergency management processes embrace the concept of the prepared community. The principal government agency in achieving this is [[Emergency Management Australia]].

===Canada===
[[Public Safety Canada]] is Canada's national emergency management agency. Each province is required to have both legislation for dealing with emergencies, and provincial emergency management agencies, typically called "Emergency Measures Organizations" (EMO). Public Safety Canada co-ordinates and supports the efforts of federal organizations as well as other levels of government, first responders, community groups, the private sector, and other nations. The Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness Act defines the powers, duties and functions of PS are outlined. Other acts are specific to individual fields such as corrections, law enforcement, and national security.

===Germany===
In [[Germany]] the Federal Government controls the German ''Katastrophenschutz'' (disaster relief), the [[Technisches Hilfswerk]] (''Federal Agency for Technical Relief'', THW), and the ''Zivilschutz'' ([[Civil defense|civil protection]]) programs coordinated by the ''Federal Office of Civil Protection and Disaster Assistance''. Local [[German fire department|fire department]] units, the German Armed Forces ([[Bundeswehr]]), the [[German Federal Police]] and the 16 state police forces (Länderpolizei) are also deployed during disaster relief operations.

There are several private organizations in Germany that also deal with emergency relief. Among these are the German Red Cross, [[Johanniter-Unfall-Hilfe]] (the German equivalent of the St. John Ambulance), the Malteser-Hilfsdienst, and the [[Arbeiter-Samariter-Bund Deutschland|Arbeiter-Samariter-Bund]]. As of 2006, there is a program of study at the University of Bonn leading to the degree "Master in Disaster Prevention and Risk Governance"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Marc Jansen |url=http://www.kavoma.de |title=Startseite des Studiengangs Katastrophenvorsorge und -management |publisher=Kavoma.de |date=2010-06-29 |accessdate=2010-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a support function [[radio amateurs]] provide additional emergency communication networks with frequent trainings.

The [[National Disaster Management Authority (India)|National Disaster Management Authority]] is the primary government agency responsible for planning and capacity-building for disaster relief. Its emphasis is primarily on strategic risk management and mitigation, as well as developing policies and planning.&lt;ref name="ndma-functions"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ndma.gov.in/en/about-ndma/roles-responsibilities.html|title=Functions and Responsibilities|publisher=National Disaster Management Authority|accessdate=2014-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Institute of Disaster Management]] is a policy think-tank and training institution for developing guidelines and training programs for mitigating disasters and managing crisis response.

The [[National Disaster Response Force]] is the government agency primarily responsible for emergency management during [[natural disaster|natural]] and [[man-made disasters]], with specialized skills in search, rescue and rehabilitation.&lt;ref name=about&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|url=http://ndrfandcd.gov.in/CMS/AboutUs.aspx|publisher=National Disaster Response Force|accessdate=2015-01-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141029102440/http://ndrfandcd.gov.in/CMS/AboutUs.aspx|archive-date=2014-10-29|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ministry of Science and Technology also contains an agency that brings the expertise of earth scientists and meteorologists to emergency management. The [[Indian Armed Forces]] also plays an important role in the rescue/recovery operations after disasters.

[[Aniruddha's Academy of Disaster Management]] (AADM) is a non-profit organization in Mumbai, India with 'disaster management' as its principal objective.

===Malaysia===
In [[Malaysia]], The National Disaster Management Agency (NADMA Malaysia) under the Prime Minister's Department was established on 2 October 2015 following the Flood Disaster in 2014 and taken over the roles previously National Security Council. NADMA Malaysia is the focal point in managing disaster in Malaysia. [[Ministry of Home Affairs Malaysia]], [[Ministry of Health Malaysia]] and [[Ministry of Housing, Urban Wellbeing and Local Government Malaysia]] are also having responsibility in managing emergency. Several agencies are involved in emergency managements are [[Royal Malaysian Police]], [[Malaysian Fire and Rescue Department]], [[Malaysian Civil Defence Force]], [[Ministry of Health Malaysia]] and [[Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency]]. There were also some voluntary organisation who involved themselves in emergency/ disaster management such as [[St. John Ambulance of Malaysia]], [[Malaysian Red Crescent Society]] and so on.

=== Nepal ===
The Nepal Risk Reduction Consortium (NRRC) is based on hyogo Framework and Nepal's National Strategy for Disaster Risk Management. This arrangement unites humanitarian and development partners with Government of Nepal and had identified 5 flagship priorities for sustainable disaster risk management.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://drrportal.gov.np/|title=Nepal Disaster Risk Reduction Portal, Kathmandu, Nepal|last=|first=|date=|website=Government of Nepal|access-date=21 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New Zealand ===
In [[New Zealand]], depending on the scope of the emergency/disaster, responsibility may be handled at either the local or national level. Within each region, local governments are organized into 16 [[Civil Defence Emergency Management Group]]s (CMGs). If local arrangements are overwhelmed, pre-existing mutual-support arrangements are activated. Central government has the authority to coordinate the response through the [[National Crisis Management Centre]] (NCMC), operated by the [[Ministry of Civil Defence &amp; Emergency Management (New Zealand)|Ministry of Civil Defence &amp; Emergency Management]] (MCDEM). These structures are defined by regulation,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.govt.nz/regulation/public/2005/0295/latest/DLM356569.html National Civil Defence Emergency Plan Order 2005]. Legislation.govt.nz (2008-10-01). Retrieved on 2011-07-28.&lt;/ref&gt; and explained in ''The Guide to the National Civil Defence Emergency Management Plan 2006'', roughly equivalent to the U.S. [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]]'s [[National Response Framework]].

New Zealand uses unique terminology for emergency management. Emergency management is rarely used, many government publications retaining the use of the term civil defence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beehive.govt.nz/portfolio/civil+defence?page=1 |title=Civil Defence |publisher=beehive.govt.nz |date= |accessdate=2015-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reservebank.govt.nz/crisismgmt/] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080810101655/http://www.reservebank.govt.nz/crisismgmt/ |date=August 10, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.msd.govt.nz/search?q=civil+defence&amp;output=xml_no_dtd&amp;proxystylesheet=prod_msd&amp;client=prod_msd&amp;site=prod_msd|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120714111216/http://search.msd.govt.nz/search?q=civil+defence&amp;output=xml_no_dtd&amp;proxystylesheet=prod_msd&amp;client=prod_msd&amp;site=prod_msd|deadurl=yes|title=Search Results: civil defence|date=14 July 2012|archivedate=14 July 2012|website=archive.is}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the Minister of Civil Defence is responsible for the MCDEM.

===Pakistan===
Disaster management in [[Pakistan]] revolves around flood disasters focusing on rescue and relief.

[[Federal Flood Commission]] was established in 1977 under [[Ministry of Water and Power (Pakistan)|Ministry of Water and Power]] to manage the issues of flood management on country-wide basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ffc.gov.pk/histry.aspx|title=Office of Chief Engineering Adviser/Chairman Federal Flood Commission, Islamabad |website=www.ffc.gov.pk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Disaster Management Ordinance, 2006]] and [[National Disaster Management Act, 2010]] were enacted after [[2005 Kashmir earthquake]] and [[2010 Pakistan floods]] respectively to deal with disaster management.  
The primary central authority mandated to deal with whole spectrum of disasters and their management in the country is [[National Disaster Management Authority (Pakistan)|National Disaster Management Authority]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ndma.gov.pk/aboutUs.php|title=NDMA National Disaster Management Authority Pakistan: About Us|website=www.ndma.gov.pk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition each [[Province of Pakistan|province]] along with [[FATA Disaster Management Authority|FATA]], [[Gilgit Baltistan Disaster Management Authority|Gilgit Baltistan]] and [[State Disaster Management Authority (Azad Jammu &amp; Kashmir)|Pakistani administered Kashmir]] has its own provincial disaster management authority responsible for implementing policies and plans for Disaster Management in the Province.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ndma.gov.pk/pdma.php|title=NDMA National Disaster Management Authority Pakistan: Provincial Disaster Management Authority |website=www.ndma.gov.pk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philippines===
In the [[Philippines]], the [[National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council]] is responsible for the protection and welfare of people during disasters or emergencies. It is a working group composed of various government, non-government, civil sector and private sector organizations of the Government of the Republic of the Philippines. Headed by the Secretary of National Defense (under the Office of Civil Defense, the NDRRMCs implementing organization), it coordinates all the executive branches of government, presidents of the leagues of local government units throughout the country, the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines]], [[Philippine National Police]], [[Bureau of Fire Protection]] (which is an agency under the [[Department of Interior and Local Government]], and the public and private medical services in responding to natural and manmade disasters, as well as planning, coordination, and training of these responsible units. Non-governmental organizations such as the [[Philippine Red Cross]] also provide manpower and material support for NDRRMC.

Regional, provincial, city, municipal, and barangay emergency management are handled by Local Disaster Risk Reduction Management Councils (LDRRMCs), which are the functional arm of the local government unit (LGU). Each LDRRMC is headed by a Chief DRRM Officer, and each Office is tasked to organize their own emergency teams and command-and-control centers when activated at times of local emergencies (identified on the regional, provincial, city, municipal, and/or barangay level).

===Russia===
In [[Russia]], the [[Ministry of Emergency Situations (Russia)|Ministry of Emergency Situations]] (EMERCOM) is engaged in [[fire fighting]], [[civil defense]], and [[search and rescue]] after both natural and human-made disasters.

===Somalia===
In [[Somalia]], the [[Federal Government of Somalia|Federal Government]] announced in May 2013 that the [[Somali Council of Ministers|Cabinet]] had approved draft legislation on a new [[Somali Disaster Management Agency]] (SDMA), which had originally been proposed by the Ministry of Interior. According to the Prime Minister's Media Office, the SDMA will lead and coordinate the government's response to various natural disasters. It is part of a broader effort by the federal authorities to re-establish national institutions. The [[Federal Parliament of Somalia|Federal Parliament]] is now expected to deliberate on the proposed bill for endorsement after any amendments.&lt;ref name="Rsp Mcfp Tel"&gt;{{cite news |last=Prime Minister's Media Office |title=SOMALIA: Prime Minister calls for parliament to enact legislation as Cabinet moves to establish disaster management agency |url=http://www.raxanreeb.com/2013/05/somalia-prime-minister-calls-for-parliament-to-enact-legislation-as-cabinet-moves-to-establish-disaster-management-agency/ |accessdate=5 June 2013 |newspaper=Raxanreeb |date=30 May 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130608200154/http://www.raxanreeb.com/2013/05/somalia-prime-minister-calls-for-parliament-to-enact-legislation-as-cabinet-moves-to-establish-disaster-management-agency/ |archivedate=8 June 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Netherlands===
In the [[Netherlands]] the [[Ministry of Security and Justice (Netherlands)|Ministry of Security and Justice]] is responsible for emergency preparedness and emergency management on a national level and operates a national crisis centre (NCC). The country is divided into 25 safety regions ([[w:nl:veiligheidsregio|veiligheidsregio]]). In a safety region, there are four components: the regional fire department, the regional department for medical care(ambulances and psycho-sociological care etc.), the regional dispatch and a section for risk- and crisis management. The regional dispatch operates for police, fire department and the regional medical care. The dispatch has all these three services combined into one dispatch for the best multi-coordinated response to an incident or an emergency. And also facilitates in information management, emergency communication and care of citizens. These services are the main structure for a response to an emergency. It can happen that, for a specific emergency, the co-operation with an other service is needed, for instance the [[Ministry of Defence (Netherlands)|Ministry of Defence]], [[water board]](s) or [[Rijkswaterstaat]]. The veiligheidsregio can integrate these other services into their structure by adding them to specific conferences on operational or administrative level.

All regions operate according to the [[Coordinated Regional Incident Management (Netherlands)|Coordinated Regional Incident Management]] system.

===United Kingdom===
Following the 2000 [[UK fuel protests|fuel protests]] and severe flooding that same year, as well as the [[2001 United Kingdom foot-and-mouth crisis|foot-and-mouth]] crisis in 2001, the [[United Kingdom]] passed the [[Civil Contingencies Act 2004]] (CCA). The CCA defined some organisations as Category 1 and 2 Responders, setting responsibilities regarding emergency preparedness and response. It is managed by the [[Civil Contingencies Secretariat]] through Regional Resilience Forums and local authorities.

Disaster Management training is generally conducted at the local level, and consolidated through professional courses that can be taken at the [[Emergency Planning College]]. Diplomas, undergraduate and postgraduate qualifications can be gained at universities throughout the country. The Institute of Emergency Management is a charity, established in 1996, providing consulting services for the government, media and commercial sectors. There are a number of professional societies for Emergency Planners including the Emergency Planning Society&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the-eps.org/ |title=Welcome – The Emergency Planning Society |publisher=The-eps.org |date= |accessdate=2015-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Institute of Civil Protection and Emergency Management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icpem.net/ |title=Institute of Civil Protection &amp; Emergency Management &amp;#124; Welcome |publisher=ICPEM |date=2014-04-03 |accessdate=2015-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the largest emergency exercises in the UK was carried out on 20 May 2007 near [[Belfast]], [[Northern Ireland]]: a simulated plane crash-landing at [[Belfast International Airport]].

Disaster management in the United States has utilized the functional All-Hazards approach for over 20 years, in which managers develop processes (such as communication &amp; warning or sheltering) rather than developing single-hazard or threat focused plans (e.g., a tornado plan). Processes are then mapped to specific hazards or threats, with the manager looking for gaps, overlaps, and conflicts between processes.

Given these notions, emergency managers must identify, contemplate, and assess possible man-made threats and natural threats that may affect their respective locales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McElreath|first1=David|last2=Doss|first2=Daniel|last3=Jensen|first3=Carl|last4=Wigginton|first4=Michael|last5=Nations|first5=Robert|last6=Van Slyke|first6=Jeffrey|last7=Nations|first7=Julie|title=Foundations of Emergency Management|date=2014|publisher=Kendall-Hunt Publishing Company|location=Dubuque, IA|isbn=978-1465234889|page=25|edition=1st}}&lt;!--|accessdate=31 July 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Because of geographical differences throughout the nation, a variety of different threats affect communities among the states. Thus, although similarities may exist, no two emergency plans will be completely identical. Additionally, each locale has different resources and capacities (e.g., budgets, personnel, equipment, etc.) for dealing with emergencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Doss|first1=Daniel|last2=Glover|first2=William|last3=Goz|first3=Rebecca|last4=Wigginton|first4=Michael|title=The Foundations of Communication in Criminal Justice Systems|date=2015|publisher=CRC Press|location=Boca Raton, Florida|isbn=978-1482236576|page=301}}&lt;!--|accessdate=31 July 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Each individual community must craft its own unique emergency plan that addresses potential threats that are specific to the locality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Doss|first1=Daniel|last2=Glover|first2=William|last3=Goza|first3=Rebecca|last4=Wigginton|first4=Michael|title=The Foundations of Communication in Criminal Justice Systems|date=2015|publisher=CRC Press|location=Boca Raton, Florida|isbn=978-1482236576|page=301|edition=1}}&lt;!--|accessdate=31 July 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

This creates a plan more resilient to unique events because all common processes are defined, and it encourages planning done by the stakeholders who are closer to the individual processes, such as a traffic management plan written by a public works director. This type of planning can lead to conflict with non-emergency management regulatory bodies, which require the development of hazard/threat specific plans, such as the development of specific H1N1 flu plans and terrorism-specific plans.

In the United States, all disasters are initially local, with local authorities, with usually a police, fire, or EMS agency, taking charge. Many local municipalities may also have a separate dedicated [[office of emergency management]] (OEM), along with personnel and equipment. If the event becomes overwhelming to the local government, state emergency management (the primary government structure of the United States) becomes the controlling emergency management agency. [[Federal Emergency Management Agency of the United States|Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA), part of the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]] (DHS), is the lead federal agency for emergency management. The United States and its territories are broken down into ten regions for FEMA's emergency management purposes. FEMA supports, but does not override, state authority.

The [[Citizen Corps]] is an organization of volunteer service programs, administered locally and coordinated nationally by DHS, which seek to mitigate disasters and prepare the population for emergency response through public education, training, and outreach. Most [[disaster response]] is carried out by volunteer organizations. In the US, the [[American Red Cross|Red Cross]] is chartered by Congress to coordinate disaster response services. It is typically the lead agency handling shelter and feeding of evacuees. Religious organizations, with their ability to provide volunteers quickly, are usually integral during the response process. The largest being the [[Salvation Army]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://disaster.salvationarmyusa.org/ |title=The Salvation Army Emergency Disaster Services |publisher=Disaster.salvationarmyusa.org |date= |accessdate=2015-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a primary focus on chaplaincy and rebuilding, and [[Southern Baptists]] who focus on food preparation and distribution,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.namb.net/activity-report/ |title=2012 Activity Report |publisher=Namb.net |date= |accessdate=2015-03-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150113135407/http://www.namb.net/activity-report/ |archivedate=2015-01-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as cleaning up after floods and fires, chaplaincy, mobile shower units, chainsaw crews and more. With over 65,000 trained volunteers, Southern Baptist Disaster Relief is one of the largest disaster relief organizations in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baptistrelief.org/Our_Work/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-08-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130611221453/http://www.baptistrelief.org/Our_Work/ |archivedate=2013-06-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar services are also provided by Methodist Relief Services, the Lutherans, and [[Samaritan's Purse]]. Unaffiliated volunteers show up at most large disasters. To prevent abuse by criminals, and for the safety of the volunteers, procedures have been implemented within most response agencies to manage and effectively use these 'SUVs' ([[Spontaneous Unaffiliated Volunteers]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.citizencorps.gov/downloads/pdf/ManagingSpontaneousVolunteers.pdf |title=Citizen Corps &amp;#124; Ready.gov |publisher=Citizencorps.gov |date=2013-07-23 |accessdate=2013-08-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130223174827/https://www.citizencorps.gov/downloads/pdf/ManagingSpontaneousVolunteers.pdf |archive-date=2013-02-23 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The US Congress established the [[Center for Excellence in Disaster Management and Humanitarian Assistance]] (COE) as the principal agency to promote disaster preparedness in the Asia-Pacific region.

The National Tribal Emergency Management Council (NEMC) is a non-profit educational organization developed for Tribal organizations to share information and best practices, as well as to discuss issues regarding public health and safety, emergency management and homeland security, affecting those under Indian sovereignty. NTMC is organized into Regions, based on the FEMA 10 region system. NTMC was founded by the Northwest Tribal Emergency Management Council (NWTEMC), a consortium of 29 Tribal Nations and Villages in Washington, Idaho, Oregon, and Alaska.

If a disaster or emergency is declared to be terror related or an "Incident of National Significance," the Secretary of Homeland Security will initiate the [[National Response Framework]] (NRF). The NRF allows the integration of federal resources with local, country, state, or tribal entities, with management of those resources to be handled at the lowest possible level, utilizing the [[National Incident Management System]] (NIMS).

The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] offer [https://www.emergency.cdc.gov/hazards-specific.asp information] for specific types of emergencies, such as disease outbreaks, natural disasters and severe weather, chemical and radiation accidents, etc. The [https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/emres/ Emergency Preparedness and Response Program] of the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] develops resources to address responder safety and health during responder and recovery operations.

The Emergency Management Institute (EMI) serves as the national focal point for the development and delivery of emergency management [[training]] to enhance the capabilities of [[state government|state]], territorial, [[local government|local]], and tribal government officials; volunteer organizations; FEMA's disaster workforce; other Federal agencies; and the public and private sectors to minimize the impact of disasters and [[emergency|emergencies]] on the American public. EMI curricula are structured to meet the needs of this diverse audience with an emphasis on separate organizations working together in all-hazards emergencies to save lives and protect property. Particular emphasis is placed on governing doctrine such as the [[National Response Framework]] (NRF), [[National Incident Management System]] (NIMS), and the National Preparedness Guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://training.fema.gov/|title=FEMA - Emergency Management Institute (EMI) - National Preparedness Directorate National Training and Education Division|website=training.fema.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; EMI is fully accredited by the International Association for Continuing Education and Training (IACET) and the [[American Council on Education]] (ACE).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collapsenet.com/goods-and-services/44-disaster-preparedness/1074-emergency-management-institute EMI Accredited] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925092538/http://www.collapsenet.com/goods-and-services/44-disaster-preparedness/1074-emergency-management-institute |date=2015-09-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Approximately 5,500 participants attend resident courses each year while 100,000 individuals participate in non-resident programs sponsored by EMI and conducted locally by state emergency management agencies under cooperative agreements with FEMA. Another 150,000 individuals participate in EMI-supported exercises, and approximately 1,000 individuals participate in the [[Chemical Stockpile Emergency Preparedness Program]] (CSEPP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://training.fema.gov/aboutemi.aspx|title=Emergency Management Institute - About EMI|website=training.fema.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''independent study'' program at EMI consists of free courses offered to United States citizens in [[Comprehensive Emergency Management]] techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://training.fema.gov/IS/|title=Emergency Management Institute - Independent Study Program (IS)|website=training.fema.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; Course IS-1 is entitled "Emergency Manager: An Orientation to the Position" and provides background information on FEMA and the role of emergency managers in agency and volunteer organization coordination. The EMI Independent Study (IS) Program, a Web-based distance learning program open to the public, delivers extensive online training with approximately 200 courses. It has trained more than 2.8 million individuals. The EMI IS Web site receives 2.5 to 3 million visitors a day.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110609030210/http://www.collapsenet.com/goods-and-services/44-disaster-preparedness/1074-emergency-management-institute IS Course Offerings]&lt;/ref&gt;

==SMAUG model – a basis for prioritizing hazard risks==

In emergency or [[disaster management]] the SMAUG model of identifying and prioritizing risk of hazards associated with natural and technological threats is an effective tool. SMAUG stands for Seriousness, Manageability, Acceptability, Urgency and Growth and are the criteria used for prioritization of hazard risks. The SMAUG model provides an effective means of prioritizing hazard risks based upon the aforementioned criteria in order to address the risks posed by the hazards to the avail of effecting effective [[risk mitigation|mitigation]], reduction, response and [[Disaster recovery|recovery]] methods.&lt;ref name=AnnexB /&gt;

Seriousness can be defined as "The relative impact in terms of people and dollars." This includes the potential for lives to be lost and potential for injury as well as the physical, social and as mentioned, economic losses that may be incurred

Manageability can be defined as "the relative ability to mitigate or reduce the hazard (through managing the hazard, or the community or both)". Hazards presenting a high risk and as such requiring significant amounts of risk reduction initiatives will be rated high.&lt;ref name=AnnexB&gt;[http://www.cic.govt.nz/pdfs/civilDefence/CivilDefenceAppendixB.pdf Annex B – SMUG model for prioritizing hazards] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100602094511/http://www.cic.govt.nz/pdfs/civilDefence/CivilDefenceAppendixB.pdf |date=2010-06-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Acceptability – The degree to which the risk of hazard is acceptable in terms of political, environmental, social and economic impact

Urgency – This is related to the probability of risk of hazard and is defined in terms of how imperative it is to address the hazard &lt;ref name=AnnexB /&gt;

Growth – This is the potential for the hazard or event to expand or increase in either probability or risk to community or both. Should vulnerability increase, potential for growth may also increase.

An example of the numerical ratings for each of the four criteria is shown below:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cic.govt.nz/pdfs/civilDefence/CivilDefenceAppendixB.pdf Chatham Islands Civil Defense Emergence Management Plan 2005–2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100602094511/http://www.cic.govt.nz/pdfs/civilDefence/CivilDefenceAppendixB.pdf |date=2010-06-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Programs supporting regular '''feline vaccination''' have contributed both to the health of cats and to [[public health]].

Currently, there are geographically defined ''core vaccines'' and individually chosen ''non-core vaccine'' recommendations for cats. A number of controversies surrounding adverse reactions to vaccines have resulted in authorities revising their guidelines for feline vaccination.

==Recommended administration of vaccines==

===General schedule===
Most vaccination protocols recommend a series of vaccines for kittens, with [[booster dose|vaccine boosters]] given at one year of age. Frequency of vaccination thereafter varies depending on the lifestyle of the individual cat, including:&lt;ref name=ucdavis&gt;{{cite web | title = Canine and Feline Vaccination Guidelines | publisher = UC Davis Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital | date=November 2009 | url = http://www.vetmed.ucdavis.edu/vmth/small_animal/internal_medicine/newsletters/vaccination_protocols.cfm |accessdate = 2012-08-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because these factors may change over time, many professional organizations&lt;ref name=ucdavis/&gt;&lt;ref name=lifestage&gt;{{cite web|title=Feline Life Stage Guidelines |publisher=American Association of Feline Practicitioners &amp; American Animal Hospital Association |year=2010 |url=http://www.aahanet.org/PublicDocuments/FelineLifeStageGuidelines.pdf |accessdate=2012-08-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100718174020/http://www.aahanet.org/PublicDocuments/FelineLifeStageGuidelines.pdf |archivedate=2010-07-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; recommend routine annual examinations, where a vaccination plan for each individual feline can be decided during a discussion between the veterinarian and cat owner.

===Type===
In their 2010 recommendations, WSAVA (World Small Animal Veterinary Association)&lt;ref name=2010VGG/&gt; emphasized the importance of administering ''non-adjuvanted'' vaccines whenever possible, as vaccines that included these [[Immunologic adjuvant|immune-stimulating agents]] were shown to increase [[adverse vaccine reactions in pets]].

===Frequency===
WSAVA&lt;ref name=2010VGG/&gt; also prefers [[serological testing]] over unnecessary [[Booster dose|boosters or re-vaccination doses]] of core vaccines after the initial 12-month booster that follows the kitten series of modified live virus [MLV] vaccines. This is because core vaccines show an excellent correlation between the presence of antibody and [[Adaptive immune system|protective]] [[immunity (medical)|immunity]] to a disease, and have a long DOI (Duration of Immunity). Antibody tests can be used to demonstrate the DOI after vaccination with core vaccines, though not for non-core vaccines.

===Method===
Most vaccines are given by subcutaneous (under the skin) or intramuscular (into the muscle) injection. Respiratory tract disease vaccination may be given intra-nasally (in the nose) in some cases.

===Location===
Many recent protocols indicate that vaccines should be given in specific areas in order to: ease identification of which vaccine caused an adverse reaction, and ease removal of any [[vaccine-associated sarcoma]].&lt;ref name=protocol&gt;{{cite web | last = Eigner | first = Diane R. | title = Feline Vaccine Guidelines | work = The Winn Feline Foundation | url = http://www.winnfelinehealth.org/health/vaccination-guidelines.html#recommendations | accessdate = 2006-08-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In North America, vets adopted the practice of injecting specific limbs as far from the body as possible,&lt;ref name=locations&gt;{{cite web | title = VAFSTF Vaccine Site Recommendations | work = Vaccine-Associated Feline Sarcoma Task Force of the American Association of Feline Practitioners (AAFP), American Animal Hospital Association (AAHA), American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA), and Veterinary Cancer Society (VCS) | url = http://www.avma.org/vafstf/sitercmnd.asp | accessdate = 2012-06-23 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120516032348/http://www.avma.org/vafstf/sitercmnd.asp | archivedate = 2012-05-16 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; for example the rear ''right for rabies'', rear ''left for leukemia'', and others in the right front shoulder - being careful to avoid the midline or interscapular space.

This set of locations was not widely adopted outside of North America, and WSAVA's international group made new recommendations&lt;ref name=2010VGG/&gt; that vaccines be administered:
* in subcutaneous (and not intramuscular) sites
* in the skin of the lateral thorax or abdomen (for easier excision of any [[vaccine-associated sarcoma|FISS]] that occur)
* so as to avoid the interscapular or intercostal regions (as more extensive surgical resection would be needed for sarcomas)
* in a different site on each occasion (either with general locations per species per year or diagrams of where administered on specific visit)

===Core vaccines===
Core vaccines are defined as those vaccines which all cats, regardless of circumstances, should receive. Core vaccines protect animals from severe, life-threatening diseases which have global distribution.&lt;ref name=2010VGG/&gt;

====Rabies (disputed)====
The latest (2006) North American recommendation&lt;ref name=2006aafp/&gt;&lt;ref name=2006aafpsummary/&gt; still includes [[rabies]] in the core vaccines. Likewise, the National Association of State Public Health Veterinarians (NASPHV) in the U.S. gives detailed instructions on how to deal with what they describe as a serious public health problem, and includes a useful table,&lt;ref name=2011NASPHVtable&gt;{{cite web |publisher=National Association of State Public Health Veterinarians, Inc. (NASPHV) |title=Compendium of Animal Rabies Prevention and Control, 2011 |work=Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report of the Centers for Disease Control |year=2011 |accessdate = 2012-06-24 |url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr6006a1.htm#table-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  summarizing all the rabies vaccines sold in the U.S.

However, the 2010 international WSAVA recommendation generally considers the [[rabies vaccine]] a non-core vaccine, except in areas where the disease is endemic or where required by law.

====FVRCP, including FVR, FCV, FHV-1, and FPV====
&lt;!--This section heading is linked from [[FVRCP]].--&gt;
In many locations, the rabies vaccine is accompanied by a single combined FVRCP vaccine shot which protects against feline viral rhinotracheitis, calicivirus, and panleukopenia.

*[[Feline viral rhinotracheitis]] (FVR) is an upper respiratory infection of [[cat]]s, also known as '''feline influenza''', caused by feline herpesvirus 1 (FHV-1). FVR is very contagious and can cause severe disease, including death from [[pneumonia]] in young kittens.
*[[Feline calicivirus]] (FCV), in addition to FHV-1, is the other common viral cause of respiratory infection in cats.
*[[Feline panleukopenia|Feline panleukopenia virus]] (FPV), more commonly known as feline distemper, is caused by the feline [[parvovirus]], a close relative of [[canine parvovirus]]. It is not related to [[canine distemper]]. Panleukopenia is highly contagious and can be fatal.

===Non-core vaccines===
Non-core vaccines are those that are required by only those animals whose geographical location, local environment or lifestyle places them at risk of contracting specific infections.&lt;ref name=2010VGG/&gt;
* Except in areas where the disease is endemic or where required by law, the VGG considers the [[rabies vaccine]] as non-core.
*[[Chlamydophila felis]]: sometimes used as part of a control regime for cats in multiple-cats environments where infections associated with clinical disease have been confirmed.
*[[Feline leukemia virus]] (FeLV) is a [[retrovirus]] transmitted between infected cats when the transfer of saliva or nasal secretions is involved, for example when sharing a feeding dish. If not defeated by the animal's [[immune system]], the virus can be lethal. If administered, it should be injected in tip of the left rear paw{{why|date=February 2018}} (unless combined with rabies).&lt;ref name=locations/&gt;
*[[Feline immunodeficiency virus]] (FIV), commonly known as Feline AIDS is a [[lentivirus]] that affects domesticated housecats worldwide. FeLV and FIV are in the same [[Family (biology)|biological family]], and are sometimes mistaken for one another. However, the viruses differ in many ways. Although many of the diseases caused by FeLV and FIV are similar, the specific ways in which they are caused also differs. However, a vaccine against this disease is not available in all countries.
*For cats expected to board, be shown, or to enter a kennel situation within 6 months, vets may recommend administering [[Bordetella]], which protects again a respiratory illness commonly known as "[[kennel cough]]." However, studies have not shown this product to reduce severity of the feline respiratory disease complex.

===Not recommended vaccines===
The following vaccines are not recommended due either to lack of evidence of effectiveness or to a high chance of [[adverse vaccine reactions in pets|adverse reaction]].
*[[Feline infectious peritonitis]] (FIP) is a fatal, incurable disease caused by Feline Infectious Peritonitis Virus (FIPV), which is a mutation of Feline Enteric [[Coronavirus]] (FECV/FeCoV). The mutated virus can invade and grow in certain [[white blood cell]]s, namely macrophages. The immune system's response causes an intense [[inflammation|inflammatory reaction]] in the containing tissues. This disease is generally fatal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vet.cornell.edu/fhc/brochures/fip.html Feline Infectious Peritonitis (FIP)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; However its incidence rate is roughly 1 in 5000 for households with one or two cats.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aspca.org/site/PageServer?pagename=pets_fip ASPCA: Pet Care: Cat Care: Feline Infectious Peritonitis&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Giardia lamblia]]

==Controversy==
In recent years, [[vaccination]] has become a controversial topic among veterinarians and pet owners. Studies citing specific [[Adverse effect|adverse reactions]] and general consequences for long-term health and immunity are both causing professional bodies to recommend reduced frequency in feline vaccination.

In 2010, the [[American Veterinary Medical Association]] (AVMA) and American Association of Feline Practitioners (AAFP) developed vaccination guidelines recommending that FVRCP vaccinations generally be administered every 3 years, after completion of the kitten series of shots (which is needed due to maternal antibody interference&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sheltermedicine.com/node/58#revaccination|title=What should the revaccination (booster) schedule be?|publisher=UC Davis Koret Shelter Medicine Program|accessdate=12 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

Internationally, the 2010 [[The World Small Animal Veterinary Association]] (WSAVA) vaccination guidelines&lt;ref name=2010VGG/&gt; reduce the number of vaccines which should be considered core for felines, as well as recommending less frequent vaccine administration.

However, in an open letter to WSAVA,&lt;ref name=2012Mies&gt;{{cite web |url=http://users.on.net/~peter.hart/WSAVA_Critique_Owner_Breeder_Guidelines.pdf |title=Critique of the WSAVA VGG Vaccination Guidelines for Owners &amp; Breeders of Dogs and Cats |date=2012-02-06 |accessdate=October 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; an Australian pet owner and long-time consumer advocate has created a detailed critique of these guidelines, with numerous scholarly citations, arguing that the 3-year [[Booster dose|booster or re-vaccination]] recommendations are either arbitrary or influenced by vaccine manufacturers. She cites the scientific findings of both WSAVA's and other leading researchers, which indicate that, similar to humans, the duration of immunity (DOI) for cats vaccinated early in life with MLV (modified live viruses) is many years, if not the entirety of adulthood, despite the common practice of "boosting" vaccines every 1 to 3 years.

In the executive summary section, the WSAVA guidelines&lt;ref name=2010VGG/&gt; do argue against needless vaccination and in support of "the development and use of simple in-practice tests for determination of seroconversion (antibody) following vaccination." In addition, they also note that "Vaccines should not be given needlessly. Core vaccines should not be given any more frequently than every three years after the 12 month booster injection following the puppy/kitten series, because the duration of immunity (DOI) is many years and may be up to the lifetime of the pet." The open letter critique focuses on the less-nuanced summary of these recommendations in the Tables given for vaccination guidelines, which could imply that re-vaccination should occur every 3 years.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9827">'''Female genital mutilation in Sierra Leone''' (also known as female genital cutting) is the common practice of removing all or part of the female’s genitalia for cultural and religious initiation purposes, or as a custom to prepare them for marriage. [[Sierra Leone]] is one of 28 countries in Africa where female genital mutilation (FGM) is known to be practiced.&lt;ref name=Fighting&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bitong|first1=Liliane|title=Fighting Genital Mutilation in Sierra Leone.|journal=Bulletin of the World Health Organization|date=November 2005|volume=83|issue=11|pages=801–880}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural reasons==
FGM is regularly performed in Sierra Leone.&lt;ref name=Penetrating2010 /&gt; The reason that FGM is common in Sierra Leone is because FGM is practiced in a ‘secret society’ called the bondo secret society. The bondo society is an all-female society (also known as the [[Sande society|sande]]) in West Africa. Secret societies are ancient cultural institutions that play a major role in West Africa and have existed for hundreds of years.&lt;ref name="Forms reliability"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bjälkander|first1=Owolabi|last2=Grant|first2=Donald S.|last3=Berggren|first3=Vanja|last4=Bathija|first4=Heli|last5=Almroth|first5=Lars|title=Female Genital Mutilation in Sierra Leone: Forms, Reliability of Reported Status, and Accuracy of Related Demographic and Health Survey Questions|journal=Obstetrics and Gynecology International|date=March 2013|volume=2013|pages=1–14|doi=10.1155/2013/680926}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of this secret society is to help young women earn the rites of passage into adulthood. In order, to receive these rites of passage, a girl must undergo their cultural rituals including FGM.&lt;ref name=Penetrating2010 /&gt; 

The initiation into the society occurs in the bondo bush which is a private enclosure constructed near their village. Time spent in the bondo bush for initiation into womanhood used to take about a month, but as the generations have gone by, the time has significantly reduced.&lt;ref name="Forms reliability" /&gt;
Once a woman becomes a member of the bondo, she is able to go to the bondo without her husband’s permission. The bondo becomes the only place women are allowed to go to without permission from their husband. Thus, women who are a part of the bondo have an increased freedom of movement.&lt;ref name=Penetrating2010 /&gt;

In regard to society, members of the bondo are regarded as having a higher standing than other women. The cost of FGM and initiation into the bondo society is quite expensive, and so parents are proud when their daughters are initiated because it shows they are financially stable and able to afford this. Initiation can cost anywhere from 200,000 to 600,000 Leones, which converts to 62–185 dollars.&lt;ref name=Penetrating2010 /&gt; Soweis, the leader of the bondo, tend to raise the price of the initiation into the society if the woman is not a virgin. FGM is so expected in society that when a husband discovers upon marriage that his wife has not undergone FGM, it is common for him to pay for her to undergo the initiation.&lt;ref name="Forms reliability" /&gt;

Woman’s initiation is synonymous with women’s power in Sierra Leone, and the act of excision is a reminder that women are from which all human creation is derived. Bondo elders believed that excision improves sexual satisfaction as it removes focus from the clitoris onto the hidden g-spot inside the vaginal canal which they believe has more satisfying and intense orgasms. It is also thought to enhance the appearance of a women’s genitalia and make it easier to penetrate.&lt;ref name="Disputing Myth" /&gt; 

In Sierra Leone, FGM usually consists of removing the clitoris as a major part in preparing the young women for marriage and motherhood through this initiation ceremony. The procedure is usually performed by an elderly woman of the village who has been especially designated for this task, by a village barber or by a traditional birth attendant. FGM can be broken down into three types. Type I removes the tissue protecting the head of the clitoris. Type II removes the tissue protecting the head of the [[clitoris]], the clitoris itself, and part of or all of the [[labia minora]]. Type III, the most extreme case, involves removing all or part of the external genitalia and stitching the vaginal opening closed.&lt;ref name=Penetrating2010 /&gt;

==Prevalence==
FGM is mainly performed in Africa as well as a few countries in Asia and the Middle East. The worldwide estimation of how many women have undergone FGM is anywhere from 130 to 140 million.&lt;ref name="Forms reliability" /&gt; In the MICS conducted by UNICEF, the prevalence of FGM in Sierra Leone, Gambia, Burkina Faso and Mauritania was 94%, 79%, 74%, and 72% respectively. While in other countries in western Africa such as Ghana, Niger and Togo, the prevalence of FGM was less than 6%.&lt;ref&gt;Sipsma, Heather L., et al. "Female Genital Cutting: Current Practices and Beliefs in Western Africa." Bulletin of the World Health Organization 90.2 (2012): 120-127F. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Roughly 3 million girls in Africa undergo FGM every single year and Sierra Leone is one of the only countries in western Africa where the rate of prevalence is over 90%. Sierra Leone is the only country in southern western Africa with such a high rate of FGM.  There is a decline in prevalence of FGM in Sierra Leone in younger age groups.&lt;ref name="Forms reliability" /&gt;

==Health effects==
There are no health benefits associated with FGM. The severity of the medical risks varies according to the extent of the cutting. Type III is very common in Sierra Leone and has the greatest health consequences associated with it. Short-term effects of FGM include excessive bleeding, local infections, and incomplete healing. Long-term effects include scarring, genital ulcers, dermoid inclusion cysts, lower abdominal pain, and infertility. But the worst effect is death at delivery, the rate of which is excessively high in Sierra Leone&lt;ref name="Forms reliability" /&gt;

==Community response==
People in Sierra Leone believe that abandoning FGM would be an abandonment of cultural tradition. They believe that FGM is similar to male circumcision which is widely acceptable across the globe. FGM supporters in Sierra Leone believe that females who do not receive the circumcision will have trouble conceiving, suffer psychological trauma, have bad luck, or be considered unworthy of marriage. Women who are pro-FGM state that it does not oppress female sexuality and instead it celebrates it through these ritual practices.&lt;ref name="Disputing Myth"/&gt;

They also state that the supposed consequences of excision (which include menstrual problems, painful sex, infections, et cetera) were not specific to women who underwent FGM. The rate for infertility is ten percent for both groups. They also argue that the reason for increase of still births in circumcised women is not because of the FGM they underwent but because they delay receiving prenatal care and visiting hospitals because they fear being stigmatized by the medical staff because of their circumcision.&lt;ref name="Disputing Myth"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ahmadu|first1=Fuambai|title=Disputing the Myth of the Sexual Dysfunction of Circumcised Women: An Interview with Fuambai S. Ahmadu by Richard A. Shweder|journal=Anthropology Today|date=2009|volume=25|issue=6|pages=14–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

FGM supporters believe that FGM prevents prostitution by decreasing a woman’s sexual desire, and is more hygienic.&lt;ref name=Penetrating2010 /&gt; According to a five-year research done by Hanny Lightfoot-Klein, an anti-FGM activist, 94% of circumcised women reported being satisfied by their sex lives and had sex between three and four times a week.&lt;ref name="Disputing Myth" /&gt;

Anti-FGM advocates state that more than 80% of women who experience it reported suffering a minimum of one health complication.&lt;ref name=Penetrating2010&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mgbako|first1=Chi|title=Penetrating the Silence in Sierra Leone: A Blueprint for the Eradication of Female Genital Mutilation|journal=Harvard Human Rights Journal|date=2010|volume=23|issue=1|pages=110–140}}&lt;/ref&gt; People against FGM widely refer to it as mutilation which is a controversial term that is rejected by members of communities who practice it.&lt;ref name="Forms reliability" /&gt; The World Health Organization has adopted this term and it is widely used to describe the injury made to the women’s genitalia even though the intent was not to mutilate.&lt;ref name=Fighting /&gt;

The Amazonian Initiative Movement is one of several nongovernmental organizations in West Africa against FGM. The aim of the group is to educate women who perform FGM and set them up with another job besides performing this procedure. The World Health Organization has consistently condemned this traditional practice as “willful damage to healthy organs for non-therapeutic reasons” and they have stated that the practice of female genital mutilation can result in infertility, pregnancy and childbirth complications, and psychological problems through inability to experience sexual pleasure.&lt;ref name=Fighting /&gt; Supporters of the eradication of all forms of nonconsented genital cutting believe that it violates the human right to bodily integrity. However, Sierra Leone does not have an explicit law against the practice of FGM.&lt;ref name=Penetrating2010 /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24834">"Food history" is an interdisciplinary field that examines the history of food and nutrition, and the cultural, economic, environmental, and sociological impacts of food. Food history is considered distinct from the more traditional field of culinary history, which focuses on the origin and recreation of specific recipes.

The first journal in the field, ''[[Petits Propos Culinaires]]'' was launched in 1979 and the first conference on the subject was the 1981 [[Oxford Food Symposium]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Raymond Sokolov]]. "http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1134/is_9_109/ai_67410994 Review: The Cambridge World History of Food]", ''Natural History''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Middle Ages (500–1500)==
{{Main article|Medieval cuisine}}
[[File:Medieval baker.jpg|thumb|300px|A medieval [[baker]] with his apprentice. ]]
English cooking has been influenced by foreign ingredients and cooking styles since the Middle Ages.  Traditional meals have ancient origins, such as bread and cheese, roasted and stewed meats, meat and game pies, boiled vegetables and broths, and freshwater and saltwater fish. The 14th-century English cookbook, ''[[The Forme of Cury]]'' contains recipes for these, and dates from the royal court of Richard II.&lt;ref&gt; Clarissa Dickson Wright, ''A History of English Food''  (2011) pp. 46-52.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the European [[Middle Ages]], breakfast was not usually considered a necessary and important meal, and was practically nonexistent during the earlier medieval period. Monarchs and their entourages would spend lots of time around a table for meals. Only two formal meals were eaten per day—one at mid-day and one in the evening. The exact times varied by period and region, but this two-meal system remained consistent throughout the Middle Ages.  
Breakfast in some places was solely granted to children, the elderly, the sick, and to working men. Anyone else did not speak of or partake in eating in the morning. Eating breakfast meant that one was poor, was a low-status farmer or laborer who truly needed the energy to sustain his morning’s labor, or was too weak to make it to the large, midday dinner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Heather Arndt Anderson|title=Breakfast: A History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5LghYCqDJw8C&amp;pg=PA11|year=2013|pages=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because medieval people saw gluttony as a sin and a sign of weakness, men were often ashamed of eating breakfast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= C.W. Bynum |title= Holy feast and holy fast: The religious significance of food to medieval women |location = Berkeley |publisher= University of California Press | year= 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Noble travelers were an exception, as they were also permitted to eat breakfast while they were away from home. For instance, in March 1255 about 1512 gallons of wine were delivered to the English [[Henry III of England|King Henry III]] at the abbey church at [[St. Albans]] for his breakfast throughout his trip. If a king were on religious pilgrimage, the ban on breakfast was completely lifted and enough supplies were compensated for the erratic quality of meals at the local cook shops during the trip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Collin Spencer |title= British Food: an Extraordinary Thousand Years of History |location = New York |publisher= Columbia University Press | year= 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 13th century, breakfast when eaten sometimes consisted of a piece of rye bread and a bit of cheese. Morning meals would not include any meat, and would likely include ¼ gallon (1.1 L; 0.30 US gal) of low alcohol-content beers. Uncertain quantities of bread and ale could have been consumed in between meals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=M.A. Hicks |title= Revolution and consumption in late medieval England |location = Woodbridge |publisher= Boydell Press | year= 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 15th century breakfast often included meat. By this time, noble men were seen to indulge in breakfast, making it more of a common practice, and by the early 16th century, recorded expenses for breakfast became customary. The 16th-century introduction of caffeinated beverages into the European diet was part of the consideration to allow breakfast. It was believed that coffee and tea aid the body in “evacuation of superfluities,” and was consumed in the morning.&lt;ref&gt;Heather Arndt Anderson, ''Breakfast: A History(2013). &lt;/ref&gt;

==Potato==
{{Main|History of the potato}}
The potato was first domesticated in the region of modern-day southern [[Peru]] and extreme northwestern [[Bolivia]]  It has since spread around the world and become a [[staple food|staple crop]] in many countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Redcliffe N. Salaman|author2=William Glynn Burton|title=The History and Social Influence of the Potato|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EV4YE_0RsywC&amp;pg=PR11|year=1985|publisher=Cambridge UP|page=xi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:PotatoYield.png|thumb|right|Global production of potatoes in 2008]]

According to conservative estimates, the introduction of the potato was responsible for a quarter of the growth in [[Old World]] population and urbanization between 1700 and 1900.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Nunn |first1= Nathan |last2= Qian |first2= Nancy |year= 2011 |title= The Potato's Contribution to Population and Urbanization: Evidence from a Historical Experiment |url= http://www.economics.harvard.edu/faculty/nunn/files/Potato_QJE.pdf |journal= [[Quarterly Journal of Economics]] |volume= 126 |issue= 2 |pages= 593–650 |doi= 10.1093/qje/qjr009 |accessdate=7 July 2012 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110705043431/http://www.economics.harvard.edu/faculty/nunn/files/Potato_QJE.pdf | archivedate=5 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire]], the Spanish introduced the potato to Europe in the second half of the 16th century, part of the [[Columbian exchange]]. The staple was subsequently conveyed by European mariners to territories and ports throughout the world. The potato was slow to be adopted by distrustful European farmers, but soon enough it became an important food staple and field crop that played a major role in the European 19th century population boom.&lt;ref&gt;John Michael Francis, ''Iberia and the Americas: Culture, Politics, and History : a Multidisciplinary Encyclopedia''  (2005) p. 867&lt;/ref&gt; However, lack of genetic diversity, due to the very limited number of varieties initially introduced, left the crop vulnerable to disease. In 1845, a plant disease known as late blight, caused by the fungus-like [[oomycete]] ''[[Phytophthora infestans]]'', spread rapidly through the poorer communities of western [[Ireland]] as well as parts of the [[Scottish Highlands]], resulting in the crop failures that led to the [[Great Irish Famine]].&lt;ref&gt;John Crowley, et al. ''Atlas of the Great Irish Famine'' (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rice==
Rice probably originated in Korea or Australia and was widely grown in Asia 3000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;Renee Marton, ''Rice: A Global History'' (2014).&lt;/ref&gt; Muslims brought rice to Sicily with cultivation starting in the 9th century. After the 15th century, rice spread throughout Italy and then France, later propagating to all the continents during the age of European exploration.   As a cereal grain, today it is the most widely consumed staple food for Asia and elsewhere. It is the #3 agricultural commodity (rice, 741.5 million tonnes in 2014), after sugarcane (1.9 billion tonnes) and maize ("corn" in the United States, 1.0 billion tonnes).&lt;ref&gt; Michael Blake, ''Maize for the Gods: Unearthing the 9,000-Year History of Corn'' (2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the majority of all rice produced comes from China, India, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Vietnam, Thailand, [[Myanmar]], Pakistan, Philippines, Korea and Japan. Asia accounts for 87% of the world's total rice production.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony John Heaton Latham,  "From competition to constraint: The international rice trade in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries." ''Business and economic history'' (1988): 91-102. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/23702963 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early Modern Europe==
Grain and livestock have long been the center of agriculture in France and England. After 1700, innovative farmers experimented with new techniques to increase yield, and looked into entirely new products such as hops, oilseed rape, artificial grasses, vegetables, fruit, dairy foods, commercial poultry, rabbits, and freshwater fish.&lt;ref&gt;Joan Thirsk, "L'agriculture en Angleterre et en France de 1600 à 1800: contacts, coïncidences et comparaisons." ''Histoire, économie et société'' (1999): 5-23. [http://www.persee.fr/doc/hes_0752-5702_1999_num_18_1_2014 online]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sugar began as an upper-class luxury product, but by 1700 Caribbean sugar plantations worked by African slaves expanded production and lowered the price. By 1800 sugar was a staple of working-class diets. For them it symbolized increasing economic freedom and status.&lt;ref&gt;Sidney Mintz, ''Sweetness and Power: The Place of Sugar in Modern History'' (1985).&lt;/ref&gt;

==19th century==
Laborers in Western Europe in the 18th century ate bread and  gruel, often in a soup with greens and lentils, a little bacon, and occasionally potato or a bit of cheese. They washed it down with beer (Water was too contaminated), and a sip of milk. Three fourths of the food was derived from plants; fats came from plant oils. Meat was much more attractive, but very expensive. By 1870 the West European diet at about 16 kilos per person per year of meat, rising to 50 kilos by 1914, and 77 kilos in 2010. &lt;ref&gt;Lizzie Collingham, ''Taste of War: World War II and the Battle for Food'' (2013) pp 18-19, 516.&lt;/ref&gt; Milk, and cheese, was seldom in the diet-- even in the early 20th century, it was still uncommon in Mediterranean diets.&lt;ref&gt;Fernando Collantes,  "Nutritional transitions and the food system: expensive milk, selective lactophiles and diet change in Spain, 1950-65." ''Historia Agraria'' 73 (2017) pp 119-147 in Spanish.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the immigrant neighborhoods of fast-growing American industrial cities, housewives purchased ready-made food through street peddlers, hucksters, push carts, and small shops operated from private homes. This opened the way for the rapid entry of entirely new items such as pizza, spaghetti with meatballs, bagels, hoagies, pretzels, and pierogies into American eating habits, and firmly established fast food in the American culinary experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Katherine Leonard Turner|title=How the Other Half Ate: A History of Working-Class Meals at the Turn of the Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wXclDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA142|year=2014|pages=56, 142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==20th century==
The first half of the 20th century was characterized by two world wars with very high degrees of hunger and strict rationing, with the starvation of the civilian populations used as a powerful new weapon. In Germany during World War I the rationing system in urban areas virtually collapsed, with people eating animal fodder to survive the "Turnip winter."&lt;ref&gt;Belinda J. Davis, ''Home Fires Burning: Food, Politics, and Everyday Life in World War I Berlin'' (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;  In Allied countries, meat was diverted first to the soldiers, then to urgent civilian needs in Italy, Britain, France and Greece. Meat production was stretched to the limit in the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and Argentina, with Oceanic shipping closely controlled by the British.&lt;ref&gt; Richard  Perren,  "Farmers and consumers under strain: Allied meat supplies in the First World War." ''Agricultural History Review'' (2005): 212-228.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the first years of peace after the war ended in 1918, most of eastern and central Europe suffered severe food shortages.  Outside help was on the way.  The [[American Relief Administration]] (ARA) was set up under the American wartime food czar [[Herbert Hoover]], and was charged with providing emergency food rations across Central and Eastern Europe. The ARA fed millions, including the inhabitants of Germany and the Soviet Union. After U.S. government funding for the ARA expired in the summer of 1919, the ARA became a private organization, raising millions of dollars from private donors. Under the auspices of the ARA, the European Children's Fund fed millions of starving children.&lt;ref&gt;Frank M. Surface and Raymond L. Bland, ''American Food in the World War and Reconstruction Period: 1914 to 1924'' (1931). [https://archive.org/details/americanfoodinwo00fran  online]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The 1920s saw the introduction of new foodstuffs, especially fruit, transported from around the globe. After the World War many new food products became available to the typical household, with branded foods advertised for their convenience. Now instead of an experienced cook spending hours on difficult custards and puddings the housewife could purchase instant foods in jars, or powders that could be quickly mixed.  Upscale households now had ice boxes or electric refrigerators, which made for better storage and the convenience of buying in larger quantities.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Graves]] and Alan Hodge, ''The Long Week-End: A Social History of Great Britain 1918–1939'' (1940) pp. 175–176.&lt;/ref&gt;

In World War II, Nazi Germany made sure that its population was very well fed by seizing food supplies from occupied countries, and deliberately cutting off food to Jews, Poles, Russians and the Dutch.&lt;ref&gt;Collingham, ''Taste of War: World War II and the Battle for Food'' (2013) &lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the [[Marshall Plan]] 1948-1950, the United States provided taking logical expertise and financing for high productivity large-scale agribusiness operations in postwar Europe. Poultry was a favorite choice, with the rapid expansion in production, a sharp fall in prices, and widespread acceptance of the many ways to serve chicken.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Godley, "The emergence of agribusiness in Europe and the development of the Western European broiler chicken industry, 1945 to 1973." ''Agricultural History'' Review 62.2 (2014): 315-336.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Green Revolution]] was a technological breakthrough in plant productivity that increased agricultural production worldwide, particularly in the developing world. Research began in the 1930s and dramatic improvements in output became important in the late 1960s, and continue into the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Peter B.R. |last=Hazell |title=The Asian Green Revolution |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=frNfVx-KZOcC&amp;pg=PA1 |year=2009 |work=IFPRI Discussion Paper |publisher=Intl Food Policy Res Inst |id=GGKEY:HS2UT4LADZD}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initiatives resulted in the adoption of new technologies, including:
{{blockquote|new, [[high-yielding varieties]] (HYVs) of cereals, especially [[dwarf wheat]]s and rices, in association with [[chemical fertilizer]]s and [[agro-chemicals]], and with controlled water-supply (usually involving [[irrigation]]) and new methods of cultivation, including mechanization. All of these together were seen as a 'package of practices' to supersede 'traditional' technology and to be adopted as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Farmer|first=B.

'''Geriatric dentistry''' is the delivery of [[dentistry|dental care]] to older adults involving [[diagnosis]], prevention, management and treatment of problems associated with age related diseases.&lt;ref&gt;Holm-Pedersen P, Walls AW, Ship JA. Textbook of geriatric dentistry: John Wiley &amp; Sons; 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The mouth is referred to as a mirror of overall health, reinforcing that oral health is an integral part of general health. In the elderly population poor oral health has been considered a risk factor for general health problems. Older adults are more susceptible to oral conditions or diseases due to an increase in chronic conditions and physical/mental disabilities. Thus, the elderly form a distinct group in terms of provision of care.

== Ageing Population ==
The world’s population is currently ageing with the number and proportion of elderly people growing substantially. Between the years of 2000-2005 to 2010-2015 life expectancy at birth rose from 67.2 to 70.8 years.&lt;ref name=united&gt;United Nations. (2017). World Population Prospects: The 2017 Revision, Key Findings and Advance Tables. Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division. Working Paper No. ESA/P/WP/248.&lt;/ref&gt; By 2045-2050 it is projected to continue increase to 77 years. This increasing longevity can be majorly attributed to advances in modern medicine and medical technology.&lt;ref name=stone&gt;Stone, C. L. (2011). Geriatrics. Retrieved from https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.ez.library.latrobe.edu.au&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the population of people aged 60 and over is growing faster than any other younger age group and it is expected to more than double by 2050 globally.&lt;ref name=united /&gt; This will have a profound effect on society’s ability to support the needs of this growing crowd including their dental needs.

Older people have become a major focus for the oral health industry. Due to the increasing number and proportion of elderly people, age related dental problems have become more common. This is largely due to success in dental treatment and prevention of gum disease and caries at a young age, thereby leading to people retaining more of their own natural teeth.&lt;ref name=Australia&gt;Australian Institute of Health and Welfare. (2007). Older Australia at a glance (4th ed.). Cat. no. AGE 52. Canberra: AIHW.
&lt;/ref&gt; As they get older, the retained teeth are at risk of developing and accumulating oral diseases that are more extensive and severe.

==Geriatrics as a Dental [[Specialty (dentistry)|Specialty]]==

In Australia geriatric dentistry is falls under the ‘Special needs dentistry’ specialty which is recognised by the Dental Board of Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Dental Board of Australia. (2017). List of Specialties. Retrieved from http://www.dentalboard.gov.au/Registration-Standards.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; This is because often age related problems and medication can make oral health disease and conditions much more serious and complicated to treat. As a result, they require specialized and individualized treatment and considerations. It is however, important to recognize that, contrary to popular belief, ageing is not synonymous with disease and should not be considered pathologic, and rather a natural and inevitable physiological process.&lt;ref name="stone"/&gt;

In the United Kingdom the [[General Dental Council]] has as total of thirteen specialties, however, geriatrics is not one of them. Special care dentistry is however recognised as an area of specialty and focuses on the prevention and management of oral health conditions for people who have physical, sensory, intellectual, mental, emotional or social impairment or [[disability]]. Mostly for adults and adolescents and therefore older people.&lt;ref&gt;The Great Dental council. Search for a specialist. Retrieved from https://www.gdc-uk.org/patients/look-for-a-specialist&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Geriatric Patient ==
[[File:Frail elderly patient receiving dental care.png|thumb|250px|left|Frail elderly patient receiving dental care]]

The [[old age|elderly]] can be classified into many criteria. Classifying them allows for a more detailed and accurate analysis of the diversity within this age group and makes diagnosis and treatment planning more personalised. The following is a common classification of the eldelry according to age group.&lt;ref&gt;Zizza, C., Ellison, K., &amp; Wernette, C. (2009). Total Water Intakes of Community-Living Middle-Old and Oldest-Old Adults. Journals of Gerontology, 64A(4), 481-486. doi:10.1093/gerona/gln045&lt;/ref&gt;

:::::::::::::* Young-old → 65-74
:::::::::::::* Middle-old → 75-84
:::::::::::::* Oldest-old → ≥ 85

The dental classification of ageing however is more useful if it is based on the patient’s ability to seek dental care independently.&lt;ref&gt;Ettinger, R., &amp; Beck, J. (1984). Geriatric dental curriculum and the needs of the elderly. Special Care in Dentistry, 4(5), 207-13. doi:10.1111/j.1754-4505.1984.tb00189.x&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Frail elderly''' have chronic, debilitating, physical, medical and emotional problems who are unable to maintain independence without continued assistance from others. As a result, the majority of the frail elderly live in the community with support services.
* '''Functionally dependent''' elderly have chronic, debilitating, physical and medical or emotional problems or any combination that compromises their capacity to the extent where they are unable to maintain independence and as a result are homebound or institutionalized

== Dental Health of Geriatric Population ==
 [[File:Smooth Surface Caries GIF.gif|thumb|Smooth Surface Caries Progression]]
The geriatric population are an ever growing section of the community with rapidly changing dental needs. In 2020 it is predicted that more than 25% of the population in developed countries will be over the age of 65.&lt;ref&gt;Slack‐Smith L, Hearn L, Wilson D, Wright F. Geriatric dentistry, teaching and future directions. Australian Dental Journal. 2015;60(S1):125-30.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to improvements in oral health over the past 60 years, a decrease in the rate of edentulism is evident and therefore an increase in the number of natural teeth present is present &lt;ref name="hopcraft"&gt;Hopcraft M. (2015) Dental demographics and metrics of oral diseases in the ageing Australian population. Australian dental journal, 60(1): 2-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, 60% of Australians over the age of 65 had no natural teeth. In 1989, 44% had no teeth and it is expected by 2019, this figure will drop to 20%. This prediction was exceeded in 2013, with 19% of those over the age of 65 had no natural teeth.&lt;ref&gt;Chrisopoulos S, Harford J, Ellershaw A. Oral health and dental care in Australia: key facts and figures 2015: Australian Institute of Health and Welfare; 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there is a decrease in the rate of edentulism, geriatric patients typically have high levels of plaque, calculus and debris, as they are functionally dependent on others or have lost the capacity to complete tasks such as toothbrushing thoroughly. Consequently, this results in an increased caries prevalence.&lt;ref name="hopcraft" /&gt; Dental caries is a process in which enamel is dissolved by acid producing bacteria. In 2004-2006, the average DMFT (decayed, missing and filled teeth) for adults in Australia over the age of 65 was found to be 23.7%.&lt;ref name="hopcraft" /&gt; An individual’s caries risk is influenced by their sugar intake, frequency of eating, oral hygiene levels, saliva flow and function and recession.  Gingival recession is a significant finding in older adults because the exposed root surface is more susceptible to root caries and therefore increases the risk for the patient. In 2015, 95.2% of Australians over the age of 75 had at least one site with gingival recession.&lt;ref name="hopcraft" /&gt; Additionally, periodontal disease prevalence was also great as 26.0% of the geriatric population was diagnosed with active periodontal disease.&lt;ref name="hopcraft" /&gt;

== Medical Conditions affecting Oral Health ==
[[File:Caries, Periodontal disease, calculus.png|thumb|260px|left|Intra-oral photograph showing gross carious lesions, severe periodontitis and heavy dental calculus deposits]]
A number of physiological changes happen to the geriatric population with age.&lt;ref name=cho&gt;Chouhan, S. K., Gadiya, N. K., Chouhan, S., Khan, M. A., &amp; Chouhan, R. (2017). Oral health in elderly people: A neglected issue. Oral health, 2(2).&lt;/ref&gt; The gastrointestinal, renal, cardiovascular, respiratory, and immune systems often decrease in efficiency, and this impacts upon the entire body, including oral health.&lt;ref name=oua&gt;Ouanounou, A., &amp; Haas, D. A. (2015). Pharmacotherapy for the elderly dental patient. J Can Dent Assoc, 80(18).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=yellow&gt;Yellowitz, J. A. (2016). Geriatric health and functional issues. The ADA Practical Guide to Patients with Medical Conditions, Second Edition, 405-422.&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with physiological changes, physical ones involve reduced bone and muscle mass &lt;ref name=oua /&gt; Mobility can be decreased due to osteoarthritis,&lt;ref name=tan /&gt; and a variety of audio and visual changes such as cataracts, macular degeneration, and hearing loss can make communication, patient education and oral health care increasingly difficult to maintain.&lt;ref name=cho /&gt;&lt;ref name=tan /&gt;

The majority of elderly people have at least one chronic condition, with many having multiple. The most common of these include hypertension, arthritis, heart disease, cancers and diabetes.&lt;ref&gt;Administration on Aging (AOA). (2014). A Profile of Older Americans: 2014. Retrieved from https://www.acl.gov/sites/default/files/Aging%20and%20Disability%20in%20America/2014-Profile.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Other prevalent conditions include dementia, depression, hearing loss, cataracts, back and neck pain, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. (2018). Retrieved from http://www.who.int/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/ageing-and-health&lt;/ref&gt;

Geriatric patients may demonstrate a spectrum of cognitive acuity, and [[dementia]] is categorised by a progressive deterioration in cognition that eventually affects an individual’s capability to function independently. More often than not, this is diagnosed in the elderly population.&lt;ref name=cho /&gt;&lt;ref name=tan&gt;Tan, E. C., Lexomboon, D., Sandborgh‐Englund, G., Haasum, Y., &amp; Johnell, K. (2018). Medications that cause dry mouth as an adverse effect in older people: A systematic review and metaanalysis. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society, 66(1), 76-84.&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately this disease impacts upon the ability to manage their medications, systemic conditions, and [[oral hygiene]].&lt;ref name=tan /&gt; As the severity of the impairment increases, the elderly become much more susceptible to develop [[dental caries]], [[periodontal disease]] and oral infection, primarily because of the reduced capability to maintain good oral health at home.&lt;ref name=razak&gt;Razak, P. A., Richard, K. J., Thankachan, R. P., Hafiz, K. A., Kumar, K. N., &amp; Sameer, K. M. (2014). Geriatric oral health: a review article. Journal of international oral health: JIOH, 6(6), 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

The elderly usually develop a decrease in appetite, leading to a lower intake of vitamins and minerals. However, many nutrients are recommended at the same amounts as younger people.&lt;ref name=vis&gt;Vissink, A., Spijkervet, F. K. L., &amp; Amerongen, A. V. N. (1996). Aging and saliva: a review of the literature. Special Care in Dentistry, 16(3), 95-103.&lt;/ref&gt; Another reason why inadequate nutrition levels are more prominent with elders is if their dental status is poor, with missing teeth or ill fitting [[dentures]], it can negatively affect their taste and ability to chew on food.&lt;ref name=papas&gt;Papas, A. S., Niessen, L. C., &amp; Chauncey, H. H. (1991). Geriatric dentistry: aging and oral health. Mosby Year Book.&lt;/ref&gt; Even well-fitted dentures are less efficient than natural teeth in terms of chewing, so changes in diet to softer foods often happen. Such foods often contain more fermentable carbohydrates, which raise individuals’ risk to developing dental caries.&lt;ref name=vis /&gt;

== Oral changes ==
The most common oral conditions in geriatric patients are [[tooth loss]], [[dental caries]], [[periodontitis]], [[dry mouth]] and [[oral cancer]]. Each can affect the quality of life.&lt;ref name="Petersen, P. E. 2005"&gt;Petersen, P. E., &amp; Yamamoto, T. (2005). Improving the oral health of older people: the approach of the WHO Global Oral Health Programme. Community dentistry and oral epidemiology, 33(2), 81-92.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Changes to Saliva ===
[[Polypharmacy]] is common in geriatric patients, which can cause a multitude of symptoms.&lt;ref name=yellow /&gt; Xerostomia is amongst the most common, commonly linked to [[antidepressants]], [[psycholeptics]], inhaled medications such as [[Salbutamol]] and the slight degeneration of [[salivary gland]] function with aging.&lt;ref&gt;Sreebny, L. M., &amp; Schwartz, S. S. (1997). A reference guide to drugs and dry mouth–2nd edition. Gerodontology, 14(1), 33-47&lt;/ref&gt; Chronic dry mouth is prevalent in a high proportion of the elderly population, affecting roughly one fifth of the group.&lt;ref name="Murray Thomson 2014"&gt;Murray Thomson, W. (2014). Epidemiology of oral health conditions in older people. Gerodontology, 31(s1), 9-16.&lt;/ref&gt; There has been a link between dry mouth and comorbid diseases including [[diabetes]], [[Alzheimer’s]] or [[Parkinson’s disease]] &lt;ref name=cho /&gt;&lt;ref name=yellow /&gt; Additionally, xerostomia can arise from general [[dehydration]].&lt;ref&gt;Stein, P., &amp; Aalboe, J. (2015). Dental Care in the Frail Older Adult: Special Considerations and Recommendations. Journal of the California Dental Association, 43(7), 363-368.&lt;/ref&gt; A dry mouth can be associated with caries, [[cracked lips]], [[fissured tongue]] and oral [[mucositis]].&lt;ref name=yellow /&gt; It can impact heavily on the patient’s quality of life, affecting taste, speaking, enjoyment and ingestion of food, and fitting dentures.&lt;ref&gt;Cassolato, S. F., &amp; Turnbull, R. S. (2003). Xerostomia: clinical aspects and treatment. Gerodontology, 20(2), 64-77.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Human tongue infected with oral candidiasis.jpg|thumb|180px|Human tongue infected with oral candidiasis - more commonly known as oral thrush]]

=== Changes to the Oral Mucosa ===
Changes to the oral mucous membrane including the [[epithelium]] and connective tissue, result in decreased immunity against pathogens. There is a loss of elasticity and stippling, with a general thinning over time. Diseases such as [[oral thrush]] can become more prevalent, and the healing rate lowers.&lt;ref&gt;Gil-Montoya, J. A., de Mello, A. L. F., Barrios, R., Gonzalez-Moles, M. A., &amp; Bravo, M. (2015). Oral health in the elderly patient and its impact on general well-being: a nonsystematic review. Clinical Interventions in Aging, 10, 461.&lt;/ref&gt; Geriatric patients are more likely to develop [[oral cancers]] too, which often start on the side of the tongue, floor of mouth or lips.&lt;ref name="Petersen, P. E. 2005"/&gt;

=== Changes to the Teeth ===
With continued chewing, talking, and general use, the tooth eventually wears down with [[attrition (dental)|attrition]] and [[dental erosion]] most commonly seen.&lt;ref name=papas /&gt; The outermost translucent layer, [[Tooth enamel|enamel]], does not regenerate, so as it thins down the underlying yellowish layer, [[dentine]], can show through or even become exposed. Aesthetically, teeth may look more yellow than white, and can become stained more easily.&lt;ref name=razak /&gt; Dentine continues to be produced, resulting in the formation of secondary dentine. Gradually however, the tubules obturate and lead to dentinal sclerosis.&lt;ref name=razak /&gt; The innermost layer containing the nerves, [[pulp (tooth)|pulp]], develops more fibres and less cells leading to shrinkage. A reduced blood supply means that an elderly patient’s pulp does not have the same capacity to heal itself compared with younger patients. Calcification of the pulp with the root canals narrowing increases in frequency with the geriatric population too. This can often lead to decreased sensitivity to stimuli, e.g. cold or sweet foods. [[Cementum]] on the tooth roots is continually produced; however with age the rate this happens slows down, leaving the geriatric patient at a higher risk for developing root caries.

=== Ageing and [[Periodontal Disease]] ===
[[File:Periodontal Disease.png|thumb|250px|Periodontal Disease]]
The instance of periodontal disease increases with age,&lt;ref name=locker&gt;Locker, D., Slade, G. D., &amp; Murray, H. (1998). Epidemiology of periodontal disease among older adults: a review. Periodontology 2000, 16(1), 16-33.&lt;/ref&gt; however it is not due to the nature of the condition, but rather indicates the patient’s cumulative oral history.&lt;ref name=razak /&gt; Due to the aging process and certain health conditions of the geriatric population; they can be more susceptible to pathogenic anaerobic bacteria infecting the periodontium and initiating inflammation. Age increases the risk of periodontal disease but does not cause it.&lt;ref name=locker /&gt; Most of the geriatric community have moderate levels of attachment loss, with less having advanced stages of the disease.&lt;ref name="Murray Thomson 2014"/&gt; Active periodontitis is a risk factor for certain systemic diseases as well, including [[cardiovascular disease]], [[stroke]] and [[aspiration pneumonia]].&lt;ref name=razak /&gt;

== Dental care in residential aged care facilitates ==
[[File:Paralysed and functionally dependant patient receiving dental care.png|thumb|left|Paralysed and functionally dependant patient receiving dental care]]
Elderly people in [[residential care]] facilities are considered to have some of the poorest oral health in Australia,&lt;ref name="hopcraft nursing home"&gt;Hopcraft, M., Morgan, M., Satur, J., Wright, F., &amp; Darby, I. (2012). Oral hygiene and periodontal disease in Victorian nursing homes. Gerodontology, 29(2), E220-8.&lt;/ref&gt; and are some of our most vulnerable and disadvantaged population groups.

Elderly people who are functionally dependant and residing in residential care facilities, are particularly vulnerable to oral health issues such as periodontal disease, dental caries, particularly root caries and other oral health issues.  
Their dependence on staff to assist them with daily oral hygiene care often results in minimal hygiene being provided.&lt;ref name="wallace"&gt;Wallace, JP, Mohammadi, J, Wallace, Lg, &amp; Taylor, Ja. (2016). Senior Smiles: Preliminary results for a new model of oral health care utilizing the dental hygienist in residential aged care facilities. International Journal of Dental Hygiene, 14(4), 284-288.&lt;/ref&gt; Oral health requirements are often unfortunately overshadowed by more important things such as feeding, toileting and bathing.&lt;ref name="wallace" /&gt; Other barriers that care staff in residential aged care facilities experience to providing oral care included lack of oral health policies, and ongoing education and training.&lt;ref&gt;Nitschke, I., Majdani, M., Sobotta, B., Reiber, T., &amp; Hopfenmüller, W. (2010). Dental care of frail older people and those caring for them. Journal of Clinical Nursing, 19(13-14), 1882-90.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically there has been a reluctance with dental professionals to attend residential aged-care facilities.&lt;ref name=hearn&gt;Hearn, L., &amp; Slack-Smith, L. (2015). Oral health care in residential aged care services: barriers to engaging health-care providers. Australian journal of primary health, 21(2), 148-156.&lt;/ref&gt; When combined with the difficulty experienced for residents to access dental care themselves,&lt;ref name="hopcraft nursing home" /&gt; their options have been limited. Therefore, the need for regular onsite professional dental care is urgently required,&lt;ref&gt;Hilton, S., Sheppard, J., &amp; Hemsley, B. (2016). Feasibility of implementing oral health guidelines in residential care settings: Views of nursing staff and residential care workers. Applied Nursing Research : ANR, 30, 194-203.&lt;/ref&gt; to address early detection, prevention and treatment of oral health problems.

Maintaining the oral health of residents in residential care facilities requires a multidisciplinary approach to address these issues. The incorporation of the [[dental therapist|oral health therapist]] into the residential aged care facility, as part of a multidisciplinary approach with nursing staff, is suggested to demonstrate an effective and efficient use of health resources.&lt;ref name="hopcraft nursing home" /&gt; The oral health therapist can provide individualized oral hygiene care plans, routine dental care, and help provide education, preventative programmes and ongoing support and motivation to nursing staff.

Having the oral health therapist implement and manage an oral health training programme that is then executed by a registered nurse, who is the oral health leader, and who has received oral health education by the oral health therapist.&lt;ref name="wallace" /&gt; They are then able to carry out and enforce the programme whilst the oral health therapist is not there. This would encourage better integration, education and motivation of nurses and care staff into oral hygiene care delivery.&lt;ref name=AIHW&gt;Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW). (2010). Residential aged care facility, Identifying and definitional attributes Retrieved from http://meteor.aihw.gov.au/content/index.phtml/itemId/384424&lt;/ref&gt; Increasing the ability and confidence of staff when performing oral health care for residents and being able to identify oral health care problems when they arise.&lt;ref name=AIHW /&gt;
The emphasis needs to be on good end of life oral care, through prevention and maintenance rather than advanced dental treatments.&lt;ref name=hearn /&gt; This is where the oral health therapist could fill that niche in residential care facilities.&lt;ref name=hearn /&gt;

== Barriers to effective cleaning  ==

An ageing population involving an increased retention of teeth, often with complex restorations, is expected to increase the demand for dental care in older people. As people age they attend dental services less frequently, and face a number of barriers to accessing dental care. This involves clinics not being easily accessible for frail, disabled or functionally dependant elderly who have limited mobility, and are wheelchair dependant and/or cognitively impaired.&lt;ref&gt;Putten, Gert-Jan, Baat, Cees, Visschere, Luc, &amp; Schols, Jos. (2014). Poor oral health, a potential new geriatric syndrome. Gerodontology, 31(S1), 17-24.&lt;/ref&gt; Access is often even more difficult for elderly residing in residential aged care facilities.&lt;ref name=hearn /&gt;

As people age and become frail, disabled or functionally dependant, their oral health is put at great risk,&lt;ref&gt;Dolan, T. A., Atchison, K., &amp; Huynh, T. N. (2005). Access to dental care among older adults in the United States. Journal of dental education, 69(9), 961-974.&lt;/ref&gt; due to a variety of health problems or disabilities that impact on the ability for them to provide their own oral cares.&lt;ref name =NSW&gt;NSW Government, (2014). Oral Health care for older people in NSW. Retrieved from www.health.nsw.gov.au/oralhealth/Publications/oral-health-older-people-toolkit.pdf
&lt;/ref&gt; This may be related to issues that are associate with:

* [[Cognitive deficit|Cognitive impairment]] – such as Dementia and Alzheimers which results in uncooperative behaviour due to confusional states
* Functional limitations – such as poor dexterity, strength or pain resulting from hand and upper limb disfunction, and diminished eyesight
* Functional problems  - such as swallowing difficulties or tongue and mouth movements.&lt;ref name=NSW /&gt;

== Dentures and Edentulism ==
=== Edentulism ===
[[File:Ppricv.jpg|thumb|250px|Intra-oral photograph showing full upper denture and natural lower teeth with mandibular central incisors missing]]
Edentulism is the result of a mostly preventable oral disease process that is a worldwide public health concern. The loss of the permanent dentition is a multi-factorial process resulting from the impact of dental caries, periodontal disease and social factors. People who have lost teeth are referred to as (either partially or completely) edentulous (edentate), however those who have not lost teeth are referred to as dentate.&lt;ref name=darby&gt;Darby M, &amp; Walsh, Margaret M. (2010), Dental hygiene: Theory and practice 3rd ed. St. Louis: Saunders/Elsevier.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Functions of Teeth ====
* Support the lips and cheeks, providing for a fuller, more aesthetically pleasing appearance 
* Maintain an individual's bite or occlusion 
* Along with the tongue and lips, assist with proper pronunciation of words 
* Preserve/maintain the height of the alveolar ridge 
* Mastication of food &lt;ref name=Fer&gt;Ferencz JL, Felton DA, (2009). Facing the future of edentulism. Journal of Prosthodontist; 18(2): 86–87.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Consequences Of Edentulism ====
[[File:Edentulism.png|thumb|250px|Extra-oral photograph showing a completely edentulous maxillary and mandibular arch]]
* Resorption of alveolar ridge 
* Reduced chewing efficiency &amp; Limitation of food selection 
* Speech impairment 
* Change in appearance 
* Psychosocial impact 
* Reduced quality of life &lt;ref name=Fer /&gt;

==== Why Replace A Missing Tooth/Teeth? ====
* Aesthetics 
* Improved function
** Mastication
** Speech
* Prevention of food packing and mucosal trauma 
* Space maintenance
* Alveolar bone maintenance
* Reestablishment of occlusion and prevention of malocclusion 
* Reduce load on remaining teeth &lt;ref name=Lip&gt;Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins (2004). Don't forget to brush your teeth. 1(2), 28-31. doi:10.1097/01.JBI.0000393992.48273.e8&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dentures === 
Dentures are prosthetic appliances fabricated to fill the gaps of missing teeth. Conventional style dentures are removable appliances and are designed to be either a complete denture or a partial denture anchoring to adjacent teeth. There are many denture designs, some which rely on chemical bonding or clasping onto teeth or attached via dental implants known as fixed prosthodontics.&lt;ref name=hopcraft /&gt;

==== Denture Cleaning ====
[[File:Mr M's Complete Denture2.jpg|thumb|250px|Full acrylic removable upper/maxillary denture]]
* Remove denture whenever possible (especially overnight and keep in a dry and safe place) 
* Remove/rinse denture and mouth after eating 
* Use soft denture brush with non-abrasive dentifrice
* Clean over sink filled with water 
* Soak denture in appropriate solution (e.g. Polident) daily
* Bleach or vinegar can be used to remove stains (heavily diluted with water in the ratio 10:1)
* Concentrated bleach solutions can cause
** Changes in colouration of acrylic
** Darkening and/or damage of base &lt;ref name=Fer /&gt;

==== Common Denture Concerns ====
* Denture stomatitis (redness/inflammation due to denture not being removed especially at night) 
* Poor oral hygiene practices 
* “Sore spots” due to dentures ill-fitting and rubbing resulting in ulcers etc 
* Loss of retention (therefore resulting in a reline of denture or a remake may be required) 
* Fractures due to dropping dentures (Acrylic resin can be repaired easily however metal based or chrome cobalt dentures will require soldering or remake as much harder to add teeth too.&lt;ref name=AUS&gt;Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (2016). Dementia in Australia. Australian Government Cat. no. AGE 70. Canberra: AIHW. https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports/dementia/dementia-in-australia/contents/table-of-contents&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fer /&gt;

== Practical suggestions ==
People are now living longer and retaining their teeth for longer due to the preventive focused approach to dentistry. Although the rates of edentulism are rapidly declining, this is resulting in the number of natural teeth retained in the dentition. The impact of this is especially apparent in the residential care setting, as Personal Care Assistant staff are often time poor as a high resident to PCA ratio, oral care is often not adequately attended too or not at all. Residential care facilities will continue to encounter residents retaining their own natural teeth as the population is growing and living for longer periods so an oral health intervention will be required to combat this area of care that is severely lacking in many facilities. Utilising Oral Health Therapists in this sector would provide some assistance in closing the gap.&lt;ref name=AUS /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fer"/&gt;

=== Management of Geriatric Patients ===
* Developing a routine with oral hygiene care at the same time every day with the patients input as to when is most convenient 
* Undertaking oral care in a quiet distraction-free environment 
* Use of short, simple sentences and directions 
* Use of task-breakdown and one-step instructions placement of a step by step poster illustrating each step 
* Use of non-verbal cues eg. facial expressions, hand gestures, body language ( reassuring patient) 
* Gentle touch to promote trust 
* Using reminders and prompts for oral hygiene care 
* Use of dementia communication techniques such as chaining, bridging, and rescuing applied to oral hygiene practices &lt;ref name=AUS /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fer"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4090">A material's '''half-value layer (HVL)''', or '''half-value thickness''', is the thickness of the material at which the [[intensity (physics)|intensity]] of [[radiation]] entering it is reduced by one half.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.euronuclear.org/info/encyclopedia/h/half-value-thickness.htm Definition from the European Nuclear Society&lt;/ref&gt; HVL can also be expressed in terms of [[kerma (physics)|air kerma]] rate (AKR), rather than intensity: the half-value layer is the thickness of specified material that, "attenuates the beam of radiation to an extent such that the AKR is reduced to one-half of its original value. In this definition the contribution of all scattered radiation, other than any [...] present initially in the beam concerned, is deemed to be excluded."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=FDA|url= http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=1020.30|title=Sec. 1020.30 Diagnostic x-ray systems and their major components.|accessdate=2007-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than AKR, measurements of [[kerma (physics)|air kerma]], [[Exposure (radiation)|exposure]], or [[Exposure (radiation)#Exposure rate constant|exposure rate]] can be used to determine half value layer, as long as it is given in the description.

Half-value layer refers to the first half-value layer, where subsequent (i.e. second) half-value layers refer to the amount of specified material that will reduce the air kerma rate by one-half after material has been inserted into the beam that is equal to the sum of all previous half-value layers.

Quarter-value layer is the amount of specified material that reduces the air kerma rate (or exposure rate, exposure, air kerma, etc...) to one fourth of the value obtained without any test filters. The quarter-value layer is equal to the sum of the first and second half-value layers.

The homogeneity factor (HF) describes the polychromatic nature of the beam and is given by:

&lt;math&gt;HF=\frac{1^{st} HVL}{2^{nd} HVL}&lt;/math&gt;

The HF for a narrow beam will always be less than or equal to one (it is only equal to one in the case of a monoenergetic beam). In case of a narrow polychromatic beam, the HF is less than one because of beam hardening.

HVL is related to [[Mean free path]], however the mean free path is the average distance a unit of radiation can travel in the material before being absorbed, whereas HVL is the average amount of material needed to absorb 50% of all radiation (i.e., to reduce the [[intensity (physics)|intensity]] of the incident radiation by half).

In the case of sound waves, HVL is the distance that it takes for the intensity of a sound wave to be reduced to one-half of its original value. The HVL of sound waves is determined by both the medium through which it travels, and the frequency of the beam. A "thin" half-value layer (or a quick drop of -3&amp;nbsp;dB) results from a high frequency sound wave and a medium with a high rate of [[attenuation]], such as bone. HVL is measured in units of length.&lt;ref&gt;Edelman, Sidney Ph.D. Understanding Ultrasound Physics. 3rd ed. Copyright 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar concept is the tenth-value layer or TVL. The TVL is the average amount of material needed to absorb 90% of all radiation, i.e., to reduce it to a tenth of the original intensity. 1 TVL is greater than or equal to log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(10) or approximately 3.32 HVLs, with equality achieved for a monoenergetic beam.

Here are example approximate half-value layers for a variety of materials against a source of gamma rays (Iridium-192):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The '''Health and Safety Commission''' ('''HSC''') was a [[United Kingdom]] [[non-departmental public body]]. The HSC was created by the [[Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974]] (HSWA).&lt;ref&gt;[[Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974]], s.10&lt;/ref&gt; It was formally established on 31 July 1974. The Commission consisted of a chairman and between six and nine other people, appointed by the Secretary of State for Employment, latterly the [[Secretary of State for Work and Pensions]], after consultation.&lt;ref&gt;Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974, s.10(2)-(4)&lt;/ref&gt; The first meeting of the HSC took place on 1 October 1974. Its responsibilities covered [[England and Wales]] and [[Scotland]]. In [[Northern Ireland]], its functions were carried out by the [[Health and Safety Executive for Northern Ireland]]. It merged with the [[Health and Safety Executive]] on 1 April 2008.

==Functions==
The Commission's duties were to:&lt;ref&gt;Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974, s.11(2)&lt;/ref&gt;
*Assist and encourage persons concerned with matters relevant to the operation of the objectives of the HSWA;
*Make arrangements for and encourage research and publication, [[training]] and information in connection with its work;
*Make arrangements for securing that [[government department]]s, employers, employees, their respective representative organisations, and other persons are provided with an information and advisory service and are kept informed of, and adequately advised on, such matters;
*Propose regulations.

The Commission was further obliged keep the Secretary of State informed of its plans and ensure alignment with the policies of the Secretary of State, giving effect to any directions given to it.&lt;ref&gt;Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974, s.11(3)&lt;/ref&gt; The Secretary of State could give directions to the Commission.&lt;ref&gt;Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974, s.12&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 April 2006, the Commission ceased to have responsibility for [[railway safety]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Railways Act 2005]], ss.2, 60/ Sch.3 para.3(1)(b)(2); Railways Act 2005 (Commencement No.5) Order 2006, [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2006/20060266.htm SI 2006/266, art.2(2), Sch.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Merger with the HSE==
In practice, the Commission delegated its responsibilities to the [[Health and Safety Executive]] (HSE).&lt;ref&gt;Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974, ss.11(4), 14&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2007, the [[Department for Work and Pensions]] started consultation on merger of the HSC and HSE to a largely positive response.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://www.dwp.gov.uk/publications/dwp/2007/hsmerger/ | title=The Merger of the Health and Safety Commission and the Health and Safety Executive | publisher=Department for Work and Pensions | accessdate=2008-03-29 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080114040201/http://www.dwp.gov.uk/publications/dwp/2007/hsmerger/ | archivedate=2008-01-14 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 March 2008, [[government minister]] [[Lord McKenzie of Luton]] announced that the merger would be completed during spring 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web|publisher=Institute of Occupational Safety and Health |year=2008 |url=http://www.iosh.co.uk/index.cfm?go=news.release&amp;id=504 |title=Cross party backing for health and safety professionals |accessdate=2008-03-29 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080403191935/http://www.iosh.co.uk/index.cfm?go=news.release&amp;id=504 |archivedate=2008-04-03 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The merger was completed on 1 April 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | date=1 April 2008 | title=Health and Safety Commission and Health and Safety Executive merge to form a single regulatory body | author=Department for Work and Pensions | url=http://www.dwp.gov.uk/mediacentre/pressreleases/2008/apr/emp070-010408.asp | accessdate=2008-04-06 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517043304/http://www.dwp.gov.uk/mediacentre/pressreleases/2008/apr/emp070-010408.asp | archivedate=17 May 2008 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Legislative Reform (Health and Safety Executive) Order 2008, [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2008/uksi_20080960_en_1 SI 2008/960]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- History --&gt;
[[Wine]] has a long [[history (wine)|history]] of use as an [[History of medicine|early form of medication]], being recommended variously as a safe alternative to [[drinking water]], an [[antiseptic]] for treating wounds, a [[Digestion|digestive aid]], and as a cure for a wide range of ailments including [[lethargy]], [[diarrhea]] and pain from [[child birth]].&lt;ref name="Miscellany"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Harding G|title=A Wine Miscellany |pages=66–70, 90 &amp; 108 |publisher=Clarkson Potter |location=New York |year=2005 |isbn=0-307-34635-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ancient Egypt]]ian [[papyri]] and [[Sumer]]ian tablets dating back to 2200 BC detail the medicinal role of wine, making it the world's oldest documented human-made medicine.&lt;ref name="Robinson_2006"&gt;{{cite book | veditors = Robinson J | title = The Oxford Companion to Wine |edition=3rd |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2006 |isbn=0-19-860990-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|433}} Wine continued to play a major role in medicine until the late 19th and early 20th century, when changing opinions and medical research on [[alcohol]] and [[alcoholism]] cast doubt on its role as part of a healthy lifestyle.

==Moderate consumption==
{{See also|Recommended maximum intake of alcoholic beverages}}
[[File:Glass of unidentified red wine.jpg|left|thumb|Some doctors define "moderate" consumption as one 5 oz (150 ml) glass of wine per day for women and two glasses per day for men.&lt;ref name=Kee2014/&gt;]]
Nearly all research into the positive medical benefits of wine consumption makes a distinction between moderate consumption and heavy or [[binge drinking]].&lt;ref name=Kee2014/&gt;  Moderate levels of consumption vary by the individual according to [[Ageing|age]], [[gender]], [[genetics]], [[weight]] and [[Human body|body stature]], as well as situational conditions, such as [[food]] consumption or use of drugs.&lt;ref name=Kee2014/&gt; In general, women absorb alcohol more quickly than men due to their lower [[body water]] content, so their moderate levels of consumption may be lower than those for a male of equal age.&lt;ref name="Robinson_2006" /&gt;{{rp|341–2}} Some experts define "moderate consumption" as less than one {{convert|5|USoz|ml|adj=on}} glass of wine per day for women and two glasses per day for men.&lt;ref name=Kee2014/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |editor1-first=Tracy C. |editor1-last=Shuman | name-list-format = vanc |url=http://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/guide/heart-disease-alcohol-your-heart |title=Alcohol and Heart disease |publisher=WebMD |date=October 1, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The view of consuming wine in moderation has a history recorded as early as the Greek poet [[Eubulus (poet)|Eubulus]] (360 BC) who believed that three bowls ([[Kylix (drinking cup)|kylix]]) were the ideal amount of wine to consume. The number of three bowls for moderation is a common theme throughout Greek writing; today the standard 750 ml [[wine bottle]] contains roughly the volume of three kylix cups (250&amp;nbsp;ml or 8&amp;nbsp;fl&amp;nbsp;oz each).&lt;ref name="Johnson pg 35-46"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Johnson H | title = Vintage: The Story of Wine | pages = 35-46 | publisher = Simon and Schuster | date = 1989 | isbn = 0-671-68702-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the kylix cups would have contained a [[Ancient Greece and wine#Greek wine|diluted wine]], at a 1:2 or 1:3 dilution with water.  In his circa 375 BC play ''[[Semele]] or [[Dionysus]]'', Eubulus has Dionysus say:

{{cquote|''Three bowls do I mix for the temperate: one to health, which they empty first, the second to love and pleasure, the third to sleep. When this bowl is drunk up, wise guests go home. The fourth bowl is ours no longer, but belongs to violence; the fifth to uproar, the sixth to drunken revel, the seventh to black eyes, the eighth is the policeman's, the ninth belongs to biliousness, and the tenth to madness and hurling the furniture.''&lt;ref&gt;Eubulus. ''Semele or Dionysus'', fr. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Effect on the body==

===Bones===
Heavy alcohol consumption has been shown to have a damaging effect on the cellular processes that create [[bone tissue]], and long-term alcoholic consumption at high levels increases the frequency of [[fracture]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Walker-Bone K | title = Recognizing and treating secondary osteoporosis | journal = Nature Reviews. Rheumatology | volume = 8 | issue = 8 | pages = 480–92 | date = August 2012 | pmid = 22782006 | doi = 10.1038/nrrheum.2012.93 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Epidemiological studies (studies done by interviewing subjects and studying their health records) have found a positive association between moderate alcohol consumption and increased bone mineral density (BMD). Most of this research has been conducted with postmenopausal women, but one study in men concluded that moderate consumption of alcohol may also be beneficial to BMD in men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McLernon DJ, Powell JJ, Jugdaohsingh R, Macdonald HM | title = Do lifestyle choices explain the effect of alcohol on bone mineral density in women around menopause? | journal = The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 95 | issue = 5 | pages = 1261–9 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 22456655 | doi = 10.3945/ajcn.111.021600 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cancer===
{{See also|Alcohol and cancer}}
The [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] of the [[World Health Organization]] has classified alcohol as a [[List of IARC Group 1 carcinogens|Group 1 carcinogen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Alcohol drinking |publisher=[[World Health Organization]], [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] |location=[[Lyon]] |year=1988 |pages=2–3 |isbn=92-832-1244-4 |url=http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/vol44/volume44.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cardiovascular system===
{{See also|Alcohol and cardiovascular disease}}
[[File:Blood clot diagram.png|250px|right|thumb|The anticoagulant properties of wine may have the potential benefits of reducing the risk of [[blood clot]]s that can lead to [[heart disease]].]]

Studies have shown that heavy drinkers put themselves at greater risk for [[heart disease]] and developing potentially fatal [[cardiac arrhythmia]]s. Excessive alcohol consumption can cause higher blood pressure, increase [[cholesterol]] levels and weakened heart muscles. Studies have shown that moderate wine drinking can improve the balance of [[low-density lipoprotein]] (LDL or "bad" cholesterol) to [[high-density lipoprotein]] (HDL or "good" cholesterol), which has been theorized as to clean up or remove LDL from [[Atheroma|blocking]] [[arteries]].&lt;ref name="diet"&gt;{{cite web |first=Kathleen M. |last=Zelman |url=http://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/features/wine-how-much-is-good-for-you |title=Wine: How Much Is Good for You? |publisher=WebMD |date=January 26, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main cause of [[heart attacks]] and the pain of [[Angina pectoris|angina]] is the lack of oxygen caused by [[blood clots]] and [[atheromatous plaque]] build up in the arteries. The alcohol in wine has [[anticoagulant]] properties that limits blood clotting by making the [[platelet]]s in the blood less prone to stick together and reducing the levels of [[fibrin]] protein that binds them together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.5344/ajev.2011.11013 |title=Wine and Health: A Review |year=2011 | vauthors = Guilford JM, Pezzuto JM |journal=American Journal of Enology and Viticulture |volume=62 |issue=4 |pages=471–86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professional cardiology associations recommend that people who are currently nondrinkers should not start drinking alcohol.&lt;ref name="heart.org"/&gt;

===Dementia and mental functions===
{{See also|Alcohol dementia}}
One of the [[short-term effects of alcohol]] is impaired [[mental function]], which can cause behavioral changes and [[memory impairment]]. Long-term effects of heavy drinking can inhibit new brain cell development and increase the risk for developing [[major depressive disorder]]s. Studies have linked moderate alcohol consumption to lower risk of developing [[Alzheimer's]] and [[dementia]] though wine's role in this link is not yet fully understood.&lt;ref name="Robinson_2006" /&gt;{{rp|341–2}} A 2009 study by [[Wake Forest University]] School of Medicine suggest that moderate alcohol consumption may help healthy adults ward off the risks of developing dementia but can accelerate declining memory for those already suffering from [[cognitive impairment]]. The reason for the potential positive benefit of moderate consumption is not yet identified and may even be unrelated to the alcohol but rather other shared lifestyle factors of moderate drinkers (such as exercise or diets). If it is the moderate consumption, researchers theorize that it may be alcohol's role in promoting the production of "good cholesterol" which prevents blood platelets from sticking together. Another potential role of alcohol in the body may be in stimulating the release of the chemical [[acetylcholine]] which influences brain function and memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | vauthors = Laino C | url=http://www.webmd.com/healthy-aging/news/20090713/moderate-drinking-may-cut-dementia-risk |title=Moderate Drinking May Cut Dementia Risk |publisher=WebMD |date=July 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diabetes===
Research has shown that moderate levels of alcohol consumed with meals does not have a substantial impact on [[blood sugar]] levels. A 2005 study presented to the [[American Diabetes Association]] suggest that moderate consumption may lower the risk of developing [[Type 2 diabetes]].&lt;ref name="Robinson_2006" /&gt;{{rp|341–2}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Koppes LL, Dekker JM, Hendriks HF, Bouter LM, Heine RJ | title = Moderate alcohol consumption lowers the risk of type 2 diabetes: a meta-analysis of prospective observational studies | journal = Diabetes Care | volume = 28 | issue = 3 | pages = 719–25 | date = March 2005 | pmid = 15735217 | doi = 10.2337/diacare.28.3.719 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Digestive system===
[[File:EMpylori.jpg|left|thumb|The anti-bacterial nature of alcohol may reduce the risk of infection by the ''Helicobacter pylori'' bacterium that has been associated with [[stomach cancer]] as well as [[gastritis]] and [[peptic ulcer]]s.]]
The anti-bacterial nature of alcohol has long been associated with soothing stomach irritations and ailments like [[traveler's diarrhea]] where it was a preferred treatment to the less palatable [[Bismuth subsalicylate|bismuth treatments]]. The risk of infection from the bacterium ''[[Helicobacter pylori]]'', strongly associated with causing [[gastritis]] and [[peptic ulcer]]s as well as being closely linked to stomach cancer, appears to lessen with moderate alcohol consumption.&lt;ref name="Robinson_2006" /&gt;{{rp|341–2}} A German study conducted in the late 1990s showed that non-drinkers had slightly higher infection rates of ''Helicobacter pylori'' than moderate wine and beer drinkers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brenner H, Berg G, Lappus N, Kliebsch U, Bode G, Boeing H | title = Alcohol consumption and Helicobacter pylori infection: results from the German National Health and Nutrition Survey | journal = Epidemiology | volume = 10 | issue = 3 | pages = 214–8 | date = May 1999 | pmid = 10230827 | doi = 10.1097/00001648-199905000-00004 | jstor = 3703585 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wine's positive effects on the metabolism of [[cholesterol]] has been suggested as a link to lower occurrences of [[gallstones]] among moderate drinkers since cholesterol is a major component of gallstones.&lt;ref name="Robinson_2006" /&gt;{{rp|341–2}}

===Headaches===
{{See also|Red wine headache}}
There are several potential causes of so-called "red wine headaches", including [[histamine]]s/[[tyramine]]s and the breakdown of some [[Phenolic content in wine|phenolic compounds in wine]] that carry the chemical messenger for [[serotonin]].&lt;ref name="Robinson_2006" /&gt;{{rp|341–2}} One culprit that is regularly dismissed by [[allergist]]s as an unlikely cause of red wine headaches is [[sulfite]]s which are used as a [[preservative]] in wine.&lt;ref name="MacNeil pg 34"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = MacNeil K | title = The Wine Bible'' | page = 34 | publisher = Workman Publishing | date = 2001 | isbn = 1-56305-434-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wine, like other alcoholic beverages, is a [[diuretic]] which promotes [[dehydration]] that can lead to headaches (such as the case often experienced with [[hangover]]s).&lt;ref name="Miscellany"/&gt; In 2006, researchers from the [[University of California, Davis]] announced finding from [[genetic mapping]] that [[amino acids in wine]] that have been slightly modified by the fermentation process may be the cause of wine-related headaches. The research suggest changes in fermentation techniques may help alleviate the risk for wine drinkers sensitive to these amino acids.&lt;ref name="wine pros"&gt;{{cite web |first=Jim |last=LaMar | name-list-format = vanc |url=http://www.winepros.org/wine101/wine-health.htm |title=Wine and Health |publisher=Wine Pros}}{{self-published inline|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Calorie intake===
{{See also|Alcohol and weight}}
[[File:Annibale Carracci The Beaneater.jpg|right|thumb|Wine has a long history of being [[wine and food pairing|paired with food]] and may help reduce calorie intake by suppressing [[appetite]].]]

{{cquote|Alcohol can stimulate the appetite so it is better to drink it with food. When alcohol is mixed with food, it can slow the stomach's emptying time and potentially decrease the amount of food consumed at the meal.&lt;ref name="diet"/&gt;}}

Compared to many [[beer]]s and non-diet [[soft drink|soda]]s, a serving of wine has a moderate amount of [[calories]]. A standard 5 [[fluid ounce|fl oz]] (150&amp;nbsp;ml) serving of red wine (based on an average [[alcohol content]] of 13%) contains approximately 106 [[calories]] and 2.51&amp;nbsp;g of [[carbohydrates]]. A similar serving of white wine contains approximately 100 calories and 1.18&amp;nbsp;g of carbohydrates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | work = davidstuff.com | url = http://www.davidstuff.com/wine/calories.htm | title = Wine Calorie Chart | access-date = 29 July 2009 }}{{self-published inline|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychological and social===
Danish epidemiological studies suggest that a number of psychological health benefits are associated with drinking wine.  In a study testing this idea, Mortensen et al. (2001) measured socioeconomic status, education, [[IQ]], personality, psychiatric symptoms, and health related behaviors, which included alcohol consumption.  The analysis was then broken down into groups of those who drank beer, those who drank wine, and then those who did and did not drink at all.  The results showed that for both men and women drinking wine was related to higher parental social status, parental education and the social status of the subjects.  When the subjects were given an IQ test, wine drinkers consistently scored higher IQs than their counterpart beer drinkers.  The average difference of IQ between wine and beer drinkers was 18 points.  In regards to psychological functioning, personality, and other health-related behaviors, the study found wine drinkers to operate at optimal levels while beer drinkers performed below optimal levels. As these social and psychological factors also correlate with health outcomes, they represent a plausible explanation for at least some of the apparent health benefits of wine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mortensen EL, Jensen HH, Sanders SA, Reinisch JM | title = Better psychological functioning and higher social status may largely explain the apparent health benefits of wine: a study of wine and beer drinking in young Danish adults | journal = Archives of Internal Medicine | volume = 161 | issue = 15 | pages = 1844–8 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11493125 | doi = 10.1001/archinte.161.15.1844 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Heavy metals==
In 2008, researchers from [[Kingston University]] in London discovered red wine&lt;ref&gt;The sample wine was declared to be "a Shiraz from Southeast Australia", although no specific vintage, producer or wine region was stated in the report.&lt;/ref&gt; to contain high levels of [[toxic metals]] relative to other beverages in the sample. Although the metal [[ions]], which included [[chromium]], [[copper]], [[iron]], [[manganese]], [[nickel]], [[vanadium]] and [[zinc]], were also present in other plant-based beverages, the sample wine tested significantly higher for all metal ions, especially vanadium.&lt;ref name=hague&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hague T, Petroczi A, Andrews PL, Barker J, Naughton DP | title = Determination of metal ion content of beverages and estimation of target hazard quotients: a comparative study | journal = Chemistry Central Journal | volume = 2 | pages = 13 | date = June 2008 | pmid = 18578877 | pmc = 2443149 | doi = 10.1186/1752-153X-2-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Risk assessment was calculated using "[[target hazard quotients]]" (THQ), a method of quantifying health concerns associated with lifetime exposure to chemical pollutants. Developed by the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] in the US and used mainly to examine [[seafood]], a THQ of less than 1 represents no concern while, for example, [[Mercury in fish|mercury level]]s in fish calculated to have THQs of between 1 and 5 would represent cause for concern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wang X, Sato T, Xing B, Tao S | title = Health risks of heavy metals to the general public in Tianjin, China via consumption of vegetables and fish | journal = The Science of the Total Environment | volume = 350 | issue = 1-3 | pages = 28–37 | date = November 2005 | pmid = 16227070 | doi = 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2004.09.044 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The researchers stressed that a single glass of wine would not lead to metal poisoning, pointing out that their THQ calculations were based on the average person drinking one-third of a bottle of wine (250&amp;nbsp;ml) every day between the ages of 18 and 80. However the "combined THQ values" for metal ions in the red wine they analyzed were reported to be as high as 125.&lt;ref name=hague /&gt; A subsequent study by the same university using a [[meta analysis]] of data based on wine samples from a selection of mostly [[Europe]]an countries found equally high levels of vanadium in many red wines, showing combined THQ values in the range of 50 to 200, with some as high as 350.&lt;ref name=naughton&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Naughton DP, Petróczi A | title = Heavy metal ions in wines: meta-analysis of target hazard quotients reveal health risks | journal = Chemistry Central Journal | volume = 2 | pages = 22 | date = October 2008 | pmid = 18973648 | pmc = 2628338 | doi = 10.1186/1752-153X-2-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The findings sparked immediate controversy due to several issues: the study's reliance on [[secondary data]]; the assumption that all wines contributing to that data were representative of the countries stated; and the grouping together of poorly understood high-concentration ions, such as vanadium, with relatively low-level, common ions such as copper and manganese. Some publications pointed out that the lack of identifiable wines and grape varieties, specific producers or even wine regions, provided only misleading generalizations that should not be relied upon in choosing wines.&lt;ref name=ws&gt;[http://www.winespectator.com/webfeature/show/id/Study-of-Wines-Heavy-Metal-Hazard-Raises-Doubts-Among-Other-Experts_4444 Study of Wine's Heavy Metal Hazard Raises Doubts Among Other Experts] Wine Spectator, November 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nhs&gt;[http://www.nhs.uk/news/2008/10October/Pages/Metalsinwine.aspx Metal in wine], UK NHS news bulletin, October 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In a news bulletin following the widespread reporting of the findings, the UK's [[National Health Service]] (NHS) were also concerned that "the way the researchers added together hazards from different metals to produce a final score for individual wines may not be particularly meaningful".&lt;ref name=nhs /&gt; Commentators in the US questioned the relevance of seafood-based THQ assessments to [[agriculture|agricultural]] produce, with the [[Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau|TTB]], responsible for testing imports for metal ion contamination, have not detected an increased risk. George Solas, quality assessor for the Canadian [[Liquor Control Board of Ontario]] (LCBO) claimed that the levels of heavy metal contamination reported were within the permitted levels for drinking water in tested [[reservoir]]s.&lt;ref name=ws /&gt;

Whereas the NHS also described calls for improved [[wine label]]ing as an "extreme response" to research which provided "few solid answers", they acknowledged the authors call for further research to investigate wine production, including the influence that grape variety, soil type, geographical region, [[insecticide]]s, containment vessels and seasonal variations may have on metal ion uptake.&lt;ref name=nhs /&gt;

== Chemical composition ==
=== Natural phenols and polyphenols ===
Although red wine contains many chemicals under [[basic research]] for their potential health benefits, [[resveratrol]] has been particularly well studied and evaluated by regulatory authorities, such as the [[European Food Safety Authority]] and US [[Food and Drug Administration]] which identified it and other such [[polyphenol|phenolic]] compounds as not sufficiently understood to confirm their role as [[physiology|physiological]] [[antioxidants]].&lt;ref name="efsa"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://efsa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2903/j.efsa.2010.1489|title=Scientific Opinion on the substantiation of health claims related to various food(s)/food constituent(s) and protection of cells from premature aging, antioxidant activity, antioxidant content and antioxidant properties, and protection of DNA, proteins and lipids from oxidative damage pursuant to Article 13(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/20061|last=|first=|date=2010|website=|publisher=European Food Safety Authority|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=4 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=roles/&gt;

[[Cinnamate]]s have been shown to have more antioxidant activity when exposed in vitro to the [[Fenton reaction]] (catalytic Fe(II) with hydrogen peroxide) than the other natural phenols present in wine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gislason NE, Currie BL, Waterhouse AL | title = Novel antioxidant reactions of cinnamates in wine | journal = Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry | volume = 59 | issue = 11 | pages = 6221–6 | date = June 2011 | pmid = 21561133 | doi = 10.1021/jf200115y }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Resveratrol===
{{Main article|Resveratrol}}
Research on potential health effects of resveratrol is in its infancy and the long-term effects of supplementation in humans are not known.&lt;ref name="efsa"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Connecticut Post 2009"&gt;The Connecticut Post, "Selling resveratrol: Wonder drug or snake oil?," 08/04/2009, by Melissa Healy for the Los Angeles Times news service&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gehm BD, McAndrews JM, Chien PY, Jameson JL 1997 14138–43"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gehm BD, McAndrews JM, Chien PY, Jameson JL | title = Resveratrol, a polyphenolic compound found in grapes and wine, is an agonist for the estrogen receptor | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 94 | issue = 25 | pages = 14138–43 | date = December 1997 | pmid = 9391166 | pmc = 28446 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.94.25.14138 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Resveratrol is a [[stilbenoid]] [[Phenolic content in wine|phenolic compound found in wine]] produced in the grape skins and leaves of grape vines. It has received considerable attention in both the [[News media|media]] and medical research community for its potential health benefits&lt;ref name="Robinson_2006" /&gt;{{rp|569}} which remain unproven in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=EFSA Panel on Dietetic Products|first=Nutrition and Allergies (NDA)|date=2010-02-01|title=Scientific Opinion on the substantiation of health claims related to various food(s)/food constituent(s) and protection of cells from premature aging, antioxidant activity, antioxidant content and antioxidant properties, and protection of DNA, proteins and lipids from oxidative damage pursuant to Article 13(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.2903/j.efsa.2010.1489/abstract|journal=EFSA Journal|language=en|volume=8|issue=2|pages=n/a–n/a|doi=10.2903/j.efsa.2010.1489|issn=1831-4732}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=roles/&gt;

The production and concentration of resveratrol is not equal among all the varieties of [[grape varieties|wine grapes]]. Differences in [[clones (plant)|clones]], [[rootstock]], ''Vitis'' species as well as climate conditions can affect the production of resveratrol. Also, because resveratrol is part of the defence mechanism in grapevines against [[vine diseases|attack]] by fungi or [[grape disease]], the degree of exposure to fungal infection and grape diseases also appear to play a role. The [[Muscadinia]] family of vines, which has adapted over time through exposure to [[North American]] grape diseases such as [[phylloxera]], has some of the highest concentrations of resveratrol among wine grapes. Among the European ''[[Vitis vinifera]]'', grapes derived from the [[Burgundian (wine)|Burgundian]] [[Pinot (grape)|Pinot]] family tend to have substantially higher amounts of resveratrol than grapes derived from the Cabernet family of [[Bordeaux (wine)|Bordeaux]]. Wine regions with cooler, wetter climates that are more prone to grape disease and fungal attacks such as [[Oregon wine|Oregon]] and [[New York wine|New York]] tend to produce grapes with higher concentrations of resveratrol than warmer, dry climates like [[California wine|California]] and [[Australia wine|Australia]].&lt;ref name="Robinson_2006" /&gt;{{rp|569}}

Although red wine and white vine varieties produce similar amounts of resveratrol, red wine contains more than white, since red wines are produced by [[maceration (wine)|maceration]] (soaking the grape skins in the mash).  Other winemaking techniques, such as the use of certain strains of [[yeast (wine)|yeast]] during [[fermentation (wine)|fermentation]] or [[lactic acid bacteria]] during [[malolactic fermentation]], can have an influence on the amount of resveratrol left in the resulting wines. Similarly the use of certain [[fining agents]] during the [[clarification and stabilization of wine]] can strip the wine of some resveratrol molecules.&lt;ref name="Robinson_2006" /&gt;{{rp|569}}

The prominence of resveratrol in the news and its association with positive health benefits has encouraged some wineries to highlight it in their marketing. In the early 21st century, the Oregon producer [[Willamette Valley Vineyards]] sought approval from the [[Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau]] (TTB) to state on their [[wine labels]] the resveratrol levels of their wines which ranged from 19 to 71 [[micromole]]s per liter (higher than the average 10 micromoles per liter in most red wines). The TTB gave preliminary approval to the winery, making it the first to use such information on its labels.&lt;ref name="Miscellany"/&gt; While resveratrol is the most widely publicized, there are other phenolic components in wine that have been the focus of medical research for potential health benefits, including the compounds [[catechin]] and [[quercetin]],&lt;ref name="Robinson_2006" /&gt;{{rp|569}} none of which has been proven to have any health value in humans.&lt;ref name="efsa"/&gt;&lt;ref name=roles/&gt;

===Anthocyanins===
Red grapes are high in [[anthocyanins]] which are the source of the color of various fruits, such as red grapes. The darker the red wine, the more [[anthocyanins]] present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Muñoz-Espada AC, Wood KV, Bordelon B, Watkins BA | title = Anthocyanin quantification and radical scavenging capacity of Concord, Norton, and Marechal Foch grapes and wines | journal = Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry | volume = 52 | issue = 22 | pages = 6779–86 | date = November 2004 | pmid = 15506816 | doi = 10.1021/jf040087y }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{original research inline|date=July 2014}}

Following dietary ingestion, anthocyanins undergo rapid and extensive metabolism that makes the biological effects presumed from in vitro studies unlikely to apply in vivo.&lt;ref name="roles"&gt;{{citation |title= New Roles for Polyphenols. A 3-Part report on Current Regulations &amp; the State of Science | vauthors = Gross P|date= March 1, 2009 |publisher= Nutraceuticals World |url= http://www.nutraceuticalsworld.com/issues/2009-03/view_features/new-roles-for-polyphenols/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Williams&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Williams RJ, Spencer JP, Rice-Evans C | title = Flavonoids: antioxidants or signalling molecules? | journal = Free Radical Biology &amp; Medicine | volume = 36 | issue = 7 | pages = 838–49 | date = April 2004 | pmid = 15019969 | doi = 10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2004.01.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although anthocyanins are under [[basic research|basic]] and early-stage [[clinical trial|clinical]] research for a variety of disease conditions, there exists no sufficient evidence that they have any beneficial effect in the human body.&lt;ref name=roles/&gt; The US [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] has issued warning letters, e.g.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/ICECI/EnforcementActions/WarningLetters/ucm202832.htm|title= Redco Foods, Inc.|date=22 February 2010|publisher=Wagner, RF, Inspections, Compliance, Enforcement, and Criminal Investigations, US FDA|access-date=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; to emphasize that anthocyanins are not a defined [[essential nutrient|nutrient]], cannot be assigned a [[Daily Value|dietary content level]] and are not regulated as a [[drug]] to treat any human disease.&lt;ref name=roles/&gt;

==History of wine in medicine==
{{See also|History of medicine}}
Early medicine was intimately tied with [[religion]] and the [[supernatural]], with early practitioners often being [[priest]]s and [[magician (paranormal)|magician]]s. Wine's close association with ritual made it a logical tool for these early medical practices. Tablets from Sumeria and papyri from Egypt dating to 2200 BC include recipes for wine based medicines, making wine the oldest documented human-made medicine.&lt;ref name="Robinson_2006" /&gt;{{rp|433}}

===Early history===
[[File:Hippocrates Light.JPG|thumb|[[Hippocrates]], the father of modern medicine, prescribed wine for a variety of ailments including [[lethargy]] and [[diarrhea]].]]
[[File:De medicina V00117 00000006.tif|thumb|''De medicina'']]
When the [[Greeks]] introduced a more systematized approach to medicine, wine retained its prominent role. The Greek physician [[Hippocrates]] considered wine a part of a healthy [[diet (nutrition)|diet]], and advocated its use as a [[disinfectant]] for wounds, as well as a medium in which to mix other drugs for consumption by the patient. He also prescribed wine as a cure for various ailments ranging from diarrhea and lethargy to pain during childbirth.&lt;ref name="Robinson_2006" /&gt;{{rp|433}}

The medical practices of the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] involved the use of wine in a similar manner. In his 1st-century work ''[[De Medicina]]'', the Roman encyclopedist [[Aulus Cornelius Celsus]] detailed a long list of [[Ancient Greek (wine)|Greek]] and [[Roman wine]]s used for medicinal purposes. While treating [[gladiators]] in [[Asia Minor]], the Roman physician [[Galen]] would use wine as a disinfectant for all types of wounds, and even soaked exposed [[bowels]] before returning them to the body. During his four years with the gladiators, only five deaths occurred, compared to sixty deaths under the watch of the physician before him.&lt;ref name="nutton73"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nutton V | title = The chronology of Galen's early career | journal = Classical Quarterly | volume = 23 | issue = 1 | pages = 158–71 | date = May 1973 | pmid = 11624046 | doi = 10.1017/S0009838800036600 | jstor = 638137 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religion still played a significant role in promoting wine's use for health. The Jewish [[Talmud]] noted wine to be ''"the foremost of all medicines: wherever wine is lacking, medicines become necessary."'' In his [[first epistle to Timothy]], [[Paul the Apostle]] recommended that his [[Saint Timothy|young colleague]] drink a little wine every now and then for the benefit of his stomach and digestion. While the [[Islamic]] [[Koran]] contained [[Islamic dietary laws#Alcohol|restrictions on all alcohol]], Islamic doctors such as the Persian [[Avicenna]] in the 11th century AD noted that wine was an efficient digestive aid but, because of the laws, were limited to use as a disinfectant while dressing wounds. [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Monastery|monasteries]] during the [[Middle Ages]] also regularly used wine for medical treatments.&lt;ref name="Robinson_2006" /&gt;{{rp|433}} So closely tied was the role of wine and medicine, that the first printed book on wine was written in the 14th century by a physician, [[Arnaldus de Villa Nova]], with lengthy essays on wine's suitability for treatment of a variety of medical ailments such [[dementia]] and [[sinusitis|sinus]] problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Hugh |last=Johnson | name-list-format = vanc |title=Vintage: The Story of Wine |page=126 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Risks of consumption===
The lack of safe [[drinking water]] may have been one reason for wine's popularity in medicine. Wine was still being used to sterilize water as late as the [[Hamburg]] [[cholera]] epidemic of 1892 in order to control the spread of the disease. However, the late 19th century and early 20th century ushered in a period of changing views on the role of [[alcohol]] and, by extension, wine in health and society. The [[Temperance movement]] began to gain steam by touting the ills of [[alcoholism]], which was eventually defined by the medical establishment as [[Disease theory of alcoholism|a disease]]. Studies of the [[Long-term effects of alcohol|long]]- and [[short-term effects of alcohol]] caused many in the medical community to reconsider the role of wine in medicine and diet.&lt;ref name="Robinson_2006" /&gt;{{rp|433}} Soon, public opinion turned against consumption of alcohol in any form, leading to [[Prohibition in the United States]] and other countries. In some areas, wine was able to maintain a limited role, such as an exemption from Prohibition in the United States for "[[therapeutic]] wines" that were sold legally in drug stores. These wines were marketed for their supposed medicinal benefits, but some wineries used this measure as a loophole to sell large quantities of wine for recreational consumption. In response, the United States government issued a mandate requiring producers to include an [[emetic]] additive that would induce vomiting above the consumption of a certain dosage level.&lt;ref name="Miscellany"/&gt;

Throughout the mid to early 20th century, health advocates pointed to the risk of alcohol consumption and the role it played in a variety of ailments such as [[blood disorders]], [[high blood pressure]], [[cancer]], [[infertility]], [[liver damage]], [[muscle atrophy]], [[psoriasis]], [[skin infections]], [[stroke]]s, and long-term [[brain damage]]. Studies showed a connection between alcohol consumption among pregnant mothers and an increased risk of [[mental retardation]] and physical abnormalities in what became known as [[fetal alcohol syndrome]], prompting the use of [[warning labels]] on alcohol-containing products in several countries.&lt;ref name="Robinson_2006" /&gt;{{rp|341–2}}

===French paradox and the benefits of consumption===
{{main article|French paradox}}
[[File:Château Lafite Rothschild and glass.jpg|250px|right|thumb|The French have a diet that is high in full-fat dairy products such as [[cheese]]s, and also have low rates of [[heart disease]]. One possible factor contributing to this "[[French paradox]]" is the regular consumption of [[red wine]].]]
The 1990s and early 21st century saw a renewed interest in the health benefits of wine, ushered in by increasing research suggesting that moderate wine drinkers have lower mortality rates than heavy drinkers or [[teetotalers]].&lt;ref name="Robinson_2006" /&gt;{{rp|341–2}} In November 1991, the U.S. news program ''60 Minutes'' aired a broadcast on the so-called "[[French Paradox]]". Featuring the research work of [[Bordeaux]] scientist [[Serge Renaud]], the broadcast dealt with the seemingly [[paradox]]ical relationship between the high fat/high dairy diets of [[French people]] and the low occurrence of cardiovascular disease among them. The broadcast drew parallels to the American and British diets which also contained high levels of fat and dairy but which featured high incidences of heart disease. One of the theories proposed by Renaud in the broadcast was that moderate consumption of red wine was a risk-reducing factor for the French and that wine could have more positive health benefits yet to be studied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=P. |last=Mansoon |url=http://www.winespectator.com/Wine/Archives/Show_Article/0,1275,39,00.html |title=The Father of the French Paradox |work=Wine Spectator |date=March 15, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the ''60 Minutes'' broadcast, sales of red wine in the United States jumped 44% over previous years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | vauthors = Franz M |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/05/03/AR2005050300419_pf.html |title=Merlot's Bad Press |work=[[Washington Post]] |date=May 4, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This changing view of wine can be seen in the evolution of the language used in the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] [[Dietary Guidelines]]. The 1990 edition of the guidelines contained the blanket statement that ''"wine has no net health benefit"''. By 1995, the wording had been changed to allow moderate consumption with meals providing the individual had no other alcohol-related health risk.&lt;ref name="wine pros"/&gt; From a research perspective, scientists began differentiating alcohol consumption among the various classes of beverages – wine, beer, and spirits. This distinction allowed studies to highlight the positive medical benefits of wine apart from the mere presence of alcohol. However wine drinkers tend to share similar lifestyle habits – better diets, regular exercise, non-smoking – that may in themselves be a factor in the supposed positive health benefits compared to drinkers of beer and spirits or those who abstain completely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | vauthors = Mansson P | url = http://www.winespectator.com/Wine/Main/Feature_Basic_Template/0,1197,1101,00.html |title=Eat Well, Drink Wisely, Live Longer |work=Wine Spectator |date=November 29, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[independence]] in 1975, the French withdrew their medical teams, leaving the three islands' already rudimentary health care system in a state of severe crisis. French assistance was eventually resumed, and other nations also contributed medical assistance to the young republic. Despite improvements in [[life expectancy]] and the [[infant mortality rate]], the [[Comoros]] in 1993 continued to face public health problems characteristic of developing countries.

==Maternal and child health care==
The 2010 maternal mortality rate per 100,000 births for the Comoros is 340. This is compared with 225.3 in 2008 and 449.9 in 1990. The under 5 mortality rate, per 1,000 births is 105 and the neonatal mortality as a percentage of under 5's mortality is 35. In the Comoros the number of midwives per 1,000 live births is 9 and the lifetime risk of death for pregnant women 1 in 71.&lt;ref name="SOWMY"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/sowmy/report/home.html|title=The State Of The World's Midwifery|publisher=United Nations Population Fund|accessdate=August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Life expectancy at birth was estimated at fifty-six years in 1990, up from fifty-one years in 1980. The crude birthrate was forty-eight per 1,000 and the crude death rate, twelve per 1,000 according to 1989 statistics. All three of these figures were close to the averages for sub-Saharan Africa. The rate of infant mortality per 1,000 live births was eighty-nine in 1991, down from 113 in 1980. The 1990 average rate for sub-Saharan Africa was 107.

==Disease==
[[Malaria]] was ubiquitous in the islands, with 80 to 90 percent of the population said to be affected by the disease. Other prevalent maladies included [[tuberculosis]], [[leprosy]], and parasitic diseases. In 1989 about half of all children one year old or younger had been immunized against tuberculosis, [[diphtheria]], [[pertussis]], [[tetanus]], [[polio]], and [[measles]], a proportion roughly comparable to the rate of immunization among other states in sub-Saharan Africa. 

Per capita daily [[Calorie intake|caloric intake]] in 1988 was 2,046, about average for sub-Saharan Africa but only a little better than 90 percent of daily requirements. Children were most often the victims of [[malnutrition]]. Their generally poor diets were deficient in [[protein]] in part because local custom discouraged the feeding of [[fish]] to children. The scarcity of [[Potable water|safe drinking water]]—available to about one in three Comorans—made intestinal parasites a problem and compounded malnutrition, with children again being the main victims.

The [[World Bank]] estimated that in 1993 the Comoros had one [[physician]] per 6,582 Comorans, a marked improvement over the ratio of one to 13,810 reported in 1983. Comparable data for sub-Saharan Africa as a whole were not available; however, it appeared that Comorans enjoyed a more favorable ratio than many of their neighbors in East Africa and the Indian Ocean.

Despite improvements in life expectancy, infant mortality, and the number of physicians, the overall quality of care remained poor. About 80 percent of the population lives within one hour's walk of a health facility, usually headed by a trained [[nurse]], but paramedical staff are in short supply and many health facilities are in poor condition. Some international medical aid has been provided, mostly by [[France]] and the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO).

Although the Comoros lacks homegrown [[narcotics]], the islands are used as a transit site for drugs coming mainly from [[Madagascar]]. In view of international concern about drug trafficking, in 1993 France began providing technical expertise in this field to the Comoros. In addition, the World Bank in a 1994 report pointed out the "high prevalence of sexually transmitted diseases and the low use of condoms" as a significant health threat with regard to the spread of [[acquired immune deficiency syndrome]] (AIDS), which already affected the islands. However, in the period prior to 1990 and extending through 1992, the WHO reported that the Comoros had a very low incidence of AIDS—a total of three cases with no case reported in 1992, or an overall case rate of 0.1 per 100,000 population.

After the Bolivarian Revolution, extensive [[inoculation]] programs and the availability of low- or no-cost health care provided by the [[Venezuelan Institute of Social Security]] made [[Venezuela]]'s health care infrastructure one of the more advanced in [[Latin America]]. However, by 2015, the Venezuelan health care system had collapsed.&lt;ref name=BBCCollapse&gt;{{cite news|last1=Franks|first1=Tim|title=Venezuelan healthcare in collapse as economy ails|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-34983075|accessdate=7 December 2015|publisher=BBC News Latin America|date=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WSJCrumble&gt;{{cite news|last1=Forero|first1=Juan|title=Venezuelans Suffer Amid Crumbling Health System|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/venezuelans-suffer-amid-crumbling-health-system-1426265474|accessdate=7 December 2015|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|date=13 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Pre-Bolivarian Revolution===

====1970s====
Venezuelan state governments operated only 5 facilities in 1979, down from about 60 hospitals in 1970 since the Ministry of Health and Social Assistance (MSAS) took over many of the hospitals.&lt;ref name=ITA1981&gt;{{cite book|title=Business America|date=7 September 1981|publisher=[[International Trade Administration]]|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=14–15|accessdate=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978, a presidential election year, medical sales in Venezuela hit an all-time high at the time and dropped in 1979. In 1979, there were approximately 250 hospitals in Venezuela with MSAS operating the majority of 58%. Venezuela had a shortage of medical professionals and hospital beds in the late 1970s due to highly increasing population and the lack of specializing in being a specific medical technician. The lack of both professionals and beds was higher in rural areas compared to more populated areas. Between 1978 and 1980, Venezuela had 14,771 doctors, 8,805 nurses and 28,04 nursing auxiliaries.&lt;ref name=ITA1981/&gt;

====1980s====
Under the Sixth National Plan of [[Luis Herrera Campins]], the Campins government planned to increase medical funding by 9.7% annually between 1981 and 1985, with medical expenditures planned to reach $2.1 billion in 1985. $1.2 billion were designated to the construction of new facilities to combat bed shortages, with a main focus on establishing [[clinic]]s in order to avoid inefficiency of larger hospitals. Rehabilitation of handicapped individuals and the concentration on heart disease, the leading cause of death in Venezuela, were also focused on in the Sixth National Plan. Medical professionals in Venezuela were "extremely U.S. oriented", with most doctors attending post-graduate work in the United States, were able to speak English, read U.S. medical journals and attended gatherings of United States medical experts. In 1981, over 70% of healthcare services were government administered.&lt;ref name=ITA1981/&gt;

Foreign medical equipment developed abroad was quickly adopted and shipped to Venezuela with most of the country's medical goods needing to be imported. In 1980, Venezuela imported 47% of medical goods from the United States, 13% from Germany, 8% from Japan and 3% from the United Kingdom. The majority of medical equipment was distributed by a conglomerate of about 45 distributors known as Associacion Venezolana de Distribuidores de Equips Medicos (AVEDEM) while 15% of medical products were distributed by smaller entities.&lt;ref name=ITA1981/&gt;

===Bolivarian Revolution===
Following the Bolivarian Revolution and the establishment of the Bolivarian government, initial healthcare practices were promising with the installation of free healthcare and the assistance received from Cuban medical professionals providing aid. The Bolivarian government's failure to concentrate on healthcare for Venezuelans, the reduction of healthcare spending and government corruption eventually affected medical practices in Venezuela; causing avoidable deaths along with an emigration of medical professionals to other countries.&lt;ref name=BGapril2015&gt;{{cite news|title=Venezuela’s medical crisis requires world’s attention|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/editorials/2015/04/28/medical-crisis-venezuela-requires-world-attention/EAgdzuzc9WebDGCZ0QY8GI/story.html|accessdate=17 May 2015|agency=''[[The Boston Globe]]''|date=28 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FPchavezcare&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wilson|first1=Peter|title=The Collapse of Chávezcare|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2015/04/27/chavez-maduro-healthcare-venezuela-cuba/|accessdate=17 May 2015|agency=''[[Foreign Policy]]''|date=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Venezuela's reliance of imported goods and its complicated exchange rates initiated under [[Hugo Chávez]] led to increasing shortages during the late-2000s and into the 2010s that affected the availability of medicines and medical equipment in the country.&lt;ref name=FPchavezcare/&gt;

====2000s====
[[File:Venezuela's health expenditure; 1999 -.png|350px|thumbnail|right|Healthcare spending by percentage of Venezuela's GDP.&lt;br&gt;'''Source:''' [http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.XPD.TOTL.ZS?page=3 World Bank]]]

Throughout Hugo Chávez's presidency, the Health Ministry changed ministers multiple times. According to a high-ranking official of Venezuela's Health Ministry, the ministers were treated as scapegoats whenever issues with public health arose in Venezuela.&lt;ref name=FPchavezcare/&gt; The official also explained how Health Ministry officials would also perform illicit acts in order to enrich themselves by selling goods designated to public healthcare to others.&lt;ref name=FPchavezcare/&gt;

====2010s====
{{details|Shortages in Venezuela}}
The Venezuelan government stopped publishing medical statistics in 2010.&lt;ref name=APdoc&gt;{{cite news|title=Doctors say Venezuela's health care in collapse|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/doctors-say-venezuelas-health-care-collapse|accessdate=22 February 2014|newspaper=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 when Venezuela's economy was facing difficulties, Venezuela's medical atmosphere deteriorated. The Bolivarian government did not supply enough dollars for medical supplies among healthcare providers; with doctors saying that 9 of 10 of large hospitals had only 7% of required supplies with private doctors reporting many patients that are "impossible" to count are dying from easily treated illnesses due to the "downward sliding economy" in 2014.&lt;ref name=APdoc/&gt; Due to such complications, many Venezuelans died avoidable deaths with medical professionals having to use limited resources to use methods that were replaced decades ago.&lt;ref name=BGapril2015/&gt; In February 2014, doctors at [[University of Caracas Medical Hospital]] stopped performing surgeries due to the lack of supplies, even though nearly 3,000 people require surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Médicos del Hospital Universitario de Caracas suspenden cirugías por falta de insumos|url=http://globovision.com/articulo/medicos-del-hospital-universitario-paralizan-procedimientos-quirurgicos-tras-falta-de-insumos|accessdate=21 February 2014|newspaper=Globovision|date=21 February 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140228074857/http://globovision.com/articulo/medicos-del-hospital-universitario-paralizan-procedimientos-quirurgicos-tras-falta-de-insumos|archivedate=28 February 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2014, the executive director of the Venezuelan Association of Hospitals and Clinics explained how in less than a month, shortages of 53 medical products rose to 109 products and explained how the [[CADIVI]] system is to blame since 86% of supplies are imported&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fernanda Zambrano|first=María|title=Clínicas del país presentan fallas en 109 productos|url=http://www1.unionradio.net/actualidadur/nota/visornota.aspx?id=168181&amp;tpCont=1&amp;idSec=3|accessdate=20 March 2014|newspaper=Union Radio|date=19 March 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140320023728/http://www1.unionradio.net/actualidadur/nota/visornota.aspx?id=168181&amp;tpCont=1&amp;idSec=3|archivedate=20 March 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; with private sector hospitals claiming they owe suppliers billions of dollars in order to pay for debts.&lt;ref name=ReutersDOCTOR&gt;{{cite news|last=Chinea|first=Eyanir|title=Sin dólares para importar medicinas, salud de Venezuela en terapia intensiva|url=http://lta.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idLTASIEA2J03I20140320|accessdate=20 March 2014|newspaper=Reuters (Latin America)|date=20 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Parque Cristal Protestas 2017 09.jpg|thumb|left|Venezuelans [[2017 Venezuelan protests|protesting in 2017]] for medicine due to the [[shortages in Venezuela]]]]

In early 2015, only 35% of hospital beds were available and 50% of operating rooms could not function due to the lack of resources.&lt;ref name=BGapril2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=FPchavezcare/&gt; In March 2015, a Venezuelan NGO, Red de Medicos por la Salud, reported that there was a 68% shortage of surgical supplies and a 70% shortage of medicines in Venezuelan pharmacies.&lt;ref name=FPchavezcare/&gt; In May 2015, the Venezuelan Medical Federation said that 15,000 doctors had left the public health care system because of shortages of drugs and equipment and poor pay. In August 2015 [[Human Rights Watch]] said “We have rarely seen access to essential medicines deteriorate as quickly as it has in Venezuela except in war zones.”
By the end of 2015, the Bolivarian government reported that of all Venezuelans visiting public hospitals in the year, one-of-three patients died.&lt;ref name="NBC1in3"&gt;{{cite news|title=In deteriorating Venezuela, a kid's scraped knee can be life or death|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/venezuela-health-crisis-means-kid-s-scraped-knee-can-be-n659211|accessdate=7 October 2016|work=[[NBC News]]|date=5 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2015 Venezuela had 30% of all reported malaria cases in the Americas and more even than Brazil, which has a much larger population.&lt;ref name=“veconomist” &gt;{{cite news|author=J.R.A.|title=Why malaria is spreading in Venezuela|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2017/10/economist-explains-1|work=[[The Economist]]|date=12 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018 Venezuela is suffering from acute shortages of food and medicines.

==State and private==
[[Privately held company|Private]] hospitals and clinics and the qualifications of their medical personnel are comparable to U.S. standards. Private health services are costly and "full to bursting."
The Venezuelan government has accused private hospitals of profiteering. 2,000 doctors left the country between 2006 and 2008.&lt;ref name=econ&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.economist.com/daily/news/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10870071&amp;fsrc=nwl | work=The Economist | title=Don't stand so close to me | date=21 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Overall roughly 1 in 5 Venezuelans have private health insurance.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

'''Hereditary breast–ovarian cancer syndromes''' ('''HBOC''') are [[cancer syndrome]]s that produce higher than normal levels of [[breast cancer]] and [[ovarian cancer]] in genetically related [[families]] (either one individual had both, or several individuals in the [[pedigree chart|pedigree]] had one or the other disease). The hereditary factors may be proven or suspected to cause the pattern of breast and ovarian cancer occurrences in the family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cancer.stanford.edu/information/geneticsAndCancer/types/herbocs.html|title=Hereditary Breast Ovarian Cancer Syndrome (BRCA1 / BRCA2)|publisher=Stanford University|accessdate=2008-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==

A number of [[gene]]s are associated with HBOC.&lt;ref name=Morris /&gt; The most common of the known causes of HBOC are:
* [[BRCA mutation]]s:&lt;ref name=Morris /&gt;  Harmful mutations in the ''[[BRCA1]]'' and ''[[BRCA2]]'' genes can produce very high rates of breast and ovarian cancer, as well as increased rates of other cancers. Mutations in ''BRCA1'' are associated with a 39-46% risk of ovarian cancer and mutations in ''BRCA2'' are associated with a 10-27% risk of ovarian cancer.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ring|first=Kari L.|last2=Garcia|first2=Christine|last3=Thomas|first3=Martha H.|last4=Modesitt|first4=Susan C.|date=November 2017|title=Current and future role of genetic screening in gynecologic malignancies|journal=American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology|volume=217|issue=5|pages=512–521|doi=10.1016/j.ajog.2017.04.011|issn=1097-6868|pmid=28411145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other identified genes include:

* ''[[TP53]]'':  Mutations cause [[Li-Fraumeni syndrome]].  It produces particularly high rates of breast cancer among younger women with mutated genes, and despite being rare, 4% of women with breast cancer under age 30 have a mutation in this gene.&lt;ref name=Morris /&gt; 
* ''[[PTEN (gene)|PTEN]]'':  Mutations cause [[Cowden syndrome]], which produces [[hamartoma]]s (benign polyps) in the colon, skin growths, and other [[clinical sign]]s, as well as an increased risk for many cancers.&lt;ref name=Morris /&gt;
* ''[[CDH1 (gene)|CDH1]]'':  Mutations are associated with [[lobular breast cancer]] and [[gastric cancer]].&lt;ref name=Morris /&gt;
* ''[[STK11]]'':  Mutations produce [[Peutz–Jeghers syndrome]].  It is extremely rare, and creates a predisposition to breast cancer, intestinal cancer, and [[pancreatic cancer]].&lt;ref name=Morris /&gt;
* ''[[CHEK2]]'':  Approximately one out of 40 northern Europeans have a mutation in this gene, making it a common mutation.  Considered a moderate-risk mutation, it may double or triple the carrier's [[lifetime risk]] of breast cancer, and also increase the risk of [[colon cancer]] and [[prostate cancer]].&lt;ref name=Morris /&gt;
* ''[[Ataxia telangiectasia mutated|ATM]]'':  Mutations cause [[ataxia telangectasia]]; female carriers have approximately double the normal risk of developing breast cancer.&lt;ref name=Morris /&gt;
* ''[[PALB2]]'':  Studies vary in their estimate of the risk from mutations in this gene.  It may be moderate risk, or as high as ''BRCA2''.&lt;ref name=Morris /&gt;

Approximately 45% of HBOC cases involve unidentified genes, or multiple genes.&lt;ref name=Morris&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Morris| first1 = Joi L.| last2 = Gordon| first2 = Ora K.

== Prevention ==
People with ''BRCA1'' and ''BRCA2'' mutations are recommended to have a [[transvaginal ultrasound]] 1-2 times per year. Screening with [[CA-125]] is also recommended. Prophylactic [[Oophorectomy|salpingo-oophorectomy]] (removal of the ovaries and [[Fallopian tubes]] to prevent cancer) is recommended at age 35-40 for people with ''BRCA1'' mutations and at age 40-45 for people with ''BRCA2'' mutations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Hospicio de San José''' is a [[Catholic Church in the Philippines|Roman Catholic]] [[welfare]] institution in the [[City of Manila]], the [[Philippines]]. It is the first social welfare agency in the country, and as a [[foster care]] institution has been a home for orphans, the abandoned, [[special needs]], and the elderly.&lt;ref name=Hospicio&gt;[http://www.rcam.org/ministry/socialservices/hospicio.htm Hospicio de San Jose], Archdiocese of Manila, www.rcam.org, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
[[File:Pasig River, Ayala bridge, Hospicio de San Jose (Manila)(2018-02-05).jpg|thumb|The facility is situated in [[Isla de Convalecencia]].]]
''Hospicio de San José'' is located on [[Isla de Convalecencia]] ([[Spanish language in the Philippines|Spanish]], "Island of convalescence"), an [[eyot]] in the middle of the [[Pasig River]], and can only be accessed via Ayala Bridge. It was formerly located in the [[Pandacan, Manila|Pandacan]] district. From there, it was transferred to [[Intramuros]], [[Binondo]], [[Nagtahan]], and [[Echague]].  In 1810, the ''Hospicio'' was permanently relocated to Isla de Convalecencia.&lt;ref name=Hospicio/&gt;

==History==
Initially named the '''''Hospicio General''''' (General Hospice), ''Hospicio de San José'' was established during the [[History of the Philippines (1521-1898)|Spanish Era]] in October 1778 by Don Francisco Gómez Enríquez and his wife Doña Barbara Verzosa.  After being cured of a fever, Don Gómez Enríquez donated the sum of [[Philippine peso|₱]] 4,000 to found the hospice that would take care of [[Manila]]’s “poor and unwanted children”, the physically and mentally handicapped, and aging people. The initiative and example of Don Gómez Enríquez was followed by other charitable people of Manila.&lt;ref name=Hospicio/&gt;

==Administrators==
From 27 December 1810 and by Royal Decree, the hospice was governed by a [[Board of Directors]] chaired by the [[Archbishop of Manila]]. On 1 June 1866, through the suggestion to the [[Governor-General of the Philippines]] by a benefactor named Doña Margarita Róxas, the operation of the hospice became the responsibility of the [[Daughters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul]].&lt;ref name=Hospicio/&gt;

==Curriculum and programmes==
The hospice provides an outreach programme and a Christian, social and work-oriented formation programme. It is committed to assisting abandoned people to experience quality life with the aim of making them “agents of social transformation”.&lt;ref name=Hospicio/&gt;

==Present Condition==

Hospicio de San Jose has two historical markers. The first, in  English, was from the Historical Research and Markers Committee and was unveiled on October 17, 1939. In 1977, a second historical marker was given from the National Historical Institute and is in Tagalog. &lt;ref name="Marker"&gt;{{cite book|title=Historical Markers: Metropolitan Manila|date=1993|publisher=National Historical Institute|accessdate=31 Oct 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1939 Marker===

The first historical marker of '''Hospicio de San Jose''' was installed in October 17, 1939 at Ayala Boulevard, San Miguel, Manila. It was installed by Historical Research and Markers Committee.&lt;ref name="Marker" /&gt;

[[File:Surgeries conducted.jpg|thumb|The iknife shortens the duration of a cancer surgery by eliminating long waits for results from the histological pathologist who now determines the boundary between cancerous and healthy tissue]]

'''Onkoknife''', '''iKnife''', or '''intelligent scalpel''' ([[English language|English]]: Jedi knife, onkoknife; [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]: onkokés, intelligens sebészi kés) is a [[Surgical instrument|surgical]] knife, which tests tissue as it contacts it during an operation, and immediately gives information as to whether that tissue contains [[cancer]] cells.&lt;ref name="Balog et al 2013"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/scitranslmed.3005623 |pmid=23863833 |title=Intraoperative Tissue Identification Using Rapid Evaporative Ionization Mass Spectrometry |journal=Science Translational Medicine |volume=5 |issue=194 |pages=194ra93 |year=2013 |last1=Balog |first1=J |last2=Sasi-Szabo |first2=L |last3=Kinross |first3=J |last4=Lewis |first4=M. R |last5=Muirhead |first5=L. J |last6=Veselkov |first6=K |last7=Mirnezami |first7=R |last8=Dezso |first8=B |last9=Damjanovich |first9=L |last10=Darzi |first10=A |last11=Nicholson |first11=J. K |last12=Takats |first12=Z }}&lt;/ref&gt; During a surgery this information is given continuously to the surgeon, significantly accelerating biological tissue analysis and enabling removal of virtually all cancer cells. Electroknives have been in use since the 1920s and smart knife surgery is not limited only to cancer diseases, but the iKnife is limited to cancer cell detection in the vapor given off, however, since it can not properly detect and identify the type of [[bacteria]] found in tissues so well.

== Research and development ==
'''Zoltán Takáts''', [[Ph.D.]], a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] research [[chemist]] associated with [[Semmelweis University]], in [[Budapest]], invented the ''intelligent surgical knife''. He currently is Professor of Analytical Chemistry at [[Imperial College London]] (UK). His ''iKnife'' has been tested in three hospitals from 2010 through 2012. Following laboratory analysis of tissue samples in 302 patients that were included in a data base, they included 1624 of cancer and 1309 of non-cancer samples.

The current pilot version for the iKnife cost the creating Hungarian scientist, MediMass Ltd. (''Old Buda'' based company) participating in the research, colleagues at Imperial College, and the Hungarian government approximately £200 thousand (68 million HUF). According to Takáts, the investments will have been worth it, however, as the device is on a likely path to marketing.

The instrument has been acquired by the Massachusetts [[Waters Corporation]] for development by ''MediMass Ltd.'', which identifies it as substantive innovative technology labelled, "Intelligent late" and "REIMS", according to their press release on 23 July 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parameter.sk/rovat/technika-tudomany/2014/07/23/amerikai-ceg-vasarolta-fel-magyar-intelligens-kes-technologiat|title=Amerikai cég vásárolta fel a magyar Intelligens Kés technológiát|first=|last=parameter.sk|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The business transaction included all ''MediMass'' innovation, including patents, software, databases, and human resources related to the technology.

== Principle of operation ==

=== History of direct examination of biological tissue by mass spectrometry (MS) ===

Direct examination of biological tissue by [[mass spectrometry]] (MS) began in the 1970s, but at that time the next advance in technical conditions did not exist. The method did not provide any useful information on the chemical composition of the samples tested.&lt;ref&gt;INTELLIGENS SEBÉSZETI ESZKÖZ SZÖVETEK MŰTÉT KÖZBENI AZONOSÍTÁSA TÖMEGSPEKTROMETRIÁS MÓDSZERREL Szaniszló Tamás Dénes Júlia PhD-hallgató PhD, tudományos munkatárs Takáts Zoltán PhD, igazgató z.takats@imperial.ac.uk Semmelweis Egyetem CellScreen Alkalmazott KutatóközpontMagyar Tudomány • 2012/6&lt;/ref&gt; The first breakthrough came with desorption ionisation methods ([[Secondary ion mass spectrometry|secondary ionization mass spectrometry]] - SIMS, [[matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization]] - MALDI) a release said. Using these methods, after appropriate sample preparation, chemical biological tissue imaging analysis may be achieved.&lt;ref&gt;van Hove et al., 2010.{{full|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the end of the 1990s, it became apparent that mass spectrometry data in imaging studies showed a high degree of tissue specificity, that tissue histology could determine mass spectral information, and vice versa.&lt;ref name="Rompp2011"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s00216-011-4990-7 |pmid=21516518 |title=Mass spectrometry imaging with high resolution in mass and space (HR2 MSI) for reliable investigation of drug compound distributions on the cellular level |journal=Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry |volume=401 |issue=1 |pages=65–73 |year=2011 |last1=Römpp |first1=Andreas |last2=Guenther |first2=Sabine |last3=Takats |first3=Zoltan |last4=Spengler |first4=Bernhard }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of the detected protein and peptide components, tissue-specific expression of the proteins is known commonly. Precise immunohistochemical methods are based on this phenomenon. The mass spectrometer detection, mainly from cell membranes and similar tissue, specifically, of complex lipids from similar tissue, however, yields surprising results. Since the distribution of proteins are in good agreement with the distribution patterns obtained by immunohistochemical methods, the distribution of the lipid components of the direct ionization mass spectrometric, previously were relative methods leading to the appearance of a new era in the study of biological specimens. The desorption electrospray ionization (DESI) was the first-MS technique, which allowed non-invasive testing of any objects (or organisms) without sample preparation, regardless of their shape or mechanical properties.&lt;ref&gt;Takats et al., 2004{{full|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rapid evaporative ionization mass spectrometry ===
[[File:Lymph node NPC.jpg|thumb|220PX|Lymph node excision]]
During the summer of 2009, '''rapid evaporative ionization mass spectrometry''' ('''REIMS''') was described. This is the second generation method. Primarily, lipid components of tissues provide the information, but different metabolite molecules and certain proteins also allow detection. The most important advantage of the specificity of mass [[Spectrometry, mass, electrospray ionization|spectrometry]] data is at the [[histological]] level, providing the opportunity to identify biological tissue based on chemical composition. The REIMS method is unique, in that, while the above-described mass spectrometry techniques specific to the particular method developed ion sources should be used, but it is difficult in the case of ion source devices used in surgical practice. With the operation of a variety of tissue-cutting tools, such as a [[diathermy]] knife, a surgical [[laser]], or an [[ultrasound|ultrasonic]] tissue atomizer, an aerosol is formed having a composition characteristic of the tissue cut, which also contains ionized cell constructs.

Among them, in terms of using the REIMS method, the intact membrane-forming [[phospholipids]] are important, which easily are detectable by [[mass spectrometry]] on the one hand, and on the other hand, contain the combination of the characteristics of the particular tissue type. Mass spectrometric analysis is just one implementation of an effective extraction system development that was needed to cut the surgical site at the time of running the generated aerosol mass spectrometer. For this purpose, a so-called Venturi-tube serves, as well as the above-mentioned surgical hand pieces, being modified to smoke the aerosols through them. Analysis of the flue gas in the mass spectrometer is realized instantaneously, within a few tenths of a second, resulting in a tissue-specific phospholipid mass spectra being obtained, allowing a response by the surgeon in less than two seconds. The analysis of the collected spectra is made of special-evaluation software, which was developed for this purpose. The software continuously compares the incoming data during surgery, validates mass spectra stored in a database, assigns the appropriate class, and the result is displayed visually to the surgeon. It also may provide information to the surgeon via an audio signal.&lt;ref&gt;Heath, Nick, ''[http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/european-technology/the-intelligent-knife-that-helps-surgeons-sniff-out-cancer/?tag=nl.e101&amp;s_cid=e101&amp;ttag=e101&amp;ftag=TRE684d531 The Intelligent knife that helps surgeons sniff out cancer]'', European Technology, November 26, 2014, distributed in TechRebuplic Daily Digest, TechRepublic.com, November 27, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that the tissue identification accuracy during operation is higher than 92%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/ac5046752 |pmid=25671656 |title=Rapid Evaporative Ionization Mass Spectrometry Imaging Platform for Direct Mapping from Bulk Tissue and Bacterial Growth Media |journal=Analytical Chemistry |volume=87 |issue=5 |pages=2527–2534 |year=2015 |last1=Golf |first1=Ottmar |last2=Strittmatter |first2=Nicole |last3=Karancsi |first3=Tamas |last4=Pringle |first4=Steven D |last5=Speller |first5=Abigail V.

Therefore, the method is suitable for use in a surgical environment for carrying out measurements, as well as for being a part of a complex tissue identification system used during surgical tumor removal, and it can assist the surgeon in the operating surgical site with accurate histological mapping. The rapid evaporative ionization mass spectrometry (REIMS) is a novel technique that allows electrosurgery cuts with near real-time characterization of human tissue in vivo analysis through analysis of the vapors released during the process of tissue and aerosols. The REIMS technology and electro-surgical procedure adds tissue diagnosis to the intelligent knife iKnife operating principle.&lt;ref name="Balog et al 2013"/&gt;

== Benefits ==
{{Advert|date=September 2017}}

=== Obstacles potentially overcome using the iKnife ===  
* At the best-equipped hospitals current surgical practices may take at least 10–30 minutes for intervention related to tumor tissue or organ removal 
* Surgeons are not able to determine during surgery whether every cancer cell and tissue has been removed so often, healthy tissue removed for safety's sake alone 
* If cancer cells remain after surgery, the tumor tissue may require further surgery, chemotherapy, or radiotherapy

=== Advantages using the iKnife ===
* Removal of more cancerous tissue while reducing the damage to nearby healthy tissue than current electroknife procedures 
* Precise antimicrobial therapy may be initiated through knowledge of the bacteriological results obtained during surgery 
* The instrument is highly selective, able to delineate the necessary extent of the surgical site through providing relevant and objective information, without greatly affecting general surgical protocols 
* the iKnife provides greater safety than conventional instruments
* It enables shorter times for surgeries 
* The iKnife provides more information to the surgeon
* It reduces expenses for surgeries

==Goals==
Systems biology attempts to study biological systems in a holistic manner by integrating data at all levels of the biological information hierarchy, from global down to the individual organism, and below down to the molecular level. The vision of ISB has been to integrate these concepts using a cross-disciplinary approach combining the efforts of biologists, chemists, computer scientists, engineers, mathematicians, physicists, and physicians.&lt;ref name=Hood2008/&gt;

On its website, ISB has defined four areas of focus:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Institute for Systems Biology - Research|url=http://www.systemsbiology.org/research|publisher=Institute for Systems Biology|accessdate=17 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* P4 Medicine - This acronym refers to predictive, preventive, personalized and participatory medicine, which focuses on wellness rather than the mere treatment of disease.
* Global Health - Use of the systems approach towards the study of infectious diseases, vaccine development, emergence of chronic diseases, and maternal and child health.
* Sustainable Environment - Applying systems biology for a better understanding of the role of microbes in the environment and their relation to human health.
* Education &amp; Outreach - Knowledge transfer to society through a variety of educational programs and partnerships, including the spinout of new companies.

The [[University of Washington]] (UW), like many other universities, was eager to recruit Hood, but had neither the space nor the money to accommodate Hood's large laboratory.&lt;ref name=Dietrich1992/&gt;

Lee Huntsman, director of UW's Center for Bioengineering, was attending a UW football game, sharing a luxury box with [[Bill Gates]], the former CEO and current chairman of [[Microsoft]]. Huntsman took the opportunity to tell Gates about Hood. Bill Gates already had a considerable interest in biotechnology, both as a philanthropist and as an investor, and after meeting Hood, donated $12 million to UW to enable him to head a new department of molecular biotechnology,&lt;ref name=Dietrich1992/&gt; where Hood continues to hold a faculty position as the Gates Professor of Molecular Biotechnology.&lt;ref name=UWBiotechnology&gt;{{cite web|title=Department of Molecular Biotechnology|url=http://nick-lab.gs.washington.edu/mbt-web/|publisher=University of Washington|accessdate=17 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ISB represents a spin-off of Hood's labs at UW.&lt;ref name=ISEPP_Hood&gt;{{cite web|title=Revolutionary New Science|url=http://www.isepp.org/Pages/01-02%20Pages/Hood.html|publisher=Institute for Science, Engineering and Public Policy|accessdate=17 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Achievements==
ISB is in the top ranks of scientific institutions worldwide. In 2012, the  SCImago Research Group, based in Spain, ranked ISB 4th worldwide on its Excellence Rate scale.&lt;ref name=SCImago&gt;{{cite web|title=SCImago Research Group|url=http://www.scimago.es/index.php|publisher=SCImago Research Group|accessdate=21 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ISB currently hosts 10 research groups with expertise ranging across [[genetics]], [[microbial genetics]], complex molecular machines, macromolecular complexes, [[gene regulatory networks]], [[immunology]], molecular and cell biology, cancer biology, [[genomics]], [[proteomics]], protein chemistry, [[computational biology]] and [[biotechnology]].&lt;ref name=ISB/&gt; The ISB web site lists 985 peer-reviewed publications for the years 2000 through early 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Institute for Systems Biology - Publications|url=http://www.systemsbiology.org/publications|publisher=Institute for Systems Biology|accessdate=17 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
In late 2005, the ISB began to emphasize the application of systems biology to P4 medicine (predictive, preventive, personalized, participatory), ''i.e.'' the development of techniques for predicting and preventing disease, possibly before patients even know they are sick. The ''P4 Medicine institute'' was co-founded in 2010 by ISB and [[Ohio State University]].&lt;ref name=P4&gt;{{cite web|title=P4 Medicine Institute|url=http://p4mi.org/|accessdate=17 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Education and Outreach efforts of ISB include creating the Logan Center for Education whose mission is to enable educators to produce [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]] literate students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Logan Center for Education |url=http://logancenter.systemsbiology.net |publisher=Institute for Systems Biology |accessdate=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ISB offers paid research internships for high school and undergraduate students, and offers advanced systems science courses throughout the year.

ISB has partnered in several high-profile research projects, the most significant one thus far being with the [[Grand Duchy of Luxembourg]] to create the ''Center for Systems Biology Luxembourg''&lt;ref name=Seattlepi2008&gt;{{cite news|last=Tartakoff|first=Joseph|title=Seattle, Luxembourg research projects set|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/business/article/Seattle-Luxembourg-research-projects-set-1275714.php|accessdate=17 March 2012|newspaper=Seattlepi.com (Seattle Post-Intelligencer)|date=5 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Seattle Proteome Center''.&lt;ref name=SPC&gt;{{cite web|title=Seattle Proteome Center |url=http://www.proteomecenter.org/ |publisher=Seattle Proteome Center|accessdate=17 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ISB faculty members have launched five companies: Cytopeia (acquired by BD in 2008), Integrated Diagnostics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Integrated Diagnostics|url=http://www.integrated-diagnostics.com/|accessdate=17 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Macrogenics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Macrogenics |accessdate=17 March 2012|url=http://www.macrogenics.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[NanoString Technologies]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=NanoString |url=http://www.nanostring.com/ |accessdate=17 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Accelerator Corporation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Accelerator Corporation |url=http://www.acceleratorcorp.com/ |accessdate=17 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accelerator Corporation, in particular, is an investment company that provides venture capital funding and management for biotech startup companies. Its portfolio companies and graduates have focused on improved biotherapeutics, vaccines, biomarkers and other such products.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2394">'''Jimione (Jimmie) Isimeli Samisoni''' was the late former Dean of the [[Fiji School of Medicine]] (FSM).

==Biography==
Samisoni attended [[Lelean Memorial School]] in 1949, passed his Senior Cambridge exams and matriculated to the then Central School of Medicine. The Central School of Medicine was later renamed the Fiji School of Medicine.

After receiving a fellowship from the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), he went on to study at the [[Otago University]] where he graduated in 1959 with a Bachelor of Medicine. Later he continued post-graduate studies at the [[University of Queensland]] where he graduated with a Masters of Science degree.

Whilst studying for his [[Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery]] degree (MBBS), Jimmie Samisoni was also working towards his Doctorate (PhD)which he received in 1973.

From the mid to late 1970s, Dr Samisoni worked as a house surgeon in [[Queensland]]. He also worked as a senior lecturer at the [[Griffith University]] before returning to Fiji in 1980 where he joined the FSM.

During the year of the first [[1987 Fijian coups d'état|military coup in Fiji]] (1987), Dr Jimmie Samisoni left Fiji and joined the [[University of Hawaii]]'s [[John A. Burns School of Medicine|medical faculty]] as an assistant clinical professor.

Dr Samisoni was appointed the academic dean of the FSM when he came back to Fiji in 1990.

He retired from the FSM in 1998.

Dr Jimione Samisoni died in April 2007. He was married to Dr [[Mere Samisoni]] ([[Doctor of Business Administration|DBA]]) and they had four children. Dr[[Mere Samisoni]] is the Chairperson of the popular Hot Bread chain of stores in Fiji.

[[File:Toshka syphon construction site.jpg|thumb|Construction site (2010) of the syphon that delivers water from the new valley project under the toshka spillway]]
The '''New Valley Project''' or '''Toshka Project''' consists of building a system of canals to carry water from [[Lake Nasser]] to [[Irrigation|irrigate]] part of the sandy wastes of the [[Western Desert (Egypt)|Western Desert]] of [[Egypt]], which is part of the [[Sahara Desert]].  In 1997 the Egyptian government decided to develop a '''new valley''' (as opposed to the existing [[Nile Valley]]) where agricultural and industrial communities would develop.  It has been an ambitious project which was meant to help Egypt cope with its rapidly growing population.

The canal inlet starts from a site 8&amp;nbsp;km to the north of Toshka Bay (Khor) on Lake Nasser.  The canal is meant to continue westwards until it reaches the Darb el-Arbe'ien route, then northwards along the Darb el- Arbe'ien to the [[Baris, Egypt|Baris Oasis]], covering a distance of 310&amp;nbsp;km. But as of April 2012 the canal is still 60&amp;nbsp;km short of the Baris Oasis.  The [[Mubarak Pumping Station]] in [[Toshka]] is the centerpiece of the project and was inaugurated in March 2005.  It pumps water from Lake Nasser to be transported by way of a canal through the valley, with the idea of transforming 2340&amp;nbsp;km² (588,000 acres) of desert into agricultural land.  The Toshka Project has now been revived by President [[Abdel Fattah el-Sisi]]. Half of the land will be given to college graduates, 1 acre each, funded by the Long Live Egypt Fund.

The essential problem is that the Western Desert's high saline levels and the presence of underground [[aquifer]]s in the area act as a major obstacle to any irrigation project. As the land is irrigated, the salt would mix with the aquifers and would reduce access to potable water.  There is also the difficulty that the clay minerals found in the soil are posing technical problems to the big wheeled structures moving around autonomously to irrigate the land. Often their wheels get stuck in a little bowl created by wet clay that dried, and the irrigation machines come to a standstill.  The only objective met up to April 2012 is the diversion of water from Lake Nasser into what little of the Sheikh Zayed Canal has been built.

The [[Toshka Lakes]] are a by-product of the rising level of [[Lake Nasser]] and lie in the same general region as much of the New Valley Project.

'''Paraveterinary workers in Ireland''', such as veterinary nurses, assist [[veterinary physician]]s, or carry out animal health procedures autonomously.  [[Paraveterinary workers]] in [[Ireland]] have been represented by the [[Irish Veterinary Nursing Association]] (IVNA) since 2002, and prior to this were represented by the British Veterinary Nursing Association (BVNA) from the 1960s.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} The title "veterinary nurse" can only be used by those registered with the [[Veterinary Council of Ireland]].&lt;ref name="mcCurin 2017"/&gt; The post-nominal letters used in Ireland are RVN (Registered Veterinary Nurse).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Self|first1=Georgina|title=RVN profile: Melanie O’Donoghue|journal=Veterinary Ireland Journal|date=May 2013|volume=3|issue=5|pages=236-238|url=http://www.veterinaryirelandjournal.com/images/nurse_may_2013.pdf|accessdate=2018-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Veterinary nursing==
Veterinary nursing became a regulated profession in Ireland from January 2008, under the Veterinary Practice Act 2005.&lt;ref name="mcCurin 2017"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Bassert|editor1-first=Joanna M.|editor2-last=Samples|editor2-first=Oreta|editor3-last=Beal|editor3-first=Angela|title=McCurnin's Clinical Textbook for Veterinary Technicians|date=2017|isbn=9780323496407|page=1374|edition=9th}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the act was implemented in January 2008, unqualified staff working in veterinary practices before 2004 had a period of six months to apply for provisional registration which conferred the same rights and responsibilities as full membership.&lt;ref name="VP 2011"/&gt; The provisional registration category ended on 31 December 2012.&lt;ref name="VP 2011"&gt;{{cite web|title=Milestone celebrated|url=https://veterinary-practice.com/article/milestone-celebrated|website=Veterinary Practice|publisher=5m Enterprises Inc.|accessdate=2018-01-13|language=en|date=1 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Following the implementation of the Veterinary Practice Act in January 2008, no individual can legally perform veterinary nursing duties unless listed on the Register or is currently undertaking a course of formal education approved by the Veterinary Council.

Registered veterinary nurses must complete the required amount of [[continuing professional education]] each year to maintain their registration.&lt;ref name="Harvey 2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harvey|first1=Laura|last2=Ladyman|first2=Rebecca|last3=Farnworth|first3=Mark|title=International differences in the journey toward compulsory veterinary nurse registration|journal=The Veterinary Nurse|date=2 November 2014|volume=5|issue=9|pages=538–542|doi=10.12968/vetn.2014.5.9.538}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2016 survey found that the majority of registered veterinary nurses were women, and that the average age was 32.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McDonnell|first1=Lorraine|title=Veterinary Nursing Survey|journal=Veterinary Ireland Journal|date=August 2016|volume=6|issue=8|pages=423-424|url=http://www.veterinaryirelandjournal.com/images/nurse_aug_2016.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Qualifications===
There are five programmes of study which qualify one to become a veterinary nurse in Ireland, each sanctioned by the [[Veterinary Council of Ireland]]: the 2-year diploma course at [[St. John's Central College]] in Cork, the 3-year ordinary Bachelor of Science degrees in [[Athlone, Dundalk and Letterkenny Institutes of Technology]] and the 4-year higher (honours level) Bachelor of Science degree at [[University College Dublin]].{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} Qualifications gained outside of Ireland may be recognised by the Veterinary Council as being equivalent to Ireland's veterinary nursing qualifications.&lt;ref name="Harvey 2014" /&gt;

{{Spanish name|Arrupe|Gondra}}
'''Pedro Arrupe''' {{post-nominals|post-noms=[[Society of Jesus|SJ]]}} (14 November 1907&amp;nbsp;– 5 February 1991) was a Spanish [[Basque people|Basque]] [[Jesuit]] priest who served as the twenty-eighth [[Superior General of the Society of Jesus]] (1965–83). Stationed as novice master outside [[Hiroshima]] in 1945, he used his medical background as a first responder to the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombing of Hiroshima.]] He led the Jesuits in the implementation of the [[Second Vatican Council]], especially with regard to a faith that does justice and [[preferential option for the poor#Origin and usage|preferential option for the poor]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://president.georgetown.edu/pedro-arrupe-sj|title=Pedro Arrupe, S.J.|website=president.georgetown.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and training==
Pedro Arrupe attended school at the Santiago Apostol High School in [[Bilbao]]. Later he moved to [[Madrid]] to attend the Medical School of the [[Complutense University of Madrid|Universidad Complutense]]. There he met [[Severo Ochoa]], who later won the [[Nobel Prize in Medicine]]. One of his teachers was [[Juan Negrín]], a pioneer in physiology, who would become [[Prime Minister]] of the [[Second Spanish Republic|Spanish Republic]] during the [[Spanish Civil War|Civil War]] (1936–1939). Arrupe received the top prize in the first year anatomy course.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

After some years of medical training, Pedro Arrupe joined the Jesuits in 1927 but was unable to pursue his studies for the [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|priesthood]] in Spain, since the Order had been expelled by the [[Spanish Republican]] government (1931-1939). Accordingly, the young Arrupe did his studies in the [[Netherlands]] and [[Belgium]] and at [[Saint Louis University|St. Louis University]] School of Divinity in [[St. Marys, Kansas]], where he was ordained in 1936.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Pedro-Arrupe|title=Pedro Arrupe {{!}} Biography, Facts, &amp; Hiroshima|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-05-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://kenrick.edu/about/administration-and-faculty-2/|title=Administration/Faculty|website=kenrick.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arrupe then completed a doctorate in [[Medical Ethics]].&lt;ref name=spirit&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ignatianspirituality.com/ignatian-voices/20th-century-ignatian-voices/pedro-arrupe-sj/|title=Pedro Arrupe, SJ (1907—1991) - IgnatianSpirituality.com|work=Ignatian Spirituality|access-date=2017-06-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Japan - Hiroshima==
After his doctorate, Arrupe was sent to work as a missionary in [[Japan]]. His early years as missionary were very frustrating for him. No matter what he did, what he organised, people did not attend, and few if any converted to Christianity. When the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] occurred in [[Hawaii]] on 7 December 1941, it was 8 December in Japan. Arrupe was celebrating the [[Eucharist]] for the Solemnity of the [[Immaculate Conception]] when he was arrested and imprisoned for a time, being suspected of espionage. On [[Christmas]] Eve, Arrupe heard people gathering outside his cell door and presumed that the time for him to be executed had arrived. However, to his utter surprise, he discovered that some fellow [[Catholics]], ignoring all danger, had come to sing him [[Christmas carols]]. Upon this realization, Arrupe recalled that he burst into tears.&lt;ref name="ignatian" /&gt; His attitude of profound prayer and his lack of offensive behaviour gained him the respect of his jailers and judges, and he was set free within a month. 

Arrupe was appointed Jesuit superior and [[novice]] master in Japan in 1942, and was living in suburban [[Hiroshima]] when the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bomb fell in August 1945]]. He was one of 8 Jesuits who were within the blast zone of the bomb, and all 8 survived the destruction. Arrupe described that event as "a permanent experience outside of history, engraved on my memory."&lt;ref name="arrupe"&gt;[http://www.arrupe.org/en/father_pedro.html Arrupe Formation Centre website: Arrupe] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725013909/http://www.arrupe.org/en/father_pedro.html |date=2011-07-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Father Arrupe used his medical skills to help those who were wounded or dying. The Jesuit [[novitiate]] was converted into a makeshift hospital where between 150 and 200 people received care. Arrupe recalled, "The chapel, half destroyed, was overflowing with the wounded, who were lying on the floor very near to one another, suffering terribly, twisted with pain."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eurekastreet.com.au/article.aspx?aeid=3219|title=Hiroshima insider's imprint on Jesuit sensibility - Eureka Street|website=www.eurekastreet.com.au|language=en|access-date=2017-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1958, Arrupe was appointed the first Jesuit [[Provincial superior|provincial]] for Japan, a position he held until being elected Father General in 1965.

Prior to being elected Father General, Arrupe made a visit to [[Latin America]] and, on one occasion, was celebrating the [[Eucharist]] in a suburban slum. He was deeply moved at the devotion and respect the people had for Christ in the midst of their abject poverty. After the service, a man invited Arrupe to his hovel, where he told him that he was so grateful for his visit and that he wanted to share the only gift he had, that of watching the setting sun together. Arrupe reflected, "He gave me his hand.

At the thirty-first [[General Congregation]] of the Society of Jesus in 1965, Arrupe was elected twenty-eighth [[Superior General of the Society of Jesus|Superior General]] of the Jesuits, and served in that post until 1983. He was only the second [[Basque people|Basque]] to be Father General, the first being the founder [[Saint Ignatius of Loyola]] himself.&lt;ref name=BC.edu /&gt; Jesuit [[Vincent O'Keefe]], a friend and advisor to Arrupe, said Arrupe was "a second Ignatius of Loyola, a refounder of the Society in the light of Vatican II."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | work=New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/02/06/obituaries/pedro-arrupe-jesuit-chief-for-18-years-dies-at-83.html |date=6 February 1991 | quote =Father Arrupe had embarked upon his role as Superior General with enthusiasm for the revisionist themes of Vatican II.... He cautioned the world Synod of Bishops in 1971 against 'authoritarian or paternalistic attitudes'.... He insisted that the Jesuit order, long identified with work among social and political elites, increase its activities among the poor.... He also introduced new forms of decentralization into the Jesuit decision-making process.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.americamagazine.org/issue/100/don-pedro-history-2|title="Reinvention" of Society of Jesus, from obit in America|last=|first=|date=1991-02-16|work=America Magazine|access-date=2017-03-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; At his election [[Moscow]] radio spoke of an unusual man who would bring the Society of Jesus to its powers of the past.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AKQUaKfl5yAC&amp;pg=PA218&amp;|title=Pedro Arrupe, SJ| date=2000| publisher=Gracewing|isbn=9780852444467|location=England|authorlink=George Bishop|accessdate=13 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|218}}

After the changes following [[Vatican II]] (1962–1965), there was tension within the Society as to how the life of a Jesuit was to be lived. While some [[religious order|religious group]]s in the [[Catholic Church|Catholic church]] have limits on the works they take on, the Society of Jesus encourages its members to follow their interest and talents and the needs of the times into a whole range of ministries – as theologians, missionaries, retreat directors, teachers, artists, writers, musicians, counselors, scientists, and pastors – to bring [[AMDG|glory to God]] in all areas of human endeavor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,945242-2,00.html|title=The Jesuits' Search For a New Identity|date=1973-04-23|work=Time|access-date=2017-06-01|language=en-US|issn=0040-781X}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is in line with the crowning contemplation of Ignatius' [[Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius of Loyola|Spiritual Exercises]] through which Jesuits learn to find God in all things (#236). As Arrupe's biographer said of him, he "saw the hand of God in everything."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{rp|226}}

Arrupe warned of repeating the answers of yesterday for tomorrow's problems, saying: "If we speak a language no longer appropriate to the hearts of people, we speak only to ourselves because no one will listen to us or try to understand what we say."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{rp|228}} Arrupe was "hailed as a prophet of our time,"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{rp|231}} not unlike Jesuit [[Pope Francis]] who was in theological studies, learning, when Arrupe became Superior General and began speaking his "prophetic" words. The Union of Superior Generals of religious, seeing Arrupe as the right man for our time, elected him five times as their president.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{rp|231}}

=== Faith and justice ===
At the thirty-second General Congregation which convened in 1975, Arrupe's dream of working for the poor was crystallised in the document "Our Mission Today: the Service of Faith and the Promotion of Justice." It stated: "Our faith in Jesus Christ and our mission to proclaim the Gospel demand of us a commitment to promote justice and enter into solidarity with the voiceless and the powerless."&lt;ref name="jcu"&gt;[http://www.jcu.edu/arrupe/pedro.htm John Carroll University: About Pedro Arrupe]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528155040/http://www.jcu.edu/arrupe/pedro.htm |date=May 28, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the decree basically defined all the work of the Jesuits as having an essential focus on the promotion of [[social justice]] as well as the [[Catholic]] faith. Arrupe was keenly aware that in the political climate of the 1970s, the Jesuits’ commitment to working for social justice would bring great hardship and suffering, particularly in those [[Latin America]]n countries ruled by military [[Military dictatorship|junta]]s.&lt;ref name="jcu" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BC.edu"&gt;[http://www.bc.edu/offices/ministry/arrupe/pedro.html Boston College Website: Arrupe] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100326070907/http://www.bc.edu/offices/ministry/arrupe/pedro.html |date=March 26, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a speech to European educators Arrupe made it clear where he stood on matters of faith and justice, saying: "I take very seriously the words of Gandhi, 'I love Christ but I despise Christians because they do not live as Christ lived.' Without a doubt Christian love of neighbor entails a duty to care for the wounds of those that have fallen victim to robbers and are left bleeding by the wayside."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{rp|270}} In the late 1960s and into the 1980s some [[theologians]] in Latin America became increasingly involved in the political sphere, adopting [[Marxist]] rhetoric. Many Jesuits were at the forefront of the movement which was called [[liberation theology]] and concentrated on seeing [[Christ]] as the liberator not only from sin but from all forms of oppression. In its extreme manifestations, liberation theology seemed to subordinate the message of the [[Gospel]] to political revolution, with a wholesale acceptance of Marxism. But Arrupe's strong support for relieving the burden of the poor in Latin America enables one to see his "cautionary statements about liberation theology,... as efforts to impose self-discipline to fend off more severe sanctions from outside the order."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/02/06/obituaries/pedro-arrupe-jesuit-chief-for-18-years-dies-at-83.html|title=New York Times|last=|first=|date=6 February 1991|work=|access-date=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== A cause worth dying for ===


On 20 June 1977 the White Warriors Union death squad threatened to kill all 47 Jesuits serving in [[El Salvador]] unless they abandoned their work with the poor and left the country within a month.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1977/07/20/page/B4/article/el-salvador-priests-in-peril|title=El Salvador priests in peril (July 20, 1977)|access-date=2017-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; After consulting with the Jesuit community in El Salvador, Arrupe replied "They may end up as martyrs, but my priests are not going to leave because they are with the people."{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} A few months earlier, Jesuit Father [[Rutilio Grande]], a proponent of liberation theology, was assassinated in El Salvador. On 16 November 1989, six Jesuits ([[Ignacio Ellacuría]], Armando Lopez, Joaquin Lopez y Lopez, [[Ignacio Martín-Baró]], [[Segundo Montes]] and Juan Ramon Moreno, along with their housekeeper (Julia Elba Ramos) and her daughter (Celina), would be murdered at the Jesuit [[University of Central America]]. Others also suffered [[martyr]]dom: the chief bishop in El Salvador Archbishop [[Óscar Romero]] (though conservative in respect to religion) was gunned down whilst celebrating the Eucharist on 24 March 1980. Lay missionary [[Jean Donovan]], [[Ursulines|Ursuline]] sister [[Dorothy Kazel]] and [[Maryknoll Sisters of St. Dominic|Maryknoll]] sisters [[Maura Clarke]] and [[Ita Ford]]  were beaten, raped and murdered by non-uniformed members of the [[National Guard (El Salvador)|Salvadoran National Guard]] on 2 December 1980.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Paying the Price: Ignacio Ellacuría and the Murdered Jesuits of El Salvador|last=Whitfield|first=Teresa|publisher=Temple U|year=1994|isbn=1566392535|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They joined some 75,000 Salvadorans who were killed during this troubled period.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;{{rp|97}} All the while, Arrupe continued to support and pray for those people who were willing to lay down their lives to help the poor initiate change.&lt;ref name="ignatian"/&gt;

=== Jesuit Refugee Service ===
Touched by the plight of the "[[Vietnam]]ese boat people" in 1979, Pedro Arrupe sent cable messages to some 20 Jesuit major superiors throughout the world sharing his distress at the suffering of these people. He asked them what they could do to help bring relief to refugees and displaced persons in their own regions. He received a positive response, with numerous offers of personnel, medicine, and funding. The next year in 1980 Arrupe founded the [[Jesuit Refugee Service]] to coordinate the Society's refugee work. In a speech launching the service he said "Saint Ignatius called us to go anywhere where we are most needed for the [[Ad maiorem Dei gloriam|greater glory of God]]. The spiritual as well as the material need of more than 16 million refugees throughout the world today could scarcely be greater. God is calling us through these helpless people." In 2017 JRS listed 47 countries where its 10 regional offices were currently serving nearly 950,000 individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.jrs.net/Regions|title=Jesuit Refugee Service {{!}} Where we work|last=Service|first=Jesuit Refugee|website=en.jrs.net|language=en|access-date=2017-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years JRS had served an estimated 40 million refugees.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Later life==
On 7 August 1981, after a long and tiring trip throughout the [[Far East]], Arrupe suffered a stroke just after his aeroplane landed at [[Rome]]'s [[Fiumicino Airport]]. He was paralysed on his right side and was able to speak only a few words. This ability gradually deteriorated until he was completely mute. From that time on he lived in the infirmary at the Jesuit headquarters in Rome. He was the first Jesuit Superior-General to resign instead of remaining in office until his death. Pope [[John Paul II]] appointed [[Paolo Dezza]] as his personal delegate and interim Father General of the Society, passing over Arrupe's own choice (his vicar general). There was a wave of resentment in the Society as this was seen as unwarranted papal interference in Jesuit affairs. For his part, Arrupe never expressed any disagreement or resentment.&lt;ref name=BC.edu /&gt; In 1983, Dezza called the thirty-third General Congregation to deal with the resignation of Arrupe and the election of a successor. Arrupe's resignation was accepted on 3 September 1983 during the Congregation and it proceeded to elect [[Peter Hans Kolvenbach]] as Father General. During the opening Session of the Congregation, Arrupe was wheeled into the hall, and a prayer which he had written was read aloud:

{{quote|More than ever I find myself in the hands of God. This is what I have wanted all my life from my youth. But now there is a difference; the initiative is entirely with God. It is indeed a profound spiritual experience to know and feel myself so totally in God's hands.&lt;ref name=spirit/&gt;}}
During his ten years in the infirmary, praying for and with the Society, Arrupe received many and frequent well-wishers, including Pope John Paul II. Arrupe had earlier expressed what some regard as the key to his life: "Nowadays the world does not need words but lives that cannot be explained except through faith and love for Christ's poor."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Death and burial ===
Arrupe died on 5 February 1991. His funeral was held in the [[Church of the Gesu]], Rome, and was attended by crowds that filled the [[piazza]] outside the church. Also in attendance were 10 [[Cardinal (Catholic Church)|cardinals]], 20 bishops, [[Giulio Andreotti]] the [[Prime Minister of Italy]], as well as other religious and civil dignitaries. His body, first interred in the Jesuit mausoleum at [[Campo Verano]], was brought back into the [[Church of the Gesù]] where it lies in a side chapel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.americamagazine.org/issue/100/creative-fidelity-pedro-arrupe|title=Memorial Mass|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=2 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to PEF's Department of Labor records, the union is composed of three categories of members: "administrative," "institutional," and "private/public sector." Of the total membership, these comprise around 69%, 28% and 3%, or 35,088, 14,065, and 1,443 members, respectively. The first two of these classifications cover two types of labor in "the Professional, Technical, and Scientific Titles [...] as designated by NYS and Civil Service." The third, smallest, portion covers several other employers. PEF contracts also cover some non-members, known as [[agency fee]] payers, which number comparatively about one twentieth of the size of the union's membership, or 2,790 non-members.&lt;ref name="OLMS_LM-2_2014-06-29"/&gt;

==Origins==
In 1971, 61-year-old [[George Hardy (labor leader)|George Hardy]] was elected president of the [[Service Employees International Union]] (SEIU).&lt;ref name="WhoWasWho"&gt;''Who Was Who in America,'' 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cook"&gt;Cook, "George Hardy, 79, Pioneer Leader of Service Worker Union, Is Dead," ''New York Times,'' September 18, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; Under Hardy, SEIU's health care and public employee divisions saw rapid growth.&lt;ref name="Cook" /&gt; Much of the membership growth, however, came through affiliation rather than new member organizing. Hardy viewed the fast-growing [[American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees]] (AFSCME) as SEIU's chief competitor.&lt;ref&gt;McCartin, " 'A Wagner Act for Public Employees': Labor's Deferred Dream and the Rise of Conservatism, 1970–1976," ''Journal of American History,'' June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  AFSCME had grown from a mere 100,000 members in 1951 to 500,000 members in 1972, and had elected a dynamic and aggressive new leader, 45-year-old [[Jerome Wurf|Jerry Wurf]], in 1964.&lt;ref name="Billings"&gt;Billings and Greenya, ''Power to the Public Worker,'' 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; Not only was AFSCME's growth substantial, its demographics matched those of SEIU's: At least two-thirds of the rival union's members were blue-collar workers, and a fifth of them worked in hospitals and nursing homes.&lt;ref name="Billings" /&gt; To counter AFSCME's rapid growth, Hardy adopted a strategy of affiliating existing unions rather than organizing unorganized workers. Between 1971 and 1980, SEIU affiliated 22 independent unions.&lt;ref name="Moody"&gt;Moody, ''An Injury to All: The Decline of American Unionism,'' 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; Merger and affiliation accounted for 230,000 new members from 1971 to 1985, and virtually all of the union's growth from 1980 to 1984.&lt;ref name="Moody" /&gt;

One of SEIU's major growth spurts came in 1978, when it raided the [[Civil Service Employees Association]] (CSEA). In existence since 1910, CSEA had won representation rights for New York State's 140,000 public employees after the state passed a public employee collective bargaining law in 1968. Structured like an association rather than a union, CSEA hesitated to engage in militant labor action or strike, and yet it had a rocky relationship with the state:  The union struck for two days at the beginning of April 1972&lt;ref&gt;Clarity, "State Employes Begin a Walkout," ''New York Times,'' April 1, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; and won a 5.5 percent pay hike.&lt;ref&gt;Clarity, "State Strike Ends As Workers Win Raise and Bonus," ''New York Times,'' April 3, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; But the strike and dissatisfaction with CSEA's leadership led some CSEA members to ask for representation by SEIU.  With Hardy's strong backing, the newly formed union was able to gather enough signatures on petitions to trigger a representational vote in two of the four units where workers were represented by CSEA, but SEIU lost the vote by a 3-to-1 margin in December 1972.&lt;ref&gt;Stetson, "State Employes Will Vote This Week," ''New York Times,'' December 3, 1972; Johnson, "State Institutional Employes to Stay in Civil Service Union," ''New York Times,'' December 9, 1972; "State's Professional Aides Vote to Retain Association," ''New York Times,'' December 10, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; A second strike planned by CSEA leaders was called off after delegates overwhelmingly repudiated a strike resolution supported by the union's leaders.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, "State Workers Postpone Strike After Rift Develops," ''New York Times,'' April 1, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; The internal strife led SEIU to once again challenge CSEA for a large unit of New York State public employees. In an election held December 5, 1975, an SEIU-led coalition which included the [[American Federation of Teachers]] (AFT), the [[Laborers' International Union of North America]], the [[Teamsters|International Brotherhood of Teamsters]], and several building trades unions was defeated by CSEA, 10,858 to 10,348 with 1,015 voting for neither union.&lt;ref name="Test"&gt;"C.S.E.A. Wins a Test in Albany Election," ''New York Times,'' February 8, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; With neither side winning a majority, a second election was held the first week of February 1976, which CSEA won (14,321 to 10,184).&lt;ref name="Test" /&gt;

But Hardy continued to raid CSEA.  CSEA leaders initially sought protection by affiliating with AFSCME. Article 20 of the AFL-CIO constitution prohibits affiliates from raiding one another's members, and an affiliation with AFSCME would have won CSEA relief from the raids.&lt;ref name="BarMerger"&gt;"Civil Service Association Bars Merger With Union," ''New York Times,'' March 18, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; But CSEA delegates formally barred their leaders from seeking an affiliation with AFSCME in March 1976.&lt;ref name="BarMerger" /&gt; CSEA's contract with the state of New York expired in 1977. Although CSEA leaders once more proposed a strike, the union settled for a 14 percent pay raise in April 1977.&lt;ref&gt;Stetson, "New York State Employees Plan For a Possible Strike on April 18," ''New York Times,'' April 7, 1977; Meislin, "Albany Pact to Give State Workers Raise of 14% Over 2 Years," ''New York Times,'' April 18, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; Hardy, convinced SEIU could successfully raid CSEA, conducted secret polls which showed that deep unrest in the professional, scientific, and technical (PS&amp;T) unit.&lt;ref name="HobartInterview"&gt;[http://library.albany.edu/speccoll/findaids/apap015/hobart.pdf "Tom Hobart Interview,"] CSEA History Project, SUNY-Albany, December 7, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Working only with the AFT, SEIU once more obtained enough petitions to challenge CSEA representation in the PS&amp;T unit. The raid was successful, and the coalition (known as the Public Employees Federation) won, 15,062 to 12,259.&lt;ref&gt;Stetson, "State's Employees Get Different Union," ''New York Times,'' April 16, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; Hardy and AFT leader [[Albert Shanker]] hoped to raid CSEA further, but CSEA affiliated with AFSMCE on April 21, 1978.&lt;ref name="HobartInterview" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gupte, "Union of Civil Service Employees to Affiliate With a Longtime Rival," ''New York Times,'' April 22, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; The affiliation made AFSCME the largest affiliate in the AFL-CIO.&lt;ref&gt;Flint, "New York Labor Dispute Hints at a Jurisdictional War," ''New York Times,'' May 2, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

CSEA challenged the SEIU/AFT coalition's victory, however. CSEA attorneys alleged that nearly 5,000 of the signatures on the petition forcing an election were fraudulent.&lt;ref&gt;"Hearings Consider Union Dispute," ''New York Times,'' May 21, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[New York Supreme Court]] (the state's [[trial court]] of [[general jurisdiction]]) initially dismissed the suit,&lt;ref&gt;"Civil Service Union Loses Vote Appeal," ''New York Times,'' July 21, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; but it was reinstated by a [[New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division|state appellate court]].&lt;ref&gt;"Civil Service Union Wins Appeal," ''New York Times,'' January 12, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; As the lawsuit progressed, CSEA won a new three-year contract which included a 7 percent pay hike in the first year.&lt;ref&gt;Meislin, "New York State Agrees to 7% Rise And New Merit Setup for 105,000," ''New York Times,'' March 12, 1979; "Governor Announces Three-Year Wage Pact With State's Workers," ''New York Times,'' March 13, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; But the new union, now called the Public Employees Federation, ultimately prevailed in the [[New York Court of Appeals]] (the [[supreme court|highest court]] in the state of New York) on March 28, 1979.&lt;ref&gt;"Union Awarded Right to Represent Professional Employees," ''New York Times,'' March 28, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; PEF subsequently negotiated a controversial contract which gave union members a 36 percent pay increase over three years.&lt;ref&gt;Stetson, "State Employees to Vote on New Contract Nov. 19," ''New York Times,'' November 10, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; Submitted to the members without the approval of PEF's executive council, the contract was overwhelmingly approved by PEF members on December 6, 1979.&lt;ref&gt;"State Employees Approve Pact," ''New York Times,'' December 7, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Kraemer presidency===
PEF's first president, John J. Kraemer, served a single, turbulent term in office.  He was accused of being a "no-show" employee at his previous position with the New York State Department of Labor,&lt;ref&gt;"State Accused of Paying Unionist in No-Show Job," ''New York Times,'' July 31, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; but was exonerated of the charges.&lt;ref name="PicchiStormy"&gt;Picchi, "Unionist's Career a Stormy One," ''Albany Times-Union.'' March 6, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; He also had been accused and found innocent of being paid a salary from both PEF and state.&lt;ref name="PicchiStormy" /&gt; As his legal troubles continued, Kraemer focused on negotiating the union's second contract.  Pensions were a major issue for the union.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, "State Retirees Need Pension Relief Now," ''New York Times,'' April 15, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976, the state enacted a new pension plan under which state employees paid income taxes on their mandatory contribution to the state pension plan, which PEF claimed forced workers to pay taxes on income they may never receive.&lt;ref name="Wexler"&gt;Wexler, "PEF Lobbies for Improved Pensions," ''Albany Times-Union,'' June 8, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the agreement ratified in March 1982 did not address the pension issue, the contract negotiated by Kraemer won pay raises of 9 percent the first year and 8 percent the next two years in exchange for a reduction in the number of sick days given to employees.&lt;ref&gt;Chira, "State Reaches Tentative Pact With Civil Service Employees," ''New York Times,'' February 28, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kraemer lost re-election in 1982 to Elizabeth Hoke.  The 1,100-member Statewide Coalition for a Democratic Union (SCDU), at the time PEF's only organized "political party," had formed to challenge Kraemer and support Hoke.&lt;ref name="KellyDefeats"&gt;Kelly, "PEF Chief Defeats Challenger in Primary," ''Albany Times-Union,'' February 24, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; The election was a bitter one, with Hoke accusing Kraemer of poor leadership.&lt;ref name="PicchiStormy" /&gt;

===Hoke presidency===
When Hoke assumed the presidency, she found the union was more than $400,000 in debt.&lt;ref name="PicchiStormy" /&gt; An investigation found that Kraemer had embezzled funds from the union.&lt;ref name="PicchiStormy" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Halbrook, "PEF Mourns Death of Founder, John Kraemer," ''PEF Communicator,'' December 2005-January 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kraemer would be convicted in 2000 for embezzling from another union, Local 29 of the [[Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union]], in [[Hackensack, New Jersey]]. At the time of his death, he would be under investigation for conspiring to embezzle more than $296,000 from the Professional Employee’s Guild (PEG) of Hackensack and the union’s welfare fund. See: "New York Lawyer Indicted for Alleged Union Embezzlement," press release, U.S. Department of Justice, November 1, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Kraemer pleaded guilty to the charges in early 1987.&lt;ref name="PicchiStormy" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Ex-PEF Chief Admits Theft," ''Albany Times-Union,'' March 5, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hoke's presidency was in some ways dissimilar to Kraemer's. Unlike Kraemer, Hoke took a low-key approach to the PEF presidency, rarely seeking the media spotlight or public attention.&lt;ref name="PicchiPEFGears"&gt;Picchi, "PEF Gears Up for 'Toughest' Contract Negotiations," ''Albany Times-Union,'' November 7, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; But her presidency suffered several scandals as well.  In 1984, Hoke revoked the union leave of PEF's three statewide vice presidents, a move which was very controversial among PEF members.&lt;ref&gt;"Unions Open Query Into PEF Dispute," ''Albany Times-Union,'' May 24, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, she was accused of using her PEF credit card for personal expenses.&lt;ref&gt;"Hoke 'Censors' Union Article on Credit Card Use," ''Albany Times-Union,'' September 11, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; Hoke also sued to sever PEF's dual affiliation with the AFT and SEIU, claiming the two unions held too much power over PEF and provided little services in return.&lt;ref&gt;AFT and SEIU held veto power over any changes to PEF's [[bylaws]] and constitution, the ability to establish a trusteeship over PEF, and the authority to dissolve PEF without PEF members' consent. Initially, the affiliation agreement also gave AFT and SEIU, rather than PEF members, the right to elect the PEF executive board.  See: "New York State Public Employees seek to Loosen Dual Affiliation," ''Labor Notes,'' January 26, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; The suit was unsuccessful.

Contract negotiations in 1985 were particularly contentious. PEF was especially critical of a state proposal to restructure the state employee health insurance program.&lt;ref&gt;Schmalz, "State and Its Top Union Reach A Pact," ''New York Times,'' April 1, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; Mediators had to be called in to help settle the contract.&lt;ref&gt;"Mediators Named In State Deadlock," ''Associated Press,'' April 9, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; PEF settled for 5 percent pay raises in each of the contract's three years and an accidental-death benefit.&lt;ref name="NewkirkPEFChief"&gt;Newkirk, "PEF Chief to Press for Large Pay Hikes," ''Albany Times-Union,'' November 23, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; Hoke failed to win re-election in 1985 due to member dissatisfaction with 1985 contract.&lt;ref name="PEFShudders"&gt;Gottlieb, "PEF Shudders During Contract Fight," ''Albany Times-Union,'' April 12, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; SCDU withdrew its support for Hoke and actively supported challenger Rand Condell.&lt;ref name="KellyDefeats" /&gt;

===Condell presidency===
Rand Condell struggled to bring some organizational stability to PEF.  In 1986, he settled a lawsuit against PEF by the [[New York State United Teachers]] (NYSUT) and the AFT. NYSUT and the AFT had claimed that PEF had underpaid dues for half its membership since its inception, leading to a $10 million to $12 million underpayment. In the settlement, PEF withdrew as an affiliate of NYSUT (AFT's state federation in New York) and the AFT agreed to reimburse NYSUT for the services NYSUT had rendered to PEF.  In return, PEF agreed to pay increase per capita dues payments for half its members by 71 percent (to $72 from $42) and remit the higher dues payments to the AFT.  The NYSUT disaffiliation saved PEF $3.5 million a year, but increased PEF's dues to the AFT by $600,000 a year.&lt;ref&gt;Chalmers, "Unions Near Agreement in Dues Dispute," ''Albany Times-Union,'' July 25, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

To cover the cost of the higher payments to the AFT, Condell sought a large dues increase from PEF members.  Condell proposed raising dues on a sliding scale, with its lowest-paid members incurring a 14 percent dues increase while its highest-paid members saw a 55 percent dues increase. The dues hikes would be the first since the last year of Kraemer's presidency.&lt;ref&gt;Cross, "Public Employees' Union Seeks Dues Raise," ''Albany Times-Union,'' September 27, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Condell expected easy passage of the dues hike,&lt;ref&gt;Bang-Jensen, "PEF Leaders Anticipating Dues Hike Approval," ''Albany Times-Union,'' October 17, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; the proposal did not win the 60 percent majority needed at the PEF convention in October 1986.&lt;ref&gt;"Dues Hike Defeated in PEF Vote," ''Albany Times-Union,'' October 21, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;  Condell immediately resubmitted the dues proposal to members two days later, and it easily passed (leading to an average increase of $4.08 per member per month, giving the union about $2.8 million more each year).&lt;ref&gt;"Union Approves Dues Increase," ''Albany Times-Union,'' October 21, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; The extra dues allowed PEF to build a new headquarters in [[Latham, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;Newkirk, "PEF to Break Ground for New $1.7 Million Building in Latham," ''Albany Times-Union,'' May 11, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

During his first term in office, Condell fought the state on a number of issues.  The need for higher pensions continued to rank high on the union's agenda.&lt;ref name="Wexler" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chalmers, "Retirees Push 'Pension Justice' Campaign," ''Albany Times-Union,'' June 26, 1986; Ginsberg, "Pension Raise Needed," ''New York Times,'' January 2, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; The union also fought large layoffs of state workers, particularly at the New York State Department of Labor.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, "PEF Hits States Layoff Plans," ''Albany Times-Union,'' February 3, 1987; "State Labor Cuts Under Fire," ''Albany Times-Union,'' January 23, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;  But much of the union's attention was focused on a major battle in 1987 over pay equity. The governor had proposed and the state legislature had approved a plan to give more than 42,600 state workers (about 5,000 of whom were PEF members) retroactive pay increases to make up for disparities with private-sector pay, lower wages given to women, and work in hazardous occupations.  PEF filed a [[grievance]] against the pay plan, arguing that it downgraded some of the occupational titles of its members.&lt;ref&gt;Newkirk, "Union Grieves Pay Equity Plan," ''Albany Times-Union,'' May 19, 1987; Newkirk, "CSEA, PEF Clash Over Pay Equity," ''Albany Times-Union,'' July 2, 1987; Newkirk, "Grievance Stalls PEF Pay Equity Increases," ''Albany Times-Union,'' August 5, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; PEF reacted angrily when the pay equity increase subsequently went through for all state workers except those belonging to PEF.&lt;ref&gt;Picchi, "Pay Raise Exclusion Irks Union," ''Albany Times-Union,'' August 7, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; Condell then negotiated an agreement preventing any job title downgrades, and the pay increase for PEF members went through in September 1987.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, "State, Union Reach Accord," ''Albany Times-Union,'' August 28, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Condell's first term ended, he promised to push for "substantial" pay raises in the union's upcoming contract negotiations even as his opponents attacked him for concentrating authority in staff hands and for poor leadership.&lt;ref name="PicchiPEFGears" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NewkirkPEFChief" /&gt; Nonetheless, he was challenged for the SCDU endorsement by Michael Keenan, president of PEF's largest division.&lt;ref&gt;"PEF Chief Faces Primary Challenge," ''Albany Times-Union,'' January 26, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; Condell defeated Keenan, 388 to 275.&lt;ref name="PicchiPEFHead"&gt;Picchi, "PEF Head On Way to 2nd Term," ''Albany Times-Union,'' February 24, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, a new political party, the Committee for Independent Officers, arose and successfully contended for four of the six seats for state vice president, regional coordinator, and trustee (including among its winning candidates future PEF presidents Howard Shafer and Roger Benson).&lt;ref name="PicchiPEFHead" /&gt; To firm up his political position, Condell called for a two- rather than three-year contract, with a 7 percent pay rise in each year.&lt;ref&gt;Llavore, "PEF Pushing for 7% Hike in New Pact," ''Albany Times-Union,'' March 28, 1988; Barron, "New York Unions Nearing Deadline," ''New York Times,'' March 27, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; Even when CSEA settled for a three-year agreement with salary increases of 5 percent, 5.5 percent, and 5.5 percent in each of its three years, Condell continued to push for 7 percent.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, "PEF Will Continue Demands Despite 16.3% CSEA Pact," ''Albany Times-Union,'' April 8, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; But health insurance, not pay, ended up being the biggest stumbling block.&lt;ref&gt;"CSEA Ratifies Four State Pacts," ''Albany Times-Union,'' June 3, 1988; Wexler, "PEF Blasts State on Health Insurance Pact Proposal," ''Albany Times-Union,'' June 17, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; The state declared an impasse in mid June (10 weeks after PEF's contract had expired), and mediators were called in.&lt;ref&gt;Wexler, "State Declares Impasse in PEF Talks," ''Albany Times-Union,'' June 16, 1988; Wexler, "PEF, State to Begin Mediation Monday," ''Albany Times-Union,'' June 21, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; Without the mediators' help, however, Condell reached a three-year agreement on July 11 with the same pay structure achieved by CSEA and no improvements in health benefits.&lt;ref&gt;Wexler, "Details Kept Under Wraps," ''Albany Times-Union,'' July 12, 1988; Wexler, "PEF Votes By 3 to 1 For State Pact," ''Albany Times-Union,'' September 10, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 20, 1988, PEF won its first private-sector representation election (for workers at the New York City branch of Narcotic and Drug Research Inc.—a contractor for the state).&lt;ref&gt;"PEF Wins Bid to Represent Private Employees of State Contractor," ''Albany Times-Union,'' July 27, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

Condell barely survived a serious political challenge to his presidency in 1989.  PEF spent much of the year fighting layoffs.&lt;ref&gt;Gesensway, "Unionist's State Job in Doubt," ''Albany Times-Union,'' March 10, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;  Convinced that PEF would be fighting layoffs the following year as well, Condell proposed raising dues 26.6 percent ($5.28 a month) to build a public relations and legal war chest. But PEF leaders balked at submitting the dues increase to the membership.&lt;ref&gt;Gesensway, "PEF Leaders Balk at Dues Hike," ''Albany Times-Union,'' July 15, 1989; "PEF Proposes Hiking Dues on Sliding Scale," ''United Press International,'' September 9, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; PEF's 127-member executive board refused to recommend Condell's dues hike to the membership, but agreed to submit the plan to a vote anyway.&lt;ref name="GesenswayDuesIncrease"&gt;Gesensway, "PEF Dues Increase Vote Likely Key to Future of Union President," ''Albany Times-Union,'' October 17, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; The leadership of PEF's Capitol District (its largest region) floated their own plan for a dues increase at a much lower level, and observers concluded that if Condell lost the dues vote at the upcoming PEF convention in October he would probably not be able to win re-election in 1991.&lt;ref name="GesenswayDuesIncrease" /&gt; PEF members did indeed reject Condell's proposal for a dues increase (twice), but also refused to approval six other plans for a dues increase offered by leaders of the Capitol District as well as others.&lt;ref&gt;Gesensway, "PEF Still Debating Dues at Convention," ''Albany Times-Union,'' October 18, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; After extensive parliamentary maneuvering (which some PEF members claimed was illegal), Condell was able to win approval of his original dues proposal.&lt;ref&gt;Gesensway, "PEF Delegates OK Dues Hike in Last-Minute Turnaround," ''Albany Times-Union,'' October 19, 1989; Gesensway, "PEF Dissidents Examine Dues Hike," ''Albany Times-Union,'' November 20, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

Condell's support within the union evaporated throughout 1990, and Condell fought the state over early retirement, hiring freezes, large layoffs, furloughs, and a state plan which withheld a week's pay from workers until they retired.&lt;ref&gt;Lopez, "Unionized State Workers Protest Proposed Cuts," ''Albany Times-Union,'' March 22, 1990; Precious, "Unions Oppose Cuomo Deal on Early Retirement," ''Albany Times-Union,'' April 11, 1990; Precious, "State's Workers Stall on Early Retirement," ''Albany Times-Union,'' July 22, 1990; Precious, "Cuomo Imposes Freeze on Hiring," ''Albany Times-Union,'' October 31, 1990; Borsellino, "Cuomo Will Lay Off Workers to Close Budget Gap," ''Albany Times-Union,'' November 10, 1990; Precious, "10,000 State Workers Face Budget Ax," ''Albany Times-Union,'' November 14, 1990; Precious, "State Furlough Proposal Appears Dead," ''Albany Times-Union,'' December 14, 1990; "Union Sues over Lag Payroll," ''Associated Press,'' January 11, 1991; Janison, "Unions Take On Old Friend Cuomo," ''Albany Times-Union,'' February 6, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; In this difficult employment environment, the PEF contract expired.  Negotiations with the state stalemated in March 1991, the state declared an impasse, and an arbitrator was named in April.&lt;ref&gt;Precious, "Unions Say Cuomo Broke Deal By Discussing Talks," ''Albany Times-Union,'' February 9, 1991; Precious, "Administration Hints at Impasse With PEF," ''Albany Times-Union,'' March 7, 1991; Precious, "State Breaks Off Talks With Second Union," ''Albany Times-Union,'' March 13, 1991; "Arbitrator Named for PEF Impasse," ''Albany Times-Union,'' April 12, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

Condell was challenged for the PEF presidency by Howard Shafer. Shafer, supported by the Team for a Stronger Membership caucus, ran a full slate of candidates and accused Condell of poor leadership and embracing Governor [[Mario Cuomo]] too strongly.&lt;ref&gt;Precious, "Cuomo Backing Will Be Focus of PEF President Campaign," ''Albany Times-Union,'' February 15, 1991; Borsellino, "2 Candidates Vying for PEF Presidency," ''Albany Times-Union,'' March 5, 1991; Precious, "June Union Election," ''Albany Times-Union,'' March 19, 1991; Bauder, "Union Insurgents Make Cuomo the Issue," ''Associated Press,'' June 5, 1991; Beidel, "PEF Election a War of Words," ''Albany Times-Union,'' June 13, 1991; Verhovek, "Political Talk," ''New York Times,'' June 9, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; The election was a bitter one, and Shafer contended Condell was using the union's monthly newsmagazine to promote his candidcacy&lt;ref&gt;Borsellino, "PEF Boss Getting Good Press," ''Albany Times-Union,'' March 12, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; On June 26, 1991, after record turnout, Shafer defeated Condell 3 to 1 (12,948 to 7,963, a margin of victory that surprised both candidates), and Shafer's entire ticket was swept into office.&lt;ref&gt;Beidel, "PEF Membership Ousts Condell From Presidency," ''Albany Times-Union,'' June 26, 1991; Sack, "Union Chief's Defeat Tied to Anger at Cuomo," ''New York Times,'' June 27, 1991; Beidel, "PEF Vote Reflects Union's Rebellion Against Leadership," ''Albany Times-Union,'' June 27, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scandal struck the union again in Condell's final days in office.  Condell signed an agreement which would give his senior aides lucrative severance payments worth thousands of dollars each if they were fired by Shafer.&lt;ref&gt;Precious, "Condell Offeers Aides Golden Parachutes," ''Albany Times-Union,'' July 31, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; After a half hour of debate, the PEF executive board overturned the severance agreements on Shafer's first day in office.&lt;ref&gt;Precious, "Shafer Assumes Presidency of PEF," ''Albany Times-Union,'' August 2, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shafer presidency===
At first, the expired contract Shafer inherited did not seem an intractable problem. In December 1991, PEF members ratified a contractual change to their health plan which was seen as a referendum on Shafer's leadership.&lt;ref&gt;Janison, "PEF Ratifies Health Insurance Change," ''Albany Times-Union,'' December 18, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; But negotiations for the expiring PEF contract soon broke down, a legislative fact-finding panel was imposed on the talks, and the state proposed eliminating nearly 14,000 public sector jobs.&lt;ref&gt;Janison, "Fact-Finding Panel Named in Contract Talks With PEF," ''Albany Times-Union,'' January 8, 1992; Precious, "Cuomo Poised to Eliminate 14,000 Jobs," ''Albany Times-Union,'' January 10, 1992; Janison, "State Workers Face Long Wait for Contracts," ''Albany Times-Union,'' June 21, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the governor set a June 25 deadline for resolving any contract talks. PEF held out. But when other unions settled their contracts, PEF wanted the same deal and didn't get it.&lt;ref&gt;Janison, "State's Labor Talks Make Scant Progress Despite Deadline," ''Albany Times-Union,'' June 25, 1992; Janison, "Union Wants What Others Got," ''Albany Times-Union,'' July 1, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; The state legislature adjourned without enacting any PEF contract, although it was on the verge of passing a law requiring binding arbitration between the state and PEF.&lt;ref&gt;Janison, "PEF Contract Has to Wait Until Fall, Unionist Says," ''Albany Times-Union,'' July 3, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of a contract created a crisis for many PEF members.  Nearly 153,000 PEF workers and their family members lost their prescription drug, dental care, and vision care benefits in September 1992.&lt;ref&gt;Brandon, "PEF Members Losing Some Benefits," ''Albany Times-Union,'' September 25, 1992; Janison, "PEF Members Begin to Feel Effects of the Benefits Crisis," ''Albany Times-Union,'' October 5, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; The governor urged both sides to bargain as the benefits crisis worsened,&lt;ref&gt;Gottlieb, "Cuomo Enters PEF Contract Fray," ''Albany Times-Union,'' October 7, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; although a state judge later ordered the benefits restored through the end of calendar year 1992.&lt;ref&gt;Janison, "State Judge Restores PEF Health Benefits," ''Albany Times-Union,'' October 9, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the state laid off public workers, PEF's membership dropped from 59,000 to 55,000 members, depriving the union of $1 million in dues revenue. Vacant positions on PEF's staff were eliminated or went unfilled (angering members, who felt the brunt of the grievance and service cuts), and officers took salary cuts.&lt;ref&gt;Janison, "Union Budget Target of Fight," ''Albany Times-Union,'' March 1, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; PEF members accused Shafer of playing politics with the staff cuts by jettisoning staff positions filled by his political opponents, and the PEF executive board retaliated by dismissing Roger Benson (one of Shafer's closest aides).&lt;ref&gt;Janison, "PEF Members, Angered By President, To Picket Office," ''Albany Times-Union,'' March 27, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; The internal dissent became so bad that alleged assaults, racially inflammatory fliers, and accusations of financial fraud occurred at the SEIU Convention which PEF delegates attended in May 1992.&lt;ref&gt;Janison, "PEF Factions War Over Allegations at SEIU Convention," ''Albany Times-Union,'' May 25, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; Some PEF members began circulating decertification petitions, and Shafer's political opponents formed a new caucus (Members United for a Responsible Union) to run a slate of candidates against him in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;Janison, "PEF Members Show Signs of Frustration," ''Albany Times-Union,'' October 19, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

The bargaining atmosphere deteriorated throughout the remainder of 1992. The state's chief negotiator said he would wait for the legislative fact-finding panel's recommendation, Shafer implied he might oppose a proposed bond measure which would help fund state jobs, and Shafer accused the governor of releasing private confidential negotiating information to PEF members without the union's consent.&lt;ref name="JanisonChancesIncrease"&gt;Janison, "Chances Increase That PEF Contract Will Have to Wait Until Next Year," ''Albany Times-Union,'' October 20, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; At PEF's convention in October 1992, Members United for a Responsible Union leafletted against Shafer, accused him of neglecting members' needs and trying to curry favor with the AFT.&lt;ref name="JanisonChancesIncrease" /&gt; Although the legislature passed a mandatory binding arbitration bill, the governor vetoed the legislation.&lt;ref&gt;"Cuomo Vetoes PEF Arbitration," ''Albany Times-Union,'' November 26, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; Now looking at two years without a new contract, Shafer hired [[Theodore W. Kheel]], a well-known labor negotiator, to help the union win a new pact.&lt;ref&gt;"State Union Hires Labor Negotiator," ''Albany Times-Union,'' December 31, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

PEF reached a new contract with the state in March 1993. Although the state's chief negotiation withdrew the state's last contract offer at the end of February,&lt;ref&gt;Janison, "State Withdraws Its Offer to PEF," ''Albany Times-Union,'' February 27, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; the governor personally put it back on the table.&lt;ref&gt;Janison, "Cuomo Puts Offer to PEF Back on Table," ''Albany Times-Union,'' March 18, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Shafer quickly agreed to the pact, which included a 9.5 percent salary increase over four years that was retroactive to April 1, 1991; moved PEF members into the state's health insurance pool; and ended PEF's lawsuit over the state's decision to defer a week's pay until each member retired.&lt;ref&gt;Janison, "After 2 Years Without A Contract, PEF, State Reach Tentative Accord," ''Albany Times-Union,'' March 20, 1993; Myers, "Albany and State Professionals' Union Reach Agreement on Contract," ''New York Times,'' March 20, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the PEF executive board voted to recommend the contract to PEF's members, those who voted "no" on the pact argued that PEF had achieved less than other unions, that the deal traded concessions for pay increases, and that the money spent on Kheel's consulting contract had gotten the union nothing better than what had been offered months before.&lt;ref&gt;Janison, "Rank and File to Vote in May on PEF's New Contract," ''Albany Times-Union,'' March 27, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;  The board meeting was a raucous one, with alleged physical confrontations, a "Dump Shafer" movement hanging banners near the entrance, rumors of decertification, and proposals for PEF to abandon its independence and join either SEIU or AFT.&lt;ref name="PEFShudders" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Janison, "PEF Grapples With More Than Just Contract," ''Albany Times-Union,'' March 29, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Members of PEF voted 28,774 to 7,281 to ratify the new four-year contract on May 12, 1993.&lt;ref&gt;"PEF Members Vote to Ratify New Four-Year Contract," ''Associated Press,'' May 12, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shafer was defeated for re-election as PEF president by James Sheedy in June 1994. Although Shafer and Sheedy had originally been on the same political slate three years earlier, the relationship between the two men had deteriorated into a chilly civility in which they communicated with one another largely via memo (despite having offices next door to one another). The margin of victory was 388 votes, the slimmest margin in the union's 15-year history.  Sheedy's entire slate also narrowly edged out the Shafer slate's candidates.&lt;ref&gt;Gottlieb, "Opponent Defeats PEF Chief," ''Albany Times-Union,'' June 29, 1994; Gottlieb, "Defeated PEF Chief Delays Certification Vote," ''Albany Times-Union,'' August 3, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sheedy presidency===
Sheedy spent much of his first two years in office as his predecessors did—fighting large layoffs of state workers.  Governor [[George Pataki]] vetoed legislation improving pensions, threatened to shut down state government and furlough all non-essential workers if the legislature didn't approve his budget, attempted to close state-run health care facilities, and cut more than 5,500 state jobs.&lt;ref&gt;Sack, "Pataki Vetoes Pension Rise, Citing Budget," ''New York Times,'' February 9, 1995; Precious, "Pataki Considers Massive, Temporary Layoffs," ''Albany Times-Union,'' March 9, 1995; Precious, "Pataki Won't Shut Down State," ''Albany Times-Union,'' March 29, 1995; Lipman, "Union Sues to Save Psychiatric Center," ''Albany Times-Union,'' April 9, 1996; Metzgar, "Pataki OKs Plans to Cut 5,542 Jobs," ''Albany Times-Union,'' May 11, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; In this difficult negotiating climate, Sheedy re-negotiated PEF's expiring contract in April 1995.  He agreed to the same financial package won by CSEA a month earlier: A four-year contract with a 3.5 percent salary increase in 1997 and 1998, and one-time bonuses in 1996 and 1997; a change in civil service definitions which would permit PEF workers to transfer more easily to other jobs and retain their salary levels; and no expiration date for the union's benefit packages.&lt;ref&gt;Gottlieb, "PEF Near Accord With State On New Contract," ''Albany Times-Union,'' May 5, 1995; Hurewitz, "PEF, State Reach Tentative Contract Agreement," ''Albany Times-Union,'' May 9, 1995; Gottlieb, "PEF Members OK 4-Year Labor Pact," ''Albany Times-Union,'' July 12, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; Additional job cuts occurred in 1996 and 1997, totalling 20,000 state workers.&lt;ref&gt;Lipman, "Feeling the Pain of State Job Cuts," ''Albany Times-Union,'' February 23, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; The state offered early retirement again to many employees.&lt;ref&gt;Metzgar, "State to Offer Incentive to Retire," ''Albany Times-Union,'' February 11, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; When the state pension fund showed a surplus, Sheedy found himself caught between two opposing factions of PEF members: Use the funds to lower pension contribution costs from current members, or give the surplus to retiree members as a cost-of-living increase.&lt;ref&gt;Metzgar, "State Workers, Retirees Compete for Pension Cash," ''Albany Times-Union,'' March 13, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sheedy was more successful on other issues.  He signed the union's first agreement with the state to provide [[domestic partner]] benefits in September 1994.&lt;ref&gt;Gottlieb, "PEF Agrees to Domestic Partner Benefit," ''Albany Times-Union,'' September 28, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; He fiercely fought a move to consolidate state information technology workers at sites the union felt were hazardous.&lt;ref&gt;Gottlieb, "PEF Tries to Block Move to Kingston," ''Albany Times-Union,'' July 18, 1995; Gottlieb and Precious, "Pataki, Bruno Still At Odds Over Job Move," ''Albany Times-Union,'' July 26, 1995; Lipman, "Union, State Squabble Over IBM Deal," ''Albany Times-Union,'' September 29, 1995; Gottlieb, "PEF Leader Assails Job Moves," ''Albany Times-Union,'' October 28, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; PEF also won a federal lawsuit requiring the state to pay millions of dollars in overtime to PEF members,&lt;ref&gt;Metzgar, "OT Ruling May Cost Millions," ''Albany Times-Union,'' February 17, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; and reinstated the lawsuit in state court after the state appealed.&lt;ref&gt;Metzgar, "PEF Urging Members to Sue State," ''Albany Times-Union,'' August 2, 1996; Metzgar, "PEF Sues the State to Get Overtime Pay for Workers," ''Albany Times-Union,'' May 9, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sheedy also undertook the union's first large-scale organizing campaigns since its formation. AFT, one of PEF's parent unions, assigned a full-time national organizer to help PEF organize health care workers in the private sector who worked for potential state contractors.&lt;ref&gt;Metzgar, "PEF Tries to Increase Its Members," ''Albany Times-Union,'' March 29, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; But this plan backfired politically.  In 1996, PEF won an election for 42 paraprofessional health care workers working for a private contractor at the [[Coxsackie Correctional Facility]].&lt;ref&gt;Metzgar, "42 Medical Workers Vote to Join PEF," ''Albany Times-Union,'' November 13, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; This organizing drive was highly criticized by Sheedy's political opponents, who claimed the union's executive board did not approve the organizing effort and who argued that PEF should only be organizing professional (not paraprofessional) workers.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, "PEF Move to Organizing Non-Professionals A Mistake," ''Albany Times-Union,'' November 22, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sheedy also fought openly with the PEF staff union.  Ninety-six of PEF's 120 staff belonged to Local 9265 of the [[United Steelworkers of America]] and had been working without a contract for nine months by March 1996.&lt;ref&gt;Metzgar, "Disgruntled PEF Workers Pit A Union Against A Union," ''Albany Times-Union,'' March 30, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; The staff union complained that PEF refused to negotiate over layoffs and downsizing, demanded a 10 percent pay raise (with differential pay for downstate workers), and several position upgrades. Roger Benson, former chief of staff under PEF President Howard Shafer, supported the staff union publicly and strongly criticized Sheedy for his poor labor relations.&lt;ref&gt;Metzgar, "PEF Contract Dispute Embroiled in Politics," ''Albany Times-Union,'' April 2, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; PEF and its staff union finally settled their contract dispute in June 1996.  The staff union won 3.5 percent pay increases in 1998 and 1999 and lump-sum bonuses paid in 1996 and 1997, enhancements to the dental plan, and concessions on the prescription drug plan and seniority rights.&lt;ref&gt;Metzgar, "PEF Reaches Agreement With Its Own Union Workers," ''Albany Times-Union,'' June 29, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sheedy's re-election campaign was a difficult, and ultimately unsuccessful, one.  Beginning in the spring of 1996, Roger Benson began putting together a statewide organization ("Members First") and publishing an alternative newsletter. Benson put together a full slate of officers and formally launched his campaign at PEF's October 1996 convention.&lt;ref&gt;Metzgar, "Another Bitter Race Is Possible At PEF," ''Albany Times-Union,'' October 19, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Benson announced a four-part platform: 1) Establishment of a PEF department focused on protecting employment security; 2) Budgeting substantial resources to enforce the Civil Service merit system; 3) Employment of a full-time professional contract negotiator; and 4) Elimination of officer perks.&lt;ref&gt;Metzgar, "Challenger Blames PEF President for 3 Years Without Pay Hikes," ''Albany Times-Union,'' October 23, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; A third candidate, Jim Israel (a PEF shop steward), entered the race in January 1997 but withdrew when he was unable to obtain enough signatures to secure his nomination.&lt;ref&gt;Metzgar, "3rd Candidate Enters Race for PEF Presidency," ''Albany Times-Union,'' January 16, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Benson's slate of candidates included Jane Hallum (a computer programmer) for secretary-treasurer and future PEF president Kenneth Brynien as an executive board member.&lt;ref&gt;Metzgar, "PEF Presidential Candidate Names Slate of Union Activists," ''Albany Times-Union,'' February 19, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Sheedy and Benson battled over the state pension surplus,&lt;ref&gt;Metzgar, "PEF Hopefuls Battle Over Pension Costs," ''Albany Times-Union,'' March 14, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; and engage in a letter-to-the-editor war in the newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;Metzgar, "State's 3 Major Public-Worker Unions Set to Elect Officers," ''Albany Times-Union,'' April 23, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Benson promised not to raise dues and re-open union offices, while Sheedy admitted a dues hike might be necessary in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;Metzgar, "PEF President Debates Tough Challenger," ''Albany Times-Union,'' May 28, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1997, Benson defeated Sheedy by a vote of 11,407 to 8,956.&lt;ref&gt;Metzgar, "PEF Votes to Jettison Its President Once Again," ''Albany Times-Union,'' June 25, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Benson presidency===
Roger Benson made immediate changes in the way PEF conducted its business.  He dismissed six staff members and returned to having two administrators share duties over the daily operation of the union.&lt;ref name="FireSix"&gt;Metzgar, "PEF Leader to Fire 6 Staffers," ''Albany Times-Union,'' July 3, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; He also named two close associates to the staff, and criticized the decision of the Sheedy-led executive board for enhancing the staff's severance packages.&lt;ref name="FireSix" /&gt; Local newspapers called the changes "bloodletting", and reported that additional layoffs were likely to come.&lt;ref&gt;"PEF Chief Dispatches Top Staffers," ''Albany Times-Union,'' July 14, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among PEF's major political initiatives at this time were a cost-of-living increase for worker pensions.&lt;ref&gt;"Unions Want A Crack at Budget Surplus," ''Albany Times-Union,'' January 7, 1998; Odato, "Bruno, Silver Promise Pension Reform Push," ''Albany Times-Union,'' May 6, 1998; Odato, "Unions Offer Compromise for COLA," ''Albany Times-Union,'' June 12, 1998; Odato, "Legislature to OK State Pension Hikes," ''Albany Times-Union,'' June 18, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Benson also said he would seek improvements to job security; accrual (rather than use-or-lose) for overtime, sick leave, and vacation; eliminate tiers in the pension plan; seek an end to penalties for early retirement; new workplace safety protections; an increase in the size of the state workforce; and new restrictions on contracting out.&lt;ref&gt;Odato, "State to Grapple With Unions," ''Albany Times-Union,'' January 3, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; The state replied that it would seek a four-year wage freeze.&lt;ref&gt;Jakes, "PEF Protests No-Raise Contract Offer," ''Albany Times-Union,'' April 24, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Angered by the state's response in a time of budget surpluses, Benson led PEF workers in an extensive lobbying effort.&lt;ref name="OdatoDecryZero"&gt;Odato, "State Workers Unions Decry 'Zero-Percent' Raises," ''Albany Times-Union,'' April 29, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; He also said PEF would seek a three-year rather than four-year contract, and 5 percent per year wage increases.&lt;ref name="OdatoDecryZero" /&gt; Benson also replaced the union's top negotiator in order to adopt a more aggressive stand with the state.&lt;ref&gt;Caher, "Public Employees Union Replaces Chief Negotiator," ''Albany Times-Union,'' September 9, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; The state countered with a 3 percent per year salary increase over four years, coupled with new restrictions on time off for union business, higher health care costs, and new worktime reporting requirements (all of which PEF rejected).&lt;ref&gt;Caher, "PEF Leaders Reject State's Contract Offer," ''Albany Times-Unionm'' October 2, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; At a rally at the state capital on January 5, 2000, some 5,000 (state estimate) to 25,000 (PEF estimate) workers peacefully confronted 25 Albany police and 300 New York State troopers.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin, "State Employees Brave Cold to Ask Peacefully For A Raise," ''Albany Times-Union,'' January 6, 2000; Jochnowitz, "Protest's Security at Question," ''Albany Times-Union,'' January 7, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; PEF revised its wage offer to 12 percent over three years.&lt;ref&gt;Jochnowitz, "State Workeers Union Offers New Pay Hike Proposal," ''Albany Times-Union,'' February 22, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Benson accused the state in March 2000 of dragging out the negotiations, and began a statewide radio advertising campaign against the governor.&lt;ref&gt;Jochnowitz, "PEF Head Accuses State of Retaliation," ''Albany Times-Union,'' March 28, 2000; Jochnowitz, "PEF Radio Blitz Takes Aim at Governor Over Contract," ''Albany Times-Union,'' April 4, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; In April, PEF accepted a contract with the [[New York State Canal Corporation]] with a 3 percent per year salary hike.&lt;ref&gt;"PEF Accepts Canal Corp. Contract," ''Albany Times-Union,'' April 5, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Days later, after another state union accepted a contract containing a 13.6 percent raise over four years, about 2,000 PEF members held a noisy rally outside the governor's offices demanding faster negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;Jochnowitz, "PEF Blasts Slow Contract Talks," ''Albany Times-Union,'' April 7, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Two weeks afterward, PEF agreed to end its advertising campaign and rallies as a spur to negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;Jochnowitz, "CSEA Pact Wins; PEF Adopts New Strategy," ''Albany Times-Unionm'' April 29, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; A week later, Governor George Pataki agreed to wage and pension COLAs.&lt;ref&gt;Stashenko, "Pataki Supports Pension COLA," ''Albany Times-Union,'' May 6, 2000; Jochnowitz, "Cost-of-Living Hikes to Become Permanent," ''Albany Times-Union,'' July 11, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; A tentative agreement reached on June 10, 2000, incorporated a 13 percent wage hike over four years, rejected the new working time data collection methods, and imposed slight increases in member health care payments.&lt;ref&gt;"PEF OKs Tentative Contract," ''Associated Press,'' June 11, 2000; "Governor and Union Agree on 14% Raises," ''New York Times,'' June 11, 2000; "PEF Leaders Approve Four-Year Contract," ''Albany Times-Union,'' June 28, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Union members approved the contract by a vote of 33,899 to 2,876.&lt;ref&gt;Odato, "PEF Members Approve New Pact," ''Albany Times-Union,'' August 12, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Benson revealed a financial scandal in the union during his first term in office. In July 1999, PEF sued former president James Sheedy and other former officers for allegedly [[Embezzlement|embezzling]] more than $62,000 from the union.&lt;ref name="EmbezzleSheedy"&gt;"Suit Says Former Leaders Embezzled Union Money," ''New York Times,'' July 19, 1999; Grace, "Union Accuses Ex-President of Embezzling Funds," ''Albany Times-Union,'' July 17, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; The union's lawsuit said the officers reimbursed themselves financially for sick leave they never took.&lt;ref name="EmbezzleSheedy" /&gt; But the PEF executive board retroactively approved the sick leave buybacks in a private meeting in August 1999, forcing Benson to drop the lawsuit.&lt;ref&gt;"PEF Acts to Sanction Sick Leave Cash-Ins," ''Albany Times-Union,'' August 30, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, former PEF Secretary-Treasurer Patricia Ford was convicted of [[bribery]] in June 2003.&lt;ref&gt;"Former Union Secretary-Treasurer Convicted of Taking Bribe," ''Associated Press,'' June 20, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Benson was re-elected without opposition in late 2000. He and his slate of officers were easily renominated, while an opponent received only 17 of the necessary 4,998 signatures needed to run for office.&lt;ref&gt;"PEF President's Rival Falls Short on Nomination," ''Albany Times-Union,'' May 4, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; During Benson's second term, several PEF members died during the [[September 11 attacks]] on [[New York City]]. Of the 300 PEF members who worked in the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]], 34 were killed in the attack.&lt;ref&gt;Chang, "A Month Later, State Employees Hold Memorial Service for WTC Victims," ''Associated Press,'' October 11, 2001; "McGeehan, "Employees Say No to Freedom Tower," ''New York Times,'' September 19, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of PEF's larger campaigns during Benson's time in office was fighting health care cutbacks in New York state. For several years, the union protested against staff layoffs and the closure of hospitals and other health care facilities.&lt;ref name="CryOut"&gt;Crowley, "Unions Cry Out for Remedy to Hospital Proposal," ''Albany Times-Union,'' December 14, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MoreSuits"&gt;Karlin, "More Suits Fight Hospital Closures," ''Albany Times-Union,'' March 28, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin, "Unions Protest Mental Health Moves," ''Albany Times-Union,'' March 18, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; PEF also sought increases in the number of health care workers on staff, an end to mandatory [[overtime]], and minimum worker-to-patient staffing ratios.&lt;ref&gt;Stashenko, "Union, Nurses Endorse Assembly Bills to Bolster Profession," ''Associated Press,'' May 14, 2001; Odato, "State Union Nurses Press for Solutions to Shortage," ''Albany Times-Union,'' May 15, 2001; Harlin, "Nurses Urge End to Forced Overtime," ''Albany Times-Union,'' May 5, 2004; Wechsler, "Nurses Rally for End to Mandatory Overtime," ''Albany Times Union,'' May 17, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Benson was re-elected without opposition to a third term in 2003, the first time any PEF president had been elected to a third term.&lt;ref&gt;"PEF Union Members Elect President to 3rd Term," ''Albany Times-Union,'' May 9, 2003; "Benson Wins Third Term As Union President," ''Associated Press,'' May 8, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Benson immediately entered into negotiations for a new contract after his re-election. Initially, PEF had hopes for easier contract negotiations after Governor Pataki fulfilled a promise to give PEF members three additional days of sick leave per year.&lt;ref&gt;Odato, "Sick-Day Award Adds Liability," ''Albany Times-Union,'' March 4, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; But after working without a contract for a year, PEF members found that Pataki proposed contract concessions in order to bring the state's budget into balance.&lt;ref&gt;Chang, "Labor Unions Negotiate Contract As Work Force Declines," ''Associated Press,'' January 28, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2004, after CSEA agreed to a four-year contract with an average 2.85 percent wage increase each year, Benson denounced Pataki's offer of 1 percent per year to PEF members&lt;ref&gt;Odato, "CSEA, State Agree on 4-Year Contract," ''Albany Times-Union,'' March 6, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; and a cap on state contributions to the employee pension fund.&lt;ref&gt;Odato, "Groups Eye Suit in Pension Battle," ''Albany Times-Union,'' April 22, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Once again, methods for accounting for working time became a major sticking point in the negotiations, with Benson characterizing this as a "deal-breaker."&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin, "Time Issue Hangs Up PEF-State Deal," ''Albany Times-Union,'' June 29, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; But in July 2004, PEF agreed to a new four-year contract which included salary increases of $800 in the first year; 2.5 percent, 2.75 percent, and 3 percent salary increases in the last three years; and a new "locality pay" increase for workers in the mid-[[Hudson Valley]] region (where the cost of living was significantly higher than surrounding areas).&lt;ref&gt;"State and Union Reach Contract Agreement," ''Associated Press,'' July 19, 2004; Farrell, "PEF, State Ink Tentative Agreement," ''New York Daily News,'' July 28, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2005, Benson declined to run for a fourth term in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;"PEF Leaders Announce They Won't Run Again," ''Albany Times-Union,'' February 8, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the final achievements of the Benson presidency was enactment of legislation requiring the state to disclose the number and amount of money spent on private contractors. PEF began its campaign in the fall of 2005, and Governor Pataki signed the legislation in March 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, "State Must Stop Private Consultant Contracts," ''Albany Times Union,'' August 24, 2005; Woodruff, "Union Pushes for Contract Disclosure Bill," ''Albany Times Union," November 22, 2005; Kriss, "Union: Inspectors A Waste of Money," ''Syracuse Post-Standard," November 22, 2005; "PEF Bills Keep Pushing for Tax Accountability," ''Albany Times Union,'' February 24, 2006; Odato, "Opening Books On Contract Services," ''Albany Times Union,'' March 23, 2006; "Pataki Signs Bill Sought By Union Against Consulting Contracts," ''Associated Press,'' March 22, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brynien presidency===
Kenneth Brynien was elected PEF president over Michael Del Piano on June 27, 2006, by a vote of 7,874 to 7,024 (a margin of 850 votes, or 5.8 percent).&lt;ref&gt;"'Members 1st' Ticket Wins PEF Election," ''Albany Times-Union,'' June 28, 2006; [http://albany.bizjournals.com/albany/stories/2006/06/26/daily30.html "PEF Vice-President Elected to Top Post,"] ''Albany Business Review,'' June 28, 2006; "Cicero Man Elected to Lead Public Employees Union," ''Syracuse Post-Standard,'' June 28, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Brynien said a major goal of his presidency would be to enhance PEF's legislative efforts in the state capital.&lt;ref name="UniontoFlex"&gt;Odato, "Union to Flex Political Power," ''Albany Times-Union,'' December 18, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Brynien and the union confronted a state proposal to close or merge several state-owned hospitals and other health care facilities during his first year in office. A state commission first proposed the plan in November 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Mulder and Kriss, "Privatizing University Hospital Debated," ''Syracuse Post-Standard,'' November 22, 2006; "Hospital Dilemma Waits On Spitzer," ''Albany Times Union,'' November 29, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Brynien and PEF strongly opposed the plan, claiming it would harm patients and lead to lower levels of care.&lt;ref&gt;Odato, "Hospital Closing Plan Gains Momentum," ''Albany Times Union,'' December 2, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; PEF's parent union, SEIU, said it would not oppose the plan.&lt;ref&gt;"Hospital Closure Plan Debated Across State," ''Albany Business Review,'' December 11, 2006; Mulder, "SEIU: We Won't Oppose Hospital Downsizing," ''Syracuse Post-Standard,'' December 7, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; PEF began a series of public protests and a legislative lobbying effort to prevent the closures and mergers.&lt;ref name="CryOut" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mulder, "Four Unions at Hospital Start Ad Blitz," ''Syracuse Post-Standard,'' June 6, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; It also sued to prevent the plan from being implemented.&lt;ref name="MoreSuits" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mulder, "Unions at Upstate Sue to Halt Changes," ''Syracuse Post-Standard,'' March 28, 2007; "Unions Sue New York Hospital Closing Commission," ''Associated Press,'' March 27, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Brynien negotiated a new collective bargaining agreement for PEF in 2008. Negotiations for the new contract were short and generated almost no public notice. The four-year contract's terms, which were retroactive to April 2007 (the date the old agreement expired), included an average 4 percent wage increase per year, higher pay for employees working in or near New York City, new health insurance benefits, and improved educational benefits.&lt;ref name="StatePefAnnounce"&gt;"State, PEF Announce Tentative 4-Year Contract," ''Albany Times-Union,'' February 6, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"NY Reaches Tentative Labor Contract With State Workers Union," ''Associated Press,'' February 5, 2008; "New State Worker Contract Includes Higher Pay, Better Health Care," ''Associated Press,'' April 12, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; About two-thirds of PEF members voted in contract approval balloting, with the pact receiving 97 approval for those who did vote.&lt;ref&gt;"PEF Members Approve New Contract With State," ''Albany Times Union,'' April 12, 2008; "PEF Members Approve New Contract With State," ''Associated Press,'' April 12, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

During Brynien's first term as president, PEF also won a long-sought ban on mandatory overtime. Legislation on the issue was introduced in May 2007,&lt;ref&gt;"Nurses Seek Relief From Mandatory Overtime," ''Albany Times Union,'' May 23, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and on June 18, 2008, Governor [[David Paterson]] signed into law a ban on mandatory overtime in state facilities.&lt;ref&gt;Gormley, "Legislature, Paterson Agree to School, Nurse, Energy Deal," ''Associated Press,'' June 18, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Three months later, PEF successfully lobbied the state legislature to provide for permanent collection of union dues and a "fair share" provision in the dues structure. Under prior New York State law, the state was required to collect dues on PEF's behalf (through the state's payroll system) and forward these monies to the union. Non-members were not required to pay dues to the union, even though the union was required by law to represent these workers. This law required [[Sunset provision|renewal]] every two years. PEF had long sought a permanent version of the law, one which enacted a [[Union security agreement#Types|"fair share" provision]] requiring non-members to pay a portion of dues (for the services they received). The state legislature finally passed just such a law in July 2008, and it was signed into law by Governor Paterson.&lt;ref&gt;Peters, "Union Dues Now Permanently Mandatory for Public Employees," ''New York Times,'' July 24, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

PEF also became embroiled in major battles with Governor Paterson over the state budget, which occupied much of the remainder of Brynien's first term and the first few years of his second. When the [[late-2000s recession]] severely depressed New York state tax revenues, Paterson demanded that PEF and other state employee unions re-open their contracts and adopt a wage freeze and other concessions to help the state balance its budget.&lt;ref&gt;Bauman, "NY Public Worker Unions Oppose Reopening Contracts," ''Associated Press,'' November 10, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; PEF refused.&lt;ref name="SichkoUrged"&gt;Sichko, "Paterson Urged to Reconsider Union Layoffs," ''Albany Business Review,'' March 31, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; PEF countered by suggesting a program of [[Retirement#Early retirement|early retirement]], which lawmakers began discussing.&lt;ref&gt;Goldberg, "State Workers Join Budget-Cutting Foes," ''Syracuse Post-Standard,'' November 18, 2008; Bauman, "Early Retirement Possibility for State Employees", ''Associated Press,'' December 2, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; PEF also demanded that the state cut the number of independent contractors working for the state, arguing that New York could save up to $700 million by reducing the number of contractors or reducing payments to them.&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, [http://www.stargazette.com/article/20081204/NEWS01/812040330/1001/news "Public-Employee Union Urges State to Cut Consultants,"] ''Elmira Star-Gazette,'' December 4, 2008; Gallagher, "Union Wants State to Rein in Spending on Consultants," ''Ithaca Journal,'' December 4, 2008; Matthews, "Union Wants State to Rein in Consultant Hiring," ''Westchester Journal News,'' December 4, 2008; Gallagher, "Consultants An Issue As Wrangling Over N.Y.

Brynien was re-elected as PEF's president in June 2009 after no opposition candidate emerged.&lt;ref&gt;Halbrook, [http://www.thecommunicator.org/062009/electionpef.htm "PEF Top Officers Get New 3-Year Terms,"] ''PEF Communicator,'' June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2009, PEF also fought a campaign to prevent the state from ordering the mandatory [[Vaccine|vaccination]] of thousands of state health care workers against the [[Influenza A virus subtype H1N1|H1N1 flu virus]] (popularly known as the "swine flu"). The state ordered the mandatory vaccinations on September 30, 2009. Brynien and other PEF leaders demanded that the state make the vaccinations voluntary, arguing that the mass vaccination plan did not provide for exemptions for worker safety, such as pregnant women or those with severe allergies; the vaccine had not yet been properly tested for safety; and the vaccine did not provide enough protection to outweigh the invasion of civil rights.&lt;ref&gt;Mulder, "Up In Arms Over Mandatory Flu Shots," ''Syracuse Post-Standard,'' October 2, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; PEF sued, and on October 15 a state court agreed and imposed a temporary injunction preventing implementation of the plan.&lt;ref&gt;"NY Judge Temporarily Blocks Mandatory Flu Vaccines," ''Associated Press,'' October 16, 2009; Matthews, "Union Gets Restraining Order On State's H1N1 Mandate," ''Westchester Journal News,'' October 17, 2009; Hartocollis and Chan, "Albany Judge Blocks Vaccination Rule," ''New York Times,'' October 17, 2009; Mulder, "Judge Blocks Forced Flu Shots," ''Syracuse Post-Standard,'' October 17, 2009; Crowley, "Court Halts Flu Order" ''Albany Times Union,'' October 17, 2009; "Public-Workers Union Sues State Over H1N1 Vaccine Mandate," ''Poughkeepsie Journal,'' October 16, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The state withdrew its plan a week later.&lt;ref&gt;Bauman, "NY Officials Rescind Mandatory H1N1 Flu Shot Order," ''Associated Press,'' October 23, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Six months after the pension deal was reached, however, Governor Paterson announced he would seek to prevent PEF members from receiving their scheduled 4 percent salary increase and seek [[furlough]]s of state workers to help close yet another budget deficit. Paterson raised the issues of furloughs in mid-August, just two months after the pension deal was reached.&lt;ref&gt;Demare, "Unions Fighting Forced Days Off," ''Albany Times-Union,'' August 12, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; PEF countered once again by arguing that the state spent $3 billion a year on 23,000 consultants at a cost that was 62 percent higher than hiring a permanent worker.&lt;ref&gt;"Union, Assembly Push to End 'Temporary' Hires," ''Associated Press,'' January 14, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; On April 1, 2010, Paterson demanded that PEF forgo its scheduled wage hike, but PEF refused to do so.&lt;ref&gt;Spector, "Paterson Calls On Unions to Forgo Raises," ''Rochester Democrat and Chronicle,'' April 2, 2010; Precious, "Unions Reject Governor On Wage Freeze," ''Buffalo News,'' April 2, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; About a week later, Paterson withheld the pay increase unilaterally, leading to strong denunciations by the union.&lt;ref&gt;Gormley, "AP Source: Paterson to Suspend Union Raises," ''Associated Press,'' April 8, 2010; Scott, "Gov.

Governor Paterson then proposed laying off 10,000 state workers on January 1, 2011 (the day after his no-layoff pledge with the unions expired)—a plan PEF also opposed.&lt;ref&gt;Madore, "Paterson, Silver Warn of Layoffs," ''Newsday,'' May 18, 2010; Virtanen, "NY Governor Planning for Mass State Worker Layoffs," ''Associated Press,'' June 1, 2010; Precious, "Paterson Will Target State Layoffs Jan. 1," ''Buffalo News,'' June 2, 2010; Confessore, "Paterson Defends Layoff Plan, Blaming Union Leaders," ''New York Times,'' June 2, 2010; Dicker, "Gov Sharpens Ax – Laying Groundwork for Layoffs," ''New York Post,'' June 2, 2010; Madore and Epstein, "Paterson Plans For Layoffs," ''Newsday,'' June 2, 2010; Confessore, "Governor Now Focuses On Layoffs to Cut Budget," ''New York Times,'' June 1, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 1, 2010, during the height of the tension created by the fiscal crisis, ''The New York Post'' ran an article revealing that Ken Brynien had enjoyed an increase in salary of $25,000 annually from $112,440 in 2008 to $137,622 in 2010.

===Kent presidency===
On June 25, 2012, Susan Kent, a credentialing specialist at the New York State Education Department, defeated Ken Brynien, 8,739 to 7,562. Roughly a third of all eligible PEF members cast votes. Carlos Garcia, a member of Kent's "NY Union Proud" slate, defeated PEF Secretary-Treasurer Joe Fox, 8,111 to 8,063. A number of NY Union Proud members also won election to the PEF executive board.  Kent pledged during the campaign to be tougher in negotiations with the state.&lt;ref name="KentWins" /&gt;

==Political activity==
Although PEF was politically active in the first eight years of its existence, it was not notably so.  That changed in 1986, the first time the Public Employees Federation engaged in an organized, statewide legislative lobbying effort (it sought passage of a "[[toxic tort]]" bill which would permit individuals harmed by exposure to toxic substances a longer period of time to file a lawsuit to recover damages).&lt;ref&gt;Chalmers, "PEF Members Launch Statewide Lobbying Effort," ''Albany Times-Union,'' May 6, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; PEF also contributed $150,000 to state political campaigns in the first six months of 1986, ranking it among the top [[Political action committee|PACs]] in the state.&lt;ref name="RothBoosts"&gt;Roth, "PEF Boosts Its Political Contributions to Gain Influence," ''Albany Times-Union,'' August 3, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; This was more money than PEF had contributed in all of 1984 (the previous election cycle).&lt;ref name="RothBoosts" /&gt; PEF quickly became noted for the amount of money it spent on election efforts and on campaigns to oppose legislation it disagreed with. In 1987, PEF spent $36,822 on state political party-building efforts, more than any other group in New York State.&lt;ref&gt;"New York Lobbyists Spent $17 Million in '87," ''Associated Press,'' March 13, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, PEF spent $570,841 on political campaigns—behind only the [[New York State AFL-CIO]] ($1 million), the Civil Service Employees Association ($704,875), and the [[Medical Society of the State of New York]] ($695,275).&lt;ref&gt;Lynn, "Campaign-Fund Hearings End Quietly," ''New York Times,'' March 18, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; PEF spent $25,000 on an advertising campaign in the spring of 1990 to fight a plan to privatize state mental health services.&lt;ref&gt;Sack, "Cuomo Turning Budget Gap Into Tool to Sell Policy Shifts," ''New York Times,'' February 21, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, PEF spent $200,000 on an advertising campaign to defeat reductions in the state workforce and another $150,000 to support incumbents in state legislative election campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;Sack, "Cuomo Plan: Protect Jobs, Raise Taxes," ''New York Times,'' May 10, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; It also spent at least $1 million that year on television ads urging the state legislature to pass higher state income and sales taxes.&lt;ref&gt;Purdum, "Realtors' Ads To Protest Rise in Taxes," ''New York Times,'' April 2, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, PEF ranked third among PACs in spending on state-level elections in New York, pumping $419,928 into these races.&lt;ref&gt;Dao, "Once Again, Record Levels Of Lobbying," ''New York Times,'' March 16, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, newly elected PEF President Kenneth Brynien, who had been a PEF vice-president for three years and chairman of PEF's political action committee for nine years, pledged to further boost PEF's political influence.&lt;ref name="UniontoFlex" /&gt;

PEF has also been active in endorsing candidates for political office.  But some of these endorsements have proven highly contentious within the union.  In 1990, PEF endorsed [[Mario Cuomo]] for governor, but the endorsement was bitterly debated within the union and the support PEF pledged to Cuomo's re-election effort was considered "tepid".&lt;ref&gt;Precious, "PEF Leaders Fight Over Gubernatorial Endorsement," ''Albany Times-Union,'' August 14, 1990; Precious, "PEF Gives Cuomo Tepid Endorsement," ''Albany Times-Union,'' August 15, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; PEF remained neutral in Cuomo's 1994 re-election campaign.&lt;ref&gt;"Cuomo Wins Endorsement From Teachers," ''New York Times,'' August 11, 1994; Precious, "PEF Jilts Cuomo," ''Albany Times-Union,'' August 6, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Cuomo was defeated for re-election by George Pataki. PEF remained neutral again during Pataki's successful 1998 re-election bid.&lt;ref&gt;Perez-Pena, "Taking a Political Detour, Unions Shift Into Neutral," ''New York Times,'' September 1, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; But in 2002, PEF supported Pataki for election to a third term.&lt;ref&gt;Gormley, "Pataki Lands White-Collar Union Support," ''Associated Press,'' August 2, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; According to PEF President Roger Benson, the endorsement was a ''[[quid pro quo]]'' for Pataki's promise to add three days of paid sick leave to the union's collective bargaining agreement and for a promise not to lay off any state workers in the following budget year.&lt;ref name="DewanBalk"&gt;Dewan, "Some Members Balk at Union Support for Pataki," ''New York Times,'' October 1, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Some PEF members were deeply angered by the union's endorsement, however, and an internal union poll of the union's health care division showed they overwhelmingly supported Pataki's opponent (New York Comptroller [[Carl McCall|H. Carl McCall]]).&lt;ref name="DewanBalk" /&gt; Pro-McCall members of the union submitted a resolution to the union's annual convention which would have rescinded the endorsement.&lt;ref name="DewanBalk" /&gt; PEF members voted down the resolution on October 8, 2002.&lt;ref&gt;Hernández and Archibold, "As Teachers Back Pataki, McCall Questions Motives," ''New York Times,'' October 9, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, PEF endorsed [[New York State Attorney General]] [[Eliot Spitzer]] in his successful run for governor.&lt;ref&gt;"State Employee Union Endorses Spitzer," ''Albany Business Review,'' June 9, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, [[Andrew Cuomo]] ran to replace Spitzer as New York State Attorney General. PEF declined to endorse Cuomo, instead backing [[New York City Public Advocate]] [[Mark J. Green]] in his unsuccessful bid for that office.&lt;ref&gt;Odato, "Cuomo Secures Union Backing," ''Albany Times Union,'' August 15, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; On July 21, 2009, PEF leaders indicated they might not support David Paterson in the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] primary if he chooses to run for re-election as governor.&lt;ref&gt;Hernandez, "Unions May Drop Paterson in 2010," ''New York Times,'' July 22, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Quantum satis''' (abbreviation '''q.s.''' or '''Q.S.''') is a [[Latin]] term meaning '''the amount which is enough'''. It has its origins as a [[quantity]] specification in [[medicine]] and [[pharmacology]],{{citation needed|date=October 2010}} where a similar term ''quantum sufficit'' ("as much as is sufficient") has been used (abbreviated Q.S.).&lt;ref&gt;E. Cobham Brewer 1810–1897. [http://www.bartleby.com/81/13830.html Dictionary of Phrase and Fable. 1898.]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Quantum satis'' is also used in the same function in [[food safety|food regulations and food safety laws in the European Community]] (EC/EU).

The specification of ''quantum satis'' for an ingredient essentially means "Add as much of this ingredient as is needed to achieve the desired result, but not more."

In food safety regulations in the EU it is a catch-all restriction for artificial food ingredients (especially [[food additive]]s) which are harmless enough to have no specific quantity restriction.

It serves to protect consumers from the addition of excessive and unnecessary amounts of such artificial food additives in their foodstuffs and compels producers to:

* Introduce minimal additives to food for human consumption

[[File:Affection in wheelchair.jpeg|thumb|upright=1.35|right|alt=A woman in a wheelchair embracing a man in a chair|Spinal cord injury affects sexual function, but many people with the condition have fulfilling relationships and sex lives.]]
Although [[spinal cord injury]] (SCI) often causes [[sexual dysfunction]], many people with SCI are able to have satisfying sex lives. Physical limitations acquired from SCI affect [[sexual function]] and sexuality in broader areas, which in turn has important effects on quality of life. Damage to the [[spinal cord]] impairs its ability to transmit messages between the brain and parts of the body below the level of the [[lesion]]. This results in lost or reduced [[sensory system|sensation]] and [[flaccid paralysis|muscle motion]], and affects [[orgasm]], [[erection]], [[ejaculation]], and [[vaginal lubrication]]. More indirect causes of sexual dysfunction include pain, weakness, and side effects of medications. Psycho-social causes include [[Major depressive disorder|depression]] and altered [[self-image]]. Many people with SCI have satisfying [[sex life|sex lives]], and many experience [[sexual arousal]] and orgasm. People with SCI employ a variety of adaptations to help carry on their sex lives healthily, by focusing on different areas of the body and types of sexual acts. [[Neuroplasticity|Neural plasticity]] may account for increases in sensitivity in parts of the body that have not lost sensation, so people often find newly sensitive [[eroticism|erotic]] areas of the skin in [[erogenous zone]]s or near borders between areas of preserved and lost sensation.

Drugs, devices, surgery, and other interventions exist to help men achieve erection and ejaculation. Although [[Fertility#Male fertility|male fertility]] is reduced, many men with SCI can still father children, particularly with medical interventions. [[Fertility#Female fertility|Women's fertility]] is not usually affected, although precautions must be taken for [[prenatal care|safe pregnancy]] and delivery. People with SCI need to take measures during sexual activity to deal with SCI effects such as weakness and movement limitations, and to avoid injuries such as skin damage in areas of reduced sensation. Education and counseling about sexuality is an important part of [[Rehabilitation in spinal cord injury|SCI rehabilitation]] but is often missing or insufficient. Rehabilitation for children and adolescents aims to promote healthy development of sexuality and includes education for them and their families. Culturally inherited biases and stereotypes negatively affect people with SCI, particularly when held by professional caregivers. [[Body image]] and other insecurities affect sexual function, and have profound repercussions on [[self-esteem]] and self-concept. SCI causes difficulties in romantic partnerships, due to problems with sexual function and to other stresses introduced by the injury and disability, but many of those with SCI have fulfilling relationships and marriages. Relationships, self-esteem, and reproductive ability are all aspects of [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], which encompasses not just [[Human sexual activity|sexual practices]] but a complex array of factors: cultural, social, psychological, and emotional influences.

== Sexuality and identity ==
&lt;!--SEXUALITY DEFINED--&gt;
[[Human sexuality|Sexuality]] is an important part of each person's identity, although some people might have no interest in sex. Sexuality has biological, psychological, emotional, spiritual, social, and cultural aspects.{{sfn|Whipple|2013|p=19}} It involves not only sexual behaviors but relationships, self-image, [[Libido|sex drive]],{{sfn|Alpert|Wisnia|2009|p=123}} reproduction, [[sexual orientation]], and [[Gender|gender expression]].&lt;ref name="Fritz15" /&gt; Each person's sexuality is influenced by lifelong [[socialization]], in which factors such as [[Religion and sexuality|religious]] and cultural background play a part,{{sfn|Francoeur|2013|p=11}} and is expressed in self-esteem and the beliefs one holds about oneself (identifying as a woman, or as an attractive person).{{sfn|Whipple|2013|p=19}}

SCI is extremely disruptive to sexuality, and it most frequently happens to young people, who are at a peak in their sexual and reproductive lives.&lt;ref name="Fritz15" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cramp15" /&gt; Yet the importance of sexuality as a part of life is not diminished by a disabling injury.&lt;ref name="Hardoff12" /&gt; Although for years people with SCI were believed to be [[asexuality|asexual]], research has shown sexuality to be a high priority for people with SCI{{sfn|Elliott|2009|p=514}} and an important aspect of [[quality of life]].&lt;ref name=Chehensse2013 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Simpson12" /&gt; In fact, of all abilities they would like to have return, most [[paraplegia|paraplegics]] rated sexual function as their top priority, and most [[tetraplegia|tetraplegics]] rated it second, after hand and arm function.&lt;ref name="Alexander08" /&gt;{{sfn|Elliott|2012|p=143}} Sexual function has a profound impact on self-esteem and adjustment to life post-injury.&lt;ref name="Courtois15" /&gt; People who are able to adapt to their changed bodies and to have satisfying sex lives have better overall quality of life.&lt;ref name="Cramp15" /&gt;

== Sexual function ==
SCI usually causes sexual dysfunction,{{sfn|Courtois|Charvier|2015|p=225}} due to problems with sensation and the body's arousal responses. The ability to experience sexual pleasure and orgasm are among the top priorities for sexual rehabilitation among injured people.&lt;ref name="BorisoffElliott2010" /&gt;

Much research has been done into [[erection]].&lt;ref name="BorisoffElliott2010" /&gt; By two years post-injury, 80% of men recover at least partial erectile function,&lt;ref name="Hesse12" /&gt; though many experience [[erectile dysfunction|problems]] with the reliability and duration of their erections if they do not use interventions to enhance them.{{sfn|Elliott|2012|p=146}} Studies have found that half&lt;ref name="Hesse12" /&gt; or up to 65% of men with SCI have orgasms,{{sfn|Courtois|Charvier|2015|p=228}} although the experience may feel different than it did before the injury.&lt;ref name="Hesse12" /&gt; Most men say it feels weaker, and takes longer and more stimulation to achieve.{{sfn|Kohut ''et al''.|2015|p=1507}}

Common problems women experience post-SCI are [[Dyspareunia|pain with intercourse]] and difficulty achieving orgasm.&lt;ref name="Ricciardi07" /&gt; Around half of women with SCI are able to reach orgasm, usually when their [[sex organ|genitals]] are stimulated.&lt;ref name="Perrouin-Verbe13" /&gt; Some women report the sensation of orgasm to be the same as before the injury, and others say the sensation is reduced.&lt;ref name="Cramp15" /&gt;

=== Complete and incomplete injury ===
The severity of the injury is an important aspect in determining how much sexual function returns as a person recovers.&lt;ref name="Hesse12" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dimitriadis10" /&gt; According to the [[American Spinal Injury Association]] grading scale, an [[spinal cord injury#Complete and incomplete injuries|incomplete SCI]] is one in which some amount of sensation or motor function is preserved in the [[rectum]].&lt;ref name="Alexander08" /&gt; This indicates that the brain can still send and receive some messages to the lowest parts of the spinal cord, beyond the damaged area. In people with incomplete injury, some or all of the [[spinal tracts]] involved in sexual responses remain intact, allowing, for example, orgasms like those of uninjured people.{{sfn|Elliott|2010a|p=415}} In men, having an incomplete injury improves chances of being able to achieve erections&lt;ref name="Dimitriadis10" /&gt;{{sfn|Sabharwal|2013|p=306}} and orgasms over those with complete injuries.{{sfn|Elliott|2009|p=518}}{{sfn|Daroff|Fenichel|Jankovic|Mazziotta|2012|p=980}}

&lt;!--ORGASM &amp; COMPLETE SCI--&gt;
Even people with complete SCI, in whom the spinal cord cannot transmit any messages past the level of the lesion, can achieve orgasm.&lt;ref name="Hesse12" /&gt;{{sfn|Courtois|Charvier|2015|p=228}}&lt;ref name="Courtois11" /&gt; In 1960, in one of the earliest studies to look at orgasm and SCI, the term ''phantom orgasm'' was coined to describe women's perception of orgasmic sensations despite SCI—but subsequent studies have suggested the experience is not merely psychological.&lt;ref name="Alexander08" /&gt; Men with complete SCI report sexual sensations at the time of ejaculation, accompanied by physical signs normally found at orgasm, such as increased blood pressure.&lt;ref name="Courtois11" /&gt; Women can experience orgasm with vibration to the [[cervix]] regardless of level or completeness of injury; the sensation is the same as uninjured women experience.&lt;ref name="Rees" /&gt;
&lt;!--VAGUS NERVE--&gt;
The [[Peripheral nervous system|peripheral]] nerves of the [[parasympathetic nervous system]] that carry messages to the brain ([[afferent nerve fiber]]s) may explain why people with complete SCI feel sexual and climactic sensations.&lt;ref name="Courtois11" /&gt; One proposed explanation for orgasm in women despite complete SCI is that the [[vagus nerve]] bypasses the spinal cord and carries sensory information from the genitals directly to the brain.&lt;ref name="Alexander08" /&gt;{{sfn|Daroff|Fenichel|Jankovic|Mazziotta|2012|p=980}}&lt;ref name="Komisaruk04" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LombardiDel10" /&gt; Women with complete injuries can achieve sexual arousal and orgasm through stimulation of the clitoris, cervix, or vagina, which are each innervated by different nerve pathways, which suggests that even if SCI interferes with one area, function might be preserved in others.{{sfn|Courtois|Charvier|2015|pp=232–34}} In both injured and uninjured people, the brain is responsible for the way sensations of climax are perceived: the qualitative experiences associated with climax are modulated by the brain, rather than a specific area of the body.&lt;ref name="Courtois11" /&gt;

=== Level of injury ===

}}
In addition to completeness of injury, the location of damage on the spinal cord influences how much sexual function is retained or regained after injury.&lt;ref name="Ricciardi07" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ProgressPromise" /&gt; Injuries can occur in the [[Cervical vertebrae|cervical]] (neck), [[Thoracic vertebrae|thoracic]] (back), [[lumbar vertebrae|lumbar]] (lower back), or [[sacrum|sacral]] (pelvic) levels.{{sfn|Field-Fote|2009|p=5}} Between each pair of vertebrae, [[spinal nerve]]s branch off of the spinal cord and carry information to and from specific parts of the body.{{sfn|Field-Fote|2009|p=5}} The location of injury to the spinal cord maps to the body, and the area of skin innervated by a specific spinal nerve, is called a [[dermatome (anatomy)|dermatome]]. All dermatomes below the level of injury to the spinal cord may lose sensation.&lt;ref name="NINDS13" /&gt;

An injury at a lower point on the spine does not necessarily mean better sexual function; for example, people with injuries in the sacral region are less likely to be able to orgasm than those with injuries higher on the spine.{{sfn|Elliott|2012|p=155}} Women with injuries above the sacral level have a greater likelihood of orgasm in response to stimulation of the clitoris than those with sacral injuries (59% vs 17%).{{sfn|Courtois|Charvier|2015|p=234}} In men, injuries above the sacral level are associated with better function in terms of erections and ejaculation, and fewer and less severe reports of dysfunction.{{sfn|Courtois|Charvier|2015|p=228}} This may be due to reflexes that do not require input from the brain, which sacral injuries might interrupt.{{sfn|Courtois|Charvier|2015|p=228}}

=== Psychogenic and reflexogenic responses ===
[[File:Psychogenic and reflexogenic arrows.svg|thumb|right|alt=Nerves travel between the penis and spinal cord.|Nerves involved in arousal comprise two major pathways: inhibitory input from the psychogenic pathway is sympathetic, and stimulation by the reflexogenic is parasympathetic.{{sfn|Elliott|2012|p=144}}]]
The body's physical arousal response (vaginal lubrication and engorgement of the [[clitoris]] in women and erection in men) occurs due to two separate pathways which normally work together: [[wikt:psychogenic|psychogenic]] and reflex.{{sfn|Sabharwal|2013|p=304}} Arousal due to fantasies, visual input, or other mental stimulation is a psychogenic sexual experience, and arousal resulting from physical contact to the genital area is reflexogenic.{{sfn|The Mayo Clinic|2011|pp=143–44}} In psychogenic arousal, messages travel from the brain via the spinal cord to the nerves in the genital area.{{sfn|The Mayo Clinic|2011|p=143}} The psychogenic pathway is served by the spinal cord at levels [[thoracic spinal nerve 11|T11]]–[[Lumbar spinal nerve 2|L2]].{{sfn|Elliott|2009|p=516}} &lt;!--T10? {{sfn|Elliott|2012|p=145}}--&gt; Thus people injured above the level of the T11 vertebra do not usually experience psychogenic erection or vaginal lubrication, but those with an injury below [[thoracic spinal nerve 12|T12]] can.&lt;ref name="Hesse12" /&gt; Even without these physical responses, people with SCI often feel aroused, just as uninjured people do.&lt;ref name="Hesse12" /&gt; The ability to feel the sensation of a pinprick and light touch in the dermatomes for T11–L2 predicts how well the ability to have psychogenic arousal is preserved in both sexes.{{sfn|Elliott|2010a|pp=413, 431}}{{sfn|Elliott|2012|p=146}} Input from the psychogenic pathway is [[sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic]], and most of the time it sends inhibitory signals that prevent the physical arousal response; in response to sexual stimulation, excitatory signals are increased and inhibition is reduced.{{sfn|Elliott|2012|p=144–45}} Removing the inhibition that is normally present allows the spinal reflexes that trigger the arousal response to take effect.{{sfn|Elliott|2012|p=144–45}}

The reflexogenic pathway activates the parasympathetic nervous system in response to the sensation of touch.{{sfn|Kohut ''et al''.|2015|p=1506}} It is mediated by a reflex arc that goes to the spinal cord (not to the brain){{sfn|Kohut ''et al''.|2015|p=1506}} and is served by the sacral segments of the spinal cord at [[sacral spinal nerve 2|S2]]–[[sacral spinal nerve 4|S4]].{{sfn|Elliott|2009|p=516}}{{sfn|The Mayo Clinic|2011|pp=143–44}} A woman with a spinal cord lesion above T11 may not be able to experience psychogenic vaginal lubrication, but may still have reflex lubrication if her sacral segments are uninjured.&lt;ref name="Rees" /&gt; Likewise, although a man's ability to get a psychogenic erection when mentally aroused may be impaired after a higher-level SCI, he may still be able to get a reflex or "spontaneous" erection.&lt;ref name="Dimitriadis10" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rees" /&gt; These erections may result in the absence of psychological arousal when the penis is touched or brushed, e.g. by clothing,&lt;ref name="Consortium10" /&gt; but they do not last long and are generally lost when the stimulus is removed.&lt;ref name="Hesse12" /&gt; Reflex erections may increase in frequency after SCI, due to the loss of inhibitory input from the brain that would suppress the response in an uninjured man.{{sfn|Elliott|2009|p=516}} Conversely, an injury below the S1 level impairs reflex erections but not psychogenic erections.&lt;ref name="Dimitriadis10" /&gt; People who have some preservation of sensation in the dermatomes at the S4 and S5 levels and display a [[bulbocavernosus reflex]] (contraction of the pelvic floor in response to pressure on the clitoris or [[glans penis]]) are usually able to experience reflex erections or lubrication.&lt;ref name="Consortium10" /&gt; Like other reflexes, reflexive sexual responses may be lost immediately after injury but return over time as the individual recovers from [[spinal shock]].{{sfn|Courtois|Charvier|2015|p=236}}

=== Factors in reduced function ===
Most people with SCI have problems with the body's physical sexual arousal response.{{sfn|Elliott|2009|p=514}}{{sfn|Elliott|2012|p=144}} Problems that result directly from impaired neural transmission are called ''primary sexual dysfunction''.&lt;ref name="Lombardi15" /&gt; The function of the genitals is almost always affected by SCI, by alteration, reduction, or complete loss of sensation.{{sfn|Miller|Marini|2012|p=138}} [[Neuropathic pain]], in which damaged nerve pathways signal pain in the absence of any noxious stimulus, is common after SCI{{sfn|Kennedy|2007|p=96}} and interferes with sex.&lt;ref name="Alexander2011c" /&gt;{{sfn|Wegener|Adams|Rohe|2012|p=303}}

Secondary dysfunction results from factors that follow from the injury, such as loss of [[urinary incontinence|bladder]] and [[fecal incontinence|bowel control]] or impaired movement.&lt;ref name="Lombardi15" /&gt; The main barrier to sexual activity that people with SCI cite is physical limitation; e.g. balance problems and muscle weakness cause difficulty with positioning.&lt;ref name="Ricciardi07" /&gt; [[Spasticity]], tightening of muscles due to increased [[muscle tone]], is another complication that interferes with sex.{{sfn|The Mayo Clinic|2011|p=159}} Some medications have side effects that impede sexual pleasure or interfere with sexual function: [[antidepressant]]s, [[muscle relaxant]]s, [[Hypnotic|sleeping pills]] and drugs that treat spasticity.{{sfn|Courtois|Charvier|2015|pp=225, 236}} Hormonal changes  that alter sexual function may take place after SCI; levels of [[prolactin]] heighten, women temporarily stop menstruating ([[Amenorrhoea|amenorrhea]]), and men experience reduced levels of [[testosterone]].&lt;ref name="Hesse12" /&gt; Testosterone deficiency causes reduced [[libido]], increased weakness, fatigue, and failure to respond to erection-enhancing drugs.{{sfn|Sabharwal|2013|p=310}}{{sfn|Kohut ''et al''.|2015|p=1519}}

Tertiary sexual dysfunction results from psychological and social factors.&lt;ref name="Lombardi15" /&gt; Reduced libido, desire, or experience of arousal could be due to psychological or situational factors such as depression, anxiety, and changes in relationships.&lt;ref name="Consortium10" /&gt; Both sexes experience reduced sexual desire after SCI,&lt;ref name="ProgressPromise" /&gt; and almost half of men and almost three quarters of women have trouble becoming psychologically aroused.{{sfn|Elliott|2009|p=514}}{{sfn|Elliott|2012|p=143}} [[Major depressive disorder|Depression]] is the most common cause of problems with arousal in people with SCI.{{sfn|Florante|Leyson|2013|p=365}} People frequently experience [[grief]] and despair initially after the injury.&lt;ref name="Nicotra05" /&gt; [[Anxiety]] and [[Substance abuse|drug]] and [[alcohol abuse]] may increase after discharge from a hospital as new challenges occur, which can exacerbate sexual difficulties.{{sfn|Courtois|Charvier|2015|p=237}} Drug and alcohol abuse increase unhealthy behaviors, straining relationships and social functioning.{{sfn|Sabharwal|2013|pp=396–97}}
&lt;!--INSECURITIES--&gt;
SCI can lead to significant insecurities, which have repercussions for sexuality and self-image. SCI often affects body image, either due to the host of changes in the body that affect appearance (e.g. unused muscles in the legs become atrophied), or due to changes in self-perception not directly from physical changes.{{sfn|Miller|Marini|2012|pp=146–47}} People frequently find themselves less attractive and expect others not to be attracted to them after SCI.&lt;ref name="Cramp15" /&gt; These insecurities cause fear of rejection and deter people from initiating contact or sexual activity&lt;ref name="Cramp15" /&gt; or engaging in sex.{{sfn|Miller|Marini|2012|pp=146–47}} Feelings of undesirability or worthlessness even lead some to suggest to their partners that they find someone able bodied.{{sfn|Neumann|2013|p=344}}

== Fertility ==
=== Male ===
Men with SCI rank the ability to father children among their highest concerns relating to sexuality.&lt;ref name="Abramson08" /&gt; [[Fertility#Male fertility|Male fertility]] is reduced after SCI, due to a combination of problems with erections, ejaculation, and quality of the [[semen]].&lt;ref name="Dimitriadis10" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ibrahim15" /&gt; As with other types of sexual response, ejaculation can be psychogenic or reflexogenic, and the level of injury affects a man's ability to experience each type.{{sfn|Courtois|Charvier|2015|p=228}} As many as 95% of men with SCI have problems with ejaculation ([[anejaculation]]),&lt;ref name="Hesse12" /&gt; possibly due to impaired coordination of input from different parts of the nervous system.&lt;ref name="Ricciardi07" /&gt; Erection, orgasm, and ejaculation can each occur independently,&lt;ref name="Alexander08" /&gt; although the ability to ejaculate seems linked to the quality of the erection,{{sfn|Elliott|2009|p=518}} and the ability to orgasm is linked to the ejaculation facility.{{sfn|Elliott|2012|p=146}} Even men with complete injuries may be able to ejaculate, because other nerves involved in ejaculation can effect the response without input from the spinal cord.&lt;ref name=Chehensse2013 /&gt; In general, the higher the level of injury, the more physical stimulation the man needs to ejaculate.{{sfn|Elliott|2009|p=518}} Conversely, [[Premature ejaculation|premature]] or spontaneous ejaculation can be a problem for men with injuries at levels T12–L1.{{sfn|Elliott|2009|p=518}} It can be severe enough that ejaculation is provoked by thinking a sexual thought, or for no reason at all, and is not accompanied by orgasm.{{sfn|Courtois|Charvier|2015|p=231}}

&lt;!--ABNORMAL SPERM--&gt;
Most men have a normal [[semen analysis|sperm count]], but a high proportion of [[sperm]] are abnormal; they are less [[sperm motility|motile]] and do not survive as well.&lt;ref name="ProgressPromise" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ibrahim15" /&gt; The reason for these abnormalities is not known, but research points to dysfunction of the [[seminal vesicle]]s and [[prostate]], which concentrate substances that are toxic to sperm.{{sfn|Elliott|2012|p=148}}&lt;ref name="Brackett13" /&gt; [[Cytokine]]s, [[immune system|immune]] proteins which promote an [[inflammation|inflammatory]] response, are present at higher concentrations in semen of men with SCI,&lt;ref name="Brackett13" /&gt;{{sfn|Elliott|2010a|p=420}} as is [[PAF acetylhydrolase|platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase]]; both are harmful to sperm.&lt;ref name="Brackett13" /&gt;{{sfn|Elliott|2010a|p=420}} Another immune-related response to SCI is the presence of a higher number of [[white blood cell]]s in the semen.&lt;ref name="ibrahim15" /&gt;

=== Female ===
The numbers of women with SCI giving birth and having healthy babies are increasing.&lt;ref name="Krassioukov11" /&gt; Around a half to two-thirds of women with SCI report they might want to have children,{{sfn|Daroff|Fenichel|Jankovic|Mazziotta|2012|p=980}} and 14–20% do get pregnant at least once.{{sfn|Elliott|2012|p=148}} Although female fertility is not usually permanently reduced by SCI, there is a stress response that can happen immediately post-injury that alters levels of fertility-related hormones in the body.{{sfn|Daroff|Fenichel|Jankovic|Mazziotta|2012|p=981}} In about half of women, [[menstruation]] stops after the injury but then returns within an average of five months—it returns within a year for a large majority.{{sfn|Neumann|2013|p=186}} After menstruation returns, women with SCI become pregnant at a rate close to that of the rest of the population.&lt;ref name="Dimitriadis10" /&gt;

&lt;!--PREGNANCY CONSIDERATIONS--&gt;
Pregnancy is associated with greater-than-normal risks in women with SCI,{{sfn|Harvey|2008|p=20}} among them increased risk of [[deep vein thrombosis]],{{sfn|Bickenbach ''et al''.|2013|p=75}} [[Respiratory tract infection|respiratory infection]], and [[urinary tract infection]].{{sfn|McKay-Moffat|2007|p=176}} Considerations exist such as maintaining proper positioning in a wheelchair,&lt;ref name="Consortium10" /&gt; prevention of pressure sores, and increased difficulty moving due to weight gain and changes in center of balance.{{sfn|Elliott|2012|p=149}} [[Assistive technology|Assistive devices]] may need to be altered and medications changed.&lt;ref name="bertschy15" /&gt;
&lt;!--LABOR &amp; DELIVERY--&gt;
For women with injuries above [[Sixth thoracic vertebra|T6]], a risk during labor and delivery that threatens both mother and fetus is [[autonomic dysreflexia]], in which the blood pressure increases to dangerous levels high enough to cause potentially deadly [[stroke]].{{sfn|Elliott|2012|p=149}} Drugs such as [[nifedipine]] and [[captopril]] can be used to manage an episode if it occurs, and [[Epidural administration|epidural]] anesthesia helps although it is not very reliable in women with SCI.&lt;ref name="El-Refai" /&gt;  [[Anesthesia]] is used for labor and delivery even for women without sensation, who may only experience contractions as abdominal discomfort, increased spasticity, and episodes of autonomic dysreflexia.&lt;ref name="Krassioukov11" /&gt; Reduced sensation in the pelvic area means women with SCI usually have less painful delivery; in fact, they may fail to realize when they go into labor.{{sfn|Kohut ''et al''.|2015|p=1520–21}} If there are deformities in the pelvis or spine [[caesarian section]] may be necessary.&lt;ref name="Kim10" /&gt; Babies of women with SCI are more likely to be born [[Preterm birth|prematurely]], and, premature or not, they are more likely to be small for their gestational time.&lt;ref name="Kim10" /&gt;

== Management ==
=== Erectile problems ===
[[File:Cockring.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A clear, soft plastic ring with knobs|A ring can be placed at the base of the penis to maintain erection.]]
Although erections are not necessary for satisfying sexual encounters, many men see them as important, and treating [[erectile dysfunction]] improves their relationships and quality of life.{{sfn|Elliott|2009|p=521}} Whatever treatment is used, it works best in combination with talk-oriented therapy to help integrate it into the sex life.&lt;ref name="Brackett13" /&gt;
&lt;!--ORAL MEDS--&gt;
Oral medications and mechanical devices are the first choice in treatment because they are less invasive,{{sfn|Elliott|2010a|p=416}} are often effective, and are well tolerated.&lt;ref name="DeForge04" /&gt; Oral medications include [[sildenafil]] (Viagra), [[tadalafil]] (Cialis), and [[vardenafil]] (Levitra).{{sfn|Miller|Marini|2012|p=140}}&lt;ref name="Brackett13" /&gt;
&lt;!--PUMP &amp; ring --&gt;
[[Penis pump]]s induce erections without the need for drugs or invasive treatments. To use a pump, the man inserts his penis into a cylinder, then pumps it to create a vacuum which draws blood into the penis, making it erect.{{sfn|Courtois|Charvier|2015|p=230}}&lt;ref name="Brackett13" /&gt; He then slides a [[cock ring|ring]] from the outside of the cylinder onto the base of the penis to hold the blood in and maintain the erection.{{sfn|Courtois|Charvier|2015|p=230}}{{sfn|Sabharwal|2013|p=310}} A man who is able to get an erection but has trouble maintaining it for long enough can use a ring by itself.{{sfn|Courtois|Charvier|2015|p=231}}{{sfn|Elliott|2012|p=150}} The ring cannot be left on for more than 30 minutes and cannot be used at the same time as [[anticoagulant]] medications.{{sfn|Sabharwal|2013|p=310}}

&lt;!--INJECTIONS--&gt;
If oral medications and mechanical treatments fail, the second choice is local injections:{{sfn|Elliott|2010a|p=416}} medications such as [[papaverine]] and [[prostaglandin]] that alter the blood flow and trigger erection are injected into the penis.{{sfn|The Mayo Clinic|2011|p=145}} This method is preferred for its effectiveness, but can cause pain and scarring.{{sfn|Elliott|2010a|p=418}}
&lt;!--PELLET &amp; TOPICAL &amp; ELECTRICAL--&gt;
Another option is to insert a small pellet of medication into the [[urethra]], but this requires higher doses than injections and may not be as effective.{{sfn|Elliott|2010a|p=418}} Topical medications to dilate the blood vessels have been used, but are not very effective or well tolerated.&lt;ref name="DeForge04" /&gt; Electrical stimulation of [[Efferent nerve fiber|efferent nerves]] at the S2 level can be used to trigger an erection that lasts as long as the stimulation does.{{sfn|Creasey|Craggs|2012|p=250}}
&lt;!--SURGERY--&gt;
Surgical implants, either of flexible rods or inflatable tubes, are reserved for when other methods fail because of the potential for serious complications, which occur in as many as 10% of cases.&lt;ref name="DeForge04" /&gt; They carry the risk of eroding penile tissue (breaking through the skin).{{sfn|Alpert|Wisnia|2009|p=131}} Although satisfaction among men who use them is high, if they do need to be removed implants make other methods such as injections and vacuum devices unusable due to tissue damage.&lt;ref name="DeForge04" /&gt;
&lt;!--OTHER--&gt;
It is also possible for erectile dysfunction to exist not as a direct result of SCI but due to factors such as major depression, [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]], or drugs such as those taken for spasticity.{{sfn|Elliott|2010a|p=413}} Finding and treating the root cause may alleviate the problem. For example, men who experience erectile problems as the result of a testosterone deficiency can receive [[androgen replacement therapy]].&lt;ref name="Consortium10" /&gt;

=== Ejaculation and male fertility ===
&lt;!--MALE FERTILITY RATE--&gt;
Without medical intervention, the male fertility rate after SCI is 5–14%, but the rate increases with treatments.{{sfn|Ditunno|Cardenas|Formal|Dalal|2012|p=190}} Even with all available medical interventions, fewer than half of men with SCI can father children.{{sfn|Kohut ''et al''.|2015|p=1520}} Assisted [[insemination]] is usually required.{{sfn|Elliott|2010a|p=410}} As with erection, therapies used to treat infertility in uninjured men are used for those with SCI.&lt;ref name="Brackett13" /&gt;
&lt;!--PVS--&gt;
For anejaculation in SCI, the first-line method for [[Semen collection|sperm retrieval]] is penile vibratory stimulation (PVS).&lt;ref name=Chehensse2013 /&gt;{{sfn|Miller|Marini|2012|p=140}}{{sfn|Elliott|2012|p=147}}&lt;ref name="Soler11" /&gt; A high-speed vibrator is applied to the glans penis to trigger a reflex that causes ejaculation, usually within a few minutes.{{sfn|Elliott|2012|p=147}} Reports of efficacy with PVS range from 15–88%, possibly due to differences in vibrator settings and experience of clinicians, as well as level and completeness of injury.{{sfn|Elliott|2012|p=147}} Complete lesions strictly above [[Onuf's nucleus]] (S2–S4) are responsive to PVS in 98%, but complete lesions of the S2–S4 segments are not.&lt;ref name=Chehensse2013 /&gt;
&lt;!--OTHER--&gt;
In case of failure with PVS, spermatozoa are sometimes collected by [[electroejaculation]]:&lt;ref name=Chehensse2013 /&gt;{{sfn|Elliott|2012|p=147}}&lt;ref name="Soler11" /&gt; an electrical probe is inserted into the rectum, where it triggers ejaculation.{{sfn|Miller|Marini|2012|p=140}} The success rate is 80–100%, but the technique requires anaesthesia and does not have the potential to be done at home that PVS has.&lt;ref name="Dimitriadis10" /&gt; Both PVS and electroejaculation carry a risk of autonomic dysreflexia, so drugs to prevent the condition can be given in advance and blood pressure is monitored throughout the procedures for those who are susceptible.{{sfn|Wein et al.|2011|p=643}} Massage of the prostate gland and seminal vesicles is another method to retrieve stored sperm.&lt;ref name="Brackett13" /&gt;{{sfn|Elliott|2012|p=147}} If these methods fail to cause ejaculation or do not yield sufficient usable sperm, sperm can be surgically removed by [[testicular sperm extraction]]&lt;ref name="Dimitriadis10" /&gt; or [[percutaneous epididymal sperm aspiration]].&lt;ref name=Chehensse2013 /&gt; These procedures yield sperm in 86–100% of cases, but nonsurgical treatments are preferred.&lt;ref name="Dimitriadis10" /&gt;
&lt;!--PREMATURE EJACULATION--&gt;
Premature or spontaneous ejaculation is treated with antidepressants including [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]]s, which are known to delay ejaculation as a [[side effect]].{{sfn|Courtois|Charvier|2015|p=231}}

=== Women ===
Compared with the options available for treating sexual dysfunction in men (for whom results are concretely observable), those available for women are limited.{{sfn|Courtois|Charvier|2015|pp=234–35}} For example, [[PDE5 inhibitor]]s, oral medications for treating erectile dysfunction in men, have been tested for their ability to increase sexual responses such as arousal and orgasm in women—but no controlled trials have been done in women with SCI, and trials in other women yielded only inconclusive results.{{sfn|Kohut ''et al''.|2015|p=1516}} In theory, women's sexual response could be improved using a vacuum device made to draw blood into the clitoris, but few studies on treatments for sexual function in women with SCI have been carried out.{{sfn|Elliott|2012|p=150}} There is a particular paucity of information outside the area of reproduction.&lt;ref name="Cramp15" /&gt;

=== Education and counseling ===
Counseling about sex and sexuality by medical professionals, [[psychologist]]s, [[social work]]ers, and nurses is a part of most [[Rehabilitation in spinal cord injury|SCI rehabilitation]] programs.{{sfn|Harvey|2008|p=20}} Education is part of the follow-up treatment for people with SCI,&lt;ref name="Perrouin-Verbe13" /&gt; as are [[psychotherapy]], peer [[mentorship]], and social activities; these are helpful for improving skills needed for socializing and relationships.&lt;ref name="Hesse12" /&gt; Rather than addressing sexual dysfunction strictly as a physical problem, appropriate sexual rehabilitation care takes into account the individual as a whole, for example addressing issues with relationships and self-esteem.{{sfn|Sabharwal|2013|p=308}} Sexual counseling includes teaching techniques to manage depression and stress, and to increase attention to preserved sensations during sexual activity.{{sfn|Florante|Leyson|2013|p=365}} Education includes information about birth control or assistive devices such as those for positioning in sex, or advice and ideas for addressing problems such as incontinence and autonomic dysreflexia.{{sfn|Bickenbach ''et al''.|2013}}

&lt;!--SEXUALITY IS NEGLECTED--&gt;
Many SCI patients have received misinformation about the effects of their injury on their sexual function and benefit from education about it.&lt;ref name="Alexander08" /&gt; Although sexual education shortly after injury is known to be helpful and desired, it is frequently missing in rehabilitation settings;&lt;ref name="Hesse12" /&gt; a common complaint from those who go through rehabilitation programs is that they offer insufficient information about sexuality.{{sfn|Courtois|Charvier|2015|p=237}} Longer-term education and counseling on sex after discharge from a hospital setting are especially important,{{sfn|Harvey|2008|p=21}} yet sexuality is one of the most often neglected areas in long-term SCI rehabilitation, particularly for women.&lt;ref name="Abramson08" /&gt; Care providers may refrain from addressing the topic because they feel intimidated or unequipped to handle it.{{sfn|Elliott|2012|p=143}} Clinicians must be circumspect in bringing up sexual matters since people may be uncomfortable with or unready for the subject.&lt;ref name="Consortium10" /&gt; Many patients wait for providers to broach the topic even if they do want the information.{{sfn|Courtois|Charvier|2015|p=237}}

&lt;!--CULTURAL BACKGROUND--&gt;
A person's experience in managing sexuality after the injury relies not only on physical factors like severity and level of the injury, but on aspects of life circumstances and personality such as sexual experience and attitudes about sex.&lt;ref name="Hesse12" /&gt; As well as evaluating physical concerns, clinicians must take into account factors that affect each patient's situation: gender, age, cultural, and social factors.{{sfn|Bickenbach ''et al''.|2013|p=75}} Aspects of patients' cultural and religious backgrounds, even if unnoticed before the injury caused sexual dysfunction, affect care and treatments—particularly when cultural attitudes and assumptions of patients and care providers conflict.{{sfn|Francoeur|2013|pp=11–12}} Health professionals must be sensitive to issues of [[sexual orientation]] and [[gender identity]], showing respect and acceptance while communicating, listening, and emotionally supporting.&lt;ref name="Consortium10" /&gt; Providers who treat SCI have been found to assume their patients are [[heterosexuality|heterosexual]] or to exclude [[LGBTQ]] patients from their awareness, potentially resulting in substandard care.&lt;ref name="Burch08" /&gt; Academic research on sexuality and disability under-represents LGBTQ perspectives as well.&lt;ref name="Fritz15" /&gt;

&lt;!--PARTNERS--&gt;
As well as the patient, the partner of an injured person frequently needs support and counseling.{{sfn|Neumann|2013|p=356}} It can help with adjustment to a new relationship dynamic and self-image (such as being placed in the role of caretaker) or with stresses that arise in the sexual relationship.{{sfn|Neumann|2013|p=356}} Frequently, partners of injured people must contend with feelings like guilt, anger, anxiety, and exhaustion while dealing with the added financial burden of lost wages and medical expenses.{{sfn|Sabharwal|2013|p=406}} Counseling aims to strengthen the relationship by improving communication and trust.&lt;ref name="LombardiDel10" /&gt;

==== Children and adolescents ====
Not only does SCI present children and adolescents with many of the same difficulties adults face, it affects the development of their sexuality.&lt;ref name="Flett92" /&gt; Although substantial research exists on SCI and sexuality in adults, very little exists on the ways in which it affects development of sexuality in young people.&lt;ref name="Alexander07" /&gt; Injured children and adolescents need ongoing, age-appropriate [[sex education]] that addresses questions of SCI as it relates to sexuality and sexual function.{{sfn|Vogel|Betz|Mulcahey|2012|p=140}} Very young children become aware of their disabilities before their sexuality, but as they age they become curious just as able-bodied children do, and it is appropriate to provide them with increasing amounts of information.&lt;ref name="Alexander07" /&gt; Caregivers help the child and family prepare for transition into adulthood, including in sexuality and social interaction, beginning early and intensifying during adolescence.{{sfn|Vogel|Betz|Mulcahey|2012|p=131}} Parents need education about the effects of SCI on sexual function so that they can answer their children's questions.&lt;ref name="Alexander07" /&gt;
&lt;!--TEENAGERS--&gt;
Once patients reach their teens, they need more specific information about pregnancy, birth control, self-esteem, and dating.&lt;ref name="Kim10" /&gt; Teenagers with lost or reduced genital sensation benefit from education about alternative ways to experience pleasure and satisfaction from sexual acts.&lt;ref name="Murphy06" /&gt; The teen years are often particularly difficult for those with SCI, in terms of body image and relationships.{{sfn|Sabharwal|2013|pp=91–92}} Given the importance they place on sexuality and privacy, adolescents may experience humiliation when parents or caregivers bathe them or take care of bowel and bladder needs.{{sfn|Vogel|Betz|Mulcahey|2012|p=141}} They can benefit from sexuality counseling, support groups,{{sfn|Sabharwal|2013|pp=91–92}} and mentoring by adults with SCI who can share experiences and lead discussions with peers.&lt;ref name="Kim10" /&gt; With the right care and education from family and professionals, injured children and adolescents can develop into sexually healthy adults.&lt;ref name="Ricciardi07" /&gt;

=== Changes in sexual practices ===
People make a variety of sexual adaptations to help adjust to SCI. They often change their sexual practices, moving away from genital stimulation and intercourse&lt;ref name="Cramp15" /&gt; and toward greater emphasis on touching above the level of injury and other aspects of intimacy such as kissing and caressing.&lt;ref name="Perrouin-Verbe13" /&gt; It is necessary to discover new sexual positions if ones used previously have become too difficult.&lt;ref name="Ricciardi07" /&gt; Other factors that enhance sexual pleasure are positive memories, [[sexual fantasy|fantasies]], relaxation, meditation, breathing techniques, and most importantly, trust with a partner.{{sfn|Elliott|2012|p=150}} People with SCI can make use of visual, auditory, olfactory, and tactile stimuli.{{sfn|Bedbrook|2013|p=153}} It is possible to train oneself to be more mindful of the cerebral aspects of sex and of feeling in areas of the body that have sensation; this increases chances of orgasm.{{sfn|Elliott|2012|p=150}} The importance of desire and comfort is the reasoning behind the quip "the most important sexual organ is the brain."{{sfn|Fink|Pfaff|Levine|2011|p=559}}

Adjusting to post-injury changes in the body's sensation is difficult enough to cause some to give up on the idea of satisfying sex at first.{{sfn|Alpert|Wisnia|2009|p=124}} But changes in sensitivity above and at the level of injury occur over time; people may find [[erogenous zone]]s like the nipples or ears have become more sensitive, enough to be sexually satisfying.&lt;ref name="Hesse12" /&gt; They may discover new erogenous zones that were not erotic before the injury; care providers can help direct this discovery.{{sfn|Kohut ''et al''.|2015|p=1507}} These erogenous areas can even lead to orgasm when stimulated.&lt;ref name="Consortium10" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lombardi15" /&gt; Such changes may result from "remapping" of sensory areas in the brain due to [[neuroplasticity]], particularly when sensation in the genitals is completely lost.{{sfn|Elliott|2009|p=518}}
&lt;!--TRANSITION ZONE--&gt;
Commonly there is an area on the body between the areas where sensation is lost and those where is preserved called a "transition zone" that has increased sensitivity and is often sexually pleasurable when stimulated.&lt;ref name="Consortium10" /&gt; Also known as a "border zone", this area may feel the  way the penis or clitoris did before injury, and can even give orgasmic sensation.{{sfn|Alpert|Wisnia|2009|p=138}} Due to such changes in sensation, people are encouraged to explore their bodies to discover what areas are pleasurable.{{sfn|The Mayo Clinic|2011|p=155}} [[Masturbation]] is a useful way to learn about the body's new responses.{{sfn|Alpert|Wisnia|2009|p=137}}

&lt;!--GENITAL STIMULATION--&gt;
Tests exist to measure how much sensation a person has retained in the genitals after an injury, which are used to tailor treatment or rehabilitation.&lt;ref name="Perrouin-Verbe13" /&gt; Sensory testing helps people learn to recognize the sensations associated with arousal and orgasm.{{sfn|Courtois|Charvier|2015|p=235}} Injured people who are able to achieve orgasms from stimulation to the genitals may need stimulation for a longer time or at a greater intensity.&lt;ref name="Alexander08" /&gt; [[Sex toy]]s such as [[vibrator (sex toy)|vibrators]] are available, e.g. to enhance sensation in areas of reduced sensitivity, and these can be modified to accommodate disabilities.&lt;ref name="Consortium10" /&gt; For example, a hand strap can be added to a vibrator or [[dildo]] to assist someone with poor hand function.{{sfn|Courtois|Charvier|2015|p=236}}

=== Considerations for sexual activity ===
SCI presents extra needs to consider for sexual activity; for example muscle weakness and movement limitations restrict options for positioning.{{sfn|Alpert|Wisnia|2009|p=123}} Pillows or devices such as wedges can be placed to help achieve and maintain a desired position for people affected by weakness  or movement limitations.{{sfn|Courtois|Charvier|2015|p=236}} Assistive devices exist to aid in motion, such as sliding chairs to provide pelvic thrust.&lt;ref name="Hesse12" /&gt; Spasticity and pain also create barriers to sexual activity;{{sfn|The Mayo Clinic|2011|p=155}} these changes may require couples to use new positions, such as seated in a wheelchair.{{sfn|Alpert|Wisnia|2009|p=138}} A warm bath can be taken prior to sex,{{sfn|Monga|2007|p=473}} and massage and stretching can be incorporated into foreplay to ease spasticity.{{sfn|Courtois|Charvier|2015|p=236}}

&lt;!--SKIN PROBLEMS--&gt;
Another consideration is loss of sensation, which puts people at risk for wounds such as [[Pressure ulcer|pressure sores]] and injuries that could become worse before being noticed.&lt;ref name="Consortium10" /&gt;{{sfn|Sabharwal|2013|p=309}} Friction from sexual activity may damage the skin, so it is necessary after sex to inspect areas that could have been hurt, particularly the buttocks and genital area.&lt;ref name="Consortium10" /&gt;{{sfn|Sabharwal|2013|p=309}} People who already have pressure sores must take care not to make the wounds worse.&lt;ref name="Consortium10" /&gt; Irritation to the genitals increases risk for vaginal infections, which get worse if they go unnoticed.{{sfn|Courtois|Charvier|2015|p=225}} Women who do not get sufficient vaginal lubrication on their own can use a commercially available [[personal lubricant]] to decrease friction.{{sfn|Courtois|Charvier|2015|p=236}}

&lt;!--AUTONOMIC DYSREFLEXIA--&gt;
Another risk is autonomic dysreflexia (AD), a medical emergency involving dangerously high blood pressure.{{sfn|Alpert|Wisnia|2009|p=144}} People at risk for AD can take medications to help prevent it before sex, but if it does occur they must stop and seek treatment.{{sfn|Sabharwal|2013|p=309}} Mild signs of AD such as slightly high blood pressure frequently do accompany sexual arousal and are not cause for alarm.{{sfn|Courtois|Charvier|2015|p=236}} In fact, some interpret the symptoms of AD that occur during sexual activity as pleasant or arousing,&lt;ref name="Anderson07" /&gt; or even climactic.{{sfn|Courtois|Charvier|2015|p=236}}

&lt;!--INCONTINENCE--&gt;
A concern for sexual activity that is not dangerous but that can be upsetting for both partners is bladder or bowel leakage due to [[urinary incontinence|urinary]] or [[fecal incontinence]].{{sfn|Naftchi|2012|pp=260–61}} Couples can prepare for sex by draining the bladder using [[Intermittent catheterisation|intermittent catheterization]]&lt;ref name="Cramp15" /&gt; or placing towels down in advance.{{sfn|Naftchi|2012|p=261}} People with indwelling [[urinary catheterization|urinary catheters]] must take special care with them, removing them or taping them out of the way.&lt;ref name="Ricciardi07" /&gt;{{sfn|Naftchi|2012|p=259}}

&lt;!--BIRTH CONTROL--&gt;
[[Birth control]] is another consideration: women with SCI are usually not prescribed [[Oral contraceptive pill|oral contraceptives]] since the hormones in them increase the risk of blood clots,{{sfn|Miller|Marini|2012|p=138}}{{sfn|Ohl|Bennett|2013|p=}} for which people with SCI are already at elevated risk. [[Intrauterine device]]s could have dangerous complications that could go undetected if sensation is reduced.{{sfn|Miller|Marini|2012|p=138}}{{sfn|Elliott|2012|p=149}} [[Diaphragm (birth control)|Diaphragms]] that require something to be inserted into the vagina are not usable by people with poor hand function.{{sfn|Sabharwal|2013|p=311}} An option of choice for women is for partners to use [[condom]]s.{{sfn|Sabharwal|2013|p=311}}{{sfn|Ohl|Bennett|2013|p=}}

== Long-term adjustment ==
In the first months after an injury, people commonly prioritize other aspects of rehabilitation over sexual matters, but in the long term, adjustment to life with SCI necessitates addressing sexuality.&lt;ref name="Consortium10" /&gt;
&lt;!--FREQUENCY OF SEX--&gt;
Although physical, psychological and emotional factors militate to reduce the frequency of sex after injury, it increases after time.&lt;ref name="Hesse12" /&gt; As years go by, the odds that a person will become involved in a sexual relationship increase.&lt;ref name="Anderson07" /&gt; Difficulties adjusting to a changed appearance and physical limitations contribute to reduced frequency of sexual acts, and improved body image is associated with an increase.&lt;ref name="Cramp15" /&gt; Like frequency, sexual desire and sexual satisfaction often decrease after SCI.&lt;ref name="Alexander07" /&gt; The reduction in women's sexual desire and frequency may be in part because they believe they can no longer enjoy sex, or because their independence or social opportunities are reduced.&lt;ref name="Cramp15" /&gt; As time goes by people usually adjust sexually, adapting to their changed bodies.&lt;ref name="Ricciardi07" /&gt; Some 80% of women return to being sexually active,{{sfn|Wegener|Adams|Rohe|2012|p=303}}
&lt;!--SATISFACTION--&gt;
and the numbers who report being sexually satisfied range from 40–88%.{{sfn|Elliott|2010b|p=429}} Although women's satisfaction is usually lower than before the injury,&lt;ref name="Cramp15" /&gt; it improves as time passes.&lt;ref name="LombardiDel10" /&gt; Women report higher rates of sexual satisfaction than men post-SCI for as many as 10–45 years.{{sfn|Courtois|Charvier|2015|p=237}} More than a quarter of men have substantial problems with adjustment to their post-injury sexual functioning.&lt;ref name="BurnsMahalik2008" /&gt; Sexual satisfaction depends on a host of factors, some more important than the physical function of the genitals: intimacy, quality of relationships, satisfaction of partners,&lt;ref name="Hesse12" /&gt; willingness to be sexually experimental, and good communication.&lt;ref name="Ricciardi07" /&gt; Genital function is not as important to men's sexual satisfaction as are their partners' satisfaction and intimacy in their relationships.{{sfn|Harvey|2008|p=20}} For women, quality of relationships, closeness with partners, sexual desire, and positive body image, as well as the physical function of the genitals, contribute sexual satisfaction.{{sfn|Courtois|Charvier|2015|p=232}} For both sexes, long-term relationships are associated with higher sexual satisfaction.&lt;ref name="Hesse12" /&gt;

== Relationships ==
A [[catastrophic injury]] such as SCI puts strain on marriages and other romantic relationships, which in turn has important implications for quality of life. Partners of injured people often feel out of control, overwhelmed, angry, and guilty while having added work related to the injury, less help with responsibilities like parenting, and loss of wages.{{sfn|Hammell|2013|p=79}} Relationship stress and excessive dependence in relationships increases risk of depression for the person with SCI; supportive relationships are protective.&lt;ref name="Kraft15" /&gt;
&lt;!--GENDER ROLES --&gt;
Relationships change as partners take on new roles, such as that of caregiver,{{sfn|Courtois|Charvier|2015|p=237}} which may conflict with the role of partner and require substantial sacrifice of time and self-care.{{sfn|Sabharwal|2013|p=406}} These changes in responsibilities may mean a reverse in societally determined [[gender role]]s within relationships; inability to fulfil these roles affects sexuality in general.{{sfn|Miller|Marini|2012|pp=146–47}}
&lt;!--SEXUAL DYSFUNCTION--&gt;
Sexual dysfunction is a stressor in relationships. People are often as concerned about failing to keep a partner satisfied as they are about meeting their own sexual needs.&lt;ref name="Hesse12" /&gt; In fact, two of the top reasons people with SCI cite for wanting to have sex are for intimacy and to keep a partner.{{sfn|Bickenbach ''et al''.|2013|p=75}} The frequency of sex correlates with the desire of the uninjured partner.{{sfn|Monga|2007|p=473}}

[[File:Ivanov&amp;Slugovina cropped.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A wheelchair-bound woman in a ball gown dancing with a man in a tuxedo|Physical activities and social gatherings are a way to meet people and prevent isolation.]]
&lt;!--MARRIAGE--&gt;
Although problems with sexual function that result from SCI play a part in some divorces, they are not as important as emotional maturity in determining the success of a marriage.{{sfn|Neumann|2013|p=337}} People with SCI get divorced more often than the rest of the population,{{sfn|Sabharwal|2013|p=406}} and marriages that took place before the injury fail more often than those that took place after (33% vs. 21%).{{sfn|Neumann|2013|p=352}} People married before the injury report less happy marriages and worse sexual adjustment than those married after, possibly indicating that spouses had difficulty adjusting to the new circumstances.{{sfn|Neumann|2013|pp=352–53}} For those who chose to become involved with someone after an injury, the [[disability]] was an accepted part of the relationship from the outset.{{sfn|Neumann|2013|p=354}} Understanding and acceptance of the limitations that result from the injury on the part of the uninjured partner is an important factor in a successful marriage.{{sfn|Neumann|2013|p=359}} Many divorces have been found to be initiated by the injured partner, sometimes due to the depression and denial that often occurs early after the injury.{{sfn|Neumann|2013|p=336}} Thus counseling is important, not just for managing changes in self-perception but in perceptions about relationships.{{sfn|Neumann|2013|p=336}}

&lt;!--PARENTING --&gt;
Despite the stresses that SCI places on people and relationships, studies have shown that people with SCI are able to have happy and fulfilling romantic relationships and marriages, and to raise well-adjusted children.{{sfn|Hammell|2013|p=295}} People with SCI who wish to be parents may question their ability to raise children and opt not to have them, but studies have shown no difference in parenting outcomes between injured and uninjured groups.{{sfn|Sabharwal|2013|pp=311, 406}} Children of women with SCI do not have worse self-esteem, adjustment, or attitudes toward their parents.&lt;ref name="Kim10" /&gt; Women who have children post-SCI have a higher quality of life, even though parenting adds demands and challenges to their lives.{{sfn|Kohut ''et al''.|2015|p=1521}}

&lt;!--STARTING RELATIONSHIPS--&gt;
For those who are single when injured or who become single, SCI causes difficulties and insecurities with respect to one's ability to meet new partners{{sfn|Elliott|2012|p=153}} and start relationships.{{sfn|Hammell|2013|p=292}} In some settings, [[Physical attractiveness|beauty standards]] cause people to view disabled bodies as less attractive, limiting the options for sexual and romantic partners of people with disabilities like SCI.{{sfn|Florante|Leyson|2013|p=366}} Furthermore, physical disabilities are stigmatized, causing people to avoid contact with disabled people, particularly those with highly visible conditions like SCI.{{sfn|Livneh|Chan|Kaya|2013|p=98}} The stigma may cause people with SCI to experience self-consciousness and embarrassment in public.{{sfn|Livneh|Chan|Kaya|2013|p=98}} They can increase their social success by using [[impression management]] techniques to change how they are perceived and create a more positive image of themselves in others' eyes.{{sfn|Livneh|Chan|Kaya|2013|p=113}} Physical limitations create difficulties; with lowered independence comes reduced social interaction and fewer opportunities to find partners.&lt;ref name="Cramp15" /&gt; Difficulties with mobility and the lack of disabled [[accessibility]] of social spaces (e.g. lack of wheelchair ramps) create a further barrier to social activity and limit the ability to meet partners. Isolation and its associated risk of depression can be limited by participating in physical activities, social gatherings, clubs, and online chat and dating.{{sfn|Courtois|Charvier|2015|p=237}}

== Society and culture ==
[[File:Push-Girls-Group-Shot cropped.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Four women in wheelchairs|The reality television series ''[[Push Girls]]'' depicts women with SCI addressing matters of sexuality and daily life.]]
&lt;!--STEREOTYPES--&gt;
Negative societal attitudes and [[stereotype]]s about people with disabilities like SCI affect interpersonal interactions and self-image, with important implications for quality of life. In fact, for women, psychological factors have a more important impact on sexual adjustment and activity than physical ones.&lt;ref name="LombardiDel10" /&gt; Negative attitudes about disability (along with relationships and social support) are more predictive of outcome than even the level or completeness of injury.{{sfn|Kennedy|Smithson|2012|p=209}} Stereotypes exist that people with SCI (particularly women) are uninterested in, unsuitable for, or incapable of sexual relationships or encounters.{{sfn|Miller|Marini|2012|pp=136–37}} "People think we can only date people in wheelchairs, that we're lucky to get any guy, that we can't be picky", remarked Mia Schaikewitz, who is profiled  in ''[[Push Girls]]'', a 2012 reality series about four women with SCI.&lt;ref name="Pfefferman12" /&gt;
&lt;!--PROFESSIONAL BIAS--&gt;
Not only do they affect injured people's self-image, these stereotypes are particularly harmful when held by counselors and professionals involved in rehabilitation.{{sfn|Miller|Marini|2012|pp=136–37}} Caregivers affected by these culturally transmitted beliefs may treat their patients as asexual, particularly if the injury occurred at a young age and the patient never had sexual experiences.{{sfn|Francoeur|2013|p=11}} Failure to recognize injured people's sexual and reproductive capacity restricts their access to birth control, information about sexuality, and [[reproductive health|sexual health]]-related medical care such as annual gynecological exams.&lt;ref name="Fritz15" /&gt; Another common belief that affects sexual rehabilitation is that sex is strictly about genital function; this could cause caregivers to discount the importance of the rest of the body and of the individual.{{sfn|Elliott|2012|p=155}}

&lt;!--GENDER ROLES--&gt;
Cultural attitudes toward gender roles have profound effects on people with SCI.{{sfn|Francoeur|2013|p=13}} The injury can cause insecurities surrounding [[sexual identity]], particularly if the disability precludes fulfilment of societally taught gender norms.{{sfn|Hammell|2013|pp=288–89}}
&lt;!--FEMALE GENDER ROLES--&gt;
Female beauty standards propagated by mass media and culture portray the ideal woman as able bodied: as one fashion model with a SCI commented, "when you have a devastating injury or disability, you're not often thought of as sensual or pretty because you don't look like the women in the magazines."&lt;ref name=Taylor14 /&gt; Inability to meet these standards can lower self-esteem, even if these ideals are also unattainable for most able-bodied women.{{sfn|Panzarino|2013|p=383}} Poorer self-esteem is associated with worse sexual adjustment and quality of life, and higher rates of loneliness, stress, and depression.&lt;ref name="PeterMüller2011" /&gt;
&lt;!--MALE GENDER ROLES--&gt;
Males are also affected by societal expectations, such as notions about masculinity and sexual prowess.&lt;ref name="BurnsMahalik2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BurnsHough2009" /&gt; Men from some traditional backgrounds may feel performance pressure that emphasizes the ability to have erections and sexual intercourse.{{sfn|Francoeur|2013|p=13}} Men who have strong sexual desire but who are not able to perform sexually may be at increased risk for [[major depressive disorder|depression]], particularly when they believe strongly in traditional masculine gender norms with sexual function as core to the male identity.&lt;ref name="BurnsMahalik2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BurnsHough2009" /&gt; Men who strongly believe in these traditional roles may feel sexually inadequate, unmanly, insecure, and less satisfied with life.&lt;ref name="BurnsMahalik2008" /&gt; Since sexual dysfunction has this negative impact on self-esteem, treatment of erectile dysfunction can have a psychological benefit even though it does not help with physical sensation.{{sfn|Francoeur|2013|p=13}} SCI may necessitate reappraisal and rejection of assumptions about gender norms and sexual function in order to adjust healthily to the disability: those who are able to change the way they think about gender roles may have better life satisfaction and outcomes with rehabilitation.&lt;ref name="BurnsMahalik2008" /&gt; Counseling is helpful in this reassessment process.&lt;ref name="BurnsMahalik2008" /&gt;

'''St. Matthew's University''' ('''SMU''') is a [[For-profit school|for-profit]] university located in [[Grand Cayman]], [[Cayman Islands]] in the [[Caribbean]]. SMU has a School of Medicine and a School of Veterinary Medicine, which confer [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] and [[D.V.M.]] degrees, respectively. St. Matthew's University is owned by R3 Education, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=61042119 |title=R3 Education Inc.: Private Company Information - Businessweek |publisher=Investing.businessweek.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:St Matthews University 1.jpg|thumb|St. Matthews, Grand Cayman]]
[[File:St Matthews 2.jpg|thumb|St Matthews Campus]]
SMU was founded in [[Belize]] in 1997 by Dr. Michael Harris and other medical doctors. In 2001, the board of directors changed the university's administration. In 2002, the school moved to the Cayman Islands under interim president [[Dr. B.D. Owens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sanpedrosun.net/old/01-233.html |title=St. Matthew's changes administration, San Pedro Sun, Belize News |publisher=Sanpedrosun.net |date= |accessdate=2015-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dr. Michael Harris was named President in 2003 and the Medical University gained full accreditation.

The School of Veterinary Medicine was established in 2005 under the direction of Dr. Scott Harris, DVM .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stmatthews.edu/about_history.shtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080323234758/http://stmatthews.edu/about_history.shtml |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-03-23 |title=St. Matthew's University &amp;#124; About St Matthew's University &amp;#124; History of St. Matthew's University |publisher=Stmatthews.edu |date=2005-09-01 |accessdate=2010-03-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The school was acquired by [[Greenwich, Connecticut]]-based Equinox Capital in conjunction with [[Chicago]]-based Prairie Capital in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.equinox-capital.com/news.html |title=Equinox Capital, Inc. - News |publisher=Equinox-capital.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070531014248/http://www.equinox-capital.com/news.html |archivedate=2007-05-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accreditation==
===School of Medicine===
SMU is chartered by the government of the [[Cayman Islands]].&lt;ref name="Cayman" /&gt;

SMU School of Medicine is accredited by the [[Accreditation Commission of Colleges of Medicine]], an accrediting agency listed in the [[Foundation for Advancement of International Medical Education and Research|FAIMER]] Directory of Organizations that Recognize/Accredit Medical Schools (DORA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faimer.org/resources/dora/index.html |title=Directory of Organizations that Recognize/Accredit Medical Schools (DORA) |publisher=FAIMER |date=2015-02-12 |accessdate=2015-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="accredmed.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accredmed.org/ |title=Welcome to ACCM - The Accreditation Commission on Colleges of Medicine |publisher=Accredmed.org |date= |accessdate=2010-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The School of Medicine has been accredited for 14 years with accreditation extending until June 30, 2019. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.accredmed.org/accredited_schools/default.html&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2002 the United States Department of Education’s [[National Committee on Foreign Medical Education and Accreditation]] (NCFMEA) has recognized SMU’s accreditor as using standards that are comparable to the standards used to accredit medical schools in the United States. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.ed.gov/about/bdscomm/list/ncfmea.html#decisions|title=National Committee on Foreign Medical Education and Accreditation (NCFMEA) - U.S. Department of Education|website=www2.ed.gov|accessdate=21 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

St. Matthew's University School of Medicine is approved by the [[New York State Education Department]] (NYSED)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.op.nysed.gov/prof/med/medforms.htm|title=NYS Medicine:Application Forms|website=www.op.nysed.gov|accessdate=21 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; to allow students to complete more than 12 weeks of clinical clerkships in New York State. SMU is one of only seven Caribbean medical schools so approved by NYSED. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.op.nysed.gov/prof/med/medlic.htm|title=NYSED.gov Office of the Professions|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

St. Matthew's University School of Medicine is licensed by the Florida Department of Education's Commission for Independent Education (CIE) for the purpose of providing clinical rotations in Florida. SMU is one of only seven Caribbean medical schools so approved by the [[Www.fldoe.org/core/...php/.../CIE-Accredited-Instituions-DEC15.xls|Florida Department of Education's]] CIE. 

The University is listed in the [[World Directory of Medical Schools]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://search.wdoms.org/home/SchoolDetail/F0001649 St. Matthew's University WDMS]. Retrieved on November 3, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

I[https://www.stmatthews.edu/medical-school-financial-information/loans n June 2018, access to the Federal Direct Student Loan Program was granted] to students at SMU School of Medicine, who are either American citizens or permanent residents.
====Medical School curriculum====
The MD program at SMU is a 10-semester course of study that consists of 3 semesters per calendar year.  Semesters 1-5 are basic science semesters that are completed at the university’s [[Grand Cayman]] (Cayman Islands) campus.  Semesters 6-10 consist of 72 weeks of clinical training at rural hospitals in United States, Canada, or the United Kingdom.

====Licensure restrictions====
On February 8, 2005, the Division of Licensing, Medical Board of California reviewed, and determined that St. Matthew's University graduates are ineligible for licensure. This was due to attrition rates above 80%, low USMLE pass rate, and unorganized clinical rotations in remote locations.

In the [[United States]], the medical boards of the following states have banned St. Matthew's University graduates from obtaining licensure::

* [[California]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.mbc.ca.gov/Applicants/Medical_Schools/Schools_Disapproved.aspx|title=Medical Board of California - International Medical Schools Disapproved by the State of California|work=mbc.ca.gov|accessdate=2014-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Indiana]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.in.gov/pla/2799.htm|title=PLA: Approved/Disapproved Foreign Medical Schools|work=in.gov|accessdate=2014-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Kansas]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ksbha.org/departments/licensing/medicalschools.shtml|title=Medical Schools that have been disapproved by the Kansas Board of Healing Arts|author= |work=ksbha.org |accessdate=2014-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[North Dakota]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ndbomex.org/practitioners/physicians/newapp/disapprovedMedSchools.asp |title=North Dakota Board of Medical Examiners - Disapproved Medical Schools |author= |date=2014-11-22 |work=ndbomex.org |accessdate=2014-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A future approval would still bar physicians from obtaining a licensure, unless if they start basic sciences after the approval date.

In the [[United Kingdom]], the [[General Medical Council]] has listed St. Matthew's University as an institution whose graduates from the Belize campus are ineligible for licensure. Graduates from the current Cayman Islands campus are eligible for licensure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmc-uk.org/doctors/registration_applications/acceptable_primary_medical_qualification.asp |title=GMC &amp;#124; Acceptable overseas medical qualifications |publisher=Gmc-uk.org |date=2007-02-16 |accessdate=2014-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Residence Hall ===
The residence hall is an old Sleep Inn hotel. The rent for a small room is $4245-4800 USD for almost 4 months. The high speed internet provided is 3.25 Mbps. Students who plan on studying with contemporary media standards usually buy a high speed modem on their own, or use the hotspot from their smart phones. This is by far the cheapest housing available on the island.

===School of Veterinary Medicine===
St. Matthew's University School of Veterinary Medicine (SMUSVM) is listed by the [[American Veterinary Medical Association]], and its graduates qualify for entrance into the Educational Commission for Foreign Veterinary Graduates (ECFVG) or the Program for the Assessment of Veterinary Education Equivalence (PAVE) certification programs.

The PAVE program is a foreign licensing program that allows students to qualify to take the North American Veterinary Licensing Examination (NAVLE).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aavsb.org/PAVE/ |title=Foreign Veterinary Graduates &amp;#124; Veterinary License America &amp;#124; International &amp;#124; PAVE &amp;#124; Program for the Assessment of Veterinary Education Equivalence |publisher=Aavsb.org |date= |accessdate=2014-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PAVE qualifying exam is written or online and intended to test the knowledge of students in foreign veterinary schools.  It covers material learned  in the first three (pre-clinical) years of AVMA-accredited veterinary schools.&lt;ref name="aavsb"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aavsb.org/PAVE/QE/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090723100732/http://www.aavsb.org/PAVE/QE/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2009-07-23 |title=PAVE Qualifying Examination &amp;#124; QE |publisher=Aavsb.org |date= |accessdate=2014-02-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The PAVE program is recognized in 39 states currently, as well as Australia and New Zealand.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The ECFVG is a program that assesses the overall knowledge of veterinary students from non-AVMA-accredited schools to ensure they have sufficient knowledge to practice veterinary medicine within the United States.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.avma.org/professionaldevelopment/education/foreign/pages/ecfvg-about-us.aspx |title=ECFVG - About Us |publisher=Avma.org |date= |accessdate=2014-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program contains four steps and is recognized by all 50 states to allow those that receive a certificate the ability to practice within those states.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

The Dean of the School of Veterinary Medicine is Karen Rosenthal, DVM.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.avma.org/News/JAVMANews/Pages/120101s.aspx?PF=1 |title=St. Matthew's gets new dean |publisher=Avma.org |date=2012-01-01 |accessdate=2014-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Rosenthal has received awards in her work as an advocate for exotic animals and her dedication toward advancing the field of companion exotic animal medicine. Dr. Rosenthal has received the Oxbow Exotic Mammal Health Award for her work in the field of exotic companion animal medicine on October 24, 2012. 

Dr. Rosenthal has also been  an associate professor and section chief of special species medicine at the University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine, where she also served as the medical director of University of Pennsylvania's veterinary hospital; and previously, she was the founding and national director of Avian and Exotic Animal Services for Antech Diagnostics and a staff member for five years on the Avian and Exotic Service at New York City's Animal Medical Center.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;

Students at the School of Veterinary Medicine complete their pre-clinical education in 28 months (7 semesters), with three more semesters (12 months) completed in either the United States or Canada as the clinical year.&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aavmc.org/stmatthews.aspx |title=St. Matthew?s University Descriptor Page |publisher=Aavmc.org |date= |accessdate=2014-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incoming class size is limited to 35 students and the faculty to student ratio is 1:5.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;

The  requirements for applying to St. Matthew's University School of Veterinary Medicine are: 8 credits (and lab) of General Biology and General Chemistry, 4 credits (and lab) of Organic Chemistry, 3 credits of Biochemistry, 6 credits of Language Arts (English), 3 credits of College Math or Computer Science, 4 credits of Physics (Recommended), and 6 credits of Social Science (Recommended).&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; 

There is a concurrent dual degree program available for students to receive their Master of Business Administration degree from Davenport University, which is offered completely online.&lt;ref name=":20"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.davenport.edu/partnerships/medical-partner-mba |title=Medical Partner MBA &amp;#124; Davenport University |publisher=Davenport.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the dual degree program receive benefits that include qualification for Title IV federal student aid (for U.S. citizens and eligible non-citizens), receiving partnership tuition rates for the entire program, advancing the student's career with two degrees as a doctor of veterinary medicine and an MBA, and the ability to apply up to 15 transferable graduate credits.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt;

SMUSVM has clinical year programs with Purdue University,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vet.purdue.edu/vcs/clinicalyear.php |title=Clinical Year Programs |publisher=Vet.purdue.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-02-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140310014534/http://www.vet.purdue.edu/vcs/clinicalyear.php |archivedate=2014-03-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; University of Pennsylvania,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vet.upenn.edu/education/academics-and-training/clinical-year-at-penn-vet |title=Penn Vet &amp;#124; Clinical Year at Penn Vet |publisher=Vet.upenn.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; University of Minnesota,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vetmed.state.mn.us/Default.aspx?tabid=832 |title=Foreign Graduate Information |publisher=Vetmed.state.mn.us |date=2008-08-01 |accessdate=2014-02-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002195209/http://www.vetmed.state.mn.us/Default.aspx?tabid=832 |archivedate=2013-10-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; North Carolina State University,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cvm.ncsu.edu/academicaffairs/offshore.html |title=Academic Affairs :: North Carolina State University College of Veterinary Medicine |publisher=Cvm.ncsu.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oklahoma State University,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cvhs.okstate.edu/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=805&amp;Itemid=404 |title=Center for Veterinary Health Sciences &amp;#124; Healthy Animals - Healthy People |publisher=Cvhs.okstate.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and University of Illinois.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vetmed.illinois.edu/vetreport/documents/VetReportSummer10.pdf |title=News - Veterinary Medicine at Illinois |publisher=Vetmed.illinois.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13152">Also called [[Zuska's disease]] (only nonpuerperal case), '''subareolar abscess''' is a [[Subcutaneous tissue|subcutaneous]] [[abscess]] of the breast tissue beneath the [[areola]] of the nipple. It is a frequently aseptic inflammation and has been associated with [[squamous metaplasia]] of [[lactiferous duct]]s.

The term is usually understood to include breast abscesses located in the retroareolar region or the periareolar region,&lt;ref name="Sabel2009-p85"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael S. Sabel|title=Essentials of Breast Surgery|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KqKDRwWBCvIC&amp;pg=PA85|year=2009|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=0-323-03758-5|pages=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Versluijs|first1=F. N. L.|last2=Roumen|first2=R. M. H.|last3=Goris|first3=R. J. A.|title=Chronic recurrent subareolar breast abscess: incidence and treatment|journal=British Journal of Surgery|volume=87|issue=7|year=2000|pages=931–964|issn=0007-1323|doi=10.1046/j.1365-2168.2000.01544-49.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; but not those located in the periphery of the breast.

Subareolar abscess can develop both during lactation or extrapuerperal, the abscess is often flaring up and down with repeated [[fistula]]tion.

== Pathophysiology ==
90% of cases are smokers, however only a very small fraction of smokers appear to develop this lesion. It has been speculated that either the direct toxic effect or hormonal changes related to smoking could cause squamous metaplasia of lactiferous ducts. It is not well established whether the lesion regresses after [[smoking cessation]].

Extrapuerperal cases are often associated with [[hyperprolactinemia]] or with [[thyroid]] problems.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} Also [[diabetes mellitus]] may be a contributing factor in nonpuerperal [[breast abscess]].&lt;ref name="pmid20349659"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rizzo M, Gabram S, Staley C, Peng L, Frisch A, Jurado M, Umpierrez G |title=Management of breast abscesses in nonlactating women |journal=The American Surgeon |volume=76 |issue=3 |pages=292–5 |date=March 2010  |pmid=20349659 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid22395343"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Verghese BG, Ravikanth R |title=Breast abscess, an early indicator for diabetes mellitus in non-lactating women: a retrospective study from rural India |journal=World Journal of Surgery |volume=36 |issue=5 |pages=1195–8 |date=May 2012  |pmid=22395343 |doi=10.1007/s00268-012-1502-7 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Treatment ==
Treatment is problematic unless an underlying endocrine disorder can be successfully diagnosed and treated.

A study by Goepel and Panhke provided indications that the inflammation should be controlled by bromocriptine even in absence of hyperprolactinemia.&lt;ref name="Goepel"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Goepel E, Pahnke VG |title=[Successful therapy of nonpuerperal mastitis &amp;ndash; already routine or still a rarity?] |language=German |journal=Geburtshilfe Frauenheilkd |volume=51 |issue=2 |pages=109–16 |year=1991 |pmid=2040409 |doi=10.1055/s-2007-1023685}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Antibiotic treatment is given in case of acute inflammation. However, this alone is rarely effective, and the treatment of a subareaolar abscess is primarily surgical. In case of an acute abscess, incision and drainage are performed, followed by antibiotics treatment. However, in contrast to peripheral breast abscess which often resolves after antibiotics and incision and drainage, subareaolar breast abscess has a tendency to recur, often accompanied by the formation of [[fistula]]s leading from inflammation area to the skin surface. In many cases, in particular in patients with recurrent subareolar abscess, the excision of the affected lactiferous ducts is indicated, together with the excision of any chronic abscess or fistula. This can be performed using radial or circumareolar incision.&lt;ref name="Sabel2009-p85-88"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael S. Sabel|title=Essentials of Breast Surgery|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KqKDRwWBCvIC&amp;pg=PA85|year=2009|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=0-323-03758-5|pages=85–88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no universal agreement on what should be the standard way of treating the condition. In a recent review article, antibiotics treatment, ultrasound evaluation and, if fluid is present, [[Breast ultrasound|ultrasound]]-guided [[fine needle aspiration]] of the abscess with an [[Needle gauge comparison chart|18 gauge]] [[Hypodermic needle|needle]], under saline lavage until clear, has been suggested as initial line of treatment for breast abscess in puerperal and non-puerperal cases including central (subareolar) abscess&lt;ref name="trop-etal-2013"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Trop I, Dugas A, David J, El Khoury M, Boileau JF, Larouche N, Lalonde L |title=Breast abscesses: evidence-based algorithms for diagnosis, management, and follow-up |journal=Radiographics |volume=31 |issue=6 |pages=1683–99 |date=October 2011  |pmid=21997989 |doi=10.1148/rg.316115521 |type=review}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Mastitis#Breast abscess 2|breast abscess]] for details).

==Squamous metaplasia of lactiferous ducts==
[[Image:Squamous_metaplasia_of_the_lactiferous_ducts_-_very_low_mag.jpg|thumb|[[Micrograph]] of squamous metaplasia of lactiferous ducts. [[H&amp;E stain]].]]
[[Squamous metaplasia]] of [[lactiferous ducts]] - abbreviated SMOLD is a change where the normal double layer cuboid epithelium of the lactiferous ducts is replaced by [[Squamous epithelial cell|squamous]] [[keratin]]izing cell layers. The resulting epithelium is very similar to normal skin, hence some authors speak of epidermalization. SMOLD is rare in premenopausal women (possibly 0.1-3%) but more frequent (possibly up to 25%) in [[postmenopausal]] women where it does not cause any problems at all.

SMOLD appears to be a completely benign lesion and may exist without causing any symptoms. In principle it ought to be completely reversible as the classification as [[metaplasia]] would suggest. Because of difficulties in observing the actual changes and rare incidence of the lesion this does not appear to be documented.

The last section of the lactiferous ducts is always lined with squamous keratinizing epithelium which appears to have important physiological functions. For example, the keratin forms plugs sealing the duct entry and has bacteriostatic properties. In SMOLD the keratinizing lining which is supposed to form only the ends of the lactiferous ducts extends deep into the ducts.

SMOLD is distinct from squamous metaplasia that may occur in papilomatous hyperplasia. It is believed to be unrelated to squamous cell carcinoma of the breast which probably arises from different cell types.

The keratin plugs (debris) produced by SMOLD have been proposed as the cause for recurrent subareolar abscesses by causing secretory stasis. The epidermalized lining has also different [[Semipermeable membrane|permeability]] than the normal lining, hindering resorption of glandular secretions. The resorption is necessary to dispose of stalled secretions inside the duct - and at least equally important it affects osmotic balance which in turn is an important mechanism in the control of lactogenesis (this is relevant both in puerperal and nonpuerperal [[mastitis]]).

While in lactating women this would appear to be a very plausible pathogenesis, there is some uncertainty about the pathogenesis in non-lactating women where breast secretions should be apriori minimal. It appears pathologic stimulation of lactogenesis must be present as well to cause subareolar abscess and treatment success with bromocriptin appears to confirm this&lt;ref name="Goepel"/&gt; as compared to poor success rate of the usual antibiotic and surgical treatments documented by Hanavadi et al.&lt;ref name="Hanavadi"/&gt;

Further uncertainty in the relation of SMOLD and the subareolar abscess is that squamous metaplasia is very often caused by inflammatory processes. SMOLD could be the cause of the inflammation – or the result of a previous or longstanding inflammation.

SMOLD usually affects multiple ducts and frequently (relative to extremely low absolute prevalence) both breasts hence it is very likely that systemic changes such as hormonal interactions are involved.

At least the following factors have been considered in the aetiology of SMOLD: reactive change to chronic inflammation, systemic hormonal changes, smoking, dysregulation in beta-catenin expression, changes in retinoic acid and vitamin D metabolism or expression.

[[Vitamin A deficiency]] may cause epidermilization of the ducts and squamous metaplasia and likely also contributes to infection.&lt;ref name="Sabel2009-p86"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael S. Sabel|title=Essentials of Breast Surgery|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KqKDRwWBCvIC&amp;pg=PA86|year=2009|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=0-323-03758-5|pages=86}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vitamin A deficiency has been observed to cause squamous metaplasia in many types of epithelia. However supplementation with Vitamin A would be beneficial only in exceptional cases because normally the local catabolism of vitamin A will be the regulating factor.

Squamous metaplasia of breast epithelia is known to be more prevalent in postmenopausal women (where it does not cause any problems at all). [[Staurosporine]], a nonspecific protein kinase C inhibitor can induce squamous metaplasia in breast tissue while other known PKC inhibitors did not show this effect.  cAMP stimulation can also induce squamous metaplasia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Heffelfinger SC, Miller MA, Gear R, Devoe G |title=Staurosporine-induced versus spontaneous squamous metaplasia in pre- and postmenopausal breast tissue |journal=J.

'''Vion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.''' was a [[New Haven]], [[Connecticut]] based [[pharmaceutical company]] founded in March 1992 to commercialize several discoveries made in the biomedical laboratories at [[Yale University]].

==Clinical Development==
Two anticancer agents, Onrigin (laromustine), formerly cloretazine (VNP40101M), and Triapine, a ribunucloetide reductase inhibitor similar to [[hydroxyurea]], were in human [[clinical trials]]. A novel alkylating agent, Onrigin was evaluated in a Phase 2 trial in elderly ''de novo'' poor-risk [[acute myeloid leukemia]] (AML). In addition, several trials of Onrigin were conducted in elderly patients with AML and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) in combination with [[cytarabine]], and in patients with brain tumors in combination with [[temozolomide]].  After Onrigin was rejected by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] for an AML indication in 2009 due to an unfavorable risk-benefit profile, the company became defunct.

The company declared bankruptcy in December 2009.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/vion-pharmaceuticals-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy-79555952.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Water supply and sanitation in the Netherlands''' is provided in good quality and at a reasonable price to the entire population. Water consumption is one of the lowest in developed countries at 128&amp;nbsp;litres per capita per day and water leakage in the distribution network is one of the lowest in the world at only 6%.

A large array of institutions is responsible for providing water and sanitation services: 10 regional water companies provide drinking water, 431 [[Municipalities in the Netherlands|municipalities]] are in charge of sewers, and 27 [[Water board (The Netherlands)|water boards]] treat wastewater. Two Ministries share responsibility for policy-making in the sector. A large number of knowledge institutes, NGOs and two business associations – VEWIN representing the interests of the water companies and UVW representing the water boards - complete the institutional landscape of the sector.

An interesting feature of the Dutch water sector is a performance benchmarking system for water companies first introduced in 1997, which has inspired similar efforts in other European countries. The Dutch parliament passed a law in 2004 banning private sector provision of water supply. However, while the water companies themselves remain publicly owned, they contract many services - such as customer service and repairs - out to the private sector.

== Access and service quality ==
The Dutch have universal access to the water supply and sanitation at very good quality. The drinking water network is in such good shape that treated water typically does not need to be [[Water chlorination|chlorinated]] to prevent recontamination in the network, so that water reaches the consumer without a taste or smell of chlorine.

== Water resources and water use ==
60% of Dutch drinking water comes from groundwater, mainly in the eastern part of the Netherlands. The remaining 40% comes from surface water, mainly in the West where water utilities pump from the [[Rhine]] and the [[Meuse]] because groundwater is brackish.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iwahq.org/uploads/iwa%20hq/website%20files/utilities/benchmarking_amsterdam_06/IWA%20conference%20on%20benchmarking%202006_04_Theo%20Schmitz.pdf VEWIN Presentation 2006], p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;  The government encourages the use of surface water by charging a groundwater abstraction levy. Average municipal water use is among the lowest in developed countries at only 128&amp;nbsp;litre/capita/day in 2004. 96% of water users are metered and a portion of their bill - typically about one half - is based on actual consumption.&lt;ref name="Vewin"/&gt;

== Infrastructure and Human Resources ==
'''Infrastructure'''. There are 116,000&amp;nbsp;km of water pipes in the Netherlands.&lt;ref name="Vewin 2006"/&gt;

'''Human Resources'''. The ten regional water companies had 4,938 full-time equivalent employees in 2008.&lt;ref name="Vewin"/&gt; This figures does not include private sector employees working for companies to which the water companies contract out services. They also do not include employees of municipalities working on sewerage. About 11,000 people work at water boards, an unknown share of which operate and maintain wastewater treatment plants.&lt;ref name="Association of Dutch Water Boards"&gt;[http://www.uvw.nl/engels/index.html Association of Dutch Water Boards]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and recent events ==
'''Consolidation of water companies'''. In 1945 the Dutch water sector was highly fragmented with more than 200 water companies. Their number gradually declined to 10 five decades later. One reason was a transition from groundwater to surface water, and the need to construct capital-intensive and relatively complex treatment plants which required the cooperation of many municipalities. Another reason was that the national government encouraged the creation of larger public limited companies through a law enacted in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iwahq.org/uploads/iwa%20hq/website%20files/utilities/benchmarking_amsterdam_06/IWA%20conference%20on%20benchmarking%202006_04_Theo%20Schmitz.pdf VEWIN Presentation 2006, p. 6]&lt;/ref&gt; However, since the 1990s consolidation has not been driven by the government, but rather by a desire of water companies themselves to reach economies of scale and to be "competitive" in a more liberalized European market.

'''Benchmarking'''. Since 1997 the Dutch water companies have engaged in a voluntary exercise to [[Benchmarking|benchmark]] their performance against each other, in order to improve their efficiency and increase transparency. Initially, the benchmarking was undertaken to forestall a government proposal by the Ministry of Economic Affairs to establish a regulatory agency following the [[Water supply and sanitation in the United Kingdom|British model]].  Later on, when the regulatory agency did not materialize, benchmarking was pursued more and more for its intrinsic benefits. The Dutch benchmarking exercise covers four areas: water quality; service; environment; and finance and efficiency. The Dutch benchmarking program was the first nationwide benchmarking exercise in the water supply sector in continental Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iwahq.org/uploads/iwa%20hq/website%20files/utilities/benchmarking_amsterdam_06/IWA%20conference%20on%20benchmarking%202006_04_Theo%20Schmitz.pdf VEWIN Presentation 2006, p. 14-15]&lt;/ref&gt; Since then it has inspired similar water and sanitation benchmarking exercises in other European countries, including Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden and Germany. Most of these exercises are coordinated since 2004 in the North European Benchmarking Co-operation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.waterbenchmark.org/ North European Benchmarking Co-operation].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ban of private companies from providing drinking water'''. In 2004 the Netherlands passed a law which prevents any privately owned company from providing drinking water services to the public. The law is a follow-up to a 1997 government paper, which made clear that water supply concessions would only be given to government-owned companies. It had been introduced in 2000 by the Dutch Environment Minister at the time (1998–2002), [[Jan Pronk]]. The bill only covers drinking water provision to households, not sewerage and wastewater treatment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psiru.org/reports/2004-11-W-crim.doc PSIRU Making water privatisation illegal: - new laws in Netherlands and Uruguay], 2004, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Since almost all water companies in the Netherlands are public and they contract out many services to the private sector, which the law allows, the law has not had any practical consequences.

== Responsibility for water supply and sanitation ==
Responsibilities in the Dutch drinking water and sanitation sector are spread over a number of institutions at different levels of regional aggregation and with specific functions. At the national level two Ministries share responsibility for the sector, and there is no autonomous regulatory agency as it is the case in England, states of the US or Portugal. At the regional level there are 10 water companies in charge of drinking water supply and 27 [[Water board (The Netherlands)|water boards]], which are in charge of wastewater treatment, among other tasks. At the local level, municipalities are in charge of sewerage. Knowledge institutions and NGOs play an active role in the sector. While the sector may appear institutionally fragmented, cooperation between the various stakeholders is usually strong, minimizing frictions and conflicts.

=== Policy and regulation ===
The legal framework of the Dutch water sector consists of the Water Supply Act of 2005 and a corresponding Decree on Water Supply, as well as the Water Boards Act of 1995.

Within the government two Ministries share responsibility for the sector. The [[Ministry of Housing, Spatial Planning and the Environment]] (called VROM, using its Dutch acronym) is in charge of water supply and regulates public health.
The [[Ministry of Transport, Public Works and Water Management]] is in charge of water resources management. Its Directorate-General for Public Works and Water Management (''[[Rijkswaterstaat]]'') is in charge of water resources policy and managing surface water, such as the [[IJsselmeer]], and the rivers [[Rhine]] and [[Meuse (river)|Maas]], in cooperation with the Water Boards (see below). The Ministry’s Inspectorate for Transport, Public Works and Water Management is in charge of monitoring compliance with regulations.

The 12 [[provinces of the Netherlands]] are responsible for groundwater management, for example through licenses for groundwater extraction. They usually delegate their water-related functions to the Water Boards (see below).

=== Service provision ===
'''Public regional water companies'''. Ten Dutch water companies are responsible for drinking water supply in the Netherlands. The Association of Dutch Water Companies (Vewin) represents them. Many of their services, such as customer relations and repairs, are contracted out to the private sector. Their 6-year joint research programme is contracted to KWR (see 'Knowledge institutes' below).

'''Private sector'''. The small private company NV Bronwaterleiding Doorn provides drinking water to the municipality of [[Doorn]] and a neighboring municipality. As per the provision of the law banning private sector participation in the provision of water services, the company is slated to be taken over by the much larger regional public water company VITENS which operates in the surrounding area.

'''Municipalities'''. 431 municipalities are responsible for collecting wastewater via the sewer system.

'''Water Boards'''. The 24 water boards (''Waterschappen'') are key institutions in charge of water resources management in the Netherlands. They are decentralised public authorities with their own legal personality and financial resources. Water boards are based on the Dutch Constitution. Their responsibilities are outlined in the Water Boards Act of 1995. Water boards are responsible for flood control, management of regional water resources (quantity and quality) and treatment of urban wastewater. The oldest water boards date from the 13th century, making them the oldest democratic structure in the Netherlands. The umbrella organisation of the water boards is the Association of Dutch Water Boards (''Unie van Waterschappen'').&lt;ref name="Association of Dutch Water Boards"/&gt; Many water boards contract out services to the private sector, such as through DBFO (Design, Build, Finance, Operate) contracts for wastewater treatment plants involving private operation for a period of 30&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.veoliawater.com/veolia-water/key-figures/locations/europe/netherlands.htm Veolia Water in the Netherlands]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Waternet''' In the case of Amsterdam, the local water supply company and the local Water Board DWR merged in January 2006 to form Waternet, thus forming the first integrated water and sanitation company in the Netherlands.

=== Knowledge institutes ===
[[Https://www.kwrwater.nl/en/ Watercycle Research Institute]] is the coordinator and principal implementor of the [https://www.kwrwater.nl/en/samenwerkingen/water-company-joint-research/ joint research programme for the Dutch water companies], De Watergroep from Belgium, and Vewin. Nowhere else in the world do water companies work so closely with each other and their knowledge institute. KWR stems from [[Kiwa NV|Kiwa]], established in 1948. In 2006, Kiwa Water Research became an independent entity, with the Dutch water companies (and in 2016 De Watergroep in Belgium) as its shareholders. In 2008 it changed its name into KWR Watercycle Research Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vewin.nl/nieuws/paginas/Kiwa_Water_Research_wordt_KWR_Watercycle_Research_Institute_510.aspx?source=/zoek/Paginas/default.aspx|title=Vewin website|last=|first=|date=|website=Vewin|language=nl-NL|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Netherlands Water Information Network, the Netherlands has “developed a coherent knowledge infrastructure in the water sector, comprising government and private research centres, technological and educational institutes (such as Alterra, UNESCO-IHE, ITC, Deltares) and several universities”. These institutes carry out a broad range of basic and applied research, from hydraulic engineering to integrated water management. The institutes have formed close connections with internationally oriented private sector companies. The institutes “have built up considerable networks and experience in water-related issues at international level”. Lessons learned abroad have also been successfully applied in the Netherlands. For example, the results of research into the natural processes of undisturbed water systems (which are now rare in the Netherlands), are used as points of reference for the ecological restoration of water systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.waterland.net/index.cfm/site/Water%20in%20the%20Netherlands/pageid/B59E126C-0279-4BB7-B39B1BBED540496E/index.cfm Waterland:Knowledge institutes]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Non-governmental organizations ===
Still according to the Netherlands Water Information Network, many Dutch non-governmental organizations (NGOs) engaged in the water sector “have a solid institutional and financial base, as well as an international focus”. They participate in UN organizations, sessions of the Global Biodiversity Forum (with inputs from the World Conservation Union, IUCN), the Ramsar Bureau and Convention, and the World Water Forum. The international NGOs Wetland International and Bird Life International are based in [[Wageningen]]. Their presence has “not only helped to improve the interactions between Dutch ministries, knowledge institutes and NGOs, but has also strengthened the effectiveness and scope of Dutch protection strategies”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.waterland.net/index.cfm/site/Water%20in%20the%20Netherlands/pageid/B59D8C92-B60D-A4C8-78BE7F94073B05D1/index.cfm Waterland:NGOs]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Efficiency ==
Using established indicators for the technical operational efficiency of water utilities, the Dutch water companies are highly efficient. For example, according to the association of Dutch water utilities, leakage losses are below 6%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vewin.nl/english/Dutch%20water%20sector/Pages/default.aspx VEWIN]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the same source, the number of employees per 1,000 connections (water only, without sanitation) is less than 1. Both these figures are among the lowest in the world.

== Financial aspects ==
'''Tariffs'''. According to the consulting firm NUS the average water tariff for the five largest cities in the Netherlands in 2007 for a monthly consumption of 10m³ was slightly higher than the national average indicated by VEWA, at €1.77/m³. The average sanitation tariff was €2.09/m³. The total water and sanitation tariff of €3.87/m³. According to the study, it is the third-highest tariff among 11 European countries included in the study after Germany and Denmark.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cms.sictiam.com/cms/30_adm06/upload/Gestion%20de%20leau.pdf Alain Tiret 2008, p. 20, quoting NUS]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to VEWIN, the association of water companies, the average water tariff for all cities in the Netherlands in 2008 was slightly lower at €1.49/m³ but without sanitation. This includes €0.20/m³ of tap water tax and [[VAT]], provincial groundwater levies, distribution and concession reimbursements. Tariffs vary between €1.17 and €2.01 per m³. The tariff structure is binomial with a fixed portion and a variable portion. Tariffs can vary within the service area of a water company, depending on local costs. The [[International Water Association]] estimated that the average residential water bill in the Netherlands for a consumption of 200m³ per year in 2007 was  €250.00.&lt;ref&gt;IWA International Water Statistics Leaflet, Vienna 2008, quoted in Vewin Annual Report 2008, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Water board finances and wastewater treatment levy'''. Water boards have the authority to levy taxes and finance their activities mostly with revenues from these taxes. The three main taxes levied by the water boards are a charge for flood protection, a water resources management charge, and a water pollution levy for wastewater treatment. The pollution levy is based on the principle that a polluter must pay for the pollution that he causes. Every household in the Netherlands pays the pollution levy. Companies and organizations pay a rate linked to the quantity and composition of their waste water. The revenues from these taxes provide a budget of €1.9&amp;nbsp;billion in 2004. The total costs in the same year are estimated at around €2.3&amp;nbsp;billion, including a share for wastewater treatment. On average around 95% of all annual investment costs and management and maintenance costs by the Water Boards are covered by their revenues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uvw.nl/engels/index.html UVW Revenues and expenditures]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Investment'''. €323m was invested in water supply in 2008. There is no information on investments in sanitation, making international comparisons difficult.&lt;ref name="Vewin"/&gt;
