'''Boardsports''' are sports that are played with some sort of board as the primary equipment. These sports take place on a variety of terrain, from paved flat-ground and snow-covered hills to water and air. Most boardsports are considered action sports or [[extreme sports]], and thus often appeal to youth. A large proportion of youth partaking in these sports, together with aesthetic damage to property from sports like skateboarding, has led to many board sports being marginalized by the greater world of sports in the past. However, many board sports are ever-more frequently gaining mainstream recognition, and with this recognition have enjoyed wider broadcast, sponsorship and inclusion in institutional sporting events, including the [[Olympic Games]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110716183518/http://www.tackyworld.com/skateboard/article/?id=107551 It's Official: Skateboarding Joins the Olympics - Article - Tackyworld.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Surfing]] was the first boardsport, originating from [[Polynesian culture]]. [[Skateboarding]] was then invented by surfers looking to "surf" on land.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.mit.edu/invent/iow/skateboard.html Inventor of the Week: Archive&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; It is hard to estimate when most boardsports were "invented" because people have been making homemade versions throughout history. For example, it is not hard to conceive of a person, who is familiar with the concept of [[skiing]] or [[sledding]], standing sideways on a plank of wood and riding down a snow-covered slope. M.J. "Jack" Burchett is credited with first doing this in 1929, using horse reins and clothesline to secure his feet on the plank of wood.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snowboardinghistory.com/ Snowboarding History&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110116084703/http://www.snowboardinghistory.com/ |date=January 16, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most boardsports have similar, equally unknown origins.

==Classifications== 
There are a variety of board sports, which are characterized by terrain: Surf, Snow, Wake, Skate are the primary.

===Water===

;[[Surfing]]: The grandfather of all board sports, is a surface water sport that involves the participant being carried by a breaking wave.
;[[Stand Up Paddle Surfing|Stand Up Paddle Surfing (SUP)]]:A variant of surfing where one always a stands up on the board and propels oneself by a one-bladed paddle, without lying down on the board. Although originally the goal was to catch and surf the waves, a racing modality has emerged with similarities to kayaking.
;[[Skimboarding]] (1930s) :A discipline of surfing involving riding a board on wet sand or shallow water. A predominantly recreational activity that has evolved into a highly competitive water sport.
;[[Windsurfing]] (1970) : Also known as ''sailboarding''. A water sport involving travel over water on a small 2-4.7 metre board powered by wind acting on a single sail. The sail is connected to the board by a flexible joint
;[[Bodyboarding]] (1971) : Wave riding consisting of a small, roughly rectangular piece of foam, shaped to a hydrodynamic form. The bodyboard is ridden predominantly lying down, (or 'prone'). It can also be ridden in a half-standing stance (known as 'dropknee') or can even be ridden standing up.
;[[Kneeboarding]] (1973) :A discipline of surfing where the rider paddles on his belly into a wave on a kneeboard, then rides the wave face typically on both knees.
;[[Riverboarding]] (1978) : A boardsport in which the participant is prone on the board with fins on his/her feet for propulsion and steering.
;[[Wakeboarding]] (1983) : A surface watersport created from a combination of water skiing, snow boarding and surfing techniques. As in water skiing, the rider is towed behind a boat, or a [[cable skiing]] setup.
;[[Skurfing]] (1984) :Another fast growing boardsport is [[skurfing]] a mix of surfing and more conventional water sports in which the participant is towed behind the boat.
;[[Flowriding]] (1991) : Similar to surfing but done on a man-made artificial sheet wave.
;[[Wakeskating]] (1990s) :A rider is pulled behind a boat on a wakeskate which is smaller than a wakeboard and has no bindings with a foam or griptape surface.
;[[Kitesurfing]] (1996) : Also known as ''kiteboarding''. Boards similar to those known from windsurfing or wakeboarding are propelled by an inflatable or foil power kite, allowing for high speeds and high jumps. Other variations are to use a wheeled board or buggy on land, or skis or a snowboard on snow.
; [[Wakesurfing]] (1997) : A rider is pulled behind a boat on a mini surfboard and can ride the boat's wake with no rope.

===Land===
====Paved surface====

;[[Skateboarding]] (1950) : Uses a board mounted on wheels, and often ridden on a half-pipe, in urban settings, or emptied specially built swimming pools. 
;[[Longboarding]] (1970s) : Similar to freeboarding but with long skateboards that come in different shapes and sizes, longboarding is mostly a racing sport but there are many other styles as well.
;[[Snakeboard]] (1989) : Similar to skateboarding, but also influenced heavily by snowboarding. 
;[[Freestyle scootering]] (1996) : an action sport which involves using scooters to perform freestyle tricks, in a manner similar to skateboarding and BMX freestyle.
; [[Carveboarding]] : A board that has wheels similar to a car except smaller, it turns better than most boards on four wheels, its main purpose is to cruise and carve, it can turn 65 degrees, and has spring-loaded trucks that are almost as unique as a flowboards trucks.
;[[Freeboard (skateboard)|Freeboarding]]: Often said to be the board whose feel is the most similar to snowboarding. There are two extra castor wheels in the middle of the base that are somewhat lower than the other four. This allows the rider to distribute his weight to only one "edge", as in snowboarding. This gives the rider the ability to slide, an ability no other land board has besides the longboard.
;[[Caster board]] : Two narrow platforms known as "decks" are adjoined by a rubber or aluminium coated metal beam that houses a strong spring. Each truck has one wheel that is connected to the board in such a way that each wheel can rotate independently. Both wheels are mounted on slants that measure around 30� in angle, facing away from the front of the board. Similar to [[Vigorboard]] (2003) : Constructed from two platforms, each supported by a single caster with a single wheel giving the board a total of two wheels. the two platforms are connected by heavy metal torsion bar that enables the board to twist in the centre.
; [[Skurfing#Street Skurfing|Street Skurfing]] : Similar to Caster board, but the rider can move both feet independently.
; [[Freeline skates]] (2000's) : A pair of skates designed to give the feeling of skateboarding, snowboarding, surfing, and inline skates all in one. Freeline Skates are extremely portable, making them the smallest and lightest form of transportation. See also [[Skurfing#Street Skurfing|Street Skurfing]].
; [[Street surfing]] : A split deck board connected by a spring rod to allow each half of the board to twist independently from the other, each side only having 1 caster wheel, allowing for tight maneuvers and self propulsion.
; [[On-shore boards]] : A type of board that has four inline wheels and four in the back(two on each side) and is deeply concave in the front.
;[[T-board]]ing :A skateboard deck with two wheels that can spin 360 degrees.

====Off-paved surface====

;[[Land windsurfing]]: A sport similar to traditional windsurfing that is performed on land rather than water. A four-wheeled deck, similar to a mountain board or skateboard deck, is commonly used in conjunction with a mast and sail in order to project the board across land.
;[[Mountainboarding]] (1992) : Similar to snowboarding, but on snowless peaks (in between winter seasons). The board is wider and sturdier. [[Mountainboarding]] is similar to skateboarding in the way that mountainbiking is similar to regular biking.
;[[Kite landboarding]]: Similar to Kite Surfing but the kite is used to pull the rider along flat ground (often a hard packed sandy beach) on a mountainboard.

====Snow====

;[[Snowboarding]] (1977) :A cross between skateboarding and skiing, the board medium is snow, although the condition of the snow can have a major impact on snowboarding style and technique. The four subcategories are freeride, freestyle, alpine and powder.
;[[Snowskating]] (1998) :This is similar to snowboarding but there are no bindings used. Instead the snow skate has a foam grip similar to griptape, enabling you to do skateboard style tricks. There are four main types of snowskates: Single deck (a skateboard-deck-like platform made out of either wood and/or plastic)
; Bilevel (similar to a skate board but, instead of trucks and wheels, a small ski with metal edges called a subdeck is used with special trucks to be used on a ski hill);4x4 (a skateboard but the wheels are replaced by very small skis); Powderskate (can either be like a Bilevel snowskate or a single deck snowskate but longer and wider).
;[[Snowkiting]]: This is when a kite is used to pull a snowboarder along.

====Sand====

;[[Sandboarding]]: A recreational activity similar to snowboarding that takes place on sand dunes rather than snow-covered hills.

===Air===

;[[Skysurfing]]: A kind of skydiving in which the skydiver wears a board attached to their feet and performs surfing-style aerobatics during freefall.

'''Body blading''' (also known as '''buggy rollin'''') is an [[extreme sport]] that involves descending down a slope while wearing a flexible aerodynamic plastic roller suit that has wheels on the feet, knees, torso, and arms.  This suit was created by [[Jean-Yves Blondeau]], and he is one of the premier{{Clarify|date=May 2012}} body bladers.  Body blading is similar to [[roller blading]], and in fact a body blader often starts out using the rollers on their feet in the same fashion as roller blades in order to gain initial speed, but then the rider generally assumes a position lying on the stomach facing down the hill.  A body blader is capable of reaching very high{{Clarify|date=May 2012}} speeds. Maneuverability is achieved by moving the body into various positions to change direction.

'''Bogambara Stadium''' ({{lang-si|බෝගම්බර ක්‍රිඩාංගනය}}) is a [[multi-purpose stadium]] in [[Kandy]], [[Sri Lanka]] It is one of the oldest grounds in the country. Stadium is currently used mostly for [[Rugby football|Rugby]] matches and hosted the games of the [[Singer Sri Lankan Airlines Rugby 7's]]. It has a capacity of 30,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.island.lk/index.php?page_cat=article-details&amp;page=article-details&amp;code_title=3846|title=Kandy’s Clifford Cup win adds spice to its rugby saga|newspaper=[[The Island (Sri Lanka)|The Island]]|first=Ravi|last=Nagahawatte|date=7 August 2010|accessdate=31 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early history==

In 1897 the grounds were converted from a lake to a playing field. At one time it was the site for carnivals, games circuses and gymkhana activities and even an execution ground during the [[United Kingdom|British]] occupation. A number of sporting clubs including [[Kandy Sports Club (rugby)|Kandy Sports Club]], Young’s Stars SC, Young Wanders SC, Green Field SC and schools including St. Anthony’s, [[Trinity College, Kandy|Trinity College]], [[Sri Rahula College Kandy|Sri Rahula College]], St. Paul’s (now known as [[Sri Sumangala College]]), [[Dharmaraja College, Kandy|Dharmaraja College]] and [[Kingswood College (Sri Lanka)|Kingswood College]] used the venue to conduct cricket, football, rugby, hockey and athletics. Bogambara Stadium was not only used for sports, it was also used for [[folk sports]] including [[Elle (sport)|elle]], [[Bahu (sport)|bahu]], [[thattu]] and [[Gudu (sport)|gudu]].

==Sports==
Bogambara Stadium serves as a venue for various sports ranging from Rugby, Football, [[Hockey]], [[Athletics (sport)|Athletics]], [[Netball]], [[Basketball]], [[softball]], and [[cricket]].

==Stadium Development==

[[File:Bogambara stadium.jpg|thumb|right| Inside of the stadium after redevelopment in 2015]]

Bogambara Stadium was renovated into a stadium in 1972, thanks to the Special Commissionership of M. B. Samarakoon, who initiated the renovation work with support from local politicians such as [[E. L. Senanayake]], [[Noel Wimalasena]], [[Shelton Ranaraja]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jeyaraj|first1=D. B. S.|authorlink1=D. B. S. Jeyaraj|title=Shelton Ranaraja : Principled Politician and Conscience-Keeper of the Nation|url=http://www.dailymirror.lk/article/Shelton-Ranaraja-Principled-Politician-and-Conscience-Keeper-of-the-Nation-113690.html|work=[[The Daily Mirror (Sri Lanka)]]|date=6 August 2016|accessdate=31 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and E. W. Balasuriya, a local sports promoter and philanthropist, who assisted in raising donations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nation.lk/online/2017/04/01/ew-balasuriya-the-versatile-sportsman.html|title=E. W. Balasuriya the versatile sportsman|newspaper=[[The Nation (Sri Lanka)|The Nation]]|date=1 April 2017|accessdate=31 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997 the Bogambara stadium was upgraded to an international standard stadium, at a cost of [[Sri Lankan rupee|Rs.]] 89 million, with 75% of the funding coming from the Kandy District Sports Development Foundation, chaired by [[Anuruddha Ratwatte]], the [[Ministry of Defence (Sri Lanka)#Deputy Minister of Defence|Deputy Minister of Defence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.dailynews.lk/2007/12/26/spo02.asp|title=Bid to develop basketball in Kandy District |newspaper=[[Daily News (Sri Lanka)|Daily News]]|date=26 December 2007|accessdate=31 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was re-developed under the patronage of the municipal council and presently the Sports Ministry owns the premises. The ground fees are on the higher side and the less affluent football and hockey clubs are finding it difficult to keep the game alive.

'''Boston–Montreal–Boston''' ''(BMB)'' was a 1200&amp;nbsp;km [[Brevet (cycling)|randonnée]] bicycle ride held on an out-and-back course between the vicinity of [[Boston, Massachusetts]] (US) and [[Huntingdon, Quebec]] (Canada). It was held every year from 1988 through 2006 except for [[Paris–Brest–Paris]] years.

BMB was sometimes regarded as the North American equivalent of Paris–Brest–Paris.

It was a noncompetitive endurance bike event.

[[File:Tuftscriterium.jpg|thumb|Racing cyclists wearing cycling shorts.]]

'''Cycling shorts''' (also known as '''bike shorts''', '''bicycling shorts''', '''chamois''', '''knicks''', or '''spats''') are short, skin-tight legwear designed to improve comfort and efficiency while [[cycling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Fitness Cycling|author1=Dede Demet Barry |author2=Michael Barry |author3=Shannon Sovndal |year=2006|publisher=Human Kinetics|isbn=0-7360-6364-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They:
* reduce [[wind resistance]], increasing aerodynamic efficiency;
* protect the skin against the repetitive [[friction]] of the legs against the bicycle seat or frame;
* provide support to the genitals, analogously to a [[jock strap]];
* draw sweat away from the skin to prevent chafing and rashes, and to cool the rider down through the process of evaporation;
* compress the legs, which can help combat [[muscular fatigue]];
* not get caught up in the [[bike chain]] or other parts of the bike;
* reduce the weight of a rider's clothing (compared to wearing denim, gym shorts or baggy shorts); and
* improve comfort during long rides with extra padding in the seat area called [[cycling pad]].

Historically, cycling shorts were made of knit black [[wool]], which hides wear marks caused by sitting on an oiled leather saddle for extended periods of time, with a [[chamois leather]] padding inside the shorts in the crotch area, which reduces chafing from the bicycle saddle.  Modern cycling shorts are often made of [[spandex]] (Lycra) with a synthetic [[Cycling pad|chamois]] which acts as an elastic interface between the cyclist's body and the saddle, and are produced in a variety of shapes and styles to suit the needs of different riders. On some cycling shorts different materials are often placed on different parts of the shorts to take advantage of each materials benefit providing a very efficicent cycling short. For example, the patterns used for the chamois on women's cycling shorts tend to be quite different from those used for men's. The [[hem]] of each leg is usually lined with [[Elastomer|elastic]] and/or silicone that clings to the skin, keeping it in a fixed position. These shorts made from several panels (or cuts of fabric) fit better and are more beneficial, especially for racers, but cost more.

Short-legged elastic tights commonly worn as [[street wear]], under girls skirts and dresses, for gymnastics and ballet practice, or under athletic and running shorts are sometimes also referred to as "bike shorts", but they are typically simpler and lighter garments than those worn by cyclists and generally lack the chamois or faux-chamois lining.

== Bib shorts == &lt;!-- [[Bib shorts]] redirects here. --&gt;
[[File:Cycling Bibshorts.jpg|200px|thumb|A man wearing bib style biking shorts. Normally a jersey would be worn on top.]]
Bib shorts are cycling shorts that are held up by a bib (integral suspenders/braces) instead of an elastic waistband. Pro and serious riders tend to prefer bib shorts over non-bib shorts due, to the discomfort that often occurs with an elastic waistband, such as tightness (digging into skin) and chafing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bicycling.com/bikes-and-gear-features/how/how-buy-bib-shorts|title=How to Buy Bib Shorts|last=Cross|first=Kim|work=[[Bicycling (magazine)|Bicycling]]|date=2013-07-24|accessdate=2015-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bib part of the short is often made of spandex and polyester with large sections of netting to help keep the rider cool.
 
The idea of modern bib shorts was a development from the braces (UK) or suspenders (US) that cyclists once used to hold up old-fashioned wool shorts, which had a tendency to become loose and heavy from riders' sweat (the use of braces/suspenders meant the shorts could be held up without an uncomfortably tight waistband). Bib shorts are well-suited to tall riders and riders with protruding stomachs because regular shorts can tend to fall down in the back while riding.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

== Mountain bike shorts ==

These shorts typically are more loose than bib shorts but still not baggy. This is because they are focused more on protecting the rider during falls and are not as focused on aerodynamic efficiency. The position of the padding is a little different because mountain bikers have a more upright stance when riding. These shorts are different from baggy shorts as they are used by hardcore cyclists who still need the protection with a good padding, which the baggy shorts do not have.

== Baggy shorts ==

Baggy shorts (or ''shy shorts'') are cycling shorts that look like regular shorts on the outside, but that are designed for cycling. Some have a thin chamois lining on the inside. This lining ranges from polyester fabric to full eight-panel, form-fitting cycling shorts beneath the baggier outside shorts. Others are designed to be worn with a separate liner short underneath. These shorts provide a more casual look when riding around town and off dedicated bike paths. These shorts are basically dual purpose in that the wearer need not to change from tight singular purpose cycling shorts into casual clothes when going out yet have some of the benefits of wearing a cycling short.

The '''Dasarath Stadium''' ({{lang-ne|दशरथ रंगशाला}}) is a [[multi-purpose stadium]] in Tripureshwar, [[Kathmandu]]. Holding 30,000,&lt;ref name="soccerfame.ro"&gt;http://www.soccerfame.ro/team/nepal/stadium&lt;/ref&gt; it is the biggest stadium in Nepal. It is named after [[Dashrath Chand]], one of four great  martyrs of Nepal. The stadium was damaged in the [[April 2015 Nepal earthquake]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Renovation of Dasharath Stadium takes forever, hurts nation’s football|url=http://www.myrepublica.com/news/27598/|website=[[República (Nepalese newspaper)|República]]|accessdate=29 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium is used mostly for [[football (soccer)|football]] matches and cultural and entertainment programs. [[Three Star Club]] are tenants of the stadium. It has [[floodlights (sport)|floodlights]] installed, to facilitate matches and events in the evenings. Most of Nepal's national and international tournaments are held in this stadium. Nepal's primary football division, [[Martyr's Memorial League]], is also held in this ground every year.

==History==
[[File:Dasarath Rangasala Stadium damaged.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Stadium showing damage in February 2018]]
The stadium was built in 1956. It was renovated in 1998 to host the [[1999 South Asian Games]]. In 2011 it was again renovated, to host the [[2012 AFC Challenge Cup]]. The 1988 [[Kathmandu stadium disaster]] had also hit the stadium, it resulted in 93 casualties.

As Nepal's biggest stadium, the Dasharath Stadium has hosted many important events. The [[2012 AFC Challenge Cup]] and the [[2013 SAFF Championship]] were held here, with the [[Halchowk Stadium]] hosting some of the matches as well. Apart from sports, numerous cultural festivals and musical events take place here. The 2011 concert of [[Bryan Adams]] was held in this stadium, and was his first rock concert in Nepal.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;[http://www.thehimalayantimes.com/fullNews.php?headline=Bryan+Adams+cuts+history+like+a+knife+in+Nepal&amp;NewsID=277006 Bryan Adams cuts history like a knife in Nepal], ''Canadian rockstar Bryan Adams creates history with Nepal’s first rock concert featuring an international star at the Bryan Adams live-in-concert in the Dasharath Stadium in the Capital on Saturday, February 19, 2011.''

'''Ellesse''' is a sports apparel company founded in Italy in 1959. It has been owned by British [[Pentland Group]] since 1987.

==History==
[[Image:Leonardo Servadio.JPG|thumb|right|Leonardo Servadio]]
Ellesse was founded by Leonardo Servadio in [[Perugia]] in 1959. The name Ellesse derives from the initials of Servadio's name, "L.S."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ellesse.com/about|title=ellesse|date=7 November 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ellesse grew in popularity during the 1970s as a producer of skiwear such as quilted jackets and ski pants. In 1979, Ellesse's Jet Pant, a ski pant featuring padded knees and a wide lower leg to fit around a ski boot, was included in an event at the [[Pompidou Centre]] in Paris celebrating Italian design.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ellesse.com/press-room/did-you-know.aspx Ellesse: Did You Know?] Retrieved 2009-11-04&lt;/ref&gt;

Another sport with which Ellesse has been closely associated since its early years is tennis. The Ellesse logo references the form of a tennisball with the shape of the tips of a pair of skis.

Through the 1970s and 1980s, Ellesse gained a reputation for combining sportswear functionality with street-level fashion styling. It was one of the first sportswear brands to feature their logo prominently on the outside of its garments. During the mid-1980s, French designer [[Jean-Charles de Castelbajac]] worked with Ellesse, an early collaboration between a sportswear company and a fashion designer.
The UK [[Casual (subculture)|casuals]] adopted the brand in the '80s as premium sportswear took off across British [[lad culture]].

==Celebrity endorsements==
A number of sports celebrities have endorsed Ellesse, including tennis players [[Tommy Haas]], [[Chris Evert]], [[Guillermo Vilas]], [[Boris Becker]], [[Mats Wilander]], [[Arantxa Sánchez]] and [[Anna Kournikova]], skiers [[Marc Girardelli]] and [[Jean-Luc Crétier]], and Formula 1 driver [[Alain Prost]].

Other celebrities associated with the brand include boxer [[Muhammad Ali]], Liam Smith [[Natas Kaupas]] and [[Maurice Cheeks]], and actors [[Brigitte Nielsen]] and [[Roger Moore]].

Ellesse also ventured into football sponsorship, and manufactured the kits for the [[New York Cosmos (1971–1985)|New York Cosmos]] in the '80s.

==Purchase by Pentland Group==
In 1994 British brand management company [[Pentland Group]] purchased a ninety per cent share of Ellesse for £20 million. Pentland had been Ellesse's UK distributor since 1981. Servadio retained a 10 per cent share.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/pentland-group-spends-pounds-20m-on-italian-sportswear-manufacturer-uk-company-in-charge-after-13year-link-with-ellesse-1404922.html Pentland Group spends pounds 20m on Italian sportswear manufacturer: UK company in charge after 13-year link with Ellesse (5 January 1994)] Retrieved 2009-11-04&lt;/ref&gt;

Pentland Group also owns other well-known sportswear brands such as [[Berghaus]] and [[Speedo]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pentland.com/our-brands.html Our Brands] Retrieved 2009-11-04&lt;/ref&gt; It currently licenses the Ellesse brand to partners in countries around the world, who manufacture and distribute Ellesse products in their territory.

Ellesse celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2009 with a party in Rome in July 2009.

The '''Friendship Games''', or '''Friendship-84''' ({{lang-ru|Дружба-84}}, ''Druzhba-84''), was an international [[multi-sport event]] held between 2 July and 16 September 1984 in the [[Soviet Union]] and eight other [[socialist state]]s which [[1984 Summer Olympics boycott|boycotted]] the [[1984 Summer Olympics]] in [[Los Angeles]].

While the boycotting countries were represented by their strongest athletes, other states sent their reserve teams, consisting of athletes who failed to qualify for Los Angeles.&lt;ref name=what-might-have-been /&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Juan Antonio Samaranch DF-ST-01-00128.JPEG.jpg|thumb|left| [[Juan Antonio Samaranch]] (''2000 photograph''), [[Presidents of the International Olympic Committee|President of the IOC]], held a conference with the [[Eastern Bloc]] countries in May 1984, attempting to change their decision on boycotting the [[1984 Summer Olympics|Los Angeles Olympics]]. Instead, the socialist states used this meeting to discuss details of their own multi-sport event, the Friendship Games.

On 8 May 1984, less than three months before the [[1984 Summer Olympics]] were scheduled to begin, the [[Soviet Union]] announced its decision to boycott the Games, citing lack of security for Soviet athletes in [[Los Angeles]].&lt;ref name=Soviet-pullout-rocks-Games&gt;{{cite news |date=9 May 1984 |title=Soviet pullout rocks Games |newspaper=[[The Montreal Gazette]] |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=eVwxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=l6UFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1833,4342317}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union|TASS]] news agency further accused the [[United States]] of trying to "exploit the Games for its political purposes"&lt;ref name=Alternate-Games-Would-Repudiate-Charter&gt;{{cite news |date=10 May 1984 |title=Alternate Games Would Repudiate Charter |newspaper=[[The Palm Beach Post]] |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=-_EuAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=UM8FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1287,7742871}}&lt;/ref&gt; stating that the "arrogant, hegemonic course of the Washington administration in international relations is at odds with the noble ideals of the Olympic movement".&lt;ref name=Alternate-Games-Would-Repudiate-Charter /&gt;
In an article published by the ''[[London Evening Standard]]'' several hours before the official announcement, [[Victor Louis (journalist)|Victor Louis]] – a Soviet journalist writing for the Western press, thought to be used by the [[Kremlin]] as an unofficial means of leaking information to the West&lt;ref name=Afghanistan-Joins-Boycott&gt;{{cite news |last1=Lowitt |first1=Bruce |date=14 May 1984 |title= Afghanistan Joins Boycott (part 1)|newspaper=The Victoria Advocate |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=-MMcAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=p1kEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6804,4042639 }} {{cite news|last1=Lowitt |first1=Bruce |date=14 May 1984 |title= Afghanistan Joins Boycott (part 2)|newspaper=The Victoria Advocate |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=-MMcAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=p1kEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5131,4049411}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bulgaria-pulls-out-Reagan-intervenes&gt;{{cite news |date=10 May 1984 |title=Bulgaria pulls out, Reagan intervenes|newspaper=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=auYNAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=G24DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7131,2161071 }}&lt;/ref&gt; – first informed the world of the USSR's decision to boycott, adding that detailed plans for the "Soviet bloc's alternative games" had already been made. Louis claimed they would "probably be announced at the last minute to throw the American organization into chaos".&lt;ref name=Bulgaria-pulls-out-Reagan-intervenes /&gt; The article named [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] as the possible host country.&lt;ref name=Bulgaria-pulls-out-Reagan-intervenes /&gt; On 10 May, Bulgaria became the first Soviet ally to join the boycott,&lt;ref name=Bulgaria-pulls-out-Reagan-intervenes /&gt; soon followed by [[East Germany]] (also 10 May),&lt;ref name=East-Germany-withdraws-from-Summer-Games&gt;{{cite news |date=10 May 1984 |title=East Germany withdraws from Summer Games|newspaper=The [[Evening Independent]] |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=cAIMAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=i1kDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7026,2613126 |location=[[St. Petersburg, Florida]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mongolia]] and [[Vietnam]] (both 11 May).&lt;ref name=Vietnam-Mongolia-join-Games-bailout&gt;{{cite news|date=12 May 1984 |title=Vietnam, Mongolia join Games bailout|newspaper=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=bOYNAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=G24DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7079,2953727}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Louis wrote another article on 13 May, for the French ''[[Le Journal du Dimanche]]'',&lt;ref name=Afghanistan-Joins-Boycott /&gt; once again stating that the Soviet Union was contemplating counter-Olympic Games, possibly held in [[Sofia]], the capital of Bulgaria. However, this time he noted that the idea was unlikely, as the Soviets feared that organizing such an event might prompt the [[International Olympic Committee]] to exclude the USSR.&lt;ref name=Afghanistan-Joins-Boycott /&gt; On the same day, Soviet sports commentator Vsevold Kuskuskin, during an interview for [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] television program ''[[This Week (ABC TV series)|This Week with David Brinkley]]'', said the [[Eastern Bloc]] would definitely not organize such games.&lt;ref name=Afghanistan-Joins-Boycott /&gt; Also on 13 May, [[Laos]], [[Czechoslovakia]] and [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]] announced their decision to boycott the Los Angeles games.&lt;ref name=Afghanistan-Joins-Boycott /&gt;&lt;ref name=Czechoslovakia-Laos-join-the-list&gt;{{cite news|last1=Joyce |first1=Dick |date=13 May 1984 |title=Czechoslovakia, Laos join the list|newspaper=[[Anchorage Daily News]] |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=-R8fAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=facEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1529,6975019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 May, Marat Gramov, head of the Soviet Olympic Committee, called a press conference to discuss the boycott.&lt;ref name=Soviets-slamming&gt;{{cite news|date=15 May 1984|title=Soviets, slamming Olympics door, charge US plot |newspaper=[[The Christian Science Monitor]] |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/1984/0515/051549.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the conference, Gramov assured "Moscow would not support any alternative games staged to compete with the Olympics".&lt;ref name=Soviets-slamming /&gt; On the same day, [[People's Republic of Poland|Poland]] stated that, while Eastern Bloc officials had vetoed a counter-Olympics idea, the Bloc would instead "sponsor sports events in various nations as a substitute for participation in the Los Angeles games",&lt;ref name=Soviets-slamming /&gt; holding them at a different time than the Olympics.&lt;ref name=Soviets-slamming /&gt;

[[People's Republic of Hungary|Hungary]] became the ninth country to boycott the 1984 Summer Olympics on 16 May, followed by Poland a day later.&lt;ref name=Hungary-joins&gt;{{cite news |date=16 May 1984 |title=Hungary joins Soviet boycott |newspaper=[[Lodi News-Sentinel]] |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=sbAzAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=QzIHAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5389,2026175}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Poland-10th&gt;{{cite news|last1=Barnard |first1=William R. |date=17 May 1984 |title=Poland 10th to join Olympic boycott |newspaper=[[The Deseret News]] |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=4g8fAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=D4MDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6350,599674}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 May, Olaf Brockmann of Austrian newspaper ''[[Die Presse]]'', citing Alexander Ushakov, head trainer of the Soviet decathlon team, said Eastern Bloc countries were hastily arranging a series of sports events.&lt;ref name=Soviet-Bloc-Discussing&gt;{{cite news |date=20 May 1984 |title=Soviet Bloc Discussing Own Games |newspaper=[[Ocala Star-Banner]] |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=HR8VAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=RAYEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6793,2319906}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brockmann named five competitions: two track and field athletics meets, one to be held in [[Prague]], Czechoslovakia, and the other in [[East Berlin]] and [[Potsdam]], East Germany; plus fencing, modern pentathlon and boxing events to be held in Poland.&lt;ref name=Soviet-Bloc-Discussing /&gt; Ushakov reportedly said the events would be held either before or after the Olympics, to avoid conflicts with the IOC, which would ban any form of counter-Olympic Games.&lt;ref name=Soviet-Bloc-Discussing /&gt;

[[Juan Antonio Samaranch]], [[Presidents of the International Olympic Committee|President of the IOC]], held a conference with Olympic Committees of eleven Eastern Bloc countries (eight of the boycotting states – Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary, Mongolia, Poland, the Soviet Union and Vietnam – plus [[Cuba]], [[North Korea]] and [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania]])&lt;ref name=Communist-nations-plan&gt;{{cite news |date=25 May 1984 |title=Communist nations plan own games |newspaper=Mohave Daily Miner |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=SZUNAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=s1YDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1054,3766667 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in Prague, Czechoslovakia, starting on 21 May.&lt;ref name=Communist-leaders&gt;{{cite news |date=21 May 1984 |title=Communist leaders confer on Olympics |newspaper=[[The Tuscaloosa News]] |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=XzAjAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=66UEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5073,6946151}}&lt;/ref&gt; Samaranch hoped to convince the boycotting states to change their position,&lt;ref name=Communist-leaders /&gt; but while Romania assured him it would attend the Los Angeles Olympics,&lt;ref name=Prague-Conference /&gt;&lt;ref name=Communist-nations-plan /&gt; the remaining ten countries did not change their stance and even used the meeting to discuss "their own summer games".&lt;ref name=Prague-Conference /&gt;&lt;ref name=Communist-nations-plan /&gt; The official announcement was made by Antonin Himl, President of the Czech National Olympic Committee, who appeared on Prague television on 24 May.&lt;ref name=Prague-Conference /&gt;&lt;ref name=Communist-nations-plan /&gt; Himl said that, after the Olympic Games ended, various Eastern bloc countries would hold their own sport events in Olympic disciplines.&lt;ref name=Communist-nations-plan /&gt; Himl stated that the games' intention would be to "give athletes who have conscientiously prepared for the past four years a possibility to sell their abilities".&lt;ref name=Communist-nations-plan /&gt; Thus, the Friendship Games idea was officially proclaimed.

Himl said the games would be held after 12 August (i.e. after the Summer Olympics), and that his country, Czechoslovakia, would host gymnastics, archery, women's handball, and women's track and field athletics.&lt;ref name=Boycott-nations&gt;{{cite news |date=25 May 1984 |title= Boycott nations will stage own games |newspaper=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=d-YNAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=G24DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3969,6224193}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also gave assurances that the events would be open to all athletes, including those from non-boycotting nations.&lt;ref name=Boycott-nations /&gt;

Soon after the meeting, Cuba also announced its decision to boycott the 1984 Summer Olympics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Maxwell |first1=Evan |date=24 May 1984|title=Cuba Joins Olympic Boycott |newspaper=[[The Los Angeles Times]] |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/676722322.html?dids=676722322:676722322&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=May+24%2C+1984&amp;author=&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of June, [[North Korea]], [[South Yemen]], [[Ethiopia]] and [[Angola]] had done the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=27 May 1984|title=Marxist South Yemen Becomes 12th Country to Drop Out of L.A.

In June, the Soviet Union asked [[Ted Turner]] and his [[Turner Broadcasting System]] to televise the events held in Hungary for American audiences.&lt;ref name=Ted-Turner1 /&gt; Turner eventually declined, but assured that his network would give spot coverage to the Games and treat it as any other sporting event.&lt;ref name=Ted-Turner2&gt;{{cite news |date=7 July 1984|title=Sports People; Turner Backs Off |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/07/07/sports/sports-people-turner-backs-off.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Participating nations==

Initial estimates placed the number of athletes participating in Soviet event venues at approximately 8,000.&lt;ref name=generic-competition /&gt;&lt;ref name=Moscow-to-stage /&gt; Later, the number of expected participants was lowered to 2,300, representing 49 countries.&lt;ref name=generic-competition /&gt;&lt;ref name=Good-times&gt;{{cite news|date=18 August 1984|title=Good times are in order at the Friendship Games|newspaper=[[The Deseret News]]|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=k5AzAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=A4MDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6955,827200}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Infosport"&gt;{{cite web|title=Infosport ("1984" section)|url=http://www.infosport.ru/memoryPro/DocMemory.asp|accessdate=29 June 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091026171319/http://www.infosport.ru/memoryPro/DocMemory.asp|archivedate=26 October 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, not all the expected athletes showed up.&lt;ref name=Games-open-with-challenge /&gt; The exact number of athletes who took part in events held outside of the Soviet Union is unknown.

While Olympic-boycotting countries were represented by their strongest athletes, other states sent their reserve teams, consisting of athletes who failed to qualify for the 1984 Summer Olympics.&lt;ref name=what-might-have-been /&gt;

==Opening ceremony==
Although the Games began on 2 July with table tennis events held in North Korea, the official opening ceremony was held on 18 August in Moscow, soon after the first events hosted by the Soviet Union started.&lt;ref name=Games-open-with-challenge&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schmemann |first1=Serge |date=19 August 1984|title=Friendship Games open with a Soviet challenge |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=fpoRAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=QOgDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2829,2815005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=open-with-pomp&gt;{{cite news |date=19 August 1984 |title=Friendship Games open with pomp|newspaper=[[The Spokesman-Review]] |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=a_MRAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=9-4DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3838,1743115 | location=[[Spokane]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two-hour ceremony held at the [[Luzhniki Stadium|Central Lenin Stadium]]&lt;ref name=open-with-pomp /&gt; included "girls in white leotards [spinning] red and white beachballs in unison, (...) dozens of children in traditional costumes of the Soviet republics",&lt;ref name=open-with-pomp /&gt; a "squadron of young performers" which created "a human weaving machine by ducking and turning to mesh their colored banners"&lt;ref name=open-with-pomp /&gt; and "red-attired teenage girls with silver [[hula hoop]]s", which spelled the words 'USSR' and 'peace'.&lt;ref name=open-with-pomp /&gt; The ceremony was described as being "reminiscent of [[Olympic opening ceremony|Olympic galas]]".&lt;ref name=open-with-pomp /&gt;

As in Olympic opening ceremonies,&lt;ref name=open-with-pomp /&gt; a torch bearer (Soviet runner and [[1980 Summer Olympics|1980]] gold medalist [[Viktor Markin]]) carried the flame into the stadium&lt;ref name=open-with-pomp /&gt; and lit a giant bowl which had been built for the 1980 Moscow Olympics.&lt;ref name=Games-open-with-challenge /&gt; The torch had been lit from an [[eternal flame]] for [[World War II]] victims located in the [[Kremlin]].&lt;ref name=Games-open-with-challenge /&gt;

Teams marched onto the stadium behind flags, but unlike in the Olympics, they were not national teams but sporting organisations, such as [[Dynamo Sports Club|Dynamo]] or [[Spartak (sports society)|Spartak]].&lt;ref name=Games-open-with-challenge /&gt;

Songs performed during the ceremony included a 1918 military march dedicated to the [[Red Army]], "Stadium of My Dreams", written for the 1980 Olympics,&lt;ref name=who-is-coming&gt;{{cite news|date=17 August 1984|title=Games open but just who is coming? |newspaper=[[The Spokesman-Review]] |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=afMRAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=9-4DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6976,823056}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a specially composed song with the chorus "To a sunny peace – yes, yes, yes / To a nuclear blast – no, no, no."&lt;ref name=peace-dominating&gt;{{cite news |last1=Eaton |first1=William |date=19 August 1984|title=Peace dominating message at Friendship Games opening|newspaper=[[The Daily Courier (Arizona)|The Daily Courier]] |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=hPEKAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=708DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2742,3591862 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Games-open-with-challenge /&gt;

Events were hosted by nine countries (Bulgaria, Cuba, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary, North Korea, Mongolia, Poland, and the Soviet Union) between 2 July and 16 September 1984. With the exception of equestrian jumping, no events were held during the Summer Olympics in Los Angeles (held between 28 July and 12 August).

The Games were contested in 22 Olympic disciplines (all except [[association football]] and [[synchronized swimming]]), and in non-Olympic [[table tennis]], [[tennis]], and [[sambo (martial art)|sambo wrestling]]. Additionally, the Friendship Games included non-Olympic women's shooting and rhythmic gymnastic events but not women's road race cycling, which became an Olympic event in 1984.

===Archery===

The Soviet Union won five out of six possible medals.

===Athletics===
{{main|Athletics at the Friendship Games}}
In an interview shortly before the events began, the Soviet team's coach [[Igor Ter-Ovanesyan]] said his athletes beat more than ten world records during the preparations for the competition.&lt;ref name=who-is-coming /&gt; While the Soviet athletes set no new records during the Games, they still dominated, winning more than a half of the gold medals. The only new world record was set by East German [[Irina Meszynski]] in women's discus throw, with 73.36 m.

Athletics was the only discipline which saw participation of recent [[1984 Summer Olympics|Olympic]] gold medalists, with American sprinter [[Alice Brown (athlete)|Alice Brown]] taking part in women's 100-metre run, and West German [[Claudia Losch]] competing in shot put. However, neither won medals.&lt;ref name=Westerners-expected&gt;{{cite news|date=16 August 1984|title=Westerners expected at Communist Games|newspaper=[[The Palm Beach Post]] |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=dAYjAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Us0FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5774,4662666}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chmielewski (1987), p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Harvey |first1=Randy |date=25 August 1984|title=Tired Kratochvilova Beats U.S. Olympic Stars in 400|newspaper=[[The Los Angeles Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an unusual feat, [[Alberto Juantorena]] (Cuba) and [[Ryszard Ostrowski]] (Poland) both crossed the finish line at exactly the same moment in the men's 800-metre run. After the officials were unable to decide who came first – even after examining a [[photograph]] – both were declared winners.&lt;ref name=peace-dominating /&gt;

The annual [[Moscow International Peace Marathon|Moscow marathon]] was declared to be a Friendship Games event in 1984. This caused a minor controversy, as the [[United States Marine Corps|United States Marine]] guards of the [[Embassy of the United States in Moscow|American embassy]], who usually took part in it, withdrew after learning it would be treated as a Friendship Games competition.&lt;ref name=peace-dominating /&gt;

===Basketball===
{{main|Basketball at the Friendship Games}}
The Soviet Union won the men's final against Czechoslovakia 105:70, and Cuba came in third ahead of Poland. The USSR also finished first in the women's event, but since it was a [[round-robin tournament]], there were no semifinals or finals.

===Boxing===
{{main|Boxing at the Friendship Games}}
The host nation, Cuba, fully dominated the event, winning eleven out of twelve gold medals. East German [[Torsten Schmitz]] in the [[welterweight]] category was the only non-Cuban to win gold. [[Teófilo Stevenson]], three-time consecutive Olympic gold medalist who lost the chance to win his fourth gold when Cuba boycotted the Los Angeles Games, won the super heavyweight category.

Boxing was one of just three disciplines in which the Soviet Union did not win a gold medal, the others being modern pentathlon and table tennis.

===Canoeing===
{{main|Canoeing at the Friendship Games}}
Hosts East Germany and the Soviet Union won all twelve gold medals, six apiece.

===Cycling===
{{main|Cycling at the Friendship Games}}
The [[Schleizer Dreieck]] in [[Schleiz]], East Germany, usually used as a car or motorcycle race track, served as cycling venue for the individual road race. The event saw participation of top cyclists of the era, including numerous [[Peace Race]] veterans such as [[Uwe Ampler]] and [[Uwe Raab]].

===Diving===
{{main|Diving at the Friendship Games}}
Diving was yet another event dominated by East Germans and Soviets. Gold medalists included [[Aleksandr Portnov]] and [[Brita Baldus]].

===Equestrian===
{{main|Equestrian at the Friendship Games}}
Equestrian events were the only discipline contested at the same time as the 1984 Summer Olympics, as jumping events took place between 6 and 10 August. It was also the only discipline in which West German and Italian athletes won medals.

In individual dressage, [[Yuri Kovshov]] won both gold and silver, riding two different horses.

===Fencing===
{{main|Fencing at the Friendship Games}}
Soviet fencers won most of the men's events, while Hungary won both women's events, thanks to [[Gertrúd Stefanek]] and [[Edit Kovács]].

===Field hockey===
{{main|Field hockey at the Friendship Games}}
The Soviet Union "A" team won the men's tournament, and while the Soviet Union "B" team came in third, fourth-place finishers [[Zimbabwe]] were awarded the bronze medal.

A team representing the [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan]] also competed in the men's event, but lost all its matches, including a 0:27 loss to East Germany.

===Gymnastics===
{{main|Gymnastics at the Friendship Games}}
In artistic gymnastics, [[Olga Mostepanova]] achieved perfect "10" scores ten times: four in individual competitions, and six in team events.&lt;ref&gt;Chmielewski (1987), p. 169&lt;/ref&gt; All fifteen medals in rhythmic gymnastics were won by just four athletes: Bulgarians [[Anelia Ralenkova]] and [[Diliana Gueorguieva]], and Soviets [[Galina Beloglazova]] and [[Dalia Kutkaitė]].

===Handball===
{{main|Handball at the Friendship Games}}
East Germany won the men's event, thanks to an 18:17 win over the Soviet Union, while Poland came in third. [[Péter Kovács (handballer)|Péter Kovács]] of Hungary was the top scorer with 26 goals. The USSR finished first in the women's tournament.

===Judo===
{{main|Judo at the Friendship Games}}
The Soviet Union again won most of the gold medals. The event was also particularly successful for Poland, which won seven medals.

===Modern pentathlon===
{{main|Modern pentathlon at the Friendship Games}}
Hungarian [[László Fábián (pentathlete)|László Fábián]] won the individual competition, and Hungary also won the team event.

===Rowing===
{{main|Rowing at the Friendship Games}}
The USSR took 11 out of 14 gold medals, while East Germany captured the remaining three.

===Sailing===
{{main|Sailing at the Friendship Games}}
Sailing took place on the [[Baltic Sea]], near [[Tallinn]], [[Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic|Estonian SSR]] (where the [[sailing at the 1980 Summer Olympics]] also took place), with the exception of 470 and Finn classes, which were contested on [[Lake Balaton]] in Hungary. Soviets and East Germans won all of the gold medals. [[Canada]] and [[Finland]] won their only Friendship Games medals.

===Shooting===
{{main|Shooting at the Friendship Games}}
While most disciplines mimicked the Olympic Games in terms of events, women's shooting included non-Olympic competitions, namely the [[10 metre air pistol]] and [[50 metre rifle three positions]] events.

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1987-0619-033, Sylvia Gerasch.jpg|thumb|[[Sylvia Gerasch]] ''(1987 photograph)'', a 15-year-old, set the world record in women's 100 m breaststroke]]

===Swimming===
{{main|Swimming at the Friendship Games}}
Five new world records were set during the competition. [[Sergei Zabolotnov]]'s result of 1:58.41 in men's 200 metre backstroke excited the crowd, as it was some one and a half seconds better than [[Rick Carey]]'s result during the Olympics.&lt;ref&gt;Chmielewski (1987), p. 173&lt;/ref&gt; Fifteen-year-old [[Sylvia Gerasch]] of [[East Germany]] set the world record in women's 100 m breaststroke and was also part of the relay team that beat the 4 × 100 m medley record.&lt;ref name=Soviet-officials-shy /&gt;

===Table tennis===
{{main|Table tennis at the Friendship Games}}
Table tennis, a non-Olympic sport at that time, was the only event hosted by North Korea, which won four out of seven gold medals. Notably, the [[People's Republic of China]], which was at odds with most socialist states following the [[Sino-Soviet split]], took part in the event.

===Tennis===
{{main|Tennis at the Friendship Games}}
Soviet players dominated the singles category, and also won the men's doubles event. The Czechoslovakian women's double team was the only non-Soviet team to win gold.

===Volleyball===
{{main|Volleyball at the Friendship Games}}
Not surprisingly, the Soviet team finished first in the men's event, over Cuba and Poland. In women's tournament, Cuba won the final against the USSR.

===Water polo===
{{main|Water polo at the Friendship Games}}
The Soviet team – composed mostly of the players who won gold during the 1980 Summer Olympics – finished first, while Hungary and Cuba took the second and third spots.

===Weightlifting===
{{main|Weightlifting at the Friendship Games}}
Dominated by Bulgaria and the Soviet Union, the event saw thirty world records broken,&lt;ref name=Chmielewski-p186&gt;Chmielewski (1987), p. 186&lt;/ref&gt; including two in the super heavyweight category, set by [[Anatoly Pisarenko]].

===Wrestling===
{{main|Wrestling at the Friendship Games}}
In addition to [[freestyle wrestling|freestyle]] and [[Greco-Roman wrestling|Greco-Roman]] events, non-Olympic [[sambo (martial art)|sambo]] wrestling events were also contested. Sambo was the only event hosted by Mongolia.

==Medal table==
The following table is based on statistics from the books ''Na olimpijskim szlaku 1984'' and ''Gwiazdy sportu '84'' and does not include sambo wrestling results.

==Comparisons to the Olympic Games==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1984-0602-003, Marlies Göhr.jpg|thumb|[[Marlies Göhr]] won the women's 100 metre event with 10.95, slightly faster than [[Evelyn Ashford]]'s winning time of 10.97 at the Olympics]]
Media on both sides of the [[Iron Curtain]] frequently compared the results of 1984 Summer Olympics and the Friendship Games.&lt;ref name=what-might-have-been /&gt;&lt;ref name=athletics-comparsion&gt;{{cite news |date=18 August 1984|title=Olympic vs. Friendship Games comparison|newspaper=[[The Deseret News]] |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=k5AzAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=A4MDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7182,828814}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Afro-American&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lacy |first1=Sam |date=1 September 1984|title=For what it means: Olympic vs. Friendship|newspaper=The [[Afro-American (newspaper)|Afro-American]] |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=wyImAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Xf4FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5882,952037}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Olympics-Colliding-Myths&gt;{{cite news |last1=Henry III |first1=William A. |last2=Cazeneuve |first2=Brian |last3=Donnelly |first3=Sally B. |date=19 September 1988|title=Olympics: Colliding Myths After a Dozen Years |newspaper=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,968447,00.html#ixzz0pDG1FkXk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Chmielewski-p151&gt;Chmielewski (1987), p. 151&lt;/ref&gt; Over sixty Friendship Games results would have secured medals at the Olympic Games.&lt;ref name=what-might-have-been /&gt; East Bloc athletes outperformed Olympic winners in 20 of 41 track-and-field events and eleven of 29 swimming events.&lt;ref name=Olympics-Colliding-Myths /&gt; Had [[Li Yuwei]], who won the 1984 Olympic gold medal in [[50 metre running target]] shooting, obtained the same score in the Friendship Games, he would have only placed sixth.&lt;ref name=Chmielewski-p183&gt;Chmielewski (1987), p. 183&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, in events such as weightlifting or wrestling, the Friendship Games had almost all of the top athletes of the time.&lt;ref name=Chmielewski-p151 /&gt; It is also important to mention that Eastern bloc countries had massive state-sposnored doping programs at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/14/sports/olympics/soviet-doping-plan-russia-rio-games.html |title=The Soviet Doping Plan: Document Reveals Illicit Approach to ’84 Olympics |last=Ruiz |first=Rebecca R. |date= 13 August 2016 |newspaper=The New York Times |issn=0362-4331 |access-date=2016-09-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, some journalists noted that making such comparisons was unjustified, because of differing conditions and equipment. For example, [[Marlies Göhr]]'s result of 10.95 in women's 100 metre run was slightly better than [[Evelyn Ashford]]'s winning time of 10.97 at the 1984 Olympics, but when the two met head-to-head a week after the Friendship Games, Ashford was much faster than Göhr and set the new world record.&lt;ref name=Afro-American /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://espn.go.com/moresports/columns/hollobaugh_jeff/57480.html |title=Szabo is in the money ("No. 94" section) |last1=Hollobaugh |first1=Jeff |date=14 September 1998 |publisher=ESPN.com |accessdate=29 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Eastern Bloc results in track cycling were better than Olympic results, but Friendship Games cyclists competed on an indoor wooden track, while the Olympic events took place on an outdoor concrete track.&lt;ref name=what-might-have-been /&gt; "It is like saying [[Carl Lewis]] was faster than [[Jesse Owens]], [[Muhammad Ali]] would have beaten [[Joe Louis]] or [[Secretariat (horse)|Secretariat]] would have outrun [[Man o' War]]", [[Sam Lacy]] of ''[[Afro-American (newspaper)|The Afro-American]]'' concluded.&lt;ref name=Afro-American /&gt;

The comparisons also had political significance. While Friendship Games organizers repeatedly assured the press that their event was not an "alternative Olympics",&lt;ref name=Eastern-bloc-exceed /&gt;&lt;ref name=what-might-have-been /&gt;&lt;ref name=Russians-host&gt;{{cite news |date=12 August 1984|title=Russians Host Their Own '84 Games |newspaper=[[Sarasota Herald-Tribune]] |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=8MYiAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=OmkEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6606,984761}}&lt;/ref&gt; presumably to avoid punitive IOC measures,&lt;ref name=Eastern-bloc-exceed /&gt;&lt;ref name=generic-competition /&gt;&lt;ref name=peace-dominating /&gt; Soviet state-run media often alluded to such comparisons.&lt;ref name=peace-dominating /&gt; The TASS agency declared that the Eastern Bloc's games were a "major event in the Olympic year",&lt;ref name=Moscow-to-stage&gt;{{cite news |date=10 August 1984 |title=Moscow to stage games |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=kZoRAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=fegDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3570,4959807}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the Sovietsky Sport newspaper described the Games as the "main event of the Olympic [[wikt:quadrennium|quadrennium]]".&lt;ref name=Russians-host /&gt; Marat Gramov, head of the Soviet Olympic Committee, said that the "socialist nations remain faithful to the task of strengthening the unity of the Olympics movement",&lt;ref name=Russians-host /&gt; while describing the Los Angeles Games as full of "chauvinism and [[Folie à deux|mass psychosis]]".&lt;ref name=Russians-host /&gt;

When asked about the Friendship Games, Monique Berlioux, then director of the IOC, said she had "no reaction whatsoever" to the competition.&lt;ref name=generic-competition /&gt;

==Aftermath==
In 2006, the [[Law and Justice]] party in Poland proposed granting Friendship Games medalists sports retirement benefits similar to those given to Olympic medalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pis.org.pl/unit.php?o=parlament&amp;p=docs&amp;id=2&amp;iddoc=33 |title=Projekt ustawy o zmianie ustawy o sporcie kwalifikowanym |language=pl |publisher=[[Law and Justice]] party |accessdate=29 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927181640/http://www.pis.org.pl/unit.php?o=parlament&amp;p=docs&amp;id=2&amp;iddoc=33 |archivedate=27 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposal was never voted upon.

{{Refimprove|date=January 2016}}
The '''grandfather rule''', in sports which usually only permit participants to play for the team of their country of birth, is an exception which gives participants the option to play for the country of any of their ancestors up to the grandparents.  Despite common name for the rule, grandparents of either sex can be invoked equally and it is sometimes referred to as the '''grandparent rule''' or the '''granny rule'''.

==Examples==
===Rugby league===
In [[rugby league]], the [[RLIF]] reiterated in 2008 that a player may represent a country if it is their country, or the country of their parents or any of their grandparents' birth.&lt;ref name="SS-31-07-08"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,12196_3890777,00.html |title=World Cup rules spelled out|date=2008-07-31|publisher=Sky Sports|accessdate=6 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rugby union===
In [[rugby union]], regulation 8.1 of [[World Rugby]] stipulates that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.worldrugby.org/handbook/regulations/reg-8/reg-8 |title=Regulation 8: Eligibility to Play for National Representative Teams |work=World Rugby Regulations Relating to the Game |publisher=World Rugby |date=21 April 2016 |accessdate=14 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
a Player may only play for the [Team] (...) of the country with which the Player has a genuine, close, credible and established national link in which:
(a) he was born; or
(b) one parent or grandparent was born; or (...)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The term "grandparent" was at one time defined to include only blood grandparents, even for individuals who were legally adopted. However, World Rugby's current interpretation of its regulations accounts for cases in which a player, or his or her blood parent, was adopted:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.worldrugby.org/handbook/regulations/reg-8/explanatory-guidelines |title=Regulation 8 Explanatory Guidelines |publisher=World Rugby |date=21 April 2016 |accessdate=14 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Unless a Player has been adopted in accordance with the formal, legal requirements of the country concerned, the application of this criterion will be based on a Player’s blood parent. When a Player has been formally adopted in accordance with the applicable legal requirements of the country concerned, the birth place of the Player’s blood parent will no longer be relevant for the purposes of establishing the Player’s eligibility pursuant to Regulation 8.1(b). The relevant parent will be the parent that has formally and legally adopted the Player. In such circumstances, the relevant grandparents for the purposes of establishing a Player’s eligibility pursuant to Regulation 8.1(b) will be the Player’s adoptive rather than blood grandparents. It is not possible under Regulation 8.1(b) to assume eligibility via blood grandparents if a Player has been formally and legally adopted. In the event that one of the Player’s blood parents has been adopted, the relevant grandparents for the purpose of establishing that Player’s eligibility pursuant to Regulation 8.1(b) will be the Player’s blood parent’s adoptive parents. The term “parent” in the Regulations is limited to either a blood parent or a parent that has formally adopted a Player in accordance with the applicable legal requirements of the country concerned.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This exception is also incorporated directly into certain national regulations which govern the club-level teams from that country, as shown by regulation 9.14.2.1 of the [[Irish Rugby Football Union]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://irishrugby.ie/downloads/IRFU_Regulations_.pdf |title=Regulation 9.14.2: Eligibility of Players |work=Regulations of the Irish Rugby Football Union |publisher=Irish Rugby Football Union |date=18 October 2016 |accessdate=14 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The following are the registered players who are eligible to play in the All Ireland League and Cup:
(i) A Player who qualifies to play for Ireland under World Rugby Regulations. (...)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Association football (soccer)===
In [[association football]], this rule can be found at the international level in the statutes of the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), in articles 6 and 7.  The former states:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/generic/01/66/54/21/fifastatutes2012e.pdf|title=FIFA Statutes, July 2012 edition|accessdate=29 March 2013|publisher=''[[FIFA.com]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
if, in addition to having the relevant
nationality, he fulfils at least one of the following conditions:
a) He was born on the territory of the relevant Association;
b) His biological mother or biological father was born on the territory of
the relevant Association;
c) His grandmother or grandfather was born on the territory of the
relevant Association; (...)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Note that unlike World Rugby, which now substitutes adoptive parents for birth parents in determining national team eligibility, FIFA continues to use only biological relations for this purpose.

Among the most notable countries to have availed of the "granny rule" is the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]], where the wide spread of the [[Irish diaspora]] left large numbers of potential recruits, especially in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/sport/soccer/the-granny-rule-we-chart-who-has-come-on-board-who-shunned-us-and-the-undecided-31566207.html|title=The granny rule - We chart who has come on board, who shunned us and the undecided - Independent.ie|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jack Charlton]] (manager 1986–96) was especially noted for recruiting English-born footballers who had Irish ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soccer-ireland.com/irish-football-history/granny-rule.htm|title=Granny Rule in Football : Non Irish Born Footballers for Republic of Ireland : Shay Brennan : Irish Qualified : Jack Chalton|website=www.soccer-ireland.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many German-born players who have Turkish ancestry have chosen to play for [[Turkey national football team|Turkey]]. This is partly due to Germany's strict rules on dual citizenship which forces German-Turks to choose whether to have German or Turkish citizenship by the age of 23 (in accordance with the German Citizenship Law of 1999).

===Basketball===
[[FIBA]], the international governing body for [[basketball]], requires nationality as a precondition for national team selection,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiba.basketball/internal-regulations/book3/players-and-officials.pdf |title=Article 3-15: National Status of Players |work=FIBA Internal Regulations, Book 3: Players and Officials |publisher=FIBA |date=17 June 2018 |accessdate=9 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; but generally does not employ the grandparent rule. The method by which a player obtains citizenship is usually irrelevant to national team eligibility. The only use of the grandparent rule is to determine eligibility to represent the national team of a country's dependent territory, with two notable examples being those of [[Puerto Rico]] and the [[United States Virgin Islands|US Virgin Islands]], both [[United States|US]] [[insular area]]s with their own national federations, and whose native-born residents are US citizens by birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiba.basketball/internal-regulations/book3/players-and-officials.pdf |title=Article 3-26: National Status of Players |work=FIBA Internal Regulations, Book 3: Players and Officials |publisher=FIBA |date=17 June 2018 |accessdate=9 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FIBA, however, has a unique restriction on participation of naturalised players in its official competitions that has no parallel in association football or either rugby code. In FIBA competitions, a national team can have no more than one player on its roster who acquired that country's nationality by any means after reaching age 16. This restriction also applies to individuals who had the right to a second nationality at birth, but did not exercise that right until age 16 or later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiba.basketball/internal-regulations/book3/players-and-officials.pdf |title=Article 3-21: National Status of Players |work=FIBA Internal Regulations, Book 3: Players and Officials |publisher=FIBA |date=17 June 2018 |accessdate=9 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter is relevant to natives of [[Northern Ireland]], who have both [[British nationality law|British citizenship]] and [[Irish nationality law|the right to Irish citizenship]] by birth.

==Effects on teams==
A controversial rule, sports fans often debate whether this rule weakens smaller countries by creating the temptation for the best players to abandon their native country and declare elsewhere in the hopes of greater glory, or if on the contrary it helps smaller countries by giving them access to a broader range of players who wouldn't typically be considered to be picked for their country of birth.

The '''Irwindale Event Center''' (a.k.a. '''Irwindale Speedway'', ''Irwindale Dragstrip'', or "The House of Drift") is a motorsports facility located in [[Irwindale, California]], [[United States]]. It opened on March 27, 1999 under the official name '''Irwindale Speedway.''' [[Toyota]] purchased the [[naming rights]] to the facility in 2008, and from that time until 2011 it was also known as the '''Toyota Speedway at Irwindale'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Keith |last=Lair |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=An optimistic outlook |url=http://www.sgvtribune.com/sports/ci_8608328 |work=San Gabrial Valley Tribune |publisher= |date=March 17, 2008 |accessdate=2008-03-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614004948/http://www.sgvtribune.com/sports/ci_8608328 |archivedate=June 14, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The speedway features banked, paved 1/2- and 1/3-mile oval tracks and a 1/8-mile drag strip. From its opening until 2011 it was primarily used for [[NASCAR]] races such as [[K&amp;N Pro Series West|NASCAR K&amp;N Pro Series West]] and [[Whelen All-American Series]] events. In late 2011, NASCAR announced it was dropping Toyota Speedway from its schedule. The company that manages the track, Irwindale Speedway LLC, filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy on February 13, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Haddock|first=Tim|title=Irwindale group files for bankruptcy|url=http://espn.go.com/los-angeles/story/_/id/7576141/irwindale-speedway-group-files-bankruptcy|work=ESPNLosAngeles.com|publisher=[[ESPN]]|accessdate=February 15, 2012|date=February 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2013, it was announced that the track would be re-opening as the Irwindale Event Center, and would operate as a [[Whelen All-American Series]] venue for the 2013 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/apr/02/sports/la-sp-sn-nascar-irwindale-20130402|title=Irwindale Speedway to again host minor-league NASCAR racing|last=Peltz|first=Jim|date=January 4, 2012|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=2013-01-05|location=Los Angeles, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the past decade, the [[Formula D]] Championship Series has featured sold out events at the venue.

In 2015, plans were made to demolish Irwindale Speedway and build an [[outlet mall]] on the site of the track. As of 2016, the track is still open for business. On August 9, 2017 it was officially announced that Jim Cohan, CEO of Team 211 Entertainment, who operates the track under the name of Irwindale Event Center, would cease operation. &lt;ref&gt;http://speed51.com/irwindale-speedway-announces-final-date-of-operation/&lt;/ref&gt; On December 29, 2017 it was announced that the track would not close in January 2018 as former Irwindale Late Model driver and track champion Tim Huddleston, along with K&amp;N West owner Bob Bruncatti, bought the speedway to have it remain open for another 5 years.

==2003–present==
From 2003 to 2010, the main 1/2-mile oval hosted the NASCAR [[Toyota All-Star Showdown]]. In this event, the top 30 drivers in the NASCAR K&amp;N Pro Series and the top 40 drivers in the NASCAR Whelen All-American Series come from their respective regional tours to compete in a "best-of-the-best" race. The races were televised live on the [[Speed (TV channel)|Speed Channel]]. It was also the home of the [[Turkey Night Grand Prix]] race, a [[Thanksgiving]] [[midget car racing]] tradition in [[southern California]] since 1934, when the race debuted at [[Gilmore Stadium]]. Among the 2005 participants were [[Tony Stewart]], [[Jason Leffler]], and [[J. J. Yeley]]. It was also seen in an episode of ''[[Malcolm in the Middle]]'', titled "Stock Car Races" and also used in the opening scene of the pilot episode of ''[[Fastlane (TV series)|Fastlane]]''.

In 2012, Irwindale Speedway LLC, the management group that ran the track, filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy on the same day track management canceled the 2012 racing season.

In the paperwork filed at the United States Bankruptcy Court, Central District, it shows that Irwindale Speedway LLC owed creditors $331,773.11. The largest amount is $150,000 owed on a personal-injury claim.

Irwindale Speedway LLC owed Nu-Way Industries Inc., the company that owns the property where the track and offices are built, $55,000 in rent.

Irwindale Speedway LLC has two more outstanding personal injury claims with unknown values. There is also a debt of $8,093.51 owed to the city of Irwindale Police Department, $16,379.58 owed to the Golden State Water Company and $1,437.50 owed to the San Gabriel Valley Tribune for advertising.

In late 2012, Jim Cohan, who ran the LA Driving Experience at the track was able to secure funding to re-open the speedway under his management.  The track is back on the NASCAR Home Tracks schedule running a bi-weekly schedule for 2013 and up to the present.

==Lucas Oil California Classic==
In 2010, they hosted the first Lucas Oil California Classic on Thanksgiving weekend.  This was a two-day (Actually 3 due to rain on Saturday night) event for the Spears SRL Southwest Tour, Super Late Models, and Late Models.  They will run 125, 100, and 75 laps respectively, for a $50,000+ purse. However, attendance declined in recent years, with only 900 viewers in the stands at a race prior to closure.

==Drag strip==
The 1/8-mile [[drag racing]] strip opened on September 29, 2001. In 2003, in cooperation with local law enforcement, Irwindale Speedway opened its own dragstrip and hosts legal drag races for street-legal cars, trucks, and motorcycles. The dragstrip is proud to extinguish the "nowhere else to go" excuse used by illegal street racers, and local police often hand out flyers to offenders for free entry into drag races at the dragstrip to promote safe racing and has re-opened.

==The House of Drift==
The venue is also known for [[drifting (motorsport)|drifting]] events; when it hosted [[D1 Grand Prix|D1 Grand Prix's]] first overseas event in {{D1|2003}}, with a sell-out crowd attendance of 10,000, it had surpassed all other events Irwindale hosted in the past, the previous being 8,700. Since then, it has become the series regular opening round in February and a non championship event in December and has also hosted a round of the domestic series, [[Formula D]]. The venue has been expanded to accommodate 15,000 spectators. The circuit is regarded as one of the most popular courses for crowds and drivers despite the unforgiving concrete wall which drivers usually brush through with their rear bumpers. Because of its popularity, the circuit is nicknamed the ''House of Drift''.

==Record==
The 2003 ''[[Guinness World Records|Guinness Book of World Records]]'' lists the fastest-ever top speed of a [[radio-controlled car]] as 111&amp;nbsp;mph (178.63&amp;nbsp;km/h) set by [[Cliff Lett]] of [[Associated Electrics]]. Lett, a Team Associated professional driver and one of the designers and developers of the aforementioned RC10, set the record with a heavily modified [[Associated RC10L|Associated RC10L3]] [[Touring car racing|touring car]] at Irwindale Speedway on January 13, 2001.

==Possible closure and demolition==
In September 2013, the property housing the Irwindale Event Center was purchased by Irwindale Outlet Partners, LLC for $22 million. The lease for the Irwindale Event Center continued on a year-by-year basis. In March 2015, plans were made to demolish Irwindale Speedway and replace it with Irwindale Outlet Center, an [[outlet mall]], but the closure has been delayed. The track is currently running the 2017 season.&lt;ref&gt;October 26, 2016 Jim Cohan, CEO of the Irwindale Event Center has announced they will be scheduling events for the 2017 season.&lt;/ref&gt; On August 9th, 2017, Cohan made an announcement in an e-mailed statement saying that the track was closing down officially in January 2018.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.espn.com/jayski/cup/2017/story/_/id/20303591/irwindale-speedway-close&lt;/ref&gt; However, on December 29, 2017 it was announced that the track would not close in January 2018 as former Irwindale Late Model racer and track champion Tim Huddleston bought the speedway to have it remain open for another 2 years.&lt;ref&gt;

The league's head coaches determine the award by voting and it is usually presented to the honoree during the G League playoffs.&lt;ref name=major&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bakersfield.dleague.nba.com/news/renaldo-major-receives-nba-d-leagues-jason-collier-sportsmanship-award/|title=RENALDO MAJOR RECEIVES NBA D-LEAGUE’S JASON COLLIER SPORTSMANSHIP AWARD|work=NBA.com|date=April 20, 2015|accessdate=April 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The award is named after former G League, Houston Rockets and Atlanta Hawks center [[Jason Collier]], who died on October 15, 2005.

{{Chertsey Lock map}}

'''Laleham Burway''' is a {{convert|1.6|km2|adj=on}} tract of [[water-meadow]] and former [[water-meadow]] between the [[River Thames]] and [[Abbey River]] in the far north of [[Chertsey]] in [[Surrey]]. Its uses are varied. Part is Laleham Golf Club. Part, raised trailer/park homes towards its west, forms residential development; similarly a brief row of houses with private gardens against the Thames. A reservoir and water works is on the island.

From at least the year 1278 its historic bulky northern definition formed part of the dominant estate of [[Laleham]] across the river, its [[manor]], to which it was linked by a ferry until the early 20th century.  Accordingly, as to this section its owner in period from the mid-19th until the early 20th century was the [[Earl of Lucan]]; however when its [[manor house]] was sold to become [[Laleham Abbey]], a short-lived nunnery, its tenants had taken it over or it was sold for public works. The southern greater part of the land commonly marked today as the Burway or Laleham Burway was the '''[[Abbey Mead]]''', kept since the seventh century among many square miles of land and other institutions such as priories, chantries and churches of [[Chertsey Abbey]] until the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]]. 

Part of it was a famous cricket venue in the 18th century and the home of [[Chertsey Cricket Club]].  Where not considered for former land ownership reasons with Abbey Mead (being together a large [[leat|mill-race]] island with a broad [[anabranch|corollary of the river]] beside them), the old definition of Laleham Burway, in 1911, comprised {{convert|200|acres}} which were largely for horse and cow [[pasture]].

==History in cricket==
===Earliest known match, 1736===
A notable feature of the [[1736 English cricket season]] was the rise to prominence of Chertsey Cricket Club, playing games against [[Croydon Cricket Club|Croydon]] and [[London Cricket Club|London]]. It is known that two games were played before July that season. One was Croydon v Chertsey at [[Duppas Hill]] in Croydon; the other in reverse at the Laleham Burway ground in Chertsey.&lt;ref&gt;Announcement in ''Read’s Weekly Journal'' dated Saturday, 3 July, about a deciding game on [[Richmond Green]] to be played on Monday, 5 July.&lt;/ref&gt; In each of the two matches, the home team won "by a great number of runs". The match at Laleham Burway is the first important one that we know to have been played at this venue.
Numerous [[First-class cricket#Important matches classification|important matches]] were played at Laleham Burway during the 18th century. Perhaps the most famous (or infamous) was the one in which [[Monster Bat Incident 1771|Thomas White's huge bat]] caused a furore that led to a change in the [[Laws of Cricket]]. This was the Chertsey v [[Hambledon Club|Hambledon]] game on Monday, 23 and Tuesday, 24 September 1771.

===Last known important match, 1783===
The last important game at the ground may have been Chertsey v Coulsdon in June 1784, but there are doubts about its status.&lt;ref&gt;https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/97/97423.html&lt;/ref&gt; The last definitely known top-class match was therefore [https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/97/97422.html Chertsey v Berkshire] in September 1783.  

===Closure and re-establishment of club elsewhere===
Laleham Burway continued to be used for club cricket into the 19th century records of which have been lost. Its club had "ceased to exist" by 1856&lt;ref name=ccc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chertseycc.org.uk/History/CCC_History.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305215004/http://www.chertseycc.org.uk/History/CCC_History.pdf |archivedate=2009-03-05 |df= }} Minutes of Chertsey Recreation Committee meeting on 4 August 1856&lt;/ref&gt; and its revival began at the Recreation Ground in Chertsey,&lt;ref name=ccc/&gt; followed by its present ground, Grove Road, after the [[First World War]].&lt;ref name=ccc/&gt;

==Early ownership, watermill and agricultural purposes==
The near-triangular bulk of the ground measured as about {{convert|200|acres}} on the right bank of the Thames in 1911 constitutes its narrow, historical definition to distinguish Laleham Burway's at times separate ownership from Abbey Mead.&lt;ref name=vch&gt;"Spelthorne Hundred: Laleham", in ''[[Victoria County History|A History of the County of Middlesex]]: Volume 2'', ed. William Page (London, 1911), pp. 396-401. British History Online http://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/middx/vol2/pp396-401&lt;/ref&gt; This north part of the island later thus marked Laleham Burway (also called the Burway) was divided from the '''Abbey Mead''' of Chertsey by a seasonal ditch, the Burway Ditch, and by another from the meadow of Mixnams on the north.&lt;ref name=vch/&gt; The triangle was equally Chertsey parish, but belonged to the manor of Laleham.&lt;ref name=vch/&gt; It is mentioned as the Island of [[wikt:Burgh|Burgh]] in the original endowment of Chertsey Abbey between 666 and 675, and is described as separated from Mixtenham (or ''Mixnams'') "by water", which formed part of the boundary of the abbey lands, but it is not clear which of the two lay within the bounds of the abbey.&lt;ref name=vch/&gt; Tradition says that the Burway originally belonged to Chertsey, and that in a time of great scarcity and famine the inhabitants of Laleham supplied the abbey with necessaries which those of Chertsey could not, or would not provide, in return for which the abbot granted them the use of this piece of ground. Whatever the truth of this story, it is certain that the [[Abbey of Westminster]] when holding Laleham manor held land on the Surrey side of the river, and that in the time of [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] it held part of the meadow called Mixtenham &amp;mdash; in a dispute with the abbey of Chertsey in 1278, Westminster agreed to release their right in this meadow in return for 4 acres of pasture contiguous with that which they already held.&lt;ref name=vch/&gt; In 1370 they still held some pasture in Mixtenham.&lt;ref name=vch/&gt; 

The Burway is in a grant of Laleham manor during the 18th century.&lt;ref name=vch/&gt; At the beginning of the 19th century it is described as paying no tithes or taxes to either parish.&lt;ref name=vch/&gt; In 1911 it belonged to owners of estates within the manor of Laleham, and the pasture was divided into 300 parts called 'farrens,' the tenancies of which was granted variously to feed horses or to support cow and a half at [[L.S.D.|£1 17s. 6d.]] and £1 5s. annually, respectively.&lt;ref name=vch/&gt; If a farren was sold it was worth about £40.&lt;ref name=vch/&gt; The Burway was not inclosed under the Act of 1773 for inclosing the common fields of Laleham Manor in Chertsey, exempted from the Act of 1808 for inclosing Laleham but inclosed under an Act passed in 1813, when the [[Earl of Lucan]], new lord of the manor, acquired by allotment and purchase about {{convert|70|acres}}.&lt;ref name=vch/&gt;

Laleham Burway (including Abbey Mead, its parent and together forming one main island) is the largest [[river island|island]] of the non-tidal course of the [[River Thames]] in England upstream of the [[Tideway]] &amp;mdash; if disqualifying the villages of [[Dorney]] and [[Eton, Berkshire]] enclosed by the 2002-completed [[Jubilee River]].

'''Lathi khela''' ({{lang-bn|লাঠি খেলা}}) is a traditional Bangladeshi martial art&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Performing the (imagi)nation: A Bangladesh Mise-en-scene | publisher=New York University | author=Khan, Saleque | year=2007 | pages=237 | isbn=9780549099628}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M_BtAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Lathi+khela&amp;dq=Lathi+khela&amp;hl=bn&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=C02LUtvnC8KCrge9hIGwDw&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwBDgK|title=Sylhet: History and Heritage|last=|first=|date=1999-01-01|publisher=[[Bangladesh Itihas Samiti]]|year=|isbn=9789843104786|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; – a kind of [[stick fighting]] practised mainly in [[Bangladesh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=213840|title=Lathi Khela to celebrate Tangail Free Day |publisher=the daily star|location=Tangail|date=13 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A practitioner is known as a ''lathial''.&lt;ref name=bangladesh2day.com&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bangladesh2day.com/newsfinance/2008/December/27/Arts%20&amp;%20Entertainment.php|title='Lathi khela' at Charukala|publisher=bangladesh2day.com|date=27 December 2008|accessdate=9 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word ''lathi'' is the [[Bengali language|Bengali]] word meaning stick, while ''khela'' means a sport or game. Therefore, ''lathi khela'' translates as a game of sticks.&lt;ref name=newagebd.com&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newagebd.com/newspaper1/archive_details.php?date=2012-02-26&amp;nid=51564|title=Three-day cultural fair ended in Barisal|publisher=newagebd.com|date=26 February 2012|accessdate=9 June 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112065557/http://newagebd.com/newspaper1/archive_details.php?date=2012-02-26&amp;nid=51564|archivedate=12 November 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bpedia"&gt;{{cite book 
|last=Islam |first=Sirajul  |year=2012 |chapter=Lathial |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Lathial |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Instruments==
The lathi is normally made of the [[male bamboo]] and sometimes bound at short intervals with iron rings. A typical lathi measures 6 to 8 feet (2 to 2.4 m). Some, called bari, are shorter and may be wielded like a baton or bludgeon. In the past, sticks could be paired with shields, as can still be seen in ''nori bari'' (mock stick-fight) demonstrations.

==History==
Stick fighting has an ancient history in South Asia, tracing back to the region's aboriginal{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}{{Clarify|date=April 2016}} inhabitants. Rich farmers and other eminent people hired ''lathial'' for security and as a symbol of their power. Duels were used as a way to protect or take land and other possessions. A proverb in some South Asian languages is "whoever wields the lathi keeps the cow". [[Zamindar]]s (feudal lords) sent groups of ''lathial'' to forcefully collect taxes from villagers. Lathi training was at one time included in the [[Bratachari movement|Bratachari]] system of education.&lt;ref name="prothom-alo"&gt;''[http://www.prothom-alo.com/art_and_literature/article/33350/%E0%A6%88%E0%A6%A6_%E0%A6%89%E0%A7%8E%E0%A6%B8%E0%A6%AC%E0%A7%87%E0%A6%B0_%E0%A6%A8%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%A8%E0%A6%BE_%E0%A6%B0%E0%A6%82 ঈদ উৎসবের নানা রং]'',সাইমন জাকারিয়া, দৈনিক প্রথম আলো। ঢাকা থেকে প্রকাশের তারিখ: আগস্ট ০২, ২০১৩&lt;/ref&gt;

Although lathi is practised in Indian and Bangladeshi villages, urbanization has led to its decline as a rural [[martial art]] in recent decades. Until 1989, an annual nationwide lathi khela convention was held in Kushtia, Bangladesh, where troupes from all over the country took part.&lt;ref name="bangladesh2day.com"/&gt; Due to the drop in practitioners and spectators, the convention is now held once every three years. Even in the districts where lathi troupes once flourished, only several now remain. Today, lathi khela is most often seen during festivals and weddings.&lt;ref name=dhakamirror.com&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dhakamirror.com/nation/lathi-khela-to-celebrate-tangail-free-day/|title=Lathi Khela to celebrate Tangail Free Day|publisher=dhakamirror.com|date=13 December 2011|accessdate=9 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Matches are held in [[West Bengal]] for certain puja rituals, and a similar sport called ''chamdi'' is played during Eid in North Bengal.

==Practice==
Lathial group performed acts like Baoi Jhak (group fight), Nori Bari (mock fight with sticks), Fala Khela and Dao Khela (mock fight with sharp weapons) and Chhuri dance to music, in the presence of hundreds. These groups may learn the arts of ''dao khela'' (knife fighting) and ''fara khela'' (sword fighting), both of which are preserved today in the form of mock-fights. Matches are generally one-on-one, but the art includes mock-group fights or ''baoi jhak''. In lathi the centre of energy is the heart [[chakra]], and practitioners fight in a more upright position.&lt;ref name="prothom-alo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dhakamirror.com"/&gt;

==Present day==
The popularity of lathi khela is waning. Practice of this art form throughout the country can increase its popularity and ensure its continued existence.&lt;ref name=thekushtiatimes.com&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thekushtiatimes.com/13/12/2010/two-day-long-traditional-lathi-khela-ended-in-kushtia/|title=Two-day long traditional Lathi Khela ended in Kushtia|publisher=thekushtiatimes.com|date=13 December 2010|accessdate=9 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''own goal''' is an event in competitive goal-scoring sports (such as [[association football]] or [[hockey]]) where a player scores on their own side of the playing area rather than the one defended by the opponent. Own goals sometimes result from the opponent's defensive strength, as when the player is stopped in the scoring area,{{Clarification needed|reason=Whose scoring area, his own or the opponent's? What does this have to do with the opponent's defensive strength?|date=December 2017}} but can also happen by accident. Since own goals are often added to the opponent's score, they are often an embarrassing blunder for the scoring player, but in certain sports are occasionally done for strategic reasons. 

In some parts of the world, the term has become a [[metaphor]] for ''any'' action that backfires on the person/group undertaking it, sometimes even carrying a sense of "[[poetic justice]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/own+goal |title=thefreedictionary.com |publisher=thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A player trying to [[Match fixing|throw a game]] might deliberately attempt an own goal.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eurosport.com/football/teams-kicked-out-of-league-after-farcical-own-goal-match_sto4714595/story.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; Such players run the risk of being sanctioned or banned from further play.

==Association football==
In [[association football]], an own goal occurs when a player causes the ball to go into his or her own team's [[Goal (sport)|goal]], resulting in a [[Scoring in association football|goal being scored]] for the opposition. Defenders often "turn behind" dangerous balls into the penalty area, particularly crosses, by kicking or heading the ball out of play behind their goal-line.  In this way, the defender's aim is to concede a [[corner kick|corner]] rather than giving attacking players scoring opportunities.  Consequently, the defender may misjudge and inadvertently turn the ball into his own goal, particularly if he is under pressure from attacking players who might otherwise score. The defending player who scored the own goal is personally "credited" with the goal as part of the statistical abstract of the game. The credit is annotated "(og)" to indicate its nature.

The [[Laws of the Game (association football)|Laws of the Game]] stipulate that an own goal cannot be scored directly from most methods of restarting the game; instead, a [[corner kick]] is awarded to the attacking team. This is the case for the [[Kick-off (association football)|kick-off]],&lt;ref&gt;LOTG 8.1&lt;/ref&gt; [[goal kick]],{{#tag:ref|A corner is awarded provided the ball left the penalty area before entering the goal; otherwise the goal kick is retaken.&lt;ref&gt;LOTG 16&lt;/ref&gt;|group="nb"}}&lt;ref group="nb" name="explicitly2016"/&gt; [[dropped-ball]] (since 2012)&lt;ref&gt;LOTG 8.2; [https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/administration/01/64/44/22/circularno.1302-amendmentstothelawsofthegame-2012_2013.pdf#page=3 FIFA Circular 1302 p.3]&lt;/ref&gt;, [[throw-in]],&lt;ref&gt;LOTG 15&lt;/ref&gt; corner kick,{{#tag:ref|This was explicitly added to the Laws of the Game in 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sbnation.com/soccer/2016/4/14/11429756/the-rules-of-soccer-are-changing-you-cant-score-an-own-goal-from-a?_ga=2.164167996.284906813.1502803412-329242256.1441989457|title=The rules of soccer are changing!

The Laws do not stipulate any rules or procedures for crediting goals to players, and indeed such records are not a compulsory part of the game.&lt;ref name="Cooper1997"&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.fifa.com/news/y=1997/m=4/news=when-own-goals-don-really-count-71928.html|title=When Own Goals Don't Really Count|last=Cooper|first=Keith|others=illustrated by Olé Andersen|date=17 April 1997|journal=FIFA Magazine|accessdate=16 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997 FIFA issued detailed guidelines for crediting own goals, recognising the increasing commercial importance of statistics such as [[:Category:Lists of association football top scorers|top scorer awards]] and [[Fantasy football (association)|fantasy football]].&lt;ref name="Cooper1997" /&gt; The guidelines state that credit for scoring is decided by the referee, or match commissioner if present; and "[a] defender's intervention must be deliberate in order for an own goal to be registered against him".&lt;ref name="Cooper1997" /&gt; Regarding a shot which deflects or ricochets into the goal off a defender, some sources credit the score to the attacker; others count them as own goals; for others it depends on whether the original shot was off target; others are more nuanced.&lt;ref name="Cooper1997" /&gt; There was controversy in 2013 when the [[FA Premier League]] credited [[Tim Howard]] with an own goal when a shot came off the post, hit him in the back, and went in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.si.com/soccer/planet-futbol/2013/10/05/tim-howard-own-goal-manchester-city |title=Did Tim Howard deserve an own goal against Manchester City? |first=Alexander |last=Abnos |date=5 October 2013 |work=SI.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Major competitions may have video reviews which can alter the accreditation, such as the [[Dubious Goals Committee]] of the FA Premier League. In the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]], one of [[Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)|Ronaldo]]'s eight goals in winning the [[World Cup Golden Boot|Golden Boot]] was initially credited as an own goal but reassigned on appeal by Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-soccer-latam-ronaldo-profile-idUKTRE71D45U20110214|title=Eye for goal made Ronaldo a striker to be feared|last=Homewood|first=Brian|editor-first=Justin |editor-last=Palmer|date=14 February 2011|publisher=[[Reuters]]|accessdate=17 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; UEFA's review procedure was formalised in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.espnfc.com/story/520409/uefa-to-clarify-rules-on-deflected-own-goals |date=27 March 2008 |author=Reuters |work=ESPN |title=UEFA to clarify rules on deflected own goals }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2006}}, the [[English Football League]] allowed the club which scored to nominate the scorer, which ''[[The Guardian]]'' criticised with an example from 2002: "every single national newspaper, agency and football factbook agreed that [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]] defender [[Calum Davenport]] had scored an own goal against [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]]. The Clarets, however, gave the goal to [[Gareth Taylor]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2006/aug/23/theknowledge.sport|title=The Knowledge: Is there really a Dubious Goals Committee?|last1=Ingle|first1=Sean|last2=Glendenning |first2=Barry |last3=Dart|first3=James |date=23 August 2006|work=[[TheGuardian.com]]|accessdate=21 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most infamous own goal was by [[Andrés Escobar]] of [[Colombia national football team|Colombia]] in the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]] which lost [[United States v Colombia (1994 FIFA World Cup)|the match]] against the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]] and knocked Colombia out; a week later, Escobar was shot dead in Colombia by a drug gang member whose boss had lost betting on the match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asktheref.com/Soccer%20Rules/Question/21754/|title=Question 21754: Law 10 - Method of Scoring|date=7 August 2009|accessdate=16 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ice hockey==
If a [[goal (hockey)|goal]] is scored by a player on the defending team, credit for the goal goes to the last player on the other team to have touched the [[hockey puck|puck]]; this is because own goals in hockey are typically cases where the player so credited had the shot deflected, but this convention is used even where this is not the case. Occasionally, it is also credited to the closest player to the goal from the other team if he is determined to have caused the opposing player to shoot it into the wrong net. Assists are not awarded on an own goal because the defending team has possession of the puck between any pass and the goal itself. Occasionally in the [[National Hockey League|NHL]], players have directed the puck into their own [[empty net]], either late in the game or because of a [[delayed penalty call]]. This was the situation which resulted in [[Billy Smith (ice hockey)|Billy Smith]] of the [[New York Islanders]] becoming the first [[goaltender]] to receive credit for a goal in the [[National Hockey League|NHL]]. In some parts of [[Canada]], an own goal is referred to as a [[Glossary of ice hockey terms|limoges]]. The term is believed to have originated in [[New Brunswick]] (approximately 1970) and became more common in the greater [[Toronto]] region starting in the 1990s{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}.

==Field hockey==
Treatment of "own goals" in field hockey has varied over recent years. In 2013 the [[International Hockey Federation]] (FIH) implemented a "mandatory experiment" such that a deflection of a shot from outside the shooting circle from a defender would be equivalent to a touch from an attacker, and thus if the shot continued into the goal the score would be counted. This proved unpopular and the change was reversed.&lt;ref name="FIH-withdraw"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bone|first1=Ross|title=Talking Hockey: own goal rule wiped out creativity, though umpires likely to disagree|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/olympics/hockey/10477968/Talking-Hockey-own-goal-rule-wiped-out-creativity-though-umpires-likely-to-disagree.html|accessdate=15 August 2016|work=Telegraph|date=27 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Presently rule 8.1 states that ''"A goal is scored when the ball is played within the circle by an attacker and does not travel outside the circle before passing completely over the goal-line and under the crossbar."'' Added clarification: ''"The ball may be played by a defender or touch their body before or after being played in the circle by an attacker."''&lt;ref name="FIH_rules"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rules of Hockey|url=http://www.fih.ch/media/8997802/rules-of-hockey-2015.pdf|publisher=FIH|accessdate=15 August 2016|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, an "own goal" may occur, but in such situations the goal will likely be credited to the attacker whose initial play into the circle was necessary for the goal to stand.

==Basketball==
When accidentally scoring at an opposing team's basket (basketball's equivalent of an "own goal"), the goal is credited to an offensive player. One typical own-goal scenario occurs when a player tries to block a goal shot but ends up knocking the ball into the goal.

In [[National Federation of State High School Associations|NFHS]] basketball, the two points are merely listed for the scoring team, as a footnote.

In [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] basketball, the rules state: "When a player scores a field goal in the opponent’s basket, it shall count two points for the opponent regardless of the location on the playing court from where it was released. Such a field goal shall not be credited to a player in the scorebook but shall be indicated with a footnote."

In [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] rules, the goal is credited to the player on the scoring team who is closest to defensive shooter and is mentioned in a footnote.

Under [[FIBA]] rules, the player designated captain is credited with the basket.

==American football==
When a ball carrier is tackled or exits the field of play within the end zone being defended by his team, the result is a [[Safety (American football score)|safety]] and the opposing team is awarded two points, and receives the ball after a free kick taken at the twenty-yard line. (This does not apply if the ball carrier secures possession of the ball in the end zone as a result of an interception or a kick; in that case, no points are awarded and the play is considered a [[touchback]].) In Canadian football, if a scrimmage kick (punt or missed field goal attempt) is kicked into the end zone and the opponent does not advance it out, the kicking team is awarded a [[Single (Canadian football)|single]], worth one point.

A true "own goal", in which the team place kicks or drop kicks the ball through their own goal posts (which has never happened at any level in football history and would require either a very strong headwind or a deliberate act of sabotage), is treated as any other backward kick in most leagues' rule books. Backward kicks are treated as [[fumble]]s, and as such, a backward kick through the back of the end zone, including through the goal posts, is scored as a safety. This occurred in a 2012 game between two Texas high schools; a punter kicked against a strong wind that blew the ball backward into the end zone, where the defense took control of it.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Cameron (16 Oct. 2012) "[https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/highschool-prep-rally/texas-wind-knocks-punt-back-incredibly-unlikely-safety-151900255.html Texas wind knocks punt back for incredibly unlikely safety]"&lt;/ref&gt;

In the final minutes of a game, a team may take a deliberate safety in order to get the free kick, rather than punting from the end zone. In 2003, the [[New England Patriots]] came back to win a game after giving a safety that put them three points behind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/wire?id=1653659 |title=Belichick's gamble pays off for Patriots - NFL - ESPN |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=2003-11-04 |accessdate=2013-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the [[Baltimore Ravens]] took a safety with twelve seconds left in [[Super Bowl XLVII]] instead of punting out of the end zone, cutting their lead to three points but winning the game since they were able to burn eight seconds off the clock with the safety play, and the opposing [[San Francisco 49ers]] were unable to score on the ensuing free kick.

==Canadian football==

In the [[2017 Grey Cup]], the [[Calgary Stampeders]] deliberately took a safety when their punter [[Rob Maver]], having lost control of a high snap, was faced with loss of down deep in his own territory.  He intentionally kicked the ball backwards through the back of his own end zone for a safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ottawacitizen.com/sports/football/argonauts-slay-mighty-stampeders-in-snowy-epic-grey-cup/wcm/cbf1448f-638d-49d3-aa91-17a64e848367|title=Argonauts slay mighty Stampeders in epic, snowy Grey Cup|last=Baines|first=Tim|date=26 November 2017|publisher=[[Ottawa Citizen]]|accessdate=26 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gaelic football==
[[Gaelic football]]ers can play the ball with their hands; therefore, they have a much greater degree of control over the ball and thus, own goals are much rarer than they are in association football. They do occur, and two were scored by [[Mayo GAA|Mayo]] in the [[2016 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final#Match 1|drawn 2016 All-Ireland SFC Final]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.rte.ie/sport/gaa/2016/0918/817360-all-ireland-final-updates-dublin-v-mayo/|title=Recap: How the All-Ireland football final unfolded|date=18 September 2016|work=[[RTÉ.ie]]|accessdate=15 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As an own goal is scored when the ball goes under the crossbar, so an "own point" is scored (like any other point) when the ball goes over the crossbar. However, when a shot on goal is deflected over the bar by the defending team, the point is credited to the attacker who shot and not considered an "own point".

==Australian rules football==
{{main|Rushed behind}}
As a legitimate defensive play, an Australian rules football defender may concede an "own score". Such a score, referred to as a ''rushed behind'' and statistically credited to no player (score sheets simply include the tally of rushed behinds), results in the opposition team scoring one point. A defending player may choose to concede a rushed behind when the risk of the opposition scoring a goal (worth six points) is high. It is impossible for a team to concede an own goal worth six points.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3955">'''Spot reduction''' refers to the claim that [[adipose tissue|fat]] can be targeted for reduction from a specific area of the body through [[physical exercise|exercise]] of specific [[muscle]]s in the desired area, such as exercising the [[Human abdomen#Muscles a of the abdominal wall|abdominal muscles]] in an effort to lose weight in or around one's midsection.

'''Springfield Park''' was a [[multi-purpose stadium]] in [[Wigan]], [[Greater Manchester]]. It was the home ground of [[Wigan Athletic F.C.]] until the club moved to the new [[JJB Stadium]] (now DW Stadium) after the 1998–99 season. At its largest, the stadium held 40,000.  In its 102-year existence the ground only saw 32 years as a Football League venue, 11 years for [[Wigan Borough F.C.]] and 21 years for Wigan Athletic FC, before it was demolished to make way for a housing estate in 1999.

The stadium had previously been home to [[Wigan County F.C.|Wigan County]], [[Wigan United A.F.C.|Wigan United]], [[Wigan Town A.F.C|Wigan Town]], and [[Wigan Borough]] (previously Wigan United and Wigan Association) as well as [[Wigan Warriors|Wigan]] and [[Blackpool Borough|Springfield Borough]] rugby league sides. It was also used for [[Harness racing|horse trotting]], as a track cycling [[velodrome]], for wrestling and for athletics.

Springfield Park was designed by architect Richardson Thomas Johnson and built in 1897 at a cost of £16,000. It was owned by The Wigan Trotting and Athletic Grounds Company Ltd. The first professional football match at the stadium took place in September 1897 when Wigan County played Burton Swifts in a friendly match.&lt;ref&gt;Wigan Athletic AFC - An A–Z, [[Dean Hayes]]. {{ISBN|1-874181-16-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Association Football==

===History===
Wigan County were the first team to play at Springfield Park. Their greatest event was a 1–0 loss at the hands of [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] before their liquidation and extinction three years after their 1897 formation. [[Wigan United A.F.C.|Wigan United]]  took the lease at Springfield Park in 1901, competing for two seasons in the Lancashire League. After being drawn away to [[Stalybridge Rovers F.C.|Stalybridge Rovers]] in the third round of the Rawcliffe Cup, they declined to play due to a waterlogged pitch. However, the referee ruled otherwise, leaving Stalybridge to kick off, dribble and place the ball into the net.&lt;ref&gt;Wigan Athletic AFC - An A–Z, [[Dean Hayes]]. {{ISBN|1-874181-16-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Wigan Town A.F.C.|Wigan Town]] would be the third attempt to establish football in Wigan in 1905, but it too would fail to survive for more than three years.

After a period of inactivity at Springfield Park due to the First World War, [[Wigan United A.F.C.|Wigan United]] beat Fleetwood 2–0 on 6 September 1919 in the West Lancs League. This was the first official game after the war and would lead to the club taking the lease for the ground on 2 December 1919 for the rest of the season. United eventually became [[Wigan Borough F.C.]] in 1920 and became one of the founder members of the [[Football League Third Division North]]. They won their first game, against Nelson, 2–1 in front of 9,000 spectators. The club's best performance was in 1928–29 when they reached the Third round of the [[FA Cup]]. This was to be the largest attendance ever recorded at Springfield Park, with 30,443 spectators watching a 3–1 loss to [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]].

Wigan Borough resigned from the football league during the [[1931-32 in English football|1931–32]] season. Shortly after Borough went out of business, a new club, [[Wigan Athletic F.C.]], was formed and continued to play their home games at Springfield Park. After lengthy negotiations, Wigan Athletic purchased the ground from the owner of [[Woodhouse Lane Stadium]] for £2,800 with the proviso that greyhound racing never take place at Springfield Park.&lt;ref&gt;Wigan Athletic AFC - An A–Z, [[Dean Hayes]]. {{ISBN|1-874181-16-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1952–53 season, the main stand was razed to the ground by fire, resulting in major fundraising efforts for the construction of a new stand. The following season, a record crowd of 27,526 watched Wigan Athletic beat [[Hereford United]] 4–1. To this day, it is the largest attendance ever recorded between two non-league clubs excluding Wembley finals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wafc.co.uk/honours/index.htm WAFC.co.uk - club honours]&lt;/ref&gt;

19 October 1966 marked the first floodlit match at Springfield Park, when Wigan Athletic played Crewe Alexandra. This was a full year before floodlights were installed at [[Central Park (Wigan)|Central Park]].

In October 1978, [[Zambia national football team|Zambia]] –coached by [[Brian Tiler]], himself an ex-Latics manager– became the first national team to play at Springfield Park. Wigan won the game 2–1.

[[Wigan Athletic F.C.]] moved to the new [[JJB Stadium]] after the 1999 season. The final competitive goal to be scored at the stadium was by Manchester City's [[Paul Dickov]].

'''St Julian's Road''' is a former [[Association football|football]] [[stadium]] in [[Omagh]], [[Northern Ireland]]. It was the home ground of [[Omagh Town F.C.|Omagh Town]] until the dissolution of the club in June 2005. The ground, which featured a grass pitch, had a capacity of 5000, made up of thirty 30 VIP places, 250 covered seats, 4720 standing places (3220 covered and 1500 uncovered).&lt;ref name="world"&gt;[http://www.worldstadia.com/stadium/northern%20ireland/st_julians_road/1278.php?PHPSESSID=f78b5e30907e937c1367d27c973179d6 Details for St Julians Road, Omagh]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Town first leased the Mullaghmore site, which had previously served as a rubbish tip, from [[Omagh District Council]] in 1987, with the stadium opening three years later.&lt;ref name="world"/&gt; As well as football the ground has also hosted [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] events.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gaaboard.com/board/index.php?topic=7799.55;wap2 Still no place for gaelic games in NI state school sector]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Charity matches==
Among the clubs to play at St. Julian's Road were [[Manchester United]], who faced Omagh Town in a friendly game there in 1999 in order to raise money for the [[Omagh bombing]] appeal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4161/is_19990613/ai_n14488442/ Manchester United set for match at Omagh]&lt;/ref&gt; The match ended in a 9-0 win to the visitors with [[Teddy Sheringham]] netting four times.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sportinglife.com/football/premiership/manu/reports/story_get.cgi?STORY_NAME=soccer/99/08/03/SOCCER_Man_Utd.html&amp;TEAMHD=manu&amp;DIV=prem&amp;TEAM=MANCHESTER--UNITED&amp;RH=Manchester--United&amp;PREV_SEASON=1998&amp;BID= Omagh Town 0 Manchester United 9]&lt;/ref&gt; Both [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] and [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] also faced the home side at St Julian's Road as part of the same charity initiative.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/FOOTBALL%3A+HOULLIER+CHOOSES+FROM+A+FULL-STRENGTH+POOL%3B+Omagh+Town+v...-a060332757 FOOTBALL: HOULLIER CHOOSES FROM A FULL-STRENGTH POOL; Omagh Town v Liverpool]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current use==
Following the collapse of the football club, the stadium fell into disuse although in January 2010, Sean Begley, a [[Sinn Féin]] councillor, brought a proposal before the Council to revive St Julian's Road as a football venue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.westtyronesinnfein.com/news/15621 Proposal to redevelop St Julian's Road ground to go before council]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stade Louis II''' was a multi-use [[stadium]] in [[Fontvieille, Monaco|Fontvieille]], [[Monaco]]. It was initially used as the stadium of [[AS Monaco FC]] matches. It was rebuilt and replaced by a new [[Stade Louis II]] in 1985. The capacity of the stadium was 12,000 spectators.

In 1936, [[Prince Louis II of Monaco]] awarded [[Jean-Baptiste Pastor]] and his company [[J.B. Pastor &amp; Fils]], the commission to build the country's first football stadium.&lt;ref name=Telegraph&gt;{{cite news|title=Hélène Pastor- obituary|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/10849904/Helene-Pastor-obituary.html|accessdate=16 January 2015|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=22 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was finished in 1939.

'''The Great Match''' is the name given to a [[match race]] between two of the most famous British [[thoroughbred]] [[racehorse]]s of the 19th Century - [[Voltigeur (horse)|Voltigeur]] and [[The Flying Dutchman (horse)|The Flying Dutchman]].  The race took place at [[York Racecourse|York]] on 31 May 1851 for a purse of 1,000 sovereigns.

==Background==

The Flying Dutchman was a five-year-old, who had won the 1849 [[Epsom Derby]] and [[St. Leger Stakes|St Leger]] and, as a four-year-old, the 1850 [[Ascot Gold Cup]].  So dominant had he been that the whip had only been raised on him once, during his Derby victory.

Voltigeur was a year younger, and in 1850 had followed in The Flying Dutchman's hoof prints by taking both [[Epsom Derby|The Derby]] and [[St. Leger Stakes|St Leger]] (in a rematch after an initial [[Tie (draw)|dead heat]]).  In winning the Derby, he had posted a time ten seconds faster than that of The Flying Dutchman the year previously.&lt;ref name=TBH&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tbheritage.com/Portraits/Voltigeur.html| last=Martiniak| first=Elizabeth| title=Voltigeur |publisher=Thoroughbred Heritage |accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two days after Voltigeur's St Leger victory, the two horses met for the first time in the [[Doncaster Cup]].  The younger horse was in receipt of 19 pounds from his rival&lt;ref name=NHM&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.nhrm.co.uk/index.php/match-races/ |title=Match Races |publisher=National Horseracing Museum |accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as a result, the previously unbeaten Flying Dutchman went down to a half length defeat, although in some ways the victory was deemed unsatisfactory.  Rumours abounded that the Flying Dutchman's [[jockey]], [[Charles Marlow (jockey)|Charles Marlow]], was the worse for drink&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=NENZC18510301.2.8&amp;srpos=3&amp;e=01-01-1848-31-12-1851--10--1----2the+flying+dutchman-- |title=DONCASTER RACES |publisher=Nelson Examiner and New Zealand Chronicle |date=1 March 1851 |accessdate=2012-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and consequently ignored instructions to wait on the colt, declaring "I'll show you what I've got under me today!" and setting a ridiculously fast pace.&lt;ref name="Mortimer"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Mortimer | first1 = Roger |last2=Onslow|first2=Richard|last3=Willett|first3=Peter| title = Biographical Encyclopedia of British Flat Racing| publisher=Macdonald and Jane’s | year = 1978| isbn = 0-354-08536-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was subsequently agreed that the two would meet again the following spring for a purse of 2,000 guineas, with each owner putting up half the stake.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=DSC18740627.2.23&amp;srpos=32&amp;e=01-01-1874-31-12-1874--10--31----0Voltigeur-- |title=ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS |publisher=Daily Southern Cross |date=27 June 1874 |accessdate=2012-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Race==

The famous handicapper [[Henry John Rous]] set the weights for the second match, giving The Flying Dutchman a weight of 120½ pounds to Voltigeur's 112.

The race between the two Yorkshire horses proved extremely popular, drawing a crowd of between 100,000 &lt;ref name="autogenerated3" /&gt; and 150,000, an all-time record for York.&lt;ref name=facts&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.yorkracecourse.co.uk/about-york-racecourse/10-things-you-didnt-know-about-us| title=10 things you didn't know about us| publisher=York Racecourse| accessdate=11 April 2013| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130728230324/http://yorkracecourse.co.uk/about-york-racecourse/10-things-you-didnt-know-about-us| archivedate=28 July 2013| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some even walked from as far afield as [[Richmond, North Yorkshire]] to be there.&lt;ref name=TBH /&gt;

Even the horses' exercise gallops attracted large crowds of fans attempting to assess their relative condition.

Unlike their previous meeting, The Flying Dutchman was successfully restrained in the early stages as Voltigeur, under [[Nat Flatman]], made the running. In the final furlong the Flying Dutchman moved up level with his rival and then pulled ahead to win by a length.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=NENZC18511101.2.9&amp;srpos=4&amp;e=01-01-1848-31-12-1851--10--1----2the+flying+dutchman-- |title=Papers Past — Nelson Examiner and New Zealand Chronicle — 1 November 1851 — SPORTING |publisher=Paperspast.natlib.govt.nz |date= |accessdate=2012-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==

The event was immortalised in paintings by [[Harry Hall (painter)|Harry Hall]], first exhibited in Buchanan Street, [[Glasgow]] later that year,&lt;ref name=herald&gt;{{cite news |title=The Flying Dutchman and Voltigeur |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&amp;dat=18510912&amp;id=_khEAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=yrEMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4667,6364963|format= |work=[[Glasgow Herald]] |location=[[Glasgow]] |date=12 September 1851 |accessdate=11 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John F. Herring]], whose work became so famous there was scarcely a village in the [[British Empire]] without a copy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=GRA18740608.2.13&amp;srpos=2&amp;e=01-01-1874-31-12-1874--10--1----0Voltigeur-- |title=SPORTING NOTES |publisher=Grey River Argus |date= 8 June 1874|accessdate=2012-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As for the horses, The Flying Dutchman was retired to [[Stud farm|stud]] after the race.  Voltigeur, on the other hand, carried on racing.  The very day after the match race, he went down to defeat in the Ainsty Hunt Cup, conceding 37 pounds to a classy filly named Nancy.&lt;ref name=TBH /&gt;

The next season, when he was five, he won the race named in honour of his old rival, The Flying Dutchman Handicap, run at York, before finishing unplaced in his final three racecourse appearances, including the Ascot Gold Cup, and then retiring to stud himself.&lt;ref name=TBH /&gt;

In ''[[Top Gear (current format)|Top Gear]]'', a [[BBC]] motoring show, one of the show's regular features since 2002 is various forms of [[racing]] the presenters undertake, either against each other or against invited guests. The show has featured a number of epic races, where one of the presenters — [[Jeremy Clarkson]], [[Richard Hammond]], [[James May]], and occasionally [[The Stig]] — drives a car in a race against the others in another form of transport. These races typically involve Clarkson driving the car while Hammond and May take the same journey by combinations of plane, train, or ferry. May has said that the races are planned to be as close as possible.&lt;ref&gt;Top Gear, Series 11 Episode 4 1:01:13&lt;/ref&gt; Of the long distance races so far, the car has won the vast majority of the races, with the exceptions of the cross-London epic, in which the car was beaten by a bicycle, a boat on the [[Thames]] and public transport; Ferrari Daytona vs. Powerboat, in which the boat won and Shelby Mustang GT500 vs. High Speed Train, in which the train won.

==Races==

==={{anchor|s4e1}} Aston Martin DB9 vs. French TGV - Distance 900 miles===
''Series Four, Episode One''

Clarkson drove an [[Aston Martin DB9]] from [[Dunsfold|the Dunsfold studio in Surrey]] to [[Monte Carlo]], against Hammond and May who took the [[Eurostar]] and the French [[TGV]]. Hammond and May walked two miles to a bus stop, took a bus to [[Guildford (Surrey) railway station|Guildford railway station]], and went on a train to [[London Waterloo station|London Waterloo]]. From there they took the Eurostar to [[Gare du Nord]], the [[Réseau Express Régional|RER]] to [[Gare de Lyon]], the French [[TGV]] to [[Nice]], then another train to Monte Carlo. During the race, May compared the contest to the earlier [[Blue Train Races]], won by a [[Rover Light Six]] and [[Bentley Speed Six]] against ''[[Le Train Bleu]]'' or The Blue Train. '''''Winner: Car'''''

==={{anchor|s5e8}} Ferrari 612 Scaglietti vs. Passenger Jet - Distance 650 miles===
''Series Five, Episode Eight''

Clarkson tried to beat Hammond and May in a race from [[Dunsfold|the Dunsfold studio in Surrey]] to [[Verbier]], Switzerland. Clarkson drove a [[Ferrari 612 Scaglietti]]. Hammond and May got a bus to Guildford, took a train to [[Woking railway station|Woking]], got a [[RailAir]] coach to [[London Heathrow Airport|Heathrow]], and a plane to [[Geneva]]. After landing, Hammond and May took the train to [[Martigny]] and La Chable before getting on a coach to Verbier. This proved to be the closest ''Top Gear'' race so far, as Clarkson overtook Hammond and May on the main street of Verbier. '''''Winner: Car'''''

'''DVD Release''': This race was released as part of the ''Top Gear: The Races'' DVD, albeit in a truncated form, with a running time of 10 minutes. It was a never included in a commercial release.

==={{anchor|s6e6}} Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren vs. Cruise Ferry - Distance 1320 miles===
''Series Six, Episode Six''

Hammond and May raced Clarkson (in a [[Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren]]) from Heathrow airport to [[Oslo]], Norway. May and Hammond flew to [[Newcastle-upon-Tyne|Newcastle]], then took the ferry across the [[North Sea]] to [[Kristiansand]], Norway and used a speedboat to get to Oslo. Clarkson, in the McLaren Mercedes, had to drive over 1,300 miles (about 2,100&amp;nbsp;km) through the UK, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Denmark (stopping to rest overnight), Sweden, and Norway. On the way from Kristiansand to Oslo, aspiring to their first epic race win, the engine on Hammond and May's speedboat burnt out while the back-up chase boat's hull was damaged—all while Hammond was getting seasick over the side of the boat—severely spoiling their lead. They had to land in an unknown town ([[Stavern]], in [[Larvik]]), taking nearly a day to find a bus and get to the destination—leaving Clarkson to win the race, fly back to England, get home, and be halfway through supper before Hammond and May arrived at the destination. '''''Winner: Car'''''

'''DVD Release''': This race was released as part of the ''Top Gear: The Races'' DVD, albeit in a truncated form, with a running time of 12 minutes. It was a never included in a commercial release.

==={{anchor|s7e5}} Bugatti Veyron vs. Cessna 182 - Distance 813 miles===
''Series Seven, Episode Five''

Clarkson (in a [[Bugatti Veyron]]) raced Hammond and May (in a [[Cessna 182]]) from [[Alba (CN)|Alba]] to [[Tower 42]] in London to deliver a truffle. Hammond and May rode scooters to the local airport, and planned to fly directly to London, but had to fly via the [[French Riviera]] since the aircraft was not equipped to fly over mountains above 10,000&amp;nbsp;feet—in this case, the Swiss Alps. While catching up to Clarkson, May had to land in [[Lille]], as he was not licensed to fly at night. From Lille, May &amp; Hammond took the [[Eurostar]] to London, and then a bus for the final leg of the journey. '''''Winner: Car'''''

'''DVD Release''': This race was released as part of the ''Top Gear: The Challenges 1'' DVD. A much shorter version was included on the ''Top Gear: The Races'' DVD.

==={{anchor|s9e8}} Polar Race - Toyota Hilux vs. Dog Sled - Distance Approx. 400 miles===
''Series Nine, Episode Seven.''
{{Main|Top Gear: Polar Special}}
Clarkson and May drove a modified [[Toyota Hilux]] against Hammond, [[Matty McNair]] and a dog sled team in a race across the Canadian arctic. Clarkson and May won the race, and became part of the first successful attempt to drive a motor vehicle to the [[North Magnetic Pole]]. '''''Winner: Car'''''

'''DVD Release''': A director's cut of this race was released on Blu-ray. The televised version was released as part of the ''Top Gear: The Great Adventures 1'' DVD box set.

==={{anchor|s10e5}} London Race - Car vs. Bicycle vs. Boat vs. Public Transport - Distance 17 miles===
''Series Ten, Episode Five''

May (in a [[Mercedes-Benz GL-Class]]) raced Hammond (on a [[Specialized Bicycle Components|Specialized]] Sirrus Limited [[hybrid bicycle]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Gear|first=Bicycling|url=http://www.bicycling-gear.com/specialized-bikes.html|title=Specialized Bikes}}&lt;/ref&gt;), [[The Stig]] (using the London public transport system), and Clarkson (in a Cougar motorboat) from [[Kew]] across to [[London City Airport]]. The Stig started on [[London Buses|a bus]], then got on [[London Underground|the Tube]] before taking [[Docklands Light Railway|the DLR]]. Hammond took the lead from the start, although traffic lights meant May remained close behind. The speed limit of 9mph on much of the River Thames put Clarkson firmly in last place. Congestion at Picadilly let Hammond shake off May, who was further slowed after the [[Metropolitan Police]] stopped him to check the camera car's permit. With Hammond 8 miles from the airport, Clarkson passed under Wandsworth Bridge, at which point the Thames had no speed limit. He therefore shot past May and the Stig, but was shocked to discover Hammond had still won by a fair margin. The Stig arrived a short while later, beating May by 15 minutes. Despite the result shown in the film, the presenters mockingly denied this outcome (by saying things such as Hammond crashing into railings and Clarkson's boat exploding), and insisted that May in the Mercedes-Benz won the race fairly. '''''Winner: Bicycle'''''

'''DVD Release''': This race was released as part of the Season 10 box set. It was also released as part of the ''Top Gear: The Challenges 2'' DVD.

==={{anchor|s11e4}} Nissan GT-R vs. Japanese Public Transit System - Distance 355 miles===
''Series Eleven, Episode Four''

Clarkson drove a [[Nissan GT-R]] through Japan, from [[Hakui, Ishikawa]] to [[Mount Nokogiri (Chiba)|Mount Nokogiri]], while Hammond and May took public transport—most notably the 188&amp;nbsp;mph [[Shinkansen]]. First they took a [[Thunderbird (train)|limited express train]] from [[Hakui Station|Hakui]] to [[Kyoto Station|Kyoto]], before getting on the [[Tōkaidō Shinkansen|bullet train]] to [[Shin-Yokohama Station|Shin-Yokohama]], they then had to take the [[Yokohama Municipal Subway|Yokohama Subway]] to [[Yokohama Station]], where they got on the [[Keikyu Main Line|suburban train]] to [[Keikyu Kurihama Station|Kurihama]] and caught the bus to the [[Tokyo-Wan Ferry|ferry]]. While in Tokyo, Clarkson accidentally turned off the satnav system in the GT-R and struggled to turn it back on as the system only spoke Japanese, costing him 45 minutes. By the time he had managed to turn it back on, Hammond and May had taken the lead. However, May and Hammond were temporarily separated when their train split. They eventually regrouped when Hammond asked May to hold the bus. May and Hammond then crossed [[Tokyo Bay]] on a ferry, from which they used folding bicycles (carried in their suitcases) to the cable car, which got them up to the top of Mount Nokogiri; however Clarkson had already made it to the summit, just 3 minutes before them. '''''Winner: Car'''''

'''DVD Release''': This race was released as part of the Season 11 box set. It was also released as part of the ''Top Gear: The Challenges 3'' DVD.

==={{anchor|s12e4}} Economy Race to Blackpool - Jaguar XJ vs. VW Polo vs. Subaru Legacy - Distance 750 miles===
''Series Twelve, Episode Four''

With the team booked to switch on the famous [[Blackpool Illuminations]], the three were presented with a challenge to determine which of them would get the honour of pulling the switch. This took the form of a race from [[Basel]] to Blackpool, taking a route of their choice and using any unmodified production car, the only restriction being that they could only use a single tank of fuel. All three presenters chose diesel vehicles - May a [[Subaru Legacy]], Hammond a [[Volkswagen Polo]] BlueMotion, to the scorn of his compatriots, and Clarkson a [[Jaguar XJ]]. He had dismissed the race as pointless, since the figures indicated no production car at the time could make the distance, and therefore decided to "fail in style and comfort". Finally, the Stig was dropped off in Blackpool to pull the switch if no-one arrived.

Each presenter took different routes across France. Hammond opted for the shortest possible, while May added 30 miles to avoid mountains and several towns. Clarkson headed straight for the nearest motorway and drove "like a loony", heating seats, charging his phone and running the radio in the hope of emptying his fuel tank in France. After initially struggling with consumption, both Hammond and May realized their pace was too slow, and decided to pick up speed. May caught up with Hammond, and the two began an overtaking duel all the way to Calais, arriving 40 minutes behind Clarkson.

The presenters had also chosen different routes across England. Hammond again opted for the shortest, via the M1 and M6. May decided to avoid the risk of M6 traffic by heading along the M1 up to Leeds, then switching to the M62. Clarkson chose to use the M40, with his theoretical route changing to the M6 at Birmingham, although he was really trying to run out of fuel near his house. Despite his fuel-wasting, he passed Oxford with a considerable level remaining, and slowed down, finally taking the race seriously. When Hammond found out that Clarkson was still running, he picked up speed and overtook the Jaguar on the M6 toll. Given his near-empty tank, Clarkson decided to remain economical until his range reached 0, as Hammond's charge had reduced the BlueMotion's range drastically.

With May out of the running due to his slow speed and a trouble-free M6, Hammond's theoretical range reached 0. Once the Jaguar did the same, Clarkson accelerated to catch Hammond. However, his charge was too late, as Hammond was greeted with a police escort just outside Blackpool. Clarkson arrived less than a minute later. May did eventually finish, albeit 40 minutes after the celebration ended. With seconds to go before the switch-on, Richard—despite winning—claimed Jeremy should switch the light, and in the ensuing argument, the Stig pulled the switch. Afterwards, it was found Clarkson's car had 120 miles of fuel left, giving the Jaguar a range of nearly 900 miles.  Hammond and May both admitted that despite the Polo arriving first, the Jaguar was to be declared the "real" winner.&lt;ref&gt;May:  ''"We have to acknowledge though, that the true hero of this whole piece is that Jaguar."''&lt;br&gt;Clarkson:  ''"Yeah, I couldn't agree more"''&lt;/ref&gt; '''''Winner: [[Jaguar XJ]]'''''

'''DVD Release''': This race was released as part of the Season 12 box set.

==={{anchor|s12e5}} Ferrari Daytona vs. Powerboat - Distance 206 miles===
''Series Twelve, Episode Five''

Hammond drove a [[Ferrari Daytona]] against May and his co-driver in an XSR 48 powerboat from [[Portofino]] to [[Saint-Tropez]]. Both were stopped by the Italian police at different points to check documents, with Hammond having to follow the police to a nearby police station. This probably led May to winning the race. '''''Winner: Boat'''''

'''DVD Release''': This race was released as part of the Season 12 box set. It was also released as part of the ''Top Gear: The Challenges 4'' DVD.

[[File:60163 Tornado Private Charter Cathedrals Express Top Gear Race 25 April 2009 Newcastle pic 8.jpg|thumb|right|''Tornado'' on the Race to the North, 25 April 2009.]]
On 25 April 2009, the BBC filmed a private charter train hauled by the brand new steam locomotive [[LNER Peppercorn Class A1 60163 Tornado|60163 ''Tornado'']]. Clarkson (on the train) raced May (in a 1949 [[Jaguar XK120]]) and Hammond (on a 1949 [[Vincent Black Shadow]] motorcycle) from [[London King's Cross railway station|London King's Cross]] to [[Edinburgh Waverley railway station|Edinburgh Waverley]]. ''Tornado'' completed the run in exactly 8 hours, with four stops for water, while May and Hammond were restricted to the [[A1 road (Great Britain)|A1 Road]] (as no [[motorways]] existed yet in 1949). '''''Winner: Car'''''

==={{anchor|s19e3}} Ford Shelby Mustang GT500 vs. French TGV - Distance 814 miles===
''Series Nineteen, Episode Three'' (10 February 2013)

Clarkson raced Hammond and May from [[Wembley Stadium]] to the [[San Siro]] in Milan, where the winner would get a free ticket to watch AC Milan play Anderlecht in the UEFA Champions League. Clarkson however was restricted to any car he liked which cost no more than £35,000. He decided to drive a Ford Shelby Mustang GT500 while Hammond and May travelled by public transport. They took a combination of bus and commuter train to St. Pancras International, where they then took an early Eurostar train to Paris Gare du Nord. On arrival, they took a metro train across Paris to Gare de Lyon before taking a TGV to Milan. They then took the Milan Metro to Lotto Fiera before running to the stadium. With only one ticket up for grabs, Hammond and May raced each other to the finish line. May, who refused to run on television, produced a foldable bicycle out of his bag in hopes of outpacing his colleague. Hammond on foot was nonetheless faster and took the ticket. After the race Clarkson blamed French roadworks for losing him the race. This is the only Top Gear long-distance race in which car is beaten by public transport.  '''''Winner: Train'''''

'''DVD Release''': This race was released as part of the Season 19 box set.

==={{anchor|s29e1}} Toyota Auris 1.8L vs. AC45 Sailing Boat - Distance 410 miles=== 
''Series Twenty, Episode One''

Clarkson tried to prove that fossil fuels are still superior to alternatives, and raced a blue 1.8L [[Toyota Auris]] against May in an [[AC45#The Yachts|AC45 Sailing Boat]], helmed by Olympian [[Ben Ainslie]], and crewed by [[America's Cup]] winners.  The race was in [[New Zealand]], from Fletcher Bay at the top of the [[Coromandel Peninsula]] to [[Spirits Bay]] in Northland.&lt;ref name="tvnz"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://tvnz.co.nz/national-news/s-wrap-top-gear-nz-race-secrets-revealed-5367272 | title=New Zealand}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a baffled May questioned his choice of vehicle, Clarkson explained that it was a hire car, which he claimed made it the fastest in the world because he could redline it until he crashed it.

Clarkson had to drive south on the Coromandel Peninsula before he could turn north towards Northland, making his journey 410 miles, over May's direct route of 220 miles.  During the race Clarkson heavily abused his car and rendered it undriveable after crashing into a stone wall to avoid a tractor. He was forced to stop, visit a hire car centre, and exchange his broken Auris for another - then hope that May did not notice that his car was now red. May was constantly battered by the rough seas, and lost his satellite phone during the race after being hit by a large wave.

Despite trying to make up ground by using [[Ninety Mile Beach, New Zealand|90 Mile Beach]], Clarkson was beaten to the finish line by May, who had a lead of an hour over the car.&lt;ref name="tvnz" /&gt; Also, May noticed that the car was no longer blue at the end of the race. '''''Winner: Sailing Boat'''''

==={{anchor|s22e1}} St. Petersburg Race - Car vs. Bicycle vs. Hovercraft vs. Public Transport - Distance 18 miles===
''Series Twenty Two, Episode One''

The presenters decide to redo the race they did in London between all of them, this time travelling across [[St. Petersburg]]. Clarkson selects a hovercraft, Hammond chooses a £9,000 (Pinarello Dogma F8) bicycle, May picks a [[Renault Twizy]], and the Stig again relies on public transport. From the start, neither Hammond or Clarkson have it easy with their choice of transport. Clarkson found driving his hovercraft – which he called a Russian design of the presenters' Hovervan – to be quite difficult; along with his instruments and controls being in Russian, he could not keep the craft pointing forward or in a straight line. Meanwhile, Hammond, while managing to overtake and then be overtaken by May, ran afoul of the city's tramlines. Hammond caught a wheel in one of the rails and fell, shearing off the bicycle's [[Derailleur gears|derailleur]] and rendering it useless.  The others continued racing and Hammond soon re-entered the race on a second bike, which was borrowed from a passer-by (who was given a lift to his work as compensation).

May, meanwhile, suffered no issues whatsoever, and so was able to enjoy the car he was driving. He remarked how he liked the fact that it was designed for European cities, having two seats in tandem, an electric engine, and scissor doors.  However, as he reached the city-centre, he discovered that the city's streets and roads were much wider than he expected them to be. Clarkson, who managed to gain the lead despite the handling issues, soon hit the city-centre, where he attempted to use narrow, peaceful canals to avoid the heavy river traffic he encountered.  Unfortunately for him, this led him towards low bridges instead, which required him to deflate the hovercraft's skirts repeatedly to squeeze under the bridges. Although his new bicycle was slower and less comfortable than his first mount, Hammond began to catch up to May and Clarkson.

Clarkson and Hammond soon reached the finish line, with Hammond coming in just moments after Clarkson, only to find that both had been beaten by May, who was waiting in hiding for them. While they commented that the car had redeemed itself in the race, they realised that one of them was missing. The Stig, who had suffered no major issues when using public transport, failed to finish in the end: he had spotted a Porsche 911 and was banging his helmet against the fence that protected it. '''''Winner: Car'''''

==={{anchor|s24e4}} Arabian Peninsula Race - Car vs. Alternative "money no-object" transportation: Sports Bike, Private Jet, Luxury Car and Motorboat ===
''Series Twenty Four, Episode Four''

Matt and Harris are competing against each other in a race from [[Dubai]] to a mountaintop hotel in [[Oman]]. Harris drives the [[Bugatti Chiron]] while Matt takes a combination of luxury transports: a motorboat, a luxury car, a private jet and a sports bike. Early in the race, Harris faced rush hour traffic while Matt was stuck on a 5-knot speed limit zone. As traffic cleared, Harris was escorted out of Dubai by the [[Dubai Police Force]] while Matt cleared the marina, enabling him to get the boat to speed before entering the second stage, which was being chauffeured in a [[Bentley Mulsanne (2010)|Bentley Mulsanne EWB]] by the Stig's "Emirati cousin", but is stuck in Dubai's downtown district, falling 100 miles behind Harris. However, Harris was stuck immediately upon entering Oman as the Chiron had to be re-registered while Matt arrived at the airport to board the [[Honda HA-420 HondaJet|HondaJet]] to Muscat, enabling him to gain significant ground despite the 100 mile distance between Muscat and the finish line. Meanwhile, Harris attempts to take a shortcut through a network of alleyways at a town, slowing his progress significantly. In Muscat, Matt's entered the fourth and final stage of his journey, riding the [[Ducati 1299|Ducati 1299 Superleggera]]. At the final leg of the race, both entered the mountains from opposite direction, leading to a tense final sprint. '''''Winner: Alternative "money no-object" transportation'''''

A '''vertical jump''' or '''vertical leap''' is the act of raising one's [[center of mass]] higher in the vertical plane solely with the use of one's own [[muscle]]s; it is a measure of how high an individual or [[sportsperson|athlete]] can elevate off the ground (jump) from a standstill. &lt;ref name="NFL Combine"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nfl.com/combine/workouts | title=NFL Combine: Workouts and drills | accessdate=2014-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
The vertical jump is divided into two different types:&lt;ref name="Young"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Young|first=W|author2=Wilson G |author3=Byrne C |title=Relationship between strength qualities and performance in standing and run-up vertical jumps.|journal=J Sports Med Phys Fitness|date=December 1999|volume=39|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* '''Standing Vertical Jump''': This refers to a vertical jump done from a standstill with no steps being involved at all.&lt;ref name="NFL Combine" /&gt;
* '''Running vertical jump''': This refers to a vertical jump after an approach or run to help add energy to the jump in an effort to improve on the standing vertical jump.&lt;ref name="Young" /&gt;
In general, the standing vertical jump is the one that is used as an official measurement for athletes.&lt;ref name="NFL Combine" /&gt;

==Where vertical jump measurements are used==
Vertical jump measurements are used primarily in athletic circles to measure performance. The most common [[sports]] in which one's vertical jump is measured are [[track and field]], [[netball]], [[basketball]], [[football]], and [[volleyball]], but many sports measure their players' vertical jumping ability during physical examinations. In addition, single and multiple vertical jumps are occasionally used to assess muscular strength and anaerobic power in athletes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 21186549 | title = Vertical jump as a tool in assessment of muscular power and anaerobic performance|vauthors=Ostojić SM, Stojanović M, Ahmetović Z | publisher = U.S. National Library of Medicine | quote = Muscular strength and anaerobic power could be assessed by single and multiple vertical jump testing procedures. | volume=63 | issue=5-6 | year=2010 | journal=Med. Pregl. | pages=371–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measurement==
The simplest method to measure an athlete's vertical jump is to get the athlete to reach up against a flat wall, with a flat surface under his/her feet (such as a gym floor or concrete) and record the highest point he/she can reach flat-footed (the height of this point from the ground is referred to as "standing reach"); fingertips powdered with chalk can facilitate the determination of points touched on the wall. The athlete then makes an effort to jump up with the goal of touching the highest point on the wall that he or she can reach; the athlete can perform these jumps as many times as needed. The height of the highest point the athlete touches is recorded. The difference between this height and the standing reach is the athlete's vertical jump.

The method described above is the most common and simplest way to measure one's vertical jump, but other more scientifically accurate methods have been devised. A pressure pad can be used to measure the time it takes for an athlete to complete a jump, and then using a kinematics equation (h = g × t&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/8),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://verticaljumpexercisesonline.blogspot.co.nz/|title=Vertical jump exercises-Vertical jump program coaching-increasing vertical jump|author=|date=|website=verticaljumpexercisesonline.blogspot.co.nz|accessdate=27 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the computer can calculate his or her vertical jump based on the time in the air.

A second, more efficient and correct method is to use an [[infrared]] [[laser]] placed at ground level. When an athlete jumps and breaks the plane of the laser with his/her hand, the height at which this occurs is measured. Devices based on United States Patent 5031903, "A vertical jump testing device comprising a plurality of vertically arranged measuring elements each pivotally mounted..." are also common. These devices are used at the highest levels of collegiate and professional performance testing. They are composed of several (roughly 70) 14-inch prongs placed 0.5&amp;nbsp;inches apart vertically. An athlete will then leap vertically (no running start or step) and make contact with the retractable prongs to mark their leaping ability. This device is used each year at the NFL scouting combine.

==Maximization==
An important component of maximizing height in a vertical jump is attributed to the use of counter-movements of the legs and arm swings prior to take off, as both of these actions have been shown to significantly increase the body’s [[center of mass]] rise. The counter-movement of the legs, a quick bend of the knees which lowers the center of mass prior to springing upwards, has been shown to improve jump height by 12% compared to jumping without the counter-movement. This is attributed to the [[stretch shortening cycle]] of the leg muscles enabling the muscles to create more contractile energy. Furthermore, jump height can be increased another 10% by executing arm swings during the take off phase of the jump compared to if no arm swings are utilized. This involves lowering the arms [[Anatomical terms of location#Proximal and distal|distal]]ly and [[Posterior (anatomy)|posterior]]ly during the leg counter-movements, and powerfully thrusting the arms up and over the head as the leg extension phase begins. As the arms complete the swinging movement they pull up on the lower body causing the lower musculature to contract more rapidly, hence aiding in greater jump height.&lt;ref&gt;Harman, E., Rosenstein, M., Frykman, P., Rosenstein, R. (1990). The Effects Of Arms And Countermovement On Vertical Jumping. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise, 22(6), 825–833.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these increases due to technical adjustments, it appears as if optimizing both the force producing and elastic properties of the musculotendinous system in the lower limbs is largely determined by genetics and partially mutable through resistance exercise training.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://startingstrength.com/article/physical-potential|title=Physical Potential {{!}} Mark Rippetoe|work=Starting Strength|access-date=2018-04-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.barbellmedicine.com/force-matters/|title=Force Matters|work=Barbell Medicine|access-date=2018-04-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vertical jump and power output==
Vertical jumps are used to both train and test for power output in athletes.  [[Plyometrics]] are  particularly effective in training for power output, and include vertical jumps of different types in their protocol.  In one recent study, training with plyometrics (which included continuous vertical jumps) was shown to [https://verticaljumpworld.com/how-to-jump-higher-101/ improve jump height and boost vertical jump performance] to similar degrees in combination with very different resistance training protocols, indicating that the plyometric jumping contributed to the increased jump height more than resistance training.  Research into plyometric jumps found vertical jumps to be among the highest in terms of muscle recruitment (as measured by electromyography), power output, and ground reaction force produced.&lt;ref&gt;Beneka, A. G., Malliou, P.K., Missailidou, V., Chatzinikolaou, A., Fatouros, I., et al. (2012). Muscle performance following an acute bout of plyometric training combined with low or high intensity weight exercise. Journal of sport sciences, 21, 1-9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ebben, W. P., Simenz, C., Jensen, R.L. (2008). Evaluation of plyometric intensity using electromyography. Journal of strength and conditioning research, 22(3), 861-868.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ebben, W. P., Fauth, M.L., Garceau, L.R., Petrushek, E.J. (2011). Kinetic quantification of plyometric exercise intensity. Journal of strength and conditioning research, 25(12), 3288-3298.&lt;/ref&gt;
Fatigue has been researched in athletes for its effect on vertical jump performance, and found to decrease it in basketball players, tennis players, cyclists, rugby players, and healthy adults of both genders.&lt;ref&gt;Montgomery, P. G., Pyne, D.B., Hopkins, W.G., Dorman, J.C., Cook, K., Minahan, C.L. (2008). The effect of recovery strategies on physical performance and cumulative fatigue in competitive basketball. Journal of sports sciences, 26(11), 1135-1145.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Girard, O., Lattier, G., Micallef, J., and Millet, G. (2006) Changes in exercise characteristics, maximal voluntary contraction, and explosive strength during prolonged tennis playing.
